1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:03,236
(gentle music)

2
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,393
(bear growls)

3
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,610
(majestic music)

4
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,453
- Hi Marj, we're here.

5
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,789
How are you? - Hello darling.

6
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,625
- Thank you so much for doing this for us.

7
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,896
- There's my guy. Ooh.

8
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,867
You've grown so much.

9
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,435
Ooh, so big. Come on.

10
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,474
- Thanks mom.

11
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,876
You've got the package?

12
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,877
And you think he'll read it?

13
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,245
- You did.

14
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,846
He's no more spoiled than you were.

15
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,883
- A good report.

16
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,651
We'll be up in the mountains next weekend.

17
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,819
- Love you, sweetheart.

18
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,661
- That sounds like a pretty square deal.

19
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,496
Do you like camping?

20
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,931
- He'll find a reason to miss it.

21
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,466
Business trip or something.

22
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,670
Come on. - What?

23
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,905
- Help me with something.

24
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,443
Open this.

25
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:04,751
Oh, your father used to love to play

26
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,886
with all this old stuff.

27
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,555
When he was little.

28
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,822
- What is it?

29
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,858
- It's a dream catcher.

30
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,327
Your great, great grandfather got this

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,896
from a Sioux medicine man.

32
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,464
Set great store by it.

33
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,734
- Indians. Wow!

34
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:22,969
What does it do?

35
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,604
- Catches dreams. What'd you think?

36
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,808
(sighs) All of Jacob McKay's life is in this box.

37
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,682
Don't cut your ear off.

38
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,650
That's a scalping knife.

39
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,985
- Real scalps.

40
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,453
- Are there other kinds?

41
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,622
If you like that,

42
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,426
you're gonna love this.

43
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,728
- Wow. Does it shoot?

44
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,862
- I suspect it does.

45
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,433
- What was he like?

46
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,334
Jacob, I mean.

47
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,372
- Jacob McKay was a boy about your age when he came West.

48
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,375
It's all right here.

49
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,944
- A diary?

50
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:05,812
- Journal.

51
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,017
It was your grandpa's, then your fathers, now it's yours.

52
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:12,952
- Mine?

53
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,621
- You're a McKay.

54
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,655
It's important for you to know

55
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,391
about your people, your family.

56
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,559
Read this.

57
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,771
- A great animal is like crashing thunder

58
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,006
(mysterious music)

59
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,841
or maybe the sound of roaring wind.

60
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,744
(dramatic tense music)

61
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,413
(bear roaring)

62
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,900
(bear roaring)

63
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,905
(gasps) Whoa!

64
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,458
- [Jacob Voiceover] As I, Jacob McKay, write these words,

65
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,393
I'm in my 75th year.

66
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,465
To you, my posterity, my family yet unborn,

67
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,636
I leave a record of the most significant events in my life.

68
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,473
Events that changed me and my thinking forever.

69
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,714
I was only 14 in the year 1850,

70
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,183
and that was the year our family came West.

71
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,819
My father, John McKay had been a shipwright

72
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,154
in New Hampshire his entire life.

73
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,657
So he decided to make a new beginning

74
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,893
for the family in the gold fields of California.

75
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,528
It was late in the fall

76
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,898
and we'd been left behind by the rest of the wagon train.

77
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,101
My mother's name was Emma.

78
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,203
She was a strong and willful woman,

79
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,438
but a loving and caring person.

80
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,207
I don't think she was too happy to leave.

81
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,509
She was expecting a third child

82
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,211
and the trip had been hard for her.

83
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,813
My younger brother Toby was excited about coming.

84
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,215
He loved it.

85
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,783
And I guess I did too.

86
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,553
I'd read quite a lot about the West.

87
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,155
of all the things I wanted to see,

88
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,492
I wanted to see a real mountain man

89
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,026
more than anything in the world.

90
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,799
My family had sold everything before we began the trip.

91
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,667
When I left New Hampshire my school master

92
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,837
gave me this journal to record an account of the journey.

93
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,106
Mother's been sick and forced us to stop

94
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,808
while she regained her strength.

95
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,883
What little my parents owned,

96
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,519
it all fit into one small wagon.

97
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,589
- Hold up here.

98
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,490
Whoa.

99
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,026
(gentle music)

100
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,278
Did you and your brother feed and water the animals?

101
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,712
- Yes, sir.

102
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,747
- I did all the work.

103
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,714
- You did not.

104
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,916
You just complained about it.

105
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,717
- There is enough work to go around here

106
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,786
without you arguing about who did what.

107
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,023
Do you write every day?

108
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:40,927
- I try to.

109
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:42,862
- That's good.

110
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,531
Writing is very important.

111
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,869
Might've been you could have done something with it.

112
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,706
Now...

113
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,012
- Papa. - Yes.

114
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,682
- Are we gonna be rich in California?

115
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,852
- We're not going to California to get rich.

116
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,856
God willing, we may create a better life for ourselves.

117
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,927
- Our life was so terrible in New Hampshire.

118
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,733
- When you work for someone else

119
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:24,704
no matter how comfortable you are, you really have nothing,

120
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,306
nothing of any value at any rate.

121
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,611
Like the freedom to make your own choices.

122
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,750
- Do you think we'll meet a mountain man?

123
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,285
- Not likely.

124
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,921
That's probably the only mountain man we'll see..

125
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,625
- Yeah, ain't none left no more.

126
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,895
- Any! There aren't any anymore.

127
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,631
Obviously wasting my time

128
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,165
trying to teach you good grammar.

129
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,838
(foreboding music)

130
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,875
(owl hooting)

131
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:15,221
(bear grunting) (tense music)

132
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,660
(mules braying)

133
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,796
- It's a bear!

134
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,265
- Wake up.

135
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,869
Come on boys!

136
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:32,672
Go! Go!

137
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,174
(bear roaring)

138
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:44,817
(tense music continues) (bear roaring)

139
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,259
(goods clattering)

140
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,767
(bear roaring)

141
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,050
(somber music)

142
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,908
The axle's broken, it's snapped in two.

143
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,979
- Well, can it be fixed?

144
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,853
- Not before the snow comes.

145
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,957
- This is more than bad luck John.

146
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,859
Winters too close.

147
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,795
- We'll have to build a shelter.

148
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,098
I know we can salvage a lot of this.

149
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,268
- It was too late in the season to go.

150
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,238
Everyone told us that.

151
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,207
- We will survive.

152
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,108
God willing.

153
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,412
- God is not willing.

154
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,151
That ought to be clear by now.

155
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,853
What about the children?

156
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,727
Jacob gave up a chance to have a real education.

157
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:41,400
John McKay, you know about building ships

158
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,103
not about how to build a life out here.

159
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,310
You don't know anything about this country?

160
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,879
None of us do.

161
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,218
Now we're going to have to pay the price

162
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,387
for this dream of yours.

163
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,291
Including this child I'm carrying.

164
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,994
- Emma, there's plenty of time before-

165
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:09,895
- No there isn't.

166
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,066
There isn't.

167
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,270
I didn't want to worry you.

168
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:25,077
The baby's due in two months, not four.

169
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,816
I tried to hide it!

170
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,529
- It looks like the mules went off that way into the trees.

171
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,131
I don't know about the goats.

172
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,935
- We'll have to look for 'em.

173
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,937
We have to worry about surviving first.

174
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,976
(ominous music)

175
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,381
(bison grunting)

176
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,299
- Can't carry the meat.

177
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,836
Hides ain't worth nothing no more.

178
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,141
We're like that see?

179
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,144
Past our time.

180
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,284
Could be settlers here already.

181
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,194
- Roots, berries.

182
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,897
Anything we can use.

183
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,299
Be careful.

184
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,000
Don't go too far.

185
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,502
Don't take any chances.

186
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,638
Jacob. You're in charge.

187
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,209
Whether you find the animals or not

188
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,344
I want you back by sundown.

189
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,245
- Yes, sir.

190
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,349
- Watch out for your little brother.

191
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,417
- Okay.

192
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,351
Come on hurry up.

193
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,392
(raccoon chittering)

194
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,293
Where did you get that?

195
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,928
- Found him.

196
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,563
- Well put him down. We don't have time for that.

197
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,103
- I'm hungry.

198
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,672
Can I have some of these berries we found?

199
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,642
- I told you that we have to save...

200
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,546
(sighs) How many of you already had?

201
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,382
- Not many?

202
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,019
Hey look!

203
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,522
(dramatic music)

204
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,091
- Indians.

205
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,259
- Let's get outta here.

206
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,260
- No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

207
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,529
Maybe there's no one there.

208
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,564
Maybe they all left.

209
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,269
Could be something we could use in there.

210
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,169
Come on.

211
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,207
(foreboding music)

212
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,309
- Look at all this stuff.

213
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,546
- [Jacob] You know I think someone lives here.

214
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,348
I think we better go.

215
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,568
- Let's take some of this.

216
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,737
- Are you crazy? Do you want to get scalped?

217
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,378
- What do you suppose this is?

218
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,213
- I dunno.

219
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,583
Maybe something to catch fish.

220
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,524
- We were just looking for food.

221
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,331
(speaks Sioux)

222
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,334
- It means Dark Wind. That's his name.

223
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,271
He wants to know what you're doing in his lean-to.

224
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,539
- [Jacob Voiceover] Most of my life,

225
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,808
I yearned to see a real mountain man.

226
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,443
And then there he was.

227
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,778
It was like coming face to face with your dream.

228
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,714
- Well speak up boy unless your deaf.

229
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,650
What you doing with the man's possibles?

230
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,551
- Uh.

231
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,724
Our wagon was destroyed by a bear.

232
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,426
We're looking for supplies.

233
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,397
(speaking Sioux)

234
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,343
- The old man's a little angry at you

235
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,112
for messing with his possessions.

236
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,516
Dark Wind here's a medicine man for the Sioux.

237
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:02,187
They regard that bear you saw as a spirit of the land.

238
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,423
They call him Walking Thunder

239
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,291
and it ain't safe for you to be out on your own.

240
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,226
Where's your kin?

241
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,329
- It's not far.

242
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,501
(expectant music)

243
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,236
- Hour still till dark.

244
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,606
They'll be here.

245
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,213
- You should have told me about the baby.

246
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,785
- Yeah, I suppose I should have.

247
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,422
But you were intent on going?

248
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,426
- I thought you wanted a new life too.

249
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,897
- I've known for a long time that you weren't happy.

250
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,432
You wanted something more.

251
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,570
I didn't come because I wanted it

252
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,241
I came because you wanted it.

253
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,414
That's how it works when you love someone.

254
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,688
- Papa! Indians!

255
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,924
(horse whinnies)

256
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,259
- Old bear done you in pretty good didn't he?

257
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,796
Name is Murdoch.

258
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,631
Found these two rummaging through the old man's digs,

259
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,600
ain't too happy about it either.

260
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,836
- See a real redskin Mama,

261
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,871
just like Jacob wrote about in his book.

262
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,841
I thought he was going to scalp us sure.

263
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,845
- Don't suppose you folks got any vittles do you?

264
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,680
- We have sufficient for our needs.

265
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,350
- Well, that ain't exactly what I meant.

266
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,720
See the old Indian and me, we could use a hot meal

267
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,655
if you're so inclined.

268
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:47,359
(medicine man speaks Sioux)

269
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:59,404
- We're obliged for all your help.

270
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,440
Won't you stay and take supper with us?

271
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,343
Both of you.

272
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,544
- Thank you kindly.

273
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:10,582
(medicine man speaks Sioux)

274
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,621
Walking Thunder existed from the beginning.

275
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,558
The ancients knew that his strength and power

276
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,494
were of the great spirit.

277
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,830
His footsteps-

278
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,698
- [Jacob Voiceover] His footsteps were like the rushing

279
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:31,303
of great waters, his roar a thunderclap in the night sky.

280
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,641
The bear Walking Thunder had dominion over the land.

281
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,712
(Dark Wind speaks Sioux)

282
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,449
Dark wind was a medicine man to the Sioux nation.

283
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,784
He spoke for Walking Thunder.

284
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,520
He sang the death song for his eldest son.

285
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,823
A great bear had taken his son's life

286
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,592
in sacrifice for the old man

287
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,828
right here in these very mountains.

288
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,768
(Dark Wind speaks Sioux)

289
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,607
Dark Wind's son was known as the tribe's greatest hunter,

290
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,878
but this day Dark Wind himself had found meat for the tribe.

291
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,414
It was a she-bear.

292
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,350
He didn't know he'd hunted and killed

293
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,752
the mate of Walking Thunder himself.

294
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,955
(bear roars)

295
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,424
The son had thought his father was in danger,

296
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,895
the very act of trying to save his father,

297
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,767
was now to be an act of ultimate sacrifice.

298
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,771
(bear roaring)

299
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,776
His son was a swift runner

300
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,312
but could never be faster than Walking Thunder.

301
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,384
He said it was ordained by the great spirit.

302
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,991
Dark Wind knew that the outcome of this deadly race

303
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,493
was already decided.

304
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,729
His son had been offered in the old man's place

305
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:08,400
for his transgression. (son screaming)

306
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,902
(bear roaring)

307
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,577
(Dark Wind speaks Sioux)

308
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,559
- Well, it's, it's late.

309
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,961
You're welcome to stay the night with us

310
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,996
and join us for breakfast in the morning.

311
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:40,966
- Folks.

312
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,670
I ain't wanting to stick my nose where it ain't wanted

313
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:48,674
but I'll be heading up the Horse Creek Rendezvous.

314
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,677
Now they ain't got an axle up there

315
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,011
but they got a few things that you're gonna need

316
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,012
to get through the winter.

317
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,916
If you have a mind, I can do some trading for you.

318
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,886
- We don't have much money.

319
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,656
- It don't take much money.

320
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,091
- We do need supplies John.

321
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:08,927
- Let me go.

322
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,866
I can watch out for us.

323
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,468
I can take on the responsibility.

324
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,736
You're always saying that.

325
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,138
- Jacob, you're only 14.

326
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,641
- 14 is old enough.

327
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,877
- Please.

328
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,146
- Well, um-

329
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,681
- I can do it Papa.

330
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,486
- Well, all right, Jacob will go with you

331
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,622
if that's all right Mr. Murdoch?

332
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,827
- [Jacob Voiceover] It was a dream come true.

333
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,496
I was going to the last mountain man Rendezvous

334
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,065
with a real mountain man.

335
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:53,538
- Remember we need a cow, a milk cow.

336
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,108
For the baby on the way it's important.

337
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,477
That's all the money we have.

338
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,177
You be careful.

339
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,018
- [Jacob Voiceover] My parents were concerned for me

340
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,487
though Papa hid it.

341
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,555
I wasn't afraid.

342
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,790
I knew I'd be all right

343
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,825
with someone as great as Abner Murdoch.

344
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,104
- Bring me something Jacob, don't forget.

345
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,873
- Why would I bring you anything?

346
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:30,909
I won't forget.

347
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,146
[Jacob Voiceover] Abner told my parents

348
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,781
that Dark Wind would stay and help them

349
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,816
start to build a shelter.

350
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,585
The medicine man was old and didn't move with the tribe

351
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,554
to the winter hunting grounds anymore.

352
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,157
- Good luck.

353
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,504
(Dark Wind speaks Sioux)

354
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,507
(adventurous music)

355
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,244
- [Jacob Voiceover] Abner Murdoch

356
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,012
knew more about living in the wilderness

357
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,982
than anybody I'd ever known before.

358
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,617
Certainly more than my father.

359
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,986
He said, if you want to survive out here,

360
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,154
you had to think like the animals think.

361
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,159
(grouse clucking)

362
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,265
(gunshot bangs)

363
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,002
You missed.

364
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,105
- Matter of perspective.

365
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,211
Can't always believe what your eyes tell ya.

366
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,182
- [Jacob Voiceover] There was no time

367
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,817
for venison on the trail.

368
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,787
And Abner said wild chucker was better anyway

369
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,821
and easier to clean.

370
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,593
(light music)

371
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,033
- It looks about ready.

372
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,704
Get that right off here.

373
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,372
- [Jacob Voiceover] It was the most delicious thing

374
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,974
I'd ever tasted.

375
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,242
Thank you.

376
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,344
Abner told me about his life as a mountain man.

377
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,681
How he'd come from Illinois at 14, my age.

378
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,150
How he'd learned about surviving and living

379
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:28,420
in the Rocky Mountains from the Indian nations,

380
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:32,223
Yup, he'd just about done it all.

381
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,825
He's one of the last of them.

382
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,262
Men like Jim Bridger and John Colter.

383
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,333
Ah Murdoch was the last real mountain man.

384
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,102
(rousing music)

385
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,347
He taught us about living in the open

386
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,083
and what it meant to be part of the land.

387
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,986
At the time I remember thinking how much my father

388
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,088
really didn't know about life out here.

389
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,992
It seemed to me, my father wasn't a real man.

390
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,294
At least not the kind of man Abner was.

391
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,931
Abner knew everything.

392
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,201
And I wanted to be like him more than anything in the world.

393
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,842
I wish my father knew as much as you did.

394
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,112
- What makes you think he don't?

395
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,183
- Well, I just mean that you know more about surviving

396
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,219
than Papa ever will.

397
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,121
He's just a boat builder from New Hampshire.

398
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,724
- Well, I don't know how to build a boat. Do you?

399
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,227
You think living life in the saddle makes you a man.

400
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,095
It don't.

401
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,998
Takes more guts sometimes to raise a family

402
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:50,502
than it does to run off to the mountains.

403
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,204
- Well, I just mean that he'll never be

404
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,706
a Jim Bridger or anything.

405
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,243
- Oh, you know Jim Bridger, did ya?

406
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,412
- Yeah. Yeah I know everything about him.

407
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,748
You know, how he found Yellowstone and started Fort Bridger

408
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,985
and killed more Crow warriors than any man alive.

409
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,520
- Where'd you hear all that?

410
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,854
- Oh, I didn't hear it.

411
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,224
I read it in this.

412
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,528
- What's this. (scoffs)

413
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,797
What's it say?

414
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,866
- Oh, it says "Jim Bridger, King of the Mountains."

415
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,034
- King?

416
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,203
Jim Bridger! I hardly think so.

417
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,504
He didn't do none of that.

418
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,774
John Colter's the one nearly lost his hair

419
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,309
running through Yellowstone.

420
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,244
Liver-eater Johnston killed more Crows

421
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,479
than Bridger ever even see'd.

422
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,915
And the only reason they named a fort after him

423
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,485
was 'cause he won a bet with a politician in a poker match.

424
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,556
- I thought that-

425
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:46,491
- Best get your facts straight boy.

426
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:50,061
Before that mouth of yours gets you in some serious trouble.

427
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,068
(foreboding music)

428
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,039
- [Emma] Sweetheart. Will you fetch me some water?

429
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:05,810
Hurry.

430
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,959
- Thank you Emma.

431
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,199
We should have all the foundation logs in today.

432
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,506
(birds screeching)

433
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,461
(Dark Wind speaks Sioux)

434
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,529
- Yeah eni-la.

435
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,200
What is it?

436
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,538
There's something up there. I'm gonna go see.

437
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,438
- Toby!

438
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,008
- You stay here by the cabin.

439
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,545
Toby!

440
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,481
(ominous tense music)

441
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:21,519
Toby back to your mother.

442
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,502
(bear roaring)

443
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,459
(Dark Wind sings in Sioux)

444
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,531
(bear roaring)

445
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,582
- The story was true.

446
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,483
- Yeah.

447
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,488
(sweeping music)

448
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,701
(gunshots banging)

449
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,941
(lively music)

450
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,682
(people chatting)

451
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,189
(people chatting)

452
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,430
- How do you do friend?

453
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,098
Good to see you again.

454
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:58,770
Any new stock in the back room for me? (chuckles)

455
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,139
- What do you want for it?

456
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,274
I asked you how much.

457
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,578
(harmonica whistles)

458
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,613
- How much for what?

459
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,283
- What do you mean what? You squinty-eyed runt.

460
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,184
The horse.

461
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,157
- He's not for sale.

462
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,626
- Everything's for sale around here boy.

463
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,294
And I want that horse.

464
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,195
How much?

465
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,433
- He's not mine. I'm just watching him.

466
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,602
- Hah. You stole him huh?

467
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,337
- No it's Mr. Murdoch's.

468
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,540
I'm just watching him.

469
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,409
- I guess Mr. Murdoch won't mind

470
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,711
if I watch his horse for a while now, will he?

471
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,612
- Yes I do.

472
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:51,856
- I'm sorry.

473
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,858
- No need to apologize boy, this is Rendezvous.

474
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,927
You get all kinds here.

475
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,895
You do have to be careful though.

476
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,331
Got me some corn whiskey, do you want a swig?

477
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,600
- I don't drink.

478
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:04,836
- I didn't think so.

479
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,404
Do you mind if I do? - No.

480
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,706
- Ain't nothing better.

481
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,542
Or closer anyway.

482
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,715
Whoo.

483
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,685
(gunshots banging)

484
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,256
(lively music)

485
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,397
Howdy friend.

486
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,601
- Whatever you need, friend, it is all here.

487
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,768
Dinna be afraid to ask.

488
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,872
Good Pennsylvania steel that trap.

489
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,875
- Very nice, but we need building supplies.

490
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,743
10 penny nails. Hammer. Saw.

491
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:46,911
- Have it all I do and more.

492
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,913
Best prices at the Rendezvous.

493
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,249
Angus Campbell will not be undersold.

494
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,818
- Do you have any hard candy?

495
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:54,952
- Well sure.

496
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,855
I'd be a sorry merchant without sweets now, wouldn't I?

497
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,890
Here you are laddie.

498
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,526
One free sample.

499
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,567
- How much for the saw?

500
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,869
- A dollar and a quarter.

501
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,305
- Give me the bag of candy, I'll give you a dollar.

502
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,206
- Sold.

503
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,482
- So just head on over and pick out

504
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,950
that milk cow your pa wants.

505
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,520
- I don't know anything about cows.

506
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,588
- Well, I sure don't.

507
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,692
If you ask me, it ain't a cow your pa needs.

508
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,494
What your pa needs is a rifle.

509
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,996
- He's got his shotgun.

510
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,732
- That ain't a rifle. Out here, you don't have a rifle.

511
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,967
You ain't going to survive.

512
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,869
Now these cap and ball pieces are all right

513
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,871
but you lose a percussion cap.

514
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,639
It ain't no better than a club.

515
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,808
Now this flintlock works no matter what.

516
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,376
You lose the flint, you just pick

517
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,811
another one up off the ground.

518
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,624
- You like them do you?

519
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,525
- It's beautiful.

520
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,461
- Colonel Colt's Navy revolver.

521
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,629
You just load it up on Sunday.

522
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,264
Shoot it the rest of the week.

523
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,702
- That's the gospel my friends.

524
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,471
36 caliber, six shot Navy Colt.

525
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,740
Finest sidearm ever made.

526
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:26,577
Won't find a better belt gun on the frontier.

527
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,646
- Nor a more expensive one.

528
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,349
Took me more than a year of trapping to earn this one.

529
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,288
- May I take a look at that?

530
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,425
It's nice. Thank you.

531
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:47,665
- I'd like to look at the Kentucky rifle please.

532
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,568
- (chuckles) Done my friend.

533
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,641
You know, quality when you see it.

534
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,643
Now let's take a look at the workmanship.

535
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,078
Go on touch it, rub your hands on it.

536
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,080
Go ahead, it won't bite ya.

537
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,788
- Got gold. I seen it.

538
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,026
He's got a bag full of gold sovereigns.

539
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,661
I seen 'em.

540
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,430
(ominous music)

541
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,570
- Lakota Sioux believe it's the great spirit.

542
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,609
I seen it once and believe you me once was enough.

543
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,445
Stood near 12 foot tall.

544
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,914
Arms outspread alone measured more than the length

545
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,749
of an Injun Cayuse pony.

546
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,456
I ain't never seen the like of it fore nor since.

547
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,991
Hellfire, the skin alone

548
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,794
would fetch more than 100 gold dollars.

549
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,862
- We've all heard of this ghost bear.

550
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,701
No one has actually seen it.

551
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,869
Must be the liquor talking Windy Bill.

552
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,439
- Ain't no liquor talking Ansel Richter.

553
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,807
What do you know anyway?

554
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,077
I tell you I seen it myself with my own two eyes.

555
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,847
Bigger than the mountain it was too.

556
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,048
You hear it, you know why

557
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,984
the Injuns call it Walking Thunder.

558
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,855
- He's right.

559
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:18,956
I've seen it too.

560
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,792
(men exclaiming)

561
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:24,962
- You've seen the bear.

562
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,130
Have you seen it around here?

563
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,932
- Now friends, you know how young uns are.

564
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,034
He just wished he'd seen the bear.

565
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,436
He wants to kill it with his pocket knife.

566
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,671
(men laughing)

567
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,840
- No, no. Wait, wait, wait. Let the boy speak.

568
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,907
Maybe he has seen it.

569
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:38,676
Maybe he did.

570
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,810
Isn't that right, boy?

571
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,179
- I...

572
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,117
Well maybe I haven't seen it.

573
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,885
- Maybe you just smelled him.

574
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,856
- What exactly did you see?

575
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,495
- I didn't see anything, sir.

576
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:58,963
- Sir?

577
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,665
(Ansel laughs)

578
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,168
Been called a lot of things in my life.

579
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,970
Never been called, sir.

580
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,705
This isn't the army, you know?

581
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,907
- Well maybe that's because "Sir" is a sign of respect.

582
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,109
Something that scalpers ain't accustomed to.

583
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,746
- Maybe you haven't heard that scalping's illegal.

584
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,783
I've never done anything illegal in my life.

585
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,918
- Now Ansel, that ain't exactly true.

586
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,789
I seem to remember you and your amigos doing some time

587
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:28,692
for some long distance target shooting on some Blackfeet.

588
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,863
- You never change, do you Ab.

589
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,501
You always thought you were better than the rest of us.

590
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,739
Well you ain't bear squat to me.

591
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,844
- Well now, bear squat is something I reckon

592
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,280
you know a thing or two about

593
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,916
'cause the rest of what you're saying is just that.

594
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:55,986
- Are you calling me a liar?

595
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,055
- Don't need to.

596
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,892
Don't need to call a skunk a skunk neither.

597
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,029
Can already tell by the smell.

598
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,530
(men laughing)

599
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,231
(punch thuds)

600
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,867
(tense music)

601
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,737
- How does that feel squaw man?

602
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,024
(men yelling)

603
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:58,282
- You're right. He shouldn't have called you, sir.

604
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,259
(gentle music)

605
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,673
(rousing music)

606
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,771
(pensive music)

607
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,210
- Look at them tracks.

608
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,779
- What is it?

609
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,147
- Riders moving ahead of us.

610
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,216
- What does that mean?

611
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,055
- Means we ain't alone.

612
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,758
Somebody decided to tag along.

613
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,026
Could be after our goods.

614
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:22,132
- Well you said they're ahead of us though.

615
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,300
They're not following us.

616
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,869
- That's an old buffalo hunters trick.

617
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,738
Figure out where the herd is going.

618
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,741
Then you wait for 'em.

619
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:46,724
- Mr. Murdoch, can I ask you a question?

620
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:49,860
- If you've a mind.

621
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,734
- At the Rendezvous, what did they mean by squaw man?

622
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,940
- I took me a Sioux woman to wife some years back.

623
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,076
- You married an Indian woman?

624
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,748
- Married's a white man's term,

625
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,851
but it was something like that.

626
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,257
Richter tried to offend me by saying it,

627
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,259
but ain't no offense to be taken.

628
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:26,463
- So where is she?

629
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:36,240
- I left her and the young un, a long time ago.

630
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,879
I weren't much good at taking care of them.

631
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:46,417
They always had a roof over their head

632
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,452
and plenty to eat.

633
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,824
But it takes more than that.

634
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:58,095
(wolves howling)

635
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,501
- So you think those tracks are people following us?

636
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,769
- Probably.

637
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,540
- Well don't you think we should keep the fire low?

638
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,341
I mean, not attract any attention.

639
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,845
- Getting cold tonight, don't you want to stay warm?

640
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,816
- I'd rather be safe.

641
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,985
- Why don't you get some sleep.

642
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,776
(suspenseful music)

643
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,358
(gunshot bangs)

644
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:04,128
(ominous music)

645
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,364
- Mr. Murdoch!

646
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,565
- They're gone.

647
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,139
- You tricked me with the fire.

648
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,907
- Well, I figured they'd move on us late.

649
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,509
- You used me as bait.

650
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,544
- You don't catch nothing without bait.

651
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,445
- Yeah. Well...

652
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,948
What if he'd shot first?

653
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:29,186
- Well, he didn't.

654
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,990
- [Jacob Voiceover] I was starting to understand

655
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,526
about the laws of the wilderness.

656
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:38,362
If you aren't the hunter, you're the prey.

657
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,831
Abner Murdoch lived by those laws.

658
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,903
(expectant music)

659
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:54,611
- Down there by the creek.

660
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:57,481
- What?

661
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,285
- Let's get a closer look.

662
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,570
(bear cubs mewling)

663
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,138
Pelts will fetch a fair sum.

664
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,142
- You're not going to shoot 'em are you?

665
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,946
- They're not going to make it through the winter anyway.

666
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:38,121
- Please don't.

667
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,138
- Boy you're gonna have to learn.

668
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,574
If you're gonna make it in the mountains,

669
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,178
you gotta take what providence sends your way.

670
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,522
(wood sawing)

671
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:20,497
- Mama, it looks like take a real house.

672
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,665
I gotta show Dark Wind.

673
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,445
- Be finished in a week or so.

674
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:38,415
As soon as I get those supplies they're bringing.

675
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:39,583
- They'll be here soon.

676
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,287
Winters in the air. You can smell it.

677
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,622
- Mama, you think Jacob's been kilt by now.

678
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,358
- Don't you talk like that Tobias McKay.

679
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:51,695
Your brother's just fine and he's going to be here soon.

680
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:55,198
And it's killed, not kilt. Mind your grammar.

681
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:58,735
- I didn't mean nothing...

682
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,038
Anything by it.

683
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,107
Besides, he could've been scalped.

684
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,643
- Oh, Horsefeathers! Now go on and do your chores.

685
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,079
- All right.

686
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,628
(thunder rumbling)

687
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,465
- Howdy folks.

688
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,105
Hope we didn't startle you.

689
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,408
We've been traveling for awhile.

690
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,143
Could do with some food if you have any to spare

691
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,511
and get out of this weather.

692
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,385
- You run into trouble?

693
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,656
- Some. Blood Coat had this rifle backfire.

694
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:55,125
Almost took his head off.

695
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,527
- Yeah, he's lucky though. (chuckles)

696
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,596
Just took off a little piece of his eye.

697
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,768
- Well, we have a little stew.

698
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,604
If you've a mind to partake.

699
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,108
I wouldn't turn you away.

700
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,111
- That'd be kind of you. We'd be obliged.

701
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,452
- This wound is deep.

702
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,321
- Yeah, took him by surprise.

703
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,224
He never seen it coming.

704
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,260
- You did this with your own rifle?

705
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:35,732
- He doesn't talk. He can't.

706
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,435
His vocal cords have been severed.

707
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:41,104
- Yeah. Cut real good by a Blackfoot.

708
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,439
A couple of years back.

709
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,710
He never gonna talk again, ever.

710
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,479
Ain't that right half-breed?

711
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:53,817
Go ahead. Show her.

712
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,863
- You Indian hunters?

713
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,764
- Toby!

714
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,332
- Buffalo boy, buffalo.

715
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,136
We haven't had much luck either.

716
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,676
We hear there's been a bear seen in this area.

717
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,711
Have you run across it?

718
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,481
- I'd say! He wrecked our wagon.

719
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,317
- You didn't shoot him did you?

720
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,155
- You're not after the bear are you?

721
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:33,423
- Not exactly what we're after.

722
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:35,125
But if we see him, we might take him.

723
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,695
So are you folks planning on staying here?

724
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,897
- Might be.

725
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,568
- You'll need some more supplies I reckon.

726
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,937
- Jacob and Abner went to get some more.

727
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,605
Pop already paid for 'em.

728
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:52,709
- Is that a fact?

729
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,349
- There are more settlers coming.

730
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,418
We just happen to be the first to arrive.

731
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,353
An advance party.

732
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:04,521
- That's funny.

733
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,256
I didn't see any others.

734
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,560
(thunder rumbling)

735
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:14,764
- I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't smoke,

736
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,399
it's not a habit we hold with.

737
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:19,569
- God-fearing folk.

738
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,273
Don't suppose you drink either.

739
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,575
- It's not my place to tell you what to do.

740
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,544
This is our home.

741
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:28,845
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't indulge

742
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:29,880
in front of the boy.

743
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,316
- Didn't mean any disrespect.

744
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,754
You know being Christian folk you better watch yourselves.

745
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,390
The Indians don't care what God you believe in.

746
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,861
They'll take your scalp as easy as the next.

747
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,396
- I see you feel the same.

748
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:48,765
- Injun ain't folk.

749
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,936
Don't take scalp no more. Ain't no money in it.

750
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,374
But if they're ever worth something again

751
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,013
there's one to pay for the meal.

752
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,686
(chuckles wickedly)

753
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,820
- I think you better go.

754
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,993
- We may come back this way again. You never know.

755
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,363
See how you're doing.

756
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,375
- Who's going to read that?

757
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:36,813
- I never thought about it.

758
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,952
I guess me when I'm older or maybe even my son

759
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,521
or even his son.

760
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,658
- Getting a family right quick there ain't ya?

761
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,864
Never had much need for book learning myself.

762
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,368
I do know how to write my name though.

763
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,673
- Mama says everyone should read and write.

764
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,610
- Well, I suspect she's right.

765
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,880
Not much need for it out of here though.

766
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,351
More important to learn how to read the signs.

767
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,954
- Signs?

768
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,724
- It's what I've been teaching you boy.

769
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:25,762
This country will speak to you if you know how to listen.

770
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,899
(owl hooting)

771
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:38,508
- It's like you said, they've got gold.

772
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,843
I could smell it.

773
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,578
- Why don't we just go in there and kill them.

774
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,046
Steal the gold.

775
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,751
They don't know their backside from a box banjo no how.

776
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,486
- There are people who know about them now.

777
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,589
- I still say we should go in there and scalp 'em.

778
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,391
Blame it on the Sioux.

779
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:55,091
- No!

780
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,795
We'll surprise them.

781
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,532
So no one will be the wiser.

782
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,603
(ominous music)

783
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,783
(wolves howling)

784
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,394
- Mama! Papa! Toby.

785
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,431
- Oh, you're all right.

786
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:35,465
- Yes, I'm fine.

787
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,867
- We thought you were scalped.

788
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,937
- Were scalped, and don't you talk like that.

789
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,939
Thank you for bringing him back safe.

790
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:44,574
- No problem.

791
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,676
Your husband's making fine progress on your cabin.

792
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,977
- Yeah. John went hunting.

793
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:51,614
Where's the cow your father asked you to buy?

794
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,087
- We needed this more.

795
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,956
So I decided not to buy the cow.

796
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,626
- Jacob, that was all the money we had.

797
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,562
- Pop doesn't understand how to survive out here Mama.

798
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,498
- It's probably my fault, Mrs.

799
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,700
'Spect I give the boy some ideas.

800
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,836
- Well, I'm gonna let you be the one to tell him.

801
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:15,972
- Some men come here last night.

802
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,440
- Came here.

803
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:18,942
- Jacob, did you bring me anything?

804
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,044
- Now why would I bring you anything? Huh?

805
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,147
Huh?

806
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,515
Jump! Jump!

807
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:34,457
- What those men want Ms. McKay?

808
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:35,158
- Food.

809
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:37,794
One of them was hurt.

810
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:38,695
- How so?

811
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,965
- He said his gun backfired on him.

812
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:46,536
(ominous music)

813
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,938
- Where'd your husband go off hunting to?

814
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:49,806
- North.

815
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,245
- Maybe I'll head on up there myself.

816
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,547
Lend him a hand.

817
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,515
- [Emma] Is something?

818
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,216
- Oh no. There's no problem.

819
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,719
- Well, I'm much obliged to you.

820
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,620
- Fair welcome.

821
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,728
Son, I want you to look out for your ma and your brother.

822
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,596
You understand? Put up that rifle, keep a sharp eye out.

823
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,798
Don't take no chances.

824
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,132
- Is something wrong?

825
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,033
- Could be.

826
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,773
(suspenseful music)

827
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:26,676
(turkey gobbling)

828
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,560
(gunshot bangs)

829
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:45,962
(gunshot bangs)

830
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:48,598
(tense music)

831
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,037
(gunshot bangs)

832
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,946
(dramatic music)

833
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,852
- (indistinct) you want to keep your hair.

834
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:14,657
(gunshots banging)

835
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:17,093
(tense music)

836
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:23,900
- Who is it?

837
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,868
- I ain't sure. You stay here.

838
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,302
I'm going to double back around.

839
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,185
(John gasps)

840
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:50,193
(Dark Wind speaks Sioux)

841
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:56,032
- We are in your debt Mr. Murdoch.

842
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,069
- No need for mister, just Murdoch will be fine.

843
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:05,174
You folks is lucky you made it this far.

844
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,143
These (indistinct) is rough territory.

845
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,813
I'm headed out to Fort Bridger for the winter

846
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,882
but I'll be glad to stay

847
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:15,151
and help you finish your cabin 'fore I go.

848
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,689
- You're a good Christian man, sir.

849
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,827
- Well, I don't reckon I'm all that Christian Missus.

850
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:28,665
but I do believe you did folks deserve a fair shot.

851
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:37,073
- I know I'm not as wise out here as you, but we'll manage.

852
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,748
You do think those Crow warriors will be back?

853
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:48,785
- Weren't Crow that tried to kill you this morning.

854
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,019
- But I thought-

855
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:50,987
- You're thinking like a settler,

856
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,722
this ain't New Hampshire.

857
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,391
- Well, how did you know it wasn't the Crow?

858
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,294
- The Sioux, the Cheyenne, the Arapahoe,

859
00:59:58,328 --> 00:59:59,963
they all have seams running down the inside

860
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,764
of their moccasins, points turned in,

861
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,199
so the prints look pigeon toed.

862
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,135
The Crows' hide is tanned so smooth,

863
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,705
there ain't no sign of a seam nowhere.

864
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:11,007
- Well then it was another tribe.

865
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,876
- No. The prints I saw this morning had a seam

866
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,311
running right down the middle.

867
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,014
Weren't from any of the nations.

868
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,717
Them's from white men.

869
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,691
- It's the men from the Rendezvous.

870
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,026
- That's a good guess.

871
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,401
- [Jacob Voiceover] Papa and Abner finished what was left

872
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,403
in just a few days.

873
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:42,405
For the first time I noticed

874
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,774
a kind of new respect between them.

875
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:50,346
Abner told us that the Crow war party was still around.

876
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,115
They were on a hunt.

877
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:56,052
According to Dark Wind, the spirit of the land was with us.

878
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:59,088
The Crow and Sioux had been blood enemies

879
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,890
since before the beginning of time.

880
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:05,828
- Watch your head Jacob.

881
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:06,829
- It works!

882
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,915
(gunshot bangs)

883
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:37,060
(Dark Wind singing in Sioux)

884
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:44,500
- He's praying for your lives to be filled with plenty.

885
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,206
- What's he doing now?

886
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,144
- He's leaving a few things to bless your lodge with.

887
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,815
Salt from the deer lick, so you'll have saver in your life.

888
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:03,853
Jerk delt meat, so's you won't know hunger.

889
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,524
And a dream catcher to hang above your door.

890
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,363
- [Emma] What's a dream catcher?

891
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,566
- The Sioux believe that dreams fill the lodge

892
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:17,800
and then come true.

893
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,904
The dream catcher catches the bad dreams while you sleep.

894
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,308
So it's only good dreams come true.

895
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:42,091
- [Jacob Voiceover] After a few days, Abner said,

896
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,493
"If those men were coming back,

897
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,128
they'd have been here by now."

898
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,998
(bear growling)

899
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,474
- Emma made you some food for the trail.

900
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,276
It ain't much, but it's filling.

901
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,279
- [Abner] Much obliged.

902
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:04,514
- Do you have to go?

903
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,584
- If I'm going to make it to Bridger

904
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,486
before the snow fills that pass, I got to leave now.

905
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,490
You take care to remember everything you learned.

906
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:16,459
You hear?

907
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:20,596
- Travel safely.

908
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,367
- Lay in all the stores you can

909
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,002
and listen to the medicine man.

910
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:28,204
He knows more about these parts than anybody.

911
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:30,840
Keep your scalp.

912
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,885
- We'll be just fine.

913
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,055
- He knows more than any of us Papa.

914
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:59,302
(foreboding music)

915
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:13,049
(cub growling)

916
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,521
- I'm gonna get a new hat.

917
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,494
- No time for this.

918
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,247
(ominous music)

919
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:49,352
No! No, no, no.

920
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,453
No he's mine.

921
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:02,198
(bear growls) (tense music)

922
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,337
(Dark Wind speaks in Sioux)

923
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:11,207
Damn!

924
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,612
You're dead Indian.

925
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,984
(gunshot bangs)

926
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,489
Try howling with that medicine man.

927
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,159
Get the bear!

928
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:31,994
- Toby!

929
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,297
You got chores to do.

930
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,166
- Aw mom, do I have to?

931
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,035
- I need some firewood.

932
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,136
Please bring it to me.

933
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:42,972
Now.

934
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,310
(Toby muttering)

935
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:57,119
(ominous music)

936
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:05,728
- Mama!

937
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,031
Dark Wind!

938
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:09,732
- John!

939
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,236
(somber music)

940
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:23,145
The ball went right through his shoulder.

941
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,247
He's lost a lot of blood.

942
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:28,284
- They could be coming here, following him.

943
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:30,386
- Who?

944
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:31,287
- Whoever did this.

945
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,524
- Are we gonna fight 'em Papa?

946
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:39,061
- I hope we don't have to son, but we best be ready.

947
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,266
- I wish Abner was here.

948
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:46,435
He'd know what to do.

949
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,246
(ominous music)

950
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,258
- Is he dead yet?

951
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,159
- Shh.

952
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,427
No, he's not dead yet.

953
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:13,829
I'm surprised he's not.

954
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,400
- Well, does he still need his moccasins?

955
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,802
- Toby McKay, please go out and help your father.

956
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,772
(cans clattering)

957
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,407
- Got my alarm done.

958
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,309
(thunder rumbles)

959
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:33,349
Well, at least that'll slow 'em down.

960
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:35,818
- Not much.

961
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,254
If Abner was here he-

962
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:40,423
- He'd know what to do?

963
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,829
I suppose he would.

964
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,735
I don't know much about this sort of thing do I?

965
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:55,604
- No.

966
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,408
I mean, you know a lot of things.

967
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:04,814
- Your mother was right.

968
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,683
I took you away from everything you ever loved.

969
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,354
- Papa. I'm sorry about the gun.

970
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,826
I mean buying it instead of the cow.

971
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,894
- Looks like you were right now, doesn't it?

972
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:23,799
You're becoming a man.

973
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:29,271
I forget about that sometimes.

974
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,908
It's important you learn to make your own decisions.

975
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,913
(light music)

976
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,816
(horse whinnying)

977
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,758
(bear growling)

978
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,488
(suspenseful music)

979
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:06,769
(cans clattering)

980
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:10,706
- My alarm!

981
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:11,607
- Shh!

982
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,630
(door creaking)

983
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:44,006
(dramatic music)

984
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,610
(Jacob yelling)

985
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:50,312
(men grunting)

986
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:52,314
- Aargh!

987
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:00,823
(Ansel laughs)

988
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,358
- Come on!

989
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:07,396
Come on hit me! Hit me! (laughs)

990
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:08,931
Hit me!

991
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:09,832
Hit me!

992
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:33,455
(Ansel yells)

993
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,496
(Weasel laughs wickedly)

994
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,702
(pan clanging)

995
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:55,377
(men grunting)

996
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:08,457
You're tougher than I thought.

997
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:12,861
Not tough enough!

998
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,405
- Jacob! (Ansel yells)

999
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,807
- All right move!

1000
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:27,376
Move!

1001
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:31,947
(pan clanging)

1002
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,730
Stop it! Or I'll kill him.

1003
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:48,697
I swear it.

1004
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,707
All right, where's the gold?

1005
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:05,748
Did you find it?

1006
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:07,516
- There isn't any gold.

1007
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,451
- You lie. I seen it.

1008
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:12,554
- He's not lying. There isn't any gold.

1009
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:14,890
- Where is it?

1010
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,704
(gun cocking)

1011
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,106
- She said there ain't no gold.

1012
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:37,146
Well looks like you whipped him some.

1013
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,182
- Behind you!

1014
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,851
(Abner grunts)

1015
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,558
(gentle music)

1016
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,568
- They wasn't so tough.

1017
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,136
- Weren't so tough.

1018
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,472
What your mother says.

1019
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:07,509
- Hey, why'd you come back?

1020
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:12,014
- I don't know, a friend persuaded me I guess.

1021
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,685
It's time we laid in stores for the winter.

1022
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,589
Which means you have some work to do with that rifle.

1023
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:25,627
- [Jacob Voiceover] The men had decided

1024
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:26,795
to head north and hunt.

1025
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,032
Papa didn't want to leave us alone

1026
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:32,601
But he knew that we needed the meat.

1027
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,970
And they had to lay in enough to last the winter.

1028
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,174
They left that very day.

1029
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,749
I was in charge my father said.

1030
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:49,918
That scared me some.

1031
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:54,189
Because none of us knew what happened to those men

1032
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,157
or where they went.

1033
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,932
(sweeping music)

1034
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,941
While the men were gone

1035
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:15,177
mother got closer and closer to her time.

1036
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,888
(somber music)

1037
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,923
The night it happened we were all alone.

1038
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:34,029
- Jacob. (panting)

1039
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,733
You get me some hot, boiling water.

1040
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:44,673
I need you to help me, sweetheart. (pants)

1041
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:48,076
- Mama, I don't know how.

1042
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,747
Maybe isn't time yet.

1043
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,984
(Emma grunting)

1044
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,692
- Jake, what are we going to do?

1045
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,128
- I don't know.

1046
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:10,999
[Jacob Voiceover] Toby and I tried to help as best we could.

1047
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,671
(Emma moaning)

1048
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,139
Then the old Indian Dark Wind

1049
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,207
came into the cabin and took charge.

1050
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,844
Toby and I were pretty happy to see him.

1051
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,651
That old man stayed right next to mother

1052
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:31,286
helping her through her ordeal.

1053
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,825
(Emma groaning)

1054
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,105
(Dark Wind speaks Sioux)

1055
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:51,406
- Drink it Mama.

1056
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:54,876
Dark Wind's gonna help you.

1057
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:01,950
(Emma panting)

1058
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:04,720
(Emma grunting)

1059
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:35,017
(Emma screaming)

1060
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,452
(baby crying)

1061
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:46,962
- [Jacob Voiceover] It was a baby girl,

1062
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,463
Toby and I had a sister.

1063
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:08,884
- Hello sweetheart.

1064
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:13,221
(Dark Wind speaks Sioux)

1065
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,504
(Emma speaks Sioux)

1066
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,464
- [Jacob Voiceover] I didn't know until many years later

1067
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,332
when I learned some of the language of the Sioux

1068
01:18:57,365 --> 01:19:01,002
that the old man was praying for us that day.

1069
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:05,874
I still remember that prayer and the old man's voice

1070
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:09,945
as he chanted, "Walking Thunder, hear me.

1071
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:14,449
The voice I send is weak, but it's my heart that speaks.

1072
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:19,221
Give them the strength to walk the soft earth

1073
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,455
that they may face the wind

1074
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:23,558
and walk the good road to the day of quiet.

1075
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,294
Hear me, because the time is accomplished

1076
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:28,063
as you have shown."

1077
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:30,899
It was the most beautiful prayer

1078
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,901
I think I'd ever heard before or since.

1079
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:38,940
Dark Wind had seen the future.

1080
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:42,244
And the day my sister was born, he went to meet it.

1081
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:46,481
(dramatic music)

1082
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,051
- Papa the baby!

1083
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:59,361
(gentle music)

1084
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:05,834
(baby gurgling)

1085
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:22,050
(ominous music)

1086
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:25,020
(thunder rumbling)

1087
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:34,162
- It's been here today.

1088
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,433
- We ain't never gonna get that bear.

1089
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,936
- I'm not leaving here empty handed.

1090
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:49,511
- The venison's down there in the ground larder.

1091
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:54,549
(foreboding music)

1092
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:04,392
We've got company.

1093
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:12,300
- It's Richter! - Yeah.

1094
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:22,544
(dramatic suspenseful music)

1095
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:36,658
(gunshot bangs)

1096
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:40,695
- Shots!

1097
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,264
- It'll take more than that to kill him.

1098
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:43,164
You stay here.

1099
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:56,645
- Get him!

1100
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:59,414
(gunshot bangs)

1101
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:02,684
- We hit that grizz. I know it.

1102
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:07,322
(bear moaning)

1103
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,261
Where is he? I know I hit him.

1104
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,768
I know'd it! I know'd it!

1105
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:22,370
- He can't have gone that far.

1106
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:31,479
(Dark Wind singing in Sioux)

1107
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:32,714
- What is that?

1108
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,387
I don't like the look of this Richter.

1109
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,289
- It's an old medicine man.

1110
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,428
I'll take care of him once and for all.

1111
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,063
- What if he really is bad medicine?

1112
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:48,763
- Shut up!

1113
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:52,267
Then he's my bad medicine.

1114
01:22:57,105 --> 01:23:00,508
Sing your death song old man. That's good.

1115
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:04,746
(dramatic tense music)

1116
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:37,712
(gunshot banging)

1117
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:40,315
(horse neighing)

1118
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:41,483
- Get him!

1119
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:42,717
Go on. Get him!

1120
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:54,662
(horse neighing)

1121
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:04,205
(men grunting)

1122
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:14,582
(men grunting)

1123
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:32,867
- I think you've just run out of magic old man.

1124
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,337
- Hold it.

1125
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:44,646
Drop the gun.

1126
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:51,553
- You don't have it in you boy.

1127
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,493
(gunshot bangs)

1128
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:04,899
- Let me at him.

1129
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,403
(tense music continues)

1130
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,274
(men grunting)

1131
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:27,455
- Well go get him!

1132
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:36,464
(Weasel grunting)

1133
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:43,872
- Where's Jacob?

1134
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:49,844
- Your friend isn't gonna help you now sonny.

1135
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:55,316
I'm taking your hair.

1136
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:03,358
(bear growling)

1137
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:05,860
(bear roaring)

1138
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:12,867
(Richter screaming)

1139
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:37,725
(gentle music)

1140
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,769
- Jacob!

1141
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:48,670
- Papa.

1142
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:50,738
- Came up out of nowhere.

1143
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:52,540
- I'm glad he did.

1144
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:53,508
- He came to help us.

1145
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:54,842
- I just had a feeling son.

1146
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:57,912
- You done good.

1147
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:00,782
Both of ya.

1148
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:03,384
- [Jacob Voiceover] I couldn't believe

1149
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:04,419
that my father had come after us.

1150
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,723
I never looked at him quite the same ever again.

1151
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:10,692
He was more of a man than I'd thought.

1152
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:14,829
To this day I can still see Dark Wind's face

1153
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:17,398
as he followed the great bear.

1154
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,440
Abner said weasel and Blood Coat had run off

1155
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:27,508
when my father came back.

1156
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:29,477
Abner told us he was going to make sure

1157
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,547
they didn't come back, ever.

1158
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,950
Abner said he'd come back in the spring to check on us

1159
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:38,653
said he'd take me along when he came back

1160
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:40,688
and then he gave me his Navy Colt revolver

1161
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:43,391
that I had admired so much.

1162
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,827
Said a man needed a good sidearm out here.

1163
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:50,531
I knew I'd never be a mountain man like him.

1164
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,467
And I told him so.

1165
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:57,505
He told me I'd do better to be a man like my father anyway.

1166
01:27:57,538 --> 01:27:59,841
That a real man was someone who took care

1167
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:01,643
of the folks who counted on him.

1168
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:21,496
As I watched him ride off I knew he was right.

1169
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:22,764
I never saw him again.

1170
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:42,884
- Finished? All of it?

1171
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:45,987
- How'd you know I'd read it?

1172
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,388
- I figured you wouldn't.

1173
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,024
But your father did.

1174
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:51,626
Seems he's right.

1175
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:56,064
- For me?

1176
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:57,865
- What'd you think? Yes for you.

1177
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,170
Now, write in it.

1178
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:03,071
- I will.

1179
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:19,420
- [Jacob Voiceover] I realized I was more like my father

1180
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:23,925
than I'd ever thought, because what's really important

1181
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:26,094
isn't something you own

1182
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:28,463
and isn't something you hold in your hand.

1183
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:31,566
It's more than that, it's staying with the land,

1184
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:34,202
working hard and raising your family.

1185
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:36,471
Those ideals don't make a man weak.

1186
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:37,772
They make you a man.

1187
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:46,914
There were a lot of stories we heard

1188
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:50,151
about the old man and the bear in later years.

1189
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,819
The mountain men used to say

1190
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:54,956
that the bear called Walking Thunder had died that day.

1191
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:58,426
And the old medicine man buried him in a secret place.

1192
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:06,033
And on that very spot was born the most pure spring water

1193
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,902
ever found in the Rocky Mountains.

1194
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:16,944
Medicine men of all nations years later

1195
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:20,148
insisted that Dark Wind healed the great bear

1196
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:22,083
with his powerful medicine

1197
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:24,952
and the two roam the mountains together.

1198
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:30,625
And finally, at the end of their lives, they were taken

1199
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:33,995
to the great spirit's bosom without ever tasting death.

1200
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:38,466
The Sioux have a saying, what is life?

1201
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:41,969
It's the flash of the firefly in the night,

1202
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:46,107
it's the breath of the buffalo in the winter time.

1203
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:50,645
It's the little shadow which runs across the tall grass

1204
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:51,679
and loses itself.

1205
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,984
Life is not long or short, it just is.

1206
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,155
But I like to think of Walking Thunder

1207
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:03,624
lived for many more years,

1208
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:05,893
longer than any bear has ever survived.

1209
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:09,931
To me he is the spirit of this land

1210
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:13,968
and like the land, like our family,

1211
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:17,004
that spirit goes on forever.

1212
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:21,142
(bear roaring)
