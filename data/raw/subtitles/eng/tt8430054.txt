1
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:24,082
 THIS IS A TRUE STORY.

2
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:29,379
 SOME NAMES AND LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN 
CHANGED TO PROTECT THE CAST.

3
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:33,139
Rip by: @amarantalila

4
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,185
 What does the word "home"
mean to you?

5
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,481
 A house?

6
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:54,155
 It's a safe place.

7
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,787
 It's a place

8
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:07,501
 that you know you can stay,
and you don't have to move on.

9
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:12,632
 It's not a temporary place.

10
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,882
 Come up a little, just a little.

11
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:50,151
 Now move down.

12
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,295
 Like that. Perfect.

13
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:55,091
 I should do that too.

14
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,014
 So if you close your eyes...
 Yes, i'm sorry.

15
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:07,019
 Try to take a deep breath.
And relax completely.

16
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,032
 Have you told your story before?

17
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,409
 No.

18
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:27,330
 And can you tell me?

19
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:29,207
 Yes.

20
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,919
 I think that

21
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,006
 you don't have to tell me about it.

22
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,675
 Just think back
to your earliest memory.

23
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,012
 What's the first thing you remember?

24
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,032
 I was about four.

25
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,495
 Hey! Careful!

26
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,834
 Where are you?
- Afghanistan in Kabul.

27
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,233
 Can you describe yourself?

28
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,569
I think I always had a tendency... 

29
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,656
 to be a little different.

30
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,951
 Let's just put it that way.

31
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:52,165
 I wasn't afraid to wear
my sister's dresses.

32
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,002
 The sweater
of my youngest sister.

33
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:57,420
 I liked the attention.

34
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,603
 Where are you in Kabul?

35
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,942
 In the house where I was born.

36
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:28,952
 Where are your parents?
My mother's in there.

37
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,579
 I know she is.

38
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,463
 Here, darling.

39
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,925
 That should help.

40
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,012
 At night, I put my head
on her lap

41
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,846
 and she strokes my hair.

42
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,307
 Nobody knows how to do that like her.

43
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,853
 When I think of my mother,

44
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,605
 i wish i could see her
how she was as a young woman.

45
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,444
 I saw pictures of her
with dark black hair,

46
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,781
 but I only remember her gray.

47
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:10,369
 Go and play. Dinner
will be ready in an hour.

48
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:22,548
 Daddy took me by the hand and
We walked along the airstrip together.

49
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,425
 He lifted me up and put me in the cockpit.

50
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,011
 There was no steering wheel.

51
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,680
 It was like a joystick,
with buttons everywhere.

52
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,767
 My sister's telling us
stories about my father.

53
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,144
 And then we take off

54
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,271
 He said:

55
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:41,317
 It is important that you do not
touch any buttons.

56
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:46,197
 "If you get it wrong - Kaboom!"

57
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:49,113
 So we flew through the clouds...

58
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:53,204
 and we could see the end of the world

59
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,790
 It was too much

60
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,420
 A lot of that is true,
but she also makes up a lot.

61
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,798
 My brother and I

62
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,759
 we were completely happy
with what she's telling us.

63
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,680
 He said that while he was there,
nothing would ever happen to me.

64
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,644
 I remember feeling jealous.

65
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,230
 Why did you get jealous?

66
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,399
 Because she's telling us
a lot of amazing stuff

67
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,071
 that my siblings and i were
never able to experience...

68
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,949
 with our father.

69
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,994
 Where's your dad?

70
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,918
 Can we talk before we start?
Yes, of course.

71
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:48,634
 Some things are hard to talk about.
It's still hard,

72
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,221
 but I need to overcome them.

73
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:56,559
 It's my past, I can't
run away from it, and I don't want to.

74
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,814
 I can get
in half a year, one year.

75
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,233
 Yes, of course.

76
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,985
 We'll do it at your own pace.

77
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:11,156
 I'm glad you're finally
ready to tell your story.

78
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:17,288
 I remember high school,
And I had no idea.

79
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,874
 There were so many stories
rolling around, like:

80
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:24,377
 "Did you know he came
from Afghanistan? "

81
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,089
 That's good!
- I didn't know what to believe.

82
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,466
 There were stories like that.

83
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,099
 I remember
The first time I saw you.

84
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,186
 There weren't many immigrants
At that time.

85
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:45,524
 You were wearing a black and white
 checkered shirt. Remember?

86
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,277
 Yes, I do.

87
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,863
 - And Buffalo shoes.
I'm going to do it myself.

88
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,157
 I thought, "He's cool."
Fearless.

89
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:54,776
 You kept looking ahead,

90
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:59,871
 as if to avoid
all the attention.

91
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:06,503
 I don't think you noticed me. It caught my
attention that we got off at the same stop

92
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,638
 Look, I think it was
in high school.

93
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,139
 Yes, at the prom.

94
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,729
 Look at those fancy shoes!
 Everything was cutting-edge.

95
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,527
 Here it is.

96
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:36,700
 It's here
that my story begins.

97
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,373
 I wrote it all down,
when I arrived in Denmark.

98
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,083
 Can you read it?

99
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:52,091
 It's going to be tough.
I can't read Dari right anymore.

100
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,520
 I can't even read
my own handwriting.

101
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:12,278
 After the Mujahideen...

102
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:17,573
 The Mujahideen have taken power
in Afghanistan...

103
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,582
 They killed my father, 
kidnapped my sister,

104
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,626
 and killed my mother
and my brother.

105
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:36,592
 If I had stayed, I probably
they would have killed me too.

106
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,765
 It was very intense.

107
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:50,316
 You told Kasper 
any of these stories?

108
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,399
 No.

109
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:02,327
 Kasper, I'm going to start shooting.

110
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,792
 See if it needs more salt.

111
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,586
 When are you getting married?

112
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,341
 When we find
a place to live.

113
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,677
 First of all 
I want you to come home.

114
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:23,097
 Second, I want a place 
where we can throw a party.

115
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:27,436
 If we wait
until we can throw a party,

116
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,104
 it's going to take a while.

117
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,567
 Maybe I'll just buy us a house
while you're away.

118
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,572
 You'll just have to deal with
with that then.

119
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:49,166
 When do you leave by the way? 
I have to be at the airport by 10:00.

120
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:54,962
 How long this time?
Until June.

121
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,883
 I'll be back for a few months
and then I leave again.

122
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:02,011
Are you going out again?
I think so, yes.

123
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,347
 Kasper has no idea.

124
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,937
 Where are you going?
Back to the States.

125
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,856
 You received an email
from your professor at Princeton?

126
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:19,028
 No, a letter. He wants me to
do a postdoctoral degree.

127
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,567
 To continue your research?
Yes, i'm sorry.

128
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:27,037
 What does Kasper think of that?

129
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:32,835
 Actually,
we haven't talked about it.

130
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:47,515
 Last time we talked,
We were talking about your father.

131
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,726
Can we talk a little more 
about that?

132
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:53,522
 Yes, it's very sad.

133
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,400
 If we go back to Kabul
during your childhood,

134
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,778
 Where's your father?

135
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,620
 We don't know.

136
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:15,126
 He was taken away.
Why?

137
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:23,927
 Stand up, victims of the land!

138
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:28,014
 Get up,
you prisoners of hunger!

139
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:34,645
 Because the Afghan government
saw him as a threat

140
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,356
 to the communist government,

141
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:43,071
 after they brought down
the monarchy in the late 1970s...

142
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,615
 In 1979.

143
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:59,086
 They took about 3,000 people,
including my father.

144
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:04,842
 My mother told me
about the day he was caught.

145
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,929
 She said he 
was expecting this.

146
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,682
 Akhtar Nawabi?
Yes, i'm sorry.

147
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:14,352
 We have orders to take you.

148
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,941
 Wait, I'm going to get my coat.

149
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,150
 Okay, but hurry up!

150
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,614
 They came for me.

151
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,035
 Keep this.

152
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,416
 just in case.

153
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:41,879
 I'm not a threat to anyone.
I'll be right back.

154
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:47,802
 Then,
he went to prison.

155
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,014
 My mother told me that the family

156
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:54,809
would visit him frequently,

157
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,145
 but three months later,
he disappeared...

158
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,399
out of the blue.

159
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:31,929
 Amin, listen. You must leave it high
and keep some tension in the string.

160
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:36,500
 I spent a lot of time
with my brother.

161
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:40,230
 He's a true boy,
someone who gets their hands dirty.

162
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,190
 He bred pigeons
on our roof.

163
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,029
 Hold on tight! Amin, Amin! 
Give me this! Give me this!

164
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:52,091
 Sorry.

165
00:15:55,913 --> 00:16:00,417
 I have 69 cards. How many do you have? 
I have 52.

166
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,962
 How about I trade with you,
Vivek Mushran for Anil Kapoor?

167
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,008
 No, I won't.
Please, Sabia.

168
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:11,113
 I said no.
I'm not interested.

169
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,764
 But you have two Anil Kapoors!

170
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,183
 I'll give you Vivek Mushran
and Mamik Singh for him.

171
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,019
 I don't need them.

172
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,437
 and it's always nice to have
a spare Anil.

173
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,105
 Look at him, look at him! He's so beautiful.

174
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,570
 Ffa! You really piss me off!

175
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:32,658
 How much do you want him? 
I don't give a damn.

176
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,410
 In fact
I'm not in the mood for this.

177
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,351
 When did you realize
for the first time you were gay?

178
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,230
 I wasn't very old.

179
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:09,442
 I think I had fantasies
about men since the age of 5-6.

180
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:13,154
 I remember one of them
very clearly.

181
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:19,944
 I was in love
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

182
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,789
 Seriously!
I had fantasies about him.

183
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,503
 I liked Jean-Claude Van Damme
also, but for other reasons.

184
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:34,009
 I think
I "liked him" in a different way.

185
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,848
 Good, but I

186
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:45,396
 kinda knew all along
I liked men,

187
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,025
 without really knowing
what it meant

188
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:56,866
 In Afghanistan
homosexuals did not exist.

189
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,162
 There was not even
a word for them.

190
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:06,125
 It would be embarrassing.
for the family,

191
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:10,005
 so it was hard to
accept being gay.

192
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,648
We'd play Volleyball every day.

193
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,151
 Let's go

194
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:35,489
 My brother and I
we made a great team.

195
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,201
 My brother is very tall 
and great in attack.

196
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,704
 Focus!

197
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,963
 Currently
terrorists are getting

198
00:18:52,964 --> 00:19:01,056
 long-range missiles -
new ones from the U.S. government.

199
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:05,101
 The U.S. wants the Vietnam War
with the USSR in Afghanistan,

200
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,603
 but I'm telling you

201
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:14,277
 that when the U.S. provides
the terrorists with help

202
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,363
 to destroy Afghanistan,

203
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:20,826
 Afghanistan could very much become
a second Vietnam for the USA!

204
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,204
 The civil war began
when my father was taken.

205
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,499
 They fought the Mujahideen.

206
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,877
 The war didn't happen
properly in Kabul,

207
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:36,298
 so we didn't realize much.

208
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:42,055
 The only reason I know
is because of my brother.

209
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,598
 He was a teenager
growing up.

210
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,104
 He didn't want to join the army,
 but you have to.

211
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,201
 Saif!

212
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,789
 The police are coming!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

213
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,625
 Run!

214
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,180
 Saif!

215
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,151
 Saif!

216
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,364
 Saif!

217
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,784
 Mom

218
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:49,623
 Mom, they're here.
They've got him!

219
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:55,420
 You can't stay here. 
You need to hide.

220
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,631
 Go to uncle Mahdi! Go!

221
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:01,926
 Come back when it gets dark. 
Be careful!

222
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:08,474
 My brother was always running away.
He wasn't the only one either.

223
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:12,228
 Thousands of Afghan boys
they didn't want to go to war.

224
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:16,942
 And rightly so.
Most of them wouldn't come back.

225
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,902
 They would die.

226
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:25,491
 My country, you suffer,
because you've been betrayed.

227
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:31,998
 My country, 
You've lost your melody, your voice.

228
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:37,252
Mycountry, 
you are in pain and there is no cure.

229
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:40,464
 My country...

230
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:45,135
 Mujahedeen attacks increase
in Kabul after the Soviet withdrawal.

231
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:48,222
 Yesterday, 7 people were killed
near Kabul airport.

232
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:54,104
Overseas today, the last of the American embassy personnel in Afghanistan flew out of the capital Kabul today

233
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,438
 and went to India.

234
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,732
 Most other Western embassies
are either closed or closing.

235
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,609
 The conventional wisdom is that

236
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:05,030
when the Soviets have finally completely withdrawn
from the country, some time in the next couple of weeks,

237
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:07,491
 the Afghans will set on one other

238
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:11,704
 and the capital will be even more
dangerous than it is now.

239
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,923
 The Soviet transport circles quickly downward,
firing magnesium flares

240
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,800
 to divert any heat-seeking missiles.

241
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:28,137
 The American-armed anti-Soviet
Mujahideen guerrillas

242
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,807
 are in the mountains
around the city.

243
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,599
 We know that the Afghan army

244
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,519
 is not strong enough
to ward off the Taliban,

245
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,732
 so it's just a matter of time
until they invade Kabul.

246
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,818
 We know that they 
seek revenge

247
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:47,449
 against people they
consider "non-believers".

248
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,951
 Amin!

249
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:54,122
 We need to leave immediately.

250
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:58,209
 We pack a few things, but
we don't have time to sell anything.

251
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:13,557
 Amin, let's go.

252
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:28,155
 So you're barely escaping?
Yes, at the last minute.

253
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:12,826
 I cry all the way to the
airport and then on the plane...

254
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,019
 We fled to Moscow.

255
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:27,150
 Russia was the only country that
would grant us a tourist visa.

256
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:33,323
 Russia was such a strange place
to be at the time.

257
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,996
 We arrived a year after
the fall of communism.

258
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:48,546
 People were starving
and supermarkets were empty.

259
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:55,595
 The ruble continues to depreciate
and they keep printing new notes.

260
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:03,310
 There's a lot of crime
and you can't trust the police.

261
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,836
 At last! Abbas! Oh, my son!

262
00:26:28,836 --> 00:26:31,422
 My oldest brother,
who lives in Sweden,

263
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,008
 found us in Moscow
when we arrived.

264
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:38,054
 He rented an apartment
for us.

265
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,765
 Oh my god! You've grown up!

266
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:48,314
 He ran away in the '80s,
because he didn't want to go to war.

267
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:56,280
 Back!

268
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,990
 Back

269
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,788
 Wow!!

270
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,460
 We need to get them to Sweden
as soon as possible,

271
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,503
 so they can
start school.

272
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,714
 If we wait,
they're going to get too old.

273
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,175
 I know. What about you, darling?
Sweden is treating you well

274
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:21,388
 Cleaning doesn't pay well,
But it's okay.

275
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:29,314
 $4,600 was all I could get
together. I'll get more when I can.

276
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,605
 Thanks.

277
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:33,358
 When do you have to go back?

278
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,362
 Tomorrow.
I only have two days off.

279
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,744
 Come here, you two!

280
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:52,127
 I bet it sucks to go out with Mom.
and our sisters all the time.

281
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:55,839
 I'm going to make you real men,
when they get to Sweden.

282
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,510
 Wait!
The girls of Sweden are beautiful!

283
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:14,180
What's the plan?
Get out of Russia.

284
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,367
 It costs a lot to be
smuggled into Sweden.

285
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:18,988
 For drug dealers?

286
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:23,284
 Yes, human traffickers.
It's the cheapest way.

287
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:29,332
 You can get to Sweden
for $3,000.

288
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,501
 $15 to 20,000 for all of us.

289
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:37,173
 My oldest brother is
under enormous pressure because of it.

290
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,134
 He doesn't earn a lot.

291
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,972
 Stop! Documents, please!

292
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,727
 Documents

293
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,730
 Just stay there.

294
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,201
 Your visa has expired.

295
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,672
 Thanks.

296
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,714
 Proceed.

297
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,095
 I've dropped out

298
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:30,977
 We couldn't move
freely through the city,

299
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:34,814
 because we didn't have
the right documents,

300
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,567
 so we're
in Russia illegally.

301
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,949
 I was running away from the police.
whenever I saw them in the street.

302
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:59,380
 So I stayed home all day,
watching Mexican soap operas.

303
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,508
 The whole family.
It was the highlight of our day.

304
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,886
 Let me help you with the bag. 
Thank you, i'm sorry.

305
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,265
 It's your first time
in Mexico City?

306
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,142
 Yes! I've never seen anything like it.

307
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,520
 And so we are
sitting there for a year.

308
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:19,107
 Just sitting there,
waiting to leave.

309
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:25,780
 It's very difficult for my brother
put all that money together.

310
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:31,203
 He just has enough
to send my sisters.

311
00:30:35,664 --> 00:30:39,545
 Call me as soon as you get there.

312
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,173
 Clear.

313
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,805
 We weren't very informed
about the trip.

314
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:55,353
 Typically, traffickers
don't know each other.

315
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:02,902
 So we're just waiting for
the call from Sweden,

316
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:07,949
 hoping that they were there
saying they're safe

317
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,748
 These smugglers
They're bastards!

318
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,625
 I...

319
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,921
 think they're
a bunch of psychopaths.

320
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,548
 Get in

321
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,388
 You two! Get in.

322
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:38,019
 They are loaded inside a shipping
container, with many other people.

323
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,023
 It's kind of hot in here.

324
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:54,787
 Then the container is loaded
on a huge cargo ship

325
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:59,040
 and surrounded
by other containers,

326
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,836
 blocking it, so they can't get out.

327
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,386
 My older brother called.

328
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,392
It was... I say...

329
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,022
 Everything looked normal

330
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:08,193
 when MS Estonia came out
from Talinn to Stockholm this morning.

331
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:12,823
 The 1,100 passengers did not know
of the drama going on below deck.

332
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:20,122
 That's incredibly inhumane.
It's the worst human trafficking.

333
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:27,672
 Havio 64 refugees confined
in a tráiler struggling to escape.

334
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,965
 It's unclear how long
they were in there.

335
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:36,721
 Of the 64, 26 were children,
the youngest was only 8 months old.

336
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:52,195
 They almost died on the way.

337
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,826
 They're not okay.

338
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:01,288
 I think it's mostly the shock,
But they're not talking much.

339
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,711
 I know someone
who can take a look at them.

340
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:21,599
 I just need to clarify one thing:
Your two sisters survived, right?

341
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,353
 Yes, i'm sorry.
They're not dead?

342
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:28,231
 And you have an older brother,
and everyone lives in Sweden?

343
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,983
 Yes.

344
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:34,695
 Because I thought your
whole family was dead.

345
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,615
 Yes, i'm sorry. 
But no, they're not.

346
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,619
 No.

347
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:45,956
 Oh, that's great!
It's really good to hear that.

348
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:51,422
 But in all these years, you've never
Did you tell anyone about your family?

349
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,179
 I think it was only after
 I went to university

350
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:02,307
 that I started to open up a little bit.

351
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,315
 for an ex-boyfriend.
But it didn't go well.

352
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:13,735
 I told him a little bit
about my family.

353
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,407
 At first, he seemed

354
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,242
 very understanding,

355
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:26,664
 but when we had a big 
argument, he used it against me.

356
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:30,920
 He said he'd call
the police and inform them

357
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,217
 that my asylum
was based on a lie.

358
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:44,516
 Even after i'm done with him,
I've been terrified of it for years.

359
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,710
 The house is great.

360
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,005
 That's nice.

361
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:18,175
 - The property is too big.
It's huge!

362
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:22,804
 Is that part of the property, too?
Yes, all the way to the road.

363
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:27,393
 There's so much potential.
There's a cat!

364
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,563
 He's out there
as if he were the owner of the place.

365
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:35,233
 If we bring our cat,
they're going to fight a lot.

366
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,822
 Try calling.
How do you say in Danish?

367
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:44,409
 Here, kitty, kitty!
Come here.

368
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,954
 He wants it, he's flirting.

369
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:52,501
 Love, look at all
those hazelnuts!

370
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,588
 - I think they're hazelnuts.
Come on, come on.

371
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,673
They're hazelnuts?
Yes.

372
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,510
 He's so cute.

373
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,429
 - They're hazelnuts, right?
Kitten...

374
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:13,105
 I'm not so sure about that.
They're not hazelnuts. It just looks similar.

375
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,403
 You really get in the mood
summer with the heat and...

376
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,824
 But you can do it
see yourself living here?

377
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,909
 Yes, I can.
Can you?

378
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,914
 What do you think?

379
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:39,255
 Would you be able to live here, love? 
I don't want to be here alone.

380
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:44,302
 Yes, of course.
So you're not going.

381
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,224
 Suddenly having several
commitments at one time.

382
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:56,315
 The narrow roads
and the big fields...

383
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:02,403
 remind me
of my time in the asylum.

384
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,827
 I'm scared
of getting depressed here.

385
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:20,297
 You're never going to be a part of this family.
Get out! I never want to see her again!

386
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,715
 But I'm carrying
our son!

387
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,635
 You can't
just expel me!

388
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,728
 Police!

389
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:42,235
 We heard noise. Open the door!
We just want to talk to you.

390
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,197
 We need to see your papers! 
Open the door.

391
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:49,994
 Oh, fuck! I hate them.
They're the worst people in the world.

392
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,664
 They stu nk of vodka. 
It was disgusting.

393
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,666
 We know you're there, Abram!

394
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,335
 The most unpleasant people
that you can imagine!

395
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:02,047
 Worse than the traffickers!

396
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:04,800
 We've got all day.

397
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:11,389
 I don't remember
the day we ran away,

398
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,976
 or how we got out of Russia.

399
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,896
 I don't remember.

400
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,402
 We drove for hours.

401
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:30,451
 Now I remember. We're in a big truck,

402
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:35,164
 that usually carried wood.
They lead us.

403
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:40,918
 We went out in a forest
and we had to sit and wait.

404
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,300
 It's too cold, and our clothes
 are not warm enough.

405
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:15,996
 there are two things i will
never forget about that night

406
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,505
 Come on, Mom,
We need to keep up.

407
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:31,219
 Faster, faster! And don't say anything.

408
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,597
 Wait

409
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,391
 Stop.

410
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,530
 You there! Keep walking!

411
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,996
 He needs some other shoes. 
We don't have any.

412
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:43,541
 Are you kidding me? You know we're
sneaking across the border, don't you?

413
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,003
 What do you want me to do?
Take them off!

414
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,295
 He can't just
take off his shoes!

415
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,715
 If you don't take them off, I will!

416
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,134
 What's the matter with you?
You   can't stop.

417
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:55,429
 You must keep walking.
Let's go!

418
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,273
 No! Stop! I'm going to carry him.

419
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,983
 I'm going to carry him.

420
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:12,820
 We're not going to wait for him. Go!

421
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:19,452
 You must stay there, love.
He's helping us.

422
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,371
 Thanks.

423
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:32,132
 Wait! Come and help us

424
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,603
 She's slowing us down.
Why don't you just shoot her in the head?

425
00:42:48,523 --> 00:42:54,237
 "Let's shoot her in the head
and leave her here." How cold-blooded.

426
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,990
 I'm going to do it. It's easy enough.

427
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:02,036
 No, I'll make sure she walks.
Let's hurry up.

428
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:07,751
 I think he said that to her son.

429
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:19,012
 My mother was old too.

430
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:31,023
 That woman...
It was good she didn't understand Russian.

431
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:56,300
 They'll get a boat
to take us to Sweden.

432
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,885
 Across the Baltic Sea to Sweden.

433
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,806
 I know the boat won't go.

434
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,728
 My mother's afraid of water.

435
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,646
 Are we all going on this boat? 
I guess so.

436
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:15,402
 But is there enough room?
There has to be.

437
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:19,739
 We'll never convince Mom
to get into it.

438
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,909
 She's going to have to get in. 
She can't stay here.

439
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:31,208
 You must stay
below deck,

440
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:35,422
 so the coast guard
 won't see you.

441
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:40,260
 We stripped out the inside,
there's space down there.

442
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,222
 It will take two days to get to Sweden.
Let's go!

443
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,974
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

444
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:47,601
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

445
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:55,168
 We sailed for hours.
I think.

446
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:58,088
 People threw up.

447
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:03,175
 It was horrible, very bad.

448
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,237
 Water! The water's coming in! 
Help! Help!

449
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,365
 Open up!

450
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:51,224
 So we bail out the water, 
in torrential rain.

451
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:55,228
 We keep taking it out,
because it kept coming in.

452
00:46:55,228 --> 00:46:59,148
 The boat has no radio,

453
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:03,903
 so we can't ask for help.

454
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,701
 Nobody can swim either.

455
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,748
 It would have been easier
if I were alone.

456
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,043
 My mother was terrified.

457
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:24,382
 Whenever she talked about death,
she mentioned water.

458
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:30,514
 Dying in the water, drowning,
was her worst nightmare.

459
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:40,231
 What's going on
in your head?

460
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:46,820
 Who do I save first,
if the boat sinks?

461
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,333
 Why, did you know how to swim?

462
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,085
 No.

463
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,882
 I really didn't think about it.

464
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:15,099
 Maybe I thought I could. I have no idea.

465
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,228
 I was more worried.

466
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,898
 who I'd choose.

467
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,951
 Some days go by.

468
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:19,831
 Help! Here!

469
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,961
 Here! Help

470
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,632
It's from Norway

471
00:49:48,943 --> 00:49:54,490
 I don't know why, but
looking at that ship,  

472
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:58,536
 i just can't
feel happiness.

473
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,998
 What's wrong with that?

474
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,335
 I'm embarrassed.

475
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:16,596
 Embarrassed and ashamed
by our situation

476
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:30,735
 People want to jump in the water
and swim to the ship.

477
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,697
 I mean...

478
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:38,159
 They think if they jump 
in the water and swim,

479
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:41,538
 the ship will pick them up.

480
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,791
 Everyone is
so desperate...

481
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:50,088
 And it's such a fantastic opportunity !

482
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,423
 Suddenly.

483
00:50:57,346 --> 00:51:03,184
 all we want to achieve
is right there.

484
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:07,605
 You can almost reach out
your hand and touch it.

485
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:27,208
 We have called the Estonian border police.
They are on their way.

486
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:30,170
 They wi  ll take you back.

487
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,215
 We have called the Estonian border police.
They are on their way.

488
00:51:34,215 --> 00:51:37,217
 They will take you back.

489
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,989
 So the police come and take us.

490
00:51:59,824 --> 00:52:07,831
 Men in camouflage,
with balaclavas and face paint.

491
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:13,213
 They scream
and scream like crazy.

492
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:23,556
 I have no idea
of what's going on.

493
00:52:23,556 --> 00:52:27,476
 I keep crying and crying.
I can't stop.

494
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:34,567
 I can see the fear in my eyes
adults. They're terrified!

495
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,860
 Even the strongest men...

496
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,780
 You see it in their eyes.
They're petrified.

497
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,157
 It really scared me.

498
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,829
 If they are scared,
What will happen to us?

499
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,414
 It must be serious.

500
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:58,340
 We're locked in
an abandoned building.

501
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,552
 There are guards, and that very day,

502
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:05,849
 they put barbed wire
around the building.

503
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,476
 People were in shock.

504
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,271
 The way they treated us,

505
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:16,108
 we call that we would stay there
for the rest of our lives.

506
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:21,530
 We have no idea what's going to happen.
to us. Nobody tells us anything.

507
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,954
 The journalists come and film us.
We hope something will happen, but no.

508
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,585
 They go home to make
TV programmes...

509
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:41,009
 But nothing really happens. 
It's just us and the guards.

510
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:46,389
 It seemed like my life 
had stopped.

511
00:53:50,476 --> 00:53:52,561
 Then, six months later,

512
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:56,983
 they gave us two options:

513
00:53:56,983 --> 00:54:01,612
 Stay there and rot, or...

514
00:54:03,364 --> 00:54:06,034
 be sent back to Moscow.

515
00:54:11,956 --> 00:54:16,835
 As soon as we got to Russia, 
We were arrested by the Russian police.

516
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:21,298
 They wanted to send us back
to Afghanistan,

517
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,302
 but fortunately
the Russian police were so corrupt

518
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:29,389
 that when we offered them the last
of our money, they let us stay.

519
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:59,878
 Thank you for
letting me stay here.

520
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,800
 Would you like a snack? 
No, thanks.

521
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,175
 What's the matter with you?

522
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:07,762
 I just had to leave.

523
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:11,682
 I told Kasper I'm doing it.
My postdoctoral degree at Princeton.

524
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,476
It didn't go well?
No, it didn't.

525
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:19,273
 He feels stupid because
we looked at all those houses.

526
00:55:19,273 --> 00:55:21,985
 He doesn't understand.

527
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:35,206
 Looks like it's more Kasper's project
 than yours?

528
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:40,961
 I don't know, i don't know. It's his dream, but
I also wanted a place to settle down.

529
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:51,764
 That makes me a little nervous.

530
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:54,559
 Because...

531
00:55:54,643 --> 00:56:00,398
 Leaving Russia 
it was a tremendous gift...

532
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:04,943
 A great gift. 
I have a life now.

533
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:10,615
 I couldn't just
give it up or...

534
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,409
 Yes.

535
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:17,831
 If it wasn't for my brothers,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

536
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:25,338
 So I carry a huge burden
on my shoulders...

537
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,760
 you can tell.

538
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:37,309
 For example, my brother had a 
Finnish girlfriend for 10 years.

539
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:40,896
 They wanted children, 
but couldn't have them,

540
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:46,943
 because he had to save
every penny to get us out of Russia.

541
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,947
 His girlfriend left him.

542
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:59,706
 Then... why the move to the country
rather than helping your family?

543
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:03,543
Shouldn't you
be on my side?

544
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:09,967
 - When are you going to America? 
Sunday.

545
00:57:09,967 --> 00:57:12,052
 Sunday?
Yes, i'm sorry.

546
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:19,434
 How long are you going to be gone? 
I'll spend a few days at home.

547
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:24,148
 So, in about four months?
Yes, i'm sorry.

548
00:57:33,407 --> 00:57:36,952
 Look at this place. 
I can't believe it's ours!

549
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:40,331
 Only the best for you, my love.

550
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,838
 Something happened to my mother.

551
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,539
 She began to act 
strangely in Russia.

552
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:54,387
 She had some allergies.

553
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,811
 I think she's homesick.

554
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,603
 She's missing Afghanistan.

555
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,615
 And it's so boring to stay at home.

556
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:23,541
 I'm a teenager and I want to 
try something different.

557
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,170
 Then I'll leave.

558
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:35,719
 This is a restaurant
a Moscow-McDonald's joint venture.

559
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:41,934
 This company is known around the world
for its prompt food service.

560
00:58:51,235 --> 00:58:56,324
 When we leave Russia, we must go 
to McDonald's to celebrate.

561
00:58:56,324 --> 00:59:01,621
 I'd want a Big Mac and Coke 
please! It's going to be great.

562
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,956
 Hey, you! Come with me! 
No! We didn't do anything!

563
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:09,336
 Let me see 
your documents then.

564
00:59:09,338 --> 00:59:11,880
 Just as I thought.

565
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:17,010
 Stop, stop, stop, stop! No... 
Where's your money?

566
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:21,056
 We've got nothing! We just wanted to
see what's going on.

567
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,434
 Let me see that watch 
a second?

568
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,644
 Don't touch him

569
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:28,188
 Give it to me

570
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:34,320
 Look what I found.

571
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,282
 Cool! I'd like to have  
a little fun with her.

572
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:42,036
 Let's go. Sit down

573
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:47,083
 What's the point with them?
- They need to learn a lesson.

574
00:59:49,293 --> 00:59:51,003
 Sir!

575
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,005
 Why are they here?

576
00:59:53,005 --> 00:59:55,715
 These two? They're greedy. 
They're not going to pay.

577
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,510
 What about her?
She doesn't have any money either.

578
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:01,931
 We thought she might 
pay us another way.

579
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,599
 You two! Outside

580
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:20,740
 I remember her face.
her black hair...

581
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:24,411
 big dark eyes...

582
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:36,923
 Oh, fuck! Why didn't I protect her 
And I didn't say anything? I let it happen.

583
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:44,347
 It's one of the most horrible
 feelings i've ever had.

584
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,936
 I can't look at that any more.

585
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:08,873
 My brother is not so old,

586
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:12,208
 but he took over 
responsibility for us.

587
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:17,213
 He wants to send my mother
and me first.

588
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:22,719
 This time,
we take great care.

589
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:28,601
 We did a deal with a 
very expensive trafficker,

590
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:34,231
 because we didn't want to 
go through the same things again.

591
01:01:34,231 --> 01:01:38,068
 We insist on a safe route,
protected,

592
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:42,655
 and for that we only have
enough for one of us to go.

593
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:48,329
 In the end my brother decides
that it should be me.

594
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:54,210
 It was horrible, because I felt 
lousy to leave them behind.

595
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,297
 Every week, every month, every year,

596
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:02,217
 your chance to have a
decent future is diminished.

597
01:02:26,992 --> 01:02:31,704
 Right. Remember your name 
and date of birth by color.

598
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,998
 You're Russian. Remember that.

599
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:38,545
 Speak Russian, if anyone 
asks you something.

600
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:44,592
 Destroy the passport as soon as 
you reach the final destination.

601
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,721
 If the police catch you 
with a fake passport,

602
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,474
 They'll send you back to Russia.

603
01:02:50,474 --> 01:02:53,893
 Keep up with the story 
we gave you. It's crucial.

604
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:57,690
 From now on, you don't have 
family. They're dead.

605
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:02,902
 You fled Afghanistan
on your own, without any help.

606
01:03:02,903 --> 01:03:06,574
 If you say anything else, you
will be sent back to Afghanistan.

607
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,992
 What's that supposed to mean?

608
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:11,077
Don't tell anyone
about your family.

609
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:14,831
 You don't have a family. Understand?

610
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:20,545
 Good. Now get some sleep.
We have a long day tomorrow.

611
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:35,603
 The traffickers had all 
power over my life.

612
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,356
 You remain
completely powerless.

613
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:07,050
 I went with another young man,
also alone, just like me.

614
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:10,929
 He was cool and funny. 
And he made me laugh.

615
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:16,300
 He was kind of childish, but there was 
an age difference between us.

616
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:20,481
 He's was closer 
to becoming a man.

617
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:23,943
 I thought that was sexy.

618
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:28,239
 I think i had 
little crush on him.

619
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,534
 Your gold necklace 
it's so beautiful...

620
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,161
 You want to try it on?

621
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:37,206
 I'm sure it will
look good on you.

622
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,126
 It looks great!

623
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,030
 Our flight to Istanbul 
will take about two hours.

624
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:14,409
 Thank you for flying with
Ukrainian International Airlines.

625
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:39,393
 As soon as you get past the  
passport control to your right...

626
01:05:39,476 --> 01:05:43,688
 Don't look! After you pass, 
you will be on your own.

627
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,108
 You will be heading
to different destinations.

628
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:50,487
 You're going to Zurich. 
Gate D27.

629
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:56,909
 You to Copenhagen.

630
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,786
 Gate A9.

631
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,331
 I'm not going to Sweden?

632
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,848
No, you're going to Denmark.

633
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:05,418
 Denmark? But...

634
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,795
 It's the last trip, 
that you'll have to

635
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,882
 manage on your own
from now on.

636
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:14,260
 Remember to call home 
as soon as you land.

637
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:15,846
 It's very important.

638
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:18,599
 That's the only way I can get my money.

639
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,059
 OK. Now you can go!

640
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,659
 Are you going to Zurich?
 - yes, it's in Switzerland.

641
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:41,204
 Do you have family there?
-Yours is in Copenhagen

642
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:47,835
 Hey, thanks for lending it to me. 
No, keep it.

643
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,797
 Are you sure?

644
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,635
 Thank you.

645
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,596
 Good luck.
For you, too.

646
01:07:03,018 --> 01:07:04,228
 It's weird.
i don't remember his name

647
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:07,063
 and he was very
important to me.

648
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:13,152
 He was part of something that had
a great influence on my life.

649
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,155
 Then all of a sudden,

650
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:19,992
 i'm flying on my own
and landing in Copenhagen.

651
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,635
 I sit and
wait for a while.

652
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:45,226
 I see a group of people
and I'm beginning to follow them.

653
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,329
 Get out of the way.

654
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,354
 I think I said "refugee."

655
01:08:30,355 --> 01:08:33,983
 What's that? Refugee? 
Refugee.

656
01:08:35,235 --> 01:08:38,529
 Where's your passport?

657
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:42,283
 Karin's here because you're a minor
and arrived without a guardian.

658
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:45,912
 A guardian must be present 
in your interview.

659
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:52,920
 The interpreter is Iranian and I am
Afghan, so we miscommunicated.

660
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:57,006
 Let's start with the formalities. 
What is your name?

661
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:04,389
 Amin.

662
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:08,434
 We need to know 
how you got here.

663
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:16,818
 There's nothing to worry about. 
Just tell us what happened.

664
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:23,492
 I was interrogated for hours.

665
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:26,494
 I'm the only survivor
of my family.

666
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:31,833
 I must inhabit the story 
that the smuggler gave me.

667
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,836
 I imagined that my mom
and brothers were killed.

668
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,046
 I cry.

669
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:41,217
 The damn story really
hits me, even though it's not true.

670
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:48,809
 I cry uncontrollably. 
The tears keep falling.

671
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:57,609
 My father and I hid for a 
year in the wilderness, before he was killed.

672
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:05,826
 I was surprised to cry 
about something that wasn't true.

673
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:10,538
 It took a month to get
from Afghanistan to Denmark.

674
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:19,547
 As soon as I'm finished, 
I write everything,

675
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:24,427
 every word, in Dari, 
in my notebook.

676
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:27,555
 I don't have anyone. 
I'm on my own.

677
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,684
 And now I've told you my story...

678
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:33,436
everything... up until now.

679
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:44,989
 Only when we were driving
 through the town square

680
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:49,619
 and I see the neon lights...

681
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,957
 that I understand...

682
01:10:57,002 --> 01:11:01,088
 that i'm not being
sent back.

683
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:20,108
 Hello?
Abbas?

684
01:11:21,234 --> 01:11:23,945
 Amin?
Yes, i'm sorry.

685
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:27,157
 At last! Are you okay?
 Yes, i'm sorry.

686
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:31,078
 Where are you?

687
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:34,081
 In Denmark.
Oh, uh...

688
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:39,670
 Why didn't you call earlier? 
I couldn't get a phone.

689
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:42,255
 What? I can't hear you.

690
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:45,509
 I couldn't get to a phone.
-OK.

691
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,011
 I'm going to call Moscow.

692
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:54,309
 They asked me to say
that you are all dead...

693
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,314
 But you're not...

694
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,609
 What do I tell people?

695
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,740
 What do I say?

696
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:17,498
 You must do what the smuggler 
said. Keep it a secret.

697
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,457
 But...

698
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:20,668
 I'll find form urn 
to meet.

699
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:25,423
 I'll let you know. Take care of yourself.

700
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:29,427
 All right, bye.

701
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:58,206
 It took years for me to visit 
my brothers in Stockholm.

702
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:05,630
 It was very lonely
and frustrating.

703
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:13,012
 The fear of being caught and being 
sent back was so strong

704
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:19,101
 that I couldn't tell the truth. 
There were many consequences.

705
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,395
 I couldn't be myself.

706
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,609
 It was very painful.

707
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:32,114
 Most people 
can't even imagine

708
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:35,618
 how running like this affects you...

709
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:40,623
 How it interferes with your
relationships with other people...

710
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:44,627
 When it destroys you...

711
01:13:47,547 --> 01:13:51,134
 There were things I couldn't 
say about my family,

712
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:56,222
 that I had brothers in Sweden, 
and my mother was living,

713
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:59,810
 because it didn't fit 
with my made-up story.

714
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:03,521
 There were always restrictions.

715
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:08,193
 Things had to be adjusted,
held back and suppressed.

716
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,740
 So, what do you want to talk about? 

717
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:18,453
I'd like some medicine.

718
01:14:18,453 --> 01:14:23,582
 Okay, you're going to have to see the doctor,
but I can make an appointment.

719
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:28,796
 What's wrong with that? 
We talked about it last time...

720
01:14:30,006 --> 01:14:33,676
 It's about me 
being attracted to men.

721
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:38,014
 Oh, that, yes. 
I'd like some medicine.

722
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,476
 What's that supposed to mean?

723
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:45,396
 I want to be normal.

724
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,693
 I don't want to like men.

725
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:56,408
 Not that I considered it a disease,
but I thought i could be cured,

726
01:14:57,284 --> 01:15:00,662
 that it was something
that could be cured.

727
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:05,000
 But she told me
that it wasn't that simple.

728
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:10,505
 Okay, fuck... It's something 
i have to live with.

729
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:20,849
 The fear of being rejected 
from my family,

730
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:24,019
 for being gay,
because it wasn't acceptable.

731
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,811
 Family meant 
a lot to me,

732
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,814
 since I'm out on my own
in Denmark.

733
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:30,774
 Brother
You're finally here!

734
01:15:30,775 --> 01:15:36,030
 It was the only point of reference 
in our crazy lives.

735
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:40,993
 The thought of losing it
it was very scary.

736
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:43,622
 When are you going to find a girlfriend?

737
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,373
 The girls of Denmark
aren't they pretty?

738
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,835
 Maybe I should go help you.

739
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:52,796
 I'm sure I can 
find one for you.

740
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:57,927
 I didn't even want to tell my brother.
I'm in Stockholm

741
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:03,000
 and had no plans to tell him,
but it just happened.

742
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:08,813
 He kept pestering me
about not having a girlfriend.

743
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:13,568
 Finally, I felt so
intimidated and said:

744
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:18,948
 "I don't have a girlfriend because
I'm not interested in girls."

745
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:22,159
 Everybody stayed 
completely quiet.

746
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:33,671
 Are you sure?

747
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,756
 Yes.

748
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:39,594
 Have you ever been with a girl?

749
01:16:42,555 --> 01:16:45,266
 Amin, come with me

750
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,895
 Where are we going? 
Just come.

751
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:46,202
 Come.

752
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,208
 What's going on? 
You'll see.

753
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,512
In here. Have a good time.

754
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:38,128
 There's nothing to worry about.
We've always known.

755
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:40,965
 Thank you.

756
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,728
 Can I help you? What do you want?

757
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,730
 Can I help you? What do you want?

758
01:19:02,695 --> 01:19:08,158
There I was. My first time
alone in a gay club...

759
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:11,412
 and i didn't go home

760
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:34,476
 I've always made my career 
the priority.

761
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:38,648
When should I choose between 
a guy, a career or an education?

762
01:19:38,731 --> 01:19:42,152
 I've always chosen education. 
Cold and cynical.

763
01:19:42,153 --> 01:19:45,029
 Please welcome us
to the next speaker: Amin Nawabi.

764
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:51,368
 My brothers sacrificed themselves
so much for me.

765
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:57,207
 I had to do well. I felt 
a huge responsibility.

766
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:10,095
 It was important to be tough.

767
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,810
 Just now, that I'm
talking about it,

768
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:21,356
i'm beginning to realize 
how difficult it's been.

769
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:23,818
 It hurts to think about it.

770
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,909
 Being back in the States...

771
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:37,623
 i admit to becoming very tired of 
being constantly on the move.

772
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,293
It's good for my career,

773
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:46,841
 - but it's not so good for... 
It's not that good for you.

774
01:20:46,841 --> 01:20:49,636
 It's not so good for me.

775
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:54,556
 The first time I interviewed you 
in my house, you mentioned

776
01:20:54,557 --> 01:20:59,103
there were things that needed
to come to an agreement

777
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:22,668
 You grow up. 
You grow up too fast.

778
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:26,756
 When you run away from the child,

779
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,926
 it takes time to learn

780
01:21:30,927 --> 01:21:33,220
 to trust people.

781
01:21:35,306 --> 01:21:35,931
You're always on guard,
All the time...

782
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:39,810
 You're always on guard, 
All the time...

783
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:41,895
 All the time...

784
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:49,153
 Even when you're in a safe place,
you're on guard.

785
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:11,216
 I feel like something needs to happen.

786
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:38,161
 4 MONTHS LATER

787
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,051
 Ta-da!

788
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:56,429
 I'm not going to carry you in my lap.

789
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,849
 Prefer to carry a cactus
instead?

790
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,141
 It's almost the same.

791
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:07,523
 That's all I'm going to put away.

792
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,613
 It's a little...
Yes, i'm sorry.

793
01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:16,448
 Look at the view. It's amazing.

794
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,451
 Look at the view. It's amazing.

795
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:23,706
 Every time you look at it,
you think, "Wow!"

796
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:28,836
 The garden is really beautiful.

797
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:34,300
 I wonder if we have enough 
things to fill the place.

798
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:50,399
 Baby, I think I saw a big 
clump of raspberries off the lot.

799
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:01,118
 Look! That's all raspberries!
Wow, that's great.

800
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,832
 That's nice.
We just need to take care of this.

801
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:09,961
 It's wet. 
You can see it from here.

802
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,753
 The view from the house is better than from here.

803
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:15,216
 AMIN AND KASPER
 GOT MARRIED THAT YEAR

804
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:20,555
 AMIN'S BROTHER AND MOTHER GOT OUT
 OF RUSSIA A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER.

805
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,140
 THE FAMILY IS SCATTERED
ALL OVER EUROPE.

806
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:28,145
 THEY STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT 
HAPPENED TO THEIR FATHER.

807
01:24:28,345 --> 01:24:32,675
Rip by: @amarantalila

808
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:22,009
 THANKS TO AMIN, HIS FAMILY
AND ALL THE PARTICIPANTS.

809
01:26:25,158 --> 01:26:27,459
FROM AMIN: "HEARTFELT THANKS TO MY BROTHERS, WHO HAVE SACRIFICED A LOT IN VARIOUS WAYS

810
01:26:29,188 --> 01:26:32,358
SO I COULD BE WHERE I AM TODAY.
KR, YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.

811
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:37,958
LASTLY, I THANK THE LOVE OF MY LIFE WHO PUT UP WITH 4 YEARS OF TURBULENCE

812
01:26:37,898 --> 01:26:40,199
AND FOR PUTTING HIS DREAMS ASIDE 
SO I COULD PURSUE MINE."
