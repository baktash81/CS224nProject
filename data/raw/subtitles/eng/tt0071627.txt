good moonlight outside.

Would you sleep if
it were your money?

No way.

00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,800
Well get on your horse and
let's grab some atmosphere.

up the ravelled sleeve of care.

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,660
Honey, you should read
some of this stuff.

405
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,430
It's incredible.

406
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,850
I don't want to read it.

soul, oh master of the dark.

David, please.

410
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,970
That makes me uncomfortable.

it's phony, why don't you?

Why don't you ask Mr. Price?

as though he's

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:51,790
Easy, honey.

But just look at him.

00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,600
OK, so he's a creep.

headstones is his thing.

surprisingly enough he agreed.

00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,270
Eric, it's the sixth take.

559
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,200
Can I please put on my
double wardrobe now?

560
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,500
Double wardrobe, on my budget?

561
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,650
You've got to be kidding.

562
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,220
But I'm soaked.

563
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,500
We've been out here for hours.

564
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,730
We'd be inside if you'd
get the damn scene right.

565
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,710
All you have to do is
walk away from camera

566
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,600
As if you're in a hurry.

567
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,690
You don't care about the rain.

568
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,460
That's what you think.

569
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,560
Because you're going
to meet your lover.

570
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,660
Now if you can manage to convey
that and walk at the same time,

571
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,470
We'll all go inside.

572
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,170

00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,260
Take seven.

00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
Let's make one.

575
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,170
Hit the rain!

00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,050
Mark it.

00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,520

Can't you walk any faster?

581
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,620
Now go to the left.

anything that awful?

Look at that.

00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,700
Where do you think
that came from?

Sometime last night
half of Ms. Dorian's cat

611
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,860
Was neatly deposited
on the lawn.

612
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,670
You're accusing me
of this vulgarity?

613
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,430
Part of a headstone
was found nearby.

your calling card.

No.

You're sure?

619
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,010
No name on the headstone?

620
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:07,510
None.

What are you doing with
that chisel, baking a cake?

Obviously you'll
give me no peace

Bet it's wear and
tear on the old back.

Don't scoff at things
you know nothing about.

What's there to know about
headstones, except death?

Now what are you talking about?

636
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,360
There are eight graves in the
Beal family plot, Mr. Hartman.

637
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,010
Only seven headstones.

638
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,530
So make another one.

been able to find out

00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,260
That's why I'm making
my picture here, Price.

Other than that, I
don't give a damn.

Mr. Hartman.

650
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,350
Mrs. Beal was experimenting
with the occult when she died,

651
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:02,470
And her death was no ordinary
suicide, I assure you.

00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,560
What you're doing here... the
subject matter of your film...

653
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,570
Whatever... I believe you to
be in great danger yourself.

00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,250
Price, I've made
a lot of films.

655
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,700
Mostly about witchcraft.

656
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:18,590
And you and I... we both know
that it's all a lot of crap.

657
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,090
Perhaps.

658
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:19,840
Perhaps not.

659
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,420
But there are
signs, Mr. Hartman.

660
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,310
I've seen them.

661
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:25,180
This cat that was killed...

662
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,960
What is it, Price?

663
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,640
The devil?

664
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,540
Did the devil kill the cat?

665
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,120
Or maybe a ghost, or a vampire?

666
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,720
Or what about you?

667
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,110

realized it would do

668
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,910
No good to try to talk to you.

669
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,780
I'm we both
understand each other.

670
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,580
Since you found
your own way in,

671
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,810
I'm sure you can manage
to find your own way out.

672
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,920
I'll do that.

00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,900

lights, no shoot.

In her room, packing.

This house, this movie.

supposed to do with my movie?

00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,760
Well, get a new ending.

I don't care, Eric.

00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,530
I just want to go home.

Do you know what it would cost
me to move into the studio

701
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:45,960
And build a set?

Oh, money, money.

00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,900
Is that all you can think about?

00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,850
I tell you, I feel threatened.

And I can't stand
it another minute.

Listen, baby.

00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,450
What you're pulling
might have worked

In the studios 10 years ago,
but not here, and not now.

But you're walking all right.

And when you get
there you're going

00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,920
Or even in the profession

You have taken vows.

Vows to the devil.

728
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,720
I'll go to the priest.

729
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,330
Beg for forgiveness.

730
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:09,970
There is no forgiveness.

731
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,370
They will burn you at
the stake for your sins.

732
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,950
Then we'll run.

733
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,040
They'll hunt you
like an animal.

734
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,620
Running away is not an answer.

735
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,750
It's my answer.

736
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,230
Don't you see, Maria?

737
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,950
I love him.

738
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,610
That means nothing.

739
