STORY OF O

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:57,240
English subtitle synchronization
neaion@yahoo.com

3
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,710
One day,
her lover takes O

4
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,380
where they never go:

5
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,510
Park Monceau, Park Montsouris
or another,

6
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,600
in a bright alley,
bordered by a huge dark forest.

7
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,600
It'll soon be evening
and it's almost autumn.

8
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,640
René asks O to take off
her underwear.

9
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,600
In the car going God knows where,

10
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,850
O dares ask nothing,

11
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,310
fearing the driver.

12
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,600
Take them off.

13
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,370
Sit straight on the seat.

14
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,260
Never cross your legs
or keep your knees together.

15
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,720
This is it.

16
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,610
You'll go and ring.

17
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,530
Follow whoever opens
and obey their orders.

18
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,450
You want to?

19
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,910
Yes.

20
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,880
And you?

21
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,380
I'll be here.

22
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,340
Go.

23
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,690
Another beginning could be
more brutal and simpler.

24
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,820
O was driven

25
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,650
by her lover
and an unknown friend.

26
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,080
The unknown friend said

27
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,910
that her lover was
in charge of her preparation.

28
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,160
O wondered
why her hands were tied,

29
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,790
as she was ready to obey her lover.

30
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,370
Maybe it was one of his wishes,

31
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,660
like leaving her alone,
waiting pointlessly

32
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,130
for half an hour or an hour

33
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,420
or two, I don't know...

34
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,010
But it felt like a century.

35
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,610
You mustn't
keep your knees together.

36
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,920
Turn her around.
Let us see her.

37
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,480
Bondage?

38
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,030
No, never.

39
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,410
Whip?

40
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,790
Not whipping her a little
and giving her pleasure.

41
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,050
The point is to draw tears
from her.

42
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,060
Whenever we whip you here,
you'll be blindfolded.

43
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,110
But not tonight.

44
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,980
You'll see yourself
the first time.

45
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,570
You're proud!

46
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,200
I want to hear her scream.

47
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,000
Immediately!

48
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,510
No!
I can't any more!

49
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,270
I beg you!

50
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,770
No.
It leaves too deep marks.

51
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,530
Punishment by the whip
lasts longer.

52
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,780
I want you to use only the whip.

53
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,990
As you wish.

54
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,890
René!

55
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,600
- I did it, you see?
- Yes.

56
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,730
For you.

57
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,730
Yes, for me.

58
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,150
Don't get up, remain seated.

59
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,200
Tomorrow you'll wear this.

60
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,450
It's practical.
Show her why.

61
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,790
The women in the castle and park

62
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,790
dress like this.

63
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,130
It makes you available

64
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,670
to those wishing to use you.

65
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,300
As they wish, whenever they wish.

66
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,680
Before I tell you all the rules,

67
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,640
I must remind you again

68
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,850
you're here voluntarily

69
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,020
and you're still free to leave.

70
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,110
Do you want to leave?

71
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,230
Don't give me that look,
you'll feel sorry.

72
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,160
One last time,
do you want to leave?

73
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,490
In that case,

74
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,120
you'll have to abide by these rules.

75
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,210
You're in an alley
that leads to the park.

76
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,590
Your servant's Pierre.

77
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,090
A servant?

78
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,760
The one who'll bind you at night.

79
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,600
He'll also whip you.

80
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,180
Servants can take us.
Pierre, he is...

81
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,890
Don't look him in the eyes!

82
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,360
- He's what?
- You heard.

83
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,020
Not in my eyes!

84
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,870
I'll return for her.

85
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,920
Jeanne and Andrée asked her name.

86
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,970
O.

87
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,100
Your lover sent you?

88
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,520
You're lucky.
They'll be hard on you.

89
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,650
Why?

90
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,650
You'll understand.

91
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,450
Well, lady?

92
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,040
O wondered

93
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,710
why charm and terror
were so mixed,

94
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,250
why terror was so sweet.

95
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,890
Get up.

96
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,830
Turn around.

97
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,290
It's 9 o'clock.
Eat quickly, then sleep.

98
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,800
You know that?

99
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,390
About the sugar?
I was told.

100
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,230
Enough, we mustn't speak.

101
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,230
- Come, Andrée.
- But tell me...

102
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,660
My love!

103
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,540
Come, let's see you.

104
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,900
Obey.

105
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,540
O felt soiled and guilty
of the illicit pleasure

106
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,210
she'd had in a stranger's arms.

107
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,880
But her lover explained

108
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,590
that the more he gave her,
the more he wanted her.

109
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,140
Offering her to another man
was proof that he owned her.

110
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,560
One can only give
that which one owns. Don't speak.

111
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,020
You were told yesterday
that during your stay here

112
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:29,070
you mustn't look the men in the eyes
or speak to them.

113
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,280
From now on,
the same rule applies to me.

114
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,410
I love you.

115
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,750
But before you go
totally silent,

116
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,590
I want you to pronounce two words.

117
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,800
The name of the man
for whom I brought you here,

118
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,970
to whom I'll introduce you some day.

119
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,390
Sir Stephen.

120
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,940
It's the cloister.

121
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,190
What?

122
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,240
No, I said nothing!
I apologize!

123
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,740
I apologize!

124
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,790
No, please! Do anything you want
but not that!

125
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,080
Take me, do what you want,
anything but that!

126
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,420
No, anything but that!
I'll do what I'm told!

127
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,090
Jeanne had broken a rule
when she spoke about the cloister.

128
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,260
O never found out
what had happened.

129
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,350
Monique, come closer.

130
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,280
Come here!

131
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,150
I'm leaving. I'll only come back
to take you away.

132
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,020
When?

133
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,650
In a few days.

134
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,320
How many days?

135
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,150
Now, if you wish.

136
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,950
You want to see me whipped?

137
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,910
Yes, so I can picture you
when I'm away.

138
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,450
Will you be happy?

139
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,330
I will,
I know it's hard to understand.

140
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,670
I must no longer talk to you
or look at you.

141
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,000
Look at me.

142
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,300
It's hard to understand.
But you understand, right?

143
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,800
Why?

144
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,560
Once upon a time,
a little girl

145
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,600
saw a white rabbit wearing a watch.

146
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,600
Her name was Alice.

147
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,520
The white rabbit was very late.

148
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,820
She wasn't surprised
that he could talk.

149
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,240
Then?

150
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,320
Then, she followed him.

151
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,990
Where to?

152
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,500
In a deep well.

153
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,830
She had many adventures.

154
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,880
Go on.
What was in the well?

155
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,010
Sir Stephen.

156
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,010
My hands.

157
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,390
I love you.

158
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,580
She won't look.

159
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,750
She will.

160
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,920
No, she won't.

161
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,510
She's new, that's all.

162
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,170
No.

163
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,760
I love her.
She's proud.

164
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,660
Come on, stop.

165
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,250
Pierre is watching you.

166
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
You like him?

167
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,550
Yes.

168
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,210
You do?

169
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,550
I don't understand.

170
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,430
In fact, she liked

171
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,230
all that came from her lover,
even Pierre.

172
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,310
She belonged to her lover
through all the strangers

173
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,400
she gave herself to.

174
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,880
I must prepare you.

175
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,770
You won't dine tonight.

176
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,980
Please go into the corridor.

177
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,030
Why?

178
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,700
I want to be alone,
there's no door.

179
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,820
There are no doors on purpose.

180
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,270
Look at me.

181
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,980
Look only once.
I shan't hit you again...

182
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,440
I'll just pretend to.

183
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,740
Did I force you at the stairs?

184
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,920
O lost count of time.
The grass darkened.

185
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,300
The days and nights were lost.

186
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,300
The light never faded.

187
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,320
After a few days,
time flowed again.

188
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,330
In her velvet night,
she was released.

189
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,250
Get dressed.

190
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,250
We're going.

191
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,940
Take it and put it
on your index finger.

192
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,730
Goodbye.

193
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,030
It fits me.

194
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
Roissy.

195
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,950
It hasn't changed.
I've lived here for years.

196
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,200
Four years.

197
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,040
I'm going up.

198
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,460
The bathroom.
It's so good!

199
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,760
This is my room.

200
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,010
Your room?
You never sleep!

201
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,290
I've put a present for you
on your bed.

202
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,720
Weird, I had no recollection
of the kitchen lino.

203
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,180
Thank you.

204
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,140
He said she'd no longer be free
from then on.

205
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:41,230
Unless she'd stopped loving him
and left him straightaway.

206
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,320
It surprised her that after all that

207
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,230
he wanted more proof
that she was his.

208
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,570
Maybe he knew it
but wanted to reinforce it

209
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,700
as he took pleasure in that.

210
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:01,210
That's not the way
you should listen to me. Come here.

211
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,380
Like this?

212
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,510
You must keep your lips
slightly apart.

213
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,220
In the morning,

214
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,020
you'll sort your stuff.
I'll take what's useless.

215
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,380
- It's me.
- Good morning, darling.

216
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,960
Sorting your stuff?

217
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,300
I am.
n i o

218
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,340
- You're dressed?
- I have my nighty on.

219
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,430
Take it off.

220
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,180
René?

221
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,770
Your ring?

222
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,100
Yes.

223
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,860
Stay naked until I arrive.

224
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,150
Pack that
which neither comes off easily

225
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,070
nor opens at the front.

226
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,760
Seeing she had done all he'd asked,

227
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,380
he was amazed
she belonged to him so much.

228
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,560
That's it.
Thank you.

229
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,480
Will you print some for me?

230
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,070
Yes, of course.

231
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,860
You look girlish.

232
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,950
You've changed a lot.

233
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,240
But garters...

234
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,910
they damage the legs.

235
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,210
They're easy.

236
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:06,180
O made about fifty prints
of Jacqueline,

237
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,600
nothing like
what she'd done before.

238
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,360
In her body and face,

239
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,230
she found a special charm.

240
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,830
René, darling.

241
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,960
I'm going for a little while.

242
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,080
Be ready in an hour.

243
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,040
A car will call.

244
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,170
Dress in black.

245
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,970
Wear your fur.

246
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,590
It's so old!

247
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,640
It looks good.

248
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,140
Don't be silly!

249
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,310
Good enough for a funeral.

250
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,060
Please,
it's important to me.

251
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,940
Fine.

252
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,860
You're beautiful.

253
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,490
My love, Sir Stephen.

254
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,870
René didn't lie.

255
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,670
Martini, please.

256
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,260
That's what you want, isn't it?

257
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,840
Sit down.

258
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,810
If you want,
we'll dine in the cellar.

259
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,190
It's nicer there.

260
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,480
We'll have coffee in my house.

261
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,820
The couch is yours.

262
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,740
René will serve the coffee.

263
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,670
Now listen carefully.

264
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,260
René may have told you
about his family.

265
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,010
Before he was born,

266
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,060
I was a son to his mother.

267
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,220
Then she left my father.

268
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,020
So René and I are in no way related.

269
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,440
But somehow, we're brothers.

270
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,320
We've always shared everything.

271
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,030
By the ring you're wearing,
I have some rights over you

272
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,620
as do other men who know it.

273
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:15,290
But they'd only have quick affairs.

274
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,420
With me,
you'll have something more serious.

275
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,760
If you accept it,
I'll tell you his preferences.

276
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,260
My demands!

277
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,050
I'm yours,
I'll do as you say.

278
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,560
No, you belong to us both.
Say this:

279
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:37,400
"I belong to you both
and I'll do what you desire."

280
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,440
I want to hear you say
you'll be as mine

281
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,860
as you're René's.

282
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,870
But you'll only have one master,

283
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,740
a demanding one,
because I have a certain taste

284
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,500
for habits and rites.

285
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,760
Out the two of you!

286
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,300
No...

287
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:10,760
I accept it.

288
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,140
Will I be whipped?

289
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,730
Yes, a few times.

290
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,000
They examined her body

291
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:44,050
in a brutal and abominable way.

292
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,800
She was covered in shame.

293
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:51,760
But despite the shame,
she felt like someone

294
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:56,350
going into a familiar dream
that's about to start.

295
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,860
Stay with Sir Stephen.
Don't move.

296
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,650
He'll dismiss you at his leisure.

297
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,200
I'll see you out.

298
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,280
Thank you, René.
You want the car?

299
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,870
You want the dream to end

300
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,910
for fear
that you might not bear it.

301
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,960
Yet you want to know how it ends.

302
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,590
Sit down.

303
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,890
- A cigarette?
- No.

304
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,150
I want to see you naked.

305
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,530
Undo your blouse.

306
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,570
I don't like your make-up.

307
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,690
The colour is too pale.

308
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,240
Take off your skirt.

309
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,590
You're an easy girl.

310
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,100
Does René know you desire
every man who wants you?

311
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,060
It's an alibi, this obedience.

312
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,560
No, I love René!

313
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:07,770
Yes, but you're easy.
Don't move!

314
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,580
Masturbate.

315
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,210
You understood.

316
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,880
Caress yourself.

317
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,260
No, I can't!

318
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,600
Is that obedience?

319
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,270
René wasn't stern enough.

320
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,940
I always obey him.

321
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,400
You're mistaking love
with obedience.

322
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,070
You must obey me without loving me

323
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,950
and without me loving you.

324
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,860
My room is next door.

325
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:37,610
Wait.

326
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,820
It's yours.

327
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:43,330
Keep it. Iron suits you
like your ring.

328
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,290
Should I say irons?

329
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,460
Please,

330
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:52,670
don't tell René I disobeyed.
I swear I'll obey.

331
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:13,810
Good morning.

332
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,370
A driver will take you.

333
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,210
A message from master.

334
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:43,970
René said he would pick you up
at the studio.

335
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,970
This is for your next visit.

336
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,000
I have it.

337
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,640
That's good,
you look dangerous.

338
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,690
To whom?

339
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,230
"To Sir Stephen".

340
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,030
But she was afraid.

341
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,530
She was afraid of his words to René.
Why didn't René come?

342
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:33,330
If Sir Stephen didn't love her,
René would stop loving her.

343
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,210
You've seen Sir Stephen?

344
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,170
Yes.

345
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:48,590
Look!

346
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,140
He gave it?

347
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,560
Really?

348
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,520
Great!
I'm proud of you!

349
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,440
I feel the same.

350
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,530
Have you done my prints?

351
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,450
No, I haven't had the time.

352
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,740
Oh well, I'm off...

353
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:09,780
Stay.

354
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,410
Don't go.

355
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,460
Jacqueline came often.

356
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,750
This pleased René,
who found her attractive

357
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,040
and wanted to seduce her.

358
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:25,420
O might have been jealous,

359
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,970
but something else worried her:

360
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,050
The grip Sir Stephen had on René.

361
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,510
Don't be angry.

362
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,430
I'm not.

363
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,520
I hardly see you!

364
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,110
You don't touch me!

365
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,570
When you do,

366
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,650
it's to find marks on me.

367
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,030
You're in love with him, not me.

368
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:49,950
Nonsense!

369
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,740
Had I said that two months ago,
you'd have slapped me

370
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,200
so hard the walls
would have shaken.

371
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,630
But I'm yours!
Yours!

372
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:05,250
Sir Stephen's first!

373
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,130
- Listen.
- No.

374
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,390
I know.

375
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:17,850
Phone him,
tell him I can't come tonight.

376
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,850
Invent anything.

377
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,020
Tonight I'm yours.

378
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,940
It's impossible.

379
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,410
I shall tell him your words.

380
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,700
Good night.

381
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,830
She didn't believe he would do it.

382
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,250
But they went. He stayed
only long enough to tell him.

383
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,790
Goodbye.

384
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,250
Thank you.

385
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:51,340
He was as pale as she.

386
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:55,010
O thought he was in love with her.

387
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:03,150
He'd never kissed her.

388
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,490
But he punished her himself
that night.

389
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:18,540
He was so cruel,
she lost consciousness.

390
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,920
- Is that you?
- Of course.

391
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:10,630
Something's happened,
I can't decide alone.

392
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,970
I've met Pierre from Roissy.

393
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:18,100
- Does he want you?
- Yes, now in a hotel.

394
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:21,640
Do you want to go?

395
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,560
Yes, I do.

396
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,230
Go back to your flat.

397
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,150
Not come to you?

398
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,230
I want you to obey me.

399
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,760
Is that you, René?

400
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,060
René gave me a key.

401
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,350
I see you obeyed me.

402
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,940
You're a big girl.

403
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,860
We'll go out.

404
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,280
But first, answer my questions.

405
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,420
Since your return,

406
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,670
have you known other men?

407
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,760
Desired others?
Besides Pierre, of course.

408
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,430
A girl, maybe?

409
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,390
That's it, isn't it?

410
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:46,810
Wait.

411
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,280
Is it the Jacqueline
René told me of?

412
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,420
You desire her...

413
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,750
Jacqueline has a great life.

414
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,960
Sir Stephen made her talk
about Jacqueline.

415
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,000
But was he listening?

416
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,800
She liked to feel that he was aware

417
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:04,180
of her voice,
of her moving lips.

418
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,160
René knows what I shall say now.

419
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,620
Remember the first time you came,

420
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,830
I gave you an order
you didn't obey.

421
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:34,130
Will you obey it now?

422
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:37,000
Yes, whenever you wish.

423
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,090
Drink up.

424
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,440
I've seen no one, not even René,

425
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,190
take you.

426
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,440
It doesn't mean

427
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:02,110
that you'll never give yourself
to a stranger

428
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,860
in front of him who loves you.

429
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,950
He insisted for a long time,

430
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,330
but she wasn't listening.
She heard only

431
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,750
"him who loves you".
She needed no more proof.

432
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,590
You're not listening to me.

433
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,890
I'll do anything you want.
I'm yours.

434
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:26,970
Mine?
n e A i o n

435
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,560
Yours and René's.

436
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,390
René and I have agreed
you can be mine only.

437
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:36,650
If you agree,
I want more than words.

438
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,400
If you're only mine,
you must be marked.

439
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,440
- Marked?
- Permanently.

440
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,860
Finish your coffee.

441
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,410
You're not forced to do anything.

442
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,160
You can always refuse

443
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,250
and go.

444
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,630
I'll give you a few days.

445
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,460
Time to take Jacqueline.

446
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,220
Jacqueline, mine?

447
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,600
I could say,

448
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,100
I'd like to see you with a woman.

449
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
That is not the case.

450
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:22,110
She must be yours to go to Roissy.

451
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,860
It's not possible!

452
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,280
It is.

453
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:30,240
It's not possible.

454
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,870
I won't owe René anything.

455
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:36,620
When she returns, she'll be his.

456
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:38,000
René's?

457
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,510
He loves her?

458
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,090
He said that?

459
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,260
He wants her.
She doesn't.

460
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:59,230
So first, persuade her
to share your flat.

461
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:37,810
There's another wardrobe for you.

462
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,640
Make yourself at home.

463
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,320
René doesn't mind?

464
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,940
No, he's happy about it.

465
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:00,920
She accepted my room.

466
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,830
That's nothing.

467
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,290
Sir Stephen was right.

468
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:08,050
She'll give in to you.

469
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:13,550
Good night.

470
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,550
Come here.

471
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,810
Sit down, don't be afraid.

472
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:28,230
René won't be back?

473
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,940
Not tonight.

474
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,990
Strange hairdo!

475
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,330
Take that off, it's better.

476
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,910
Beautiful.

477
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:16,780
Tell me you want it.

478
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,620
Yes.

479
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:24,080
It went well, I'll tell you.

480
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,170
Yes.

481
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,470
Now?
Straightaway.

482
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:39,600
- Was it René?
- No, it wasn't.

483
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:42,730
- Are you happy because of me?
- No...

484
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:46,980
Well, yes.
Because of you.

485
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,480
Now go, you're late.

486
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:52,190
You don't kiss me?

487
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:56,490
No.

488
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:58,910
See you tonight.

489
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,910
When O came to this house,

490
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,960
she was first prepared by Norah.

491
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:12,630
O never got used to undressing
in front of this woman,

492
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,630
who never spoke to her.

493
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:19,640
Now she was taken straight
to Sir Stephen,

494
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:22,430
in an unknown room.

495
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,150
It's done!

496
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:32,650
I knew you would manage.

497
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,650
Take that off.

498
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,740
- Shall I tell you?
- No, I will.

499
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:44,870
Stop me if I'm wrong.

500
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,500
You're beautiful.

501
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,590
As for Jacqueline,

502
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,220
- you undress her.
- Yes.

503
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:58,970
Take off her belt.

504
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,970
You look at her in the eyes
and talk.

505
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,390
He was right.

506
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,230
Only through prints,
he knew Jacqueline

507
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,440
liked pleasure

508
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:16,740
and would give herself freely
to O, as she was a woman.

509
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:01,240
Roses... for me?

510
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:04,080
Why not?
I love you.

511
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:10,500
Norah!

512
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:16,170
There!
They're yours.

513
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,020
You told me of a mark.

514
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,730
- You accept it?
- Absolutely.

515
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,190
When?

516
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,120
She'll be marked shortly.

517
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:54,460
I assume you'll be there.

518
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:56,500
Yes.

519
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,210
Come and see the house.

520
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:04,590
This is your room.
Do you like it?

521
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,010
Very much.

522
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:14,480
Get undressed.

523
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,950
I'll give you a corset.

524
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,410
Very tight.
We'll tighten it daily.

525
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:28,450
Your waist will be slim.

526
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,300
Kneel down.

527
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,560
Do you willingly accept

528
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:42,140
to wear Sir Stephen's
rings and signs,

529
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:45,310
unaware of how they come?

530
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:47,360
Yes, I do.

531
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:53,240
I'll accompany him.
Stay here.

532
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,670
You're really mine.

533
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,510
Your companions.

534
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,590
Yvonne, Claire,

535
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,680
- Andrée...
- I know her.

536
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:18,850
And Thérese.

537
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,930
I know her too, from school.

538
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,060
Be quiet, Thérese.

539
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,110
Yvonne,

540
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:33,990
put the corset on her.

541
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:37,990
- Please, help.
- Sure.

542
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,240
- Glad to see you.
- Me too.

543
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,880
Very tight.

544
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:54,630
You'll be prettier.

545
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:58,890
Come here.

546
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:04,100
When were you whipped?

547
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,350
Two or three weeks ago.

548
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,400
We don't whip here.

549
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,650
Except tonight.

550
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:13,610
Because of your arrival.

551
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:19,240
O found in Anne-Marie's house

552
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:23,620
tense attitudes,
straight out of childhood.

553
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,540
I hate losing.

554
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,540
Check mate in two moves!

555
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:32,130
- I'm not playing.
- Well?

556
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,300
Cheat!

557
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:34,800
That's not true!

558
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:36,840
Dirty liar!

559
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,350
Come behind me.
Not you, O.

560
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:45,520
Who'll whip you?
We'll draw lots.

561
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,520
Are you ready?

562
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,570
Let's do it.

563
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:58,570
Who has the queen?

564
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:08,210
Was it planned?

565
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,590
I never arrange things.
You know that.

566
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,090
Take her away, she's yours.

567
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,790
You can scream,
no one will hear.

568
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:59,720
And if you shout too loud...

569
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:08,020
Go on, Yvonne.

570
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,360
Faster, harder!
She must scream!

571
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:46,260
She understood
that her attachment to René,

572
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:49,350
her days at the castle,
her hardships,

573
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,600
were the surest way to take her
to him she loved.

574
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,360
Thinking?

575
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,770
Of him.

576
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:01,440
If she was strong enough

577
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:04,490
to take everything,

578
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,910
she would manage to conquer him.

579
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,630
Andrée's lover brought her here.

580
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,720
Maybe he won't come back.

581
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,760
Why is that?

582
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:26,890
You're not strong enough,
you'll leave.

583
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,640
- Who brought you?
- Anne-Marie.

584
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:36,560
- You belong to no one?
- She does.

585
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:39,860
She belongs to me.

586
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,990
But Thérese wasn't the only one
who slept

587
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,120
with Anne-Marie.

588
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,620
As for everything else,
fate decided.

589
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:52,450
Anne-Marie!

590
01:13:57,210 --> 01:14:00,050
What are you doing?
You're mad!

591
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:03,590
No, don't!
I don't want you to!

592
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,430
You're silly.
N e a i o n

593
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,930
I don't care!

594
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,640
I want to die, you hear?

595
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,270
Poor little thing.

596
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,860
Punish me.
I don't care.

597
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,660
Go to your room.
You too.

598
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,880
Come, my love.

599
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:59,350
Claire will show you something.

600
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:04,990
- Show her, Claire.
- Sure.

601
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:13,620
Sir Stephen wants you

602
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:16,160
to carry the same rings.

603
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:23,500
Once they're on,
they can't come off.

604
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:24,630
Painful?

605
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:27,630
No more than an earlobe.

606
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,050
But for you there will be more.

607
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:34,760
A ring could be filed off.

608
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:41,520
That's why Sir Stephen
wants you marked otherwise.

609
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,820
Forever.

610
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,360
How?

611
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,860
You promised not to ask.

612
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,860
I'll tell you in time.

613
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,710
Today it's your turn.

614
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:02,960
Pick it up.

615
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:07,630
We haven't drawn lots.

616
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,050
I want you to do it.

617
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,430
Obey me.

618
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,060
No, I can't.

619
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:21,270
Think of what she did to you.

620
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,320
You must learn.

621
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:29,690
Sir Stephen told me of Jacqueline.

622
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,700
You'll have to hit her.

623
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:35,990
Go on.

624
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,590
Don't cheat.
All your strength.

625
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:50,510
Come on!

626
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:56,890
Harder!

627
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:19,370
Enough!

628
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:29,300
Forgive me.

629
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:35,220
Forgive me, please.

630
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:16,510
No.

631
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:31,320
- Asleep?
- Yes.

632
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:32,860
She loves you?

633
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,320
I know she does.

634
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:45,290
What have you done to each other?

635
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:48,000
I want to know!

636
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:52,340
I don't care.

637
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:56,550
You know what?
You'll be branded.

638
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:02,640
Sir Stephen's here.

639
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:05,350
Coming.

640
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,070
I may not see you again.

641
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,320
You want to bet?

642
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,400
Sure.

643
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:37,050
You can still refuse.

644
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:38,760
No.

645
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:41,470
- Shall I tie you?
- No.

646
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:26,390
Don't touch me.
I want to leave!

647
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,770
I can't take it!

648
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,690
- I want to go!
- Fine.

649
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:36,570
Sir Stephen's driver
will take you to Paris.

650
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:26,280
There, he'd said he loved her

651
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:30,290
and would give her to others
who wouldn't love her.

652
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:33,750
Would he do it?
And if so, why?

653
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:36,330
Careful.

654
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:39,380
Thank you.

655
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:40,590
Thank you very much.

656
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,970
Better without your hat.

657
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:50,850
Wait.

658
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:54,270
It's yours.

659
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:59,320
- Nice daughter.
- He's right.

660
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:04,150
Will you be my daughter?

661
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,780
I'll be everything.

662
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,220
Give me my gown, please.

663
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,010
Rings?

664
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,930
First time you notice something

665
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,480
outside yourself.

666
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:37,060
Why wear them?

667
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,940
- You want to know?
- Yes.

668
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:42,900
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

669
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:46,610
Now I'm Sir Stephen's.

670
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,410
I love him.

671
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:51,160
It's incredible!

672
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,210
You're telling me your dreams.

673
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,710
Sir Stephen,

674
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:01,500
René,

675
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,050
Anne-Marie!

676
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,510
Me.

677
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,430
Impossible!

678
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:19,440
There's one character
I don't like at all.

679
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:21,650
Thérese.

680
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:25,820
You invented her?

681
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,780
I invented nothing.

682
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,620
What if I want to go to Roissy?

683
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:34,790
For me?

684
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:39,000
I'd like to see it,
just out of curiosity.

685
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:41,590
But I wouldn't be touched.

686
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:43,590
A tourist?

687
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:48,840
I'll even sleep with René
if you want.

688
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:52,760
If you want.

689
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:56,890
Not yet.

690
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:20,920
When you come to Brittany,
I'll give a party.

691
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,170
O can be queen.

692
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,960
Fine.

693
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:31,340
Get up.

694
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,130
Turn around.

695
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,110
The mark!
It's nice.

696
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:29,230
Look, lvan.

697
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:31,950
I can see it.

698
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,450
Take that away.

699
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:52,840
You're going?

700
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:54,720
I must.

701
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:12,110
Ivan took O to his hotel
until the evening.

702
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,530
O's obedience

703
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:58,490
and the marks on her body
moved him.

704
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:02,790
But to receive from her
so willingly

705
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:06,290
what he had not yet asked
of any woman!

706
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,900
- Master's outside.
- Thank you.

707
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:27,910
What's the matter?

708
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:31,120
I must explain.

709
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,210
It goes far back.

710
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:39,220
I swore no woman
would ever mean to me

711
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:42,300
more than a stone
picked up on a beach.

712
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:48,680
But you, my love,
as far as I go, you come along.

713
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:54,730
It's true.
I thought I knew love before you.

714
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:59,240
You can try me as you like.

715
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:03,700
Why are you so grave?

716
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:07,910
Lvan is madly in love with you.

717
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:11,920
He begged me to give you freedom.

718
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,670
He wants to marry you,
to rescue you.

719
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:22,380
I treat you my way,
because you're mine.

720
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:26,600
As long as you're mine,
you must obey.

721
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:30,810
But you remain free
to choose and go.

722
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,860
I told lvan that.
He'll drop by later.

723
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,690
You're both completely mad.

724
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:45,160
If lvan hadn't come,
what would you have done with me?

725
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,080
Come.

726
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:03,300
It's like Anne-Marie's!

727
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:07,100
We're always childish

728
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,390
about what we really like.

729
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:16,350
It's perfect!
When was it done?

730
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:17,980
After your return.

731
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:24,700
I couldn't show it
before I gave you to someone else.

732
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:28,530
To punish you in advance.

733
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:36,920
But that's what you must do
about lvan.

734
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:40,920
Punish me.

735
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,720
Call Norah and leave us alone.

736
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:45,930
Norah!

737
01:30:58,730 --> 01:31:00,230
Sir Stephen, please.

738
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:03,440
On the first floor.

739
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:11,260
Sir Stephen took O

740
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:13,350
to Brittany for a holiday,

741
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,970
with Jacqueline and René.

742
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:18,310
Jacqueline, hurry up.

743
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,640
Coming.

744
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:38,580
How nice!
The sea, the colours... and you.

745
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,460
What are you thinking about?

746
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:44,880
Would you like to be a pebble?

747
01:32:45,090 --> 01:32:46,960
I would, if you found me.

748
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,300
I'd always be in your pocket.

749
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:02,810
I can't believe it!

750
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:06,020
- What?
- I've lost a bet.

751
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:07,030
Thérese!

752
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:23,960
I'm glad to see you!

753
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:25,500
You're beautiful!

754
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:31,630
Thank you.

755
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:33,640
One...

756
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:37,510
- and a half.
- You remember that?

757
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:40,060
I remember it all.

758
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:43,850
And Anne-Marie?

759
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:47,150
She lent me to one of her friends,
a captain.

760
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:50,900
He has a yacht.
Will you come?

761
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:54,570
He's very kind.
He taught me to cast a line.

762
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:56,280
Can you cast a line?

763
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:57,990
I'll teach you.

764
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,580
You put the little fish
on the hook.

765
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:05,670
Then you lean foward and wait.

766
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:09,630
When you feel it moving,

767
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:11,800
you start the fight.

768
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:18,310
You push and pull,
it pulls forward.

769
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:21,810
When you feel it's there,
you pull it back.

770
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:29,730
Your legs are crossed!

771
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:33,650
It's not your business!

772
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:39,030
It's Sir Stephen's and others'.

773
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,950
It was to avoid you being whipped.

774
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:46,460
Some tea?

775
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,630
Where was I?

776
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:58,260
Do you catch big fish?

777
01:34:58,470 --> 01:35:00,810
Yes, enormous fish...
That big.

778
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,230
Valient little soldier.

779
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,400
- Slept with her?
- Not yet.

780
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:15,860
What?

781
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:18,450
I said not yet!

782
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,380
At last, you're late!

783
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:31,590
Sir Stephen is waiting.

784
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,460
He won't be happy
to learn a few things.

785
01:35:35,050 --> 01:35:36,420
Like what?

786
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:39,180
That she's not so obedient

787
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:42,010
when she's alone.
She crosses her legs.

788
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:45,230
She even talks to men.

789
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:46,810
- It's not true!
- Yes, it is.

790
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:47,940
It's not true!

791
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:50,860
She was with the Captain
all afternoon.

792
01:35:53,730 --> 01:35:56,070
Stop it!
Leave them, René.

793
01:35:58,030 --> 01:35:59,160
Come here, O.

794
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:03,370
I swear it's not true!

795
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:15,050
I know it's not.

796
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:18,800
The Captain is here.

797
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:20,050
Good afternoon,

798
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:24,760
I'm very happy to see you again.
It may be emotion,

799
01:36:24,970 --> 01:36:26,470
but you're ravishing.

800
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:29,690
The Captain is giving a party
this evening.

801
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:32,360
He has some things for you.

802
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:47,410
In Bali, it's quite different.

803
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:49,710
If you're not used to it...

804
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,170
Did you stay there long?

805
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:54,170
You ought to go there.

806
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:56,840
You must have met lots of people.

807
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:59,260
Yes, mostly during cruises.

808
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:03,180
O saw René desired
Jacqueline madly.

809
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,220
He was paralyzed by love.

810
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:22,450
Seeing him like that,
whom she knew so well,

811
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:26,080
O was not jealous or sad.
She felt mad

812
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,160
at Jacqueline.

813
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:48,220
O can persuade her
to give herself to you.

814
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,390
But you'd only have her
a night or two.

815
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,520
It wouldn't mean much.

816
01:37:52,730 --> 01:37:56,150
Jacqueline must go to Roissy.

817
01:37:56,690 --> 01:37:58,570
If she refuses?

818
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:01,240
You've always trusted me, René.

819
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,780
She'll be yours
as O became mine.

820
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,410
I've decided it that way.

821
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:09,540
You owe me nothing.

822
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:13,250
More than you think,
I love her.

823
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:15,210
It's thanks to you.

824
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,590
I owe you more each day.

825
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,640
Come.
What do you want?

826
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:36,810
I apologize.

827
01:38:41,230 --> 01:38:43,610
I was jealous, unhappy.

828
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:48,410
I can't bear it
when you don't look at me.

829
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:55,370
I'll do what you want!

830
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:57,540
Or I'll kill myself!

831
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:02,460
I'll be like Thérese.

832
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:05,010
Teach me, O.

833
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,930
Thérese learnt it in Roissy,
for the love of another.

834
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:14,270
I'll go to Roissy.

835
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:16,350
Take me there.

836
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:21,610
Having done what Sir Stephen
had ordered,

837
01:39:22,030 --> 01:39:26,530
O chose her mask,
thinking herself a bird of prey,

838
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:31,740
naturally trained
to retrieve game.

839
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:42,380
I regret it, O.
I'd like to cancel it.

840
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:44,550
But the Captain

841
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,630
would never forgive me.

842
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,090
Don't regret it.

843
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:52,470
Every one knows I'm yours.

844
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:55,180
You know how I feel?

845
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:57,600
Extremely proud!

846
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:46,500
Was she made of stone or wax?

847
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:49,170
Or was she out of this world?

848
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:53,930
Sir Stephen admired
her insolent nudity

849
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:58,060
and her immense power.

850
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:05,770
A few days later,
Jacqueline went to Roissy.

851
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:06,940
And you?

852
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:09,150
I'll be here.
Go.

853
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,170
A few days later,
I took Jacqueline to Roissy.

854
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:28,670
"And you?"

855
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:32,260
"I'll be here. Go."

856
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:33,590
And she went?

857
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:34,800
Yes.

858
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:42,140
I love you.

859
01:42:54,650 --> 01:42:56,200
Why are you smiling?

860
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,370
You say you love me.

861
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:04,370
But if I asked you

862
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:10,210
to take one of the ordeals
I went through, would you accept?

863
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:14,590
I think so, yes.

864
