Women in Darfur, you know, walk

all the water, have to go

stay at that condo.

Yeah I do.

167
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,839
You can't even see the
ocean from that condo.

168
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,799
Why would we stay there?

169
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,119
Jesus, Rachel, put on some clothes.

button, I'm gonna

172
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,319
shoot you in the face.

what Logan likes for dinner?

Uh, no.

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,319

have any of that frozen soy

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,839
I can't tell with y'all nowadays.

182
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,519
You know?

183
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,439
Yes please.

of him growing up.

sweatshirt and

306
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,479
had these crazy sideburns.

307
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,359
My mom told me that he had a
genius IQ, so that's why she

308
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,559
picked him, because
it was good genes.

really drunk and she told me

310
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,519
that was actually just a random
photo and she had no

God!

374
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,679
You dumb bitch!

375
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,479
Did you get your stuff?

376
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,479
Yeah.

377
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,079
Sir.

378
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,519
Sir, excuse me.

379
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,279
Dumb bitch.

380
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,119
Dumb bitch.

381
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,239
With all due respect, if the
car had tickets on it, and

382
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,959
it's your car, then I feel
you're the responsible one.

383
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,559
Who the fuck are you?

384
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,439
Hey.

385
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,919
That's my aunt Sophia.

386
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,599
So be cool, man.

387
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,319
OK?

388
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,359
What the fuck are you gonna
do with all your shit?

389
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,959
OK.

390
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,479
OK, OK.

391
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,679
Just walk away.

392
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,119
We get it.
We get it.

393
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,260
WALTER: Don't fucking move.

394
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,719
So.

395
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,599
So you just put your stuff, um...

396
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,599
This is where you're going
to be staying.

397
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,359
First floor there's
a bed where we...

398
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,279
Wow, Rachel.

399
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,639
RACHEL: Used to be
the maid's room, but we don't

400
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,439
have...

401
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,039
This is awesome.

402
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,919
RACHEL: Yeah, welcome, welcome.

403
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,719
Make yourself at home.

404
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,639
Oh, wow.

405
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,599
Hey.

406
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,479
Who is this guy?

407
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,359
Hey, buddy.

408
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,639
That's Bonnet.

409
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,399
Hi cutie fruity patootie.

410
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,079
That is the best name
ever for a pup.

411
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,039
Let me show you...

412
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,319
Let me show you your digs.

413
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,479
Oh man.

414
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,359
OK.

415
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,799
Let me put your...

416
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,439
Let's get some fresh
air in this room!

417
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,879
Oh.

418
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,599
Sorry.

419
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,599
Yeah, this used to be
our live in's room.

420
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,279
Her name was Luce.

421
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,999
I know it's stupid to think that
we'd need a housekeeper.

422
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,159
I don't even have a job.

423
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,119
But, you know, she was a godsend.

424
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,279
Because when I got pregnant
with Logan, you know, I

425
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,599
thought, I'm not gonna
have a baby nurse.

426
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,839
I'm not gonna need any of that.

427
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,279
You know, I'm gonna-
I'm a mother.

428
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,319
I...

429
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,239
My body is built for this.

430
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,839
And then came home, milk
didn't come in.

431
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,759
Tried and tried to nurse,
couldn't latch on.

432
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,759
Apparently my nipples are too small.

433
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,959
So, he wouldn't stop crying for
anybody except for Luce.

434
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,639
And she's just so calm
that she just...

435
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,279
Ugh.

436
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,199
When Logan got into school, we
had to let her go, you know?

437
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,599
And then we maybe thought for
a minute we were gonna have,

438
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,759
another kid, and then we... or it
was gonna be an office for

439
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,599
me, or...

440
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,119
I like this color.

441
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,679
This room would look really
good in this color.

442
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,559
Do you ice skate?

443
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,239
Oh, these?

444
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,999
Yeah.

445
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,879
Well, you know.

446
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,279
For a hot New York minute.

447
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,839
Got my...

448
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,479
My skate on.

449
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,799
My mom always told me that I
should surround myself with

450
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,664
good people if I want good
things to happen.

451
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,679
I'm 55 days sober, so good
people are really important.

452
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,719
Oh my god.

453
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,759
McKenna, that's amazing.

454
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,839
Congratulations.

455
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,079
Wow.

456
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,799
My mom's a witch.

457
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,709
The Wiccan kind of witch, you know?

458
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,387
Sometimes I think I
might be one too.

459
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,279
Is that my bathroom?

460
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,919
Yeah.

461
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,759
D-d...

462
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,359
Do you need clean towels?

463
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,586
We have company.

464
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,639
Go, go, go, go, go.

465
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,759
I'm listening.

466
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,439
We have company.

467
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,679
Who's here?

468
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,239
Have you ever heard of the
Espresso Yourself truck?

469
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,079
Nope.

470
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,079
The coffee they make, Jeff,
is like you cannot believe.

471
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,479
You know when people just
make one thing right?

472
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,239
I get it.

473
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,759
It's great.

474
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,239
It's obsession worthy.

475
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,959
OK.

476
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,319
So, I started...

477
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,359
I started to follow the
truck on Twitter.

478
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,839
I thought you hated Twitter.

479
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,679
I don't hate Twitter, Jeff.

480
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,906
I'm not...

481
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,679
I lurk on Twitter.

482
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,519
You're a lurker.

483
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,079
Just not a Tweeter.

484
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,879
So, a few weeks ago, the truck
was parked right across the

485
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,199
street from Sam's.

486
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,879
Wait, let me get you...

487
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,439
Let me get you some...

488
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,359
Sam who?

489
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,679
Uh, Hofbrau.

490
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,999
Sam's Hofbrau.

491
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,999
That was the strip bar, or like,
you know, topless place

492
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,159
or whatever that we went to.

493
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,719
Oh, you need cutlery.

494
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,719
Anyway...

495
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,879
who would've thunk it...
ran into McKenna.

496
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,759
I don't know who McKenna is.

497
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,919
Oh, she, um...

498
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,639
She's the dancer that...

499
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,759
She's the dancer that gave me
that private thingy when we

500
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,639
were there.

501
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,919
You mean the stripper?

502
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,079
OK, sure.

503
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,839
The stripper, is in the maid's room.

504
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,439
The stripper's in the maid's room.

505
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,159
Yeah.

506
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,879
How did the stripper get
in the maid's room?

507
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,719
I put her there.

508
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,479
So, I kept going back to the
Espresso Yourself truck, and

509
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,719
every time I would go there, I
kept running into McKenna.

510
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,119
So we just started talking.

511
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,799
Anyway, she was, like, between
apartments, her car was

512
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,319
getting towed.

513
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,599
She had nowhere to stay tonight,
and you know all the

514
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,799
work that I do for the homeless
at the J, and, you

515
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,359
know, I thought, here's...

516
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,359
OK, Here's actual homelessness
right in front of me.

517
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,639
So you invited her to
stay here in our

518
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,839
house with our child?

519
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,759
Just for like a... two nights.

520
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,719
Like, one night maybe.

521
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,239
You won't even notice
she's here, Jeff.

522
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,479
JEFF: (WHISPERING) I don't wanna

523
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,199
meet her right now.

524
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,439
I think we should just...

525
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,951
Shut up.

526
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,879
Just a few days.

527
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,823
OK, we gotta keep quiet.

528
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,550
I love you.

529
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,839
Morning.

530
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,199
Uh, hey.

531
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,919
Hey.

532
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,319
I remember you.

533
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,559
You guys were, like, the
cutest couple ever.

534
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,799
Oh, thank you.

535
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,959
We work at it.

536
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,519
Actually, we don't.

537
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,439
Comes pretty naturally.

538
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,679
Do you want some coffee?

539
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,679
Um, do you have tea?

540
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,191
Yeah.

541
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,159
Oh, wow, look at this, a tea box.

542
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,679
Yeah.

543
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,319
We're sort of... sort of
hooked up that way.

544
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,679
Yeah.

545
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,479
I'll take a chai spice.

546
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,199
Good choice.

547
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,599
Yeah, why not?

548
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,599
I have to say, that was, like,
the best sleep I've had in

549
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,799
five years.

550
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,679
Not joking.

551
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,119
Hollywood is so noisy.

552
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,919
Yeah, sometimes I find the
birds in this neighborhood can

553
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,879
be rather cacophonous.

554
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,507
You know, loud and chirpy.

555
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,759
Rachel told me that you invent apps.

556
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,559
She wasn't lying.

557
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,919
That's what I do.

558
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,559
MCKENNA: I love apps.

559
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,599
Really?

560
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:53,839
MCKENNA:
Yeah.

561
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,919
Yeah?

562
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,959
You like your job?

563
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,319
Um, I used to.

564
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,639
I recently sold the, or
got bought, merged.

565
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,559
There are any number of ways to
describe what actually went

566
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,319
down with Happy Farm.

567
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,279
Logan, hey

568
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,159
Hey.

569
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,439
Buddy, this is McKenna.

570
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,159
She's, um, uh, a friend
of your mom's.

571
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,239
Yeah.

572
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,439
I've heard a lot about you.

573
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,462
Yeah?

574
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,359
I love your monkey backpack.

575
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,399
It's awesome.

576
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,839
I asked for an elephant.

577
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,719
Well, talk to your mom.

578
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,239
I did.

579
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,239
We're gonna get you hooked up
with breakfast real quick, Mr.

580
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,679
Man, because we are running
a little late.

581
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,719
OK.

582
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,719
RACHEL: Hey.

583
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,999
Hi.

584
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,919
RACHEL: Uh, good morning.

585
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,799
Logan, you met my friend McKenna?

586
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,479
Yeah.

587
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,279
Jeff, McKenna.

588
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,919
McKenna, Jeff.

589
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,520
You got it.

590
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,199
Great.

591
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,999
OK.

592
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,719
How did you...

593
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,719
How did you sleep?

594
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,919
Really, really good.

595
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,079
Oh good.

596
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,439
Oh good, you...

597
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,359
Good.

598
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,599
Quiet in here.

599
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,879
Yeah.

600
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,159
So, um, uh, you can take
Logan to school today?

601
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,079
Jeff, I just want to make
sure that McKenna is...

602
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,519
Got it, I am on it.

603
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,599
Taken care of.

604
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,599
Thank you.

605
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,079
OK, great.

606
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,679
You need milk.

607
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,959
OK.

608
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,479
OK, she looks like a completely
different person,

609
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,079
Fight?

610
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,199
I know.

611
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,999
She looks like a college
kid or something.

612
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,879
Right?

613
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,079
Dancing is just her job.

614
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,959
A job does not define who you are.

615
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,119
Right.

616
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,959
I really think I can help her.

617
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,999
She had a really difficult life.

618
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,959
Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy.

619
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,519
OK, all right.

620
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,599
I'm shaking it out.

621
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,900
There's a stripper in my pool.

622
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,039
No big, OK.

623
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,999
OK.

624
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,799
Oh, that's a nice looking one.

625
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,679
Yeah, is that OK?

626
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,359
What do strippers like?

627
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,479
I don't know.

628
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,919
Not that, because she's sober.

629
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,639
Oh.

630
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,839
Good for her.

631
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,544
Imagine that you're
cleaning out a rim.

632
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,640
OK?

633
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:37,999
Cleaning out a rim.

634
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,079
It's a big rim.

635
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,919
It's more like a trash can size.

636
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,919
OK.

637
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,919
Oh, like a garbage can rim.

638
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,959
Her shame is trapped there.

639
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,188
We gotta get that exercised.

640
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,239
Be gentle with it.

641
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,039
Shame.

642
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,839
Stephanie!

643
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,519
I really got this.

644
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,039
Stephanie!

645
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,039
You're waking up in the morning.

646
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,039
Should we give her a pole?

647
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,039
You want...

648
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,039
Oh shit.

649
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,559
Yeah.

650
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,519
Body.

651
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,199
No, you guys.

652
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,039
Those are the guys that come
in and they're like, lap

653
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,879
dance, lap dance, lap
dance, every night.

654
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,759
And they always have their
favorite girls.

655
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,239
And they're the ones that tell
you things like, oh baby, I'm

656
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,999
gonna be the one that gets
to see you for real.

657
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,079
I'm gonna help get you
down off of this

658
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,119
pole, blah, blah, blah.

659
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,959
We call them Captain Save-a-Ho.

660
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,983
Captain Save-a-Ho, that's hilarious.

661
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,420
Yeah, I made $6,000 of one once.

662
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,199
Wait, 6,000 just for dancing?

663
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,639
Well, some girls dance
just to dance, right?

664
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,879
But I like to use the club for
networking, meeting people,

665
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,559
building relationships.

666
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,119
I'm not the kind of girl who's
gonna tell you that she'll

667
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,559
strip but she won't get naked,
or she'll give you a lap dance

668
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,039
but she won't touch you, or
she'll touch you, but she

669
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,999
won't give you oral.

670
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,679
I'm pretty much down for anything.

671
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,145
Full service sex worker.

672
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,239
Um, what...

673
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,319
What is a sex worker?

674
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,439
Is that stupid?

675
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,119
Oh, you need to have clients.

676
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,639
This one guy Warren, I mean,
he pays via Paypal.

677
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,599
It's awesome.

678
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,359
There's no cash exchange.

679
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,399
It's very clean.

680
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,879
And then there's this Jack, and
he's been my regular on

681
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,919
Tuesdays for like a million years.

682
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,510
I love him like a brother.

683
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,639
He's your kind of run
of the mill, typical

684
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,239
vanilla kinky guy.

685
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,359
He's into some weird shit.

686
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,639
Not really.

687
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,151
He sometimes likes a girl to watch.

688
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,599
You should come, Rachel.

689
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,079
Yes, you should.

690
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,399
You really should.

691
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,879
Tuesday?

692
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,039
I'll take Logan to soccer
so you can go.

693
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,959
Thank you, that would
be a huge help.

694
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,039
Sorry.

695
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,559
STEPHANIE: Fuck it.

696
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,300
I'm gonna ruing a
perfectly good blow out.

697
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,799
Hey Captain Save-a-Ho.

698
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,319
She's a hooker.

699
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,279
Sh, it's OK.

700
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,159
No, it's not OK.

701
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,119
Yeah it is.

702
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,519
Is that a nursing bra?

703
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,479
Oh, yeah.

704
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,439
Logan's five.

705
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,439
Throw it the fuck out.

706
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,519
You didn't know about
that part, right?

707
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,759
The friends I see sometimes?

708
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,079
You were right about that.

709
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,308
You still want me to
stay at the house?

710
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,279
If you want out of that
life, I can help you.

711
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,519
I mean, I've saved first
and last month's rent.

712
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,839
I could give that to you.

713
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,399
And I could help take care of Logan.

714
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,919
Exactly, but no money.

715
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,999
I'd feel weird taking
something from you.

716
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,559
If you think that I can help you, I

717
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,311
promise, you're not taking.

718
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,279
It's inappropriate.

719
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,159
Aren't you supposed to
be non-judgmental?

720
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,319
I'm supposed to be clear mirror,
baccarat crystal.

721
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,639
Excuse me, I have to eat something.

722
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,319
I was recently diagnosed with

723
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,707
perimenopausal low blood sugar.

724
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,749
I brought quinoa from home.

725
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:59,319
She just seems way too young
and, I don't know, healthy to

726
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,479
be spending her time having
sex for money.

727
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,359
Isn't that her choice?

728
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,239
May I share something?

729
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,199
When Portia was in
graduate school...

730
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,999
No, Lenore, I don't wanna
hear about Portia.

731
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,319
I think that's inappropriate.

732
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,999
OK.

733
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,399
I don't know why I wanna
take care of McKenna.

734
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,319
I mean, what if I listen to you
and I'm like, oh, Lenore

735
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,159
says it's inappropriate, so I
guess it's inappropriate.

736
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,199
So I go home and I'm like,
sorry, McKenna.

737
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,279
Turns out, this is inappropriate.

738
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,479
So, out she goes, back on the
street, robbed of her one

739
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,439
opportunity she had
to finally escape

740
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,799
from being a sex worker.

741
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,199
What's a sex worker?

742
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,999
That's what she calls it.

743
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,999
She's a prostitute.

744
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,759
That is such an awful word.

745
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,319
It's a highly accurate word, Rachel.

746
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,079
I think I need a break from therapy.

747
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,519
Well, I think that's ill advised.

748
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,679
Just last week, you were
complaining about how you and

749
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,279
Jeff are no longer making love.

750
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,799
Not fucking.

751
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,839
I mean, if you wanna
choose words, let's

752
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,559
just call it not fucking.

753
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,028
I think you should start
coming in twice a week.

754
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,399
Mwah.

755
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,879
Bye.

756
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,359
Oh, hey.

757
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,239
Hi ladies.

758
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,359
Uh, this is, uh...

759
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,719
This is McKenna.

760
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,439
This is, um, Amanda and Meredith.

761
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,319
Hi, nice to meet you.

762
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,439
Nice to meet you.

763
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,839
Bye.

764
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,799
Stephanie.

765
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,759
Oh, McKenna.

766
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,559
Oh my gosh.

767
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,359
You're still here.

768
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,039
Yeah.

769
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,079
Yeah, uh, um, I'm teaching her
about drop offs in case

770
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,359
she has to do a drop off.

771
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,479
OK.

772
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,399
Well, I'll see you guys soon.

773
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,467
OK, bye.

774
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,839
If it's a Monday, you wanna
bring his math stuff with

775
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,359
you...

776
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,759
Hey!

777
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,319
And if it's a Friday, you wanna...

778
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,079
Hi!

779
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,799
Wait, Rach.

780
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,919
Did you ever get my sign up
paper for Craftacular?

781
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,079
Oh.

782
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,799
Because I didn't see your name.

783
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,239
I'm so sorry.

784
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,159
Ugh.

785
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,839
I'm sorry, I forgot.

786
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,519
Hi.

787
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,719
Who's this?

788
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,585
Oh, uh, this is Logan's new nanny.

789
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,399
This is McKenna.

790
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,999
McKenna, this is Jennie.

791
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,359
Oh, nice to meet you.

792
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,439
Wow, you been thinking about
going back to work Rach?

793
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,359
Yeah, thinking about
thinking about it.

794
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,039
JENNIE: Great.

795
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,399
Where you from?

796
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,399
I'm from Chico in
Northern California.

797
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,279
Yeah, I found her through an agency.

798
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,399
Well, careful, because I am
known to steal nannies.

799
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,359
I am a nanny stealer.

800
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,919
No kidding.

801
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,439
Hey.

802
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,999
Do you wanna...

803
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,479
Do you wanna captain a table
at Craftacular, McKenna?

804
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,199
Really great.

805
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,319
It's, like, a lot of kids doing
crafts, raising money

806
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,799
for Jewish women with cancer.

807
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,479
Jennie, I am so sorry, but I
gotta show McKenna where the

808
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,342
dry cleaners is.

809
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,119
It was nice to meet you.

810
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,319
I'll register.

811
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,546
I promise.

812
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,439
Just like another week, until
she gets on her feet.

813
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,919
Um, what...

814
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,599
What exactly do you intend
to do for her?

815
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,559
Help her tell her story.

816
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,919
You know?

817
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,359
Maybe I can help her set up a blog.

818
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,439
She and I could co-blog.

819
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,439
You wanna...

820
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,439
You wanna blog with her?

821
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,079
Yeah, why not?

822
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,159
A lot of good things have
come from blogging.

823
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,279
Name one good thing that's
come from blogging.

824
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,879
OK, that crunchy kale
salad that I made.

825
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,559
That was from someone's blog.

826
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,479
You're right.

827
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,959
Blogging's amazing.

828
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,479
So, and we are recording.

829
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,119
OK.

830
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,919
So, we are not sure what this is
going to be yet, if this is

831
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,719
gonna be a blog, a co-blog,
article, podcast.

832
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,599
We're going to just...

833
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,279
You know.

834
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,679
Who knows?

835
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,879
Keep it loose.

836
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,439
Right now we're just gonna have a...

837
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,439
just a... just going to call...
call it a conversation.

838
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,159
Yeah.

839
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,639
OK.

840
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,679
You are a sex worker.

841
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,479
Yes.

842
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,039
I'm a sex worker.

843
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,439
And you have been, uh, working
in sex for how long?

844
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,519
Two years.

845
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,349
I started when I was 20.

846
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,519
You told me you were 19.

847
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,639
Oh, yeah.

848
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,839
I tell all my customers that.

849
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,959
It's like, a barely legal thing.

850
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,519
It turns them on.

851
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,639
What does it mean to see other
people as customers?

852
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,599
Doctors have customers,
psychiatrists have customers,

853
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,639
people that work in stores
have customers.

854
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,319
A lot of people in this
world have customers.

855
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,759
What if those customers had wives?

856
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,039
So?

857
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,319
You didn't feel a sense
of responsibility or...

858
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,599
No.

859
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,439
Sisterliness?

860
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,719
No.

861
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,399
Compassion?

862
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,639
Yeah, I feel compassion for a
world where men have a way

863
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,999
higher sex drive, and it's a
proven fact, and their wives

864
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,279
lose interest in having
sex with term.

865
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,508
Yeah, I feel compassion for that.

866
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,799
Oh my god.

867
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,399
Thank you for coming home.

868
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,945
Thank you for calling me home.

869
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,271
This is not at all what I had
scheduled for my afternoon.

870
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,759
Hey.

871
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,479
What?

872
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,759
Open Your eyes.

873
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,479
What?

874
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,519
Do me a favor.

875
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,519
Open your eyes.

876
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,189
Hi.

877
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,587
Hey

878
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,279
You wanna try having
an eyes open orgasm?

879
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,919
Hm?

880
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,879
Yeah?

881
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,839
Like this?

882
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,479
There you are.
Hey, hello, how are you?

883
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,504
Hey, long time.

884
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,599
You know what?

885
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,428
Close them.

886
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,679
I'm sorry.

887
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,559
Just keep them closed.

888
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,519
We tried.

889
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,359
Do what you gotta do.

890
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,759
Sorry.

891
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,359
Oh, I'm good.

892
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,959
Yeah?

893
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,599
Yeah.

894
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,759
I can get back in there.

895
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,679
No, no, no, no, no, no.

896
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,319
No?

897
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,679
All right.

898
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,279
Takes a second to get
back on the bus.

899
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,879
Yep.

900
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,799
Been a while.

901
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,479
Glad we did it though, so.

902
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,439
Yeah, yeah.

903
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,199
Broke the seal.

904
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,639
Nice work.

905
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,999
Right.

906
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,719
Um, so, I can when I get back
later tonight from work.

907
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,662
Yeah?

908
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,679
Um, actually, I'm gonna be
much later than I thought.

909
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,039
No worries.

910
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,879
Because I had to reschedule
this conference

911
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,919
call and I have to...

912
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,919
(PHONE VIBRATING)

913
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,959
Hold on.

914
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,879
Someone's calling me right now.

915
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,759
Hello?

916
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,639
Yeah, hey.

917
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,639
This is Jeff.

918
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,479
Listen, if...

919
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,519
If they're still on the call, I
need you to patch me through

920
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,746
right away.

921
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,599
We're running late, honey.

922
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,559
My legs are stuck.

923
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,559
Logan.

924
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,399
Logan, you have to help me.

925
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,159
(CRYING)

926
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,439
Flex your legs.

927
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,701
Let go.

928
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,559
(KNOCKING)

929
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,786
Mhmm.

930
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,399
MCKENNA: Hi.

931
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,999
Hey

932
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,119
MCKENNA:
Jeff said that you were sick.

933
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,679
Oh, I feel Shit City.

934
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,239
I'm all right, I think.

935
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,959
You know your body's not gonna heal

936
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,799
if you mind's tweaking.

937
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,519
I'm not...

938
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,759
No, wait, I...

939
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,479
McKenna, I have to reach out.

940
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,119
I have to reach out to hot dog
vendors for this Craftacular

941
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,439
or Jennie is going to kill me.

942
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,559
MCKENNA: Do you have any of

943
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,799
that menthol rub stuff?

944
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,261
Do you know what I'm talking about?

945
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,759
McKenna, I'm fine.

946
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,719
Ah, ah, ah.

947
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,039
You do have it.

948
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,839
McKenna, I don't need anything.

949
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,239
Do you have a sock?

950
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,119
No.

951
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,759
Can I use these?

952
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,799
I mean, those are gross.

953
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,759
I don't know what you're even.

954
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,799
Smells fine.

955
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,319
You don't have to do anything.

956
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,919
I'm...

957
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,559
OK.

958
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,039
I don't even...

959
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,519
Give me your foot.

960
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,839
Again, honey.

961
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,519
Please, I am total...

962
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,679
Put it down.

963
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,759
I am fine.

964
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,479
Lay down.

965
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,759
Lady.

966
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,719
I am fine.

967
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,879
OK?

968
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,584
Just pause.

969
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,345
OK.

970
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,719
My grandma used to do this
to me and my cousins

971
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,559
when we were sick.

972
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,719
RACHEL: Grandma.

973
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,799
Yeah.

974
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,550
Grandma Ninny.

975
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,519
Did you say Ninny?

976
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,519
Mhmm.

977
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,719
My mom's mom.

978
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,239
I lived with her a lot.

979
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,184
You have to keep your feet warm.

980
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,581
You do not have to do this.

981
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,831
Makes me happy.

982
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,667
I can feel in your feet
where you're blocked.

983
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,744
In your right hip.

984
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,439
We'll just shake it out.

985
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,951
OK.

986
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,826
Just shake it out a little.

987
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,869
Oh yeah, it's really right in here.

988
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,799
(WHISPERS)

989
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,550
OK.

990
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,908
Can I open this?

991
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,919
Um.

992
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,909
I'm not wearing a bra.

993
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,271
Just breathe.

994
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,820
(HEAVY BREATHING)

995
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,759
Hey, cute dress.

996
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,599
Thanks.

997
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,519
You look so pretty.

998
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,985
Where you going?

999
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,359
Do you really wanna know?

1000
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,119
Of course.

1001
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,879
I'm going to play with Jack.

1002
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,159
Oh, is that the...

1003
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,999
Is that the Paypal one, or the...

1004
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,719
MCKENNA: No, he's the other one.

1005
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,679
Oh, the nice one.

1006
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,319
MCKENNA: Mhmm.

1007
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,519
Oh, good.

1008
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,951
OK.

1009
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,239
Are you s...

1010
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,079
Are you sure you wanna go?

1011
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,559
Yeah, my mom called.

1012
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,159
Um, she's getting evicted, so I
need to make her some cash.

1013
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,119
OK.

1014
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,119
But I mean, if you...

1015
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,679
I you want me to pay you
instead of the room.

1016
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,319
I make $250 an hour.

1017
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,787
OK, well I know you're not
asking for my permission, so.

1018
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,199
OK, bye.

1019
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,359
Bye.

1020
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,825
See ya.

1021
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,111
Do you need a ride?

1022
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,991
OK.

1023
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,039
OK.

1024
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,279
Are you sure you don't
need a ride home?

1025
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,319
Oh yeah, no.

1026
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,279
He always calls me a cab.

1027
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,079
Oh.

1028
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,591

1029

Bye.

1030

1034
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,479
Stop.

1035
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,199
Please stop.

1036
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,759
It's rude.

1037
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,225
Thank you.

1038
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,039
The road to dessert is paved
with chicken, sir.

1039
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,279
That's right.

1040
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,239
Logan.

1041
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,159
I really want dessert.

1042
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,159
And you're gonna get some.

1043
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,319
Stop kicking the the table.

1044
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,839
The road to dessert is
also paved with beef.

1045
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,679
Come on.

1047
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,759
There she is.

1048
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,639
McKenna, you hungry?

1049
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,919
Plenty of food.

1050
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,199
MCKENNA: Uh, no thanks.

1051
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,439
I'm gonna go straight to bed.

1052
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,439
Good night!

1053
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,110
OK, sleep tight.

1054
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,799
Finally.

1055
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,719
Oh my god, wow.

1056
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,599
Look at you.

1057
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,279
You look unbelievable.

1058
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:11,999
OK, let's go.

1059
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,399
Hey baby.

1060
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,279
Hi.

1061
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,839
Look what you did.

1062
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,479
I'm proud.

1063
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,319
Well.

1064
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:15,799
You did so good.

1065
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,319
Wow.

1066
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,239
Really.

1067
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,159
I'm so proud of you.

Take it easy Horn Dog McCrosby.

Look, Rachel's got her boobies out.

1070
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,319
What the what, Rachel?

1071
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,039
OK, thank you.

1072
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,039
Come over here.

1073
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:26,719
Make a little Matty sandwich.

1074
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,439
OK.

1075
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,159
Yeah, thank you.

1076
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,679
Hold on.

1077

Everybody.

1078
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,319
Matt sandwich.

1079
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,239
All right, we gotta go.

1080
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,079
All right, where's your mansicle?

1081
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,039
Uh, you mean Jeff?

1082
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,079
He's over there.

1083
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,119

00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,999
JENNIE: This way.

1085
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,599
This way.

1086
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,159
Excuse me.

1087
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,759
Amanda!

1088
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,479
Yeah?

1089
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,279
Don't freak out.

1090
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,079
OK.

1091
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,119
Get a bracelet on this one.

1092
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,559
Oh, yep.

1093
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,439
And, uh, I don't mean to be
unkind, you guys, but I sweat,

1094
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,319
if I see anybody walking around
without a bracelet,

1095
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,839
I'm gonna shit myself.

1096
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,079
Yeah, I...

1097
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,399
I'm really sorry about what
happened last year.

1098
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,519
No, don't even worry
about it, because

1099
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,199
it's not your fault.

1100
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,959
Actually, that was completely
your fault, but I'm

1101
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,279
totally over it.

1102
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,239
All right, I want you here with
Amanda, and just figure

1103
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,719
out between the two of you
who's gonna do bracelets,

1104
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,999
who's gonna take credit cards.

1105
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,159
Uh, I'm...

1106
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,599
I'm doing hot dogs with Stephanie.

1107
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,239
Oh, honey, all due respect, you
kinda dropped the ball on

1108
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,679
the hot dogs, so I gave it to Alisa.

1109
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,079
Sorry, I...

1110
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,439
I need to borrow my husband
for one second.

1111
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,239
I'm so sorry.

1112
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,079
What?

1113
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,719
You're leaving?

1114
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,399
Yeah.

1115
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,519
Why?

1116
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,879
Because that's how it works.

1117
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,562
The women tell the men where to
set up the folding table,

1118
00:46:22,563 --> 00:46:24,559
and the men set up the folding
table so men are free to go.

1119
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,559
That's gross.

1120
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,039
Just hang with Steph, OK?

1121
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,479
Talk shit about the moms.

1122
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,479
You guys'll have fun.

1123
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,319
I'm off of hot dogs.

1124
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,239
What?

1125
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,919
That is outrageous.

1126
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,199
You don't get to make fun
of me and go surfing.

1127
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,439
I'm with fucking kosher Amanda.

1128
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,599
This is fucking kosher Amanda's
face all the time.

1129
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,359
You're right.

1130
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,239
That is her face.

1131
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,879
Right here.

1132
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,759
Yeah.

1133
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,479
That's her resting face.

1134
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,422
That is her face.

1135
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,079
This is her baseline.

1136
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,319
I wanna see how it feels.

1137
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,399
Huh, this is how it feels
to be kosher Amanda.

1138
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:47,959
It's not fun at all.

1139
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,959
Mm-mm.

1140
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,199
All right, I'm going surfing.

1141
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,799
I can't believe you're leaving me.

1142
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,759
Bye.

1143
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,271
It's not fair, Jeff.

1144
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,199
Seriously, I'm...

1145
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,639
I'm doing it.

1146
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,679
Whoa.

1147
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,079
Last night, we're going crazy.

1148
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,039
MAN: Go, go go!

1149
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,744
Go, go, go, go, go!

1150
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,879
Can Logan go home with Owen?

1151
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,879
JENNIE:
Well, yeah.

1152
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,079
I know, I'm sorry you guys.

1153
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,879
Of course, I hope you feel better.

1154
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,599
Awful cramps.

1155
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,679
OK.

1156
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,559
MAN: Paddle, paddle,

1157
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,439
paddle, paddle, paddle.

1158
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,599
MAN: Jeff!

1159
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,559
MAN: Hop up, hop up!

1160
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,279
MAN: (INAUDIBLE)!

1161
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,279
Jefferey!

1162
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,279
Super stud!

1163
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,279
Yeah yeah!

1164
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,791
RACHEL: McKenna?

1165
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,159
Hey.

1166
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,999
Going to Jack's?

1167
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,799
Yeah.

1168
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,629
I'm coming with you.

1169
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,079
Can I check those?

1170
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,039
Why is that weird?

1171
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,479
How come no one believes in us?

1172
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,119
I believe in us.

1173
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,759
If we don't believe in us,
who's gonna believe in us?

1174
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,799
Yeah, come on, Craig.

1175
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,559
Is that the name of our band?

1176
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,359
We Believe in Us?

1177
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,919
We Believe in Us.

1178
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,039
How about just Dadz,
with a Z on the end.

1179
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,239
Surf Godz with a Z.
I don't care Want.

1180
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,719
I just want a Z to be
somewhere in the

1181
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,424
title of the band name.

1182
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,980
(CROAKING)

1183
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,719
Oh, I need a new name.

1184
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,919
Oh, yeah.

1185
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,479
Right?

1186
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,359
Mhmm.

1187
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,199
Sophia?

1188
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,799
No.

1189
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,399
“Again?

1190
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,519
Oh my god.

1191
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,719
Cassidy?

1192
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,319
No.

1193
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,879
Ariel?

1194
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,879
No.

1195
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,879
Samantha?

1196
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,919
Um, Shelly?

1197
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,399
Maybe.

1198
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,865
Shelly.

1199
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,599
(KNOCKING)

1200
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,350
MAN: Coming.

1201
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,719
Hey, baby.

1202
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,424
Hi.

1203
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:11,959
Hi.

1204
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,559
Hey.

1205
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,759
How are you?

1206
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,799
Good, how are you?

1207
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,759
I'm really good.

1208
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,479
And, uh, this is my friend.

1209
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,479
Savannah.

1210
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,519
Hi Savannah.

1211
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,746
Hi.

1212
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,479
Can I take your coat?

1213
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,439
Oh, please.

1214
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,839
Uh, thank you.

1215
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,519
Wow.

1216
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,746
You're beautiful.

1217
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,719
May I get you a drink.

1218
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,679
Uh, yes, thank you.

1219
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,439
Scotch.

1220
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,666
Yes.

1221
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,759
Here you go.

1222
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,479
Thank you.

1223
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,119
Manhattan.

1224
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,639
Yeah.

1225
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,759
Savannah, there's no pressure.

1226
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,639
McKenna told me you wanted to,
um, share the experience, and

1227
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,079
I, uh, I really admire that.

1228
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,199
Oh, thank you.

1229
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,039
I'd really love for
you to just watch.

1230
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,439
Great, that's what I'll...

1231
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,799
That's what I'll do.

1232
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,839
Totally get me off.

1233
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,559
Um.

1234
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,599
And, if, at any time, you feel
uncomfortable, then you just

1235
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,199
come on out here and, you know,
sit down and chill.

1236
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,839
So, this won't be happening
in this space, then?

1237
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,879
It's gonna be somewhere else?

1238
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,839
Or is... is it thi...

1239
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,079
Is this where it happens?

1240
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,359
She's cute.

1241
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,599
You told me she's cute,
but she's cute.

1242
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,599
You're cute.

1243
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,559
No.

1244
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,719
It happens in the bedroom.

1245
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,799
Ah, of course.

1246
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,319
May I show you the bedroom?

1247
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,479
Oh, you don't have to.

1248
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,359
I mean...

1249
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,679
No.

1250
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,759
I don't want to throw a wrench...

1251
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,439
whatever you guys normally...

1252
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,519
You know.

1253
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,239
I don't wanna...

1254
00:51:59,240 --> 00:51:59,559
Whatever.

1255
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,559
You know.

1256
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,159
Well, I could just...

1257
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,439
You go...

1258
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,519
MCKENNA: Why don't
you just come sit down?

1259
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,719
She's sweet.

1260
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,039
Give some of this to your friend.

1261
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,959
Thank you.

1262
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,479
JACK:
I think it's time for bedroom.

1263
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,719
MCKENNA: Let's go.

1264
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,479
JACK: Come on, let's go.

1265
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,599
OK.

1266
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,304
You ready, Savannah?

1267
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,799
Yeah.

1268
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,664
MCKENNA: OK, let's go.

1269
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,799
Get me hard.

1270
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,759
I will.

1271
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,799
I will.

1272
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,868
You know that I will.

1273
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,719
Sitting on this chaise lounge.

1274
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,679
Beautiful.

1275
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,999
JACK: Oh yeah.

1276
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,670
MCKENNA: Mm.

1277
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,639
Oh, I'm sorry, one more question.

1278
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,959
Sorry, I didn't mean to put
a damper on anything.

1279
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,679
You're not.

1280
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,999
OK, good.

1281
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,159
I just was, uh, wondering
how long these

1282
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,199
sessions usually last.

1283
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,639
Uh, like about an hour, right Jack?

1284
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,999
Yeah, about an hour.

1285
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,879
Oh, well great.

1286
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,319
Good.

1287
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:02,999
Don't have to make a phone call.

1288
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,559
So, I'm good.

1289
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,439
Great.

1290
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,799
Wonderful.

1291
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,639
Go about your business.

1292
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,479
I'll shut up now.

1293
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,239
Oh yeah.

1294
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,239
Can you see, Savannah?

1295
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,039
I...

1296
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,759
Yes, I'm fine.

1297
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,679
I'm fine.

1298
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,279
Yeah?

1299
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,519
MCKENNA: Oh my god,
you're getting so hard.

1300
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,879
Fuck yeah, I am getting...

1301
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,039
MCKENNA: Baby!

1302
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:22,759
Are you sure you can see, honey?

1303
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,719
Mm-hm.

1304
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,879
Oh yeah, that's it.

1305
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,639
I want you to see me.

1306
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,039
RACHEL: I do.

1307
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,679
I don't think you can.

1308
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,839
(LAUGHING)

1309
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,879
JACK: Come to daddy.

1310
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,599
I'm coming!

1311
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,599
Hey.

1312
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,639
Does that feel good?

1313
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,599
JACK: Oh yeah.

1314
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,839
Yeah?

1315
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,839
Look at this, Savannah.

1316
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,590
Take it in.

1317
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,799
(MOANING)

1318
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,799
Savannah, can you take my hand?

1319
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,470
Come here.

1320
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,152
(MOANING)

1321
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,279
Oh, yeah.

1322
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,992
(MOANING)

1323
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,679
Are you OK?

1324
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,799
Yeah.

1325
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,119
I think we should go.

1326
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,999
Well, let me give you your cash.

1327
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,750
No, I don't want it.

1328
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,799
JEFF: Babe?

1329
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,719
Yeah?

1330
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,719
JEFF: Hey.

1331
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,185
Guess what?

1332
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,959
JEFF: I got up.

1333
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,919
What are you talking about?

1334
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,919
JEFF:
I stood up.

1335
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,919
I got up.

1336
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,864
Your husband is a surfer.

1337
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,826
OK.

1338
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,879
What are you wearing?

1339
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,839
What is this outfit?

1340
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,799
What...

1341
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,519
why do you have all this makeup on?

1342
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,919
Um, after Craftacular,
I went to Nordstrom's.

1343
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,759
I let a very aggressive sales
lady do my makeup.

1344
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,439
Huh.

1345
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,719
Where's Logan?

1346
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,119
Jennie's playing with him.

1347
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,839
OK.

1348
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,590
You look like someone else.

1349
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,866
Get in bed.

1350
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,672
(MOANING)

1351
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,319
Make sure you give your
brother a turn.

1352
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,079
Jeff?

1353
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:14,839
Mazels, buddy.

1354
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,519
Tremendous spread.

1355
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,399
Thank you.

1356
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:16,919
Let's do it here.

1357
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,719
Makes life much easier.

1358
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,599
Hey.

1359
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,879
Sorry, I just woke up.

1360
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,919
Sorry, I passed out.

1361
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,839
What are all these people
doing here?

1362
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,599
What are you talking about?

1363
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,839
It's brunch.

1364
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,799
I told you I was going
to get bagels.

1365
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,959
Do we have Half N' Half?

1366
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,799
I... no, I don't know.

1367
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,879
It's fine.

1368
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,959
Everyone's having a good time.

1369
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,239
Hi, ladies.

1370
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:31,839
Hi, buddy.

1371
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,519
Hi.

1372
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,519
What's going on?

1373
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,519
You are a mess.

1374
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,999
What's happening?

1375
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,559
Did you just wake up?

1376
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,279
Everyone's seeing things under here.

1377
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,999
Anyone tell you we were
coming here today?

1378
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,559
I totally blanked on it.

1379
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,639
Oh, no.

1380
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,039
I've got to make my leave.

1381
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,479
You sure Mason has growing foods?

1382
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,999
I've got to go set up
for Women and Wine.

1383
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,999
OK.

1384
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,439
Women and Wine is tonight?

1385
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,199
The men are playing poker, and
Logan can go to Meredith's

1386
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,839
to be with the boys if he wants.

1387
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,879
Oh, can McKenna come watch the
girls, just like, sit with

1388
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,439
them over at that, uh, Amanda's?

1389
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,399
McKenna!

1390
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,879
Sweetie, hi.

1391
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,199
Do you... do you... do you
have plans tonight?

1392
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,399
Like, do you want to come hang
out with like, four really

1393
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,959
cute girls, do a bunch of dress up?

1394
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,679
It'd be so fun.

1395
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,239
Sure.

1396
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,039
Really?

1397
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:14,959
I can do it.

1398
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,879
I can, don't worry about it.

1399
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,839
I will actually... you know what?

1400
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,679
I'll just call...

1401
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,519
No, no, it's fine.

1402
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,359
I had no plans tonight.

1403
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,119
It's not a big deal.

1404
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,439
Oh, I love you.

1405
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,159
I love her.

1406
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:22,839
OK, good.

1407
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,799
See you later.

1408
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,119
Can we just do that?

1409
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,079
Great.

1410
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,679
No, it's a great idea.

1411
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,359
Yeah, yeah.

1412
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,479
That'll work.

1413
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,661
All right, I'm out of here.

1414
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,959
I don't want McKenna to
sit the girls tonight.

1415
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,119
What?

1416
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,302
I don't want McKenna to
sit the girls tonight.

1417
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,839
Could you tell her it's not
gonna work out, or you found

1418
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,479
somebody else?

1419
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,519
Whatever.

1420
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,879
You want me to tell her?

1421
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,679
Yes.

1422
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,319
I don't want to.

1423
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:58,919
Well, wha...

1424
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,079
I don't...

1425
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,879
Just be my friend and tell her.

1426
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,584
Here you go.

1427
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,119
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1428
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,719
Yeah?

1429
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,867
Come in.

1430
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,039
Hey.

1431
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,839
Um, so, great news.

1432
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,039
Jennie called, and Meredith
found someone to watch the

1433
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,119
girls, so you're off the
hook for tonight.

1434
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,079
Why?

1435
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:33,319
Honestly Rachel and I were
talking, and, I don't know.

1436
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,679
She's just a little uncomfortable

1437
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,679
with the whole thing.

1438
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,119
Rachel is uncomfortable?

1439
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,585
Yeah.

1440
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,039
The girls are, um, really
young, you know?

1441
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,639
Two of them are in preschool, so...

1442
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,519
Yeah.

1443
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,799
Logan's in preschool.

1444
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,039
I babysit him all the time.

1445
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,919
Yeah, but just, you know,
other peoples' kids.

1446
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,399
Right.

1447
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,519
Plus, you don't really know Amanda.

1448
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,919
I've met Amanda.

1449
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,119
Yeah.

1450
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,999
She's just, like, super Jewish.

1451
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,839
Like, two sets of plates Jewish.

1452
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,319
OK.

1453
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,079
OK?

1454
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:17,879
Yeah.

1455
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,519
Cool.

1456
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,239
OK.

1457
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,719
I get it.

1458
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,519
Um, so I have the night off.

1459
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,479
Right?

1460
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,991
Yeah.

1461
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,799
Great.

1462
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,399
Well, thanks for understanding.

1463
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,279
Totally.

1464
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,399
All right.

1465
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,879
See you soon.

1466
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,630
Can you shut the door, please?

1467
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,119
Look how big you are.

1468
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,239
So you're gonna go with...
what are you doing?

1469
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,919
You're in the driver's seat.

1470
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,839
Your son is driving
the car, Meredith.

1471
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,759
Good girl.

1472
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,239
Get back here!

1473
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,199
Hi.

1474
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,879
(CHATTERING)

1475
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,119
Hi, Pretty girl.

1476
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,759
I got you guys some presents.

1477
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,199
You're a princess tonight.

1478
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,799
Some nail polish, and some
bracelets, and some candy.

1479
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,279
A bunch of fun stuff.

1480
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,319
You're gonna be real
princesses, huh?

1481
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,679
Thanks.

1482
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,759
I'm so sorry I can't be there.

1483
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,959
Somebody changed my plans.

1484
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,879
What do you say?

1485
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,679
Thank you.

1486
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,639
You're so welcome.

1487
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,439
Have the best night ever.

1488
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,119
Thanks, McKenna.

1489
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:22,719
Yeah.

1490
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,159
Bye.

1491
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,239
Bye.

1492
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,300
Look at these bracelets!

1493
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,679
Hey.

1494
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,119
Oh, peanuts.

1495
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,639
Yep.

1496
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,319
So what time are you
getting out of here?

1497
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,759
Uh, guys are coming around
8:00, so, whenever.

1498
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,679
Can I have a chip?

1499
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,145
Yeah.

1500
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,759
I'll be gone.

1501
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,359
OK.

1502
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,825
Have fun.

1503
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,159
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here, I'm here.

1504
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,199
What's up, my friend?

1505
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,839
What's going on, my friend?

1506
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,879
Yeah, it's good to see you.

1507
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,679
That case looks so sinister.

1508
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,679
Isn't it?

1509
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,519
Well, there's guns in here.

1510
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,399
I'm just...

1511
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,799
There's guns in here.

1512
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,719
That's gonna be on you, potentially.

1513
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,439
Why?

1514
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,239
What did I do?

1515
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,039
You know why.

1516
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,199
I didn't...

1517
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,319
I didn't know that was you.

1518
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,239
I didn't.

1519
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,359
I cut him off. I'm sorry.

1520
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,479
Are we ready to descend
to the gambling house?

1521
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,039
Are these fingerlings?

1522
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,079
Rach, are you seeing this?

1523
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,359
Oh, it's beautiful.

1524
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,919
Jennie.

1525
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,119
So, this is where we
will Women and Wine.

1526
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,079
It's very French, right?

1527
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,519
Is that what we're going for here?

1528
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,919
It is.

1529
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,639
The only thing that's not French, no

1530
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,599
kidding, is the piano.

1531
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,479
It was my grandfather's...

1532
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,959
Somebody had a five.

1533
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,679
Fuck you.

1534
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,919
So now it's to him, because
he's left of the dealer.

1535
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,919
(CHATTERING)

1536
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,999
Man, fuck.

1537
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,511
You're betting a million dollars.

1538
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,159
It should be pronounced
"yuca," as in Yucatan.

1539
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,900
Well, I guess it's in
most tequilas and...

1540
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,559
It's 7:59.

1541
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,559
7:59.

1542
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,319
Can I ask a question?

1543
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,879
Yeah.

1544
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,159
Where'd the fuck that fucking
ante come from?

1545
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,479
Jennifer's into guys who are
approximately 100 pounds

1546
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,519
overweight.

1547
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,639
They are full figured women.

1548
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,999
Seriously, dude.

1549
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,959
Rachel found her.

1550
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,425
Rachel found her.

1551
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:25,879
Good pick.

1552
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,359
Yeah.

1553
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,199
We should have a toast, ladies.

1554
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,439
OK, let's toast it up.

1555
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,319
We should have a toast!

1556
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,239
So much.

1557
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,799
To long marriages.

1558
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,679
And long...

1559
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,359
Long marriage!

1560
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,159
Absolutely!

1561
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:36,639
And children.

1562
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,599
Cheers.

1563
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,039
Wait, wait, wait.

1564
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,039
This is, we have to look
each other in the eye.

1565
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:41,559
What?

1566
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,319
We did.

1567
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,239
No.

1568
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:43,519
We have to go like this.

1569
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,239
This is

1570
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:44,999
It's not real.

1571
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,719
We don't do it.

1572
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,359
So make it real.

1573
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:46,959
I got it.

1574
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,279
OK.

1575
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,399
It's just something she
read in "Real Simple."

1576
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,679
She's making everyone
have these moments.

1577
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,359
OK.

1578
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,239
I'm sorry, but...

1579
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,319
I'm so glad.

1580
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,319
Cheers.

1581
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:56,989
Cheers.

1582
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,559
But, speaking of which,
if you want to go...

1583
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,319
Jennie.

1584
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:00,799
Hi.

1585
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,799
Jennie.

1586
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,999
Speaking of, you want to...

1587
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,039
I'm looking at you.

1588
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,479
No, you need to look at her.

1589
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,479
You need to hold her hand.

1590
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,439
I just looked at her!

1591
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,905
Oh my god.

1592
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,180
(LAUGHTER)

1593
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,060
(LAUGHTER)

1594
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,399
When you get home and you take
off those things, there's

1595
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,919
no... right?

1596
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,639
There's no elegant way
to pull them off.

1597
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,799
And your whole body just...

1598
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,439
Pot's getting too good, right?

1599
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,879
Remember you used to be
able to smoke a joint?

1600
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,919
You smoke your joint now, you die.

1601
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,879
Hi.

1602
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,799
Hello.

1603
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,319
Hey.

1604
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,359
Hi.

1605
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,199
Thought you were going out?

1606
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,079
Oh, I changed my mind.

1607
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,839
Look at this.

1608
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,351
You guys need company?

1609
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,479
Yeah.

1610
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,919
Yeah, all right.

1611
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,199
There was a thing that...

1612
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,599
Stephanie, why are you not drinking?

1613
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,239
I know that normally I am a
borderline alcoholic, but, I

1614
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,639
wasn't gonna tell you
guys, I am preggers.

1615
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,559
I'm "p". It was a total surprise.

1616
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,399
Oh, my god.

1617
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,799
Yeah, so anyway...

1618
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,679
Oh, my god!

1619
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,239
Amazing.

1620
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,919
Oh, you guys are gonna
have two kids?

1621
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,385
That's good for me!

1622
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,079
Oh my god!

1623
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,959
You're trying to get
mad about three.

1624
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,919
Yeah.

1625
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,387
Not me, said Logan.

1626
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,359
OK.

1627
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:39,919
Wow.

1628
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,679
Anyway.

1629
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,479
That is awesome.

1630
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,479
Wow.

1631
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,479
Congratulations.

1632
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,039
That is, I mean...

1633
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,239
Congratulations.

1634
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:46,959
Thank you guys, Thank you so much.

1635
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,719
Thank you.

1636
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,479
When are you due?

1637
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,439
March.

1638
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,839
Wow.

1639
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,399
Thank you.

1640
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,439
Has anybody here wondered what
their aborted children

1641
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,919
would be like?

1642
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,959
Oh, my god.

1643
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,439
What is happening right now?

1644
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,359
I'm serious.

1645
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,079
Ah right, you guys.

1646
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:02,999
Have we all not had... who's
had an abortion here?

1647
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,839
And We've all...

1648
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,479
Who hasn't?

1649
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,479
Yeah.

1650
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,879
We've all had the abortion.

1651
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,279
I fucked so many people
in my 20's, you guys.

1652
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,479
It's like, all I did
was fuck people.

1653
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,999
Everybody fucked everybody.

1654
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,959
Exactly.

1655
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,079
That's why you have 20's.

1656
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,279
That's why you have your 20's.

1657
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,479
I fucked the shit out of my 20's.

1658
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,879
The 20's are for fucking.

1659
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,359
Thank you!

1660
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,519
And they're for asking your
parents for money.

1661
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,319
I want to hear about
everybody's abortions!

1662
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,799
Guys, it's not gonna be...
it's not gonna be

1663
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,119
a super late night.

1664
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,399
So we should wrap it up.

1665
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,319
Right?

1666
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:28,919
Who wants another drink?

1667
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,199
This is...

1668
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,239
I will, uh, I would
love a little bit.

1669
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,399
Thank you, darling.

1670
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,639
I'm gonna go get us some whiskey.

1671
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,839
I'll see you guys in a minute.

1672
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,519
Don't you dare look at my cards.

1673
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,479
We will not.

1674
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,679
That would never happen.

1675
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,399
We will not look at your cards.

1676
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,079
Everything but her cards.

1677
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,784
Did she just go get us drinks?

1678
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,381
She's the best nanny in the world.

1679
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,919
So I was a freshman at USC.

1680
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,399
Oh, god.

1681
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,479
I was in my first week, and I
was in my dorm room, getting

1682
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,639
ready for my sorority rush,
because that's what all the

1683
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,039
cool kids were doing.

1684
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,439
And this guy, oh my god,
was it Mike or John?

1685
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,399
No names.

1686
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,199
John.

1687
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:13,839
Mike.

1688
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,359
Mike?

1689
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,359
Where is this going?

1690
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,279
Oh, my god.

1691
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,039
Not anywhere good.

1692
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,439
I fucking don't know his name.

1693
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,919
Anyway...

1694
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,519
He just came walking on
into my dorm room.

1695
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,359
Anyway, it happened, and...

1696
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,839
Didn't even...

1697
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,239
didn't even knock on
my dorm room door.

1698
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,399
OK, I definitely don't like
where this is going.

1699
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,599
Yeah, but he came in, he
told me I was pretty.

1700
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,999
And made me feel really
sorry for him.

1701
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,879
And then he, and then he raped you.

1702
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,919
Started kissing me.

1703
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,319
Is that where this is going?

1704
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,919
No!

1705
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,399
You guys, it's not... this
is not a rape story!

1706
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,879
You promise?

1707
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,239
It sounds a whole lot
like a rape story.

1708
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,599
I literally just like... that's
what s college is.

1709
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,479
This is...

1710
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,959
Nobody asks in college!

1711
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,199
Could we just pretend like
it's my baby shower?

1712
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,479
I think that's appropriate.

1713
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,079
It wasn't like a stranger, you guys.

1714
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,359
We met in the cafeteria.

1715
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,879
Oh, god.

1716
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,039
What is going on with you tonight?

1717
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,879
That's called date rape.

1718
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,919
No, we managed to get through
this fucking amazing thing

1719
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,479
they used to serve.

1720
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,239
Oh, my god.

1721
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,799
It was like this foamy, light
green, whipped jello shit with

1722
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,679
like...

1723
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,639
Oh, I remember that.

1724
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,479
What was that?

1725
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,439
Marshmallows in it.

1726
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:14,719
What was that called?

1727
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,479
Fantasia.

1728
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,199
It's Ambrosia.

1729
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:16,959
It's Ambrosia.

1730
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,439
It was Ambrosia.

1731
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,519
You're doing it.

1732
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,559
Amanda.

1733
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,079
I make that all the time.

1734
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,519
You still make it?

1735
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,199
Yeah.

1736
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:25,799
Where do you get the recipe
for something like that?

1737
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,719
She got it from her bubba.

1738
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,679
She just...

1739
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,839
In my head.

1740
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,359
What's your secret?

1741
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,319
Um, there's really no secret.

1742
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,599
You just put stuff in it.

1743
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,559
It's jello, and then you just
add whatever you have.

1744
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,479
You know, fruit.

1745
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,879
Nuts.

1746
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,559
You put nuts in the jello?

1747
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,599
Yeah.

1748
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,439
You can put nuts in there.

1749
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,879
Cherries.

1750
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,679
Uh...

1751
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,679
Nuts?

1752
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,319
Yeah.

1753
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,119
Oh, stop it.

1754
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,559
Would you stop it?

1755
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,879
When you bite down on a
piece of jello, you're

1756
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,959
not expecting a nut.

1757
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,239
That's what I'm saying.

1758
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,479
So I got pregnant by this kid.

1759
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,759
Oh, god, we're still on it.

1760
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,679
And then I had to go back home to my

1761
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,319
parents' house in Chicago.

1762
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,879
Had to go to the local clinic.

1763
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,119
Got an abortion!

1764
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,679
Did your parents know?

1765
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,359
Yeah.

1766
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,479
My mom knew.

1767
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,399
Oh.

1768
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,039
I had to literally stay home
the rest of my freshman year,

1769
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,439
and I missed my Freshman year.

1770
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,559
Didn't even go back to
fucking USC, because I

1771
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,279
couldn't face that kid.

1772
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,639
Well No!

1773
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,719
So I just stayed home on
my parents' couch.

1774
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:26,679
I watched soap operas for
a year of my life.

1775
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,639
My god.

1776
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,639
Oh, my god, you guys.

1777
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,399
Soap operas.

1778
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,039
They're gone.

1779
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,679
They're all gone.

1780
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,639
(RAUCOUS CHATTER)

1781
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,879
She has returned!

1782
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:42,519
She has returned with
beverages and...

1783
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,224
look at those tits too.

1784
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,679
Come on!

1785
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,639
There we go!

1786
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,839
All right, there we go!

1787
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,519
There we go!

1788
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,759
All right.

1789
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,719
Oh, this is my shit right here, yo.

1790
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,719
This is my jam right here!

1791
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,999
This is my jam right here.

1792
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,100
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1793
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,559
Coming around the mountain.

1794
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,599
She'll be coming...

1795
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,999
Hey!

1796
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,719
Have you guys ever had
an eyes open orgasm?

1797
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,279
Hello?

1798
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:51,919
Hello!

1799
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:52,599
What?

1800
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,959
That was a good segue way.

1801
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,679
Have you guys ever had
an eyes open orgasm?

1802
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,639
Wow.

1803
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,599
Oh, my god.

1804
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,439
No, but I'm serious.

1805
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,399
Do you stare in your husband's
eyes, or do you close your

1806
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,159
eyes, and do you think
about somebody else?

1807
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,519
Hm!

1808
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,159
What is the question?

1809
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,599
Do you stare into...

1810
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,199
OK.

1811
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,799
First of all have, I'd
have to be like this.

1812
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,780
I'd have to be like...

1813
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,399
You're doing it right now!

1814
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,279
Oh, she only does it from behind!

1815
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,679
Yes!

1816
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,599
That's how this happened!

1817
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,279
From behind!

1818
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,679
They'll be coming around...

1819
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,119
He took you up the caboose.

1820
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,799
No, because then I would
be having a butt baby.

1821
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,599
Here's the situation.

1822
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,799
OK.

1823
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,359
I have a very attractive husband.

1824
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,439
I think...

1825
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,799
RACHEL: I know.

1826
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,759
STEPHANIE:... we can all get
on board for that.

1827
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,719
MEREDITH: Yes.

1828
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,959
But sometimes a little...

1829
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:37,639
Um, picture the little
what's his name.

1830
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,946
Fassbender.

1831
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,439
Whatever, I use him.

1832
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,839
RACHEL: He's got a huge cock.

1833
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,919
STEPHANIE: I use him.

1834
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,479
Don't even get me started
what's going on.

1835
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,799
Up here is like, uh, is like
college professor.

1836
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:56,759
16th century woman in a corset,
uh horse thing.

1837
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,839
Oh, that, um, that, uh, Jody Foster

1838
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,119
movie on the pool table.

1839
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,319
STEPHANIE: Oh my god.

1840
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,599
RACHEL: "The Accused."

1841
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,879
That was...

1842
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,239
Was that a pool table or a juke box?

1843
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,759
RACHEL: It was a pinball.

1844
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,999
I've masturbated to that
scene for two decades.

1845
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,879
STEPHANIE: What?

1846
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,799

STEPHANIE:
Amanda, we're making you feel

1850
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,679
uncomfortable.

1851
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,319
JENNIE: Now it's weird.

JENNIE: Amanda, honey, I'm sorry.

1859
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,799
It was up the butt stuff,
I think, that

1860

Hang on, hang on.

want another kid?

thought I was dying.

2032
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,839
Not everyone gets to be happy!

2033
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,079
Well, then quit!

2034
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,359

Because I am now in a situation
where people are

2038
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,222
depending on me, and that
means something to me.

2042
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:09,959
OK.

2043
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,879
Not out of this marriage, Jeff.

2044

So, I'm glad I saw you, I
really wanted to reach out,

2058

give you your space.

haven't really been living in

where I come from in the

each other's backs.

I think that's why I thought
that I could help her.

2064
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,439
OK, Rach, but you had
to know better.

2065
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:39,039
Um, I meant to email you about
your room at Big Bear, for

2066
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,399
your family.

2067
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,559
I'm giving it to Amanda's family
because, you know, it's

2068
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,759
gonna be awkward for the boy's
this time at the lake without

2069
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,439
their dad, so just kind of have
to be really strong for

2070
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,464
them, and I can't really do
that if you're there, so.

2078
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,759
I'm actually not kosher.

2079

I love to cook.

2082
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,479
And there are so many things
to cook that are not kosher.

01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,119
Right.

2084
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,519
But I do light the candles
on Friday nights.

2085

such a bad rap around here.

going to leave you?

with someone and take

them for granted?

2117
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,279
I did that with her.

2118
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:31,879
The moment I met her, I said to
her, I want to be looking

at your eyes when I die.
