[cell phone vibrating]

[suspenseful music intensifies]

[breathing heavily]

11
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,809
- [gravel crunching]
- [vehicle approaching]

12
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,606
- [car doors opening]
- [man] Shall we?

13
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,983
Watch your step.

14
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,110
[woman laughs]

15
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,319
[door opening loudly]

16
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,031
- [man] <i>La casa del amor.</i>
- [woman] Ah!

17
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,201
I forgot how gorgeous this place is.

18
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,163
I mean, look how good this looks.

19
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,331
[man] Where the fuck are all the flowers?

20
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,249
[woman] What?

21
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,669
[man] I told April to buy
an inordinate amount of flowers,

22
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,297
- and I don't see one flower.
- It's okay. It's fine.

23
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,715
It looks beautiful.

24
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,927
No, that-that...
That's not really what I had in mind..

25
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,807
What are you doing? [woman laughs]

26
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,601
- I can yell at April later.
- No!

27
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,896
- Baby, get these clothes off.
- No. [laughs]

28
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,440
No. Unpack first, okay? Please?

29
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,150
- Unpack first.
- Why?

30
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:08,821
Because I'm classy, and I would rather
the bedroom than the living room, and...

31
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,156
No! [woman laughs]

32
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,075
[man] You wanna see
if they bothered to stock the fridge?

33
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,578
- [woman] Yes, I'm checking.
- [clattering]

34
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,914
I will unpack the bags.

35
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,962
[man] What's the fucking point
of having an assistantâ€¦

36
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,178
[loudly] Uh, there's milk that's expired.

37
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,888
Great.

38
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,224
And orange juice that's open.

39
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,560
[laughs] Didn't you tell April
we were coming?

40
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,855
Babe, I-I-I thought we discussed

41
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,691
not yelling at each other
from across the house.

42
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,986
Right. Yeah.

43
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,739
[suspenseful music continues]

44
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,162
It's fine. It just means
we have to go ourselves and...

45
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,540
[man] Is there no food?

46
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,459
[man] Babe? Hello?

47
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,253
Babe?

48
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,381
Are you not...

49
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,731
Are you not answering
because I'm yelling

50
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,843
or because you can't hear me... Holy fuck!

51
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,805
I need you to sit down on that couch.

52
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,807
I'm not fucking around.

53
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,268
Okay, but how about
you let go of my wife first?

54
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,645
I'll let her go
when you sit on the couch!

55
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,481
This isn't a negotiation. Sit down. Sit.

56
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,567
- Okay.
- Okay, I don't want to hurt her.

57
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,027
[man] Sit down.

58
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,322
- [husband] I'm sitting down.
- Good. Now you sit down.

59
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,324
Not there. Sit over there.

60
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,662
You're not gonna fuck with me either.
Do we understand each other?

61
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,956
- Yes or no?
- You can talk to me.

62
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,042
Can I help you with something?
Money? Is that what you want?

63
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,629
Let me make that happen.
You don't wanna hurt anyone, right?

64
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,633
You're not the kinda guy
that would hurt someone.

65
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,175
You already know what kind of guy I am?

66
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,969
Is that right?

67
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,472
That's not what I'm saying.
What do you want? Let me help you.

68
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,977
What are you doing? Hey!

69
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,062
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

70
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,941
- You don't need to...
- I'm trying to cooperate.

71
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,027
- We have money.
- I'm trying to cooperate.

72
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,737
- No one knows we're...
- Shh.

73
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,740
I'm gonna tie your feet together
and you're not gonna move.

74
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,284
You don't have to tie our feet.
We're not gonna move.

75
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,871
- Were you on staff? Is that what this is?
- Not everybody works for you.

76
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,373
[wife] Does it have to be so tight?

77
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,876
Please.

78
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,128
You're already cutting off my circulation.

79
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,465
Hey! Hey!
Get your hand out of your pocket.

80
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,344
Give me your phone. Both of you.
Put your phone on the table. Take it out!

81
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,680
Put it on the table.
You too. Phone, out.

82
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,266
Put it on the table.

83
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,351
Okay.

84
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,897
- Is this your only phone?
- Yes.

85
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,523
That's my only phone.

86
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,233
Yeah?

87
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,861
You sure? Maybe I should check.

88
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,944
Okay, okay.

89
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,947
There you go.

90
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,827
Great job. Now I gotta check her purse.

91
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,704
See what you did?

92
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,584
- [wife] You don't have to do that.
- Yeah? I didn't. Now I do.

93
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,128
[breathing heavily]

94
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,963
How the fuck do you open this?

95
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,048
How does this open?

96
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,926
- Is there a trick to the purse?
- No!

97
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,427
There's a fucking clasp.

98
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,346
I got it.

99
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,598
[husband] Okay. You obviously...

100
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,892
You... You want money, yes?

101
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,186
I want to give you money, okay?

102
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,189
I-I know I've got some cash
squirreled away here somewhere.

103
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,316
[wife] We have some for emergencies.

104
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,151
Yes. For emergencies.

105
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,029
Now, we're never here,
so it's going to take me a second

106
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,448
to remember where the fuck
this money might be,

107
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,784
but I'm going to get it to you
and get you on your way.

108
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,285
I-I found your watch.

109
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,370
Your Rolex.

110
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,496
Yeah. I-I see that.

111
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,790
And in there, I found some money
in a hollowed-out book.

112
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,792
- There's probably more...
- We have more.

113
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,378
Yes. If there's anything else,
it's going to be in the office,

114
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,881
so can I get up
and take you into the office?

115
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:56,966
Slow.

116
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,927
[husband] You okay, baby?

117
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,429
- [man] She's fine.
- Yeah.

118
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,598
[man] Okay. You can let go. Go.

119
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,268
If you move, I'm gonna hear you.

120
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,145
[husband] She's not going to move.

121
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,108
It'll be all right, baby.
Just gimme one minute.

122
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,986
I know we had a secret compartment
put in here somewhere.

123
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,196
Hey! Do not try anything.

124
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
I'm not.

125
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,783
I'm trying to get you your money.

126
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,082
You seem to know who I am, right?

127
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,502
Is there something
you would like for me to call you, sir?

128
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,921
Sooner we're out of here,
the better. Okay?

129
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,384
Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me.

130
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,430
I'm gonna ask you a question.
You're going to tell me the truth.

131
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,933
Is there a gun in this house?

132
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,186
No.

133
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,773
Is that it? Anything else?

134
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,482
No.

135
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,700
[husband] See?

136
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,744
Gimme that.

137
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,915
Go.

138
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,750
Go.

139
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,424
It's around 5,000.

140
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,303
So, between my Rolex,

141
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,348
the money you found in the office,
and that, I'd say you had

142
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,267
a pretty successful morning
over at my house, huh?

143
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,897
Anything else is gonna be
too big to carry or too easy to trace.

144
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,898
So that's it.

145
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,317
And you have our phones.
There's no landline.

146
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,194
No landlines, no security cameras.

147
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,988
And we don't have neighbors for miles.
We don't even know them.

148
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,949
So, for us, it's like you were never here.

149
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,910
Exactly. We walked in.
Some shit was already missing.

150
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,455
But not even enough
toâ€¦ to file a police report.

151
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,461
[man] Put your hands behind your back.

152
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,421
No.

153
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,342
Lean forward
and put your hands behind your back!

154
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,945
- Don't do that. Just go!
- Have you not heard a thing I've said?

155
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,805
Yeah. I heard everything you said.
I'm not gonna leave you here

156
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,048
to do whatever you want
the second I walk out the door.

157
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,226
You walk out,
we forget you exist, end of story.

158
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,145
- I'm gonna myself a head start.
- No one knows we're here.

159
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,231
I don't fucking believe you.

160
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,196
Goddamn it!

161
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,951
[moody music playing]

162
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,786
Okay, so what now? [wife sighs]

163
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
Just walk.

164
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,209
- Any direction?
- Yeah. Toâ€¦ To the right. This one.

165
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,596
[husband] So, what is the plan here?

166
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,056
[man] The plan is for you
to shut the fuck up.

167
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,851
Go. Straight.

168
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,815
[husband] That's not really a plan.

169
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,030
No, right here.

170
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,658
Open the door. Get inside.

171
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,743
What?

172
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,537
Y-You're really gonna lock us
in the sauna?

173
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,705
This is your plan?

174
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,584
To lock us in the fucking sauna
for days on end with no food or water?

175
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,960
[man] It's not gonna be days.

176
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,088
I'm gonna barricade the door
so it'll take a while, but you'll get out.

177
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,549
This is the only thing
that's gonna work for us.

178
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,970
No, I'm not in the mood for a schvitz.

179
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,014
[man] It's not gonna be on. Get in.

180
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:32,932
No.

181
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,183
You're going to have to

182
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,727
rack your brain for something else.

183
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,695
I don't wanna hurt you
in front of your wife.

184
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,702
Okay. Babe?

185
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,503
[wife grunts] Ow.

186
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,641
You're not gonna know when I'm gone.

187
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,144
I suggest you wait like an hour
before you start trying to get out.

188
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,437
Mm-hmm, mm-mm.

189
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,816
[brooding music playing]

190
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,067
You know, uh, buddy,

191
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,529
y-you're not getting
what I've been trying to tell you.

192
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,905
No one knows we're here!

193
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,033
I was scheduled t-to give
the keynote at CES this weekend,

194
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,369
but I pulled out at the last minute, okay?

195
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,539
I pulled out to surprise her!

196
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:43,043
I moved fucking mountains
to change my schedule for her!

197
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,337
- And then you fucking showed up.
- For us.

198
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,797
- What?
- For us.

199
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,675
For us! Yes, that's what I said. For us!

200
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:54,221
Which I did gladly so we could have
a little fucking alone time! Okay?

201
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,931
Enjoy the alone time, then.

202
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,024
I'm gonna fucking kill him. I'm...
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna fucking...

203
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,692
Fuck!

204
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,616
[husband] Hey!

205
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,582
[husband] Hey! Fuck!

206
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,087
I really don't think he had a gun.

207
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,882
[tense percussive music playing]

208
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,669
[grunts]

209
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:19,389
[phone ringing]

210
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,641
[phone stops ringing]

211
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,809
[breathing heavily]

212
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,324
Okay.

213
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,410
[car engine turns over]

214
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,963
[engine shuts off]

215
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,113
[moody music plays]

216
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,536
Fuck!

217
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,425
[sighs]

218
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,095
[tense music plays]

219
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,356
Okay.

220
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,536
[mutters]

221
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,748
[tense music intensifies]

222
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,625
[husband] Hurry! Come on, come on.

223
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,252
[man] Hey!

224
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,586
[music stops]

225
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,837
Hey, stop!

226
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,716
[tense music resumes]

227
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,442
Stop! Stop!

228
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,415
Fuck.

229
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,186
[panting]

230
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,410
I'm gonna fucking get you! Stop! Stop!

231
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,120
Stop, sto...

232
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,332
- Stop, what the fuck!
- I win! I got you. Just stop.

233
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,169
Don't make us run anymore.
Any way you go, I'm gonna get you.

234
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,962
Just stop. Stop.

235
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,298
- [both panting with effort]
- Or... No.

236
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,925
Stop. Stay down. Stay down.

237
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,469
I'm not fucking around.

238
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,553
Get her back here.

239
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,515
- I've got him! Get back here now.
- [husband yells] Babe!

240
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,395
[husband] Babe!

241
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,980
I've got your gun.

242
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,282
Whose camera is that?

243
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,368
How am I supposed to know that?

244
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,455
A-And are you sure
that what you saw was even a camera?

245
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,540
Am I sure that... Yes, it was a camera.

246
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,501
Where does it go?

247
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,544
[husband] I have no idea.

248
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,632
Also, you know as well as I do,
once something is recorded digitally...

249
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,759
If it even was...

250
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,052
It's just out there.

251
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,222
There's nothing you can do about it.
It's not like a 7-Eleven

252
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,934
where you can go in the back
and-and tear out a hard drive.

253
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,520
Everyone's an idiot to you, huh?

254
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,687
No, not everyone.

255
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,817
- You lied to me.
- [husband] I'm not lying.

256
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,028
We have no security cameras
on our property.

257
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,780
Really? Just like there's no gun?

258
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:31,284
Speaking of which, how about we establish
some... some ground rules on that gun?

259
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,036
- Meaning what?
- Meaning I have no idea

260
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,871
how much you've used or been around guns,

261
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:39,251
but if you're going to be pointing it
at one of us, you can point at me. Okay?

262
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,169
I haven't pointed it at anybody yet.

263
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,297
I know that. All I'm saying is,
we know you have a gun.

264
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,174
We're not going anywhere.

265
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:52,514
And to prevent any fuckingâ€¦
[makes gunshot noises] â€¦oopsie-doopsies,

266
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,433
just put the safety on.

267
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,852
Safety's on.

268
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,688
So, nothing accidental.

269
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,566
[husband] Great. But the question remains,

270
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,485
what do you want me to do?

271
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,239
It's the same situation, guys.

272
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,740
It's not the same situation.

273
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:16,163
Not if my face is out there.
Not if I have toâ€¦ hide from this.

274
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,956
You think five grand is gonna cut it?

275
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,542
All that's changed is
the amount you need, right?

276
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,086
Am I right?

277
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,300
We still all... All three of us,
we have to find a way through this.

278
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,470
So it comes down to how much and how soon.

279
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,807
Soâ€¦ how much?

280
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,563
To what? To disappear? Start a new life?
Looks like that's what it's going to take.

281
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,024
Soâ€¦ you knowâ€¦

282
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:49,196
A hundred... A hundred...
Hundred fifty thousand dollars.

283
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,279
[husband chuckles]

284
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,032
What? What is so fucking funny?

285
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,534
- Hundred fifty thousand?
- Hundred fifty thousand.

286
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,496
You think that's enough?

287
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,789
Yeah, I-I think you're going to want more.

288
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,793
If you were looking for
any reasonable quality of life,

289
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:04,877
yes, that's right.

290
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,214
Something tells me
that maybe you and I have

291
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,758
some very different pictures
of quality of life.

292
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,676
Oh, most definitely we do,

293
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,222
but either way,
I don't think 150,000 is going to cut it.

294
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,474
You're going to blow through it
like that. [snaps]

295
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,978
Double it, then. ThreeÂ hundred thousand.

296
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:27,859
Babe. Where was this cutthroat negotiator
when we were doing our prenups?

297
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,153
[wife chuckles]

298
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,699
Uh, anyway,

299
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,619
one man's opinion,

300
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,247
I think we're still too low.

301
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,168
Great. Then let's, uhâ€¦ let's add a zero.

302
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,419
Three million.

303
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,758
- [laughing]
- What are you laughing at?

304
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,388
Well, n-now you're just...
You're sounding ridiculous.

305
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:01,268
Excuse me. Aren't you worth
several billion dollars now or something?

306
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:05,522
Whatever I'm rumored to be worth,
which is actually much more,

307
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,442
that still doesn't mean
that I can just pick up a little red phone

308
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,028
and withdraw however much money
whenever I want.

309
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,530
That's not the way it works.

310
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,865
Also, if I'm asking
for three million dollars,

311
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,952
well, don't you think
that might set off a few alarm bells?

312
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,496
Which isn't exactly
what you want, correct?

313
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,374
Fine! Then what is...
What's the most that you can get?

314
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,668
What's the... What is the max?

315
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,003
You don't want the max.

316
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,047
I want the f...
I want the max! What's the max?

317
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:35,343
I'm the only one here
that has actually been inside a room

318
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,345
with over a million dollars in it.

319
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,640
Now, there are certain limitations
to that kind of money.

320
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,769
Not only the amount,
but how much does that money weigh?

321
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,896
How much can I physically carry?

322
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,358
Do you have any idea
how much three million dollars weighs?

323
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,443
How much?

324
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:57,032
Well, I don't know the actual weight.
That's not the point.

325
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,285
Point is that you have to think about
how much can fit inside one suit...

326
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,494
Just tell me the amount.

327
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,372
Okay? Just tell... Wh-What's the...

328
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,375
What's the number?

329
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,460
[husband chuckles]

330
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,467
Guys, I have to use the bathroom.

331
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,468
What?

332
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,013
I waited as long as I could.

333
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,601
So, how we gonna do this?

334
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,813
[man] Hey, hold on.

335
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:30,939
Hold on.

336
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,163
This curtain stays open.

337
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,749
Wait, what? Iâ€¦ I can't go like that.

338
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,794
- What's the problem?
- Privacy?

339
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,590
Okay. Uhâ€¦ there's an option B,

340
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,277
which is you pick a corner
of the living room and do your business.

341
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,302
I'm fine either way.

342
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,847
- Tempting.
- [husband groans]

343
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,653
[exhales]

344
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:17,736
Okay.

345
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,539
[grunts]

346
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,211
[husband] Hmm.

347
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,548
Got it.

348
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,215
Yeah.

349
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,136
[husband] So why me?

350
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:47,142
I mean, other than the obvious reason,
why did you target my house?

351
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,854
I think the less we know
about each other, the better, don't you?

352
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,858
This does not seem random to me.

353
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,194
It seems like you knew
there would be no security camerasâ€¦

354
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,489
- [toilet flushes]
- â€¦and it seems you expected us to be gone.

355
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,326
Due diligence on your part.

356
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,412
Much better.

357
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,497
[foreboding music playing]

358
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,558
[husband] FourÂ hundred fifty thousand.

359
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,230
[man Let's round it up.

360
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,566
Even 500.

361
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,860
Just feels right to me.

362
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,041
Okay, we could do that. But the problem...

363
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,072
I-I remember.

364
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:48,244
If I'm having any trouble
carrying the extra 50, I'll, uhâ€¦

365
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,163
I'll leave it in your pool.

366
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,380
Half a mil it is.

367
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,887
Let's go get you your money.

368
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,098
[foreboding music rising]

369
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,355
It's working.

370
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,569
Hey.

371
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,073
Stay where I can see you.

372
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,916
- No, hey. [snaps] Audio. Audio only.
- [husband mutters]

373
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,503
Every time I call on the computer,

374
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,838
- it's on video.
- Yeah?

375
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,048
Well, I don't care. Not this time.

376
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:47,387
Have you ever called someone
for a quick emergency delivery of 500k?

377
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,056
Yes. Just last week I did.

378
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,519
Okay, look, I can get you the money.

379
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,522
It will, however,
require a little fucking finesse.

380
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,359
If I call and ask my assistant
to arrange this kind of cash,

381
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,944
and don't do it face-to-face,

382
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,029
that might seem a little suspicious.

383
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,410
I'm gonna be standing right here.

384
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,703
- Perfect.
- Right here.

385
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,582
And if you so much as blink
in a way that I find questionable,

386
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,667
we're gonna have a problem, okay?

387
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,920
So, no... no nose-scratching.

388
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,089
No, uh, no code words.

389
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,592
Okay, Matt Helm. Copy that.

390
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,218
Who the fuck is Matt Helm?

391
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,971
[exhales] Dean Martin?

392
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,433
"Talk about a booby trap."

393
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,225
You never seen that?

394
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,438
Uh, just... just focus on
what we're... On this.

395
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,857
- All right.
- [keyboard clicks]

396
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,941
[computer beeps]

397
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,862
[groans]

398
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,868
- April.
<i>- Hey! Wasn't expecting to hear from you.</i>

399
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:58,041
<i>- How'd it go with the flowers?</i>
- Don't even get me started on the flowers.

400
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,126
<i>- Um, all right.</i>
- Umâ€¦

401
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,922
I have a situation

402
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:08,092
that needs to be dealt with
quickly and discreetly. Okay?

403
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,302
<i>Okay.</i>

404
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:13,723
I need $500,000
delivered to me in cash here.

405
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,808
<i>Five hundred thousand in cash?</i>

406
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,392
<i>Okay.</i>

407
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,982
- Debbie is back.
- [April whispers] <i>Wait, what?</i>

408
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,360
<i>- Even with the NDA?</i>
- Okay, shut up.

409
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,154
My wife is here, so that's all I can say.

410
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,282
But how quickly can you get this to me?

411
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,368
<i>Well, it's gonna be tomorrow.</i>

412
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,620
- Tomorrow?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

413
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,163
You can't get it to me today?

414
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,414
<i>I don't see how.</i>

415
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,792
How do you know
off the top of your head that you can't?

416
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,045
<i>It's already 3:30. By the time I get
the paperwork together and process,</i>

417
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,339
<i>- the bank won't even...</i>
- Okay! Fuck. Tomorrow.

418
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,051
- Tomorrow when?
<i>- By tomorrow evening.</i>

419
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,012
Tomorrow afternoon, okay?

420
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,932
- Let's say tomorrow afternoon.
<i>- Okay. I'll get it done.</i>

421
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,893
I want 400,000 in hundreds,
the rest in 20s.

422
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,854
Single bag. We can use
the same PI as last time.

423
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,357
Have him drop it off
outside the gate, okay?

424
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,776
Send me a confirmation email
by noon tomorrow.

425
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,571
Okay? You're going to give me
some nod of acknowledgment

426
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,935
that you heard one thing I said?

427
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,659
<i>- Yes. Okay. I'm on it.</i>
- Make it happen, April. Fuck!

428
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,828
Debbie, huh?

429
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,957
You're a real class act.

430
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,129
You don't fucking know me.

431
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,548
Go fuck yourself.

432
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,633
[moody music playing]

433
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,230
No knives.

434
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,578
[wife clears throat]

435
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,750
[wife sighs] What,
are we supposed to make small talk?

436
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,548
Well, I-I mean,
you guys could talk to each other.

437
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,386
- Or is that not something you're used to?
- Not at gunpoint, no.

438
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,973
It's not like we can ask you your name

439
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:24,103
or where you're from
or what you do, or did, for a living,

440
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,356
and, well, it's sunny out,
so the weather's covered.

441
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,194
Hobbies and favorite color
probably are safe.

442
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,571
Him, I've read plenty about.

443
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,908
But you're a mystery,
so why don't you start?

444
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,285
My favorite color's black.

445
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,368
I can tell.

446
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,457
What's this tattoo
you're getting removed on your foot?

447
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,627
[husband] How about
you stop looking at my wife's feet, yeah?

448
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,128
It was nothing.

449
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,048
[man] The tattoo was nothing?

450
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,718
That was one of the ugliest tattoos
I've ever seenÂ in my life.

451
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,888
Yeah, I know.
You've made that pretty clear.

452
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,474
[coughs, laughs]

453
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,600
Yikes.

454
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,730
Let's keep, uh, spinning this wheel.

455
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,065
How'd you two meet?

456
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,485
Honey?

457
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,032
Um, we met at a fundraiser.

458
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,368
- Cystic fibrosis.
- Muscular dystrophy.

459
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,371
Back when I was an assistant.

460
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,455
Ah.

461
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,081
Got it.

462
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,084
You were his assistant.

463
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,796
No. Not his assistant, an assistant.

464
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,381
The route most people take.

465
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,801
Unless, of course, you've made a fortune

466
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,886
or rob people in their homes.

467
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,180
Or work for your husband.

468
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,473
[wife] I work with him.

469
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,851
Okay, I head up our foundation,

470
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,104
a job I'm highly qualified for,
having worked for non-profits

471
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,480
since before college.

472
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,482
It's probably very similar,

473
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,152
except now you just have
all this money to play around with.

474
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,404
I'm not playing around with anything.

475
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,197
It'sâ€¦ It's not a game, okay?

476
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,283
And not that I have to justify
my resume to you,

477
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,286
but now I'm in charge of building
schools and hospitals

478
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,972
- on four continentsâ€¦
- You are justifying.

479
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,582
â€¦so you can try
and belittle what I do all you want,

480
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,000
but results speak for themselves.

481
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,335
And you can go ahead
and question my motives,

482
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,672
but at least I know what I'll be doing
for the next 4 or 5 years.

483
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,092
That's not exactly true.

484
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,803
You'll be taking on
more of an advisory role

485
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,888
once we have a baby.

486
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,266
Right, babe?

487
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,435
[clicks tongue] Right. That's the plan.

488
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,026
[gloomy music plays]

489
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,668
Did I or one of my companies do something

490
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,838
to harm or offend you personally
in some way?

491
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,552
It really feels like you hate me.

492
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,054
[man] Huh.

493
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:10,686
I don't fucking get it.
How can people be so mad at me?

494
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,399
It's like fucking being mad at
a fucking clock.

495
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,736
If you're mad at a clock,
that's really on you.

496
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,071
It's not about the clock.

497
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,702
I'm supposed to apologize for writing
an algorithm that was inevitable

498
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:32,959
and that saves companies and enriches
the lives of hundreds of employees?

499
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,252
[man laughs derisively]

500
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,463
- Did I say something funny?
- Yeah.

501
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:41,550
Hearing you talk about
enriching people's lives is funny to me.

502
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,427
[husband] Do I not do that?

503
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,723
You know,
it's really pretty fucking rudimentary.

504
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:51,978
A bloated, fat company dies,
all jobs lost.

505
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:56,148
Or a leaner, more efficient version
of that same company survives,

506
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,400
some jobs survive.

507
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:03,906
If anything, I'm helping people find
a new career path that's more sustainable.

508
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,909
But you, howeverâ€¦

509
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,539
You are here for the sole purpose
of enriching yourself.

510
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,292
[man] You have no idea what I'm here for,

511
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,377
or even if that money is just for me.

512
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,755
It's meaningless to you, anyway.

513
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,258
Money that could change
any other person's life.

514
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:27,722
I just doubt
you're going to give it all to the poor.

515
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,978
[gloomy music continues]

516
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,381
Hey, what is this?

517
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,217
- What does it look like?
- It's a Zen garden.

518
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,597
Just like the little ones you see
on people's desks, but big.

519
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,939
Last time I was here,

520
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:24,445
I had the idea of putting in
a Mr. Miyagi-style fence, so it's in.

521
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:25,946
Remember?

522
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,283
Yeah. I still don't know what that means.

523
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,078
A Mr. Miyagi-style fence.

524
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,885
All right, guys. What's, uh,
what's up next on the agenda?

525
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,641
What other shit
you have around here you don't use?

526
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,685
[horses neighing]

527
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,914
- [wife laughing]
- [horse neighs]

528
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,506
[wife laughs]

529
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,638
[actor gurgling on-screen]

530
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,139
[actor spits]

531
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,517
[brooding instrumental music playing]

532
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:12,928
Good work.

533
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,354
You need to get close to him, babe.

534
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,439
Win him over.

535
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,860
What? What are you...

536
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,862
We don't know this guy.

537
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,616
We don't know what he intends to do
once he gets the money.

538
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,496
So, you need to get close to him.
Do whatever it takes. Okay?

539
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,916
- I don't...
- Do whatever it takes. That's it.

540
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,584
You can do it.

541
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,171
[man] All right.

542
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,881
Either of you have a preference?

543
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,302
I still don't understand why you think
it's necessary to split us up.

544
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:57,473
Yeah. Well, like I said,
for my peace of mind.

545
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,643
Soâ€¦ why don't you go ahead and choose?

546
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,686
Babe?

547
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,606
- Do you have a preference?
- I-I don't care.

548
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,111
Why don't you take this one over here?

549
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,573
Not like either one of us
are going to sleep anyways.

550
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,037
Just remember, I'll be right over here
the whole night, okay?

551
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,498
Okay?

552
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:23,999
[wife sniffs]

553
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,501
Okay?

554
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,002
Yeah.

555
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,673
[man] Doors stay open.

556
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,475
- [husband] Shut the light off?
- [man] If it helps you.

557
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,601
[brooding music continues]

558
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,624
[fire crackling]

559
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,225
Can't sleep. [wife sighs]

560
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,812
Okay.

561
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,314
It's gonna be a long night.

562
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,153
Yeah.

563
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,949
Followed by a very long day.

564
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,330
[wife chuckles]

565
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,502
And the only man I know who could
fall asleep during his own kidnapping.

566
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,586
[chuckles]

567
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:20,175
I guess it's one of those "if you don't
laugh, you cry" moments, huh?

568
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,301
[clears throat]

569
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,554
Do you mind?

570
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,392
No. I don't mind.

571
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,856
[wife exhales]

572
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,776
[wife exhales]

573
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,659
Your life is gonna be
very different after tomorrow.

574
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,498
My life became very different the second
you two walked through the front door.

575
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,961
I was almost gone, too.

576
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,839
I was leaving.

577
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,552
Couldn't help myself.

578
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,641
What are you gonna do?

579
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:20,736
The end of the day,
everything being totally different,

580
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,029
that's okay with me.

581
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,826
- I get that.
- Oh. You do?

582
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,373
I think everyone feels that
at least once or twice in their life.

583
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,711
Do you?

584
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:42,382
There was a time I didn't know
what I wanted to do with myself,

585
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,759
like anybody else.

586
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,388
Then you found your purpose with him, huh?

587
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,850
He and I found it together.

588
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,353
Picture perfect.

589
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,480
Picture perfect.

590
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,232
That's great.

591
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,568
You guys are trying to have a kid?
That's what he said?

592
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,278
We are.

593
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:04,905
Congratulations.

594
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,493
That takes any relationship
to a whole new level.

595
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,417
Must be tricky if one person
is really rarin' to go

596
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,671
and the other person
isn't quite as ready, right?

597
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,548
Not my business, though.

598
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,091
No.

599
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,676
That's not my business at all.

600
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,763
Like we said, picture perfect.

601
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,475
What about you?

602
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,063
You said before we didn't know
if the money was just for you.

603
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,774
You're asking if I have a girlfriend?

604
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,819
Or if there's anyone.

605
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:44,903
Mm.

606
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,284
You don't have to answer, obviously.

607
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,869
Yeah. I'm not going to.

608
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,584
You want that?

609
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,544
[can pops]

610
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,221
[clears throat] It's a lot for you.

611
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,891
The, uh, the money that's coming.

612
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,268
It's a lot for anybody.

613
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,645
Should be.

614
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,818
The way he was able to get
that much cash together so quicklyâ€¦

615
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,781
He said it was
for another Debbie, didn't he?

616
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,291
You know what? Fuck it.

617
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:42,961
I'll take one. [sighs]

618
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,046
Oh.

619
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,676
That's good.

620
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,894
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

621
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,239
[sighs] I'm supposed to be so gratefulâ€¦

622
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,370
And just take everything in stride,

623
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,999
becauseâ€¦ look at my life,

624
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,752
and the good that I get to do.

625
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,297
But, uh, the truth is, Iâ€¦

626
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,217
I miss my old life.

627
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:36,598
[inhales] I miss my friends,
and I missâ€¦ feeling normal.

628
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,725
- Okay, I'm sorry. I just...
- And, um...

629
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,896
I'm sure you're a nice person,
but you're not some victim.

630
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,027
You're just a person who made a trade.

631
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:52,239
You know that, right?
You're just like the rest of us.

632
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,200
I knew I wasn't marrying just him.

633
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,832
I can rememberâ€¦

634
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,753
On my wedding day,
everyone was just waiting.

635
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,758
And I was standing there,
staring down at my feet.

636
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:17,597
And if I went forward,
if I walked down the aisle,

637
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:21,727
I knew exactly what would happen
in the next 30 or 40 years.

638
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,312
I knew.

639
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,400
And if I went back,
if I didn't walk down the aisle,

640
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,652
I-I wasn't sure what to expect.

641
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,823
But it would have been mine.

642
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,826
My choice and mine alone.

643
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,621
Maybe for the very last time.

644
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,710
I went forward.

645
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,630
But if I'm being honest, Iâ€¦

646
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,802
I didn't know if I would
until I took that very first step.

647
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,100
Well?

648
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,520
Well, what?

649
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,230
Was it worth it?

650
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,323
Ask me again in 30 or 40 years.

651
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,039
Umâ€¦ [sighs] â€¦all right, well,

652
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,209
I, uh, I should get some sleep.

653
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,009
Night.

654
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:18,844
[exhales]

655
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,438
[object scraping]

656
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,662
Thanks.

657
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,709
I'll take a Bloody Mary, too. Thanks.

658
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,386
Wrong side of the bed, love?

659
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,263
Was there a right side?

660
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:09,768
[sniffs]

661
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,156
[mysterious music playing]

662
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,752
So, what company was it?

663
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,506
[husband] Huh?

664
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,052
You can't help yourself, huh?

665
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:48,058
You were deemedâ€¦ redundant,

666
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,227
and let go.

667
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,645
That's it, right?

668
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,689
It's okay. You can tell me.

669
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,566
I know what you're trying to do.

670
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,276
Just drop it.

671
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,576
Now, I owe youâ€¦ something, right?

672
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,913
If you owe a debt,

673
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,415
it's to a hell of a lot more people
than just me.

674
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,169
Because of your little math equation,

675
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,588
people's jobs disappear
just like that. [snaps]

676
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:22,467
- Don't even have time to prepare.
- Prepare for what, exactly?

677
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,680
Ask the coal miners

678
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,641
if they're prepared for clean energy.

679
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:37,107
There's this new thing going around,
this new trendy mentality, you know, ofâ€¦

680
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:44,614
"I exist. So, therefore, you owe me."

681
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,118
Are you familiar with this?

682
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,872
That is the very reason why we live

683
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:59,087
in a world full of
lazy fucking loafers and freeloaders.

684
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:03,466
They're too busy
sitting, bitching, and moaning

685
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:08,305
that when they're confronted
with an obstacle, it's justâ€¦ [groans]

686
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,016
[morosely] "I guess that's it."

687
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,894
[cries mockingly]

688
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:20,275
But Iâ€¦ recognized the opportunity.

689
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:25,447
And I did something about it
every single fucking time.

690
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:30,618
I didn't ask anyone for anything,

691
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:34,664
and I didn't take anything
that wasn't fucking mine!

692
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,170
Not everyone who needs help
is a freeloader.

693
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:48,011
Babe, I was not referring
to you or your charity.

694
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,721
It was not a personal attack.

695
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,805
It is personal.

696
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,560
I needed help. Okay?

697
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,688
And you paid my student loans.

698
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,775
Am I a freeloader?

699
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,277
No.

700
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,616
No, because you don't
think like that, do you?

701
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,162
Do you?

702
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,042
[rumbling]

703
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,795
What the hell was that?

704
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,380
[man] Everybody, be quiet.

705
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,756
Don't say a fucking word.

706
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,345
It's the fucking gardener.

707
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,597
[suspenseful music playing]

708
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,015
Okay, get into the office.

709
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,185
Get into the fucking office right now!

710
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:40,687
Go.

711
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,022
Move!

712
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,986
Go. All the way to the back.

713
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,451
[breathing heavily]

714
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,655
You didn't say anything
about a gardener coming today.

715
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,830
We didn't know.

716
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:57,997
What's he doing here?

717
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,667
I don't know.
We don't deal with that kind of stuff.

718
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,216
[suspenseful music continues]

719
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,051
He's coming. He's coming.

720
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,388
Just... Everybody, be fucking quiet, okay?

721
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,517
[knocking at door]

722
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,063
[knocking]

723
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:29,320
- [knocking continues]
- He's just gonna keep knocking.

724
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,447
He sees our car.

725
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,408
Just... Will you give him
a chance to tire himself out?

726
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,576
[knocking continues]

727
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,459
[knocking continues]

728
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,003
- Want me to go talk to him?
- Yeah. Get rid of him.

729
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,088
[husband] Fucking fix everything.

730
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,550
Hey, we are this close.

731
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,344
Do not fuck this up for us, okay?

732
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,225
Hola.

733
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,103
[gardener] Hello, sir.

734
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,690
I'm so sorry to bother you.
I, uh, I saw thatâ€¦ that you're here.

735
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,276
Yes. We're here. How may I help you?

736
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:11,738
[gardener] Uh,
since you're not always here at home,

737
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:15,700
Iâ€¦ I wanted to be able
to say thank you myself.

738
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,410
You're very welcome.

739
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:21,372
It's such a pleasure
to, uh, work on such a beautiful property,

740
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:26,002
and I wanted to say to you
and to your wife, uhâ€¦ uh, gracias.

741
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,004
Ah, you're too kind.

742
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,965
And it's nice to meet you, see you...

743
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:34,177
- I don't mean to bother you...
- Gracias. I'll pass it along. No.

744
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,305
- You're welcome.
- Shut up.

745
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,683
Shut up. Go to the bedroom.
Both of you. Bedroom.

746
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,188
[loud whirring]

747
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,903
How long is this guy going to be here?

748
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,155
[husband] Until he's done, I suppose.

749
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,121
[loud whirring continuing]

750
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,440
[loud whirring stops]

751
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,000
Shit.

752
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,295
I think he saw me.

753
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,589
[knocking at door]

754
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:56,092
[husband laughing]

755
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:05,059
- Hello again.
- I'm-I'm so sorry to bother you again.

756
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,395
- Not at all. You remember my wife.
- Of course.

757
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,063
- SeÃ±ora.
- [wife] Hi. How are you?

758
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:14,611
And, uh, this is her cousin.
He just flew in from Portofino.

759
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:20,491
- It's nice you have family here.
- [husband] Yes. That's everything.

760
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,118
SeÃ±or, while you're here,

761
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,870
there's this one thing
I want to show you.

762
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,580
It would just take one minute.

763
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,374
- You know...
- No, how about we all go?

764
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,294
- [gardener] Oh. Okay, yes.
- Let's all go.

765
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:34,505
The more the better.
[gardener laughs] Follow me. This way.

766
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:39,052
- [husband] So, what are we looking at?
- I'll show you. Around the corner.

767
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,387
Uh, you must have had a really nice drive,

768
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,723
because the, uh, weather has been so nice.

769
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,517
- It was a beautiful...
- Hey, you know what, guys? Uhâ€¦

770
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,913
We just put food in the oven.
We have to get back inside.

771
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:52,190
That can wait.
What did you want to show me?

772
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,484
I don't know
if you've been able to see this,

773
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:58,863
but, uh, I designed and I-I built
and-and I put these planters here.

774
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:03,785
Uh, it took me 18 weeks,
but, uh, I think it was worth it.

775
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,913
Andâ€¦ next, I was imagining,

776
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,539
with your permission,

777
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:14,379
right here, a beautiful, beautiful
big oak tree, right in the center.

778
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:17,548
- [husband] Huh.
- I did do a little, simple sketch for you

779
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:20,176
to show you what, uh, my vision is. Uh...

780
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,305
It-It will take some time
for it to grow, of course,

781
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,224
but I was thinking that, you know,

782
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,601
this is not just something
for you to enjoy.

783
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,937
Your children
and your children's children.

784
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,021
Yeah.

785
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,316
Our children's children, baby. Wow.

786
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,901
- That's... Wow.
- [chuckles]

787
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:41,322
I think that's why I drew
myâ€¦ my kids right here by the tree.

788
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,449
- My boy and my girl.
- I see that.

789
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,660
And I showed this
to the landscape person,

790
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,953
but, um, you know...

791
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:50,748
So, you're telling me
that you designed all of this

792
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,125
and built this yourself?

793
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,668
- <i>SÃ­, </i>seÃ±or.
- Wow.

794
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:57,380
My friend, I have to say,
this is very impressive.

795
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,215
- Thank you, sir.
- Beautiful work.

796
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,174
It's very pretty.

797
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:03,094
Well, uh, if you like it,
maybe you can sign off on it.

798
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:07,681
Oh.

799
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,185
Just the, uh...

800
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:12,894
It's time to go inside.

801
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,856
- The tree...
- [wife] Food's ready, love.

802
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,232
- Right.
- Hey, now.

803
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,608
[husband] Right.

804
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,212
- In the middle...
- Thank you so much.

805
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,504
- We have to go.
- Let's go back.

806
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,822
There is one more thing on this side.

807
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,615
We're gonna have to do that later.

808
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,387
- Thank you. I'm sorry. [wife chuckles]
- [gardener] It will only take a minute.

809
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,412
Sorry.

810
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,377
[husband] You could learn something
from this guy, buddy.

811
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,463
[tense music playing]

812
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:43,342
He takes initiative,
he takes pride in what he does,

813
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,095
and he does it all
with a smile on his face.

814
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,179
Imagine that.

815
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:51,225
Guy's a go-getter.
He doesn't wait around for permission.

816
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:53,977
Hey.

817
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:55,855
Hey, buddy.

818
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,775
Got about eight hours left.

819
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:03,488
Should we play
some board games or charades or...

820
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,407
Hey, are you even listening to me, buddy?

821
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,536
Do you not hear me?

822
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,539
[tense music playing]

823
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,586
Wh-What should we do
for the next eight hours or so? Huh?

824
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,882
Hey, excuse me,
can I talk to you for a second?

825
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:24,758
Stop!

826
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,685
I can't let you.

827
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:53,830
[man] Shit!

828
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:57,458
Shit!

829
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,503
This is on you.

830
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,172
Not me. This is on you.

831
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,509
You break into my house
and it's somehow my fault?

832
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,220
- That's what you're saying?
- Why would you do that?

833
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:12,598
[husband exhales]
I don't know. He doesn't live here.

834
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,685
We don't know him.
Uh, I'm tired of looking at his face.

835
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:19,897
Umâ€¦ he has so many bright ideas,
maybe he decides he wants to tie us both

836
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,401
to a fucking orange tree, babe.
We don't know what he's going to do...

837
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,484
I would've left!

838
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:29,949
I don't believe him.

839
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,830
But my main priority is to my wife, okay?

840
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:36,914
[laughs]

841
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,083
Main priority?

842
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,546
You did something that jeopardized me

843
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,340
and him and him.

844
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,635
- [husband groans]
- All of us. You-You chose for all of us.

845
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,347
Okay. So, what are you suggesting?
That in that split second that it took

846
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:57,935
for me to scribble down this note
that I lean over and-and consult with you?

847
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:01,272
No, because you've never involved me
in any decision you've made.

848
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,565
What made this any different?

849
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:06,986
So, i-it's back to this.
I'm just a piece of shit, right?

850
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,154
I'm a piece of shit.

851
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,032
I'm just a piece of shit.

852
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:17,038
I-I make one calculated risk
to try and protect us...

853
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,665
Yeah. And how'd that work out for you?

854
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,586
The fuck is happening here?

855
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,967
Just hang tight, okay?
This will be over in a few hours.

856
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,641
What happens in a few hours?

857
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,352
He takes a lot of my money.

858
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:41,354
I'm so sorry.

859
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,285
[tense music playing]

860
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:05,688
[sighs]

861
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:34,216
Why do we keep pretending
that this guy is an actual threat?

862
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,302
[breathing heavily]

863
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:54,987
I'm going to leave now.

864
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,990
Hey! No, no, no, no.

865
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:01,202
Sit back down on the couch.
Hey. We're all tired.

866
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:03,412
I'm being nice to you right now. Sit down.

867
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:11,587
What is this, really?

868
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,255
Hmm?

869
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:15,716
Do you wanna be me?

870
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:17,468
Is that it?

871
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:23,224
Because let me fucking tell you,
it's not all it's cracked up to be.

872
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,434
Try being a rich white guy these days.

873
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,021
Everyone always thinks
it must be real fucking nice.

874
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,273
That's what you think, right?

875
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,860
But you have no idea

876
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,321
what I deal with every day.

877
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:40,533
There's a fucking permanent target
on my back,

878
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:46,622
and infinite nothing people out there
just waiting for me to fail.

879
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,374
Fucking sucks!

880
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,128
It's fucking pathetic.

881
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,964
Th-That's you, right?

882
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,465
You're pathetic.

883
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,092
Just leave him alone.

884
01:08:58,592 --> 01:08:59,593
[husband] What?

885
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,722
Just leave him alone.

886
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:04,807
Leave him alone?

887
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,394
This guy?

888
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:16,152
I've had to hold his hand
for the last 36 hours and help him rob me.

889
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:19,488
Why? Why?

890
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:23,117
Fucking why am I doing this? Enough!

891
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:27,413
He just wanted to know
what it was like to have a little power

892
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:30,166
in his fucking meaningless existence.

893
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:32,251
Oh, I just... I don't buy it.

894
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,669
You can't even act it.

895
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,254
It's really sad. Soâ€¦

896
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:41,302
- I'm going to walk out the door.
- Sit on the fucking couch now.

897
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,845
[menacing music playing]

898
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:45,055
[husband chuckling]

899
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:48,392
I just... I don't believe you.
I don't think you're going to do it.

900
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:52,605
I don't think you're going to do it now.
I don't think you're going to do anything.

901
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,149
Ever.

902
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:57,443
In your entire fucking life.

903
01:09:58,569 --> 01:09:59,570
Becauseâ€¦

904
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:03,949
- You listening?
- Just sit down on the fucking couch!

905
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,284
[husband] You listening?

906
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,368
Yeah?

907
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,078
You're nothing.

908
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:10,830
You hear that?

909
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,875
Say it. Nothing.

910
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:15,251
Nothing.

911
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:18,547
[gunshot]

912
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:21,675
[intense music playing]

913
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,761

914
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:24,844

917
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:37,899
Oh!

918
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:41,779
- [husband Oh, shit! Oh!
- [man] No, no, no, no. No.

919
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,949
- [man] He'sâ€¦
- [panting]

920
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,243
[husband] Oh!

921
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,080
[husband groans] Oh, shit!

922
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:54,166
No. No, no, no, no.

923
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,335
Fuck!

924
01:10:56,418 --> 01:11:01,173
- Okay. Okay. Oh, my God. Just don't move.
- [husband] Not fucking real. Not real.

925
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,133
Not real. It's not real.

926
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,802
- It's not real.
- Do something!

927
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,178
What? What? What?

928
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,223
I don't know! Just help me, please!
Come on, goddamn it!

929
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,809
Why would you run through
a glass fucking door?

930
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:13,894
No, no, no! Please!

931
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,981
- Hey, fucking help me!
- What the fuck do you want me to do?

932
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:18,899
Fuck!

933
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,529
The guy's fucking dead.

934
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,954
[somber music playing]

935
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:13,680
[breathing heavily]

936

[whimpering]

937
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,423
What happened was an accident.

938
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,050
It was a terrible thing.

939
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:54,680
And I know that you're feeling
the weight of it.

940
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:56,973
We all are.

941
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,769
But there's aâ€¦ a huge difference

942
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:05,524
between what just happened
and what you think you have to do next.

943
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,404
Please don't cross that line.

944
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:14,116
I-I-I can call someone right now

945
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,785
that handles this sort of thing.

946
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,955
I can fix a problem like this.
I can call someone right now.

947
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,834
- Let me call someone.Â Let me call someone.
- Hey. Hey. Look at me.

948
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,254
Look at me.

949
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,259
You're a good person.

950
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:35,095
I know.

951
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,514
I know that you're a good person.

952
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,642
But there's a step
that you haven't taken yet,

953
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:41,935
and if you do,

954
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,314
you'll never be the same again.

955
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:47,565
Trust me.

956
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:51,778
You're not a killer.

[car departing]

963
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,281
Money's here.

964
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,293
What are you doing?

965
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:50,671
You're going.

966

975
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:43,195
[husband] Babe?

976
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,201
Babe?

977
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,290
You okay in there?

978
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,126
Hello?

979
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:03,840
We're going to get out of here

980
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:07,844
and then we'll go wherever you want, babe.

981
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,055
We'll start over.

982
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,478
We could go to the vineyard
and renew our vows.

983
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:17,687
How 'bout that, huh?

984
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:20,565
You like that?

985
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,946
It's gonna be okay.

986
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,784
- Hello?
- [footsteps approaching]

987
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:31,868
[husband] Nothing?

988
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,093
Goodbye.

989
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:51,805
[wife] It was a rose.

990
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:54,516
I'm sorry, what?

991
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:57,143
My tattoo.

992
01:20:58,895 --> 01:20:59,896
It was a rose.

993
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:03,400
And I liked it.

994
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:09,990
I don't give a fuck.

995
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,542
[husband groaning]

996
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,151
[husband] Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

997
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,545
[tense music plays]

998
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:26,524
You were right.

999
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,448
I wanted to know
what it would feel like to be you,

1000
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:34,990
and so I came here.

1001
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:41,331
And then you showed up.

1002
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:49,005
And deep down,
I really wanted you to be good,

1003
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:52,425
because then at least
things might make sense.

1004
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,806
Life might feel more fair.

1005
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:00,100
And then I saw you,

1006
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:02,393
the real you,

1007
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,646
and you're so disgusting.

1008
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,275
I feel sick.

1009
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,905
And nothing feels fair.

1010
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:18,284
You have everything, and I have nothing!

1011
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,921
At least you're alone, though.

1012
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:31,631
So I get to have that.

1013
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:33,549
Right?

1014
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:35,468
I can pity you.

1015
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,514
You're always gonna be alone.

1016
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:44,477
Because I know something you don't know.

Hey!

Are you okay?

1036
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:13,399
What happened?

1037
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:15,819
Hey, babe!

1038
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:22,075
Did you just fucking kill him?

1039
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,704
You just fucking killed him.

1040
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:29,040
Didn't you?
