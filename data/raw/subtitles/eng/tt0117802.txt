25
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:34,109
So find yourself
somebody to love

26
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:42,553
- Okay, so what if l don't
want to give up on her?
- You don't call.

27
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:45,620
- You said l don't call if
l wanted to give up on her.
- Right.

28
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,758
- So l don't call either way.
- Right.

29
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:52,463
- So what's the difference?
- There is no difference right now.

30
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:55,598
See, Mike, the only difference
between giving up and not giving up...

31
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:58,302
is if you take her back
when she wants to come back.

32
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:00,971
But you can't do anything
to make her want to come back.

33
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:04,106
ln fact, you can only do stuff
to make her not want to come back.

34
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:08,017
So the only difference is
if l forget about her or just
pretend to forget about her.

35
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,954
- Right.
- Well, that sucks.

36
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:13,685
Yeah, it sucks.

37
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,059
So it's like a retroactive
decision then? l mean, l
could, like, forget about her.

38
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,463
And then when she comes back, make like
l just pretended to forget about her?

39
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,100
Right, although probably
more likely the opposite.

40
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,106
What do you mean?

41
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:31,109
l mean, at first you're gonna pretend
to forget about her.

42
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,611
Not call her,
l don't know, whatever.

43
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,943
But then, eventually,
you really will forget about her.

44
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,416
- Well, unless she comes back first.
- Mm, see, that's the thing.

45
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,386
Somehow they know not to come back
until you really forget.

46
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,717
- There's the rub.
- There's the rub.

talk about the same thing all the time.

- lt's just that, you know...
lt's just you been there, man.

- Your advice really helps.

l can talk to about her.

than that, all right?

though, the pit boss will see us,

he'll comp us all sorts of free shit;

about this. We're goin' to Vegas, man.

or otherwise l'm not going.

All right already, okay? l'll put my
suit on. Grab the wheel. Hold it steady.

beautiful babies here.

159
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,932
The beautiful babies don't work
midnights to 6:00 on a... on a Wednesday.

160
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,979
- This is the skank shift.
- Look at all the beautiful honeys here.

161
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:18,880
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, darling. l want you
to remember this face here.

162
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,818
This is the guy behind the guy
behind the guy.

163
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,417
Okay.

164
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:30,120
Will you cut that shit out?

165
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:32,857
- What? She smiled.
- That's not cool, man.

166
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,627
- Did she or did she not smile?
- lt doesn't matter.

167
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,760
- Mike, l'm telling you,
girls love that stuff.
- You're gonna screw up our plan.

168
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:42,466
- Baby, we're gonna get laid.
- Could we first see what happens
when we play it cool?

169
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,840
What do you think, Mike?
Do you think she's gonna leave us
and go tell her pit boss on us?

170
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,845
Will you stop makin' fun,
all right?

171
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:52,314
The trick is we gotta look
like we don't need the shit,
then they give us shit for free.

172
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,978
Right, right, right.
Well, l think you look great, man.

173
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:58,079
l think l'm looking like the money,
like the bomb, right?

174
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:01,819
All right, stop. See that? That, uh,
table? That's where we make our scene.

175
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:03,884
[Trent] You think
they'll notice me and you?

176
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:06,487
Oh, they're gonna notice me and you,
'cause they're watching.

177
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:09,725
- Nicely done, sir.
You're on a streak now.
- lt's about time.

178
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:14,261
One of the best streaks
l've ever had. l wanna get even.

179
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:22,112
Uh, start with, uh,
l don't know, 300?

180
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:40,355
l can count that
for you.

181
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:42,366
- On the table.
- Excuse me?

182
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:46,530
- You have to lay it on the table.
- l don't want to bet it all.

183
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,538
You're not allowed
to hand me money, sir.

184
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:51,803
You have to lay it on the table
if you want me to change it.

185
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:03,119
- Changing 300.
- [Man] Three hundred.

186
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:14,424
- Do you have anything smaller?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, l do.

187
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:17,764
But this happens to be
a $100 minimum bet table.

188
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,430
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable
at one of our lower stakes tables.

189
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,866
Okay, just tuck 'em under,
just like this.

190
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:27,878
There you go.

191
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,140
[Woman]
Cocktails?

192
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:33,343
Guy behind the guy.

193
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:35,784
l'll have a scotch
on the rocks, please.

194
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:38,516
Any scotch will do, as long
as it's not a blend, of course.

195
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,525
Uh, single malt.
Glenlivet, Glenfiddich perhaps.

196
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:43,618
Maybe a Glengow... Any Glen.

197
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:46,129
Scotch on the rocks.

198
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,575
- Double down.
- What?

199
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,848
You got an 11.
You always double down on an 11.

200
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,981
l know, but it's $200.
lt's blood money.

201
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:15,082
- Mike, you gotta double down.
- l can't double down.

202
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,185
- Mike, if you don't look like
you know what you're doing...
- Will you stop for a second?

203
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:19,526
- Just shut up, okay? l can't.
- lf you don't look like you
know what you're doing...

204
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,497
Just stop for a second!

205
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:24,057
[Arguing Continues]

206
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:25,932
Double down.

207
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,806
That's nice.

208
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,809
[Trent]
Eighteen. Good. Eighteen's good.

209
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:41,410
[Dealer]
Twelve. Sixteen.

210
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:47,149
Twenty-one.

211
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,125
l'm telling you, baby,
you always double down on an 11.

212
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:53,289
- Well, obviously not always.
- Always, baby.

213
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,628
l'm just saying not
in this particular case.

214
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,635
- You always double...
- l lost, okay?
How could you say "always"?

215
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:02,969
- [Dealer] Lady has 11.
What would you like to do?
- Um, l hit.

216
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,738
- Fifteen.
- l don't know what to do here.

217
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:09,177
l'll hit again.

218
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:11,181
Seventeen.

219
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,744
Okay. l'll hit there. Okay.

220
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,584
- Twenty-one.
- Oh, my gosh! Twenty-one!

221
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:21,454
l got it!
Oh, my heavens. Thank you!

222
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:23,517
Whee!

223
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:26,393
Would you like to have some breakfast
this morning, ma'am?

224
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:30,025
Oh, l really shouldn't. But then again,
it's a good idea. l'd love it.

225
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,262
- Thank you so much!
- Why not? By all means.

226
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,271
- Take this ticket in with you
when you go in.
- Oh, thank you!

227
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:36,273
- They'll fix you up.
- You'll fix me up.

228
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:43,010
That went plenty nice, baby.
You're up 20 bucks.

229
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,606
You know, l mean not counting
what happened on the first table.

230
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,878
- Thanks for clarifying that.
- l'm down too, Mike.

231
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:51,353
- Yeah? What'd you lose?
- l don't know what l dropped.

232
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,788
Let's see, l dropped
probably 35 or...

233
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:57,123
Don't give me that shit. You know
exactly what you lost. What'd you drop?

234
00:14:57,195 --> 00:15:00,790
Twenty, all right? But l was
down at least fifty. l'm sorry.
l got lucky on the craps table.

235
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:03,561
You shouldn't be sorry.
You're a winner. l'm the fuckin' loser.

236
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:05,899
- l'm the one who should be sorry.
- Baby, don't talk that way.

237
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,063
Could we just go, please?
Could we go?

238
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,073
Baby, look at me. Look at me.

239
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:13,076
You're money. And you know what else?
You're a big winner tonight.

240
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,078
- l want to leave.
- You're a big winner.

241
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:17,910
l'm gonna ask you a simple question,
and l want you to listen to me.

242
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:22,248
Who's the big winner
here tonight at the casino? Huh?

243
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,811
- Mikey, that's who.
Mikey's the big winner.
- Okay.

244
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,823
- Mikey wins.
- What a fuckin' asshole.

245
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:29,758
Fine, l'm an asshole.
But you know what?
You're the big winner tonight, Mikey.

246
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:31,954
- You're the big winner
in more ways than one.
- There you two are.

247
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,431
l walked around for an hour
with that stupid scotch on my tray.

248
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,968
We got knocked out pretty fast.

249
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,266
- Ah, a couple of
high rollers like yourself?
- Can you believe it?

250
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:42,670
- l'm gonna get you that scotch.
- You know, forget about it.

251
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,334
- l didn't even want it.
l just wanted to order it.
- Can l get you something else?

252
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,538
l mean, you really shouldn't leave
without getting something for free.

253
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,547
Why ruin a perfect night?

254
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:53,607
Listen, um, bring a single-malted,
uh, Glengarry for me...

255
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,619
and one
for my boy Mikey here.

256
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:58,747
And if you tell the bartender
to go easy on the water,

257
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:03,226
then this 50-cent piece has your
name written all over it, okay?

258
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,558
l want you to run along,
'cause l'll be timing you.

259
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,158
l'm gonna keep time.
One, two, three, four.

260
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:13,567
- What an asshole.
- Baby, that was money.
Tell me that wasn't money.

261
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,902
- That was so demeaning.
- She smiled, baby.

262
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,909
- l can't believe
what an asshole you are.
- No, baby, she smiled.

263
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:21,912
- She was smiling at
what an asshole you are.
- No, no, no, no, no.

264
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,574
- She was smiling at how money
l was, what l did with her.
- Could we get out of here?

265
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:27,584
- l'm not gonna pay for a room.
- Mike, what the hell do you
want to get out of here for?

266
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:30,086
- The honey baby's
bringing us a cocktail.
- What, are you nuts?

267
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,520
- You think she's coming back here?
- l know she's coming back.

268
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,525
Did you hear what she said?
"You shouldn't leave without
getting something for free."

269
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:38,494
Baby, she wants to party.
She wants to.

270
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:40,497
l'm tired. We should just go.

271
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:43,693
Baby, this is what we came for. Now, we
met a beautiful baby, and she likes you.

272
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:46,760
- She likes you.
- Whatever. Daddy's gonna
get her to bring a friend.

273
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:50,001
Now, l don't care if l end up with her
or one of her beautiful baby friends.

274
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:55,910
lt's just l been... l been out
of the game for so long, man.

275
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,939
- lt's been like six years.
- Listen, it's hard, l know.
l been there myself.

276
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,153
Not for six years or anything,
but l've been there.

277
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:03,085
Not for six years or anything,
but l've been there.

278
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:05,748
The best thing you can do
is just get back out there.

279
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:09,884
lt's just l... l'm not attracted to them.
l keep thinking of my girlfriend.

280
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,895
Then l'm trying to, like,
maintain a conversation with them.

281
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:16,729
Mike, do you even think l know
what the hell they're saying
to me half the time?

282
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,234
l don't know if they're talking
about how hard it is to be adopted...

283
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:21,737
or how their dad
can't show 'em affection.

284
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:25,263
All l do, man, is stare at their mouth
and wrinkle my eyebrows,

285
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:27,970
and somehow l turn out
to be a big sweetie, okay?

286
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:31,572
Take this girl here.
She's a waitress in Las Vegas.

287
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:35,585
But l bet somewhere inside of her
there is a very, very special dream.

288
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:38,087
- And no matter how hard l try, l won't...
- [Waitress Clears Throat]

289
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,988
Hey, there she is, the most
special lady in town, right?

290
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:43,424
- Yup.
- What time do you get off, uh, Christy?

291
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:45,428
- 6:00.
- 6:00, great.

292
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:48,863
- Two Glengarrys down,
easy on the water.
- Fantastic.

293
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,925
Uh, listen. Why don't you call a friend
and have her meet the three of us...

294
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:54,527
- at the Bamboo Lounge at 6:01?
- You got it.

295
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:57,665
- All right?
- Sure. Hey.

296
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:03,507
That was so fuckin' money.
That was like the Jedi mind shit.

297
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:06,379
See, that's what l'm trying to tell you,
baby. Girls love that kind of stuff.

298
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,418
They don't go
for the sensitive shit.

299
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:11,886
You start talking to 'em about, uh,
you know, puppy dogs and ice cream.

300
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:15,392
They know what you want to do.
What do you think?
You really think they don't know?

301
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:18,223
- No. l know.
- They know what you want,
baby. Believe me.

302
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,729
When you pretend it's just
like a waste of their time.

303
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,131
You're gonna take 'em
that way eventually, right?
Don't apologize for it.

304
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:28,103
lt's just that l get this thing
where l want to be a gentleman
and l wanna show respect.

305
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:30,697
Oh, Mike.
Respect, my ass.

306
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:32,799
What they respect is honesty.

307
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:36,744
Look, you see how they dress
when they go out, right?
They want you to notice 'em.

308
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:40,011
All you're doin' is letting
them know that it's working.
Get off this respect kick.

309
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:43,053
There's nothing wrong with letting
the girls know that you're money...

310
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,521
- and that you wanna party.
- You ready to order?

311
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,616
Yeah. l'll have a coffee...
Two, uh, two coffees.

312
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:52,321
And it says, uh, here,
"Breakfast anytime."

313
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:54,762
That's right.

314
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:58,632
l'll have the, uh, pancakes and the,
uh, age of enlightenment, please.

315
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:01,296
And for you?

316
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:05,832
Oh, um, let's see,
l'll have the, um, the Toucan.

317
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:08,434
- Over easy.
- l'll be back with the coffee.

318
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,707
All right, great.
Nice, baby.

319
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:13,045
Renaissance.
lt went over her head.

320
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:15,711
l should have said renaissance.
Age of enlightenment. l...

321
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:20,052
Oh, God! Like a Las Vegas
waitress is gonna get an obscure
French philosophical reference?

322
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:22,422
lt's like l'm trying
to show off to her.

323
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:25,360
l may as well have just said,
"Let me jump your ignorant bones."

324
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:27,897
Don't even sweat her.
We're gonna meet our honeys soon.

325
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:30,661
- You know Christy's friend
is gonna be money.
- lt's 20 to.

326
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:34,067
- We gotta get out of here.
- Baby, will you relax
just for a minute here?

327
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:37,198
Excuse me. We have...
We're in a little bit of a hurry.

328
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:39,208
Hang on, Voltaire.

329
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:55,715
- l get paid for loving
- Hmm

330
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:58,091
Loving all the time

331
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,289
[Chattering]

332
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:02,298
- How're you doin', guys?
- Hey, boys.

333
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,926
- We almost gave up on you.
- l'm sorry we're late.

334
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:08,096
- There's, uh, no clocks
in this town anywhere.
- No harm done.

335
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:10,106
- This is Lisa.
- Hi.

336
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:12,608
- l'm sorry. l never got your name.
- l'm Mike.

337
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:15,110
- Mike.
- This is Trent. We call him Double Down.

338
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,113
- Trent.
- Stop right there.

339
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,945
- Ladies, don't you always
double down on an 11?
- Always.

340
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:21,951
- No matter what. Like splitting aces.
- Whatever.

341
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:24,647
- Hi, Lisa. l'm Trent.
lt's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

342
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:26,656
Lovely, uh, make-up job
you have there.

343
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:29,420
- Oh. Uh, Lisa works at the MGM Grand.
- l'm a Dorothy.

344
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:32,291
Oh, Lisa's a Dorothy.
That's great. That's great.

345
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:37,833
Well, we're not
in Kansas anymore.

346
00:20:41,705 --> 00:20:45,141
So, uh, what do
you guys do?

347
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,769
Well, l'm a comedian.

348
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:50,279
[Laughs]

349
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,076
Um, do you ever play out here?
l'd love to see you sometime.

350
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:58,087
- No.
- Why not?

351
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:01,647
Well, there are, uh... You know,
it's just different circuits.

352
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:04,660
- lt's hard to explain.
You wouldn't understand.
- Who's your booking agent?

353
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:07,561
[Panting]
She... She knows...

354
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,930
Actually, l don't have
West Coast representation as of yet.

355
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:13,697
Oh, who's your representation
back East?

356
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:17,935
l didn't... l sort of freelanced on
my own, kind of found my own things.

357
00:21:18,008 --> 00:21:20,306
- 'Cause l...
- So what do you do, Trent?

358
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:23,346
- l'm a producer.
- Oh! Cool!

359
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:25,348
[Whispers]
That's great.

360
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,680
[Christy] l'm really
not supposed to drink here.

361
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:32,313
We should go someplace else.
How's my place?

362
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:34,619
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah?

363
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:37,626
- All right?
- Yeah, we... Yeah, sure.

364
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:40,458
- Right.
- Because if you can't drink here...

365
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:42,465
- Then you can't drink.
- Why not?

366
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:45,468
- That'll be great.
- Okay, great. Let's go.

367
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:48,594
[Christy]
You were in Acapulco Beach?

368
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,163
[Lisa]
We watch that all the time.

369
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:54,404
- No, no, no, no, wait.
- [Trent] Yeah, yeah.

370
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:58,244
The worst was when l went in for
this Afterschool Special, right?

371
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:00,545
So l'm sitting
in the waiting room,

372
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:03,711
and there's all these little kids, uh,
sitting in the waiting room with me.

373
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:06,688
And l see that all the kids are signed
in for the exact same role as me.

374
00:22:06,757 --> 00:22:09,658
- They're auditioning for
the same role as you?
- Right.

375
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:13,924
So, uh, l check the time and the place.
l'm where l'm supposed to be.

376
00:22:13,997 --> 00:22:17,831
l call my agent up. She says, "Trent,
they asked for you specifically."

377
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,631
- What was the thing?
- l don't know what it was.
lt was "Drugs are Bad."

378
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:23,434
"Jenny Eats Something." Whatever.
lt's Afterschool Special bullshit.

379
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:25,441
- Right. [Giggles]
- "Jenny Eats Something."

380
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:29,275
The role l'm reading for is "brother."
l'm reading for the part of "brother."

381
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:31,871
Big brother
or little brother?

382
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:35,112
- Just brother, man. Just brother.
- No.

383
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:37,949
Just brother, right? Finally l get
to go in and meet everyone, right?

384
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:40,216
Mikey, l'm telling you,
l was money.

385
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,485
lt's a starring role.
l practiced for a week.

386
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,290
So l'm reading with the casting director
and, girls, l literally start crying.

387
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:48,297
- No.
- l swear to God.

388
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:50,629
The casting director who's reading with
me kinda gets caught up in the vibe.

389
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,635
- She starts crying.
- Oh!

390
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:55,467
- Yeah, l swear to God. Swear to God.
- Wow.

391
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,565
So now she's crying.
l'm crying.

392
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:02,476
We're both kinda crying, but not
the kind of crying that's like...

393
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:05,071
But the kind of crying that's
like we're trying not to cry.

394
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:08,413
Do you know what l mean? Like we're not
trying to... Whatever. lt was very cool.

395
00:23:08,485 --> 00:23:11,215
So l finished reading with her.

396
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:14,086
l finally hold up my finger,
like give me a minute here.

397
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:16,091
- Right.
- [Choking Up] Like give me a minute.

398
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,595
More than that, 'cause l'm in it.
But like l'm broke.

399
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:23,759
[Sobbing] Give me a second here.
May l have a minute?

400
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:27,930
So l put down my head,
and the whole room sits in silence...

401
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:29,939
for at least five minutes.

402
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,941
- Swear to God, five minutes.
- Whoa!

403
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:34,307
l look up, everyone
rips up in applause.

404
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:38,109
The whole room is rip-roaring clapping
it up for me, for big T, right?

405
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:42,811
Everyone in the room is sitting
there tearing their face.
They're crying their eyes out.

406
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:46,117
The guy working the camera, you know,
just filming it? Got tears in his eyes.

407
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:49,124
- Not the camera guy.
- l swear to God, the camera guy.

408
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:52,286
Not so much from my reading,
although it had a lot to do with it,

409
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:54,489
but, really, he had
his own things going on.

410
00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:57,033
So the producer
starts to talk to me.

411
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,898
He says, "Trent, when you
walked in this room,

412
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,734
l didn't see Trent Walker
come in here."

413
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:06,037
He said, "l saw big brother
come in here." Fuckin' great, right?

414
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,703
He says, "You walked in with the role,
you nailed it, you're great."

415
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:11,612
- So give me the fuckin' part.
- Exactly. Right?

416
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:16,585
Then he says to me... He says,
"Trent, l gotta be honest with you.

417
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:20,749
l think that it might be that
you may be just a little bit old...

418
00:24:20,824 --> 00:24:23,315
for the role of brother."

419
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:25,918
So l felt confident,
'cause l gave a good read.

420
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:28,931
l say to him, "Well, how old exactly
is the role of brother?"

421
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,933
- [Mike] Here it comes.
- 'Cause l'm tall.

422
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:33,435
- Here it comes.
- But l look young, Mike.
Do l look young, girls?

423
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:35,528
Yeah, you do.

424
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:38,598
So he says to me... l swear to God he
says this to me with a straight face.

425
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:42,812
This fucking guy.
"Eleven years old."

426
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:44,880
- And you said "double down."
- Double down.

427
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,246
Because you know why? Because you
make it happen on the bets.

428
00:24:47,316 --> 00:24:49,250
He's great, isn't he?

429
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:52,776
But the truth of the matter was,
you saw my picture, you saw my tape.

430
00:24:52,855 --> 00:24:55,653
You know l'm 24 years old.
Why did you call me in?

431
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:58,420
- Wow.
- That's your great bit.

432
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:02,260
Well, we all have stories.

433
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:04,265
- Wow.
- Yup.

434
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:17,143
Uh, how rude of me. l never...
l never gave you the... the tour.

435
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:32,293
[Rock]

436
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:34,295
[Giggles]

437
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:43,330
Come on home, girl
He said with a smile

438
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:47,739
You don't have to love me
and let's get high a while

439
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,611
But try to understand
Try to understand

440
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:55,707
- Ohh
- l'm gonna check on my boy.

441
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:59,117
Ohh, try

442
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:01,281
Try to understand

443
00:26:01,357 --> 00:26:05,487
Try, try
Try to understand

444
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:08,257
He's a magic man

445
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:16,261
l'm sure she'll call.

446
00:26:16,338 --> 00:26:18,568
l mean, six years
is a long time.

447
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:21,735
- You don't just break it off
cleanly after six years.
- But she did.

448
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,745
- And she's with somebody else now.
- Already?

449
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:27,976
- Yeah.
- Oh, you poor thing.

450
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,746
- You know what? lt won't last.
- Why not?

451
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:34,755
- lt's a rebound.
- We were a rebound
and we lasted for six years.

452
00:26:34,823 --> 00:26:40,056
Well, yeah, but how long was the
relationship she was rebounding from?

453
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:42,757
Six years.

454
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:45,265
Uh, can l check
my messages real quick?

455
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:48,269
- l have a calling card.
lt won't cost anything.
- Yeah.

456
00:26:48,337 --> 00:26:50,601
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, sure. The phone's in the back.

457
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:53,107
- l'm not ruining tonight, am l?
- No, it's okay.

458
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:55,268
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Oh, l understand.

459
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:57,278
- l'm sorry.
- lt's okay.

460
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,854
T.

461
00:27:07,923 --> 00:27:09,857
Trent.

462
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,461
Trent.

463
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,226
l need to, uh, u...

464
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:22,498
No. l gotta... l gotta use...
l gotta use the phone.

465
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:26,667
- You can check 'em tomorrow.
- l need to use the phone.

466
00:27:26,742 --> 00:27:29,575
Okay? l'm sorry.

467
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,579
Hold on.

468
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:37,413
l'm sure l... They weren't
in there that long.

469
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:40,580
l don't think we're
interrupting anything.

470
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:44,919
[Exhales]

471
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:49,430
l have a calling card.

472
00:27:49,498 --> 00:27:53,229
So it's a 800...
it's a 800 number.

473
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:06,843
- [Dial Tone]
- [Beeping]

474
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:10,874
- Six years? Oh, poor thing.
- l know.

475
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:12,887
- And you know what he said?
- What? What?

476
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:14,889
- And l believe him.
- What?

477
00:28:14,957 --> 00:28:18,893
- He said, "l just want her to be happy."
- He said that?

478
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:21,794
- lt's so sweet. So sweet.
- That is so sweet.

479
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:24,230
- Oh.
- l know.

480
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,291
l'll make some coffee.

481
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:30,065
- [Drapes Being Drawn]
- Mmm.

482
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,908
[Both Chuckle Nervously]

483
00:28:47,489 --> 00:28:50,720
[Women Whispering]

484
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:52,556
Did she call?

485
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:58,056
- [Christy] Oh!
- Oh, Mike, l'm so...

486
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,829
Oh, God.

487
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:04,532
That's so bad. l'm sorry.

488
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:08,835
[Lisa]
lt's gonna be okay.

489
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:13,041
She asked me what l was thinking about.
Did you want me to lie?

490
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:16,209
You didn't have to
get into it, baby.

491
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,378
l'm sorry about
interrupting you guys.

492
00:29:18,454 --> 00:29:21,981
Oh, don't worry about it. l just wanted
you to have a good time, that's all.

493
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:25,959
- Christy was nice.
- Yeah, l really didn't like
her that much, to be honest.

494
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:29,987
- Why not?
- l don't know, man. She just...
She didn't really do it for me.

495
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:35,002
What'd you think of that,
uh, Dorothy girl?

496
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,062
The whole Judy Garland thing
kinda turned me on.

497
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,735
- Does that make me some kind of a fag?
- No, baby, you're money.

498
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:48,750
- l don't think she liked me anyway.
- Mike, l'm tellin' you, man.

499
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:51,911
- She thought you were money.
- l don't think so.

500
00:29:51,987 --> 00:29:55,081
l heard 'em both talking.
Both those girls thought you were money.

501
00:29:55,157 --> 00:29:57,751
You're a good friend.

502
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:02,097
Look, you take yourself
outta the game.

503
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:04,758
You start talkin' to 'em
about puppy dogs and ice cream,

504
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:08,030
of course it's going to end up
on the friendship tip.

505
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:10,037
l just don't think
she liked me in that way.

506
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:12,869
Baby, you are so money,
and you don't even know it.

507
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:17,435
Look, T, the girls don't go for me
the way they go for you, okay?

508
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:19,913
- Michelle went for you, right?
- That's different.

509
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:22,951
- Why? How is that different?
- We were younger. lt was college.

510
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:25,953
You didn't go to college.
You don't know how it is.
The girls are young, they drink.

511
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:29,957
- They don't know any better.
- Do you know how stupid that sounds?

512
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:34,962
Listen to me. Your self-esteem
is low right now because
she's with somebody else.

513
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,796
But talkin' about it and thinkin' about
it all the time, it's depressing.

514
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:42,359
lt's no good, man.

515
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:44,371
l just need
a little more time.

516
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:47,567
Why, so you can sit around your stuffy
apartment beating yourself up over it?

517
00:30:47,643 --> 00:30:51,409
- Remember the first week
after she told you?
- Don't remind me.

518
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,541
Huh? Couldn't even
leave your place.

519
00:30:55,617 --> 00:30:58,745
You know, you just sat around
your stuffy apartment,

520
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,654
sitting there, drinking orange juice,
feeling sorry for yourself.

521
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:06,091
Now look at you, man. Right?
l mean, you got a part in a movie.

522
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:08,755
- A day.
- Whatever, Mike.
lt's work. You understand?

523
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:13,199
You're doing what you love to do.
What the hell is she doing now?

524
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:16,260
Selling scrap metal.

525
00:31:16,338 --> 00:31:19,671
Okay. And this guy she's seeing,
what the hell does he do?

526
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:22,232
- [Mumbling] He drives a carriage.
- What?

527
00:31:22,311 --> 00:31:25,872
l heard he drives a carriage
around Central Park or something.

528
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:29,884
Oh, Mike, please! You're
the fun-lovin', outgoing party guy,

529
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:31,687
and you're sweatin'
some lawn jockey.

530
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:32,881
and you're sweatin'
some lawn jockey.

531
00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:35,923
Jesus Christ!
l'm tellin' you, man.

532
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:39,722
You're better off without this girl.
You gotta trust me on this, Mike.

533
00:31:39,795 --> 00:31:43,287
- All right, buddy?
- Stop talking. Shut up.

534
00:31:43,365 --> 00:31:47,529
Okay, l'm gonna try. l promise you l
will shut up if you shut the hell up.

535
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:50,537
- We're gonna make this work.
- You're damn right you're gonna try.

536
00:31:50,605 --> 00:31:53,472
- [Engine Revving]
- Let's get home.

537
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:57,740
- l'm a man of means by no means
- Los Angeles.

538
00:31:57,813 --> 00:32:00,111
King of the road

539
00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:04,846
l know every engineer
of every train

540
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,219
All their children
and all of their names

541
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,317
And every handout
in every town

542
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:16,057
Every lock that ain't locked
when no one's around

543
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:19,166
l seen trailers
for sale or rent

544
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:21,600
- [Rob] l don't think
l'm gonna take it.
- Look, it's a gig.

545
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,604
This is definitely
a step back for me.

546
00:32:23,672 --> 00:32:26,106
There's not much of a call
for Shakespeare in this town.

547
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:28,608
There's just something
about being Goofy, all right?

548
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:32,511
Any other Disney character would
be fine. Mickey? Mickey's an icon.

549
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:35,948
- Why does it have to be Goofy?
- What do you want? You're tall.

550
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:38,611
How am l gonna
tell my parents?

551
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:41,383
l still haven't told them
l didn't get the series.

552
00:32:41,456 --> 00:32:43,947
You tested over a month ago.
l'm sure they figured it out.

553
00:32:44,025 --> 00:32:47,620
lt's like, "Mom, hi.
l didn't get that pilot.

554
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:51,325
By the way, l'm Goofy.
Send more money."

555
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:08,548
[Taps Ball]

556
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,853
Hey, Rob.

557
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:17,315
You notice l didn't
mention her once today.

558
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:21,021
- l didn't want to say anything.
- Oh, yeah? Why?

559
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:24,827
Ah, it's kind of like
not talking to your pitcher
in the middle of a no-hitter.

560
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,392
- What do you mean? Like you
didn't want to jinx it?
- Kinda.

561
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,938
- l don't talk about her that much.
- [Laughing]

562
00:33:31,006 --> 00:33:33,440
- l didn't mention her once today.
- Tend the pin.

563
00:33:33,508 --> 00:33:36,602
The only reason l mentioned her
at all was to tell you l'm not
gonna talk about her anymore.

564
00:33:36,678 --> 00:33:39,374
- l thought you'd appreciate that.
- l do. Good for you, Mikey.

565
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:45,118
- Get there.
- Play it out.

566
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:48,850
- l decided to get back out there.
- Good. Glad to hear it.

567
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:52,451
- Can't make any more excuses for myself.
- Excellent.

568
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:57,129
- [Sighs]
- Do you wanna hit the town tonight?

569
00:33:57,199 --> 00:34:00,362
Uh, l shouldn't.
lt's a weeknight.

570
00:34:00,435 --> 00:34:05,134
- You got a Pluto callback?
- Yeah, kick me when l'm down.

571
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:08,176
- All right. Count 'em up.
- How many strokes?

572
00:34:08,243 --> 00:34:10,575
One, two, three...

573
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:16,917
- Eight, nine.
- What'd you get?

574
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:19,419
- Eight or a nine.
- l'll give you an eight.

575
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:21,819
- What did you get?
- l got an eight.

576
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:25,257
Dead heat after one hole.
lt's turning into quite a rivalry.

577
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:28,854
You better replace the pin, Chi Chi.
The natives look restless.

578
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:32,760
- [Computer Game]
- [Man] You bitch! You bitch!

579
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:35,428
- [Trent] Chelios steals to Roenick.
- [All Groaning]

580
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:37,767
- [Trent] Money!
- Bitch!

581
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,932
[Mike] Sue, why is
Gretzky on his ass again?

582
00:34:40,008 --> 00:34:43,603
- Gretzky's a little bitch.
- God, this is such bullshit, man.
This is bullshit!

583
00:34:43,678 --> 00:34:46,476
[Mike] The Kings suck in this game.
You should play another team.

584
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:49,949
- l took the Kings to the Cup.
- Yeah, against the computer
with the offsides off.

585
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:53,112
- They're a finesse team, bro.
- They're a fuckin' bitch team.
Score... Oh!

586
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:55,782
You bitch!
What a fuckin' bitch!

587
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:57,916
- Watch out, motherfucker.
- No, you do not fuckin' hit my elbow.

588
00:34:57,993 --> 00:35:00,484
[Trent] lt's not even so much me
as it's Roenick. He's good.

589
00:35:00,562 --> 00:35:02,427
[Sue]
Oh, is that right?

590
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:04,965
- Chelios steals to Roenick.
- [Sue] You bitch!

591
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,433
Score Chicago! Ohh!

592
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:09,436
- That was pretty.
- Such fuckin' bullshit!

593
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:12,064
But that was pretty, Sue.
Check this out on the instant replay.

594
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,506
- Dude, do not...
- You said it was fuckin' bullshit.
Check it out.

595
00:35:14,576 --> 00:35:17,374
- Look at it!
- [Both Arguing]

596
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:19,379
- Look at it!
- l don't want to!

597
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:22,507
Why do you think they put
the instant replay in the fucking game?

598
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:24,984
- God, you're unbelievable.
- So you can see if it's bullshit.

599
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:28,853
- l am unbelievable. Look at it.
- Every goal you're gonna watch
the instant replay?

600
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:30,858
- Come on, man, l want to fuckin' play.
- l want him to learn it.

601
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:32,917
- l never get to play.
- You should practice this
when l'm not here.

602
00:35:32,994 --> 00:35:35,428
- Just fuckin' move it.
- When l'm not here,
will you practice this?

603
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:37,590
- Wa, wa, wa, wa.
- We'll play some more.
He likes to get scored on.

604
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:39,759
- Set the game up.
- Great times.

605
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:43,270
[Phone Ringing]

606
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:45,431
- Yeah?
- Better play defense.

607
00:35:45,507 --> 00:35:48,601
Okay. Yeah, it's on the fourth floor.
The elevator's broken, okay?

608
00:35:48,677 --> 00:35:51,111
Dude, it's Pink Dot.
Would you buzz him in? Hit nine.

609
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:53,943
l wish they still had fights in
this game so l could bitch-slap Wayne.

610
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:56,347
- They don't have fighting anymore?
- Doesn't that suck?

611
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:58,750
Why'd they get rid of the fighting?
lt's the best part of the old version.

612
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,845
Kids were hitting each other
or something, man.

613
00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:03,186
But you know what, Mike? You can
make their heads bleed on this one.

614
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:05,419
- Make somebody's head bleed.
- No, we're in play-offs.

615
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:08,724
l'm gonna make Wayne Gretzky's head
bleed for super fan number 99 here.

616
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:11,493
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Mikey, get the door?

617
00:36:11,566 --> 00:36:13,761
- Yeah, give me some money.
- Why do l have to give you money?

618
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:16,599
Give me some fuckin' money.
l'm not paying again.

619
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:19,367
Jesus Christ.
Pause the game.

620
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:22,239
- Dude, l'm about to do
my thing with the thing.
- Pause the game!

621
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,244
- l got fuckin' Wayne.
- Pause it!

622
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:27,748
All right, l'll pause it.
Jesus Christ. Like you scored all day.

623
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,411
- How much do you want?
- Just give me some money.

624
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:35,320
Okay, fine. Take my last 20.
Here. Jesus fucking Christ.

625
00:36:37,092 --> 00:36:39,720
There it is, Mikey! Check it out.
His head's bleeding.

626
00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:42,888
Mikey, check it out. His legs... Little
Wayne's legs are shaking all over.

627
00:36:42,964 --> 00:36:46,331
- Fucking bitch!
What did you do that for?
- You're the fucking bitch!

628
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:49,598
- What the fuck are you...
Why did you un-pause it?
- Come on, man.

629
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:52,265

Look at you. Look at you.

631
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,069

632
00:36:57,145 --> 00:36:59,079

00:36:59,147 --> 00:37:01,809
- Get the fuck off me!
- You're fuckin' makin' me sick!
You want to kiss me!

634
00:37:01,883 --> 00:37:06,149
Hey, hold still. Hold on. lt's
the fuckin' Pink Dot guy. Hold on.

635
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:09,657
[Trent]
Hey, Mikey! Mikey, is he cute?

636
00:37:09,724 --> 00:37:12,750
- [Sue] ls he brown?

and join us for a cocktail.

637
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:14,761
- ls he polite?
- ls he a brown man?

638
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:17,730
lf he's polite, have him come in. lf
he's polite, let him in. ls he clean?

639
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:20,893
Have him come look.
Have him take off his shoes.

640
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:23,233
Michael, is he clean?
l want to see him!

641
00:37:23,304 --> 00:37:27,138
Michael, l want to see him.
Don't let him go! Don't let him go.

642
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,733
Get off. l'm serious.
Don't fuckin' do that shit.

643
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:33,076
Oh, he got away from us.
l'm sorry, Michael. Was he nice?

644
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:38,245
You guys are assholes.
Eat, eat, you fuckin' jackals.

645
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:40,480
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice.

646
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:42,921
- What time is the party tonight?
- lt starts at 8:00.

647
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:45,585
- Everybody'll get there around 10:00.
- So, what, 11:00?

648
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,855
- Midnight.
- Midnight.

649
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:51,626
l'm gonna bring an old friend
from back home. He just moved out here.

650
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:53,633
- Who, Rob?
- Yeah, you know him.

651
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:56,135
Yeah, he's cool.
You'll like him. He's a rounder, Rob.

652
00:37:56,204 --> 00:37:58,434
- What does he do?
- Uh, he's trying to be an actor.

653
00:37:58,506 --> 00:38:00,770
- What a surprise.
- How novel.

654
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:04,369
[Rob]
So the party started at 8:00.

655
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:06,880
Why are we going
to a bar at 10:00?

656
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:10,475
[Mike] To grab a drink before we meet
the guys for a bite at 11:00.

657
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:12,486
Where is this place?

658
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:16,354
For some reason the cool bars
in Hollywood have to be hard
to find and have no sign.

659
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:19,052
lt's kind of like a speakeasy
kind of thing. lt's kinda cool.

660
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:21,960
lt's like you're in on some
kind of secret, you know?

661
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,023
You tell a chick you been
someplace, it's like braggin'
that you know how to find it.

662
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:28,661
[Jazz]

663
00:38:28,736 --> 00:38:31,830
[Continues]

664
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:40,815
- [Chattering]
- [Woman Laughing]

665
00:38:40,815 --> 00:38:43,409
Excuse me.

666
00:38:43,484 --> 00:38:46,282
Excuse me.

667
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:49,118
Excuse me.

668
00:38:52,994 --> 00:38:55,929
l'll get a Dewars on the rocks.
What are you getting?

669
00:38:55,997 --> 00:38:58,932
- Uh, Budweiser.
- A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud.

670
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,527
God, l can't believe
the women in this city.

671
00:39:02,603 --> 00:39:06,403
lt's like the hottest one percent
from... from all over the world...

672
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:08,408
come to our gene pool.

673
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,410
Darwinism at its best.

674
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:13,447
- Yo, Mikey, what's up?
- Charles! How you doin', man?

675
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:16,005
- Ah, you know, man. You know.
- You get that pilot?

676
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,280
Nah, man. l know you didn't. Otherwise
you wouldn't be askin' me, right?

677
00:39:19,353 --> 00:39:22,720
- That shit wasn't funny anyway.
- Piece of shit.

678
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,157
Charles, this is my friend Rob
from back East. He just moved out here.

679
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:28,161
- My pleasure.
- How you doin', man?

680
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:30,561
This is Charles.
We went to network on a pilot.

681
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:32,895
- Oh, yeah, l tested for one.
- A month ago.

682
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:36,459
- How'd your folks take it?
- Actually, l haven't heard
an official "no" yet.

683
00:39:36,537 --> 00:39:39,028
Oh, so you haven't
told them yet.

684
00:39:39,106 --> 00:39:42,234
That's all right, man.
l still haven't told my folks
l didn't get Deep Space Nine.

685
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,244
You figure they'd figure
it out by now, right?

686
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:46,644
- But Moms keeps asking me.
- Boy, does it hurt when they ask.

687
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:48,944
l don't even tell them about
anything l'm close on anymore.

688
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:51,246
Not 'til you book it.
You know, you might get cut out.

689
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:54,982
l'm considering taking
a part as Goofy.

690
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:57,991
- Well, at least it's Disney, right?
- Yeah.

691
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:01,085
Look, we're going to, uh,
we're going to this party in the hills.

692
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:04,222
Some modeling agency. Beautiful babies.
You want to come with?

693
00:40:04,298 --> 00:40:06,960
Yeah, why not?
This place is dead anyway.

694
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:09,229
Let's go.

695
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:15,105
No, no, no, no, no.
Now, you got to admit...

696
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:17,667
that the Steadicam shot
in GoodFellas was the money.

697
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:21,112
The basement of the... the restaurant,
the Copa in New York.

698
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:24,117
- Through the kitchen, Mike.
- l heard it took them four days
to light that shot.

699
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:26,119
[Rob] Four days?
l don't know about four days.

700
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:28,280
- Well, that's what l heard.
- [Trent] They have
to hide all the lights.

701
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:30,290
Jesus, that must've
cost a fortune.

702
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:33,293
[Charles] That's nothing.
You know how much money my man
spent on that Vegas movie?

703
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:35,295
[Mike] Wait. You gotta be nuts
to shoot in a casino.

704
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:37,456
[Trent]
All right, ready. Mean Streets?

705
00:40:37,531 --> 00:40:40,694
- That's the dope.
- Dude, dude. Reservoir Dogs.

706
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:42,793
- Oh, stop with that
fucking Reservoir Dogs.
- Which one?

707
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,430
The one right in the beginning where
they're walking in slow motion, man.

708
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:47,633
How can you even
compare the two, man?

709
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:50,302
Tarantino completely bites
everything from Scorsese.

710
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,312
- lt's true.
- He's derivative.

711
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,644
[Trent] You know what?
You gotta admit that did look money.

712
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:57,775
[Charles] l heard they did
that whole thing for under ten grand.

713
00:40:57,852 --> 00:40:59,979
l don't know what the big deal is.
Everybody steals from everybody.
That's movies.

714
00:41:00,054 --> 00:41:02,147
[Mike] Let's get the hell out
of here if we wanna make this party.

715
00:41:42,496 --> 00:41:44,794
Pick up the pieces
Uh-huh

716
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:46,890
Pick up the pieces
All right

717
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:49,198
Pick up the pieces

718
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,431
Pick up the pieces

719
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:18,765
Whoo

720
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:29,409
[People Chattering]

721
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,949
Pick up the pieces

722
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,224
Pick up the pieces

723
00:42:52,299 --> 00:42:56,497
Pick up the pieces

724
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:04,504
[Ends]

725
00:43:04,578 --> 00:43:07,638
Uhh
Oh, suki, suki

726
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:13,581
Hey
Uhh, come on

727
00:43:13,654 --> 00:43:17,920
- How you been? Good to see you.
- Hey, good to see you.

728
00:43:17,992 --> 00:43:20,426
- So who threw this party anyway?
- Damned if l know.

729
00:43:20,494 --> 00:43:23,088
- Beats me.
- Hey, l came with you.

730
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:25,223
Nice.

731
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:28,427
- [Man] Sue!
- What's that guy's name again? Sue?

732
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:31,903
Sue. Yeah. His dad was a big Johnny Cash
fan from what l understand.

733
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:34,566
- Oh, right, right, right. The song.
- Yeah, "A Boy Named Sue."

734
00:43:34,642 --> 00:43:37,509
So l think that's why
he's such a mean cat.

735
00:43:37,578 --> 00:43:39,512
- That guy?
- Oh, he's a bad guy.

736
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,276
He don't look it. He's... No, he's mean.
l seen him in a fight once.

737
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:45,944
He had a guy and was fuckin' smackin'
his head into the curb, like his mouth.

738
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,456
Just fuckin' smash. His teeth came out.
Just fucking, wha, wha, wha.

739
00:43:49,523 --> 00:43:52,287
Fuckin' blood came out of
his fuckin' mouth. lt was nasty, man.

740
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:54,987
- Nice guy, though. That guy's cool.
- Hey, big Mike.

741
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,997
Hey, how're you doing?
What are you doing here?

742
00:43:58,065 --> 00:44:00,397
- Marty invited me here.
- Oh, yeah? Cool, cool.

743
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:03,494
Thrill me, baby

What about now?

747
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:23,085
No, she's not looking at you, dude.
Will you quit asking me
if she's looking at you?

748
00:44:23,157 --> 00:44:27,423
- She hasn't looked at you...
Wait, she just looked.

757
00:44:52,353 --> 00:44:54,287
- l made a promise to myself.
- Go. Go for it.

00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:56,949

or later, right? So l gotta go now.

759
00:44:57,024 --> 00:45:00,118
- Okay, you're gonna be my wing man?

760

"Shaqued."

781
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:16,565
Just watch old T-bone
there and learn.

782
00:46:16,637 --> 00:46:21,109
She's a brick house

783
00:46:21,242 --> 00:46:25,313
My whole life people have told me
l have this star quality.

784
00:46:25,313 --> 00:46:27,747

- Well, l don't know if it's true.

this crush on this guy Lee.

He was really cute, and he
wore Lee Jeans. They said "Lee."

Anyway, l really liked him.
And then one day he told me l was ugly.

790

and my teacher was, like,

791
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:49,761
"Deidre, you are so emotional.
You are so dramatic.

792

Well, that's really been
sort of my thing, you know.
lt got me into Juilliard.

797
00:47:03,084 --> 00:47:05,348
And the agent said to me
afterwards that he thought...

798

Why, baby?

Espresso. An espresso. Yes, that's

That's great.

You came in and asked me
for an application.

And then l took you and
introduced you to my manager.

871
00:52:22,002 --> 00:52:24,766
Probably longer, 'cause things

872
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:26,773
l haven't been looking
for a job in a while.

873
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:29,605
lt could have been someone who
looks like me, 'cause there's

- You're so money, and you
don't even know it.

- Could you not mess with me?

- Baby, we're not messing with you.
- We're not.

a big bear with claws and fangs, man.

- Big fuckin' teeth, man.
- Yeah, big fuckin' teeth on ya.

just kinda cowering in the corner.

- Yeah, man, just kinda...

you're staring at these claws,

am l supposed to kill this bunny?"

891
00:53:24,265 --> 00:53:26,199
You're pokin' at it, man.

892
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:28,869
You're not hurtin' it. You're just
kinda gently battin' the bunny around.

893
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:31,972
You know what l mean?
And the bunny's scared of you.

- And it's shivering.
- You got the fucking claws!

These claws and these fangs! You're
looking at your claws and your fangs.

"l don't know what to do, man.

897
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,946
l don't know how to kill the bunny."
With this, you don't know how
to kill the bunny!

You're like
a big bear, man.

- No, l'm not fucking with you!

in the PG-13 movie everyone's
really hoping makes it happen.

l want you to be like the guy
in the rated R movie, you know?

whether or not you like yet.

Nice.

- So two days.
- Yeah, l guess you could
call it that... two days.

921

Definitely. Two days
is like industry standard.

922

l used to wait two days to
call anybody, but now it's like
everyone in town waits two days.

923
00:55:25,552 --> 00:55:27,543
So l think three days is kinda money.
What do you think?

- Well, that's dumb.
- What's so dumb about it?

1082
01:06:58,144 --> 01:07:01,079
You're doing really well
out here, Mike.

1083
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:03,081
How well am l doin'?

1084
01:07:03,149 --> 01:07:06,585
l host an open mike;
l play a fuckin' bus driver in a movie.

1085
01:07:06,652 --> 01:07:08,586
Big fuckin' deal.

1086
01:07:08,654 --> 01:07:11,088
l got an agent
that specializes in magicians.

1087
01:07:11,157 --> 01:07:13,091
How good am l doin'?

1088
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:15,855
Did you get turned down
for Goofy?

1089
01:07:15,928 --> 01:07:17,862
They turned you down?

1090
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:22,367
Yeah, they went with somebody who had
some more theme park experience.

1091
01:07:22,435 --> 01:07:24,596
l killed for that job.

1092
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:28,936
The point is, Mike, it all depends
on how you look at it. All right?

1093
01:07:29,008 --> 01:07:33,240
You're telling me that your life sucks.
That means mine is god-awful.

1094
01:07:33,312 --> 01:07:36,839
Part of the reason l moved out here
is l saw how well you were doing,

1095
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:39,851
and l figured if you could
make it, l could too.

1096
01:07:39,919 --> 01:07:43,855
- l didn't make it.
- You got an agent.
You got in the unions.

1097
01:07:43,923 --> 01:07:46,721
You know, that's your problem,
is that you...

1098
01:07:47,894 --> 01:07:50,829
You don't look at
the things that you have.

1099
01:07:50,897 --> 01:07:53,832
You only look at the stuff
you don't have.

1100
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,391
Those guys are right about you.
You're money.

1101
01:07:57,537 --> 01:08:00,301
Then why won't she call?

1102
01:08:02,642 --> 01:08:04,667
She won't call
because you left.

1103
01:08:06,245 --> 01:08:09,544
She's got her own life to deal with,
man, and that's in New York.

1104
01:08:09,615 --> 01:08:12,550
She's a sweet girl
and l love her to pieces,

1105
01:08:12,618 --> 01:08:15,553
but fuck her, man...
you gotta get on with your life.

1106
01:08:15,621 --> 01:08:20,888
You gotta let go of the past, and Mikey,
when you do the future is beautiful.

1107
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,155
All right?
Look out the window.

1108
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:27,222
lt's sunny every day here.
lt's like manifest destiny.

1109
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:32,237
Don't tell me we didn't make it.
We made it. We are here.

1110
01:08:32,305 --> 01:08:35,240
Everything that is past
is prologue to this.

1111
01:08:35,308 --> 01:08:38,277
All of the shit that
didn't kill us is only...

1112
01:08:38,344 --> 01:08:40,539
Ah, you know.
All that shit.

1113
01:08:41,814 --> 01:08:43,907
You're gonna get over it.

1114
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,556
How did you get over it?
How long did it take?

1115
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:55,082
l don't know.
Sometimes it still hurts.

1116
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,424
You know how it is, man.
lt's like...

1117
01:08:57,496 --> 01:09:00,431
You wake up every day,
it hurts a little bit less,

1118
01:09:00,499 --> 01:09:03,627
then you wake up one day
and it doesn't hurt at all.

1119
01:09:03,702 --> 01:09:05,602
And the funny thing is...

1120
01:09:05,671 --> 01:09:08,606
This is kinda weird,
but it's like...

1121
01:09:09,675 --> 01:09:11,609
you almost miss that pain.

1122
01:09:17,549 --> 01:09:19,642
You miss the pain?

1123
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,384
Yeah, for the same reason
that you miss her.

1124
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:27,391
Because you... you lived
with it for so long.

something to eat.

l don't want to talk about him.

1397
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:08,999
l, um, l called 'cause l heard you
might be moving back to Queens.

1398
01:30:08,999 --> 01:30:11,900
l, um, l called 'cause l heard you
might be moving back to Queens.

1399
01:30:11,968 --> 01:30:17,031
- [Phone Clicks]
- Yeah. Hang on a second.
Let me get rid of this.

1400
01:30:17,107 --> 01:30:19,200
- Hello?
- Hi, Mike?

1401
01:30:19,275 --> 01:30:21,607

- Are you on the other line?

1402
01:30:21,678 --> 01:30:23,942
- Yeah. Oh, hang on a second...

1403
01:30:24,014 --> 01:30:27,040
No, no. You hang on, okay?
l want to talk to you.

1404
01:30:27,117 --> 01:30:29,108
Just hold on. Hello?

1405
01:30:29,185 --> 01:30:32,279
So l heard you might be
moving back to New York.

1406
01:30:32,355 --> 01:30:36,485
Yeah, l don't think that's
going to be happening just yet.
Um, can l call you right back?

1407
01:30:36,559 --> 01:30:40,962
Um, well, l'm going out of town
for a week and the cab's on its way.

1408
01:30:41,031 --> 01:30:43,261
Can't you just talk to me
for five minutes?

1409
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:45,733
Look, there's somebody holding on the
other line. l have to take this call.

1410
01:30:45,802 --> 01:30:49,067
l really want to catch up with you,
but, um, l have to take the call.

1411
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:51,903
So just... Uh, l'm gonna call you back
when you get back into town.

1412
01:30:51,975 --> 01:30:53,909
- Okay?
- Okay.

1413
01:30:53,977 --> 01:30:55,911
- ls that okay?
- Yeah.

1414
01:30:55,979 --> 01:30:58,072
- Really? You sure?
- lt's all right. All right.

1415
01:30:58,148 --> 01:31:00,275
- All right, bye-bye.
- Good-bye. l love y...

1416
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:03,581
- Hello?
- Hi. Oh, you didn't have to
get off of the other line.

1417
01:31:03,653 --> 01:31:06,816
- l would've called you back.
- No, that's okay.
l wanted to talk to you.

1418
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:09,324
You know, l really could...
could've called you back, but...

1419
01:31:09,392 --> 01:31:12,759
Anyway, l probably should have waited
two days. That's what my friends said.

1420
01:31:12,829 --> 01:31:15,593
But... God, l sound like
such a schoolgirl. lt's just,
they have this thing, okay?

1421
01:31:15,665 --> 01:31:17,599
lt's at The Room.
lt's Sinatra's birthday.

1422
01:31:17,667 --> 01:31:21,159
And it's one of these Hollywood clubs
and there's no sign.

1423
01:31:21,237 --> 01:31:24,104
Uh, l don't understand why...
why they don't have any signs.

1424
01:31:24,174 --> 01:31:26,608
lt's just
l'm really bad at this.

1425
01:31:26,676 --> 01:31:31,113
l just want to know
if you might want to go with me.

1426
01:31:33,349 --> 01:31:36,614
- [Trent] So, uh, you
hung up on which one?
- [Mike] Michelle.

1427
01:31:36,686 --> 01:31:39,177
- You hung up with your girlfriend.
- Ex.

1428
01:31:39,255 --> 01:31:41,553
- Oh, now she's your ex.
- She was always my ex.

1429
01:31:41,624 --> 01:31:43,558
Yeah, right.

1430
01:31:45,395 --> 01:31:49,991
- You hung up with her?
- l wanted to take the other call.

1431
01:31:50,066 --> 01:31:52,534
- What'd she say when
you called her back?
- l didn't.

1432
01:31:55,305 --> 01:31:58,968
- You didn't call her back?
- No.

1433
01:31:59,042 --> 01:32:03,206
- Why not, Mike?
- lt didn't occur to me.

1434
01:32:05,048 --> 01:32:06,982
Didn't occur to you.

1435
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:09,678
lt didn't.

1436
01:32:09,752 --> 01:32:14,519
You been, uh, tearing yourself
up about this girl for six months.

1437
01:32:15,592 --> 01:32:17,526
Didn't occur to you?

1438
01:32:19,295 --> 01:32:21,695
No.

1439
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,833
Well, Michael, l'll bite.

1440
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:34,206
You know, man, l didn't understand
it either. lt's all so hard.

1441
01:32:34,277 --> 01:32:37,610
Then it hit me on the way over here,
you know, like a ton of bricks.

1442
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,614
lt's just so simple.

1443
01:32:39,682 --> 01:32:42,276
- When you...
- Dude, dude, wait a second.

1444
01:32:46,456 --> 01:32:49,448
l'm getting vibe like
in a really weird way here.

1445
01:32:51,294 --> 01:32:54,422
This girl's looking at me
like she knows me a little bit.

1446
01:32:54,497 --> 01:32:56,522
- You don't recognize her?
- Mike, l don't know.

1447
01:32:56,599 --> 01:32:59,625
l could've been out with Sue
one night drinking and told her
l was a race car driver.

1448
01:32:59,702 --> 01:33:03,331
No, l think l would
remember this girl.

1449
01:33:03,406 --> 01:33:07,809
l don't think l've ever met her before.
l would definitely remember this one.

1450
01:33:07,877 --> 01:33:11,711
She got a lot of confidence, man.
She's doing like...

1451
01:33:11,781 --> 01:33:15,239
- Wow. [Laughs]
- What's going...

1452
01:33:15,318 --> 01:33:17,616
Mike, stop, stop.
Stop, all right? Just stop.

1453
01:33:17,687 --> 01:33:20,087
She's playing a little game,
like a fun thing with me.

1454
01:33:20,156 --> 01:33:23,922
Come on, you little party girl.
That's it. Come on. Fun little games?

1455
01:33:23,993 --> 01:33:27,656
You want to play fun little games? Come
on, you nasty little, cute little baby.

1456
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:31,598
- What are you doing?
- Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.
Stop. Don't. Don't, don't.

1457
01:33:31,668 --> 01:33:34,432
She's smiling at me.
She's playing fun little baby games.

1458
01:33:34,504 --> 01:33:37,598
She don't know me. She doesn't
know my address. You know my address?

1459
01:33:37,674 --> 01:33:40,609
You little...
Oh, you... Hold on.

1460
01:33:40,677 --> 01:33:43,612
She's coming over, dude.
Play it cool. She's coming over.

1461
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:47,309
She's like the wild loony.
But l threw, like, the great
vibe at her, the funny vibe.

1462
01:33:47,383 --> 01:33:49,510
- You'll see.
- [Babbling]

1463
01:33:49,586 --> 01:33:52,612
- Shit.
- Mommy's big boy.

1464
01:33:52,689 --> 01:33:55,556
We're going bye-bye now.
Yes, we're going bye-bye.

1465
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:59,288
We're gonna go home,
gonna play with Daddy.

1466
01:34:07,470 --> 01:34:11,236
So, um, so you
called her up, right?

1467
01:34:11,307 --> 01:34:14,242
Or you didn't call her. Why didn't you
call her? You said you didn't call her.

1468
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:16,696
Why didn't you call her? Mike?

1469
01:34:16,829 --> 01:34:18,464
Mike?

1470
01:34:18,464 --> 01:34:21,490
l never cared much
for moonlit skies

1471
01:34:21,567 --> 01:34:24,934
Never winked back
at fireflies

1472
01:34:25,003 --> 01:34:28,200
But now that the stars
are in your eyes

1473
01:34:28,273 --> 01:34:31,572
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

1474
01:34:31,643 --> 01:34:35,807
And l never went in
for afterglow

1475
01:34:35,881 --> 01:34:39,248
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe

1476
01:34:39,318 --> 01:34:42,378
But now when you turn
the lamp down low

1477
01:34:42,454 --> 01:34:46,220
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

1478
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:50,284
l used to ramble
through the park

1479
01:34:50,362 --> 01:34:53,798
Shadowboxin' in the dark

1480
01:34:53,866 --> 01:34:56,733
Then you came
and caused the spark

1481
01:34:56,802 --> 01:35:00,829
That's a four-alarm fire now

1482
01:35:00,906 --> 01:35:03,807
l never made love
by lantern shine

1483
01:35:03,876 --> 01:35:07,573
l never saw rainbows
in my wine

1484
01:35:07,646 --> 01:35:10,979
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine

1485
01:35:11,049 --> 01:35:14,541
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

1486
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:18,249
l never cared much
for moonlit skies

1487
01:35:18,323 --> 01:35:21,451
l never winked back
at fireflies

1488
01:35:21,527 --> 01:35:24,985
But now that the stars
are in your eyes

1489
01:35:25,063 --> 01:35:28,430
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

1490
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:32,095
And l never went in
for afterglow

1491
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:35,901
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe

1492
01:35:35,974 --> 01:35:39,034
But now when you turn
the lamp down low

1493
01:35:39,111 --> 01:35:42,512
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

1494
01:35:42,581 --> 01:35:46,847
You know, l used to ramble
through the park

1495
01:35:46,919 --> 01:35:50,480
Shadowboxin' in the dark

1496
01:35:50,556 --> 01:35:53,582
Then you came
and lit that spark

1497
01:35:53,659 --> 01:35:56,685
That's a four-alarm fire now

1498
01:35:56,762 --> 01:36:00,755
And l never made love
by lantern shine

1499
01:36:00,832 --> 01:36:04,461
Never saw rainbows
in my wine

1500
01:36:04,536 --> 01:36:07,562
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine

1501
01:36:07,639 --> 01:36:10,267
l'm beginnin'

1502
01:36:10,342 --> 01:36:13,641
Mm, to see the light
