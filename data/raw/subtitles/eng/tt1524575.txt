"The Vatican Tapes (2015)" ^ (Run time : 01:30:52)

2
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,922
<i>I warn you, what you are about to hear
is very disturbing indeed.</i>

3
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,331
<i>Possession is the coming of a demon,</i>

4
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,165
<i>or an evil force that will take over
a person's mental and physical faculties.</i>

5
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,979
There is so much concern
about the devil's influence on this country

6
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,250
that it has started offering
courses on exorcism.

7
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,539
<i>Italian police are hunting for
thieves who stole a relic</i>

8
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,969
<i>which contains the blood
of Pope John Paul ll.</i>

9
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,690
<i>Pope Francis has declared
that the devil is here</i>

10
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,844
<i>and this is not a fairy tale.</i>

11
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,490
<i>What the Bible has taught you,
what you believe in, is the truth.</i>

12
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,570
The demon chooses you.

13
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,042
<i>It watches and analyzes you.</i>

14
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:58,739
<i>Your strengths and your weaknesses.</i>

15
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,739
The Bible says the Antichrist
will walk the earth and mimic the real Christ.

16
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,089
<i>And the deceived
will worship this false prophet.</i>

17
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,002
And that is the day we most fear.

18
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,970
Dark forces are rising.

19
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,568
The frequency of possession
is increasing all over the world.

20
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,528
Why does the devil choose
one person over another?

21
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,409
There's no explanation.

22
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,568
The devil can choose anyone.

23
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,366
<i>From the day you are conceived,
the devil seeks your destruction,</i>

24
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,726
<i>temporal, but especially eternal,</i>

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,086
and doesn't give up until the day you die.

26
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,964
I am troubled.

27
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,808
The world is changing, Cardinal.

28
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,444
We've never seen this acceleration
of the shadows.

29
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,971
The Holy Father knows what we're facing.

30
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,240
I think it's time for us to take action.

31
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,131
I know.

32
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,327
Here is the case I told you about.

33
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,491
A local priest has witnessed
several incidents involving this girl.

34
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,579
<i>I was fine before I saw the doctors.</i>

35
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,379
<i>This place is making me sick.
I'm not staying here.</i>

36
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,681
<i>Okay-</i>

37
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,539
<i>Angela, you were in a car accident.
Do you remember that?</i>

38
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,699
<i>I want to go home. I want to go home.
I want to go home.</i>

39
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,739
<i>Angela.</i>

40
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,859
<i>- I want to go home. I want to go home.
-Angela.</i>

41
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,379
<i>I want to go home. I want to go home.
I want to go home!</i>

42
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,364
Did you see that?

43
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,179
<i>- This place is making me sick.</i>
- What <i>are we looking for?</i>

44
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,641
<i>I'm not staying here.</i>

45
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,059
The Antichrist.

46
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,779
<i>Angela.</i>

47
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,659
<i>- I want to go home. I want to go home.
-Angela.</i>

48
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,042
<i>I want to</i> go...

49
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,046
Get all of the hospital tapes. Get everything.

50
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,579
Okay. Come on, come on.

51
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,405
There we go.

52
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,126
Come on.

53
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,299
- Finally. Jesus.
-Hey.

54
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,601
Hi. Can you see me?

55
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,459
<i>Yeah. I can hear you, too.
Stop blaspheming.</i>

56
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,649
"Blaspheming"? Nice.

57
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,339
<i>I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm heading to Fort Drum.</i>

58
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,099
<i>I got a commencement, a lunch,
and then back to Benning.</i>

59
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,459
Why are you in a cab?

60
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,207
I'm flying commercial.
I hate flying commercial.

61
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,979
I went through all this trouble

62
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,379
so I could do more than just wish you
a happy birthday over the phone. Again.

63
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,859
It's okay.

64
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,979
No, it's not.

65
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,979
I got you a present.

66
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,659
Yeah? For little old me?

67
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,179
I figured since you already knew
about your "surprise" party,

68
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,499
- I <i>might</i> as well...
- Here we go.

69
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,339
<i>Yeah, go ahead and defend him.</i>

70
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,859
I don't need to.

71
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,659
You see, he can't be defended.

72
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,379
He has a name. "Pete."

73
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,459
And how can you not like him?
You've never even met him.

74
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,979
He's living with my daughter,
his name's Pete.

75
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,139
It's more than enough reason
not to like him.

76
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,169
Pete is wonderful.

77
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,339
Happy birthday, sweetie. I got to go.

78
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,699
- I love you.
-I love you, too.

79
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,764
Don't be late for your flight.

80
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,819
...24,

81
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,804
25.

82
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,691
All right.

83
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,724
Hey, open sesame.

84
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,124
- Here. And pass it to the back.
-All right.

85
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,002
Angela, are you still working on the article?

86
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,779
- Hi.
-Hey.

87
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,659
- Hola.
-Hola. What are you doing?

88
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,883
I'm video-capturing your ass.

89
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,847
- Where are we going?
-We're going outside.

90
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,219
I need to show you something.

91
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,899
You're not going to believe what I found.

92
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,645
What did you find?

93
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,859
You got to come outside.

94
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,286
What is it?

95
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,099
It's out here.

96
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,219
-It's a mess. It's a crazy mess.
-Where?

97
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,410
Well, I mean, it's no problem.
It's in the garage!

98
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,521
Surprise!

99
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,370
- Oh, my God.
-Surprise!

100
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,459
Hey, honey!

101
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,739
Were you surprised?

102
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,699
I had no idea you guys were here.

103
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,819
- Okay, wait till you see this frosting.
-Okay.

104
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,645
Hey, someone grab the cake, yeah?

105
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,419
All right, I had this special ordered
just for you.

106
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,721
Okay.

107
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,205
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

108
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,939
Oh, my God. Pete, what did you do?

109
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,366
Dad!

110
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,459
- What are you doing here?
-Come here.

111
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,619
I'm here for your birthday.

112
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,259
- Think I'd miss it? Again?
-Oh, my God.

113
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,619
- I love you.
-I love you, too.

114
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,779
- You look so beautiful.
-You look handsome.

115
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,419
- Thank you.
-Come on.

116
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,579
I'll find something to cut the cake.

117
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,405
Check it out!

118
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,299
"Oh, Pete. Wow, what did you do?
Oh, my God."

119
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,619
Really? Is that what I sound like?

120
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,206
- Really?
-Yeah.

121
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,525
- Who wants cake?
-Daddy!

122
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,179
Daddy always gets the first piece.

123
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,369
- Tradition, right, Dad?
-That's a nice tradition.

124
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,601
So...

125
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,299
Rog, it was a good idea
getting you out here, yeah?

126
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,647
"Rog"?

127
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,487
"Rog"?

128
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,521
No, Pete, that's not becoming a thing.

129
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,442
Don't call me that again.

130
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,806
Shit.

131
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,891
Did you just cut your finger?

132
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,404
Sweetie, it's pretty deep.

133
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,323
I hate hospitals.

134
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,499
Babe, think about it.

135
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,202
The last time you were a patient
in a hospital, it was 25 years ago.

136
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,339
Are you really that afraid of hospitals?

137
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,005
I'm not going in.

138
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,163
I don't blame you. Nobody likes hospitals.
Not even doctors.

139
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,889
But with a cut like that,
you might want to give it a shot.

140
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,884
Come on. It's going to be fine.

141
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,963
It's just a local anesthetic.

142
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,083
I'll write you a prescription.

143
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,202
- Hi, Colonel.
-Hey.

144
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,699
Is that what I think it is, Father?

145
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,579
This? Yeah, it was another life.

146
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,419
10th Mountain Division.

147
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,801
I was a military chaplain.

148
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,059
So, you like the cold?

149
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,739
Chaplains don't ink their bodies.

150
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,859
I was a soldier first.

151
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,889
A couple tours in Iraq.

152
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,045
When did you change uniforms?

153
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,124
When I saw enough.

154
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,890
I'll be around.

155
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,779
Hey, we should all hop on the bike.

156
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,139
If you put Angela on that bike, I'll...

157
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,930
- Dad.
-Sorry.

158
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,880
Pete, you're an idiot.

159
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,211
- Come on, let's go eat.
-Great.

160
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,763
So, where are we going?

161
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,659
Sorry, honey, I got to take this.

162
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,200
Yep.

163
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,450
- Hi. Hi.
-Hi.

164
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,459
What did you do to your face?

165
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,886
Nothing.

166
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,939
My conference call got moved up.

167
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,939
I'm going to stay back.
It might take a couple of hours.

168
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,019
- I'm sorry, honey.
-it's okay.

169
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,448
- I love you.
-I love you, too.

170
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,210
Yeah.

171
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,979
Excuse me. I said, excuse me.

172
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,760
Watch where the hell you're going next time.

173
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,202
- Pardon me.
-Could you just scoot over, please?

174
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,499
- What's the problem?
-Did you see her?

175
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,087
She came down the aisle like a bowling ball.

176
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,339
Hey, are you all right?

177
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,483
My throat is so dry.

178
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,644
- No!
-What was that?

179
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,011
I think it was a bird that just hit the window.

180
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,769
You should have seen your face.
Pure terror.

181
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,521
Oh, my God!

182
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,521
You all right?

183
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,765
Hey, hey, wait Up.

184
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,779
- That bird bit my finger.
-Are you all right?

185
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,971
- I'm fine. lt just hurts.
-Hold on, hold on. Let me see.

186
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,579
- Holy shit.
-Stop it!

187
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,008
It's not that bad.
I'll go to the doctor tomorrow.

188
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,579
That's so infected.
We should go back to the hospital.

189
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,882
- I'm sure it'll be fine by tomorrow.
-Babe...

190
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,484
<i>Eggs, and then we got this chick...</i>

191
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,251
Great. This is yours, Rog.

192
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,699
What a crazy day.

193
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,379
At least we got
some roasted raven coming up.

194
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,979
You're so good to me.

195
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,045
Well, get back to me after we eat it.

196
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,290
What are you doing?

197
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,939
Did my dad say something to you?

198
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,083
Why are you yelling?

199
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,085
Am I being loud?

200
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,659
- Have you been drinking?
-No.

201
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,531
Wait, hold on. Look at me.

202
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,219
You're drunk.

203
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,329
Well, I'm pounding water.

204
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,042
Did my dad say something to you?

205
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,339
Your dad only says, like,
one or two words to me.

206
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,007
It's his face that says everything.

207
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,459
Yeah, well, to my dad, murder and living
with a guy in sin are the same thing.

208
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,019
What, is your dad, like, super religious?

209
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,899
He's Irish Catholic.

210
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,645
He believes in heaven and hell.

211
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,659
Wait. So... So, he doesn't like me?

212
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,167
He's not psyched about us living together.

213
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,539
You have to understand,
my dad is from a different era.

214
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,968
Is he telling you to tell me to marry you?

215
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,003
You think highly of yourself.

216
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,009
He wants me to move out.

217
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,966
I need to take a leak.

218
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,927
"A leak"?

219
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,407
Well, stay away from the wine coolers.

220
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,282
Hey, Ange, where's the...

221
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,044
Where's the steamer?

222
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,601
Ange.

223
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,041
Angela.

224
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,686
Angela!

225
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,887
Did you get lost
on your way to the bathroom?

226
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,129
Hey. Wake up.

227
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,489
I need the steamer.

228
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,042
Ange.
Hey.

229
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,730
Ange, wake up.

230
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,299
Roger! Roger!

231
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,001
- What is it?
-I can't wake her up.

232
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,459
She was acting really strange a minute ago.

233
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,526
Go get the pills that the hospital gave her.
And turn the lights on.

234
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,401
Sweetie.

235
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,859
Angela, I need you to wake up.

236
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,659
Can you do that for me?
I need you to wake up.

237
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,819
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

238
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,487
Get the pills!
Bring me the pills!

239
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,165
There's nothing here
says this is a side effect.

240
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,499
I came back.

241
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,739
I've got you, I've got you,
I've got you.

242
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,884
- I came back. I can't breathe!
-Sweetheart, calm down.

243
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,299
I need you to breathe, sweetheart.
I need you to breathe.

244
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,019
Look at me, look at me.

245
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,019
Breathe in. And out.

246
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,651
In.

247
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,259
That's it. Out. In. Out.

248
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,819
I've got you, I've got you.

249
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,805
I've got you, sweetheart.
I've got you. I've got you.

250
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,442
Okay. Okay, sweetie, I've got you.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

251
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,322
It's okay. Daddy's got you.

252
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,979
<i>It could certainly be a lot of things,</i>

253
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,979
but everything we did on our end
was standard procedure.

254
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,539
I want to run a couple of tests
to rule out any problems.

255
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,684
I think it's best, Angela,
if we keep you overnight.

256
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,689
Are you okay, sweetie?
It's okay.

257
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,681
Hi.

258
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,965
What's that?

259
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,967
That's strange.
These were perfect a second ago.

260
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,539
What a rip-off. I'm going to toss them out.

261
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,619
No, no, it's fine.

262
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,459
- They're all floppy. Are you sure?
-Yeah.

263
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,967
- Okay.
-Let's go home.

264
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,011
Yeah. I think we should file 
for a malpractice suit.

265
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,779
I'm serious. I talked to a buddy of mine.
He's pre-med. He said it's a no-brainer.

266
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,019
- What's so funny?
-Nothing.

267
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,819
Well, you know, my daughter,
she likes to earn her money.

268
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,899
Dad!

269
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,179
- I didn't say that she didn't.
- What do you mean?

270
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,219
Malpractice is one of the stupidest ideas
I've ever heard.

271
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,499
Hey, hey. The argument that didn't happen
between you two earlier

272
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,646
is not going to happen now, okay?
We're going to eat and smile and that's that.

273
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,219
- I'm just trying to say...
-Yeah, but don't.

274
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,931
Can you just...

275
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,739
- Hey, Ange, I'm...
-Hon, okay.

276
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,326
I'm fine.

277
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,083
Okay. I'm sorry.

278
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:46,859
Whoa!

279
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,527
- Ange, what are you doing?
-Angela!

280
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,339
Stop! Stop!

281
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,051
Get away!

282
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,006
Stop!

283
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,459
Watch out.

284
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,001
- Jesus.
-Bay four.

285
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,859
On the left, sir.

286
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,491
Colonel?

287
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:22,019
- Well, Father, thanks for joining us.
-Of course.

288
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,219
I know you spent some time 
with the family.

289
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,885
That's right, I have. 
Yeah.

290
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,419
Well, this has been very troubling.

291
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,579
How's the dad doing?

292
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,881
Okay.

293
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,299
Well, let's get into this.
She's been with us for nearly 2 months.

294
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,579
There are 42 days 
in the coma, I believe.

295
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,249
- Actually, my report says 40 days.
-Well, my mistake, 40 days.

296
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,562
There's been no brain activity
and she's on full life support.

297
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,922
Then, Father, perhaps it's time
you talked to the family.

298
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,683
You look like an angel.

299
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,329
I know why you're here.

300
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,162
Roger, these things are never easy.

301
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,730
The last rites

302
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,770
are given to those
not only who are about to pass

303
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,883
but also as a celebration of life.

304
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,840
Father,

305
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,930
the car crash wasn't an accident.

306
00:24:32,611 --> 00:24:33,947
She slipped into a coma.

307
00:24:33,948 --> 00:24:36,962
Get the paddles ready.
10 eds of epinephrine. Here we go.

308
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:38,693
<i>Here's what we have.</i>

309
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:41,016
She's got severe lacerations,
a broken collar bone,

310
00:24:41,017 --> 00:24:43,321
contusions on her right arm
and both her legs,

311
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:44,765
and increased cranial pressure.

312
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:46,933
The other passengers
are just suffering minor injuries.

313
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:48,702
What about the taxi driver?

314
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:51,691
He still can't recall the incident,
but the girl's father said it was an accident.

315
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:54,470
You're gonna have to make
an official statement, Doctor.

316
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:56,006
Of course.

317
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,586
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

318
00:25:10,587 --> 00:25:12,819
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

319
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,659
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

320
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,619
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

321
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,619
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

322
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,160
Amen.

323
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,119
What is that?

324
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,439
It's just the body's normal process
when it shuts down.

325
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,959
Don't let it alarm you, Mr. Holmes.

326
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,246
What?

327
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,575
Hold on a second.

328
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,550
Miss Holmes, can you hear me?

329
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,262
She's breathing.
Are you alive?

330
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,902
Get a cart in here! 
We have to stabilize her.

331
00:26:15,318 --> 00:26:16,949
Come on!

332
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,975
I can't believe it.

333
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,239
- She's responsive.
-it's a miracle.

334
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,095
Just give her space.
Let her breathe, let her breathe.

335
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,147
I thought I lost you, honey.

336
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,546
Well, it looks like 
everything is normalized.

337
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,988
Miss Holmes! 
Miss Holmes!

338
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:00,965
Get her!

339
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,184
Hold on to her!

340
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,439
I got her. 
I got her.

341
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,639
- Hold onto her arm.
-I didn't do anything! It wasn't me!

342
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,544
It wasn't me!

343
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:12,908
- You got her?
-I've got her. Hold her up.

344
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,079
The IT guys, they can't restore
the footage of her walking in and out.

345
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,575
Who left the room unattended?

346
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,575
According to the computer,

347
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,471
those doors were locked
until security opened them.

348
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,164
Who is in Angela's bed?

349
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,203
Obviously, these cameras are out of sync.

350
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,675
We have to get the police involved.

351
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,407
Angela Holmes?

352
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,039
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's my daughter.

353
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,919
- I understand.
-Officer, that's my daughter.

354
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,199
We just have to ask 
her a few questions.

355
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,439
- Oh, Yeah?
-Yeah.

356
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,168
Hello, Angela.

357
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,429
My name is Detective Simmons.

358
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,519
I just want to ask you
some questions about last night.

359
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,755
The hospital wants to press charges
against you, Angela.

360
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,344
It's a very serious offense.

361
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,319
Aggravated assault on a minor.

362
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,270
It's a felony.

363
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,186
Do you want to tell me 
why you did this?

364
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,381
Trent.

365
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,759
Do you mind?

366
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,695
- Go right ahead.
-Well, thank you.

367
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,230
Hey, sweetie.

368
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,504
What are you doing with that?

369
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,701
What are you doing?

370
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:55,509
OH!

371
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:57,439
Jeez, what are you... Trent!

372
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,279
What are you doing? 
Stop it!

373
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,835
Man, stop it! 
Stop!

374
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,319
Help! Help! 
Somebody!

375
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,959
Oh, my God.

376
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:11,167
Move!

377
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,786
Code trauma. Code trauma.
I need somebody to call code trauma stat.

378
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,959
You have to understand,
this is only temporary.

379
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,633
This is one of the best facilities
in the state for evaluation.

380
00:32:32,658 --> 00:32:34,959
I'm more than sorry
about what happened to that man,

381
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,199
but my daughter didn't do that.
She didn't touch the guy.

382
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,759
It's an evaluation. As soon as she's clear,
she can go back home.

383
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,252
- I don't understand this.
-I understand.

384
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,039
The hospital is being cautious.

385
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,164
Cautious? 
She just came out of a coma.

386
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:51,599
And now what, all of a sudden,
she's supposed to be crazy?

387
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,438
It's just an eval.

388
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,039
She's my daughter.
And I know my daughter.

389
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,040
This isn't Angela. 
I know her!

390
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:05,015
Have faith.

391
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,319
I need more than just faith, Father.
I need a...

392
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,430
I'm going to be here every day. 
I promise.

393
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,587
Roger, God is going to
see you through this.

394
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,193
- She's not even here on time.
-Good morning, everybody.

395
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:23,732
Oh, brother.

396
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:28,184
Thank you, David.
You can sit down. You can sit down.

397
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,879
Morning.

398
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,559
- Can I start today, please?
-Control freak.

399
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,319
Don, let's not do that, okay?
Everyone gets a turn.

400
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,039
Well, she went first yesterday!
She went first the day before!

401
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,319
Don, we don't label
and we don't raise our voices, right?

402
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,079
<i>Fear not that which kills except
one be born of water and of the spirit.</i>

403
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,759
<i>He cannot enter into 
the kingdom of God.</i>

404
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,679
<i>That which is born 
of the flesh is flesh</i>

405
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,159
<i>and that which is born 
of the Spirit is spirit.</i>

406
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,159
<i>Marvel not that I said unto thee,
ye must be born again.</i>

407
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,759
Angela.

408
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,130
- Are you with us?
-Yes.

409
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,585
So, how are you today?

410
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,783
- Can I have some water?
-Absolutely.

411
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,783
I know sometimes the cameras
can be a little off-putting,

412
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,839
but their only purpose is our purpose,

413
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,639
to provide you
with the best care that we can.

414
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,750
So try and pretend 
they're not there.

415
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,895
So, how are you feeling today?

416
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,063
I want to go home.

417
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,039
You're safe in here, Angela.

418
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,679
And we're going to take
very good care of you.

419
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,119
- I want to go home now.
-And we will continue to take care of you.

420
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,467
Okay?

421
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:31,846
Hey.

422
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:36,123
Hey.

423
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,719
Father Lozano's
worked in our chapel before.

424
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,679
He tells me that he's visited
you and your father often.

425
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,639
I was fine before I saw the doctors.
This place is making me sick.

426
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,181
- I'm not staying here.
-Okay.

427
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,159
You had a car accident, Angela.

428
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,604
- Do you remember it?
-I want to go home.

429
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:55,747
- I want to go home. I want to go home.
-Angela.

430
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:57,992
- I want to go home. I want to go home.
- Angela.

431
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:02,299
- I want to go home. I want to go home.
-Angela.

432
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:03,819
I want to go home!

433
00:36:03,844 --> 00:36:05,505
Okay.

434
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,400
It's okay.

435
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:11,319
Mason, we are going to
take her back to her room.

436
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,286
It's too much for her right now.

437
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,558
I'm sorry it took me
so long to come see you.

438
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,815
Can I tell you something?

439
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,919
Yeah, of course.

440
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,919
Do you promise to believe me?

441
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,319
Of course.

442
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,622
I was in a coma, right?

443
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,519
Yeah.

444
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,948
But I could still hear things.

445
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,431
Not what was going on 
in the room, but...

446
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,831
It's-
It's hard to explain.

447
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,305
Just say it.

448
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,215
There were these sounds.

449
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,839
And I heard them over and over again
and it wasn't the doctors.

450
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,719
It wasn't what was going on in the room.
It was...

451
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,500
It was another language,
another way of thinking.

452
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,079
You're not believing me.

453
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,255
No, l am.

454
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,319
No, I can see it in your face.

455
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,931
Angela, I believe you, okay?

456
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,229
It's hard-
It's hard to explain.

457
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,799
Maybe it's another language.

458
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,759
What language?

459
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,621
I don't know. 
I don't know how to explain it.

460
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,279
Something is coming together,
coming together somehow.

461
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,862
Something bad is gonna happen.

462
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:56,984
And I don't know what it is.

463
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,943
I feel like something is 
fighting me to be me.

464
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,425
When I walk and when I talk.

465
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,782
What is wrong with me, Pete?

466
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,579
Ange, listen to me.

467
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,279
If this was me in here,
then we'd have something to worry about.

468
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,199
If something happens to me,
I need you to be there for me.

469
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,639
Why do you think something's 
going to happen to you?

470
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,112
When it happens, 
I need you there for me.

471
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,430
I'm right here.

472
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,799
Listen, there's...

473
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,989
Who is that priest?

474
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,879
Father Lozano.

475
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,591
And who is he?

476
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,264
He's been watching over you.

477
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:48,511
We met him 
when you cut your finger.

478
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,072
I don't trust him.

479
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,344
I'm scared of him, Pete.

480
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:06,664
- Johnny.
-Father.

481
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:10,303
- You're on the late shift.
-Yeah. So are you.

482
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:15,588
Wait.

483
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,559
Can you go back to Angela?

484
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,673
Give me a sec.

485
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,986
What's she doing?

486
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,794
It's almost time.

487
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,647
Father?

488
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,021
Angela?

489
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,507
It's almost time.

490
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,744
Elisa!

491
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,270
Jesus says,

492
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,308
"Though I stand at the door, I knock."

493
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,279
Do you remember
the medication you were given

494
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,479
when your finger was infected?

495
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,759
No.

496
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,319
Okay. Well, you were taking
extended spectrum beta-inhibitor.

497
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,266
It's a type of antibiotic
normally used while in hospital care.

498
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,644
Why this was given to you, 
my guess is,

499
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:10,215
the doctor who administered your stitches
incorrectly feared repercussions.

500
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,039
So he made a mistake?

501
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,239
Well, I need your help 
to make sure.

502
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:20,943
Were you drinking a lot of water
when your finger was infected?

503
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,889
I was dehydrated.
My throat was dry. It still is.

504
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,381
Okay.

505
00:41:27,406 --> 00:41:30,997
Any other feelings? 
Anything at all?

506
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,544
I was just tired.

507
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,630
Angela, you've been complaining
about night terrors.

508
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,055
No, I haven't.

509
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,107
If you're hearing voices...

510
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,721
You listen to my conversations?

511
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,428
What did Pete tell you?

512
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,079
Your lack of cooperation
during these sessions

513
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,035
is counterproductive to treatment.

514
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,771
The longer we tiptoe 
around the real issue,

515
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:01,957
the longer you're going to be here,
and I know you don't want that.

516
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,035
I just want to be honest with you.
Can you be honest with me?

517
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,705
Can you tell me what you said
to the detective before he killed himself?

518
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,096
No?

519
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,759
All right. It says here
when you walked into the maternity ward,

520
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,030
going off the reading of your lips,
you said that

521
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,347
the babies were in 
your father's house.

522
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,924
What does that mean,
"in your father's house"?

523
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,069
Angela, I want to be honest with you.
Can you be honest with me?

524
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,983
I can't be honest with you.

525
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,062
You can't be honest with me? 
Why not?

526
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,070
Because you're not.

527
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,504
I assure you, I am.

528
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,181
No.

529
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,081
You want to feel superior.

530
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,959
You leave work
and go talk to your own psychiatrist

531
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,679
and complain about your patients

532
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,746
and your boy-toy
and how he left you to go be with his wife.

533
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,863
But you screwed him after work.

534
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:11,239
And last week,

535
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,344
you went down on him
in the parking lot of his daughter's school

536
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:16,453
while his wife watched 
the school play.

537
00:43:16,478 --> 00:43:19,012
That's your truth.

538
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,585
I'm sorry. 
I'm so sorry.

539
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,991
That's okay.

540
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,068
I mean, you're not my first patient
to experience delusional episodes.

541
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:36,821
It's normal.

542
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,785
I'm so sorry.

543
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,062
I think we're finished for the day.

544
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:08,923
Dr. Richards prescribed
some happy pills for you.

545
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,618
You're not like the others.

546
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,979
What are you doing?

547
00:44:46,813 --> 00:44:48,068
AH!

548
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,964
- Is she okay?
-Yeah, she's fine. Come with me.

549
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:05,280
- I want to see her.
-No, no, no. Come here. Come on.

550
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,199
- What happened?
-They won't tell me anything.

551
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,119
They're saying that
some orderly died in Angela's room.

552
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,830
She didn't do it.
That's all I can get them to tell me.

553
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,559
Let's just sit down for a second.

554
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,089
How the hell did we get here?

555
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,984
Tell me about Angela's mom.

556
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:38,390
You never talked about her.

557
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,786
Okay.

558
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,425
- Well, she...
-it's all right.

559
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,308
She was a call girl.

560
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,584
I wasn't a customer.

561
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,349
I thought I could help her.

562
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,019
We had this...

563
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,106
connection.

564
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,614
Pretty soon, it became 
just the two of us.

565
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,628
And then I went to Japan.

566
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,439
And 8 days into the transfer,

567
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,471
she calls me and tells me 
that she's pregnant.

568
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,342
But she wants an abortion.

569
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,869
I begged her not to.

570
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,827
I sent her money to keep the baby,

571
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,095
but months later, I get a call
from the hospital telling me

572
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,831
my child was born
but abandoned by its mother.

573
00:46:41,544 --> 00:46:44,138
Angela and I have been 
together ever since.

574
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,091
There are some people at the diocese
that I want to talk to about Angela.

575
00:46:50,698 --> 00:46:52,807
If that's okay with you.

576
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,239
- What's happening?
-Take a look at this.

577
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,348
- Where are they going?
-I don't know.

578
00:48:34,594 --> 00:48:36,405
Jesus.

579
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:01,487
Move it!

580
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,265
Out of the way!

581
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,381
It's okay. 
It's okay.

582
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,671
Okay?

583
00:50:25,196 --> 00:50:26,823
Roger.

584
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,599
Pete.

585
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,879
- Mr. Holmes.
-What happened?

586
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,255
I have your daughter's release forms
for you to sign.

587
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,469
Great. 
Where is my daughter?

588
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,528
I just need to get your signature
and then you can take her home, okay?

589
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:43,588
Where is she? 
How is she?

590
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,252
I just need your signature and then...

591
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,279
Stop talking about these forms
and tell me about my daughter.

592
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,298
You're good, you're good, you're good.
I got this.

593
00:50:52,323 --> 00:50:54,079
They're not going to 
help her here.

594
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,839
We're going to take care of her, okay?

595
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,744
We're going to get her
the help that she needs.

596
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:00,507
Just sign the papers.

597
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,701
Thank you.

598
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,946
She's downstairs.

599
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,095
Outside.

600
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,279
Outside?

601
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,588
- There's nothing more we can do.
-All right, let's go.

602
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,808
- Where is she?
-To your left.

603
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,543
Get her out of that thing.

604
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:48,999
Have you received the materials
from the American Archdiocese?

605
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,506
Yes.

606
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,309
Is the threat authentic?

607
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,270
I believe it is.

608
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:16,578
A raven.

609
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,981
The devil's messenger.

610
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,771
There's a spiritual marker on this girl.

611
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,582
What should we do?

612
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,944
I leave tonight.

613
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,157
I'm coming with you.

614
00:52:48,182 --> 00:52:49,617
No.

615
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,655
Cardinal, I cannot let you go alone.

616
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,707
The priest will assist. 
You must stay here.

617
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,559
You're the only one who knows the system,
the only one to protect the Archives.

618
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,721
The only one to carry on 
if I don't return.

619
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,512
<i>This is the only thing 
we have left.</i>

620
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,879
- An exorcism?
-Yeah.

621
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,906
Are you out of your mind?

622
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,064
Here it is.

623
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,104
How do you feel?

624
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:54,359
I'm ready for this.

625
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,742
No one is ready for the truth.

626
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,715
What's with the big production?

627
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,567
It helps preserve the integrity
of the church to

628
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:22,638
disprove possessions for what they are.

629
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,951
Usually some form of mental illness.

630
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,467
You are skeptical about this?

631
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,825
You can say that.

632
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,563
Can you plug this in?

633
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,552
When I was 12 years old,
I was possessed by a demon.

634
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,343
For 6 days,

635
00:55:02,368 --> 00:55:04,640
the priest battled 
the demon inside of me,

636
00:55:04,665 --> 00:55:08,839
steadfast in his belief that 
you can kill the evil spirit

637
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,381
and preserve the body.

638
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,167
And how did he do?

639
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,830
I want to see the room.

640
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,425
Why are you putting that up there?

641
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,861
I don't want it to be in the way.

642
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,626
So,

643
00:55:34,404 --> 00:55:36,991
what can you tell me about Angela?

644
00:55:42,163 --> 00:55:43,988
Angela's

645
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,026
perfect.

646
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,026
I've never heard her say
an unkind word about anyone, ever.

647
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:00,382
You see, demons can be
very shrewd and calculating.

648
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:08,230
They hide in the image of their host.
They lie and deceive using the truth.

649
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,079
We need to know Angela

650
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,065
so that we know 
what she is not.

651
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,884
Can you please give us a moment
before we begin?

652
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,279
Perhaps you can 
go check on Angela.

653
00:56:28,304 --> 00:56:30,015
Yeah, sure.

654
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,639
Prepare the Eucharist.

655
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,119
If she accepts the Body of Christ,
a demon does not exist.

656
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,739
- But she's possessed.
-She is.

657
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,071
But we will see 
what we are dealing with.

658
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,994
- Heavenly Father...
-No.

659
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:55,558
No?

660
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:57,439
Just prepare the Eucharist.

661
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,119
But the mass is essential
in preparing the Eucharist.

662
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,175
No mass.

663
00:57:02,984 --> 00:57:07,039
Sometimes, in search of 
what is an abomination,

664
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,414
we move away from God.

665
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,351
So do as I instruct tonight. Trust what I do.

666
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,262
Because a demon's greatest threat
is not to your body,

667
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,064
but your soul.

668
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,945
Bring her in.

669
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,141
It's okay.

670
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,948
This is Cardinal Bruun.

671
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,110
He's going to help you, sweetie.

672
00:57:51,418 --> 00:57:53,208
Have her kneel.

673
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,461
Come on.

674
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,984
Facing this way, please.

675
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,182
Can you kneel down, sweetie?

676
00:58:57,426 --> 00:59:00,038
- Amen.
-Amen.

677
00:59:10,778 --> 00:59:12,728
Take this body.

678
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:16,523
Take it and be cleansed.

679
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,190
Take the body.

680
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,462
Take it and be cleansed.

681
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,989
There is an obstruction.

682
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,323
Please, Angela, sit down on the bed.

683
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,583
This will be much easier
if you sit down on the bed.

684
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,301
Hey-

685
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,970
It's okay. 
I got you.

686
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,140
I promise.

687
01:00:53,435 --> 01:00:55,182
It's okay.

688
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:05,903
Now, will you allow me

689
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,639
to remove the obstruction?

690
01:01:18,562 --> 01:01:20,609
Don't. Don't.

691
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,661
Don't.

692
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,865
What does it mean?

693
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,305
They represent the Holy Trinity.

694
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:24,487
The Father, the Son, 
and the Holy Ghost.

695
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,319
Run. 
Run.

696
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,895
Run.

697
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,197
- Angela.
-Ange.

698
01:02:46,453 --> 01:02:48,709
Help me get this stuff off her.

699
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,644
- What did she say? What is that?
-I don't know. Aramaic?

700
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:21,723
- Wait, wait, wait.
-Honey?

701
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,109
- Honey.
-Ange.

702
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,119
It's going to be okay.

703
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,774
Holy water.

704
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,655
Do not remember, O Lord,

705
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,164
our sins or those of our ancestors.

706
01:04:08,189 --> 01:04:10,324
And do not punish us

707
01:04:11,277 --> 01:04:13,477
for our offenses.

708
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,364
We must continue! 
The cleansing prayer.

709
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,833
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

710
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,879
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done, on earth...

711
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,005
- Please help!
-Angela, is that you?

712
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,919
...as it is in heaven.

713
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,790
Is that you?

714
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,827
- Angela?
-Daddy.

715
01:04:34,852 --> 01:04:36,639
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm here. I'm here, sweetie.

716
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,547
- Pete!
-I'm here.

717
01:04:39,941 --> 01:04:41,561
- Did it work?
-I don't know.

718
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,417
Did it work?

719
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:53,182
Where did you get this?

720
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,639
This egg is the symbol of rebirth.

721
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,615
From where did it come?

722
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,882
I don't know what 
you're talking about.

723
01:05:01,907 --> 01:05:06,759
You revealed yourself, demon.
You can no longer hide behind this girl.

724
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,895
Speak, demon.

725
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,419
Dad.

726
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,152
Daddy, please help.

727
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:17,464
- Where did you get this?
-Dad, help me!

728
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,942
Please. 
Please.

729
01:05:20,589 --> 01:05:25,759
Demon, if you keep hiding,
I will rip out your lying tongue!

730
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,119
Where did you get this?

731
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,559
You seek to make an abomination
of our Lord and Savior,

732
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,919
of His resurrection.

733
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,999
Expose yourself, demon.

734
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,255
Help me!

735
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,919
You mean to desecrate
the works of our Lord and Savior!

736
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,912
God, it's coming back! 
It's coming back!

737
01:05:42,937 --> 01:05:44,976
Show yourself, serpent!

738
01:05:45,001 --> 01:05:47,491
Enough! 
Enough!

739
01:05:55,214 --> 01:05:59,658
I am the new way!

740
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:13,405
The new way!!

741
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:33,666
The new way.

742
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,515
I condemn you 
to the lake of fire!

743
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,861
Continue.

744
01:07:01,178 --> 01:07:06,870
Blessed by the Spirit of the Father,
I will kill this evil.

745
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:09,755
I am your Omega.
You are my Alpha.

746
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,935
My kingdom will replace yours...

747
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,064
...in Heaven and Earth...

748
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,981
It burns! 
It burns!

749
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,895
Dad. 
Pete.

750
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,443
What now?

751
01:07:27,364 --> 01:07:30,399
- Dad, Pete, please, just go.
-We're not going anywhere.

752
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,999
What happens now? 
What do we do now?

753
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,079
Just leave.

754
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,759
- We're not leaving you!
-What do we do now?

755
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,653
- Cardinal Bruun!
-Cardinal Bruun!

756
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,098
Cardinal Bruun, what do we do?

757
01:07:40,365 --> 01:07:41,872
Sweetie.

758
01:07:42,146 --> 01:07:46,412
Hey, it's going to be all right, okay?
It'll be fine. You're going to be okay.

759
01:07:57,253 --> 01:08:00,470
In the name of Jesus Christ,
our God and Lord,

760
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,279
strengthened by the intercession of the
Immaculate Virgin Mary, Mother of God.

761
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,937
Cardinal, what are you doing?

762
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,959
Remember your oath.

763
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,799
You can't kill her.
We must perform the exorcism.

764
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,146
You must perform it.

765
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:16,159
This is not an exorcism.

766
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,599
You cannot exorcise the blood.

767
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,215
The devil possesses 
what is already his.

768
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,932
How do you know that?

769
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,919
The devil has searched,
scraped for a chance to walk the earth.

770
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,519
Our Lord Jesus stopped him once,

771
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,479
but now it falls to us.

772
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,759
You said that you would 
destroy the spirit, not her body.

773
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:40,404
That body is the spirit
looking to destroy God's kingdom.

774
01:08:40,429 --> 01:08:42,879
We pull away from God
when we pursue wickedness.

775
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,639
Pulling away from God
moves us toward evil.

776
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,439
I am as close to God
as any man of the cloth.

777
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,337
You will put your faith in me.

778
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,455
Angela. 
Angela.

779
01:09:06,328 --> 01:09:09,039
- Wait, what is he doing with that?
-it's okay, Pete.

780
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,285
- No, you told me to protect you.
-Just let them do this.

781
01:09:12,344 --> 01:09:14,279
No, what are they gonna do?
Why do they have a knife?

782
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,314
It's just for the ritual, right?

783
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,849
Right?

784
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,979
Yes.

785
01:09:24,642 --> 01:09:27,422
- Okay.
-Okay?

786
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:46,359
Of the blessed Apostles
of the Father and all the saints,

787
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,399
we confidently undertake to repulse

788
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,335
the attacks and deceits of the devil.

789
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,392
Please.

790
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,550
I see you.

791
01:09:58,877 --> 01:10:01,775
In the light, your evil is nothing,

792
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,799
instigator of envy,

793
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,959
font of avarice, 
fomenter of discord,

794
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,413
author of pain and sorrow.

795
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:13,575
Why, then, do you stand and resist,
knowing as you must

796
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,769
that Christ the Lord
brings your plans to nothing?

797
01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:19,631
Fear Him,

798
01:10:20,023 --> 01:10:22,919
who in Isaac was offered in sacrifice,

799
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,905
in Joseph sold into bondage,

800
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,043
slain as the Paschal Lamb,

801
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,898
crucified as man.

802
01:10:35,254 --> 01:10:36,999
Show yourself!

803
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,792
Please kill this thing inside me!

804
01:10:43,328 --> 01:10:46,599
- Angela!
-Stay back! The demon must show itself.

805
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,495
Stop it! 
He's killing her!

806
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,965
Show yourself!

807
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:53,245
Goddamn you!

808
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,119
Angela.

809
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,839
- Angela.
-Ange.

810
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,418
Honey. 
Honey.

811
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,860
Father, do something.

812
01:11:29,313 --> 01:11:31,615
Do something!

813
01:11:47,049 --> 01:11:49,619
What did you do?

814
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:54,470
Roger, no, no, no, no!

815
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,487
Roger, Roger, stop!

816
01:11:57,512 --> 01:11:58,912
He killed my daughter.

817
01:11:58,937 --> 01:12:01,479
Roger, Roger, Roger,
take a look at the signs.

818
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,199
Her 40 days in the coma,
Christ's 40 days of temptation in the desert.

819
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,719
Her mother was a prostitute.

820
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,519
- A perversion of the Virgin Mary.
-No.

821
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,359
- The black raven mocks the white dove.
-No.No!

822
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,879
- Roger, Roger, Angela's gone. She's gone.
-No, no.

823
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,460
- She's gone!
-She's not gone!

824
01:12:14,485 --> 01:12:16,597
Roger! 
Roger!

825
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,109
Oh, my God.

826
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,990
Stigmata.

827
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,590
It's the resurrection.

828
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,279
Omega, Alpha.

829
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,851
Our ending, its beginning.

830
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,969
It's the Antichrist.

831
01:12:52,008 --> 01:12:53,781
You will all die.

832
01:13:16,113 --> 01:13:18,263
Why do you doubt...

833
01:13:23,101 --> 01:13:24,988
...what your eyes can?

834
01:13:34,772 --> 01:13:36,473
I am your ending.

835
01:13:36,498 --> 01:13:38,272
You are my beginning.

836
01:13:53,454 --> 01:13:56,919
You always knew we would meet again...

837
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,319
Though I walk

838
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,748
through the valley of the 
shadows of death,

839
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,673
I will show no fear

840
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,319
for thou art with me.

841
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,215
Ange, what are you doing?

842
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:32,939
Today you will be with me...

843
01:14:32,964 --> 01:14:34,491
...in paradise!

844
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,332
I'm not afraid of you.

845
01:15:22,385 --> 01:15:25,220
You tell them I am here.

846
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,348
You tell them 
I walk the earth.

847
01:15:44,687 --> 01:15:48,071
THREE MONTHS LATER

848
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,728
- Here it is.
-Thank you for keeping the tape secret.

849
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,608
You have witnessed
the rising of the Antichrist.

850
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,708
That's what she wanted.

851
01:16:09,674 --> 01:16:13,872
You are the only one
who has faced the ending and survived.

852
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,902
There's a reason for that.

853
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,424
You're one of us now, 
a warrior of God.

854
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,178
There's something I must show you.

855
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,113
Come and see.

856
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,065
What is this place?

857
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,823
These are the Archives,

858
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,189
where we keep the records
of the devil's work on earth.

859
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,603
Follow me.

860
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,439
Much has happened 
during your recovery.

861
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,938
<i>Local officials remain unclear
on the cause of the explosion.</i>

862
01:17:52,963 --> 01:17:57,180
<i>The victims have been identified
as US Army Colonel Roger Holmes,</i>

863
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:59,088
<i>26-year-old Peter Smith,</i>

864
01:17:59,113 --> 01:18:02,268
<i>and Mattias Bruun,
a Cardinal residing at the Vatican.</i>

865
01:18:02,293 --> 01:18:06,499
<i>A representative said that Bruun's visit
was not connected to Church affairs</i>

866
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:10,105
<i>and that he was in the US
on a personal vacation.</i>

867
01:18:11,401 --> 01:18:15,107
<i>One of the survivors, Father Oscar Lozano
from the Los Angeles Archdiocese</i>

868
01:18:15,132 --> 01:18:18,379
<i>currently is recovering at
Saint Mary's Hospital from multiple injuries.</i>

869
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,259
<i>Another survivor, Angela Holmes,</i>

870
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:23,179
<i>was seen by a neighbor emerging
from the rubble without a scratch.</i>

871
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:26,964
<i>Miss Holmes reportedly has no memory
of the events leading up to the blast.</i>

872
01:18:26,989 --> 01:18:28,734
And then

873
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:31,266
it began.

874
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:36,475
<i>Unbelievable event taking place
at the 6th Street homeless shelter.</i>

875
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,339
<i>Multiple miracles have been reported</i>

876
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:41,099
<i>from the curing of a 
young girl with leukemia</i>

877
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:45,396
<i>to restoring the sight of a man
who lost his sight in an industrial accident.</i>

878
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:48,299
<i>Hundreds of people
have gathered outside this shelter</i>

879
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,499
<i>in hopes that they, too, 
can be healed.</i>

880
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:54,658
<i>At that moment, 
I could feel my legs again.</i>

881
01:18:54,683 --> 01:18:57,634
<i>This isn't an isolated incident.</i>

882
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:02,339
<i>This is hundreds of people documented,
restored to health.</i>

883
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:08,284
<i>There is no medical explanation for this.</i>

884
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:10,979
<i>So, what is it?</i>

885
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,859
<i>Where does this power come from?</i>

886
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,162
<i>Is it divine?</i>

887
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:18,489
<i>I don't know.</i>

888
01:19:20,472 --> 01:19:23,788
<i>I just want to help 
as many people as I can.</i>

889
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:28,398
<i>This only adds to the storm of controversy
surrounding Angela Holmes,</i>

890
01:19:28,423 --> 01:19:33,755
<i>who, in two short months, has inspired
an ever-growing legion of faithful followers.</i>

891
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:36,739
<i>Some are calling her a saint,
others a charlatan.</i>

892
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:39,918
<i>But tonight, thousands have gathered
inside this arena</i>

893
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:45,916
<i>to find out first-hand if Angela Holmes
is, indeed, a miracle worker.</i>

894
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,391
Miss Holmes? 
It's time.

895
01:20:06,993 --> 01:20:10,142
<i>The Book of Revelation says,</i>

896
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:13,299
<i>one will come to mimic the Christ</i>

897
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:17,315
<i>and the deceived will worship
this false prophet.</i>

898
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:22,659
<i>And that is the day we most fear.</i>
