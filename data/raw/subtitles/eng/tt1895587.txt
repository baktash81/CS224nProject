2
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:24,919
How's that going?

3
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:27,172
The mother's bawling
and the uncle's pissed off.

4
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:28,965
She's not married?

5
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:31,259
Divorced with four kids.

6
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,344
I guess Father
was helping out.

7
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,096
Helping out?

8
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:40,018
Hey, Mr. Burke,
they're in back talking to the bishop.

9
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,562
And Father?
We put him in the break room.

10
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,105
Any press?

11
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,274
Some guy from the <i>Citizen</i>
but we sent him away.

12
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,734
None of the big papers.

13
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:50,111
Let's keep it that way.

14
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,614
Who's that?
Assistant DA.

15
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,658
It's gonna be hard to keep the
papers away from the arraignment.

16
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,203
What arraignment?

17
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,832
You can tell Father Geoghan
it won't be much longer.

18
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:09,923
Now, Sheila, you know what good
work the church does in the community.

19
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,342
But I give you
my personal guarantee

20
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,844
that I'm going to take
Father out of the parish,

21
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:17,472
and this will never
happen again.

22
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:21,142
We'll just be
another moment, Paul.

23
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:23,478
Of course, Father.

24
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,815
Now, Sheila, I'm going
to give you my personal card...

25
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:07,355
Losing a good reporter
is always tough.

26
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,233
But losing
one of our best...

27
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,403
Well, to put it
as eloquently as I can,

28
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:14,696
it's a real kick in the ass.

29
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:18,032
But, Robby here
has known Stewart

30
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,868
longer than most of you
have been alive,

31
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:22,328
so, I'll hand it off
to him. Robby.

32
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:25,957
Oh, well, thanks, Ben.
I think.

33
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:30,128
Although I take issue with your
reference to my seniority,

34
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:35,091
I will say that Stewart's departure
is especially painful for me

35
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,802
because, uh...
For what, Stewart?

36
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,387
Twenty years now?

37
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,556
Stewart's been more
than willing to part

38
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,057
with his money
at the poker table.

39
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:47,186
And I've got a kid
in college.

40
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:49,814
Yeah, but I'm gonna keep playing.
Oh, problem solved.

41
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:52,317
Godspeed then.

42
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:58,573
Now, Stewart, I find the
timing of your departure

43
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,657
disconcerting.

44
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:03,161
The corner office sits empty,

45
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,413
the new editor
arrives on Monday,

46
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:09,167
so I'm sorry, buddy,
but I gotta ask ya.

47
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,294
What the hell
do you know?

48
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:30,104
How's the cake?

49
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:32,357
It's really good.
Are you saving yours?

50
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,317
Nah, it's for Mike.
I can never eat at those things.

51
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,736
They kind of depress me.
I know.

52
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,071
Did you see the numbers
from Washington?

53
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:40,782
Yeah. Very interesting.
I think so, too.

54
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:43,242
I'm not asking if the PD's lying,
I know they're lying.

55
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,244
All I'm asking,
who's behind it?

56
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,957
Oh. Okay, I get it.
You don't want to talk.

57
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,584
No, Dan, I'm not mad,
I'm hungry.

58
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:53,336
I've been talking here
so long I didn't eat lunch.

59
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,796
So I'm gonna go
get something to eat,

60
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,214
and that'll give you
an hour to decide

61
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,632
whether you want to be
on the right side of this

62
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,509
or read about it
like everybody else.

63
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:00,593
Bye, Dan.

64
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:02,428
You think
Cahill has something?

65
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,555
Maybe. I just don't think
the story's for us.

66
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,809
Ben likes it. Yeah, it's not bad,
it's just not Spotlight.

67
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:08,935
What's just not Spotlight?

68
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,260
The PD numbers.
The numbers story. It feels thin.

69
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:13,982
Oh, you got Cahill to talk?

70
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:16,901
No, but I will.

71
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,862
Good. Then we'll know
if it's thin.

72
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:23,491
- How'd it go upstairs?
- Oh, okay.

73
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,994
- Robby gave a good speech.
- Sure he did.

74
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:27,787
I heard Lubin and Connor
are going to the <i>Times.</i>

75
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,288
- Come on, really?
- Yeah, I heard that.

76
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:30,373
They're leeching us.

77
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,542
Well, at least they're sending us
a guy from Miami to run things.

78
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,710
That should help.

79
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:36,045
Has Baron even
spent time in Boston?

80
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:38,673
I don't think he's ever been here before.
Maybe we should buy him a map.

81
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,160
I have a friend down in Miami
said he cut 15% of the staff.

82
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:42,593
Great...
Hey, Robby.

83
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,262
New boss coming in
to make some cuts?

84
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,180
I have no idea.

85
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,211
Aren't you sitting down
with him?

86
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,685
Yes, I am.
So is it about Spotlight?

87
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:53,104
I don't know, Mike,
but I do know

88
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,982
that Ben needs an answer
on the crime numbers story.

89
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,207
I'm telling you,
I really don't think that story's for us.

90
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:05,867
Mr. Baron.

91
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,411
Walter Robinson. Robby.

92
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,039
Thanks for taking the time
out of your weekend.

93
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,623
Oh, my pleasure.
Appreciate it.

94
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,916
What are you reading?

95
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,169
Uh...

96
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:17,754
<i>The Curse of the Bambino.</i>

97
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,922
Oh, yeah,
it's a great book.

98
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:22,383
The <i>Globe</i> has
season tickets at Fenway

99
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,010
once you're settled in,
by the way.

100
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,553
Thank you.

101
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,473
Uh, to be honest,
I'm not much of a baseball fan.

102
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:31,142
I'm just trying to
get a feel for the city.

103
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,478
Oh, yeah...

104
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,354
So you're originally
from Boston?

105
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,356
I am. Born and raised, yeah.

106
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,609
A lot of the newsroom
is from here.

107
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:42,987
It really feels like
a local paper in that way.

108
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:46,657
And did that change at all after
the paper was sold to the <i>Times?</i>

109
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:50,912
No. No, I don't think
that had a big impact.

110
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,830
Good.

111
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,418
And you're an editor
for the Spotlight team?

112
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,130
I'd prefer to think of myself
as player coach. But yes.

113
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,091
Are you familiar
with Spotlight?

114
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:05,301
No, not particularly.

115
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:08,805
Well, we are a four-person
investigative team.

116
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,516
We report to
Ben Bradlee, Jr.,

117
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,684
and we keep
our work confidential.

118
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:16,854
What're you
working on now?

119
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:20,441
We just put out a piece on a
shoddy construction outfit,

120
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:24,195
and right now we're really just
trolling around for our next story.

121
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,364
How long does
that typically take?

122
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,575
Hard to say.
A couple months.

123
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,702
Couple months?

124
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,038
Yeah, we don't like to
rush it.

125
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:39,377
Once we settle on a project, we can
spend a year or more investigating it.

126
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,715
Is that a concern?
Not necessarily.

127
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,511
Um, but from what I understand
readership is down,

128
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:50,972
Internet is cutting into
the classified business, and.

129
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:54,142
I think I'm gonna need to
take a hard look at things.

130
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,938
So, do you anticipate
more cuts?

131
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:03,317
I think it's safe
to assume so,

132
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:07,321
but what I'm more focused on
right now is finding a way

133
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:10,950
to make this paper
essential to its readers.

134
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,203
I like to think
it already is.

135
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:19,500
Fair enough. I just think
that we can do better.

136
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,055
Mr. Bradlee.
Hey.

137
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,266
Saw the PD numbers.
Looks interesting.

138
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,549
Yeah, there's something there.

139
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,811
How long do you need?
Another week.

140
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:42,148
Where're you going?
10:30.

141
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,733
Since when?

142
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,068
Technically,
I am an editor.

143
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,403
Technically.

144
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,447
Your sit-down with Baron
go that well?

145
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:52,491
I couldn't get a read on him.
That's a first.

146
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:55,369
How about you?
Oh, he's a barrel of laughs.

147
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:59,248
Morning, everyone.
Let's get started.

148
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,043
Do you wanna
say something, Marty?

149
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,753
Uh, sure.

150
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:06,881
Uh, hello.

151
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:11,677
As most of you know by now,
my name is Marty Baron,

152
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:15,097
I'm delighted to be here.

153
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,811
Um, if you could tell me your name
as we go around, that'd be helpful.

154
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,230
Thank you.

155
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,524
Okay. Peter?

156
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,235
Peter Canellos, Metro.

157
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:30,029
I've got a major
Big Dig closure.

158
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,492
Hey, Steve. Hey.
Mike.

159
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,994
Crappy game
last night, huh?

160
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,038
Yeah, they can't hit
worth a nickel.

161
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:42,625
Hey listen, what's Eileen McNamara
doing in the 10:30?

162
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,128
Do you need something, Mike?
No, just curious.

163
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:48,547
Go be curious somewhere else.
I got work to do, huh?

164
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:49,924
Okay, Steve.

165
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,425
See you.
Yeah.

166
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:54,553
And it looks like Pedro's gonna
be out until September 1st.

167
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,348
Jimmy says he'll be back this year,
but the doc didn't seem so sure.

168
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:58,975
When's the Pats' opener?

169
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,314
Is that everyone?

170
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,441
Yes, that's it.
Okay. Good.

171
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,193
Thank you. Uh...

172
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,406
Did everyone read
Eileen McNamara's column this weekend?

173
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:15,700
That's the Geoghan case?

174
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,702
Yeah, what's the folo
on that?

175
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,622
It's a column, what kind
of folo were you thinking?

176
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:25,501
Uh, well, apparently
this priest molested kids

177
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,545
in six different parishes
over the last 30 years,

178
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:30,006
and the attorney
for the victims, Mr...

179
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,216
Garabedian.
Thanks, Eileen.

180
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,468
Mr. Garabedian says
Cardinal Law found out

181
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,345
about it 15 years ago
and did nothing.

182
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,014
Yeah, I think that
attorney's a bit of a crank,

183
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,598
and the church
dismissed the claim.

184
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:40,850
He said, she said.

185
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,977
Whether Mr. Garabedian
is a crank or not

186
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,479
he says he has documents
that prove the cardinal knew.

187
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,065
As I understand it,
those documents are under seal.

188
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:51,986
Okay, but the fact remains,
a Boston priest abused 80 kids,

189
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:54,613
we have a lawyer who says he
can prove Law knew about it,

190
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,117
and we've written all of, uh,
two stories in the last six months.

191
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,496
This strikes me as an essential
story to a local paper.

192
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:06,000
I think at the very least, we have
to go through those documents.

193
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:07,877
How would you
like to do that?

194
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:09,879
Oh, uh...

195
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:11,839
I don't know
what the laws are here,

196
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,758
but in Florida
we would go to court.

197
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:15,843
You want to sue the church?

198
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,512
Technically we wouldn't
sue the church.

199
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:21,265
We'd file a motion to lift
the seal on those documents.

200
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,476
The church will read that
as us suing them.

201
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,644
So will everybody else.

202
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,314
Good to know.

203
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,651
Gutsy call
for the first day.

204
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,944
That's one word for it.

205
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,911
How do you think that's
gonna play down front?

206
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,823
I think Gilman's
gonna shit a brick.

207
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,533
Hey.
Door.

208
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,243
How'd it go?

209
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:45,206
Well, Baron wants to sue for the
sealed docs in the Geoghan case.

210
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,250
Wants to sue the church?
Hey, that's great.

211
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,462
We covered Geoghan when the
story broke three years ago.

212
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,214
Baron was still in Miami.

213
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,257
I think he might have been
at the <i>Times</i> then, actually.

214
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:56,384
He wasn't here.

215
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,987
So do you think
that suit has a chance?

216
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,679
Depends on the judge.

217
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,973
And what parish he belongs to.

218
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,936
Bradlee. Yeah.

219
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:08,938
Okay.

220
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:11,899
Baron wants to talk to us.

221
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:13,859
Us?

222
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,945
Okay, Jon. Thank you.

223
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,823
Yes. Okay, thanks.

224
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,702
I've set up a meeting for
tomorrow with outside counsel.

225
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,454
Jon Albano?
Yeah.

226
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,123
Who's the judge
in this case?

227
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,125
Um...

228
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,335
Constance Sweeney.

229
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,212
Tough.
Why's that?

230
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,090
Good Catholic girl.
Huh.

231
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,552
So, um,

232
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,762
judging from what I've read,
it doesn't seem like we've done

233
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:44,723
a very thorough investigation
into the Geoghan case.

234
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,809
Is that right?
No, it's not.

235
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:48,978
We looked hard at Geoghan.

236
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:52,148
David Armstrong from Metro,
Michael Paulson for Religion.

237
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,401
Okay, but, uh,
just so I understand,

238
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,903
beyond our daily coverage,
we haven't...

239
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,990
We haven't committed any long-term
investigative resources

240
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:03,659
to the question of whether or not
Cardinal Law knew about this?

241
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,412
No, we haven't.

242
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,751
And that's the kind of thing
your team would do?

243
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:10,249
Spotlight? Well, yeah.

244
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,128
But we're still prospecting the
Boston PD story I told you about.

245
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:16,547
Could you set that aside?

246
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:17,882
We could.

247
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,802
Marty, in past Spotlight's
had success in large part

248
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,409
because they pick
their own projects.

249
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,185
Would you consider
picking this one?

250
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,604
I don't know if
he's writing about you,

251
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,439
but I will let him know
you called.

252
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,065
Okay, bye.

253
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,234
Hey.
Hey, how'd it go?

254
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,154
Okay. Uh...

255
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,823
Baron wants us to scrub
the Geoghan case.

256
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,285
That's great.
Didn't we cover Geoghan?

257
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,871
Yeah, there's a lawyer alleging
Cardinal Law knew about it.

258
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,719
- Mmm. Mitch Garabedian, right?
- Yeah.

259
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:51,988
I covered him
at the courthouse.

260
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,296
Can you get to him?
I only interviewed him once.

261
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:55,669
He's kind of a character.

262
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:57,046
I like characters.
I'll take him.

263
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,339
Good. You take him.

264
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,382
Also, we should be
talking to, uh,

265
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,343
the lawyer who repped the
victims in the Porter case.

266
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,427
Eric Macleish.
Uh-huh.

267
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,388
That guy was always on TV.
Yeah, the Porter case?

268
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,225
Remind me.
Yeah, um, Father Porter, similar story.

269
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,769
Molested dozens of kids in
Fall River about 10 years ago.

270
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,145
So, we're dropping
the Boston PD?

271
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:14,355
I vote yes.
No, no.

272
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,357
We just gotta set
it aside for now.

273
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,025
Listen, I don't need
to tell you guys this.

274
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,693
We need to be more
discreet than usual.

275
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:20,986
All right?

276
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,572
Everybody's gonna be interested in this,
not just the <i>Herald.</i>

277
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,959
We can't let Cardinal Law get wind
of this until we know what we have.

278
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,453
Good luck with that.

279
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,544
<i>So when
do you leave, Nana?</i>

280
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,630
The bus is picking us up in the
church parking lot at 9:00.

281
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,090
We have 40 people going.

282
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:42,800
And is Father Dominic going?

283
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,802
No, he says
he's unlucky.

284
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:46,554
But luck has nothing
to do with it.

285
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,473
You know, last time Nana won $160.
Wow.

286
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,602
You gonna tell her?

287
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:56,355
We don't even know
if there's a story yet.

288
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,983
Well, <i>"Globe</i> sues church"?
It's gonna be a story.

289
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,672
Hey, Lisa. Could you pull all the
relevant clips on that for me?

290
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,340
Yeah.

291
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:24,925
Is this for Spotlight?

292
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,892
Just drop them off
when they're ready? Thanks.

293
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,141
Excuse me, do you know where
the publisher's office is?

294
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,685
Will do.

295
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,315
How are you, Marty?

296
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,025
Settling in?

297
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,694
Yeah, I think so.
Good.

298
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,362
What can I do for you?

299
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,197
Um...

300
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,701
I'd like to challenge the protective
order in the Geoghan case.

301
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,203
You want to sue
the Catholic Church?

302
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:54,538
Um...

303
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,042
We're just
filing a motion, but...

304
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,209
Yes.

305
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,211
You think
it's that important?

306
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,756
Yes, I do.

307
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,801
Because obviously the Church
will fight us very hard on this.

308
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,471
Which won't go unnoticed
by our subscriber base.

309
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,222
53% of them are Catholic.

310
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,058
Mmm-hmm.

311
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,727
I think
they'll be interested.

312
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,398
Okay.

313
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,864
Marty, Lake Street
will probably contact you

314
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,032
about a face-to-face
with the Cardinal.

315
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,116
It's customary.

316
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,120
Yeah. They already have.
It's set up for next week.

317
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:38,290
I wouldn't mention this.

318
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,260
Hello?

319
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,182
Hello?

320
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,517
Can I help you?
Oh, hi.

321
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,160
I'm Mike Rezendes
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

322
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,812
I'm here to see
Mitchell Garabedian.

323
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,398
He's on a call.
Please have a seat.

324
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,483
Okay.

325
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,444
All right, I'm listening.
Go ahead.

326
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,448
Okay.

327
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:14,034
Bill! Where the hell
are those papers?

328
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,078
I asked you to
put 'em on my desk!

329
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:34,263
The famous Walter Robinson
in my conference room.

330
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,592
Good to see you again, Eric.

331
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,016
Sacha Pfeiffer,
Eric Macleish.

332
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,143
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

333
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,228
You don't play golf,
do you?

334
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,272
Uh, no.
Good.

335
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,690
Your colleague here
took some money off me

336
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:45,941
at a charity event
last year.

337
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,319
It was a very lucky putt. I actually
had my eyes closed, by the way.

338
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,779
Mmm-hmm.

339
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,698
So, how can I help
you guys?

340
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:53,907
Uh...

341
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,201
You're familiar
with the Geoghan case?

342
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,578
Sure.

343
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,622
Eighty plaintiffs.
All of them individual cases.

344
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,291
Garabedian must be swimming.

345
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,044
Well. And the allegations
against Cardinal Law?

346
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,380
Yeah, it's tricky. Um...

347
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,134
This is what you need to understand.
These are shitty cases.

348
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,596
The statute of limitations
is only three years,

349
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,807
and most of these victims don't
come forward until long after that.

350
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,768
Oh. Why is that?

351
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,519
Well, they're kids,
you know.

352
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,104
Guilt, shame.

353
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,939
And most of these kids come
from tough neighborhoods.

354
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:29,026
Nobody wants to admit
this kind of thing.

355
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,403
So, you're screwed
on the time limit.

356
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,113
And, uh,

357
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,865
even if you argue
your way around that

358
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,202
the charitable immunity statute
caps damages at 20 grand.

359
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,914
Twenty grand for
molesting a child?

360
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,834
That is the way
the system is set up. Yes.

361
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,504
The Church is tough.

362
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,964
So, your best shot
is to try these cases

363
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,051
in the press
like I did on Porter.

364
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,178
Hmm. But, you know,
most of the victims,

365
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,930
they don't wanna have
anything to do with TV.

366
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,515
And, uh,

367
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:03,101
Mitch isn't exactly
a people person.

368
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,313
Yeah, and if Garabedian
can't get his victims

369
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,982
to go before the press,
then he's really...

370
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,152
That's right.
He has a long road ahead of him.

371
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:15,739
My guess is he doesn't
have anything on Law.

372
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,534
What? You think
he's bluffing or...

373
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,412
I think he's grandstanding
to cut a better deal.

374
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:24,873
Seems a bit reckless.

375
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,168
Have you met
Mitch Garabedian?

376
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,090
I asked you to write up that motion,
Bill. I didn't ask you to file it.

377
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:46,228
Hey, Bill, here's
the case files from yesterday.

378
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:56,947
Hi.

379
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,868
Who are you?
I'm Mike Rezendes from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

380
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,244
I had an appointment
with you about an hour ago.

381
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,246
I can't talk to you.
I'm very busy. Sharon!

382
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,456
No, no. She went out for coffee.
She said she'd be right back.

383
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,083
I'm following up
on an article.

384
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,086
The one in the <i>Phoenix?</i>
No. In the <i>Globe.</i>

385
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,821
Did you see
the one in the <i>Phoenix?</i>

386
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,897
No, I didn't.
I thought it was very good.

387
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,133
I have a copy here somewhere.

388
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,740
That's all right.
I'll track it down.

389
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:19,887
I'm actually
following up on a column

390
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,805
that Eileen McNamara
wrote about your suit.

391
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,182
Suits.
There are 84 of them.

392
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,392
It's not a class action.

393
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,997
You should get your facts straight.
No, you're right. I should.

394
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,480
So I'm trying to get some
background information on...

395
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,399
You're not
recording this, are you?

396
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,401
No, I wouldn't do
that without asking.

397
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,820
I can't show you those Church's
documents if that's what you're after.

398
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,071
They're under seal.

399
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,656
Yeah, I know that.

400
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,742
Did you know that
they tried to bring me up

401
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,620
before the Massachusetts Board
of Bar Overseers three times?

402
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,204
They're watching me
very closely.

403
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,916
The Church?
Yeah. The Church. Yeah.

404
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,251
They'd like to get me disbarred.
In fact, put that away.

405
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:53,795
Put it away.
Sure.

406
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,672
I don't want you recording this
in any way, shape or form.

407
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,674
Not on paper,
not on tape, nothing.

408
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,594
In fact, I probably shouldn't
even be speaking to you. So...

409
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,012
Look, Mr. Garabedian,

410
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,848
I know there's things
you cannot tell me,

411
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:06,808
but I also know
there's a story here.

412
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,292
And I think
it's an important story.

413
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,145
I already talked
to the <i>Phoenix.</i>

414
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,908
Yeah, and there's a reason
I didn't see it.

415
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,232
Nobody reads
the <i>Phoenix</i> anymore.

416
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,943
They're broke.
They don't have any power.

417
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,527
The <i>Globe</i> does.

418
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,656
If we cover this story,
everybody will hear about it.

419
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:25,202
The Church thinks
in centuries, Mr. Rezendes.

420
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:28,121
Do you think your paper has the
resources to take that on?

421
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,706
Yeah, I do.

422
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,834
But if you don't
mind me asking,

423
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,002
do you?

424
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:38,048
I can't talk to you right now,
Mr. Rezendes, I'm very, very busy.

425
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,679
Sharon? Yeah.
Thank you.

426
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,223
Can I at least talk to some
of your clients? The victims?

427
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,975
I'd really like
to do that.

428
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,352
Call me tomorrow, I gotta think about it.
Thank you.

429
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,436
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah.

430
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,199
I got more clips
from the library.

431
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,743
Leave 'em right there.

432
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,412
Are you guys doing
a story on the Church?

433
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,789
No, we are not doing
a story on the Church.

434
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,917
Matt, you find anything
on this guy, Phil Saviano?

435
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,961
No. Who is he?

436
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,629
He's part of
a victims' organization.

437
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,497
Kurkjian did a story on him
right after the Porter case.

438
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,801
There's a victims'
organization?

439
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,595
Yeah, it's called SNAP.

440
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,805
It's Survivors Network
of those Abused by Priests.

441
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,640
- Crummy acronym.
- Hmm.

442
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,146
You want me to track him down?
Yeah. Bring him in.

443
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,315
How much longer you need
to get through the clips?

444
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,817
I mean, a few days.
There's a lot.

445
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,360
Lisa's still sending up more.
Okay.

446
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:25,655
Hey, guys. I think I got
another priest.

447
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:29,743
Liam Barrett.
Molested some kids in Philly

448
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,578
and was moved to Boston.

449
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,914
Did the same thing
and was moved again.

450
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,624
Really?
That sounds like Geoghan.

451
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,917
Is that one of our clips?

452
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,586
Yeah. Byline's
Diego Ribadeneira, 1997.

453
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,509
Must've been back when
he was working Religion.

454
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,758
Was there any folo?
Not much. One short piece.

455
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,886
Huh.
The Church settled the case.

456
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,724
Don't you know
Jim Sullivan?

457
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,851
Yeah. Why?

458
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,104
Looks like the Church
brought him in to help out.

459
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,947
Jesus...

460
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,270
Has anybody but Manny gotten
the ball out of the infield?

461
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,619
Nope. Why do you even
bother with that thing?

462
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,663
It distracts me
from the game.

463
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,581
Know what else
is good for that?

464
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,918
Oh, yeah. Good idea.
My round. I'll be right back.

465
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:21,503
Anybody want any food?
No.

466
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,171
I'm all set.
Hey, a hot dog.

467
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,092
So you guys
making any progress?

468
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:30,262
Absolutely. It's a good story.
Why?

469
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,806
Because you're another lapsed
Catholic pissed off at the Church?

470
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,975
We've got a lot of good stuff.
Like what?

471
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,687
I'm just watching the game.
Omertà.

472
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,273
They got another priest,
Liam Barrett.

473
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,566
We reported on him.

474
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:44,860
I'm just saying, we did.
Okay,

475
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:47,743
but this guy was shuffled around from
parish to parish every few years,

476
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:48,989
just like Geoghan
and Porter.

477
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,407
I think there's a pattern.

478
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,743
Sounds thin.
What else you got?

479
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,706
Sacha's got another guy from a
victims' organization, Phil Saviano.

480
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,750
From SNAP? Oh, boy.
We reported on him, too.

481
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,961
I thought you were watching
the game, Steve.

482
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,364
That guy's pretty
banged up, Mike.

483
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,672
We did a couple
stories on him.

484
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,315
That guy would not
stop writing letters.

485
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:08,717
He wants a holy war.

486
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,093
What? So he's not
worth talking to?

487
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,428
Where are you
on Garabedian?

488
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,721
I'm working on it.

489
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,723
Robby said Macleish
thinks he's bluffing.

490
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,017
I think there's
something there, Ben.

491
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,020
Get me something solid,
or I'm taking you off it.

492
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,646
I don't want us chasing
our tails on this.

493
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,657
Stay away
from that trap.

494
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:35,064
You couldn't reach that
trap in a million years, partner.

495
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,078
I've reached that trap before.

496
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,122
Yeah? Now Paul, maybe.

497
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,000
- How we doing?
- We're good.

498
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,919
We're two up in the front.

499
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,587
Good.

500
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,074
How's that new editor
working out?

501
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,758
Well, he doesn't
like baseball.

502
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,969
But he seems like
a smart guy.

503
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,055
Yeah, I read an article
about him.

504
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:58,225
Said he's the first
Jewish editor at the <i>Globe.</i>

505
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,394
Must have been
a slow news day.

506
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:03,521
He got a family,
this guy?

507
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,941
No. He is not married.

508
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:08,777
Divorced?
I don't think so, no.

509
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:12,239
So the new editor of the <i>Globe</i> is an
unmarried man of the Jewish faith

510
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,157
who hates baseball?

511
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,451
Yeah.
Should have given it to Ben.

512
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,411
He's a Bradlee,
for crying out loud.

513
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:21,122
Didn't raise his hand
fast enough, I guess.

514
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,583
Hey, by the way,

515
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,835
I've been reading about this priest,
Father Barrett.

516
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,337
Said you were
involved with that.

517
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:30,048
Barrett, yeah. Bad egg.

518
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:32,274
Lake Street asked
for help, I pitched in.

519
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:37,347
Victims said Cardinal Law knew about
Barrett when he came from Philly.

520
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:38,932
Is that true?

521
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,268
You know I can't talk
about the case, Robby.

522
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,354
Off the record?

523
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,232
Off the record
I can't talk about it.

524
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,943
All right.
This related to the lawsuit?

525
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,153
You know about that?

526
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:54,990
Look,

527
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,742
I don't know this guy Baron
or what his agenda is.

528
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,494
Frankly, I don't care.

529
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,455
I just don't want to see you
taking a bullet for him.

530
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,791
I think you're away.

531
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,798
Put it over here.
Let's go. Let's go.

532
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:15,802
<i>So the other day
I was on the World Wide Web.</i>

533
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,471
<i>Anything you want to know.
It's right there.</i>

534
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,850
Now, I have to admit
that as a priest,

535
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,144
this makes me
a little nervous.

536
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,355
Should I be worried
about job security?

537
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,400
I don't think so.

538
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:33,653
<i>You see,
knowledge is one thing,</i>

539
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,822
<i>but faith...</i>

540
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,991
<i>Faith is another.</i>

541
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:54,299
Hey.

542
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:55,842
Hey.

543
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,512
Shouldn't you be
golfing or something?

544
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,015
Golfing's not a verb.

545
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,933
And I couldn't get
a tee time.

546
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,353
Is that what they call it?
"Tee time"?

547
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,856
They also call it "a leisure activity."
You ought to try it, Mike.

548
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:13,026
I do. I run.
Yeah, you run to work.

549
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:17,530
So why are you here today?

550
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,075
Going over these clips
of Saviano.

551
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,619
Yep, Ben and Steve
think it's a dead end.

552
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,662
They gave me a bunch of
crap about it at the game.

553
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,289
Yeah, Ben emailed me.

554
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:28,249
He did?
Yeah.

555
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,752
He said we should
let it go.

556
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,629
What do you wanna do?

557
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,881
I wanna bring Saviano in.

558
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:38,093
So, just ignore those guys?

559
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,807
I think we've got to start
ignoring everybody on this one.

560
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,809
I'm good with that.

561
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,185
Mmm.

562
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:53,775
Do you think Marty has any idea
what's coming down the pike?

563
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,986
Nope. I don't think
he cares either.

564
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,780
That's refreshing.

565
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:00,198
Yeah.

566
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,119
Unless he's wrong.

567
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,765
<i>I've always been
fascinated with the newspaper business.</i>

568
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,852
I used to sit in on the lectures
with the Nieman fellows

569
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,437
when I was at Harvard.

570
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,691
I read that you were
an editor once.

571
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,860
Oh, yes.

572
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,654
Yeah, that was
a very long time ago.

573
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:42,157
The <i>Mississippi Register.</i>

574
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,493
Small, diocesan newspaper.

575
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:50,957
But for a 30-year-old pastor,
it was a big responsibility.

576
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,334
Too much at times.

577
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:55,962
How so?

578
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:00,383
I was close with
the Evers brothers.

579
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,886
We took a stand
on civil rights.

580
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,472
Our readership
was not pleased.

581
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:08,308
They saw me
as a meddling outsider.

582
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:11,686
I can imagine.

583
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,521
Tough seat to sit in,

584
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,607
especially in a small town.

585
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:20,403
I think you'll find that Boston's
still a small town, too, Marty,

586
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,030
in many ways.

587
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:27,744
But if I can be of any help,
Marty, don't hesitate to ask.

588
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:31,206
I find that
the city flourishes

589
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,541
when its great institutions
work together.

590
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,503
Thank you.

591
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,839
Personally I'm of the opinion that for
a paper to best perform its function,

592
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,884
it really needs
to stand alone.

593
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,222
Ah. Of course.

594
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,016
But my offer still stands.

595
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,227
Thank you.

596
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,812
Come in.

597
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:56,689
Ah!

598
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,651
Thank you, Maureen.

599
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,988
A little gift, Marty.

600
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:09,035
Think of it as a Cardinal's
guide to the city of Boston.

601
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:28,346
I'm here to see
Sacha Pfeiffer.

602
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,598
Your name?
Phil Saviano.

603
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:32,517
Okay, just a minute.

604
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,020
So am I the first
survivor you've talked to?

605
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,522
Yeah, Phil.
You are.

606
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:39,524
Okay, well...

607
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:43,236
First of all, let me say thank you
for having me in today.

608
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,321
And I want you to know

609
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:48,449
that you have the full cooperation
of my organization, SNAP.

610
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,451
How many members are in
your organization, Phil?

611
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,829
We had 11 at
our last chapter meeting...

612
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,498
Uh, no, 10.
Karen just moved.

613
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,542
You had a woman
in your group?

614
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,252
Of course there was a woman.
They don't discriminate,

615
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,628
not when it comes to abuse.

616
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,463
And this has nothing
to do with being gay.

617
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:05,174
What this is, is priests using
the collar to rape kids.

618
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,594
Kids. Boys and girls.

619
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,561
I was 11,

620
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,897
and I was preyed upon by Father
David Holley in Worcester.

621
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:23,151
And I don't mean prayed for.
I mean preyed upon.

622
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,446
Are any of you Catholic?

623
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:30,742
I was raised Catholic.
Now I go to my wife's Presbyterian church.

624
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,369
I'm lapsed.

625
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,213
I go to church with
my grandmother sometimes.

626
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,083
It's safe to say we were all
raised Catholic, but now...

627
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:40,835
Not so much.

628
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,920
Okay. Well,
let me tell you.

629
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:46,591
When you're a poor kid from a poor
family, religion counts for a lot.

630
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,761
And when a priest pays attention
to you, it's a big deal.

631
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:51,888
He asks you to collect
the hymnals

632
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,931
or take out the trash,
you feel special.

633
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,184
It's like God
asking for help.

634
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,312
So maybe it's a little weird
when he tells you a dirty joke,

635
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:03,232
but now you got a secret
together, so you go along.

636
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:07,111
Then he shows you a porno mag,
and you go along.

637
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,822
And you go along,
and you go along,

638
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:13,242
until one day he asks you to jerk
him off or give him a blow job.

639
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:14,869
And so you go along
with that, too,

640
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,704
because you feel trapped,

641
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:19,207
because he has groomed you.

642
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,793
How do you say
no to God, right?

643
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:23,586
See,

644
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:27,048
it is important to understand that
this is not just physical abuse,

645
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:29,050
it's spiritual abuse, too.

646
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,763
And when a priest does this to you,
he robs you of your faith.

647
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,933
So you reach for
the bottle or the needle.

648
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,560
Or if those don't work,
you jump off a bridge.

649
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,521
That's why we call
ourselves survivors.

650
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:42,814
Have you read
Jason Berry's book?

651
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:44,816
He wrote about the Gauthe
case in Louisiana?

652
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,068
Uh, that's "G"...
G-A-U-T-H-E.

653
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,112
Here. And talk to
Richard Sipe.

654
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,572
He worked in one of the
Church's treatment centers.

655
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:53,574
He's an ex-priest,

656
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,159
married a nun.

657
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,744
Here.

658
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,663
This is his testimony
from the Kos case.

659
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,248
Uh, Phil,
what's a treatment center?

660
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:02,250
It's where they send priests
when they get caught.

661
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,793
This is all right here
in the box,

662
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,628
I sent this all to you guys
five years ago.

663
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:09,090
Uh, to the <i>Globe?</i>
Who did you send it to?

664
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:14,151
I don't wanna say who, but they
said that they weren't interested.

665
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:16,347
Uh, but Phil, we did run a
couple of stories on you.

666
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,724
I saw them in the clips.

667
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,184
Yeah, but to be completely frank,
it wasn't enough.

668
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,939
You guys gotta understand,

669
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,107
this is big.

670
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,194
This is not just Boston. It's the
whole country. It's the whole world.

671
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:32,029
And it goes right
up to the Vatican.

672
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,282
Do you have any
proof of that, Phil?

673
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:37,285
No, not yet. But think about it,
there are so many of them.

674
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:39,292
How else could they have
hidden it for so long?

675
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,414
So many what?
Priests!

676
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,791
Priests!

677
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,461
I know of 13
right here in Boston.

678
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,214
You know 13 priests in Boston
who have molested children?

679
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:52,675
Yeah, why do you keep
repeating everything I say?

680
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,261
I just like to
clarify things.

681
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,971
Maybe you should have
clarified it five years ago

682
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,765
when I sent you
all of this stuff!

683
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:01,017
It's all right here!

684
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:11,778
May I use your bathroom?

685
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,362
Yeah, sure, Phil.

686
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,822
Come on.

687
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,247
Well, what do you think?

688
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,542
Well, the guy, he's got an agenda,
that's for sure.

689
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,169
You think?
He's obviously been through a lot.

690
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,421
But he's smart, and if he's
right about 13 priests...

691
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:32,381
Yeah, it might be
a big "if" with this guy.

692
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:33,841
Do a background check
on him,

693
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:36,093
and follow up with some of the
other survivors of his group.

694
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,846
I'll track down
this ex-priest, Sipe.

695
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,970
Okay, but stay on Garabedian.
That's more important.

696
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,267
Garabedian,
what a pain in the ass.

697
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,102
You can be a pain
in the ass, Mike.

698
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,313
Mmm.

699
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,827
Mitchell, what a surprise.
How are you?

700
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,870
I'm fine, Mr. Rezendes.
Good.

701
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,373
You know, I haven't heard back from you.
I left you a couple of messages.

702
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,458
I know. I've been very busy.
I don't have time for calls.

703
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:08,662
Oh, jeez,
I'm sure you don't.

704
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:11,712
Listen, listen, Mitch, let me
talk to a couple of the victims.

705
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:13,116
You could sit in
on the interview,

706
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:14,423
and if you're not happy,
you could kill it.

707
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:17,387
I spoke to my clients, and they don't
want to be in the press. I'm sorry.

708
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:20,096
I get that, but I don't need
to name names.

709
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,889
I don't believe you, Mr. Rezendes.
I'm sure you don't.

710
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:23,558
I don't.
Listen, Mitchell.

711
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,059
Look, Mr. Rezendes,
please...

712
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:26,602
I'm not writing
a profile here.

713
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:28,771
I'm working on something bigger.
Bigger?

714
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,231
I don't know
what that means.

715
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:31,482
I'm not supposed
to tell you this,

716
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:33,276
but I'm digging around
for Spotlight.

717
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,946
Spotlight's on this?
Yeah, we're looking into it,

718
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,614
but you gotta help me.

719
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:41,117
You gotta let me talk to some
of these victims, please.

720
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,913
Please.

721
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,002
Come back tomorrow.
9:30 a.m.

722
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:53,296
Thank you.

723
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:07,435
Ms. Pfeiffer?
Joe?

724
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,686
Hi.
Oh, shoot.

725
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:09,854
Oh, that's okay.
Sorry.

726
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:11,022
No, no problem.
Please sit.

727
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:12,231
Thank you.

728
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:13,858
Is this table okay?

729
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,484
This is perfect.

730
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,820
I had a muffin
while I was waiting.

731
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,822
Two, actually.

732
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:22,950
I eat when I'm nervous.
I do that, too, actually.

733
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:26,829
I hope I'm not late.
Phil told me 1:00.

734
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,124
No, you're fine.
I got here early.

735
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,542
About an hour.

736
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:37,298
Um, would you mind if I took some notes?
Would that be all right?

737
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,680
You don't mind
if I take some notes, do you?

738
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:47,183
- Are you going to use my name?
- No.

739
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,770
Not if you don't
want me to. No.

740
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,897
I just had a kid.

741
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,900
He's only one, but I'm not sure
I want him to know about this.

742
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,610
Sure. I get that.

743
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,987
You can stop this interview
at any time, Patrick.

744
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,031
All right?
Okay.

745
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,369
Go ahead with your notes.

746
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,245
Okay. So, um...

747
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:12,541
Where'd you live
when it first happened?

748
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,586
In the projects,
over in Hyde Park.

749
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,421
Over by the Stop & Shop?

750
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,174
Yeah, you know it?

751
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,843
Yeah, I drove a cab
for a few years.

752
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:24,553
Open early.
Bad coffee, right?

753
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:26,889
Yeah, I guess.

754
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,726
How old were you
when it happened?

755
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,603
I was 12.

756
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:35,898
Just after my dad
killed himself.

757
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:37,984
Ah, jeez.

758
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,986
He was a real
piece of shit.

759
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:42,738
And my mom,
she wasn't so stable either.

760
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,157
How do you mean?
I mean, she was nuts.

761
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:48,327
She was a schizophrenic.
Same shit.

762
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,540
When did you
first meet Geoghan?

763
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,085
Well, my sister,

764
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,170
she saw him over
in the Dunkin' Donuts.

765
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:01,549
Tells him about my old man passing,
and he rushed right over.

766
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,092
And there was this nun,
Sister Barbara,

767
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,678
and she ran this group for
kids from troubled families.

768
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:06,929
Mmm-hmm.

769
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:08,514
Where was that?

770
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:11,100
St. Ambrose in Dorchester.
Okay.

771
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:14,562
She's the one who introduced
me to Father Shanley.

772
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:17,773
He was a street priest.

773
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,276
Long hair. Very hip.

774
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,738
He invited me to his
apartment in Back Bay.

775
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,115
Where in Back Bay?
Beacon Street.

776
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:27,992
Beacon. Okay.

777
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,118
Are you from here?

778
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,872
Uh, no. I grew up in Ohio,
but my mom's from Southie.

779
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:36,250
Okay, so you get it.
I'd never even seen Back Bay.

780
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:40,629
So what happened
on that first visit, Joe?

781
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,716
Well, he was very nice
at first,

782
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,468
very funny, very casual.

783
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,804
And I think he could tell
I was gay,

784
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:53,434
so he showed me this mobile he had,
like, over a baby's crib?

785
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:54,560
Mmm-hmm.

786
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,062
But with different words.

787
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:59,648
"Homosexual,
transsexual, bisexual."

788
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:02,568
Okay, and did you know you
were gay at that time, Joe?

789
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,570
Yeah.

790
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,614
But that wasn't information
I was sharing with anybody.

791
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:08,074
Not in Dorchester.

792
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,701
Okay.

793
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:13,746
So, what happened after
he showed you the mobile?

794
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,581
Well, I was
a little freaked out.

795
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:16,791
Mmm-hmm.

796
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:18,334
I think he could tell,

797
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:22,838
so he said, "You know what'll
help is if we play strip poker."

798
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:26,509
Course I lost.

799
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:29,845
And, uh, things went on
from there.

800
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,182
Can you tell me
specifically what happened?

801
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,602
Specifically, he...

802
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:38,854
He molested me.

803
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:45,986
Joe, I think that the language is
going to be so important here.

804
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:49,657
We can't sanitize this.
Just saying "molest" isn't enough.

805
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:52,618
People need to know
what actually happened.

806
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,249
We should probably get these to go.
Right.

807
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,877
Geoghan shows up,
and my mom, you know, she's...

808
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:04,463
She's thrilled.
I mean...

809
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,882
This was like God
showing up, you know?

810
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,467
Sure. Right.

811
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:09,760
So what happened then?

812
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,306
You really want to
hear this shit?

813
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,559
Yeah. Yeah, Patrick, I do.

814
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:27,027
He offers to take me
to get ice cream.

815
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:30,406
And, you know, he's a priest.
I'm a kid, so I go.

816
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:34,577
Sure.
So we're driving home and he...

817
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,373
He starts patting my leg,

818
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,919
you know, then

819
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,425
his hand just slides right up,
and he grabs my dick.

820
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:54,722
You know, I just froze up.
I was fucking petrified, I couldn't move.

821
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,933
I didn't know what to do.
I was just a little kid.

822
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:01,437
Yeah.

823
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,444
You know, I never even
touched my ice cream.

824
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,696
It just melted down my arm.

825
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,954
Did you, um...

826
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,874
Did you see him again
after that?

827
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:29,089
Yeah.

828
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:35,137
All right. That's good.
Let's stop there for now.

829
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:37,473
Sure.

830
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:40,768
He said it was a way to make me
more comfortable with my body.

831
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:41,852
Mmm.

832
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,562
So what happened
after that?

833
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,398
Well, he took off his
clothes, and he said,

834
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:47,942
"I've been so depressed,"

835
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:50,277
"but maybe you can cheer me
up and give me a blow job."

836
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,154
Classy guy.

837
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,033
And did you?
Yeah.

838
00:42:57,368 --> 00:43:00,621
I know what you must be thinking,
like, why would I ever do that

839
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:03,540
to some creepy guy who's 30
years older than me, but...

840
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:06,794
What you have to understand is that
this is the first time in my life

841
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:09,421
that someone told me that it
was okay to be gay. Mmm-hmm.

842
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:11,507
And it was a priest.
Right.

843
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:16,011
So you had oral sex.
Did you have intercourse?

844
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:18,514
Yes.

845
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,182
Not then, but later.

846
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:24,019
It really
messed me up.

847
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:28,148
I'm sober now, but that...
That was the beginning of it all.

848
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:32,820
It's very confusing,
you know,

849
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:36,240
to be introduced to sex
like that and then...

850
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,076
And then to be
attracted to men, it's...

851
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,873
I'm sorry.
I knew I was gonna do this.

852
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:46,834
Oh, I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

853
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:48,836
It's okay, Joe.
It's okay.

854
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:50,963
Of course there is a
church right there.

855
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,173
And a playground.

856
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:55,926
Joe, did you ever
try and tell anyone?

857
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,304
Like who? A priest?

858
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:01,682
Can I use your phone?

859
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:03,267
Yeah, sure.
You know where it is.

860
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,353
You can use my name
if you want.

861
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:08,814
Thanks, Patrick.

862
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,775
Don't thank me,
just get these assholes, will you?

863
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,242
He's one of the lucky ones.

864
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:23,454
He's still alive.

865
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:32,921
Do you want
a cup of tea, Sacha?

866
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:34,840
I'm okay, Nana. Thanks.
Okay.

867
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,845
<i>Hello.</i>
Hi, Joe, it's Sacha Pfeiffer.

868
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:43,265
<i>Hi, Sacha. How are you?</i>
I'm good, thanks.

869
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:46,185
Listen, Joe, I just wanted
to follow up on one thing.

870
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:48,771
You talked to Phil Saviano
about all of this, right?

871
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:51,565
<i>Yeah, I did.
I went to a couple of SNAP meetings.</i>

872
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:54,485
And did Phil ever suggest
you do anything about it?

873
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:55,819
<i>No.</i>

874
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:57,446
<i>The meetings
weren't really about that.</i>

875
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:59,031
<i>I mean, a couple of them
had gone to a lawyer,</i>

876
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:01,158
<i>but I didn't think
it was worth it.</i>

877
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:02,451
Why not?

878
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:04,258
<i>There were just so
many forms to fill out.</i>

879
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:05,704
<i>It was overwhelming,
you know.</i>

880
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:08,123
<i>And he said it could only get
me a small settlement, so...</i>

881
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,709
Who, who said that?
<i>The lawyer told me that.</i>

882
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:14,171
So you did go
and see a lawyer?

883
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,049
<i>Yeah, but I didn't
end up using him,</i>

884
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,009
<i>so I didn't think
it was important.</i>

885
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:21,261
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to hide anything.</i>

886
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:23,013
No, I know, Joe.

887
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:25,224
Do remember his name?
The lawyer?

888
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:28,310
<i>No, but maybe Phil
would know.</i>

889
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:31,021
<i>The guy was on TV a lot
during the Porter case.</i>

890
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:32,564
<i>He was handsome.</i>

891
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,358
Was it Eric Macleish?

892
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,318
<i>Yeah, that's it. Macleish.</i>

893
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:38,821
<i>I thought
he was very handsome.</i>

894
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:43,450
Hey.
Hey.

895
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:46,537
I was just in the newsroom.
Judge Sweeney set a date for the hearing.

896
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:48,539
Really? When?

897
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:49,915
Two weeks, in Springfield.

898
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:52,626
Canellos started a pool.
Ten bucks to get in.

899
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:54,968
Anyone picking the <i>Globe?</i>

900
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,589
He's only taking bets on how
fast Sweeney rules against us.

901
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,051
- Robby.
<i>- Hi, it's me.</i>

902
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:02,553
<i>Did you get my message?</i>
I did.

903
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,888
Looks like Father Shanley
could be our fourth priest.

904
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,390
<i>Yeah, I think he is.</i>

905
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:08,183
Did you follow up
with Macleish?

906
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,435
<i>I just talked to Phil.</i>

907
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:11,645
<i>He said Macleish dealt with
a number of these cases.</i>

908
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,273
<i>Guess he forgot to mention that.</i>
Yeah.

909
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:15,774
I'm gonna go to
the courthouse tomorrow,

910
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:18,777
see if I can find any cases he
settled against the Church.

911
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:21,113
<i>All right. Call me
after you do. Good night.</i>

912
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,948
Okay, good night.

913
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:26,869
Hey.

914
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:28,287
You wanted to chat?

915
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:30,456
Yeah, I'm late for a dinner.
You wanna walk me out?

916
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:31,915
Sure.

917
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,209
Jeez.

918
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:36,628
Does this guy ever go home?
Apparently not.

919
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:38,422
I got guys who won't leave
till he does.

920
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:40,507
He's wearing out the goddamn newsroom.

921
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:42,092
Where are we on Geoghan?

922
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:44,178
Following up
on more victims.

923
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,513
Hey, I want to expand
the investigation.

924
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,640
Why?
We got a fourth priest.

925
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:50,642
There might be
as many as 13.

926
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,311
Thirteen?
Yeah.

927
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:54,897
Who's your source?
Phil Saviano.

928
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:58,066
Oh, Jesus Christ, Robby, I told Mike...
I know, I know...

929
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:00,486
I think Saviano
might be legit, Ben.

930
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:03,363
You wanna elaborate
on that?

931
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,365
No. Not really.

932
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:09,077
It just feels like this thing's
stacking up. It's my gut.

933
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:14,458
Okay.
Okay. Good.

934
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:15,626
Thank you.

935
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,553
Hello?

936
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:29,556
<i>Mr. Rezendes?</i>
Uh, yeah. Who's this?

937
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:31,308
<i>It's Richard Sipe.</i>

938
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:34,603
Oh, yeah. Hey, Richard, how are you?
<i>I'm good.</i>

939
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,605
Uh, thanks
for calling. Look...

940
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:38,732
Phil Saviano
gave me your name.

941
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:40,984
I was wondering if I can
ask you a few questions.

942
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:43,070
<i>Of course. Yeah.</i>
Great.

943
00:47:43,237 --> 00:47:45,280
So, Phil told me
that you were working

944
00:47:45,364 --> 00:47:48,450
at one of the Church's treatment
centers in Baltimore?

945
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:51,411
<i>Yes. The Seton
Psychiatric Institute.</i>

946
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,330
<i>It was run by
the Daughters of Charity.</i>

947
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:56,500
And, uh,
when was that, Richard?

948
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:01,380
<i>Well, I started my psychotherapy
fellowship there in 1965,</i>

949
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,247
<i>and I was there
for five years,</i>

950
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:07,469
<i>but I spent the next 30 studying
abusive priests and their victims.</i>

951
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:08,887
Really?
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

952
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:11,056
And that's been
your sole focus?

953
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:12,933
<i>Look, Mike,</i>

954
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:16,353
<i>the Church wants us to believe
that it's just a few bad apples.</i>

955
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:18,036
<i>But it's a much
bigger problem than that.</i>

956
00:48:18,105 --> 00:48:19,731
How much bigger, Richard?

957
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,775
<i>Well, based on the research,</i>

958
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:25,445
<i>I would classify it as a
recognizable psychiatric phenomenon.</i>

959
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:27,990
That's big.

960
00:48:33,537 --> 00:48:34,913
Hey, Mac.
Hey.

961
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:37,082
If I wanted historical
data on a priest,

962
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,542
parishes he'd been
assigned to,

963
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:39,793
where would I find that?

964
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,596
The Geoghan case? It's all in the clips.
Lisa has the source material.

965
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:44,089
Yeah, what if it was
for another priest?

966
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,591
One that hadn't been
in the papers.

967
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:47,926
You're looking at another priest?
Who're you looking at?

968
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:50,137
Any ideas?

969
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,060
Oh, come on, Matt,
you're not going to tell me?

970
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:54,683
I gotta get to a meeting.
Thanks, Mac.

971
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,101
Hey, Steve.

972
00:48:57,436 --> 00:48:59,479
The archdiocese puts
out an annual directory.

973
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,815
Every priest and parish.
That's great.

974
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:04,484
Do these go back
any further than '98?

975
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:06,445
Oh, yeah. Going back to
the '80s in the mez.

976
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:08,405
Beyond that you gotta
go to the BPL.

977
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:10,574
In the mez, huh? Thanks, Lisa.
You bet.

978
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:14,828
He said they all target
the same kind of kid.

979
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:18,415
Low-income families,
absentee fathers, broken homes.

980
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:21,585
So a guy like Geoghan goes after
boys not because he prefers them,

981
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:23,378
but because they have
more shame.

982
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:24,546
Less likely to talk.

983
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:28,008
These guys
are predators, Robby.

984
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,385
And I talked to Sipe.
He said he'd seen dozens of them

985
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:31,845
in the '60s in Seton.

986
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:33,680
He called it
a "phenomenon."

987
00:49:33,764 --> 00:49:35,557
Why didn't he go public?
He did,

988
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:37,643
but the Church made a huge
effort to discredit him.

989
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:41,521
Smear campaigns,
public statements by prominent bishops.

990
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:44,316
It's just like Saviano said,
and Garabedian.

991
00:49:44,483 --> 00:49:46,026
You getting anywhere
with him?

992
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:48,570
More victims.
More victims.

993
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:50,497
You can't empty his pockets?
I'll get to him.

994
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,616
I just need more time.
Oh, come on, Mike.

995
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,660
You gotta get him.
I'll get him, I'll get him.

996
00:49:58,288 --> 00:49:59,790
Jesus. What the hell
is that smell?

997
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:01,708
There's a dead rat
in the corner.

998
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:04,294
What have you got?
Church directories.

999
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:06,505
It's every priest
in Massachusetts.

1000
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:08,173
What parish
they're assigned to.

1001
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:09,257
Are these official?
Yeah.

1002
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:10,425
I figured it could
help us track down

1003
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:12,219
some of the priests
that Saviano mentioned.

1004
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:13,512
Maybe find
some more victims.

1005
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:15,764
Can we turn on some more lights?
I couldn't find the switch.

1006
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:17,929
You wanna borrow my glasses?
No, I'm good. I'm good.

1007
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:22,646
Look, 1983. John Geoghan,
St. Brendan Parish, Dorchester.

1008
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:25,148
So we can find out where any
priest is in any given year?

1009
00:50:25,232 --> 00:50:27,484
Yeah, I got him here at...

1010
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:28,944
Huh.

1011
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:30,654
What?

1012
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:33,907
1980, the year Geoghan was pulled from JP.
It says he's on sick leave.

1013
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,742
Come on.
It really says that?

1014
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,204
Where is, uh, 1991?

1015
00:50:40,831 --> 00:50:42,499
Here ya go.
Let me see this.

1016
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:43,834
Barrett. Barrett. Liam.

1017
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:46,420
I can't read that.
Look for a Liam Barrett in there.

1018
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:49,339
1991's the year they pulled
him out of Charlestown.

1019
00:50:51,842 --> 00:50:53,427
Barrett, Liam.

1020
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:56,346
Yeah.
"Sick leave."

1021
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,682
It's an official designation.

1022
00:51:00,392 --> 00:51:02,477
Let's get these upstairs.

1023
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:04,813
And, Matt, check on those
priests Saviano gave us.

1024
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,149
- Robby. Yeah.
<i>- Hey, I'm down at the courthouse.</i>

1025
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:10,777
Something's not right here.
Nothing on Shanley either, Sacha.

1026
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:12,487
Okay, thanks.

1027
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:14,334
Yeah, we need to go talk
to Macleish again.

1028
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:17,075
<i>Really, why?</i>
Huh? There's nothing here.

1029
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:19,457
There aren't any records,
I checked every name.

1030
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:26,623
Thanks for waiting. So sorry, guys.
Stuck on a call.

1031
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,545
Not a problem.
How are you? Good.

1032
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,508
Thanks for meeting us.
You bet. What's up, guys?

1033
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:34,551
Mr. Macleish, are you familiar
with a priest named Paul Shanley?

1034
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,845
Yes, I am familiar
with him.

1035
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:40,640
And have you settled cases
against Father Shanley?

1036
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:46,313
As I'm sure you can understand,
I can't discuss that with you.

1037
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:50,442
How about, uh,
Father Ronald Paquin?

1038
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:53,695
Well, I can't discuss that with you either.
Come on, guys.

1039
00:51:55,572 --> 00:51:58,116
We understand you've settled several
cases against each of them.

1040
00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:01,286
Even if I'd been involved
in those cases,

1041
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:02,954
the settlements
would be confidential,

1042
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:06,082
and I could be disbarred for
acknowledging their existence.

1043
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,710
Okay?
Mmm-hmm.

1044
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:11,046
Look, I told you guys,
these are tough cases.

1045
00:52:12,631 --> 00:52:15,717
Most of these folks, they
just want some acknowledgment

1046
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:17,552
of what happened.

1047
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:20,013
We got 'em a sit-down with the
bishop and a little dough,

1048
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,973
and that's the best
they could hope for.

1049
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:26,353
Well, it's certainly the best
the priests could hope for.

1050
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:30,398
No, the Church promised they'd take
the priests out of circulation.

1051
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:32,901
And did you follow up
on that?

1052
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,908
Do you guys
need anything else?

1053
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:42,494
Yes. Why aren't there
any records?

1054
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:43,995
I was down at
the courthouse earlier.

1055
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,248
There aren't any records
of any of these settlements.

1056
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:51,253
We dealt directly
with the Church.

1057
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:56,258
We would draw up a demand letter
and send it to the chancery.

1058
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:59,344
You never filed
anything in court?

1059
00:52:59,636 --> 00:53:01,221
It's a private mediation.

1060
00:53:01,388 --> 00:53:06,101
So, this is just you
and the archdiocese's lawyers

1061
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:07,894
in a room?

1062
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:09,604
Correct.

1063
00:53:10,272 --> 00:53:11,273
Anyone else?

1064
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:14,776
Occasionally, the Church would bring in
another defense attorney to help out.

1065
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:16,820
You have names?

1066
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:18,238
Nope.

1067
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,282
No, I don't.

1068
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:22,868
So this was all
under the table?

1069
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:24,452
There's no paper trail.
At all.

1070
00:53:24,953 --> 00:53:26,955
The victim has to sign
a confidentiality agreement

1071
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,164
to get the settlement.

1072
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:30,876
The lawyer takes a third and the
Church sweeps it under the rug.

1073
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:32,544
Jeez,
it's a freakin' racket.

1074
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:34,129
It's more complicated
than that.

1075
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:37,090
Macleish's got a duty to the client
to get the best deal he can.

1076
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:40,176
Sure, but how many victims do
you represent and profit from

1077
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:41,386
before you say something?

1078
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:43,513
Garabedian would say none.

1079
00:53:43,597 --> 00:53:45,473
That's why he's taking
these cases to court

1080
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:47,267
because he wants people
to know about this.

1081
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,061
I agree.
And legal ethics aside, Ben,

1082
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:52,188
I mean, operating
the way Macleish has

1083
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:54,566
all but guarantees that the
abuse stays under wraps.

1084
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:58,695
Yeah. Did Macleish confirm
all Saviano's priests?

1085
00:53:58,987 --> 00:54:03,325
No. He's limited by his
confidentiality agreement.

1086
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:06,578
But clearly he's settled cases
against a number of them.

1087
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,330
Phil's put me in touch with
some of the other victims,

1088
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:11,166
I'm pretty confident all of his
priests are gonna check out.

1089
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,877
So it is 13 priests?

1090
00:54:14,044 --> 00:54:15,712
Yeah.
Looks that way.

1091
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:18,924
Holy shit.

1092
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:23,136
Okay. Keep going.

1093
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:28,850
I'm sorry.
What was the name again?

1094
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:32,729
Uh, Baron.

1095
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:34,814
B-A-R-O-N.

1096
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:38,902
I'm having trouble finding it.
Just give me a second.

1097
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:41,321
It's okay, Kim,
I can vouch for him.

1098
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:44,157
I'm Pete Conley, I'm on the
board of Catholic Charities.

1099
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,909
Welcome to Boston,
Mr. Baron.

1100
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,703
Thank you.
I appreciate you joining us.

1101
00:54:49,371 --> 00:54:51,623
We're very proud of the
work we do here at Boston.

1102
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,292
Oh, the Cardinal said
you had a nice visit.

1103
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:56,544
Yes, we did.

1104
00:54:56,628 --> 00:54:59,798
He's an extraordinary man.
I'm glad you had a chance to chat.

1105
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:14,896
Enjoying yourself?

1106
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:20,694
Uh, to be honest, these events
aren't really my strong suit.

1107
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,780
Yeah. Are you involved
with the charity?

1108
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:26,032
Not directly, no.
Several of my friends are.

1109
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:28,743
We all went to high school.
BC High.

1110
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,496
That's the school across
the street from the <i>Globe.</i>

1111
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:33,373
It's hard to miss.
Yeah.

1112
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,251
Hard to get away from,
too, apparently.

1113
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:43,216
The Cardinal's in the corner
if you're so inclined.

1114
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:45,343
We've met.
Really?

1115
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:47,887
Did he mention the suit?

1116
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:50,682
No, but he did give me a
copy of the catechism.

1117
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:54,728
Yeah, well, the Cardinal's
not known for his subtlety.

1118
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:56,312
During the Porter investigation,

1119
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:59,315
he'd literally called down the
power of God on the <i>Globe.</i>

1120
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:01,568
How'd that play out?

1121
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:05,572
A week later our editor
broke his leg skiing.

1122
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,324
Shrimp toast,
gentlemen?

1123
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:10,952
No, thanks.
No.

1124
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:16,166
You said one of the victims
filed a criminal complaint?

1125
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:17,751
Yeah, there were
a few of them.

1126
00:56:19,294 --> 00:56:21,087
But the judge had
the case records sealed

1127
00:56:21,171 --> 00:56:23,048
after friends of
the Church complained.

1128
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,091
And the Church has
a lot of friends.

1129
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:26,509
Like Eric Macleish?

1130
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:29,387
Yeah.

1131
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:32,557
Let's just say he's not
part of the solution.

1132
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,601
You follow what I'm saying?
Sure.

1133
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,728
You work hard,
Mr. Rezendes.

1134
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:39,731
Are you married?
Yeah.

1135
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:41,399
Your wife doesn't mind you
working all the time?

1136
00:56:41,483 --> 00:56:42,984
Oh, yeah, she does.

1137
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:48,198
That's why I never got married.
I'm too busy.

1138
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:50,492
What I do
is too important.

1139
00:56:51,284 --> 00:56:52,494
Hmm.

1140
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:56,316
Your new editor,
he's a Jew right?

1141
00:56:57,832 --> 00:56:59,834
Oh, that's right, yeah.
Yeah, see,

1142
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:03,838
he comes in and suddenly everybody's
interested in the Church.

1143
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,006
You know why?

1144
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:08,843
Because it takes
an outsider, like me.

1145
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:11,137
I'm Armenian.

1146
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:13,139
How many Armenians
do you know in Boston?

1147
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:16,309
Steve Kurkjian,
works at the <i>Globe.</i>

1148
00:57:17,227 --> 00:57:20,146
Oh, that's two.
You should get a prize or something.

1149
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:23,233
What are you, Italian?
No, I'm Portuguese.

1150
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,820
From where?
East Boston.

1151
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:30,657
Really? East Boston?

1152
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,035
You don't sound like it.

1153
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,044
This city, these people,

1154
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,132
making the rest of us
feel like we don't belong.

1155
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:49,175
But they're no better
than us.

1156
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:52,011
Look at how they treat
their children.

1157
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:56,224
Mark my words,
Mr. Rezendes,

1158
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,476
if it takes a village
to raise a child,

1159
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,061
it takes a village
to abuse one.

1160
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:07,735
Hey, here he is. Want a beer?
Love one.

1161
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:10,989
Another.
You here with Barbara?

1162
00:58:11,156 --> 00:58:14,242
No, she hates these things.
Karen, too.

1163
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:15,743
Yeah.
Smart ladies.

1164
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,829
<i>Sláinte.</i>

1165
00:58:18,872 --> 00:58:19,873
Mmm.

1166
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:21,541
I met your new editor.

1167
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,794
Seemed like a decent fellow.
I think he is.

1168
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:31,176
Hey, I had an interesting conversation
with Eric Macleish the other day.

1169
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:36,723
Turns out he's been settling abuse
cases with the archdiocese for years.

1170
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,059
You really wanna
talk about this here?

1171
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:45,565
Jim, you said you helped out
on Father Barrett as a favor.

1172
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:48,026
That was a one-off?

1173
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:53,698
How many of these cases
have you been involved with?

1174
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:57,702
You know I can't answer that, Robby.
It's unethical.

1175
00:58:59,162 --> 00:59:00,622
Is that all it is?

1176
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:07,212
So, this would be
the Robby Robinson

1177
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:09,130
I've always heard about
but never met.

1178
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:12,759
Listen to me, Jimmy.

1179
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:15,553
You wanna be on
the right side of this.

1180
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:20,600
This is the Church
you're talking about, Robby.

1181
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:22,352
Look around.
These are good people,

1182
00:59:22,435 --> 00:59:24,270
done a lot of good
for this city.

1183
00:59:26,022 --> 00:59:27,774
Enjoy the party.

1184
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:38,826
I've been through
a lot of these now.

1185
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,370
"Sick leave" isn't the
only designation they use

1186
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:42,330
when they take one of these
priests out of circulation.

1187
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:44,916
They use a slew of terms.
"Absent on leave,"

1188
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:47,460
"unassigned,"
"emergency response."

1189
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:50,023
They got a word for everything, these guys.
Hmm. Except "rape."

1190
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:53,049
And they move parishes way more
frequently than other priests.

1191
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:54,467
When I was a kid,
a priest moved

1192
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,219
after seven or eight years,
sometimes longer.

1193
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:58,596
These guys, it's two
to three years tops.

1194
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,015
And did they use these designations
for all of Saviano's priests?

1195
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:03,226
Yeah, it's a pretty
clear pattern.

1196
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:04,852
Guys, I got Sipe.

1197
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:08,314
<i>I think if you really
want to understand the crisis,</i>

1198
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:10,817
<i>you need to start with
the celibacy requirement.</i>

1199
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:12,777
<i>That was my first
major finding.</i>

1200
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:15,780
<i>Only 50% of the clergy
are celibate.</i>

1201
01:00:16,948 --> 01:00:19,867
<i>Now, most of them are having
sex with other adults.</i>

1202
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:23,121
<i>But the fact remains that this
creates a culture of secrecy</i>

1203
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:26,207
<i>that tolerates and
even protects pedophiles.</i>

1204
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:31,296
So you believe the Church is aware
of the extent of this crisis?

1205
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:34,757
<i>Oh, absolutely. After the first
major scandal in Louisiana,</i>

1206
01:00:34,924 --> 01:00:38,052
<i>Tom Doyle, the secretary-canonist
for the papal nuncio,</i>

1207
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:40,972
<i>co-authored a report
warning pedophile priests</i>

1208
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:43,224
<i>were a
billion-dollar liability.</i>

1209
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:45,018
<i>That was in 1985.</i>

1210
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:47,353
1985?
<i>That's right.</i>

1211
01:00:48,438 --> 01:00:50,940
Who saw that report?
Anyone from the Catholic hierarchy?

1212
01:00:51,316 --> 01:00:52,525
<i>Sure.</i>

1213
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:54,235
<i>Doyle tried to introduce
the report at</i>

1214
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,571
<i>the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops.</i>

1215
01:00:57,071 --> 01:01:00,575
<i>In fact, Cardinal Law initially
helped to fund the report.</i>

1216
01:01:00,742 --> 01:01:02,785
<i>But then he backed out,
and they shelved it.</i>

1217
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,953
Are you kidding me?

1218
01:01:04,037 --> 01:01:06,289
Richard, Robby here.

1219
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:11,085
We think we have 13 priests in
Boston that fit this pattern,

1220
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:14,922
which would be
a very, very big story.

1221
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:18,092
Does that sound right to you
in terms of scale?

1222
01:01:19,052 --> 01:01:21,763
<i>No, not really, Robby.
It sounds low to me.</i>

1223
01:01:22,805 --> 01:01:26,309
<i>My estimates suggest 6% act
out sexually with minors.</i>

1224
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:29,187
Uh, 6% of what?

1225
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:32,106
<i>6% of all priests.</i>

1226
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,775
How many priests
do we have in Boston?

1227
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:35,818
About 1,500.
1% is 15.

1228
01:01:35,985 --> 01:01:38,363
6% is

1229
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:39,655
90.

1230
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:44,202
All right, 90 priests.
Is that possible?

1231
01:01:44,786 --> 01:01:46,954
<i>From a metric standpoint,</i>

1232
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:50,958
<i>yes, that would certainly be
in line with my findings.</i>

1233
01:01:57,215 --> 01:01:58,216
<i>Hello?</i>

1234
01:01:58,299 --> 01:01:59,384
Uh...

1235
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:02,970
Ninety fucking priests?
In Boston?

1236
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:04,806
That's what he said.

1237
01:02:06,057 --> 01:02:08,309
If there were 90 of these bastards,
people would know.

1238
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,936
Maybe they do.

1239
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:11,479
And no one said a thing?

1240
01:02:12,188 --> 01:02:13,189
Good Germans?

1241
01:02:14,357 --> 01:02:16,797
I don't think that's a comparison
you want to make publically.

1242
01:02:17,026 --> 01:02:19,529
Macleish knew.
He just didn't say anything.

1243
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:21,489
That's 13 priests.

1244
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:23,533
There's a big difference
between 13 and 90.

1245
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:25,339
Where's this guy Sipe
getting his numbers?

1246
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:27,370
Well, he's been studying
it for 30 years.

1247
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:28,996
He is a trained
psychotherapist.

1248
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:31,999
Okay, but we need something
more than a metric

1249
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:34,377
from some hippy ex-priest
who's shacking up with a nun.

1250
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:37,880
Okay, so we'll track down more victims.
We'll get more priests.

1251
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:40,508
Then we can check them
against the directories.

1252
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:41,968
That's a shitload
of victims.

1253
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:43,594
We'll get there.

1254
01:02:43,678 --> 01:02:44,762
How long's it gonna take?

1255
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:47,348
Too long.

1256
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,226
Wait, but...
Meeting's over?

1257
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:51,561
Yeah, for now.

1258
01:02:54,063 --> 01:02:56,399
Look, what've you got?
What if we work backwards?

1259
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:59,151
What do you mean? From what?
From the directories.

1260
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:01,028
We've been using them
to confirm bad priests.

1261
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:02,447
What if we do it
the other way around?

1262
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:04,850
Use the directories to identify
bad priests. Yeah, exactly.

1263
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:06,409
We search by designation.

1264
01:03:06,576 --> 01:03:09,370
We look for any priest on
"sick leave" or "unassigned."

1265
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:11,622
Or have been moved around a lot.
Yeah.

1266
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:13,207
It's gonna take
a load of work.

1267
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:15,293
Well, not if we're
all on it.

1268
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:16,544
You, too?

1269
01:03:16,586 --> 01:03:19,422
Generally that's what "all" means. Yeah.
Yeah, generally.

1270
01:04:13,476 --> 01:04:15,478
Library is closing.

1271
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:20,233
Library is closing.

1272
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:30,785
Holy shit.

1273
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:20,376
No freakin' way.

1274
01:05:29,218 --> 01:05:30,261
- Talbot.
- Yeah.

1275
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:31,345
- Tivnan.
- Yeah.

1276
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:32,930
Toma.
Yeah.

1277
01:05:33,014 --> 01:05:34,348
Turnbull.
Yeah.

1278
01:05:34,432 --> 01:05:35,600
Walsh.
Yeah.

1279
01:05:35,683 --> 01:05:36,892
Welsh.
Yeah.

1280
01:05:36,976 --> 01:05:38,436
That's it.
That's it.

1281
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:39,937
Holy shit.
Robby?

1282
01:05:40,021 --> 01:05:42,398
That's three off Sipe's estimate.
That's incredible.

1283
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:43,691
Robby?

1284
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:44,942
How many?
Eighty-seven.

1285
01:05:45,026 --> 01:05:47,028
Eighty-seven priests
in Boston.

1286
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:52,533
Call Macleish. I wanna talk to him.
Okay.

1287
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:56,162
Can you print it?
Sure can.

1288
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,249
<i>Jim Sullivan's office.</i>

1289
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,543
Yeah, Walter Robinson
for Jim Sullivan.

1290
01:06:02,627 --> 01:06:04,295
Tell him it's important,
please.

1291
01:06:04,462 --> 01:06:06,047
<i>One moment, please.</i>

1292
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:12,303
<i>Hey, Robby.
Everything okay?</i>

1293
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,388
I need you
to tell me something, Jim.

1294
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:16,390
Could it be 90 priests?

1295
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:19,143
<i>What?</i>
Could it be as high as 90?

1296
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,228
<i>Jesus, Robby.</i>

1297
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:24,857
I need to know, Jim. I wouldn't
be asking if it wasn't important.

1298
01:06:26,901 --> 01:06:28,653
<i>You gotta stop this, Robby.</i>

1299
01:06:36,744 --> 01:06:39,914
Robby, Macleish's assistant said
he's all booked up, he can't see us.

1300
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:42,833
Yeah. Well, the hell
he can't.

1301
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:50,424
All right.
That'll be fun.

1302
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:55,805
You know what,
I'll catch up with you, okay?

1303
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:57,264
We're good.

1304
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:59,600
Hey, guys,
I'm really sorry, I am,

1305
01:06:59,684 --> 01:07:00,851
but I don't have any time
to talk right now,

1306
01:07:00,935 --> 01:07:02,144
but if you call
my assistant...

1307
01:07:02,228 --> 01:07:03,396
Mr. Macleish,
we have reason to believe

1308
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:06,119
that there are allegations against
as many as 87 priests in Boston.

1309
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:08,567
I can't talk to you
about that.

1310
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:10,569
Does that number sound right to you?
You gotta be kidding me.

1311
01:07:10,653 --> 01:07:12,530
I just told you I don't have
time for this crap right now.

1312
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:14,782
Eric. How many priests
did you settle?

1313
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:17,451
Robby, you know
I can't tell you that.

1314
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:20,830
You're gonna give me the names
and the names of their victims.

1315
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:24,125
Are you threatening me?

1316
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,502
We've got two stories here.

1317
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:28,504
We've got a story
about degenerate clergy,

1318
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:30,548
and we've got a story
about a bunch of lawyers

1319
01:07:30,631 --> 01:07:33,092
turning child abuse
into a cottage industry.

1320
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:36,053
Now, which story
do you want us to write?

1321
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:37,805
'Cause we're writing
one of them.

1322
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:43,978
I already sent you
a list of names.

1323
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:46,939
What're you talking about?
To whom?

1324
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:49,859
The <i>Globe</i>. Years ago.

1325
01:07:49,942 --> 01:07:51,902
After the Porter case.
I got plenty of calls.

1326
01:07:51,986 --> 01:07:54,321
I had 20 priests
in Boston alone,

1327
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:56,245
but I couldn't go after them
without the press.

1328
01:07:56,490 --> 01:08:00,953
So I sent you guys a list of names,
and you buried it.

1329
01:08:03,164 --> 01:08:04,540
I want those names tomorrow.

1330
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,834
Check your
goddamn clips, Robby.

1331
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:10,671
We didn't find
anything in the clips.

1332
01:08:10,838 --> 01:08:12,673
Yeah. Big surprise.

1333
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:17,344
Richard, do you still
go to mass?

1334
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:20,556
<i>No. No, I haven't been
to church for some time now.</i>

1335
01:08:20,848 --> 01:08:23,142
<i>But I still
consider myself a Catholic.</i>

1336
01:08:23,476 --> 01:08:24,852
How does that work?

1337
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:27,730
<i>Well, the church
is an institution, Mike.</i>

1338
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:29,648
<i>Made of men.</i>

1339
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:32,860
<i>It's passing.
My faith is in the eternal.</i>

1340
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:35,529
<i>I try to separate the two.</i>

1341
01:08:36,322 --> 01:08:38,699
Sounds tricky.
<i>It is.</i>

1342
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:41,577
<i>Especially since the Church
continues to go after me.</i>

1343
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:43,662
<i>It takes a toll, Mike.</i>

1344
01:08:44,205 --> 01:08:45,965
<i>They'll try to silence
anyone who speaks out.</i>

1345
01:08:45,998 --> 01:08:48,375
<i>I'm sure they'll come after you
and your team soon enough.</i>

1346
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:50,878
Really? And how do you think
they'll do that?

1347
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:56,342
Hello?

1348
01:08:56,509 --> 01:08:57,510
Richard?

1349
01:09:04,058 --> 01:09:05,226
Who is it?

1350
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:07,311
It's the archbishop
of Canterbury.

1351
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:12,945
I had dinner at Santarpio's,
had some leftovers.

1352
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:16,529
Ah, you're the freakin' best.
Thanks. You want a beer?

1353
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:19,615
Yeah.
You got it.

1354
01:09:19,782 --> 01:09:21,242
Jesus.

1355
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,202
How much longer you gonna be
in this shithole?

1356
01:09:23,285 --> 01:09:24,912
Yeah. I'm working on it.

1357
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:27,081
She's a good girl, Mike.

1358
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:30,334
Yeah, she is.
We'll figure it out.

1359
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:32,962
I haven't had
a lot of time lately.

1360
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:34,805
I just got off the phone
with Sipe, actually.

1361
01:09:35,548 --> 01:09:37,174
Have you met this guy
in person yet?

1362
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:41,053
No, but his knowledge of this
is on a whole other level.

1363
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:42,304
I'm freaking starving.

1364
01:09:44,807 --> 01:09:46,600
So, where are we
with the 90?

1365
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,478
We're close.
How close?

1366
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:52,106
We're close.
Just answer the question, will you?

1367
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:57,570
We got 87 names.

1368
01:09:57,653 --> 01:09:59,613
We're trying to get confirmation.
I think we will.

1369
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:03,826
Something bugging you?

1370
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:05,995
It's just surprising,
that's all.

1371
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:10,499
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
For everybody.

1372
01:10:15,963 --> 01:10:18,507
Oh, hey, Ben.
I forgot to ask you.

1373
01:10:19,008 --> 01:10:22,219
Phil Saviano said he sent a bunch of
info over to the <i>Globe</i> years ago.

1374
01:10:22,303 --> 01:10:23,804
Do you have any idea to who?

1375
01:10:24,305 --> 01:10:25,556
No, why?

1376
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:27,159
Well, I'm just curious.
I wanted to see

1377
01:10:27,308 --> 01:10:29,068
if there's any leads
you guys didn't run out.

1378
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:31,687
Saviano was a fucking train
wreck five years ago, Mike.

1379
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,105
We didn't miss anything.

1380
01:10:33,188 --> 01:10:34,857
This story needed Spotlight.

1381
01:10:36,317 --> 01:10:38,319
Yeah, I agree.
I'm just following up.

1382
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:42,990
Good night.
Yeah, good night.

1383
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:49,038
This is unbelievable.

1384
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:50,289
When did you get this?

1385
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:52,499
Macleish emailed
the list this morning.

1386
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:55,210
He settled cases
against 45 priests.

1387
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:57,755
Where are we on Law?

1388
01:10:57,838 --> 01:10:59,757
Anything that shows he
had knowledge of this?

1389
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,134
We're still working Garabedian.
But nothing concrete.

1390
01:11:02,468 --> 01:11:04,762
I keep thinking about that
conversation we had the other night

1391
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:07,222
about how Law called
down the power of God

1392
01:11:07,306 --> 01:11:09,683
when we reported on Porter.

1393
01:11:10,059 --> 01:11:12,144
That's just Law
being Law.

1394
01:11:12,227 --> 01:11:13,771
Okay, but I checked the clips,

1395
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:17,399
and, uh, Porter isn't even
in the Boston archdiocese.

1396
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:20,235
- He's from Fall River.
- So

1397
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,862
why the extreme reaction?

1398
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:25,074
Law had to know.

1399
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:27,534
That's why he
had the reaction.

1400
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:29,370
Because he knew
there were others.

1401
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:34,541
I think that's
the bigger story.

1402
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:37,586
Bigger than 50 priests?

1403
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:40,464
If it came from
the top down, yes.

1404
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:42,383
But the numbers
clearly indicate

1405
01:11:42,508 --> 01:11:44,028
that there were senior
clergy involved.

1406
01:11:44,176 --> 01:11:45,427
That's all they do.
Indicate.

1407
01:11:45,594 --> 01:11:47,262
Are you telling me
that if we run a story

1408
01:11:47,388 --> 01:11:49,056
with 50 pedophile
priests in Boston...

1409
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:50,391
Mike!

1410
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:52,714
We'll get into the same cat
fight you got into on Porter,

1411
01:11:52,768 --> 01:11:54,311
which made a lot of noise,

1412
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:56,397
but changed things
not one bit.

1413
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:03,237
We need to focus on the institution,
not the individual priests.

1414
01:12:03,862 --> 01:12:05,155
Practice and policy.

1415
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:07,491
Show me the Church
manipulated the system

1416
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:09,201
so that these guys wouldn't
have to face charges.

1417
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:11,245
Show me they put
those same priests

1418
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,372
back into parishes,
time and time again.

1419
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:14,957
Show me this was systemic,

1420
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,084
that it came
from the top down.

1421
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:21,255
Sounds like we're
going after Law.

1422
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:27,428
We're going
after the system.

1423
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:32,933
Make a list of all the victims we have.
Start reaching out.

1424
01:12:33,142 --> 01:12:34,862
And bring Matt in if you need help.
Mmm-hmm.

1425
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:36,478
Okay. Hey, when you
go to Springfield?

1426
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:38,605
- Our hearing is Monday.
- Okay.

1427
01:12:39,273 --> 01:12:40,941
Hey, Robby,
you got a second?

1428
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,401
Yeah.

1429
01:12:43,444 --> 01:12:45,863
I, uh, got one of those
treatment centers

1430
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:47,114
a block from
my house.

1431
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:51,035
We got neighbors
with kids.

1432
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:54,371
I know that the work we do is
confidential, but I'm feeling like...

1433
01:12:55,581 --> 01:12:56,707
I should tell 'em.

1434
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,463
We'll tell 'em soon.

1435
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:04,631
You sure?

1436
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:07,134
Yeah.
Okay.

1437
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:13,057
Hi there. I'm Sacha Pfeiffer.
I'm with <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

1438
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:15,851
I was just looking for a gentleman
by the name of Matthew Walsh.

1439
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:18,562
Uh...
No, he's not.

1440
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:24,526
Yeah, okay. Okay.

1441
01:13:31,742 --> 01:13:32,785
Hi.
Hi.

1442
01:13:32,868 --> 01:13:34,119
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

1443
01:13:34,244 --> 01:13:35,454
Yeah, what do you want?

1444
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:37,017
I'd like to speak
with Thomas Kennedy.

1445
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:38,415
He doesn't live
here anymore.

1446
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,792
Do you know
where he lives?

1447
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:41,835
Sir, I'd just like
to ask a few...

1448
01:13:44,004 --> 01:13:45,130
Uh, Sacha Pfeiffer,
<i>Boston Globe.</i>

1449
01:13:45,214 --> 01:13:46,673
Oh, yeah, hi.

1450
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:48,175
Hi. Thank you.

1451
01:13:48,842 --> 01:13:50,302
Anything else
you can recall?

1452
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:51,887
No.

1453
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,847
No, but I got
a cousin in Quincy.

1454
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:55,808
She saw him in the street
a few years later.

1455
01:13:56,683 --> 01:13:58,268
<i>The Bishop came
over to the house.</i>

1456
01:13:58,352 --> 01:14:00,020
He said nothing like this
had ever happened before,

1457
01:14:00,104 --> 01:14:01,647
and he asked us
not to press charges.

1458
01:14:02,064 --> 01:14:03,857
And what did
your mother do?

1459
01:14:03,941 --> 01:14:05,234
My mother?

1460
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:08,278
She put out
freakin' cookies.

1461
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:14,701
<i>There was a lot of
pressure to keep quiet.</i>

1462
01:14:15,035 --> 01:14:16,036
From the Church?

1463
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,871
Yeah, from
the Church.

1464
01:14:17,955 --> 01:14:19,873
But not just
the Church.

1465
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:22,626
From my friends,

1466
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:24,253
from the other
parishioners.

1467
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:26,421
<i>Well, many of
the priests that I treated</i>

1468
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:28,799
<i>were psychosexually stunted,</i>

1469
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:31,135
<i>on the emotional level
of a 12- or 13-year-old.</i>

1470
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:32,636
Jeez.

1471
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,513
Sure the Chief knew.
Everybody knew,

1472
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:36,390
but nobody wants
to cuff a priest.

1473
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:37,558
Mmm.

1474
01:14:38,142 --> 01:14:39,393
And what about
the prosecutor?

1475
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:41,979
I shouldn't talk
about this shit.

1476
01:14:42,146 --> 01:14:44,356
I think you should,
actually.

1477
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:46,692
Do you know a Father Hurley
or a Father Gale?

1478
01:14:47,442 --> 01:14:48,485
I do.

1479
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:49,736
I swear to God,
I'll beat the shit out of you.

1480
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:51,029
Sorry to bother you.

1481
01:14:51,113 --> 01:14:52,281
You leave me alone,
you leave my brother alone!

1482
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:53,365
You hear me,
God damn it?

1483
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:04,042
Hi there.
I'm looking for Ronald Paquin.

1484
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:05,127
Yes?

1485
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:07,421
You're Father Paquin?

1486
01:15:07,546 --> 01:15:08,630
Yes, that's right.

1487
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:11,967
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

1488
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,050
Okay.

1489
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:14,511
Could I ask you
a few questions?

1490
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:16,138
Go ahead, dear.

1491
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:18,849
We spoke to several men who
you knew when they were boys

1492
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:20,601
at St. John the Baptist
in Haverhill.

1493
01:15:23,145 --> 01:15:24,938
They told us you molested them.
Is that true?

1494
01:15:27,441 --> 01:15:31,361
Sure I fooled around,
but I never felt gratified myself.

1495
01:15:32,946 --> 01:15:35,699
Right. Um, but you
admit to molesting boys

1496
01:15:35,782 --> 01:15:36,867
at St. John the Baptist?

1497
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:40,412
Yes, yes,
but as I said,

1498
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:42,039
I never got
any pleasure from it.

1499
01:15:42,497 --> 01:15:44,499
That's important
to understand.

1500
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:45,667
Right.

1501
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:49,046
Um, but can you
tell me where and how

1502
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:50,449
you fooled around
with these boys?

1503
01:15:52,049 --> 01:15:53,759
I want to be clear,

1504
01:15:53,842 --> 01:15:55,469
I never raped anyone.

1505
01:15:56,637 --> 01:15:58,805
There's a difference.
I should know.

1506
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:00,641
How would you know?

1507
01:16:00,766 --> 01:16:01,892
I was raped.

1508
01:16:04,645 --> 01:16:06,438
I'm sorry,
who raped you?

1509
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:07,522
Ronnie, who're
you talking to?

1510
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:09,107
It's okay, Jane.
Father Paquin, who raped you?

1511
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:10,192
Who are you?

1512
01:16:10,651 --> 01:16:12,527
Uh... Sacha Pfeiffer,
from the <i>Globe.</i>

1513
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:14,574
Please get off my porch.
I can speak for myself.

1514
01:16:14,655 --> 01:16:16,657
Get inside the house, Ronnie.
Mr...

1515
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,533
Get inside, Ronald.
Sorry.

1516
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,785
Uh, I'm sorry, who are you?

1517
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:20,953
I'm his sister,

1518
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:22,246
and I don't want
you coming back here.

1519
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:23,497
Ms. Paquin...

1520
01:16:31,213 --> 01:16:32,839
Beat you to
the end of the street!

1521
01:16:32,965 --> 01:16:34,645
No, you won't.
I beat you last time!

1522
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:35,796
No, you didn't,
you cheated!

1523
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:36,885
You did!

1524
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:47,521
Could you please clarify the <i>Globe's</i>
position for me, Mr. Albano?

1525
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:49,189
Yes, Judge Sweeney.

1526
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,779
Our argument to make
these documents public

1527
01:16:55,862 --> 01:16:58,490
rests mainly on
First Amendment grounds.

1528
01:16:58,782 --> 01:17:01,368
We also have a number
of other relevant arguments.

1529
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:02,452
After all, Your Honor,

1530
01:17:02,536 --> 01:17:03,787
this was a
discretionary order.

1531
01:17:04,204 --> 01:17:06,707
Yes, it was made
at the Judge's discretion.

1532
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:08,166
Hey, Mike.

1533
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:09,543
Hey, Joe.

1534
01:17:10,377 --> 01:17:11,461
What's a
Spotlight reporter

1535
01:17:11,545 --> 01:17:12,671
doing in Springfield?

1536
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:17,634
Your boy Albano's
sledding uphill.

1537
01:17:17,718 --> 01:17:19,594
You actually think you have a
shot at winning this thing?

1538
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:21,471
You want me to comment
for the <i>Herald?</i>

1539
01:17:23,724 --> 01:17:26,226
<i>"Globe</i> reporter
would not comment,

1540
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,646
"but he did not
seem hopeful."

1541
01:17:30,772 --> 01:17:32,691
He didn't try
and hide it at all.

1542
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:35,652
He had this really odd
rationalization for it.

1543
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:37,154
Like it was
totally normal

1544
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:38,477
to fool around
with little boys.

1545
01:17:39,406 --> 01:17:41,700
I'd really like to go back.
I think he'd talk to us.

1546
01:17:42,534 --> 01:17:43,910
Oh, we will.

1547
01:17:44,411 --> 01:17:45,829
Just not yet.

1548
01:17:45,912 --> 01:17:48,623
I want you to stay focused
on the victims right now.

1549
01:17:48,707 --> 01:17:51,126
Sacha, where'd they send
Father Talbot again?

1550
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:53,253
Um, I think...
Wasn't that Cheverus?

1551
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:54,713
Cheverus, that's right.

1552
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:57,341
Wait, Father Talbot
from BC High?

1553
01:17:57,758 --> 01:17:59,468
Yeah, you know him?

1554
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:01,803
Yeah, he was there
when I was.

1555
01:18:02,429 --> 01:18:03,472
We have a victim?

1556
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:05,766
Yeah, lives
in Providence.

1557
01:18:09,436 --> 01:18:12,356
There's nothing personal in
these documents, Your Honor.

1558
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:13,774
They concern how the
Cardinal is handling...

1559
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:15,233
Say "the archdiocese."

1560
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:17,736
Excuse me?

1561
01:18:17,819 --> 01:18:19,237
You don't get to
tag the Cardinal

1562
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:21,156
with everything,
Mr. Albano.

1563
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:22,908
Say "the archdiocese."

1564
01:18:23,575 --> 01:18:25,535
Judge Sweeney, the <i>Globe</i>
is not a party to this case,

1565
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:26,703
they just want
to sell papers.

1566
01:18:26,787 --> 01:18:29,122
If Mr. Garabedian
had not smeared

1567
01:18:29,206 --> 01:18:30,499
the Cardinal's
good name,

1568
01:18:31,124 --> 01:18:32,584
we wouldn't even be here.

1569
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:34,795
Your Honor, I object to the
use of the word "smear."

1570
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,505
Duly noted,
Mr. Garabedian.

1571
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:37,748
Thank you, Your Honor.

1572
01:18:37,798 --> 01:18:38,798
Anything else,
Mr. Rogers?

1573
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,841
No, Your Honor.

1574
01:18:40,092 --> 01:18:42,135
Mr. Albano,
you may continue.

1575
01:18:42,302 --> 01:18:43,382
<i>The Globe</i>
believes having...

1576
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:47,724
Hey, Mitch,
how are you doing?

1577
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:49,142
I'm fine.

1578
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:52,312
He's tough,
that Wilson Rogers.

1579
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:53,980
He's smug.

1580
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:55,816
And he's sloppy.

1581
01:18:56,066 --> 01:18:57,651
He doesn't seem sloppy.

1582
01:18:58,318 --> 01:19:00,070
You don't know the half of it.
Trust me.

1583
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:03,156
What's the
half of it?

1584
01:19:05,325 --> 01:19:06,576
Tell me the
half of it, Mitch.

1585
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:10,747
Off the record?
Off the record, yeah.

1586
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:16,837
Three years ago,
I get a call from an ex-priest.

1587
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,171
Anthony Benzevich.

1588
01:19:18,338 --> 01:19:20,590
He was at Blessed
Sacrament back in '62,

1589
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:22,968
and he saw Geoghan

1590
01:19:24,136 --> 01:19:26,263
taking little boys up to
the rectory bedroom, okay?

1591
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:28,265
So he's appalled,
all right?

1592
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:29,474
Tells the bishop
about it.

1593
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:32,269
The bishop threatens
to reassign him

1594
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:34,187
to South America.

1595
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:35,772
Jesus.
Yeah, all right.

1596
01:19:35,856 --> 01:19:37,274
So fast forward 35 years,

1597
01:19:37,357 --> 01:19:39,109
Benzevich reads that
Geoghan's been charged

1598
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:41,027
with molesting
hundreds of kids.

1599
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:43,447
All right? So he feels guilty.
He calls me.

1600
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:45,699
So you have
testimony of a priest

1601
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:48,034
telling his superiors
about Geoghan in '62?

1602
01:19:48,702 --> 01:19:50,203
No, I do not.

1603
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:52,873
Because when I called Benzevich
in to give a deposition,

1604
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:54,207
he comes in
with a lawyer.

1605
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:56,668
Wilson Rogers.
Right.

1606
01:19:57,127 --> 01:19:58,295
And suddenly
Father Benzevich

1607
01:19:58,378 --> 01:19:59,629
has a very foggy memory.

1608
01:19:59,838 --> 01:20:01,798
Can't remember anything.
He's useless.

1609
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:03,091
So I go back to work,

1610
01:20:03,175 --> 01:20:04,509
I forget about it.
Whatever.

1611
01:20:05,218 --> 01:20:07,053
Until about a year ago,
I find an article

1612
01:20:07,137 --> 01:20:10,223
about a priest who warned
church officials about Geoghan.

1613
01:20:10,724 --> 01:20:12,559
Benzevich went to the press?
Yeah.

1614
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:15,395
Yeah, local paper, <i>Patriot Ledger.</i>
Nobody saw it.

1615
01:20:15,562 --> 01:20:17,147
But now I got
Benzevich on record.

1616
01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:20,567
So I file a motion to depose
Benzevich a second time.

1617
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:22,861
All right?
And Wilson Rogers,

1618
01:20:22,944 --> 01:20:24,488
that smug son of a bitch,

1619
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:27,240
he files a motion
opposing my motion.

1620
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:29,201
And that's when
I have him.

1621
01:20:30,744 --> 01:20:31,912
Have him how?

1622
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:33,872
Rogers opposes my motion,

1623
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:35,332
so I have to
make an argument

1624
01:20:35,415 --> 01:20:36,458
as to why I'm
allowed to depose.

1625
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,376
Father Benzevich
a second time, okay?

1626
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:41,254
But this time,
I'm allowed to attach exhibits.

1627
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:42,998
Do you follow
what I'm saying?

1628
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:44,758
The sealed documents?
Yes.

1629
01:20:45,091 --> 01:20:47,093
I can attach
the sealed documents

1630
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,262
that I've gotten in discovery,
Mr. Rezendes,

1631
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:52,349
the same documents that your
paper is currently suing for.

1632
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,476
You're shitting me?

1633
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:56,436
What?
No. No, I'm not shitting you.

1634
01:20:56,603 --> 01:20:59,439
So I pull out the 14
most damning docs

1635
01:20:59,523 --> 01:21:00,899
and I attach 'em
to my motion.

1636
01:21:01,066 --> 01:21:02,734
And they prove
everything. Everything.

1637
01:21:02,943 --> 01:21:05,445
About the Church,
about the bishops, about Law.

1638
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:07,280
And it's all public?

1639
01:21:07,572 --> 01:21:10,033
Because your motion
to oppose Roger's motion

1640
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,202
is public.
Yeah, exactly.

1641
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:13,411
Now you're
paying attention.

1642
01:21:13,578 --> 01:21:15,580
So I could just walk into
that courthouse right now

1643
01:21:15,747 --> 01:21:16,873
and get those documents?

1644
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,708
No, you cannot,

1645
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:20,293
because the documents
are not there.

1646
01:21:20,961 --> 01:21:22,295
But you just
said they're public.

1647
01:21:22,379 --> 01:21:25,507
I know I did,
but this is Boston,

1648
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:29,094
and the Church does not
want them to be found.

1649
01:21:29,427 --> 01:21:30,804
So they are not there.

1650
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:35,141
Mitch, are you telling me
that the Catholic Church

1651
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:37,602
removed legal documents
from that courthouse?

1652
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:41,147
Look, I'm not crazy,
I'm not paranoid.

1653
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:42,482
I'm experienced.

1654
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:44,651
Check the docket.
You'll see.

1655
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,153
They control everything.

1656
01:21:50,073 --> 01:21:51,241
Everything.

1657
01:21:53,326 --> 01:21:54,953
I gotta go back in.

1658
01:21:58,665 --> 01:22:01,459
These guys got
the fucking documents.

1659
01:22:15,765 --> 01:22:18,977
Docket entry number 49,
it's in the Geoghan case.

1660
01:22:19,144 --> 01:22:20,224
We're closing
in 10 minutes.

1661
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:22,022
Ten minutes?
All right.

1662
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:00,977
- Robby.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

1663
01:23:01,061 --> 01:23:02,437
Hey.
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>

1664
01:23:02,854 --> 01:23:06,358
Garabedian gave me a tip.
Some of the sealed docs are already public.

1665
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:07,859
They're part of
a motion he filed.

1666
01:23:08,276 --> 01:23:09,819
<i>He said they're
the best of the bunch.</i>

1667
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:11,488
<i>We don't have to wait
for Sweeney's ruling.</i>

1668
01:23:11,571 --> 01:23:12,739
So we can get them?

1669
01:23:12,864 --> 01:23:13,990
<i>Yeah, but they're not there.</i>

1670
01:23:14,324 --> 01:23:15,325
Already talked to Albano.

1671
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:17,285
He said all we have
to do is file a motion,

1672
01:23:17,452 --> 01:23:19,829
and Sweeney will order Mitch
to refile the docs.

1673
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:21,956
And you think
these documents are...

1674
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,709
<i>He said these 14 docs were all we need.
They're huge.</i>

1675
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:29,005
Okay. I'll call Ben.
Good work.

1676
01:23:45,397 --> 01:23:47,399
<i>Whether
this was truly an accident</i>

1677
01:23:47,482 --> 01:23:48,942
<i>or someone committed
an intentional act.</i>

1678
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:50,652
<i>But either way,
extensive damage</i>

1679
01:23:50,735 --> 01:23:52,112
<i>has been done
to this building.</i>

1680
01:23:54,489 --> 01:23:56,282
What happened?

1681
01:23:56,366 --> 01:23:58,284
They're saying
it's a prop plane,

1682
01:23:58,368 --> 01:23:59,536
but that's not
a prop plane.

1683
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:06,459
Tell Linda to get every
reporter we have in here now.

1684
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:09,804
<i>You pray for the victims,</i>

1685
01:24:09,879 --> 01:24:12,590
<i>you pray for the injured,</i>

1686
01:24:13,258 --> 01:24:15,760
<i>and you pray for
those who survived.</i>

1687
01:24:16,928 --> 01:24:19,681
<i>You pray, too, for the nation.</i>

1688
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:27,063
<i>That our response to this might reflect
the best ideals of our nation.</i>

1689
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:31,317
<i>And even more,
reflect God's own teaching.</i>

1690
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:35,864
<i>Not only as it's shown
in Christianity and Judaism,</i>

1691
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:38,283
<i>but in Islam as well.</i>

1692
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:40,785
Not bad. Who's there?
Paulson.

1693
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:42,620
I wanna talk to him
when he's back.

1694
01:24:43,204 --> 01:24:45,004
Did Rezendes find a way
to get to Florida yet?

1695
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:46,875
They just opened the
airport in Providence.

1696
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:47,959
He's on his way
there now.

1697
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,378
Ben, I'm gonna need more
people on Massport.

1698
01:24:50,462 --> 01:24:51,880
I'll give you
three of my guys.

1699
01:24:51,963 --> 01:24:53,883
- Robby, put your team on that, too.
- Got it.

1700
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:55,216
And Robby,
everything else stops.

1701
01:24:55,341 --> 01:24:56,676
Understood.

1702
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:58,178
Why's Mike going
to Florida?

1703
01:24:58,261 --> 01:25:01,097
Flight school. It's
where they learned to fly.

1704
01:25:01,181 --> 01:25:03,975
Robby, I've got a lot of victim
interviews set up this week.

1705
01:25:04,058 --> 01:25:05,435
We have to cancel 'em.

1706
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:06,811
That's gonna be hard.
I know.

1707
01:25:06,978 --> 01:25:08,938
This is nuts.
Two days ago I told my wife

1708
01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:10,940
we gotta be working the
biggest story on the planet.

1709
01:25:11,024 --> 01:25:12,317
<i>Boston Globe.</i>

1710
01:25:12,484 --> 01:25:14,324
<i>Boston Globe.</i>
One moment, please.

1711
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:16,808
Yes, if you have a tip,
I will transfer you down to Metro.

1712
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:20,200
Mitchell Garabedian.

1713
01:25:20,283 --> 01:25:21,659
<i>Mitch, it's Mike,
I've been trying to reach you.</i>

1714
01:25:21,743 --> 01:25:23,453
I don't have time to talk to you,
Mr. Rezendes.

1715
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:26,247
Hey, just quickly,
did you refile those docs yet?

1716
01:25:26,331 --> 01:25:28,171
<i>No, I just
got the order. It takes time.</i>

1717
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:29,959
Okay, great. Can you hold
off on refiling them?

1718
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:31,461
<i>Hold off?</i>
I have to go to Florida.

1719
01:25:31,628 --> 01:25:33,046
Once you refile
they're public.

1720
01:25:33,213 --> 01:25:35,213
Other newspapers will be
able to get a hold of 'em.

1721
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:39,135
<i>Other newspapers are not my concern.
I received a judicial order.</i>

1722
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:41,095
<i>I told you the Church
is watching me.</i>

1723
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:43,765
Oh, hey, Mitch, please.
All I need's a few more weeks.

1724
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:47,227
<i>I can't make any promises.
Goodbye.</i>

1725
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:49,854
Mitch? Mitch! Shit!

1726
01:25:51,773 --> 01:25:52,774
Shit.

1727
01:26:01,741 --> 01:26:03,785
<i>Look, I get it,
no one wants to read</i>

1728
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:05,161
<i>about kids getting
raped by priests.</i>

1729
01:26:05,245 --> 01:26:06,329
Especially now.

1730
01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:07,932
But you asked a lot
of people to relive

1731
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:09,332
some very
painful experiences,

1732
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:10,458
and you just disappear.

1733
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:12,168
Phil, you know why we were
taken off of the story.

1734
01:26:12,252 --> 01:26:14,045
It's been six weeks
since 9/11.

1735
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:16,381
I realize that and we're
gonna get back to it.

1736
01:26:16,548 --> 01:26:17,549
When?

1737
01:26:19,217 --> 01:26:21,217
You're doing the same thing
you guys did last time.

1738
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:22,303
No.
You're dropping us.

1739
01:26:22,428 --> 01:26:24,514
No. Maybe I should tell
the <i>Herald</i> that story.

1740
01:26:25,849 --> 01:26:27,934
Okay, Phil,
you go ahead and do that.

1741
01:26:28,685 --> 01:26:31,813
It will undo all the work we've done,
but I can't stop you.

1742
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:37,360
Listen to me.
I am here because I care.

1743
01:26:39,445 --> 01:26:40,864
We're not going away.

1744
01:26:41,614 --> 01:26:43,774
We're gonna tell this story,
we're gonna tell it right.

1745
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:46,452
We just need a little more time.
That's all we're asking for.

1746
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:51,207
Why bother asking?

1747
01:26:52,584 --> 01:26:54,419
You're gonna do
what you want anyway.

1748
01:26:55,587 --> 01:26:57,171
You always do.

1749
01:26:57,881 --> 01:26:58,882
Phil.

1750
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:00,842
Phil.

1751
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,016
Hey.

1752
01:27:08,099 --> 01:27:09,475
<i>How's South Beach?</i>

1753
01:27:09,559 --> 01:27:12,312
Boynton Beach.
Remarkably different place.

1754
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:13,897
What's up?

1755
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,982
<i>Mitch Garabedian
called me today.</i>

1756
01:27:16,274 --> 01:27:18,568
Why'd he call you?
<i>'Cause he knew you'd yell at him.</i>

1757
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:20,278
<i>He refiled the docs.</i>

1758
01:27:20,445 --> 01:27:21,446
What?

1759
01:27:21,946 --> 01:27:23,531
Robby, those docs
are public now.

1760
01:27:23,615 --> 01:27:24,866
<i>We gotta get there
before anyone else does.</i>

1761
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:26,367
I know. I know. I know.

1762
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:28,244
Just wrap up
whatever you're doing

1763
01:27:28,328 --> 01:27:29,448
and get
the first flight out.

1764
01:27:29,495 --> 01:27:31,623
<i>I'll book a flight now and go
straight to the courthouse tomorrow.</i>

1765
01:27:31,706 --> 01:27:33,708
All right. Call me when you get in.
<i>Okay.</i>

1766
01:27:35,835 --> 01:27:38,838
Robby, I'd like to let Phil Saviano
know that we're back on it.

1767
01:27:39,005 --> 01:27:40,590
Good idea.

1768
01:27:40,673 --> 01:27:42,300
Go have dinner with Hansi.

1769
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:43,760
Might be the last time
for a while.

1770
01:27:44,385 --> 01:27:45,386
Mmm-hmm.

1771
01:27:49,724 --> 01:27:52,101
Robby, after
we saw Macleish,

1772
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:53,705
I started going
back through the clips,

1773
01:27:54,062 --> 01:27:56,272
and I had a little time
last week finally.

1774
01:27:56,356 --> 01:27:58,983
So, um, I found that.

1775
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:02,028
It's from '93.

1776
01:28:11,955 --> 01:28:12,997
That it?

1777
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,502
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1778
01:28:20,004 --> 01:28:21,047
Good night.

1779
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:24,092
Okay, good night.

1780
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:05,383
So, I was probably a few
years after you, right?

1781
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,844
No, you were
more than a few.

1782
01:29:07,927 --> 01:29:09,095
Believe me.

1783
01:29:09,971 --> 01:29:12,890
Well, after BC High,
I came down to Providence

1784
01:29:13,057 --> 01:29:14,475
and played hockey
for the Friars.

1785
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:17,478
Oh, well, you must
have been pretty good.

1786
01:29:17,645 --> 01:29:19,981
No. Rode the bench in college.
Yeah. Oh.

1787
01:29:20,398 --> 01:29:21,607
But I loved the city.

1788
01:29:22,025 --> 01:29:23,818
Oh.
And we just had our third kid.

1789
01:29:24,444 --> 01:29:26,112
And I still get my <i>Globe,</i>
for the record.

1790
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:28,781
Oh, that's good to know.
Good to know.

1791
01:29:29,657 --> 01:29:33,661
Look, Kevin, uh,
that's actually why I'm here.

1792
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:39,459
I need to ask you some
questions about Father Talbot.

1793
01:29:46,674 --> 01:29:48,092
How'd you find out?

1794
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:50,803
Well...

1795
01:29:51,721 --> 01:29:53,556
I guess
it doesn't matter.

1796
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:01,981
And I never even
told my wife.

1797
01:30:03,149 --> 01:30:04,817
Excuse me.

1798
01:30:10,114 --> 01:30:12,194
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I need to get in there.

1799
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:13,743
We're closed. Come on, let me in.
Five minutes.

1800
01:30:13,826 --> 01:30:15,161
I'm sorry, we're closed.

1801
01:30:15,286 --> 01:30:16,579
Come on. Five minutes.

1802
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:26,255
Hello.

1803
01:30:31,886 --> 01:30:33,346
Here.

1804
01:30:36,557 --> 01:30:38,351
This is the Geoghan case?
That's right.

1805
01:30:39,185 --> 01:30:40,770
Those records are sealed.
No.

1806
01:30:40,937 --> 01:30:43,564
That's a public motion.
Those records are public.

1807
01:30:43,648 --> 01:30:44,857
Look, I work for the <i>Globe.</i>

1808
01:30:45,858 --> 01:30:46,943
Good for you.

1809
01:30:49,028 --> 01:30:50,404
Can I talk to
your supervisor?

1810
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:51,948
He's not in today.

1811
01:30:52,448 --> 01:30:53,658
What about a judge?

1812
01:30:53,741 --> 01:30:56,035
There must be judges that
work on this kind of thing.

1813
01:30:56,536 --> 01:30:57,912
Sixth floor.

1814
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:07,894
We understand the nature of the
allegations against Father Talbot.

1815
01:31:08,381 --> 01:31:11,467
I'm just not sure what you
want from President Kemeza.

1816
01:31:12,218 --> 01:31:14,220
Talbot taught here long
before Bill took over.

1817
01:31:14,387 --> 01:31:16,848
Mmm. Of course.
We just want to know

1818
01:31:16,931 --> 01:31:18,724
if it's possible
that the president,

1819
01:31:18,891 --> 01:31:20,226
the faculty, the board,

1820
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:22,109
that no one knew what was
going on at the time.

1821
01:31:22,145 --> 01:31:26,482
I graduated in 1979, and I had
no idea about any of this.

1822
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,068
So if you're suggesting that
Father Gibbons and Father Callahan

1823
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,319
had in any way...

1824
01:31:30,403 --> 01:31:32,280
Gibbons and Callahan...

1825
01:31:32,363 --> 01:31:34,240
I mean, they ran this
place like the navy.

1826
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:36,431
Do you really think
they didn't know?

1827
01:31:37,493 --> 01:31:39,495
It's a big school, Robby.
You know that.

1828
01:31:40,246 --> 01:31:42,915
And we're talking about
seven alleged victims

1829
01:31:43,082 --> 01:31:44,417
over, what, eight years.

1830
01:31:44,584 --> 01:31:47,753
We're talking about
seven that we know about.

1831
01:31:48,045 --> 01:31:49,755
This is ridiculous.

1832
01:31:50,381 --> 01:31:52,541
You're reaching for a story here.
We cannot possibly...

1833
01:31:52,592 --> 01:31:55,511
Jack. Jack. Jack.
If I had been president then,

1834
01:31:55,595 --> 01:31:56,762
I would've known.

1835
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:59,265
Bill, I'm not sure
that's relevant.

1836
01:31:59,432 --> 01:32:02,101
Why do you think they sent
Talbot up to Cheverus?

1837
01:32:02,935 --> 01:32:04,937
You know they
wanted him out of town.

1838
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:10,026
Robby, as well
intentioned as Bill's remarks are,

1839
01:32:10,109 --> 01:32:11,819
I'm hoping we can
keep this between us

1840
01:32:11,944 --> 01:32:13,696
until we all get
on the same page.

1841
01:32:17,408 --> 01:32:19,288
Is that why we're here,
to get on the same page?

1842
01:32:19,911 --> 01:32:21,954
No, we're here because you're
an important alumnus, Robby,

1843
01:32:22,038 --> 01:32:23,206
and a friend.

1844
01:32:23,289 --> 01:32:26,667
Exactly, and we know you care about
this school as much as we do.

1845
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:30,463
Did you play
a sport here, Jack?

1846
01:32:31,088 --> 01:32:32,798
Yeah. Football. Why?

1847
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:34,967
Mmm. I ran track.

1848
01:32:35,051 --> 01:32:37,220
You know, I went to
Providence yesterday

1849
01:32:37,345 --> 01:32:39,472
to talk to one of
Father Talbot's victims.

1850
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:40,973
He played hockey here.

1851
01:32:41,432 --> 01:32:43,392
And, uh, he's one
of the better ones.

1852
01:32:43,476 --> 01:32:46,437
He's got a wife,
kids, good job.

1853
01:32:48,481 --> 01:32:51,984
About 10 minutes
into the conversation,

1854
01:32:52,068 --> 01:32:53,319
the guy breaks down.

1855
01:32:53,903 --> 01:32:55,655
You know,
couldn't stop crying.

1856
01:32:57,281 --> 01:33:00,493
Said he could never figure out
why Father Talbot picked him.

1857
01:33:02,828 --> 01:33:05,331
Father Talbot
coached the hockey team.

1858
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:08,668
So,

1859
01:33:10,044 --> 01:33:11,462
I guess we just got lucky.

1860
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:14,507
You and me.

1861
01:33:20,596 --> 01:33:22,265
Does Jack Dunn
work for the school?

1862
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:24,100
No, he's PR
for Boston College.

1863
01:33:24,308 --> 01:33:26,018
They call him
when they need help.

1864
01:33:26,185 --> 01:33:28,104
And Pete Conley?
Why was he there?

1865
01:33:28,271 --> 01:33:29,272
Good question.

1866
01:33:29,355 --> 01:33:31,315
Pete's a big alum,
but I called Bill directly,

1867
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:33,067
and I asked
for a sit-down.

1868
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:34,944
I never mentioned
anybody else.

1869
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:38,364
It's like everybody
already knows the story.

1870
01:33:38,531 --> 01:33:39,740
Yeah.

1871
01:33:39,824 --> 01:33:42,118
Except us.
And we work right there.

1872
01:33:45,955 --> 01:33:47,373
Judge Volterra?
Yes.

1873
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:49,709
Hi, I'm Mike Rezendes
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

1874
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:51,419
Um, I'm having
some trouble

1875
01:33:51,502 --> 01:33:52,628
accessing some
public records

1876
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:53,879
down in the
records room.

1877
01:33:53,963 --> 01:33:56,215
I was wondering if I could
have a word with you?

1878
01:33:56,299 --> 01:33:58,217
All right.
Thank you.

1879
01:34:00,594 --> 01:34:01,595
Thank you very much.

1880
01:34:03,222 --> 01:34:06,559
These exhibits you're after,
Mr. Rezendes,

1881
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,061
they're very
sensitive records.

1882
01:34:09,895 --> 01:34:11,230
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

1883
01:34:11,314 --> 01:34:13,232
that's not the question.

1884
01:34:13,316 --> 01:34:14,567
The records are public.

1885
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:18,070
Maybe so, but tell me,

1886
01:34:18,487 --> 01:34:20,406
where's the editorial
responsibility

1887
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:22,408
in publishing
records of this nature?

1888
01:34:22,742 --> 01:34:26,871
Well, where's the editorial
responsibility in not publishing them?

1889
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:39,342
You can't take those.
You need to make copies.

1890
01:34:39,425 --> 01:34:40,801
I'm going to the copy room.

1891
01:34:40,885 --> 01:34:42,720
It closed at 4:00.

1892
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:48,976
Look, I'll give you

1893
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,730
83 bucks to use yours.

1894
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:01,322
Hey, cabbie!

1895
01:35:01,405 --> 01:35:04,408
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1896
01:35:07,036 --> 01:35:09,830
Take me to <i>The Boston Globe</i>
on Morrissey Boulevard.

1897
01:35:09,914 --> 01:35:13,000
Don't take 93.
Take Dorchester Avenue.

1898
01:35:14,752 --> 01:35:16,629
<i>Robby, it's incredible!</i>

1899
01:35:16,837 --> 01:35:19,673
<i>Law knew about Geoghan for years,
no question.</i>

1900
01:35:19,757 --> 01:35:22,676
<i>There's a letter to Law
from a woman Margaret Gallant,</i>

1901
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,805
<i>who lived in Jamaica Plain in the
early '80s when Geoghan was there.</i>

1902
01:35:25,888 --> 01:35:27,223
<i>Listen to this,</i>

1903
01:35:27,306 --> 01:35:29,558
<i>"Our family is
rooted in the Church,"</i>

1904
01:35:29,642 --> 01:35:32,103
<i>"our desire is to
protect the Holy Orders,"</i>

1905
01:35:32,728 --> 01:35:34,647
<i>"even in the midst
of our agony"</i>

1906
01:35:34,814 --> 01:35:36,774
<i>"over the seven boys
in our family"</i>

1907
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:37,942
<i>"who have been violated."</i>

1908
01:35:38,025 --> 01:35:40,319
<i>Seven, Robby. Seven boys.</i>

1909
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:43,239
<i>"It was suggested
we keep silent."</i>

1910
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:46,784
<i>"We did not question the authority
of the Church two years ago,"</i>

1911
01:35:46,867 --> 01:35:49,829
<i>"but since Father Geoghan
is still in his parish..."</i>

1912
01:35:49,912 --> 01:35:53,499
<i>But she sent it to Law,
and Law did shit.</i>

1913
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:56,669
<i>Here's another one to Law, same year.
Listen to this,</i>

1914
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:59,755
<i>"A word on the recent
assignment of Father Geoghan"</i>

1915
01:35:59,839 --> 01:36:02,883
<i>"as an associate
at St. Julia's in Weston."</i>

1916
01:36:02,967 --> 01:36:07,263
<i>"Father Geoghan has a history of
homosexual involvement with young boys."</i>

1917
01:36:07,346 --> 01:36:09,682
<i>"I understand his recent
departure from St. Brendan's"</i>

1918
01:36:09,765 --> 01:36:11,559
<i>"may be related
to this problem."</i>

1919
01:36:11,642 --> 01:36:14,728
"I wonder if Father Geoghan should
not be reduced to just weekend work"

1920
01:36:14,812 --> 01:36:17,022
"while receiving
some kind of therapy."

1921
01:36:17,106 --> 01:36:19,608
"You know how grateful I am to
you for your constant concern."

1922
01:36:19,775 --> 01:36:21,569
"Sincerely yours in our Lord,."

1923
01:36:21,652 --> 01:36:25,114
"Most Reverend John M. Darcy,
Auxiliary Bishop of Boston."

1924
01:36:25,197 --> 01:36:26,740
"December 7, 1984."

1925
01:36:26,824 --> 01:36:28,534
An auxiliary bishop
wrote that?

1926
01:36:28,701 --> 01:36:30,077
That's incredible.

1927
01:36:30,286 --> 01:36:31,328
He broke ranks.

1928
01:36:31,412 --> 01:36:33,205
I mean,
when did Gallant write her letter?

1929
01:36:33,289 --> 01:36:35,249
1984.
And Law just ignored it.

1930
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:37,585
How do you ignore
that freakin' letter?

1931
01:36:37,835 --> 01:36:39,170
We got 'em.

1932
01:36:39,378 --> 01:36:42,047
You can't read these letters and
think anything else. It's proof.

1933
01:36:42,131 --> 01:36:43,883
Yeah. It is.

1934
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,302
This is good work.

1935
01:36:46,886 --> 01:36:48,471
Should we
take it up to Ben?

1936
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:50,181
Uh...

1937
01:36:50,264 --> 01:36:51,932
No. Not yet.

1938
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:55,686
Why not?
We got Law. This is it.

1939
01:36:56,228 --> 01:36:57,980
No, this is Law
covering for one priest.

1940
01:36:58,063 --> 01:36:59,356
There's another
90 out there.

1941
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:01,442
Yeah, and we'll print
that story when we get it,

1942
01:37:01,525 --> 01:37:02,725
but we gotta go with this now.

1943
01:37:03,152 --> 01:37:04,987
No, I'm not going to
rush this story, Mike.

1944
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,322
We don't have
a choice, Robby.

1945
01:37:06,655 --> 01:37:08,073
If we don't rush to print,

1946
01:37:08,157 --> 01:37:10,743
somebody else is gonna find these
letters and butcher the story.

1947
01:37:10,826 --> 01:37:12,119
Joe Quimby from the <i>Herald</i>

1948
01:37:12,203 --> 01:37:13,746
was at the
freakin' courthouse.

1949
01:37:13,996 --> 01:37:15,581
So we'll write
a holding story,

1950
01:37:15,664 --> 01:37:16,874
and we'll keep our
eye on the <i>Herald.</i>

1951
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:18,042
Keep our eye on the <i>Herald?</i>

1952
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:20,836
They run this and they get it wrong,
the Church will bury it.

1953
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,880
We gotta do this now.
Mike, Mike...

1954
01:37:22,963 --> 01:37:25,382
What? Why are we hesitating?

1955
01:37:25,466 --> 01:37:27,676
Baron told us to get Law.
This is Law.

1956
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,637
Baron told us to
get the system.

1957
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,305
We need the full scope.

1958
01:37:31,388 --> 01:37:33,516
That's the only thing
that will put an end to this.

1959
01:37:33,641 --> 01:37:35,401
Then let's take it up
to Ben, let him decide.

1960
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:37,353
We'll take it to Ben
when I say it's time.

1961
01:37:37,436 --> 01:37:39,980
It's time, Robby. It's time!

1962
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:44,860
They knew and they
let it happen. To kids!

1963
01:37:45,611 --> 01:37:48,113
Okay? It could've been you!
It could've been me!

1964
01:37:48,197 --> 01:37:50,241
It could have been any of us!

1965
01:37:51,033 --> 01:37:52,618
We gotta nail these scumbags!

1966
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:55,829
We gotta show people that
nobody can get away with this!

1967
01:37:55,913 --> 01:37:59,250
Not a priest or a Cardinal
or a freaking Pope!

1968
01:38:02,044 --> 01:38:03,087
You finished?

1969
01:38:04,046 --> 01:38:06,882
Yeah, I am. This is bullshit.

1970
01:38:27,027 --> 01:38:28,028
Oh...

1971
01:38:36,662 --> 01:38:37,663
You okay?

1972
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:42,251
Mmm...

1973
01:38:48,257 --> 01:38:49,300
Hey, Hansi.

1974
01:38:50,134 --> 01:38:52,052
Hard day at work, Mike?

1975
01:38:56,599 --> 01:38:58,183
Here.
Thank you.

1976
01:38:59,059 --> 01:39:01,604
I don't know why
I got so pissed off.

1977
01:39:01,687 --> 01:39:03,105
You know, I think
Robby's wrong.

1978
01:39:03,188 --> 01:39:05,190
You know, you're just...

1979
01:39:05,274 --> 01:39:06,942
You care about the story, Mike.
We all do.

1980
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:11,196
- Yeah, I guess.
- Mmm.

1981
01:39:13,824 --> 01:39:15,909
I stopped going to
church with my Nana.

1982
01:39:17,995 --> 01:39:19,580
It was...
It was too hard.

1983
01:39:20,414 --> 01:39:22,374
You know,
I'd be sitting there,

1984
01:39:22,541 --> 01:39:24,501
and I'd start thinking
about Joe Crowley

1985
01:39:24,585 --> 01:39:26,211
or someone else and I just...

1986
01:39:27,046 --> 01:39:28,255
I just got so angry.

1987
01:39:29,632 --> 01:39:31,550
Did you tell her why?

1988
01:39:32,968 --> 01:39:35,054
She goes to church
three times a week, Mike.

1989
01:39:40,184 --> 01:39:42,186
It really pisses me off.

1990
01:39:43,604 --> 01:39:44,605
You know,

1991
01:39:46,565 --> 01:39:49,818
I actually really liked going to
church when I was a little kid.

1992
01:39:50,778 --> 01:39:51,779
Mmm.

1993
01:39:51,945 --> 01:39:53,280
Why'd you stop?

1994
01:39:53,447 --> 01:39:54,782
Typical shit.

1995
01:39:56,492 --> 01:39:58,619
But the weird thing is,

1996
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,248
I think I...

1997
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:08,587
I think I figured that maybe one day...

1998
01:40:08,671 --> 01:40:10,714
I would actually go back.

1999
01:40:12,675 --> 01:40:14,927
I was really...
I was holding on to that.

2000
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:16,011
Mmm.

2001
01:40:17,429 --> 01:40:20,265
I read those letters, and...

2002
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:24,603
And something just cracked.

2003
01:40:26,188 --> 01:40:28,357
It's a shitty feeling.
Yeah.

2004
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:31,985
It's a shitty feeling.

2005
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:37,116
Looks like a long day.

2006
01:40:37,241 --> 01:40:39,535
Hey, Pete.
I'm sorry to make it longer.

2007
01:40:39,618 --> 01:40:40,994
Brian.

2008
01:40:42,162 --> 01:40:44,498
Has anyone ever said no
to a drink with you, Pete?

2009
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:49,461
Well, sure.
But the trick is to keep asking.

2010
01:40:49,712 --> 01:40:50,796
For Boston.

2011
01:40:50,921 --> 01:40:51,964
Boston.

2012
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:54,341
Mmm.

2013
01:40:54,883 --> 01:40:57,886
So, you here
for the Cardinal?

2014
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,514
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I wouldn't...

2015
01:41:00,597 --> 01:41:03,183
I wouldn't presume to speak
for the Cardinal. No.

2016
01:41:04,977 --> 01:41:06,395
You know,

2017
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:08,564
you got a lot of people here
who respect you, Robby,

2018
01:41:08,731 --> 01:41:10,524
the work you do.

2019
01:41:11,316 --> 01:41:12,735
That's good to know.

2020
01:41:12,818 --> 01:41:14,570
You know, it's because you
care about this place.

2021
01:41:14,653 --> 01:41:16,655
It's why you do what you do.
It's who you are.

2022
01:41:17,865 --> 01:41:21,243
You know,
but people need the Church,

2023
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:22,536
more than ever right now.

2024
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:24,997
You know, you can feel it.

2025
01:41:25,581 --> 01:41:27,249
And the Cardinal...

2026
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:31,170
You know, the Cardinal,
he might not be perfect,

2027
01:41:32,212 --> 01:41:33,630
but we can't
throw out all the good

2028
01:41:33,714 --> 01:41:35,340
he's doing over
a few bad apples.

2029
01:41:37,426 --> 01:41:39,094
Now, you know,
I'm bringing this up to you

2030
01:41:39,261 --> 01:41:42,890
because I know this is
Baron's idea, his agenda.

2031
01:41:43,265 --> 01:41:44,933
I gotta tell ya,
I mean, honest to God,

2032
01:41:45,017 --> 01:41:47,770
I mean, he doesn't care about
this city the way we do.

2033
01:41:48,437 --> 01:41:49,605
I mean, how could he?

2034
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:59,573
This is how it happens, isn't it, Pete?
What's that?

2035
01:42:00,032 --> 01:42:01,575
A guy leans on a guy,

2036
01:42:01,742 --> 01:42:03,702
and suddenly
the whole town

2037
01:42:03,786 --> 01:42:05,370
just looks
the other way.

2038
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:10,125
Robby. Robby, look it,

2039
01:42:11,543 --> 01:42:14,588
Marty Baron is just
trying to make his mark.

2040
01:42:14,671 --> 01:42:17,299
He's gonna be here for a couple
of years, and he's gonna move on.

2041
01:42:17,382 --> 01:42:19,760
Just like he did in
New York and Miami.

2042
01:42:21,804 --> 01:42:23,639
Where're you gonna go?

2043
01:42:25,307 --> 01:42:26,308
Hmm?

2044
01:42:28,602 --> 01:42:30,729
Good night, Robby.
Brian.

2045
01:42:32,064 --> 01:42:34,566
Hey, Pete.
Yeah?

2046
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:35,901
Uh...

2047
01:42:36,693 --> 01:42:40,989
When we do run the story, uh, I'm gonna
need a comment from the Cardinal.

2048
01:42:43,283 --> 01:42:45,744
We'll talk again later.
Good night, Robby.

2049
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:47,496
Good night, Pete.

2050
01:42:57,798 --> 01:42:59,049
Robby.

2051
01:43:00,592 --> 01:43:01,593
What?

2052
01:43:02,594 --> 01:43:04,680
No shit. When?

2053
01:43:06,682 --> 01:43:08,684
Okay. Yeah.

2054
01:43:11,728 --> 01:43:12,938
Hey!

2055
01:43:13,939 --> 01:43:15,274
What's up?

2056
01:43:16,441 --> 01:43:18,235
Sweeney ruled
in our favor.

2057
01:43:18,735 --> 01:43:20,737
She ruled to unseal
the documents.

2058
01:43:22,489 --> 01:43:23,490
Jeez!

2059
01:43:27,452 --> 01:43:28,972
The Church has already
filed an appeal,

2060
01:43:29,121 --> 01:43:32,124
but the trial court ruling is
generally upheld in these matters.

2061
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:34,668
And when would we
get the documents?

2062
01:43:35,669 --> 01:43:37,921
Probably takes Cohen
a few weeks to rule,

2063
01:43:38,005 --> 01:43:39,381
then there's
a redaction process.

2064
01:43:40,132 --> 01:43:43,385
Uh, I'd say they'd be
made public mid-January.

2065
01:43:44,094 --> 01:43:45,304
Okay.
All right.

2066
01:43:45,387 --> 01:43:46,471
Thanks, Jon.
You bet.

2067
01:43:46,555 --> 01:43:47,764
Nice work.
Thanks.

2068
01:43:48,432 --> 01:43:50,100
Metro should run
something, Marty.

2069
01:43:50,559 --> 01:43:51,894
We can't run
this one big.

2070
01:43:52,686 --> 01:43:55,480
Why wouldn't we?
It's a major First Amendment victory.

2071
01:43:55,647 --> 01:43:56,732
Not to mention,
you get

2072
01:43:56,815 --> 01:43:57,900
an Irish Catholic judge

2073
01:43:58,066 --> 01:43:59,276
ruling against the Church?

2074
01:43:59,443 --> 01:44:01,403
- That's a hell of a precedent.
- Mmm-hmm.

2075
01:44:02,029 --> 01:44:04,072
We don't want the <i>Herald</i>
going deep on this.

2076
01:44:04,907 --> 01:44:05,908
Why's that?

2077
01:44:08,076 --> 01:44:10,203
You're gonna have
to step out, Peter.

2078
01:44:10,287 --> 01:44:11,788
I'm not stepping out.

2079
01:44:20,213 --> 01:44:21,214
Peter.

2080
01:44:35,812 --> 01:44:37,773
When did you, uh...
A couple of weeks ago.

2081
01:44:37,981 --> 01:44:39,483
A couple of weeks?

2082
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:41,234
- Yeah.
- And you're telling us now?

2083
01:44:41,401 --> 01:44:42,986
These are substantial.

2084
01:44:44,112 --> 01:44:46,365
They clearly show
that Law was negligent.

2085
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:49,618
I need more time.
I wanna keep digging.

2086
01:44:49,993 --> 01:44:51,411
For what?
This is the goddamn story.

2087
01:44:51,578 --> 01:44:52,663
It's not
the whole story.

2088
01:44:52,829 --> 01:44:54,498
Tough shit.
We're on a clock now.

2089
01:44:54,831 --> 01:44:55,999
Even if we don't
run Sweeney's ruling,

2090
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:58,293
another paper could find these
letters and fuck the story.

2091
01:44:58,377 --> 01:44:59,461
Agreed.

2092
01:44:59,544 --> 01:45:00,671
But we run
these letters alone,

2093
01:45:00,754 --> 01:45:02,965
Law apologizes,
says it's a one-time thing.

2094
01:45:03,048 --> 01:45:04,049
He can bury it.

2095
01:45:04,257 --> 01:45:07,052
How? These clearly show he
knew and did nothing about it.

2096
01:45:07,135 --> 01:45:10,222
Look, I'm close to
stories on 70 priests.

2097
01:45:10,889 --> 01:45:13,475
We nail that,
along with those letters,

2098
01:45:13,642 --> 01:45:16,395
this is proof
this is bigger than Law.

2099
01:45:17,104 --> 01:45:18,563
It's the whole system.

2100
01:45:19,523 --> 01:45:22,025
You have multiple sources
confirming all those priests?

2101
01:45:22,859 --> 01:45:24,528
On some. I can get more.

2102
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:27,572
Too risky. If we're not buttoned
up on every single one of them,

2103
01:45:27,739 --> 01:45:29,241
the Church will pick us apart.

2104
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:32,160
I think I can get us someone

2105
01:45:32,244 --> 01:45:33,524
from the other
side of the aisle.

2106
01:45:33,996 --> 01:45:35,580
Somebody inside the Church?

2107
01:45:36,498 --> 01:45:37,666
Yeah, a lawyer.

2108
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:39,543
Will he go on the record?

2109
01:45:39,626 --> 01:45:42,587
Deep background.
But he's a solid source.

2110
01:45:46,383 --> 01:45:48,301
Rezendes needs time
to write the story.

2111
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:51,430
We don't wanna drop it at
Christmas, not after 9/11.

2112
01:45:52,806 --> 01:45:54,516
We could run it
just after New Year's,

2113
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:57,310
before they release
the rest of the documents.

2114
01:46:01,023 --> 01:46:02,024
All right.

2115
01:46:03,191 --> 01:46:05,694
Tell Canellos to bury
the ruling in Metro.

2116
01:46:07,571 --> 01:46:08,989
You got six weeks.

2117
01:46:09,823 --> 01:46:11,408
Thank you.

2118
01:46:11,783 --> 01:46:13,785
Tell Mike I want
a draft by Christmas.

2119
01:46:14,369 --> 01:46:16,038
And we need a response
from Lake Street.

2120
01:46:16,204 --> 01:46:18,415
Who does PR for the Cardinal?
Still John Walsh?

2121
01:46:18,582 --> 01:46:20,125
No, somebody new,
Donna Morrisey.

2122
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:21,877
She came from TV.
She's young.

2123
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,045
Good, get a quote.

2124
01:46:23,128 --> 01:46:24,755
We need something from Law
to appear even-handed.

2125
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:27,132
Robby, next time give
me a goddamn heads-up.

2126
01:46:27,299 --> 01:46:28,508
Will do.

2127
01:46:29,593 --> 01:46:35,474
<i>Silent night, holy night.</i>

2128
01:46:37,392 --> 01:46:40,270
<i>All is calm.</i>

2129
01:46:41,354 --> 01:46:43,482
<i>All is bright.</i>

2130
01:46:45,358 --> 01:46:51,907
<i>Round yon virgin,
mother and child.</i>

2131
01:46:53,408 --> 01:47:00,373
<i>Holy infant,
so tender and mild.</i>

2132
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:06,421
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace.</i>

2133
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:13,386
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace.</i>

2134
01:47:15,597 --> 01:47:21,853
<i>Silent night, holy night.</i>

2135
01:47:23,563 --> 01:47:26,858
<i>Shepherds quake.</i>

2136
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:30,737
<i>At the sight.</i>

2137
01:47:31,363 --> 01:47:37,035
<i>Glory streams
from heaven above.</i>

2138
01:47:39,746 --> 01:47:45,085
<i>Heavenly hosts
sing Hallelujah.</i>

2139
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,844
Oh, Robby.
What a nice surprise.

2140
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:56,221
Come on in.

2141
01:48:02,727 --> 01:48:05,397
Hey, hon, look who
I found outside.

2142
01:48:08,567 --> 01:48:09,818
Karen, can you
give us a minute?

2143
01:48:12,154 --> 01:48:13,238
Sure.

2144
01:48:13,864 --> 01:48:14,990
Good to see you, Karen.

2145
01:48:18,076 --> 01:48:19,077
What's up?

2146
01:48:34,593 --> 01:48:36,219
I'm out of time, Jim.

2147
01:48:37,429 --> 01:48:40,223
We've got cover-up
stories on 70 priests,

2148
01:48:40,682 --> 01:48:42,684
but the boss
isn't gonna run it

2149
01:48:42,809 --> 01:48:44,853
unless I get confirmation
from your side.

2150
01:48:47,063 --> 01:48:48,857
Are you out of your mind?

2151
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:51,276
Come on.
This is our town, Jimmy.

2152
01:48:51,693 --> 01:48:55,447
Everybody knew something was going on,
and no one did a thing.

2153
01:48:56,698 --> 01:48:57,738
We gotta put an end to it.

2154
01:48:58,116 --> 01:49:00,118
Don't tell me
what I gotta do.

2155
01:49:00,785 --> 01:49:03,622
Yeah, I helped defend these scumbags,
but that's my job, Robby.

2156
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,957
I was doing my job!

2157
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:08,126
Yeah.

2158
01:49:09,461 --> 01:49:10,921
You and everyone else.

2159
01:49:19,804 --> 01:49:21,306
Get out of my house.

2160
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,401
Hey!

2161
01:49:35,487 --> 01:49:37,906
You come to my home
and lay this shit on me!

2162
01:49:39,157 --> 01:49:40,492
You were right, Robby.

2163
01:49:41,326 --> 01:49:43,453
We all knew somethin'
was going on.

2164
01:49:44,162 --> 01:49:45,622
So where were you?

2165
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:48,333
What took you so long?

2166
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:56,675
I don't know, Jim.

2167
01:50:01,554 --> 01:50:02,722
Give me the list.

2168
01:50:59,487 --> 01:51:01,197
Larry, we're going
to press in six hours.

2169
01:51:01,281 --> 01:51:02,324
Donna Morrisey
said she'd called us

2170
01:51:02,407 --> 01:51:03,647
with a quote
from Law hours ago.

2171
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:05,702
That's what I thought.
When did you talk to her?

2172
01:51:06,202 --> 01:51:07,537
Okay, okay, Larry.

2173
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:09,956
Yeah. Yeah, that's
good to know.

2174
01:51:10,582 --> 01:51:12,334
Thanks, Pete.
Anything?

2175
01:51:12,917 --> 01:51:15,757
Conley said Donna Morrisey should have
called, he just left Lake Street.

2176
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,839
Yeah, Rasky said
the same thing.

2177
01:51:17,922 --> 01:51:19,924
This is ridiculous. You'd think
they'd wanna get ahead of this.

2178
01:51:20,008 --> 01:51:21,634
I mean, they'd be
idiots not to.

2179
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:25,388
I would love to see their faces
when they read this thing then.

2180
01:51:25,555 --> 01:51:27,557
You know, Sunday's the
feast of the Epiphany.

2181
01:51:28,224 --> 01:51:30,435
It seems appropriate.

2182
01:51:35,857 --> 01:51:36,858
Mike Rezendes.

2183
01:51:38,818 --> 01:51:41,237
Hey, Donna.
Thanks for calling.

2184
01:51:41,321 --> 01:51:44,282
Yeah, I just had a few questions
if you have a minute.

2185
01:51:46,201 --> 01:51:47,202
What?

2186
01:51:48,828 --> 01:51:50,997
What?
Another adjective.

2187
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,793
Anything?
Law just turned us down.

2188
01:51:54,959 --> 01:51:56,294
Jesus Christ.

2189
01:51:56,461 --> 01:51:58,004
I just got off the phone
with Donna Morrisey.

2190
01:51:58,088 --> 01:52:00,423
She said, quote,
we don't even want to know

2191
01:52:00,507 --> 01:52:01,827
what the questions are,
end quote.

2192
01:52:01,966 --> 01:52:03,885
She really said that?
Yeah.

2193
01:52:04,135 --> 01:52:05,136
Well, that oughta do it.

2194
01:52:05,303 --> 01:52:06,679
"The Church
had no interest"

2195
01:52:06,846 --> 01:52:09,849
"in knowing what the <i>Globe's</i>
questions would be."

2196
01:52:11,184 --> 01:52:13,520
Work it in somewhere before the jump.
Anything else?

2197
01:52:13,978 --> 01:52:15,730
Uh, Matt wants to put
the letters online,

2198
01:52:15,814 --> 01:52:17,315
so the readers can
see for themselves.

2199
01:52:17,774 --> 01:52:19,776
We can run the URL at the
bottom of the article.

2200
01:52:19,943 --> 01:52:21,736
It's pretty straightforward.
Okay.

2201
01:52:21,903 --> 01:52:23,988
We also put the Spotlight tip
line at the end of the story

2202
01:52:24,155 --> 01:52:25,365
so people can call in.

2203
01:52:25,448 --> 01:52:26,741
Goes directly to our office.

2204
01:52:26,991 --> 01:52:29,160
Matt and I can go in in the
morning in case we get any calls.

2205
01:52:29,327 --> 01:52:31,487
Yeah, I'm more concerned about
the phones at reception.

2206
01:52:31,579 --> 01:52:32,747
After we ran
the Porter case,

2207
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:34,666
the message centers
were tied up for weeks.

2208
01:52:34,833 --> 01:52:36,673
It's a real problem.
There were picketers, too.

2209
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,044
Lots of 'em.

2210
01:52:38,128 --> 01:52:40,547
I'll talk to Richard about
the security and the phones.

2211
01:52:40,797 --> 01:52:43,216
Uh, how are we coming
on the folo story?

2212
01:52:44,175 --> 01:52:45,593
Well, we've nailed
down multiple stories

2213
01:52:45,677 --> 01:52:46,678
on 70 priests.

2214
01:52:47,887 --> 01:52:49,180
- All 70?
- Mmm-hmm.

2215
01:52:49,597 --> 01:52:52,157
And with the confirmation from
Robby's source, we're ready to go.

2216
01:52:52,308 --> 01:52:53,468
We can have
a draft next week.

2217
01:52:53,518 --> 01:52:56,104
Uh, Robby, that
source of yours,

2218
01:52:56,187 --> 01:52:57,467
is it something
we could revisit?

2219
01:52:59,983 --> 01:53:01,151
He might be tough.

2220
01:53:01,234 --> 01:53:02,794
But he has no problem
helping the Church

2221
01:53:02,902 --> 01:53:04,446
protect dozens
of dirty priests.

2222
01:53:04,612 --> 01:53:07,240
Guy's a scumbag.
He's a lawyer, he's doing his job.

2223
01:53:07,407 --> 01:53:08,533
He's a shill
for the Church.

2224
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:09,826
He knew
and did nothing.

2225
01:53:09,993 --> 01:53:12,328
He could've said something years ago.
Maybe saved some lives.

2226
01:53:12,412 --> 01:53:13,663
What about us?

2227
01:53:15,123 --> 01:53:16,291
What's that
supposed to mean?

2228
01:53:16,666 --> 01:53:18,793
We had all the pieces.

2229
01:53:18,877 --> 01:53:19,997
Why didn't we get it sooner?

2230
01:53:20,295 --> 01:53:21,296
We didn't have
all the pieces.

2231
01:53:21,463 --> 01:53:24,466
We had Saviano,
we had Barrett, we had Geoghan.

2232
01:53:24,549 --> 01:53:26,069
We had the directories
in the basement.

2233
01:53:26,384 --> 01:53:27,504
You know what?
We got it now.

2234
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:29,637
Robby, the story
needed Spotlight.

2235
01:53:30,472 --> 01:53:32,807
Mike, Spotlight's
been around since 1970.

2236
01:53:33,057 --> 01:53:36,186
So what? We couldn't see the scope of this.
No one could.

2237
01:53:36,269 --> 01:53:38,438
Robby, this started
with one goddamn priest.

2238
01:53:41,232 --> 01:53:43,943
Macleish sent us a letter
on 20 priests, years ago.

2239
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:45,820
Sacha found the clip.

2240
01:53:46,571 --> 01:53:48,031
You freaking kidding me?
20 priests?

2241
01:53:48,656 --> 01:53:49,699
When?

2242
01:53:51,242 --> 01:53:53,786
Uh, just after Porter.
December '93.

2243
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:56,372
We buried the story
in Metro. No folo.

2244
01:53:57,790 --> 01:53:59,125
That was you.

2245
01:54:01,127 --> 01:54:02,253
You were Metro.

2246
01:54:03,421 --> 01:54:05,423
Yeah. That was me.

2247
01:54:06,299 --> 01:54:08,718
I'd just taken over.
I don't remember it at all.

2248
01:54:10,261 --> 01:54:11,596
But yeah...

2249
01:54:15,099 --> 01:54:16,476
Um...

2250
01:54:16,559 --> 01:54:19,062
Can I say something here?

2251
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:22,273
Sometimes it's
easy to forget

2252
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:25,193
that we spend most of our time
stumbling around in the dark.

2253
01:54:26,361 --> 01:54:28,196
Suddenly a light
gets turned on,

2254
01:54:28,279 --> 01:54:30,657
and there's a fair share
of blame to go around.

2255
01:54:32,784 --> 01:54:35,078
I can't speak to what
happened before I arrived,

2256
01:54:36,871 --> 01:54:39,541
but, um, all of you have done
some very good reporting here.

2257
01:54:40,458 --> 01:54:43,461
Reporting that I believe
is gonna have an immediate

2258
01:54:43,795 --> 01:54:46,798
and considerable
impact on our readers.

2259
01:54:48,258 --> 01:54:51,511
For me, this kind of story
is why we do this.

2260
01:54:52,262 --> 01:54:55,223
Having said that, Cardinal Law
and the Catholic community

2261
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:57,642
are gonna have a very
strong response to this.

2262
01:54:58,977 --> 01:55:00,979
So if you need a moment,

2263
01:55:02,021 --> 01:55:03,022
you've earned it.

2264
01:55:05,358 --> 01:55:07,485
But I will need you
back here Monday morning

2265
01:55:07,569 --> 01:55:10,989
focused and ready
to do your job.

2266
01:55:19,205 --> 01:55:20,206
Leaving?

2267
01:55:21,082 --> 01:55:22,083
Yeah.

2268
01:55:27,839 --> 01:55:30,258
I, uh, just got a call
from the Cardinal.

2269
01:55:30,675 --> 01:55:32,510
Really. Why?

2270
01:55:32,594 --> 01:55:33,970
He wanted to
tell me personally

2271
01:55:34,095 --> 01:55:35,430
that he decided
not to comment.

2272
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:40,685
Yeah, said he wanted to
extend me that courtesy.

2273
01:55:40,852 --> 01:55:43,605
Jesus, the balls on that guy.
What did you say?

2274
01:55:44,355 --> 01:55:45,982
I told him he was
making a mistake,

2275
01:55:46,065 --> 01:55:47,734
and that we were
gonna run the story.

2276
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:49,527
Damn right we're
gonna run it.

2277
01:56:14,552 --> 01:56:16,429
Sacha, can I have
a drink of water?

2278
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:20,016
Yeah. Sure, Nana. Yeah.

2279
01:56:31,277 --> 01:56:32,612
Can I keep this?

2280
01:56:34,113 --> 01:56:35,239
Sure.

2281
01:56:36,074 --> 01:56:37,825
I thought you
should see it first.

2282
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:39,452
Thank you for
bringing it by.

2283
01:56:42,413 --> 01:56:44,916
I have some clients
I have to attend to.

2284
01:57:02,975 --> 01:57:04,644
Both kids were abused.

2285
01:57:05,186 --> 01:57:07,188
Jamaica Plain.
Two weeks ago.

2286
01:57:09,190 --> 01:57:12,860
Keep doing your work,
Mr. Rezendes.

2287
01:57:14,779 --> 01:57:16,614
- Hello.
- Hello.

2288
01:57:16,781 --> 01:57:19,200
How are you guys doing?
We're good.

2289
01:57:19,659 --> 01:57:20,660
Good.

2290
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:09,542
Hey.
Morning.

2291
01:58:10,293 --> 01:58:11,461
How'd you sleep?

2292
01:58:12,295 --> 01:58:13,838
Not very well. You?

2293
01:58:14,046 --> 01:58:15,882
I haven't slept well for months.
Mmm.

2294
01:58:17,508 --> 01:58:19,886
Oh, thanks.
I actually started writing.

2295
01:58:20,678 --> 01:58:22,805
Writing?
Yeah, I've been working on a book.

2296
01:58:22,889 --> 01:58:24,682
Gives me something
else to focus on.

2297
01:58:24,849 --> 01:58:26,058
What kind of book?

2298
01:58:26,350 --> 01:58:27,894
Horror.

2299
01:58:34,692 --> 01:58:35,735
Spotlight.

2300
01:58:37,153 --> 01:58:39,447
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

2301
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:40,990
Can I get your
name, please?

2302
01:58:57,673 --> 01:58:59,091
You do know
it's Sunday, right?

2303
01:58:59,258 --> 01:59:00,885
I couldn't get
a tee time.

2304
01:59:03,888 --> 01:59:05,765
No picketers.
Yeah.

2305
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:08,184
Probably still at church.

2306
01:59:10,561 --> 01:59:11,938
Hey, Linda.

2307
01:59:12,188 --> 01:59:13,272
It's quiet, huh?

2308
01:59:13,356 --> 01:59:15,775
Yeah, easiest
overtime I ever made.

2309
01:59:15,858 --> 01:59:16,901
Phone hasn't rung once.

2310
01:59:17,401 --> 01:59:19,445
Marty sent two of mine
down to Spotlight.

2311
01:59:23,241 --> 01:59:25,076
- Great article, guys.
- Thank you.

2312
01:59:25,743 --> 01:59:26,911
Spotlight?

2313
01:59:50,476 --> 01:59:52,186
Okay. Send him over.

2314
01:59:52,270 --> 01:59:53,396
Spotlight,
can I help you?

2315
01:59:53,479 --> 01:59:54,939
Phones have been
ringing all morning.

2316
01:59:57,775 --> 01:59:59,402
Mike, can you grab that?
Yeah, yeah.

2317
02:00:00,736 --> 02:00:02,738
They're almost
all victims, Robby.

2318
02:00:05,157 --> 02:00:06,659
I'm sorry
to make you wait.

2319
02:00:09,996 --> 02:00:11,330
It's very tough to
talk about, I know...

2320
02:00:11,497 --> 02:00:13,082
Yes, you can
reach me here...

2321
02:00:13,958 --> 02:00:15,293
This is Spotlight.

2322
02:00:30,808 --> 02:00:31,934
Spotlight.
