1
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,959
How are you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,521
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,202
...Keyser.

4
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:40,283
Ready?

5
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:53,086
What time is it?

6
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,607
Twelve thirty.

7
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:00,903
It all started in New York
six weeks ago.

8
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:04,784
A truck loaded with stripped gun
parts got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:07,104
The driver didn't see anybody
but somebody fucked up.

10
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:10,025
He heard a voice.
Sometimes, that's all you need.

11
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:14,386
Mr. McManus?

12
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:17,507
Christ! Don't you fucking
guys ever sleep?

13
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:18,867
We have a warrant for your arrest.

14
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,347
Fuck you!

15
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:29,310
Todd Hockney?

16
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,030
Who wants to know?

17
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,671
New York Police Department.

18
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:38,152
Shit.

19
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:39,952
Freeze!

20
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:46,834
Sure you brought enough guys?

21
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:24,883
It's quite simple, really. A restaurant
that changes with the taste...

22
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,284
without losing the overall aesthetic.

23
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:31,205
In other words, the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls.

24
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:34,366
Well, let me give you an example...

25
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,286
This I had to see for myself.

26
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:39,767
David.

27
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,128
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

28
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:46,609
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

29
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:49,329
Special Agent Kujan. U.S. Customs.

30
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,130
These gentlemen are from the
New York Police Department.

31
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,051
You look good, Keaton.

32
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,491
Better that I would have thought.

33
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:57,291
You have a problem, Mr. Keaton?

34
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:00,892
Small matter of a stolen
truck loaded with guns.

35
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:04,333
Mr. Keaton?

36
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,174
Would you excuse us for a moment?

37
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:11,935
We have some questions
to ask you downtown.

38
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:17,096
No, no, please... sit down.
This is...

39
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:19,577
This is a small problem.

40
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:21,217
Enjoy the meal.

41
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:46,143
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

42
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:48,824
I mean, these guys were hardcore hijackers...

43
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:51,265
...but there I was.

44
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:55,306
At that point I wasn't scared.

45
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:58,066
I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.

46
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,267
Besides, it was fun.

47
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,468
I got to make like I was notorious.

48
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:06,188
Allright, you all know the drill.

49
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:09,429
When your number is called,
step forward and repeat the phrase...

50
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:10,669
...you've been given.
Understand?

51
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,630
Number 1...

52
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,030
...step forward.

53
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:19,712
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

54
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:23,713
Number 2, step forward.

55
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:29,954
Gimme the fucking keys, you
fucking cocksucker motherfucker--!

56
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:31,514
Knock it off! Get back!

57
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:33,435
Number 3, step forward.

58
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,557
Hand me the keys,
you cocksucker.

59
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,238
In english, please.

60
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:46,958
Excuse me?

61
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:48,639
In english.

62
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,920
Hand me the fucking keys,
you cocksucker, what the fuck...

63
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,040
Number 4, step forward.

64
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,161
It was bullshit.
The whole wrap was a set-up.

65
00:08:57,361 --> 00:09:00,041
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

66
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:01,962
It was all the cops' fault.

67
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:04,443
You don't put guys like that
into a room together.

68
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,683
Who knows what can happen.

69
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:10,644
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

70
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:12,805
This has really got to be...

71
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:14,405
...embarrassing for you guys.

72
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:15,685
They drilled us all night.

73
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:19,046
Somebody was pissed about that truck
getting hijacked, and the cops had nothing.

74
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:21,927
They were hoping somebody would
slip up and give them something to go on.

75
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:24,848
They knew we wouldn't fight it
because they knew how to lean on us.

76
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:26,208
They'd been doing it forever.

77
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:29,929
I mean, our rights went out the window.
It was a violation. I mean, disgraceful.

78
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:31,129
They went after McManus first.

79
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:32,770
Top-notch entry man.

80
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,010
What truck?

81
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,450
The truck with the guns, fucko.

82
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,691
Fucko? Brrr...

83
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:42,852
He was a good guy.
Crazy, though.

84
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,772
Wanna know what your
buddy Fenster told us?

85
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:45,933
Who?

86
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,453
McManus. He told us
another story altogether.

87
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:52,094
Oh, that one about the
hooker with dysentery.

88
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:53,735
Fenster always worked
with McManus.

89
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:55,695
He was a real tight-ass...

90
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,096
...but when it came to the job,
he was right on. A smart man.

91
00:09:58,776 --> 00:09:59,736
What are you saying?

92
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:01,097
I say he'll flip you.

93
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:02,937
- He what?
- Flip you.

94
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:05,658
- Flip you for real.
- Yeah, I'm shaking. C'mon.

95
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:07,018
Answer my question.

96
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:08,538
Can you hear me
in the back?

97
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,019
Hello? I want...

98
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,500
...my lawyer.

99
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,180
I'm gonna have your
fucking badge, cocksucker.

100
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,221
Todd Hockney.
Good with explosives.

101
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:22,822
Without a doubt, a one guy who
didn't give a fuck about anybody.

102
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,182
You guys don't have a
fucking leg to stand on.

103
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:26,583
You think so,
tough guy?

104
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:28,983
I could put you in Queens
on the night of the hijacking.

105
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:30,184
Really?

106
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:31,944
I live in Queens.

107
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:34,385
Did you... put that together
yourself, Einstein?

108
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:36,785
What've you got, a team of monkeys
working around the clock on this?

109
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:39,546
You know what happens if you
do another turn in the joint?

110
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,067
Fuck your father in the shower
and then have a snack.

111
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:45,868
You gonna charge me,
dickhead?

112
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,348
I'll charge you
when I'm ready.

113
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:48,428
With what?

114
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:50,109
You know damn well,
dead-man.

115
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:53,869
But Keaton... Keaton was the real
prize for them, for obvious reasons.

116
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,310
It was your mistake,
not mine.

117
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:01,111
Did you ever
stop to ask me?

118
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:06,513
I mean, I've been working around
with the same face, the same name.

119
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:09,153
I'm a businessman.

120
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:11,074
Yeah, what's that?
The restaurant business?

121
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:15,035
No, from now on, you're in the
"getting-fucked-by-us" business.

122
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:17,475
I'm gonna make you
famous, cocksucker.

123
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:18,916
Like I said...

124
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:21,316
...it was your mistake.

125
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:22,997
Not mine.

126
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:25,637
Now you charge me
with this shit...

127
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:27,958
...and I'll beat it.

128
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,639
Ok?

129
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,439
Let's get back to that
truck, asshole.

130
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,441
So I did a little time...

131
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:43,602
...does that mean I get
railed every time...

132
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:45,842
...a truck finds its way
off the planet?

133
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,203
Fuck them!

134
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,323
Fenster, will you relax?

135
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:51,524
These guys don't have
any probable cause.

136
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:53,444
You're fucking A-right. No P.C. ...

137
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:55,045
No goddamn right.

138
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:56,885
You do some time,
they never let you go.

139
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,885
You know, treat me
like a criminal...

140
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,246
...I'll end up a criminal.

141
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,606
You are a criminal!

142
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:05,687
Hey, why you gotta
go and do that?

143
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:07,768
I'm trying to make a point.

144
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,648
Oh, why don't you
make your point.

145
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:12,129
You're making me
tired all over.

146
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,809
Oh, fuck it then.

147
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:16,050
- I heard you were dead.
- Oh yeah?

148
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,570
Well, you heard right.

149
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,411
The word I got is you
hung up your spurs, man.

150
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,051
What's that all about?

151
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,291
What's this?

152
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:24,812
Rumor has it,
Keaton's gone straight.

153
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,412
I hear he's tapping
Edie Finneran.

154
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,573
Who is that?

155
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,973
She's a heavy-weight
criminal lawyer from uptown.

156
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:32,734
I hear she's Keaton's
meal ticket.

157
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,614
How 'bout it, Keaton?

158
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,735
You a lawyer's wife?

159
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:39,375
What kind of "retainer"
you giving her?

160
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:44,417
Hey, Fenster.
Do your friend a favor...

161
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,937
Tell him to keep quiet.

162
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:49,458
Dean Keaton...

163
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:52,259
...gone clean, huh?

164
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,459
Say it ain't so.

165
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,460
Was it you that
hit that truck?

166
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,860
Forget him.

167
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,660
You got to talk
to your lawyer?

168
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,861
This whole thing
was a shakedown.

169
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:04,462
What makes you say that?

170
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:06,262
How many times have
you been to a line-up?

171
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:09,423
It's always you
and four dummies.

172
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:12,784
P.D. are paying homeless guys
ten bucks a head half the time.

173
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:16,104
And there's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row. No way!

174
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,145
And what's a
voice line-up?

175
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:19,785
A Public Defender could
get you out of that one.

176
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:21,546
So why the hell was I
strip-searched?

177
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:23,226
It was the Feds.

178
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,507
A truckload of guns
gets snagged...

179
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:29,548
...Customs comes down to N.Y.P.D. looking
for answers - they come up with us.

180
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:30,828
They are clutching
at straws.

181
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:32,789
Ah, the guys fingered
my asshole tonight.

182
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:34,149
Is it Friday already?

183
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:37,350
Yeah, lover-boy.

184
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,030
You want a piece?
Something, I love you.

185
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,111
So who in the goddamn place...

186
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:43,791
...stole the fucking truck?

187
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:46,232
What did you say?

188
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:47,912
Who stole the fucking truck!

189
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:49,393
I don't want to know.

190
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,153
Who asked you,
working man?

191
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:53,674
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is who's the gimp.

192
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,674
He's ok.

193
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:57,755
Says you. How do I know that? What
about it, Pretzel-man? What's your story?

194
00:13:58,035 --> 00:13:59,355
His name is Verbal.

195
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:01,356
Verbal Kint.

196
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:02,356
Verbal?

197
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:05,997
Roger, really.
People say I talk too much.

198
00:14:06,237 --> 00:14:07,957
Yeah, I was just going
to tell you to shut up.

199
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:09,878
We've met before
once or twice.

200
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:11,558
In county. I was in for fraud.

201
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:13,879
You were in the line-up
then, too. What happened?

202
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,919
I walked.

203
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:16,919
Ninety days,
suspended.

204
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,000
So you did it!

205
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,640
All right, now look...

206
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,321
We've all been put out by
this whole thing, right?

207
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:26,922
So I figure we owe it to
ourselves to salvage a little dignity

208
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:29,002
Now...

209
00:14:29,563 --> 00:14:31,043
...me and Fenster heard
about a little job.

210
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:32,923
Why don't you just
calm down?

211
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:35,044
Why do you care
what he has to say?

212
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,765
I'm just talking here.

213
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:41,325
And it seems to me like Mr. Hockney
wants to hear what I got to say...

214
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,086
...and I know Fenster's down.

215
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:45,526
What about you guy?

216
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,487
I'm interested, sure.

217
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:50,888
There, see?

218
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:54,089
So now I'd like to exercise
my right to free assembly.

219
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:56,089
Why don't you just shut up?

220
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:03,411
You're missing the point.

221
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,812
No...
YOU're missing the point.

222
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,613
I don't want to hear
anything from you.

223
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,893
I don't care
about your job.

224
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:19,975
And... I want nothing
to do with any of you.

225
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:22,335
I beg your pardon...

226
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,016
...but you can all
go to hell.

227
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:27,737
Dean Keaton...

228
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:29,977
...gone the high road.

229
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:33,298
What is the world coming to?

230
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,300
Fuck him.

231
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:45,501
And that was how it started.

232
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:49,542
The five of us being brought in on a trumped-up
charge to be leaned on by half-wits.

233
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:55,224
Ok, now I really can't talk
about it much here...

234
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:58,704
What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now...

235
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:02,065
...was that these men would
never break, never lie down...

236
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:04,786
...never bend over for anybody...

237
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:07,106
...anybody.

238
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,830
Who are you?

239
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:26,431
Agent Jack Baer, FBI.
How many dead?

240
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:29,752
15 so far. They're still pulling some
bodies out of the water, though.

241
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:31,312
Any survivors?

242
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:32,433
Yeah, there's two.

243
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:35,834
One guy is in county hospital, but he's
in a coma. The D.A. has the second guy...

244
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:38,074
...a cripple from New York, I think.

245
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:40,475
Listen, the chief wants
this place sealed off.

246
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,635
If you have any questions,
give him a call--

247
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:19,324
This is Dave Kujan. I'll be in
Los Angeles until tuesday.

248
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:21,445
If you need to reach me, contact...

249
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:24,886
...Jeff Rabin at the
San Pedro P.D., at extension 112.

250
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,166
Have a nice day.

251
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:32,167
- Why can't I see him?
- Dave, I told you...

252
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:35,128
...the D.A. came down here last night...

253
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:37,289
...ready to arraign even before
they moved him to county. Ok?

254
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:39,529
Kint's lawer shows up five minutes later...

255
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:42,890
...D.A. comes out of the office looking like
the boogey man smacked him around.

256
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,971
Allright? They take the statement
and they cut him a deal.

257
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:47,371
What? Did they charge
him with anything?

258
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:48,611
Yeah, weapons.

259
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:50,212
Misdemeanor two.

260
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:51,532
What is that?

261
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:55,693
Listen, I give the D.A. credit for
getting that much, you understand?

262
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:56,933
Excuse me.

263
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,494
This whole thing
has turned political.

264
00:18:00,694 --> 00:18:03,135
The Major was here last night. The chief.
This morning...

265
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:05,336
...the Governor called, ok?

266
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:09,497
I'm telling you this guy is protected from
up on high by the prince of darkness.

267
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:10,577
Take my word for it.

268
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:11,937
When does he post bail?

269
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:13,137
Maybe two hours, tops.

270
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:14,258
I want to see him.

271
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,018
- No, Dave.
- I gotta see him, Jeffrey.

272
00:18:16,218 --> 00:18:18,699
Dave, no!
I can not do this for you.

273
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,059
I came a long way for this.

274
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,940
Dave, please.

275
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:29,221
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

276
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:32,342
He's paranoid about
being recorded.

277
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:33,983
He knows the interrogation
rooms are wired.

278
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:34,943
This won't be an interrogation...

279
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,984
...just a friendly chat
to kill some time.

280
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:40,024
He will not go into
the interrogation room.

281
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:41,985
- Just someplace else, then.
- Where?

282
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:46,906
If this was a dope deal,
where's the dope?

283
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:48,986
If it was a hit,
who called it in?

284
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:52,867
I'm sure you have a host of wild
theories to answer all these questions.

285
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:54,668
- You know damn well what I think.
- That's crazy.

286
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:55,788
And besides, it doesn't even matter...

287
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:58,669
...the guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

288
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:00,509
He doesn't know what
you want to know.

289
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:02,990
I don't think he does.
Not exactly.

290
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,950
But there's a lot more
to his story, believe me.

291
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:09,631
Jeffrey, look... I want to know why
27 men died on that pier...

292
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:13,552
...for what looks to be 91 million dollars
worth of dope that wasn't there.

293
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:15,433
And above all...

294
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,433
...I want to be sure
Dean Keaton is dead.

295
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:18,794
He's dead.

296
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:20,634
C'mon, two hours.

297
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:22,114
Just 'till he makes bail.

298
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,195
They're all dead.

299
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:26,275
I don't care how tough a guy
you say this Keaton was...

300
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:28,916
...nobody on that boat
could have come out alive.

301
00:19:32,477 --> 00:19:33,277
Is he talking?

302
00:19:33,477 --> 00:19:36,078
He regained consciousness
less than an hour ago...

303
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:37,598
...he spoke, not english...
then he lapsed.

304
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:39,919
- Hungarian?
- I don't know. I think that may have been what it was.

305
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,479
Yeah, most of them
were hungarians.

306
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,399
You've got to put on these.

307
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,920
Burn victims are very
succeptible to infections.

308
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,881
And, of course,
there is no smoking.

309
00:19:57,883 --> 00:19:59,964
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

310
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:00,924
Is he gonna die?

311
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:03,725
He has burns over 60% of his body,
a number of his ribs are broken--

312
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,125
Call Hospital Security.

313
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:06,685
Get a man. Put him on the door
until the police get here.

314
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:07,806
Is he dangerous?

315
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,006
Yes!

316
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:10,206
Do it!

317
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:11,166
Do it now!

318
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:15,848
Joel?

319
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:17,568
Yeah, Baer, down
at L.A. County.

320
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:21,289
Look, the guy they pulled out
of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

321
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:23,209
Yes!
Yes, I'm sure.

322
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,250
No, no, he's all fucked-up.
What?

323
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,211
I can't hear you.

324
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:31,051
Shut up! I'm on the phone!

325
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:32,812
Yes.

326
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,332
Well, no. Not--

327
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,373
Just send me someone
who can speak Hungarian.

328
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:39,734
Yeah! He's awake and
talking like a Thai hooker.

329
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:42,214
No, just somebody who--

330
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:43,815
What?

331
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:50,936
No shit!

332
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:55,537
Joel. Yeah, call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

333
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:58,138
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

334
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:33,347
Verbal, this is Agent
Kujan, from Customs.

335
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:35,507
Nice to meet you.

336
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:38,188
He wants to ask you a few
questions before you go.

337
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:39,508
What about?

338
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:41,549
About Dean Keaton mostly.

339
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:44,950
But I'd like to start at the
line-up back in New York.

340
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,230
Can I get some coffee?

341
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,430
I a while.
Let's talk about the line-up.

342
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,871
I'm really thirsty.

343
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:51,911
I used to dehydrate
as a kid.

344
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:53,952
One time I got so bad,
my piss came out like snot...

345
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:55,272
...I'm not kidding--

346
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:56,953
I'll get your fucking coffee.

347
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,673
Get me one too
while you're at it.

348
00:22:03,914 --> 00:22:05,435
That guy is tense.

349
00:22:05,795 --> 00:22:07,115
Tension is a killer.

350
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:10,236
I used to be in a barber shop
quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

351
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:12,196
...the bariton was this guy named Kip Diskin.

352
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:14,197
Big, fat guy.
I mean, like orca-fat.

353
00:22:14,397 --> 00:22:15,717
He was so stressed
in the morning--

354
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,838
Verbal, you know we're
trying to help you.

355
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:19,678
Sure. And I
appreciate that.

356
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:21,599
And I want to help
you, Agent Kujan.

357
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,879
I like cops.

358
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,319
I would have liked to be a
Fed myself, but my C.P. always--

359
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,440
Verbal, you're not
telling us everything.

360
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,240
I know you
know something.

361
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:31,321
I told the D.A.
everything I know.

362
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:34,162
Verbal...

363
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:37,763
...I know you like Keaton.
I know you think he's a good man.

364
00:22:38,203 --> 00:22:39,403
I know he was good.

365
00:22:39,643 --> 00:22:40,843
He was a corrupt cop.

366
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:43,684
Sure, 15 years ago.
But he was a good thief.

367
00:22:44,484 --> 00:22:46,205
Anyway, the cops wouldn't
let him go legit.

368
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:48,125
Dean Keaton was
a piece of shit.

369
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:53,766
Are you trying to get a rise
out of me, Agent Kujan?

370
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,167
I just want to hear
your story.

371
00:22:56,447 --> 00:22:57,567
It's all there.

372
00:22:58,568 --> 00:22:59,568
May I have a cigarette?

373
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:04,929
- According to your statement--
- I need a light.

374
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,931
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

375
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:20,533
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

376
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:23,614
Run of the mill scams.

377
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:25,894
That's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

378
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:26,735
Oh, I know.

379
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:29,455
Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

380
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,616
Well, I do have the
weapons charge.

381
00:23:33,816 --> 00:23:35,857
I'm looking at six whole
months hard time.

382
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:37,897
You know a dealer named
Ruby Deemer, Verbal?

383
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,298
You know a religious
guy named John Paul?

384
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:42,658
You know Ruby is in Attica?

385
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:44,379
He didn't have my lawyer.

386
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:45,539
I know Ruby.
He's big on respect.

387
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,340
He's good friend of mine.
Likes me very much.

388
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,580
Now, I know your
testimony is sealed.

389
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,941
Ruby's well connected.
He's got a lot of friends inside...

390
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,221
...do a lot of favors for him.

391
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:58,102
What do you think he would say if he found
out you dropped his name to the D.A.?

392
00:23:58,462 --> 00:23:59,943
There's nothing in
there about Ruby.

393
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:01,703
I'll be sure to mention
that to him.

394
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:04,584
First thing on the job, you know what I learned?
How to spot a murderer.

395
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:05,864
Let's say you arrest 3 guys...

396
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,185
...for the same killing.

397
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:10,705
You put them all in jail overnight. The next
morning, whoever is sleeping is your man.

398
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:13,066
You see, if you're guilty and you know
you're caught, you get some rest...

399
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:15,186
...you let your guard down.
You follow me?

400
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,187
No.

401
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,107
Let me get right to the point.

402
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:21,388
I'm smarter than you.

403
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:24,349
And I'm gonna find out
what I wanna know.

404
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,349
And I'm gonna get it from
you wether you like it or not.

405
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,910
I'm not a rat.

406
00:24:34,991 --> 00:24:36,592
Thanks.

407
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:43,914
Back when I was picking beans in Guatemala,
we used to make fresh coffee.

408
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:45,634
Right off the trees,
I mean.

409
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:46,674
That was good.

410
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:47,835
This is shit.

411
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:48,915
But, hey,
I'm in a police station--

412
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,475
Can we get started again?

413
00:24:50,915 --> 00:24:52,956
Now, what happened
after the line-up?

414
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:01,318
...the Desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell
me that they he couldn't release you.

415
00:25:01,518 --> 00:25:04,199
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged!

416
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,839
New York Police!

417
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,800
You know, I want to have
pictures taken of your face...

418
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,801
...take them to the D.A.'s office
first thing tomorrow morning.

419
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:13,801
Just forget about it.

420
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:16,402
Absolutely not! I'm gonna have this thing
in front of the grand jury by Monday.

421
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,562
Look, I don't want to
talk about it, Edie. Ok?

422
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:23,123
So what did Fortier
and Renault say?

423
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:25,804
They asked for some more time
to think about the restaurant.

424
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:27,684
They just want more time! It's ok...

425
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:28,965
More time for what, Edie?

426
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,686
No matter how you cover my tracks,
they're still going to find out about me.

427
00:25:33,246 --> 00:25:34,486
Give me some credit.

428
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,286
I got you this far.

429
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:38,927
Let's go to the grand jury.
You know, this isn't going to stop if we--

430
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,008
It's never going to stop. Period.

431
00:25:41,928 --> 00:25:45,129
By next week, every investor in this city
is going to be walking away from us.

432
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:48,329
It's finished.

433
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,170
I'm finished.

434
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:57,692
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

435
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:01,453
It's never going to stop.

436
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:09,855
I love you.

437
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:13,175
They ruined me in there tonight.

438
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:16,296
I love you.

439
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:19,177
Do you hear me?

440
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:26,939
What?

441
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,460
All right.

442
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,380
Let's just go to my place.

443
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:50,065
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

444
00:26:58,427 --> 00:27:01,267
Fenster and McManus had a cagey proposition.

445
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:03,748
A fast jump. High risk.
Long money.

446
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:05,508
We all knew it could be done.

447
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,389
The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.

448
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:10,870
To do it right took five men.

449
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,670
Five men meant Keaton.

450
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,911
Keaton took convincing.

451
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:19,952
New York finest taxi service.

452
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:22,192
Bullshit!

453
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:27,154
They don't operate anymore.

454
00:27:27,794 --> 00:27:31,595
McManus has a friend in the 14th Precinct.
They're coming out for one job - Thursday.

455
00:27:31,795 --> 00:27:34,235
They are picking up a guy smuggling
emeralds out of South America.

456
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:36,276
McManus already has a fence
set to take the stuff.

457
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:37,276
A fence? Who?

458
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:39,077
Some guy in California.
His name is Redfoot.

459
00:27:39,277 --> 00:27:40,517
I never heard of him.

460
00:27:40,957 --> 00:27:41,997
You have to come.

461
00:27:42,197 --> 00:27:43,558
What's it to you
wether I do it not?

462
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:46,518
They--
They don't know me. You do.

463
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,759
They won't take me
unless you go.

464
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:50,920
Look at me.
I need this.

465
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,800
Oh, are you telling me
you don't need this?

466
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,321
Is this your place?

467
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:58,801
I'm not knocking you, you look like you've got
a good little scam going on with this lawyer--

468
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:04,443
Sorry.

469
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,204
It's ok.

470
00:28:08,524 --> 00:28:10,564
You say it's the real thing?
That's cool.

471
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:14,525
You're ok?

472
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:16,486
I was out of line.

473
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:19,687
But they're never going to stop
with us, you know that.

474
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,767
As clean as you could ever get,
they'll never let you go now.

475
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:26,328
This way we hit the cops where it
hurts and we get well in the mean time.

476
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:31,970
You sure you're ok?

477
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,890
I'll be all right.

478
00:28:48,054 --> 00:28:49,254
Look, I...

479
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:51,895
- ...sometimes get--
- Forget it.

480
00:28:55,695 --> 00:28:57,576
I probably shit blood tonight.

481
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,740
So, how do they want to do it?

482
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,981
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

483
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:21,542
Fenster?
Hockney?

484
00:29:21,902 --> 00:29:24,062
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

485
00:29:24,943 --> 00:29:27,543
Now, I've got a way of doing
it without killing anyone.

486
00:29:27,743 --> 00:29:29,584
But, as I said, they won't
let me in without you.

487
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:48,668
Three million?

488
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,949
Maybe more.

489
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,551
No killing.

490
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:00,751
Not if we do it my way.

491
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,640
New York's finest taxi service was
not your normal taxi service.

492
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,761
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the
N.Y.P.D. that ran a high-profit racket...

493
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,042
...driving smugglers and drug
dealers all over the city.

494
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,682
For a few hundred dollars a mile,
you got your own blue and white...

495
00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:46,483
...and a police escort.

496
00:30:46,923 --> 00:30:48,603
They even had their
own business cards.

497
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:50,004
After a while, somebody
started asking...

498
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:52,724
...questions and the
taxi service shut down.

499
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:56,285
Ever since then, Internal Affairs had been
waiting to catch them in the act.

500
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:58,126
And that's where we came in.

501
00:30:58,326 --> 00:30:59,566
So, how was the flight?

502
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:01,046
Fucking great.

503
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:04,847
Will this get me to Staten Island?

504
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,528
Kidding me? This will
get you to Cape Cod.

505
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,689
McManus came to us with the job,
Fenster got the vans...

506
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:13,249
...Hockney supplied the hardware.

507
00:31:13,449 --> 00:31:15,690
I came through with how
to do it so no-one got killed.

508
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,050
But Keaton...

509
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,371
Keaton put on
the finishing touch.

510
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:23,172
A little "fuck you" from the
five of us to the N.Y.P.D. .

511
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:27,413
All right, watch this.

512
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:29,453
Careful!

513
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:30,494
Asshole!

514
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:36,055
Don't move, you fucker!

515
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:37,775
- Who the--
- Drop it! Now, motherfucker!

516
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:40,176
Drop the fucking gun!

517
00:31:40,496 --> 00:31:42,016
Don't you fucking touch
those fucking things!

518
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:43,777
What the fuck d'you guys want?

519
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,337
Stupid asshole!

520
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:47,978
Watch it!

521
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:51,819
You want a buckshot shampoo, Chubby?

522
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,101
Afternoon, my little pork-chops.

523
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:01,541
Now gimme the shit.

524
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:03,022
Give him the fucking shit!

525
00:32:03,262 --> 00:32:04,102
Give him the fucking shit!

526
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:07,783
Hurry up!

527
00:32:08,023 --> 00:32:08,983
C'mon!

528
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:09,943
Now the money!

529
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:11,944
- There's no money!
- Gimme the money! Right now!

530
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:13,264
- There's no fucking money!

531
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:14,664
Give him the money!

532
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:15,585
The money!

533
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:17,785
Give me the fucking money!

534
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:18,945
Do it!

535
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:20,426
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!

536
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:26,027
Do you peolpe know
who the fuck I am?

537
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:28,548
We do now, jerk-off.

538
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,910
What's that?

539
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,551
What the fuck--?

540
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:42,551
Holy shit!

541
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:00,316
Keaton made an
anonymous phone call...

542
00:33:00,516 --> 00:33:02,636
...the press was on the scene
before the police were.

543
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:05,117
Strausz and Rizzi were
indicted three days later.

544
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,517
Within a few weeks, 50 more
cops went down with them.

545
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:10,958
Everybody got it right in the ass,
from the chief on down.

546
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:12,959
It was beautiful.

547
00:33:21,121 --> 00:33:22,601
I owe you $2.50 .

548
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:29,523
There's more here than I thought.

549
00:33:29,763 --> 00:33:31,083
When does the fence come?

550
00:33:31,883 --> 00:33:34,324
Redfoot never comes to see me,
I always go to see him.

551
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:36,885
In California?

552
00:33:38,165 --> 00:33:40,445
Yes, Verbal, in California.
Fenster and I will--

553
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:42,606
Wait, wait...
Hold the fucking phone...

554
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:43,966
...you and Fenster?
No, no, no...

555
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:46,527
You fuckin' kiddin' me?

556
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:47,767
Ok. So...

557
00:33:48,007 --> 00:33:49,208
...who's gonna go?

558
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:50,808
We all go!

559
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:53,969
What's your fucking
problem, man?

560
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:58,490
My fucking problem, man, is that you and
Fenster are off honeymooning in California...

561
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,850
...while the rest of us are
sitting here holding our dicks.

562
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:02,851
Hey!
The job's over.

563
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:04,491
Cool it.

564
00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:07,772
L.A. is a good place
to lay low for a while.

565
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:11,813
Wanna dance?

566
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:20,135
Ladies...

567
00:34:28,017 --> 00:34:29,658
I would like to propose a toast...

568
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:32,138
There you go.

569
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,299
...to Mr. Verbal...

570
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,620
...the man with the plan.

571
00:34:52,783 --> 00:34:54,104
We're gonna miss the flight.

572
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:57,584
Don't do this.
Send her a note - something.

573
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:00,265
I said we'll make it.

574
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:34,754
We're gonna miss the plane.

575
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:37,914
She'll understand.

576
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:58,239
That's heartwarming.

577
00:35:58,439 --> 00:35:59,520
Really.

578
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,280
I'm weepy.

579
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:05,121
Jeff, you wanna wait outside?

580
00:36:08,682 --> 00:36:11,483
You guys wanted to know what happened
after the line-up. I'm telling you.

581
00:36:11,723 --> 00:36:12,843
Come on, Verbal.

582
00:36:13,283 --> 00:36:14,843
Who do you think
you're talking to?

583
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:17,884
You expect me to believe
that he retired?

584
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:19,965
For a woman?

585
00:36:22,085 --> 00:36:23,005
Bullshit!

586
00:36:23,686 --> 00:36:24,766
Keaton was using her.

587
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:26,126
He loved her.

588
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:27,126
Sure.

589
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:30,407
I'm supposed to believe that hitting the
taxi service wasn't his idea either?

590
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,128
It was all Fenster and McManus.

591
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:34,128
C'mon, Keaton was
a cop for 4 years!

592
00:36:34,328 --> 00:36:37,369
Who else would know the taxi service better?
That job had his name written all over it.

593
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:38,929
But Edie had him
all turned around.

594
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:40,850
Let me tell you something.

595
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,330
I know Dean Keaton.

596
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,251
I've been investigating him
for the past 3 years.

597
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,852
The guy I know was a
cold-blooded bastard.

598
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:52,213
I.A.D. indicted him on three counts of murder
before he was kicked off the force.

599
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:54,413
So don't sell me the hooker
with the heart of gold.

600
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:56,254
You got him all wrong.

601
00:36:57,494 --> 00:36:58,294
Do I?

602
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:03,095
Dean Keaton was under indictment a total
of 7 times while he was on the force.

603
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:06,656
In every case the witnesses either
reversed their testimony to the grand jury...

604
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:09,297
...or died before they could testify.

605
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:14,298
When they finally nailed him for fraud
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

606
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:16,419
He killed three
prisioners inside.

607
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:19,299
Of course
I can't prove this.

608
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,340
But I can't prove
the best part either:

609
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,861
Dean Keaton was dead.

610
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:27,901
Did you know that?

611
00:37:28,341 --> 00:37:30,142
He died in a fire
two years ago...

612
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:32,463
...during an investigation into
the murder of a witness...

613
00:37:32,703 --> 00:37:34,743
...who was going to
testify against him.

614
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:37,824
Two people saw Dean Keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned...

615
00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:39,624
...just before it blew up.

616
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:42,705
They said he went in to
check a leaking gas main.

617
00:37:43,665 --> 00:37:47,026
It blew up, and took all
of Dean Keaton with it.

618
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:50,267
Within three months
of the explosion...

619
00:37:50,587 --> 00:37:52,307
...the two witnesses,
they were dead.

620
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:54,908
One killed himself in his car...

621
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:57,869
...the other fell down an
open elevator shaft.

622
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,590
Agent Baer.

623
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,630
This is not what we discussed.
There are far too many people in this room--

624
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,991
Look, doctor, I promise we'll be out of
here before he blows his porcelain. Ok?

625
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,592
I have a noon meeting, Baer.

626
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:12,432
- Agent Baer, five minutes.
- Look, everyone just calm down. All right?

627
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:15,873
I want you to ask this man about the shoot-out in the harbor.

628
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:28,156
He says they were buying--

629
00:38:28,636 --> 00:38:30,517
Dope, we know.

630
00:38:35,918 --> 00:38:39,519
He doesn't know what they
were buying, but not dope... people.

631
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:40,639
What?

632
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,002
He needs guarantees...

633
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,122
What is he talking about?

634
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,282
He says his life's in danger.

635
00:38:54,403 --> 00:38:57,924
He saw the devil.
Looked him in the eye.

636
00:38:58,164 --> 00:39:00,484
- I'm on my way.
- No, no. Wait a minute.

637
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:03,445
Ask him to tell him what he told me.

638
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:05,285
About the devil.

639
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:07,326
Who's the devil.

640
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:14,127
Keyser Soze.

641
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:20,929
He was in the harbor...

642
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:23,210
...killing many men.

643
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,330
He saw Keyser Soze?

644
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:32,812
He saw his face.

645
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:36,533
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

646
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:38,213
Describe him.

647
00:39:44,775 --> 00:39:47,896
Six weeks ago I get an anonymous
phone call telling me...

648
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:50,897
...I could find Keaton eating at Mondino's
with his attourney. And there he is.

649
00:39:51,657 --> 00:39:54,457
Now, because he never
profited from his alleged death...

650
00:39:54,697 --> 00:39:57,938
...and because we convicted someone
else of the murder we tried to pin on him...

651
00:39:58,178 --> 00:39:59,739
...we had to let him go.

652
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:03,620
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

653
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,460
And then he had lunch.

654
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,181
I don't know about that.

655
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,021
Oh, I don't think you do.

656
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:12,982
But you say you saw Keaton die.
I think you're covering his ass...

657
00:40:13,262 --> 00:40:14,982
...and he's still out there somewhere.

658
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:17,103
I think he's behind that
whole circus at the harbor.

659
00:40:17,303 --> 00:40:20,584
My bet is he's using you because your're
stupid and you think he's your friend.

660
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:23,024
You tell me he's dead?
So be it.

661
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:25,945
I want to be sure he's dead
before I go back to New York.

662
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:28,666
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

663
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:30,666
What lawyer.

664
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:32,467
What lawyer, Verbal?

665
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:35,347
You know, back when I was with that
barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois, I--

666
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:37,748
You don't think I know
you held out on the D.A.?

667
00:40:37,988 --> 00:40:39,468
What did you leave
out on that testimony?

668
00:40:39,669 --> 00:40:41,389
I can be on the phone to
Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.

669
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:43,149
The D.A. gave me immunity.

670
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:46,630
Nos from me. You get no immunity
from me, you piece of shit.

671
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,991
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor...

672
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:54,072
...every creeping scumbag that works the street
for a living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

673
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:55,192
Now you talk to me...

674
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:57,793
...or that precious immunity they
seem so fit to grant you...

675
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:01,154
...won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

676
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:05,875
There was a lawyer.

677
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:08,596
Kobayashi.

678
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:10,956
Is he the one that killed Keaton?

679
00:41:11,356 --> 00:41:14,037
No.
But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

680
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:16,238
Convince me.

681
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:18,558
Tell me every last detail.

682
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:40,684
We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus' friends, Redfoot.

683
00:41:41,284 --> 00:41:42,844
He had a good reputation.

684
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:44,765
Seemed like a good guy.

685
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:46,685
Still, we should have known better.

686
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:47,645
How're you doing?

687
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:50,926
- Good. You?
- Not bad.

688
00:41:51,686 --> 00:41:53,007
- How's it going, Fenster?

689
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:56,007
No need to open it, right?

690
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:03,569
You must be Keaton.

691
00:42:04,729 --> 00:42:06,330
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

692
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,970
Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.

693
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,491
Verbal. The man with the plan, huh?

694
00:42:11,171 --> 00:42:12,651
You guys interested
in any more work?

695
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:15,132
We're always looking
for extra work.

696
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:16,612
We're on vacation.

697
00:42:18,093 --> 00:42:19,493
Oh well... that's too bad.

698
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,774
I have a ton of work and I
don't have any good people.

699
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,974
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job.

700
00:42:24,454 --> 00:42:27,055
There's this jeweler out
of Texas named Saul.

701
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:29,175
He rents a suite in some
downtown hotel...

702
00:42:29,576 --> 00:42:32,736
...does free appraisals for people.
Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

703
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,497
Anyway, the word is he
carries around a lot of cash.

704
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:40,098
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

705
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,779
- It's simple.
- What about security?

706
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:44,259
A couple of bodyguards.

707
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:46,020
Nothing you couldn't handle.

708
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,020
Give me time to check it out.

709
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,341
I'd expect nothing less
from you, man.

710
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:53,862
- Good to see you. We'll call you.
- Good to see you too.

711
00:42:54,062 --> 00:42:56,542
Enjoy L.A., huh?
Get yourself laid.

712
00:43:01,263 --> 00:43:05,024
A friend of mine in New York tells
me that you know Spook Hollis.

713
00:43:06,105 --> 00:43:07,625
The way I hear it...

714
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:08,905
...you did time with old Spook.

715
00:43:09,225 --> 00:43:10,906
Good man, wasn't he?

716
00:43:11,346 --> 00:43:12,946
I used to run dope for him.

717
00:43:13,826 --> 00:43:15,547
Too bad he got shivved.

718
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:18,908
Yeah. I shivved him.

719
00:43:21,468 --> 00:43:24,469
Better you hear it from me now
than somebody else later.

720
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,950
I appreciate that.

721
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,511
Just out of curiosity...

722
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:34,111
...was it business or personal?

723
00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:36,792
A bit of both.

724
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:42,594
Well, like I said, you give me
a call if you're interested.

725
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:49,115
Is there a problem?

726
00:43:50,956 --> 00:43:53,756
One job. That was the deal.

727
00:43:59,118 --> 00:44:00,558
One job?

728
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,679
One job!

729
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:07,800
That's a good one, Keaton.

730
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,521
Keaton followed the best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.

731
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:16,522
He can convince anyone he's
someone else, but never himself.

732
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:20,043
It took one day with McManus nagging
and we went back to work.

733
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,932
Give me the case!
Give me the fucking case!

734
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:03,533
Give me the fucking case!

735
00:45:03,853 --> 00:45:05,534
I'm telling you for the last time...

736
00:45:05,894 --> 00:45:07,414
...give me the fucking case!

737
00:45:48,224 --> 00:45:49,825
Now just hand over the case.

738
00:45:50,945 --> 00:45:52,705
Hand over the fucking case!

739
00:46:18,872 --> 00:46:20,672
Bad day. Fuck it.

740
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,400
Looks like a lot of China to me.
Shit.

741
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,242
Guys, c'mon.

742
00:47:01,562 --> 00:47:03,803
- What are you doing?
- What does it look that I'm doing. I'm gonna kill him.

743
00:47:04,003 --> 00:47:05,723
Look, we did it your way.
Now we're gonna do it my way.

744
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,764
- Are you gonna kill him?
- I'm going to deal with him.

745
00:47:08,044 --> 00:47:09,884
You better deal with him--

746
00:47:10,085 --> 00:47:11,045
Shut up.

747
00:47:17,926 --> 00:47:19,007
What I am supposed to do with that?

748
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:22,087
I don't know. Feed it to the gimp.

749
00:47:22,368 --> 00:47:23,848
Eases pain. I don't know what that is.

750
00:47:24,128 --> 00:47:25,648
- What do you mean you don' know?
- Shut up.

751
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:27,649
I don't know. I got thrown
this job by some lawyer.

752
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:28,689
Yeah, who?

753
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:31,050
I don't know. Some Limey.

754
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,850
He's a middle man for somebody.
He doesn't say. I don't ask.

755
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:35,771
- You're fucking full of shit.
- Fuck you!

756
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:39,732
Listen to me. We want to meet him, ok?

757
00:47:41,252 --> 00:47:42,573
That's funny. Called me last night...

758
00:47:43,413 --> 00:47:45,573
...he says he wants to meet you guys.

759
00:47:47,494 --> 00:47:49,294
Ok. We'll meet him.

760
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:51,175
- I'll call you.
- Good. Do that. No problem.

761
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:52,615
I don't like the deal.

762
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:54,695
One more thing, tough guy.

763
00:47:55,336 --> 00:47:57,536
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

764
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:02,777
You're such a top guy McManus.
But do me a favor, right?

765
00:48:03,018 --> 00:48:04,378
Get the fuck off my dick!

766
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,859
Put a leash on that puppy.

767
00:48:10,939 --> 00:48:14,300
It's an awful shame about
Saul getting waxed.

768
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,701
Cops are gonna be looking
for the guys who did it.

769
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,222
Sooner or later they're
gonna come 'round asking me.

770
00:48:22,702 --> 00:48:24,583
You have a sweet night, ladies.

771
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:38,426
- So this lawyer...
- Kobayashi.

772
00:48:39,146 --> 00:48:41,267
- ...came from Redfoot.
- Right.

773
00:48:41,747 --> 00:48:44,028
And why leave this out
when you talked to the D.A.?

774
00:48:44,428 --> 00:48:46,228
Dave. Someone to see you.

775
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:53,310
Jack. I've been looking all over for you.

776
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:57,151
You still after that coke that took a walk out
of that blood bath in the harbor yesterday?

777
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,072
- Yeah.
- Well, you can stop looking. It was no coke.

778
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:03,352
I've been in L.A. county talking
to a guy they pulled out...

779
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:05,353
...of a drainpipe in San Pedro
yesterday after the shoot-out.

780
00:49:05,553 --> 00:49:07,313
He came to this morning.
He started talking.

781
00:49:07,513 --> 00:49:11,114
He was part of a Hungarian mob there to do
a deal with a bunch of goats from Argentina...

782
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:12,995
...and he says it was
definitely not a dope deal.

783
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:14,115
- But the 91 mill--
- Yeah, we know.

784
00:49:14,595 --> 00:49:16,396
Our man says
no way on the dope.

785
00:49:16,596 --> 00:49:19,916
This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch
was pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

786
00:49:20,197 --> 00:49:23,477
They had no time to negotiate that kind
of product and no means to move it.

787
00:49:23,677 --> 00:49:25,438
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

788
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:28,359
No one doing the deal knew,
except for a few key people.

789
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,919
They all were very hush
about it, he says.

790
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,440
Whatever it was,
it's very sensitive.

791
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,760
I don't get it.

792
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,281
They tell me you got that cripple there
from New York. Did he mention Keyser Soze?

793
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:40,441
Who?

794
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:42,762
Just bear with me here.

795
00:49:44,322 --> 00:49:45,483
Who's Keyser Soze?

796
00:49:45,643 --> 00:49:46,843
Oh, fuck!

797
00:49:47,643 --> 00:49:51,044
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

798
00:49:51,484 --> 00:49:54,965
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get the hell out of here now.

799
00:49:55,165 --> 00:49:56,846
What we need to do is think.

800
00:49:57,526 --> 00:49:58,686
Think back.

801
00:49:59,806 --> 00:50:01,007
Somebody...

802
00:50:01,287 --> 00:50:02,647
...with power.

803
00:50:02,887 --> 00:50:05,728
Somebody who was capable of tracking
us from New York to Los Angeles.

804
00:50:05,928 --> 00:50:07,528
Come on, Dean. What the
hell are we doing here?

805
00:50:07,728 --> 00:50:09,009
We're waiting.

806
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:11,529
- Bye now.
- Sit down.

807
00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:13,090
- No, I'm fucking bored--

808
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,850
- Mr. Hockney, do stay. Mr. Keaton...

809
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:21,372
...Mr. Fenster I recognize from his
mug shots, as well as Mr. McManus.

810
00:50:21,572 --> 00:50:26,253
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

811
00:50:26,453 --> 00:50:30,334
My employer sends his gratitude.
A most unexpected benefit.

812
00:50:31,174 --> 00:50:32,774
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

813
00:50:32,974 --> 00:50:36,095
I have been asked by my
employer to bring a proposal...

814
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,415
...to you gentlemen.

815
00:50:37,616 --> 00:50:40,456
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services gentlemen.

816
00:50:42,577 --> 00:50:46,018
One job. One day's work. Very dangerous.

817
00:50:46,218 --> 00:50:49,378
He does not expect all of you to live.
But those of you who do...

818
00:50:49,658 --> 00:50:52,379
...will have 91 million dollars
to divide between you...

819
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,380
- ...in any way you see fit.
- Who's your boss?

820
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,861
- I work for Keyser Soze.

821
00:51:10,184 --> 00:51:12,024
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Judging by the sudden change in mood, Mr. Kint...

822
00:51:12,304 --> 00:51:15,505
...I feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you.

823
00:51:16,545 --> 00:51:19,346
I come with an offer
directly from Mr. Soze.

824
00:51:19,546 --> 00:51:20,946
An order, actually.

825
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:22,987
What do you mean, an order?

826
00:51:23,267 --> 00:51:24,787
In 1981, Mr. Keaton,...

827
00:51:24,987 --> 00:51:28,348
...you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

828
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:32,029
The cargo was raw steel.
Steel which belonged to Mr. Soze...

829
00:51:32,229 --> 00:51:35,950
...and which was destined for Pakistan,
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

830
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,271
A most profitable violation
of U.N. regulations.

831
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:41,151
You had no way of
knowing this, Mr. Keaton...

832
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:44,272
...because the fellow shipping the
steel was working for Mr. Soze...

833
00:51:44,552 --> 00:51:46,112
...without his knowledge.

834
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:47,753
Earlier this year...

835
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:52,514
...Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a
two-prop cargo flight out of Newark airport.

836
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:56,755
The plane was carrying gold and platinum
wiring. Also set for Pakistan.

837
00:51:57,435 --> 00:52:01,316
Two months ago, Mr. Hockney
stole a truck carrying gun parts...

838
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:02,396
...through Queens...

839
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:06,797
...gun parts which where set to be
destroyed by the State of New York.

840
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,518
They would be "lost" in a weigh
station and rerouted to Belfast.

841
00:52:10,718 --> 00:52:13,479
Again, Mr. Soze, using pawns
who had no knowledge.

842
00:52:13,919 --> 00:52:16,200
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

843
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,080
Nine months ago...

844
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,041
...one of Mr. Soze's
less-than-intelligent couriers...

845
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:25,482
...was taken in a complicated
confidence scan...by a cripple.

846
00:52:26,482 --> 00:52:29,243
He was relieved of 62,000 dollars.

847
00:52:30,643 --> 00:52:32,484
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

848
00:52:32,684 --> 00:52:36,165
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

849
00:52:36,565 --> 00:52:38,365
You set up the line-up...

850
00:52:38,645 --> 00:52:40,846
Yes. You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

851
00:52:41,046 --> 00:52:43,807
It seems Mr. Keatons
attourney, Ms. Finneran...

852
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:46,047
...was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

853
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:49,688
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

854
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:52,689
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

855
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,169
Mr. Soze rarely works
with the same people...

856
00:52:55,449 --> 00:52:57,130
...for very long, and they
never know who they're working for.

857
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,371
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

858
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:04,052
So... why telling us?

859
00:53:04,332 --> 00:53:08,053
Because you have stolen
from Mr. Soze, Mr. Fenster.

860
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:09,053
All of you.

861
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:11,253
That you did not know
you stole from him...

862
00:53:11,453 --> 00:53:13,454
...is the only reason
you're still alive.

863
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:17,135
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

864
00:53:17,615 --> 00:53:19,455
All right, fuck the debt!
And fuck you!

865
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:21,176
How do we know
you work for Soze?

866
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:24,297
I don't think that is very
relevant, Mr. Hockney.

867
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:28,818
All five of you are responsible for the
murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

868
00:53:29,098 --> 00:53:33,179
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your involvement,
and we can see to it that he will.

869
00:53:33,379 --> 00:53:36,339
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen.

870
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,820
Mr. Soze's primary interest...

871
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,501
...is narcotics.

872
00:53:40,661 --> 00:53:43,181
He has been "competing", shall we say,
with a group of Argentinians...

873
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:45,662
...for several years now.

874
00:53:45,862 --> 00:53:48,783
Competing with Mr. Soze
has taken its toll.

875
00:53:49,383 --> 00:53:52,503
These Argentinians are
negotiating the sale...

876
00:53:52,784 --> 00:53:55,584
...of 91 million dollars in
cocaine in 3 days time.

877
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,545
Needless to say, this
purchase will revitalize...

878
00:53:58,745 --> 00:54:01,466
...the diminishing strength
of their organization.

879
00:54:02,146 --> 00:54:05,427
Mr. Soze would like you
to stop the deal.

880
00:54:06,507 --> 00:54:08,988
If you choose, you may
wait until after the buy.

881
00:54:09,188 --> 00:54:11,428
Whatever money changes hands
is yours.

882
00:54:12,508 --> 00:54:17,029
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the
boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.

883
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:21,871
And then you will be free of
your obligations to Mr. Soze.

884
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:27,392
You give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

885
00:54:28,912 --> 00:54:29,833
A gift...

886
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:31,713
...from Mr. Soze.

887
00:54:34,714 --> 00:54:36,274
Good day, gentlemen.

888
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:45,771
They've got my whole life in here!
Everything I've ever done since I was 18!

889
00:55:46,251 --> 00:55:47,572
They fucking know everything!

890
00:55:48,332 --> 00:55:50,372
Everybody I've ever worked
with or did time with.

891
00:56:08,137 --> 00:56:09,937
- No... this isn't right.
- I don't know.

892
00:56:10,217 --> 00:56:12,658
Who was that guy who used
to talk about Soze in New York?

893
00:56:14,898 --> 00:56:15,979
Bricks Marlin.

894
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:18,939
Yeah, he did jobs for him.
Indirect stuff.

895
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,220
He said he always made 5 times
more money than the job was worth.

896
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:27,382
This guy's a pipe dream.
Kobayashi is using him for window dressing.

897
00:56:27,942 --> 00:56:29,462
I don't know.
This is bad.

898
00:56:29,982 --> 00:56:33,583
That's bullshit! This guy could be L.A.P.D. ...
It's a fucking setup!

899
00:56:34,463 --> 00:56:37,224
Ah, the way I hear it, Soze...
is some kind of butcher.

900
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:39,705
A fearless psycho...
fucked up butcher.

901
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:41,625
There is no Keyser Soze!

902
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:45,186
Who is Keyser Soze?

903
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:50,027
He's supposed to be turkish.
Some say his father was german.

904
00:56:50,587 --> 00:56:52,628
Nobody ever believed
he was real.

905
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:55,749
Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him...

906
00:56:55,949 --> 00:56:58,669
...but to hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for Soze.

907
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:01,310
You never knew.
That was his power.

908
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,631
The greatest trick
the devil ever pulled...

909
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:08,632
...was convincing the
world he didn't exist.

910
00:57:10,192 --> 00:57:12,633
One story the guys told me
-the story I believe- ...

911
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,433
...was from his days in Turkey.

912
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:17,154
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

913
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:18,874
They realized that to be in power...

914
00:57:19,234 --> 00:57:21,995
...you didn't need guns,
or money, or even numbers.

915
00:57:22,195 --> 00:57:25,676
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

916
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:28,957
After a while, they come into power
and then they come after Soze.

917
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:31,877
He was small time then,
just running dope they say.

918
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:35,878
They come to his home...

919
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:37,239
...in the afternoon...

920
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:38,799
...looking for his business.

921
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,319
They find his wife and
kids in the house...

922
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,240
...and decide to
wait for Soze.

923
00:57:57,964 --> 00:57:59,284
He comes home...

924
00:57:59,484 --> 00:58:02,165
...to find his wife raped
and children screaming.

925
00:58:02,365 --> 00:58:05,486
The Hungarians knew Soze was
tough. Not to be trifled with.

926
00:58:05,766 --> 00:58:07,126
So they let him know
they meant business.

927
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:15,728
They tell him they want his territory.
All of his business.

928
00:58:16,168 --> 00:58:19,689
Soze looks over the
faces of his family...

929
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:24,850
...then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

930
00:58:43,455 --> 00:58:46,496
He tells him he would
rather see his family dead...

931
00:58:46,896 --> 00:58:49,136
...than live another
day after this.

932
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:52,297
He lets the last Hungarian go.

933
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:56,338
He waits until his wife and kids are in the ground
and then he goes after the rest of the mob.

934
00:58:56,778 --> 00:58:59,859
He kills their kids. He kills their wives.
He kills their parents...

935
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:01,539
...and their parents friends.

936
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,220
He burns down the
houses they live in...

937
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,701
...and the stores
they work in.

938
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:10,662
He kills people that owe them
money. And like that...

939
00:59:12,102 --> 00:59:13,862
...he's gone.
Underground.

940
00:59:14,063 --> 00:59:16,383
Nobody has ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

941
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,464
A spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night.

942
00:59:19,664 --> 00:59:22,585
"Rat on your pop
and Keyser Soze will get you."

943
00:59:23,465 --> 00:59:25,425
No one ever really believes.

944
00:59:26,346 --> 00:59:27,306
Do you believe
in him, Verbal?

945
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:31,747
Keaton always said:

946
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:35,068
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

947
00:59:37,068 --> 00:59:39,109
Well, I believe in God.

948
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:42,990
And the only thing that
scares me is Keyser Soze.

949
00:59:49,951 --> 00:59:51,712
You give any weight to this?

950
00:59:51,952 --> 00:59:54,032
I can introduce you to
Dan Metzheiser from Justice.

951
00:59:54,232 --> 00:59:57,753
He's got a file on Soze in D.C. .
I'ts been a hobby of his for a couple of years.

952
00:59:57,953 --> 01:00:01,034
A lot of guys equate him to that
reporter on the Incredible Hulk.

953
01:00:06,195 --> 01:00:08,716
- You've heard of him?
- What, on the street?

954
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:11,517
A few times.
Outside stuff.

955
01:00:12,037 --> 01:00:14,117
Somebody working for a guy
who works for a guy...

956
01:00:14,317 --> 01:00:16,958
...who got some money from Keyser Soze.
Y'know, shit like that.

957
01:00:17,998 --> 01:00:19,399
Could be an old badge.

958
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,199
A hex sign to keep people
from fucking with you...

959
01:00:21,399 --> 01:00:23,240
...back when a name
was to mean something.

960
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,520
But you're here.

961
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,520
Shit, yeah.

962
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,201
I got a guy trying to walk out of
the hospital on a fried drumstick...

963
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:29,401
...because he's afraid of Soze.

964
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,962
I'll run up the flagpole.

965
01:00:33,802 --> 01:00:35,803
I came clean. I told it like it
happened on the boat.

966
01:00:36,003 --> 01:00:37,523
So what if I left out
how I got there?

967
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:40,644
It's so full of holes, the D.A. would have
told me to blow amnesty up my ass.

968
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:42,804
So you got what you wanted
out of me, so big fucking deal.

969
01:00:43,004 --> 01:00:44,165
So that's why you
never told the D.A. .

970
01:00:44,445 --> 01:00:47,325
Well, you tell me, Agent Kujan...
if I told you the Loch Ness monster...

971
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:49,086
hired me to hit the harbor,
what would you say?

972
01:00:49,286 --> 01:00:51,646
Turn state's evidence. We'll put you
on the stand, we'll hear it out.

973
01:00:51,927 --> 01:00:53,807
I've got immunity now.
What can you possibly offer me?

974
01:00:54,087 --> 01:00:56,488
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come looking for you.

975
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:59,248
Where's your head,
Agent Kujan?

976
01:00:59,849 --> 01:01:01,209
Where do you think
the pressure's coming from?

977
01:01:01,409 --> 01:01:02,969
Keyser Soze, or whatever
you want to call him...

978
01:01:03,169 --> 01:01:04,530
...he knows where
I am right now.

979
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:06,610
He's got the front burner
under your ass to let me go...

980
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,491
...so he can scoop me up
10 minutes later.

981
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,411
Immunity was just a
deal with you assholes.

982
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:12,212
I've got a whole new
problem when I post bail.

983
01:01:12,572 --> 01:01:14,332
So why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

984
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:16,693
Oh, gee, thanks Dave. Bang-up job so far...

985
01:01:16,893 --> 01:01:19,293
...extortion,
coersion...

986
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:21,294
...you probably pardon me
if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

987
01:01:21,534 --> 01:01:23,214
The same fuckers that rounded
this up and sank us into this mess...

988
01:01:23,414 --> 01:01:24,455
...are now bailing me out?

989
01:01:24,655 --> 01:01:25,535
Fuck you!

990
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:30,536
You think you can
catch Keyser Soze?

991
01:01:30,776 --> 01:01:33,377
You think a guy like that comes
this close to getting caught...

992
01:01:33,577 --> 01:01:34,697
...and sticks his head out?

993
01:01:35,417 --> 01:01:37,938
If he comes up for anything,
it will be to get rid of me.

994
01:01:38,138 --> 01:01:38,938
And after that...

995
01:01:40,258 --> 01:01:42,739
...my guess is you'll never
hear from him again.

996
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:05,585
What happened next?

997
01:02:05,945 --> 01:02:08,305
We woke up next morning
and Fenster was gone.

998
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:11,106
He couldn't handle the
idea of slumming for Soze.

999
01:02:11,306 --> 01:02:13,067
He left us a note
wishing us good luck...

1000
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:15,307
...and took a chunk of the
money we'd scraped together.

1001
01:02:15,947 --> 01:02:17,148
Then what?

1002
01:02:17,388 --> 01:02:18,508
McManus was furious.

1003
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:20,588
He was talking about tracking him
down and ripping his heart out...

1004
01:02:20,788 --> 01:02:22,229
...and all sorts of shit.

1005
01:02:23,589 --> 01:02:25,230
That night we got the call.

1006
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,030
What call?

1007
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:29,551
Kobayashi told us
where we could find Fenster.

1008
01:02:37,232 --> 01:02:38,953
All right, let's get
the fuck out of here.

1009
01:02:41,113 --> 01:02:42,554
We've got to bury him.

1010
01:02:42,874 --> 01:02:44,074
With what?

1011
01:02:44,514 --> 01:02:45,915
With our hands.

1012
01:02:55,437 --> 01:02:56,917
Oh, this is nuts!

1013
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,878
It's dry fucking sand,
McManus. When he rots...

1014
01:03:00,078 --> 01:03:02,239
...the surfers are gonna
smell him a mile away.

1015
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:03,399
Dig, you fucker!

1016
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,160
Hey, what are we going to do?
This fucking guy is gonna kill us.

1017
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,840
I don't know you,
peg-leg, but I can run.

1018
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,041
I got no problem with that.

1019
01:03:10,961 --> 01:03:13,761
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have
a problem with that either.

1020
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:18,523
You run? I won't be digging
a hole for you. You got that?

1021
01:03:19,643 --> 01:03:22,924
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

1022
01:03:23,684 --> 01:03:25,004
Fuck you!

1023
01:03:25,204 --> 01:03:27,165
He was my partner
for 5 years.

1024
01:03:27,525 --> 01:03:30,686
We did more jobs, and I saw more
money, than you can ever count.

1025
01:03:30,886 --> 01:03:33,966
So fuck you!
'Cause now it's payback!

1026
01:03:34,206 --> 01:03:35,927
It's not payback.

1027
01:03:38,808 --> 01:03:41,648
It's precaution. You want payback?
You wanna run? I don't care.

1028
01:03:46,009 --> 01:03:48,170
I'm not doing this for Fenster.

1029
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:50,530
I'm not doing it for you.

1030
01:03:52,211 --> 01:03:53,851
I'm doing this for me.

1031
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:57,572
I'm going to finish this thing.

1032
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:01,333
This Kobayashi bastard
is not going to stand on me.

1033
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:23,579
And after they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

1034
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:25,939
I wanted to. I thought
we could make it.

1035
01:04:26,139 --> 01:04:27,540
Why didn't you say anything?

1036
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:30,060
Believe me, I tried.
But Keaton wouldn't have it.

1037
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:31,861
It was too far-fetched for him.

1038
01:04:32,061 --> 01:04:34,341
Keaton was a grounded guy,
an ex-cop.

1039
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:38,462
To a cop the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.

1040
01:04:39,062 --> 01:04:41,583
There's no mistery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it all.

1041
01:04:41,783 --> 01:04:43,383
If you got a dead body
and you think his brother did it...

1042
01:04:43,584 --> 01:04:44,864
...you're going to find out you're right.

1043
01:04:45,104 --> 01:04:48,305
Nobody argued with Keaton.
They just set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.

1044
01:04:58,987 --> 01:04:59,868
They're coming up.

1045
01:05:01,668 --> 01:05:03,668
You hear me?
He's coming up.

1046
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:05,349
He's on his way down.

1047
01:06:00,002 --> 01:06:00,963
Don't move.

1048
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,563
Press twenty.
Do it now.

1049
01:06:23,128 --> 01:06:24,048
Move.

1050
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:28,609
The answer is no.

1051
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,330
Mr. Soze will be most up--

1052
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,570
Listen, you cocksucker,
there is no Keyser Soze.

1053
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:34,371
You mention his name again,
I'll kill you right now.

1054
01:06:34,611 --> 01:06:38,212
Strange threat, Mr. Keaton. I can only assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

1055
01:06:43,893 --> 01:06:46,454
We know that you
can get to us.

1056
01:06:47,134 --> 01:06:49,414
But now you know
that we can get to you.

1057
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:52,935
I'm giving you one last
chance to call this off.

1058
01:06:53,135 --> 01:06:54,336
Mr. So--

1059
01:06:54,696 --> 01:06:57,817
My employer has made up
his mind. He does not change it.

1060
01:06:58,177 --> 01:06:58,897
Neither do we.

1061
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:02,418
You got Fenster.
But you won't get all of us.

1062
01:07:02,698 --> 01:07:04,498
Not before one of us
gets through to you.

1063
01:07:04,698 --> 01:07:07,819
I believe you, Mr. McManus.
I most sincerely do.

1064
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:11,220
You would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable.

1065
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,340
But I cannot make
this decision.

1066
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:16,021
Whatever you threaten
me with is... ludicrous...

1067
01:07:16,261 --> 01:07:20,222
...in comparsion to what will be done to me
if I do not carry out my orders in full.

1068
01:07:27,824 --> 01:07:29,944
I'm the guy that's
going to get you.

1069
01:07:31,865 --> 01:07:33,985
I just wanted you
to know that.

1070
01:07:34,906 --> 01:07:36,946
I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus.

1071
01:07:37,226 --> 01:07:39,587
I implore you, Mr. Keaton,
believe me.

1072
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:43,348
Mr. Soze is very real
and very determined.

1073
01:07:43,588 --> 01:07:44,708
We'll see.

1074
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:55,031
Before you...
...do me in, Mr. McManus...

1075
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:57,351
...you'll let me finish
my business...

1076
01:07:57,591 --> 01:07:59,072
...with Ms. Finneran first,
won't you?

1077
01:08:04,033 --> 01:08:05,433
What did you say?

1078
01:08:06,513 --> 01:08:10,074
Edie Finneran.
She's upstairs in my office.

1079
01:08:10,834 --> 01:08:13,475
For an extradition deposition.

1080
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:16,476
I requested she be put
on the case personally.

1081
01:08:16,716 --> 01:08:18,436
She flew in yesterday.

1082
01:08:20,357 --> 01:08:21,677
No matter.

1083
01:08:22,077 --> 01:08:24,038
Kill away, Mr. McManus.

1084
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,799
You're lying.

1085
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:31,520
Am I?

1086
01:08:48,244 --> 01:08:50,364
Ms. Finneran's escort while
she's here in Los Angeles.

1087
01:08:50,644 --> 01:08:53,285
Never leaves her
side for a moment.

1088
01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:56,486
I thought you'd be glad
to know she's in good hands.

1089
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:03,367
Now get some rest. The boat
will be ready for you on Friday.

1090
01:09:03,647 --> 01:09:05,928
If I see you or any of
your friends before then...

1091
01:09:06,288 --> 01:09:08,209
Ms. Finneran will find
herself the victim...

1092
01:09:08,449 --> 01:09:10,649
...of a most gruesome violation
before she dies.

1093
01:09:10,889 --> 01:09:13,050
As, indeed, your
father, Mr. Hockney...

1094
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:16,771
...and your uncle Randall
in Arizona, Mr. Kint.

1095
01:09:17,531 --> 01:09:19,531
I might only castrate...

1096
01:09:19,851 --> 01:09:21,492
...Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

1097
01:09:23,572 --> 01:09:25,213
Do I make myself clear?

1098
01:09:26,053 --> 01:09:28,093
We will take care of
the two bodies downstairs.

1099
01:09:28,334 --> 01:09:30,494
We'll add them to
the cost of Mr. Fenster.

1100
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:32,575
Now if you'll excuse me,
gentlemen.

1101
01:10:09,864 --> 01:10:11,824
Geez. It's a logistical nightmare.

1102
01:10:12,184 --> 01:10:14,905
Close quarters. Ten, maybe twenty men.

1103
01:10:15,585 --> 01:10:17,626
There's no telling how many
more are gonna be below deck.

1104
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:20,226
Can we stealth these guys?

1105
01:10:20,906 --> 01:10:23,387
No. With all that coke,
they are going to be ready.

1106
01:10:24,627 --> 01:10:26,908
Which brings me to
sunny point number two.

1107
01:10:27,588 --> 01:10:30,869
Even if one of us gets through and
jacks the boat, we still get nothing.

1108
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:32,469
What if we wait for the money?

1109
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:35,150
Ten more men at least.

1110
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:38,511
Look, in my opinion
it can't be done.

1111
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:40,751
Anybody who goes in there
is not coming out alive.

1112
01:10:40,951 --> 01:10:41,992
I'm gonna wait for the money.

1113
01:10:42,752 --> 01:10:43,592
Me too.

1114
01:10:43,832 --> 01:10:45,472
Did you hear
what he just said?

1115
01:10:45,793 --> 01:10:47,753
- If I'm going in, I want a cut.
- Me too.

1116
01:10:49,874 --> 01:10:51,594
There's nothing
that can't be done.

1117
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:57,155
I just can't believe we're just
gonna walk into certain death.

1118
01:11:04,277 --> 01:11:06,638
News said it's raining
in New York.

1119
01:11:27,523 --> 01:11:29,083
What language is that?

1120
01:11:29,283 --> 01:11:32,164
I don't know.
Russian, I think.

1121
01:11:34,084 --> 01:11:35,485
Hungarian?

1122
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,420
Package has arrived.

1123
01:12:58,545 --> 01:12:59,385
You kids are ready?

1124
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:01,906
I would be if I wouldn't have
to stop and answer you.

1125
01:13:03,226 --> 01:13:04,147
I'm ready.

1126
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:07,227
McManus, you better be
set up in ten seconds.

1127
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:10,228
I'm ready.

1128
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:13,389
I want you to stay here.

1129
01:13:14,869 --> 01:13:15,909
But I'm supposed to cover--

1130
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,870
Listen, if we don't get out of this
I want you to take the money and go.

1131
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,151
Find Edie, tell her what
happened. Tell her everything.

1132
01:13:22,391 --> 01:13:23,871
She knows people.
She knows what to do.

1133
01:13:24,512 --> 01:13:27,392
If I don't get Kobayashi
my way, she'll get him her way.

1134
01:13:28,233 --> 01:13:29,553
Just do what I say.

1135
01:13:30,513 --> 01:13:31,633
Please.

1136
01:13:34,714 --> 01:13:35,874
Tell her that...

1137
01:13:39,675 --> 01:13:41,316
Tell her I tried.

1138
01:13:54,839 --> 01:13:56,159
McManus. He's on his way.

1139
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,760
I'm there.

1140
01:14:55,974 --> 01:14:57,695
Huh. Oswald was a fag.

1141
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:08,737
Hi.
How are you doing?

1142
01:15:11,618 --> 01:15:13,778
Is there... a problem?

1143
01:15:38,505 --> 01:15:39,225
Now...

1144
01:16:08,232 --> 01:16:09,232
Old McDonald...

1145
01:16:09,512 --> 01:16:10,832
...had a farm...

1146
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,513
...ee-aye, ee-aye, oh.

1147
01:16:14,433 --> 01:16:18,354
And on that farm
he shot some guys...

1148
01:16:18,754 --> 01:16:21,355
...ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing,
bang-boom.

1149
01:16:51,082 --> 01:16:52,243
Elvis has left the building.

1150
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:10,997
Why didn't you run?

1151
01:19:11,917 --> 01:19:12,877
I froze up.

1152
01:19:14,038 --> 01:19:16,758
I thought about Fenster and how
he looked when we buried him.

1153
01:19:17,318 --> 01:19:20,199
And I thought about Keaton.
It looked like he might pull it off.

1154
01:19:27,441 --> 01:19:30,081
A boy came across a body on the beach
this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned...

1155
01:19:30,282 --> 01:19:33,162
...shot twice in the head. Two guys
from the Bureau just identified him.

1156
01:19:33,362 --> 01:19:34,002
What else?

1157
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:37,163
His name was Arturo Marquez,
a petty smuggler from Argentina.

1158
01:19:37,363 --> 01:19:40,004
He was arrested last year
in New York for trafficking.

1159
01:19:40,204 --> 01:19:43,525
He escaped to California.
They picked him up in Long Beach...

1160
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,926
...they're setting up
extradition - he escapes again.

1161
01:19:47,126 --> 01:19:48,366
Now, get this...

1162
01:19:48,566 --> 01:19:51,807
Edie Finneran is brought in
to advice in the proceedings.

1163
01:19:52,127 --> 01:19:53,247
Kobayashi.

1164
01:19:53,447 --> 01:19:56,528
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony. He was a rat.

1165
01:19:56,728 --> 01:19:57,768
A big fucking rat.

1166
01:19:58,008 --> 01:20:00,569
Arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1167
01:20:00,769 --> 01:20:04,570
So much so that he named
close to 50 people.

1168
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:07,011
Guess who he named in finale?

1169
01:20:07,931 --> 01:20:09,331
Keyser Soze.

1170
01:20:09,611 --> 01:20:10,892
There's more.

1171
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:26,535
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1172
01:20:28,176 --> 01:20:30,536
There was no dope on that boat.

1173
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:11,626
Stay quiet!

1174
01:21:11,987 --> 01:21:14,707
He's here!
I know he's here!

1175
01:21:15,507 --> 01:21:17,388
That's him!
I'm telling you that's him!

1176
01:21:17,668 --> 01:21:19,308
I know he's here!

1177
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,709
You don't understand.
That's him...

1178
01:21:22,909 --> 01:21:24,029
- Shut up!
- That's him, you hear me?

1179
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:26,950
I'm telling you
it's Keyser Soze!

1180
01:23:21,578 --> 01:23:24,419
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know. There's no coke!

1181
01:23:25,819 --> 01:23:28,020
- What?
- You heard me, you dumb fuck. There's no coke!

1182
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,541
I checked the entire ship!
I've been in every fucking room!

1183
01:23:31,821 --> 01:23:34,021
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!

1184
01:23:34,262 --> 01:23:35,542
Nothing!

1185
01:23:35,862 --> 01:23:37,222
You're fucking me!

1186
01:23:37,422 --> 01:23:41,103
There is... no... fucking... coke!

1187
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:53,186
I'm outta here.

1188
01:24:32,596 --> 01:24:34,436
I told them nothing.

1189
01:24:35,397 --> 01:24:36,757
I swear.

1190
01:24:37,277 --> 01:24:39,638
I told them nothing.
Please!

1191
01:25:25,289 --> 01:25:27,009
McManus?
What the fuck is going on?

1192
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:31,170
Strangest thing...

1193
01:26:23,463 --> 01:26:26,344
That's what you said in your statement:
"A man in a suit with a slim build."

1194
01:26:26,544 --> 01:26:27,144
Wait a minute.

1195
01:26:27,384 --> 01:26:29,785
I don't have a minute.
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

1196
01:26:29,985 --> 01:26:31,785
You told the D.A. you
didn't know who it was!

1197
01:26:31,985 --> 01:26:33,626
I know there was
dope on that boat.

1198
01:26:33,826 --> 01:26:35,106
- Stop stalling, Verbal!
- I'm not stalling!

1199
01:26:35,306 --> 01:26:37,547
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.

1200
01:26:37,747 --> 01:26:39,747
I've got immunity, I don't
have to take that shit.

1201
01:26:39,947 --> 01:26:41,708
You know... what
I'm getting at, Verbal.

1202
01:26:41,908 --> 01:26:42,628
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1203
01:26:43,148 --> 01:26:44,348
Yes you do... the truth!

1204
01:26:44,548 --> 01:26:47,429
- Try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.
- I don't know what you're talking about. I did!

1205
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:48,989
You're lying to me!

1206
01:26:49,309 --> 01:26:51,510
You know. You've known
this whole fucking time!

1207
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,671
I don't know what you're saying.
I did see Keaton get shot, I swear to you.

1208
01:26:55,151 --> 01:26:57,752
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun! Why didn't you help him?

1209
01:26:58,032 --> 01:26:59,312
He was your friend!

1210
01:27:03,473 --> 01:27:05,433
Because I was afraid.
Ok? Afraid!

1211
01:27:08,274 --> 01:27:09,514
Afraid of what?

1212
01:27:11,155 --> 01:27:12,835
I know it was Keyser Soze!

1213
01:27:13,475 --> 01:27:16,756
It was Keyser Soze.
I mean, Agent Kujan, the devil himself.

1214
01:27:18,237 --> 01:27:20,517
How do you shoot
the devil in the back?

1215
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:26,639
What if you miss?

1216
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,480
All right.
Let's get back to the pier.

1217
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,940
Arturo Marquez.
Ever hear of him?

1218
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:56,381
What? No.

1219
01:28:56,701 --> 01:29:00,262
He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.

1220
01:29:00,542 --> 01:29:04,663
He swore out a statement to
Federal Marshals saying that he had seen...

1221
01:29:05,103 --> 01:29:06,503
...and could positively
identify one Keyser Soze.

1222
01:29:06,783 --> 01:29:10,224
It says right here in the report.
He had intimate knowledge of his businesses...

1223
01:29:10,464 --> 01:29:12,265
...including, but not exclusive to...

1224
01:29:12,585 --> 01:29:14,145
...drug trafficking and murder.

1225
01:29:14,385 --> 01:29:17,106
- I never heard of him.
- His own people were selling him...

1226
01:29:17,346 --> 01:29:18,226
...to a gang of Hungarians.

1227
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:21,947
Most likely the same Hungarians that
Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

1228
01:29:22,347 --> 01:29:23,507
The money wasn't there for dope.

1229
01:29:24,148 --> 01:29:26,348
The Hungarians were
going to buy the one guy...

1230
01:29:26,668 --> 01:29:28,309
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1231
01:29:28,589 --> 01:29:29,709
I said I never heard of him.

1232
01:29:30,029 --> 01:29:30,749
But Keaton did.

1233
01:29:31,109 --> 01:29:31,829
Edie Finneran was...

1234
01:29:32,109 --> 01:29:33,750
...Marquez' extradition advisor.

1235
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:35,630
She knew who he was
and what he knew.

1236
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:38,511
- I don't und--
- There were no drugs on that boat.

1237
01:29:38,751 --> 01:29:42,192
It was a hit. A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy...

1238
01:29:42,512 --> 01:29:44,393
...that could finger Keyser Soze.

1239
01:29:44,753 --> 01:29:46,473
So Soze put some thiefs to it.

1240
01:29:47,073 --> 01:29:49,114
Men he knew he could
march into certain death.

1241
01:29:49,594 --> 01:29:51,874
You say Soze sent us
to kill someone?

1242
01:29:52,995 --> 01:29:53,715
I'm saying Keaton did.

1243
01:29:54,195 --> 01:29:55,595
Verbal, he left you
behind for a reason.

1244
01:29:55,915 --> 01:29:57,556
Just do what I tell you.

1245
01:29:57,876 --> 01:30:00,677
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

1246
01:30:00,877 --> 01:30:04,317
...why did he give you the money to run?
He could have used you on the boat.

1247
01:30:04,717 --> 01:30:05,718
He wanted me to live.

1248
01:30:07,438 --> 01:30:09,239
A one time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world...

1249
01:30:09,519 --> 01:30:11,639
...finds it that it's hard to save...

1250
01:30:11,959 --> 01:30:13,120
...a worthless rat-cripple

1251
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,480
No, sir!
Why?

1252
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,320
Edie!

1253
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,921
I don't buy that reform
story for a minute!

1254
01:30:19,281 --> 01:30:21,562
Even if I did, I certainly
don't believe...

1255
01:30:21,802 --> 01:30:25,002
...he would send you to protect her.
So why?

1256
01:30:27,763 --> 01:30:29,404
Because he was my friend!

1257
01:30:29,684 --> 01:30:32,044
No, Verbal. He wasn't your friend.

1258
01:30:32,284 --> 01:30:33,605
Keaton didn't have friends!

1259
01:30:33,885 --> 01:30:34,685
What are you doing here?

1260
01:30:34,925 --> 01:30:35,885
He saved you...

1261
01:30:36,165 --> 01:30:38,566
...because he wanted it that way!
It was his will.

1262
01:30:39,286 --> 01:30:41,647
- Keaton was Keyser Soze!
- No!

1263
01:30:41,967 --> 01:30:43,687
The kind of man who could
wrangle the wills of men...

1264
01:30:43,967 --> 01:30:45,087
...like Hockney and McManus.

1265
01:30:45,327 --> 01:30:46,008
The kind of man...

1266
01:30:46,248 --> 01:30:48,128
...who could engineer
a police line-up...

1267
01:30:48,408 --> 01:30:50,129
...from all his years
of contacts in N.Y.P.D. .

1268
01:30:50,729 --> 01:30:52,849
The kind of man that could
have killed Edie Finneran!

1269
01:30:57,691 --> 01:31:00,411
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania.

1270
01:31:00,651 --> 01:31:02,452
Shot twice in the head.

1271
01:31:07,093 --> 01:31:09,173
What do you think
about Keaton now, Verbal?

1272
01:31:10,734 --> 01:31:13,494
- Edie...
- He used all of you...

1273
01:31:14,095 --> 01:31:15,655
...to get him on that boat.
He couldn't get on alone...

1274
01:31:15,855 --> 01:31:18,856
...he had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man.

1275
01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:21,456
The one man that could identify him.

1276
01:31:22,497 --> 01:31:24,137
This is all bullshit...

1277
01:31:24,377 --> 01:31:26,178
You said you saw him die?

1278
01:31:28,698 --> 01:31:29,538
Or did you?

1279
01:31:29,898 --> 01:31:31,779
You had to hide when you
first heard the police cars.

1280
01:31:32,099 --> 01:31:34,340
You said you heard
the shot before the fire.

1281
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:36,820
But you didn't see him die.

1282
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,421
I knew him.
He would never--

1283
01:31:38,621 --> 01:31:39,781
He programmed you!

1284
01:31:40,101 --> 01:31:42,261
He programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to!

1285
01:31:42,502 --> 01:31:44,462
He knew we were close,
you said it yourself.

1286
01:31:44,662 --> 01:31:47,463
Where was the political pressure coming from?
Why were you being protected?

1287
01:31:47,663 --> 01:31:50,343
It was Keaton!
Immunity was your reward!

1288
01:31:50,624 --> 01:31:52,184
Why me?

1289
01:31:52,664 --> 01:31:54,545
Why not Fenster or
McManus or Hockney?

1290
01:31:54,745 --> 01:31:57,105
Why me? I'm stupid,
I'm a cripple! Why me?

1291
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:58,666
Because you're
a cripple, Verbal.

1292
01:31:59,186 --> 01:32:02,546
Because you're stupid.
Because you're weaker than them.

1293
01:32:07,028 --> 01:32:08,188
If he's dead...

1294
01:32:08,748 --> 01:32:11,989
...if what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1295
01:32:13,949 --> 01:32:16,590
It was his idea to hit the
taxi service in New York, wasn't it?

1296
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:17,990
Come on, tell me
the truth.

1297
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:19,791
It was all Keaton!

1298
01:32:21,111 --> 01:32:23,832
We followed him
from the beginning.

1299
01:32:25,272 --> 01:32:26,232
I didn't know.

1300
01:32:26,872 --> 01:32:28,753
I saw him die.

1301
01:32:29,273 --> 01:32:32,314
I believe he's dead.
Oh, Christ!

1302
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:34,994
You're not safe
on your own.

1303
01:32:39,155 --> 01:32:40,156
You think he's--

1304
01:32:40,516 --> 01:32:41,916
Keyser Soze?

1305
01:32:42,796 --> 01:32:44,357
I don't know, Verbal.

1306
01:32:45,837 --> 01:32:49,318
Keyser Soze is a shield.
Like you said, a spook story.

1307
01:32:50,678 --> 01:32:54,119
But I know Keaton.
And someone is out there pulling strings for you.

1308
01:32:54,799 --> 01:32:56,000
Stay here and
let us protect you.

1309
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,160
No way. I'm not bait.
I post today.

1310
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,641
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1311
01:33:00,321 --> 01:33:02,241
Capt. Leo wants you
out of here A.S.A.P. ...

1312
01:33:02,601 --> 01:33:05,322
- ...unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances, thank you.

1313
01:33:05,682 --> 01:33:09,043
If someone wants to get you...
they're gonna get you out there.

1314
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:12,484
Turn states evidence.
You might never see trial.

1315
01:33:12,724 --> 01:33:14,044
May be so.

1316
01:33:15,444 --> 01:33:17,605
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

1317
01:33:33,289 --> 01:33:35,009
Fucking cops.

1318
01:33:58,175 --> 01:34:00,575
Excuse me.
Can I use your fax machine?

1319
01:34:04,416 --> 01:34:06,137
You have to sign for these.

1320
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:10,778
One watch, gold.

1321
01:34:11,058 --> 01:34:13,019
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1322
01:34:13,899 --> 01:34:15,739
And a pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1323
01:34:16,459 --> 01:34:18,500
You still got nothing, Dave.

1324
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,900
I know what I wanted
to know about Keaton.

1325
01:34:21,101 --> 01:34:22,581
Just nothing.

1326
01:34:23,021 --> 01:34:26,102
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

1327
01:34:26,942 --> 01:34:29,543
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...

1328
01:34:29,783 --> 01:34:32,383
...if Keaton is alive,
he's not coming up again.

1329
01:34:32,983 --> 01:34:34,584
I'll find him.

1330
01:34:35,144 --> 01:34:36,704
Waste of time.

1331
01:34:39,185 --> 01:34:41,666
A rumor is not a rumor
that doesn't die.

1332
01:34:41,986 --> 01:34:42,986
What?

1333
01:34:44,106 --> 01:34:44,946
Nothing.

1334
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:48,507
Man, you're a slob.

1335
01:34:48,707 --> 01:34:51,468
Yeah, but all has a system, Dave.

1336
01:34:51,908 --> 01:34:55,349
It all makes sense when you look at it right.
You've got to stand back from it, you know?

1337
01:34:57,549 --> 01:35:00,230
You want to see a real horror show?
You should see my garage.

1338
01:35:36,199 --> 01:35:37,919
Convince me. And tell me every last detail...

1339
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,440
You know, back when I was in that
barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

1340
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,160
Where's your head, Agent Kujan?

1341
01:35:42,481 --> 01:35:43,401
What we need to do is think.

1342
01:35:43,681 --> 01:35:44,521
Think back.

1343
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:46,041
I'm sure you've heard many tall tales...

1344
01:35:46,281 --> 01:35:47,642
- Bricks Marlin.
- This isn't right.

1345
01:35:47,922 --> 01:35:48,922
- I just want to hear your story.
- Tell me every last detail.

1346
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:51,483
It's all there.
And I'm telling it all straight, I swear.

1347
01:35:51,963 --> 01:35:53,723
- Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
- A gift...

1348
01:35:54,043 --> 01:35:55,644
- ...from Mr. Soze.
- Talk to me, Verbal.

1349
01:35:56,124 --> 01:35:57,204
What about Redfoot?

1350
01:35:57,564 --> 01:35:58,965
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

1351
01:35:59,565 --> 01:36:02,085
- ...using pawns...
- Big, fat guy. I mean, like orca-fat.

1352
01:36:05,766 --> 01:36:08,727
Back when I was picking beans in
Guatemala, we used to make fresh coffee...

1353
01:36:09,087 --> 01:36:10,287
...he was a good man...

1354
01:36:10,607 --> 01:36:11,288
I know he was good.

1355
01:36:14,168 --> 01:36:15,889
Tell me every last detail.

1356
01:36:16,129 --> 01:36:16,729
Strangest thing.

1357
01:36:17,009 --> 01:36:18,329
How do you shoot
the devil in the back?

1358
01:36:18,849 --> 01:36:20,450
...this guy is protected
from up on high...

1359
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:21,970
...by the prince
of darkness.

1360
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:23,771
What about it, pretzel-man?
What's your story.

1361
01:36:24,131 --> 01:36:25,811
- There was a lawyer...
- What lawyer, Verbal?

1362
01:36:26,091 --> 01:36:27,532
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

1363
01:36:29,092 --> 01:36:30,532
Tell me every last detail.

1364
01:36:30,732 --> 01:36:31,973
I work for Keyser Soze.

1365
01:36:32,173 --> 01:36:34,213
Convince me.

1366
01:36:49,057 --> 01:36:53,018
Every creeping scumbag that works the street
for a living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1367
01:36:53,618 --> 01:36:55,098
The cripple!
Did you see him?

1368
01:36:55,338 --> 01:36:56,779
The cripple!
Which way did he go?

1369
01:36:56,979 --> 01:36:58,139
Oh, he went out that way.

1370
01:36:58,419 --> 01:37:00,660
I know you know something.

1371
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,540
I'm smarter than you,
and I'm gonna find out what I want to know...

1372
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:04,221
...wether you like it or not.

1373
01:37:04,421 --> 01:37:07,541
To a cop the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.

1374
01:37:08,382 --> 01:37:10,582
There's no mistery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it all.

1375
01:37:10,862 --> 01:37:12,943
Somebody with power...

1376
01:37:13,143 --> 01:37:15,183
Keyser Soze!

1377
01:37:16,344 --> 01:37:20,585
You think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out?

1378
01:37:22,145 --> 01:37:24,946
Because you're stupid, Verbal!
Because you're a cripple!

1379
01:37:25,146 --> 01:37:26,386
What I want to know
is who's the gimp.

1380
01:37:26,586 --> 01:37:28,787
You know.
You've known the whole fucking time!

1381
01:37:29,587 --> 01:37:31,427
If he comes up for anything,
it will be to get rid of me.

1382
01:37:32,868 --> 01:37:36,068
I can't feel my legs... Keyser.

1383
01:37:36,269 --> 01:37:39,469
First thing I learned on the job,
you know what it was?

1384
01:37:39,829 --> 01:37:42,790
He mentioned Keyser Soze?

1385
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:44,591
Who?

1386
01:37:44,831 --> 01:37:46,271
After that...

1387
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:49,432
...my guess is you'll never
hear from him again.

1388
01:38:09,317 --> 01:38:11,517
The greatest trick
the devil ever pulled...

1389
01:38:11,717 --> 01:38:14,238
...was convincing the
world he didn't exist.

1390
01:38:16,278 --> 01:38:17,199
And like that...

1391
01:38:18,919 --> 01:38:20,479
...he's gone.
