00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:50,342
In 1995, a boy named Andy got a
Buzz Lightyear toy for his birthday.

2
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,889
It was from his favorite movie.

3
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,645
This is that movie.

00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,939
<i>Buzz Lightyear mission log.

7
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,108
<i>Sensors have detected
potential life forms.</i>

8
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,401
<i>on an uncharted planet.</i>

9
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,612
<i>So, we're making a detour to investigate.</i>

10
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,039
<i>Space Rangers will make
initial evaluation,</i>

11
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,208
<i>then assess whether it's worth
waking the science crew</i>

12
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,459
<i>from their hyper-sleep.</i>

13
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,294
<i>While the ERIC takes core samples</i>

14
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:13,217
<i>I will explore further the oddities
of this strange planet.</i>

15
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,901
<i>Terrain seems a bit unstable.</i>

16
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,612
<i>No read-out yet if the area is breathable.</i>

17
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,865
<i>There seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.</i>

18
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,742
<i>-Who are you talking to?
-No one.</i>

19
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,160
<i>You were narrating again.</i>

20
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,913
<i>I was not. Just doing the mission log.</i>

21
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,249
<i>You do know no one ever listens to them.</i>

22
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,793
<i>I know that, narrating
helps me with focus.</i>

23
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,545
<i>-Stay sharp.
-Yeah.</i>

24
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,964
<i>Well, if it bothers you,
Commander Hawthorne.</i>

25
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,632
<i>I'm happy to wait
back on the turnip.</i>

26
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,175
<i>Please don't call it the turnip.</i>

27
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,052
<i>But the ship looks
like a root vegetable.</i>

28
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,222
<i>Yes, you made that very clear
at the design review.</i>

29
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,733
<i>How long have you known
that I narrate?</i>

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,944
<i>Forever.
Since you and I were cadets.</i>

31
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,196
<i>Speaking of,
you forgot to take the rookie with you.</i>

32
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,616
<i>Ah, Commander Hawthorne, you know
how I feel about rookies.</i>

33
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,493
<i>It's the same way I feel about autopilots.</i>

34
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,246
<i>"How may I assist you?
Is there anything I can do, sir?"</i>

35
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,540
<i>They don't help,
they just over-complicate things.</i>

36
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,458
<i>I'm better off just doing the job myself.</i>

37
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,210
<i>Which is why I brought the rookie.</i>

38
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,671
<i>Hello.</i>

39
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,924
<i>-No.
-Buzz, protocol requires we bring him along.</i>

40
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,301
<i>-He's gonna have sad eyes.
-Buzz.</i>

41
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,927
<i>You know I can't deal with sad eyes.</i>

42
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,137
<i>-Look at the rookie, Buzz.
-No.</i>

43
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,972
<i>-Look at the roo...Look...
-No...no.</i>

44
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:42,890
<i>-Lightyear.
-No.</i>

45
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,057
<i>-Look at him.
-Not looking.</i>

46
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:44,975
<i>-Look. Look.
-No.</i>

47
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,436
<i>-Look at the rookie.
-No. No.</i>

48
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,066
<i>All right. All right. You win.</i>

49
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,654
<i>Look, Feather...Featheringhamstan...</i>

50
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,697
<i>It's Featheringhamstan, sir.</i>

51
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,116
<i>Look, rookie, first,
you will not speak unless spoken to.</i>

52
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,201
<i>-Yes, sir.
-Still talking.</i>

53
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,203
<i>Second, respect the suit.</i>

54
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,079
<i>This suit means something.</i>

55
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,082
<i>It's not just protecting your body,
it's protecting the universe.</i>

56
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,400
<i>This suit is a promise
to the world that you,</i>

57
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,547
<i>and you alone will
do one thing above all.</i>

58
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,881
<i>Finnish the mission no matter the cost.</i>

59
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,884
<i>You will never quit, whatever
the galaxy may throw your way--</i>

60
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,511
<i>Will you please turn that off!</i>

61
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,013
<i>It's just too easy.</i>

62
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,140
<i>You're mocking me, aren't you?</i>

63
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,392
<i>Yeah, but in a supportive way.</i>

64
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,604
<i>Look, what I'm trying to say, Commander,
is that you and I have this job down.</i>

65
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,897
<i>-Sir.
-Still talking.</i>

66
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,691
<i>At any moment I know what you're thinking,
I know where you're gonna be.</i>

67
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,318
<i>But this guy, I don't know.</i>

68
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,569
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

69
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,155
<i>You see?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.</i>

70
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,865
<i>He's not helping. He's wandered off.</i>

71
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,700
<i>Vines!</i>

72
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:53,919
<i>Bugs!</i>

73
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,052
<i>The ship. It's sinking.</i>

74
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,512
<i>Everyone, back to the turnip!</i>

75
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,013
<i>Oh, so now it's the turnip.</i>

76
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,567
<i>Engage Stealth Mode.
That should buy us enough time.</i>

77
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,489
<i>We're not gonna make it.</i>

78
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,991
<i>Almost there!</i>

79
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,619
<i>Okay, plan B. Ready?</i>

80
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,537
<i>Go!</i>

81
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,555
<i>-Blast!
-Here, I can re-route it.</i>

82
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,723
<i>Just give me a minute.</i>

83
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,099
<i>Where is the...</i>

84
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,517
<i>Help!</i>

85
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:53,937
<i>rookie.</i>

86
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,314
<i>Help me!</i>

87
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,193
<i>Buzz Lightyear mission log.
The planet is clearly uninhabitable.</i>

88
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,736
<i>In fact, outright hostile.</i>

89
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,364
<i>The sentient foliage
have apprehended cadet Furth-Feathering...</i>

90
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,573
<i>Featheringston...Feather...</i>

91
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:06,537
<i>They got the rookie,</i>

92
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:09,178
<i>who I strongly suggested
should not have joined in the first--</i>

93
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,372
<i>Blast.</i>

94
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,588
<i>-Buzz!
-Now!</i>

95
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,937
<i>Move it, ranger!</i>

96
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,149
<i>Making our way back to the ship.</i>

97
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,692
<i>Come on, Buzz!</i>

98
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,737
<i>Hurry!</i>

99
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,369
<i>All good at the engine room.</i>

100
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,537
<i>-I'll take the helm.
-And I will--</i>

101
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,829
<i>Do nothing.
I've got this.</i>

102
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,300
<i>How may I assist you?</i>

103
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,218
<i>Autopilots.</i>

104
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,886
<i>-Is there anything I can do, sir?
-No and no!</i>

105
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,054
<i>This is not a simulation.</i>

106
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,683
<i>Commander, status!</i>

107
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,684
<i>Fuel engaged.</i>

108
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,893
<i>All systems go.</i>

109
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,610
<i>Warning. Launch trajectory unsound.</i>

110
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,448
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

111
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,660
<i>Collision imminent.</i>

112
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,161
<i>Abort. Abort.</i>

113
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,629
<i>Captain Lightyear,
do you need my help?</i>

114
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,256
<i>-Negative.
-Are you sure?</i>

115
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,967
<i>I'm Buzz Lightyear.
I'm always sure.</i>

116
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:06,074
s.ub by su.b .T

117
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,468
It's bad, Buzz.

118
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,515
The hyper-speed crystal
was totally destroyed.

119
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,434
Long story short:
we're marooned.

120
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,306
I don't know.

121
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,398
What are you doing?

122
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,775
I'm court-martialing myself.

123
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:45,943
No. You're not.

124
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,530
Commander Hawthorne, I hereby
relieve myself of all Space Ranger duties.

125
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,115
This was my fault.
And these people deserve better.

126
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,867
You can throw me in the brig.

127
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,411
Finish the mission, Buzz.

128
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,621
That's what we do.

129
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,123
We're not done
until everyone gets home.

130
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,750
But we have no fuel crystal.

131
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,753
So we mine resources on this planet,
create a new crystal.

132
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,630
Crystalic fusion is highly unstable.

133
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,756
Then we test it.

134
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,633
No. It's too dangerous.

135
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,010
Manufacturing a crystal
capable of hyper-speed

136
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,388
is like trying to lasso with the sun.

137
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,684
And then someone would need
to attach that sun to a ship,

138
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:22,980
and then the ship needs someone to fly it
without blowing themselves into oblivion.

139
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,023
Who in their right mind would...

140
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,369
<i>Buzz Lightyear mission log.
Star date 3902.</i>

141
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,803
<i>After a full year of being marooned,</i>

142
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,042
<i>our specialized crew</i>

143
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:44,043
<i>have put this planet's vast resources
to incredible use.</i>

144
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:50,591
<i>Finally, our first
hyper-speed test flight is a go.</i>

145
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,527
Ready, Captain Lightyear?

146
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,071
Ready as I'll ever be,
Commander Hawthorne.

147
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,239
To infinity.

148
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,490
And beyond.

149
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,370
-Buzz!
-We got a breach in the perimeter.

150
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,667
Come on, I just...

151
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,668
Captain Lightyear!

152
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,128
Airman Diaz.

153
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,506
Boy, the vines
are a little feisty today, huh?

154
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,673
Are we ready to launch?

155
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,592
We're all ready
if you are, sir.

156
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,930
A year of work for a four minute flight.
Isn't that something?

157
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,097
Sure is.

158
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,767
Well, let's go find out
if this new hyper-speed fuel is stable.

159
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,810
So I can get us off
this rock.

160
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,396
I almost forgot.
Here's your I.V.A.N, sir.

161
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,606
Fully loaded.

162
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,191
Autopilots.

163
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,777
And here, of course, is the XL-01.

164
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,946
Pretty sweet ride.

165
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,782
Now let's get you that fuel crystal.

166
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,992
<i>Good morning,
Captain Lightyear.</i>

167
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,915
<i>Here is your specially formulated
fuel mixture.</i>

168
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,002
So, this is the fuel
that's gonna reach hyper-speed?

169
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,630
<i>It has an 87.6 percent chance.</i>

170
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,382
I'll take those odds.

171
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,099
Good luck, Captain.

172
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,059

175
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:37,990
Copy, XL-01.

176
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,117
I'm gonna grant you four minutes
to be off planet,

177
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,119

<i>Course corrected.</i>

242
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,226
<i>You failed to reach hyper-speed.</i>

243
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:35,894
<i>I didn't need to hear that, I.V.A.N.</i>

244
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,020
<i>You didn't hear that?</i>

245
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,188
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. I'll repeat.</i>

246
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,649
<i>-No, I've heard-- I meant--
-You failed to reach hyper-speed.</i>

247
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:41,859
<i>-Thank you, I.V.A.N.
-You failed to reach--</i>

248
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,091
Commander, are you okay?

249
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,261
Diaz, you grew a beard.

250
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,637
How did you grow a beard?

251
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,847
Oh, right.

252
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,640
First of, welcome back.

253
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,851
Secondly...

254
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:16,977
Wait.

255
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,354
Wait, what is this?

256
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:20,974
How long was I gone?

257
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,150
Four years, two months and three days.

258
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,735
What?

259
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,069
I thought we've lost you, Buzz.

260
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,405
Alisha, what happened?

261
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,616
-Time dilation.
-What?

262
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,659
<i>Time dilation is quite simple.</i>

263
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:36,705
<i>As you approached hyper-speed,
your time slowed relative to our own.</i>

264
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,208
<i>So, during your mission
you aged only minutes,</i>

265
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,251
<i>while the rest of us
have aged years.</i>

266
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,045
<i>Simply put:
The faster you fly--</i>

267
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:46,590
The faster I fly
the further into the future I travel.

268
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:47,883
I get it.

269
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,514
So, what are we gonna do now?

270
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,806
I don't know.

271
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,392
But I think we should hold off
on any more test flights

272
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,436
until we've figured out something else.

273
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,730
Commander, we said finish the mission.

274
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,106
That's what Space Rangers do.

275
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,691
At what cost, Buzz?

276
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,319
Are you willing to lose another four years?

277
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,953
So, everyone is just stuck here

278
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,121
because of me.

279
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,300
Hey, you all right?

280
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,053
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

281
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,430
Wait, what's that?

282
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,850
Oh, I got engaged.

283
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,853
Oh, wow. That's great.
What's her name?

284
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,647
Kiko. She's one of the science crew.

285
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:47,727
It's funny, it never would've mattered
if we hadn't been stranded.

286
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,112
You got engaged to someone you just met?

287
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,031
Buzz, I met her three years ago.

288
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,409
Oh, right. Right.

289
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,870
Well, Congratulations.
I'd love to meet her.

290
00:17:58,154 --> 00:18:00,873
Well, there's plenty of time for that.
Get some rest.

291
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,292
That's an order.

292
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,425
YOU'RE WELCOME!

Oh, that's very considerate of you,

299
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,331
But no thank you.

300
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,249
<i>I'm afraid it's protocol.</i>

<i>Sensors indicate
you've missed four birthdays.</i>

302
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,505
<i>Would you like a frosted snack kit
to celebrate?</i>

303
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,299
Negative. That would compromise
my nutritional regiment.

304
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,971
<i>We can talk about your feelings.
I am an excellent listener.</i>

305
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,267
No, no. Look,
I've had a very long... day?

306
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,727
It did not go as planned.

307
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,771
<i>The mission was unsuccessful?</i>

308
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,356
Affirmative.

309
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,984

-No, thank you.
<i>-Are you sure?</i>

314
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,953
<i>I can create a game specifically for you,
based on your exact personality profile.</i>

315
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,580
Hey, listen, Sox, buddy, I'm pretty tired.

316
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,250
So, I'm gonna go ahead
and hit the rack.

317
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,960
<i>Of course.</i>

318
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,965
<i>I can provide sleep sounds if you like.</i>

319
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,633
<i>I have several options.</i>

<i>Summer night,

00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:54,653
<i>No. I can do it.</i>

328
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,821
Buzz, are you sure?

329
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,322
<i>I'm afraid it's protocol.</i>

330
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:58,699
I can do it!

331
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,743
I can do it.

332
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,996
<i>Censors indicate you had a nightmare.</i>

333
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,623

-Negative.

00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,376
<i>Okay, but remember,

335
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,044
<i>And I'm not giving up on my mission.</i>

Yeah?

337
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,256
Yeah.

338
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:17,342
You know what, Sox,
I'm not giving up on my mission either.

339
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,678
<i>Great! So what can I do?</i>

340
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,265
Well, why won't you engage
with your mouse buddy.

341
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,894
<i>Is there anything more challenging?</i>

342
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,437
You want a challenge? Okay.

343
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,106
I guess you could work
on this fuel stability thing.

344
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,610
<i>Crystalic fusion. Of course.</i>

345
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,111
<i>When should I expect you back?</i>

346
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,113
About four years.

347
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,825
Hold on. You don't have to do this.

348
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,619
Commander, this is my mistake.

349
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,078
I need to make it right.

350
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,456
Okay, but maybe
we should think about this.

351
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,292
Think about what?
Come on, we're Space Rangers.

352
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,044
We finish the mission.

353
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,589
Well, it would be nice
to wear the suit again.

354
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,258
People are starting to forget
Space Rangers ever mattered.

355
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,677
<i>Well, I'm about to fix that.</i>

356
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,137
<i>To infinity.</i>

357
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:03,764
And beyond.

358
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,772
UNSTABLE

359
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:21,884
HAPPY 40TH ANNIVERSARY

360
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:27,931
UNSTABLE

361
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,709
<i>Hi, Buzz.</i>

362
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,005
<i>You're back here
in a year or two...</i>

363
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,967
<i>and, well, I won't.</i>

364
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,386
<i>I don't know when it happened</i>

365
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:10,516
<i>but I seem to have gone
and gotten very old.</i>

366
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,187
<i>I always thought we'd get to be
Space Rangers again.</i>

367
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,274
<i>I miss being out
among the stars.</i>

368
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,360
<i>All the adventures.</i>

369
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,031
<i>But more than any of that</i>

370
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,242
<i>I missed you.</i>

371
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:31,787
<i>Hi, Grandma.</i>

372
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,581
<i>Hey, sweetheart.</i>

373
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,459
<i>I'm leaving a message
for my friend, Buzz.</i>

374
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,627
<i>The Space Ranger?</i>

375
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,712
<i>That's right.</i>

376
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,631
<i>He's in space right now.</i>

377
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:43,799
<i>Wow.</i>

378
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,093
<i>This is my granddaughter, Izzy.</i>

379
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,220
<i>I'm gonna be a Space Ranger too.</i>

380
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,388
<i>Just like him?</i>

381
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,931
<i>Just like you.</i>

382
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,687
<i>Goodbye, Buzz.</i>

383
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:01,233
<i>I'm sorry I won't be there
to see you finish the mission.</i>

384
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:05,571
<i>To infinity.</i>

385
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,449
And beyond.

386
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,237
Knock. Knock. Sorry to interrupt.
I'm just moving into my new-

387
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,743
Look at that!
The actual Buzz Lightyear in the flesh.

388
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,911
Affirmative.

389
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,548
Commander Cal Burnside.

390
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,414
I was a big fan of your when I was a kid.

391
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:01,585
Well, then I look forward to working
with you to finally get us out of here.

392
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,379
Did no one tell you?

393
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:05,756
Tell me what?

394
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:07,174
Yeah.

395
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,288
That was the last mission, Buzz.

396
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,238
What?

397
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:13,430
We've decided we gonna go ahead
and stay right here.

398
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:15,933
Wait, here? Negative,
that is not a viable option.

399
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,061
It is now. See, we're building this.

400
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,105
Laser shield.

401
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,525
It'll keep all the creeters out.

402
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,903
And we'll just tuck right in here
and make do with what we've got.

403
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,864
Make do? No. Wait.
But you don't understand, Commander.

404
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,492
I can still do it.
I can get us outta here.

405
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,577
Man, it's great you still believe that.

406
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,995
But we're good, Buzz.

407
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,956
Got the laser shield.

408
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,754
<i>Oh. Hello, Buzz.</i>

409
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,590
<i>Buzz?</i>

410
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,597
<i>Well, I've got some good news, Buzz.</i>

411
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,183
<i>I figured out the fuel problem.</i>

412
00:25:58,517 --> 00:25:59,601
What?

413
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,562
<i>It was an interesting combination.</i>

414
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,481
<i>Just the slightest variance,
but that made all the difference.</i>

415
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:07,276
Sox, how did you do this?

416
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:11,530
<i>It took me 62 years, seven months
and five days.</i>

417
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,031
And it's stable?

418
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:14,241
<i>Theoretically.</i>

419
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,828
<i>I look forward to finding out
on your next mission.</i>

420
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,289
Yeah...

421
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:24,960
What?

422
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:27,546
Evening, Captain. We're here
to pick up your companion robot.

423
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,131
What do you mean?

424
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,592
Security purposes.
You understand.

425
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,510
No, actually, I don't.

426
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:36,889
Shutting down the program,
So, we have to decommission your cat.

427
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,265
It'll just take a second.

428
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:39,850
Now, hold on, just...

429
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,063
At least let me do it.

430
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,241
Whoa?

431
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,165
<i>Buzz. Where are we going?</i>

432
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,333
We're going to space.

433
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,626
<i>What?</i>

434
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,837
<i>Buzz Lightyear mission log. Star date...</i>

435
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,005
<i>I have no idea.</i>

436
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:12,257
<i>In possession of stable fuel formula</i>

437
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:15,135
<i>I plan to reach hyper-speed
and this time finally finish the mission.</i>

438
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,637
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

439
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:17,804
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

440
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:21,475
<i>Buzz, my programming compels me
to notify Star Command that you have gone--</i>

441
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,227
<i>Star Command was gonna decommission you.</i>

442
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,311
<i>-What?
-That's right.</i>

443
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,188
<i>Lights out.
No more Sox.</i>

444
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,149
Hey! You're not authorized
to be in this area--

445
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,612
<i>Whoa, I didn't know you could do that.</i>

446
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,114
<i>Wait a minute, was that for me
in case I got out of line?</i>

447
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,407
<i>I bought you five minutes.</i>

448
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,842
<i>-All right, Sox, give me the first one.
-Roger.</i>

449
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:12,901
<i>Okay, here it goes.</i>

450
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,698
<i>Wow.</i>

451
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,202
<i>The formula!</i>

452
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,063
Tango to Base. Tango to Base.
Security breach in the launch peg.

453
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:51,398
<i>Blast.</i>

454
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:54,026
We have a guard down. Repeat.
We have a guard down.

455
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:57,988
<i>Okay.</i>

456
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,323
<i>Hello.</i>

457
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:02,200
<i>-I'm your internal voice-activated navigator.
-No! I.V.A.N.! No.</i>

458
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:03,410
-Do you hear that?
<i>-Call me I.V.A.N.</i>

459
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,038
Mission Control,
activity detected in XL-15.

460
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:07,581
<i>Investigating.</i>

461
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:08,749
Roger that.

462
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,626
XL-15, this is the control.

463
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,960
<i>Is there someone in there?</i>

464
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,712
<i>-Say something.
-XL-15.</i>

465
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,088
<i>Please respond.</i>

466
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:19,092
<i>Copy, control.
Just... the cleaning crew.</i>

467
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,513
<i>We're cleaning the cockpit.
Cleaning items in here?</i>

468
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:26,517
Commander, did we authorize
the cockpit cleaning for the XL-15?

469
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:28,268
What? No.

470
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,690
-Stop! Come back!
-Wait!

471
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:38,195
XL-15, you are in violation
of Star Command protocol.

472
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:39,571
<i>Cease your actions immediately.</i>

473
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,575
<i>Open this hatch!</i>

474
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,453
Commander, it's Captain Lightyear.

475
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,830
Wait? What? Lightyear?
Get him out of there!

476
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,542
Stop right now and put your hands
over your head!

477
00:29:57,214 --> 00:29:58,048
Back up.

478
00:29:58,215 --> 00:29:59,591
<i>-We need back up.</i>
-Get the Zap patrol.

479
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:03,720
<i>All right, team. Let's go.</i>

480
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:10,853
Override the silo doors.
He isn't going anywhere.

481
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:14,147
<i>Blast.</i>

482
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:16,024
<i>Unauthorized.</i>

483
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,906
<i>-Unauthorized.
-Come on, we're sitting ducks here.</i>

484
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,074
<i>Allow me.</i>

485
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:30,372
-Wait, what's happening?
-He overrode my override.

486
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:31,373
How?

487
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,721
Lightyear!

488
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:46,930
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

489
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:48,307
Return the ship to base right now!

490
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:49,308
<i>Or so help me--</i>

491
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:52,561
<i>Sox, let's break this hyper-speed barrier
and get everyone home.</i>

492
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:07,743
<i>Approaching 70 percent hyper-speed.</i>

493
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,792
<i>Approaching 80 percent hyper-speed.</i>

494
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:17,252
<i>Fuel stable.</i>

495
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:21,465
<i>Ninety percent hyper-speed.</i>

496
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,141
<i>One hundred percent hyper-speed.</i>

497
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,703
<i>Congratulations, Captain Lightyear.</i>

498
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,789
<i>You have achieved hyper-speed.</i>

499
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,877
<i>We did it.
Sox, we did it!</i>

500
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,212
<i>Congratulations, Buzz.</i>

501
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:02,798
<i>That was utterly terrifying,
and I regret having joined you.</i>

502
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,007
<i>No, no.</i>

503
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:07,177
<i>What is it, Buzz?</i>

504
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,887
<i>Our velocity is still extremely high.</i>

505
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,472
<i>What? Oh no!</i>

506
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:11,640
<i>Are we gonna crash?</i>

507
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:12,808
<i>No.</i>

508
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:15,352
<i>Well, technically yes.
Just hang on.</i>

509
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:37,499
<i>After all these years.
Thank you, Sox.</i>

510
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:43,088
<i>Mission log, supplemental.</i>

511
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,633
<i>After borrowing a ship from Star Command
I've achieved hyper-speed.</i>

512
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,595
<i>And I'm ready to finally leave
this planet once and for all.</i>

513
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,891
<i>Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
Come in, Star Command.</i>

514
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,101
<i>Star Command, come in.</i>

515
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,103
<i>Why don't they answer?</i>

516
00:32:58,937 --> 00:32:59,938
<i>Hey!</i>

517
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:01,106
<i>The robots.</i>

518
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:02,441
<i>The what?</i>

519
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,776
<i>The robots.</i>

520
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:22,002
<i>Wait, what's it doing?</i>

521
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,555
<i>Zurg.</i>

522
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,382
<i>-My ship!
-Be quiet.</i>

523
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,550
<i>Where'd it go?</i>

524
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:30,552
<i>Up there.</i>

525
00:34:11,078 --> 00:34:12,449
<i>Zurg.</i>

526
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,228
<i>Where is the pilot?</i>

527
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,065
What is that?
What is going on?

528
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:26,525
<i>Get down.</i>

529
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,405
<i>Shoot! Come on.</i>

530
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,577
<i>They must have seen
your ship land too.</i>

531
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:38,328
-Who?
<i>-The robots.</i>

532
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:41,206
Why are there robots?
Where did the robots come from?

533
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,248
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

534
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,208
I came from here.

535
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,751
<i>Here? Wait.</i>

536
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,507
<i>Buzz?</i>

537
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:53,177
Alisha?

538
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,263
Oh, no, that's my grandmother. I'm Izzy.

539
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,431
Izzy?

540
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,309
But you were just a little...

541
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:01,560
Sox, how long
were we gone?

542
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:02,728
<i>Meow meow.</i>

543
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:05,314
<i>Twenty-two years, 19 weeks and four days.</i>

544
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,481
Wow.

545
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:07,649
Wait.

546
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:10,360
Come on.

547
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,530
In here.

548
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:19,244
I thought I heard one.

549
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:20,787
-A robot?
-Yeah.

550
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,331
Impressive.

551
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,291
Well, I am a Hawthorne.

552
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:25,459
You sure are.

553
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:28,462
You know, your grandma and I could
practically finish each other's sentences.

554
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,797
If you're anything like her,
you and I are gonna make--

555
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,466
-...a great team.
-...some robots cry.

556
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,593
Okay...

557
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,596
So, get me up to speed on this.

558
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,182
Right. The Zurg ship showed up
about a week ago.

559
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:41,350
What's a Zurg?

560
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:45,312
That's the only thing the robots say,
so that's what we call the big ship.

561
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:49,525
The Zurg ship arrived,
the robots surrounded the base, and then...

562
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:53,070
<i>Citizens of T'kani Prime,
robot aliens have attacked.</i>

563
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,821
<i>Everyone inside the perimeter.</i>

564
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:55,864
<i>Look out!</i>

565
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,116
<i>We are activating
the laser shield immediately.</i>

566
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:01,620
And that's the last we heard.

567
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,750
All these people,
they were counting on me.

568
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,628
And now they're trapped.

569
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:13,757
We've tried to reach them,
but there's no communication, in or out.

570
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:14,925
Sox?

571
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,844
<i>Meow meow.
She's correct.</i>

572
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,464
Did you check me against your cat?

573
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,473
Well, he's not your standard-issue feline.

574
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,642
Actually, Sox was a gift
from your grandmother.

575
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,936
<i>-Hello, Izzy.</i>
-Hello, Sox.

576
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:29,690
Hey, what's that noise?
Come on, don't break my cat.

577
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,608
He's purring.
He likes it.

578
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:32,776
Sox, do you like it?

579
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:33,944
<i>I do.</i>

580
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:38,031
Well, I hope you're ready for action.
Because all we needed was a pilot.

581
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,199
For what?

582
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,410
I have a plan and I have a team.

583
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:45,664
<i>Come on!</i>

584
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,692
All right, team, fall in.

585
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:20,574
I found a pilot.
Operation Surprise Party is a go.

586
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,663
I like this. An elite squad.
The best of the best.

587
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,584
You know, her grandmother was the greatest
Space Ranger in the history of the Corps.

588
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,044
It will be an honor
to work with you.

589
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:33,837
Come on, gather round, team.

590
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:37,966
Let's review our objectives.

591
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,134
<i>Kill the robots.</i>

592
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:40,302
<i>And don't die.</i>

593
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,597
<i>"Don't die" is just something
you wanna do every day.</i>

594
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:44,765
<i>It's still an objective.</i>

595
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,767
If I may, we have one objective.

596
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,853
We need to put this crystal
in the turnip and get outta here.

597
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,606
So, to do that we have
to get onto the base.

598
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,108
<i>To do that we have to kill
all the robots.</i>

599
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:57,611
To do that we have to destroy
the Zurg ship.

600
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:00,572
<i>And to do any of that
we have to not die.</i>

601
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:03,324
DERIC

602
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:05,661
<i>Allow me to explain
Operation Surprise Party.</i>

603
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,580
<i>It is a variation
on Operation Thunder Spear.</i>

604
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:09,998
Didn't you get a medal for that one?

605
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,792
Two, actually, but...

606
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,169
Wait, how do you know
about Operation Thunder Spear?

607
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:16,922
I've read all my grandma's
Space Ranger books, from cover to cover.

608
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,131
Twice.

609
00:38:19,835 --> 00:38:21,419
<i>Excuse me, robot kitty.</i>

610
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:22,594
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

611
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:27,182
<i>Sensors have indicated that the Zurg ship
powers the robots on the ground.</i>

612
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:31,436
So, we fly up there, we blow up the ship.
And surprise, robots!

613
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:32,729
You're toast.

614
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,940
Then, we put your crystal in the turnip.

615
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:36,525
And finish the mission.

616
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,820
It's a good plan.
To infinity.

617
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:42,698
Are you trying to get me
to pull your finger?

618
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:43,866
<i>Don't fall for it.</i>

619
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,492
No, not like that, it was...

620
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,370
Sorry, it's a thing your grandma
and I used to do.

621
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:49,538
<i>Ew.</i>

622
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,790
I-- We were never--
She didn't mean to...

623
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,166
Anyway, forget it. Moving on.

624
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:56,391
Let's load these munitions
into the Armadillo

625
00:38:56,475 --> 00:38:57,796
and steel ourselves for combat.

626
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,591
Operation Surprise Party is on.

627
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:03,218
<i>Buzz, do you hear that?</i>

628
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:04,636
I hear something.

629
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:08,599
You think it's a robot?

630
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,101
<i>Nah, we've never seen a robot
this far from the base.</i>

631
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,269
I don't hear anything.

632
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:14,146
Now I do.

633
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:18,577
<i>Zurg.</i>

634
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,198
Don't worry, we got you.

635
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,994
What?

636
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:30,454
TRAINING AMMO

637
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:33,540
Fear not!
The Junior Patrol has your back.

638
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:34,708
The Junior what?

639
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,047
No! The ship!

640
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:47,596
<i>Did I get it?</i>

641
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:48,555
Pretty close.

642
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,140
Sorry, I'm not trained with this weapon.

643
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:51,099
Let me reload.

644
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,435
Not trained? Wait, what do you mean
you're "not trained"?

645
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,199
You there. Grab it! Grab it!

646
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,701
Grab what?

647
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:11,530
I'm not allowed to handle weapons

648
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,539
the violation of my parole.

649
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:14,498
Parole?

650
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,249
Buzz!

651
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,166
Izzy! Now!

652
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:21,547
No!

653
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:22,965
Okay, new plan.

654
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,925
New plan?
What was the old plan?

655
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,677
I need the--
Anyone seen the harpoons?

656
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,185
They came preloaded with a harpoon,
but I can't find--

657
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:36,478
Oh, I found it.

658
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:39,356
I found the harpoons.
I'm gonna reload it now. Check this out.

659
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,033
Did I get it?

660
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,993
A little to the left.

661
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:17,936
What?

662
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:22,399
Did I get it?

663
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:23,650
You got it.

664
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:24,860
Yes!

665
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,780
<i>Boom.</i>

666
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,562
Okay, okay. What exactly-- How did that--

667
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:01,730
Who are you?

668
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:04,066
We're the Junior Patrol,
at your service.

669
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,610
Right, I'm gonna need more information.

670
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:09,655
We are a volunteer team
of self-motivated cadets.

671
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:12,699
We train one week in a month
here at the outpost.

672
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:14,973
Mo and Darby and I
were the first to arrive last weekend

673
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:16,328
when the robots showed up.

674
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,289
So, we cooked up
Operation Surprise Party.

675
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:20,874
So, you are rookies?

676
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:24,461
Boy, we'd love to be rookies,
still building up to that.

677
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:26,922
Okay. Do you have munitions training?

678
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,340
-Partial.
-Tactical engagement?

679
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:29,716
-Pending.
-Combat experience?

680
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:33,053
Yes! If you count the robot situation
we just went through.

681
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,888
Okay. Come on, Sox.

682
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,139
What are you doing?

683
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,793
Look, you seem nice people.

684
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:40,518
I'm very supportive
of your training initiatives.

685
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:42,563
But I'm gonna go ahead
and take it from here.

686
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,481
We just saved you from that robot.

687
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:46,608
-Excuse me?
-Mo made the kill shot.

688
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,068
Mo got lucky.

689
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,236
Very.

690
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:52,698
So, if you could just point me
in the direction of another ship.

691
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:56,243
<i>There are operational spacecrafts
at the abandoned storage depot.</i>

692
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,619
Great. Where is that?

693
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:01,206
<i>The storage depot is directly adjacent
to the Resource Reconstituting Center,</i>

694
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:04,751
<i>which is 4.2 kilometers
from your current location.</i>

695
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,253
Great. Where is that?

696
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,796
<i>It's actually quite simple.</i>

697
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:09,298
Okay.

698
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,885
<i>You will first head south
towards the base.</i>

699
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:15,012
<i>After two stop lights you will--</i>

700
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:18,515
<i>Wait, that is not right.
That is a dead end.</i>

701
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:21,018
<i>Oh, I see, I was in the wrong spot.</i>

702
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:23,395
<i>Apologies. I will start over.</i>

703
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,967
<i>You will first head south
towards the base.</i>

704
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:30,110
<i>After two stop lights
you'll take a gentle left and--</i>

705
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:32,362
<i>Shoot. I have made another error.</i>

706
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,530
We'll just show you.

707
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:34,720
<i>Allow me to restart.</i>

708
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:37,158
<i>You will first head south
towards the base.</i>

709
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:41,079
<i>After two stop lights
you'll take a hard right...</i>

710
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,165
<i>Buzz Lightyear supplemental mission log.</i>

711
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:44,891
Having finally achieved hyper-speed

712
00:43:44,975 --> 00:43:47,544
I now have an additional obstacle
in my way.

713
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:52,591
In order to flee this planet I'll have
to destroy a massive alien ship alone.

714
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:54,384
with no assistance of any kind.

715
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:57,012
You know, we can help you. It is our plan.

716
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,180
I can't allow that.

717
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:00,057
Star Command Code 2709.3

718
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:03,352
forbids me from placing
unqualified personnel in harms way.

719
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,312
Okay, but I'm a Hawthorne.

720
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,688
It's more than just a name, Izzy.

721
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:07,731
You have to know exactly--

722
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:10,160
-...how to react in any sit--
-...what you gonna say next.

723
00:44:10,244 --> 00:44:11,254
I thought I had that one.

724
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:12,110
Okay.

725
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:15,155
And you, you're in a correctional
situation of some kind?

726
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:16,323
Parole program.

727
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,451
I do this and they shave
a little time off my sentence.

728
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,411
But I really learned a lot in there.

729
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:23,580
Darby can take any three things
and make them explode.

730
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:25,958
Okay. And what about you?

731
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:29,753
Me? I thought this was gonna be
like a fun boot camp workout thing.

732
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:31,248
But it is not.

733
00:44:31,414 --> 00:44:33,834
So, I was actually coming out here
to turn in my stuff--

734
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,092
He's a quitter.

735
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,385
I'm not a quitter.

736
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:37,427
You were quitting.

737
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,805
What are you talking about?
I was just going in a different direction.

738
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,515
Yeah, the direction of a quitter.

739
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:42,850
You know what, I give up.

740
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:45,018
-See?
-On your right..

741
00:44:58,304 --> 00:44:59,199
<i>Zurg.</i>

742
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:00,617
<i>Now, where was I?</i>

743
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,411
<i>Here we are. Let me back up.</i>

744
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,082
Hey, keep working on your skills.
It's the only way to get better.

745
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:08,250
We can help you.

746
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,919
And I appreciate that.
Just go back to your training facility.

747
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:12,880
Stay alert. Stay safe.

748
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:15,060
I'm going to commandeer
this P-32 Armadillo

749
00:45:15,144 --> 00:45:16,633
and go blow up the Zurg ship.

750
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,302
So, this is just goodbye?

751
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:19,970
Affirmative. Goodbye.

752
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,224
Sorry, I forgot my cat.

753
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,153
<i>Life forms detected.</i>

754
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:37,362
What are they?

755
00:45:37,522 --> 00:45:39,149
<i>Giant insectoid organisms.</i>

756
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,825
<i>The building appears to be
some sort of hive.</i>

757
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:42,910
Are they a threat?

758
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:44,745
<i>Sensors indicate they are hibernating.</i>

759
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:45,913
Very good.

760
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:47,748
Oh, look!

761
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,458
It's the XL-01.

762
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,293
It's been a long time since...

763
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:52,711
Whoa.

764
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:53,795
<i>What is it?</i>

765
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,380
Come on, I'll show you.

766
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:11,855
Finally.

767
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:16,652
Sorry to interrupt.

768
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:18,362
Looks like you were having
a real nice moment.

769
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:19,905
What are you doing here?
It's not safe.

770
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,406
You took the keys to our truck.

771
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:22,574
There they are.

772
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:29,164
Come on. Come on.

773
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:30,415
-Quiet.
-I'm trying.

774
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,502
Got it.

775
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:38,006
-Somebody get--
-Get the door!

776
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,718
You were gonna say "get the door",
and I got the door.

777
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,515
Well, I'm gonna be blunt here.
I wish that hadn't happened.

778
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:47,975
So did the rest of us.

779
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,142
Everyone grab a weapon.

780
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,353
Boy, I'd love to, but my parole--

781
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,856
As a Star Command Officer
I grant you emergency authority.

782
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:55,524
We're gonna blast our way outta here.

783
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:56,608
Now we're talking!

784
00:46:56,775 --> 00:47:00,404
<i>Buzz, the probability of survival
a frontal attack is 38.2 percent.</i>

785
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:01,738
Seems a bit low.

786
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,031
What about Stealth Mode?

787
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:04,366
How do you know about Stealth Mode?

788
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,535
Grandma and I used to play
Stealth Mode all the time.

789
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,304
It was like hide-and-seek,
but with a twist.

790
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:11,999
Okay, well, it's actually good thinking.
I'll use Stealth Mode to disorient them.

791
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:14,084
Or, and stick with me here.

792
00:47:14,237 --> 00:47:17,282
We could all use Stealth Mode
and just walk right out.

793
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:20,883
You mean, you would wear
a Space Ranger suit?

794
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:22,885
This one already has my name on it.

795
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,722
Okay.

796
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:28,515
Let's review.

797
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:29,558
I'm going--

798
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:30,726
That way.

799
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:31,768
And you're going--

800
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,020
That way.

801
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,188
Okay. Very good.

802
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:36,982
Check it out,
I'm Feathers... Feathering...

803
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:39,818
Oh, look, a pen. Cool.

804
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:42,029
-Does yours have a pen?
-Okay, pay attention.

805
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:43,405
Stealth mode is fairly simple.

806
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:45,657
There are just two parts.
You press the button--

807
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:47,993
-Is it this button?
-I will tell you which button.

808
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,244
-What about this button?
-I'm sorry.

809
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:51,205
We're not gonna have time
to go over all the buttons.

810
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,831
Okay, forget the button.
What about this thing?

811
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:53,832
-It's more--
-No! No!

812
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,126
That's the surrender strand.
You never pull that.

813
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:58,629
There is no more shameful maneuver
for a Space Ranger.

814
00:47:58,795 --> 00:47:59,796
Excuse me.

815
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:02,174
Did I miss which button
is the Stealth Mode button?

816
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:03,425
It's this button.

817
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:04,635
Not yet!

818
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,554
You push this button,
then you go out the front door,

819
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,515
and I'll go blow up the Zurg ship.

820
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:11,099
-Ready?
-Ready.

821
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:13,101
No, wait. Not ready. Hang on.

822
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:15,187
Okay, got 'em.
That would've been embarrassing.

823
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,731
Okay.

824
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:18,982
<i>Goodbye again.</i>

825
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:27,281
<i>Sox, you're inhibiting my visual.</i>

826
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:28,784
<i>Sorry. Is this better?</i>

827
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:30,786
<i>-Negative.
-Okay, how about this?</i>

828
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:32,746
<i>How about this?</i>

829
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:46,552
<i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

830
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:56,186
<i>Very good.
Stealth Mode working as planned.</i>

831
00:48:57,623 --> 00:49:01,067
<i>This is pretty cool.
These dumb bugs can't even see us.</i>

832
00:49:01,322 --> 00:49:03,157
<i>Hey, bug. Hey, bug. Bug.</i>

833
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,820
<i>I'm right here, bug.
Can't you see me?</i>

834
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,949
<i>He can't. He can't see me at all.</i>

835
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:11,368
<i>And time has elapsed.</i>

836
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,662
<i>Wait, the timer.</i>

837
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:15,247
<i>They don't know about the timer.</i>

838
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:18,625
<i>You don't see me.</i>

839
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,043
<i>Wait. I can see you.</i>

840
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:21,962
<i>I can see you too.</i>

841
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:23,922
<i>The bugs can see us.</i>

842
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,091
<i>No, no. I surrender.</i>

843
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:29,206
<i>Pull!</i>

844
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,517
<i>Back! Back!</i>

845
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,021
<i>This isn't working.</i>

846
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:40,564
You have to keep going!

847
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,609
<i>We have to turn around.</i>

848
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:46,695
<i>They're headed right for us.</i>

849
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:49,072
No, no. Do not approach the vehicle!

850
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,213
All right!

851
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:05,839
-Way to adapt, team.
-Give it up here.

852
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,925
Why are you congratulating yourselves?

853
00:50:08,077 --> 00:50:10,209
Because I just Hawthorned us out
right outta that situation.

854
00:50:10,293 --> 00:50:11,730
But you could've made it if--

855
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:13,346
If you had told us
the Stealth Mode wears off.

856
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,139
Well...

857
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:18,268
Okay, everyone just strap in.

858
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,773
<i>Hello, I am your--</i>

859
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,203
Hold on!

860
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:41,959
Are we going to space?

861
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,585
No, I'm gonna drop you somewhere.

862
00:50:47,256 --> 00:50:49,383
That was a big swirly turn.
I think I need a bag.

863
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,134
No, no. Do not vomit
inside the vehicle.

864
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:53,470
I can see starts. That is space.

865
00:50:53,637 --> 00:50:54,721
What is happening right now?

866
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:55,931
She's afraid of space.

867
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,391
-What?
<i>-She should be. It's horrible</i>

868
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,518
Izzy, remember your exercises.

869
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:00,936
-It's coming.
-No, no.

870
00:51:01,103 --> 00:51:02,062
Engage your helmet.
That will catch it.

871
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:03,772
-Buzz! Another ship!
-Izzy, I'm trying--

872
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:27,671
I can't see anything.

873
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,590
Oh, no! The dark side
of the planet.

874
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:30,966
<i>Over there! Three o'clock!</i>

875
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,385
Hold on. This isn't gonna be pretty.

876
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,147
Is everyone okay?

877
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:46,148
I think so.

878
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,618
Sox, give me a damage report.

879
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:59,453
<i>One moment, please.</i>

880
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:03,040
Okay. This is better.

881
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:04,625
Is this better?

882
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,504
No, obviously this is worse overall,
I just meant... You know...

883
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:10,756
How are you afraid of space?

884
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:12,341
Oh, It's pretty easy.

885
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:16,178
Did you know if you let go out there
you just keep going in the same direction

886
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:18,347
forever, just...

887
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,141
Well, then how were you
going to blow up the Zurg ship?

888
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,101
I would've been ground support.

889
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,188
I know, grandma wasn't afraid of space.

890
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,273
No, because she was a Space Ranger.

891
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,943
Astrophobia is an automatic
disqualification.

892
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:32,402
What was that thing?

893
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:34,112
-I don't know.
-Is it gonna come back?

894
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:35,405
I don't know.

895
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,908
But how did it--
Okay, you don't know.

896
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:45,374
I was done. I finally had the crystal.
This was supposed to be over.

897
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,584
But who am I kidding?

898
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:49,921
I don't need a crystal.

899
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:52,042
I need a time machine
to get out of this mess.

900
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:54,007
<i>Assessment complete.</i>

901
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:55,175
How bad is that?

902
00:52:57,261 --> 00:53:01,306
<i>The blast was absorbed by the heat shield
and only caused a minor electrical short.</i>

903
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:02,474
Okay.

904
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:04,101
<i>So, in order to be flight operational</i>

905
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:07,646
<i>the Armadillo will require a material
of specialized capacitance.</i>

906
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,106
Oh, like an electrical thingy.

907
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,274
How do you know that?

908
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,483
We learned this.

909
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:15,904
Specialized capacitance, remember?
We built those field radios last month?

910
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:17,114
Oh, yeah. That was fun.

911
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:18,407
Yeah, except Darby messed hers up.

912
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:19,575
I'm gonna mess you up--

913
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:21,577
Please. I'm trying to think here.

914
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:23,871
I messed mine up, but then I fixed it up.

915
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:25,372
But you broke that computer console.

916
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,624
I needed that little coil for its...
What was that?

917
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:28,834
Specialized capacitance.

918
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:31,295
Hey, honestly, there is
a lot of room out here.

919
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:34,214
If you guys wanna reminisce
you could go over there,

920
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,550
or look, there's no one
trying to think over there.

921
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:38,635
We can go up there.

922
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:39,803
Fine. Perfect.

923
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,222
Yes. Okay, new plan.

924
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:43,390
Wait. What?

925
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:45,601
That mining facility
will have a console, right?

926
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:48,145
That console will have
a little coil thing, right?

927
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,980
And that little coil thing
will have the...

928
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:51,148
Specialized capacitance.

929
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,650
That we need to fix this ship, right?

930
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:54,651
<i>She's right.</i>

931
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:01,116
Good job. Now that's thinking
like a Hawthorne.

932
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,948
Let's go get that part
and get outta here

933
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,990
before that thing finds us again.

934
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:30,312
Whoa.

935
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:32,439
Over there.

936
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:37,277
Okay, here we go.

937
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,204
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

938
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,998
In order to repair our ship
we have to find some way

939
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:52,042
to get inside
the Command Center and...

940
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,255
Nice job, elderly convict.

941
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,385
Okay, the activation coil
should be in here.

942
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:02,553
Sox?

943
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:04,846
Need a pen?

944
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,640
<i>Got it.</i>

945
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:08,809
Okay, yeah. Another time.

946
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:11,478
Oh no.

947
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:13,605
<i>Security measures activated.</i>

948
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,650
<i>No! Not this again.</i>

949
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,026
<i>Not what? What is this?</i>

950
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,073
<i>A capture cone. That holds you
until they come and get you.</i>

951
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,367
<i>No one's coming to get us.
They're all trapped in the base.</i>

952
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:26,702
<i>So, we should just leave, right?</i>

953
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,287
<i>We can't just leave.</i>

954
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:31,415
<i>Sure we can. Take it from me,
we can always just leave.</i>

955
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:33,083
<i>Look, see?</i>

956
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:35,627
<i>Come on!</i>

957
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,921
<i>Told you.</i>

958
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:41,258
<i>Now, be careful, because these things--</i>

959
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:44,011
<i>combine if they touch.</i>

960
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:46,722
<i>All right, sorry.
But maybe if we both try it?</i>

961
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,599
<i>That's not gonna work.</i>

962
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:50,017
<i>You haven't even tried.</i>

963
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,394
<i>No!</i>

964
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:53,574
<i>Meow.</i>

965
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:56,148
<i>Yeah, that didn't work.</i>

966
00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:57,642
<i>-Buzz?
-Whoa, hold on.</i>

967
00:55:57,816 --> 00:55:59,943
<i>I'm no help to anyone
if I'm stuck in there with you.</i>

968
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,570
<i>Sox, can you turn these off?</i>

969
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,615
<i>I can't reach the controls.</i>

970
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:07,492
<i>Wait, there's a soft spot
in the floor here.</i>

971
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:09,036
<i>-Maybe if we could--
-That's my foot.</i>

972
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,829
<i>-Sorry.
-Wait, watch it!</i>

973
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,708
<i>Wait, that's it.
That thing powers these things.</i>

974
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,960
<i>-Then let's hit it again.
-Wait. Wait.</i>

975
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:19,129
<i>We need the door to be open.</i>

976
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:22,299
<i>So I'll open this.
You slam into the power source.</i>

977
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:24,885
<i>These things will disappear.
And we'll walk right out.</i>

978
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:25,886
<i>-Yes, sir.
-All right.</i>

979
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:26,845
<i>Ready?</i>

980
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:31,808
<i>Keep trying!</i>

981
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:37,814
<i>We're just not heavy enough.</i>

982
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:40,275
<i>Buzz, we need you.</i>

983
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:41,735
<i>Wait, in there?</i>

984
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:44,154
<i>But if it doesn't work
I won't be able to save you.</i>

985
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:47,199
<i>You don't need to save us,
you need to join us.</i>

986
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:56,416
<i>Again.</i>

987
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,961
<i>Again!</i>

988
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:02,464
<i>Again!</i>

989
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:10,472
No!

990
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:12,307
Go! Go!

991
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:14,768
Watch out!

992
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:20,065
Buzz, no!

993
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,400
We need the coil.

994
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:40,794
We got you.

995
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:50,971
Oh, look. Snacks.

996
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:54,474
Anyone going for the snack?

997
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,853
MEAT SANDWICH

998
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:06,612
Here. Let's all re-charge a little.

999
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:10,949
Here you go.

1000
00:58:13,476 --> 00:58:17,164
Huh, this is, uh--
What-- What's--

1001
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:18,999
What's happening here?

1002
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,626
Something wrong
with your sandwich?

1003
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:23,378
Why is the meat on the outside?

1004
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:25,339
Because it's a sandwich?

1005
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:27,508
No, the bread is supposed to be
on the outside.

1006
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,218
What, like, bread, meat, bread?

1007
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,552
That's too much bread.

1008
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:32,804
Yes, but this is all wet.

1009
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:35,015
Yeah. Juicy fingers.
That's the best part.

1010
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,850
When was the last time
you had a sandwich?

1011
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:39,054
I don't know, a hundred years ago,
give or take.

1012
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:41,188
Just a "bread, meat, bread."

1013
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:42,356
That's too much bread.

1014
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:44,608
That would just suck
all the moisture out of your mouth.

1015
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:46,568
Good one, Darby.

1016
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:47,945
Oh, no!

1017
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:49,029
Sox!

1018
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,448
Wake up, Sox.

1019
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,575
Come on, little buddy, come back to me.

1020
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:55,661
Please, Sox. I'm sorry.

1021
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:57,496
Sox.

1022
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:01,625
<i>Hello. I require a reboot.</i>

1023
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:10,676
I'm sorry, guys.
I almost killed Sox.

1024
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:13,095
I almost got us all killed back there.

1025
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:16,515
Hey, listen to me, it was just a mistake.

1026
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,141
Right, Buzz?

1027
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:24,147
Just try to get a little better.

1028
00:59:30,624 --> 00:59:31,667
Listen.

1029
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:36,076
I just...

1030
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:42,624
When I first went to the Academy
I was not... you know... good.

1031
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:46,170
I screwed up every day.

1032
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:49,131
I got tangled in the obstacle course.

1033
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:51,925
My hands shook so much
I couldn't hit the target.

1034
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:54,761
Not the bulls-eye.
The whole target.

1035
00:59:55,512 --> 00:59:57,806
And I was gonna quit
after the first week, it was...

1036
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:00,893
clear I was not Space Ranger material.

1037
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:02,102
Really?

1038
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:03,562
Yeah.

1039
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,106
But her grandma
saw something in me.

1040
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,194
So I started looking for it too.

1041
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:13,363
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1042
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,117
<i>One corrupted file restored.</i>

1043
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:20,120
<i>Hey, he's lighting up.</i>

1044
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,165
-Grandma.
<i>-Hello, Sox.</i>

1045
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:25,042
<i>I need you to do me a favor.</i>

1046
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:29,213
<i>I need you to look after my best friend.
His name is Buzz.</i>

1047
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:33,342
<i>He's away right now,
but he'll be back soon.</i>

1048
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,511
<i>He's a Space Ranger.</i>

1049
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,555
<i>He's going to get us all home.
Get us all home.</i>

1050
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:54,363
What's wrong?

1051
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:56,198
Did not you hear that?

1052
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:58,951
She believed I could fix
the mistake I made.

1053
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:01,954
And that belief
cost her everything.

1054
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,706
Everything? No.

1055
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:08,836
She had grandma Kiko,
my Dad and me, all her friends.

1056
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:13,882
She didn't meant to be here, but she had
a whole life on this planet, Buzz.

1057
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:15,884
All of us had.

1058
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:18,762
Except for you.

1059
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:25,394
We wanted to be Space Rangers again.
We wanted to matter.

1060
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:29,439
Believe me, she mattered.

1061
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:43,829
You know, it is pretty good this way.

1062
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:48,375
Yeah? Bread, meat, bread.
How long did you do it like that?

1063
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:49,918
Forever.

1064
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:53,547
<i>Fully recharged.</i>

1065
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:54,965
Come on.

1066
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:57,718
Let's go put this part in the ship
and get outta here.

1067
01:01:58,302 --> 01:01:59,303
Sox, can you light our way?

1068
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:00,470
<i>Of course.</i>

1069
01:02:00,572 --> 01:02:03,312
<i>Click click. Click click.</i>

1070
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:06,643
<i>I see you.
I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya.</i>

1071
01:02:06,803 --> 01:02:07,596
<i>Oh, I didn't get ya.</i>

1072
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,438
-Sox?
<i>-Where'd you go? I got you!</i>

1073
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:10,856
-Sox.
<i>-Yeah, sorry.</i>

1074
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,647
This is exciting.
Operation Surprise Party, here we come!

1075
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:20,609
Wait, what? Negative. I can't put you
in harm's way like that.

1076
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:22,492
What, are you gonna do
the whole mission alone?

1077
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:23,660
I can do it.

1078
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,495
Because you got a Hawthorne right here.

1079
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:29,208
And I appreciate that. Tell you what,
I'll let you know if I need you.

1080
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:33,378
But until then let's just try to get back
to the Armadillo without any more--

1081
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:41,762
Run!

1082
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:47,518
No!

1083
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:53,232
What?

1084
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:55,150
It's after me! Go back to the ship!

1085
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,360
But Buzz!

1086
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:00,864
<i>Buzz Lightyear mission log.</i>

1087
01:03:03,909 --> 01:03:05,285
I'm being pursued by a...

1088
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,622
just a massive robot.

1089
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:12,793
I'm leading it away
while the others escape to the ship.

1090
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:36,024
<i>Buzz.</i>

1091
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,235
What? How do you know my name?

1092
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:40,654
<i>Come with me.</i>

1093
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:41,822
What?

1094
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:48,203
This is definitely
a violation of my parole.

1095
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:54,334
Come on. Let's get outta here.

1096
01:04:14,556 --> 01:04:15,596
<i>Zurg.</i>

1097
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:37,753
Ready yourselves for launch.
Operation Surprise Party is back on.

1098
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,921
What? With us?

1099
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:40,589
What, am I gonna do
the whole mission alone?

1100
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:44,301
<i>We can't launch yet.
I need five minutes to install the coil.</i>

1101
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:49,973
We can't sit here for five minutes.

1102
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,715
<i>The ship still has hover capabilities.</i>

1103
01:04:51,799 --> 01:04:52,625
Then let's use them.

1104
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,704
We might lose them
in the fire geysers.

1105
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:15,415
Blink the way.
You two, blast some robots.

1106
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:16,959
But we haven't even finished
our munitions training.

1107
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,836
How hard can it be? Look.

1108
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:21,526
We got these spiky things.
And these one probably explode.

1109
01:05:21,713 --> 01:05:23,090
Just do whatever feels right.

1110
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:24,675
What? What are you gonna do?

1111
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:26,760
I'm gonna dance with Mister Boom.

1112
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:35,310
Now that's satisfying.

1113
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:36,645
<i>Twenty percent complete.</i>

1114
01:05:36,812 --> 01:05:37,813
Out of a hundred?

1115
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:44,611
They're gaining on us.
Where are those fire geysers?

1116
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:45,779
Dead ahead.

1117
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:47,281
Don't worry,
I know every last inch of--

1118
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:48,448
Watch out!

1119
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:00,878
Here, throw this.

1120
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:02,796
-Wait, hold on.
-Throw it!

1121
01:06:10,218 --> 01:06:11,071
<i>Zurg.</i>

1122
01:06:12,556 --> 01:06:14,183
Fire geyser dead ahead!

1123
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,438
<i>Fifty percent complete.</i>

1124
01:06:20,388 --> 01:06:21,248
<i>Zurg.</i>

1125
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:25,319
Hey, we have explosives back here!

1126
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:32,576
Quick! Give me something.

1127
01:06:40,569 --> 01:06:41,732
<i>Zurg.</i>

1128
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,793
<i>Ninety percent complete.</i>

1129
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:51,845
Izzy, do you know how to transfer
power on the fly?

1130
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:53,472
I've done it in the simulator.

1131
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:55,015
Well, it's about to get real.

1132
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:58,143
-Do you need my help with anything?
-Absolutely not.

1133
01:06:58,310 --> 01:06:59,353
<i>Ninety five percent complete.</i>

1134
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,396
Ready thrusters. Green button. Middle.

1135
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:02,439
Done.

1136
01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:05,651
Remember from training.

1137
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,986
You don't pull the trigger,
you squeeze the trigger.

1138
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:09,029
I know.

1139
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:10,614
<i>Ninety nine percent complete.</i>

1140
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:11,782
Transfer to Oscillating Power.

1141
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:12,783
Done.

1142
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:16,537
<i>One hundred percent complete.</i>

1143
01:07:17,663 --> 01:07:19,540
Reboot. Okay, be ready to launch

1144
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:21,208
when the fuel cell is--

1145
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,167
No!

1146
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:30,926
Oh, no.

1147
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:31,927
Blast!

1148
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:38,642
Grab the crystal!

1149
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:57,911
No.

1150
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:08,255
I...

1151
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:20,017
Buzz.

1152
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:21,643
I'm so sorry.

1153
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:25,314
Everything was happening so fast and I...

1154
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:26,607
I just...

1155
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:31,737
I made a mistake.

1156
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:34,156
Yeah.

1157
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:39,411
Okay, but we're not done, right?

1158
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:41,622
We can still do something.

1159
01:08:41,787 --> 01:08:44,041
Izzy, look around.

1160
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,210
There is nothing to do.

1161
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:47,461
The mission...

1162
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:49,921
It's over.

1163
01:08:50,671 --> 01:08:51,798
Buzz.

1164
01:08:52,256 --> 01:08:53,425
Buzz!

1165
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:55,051
Where are you going?

1166
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:58,388
I just need to be by myself.

1167
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:02,309
No!

1168
01:09:08,564 --> 01:09:09,566
Buzz!

1169
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:13,569
<i>Buzz.</i>

1170
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:47,645
What the...

1171
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:50,439
What is this?
Where are we?

1172
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:52,609
Who are you?

1173
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:54,695
<i>Now that's the question.</i>

1174
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:07,082
You look good, Buzz.

1175
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:09,334
Dad?

1176
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:10,586
Guess again.

1177
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:26,476
Sox?

1178
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,313
<i>Hello, Buzz.</i>

1179
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:31,648
I don't understand.

1180
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:39,156
I messed this all up.

1181
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,283
Hey, it was just a mistake.

1182
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:43,118
Remember what you told me?

1183
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:45,078
This one's different.

1184
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,246
Why?

1185
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:47,831
Because it's mine!

1186
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,596
I'm supposed to be as good as my grandma.

1187
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,265
I'm supposed to be a Hawthorne.

1188
01:11:08,185 --> 01:11:09,353
But I'm not.

1189
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:23,825
Buzz?

1190
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,162
Wait a minute, hold on.

1191
01:11:27,329 --> 01:11:28,622
You're not me.
I am me.

1192
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:29,831
You are you now.

1193
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:32,000
But I'm you 50 years from now.

1194
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,335
Well, there can't be two mes.

1195
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:35,003
Yet here we both are.

1196
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,047
Okay then. If you're me.

1197
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:38,882
I'm thinking of
a number between one and--

1198
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:40,634
1273.

1199
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:41,802
Whoa.

1200
01:11:42,775 --> 01:11:43,678
<i>Zurg.</i>

1201
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:45,097
Isn't that cute.

1202
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:46,974
Robots can't quite say "Buzz."

1203
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:49,429
So around here I'm just Zurg.

1204
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:50,351
<i>Zurg.</i>

1205
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:51,520
And I guess so are you.

1206
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:52,688
How? I don't understand.

1207
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:54,815
Do not worry about it.
None of this is gonna matter.

1208
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:55,816
<i>Buzz.</i>

1209
01:11:55,983 --> 01:11:56,859
Yes?

1210
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:58,569
<i>You have to explain it all to him.</i>

1211
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:00,362
You're right.

1212
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:02,823
I'm sorry, it's just exciting.

1213
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,449
You're finally here.

1214
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:07,077
See, I reached hyper-speed too.

1215
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:08,954
<i>Hyper-speed.</i>

1216
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:11,206
<i>Like you did.</i>

1217
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:14,459
<i>But I wasn't greeted as a hero.</i>

1218
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:20,382
<i>No, that new Commander was gonna
arrest me for stealing the XL-15.</i>

1219
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:24,178
<i>I'd found a way to get them home,
and they didn't even care.</i>

1220
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:25,304
<i>So I escaped.</i>

1221
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:34,021
<i>I went as far as I could,
as fast as I could.</i>

1222
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:37,941
<i>At that speed for that long
I'd traveled centuries.</i>

1223
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:41,904
<i>And I ended up in a future
you wouldn’t recognize.</i>

1224
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:44,698
<i>Filled with technology you can't imagine.</i>

1225
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:47,534
<i>And that's when it dawned on me.</i>

1226
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:50,954
<i>If we can use this crystal
to go forward in time.</i>

1227
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,373
Why not use it to go back?

1228
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,209
But we can't go back in time.

1229
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,169
-We can now.
-What?

1230
01:12:57,377 --> 01:13:00,339
Listen, Buzz, I've broken time.

1231
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:03,511
What's happening to you
never happened to me.

1232
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:07,054
This is a new now that's never been lived.

1233
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:09,681
You see, we can change things, Buzz.

1234
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:13,894
Well, if we can go back in time
we can stop ourselves

1235
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:15,020
from ever landing on that planet.

1236
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,355
From ever hitting that mountain.

1237
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:17,856
We can just continue the mission home.

1238
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:19,650
And none of this
will have ever happened.

1239
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:21,735
it's a good plan.

1240
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:24,404
And this crystal is the key to it all.

1241
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:26,031
Wait, don't you already have one?

1242
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:27,699
Well, sort of.

1243
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:32,412
See, I wore my crystal out
testing the time travel.

1244
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:34,748
Wore myself out too. It took a while.

1245
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:37,334
Turns out this isn't an exact science.

1246
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:40,045
This is as far back in time
as I could get.

1247
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:42,381
Come on, help me configure the engine.

1248
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:43,715
It should look familiar.

1249
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:45,884
Wait, is this based on the turnip?

1250
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,719
Set it for reversed thrusters, full.

1251
01:13:50,347 --> 01:13:51,849
So, we designed all of this?

1252
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:54,560
No, this is all borrowed.

1253
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:56,436
I just made some modifications.

1254
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:05,320
She'll get to be
a Space Ranger again, Buzz.

1255
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:07,990
Yeah.

1256
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:09,408
Although...

1257
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:10,409
What?

1258
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:13,537
Well, she won't have her family.

1259
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:15,163
She won't have Izzy.

1260
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,456
Who's Izzy?

1261
01:14:17,249 --> 01:14:19,272
Look, she's not gonna miss anyone

1262
01:14:19,356 --> 01:14:22,598
if she never meets them
in the first place, right?

1263
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:27,551
The only thing people are gonna know
is that we finished our mission.

1264
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:31,221
Here. Hand me your crystal.

1265
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:35,142
Buzz?

1266
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:37,603
I don't know, maybe...

1267
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,521
maybe we should think about this.

1268
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:41,064
Think about what?

1269
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:44,443
Commander Hawthorne believed
we could fix this mistake we made.

1270
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:47,321
And that belief cost her everything.

1271
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:50,365
Oh, no, no.
We had that all wrong.

1272
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:52,242
She had a whole life down there.

1273
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:53,911
What kind of life?

1274
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,080
We're supposed to be Space Rangers.

1275
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:59,333
We suppose to matter.

1276
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,544
You don't wanna live like this, Buzz.

1277
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:05,839
Waking up with that same nightmare.

1278
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:08,342
Haunted by your mistake.

1279
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:10,886
But you can finally let go of that.

1280
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:13,013
Starting right now.

1281
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:16,517
You're right.

1282
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:19,019
I can.

1283
01:15:20,896 --> 01:15:21,897
Where are you going?

1284
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:24,525
You and me, we're not the same.

1285
01:15:25,192 --> 01:15:26,777
I'm sorry.

1286
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:28,111
No, Buzz.

1287
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:30,113
I'm sorry.

1288
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:44,294
Hey, cat.

1289
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:45,879
Do you know how to fly this thing?

1290
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:47,339
<i>There's no fuel.</i>

1291
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:50,425
See, this is why we should
never have gotten in over our heads.

1292
01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:51,510
What did you wanna do?

1293
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:53,220
Wait at the outpost
until the robots found us?

1294
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:55,013
That's better
than being stranded out here.

1295
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,515
where no one's ever gonna find us.

1296
01:15:56,688 --> 01:15:59,983
You are the last person I wanna be
stuck with in a life-and-death situation.

1297
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:01,270
Well, you're in luck. Okay?

1298
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,647
Cause look around.
This is just a death situation.

1299
01:16:03,814 --> 01:16:05,566
<i>Meow meow.</i>

1300
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:08,652
<i>I've completely lost Buzz.</i>

1301
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:11,071
<i>He's too far away to track.</i>

1302
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:28,922
Everybody, inside!

1303
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:29,923
What?

1304
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,551
Get inside the ship.

1305
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:36,263
What's after us now?

1306
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,431
We don't have any more weapons.

1307
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:38,932
It's okay. We're getting out of here.

1308
01:16:39,092 --> 01:16:40,177
<i>Where are we going?</i>

1309
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,768
We're going into space.

1310
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,191
Hey, let go of me. No!

1311
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:51,653
I don't understand
what's happening here, Buzz.

1312
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,530
You've changed.

1313
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,699
And not for the better.

1314
01:16:55,866 --> 01:16:56,867
No!

1315
01:16:57,034 --> 01:16:59,828
You can't do this.
You're gonna erase it all.

1316
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:01,455
Exactly.

1317
01:17:02,497 --> 01:17:04,374
No, you gonna take away everything.

1318
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,919
People's families, their friends.

1319
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:08,504
My friends.

1320
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:10,672
They have lives on that planet.

1321
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:12,299
Everyone does.

1322
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:14,092
Except for us.

1323
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:18,055
I hardly recognize you, Buzz.

1324
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:21,058
All these new ideas...

1325
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,768
You know what?

1326
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:24,978
We'll go ahead and erase those too.

1327
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:28,815
-Whoa.
<i>-I bought you five minutes.</i>

1328
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:29,942
Why?

1329
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,318
I like this new you.

1330
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:34,988
We have to destroy this ship.

1331
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:36,532
Can you get me to the bridge?

1332
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:37,783
<i>Certainly. Follow me.</i>

1333
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:45,955
<i>Zurg.</i>

1334
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:52,005
Operation Surprise Party, here we go.

1335
01:17:52,207 --> 01:17:53,187
Zap, zap!

1336
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:55,676
We need to protect our escape ship.

1337
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:57,678
So, don't let any robots
come through that door.

1338
01:17:57,845 --> 01:17:59,054
Don't worry, we'll seal it off.

1339
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:00,222
You go find Buzz.

1340
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:01,765
I'll track the chip in his dog tags.

1341
01:18:01,932 --> 01:18:03,100
<i>Meow meow.</i>

1342
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:05,310
What's wrong?

1343
01:18:05,483 --> 01:18:08,069
<i>I'm getting two Buzz signals.
That's can't be right.</i>

1344
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:10,691
<i>I'll triangulate.
That will get us close enough. Come on.</i>

1345
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:13,277
A shortcut back.

1346
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:22,744
This is pretty neat.

1347
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:23,704
We have to go.

1348
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:24,872
Yep, all right.

1349
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:34,214
Oh, great.

1350
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:36,175
I don't know any of these controls.

1351
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:37,384
Wait. I.V.A.N.?

1352
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:38,427
<i>Yes, Captain?</i>

1353
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:40,387
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1354
01:18:40,554 --> 01:18:42,764
Initiate self-destruct sequence
in two minutes.

1355
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:45,559
<i>You got it.
Self-destruct countdown initiated.</i>

1356
01:18:45,726 --> 01:18:48,228
<i>Buzz, you don't want
any of this cool technology?</i>

1357
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:49,980
Only you, buddy, come on.

1358
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:51,815
<i>-Traitor!</i>
-No.

1359
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:54,902
<i>Enough!</i>

1360
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:59,823
<i>Just tell me where the crystal is.</i>

1361
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:02,618
Okay, we've gotta protect our escape ship.

1362
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:04,119
So, how do we close this door?

1363
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:05,204
I don't know.

1364
01:19:05,363 --> 01:19:06,698
What? You said,
"don't worry we'll seal it off."

1365
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:08,624
Right, so don't worry. We will.

1366
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:10,918
Here we go.

1367
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,586
Look, see?

1368
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,921
What?

1369
01:19:20,344 --> 01:19:21,386
<i>Meow meow.</i>

1370
01:19:21,553 --> 01:19:23,138
<i>The signal is tighter now.</i>

1371
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:24,515
<i>He has to be straight this way.</i>

1372
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:28,227
That's a lot of space.

1373
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:30,354
Keep it together. Keep it together.

1374
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,314
No!

1375
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:36,860
<i>I don't understand.
The signal says Buzz is 50 meters away.</i>

1376
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:39,696
He's over there.

1377
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:42,991
<i>You think we're not the same, Buzz?</i>

1378
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:46,161
<i>You're already me,
you just don't know it yet.</i>

1379
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:47,746
I'm never gonna be you!

1380
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:51,250
<i>If you're not gonna be me
you're not gonna be anyone.</i>

1381
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:56,797
<i>Artificial gravity disengaged.</i>

1382
01:19:57,047 --> 01:19:58,173
Blast.

1383
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:00,092
No, no.

1384
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,307
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Building a bomb.

1385
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:08,559
Nice, do you need a pen?

1386
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:09,643
No. Here.

1387
01:20:10,853 --> 01:20:11,854
Oh, thank you.

1388
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:13,522
Peppermint.

1389
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:14,731
Give me the wrapper.

1390
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:17,192
So, you can just build a bomb
out of that stuff?

1391
01:20:17,365 --> 01:20:18,867
I worked with less.
Now give me the gum.

1392
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:21,029
Wait, I'm not done,
there's still a lot of flavor left.

1393
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:22,197
Come on!

1394
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:26,285
There. When they step on it
it will blow up.

1395
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:27,536
What if they don't step on it?

1396
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:29,663
I mean, I wouldn't step on that,
would you?

1397
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:32,833
Then we need to drop
something heavy on it.

1398
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:40,883
-Just gonna...
<i>-No!</i>

1399
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:51,727
Buzz?

1400
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:53,103
<i>Buzz!</i>

1401
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,271
Alisha?

1402
01:20:55,731 --> 01:20:57,274
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1403
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:02,988
No. I can't do it alone.
I need help.

1404
01:21:03,356 --> 01:21:06,484
<i>I'm not my grandma.</i>

1405
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:11,079
Izzy, I don't need your grandma,
I need you.

1406
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:14,917
Sox, how do we get over there?

1407
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,084
<i>Through the airlock.</i>

1408
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:18,337
Through there?

1409
01:21:18,504 --> 01:21:19,630
There's nothing out there.

1410
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:21,590
<i>Exactly. Nothing in your way.</i>

1411
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:23,217
<i>You just go straight across.</i>

1412
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:24,384
No!

1413
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:28,722
Let me get this straight,
when this falls on your bomb

1414
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:29,973
-it will definitely explode.
-Yes.

1415
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,141
-And that will seal the door?
-Yes.

1416
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:32,851
But we better hurry.

1417
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:34,228
I am hurrying.

1418
01:21:34,853 --> 01:21:36,480
Why don't you hurry?

1419
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,066
Come on.

1420
01:21:51,703 --> 01:21:52,371
<i>Okay.</i>

1421
01:21:55,332 --> 01:21:57,584
<i>Come on, Izzy.</i>

1422
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,378
<i>You got this.</i>

1423
01:22:00,671 --> 01:22:02,172
<i>Oh, man.</i>

1424
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:06,009
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1425
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:10,722
<i>Just don't look down, or up.
It's all space.</i>

1426
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:13,225
<i>It's everywhere. All around you.</i>

1427
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:15,853
<i>I'm sorry, I'm probably not helping.</i>

1428
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:17,229
<i>Just go straight.</i>

1429
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:20,774
<i>Once you push off
that the direction you'll go.</i>

1430
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:23,110
<i>But what if I miss?</i>

1431
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:24,862
<i>Don't miss.</i>

1432
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,229
<i>What? Oh, no.</i>

1433
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:00,939
<i>No, no!</i>

1434
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:10,490
<i>Whoa!</i>

1435
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:13,202
<i>Sox!</i>

1436
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:20,501
<i>Thank you, Izzy.</i>

1437
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:37,226
<i>There is no way in.</i>

1438
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:38,644
<i>Perhaps I could help.</i>

1439
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:48,612
<i>You can't hide for me, Buzz.</i>

1440
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,822
<i>It's like hiding from yourself.</i>

1441
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:52,866
I'll always find you.

1442
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,352
<i>Manual override activated.</i>

1443
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:34,908
-Buzz!
-Now!

1444
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:43,125
Come on, let's get outta here!

1445
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,418
We have to blow up the ship.

1446
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:46,003
There's no time.
We'll never make it.

1447
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,671
Oh, yes, we will.

1448
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:59,141
<i>Self-destruct sequence complete in ten...</i>

1449
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:02,060
<i>-...nine, eight...
-I.V.A.N.? I.V.A.N.!</i>

1450
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,707
<i>Zurg.</i>

1451
01:25:05,814 --> 01:25:06,899
Darby, we have to surrender.

1452
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:09,234
No! I am not giving up.

1453
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:11,528
Yep, neither am I. Hold on.

1454
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:21,538
<i>-...five, four...</i>
-Let's go.

1455
01:25:22,206 --> 01:25:24,541
<i>-...three, two...</i>
-Everyone, get in.

1456
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:25,959
<i>...one.</i>

1457
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:22,933
<i>Buzz Lightyear mission log.</i>

1458
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,686
<i>We've destroyed the Zurg's ship
and Zurg himself.</i>

1459
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:28,272
<i>Now I just have to catch up
to the Armadillo in order to--</i>

1460
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:31,191
<i>Going somewhere?</i>

1461
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:34,653
<i>Warning, engine damage is catastrophic.</i>

1462
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:40,742
<i>Buzz Lightyear mission log.
I now have the crystal in my possession,</i>

1463
01:26:41,285 --> 01:26:45,914
<i>and can finally, at long last
finish the mission.</i>

1464
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:48,667
<i>I'm gonna go back and matter again, Buzz.</i>

1465
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:50,210
<i>And you?</i>

1466
01:26:50,395 --> 01:26:52,939
<i>You will be like you have never here.</i>

1467
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:56,466
<i>Prepare to die.</i>

1468
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:03,432
<i>Not today, Zurg.</i>

1469
01:27:12,232 --> 01:27:14,234
<i>We've entered
the planet's gravitational pull.</i>

1470
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,360
Are we gonna crash?

1471
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:16,653
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

1472
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,293
Buzz!

1473
01:27:45,057 --> 01:27:46,225
<i>I can't do it.</i>

1474
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:48,227
<i>Buzz, it's okay.</i>

1475
01:27:48,393 --> 01:27:49,228
<i>We can.</i>

1476
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:51,855
<i>Can you keep the ship steady?</i>

1477
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:53,857
<i>Yeah. I think so.</i>

1478
01:27:57,402 --> 01:28:01,490
Okay, Sox, fuse the emergency battery
the power of flight controls.

1479
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:02,908
<i>Got it.</i>

1480
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:04,993
I'll need a co-pilot.

1481
01:28:06,042 --> 01:28:08,169
Okay, but I've only done this
in the simulator.

1482
01:28:08,372 --> 01:28:09,957
Well, it's about to get real.

1483
01:28:10,214 --> 01:28:12,675
Remember, pull back on the yoke--

1484
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,922
-Easy.
-Yep. Sorry. Nice and easy from now on.

1485
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:20,092
It's not working!

1486
01:28:20,259 --> 01:28:21,844
<i>We're going in too fast.</i>

1487
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,136
<i>-I.V.A.N.
-Yes, Captain?</i>

1488
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:25,389
<i>-We're going too fast.
-Congratulations!</i>

1489
01:28:26,849 --> 01:28:28,809
We don't need confetti, we need brakes!

1490
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:29,636
<i>Oh, I know!</i>

1491
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,436
-The air brake!
<i>-On the floor.</i>

1492
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:32,688
Darby!

1493
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:35,357
-It's stuck.
<i>-What?</i>

1494
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:36,984
The cover, it's stuck.

1495
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,111
I need a screwdriver,
or a hair clipper

1496
01:28:39,278 --> 01:28:40,821
Some sort of a small wedge.

1497
01:28:41,864 --> 01:28:43,532
I've got the pen!

1498
01:29:03,468 --> 01:29:05,012
-Buzz!
- Is everyone okay?

1499
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:06,885
-Yeah.
-I think so.

1500
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:10,434
The cops! Everybody, run!

1501
01:29:10,601 --> 01:29:13,061
Wait. It's just the rescue team.

1502
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:15,522
Right. Okay.

1503
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:19,610
You seem like a decent citizen.
What led to your incarceration?

1504
01:29:19,776 --> 01:29:21,361
I stole a ship.

1505
01:29:22,571 --> 01:29:26,408
Who among us hasn't stolen a ship
in a moment of...

1506
01:29:27,326 --> 01:29:28,327
relative desperation?

1507
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:31,705
I'm a man of resources.
My weapon is ingenuity.

1508
01:29:31,872 --> 01:29:33,248
I can do anything!

1509
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:34,666
Can you not shout in my ear?

1510
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:35,959
Yep, sorry.

1511
01:29:46,671 --> 01:29:47,672
You're okay?

1512
01:29:47,763 --> 01:29:49,305
su.b .T

1513
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:50,599
I was in space.

1514
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:54,228
Your grandma would be proud.

1515
01:29:55,562 --> 01:29:57,147
She'd be proud of you too.

1516
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,776
She always was.

1517
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:05,155
Wait. Where is your crystal?

1518
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:06,949
It's gone.

1519
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:08,825
But your mission...

1520
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:10,744
You wanted to go home.

1521
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:14,373
You know, for the first time
in a long time

1522
01:30:15,707 --> 01:30:17,501
I feel like I am home.

1523
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:26,801
<i>Zurg.</i>

1524
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:28,011
Look out!

1525
01:30:30,441 --> 01:30:31,306
Whoa?

1526
01:30:37,271 --> 01:30:38,647
<i>Stop right now!</i>

1527
01:30:40,732 --> 01:30:42,150
Lightyear.

1528
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:48,031
You absconded with Star Command property,
stolen experimental spacecraft

1529
01:30:48,198 --> 01:30:50,450
and defied a direct order
from your commander.

1530
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:52,696
I gotta throw you into stockade.

1531
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:57,749
But I have other plans for you.

1532
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:02,379
We want you to start a new version
of the Space Ranger Corps.

1533
01:31:02,546 --> 01:31:04,673
Universe Protection Division.

1534
01:31:04,882 --> 01:31:07,050
You're gonna be
a Space Ranger again, Buzz.

1535
01:31:09,178 --> 01:31:12,358
You can hand-select your team
from the very best of the Zap Patrol

1536
01:31:12,442 --> 01:31:13,682
and train them to your liking.

1537
01:31:13,766 --> 01:31:14,869
Zap, zap!

1538
01:31:16,977 --> 01:31:19,220
Well, that's very kind of you, sir.

1539
01:31:19,304 --> 01:31:21,361
But I'm afraid
I'm going to have to decline.

1540
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:26,153
I already have my team.

1541
01:31:37,532 --> 01:31:41,036
These new suits are amazing.
Arm blaster, rocket wings.

1542
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:42,377
It could use a pen though.

1543
01:31:42,586 --> 01:31:45,631
I can't believe I'm allowed to carry this.
I wish I had two of them.

1544
01:31:45,797 --> 01:31:48,217
You got a clean record.
and you're free and armed.

1545
01:31:48,383 --> 01:31:49,510
How are you still complaining?

1546
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:52,012
I got off for good behavior,
not good attitude.

1547
01:31:52,179 --> 01:31:53,347
<i>You know, I never wear pants,</i>

1548
01:31:53,514 --> 01:31:55,599
<i>but suddenly it feels weird
to not be wearing pants.</i>

1549
01:31:55,766 --> 01:31:56,934
<i>Does it look weird without pants?</i>

1550
01:31:57,093 --> 01:31:58,094
No, you look good.

1551
01:31:58,435 --> 01:31:59,561
I wish I could pull that off.

1552
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:09,279
Look, Grandma, I'm a Space Ranger.

1553
01:32:09,446 --> 01:32:10,906
Just like you.

1554
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:26,713
All right, team, we've picked up a signal
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4.

1555
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,342
We don't know what it is, but we're not
gonna wait for it to invade our home.

1556
01:32:30,509 --> 01:32:32,845
Copy, Commander.
You can count on us.
