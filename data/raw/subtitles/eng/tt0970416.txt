1
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,700
<i>Thiobacillus,</i>

2
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,410
which-- William--

3
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,000
<i>is a remarkable bacterium because--</i>

4
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,710
It's the only known organism
that lives in sulfuric acid.

5
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,380
That's right. And--

6
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,750
- Yes, Miss Rouhani?
- <i>Deinococcus radiodurans.</i>

7
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,170
Um, first discovered in 1956...

8
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,760
- breeding inside of drums of radioactive waste.
- <i>That's correct.</i>

9
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,390
So, <i>pompejana, Thiobacillus, Deinococcus--</i>

10
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,970
Which of these three
would most likely survive...

11
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,060
in the extreme environment of the
Jupiter moon Callisto, and why?

12
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,060
Tom, can you get the lights, please?

13
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,230
<i>That's your lab report question
for this week,</i>

14
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,440
and it's due in my box
by midnight on Friday.

15
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,690
That's all for today. Thank you.

16
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,780
So, are you coming to the faculty conference tonight?

17
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,870
And listen to Dean Stoff lecture
about how the universe is like a beautiful woman?

18
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,210
Think I'll pass.

19
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,710
Come on. It'll be fun.

20
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,290
I could pick you up.

21
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,130
Um, I can't.

22
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,430
I have to get back to my own extreme environment.
But thank you.

23
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,970
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

24
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,740
- <i>Come on. Go.</i>
- <i>Jacob?</i>

25
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,700
Go, go!

26
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,450
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

27
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,870
- Yes!
- Jacob, dinner.

28
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,960
Have you finished your homework?

29
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,170
- Yes. You just killed me.
- Good. Now that you're dead,

30
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,630
you can shut that off
and come down for dinner.

31
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,430
- Did you order pepperoni tonight?
- Nope. Are these clean?

32
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,680
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- We've had pizza twice this week,

33
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,640
so I made you a proper meal tonight...

34
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,600
- with vegetables.
- <i>Vegetables?</i>

35
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,230
Stop being such a stepmom.

36
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,900
Where'd you get this?

37
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,070
It was Dad's.

38
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,860
Yeah, I know. Where was it?

39
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,740
I found it in the downstairs bathroom.
It's mine now.

40
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,960
Okay.

41
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,790
Okay.

42
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,790
- Come on. I said please shut that off.
- <i>You didn't say "please."</i>

43
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,670
- Jacob.
- Helen.

44
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,470
- Hello?
- <i>Helen Benson?</i>

45
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,810
- Yes.
- <i>Dr. Helen Benson?</i>

46
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,890
<i>You're at 106 Longwood Road?</i>

47
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,150
- Who is this?
- <i>Someone should be there shortly.</i>

48
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,480
What do you mean, someone's coming here?
Who is this?

49
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,240
<i>Everything will be explained to you en route.</i>

50
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,320
En route where?

51
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,120
- Hello?
- <i>They should be there soon.</i>

52
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,200
<i>Yes. They're at your door now.</i>

53
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,580
Hold on a minute.

54
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,380
Dr. Benson, if you'll come with us.

55
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,300
- What's happening?
- Everything will be explained.

56
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,300
But you must come with us right away.

57
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,260
Am I under arrest?

58
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,600
- You're in federal custody.
- Why?

59
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
What is this about?

60
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,060
Everything will be explained en route.

61
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,730
- I have a child here.
- Is there anyone who can look after the boy?

62
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,110
- No.
- Can his father take care of him?

63
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,740
- No, his father isn't here.
- I can take care of myself.

64
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,700
Jacob, you can't take care of yourself.
There's just no way--

65
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,320
- You're coming with us, Dr. Benson.
- Helen?

66
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,420
Jacob, grab your coat.
You're gonna stay at Isabel's.

67
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,170
<i>Attention, Bravo.
Prepare to move out. Over.</i>

68
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,340
It's gonna be okay.

69
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,470
Dr. Benson, there isn't much time.

70
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,430
Okay, we've got her. Let's go.

71
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,250
Two stoplights down, then left,
there's an on-ramp for the highway.

72
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,910
- Do you see it?
- This must be a mistake.

73
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,210
Helen Benson.
Social security number: 51-48-7843?

74
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,920
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- It's no mistake.

75
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,920
- What is this about?
- Everything will be explained.

76
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,260
- Stop the car. Can you stop the car, please?
- Ma'am--

77
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,430
<i>I am not under arrest. You can't do this.</i>

78
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,260
- This is a matter of national security. You're just gonna--
- National security?

79
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,270
That just means whatever you want it to mean.

80
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,560
I'm just asking you to tell me
why I'm needed,

81
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,440
- or to let me go.
- I can't tell you why you're needed, because I don't know.

82
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,320
- But I know they need you, and I know it's urgent.
- How do you know that?

83
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,110
Where are all the cars?

84
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,910
- They shut down the highway.
- They shut it down?

85
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,540
- For what?
- For us.

86
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,370
I was driving up my driveway--

87
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,790
<i>I was on the computer--</i>

88
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,880
- Hi. I'm Yusef.
- Helen.

89
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,130
Helen, do you have any idea
why this is happening to us?

90
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,170
- No.
- <i>Well, think.</i>

91
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,010
- What do we have in common?
- What do you do for a living, Yusef?

92
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,710
- I'm a nuclear physicist.
- I'm an astronomer.

93
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,810
- Geologist.
- I'm an astrobiologist.

94
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,820
Fossil record study?

95
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,730
No. Microbiology.
Theories of life beyond Earth.

96
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,230
- All right, so we're all scientists.
- No, not me.

97
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,150
- I'm a civil engineer.
- <i>Put it all together, and what do you get?</i>

98
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,530
I've participated in government mobilizations
like this before.

99
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,700
War games in preparations for certain scenarios.

100
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,110
- Is that what you think this is?
- No.

101
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,990
Whatever it is, it's not a game.

102
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,130
<i>No! Keep those vehicles moving! Let's go!</i>

103
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,070
<i>Your attention, please!</i>

104
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,450
<i>Make your way directly across the courtyard
to the main barracks.</i>

105
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,370
<i>Leave all your cell phones
and cameras here.</i>

106
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,500
I repeat: cell phones and cameras
are not allowed inside.

107
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,670
Leave any cell phones and cameras here.

108
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,170
<i>Helen!
Will you bring her up?</i>

109
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,210
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you need to give up
your cell phones and your cameras.</i>

110
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,260
- <i>Your attention, please!</i>
- Thank you.

111
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,890
<i>Make your way directly across the courtyard
to the main barracks.</i>

112
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,390
- <i>Helen.</i>
- Hi, Michael.

113
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,430
- Been a long time.
- Are you behind all this?

114
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,980
- Yes. I'm glad you came.
- It's not like I had a choice.

115
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,230
Sorry about that.
I had you put on the vital list.

116
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,110
- I thought it was important to have you a part of this team.
- Why?

117
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,820
I've been keeping up with the work
that you've been doing with Professor Barnhardt.

118
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,820
What does it have to do with this?

119
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,860
I'll have to crash-brief you
in the conference room.

120
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,370
Object 07-493...

121
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,710
<i>was first spotted just beyond Jupiter's orbit
by the Spaceguard Program.</i>

122
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,090
<i>It was notable for the fact
that it was not moving in an asteroidal ellipse,</i>

123
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,130
but rather, it had a hyperbolic orbit...

124
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,640
and was shooting through our solar system.

125
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,560
The object is moving at speeds of up to
three times 10 to the seventh meters per second.

126
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,810
<i>At first, it was projected to pass
millions of miles outside of Earth's orbit.</i>

127
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,820
However, we soon discovered that...

128
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,400
the object was not following
a gravitationally free fall trajectory.

129
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,200
As such,

130
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,450
its path was recalculated.

131
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,170
It was at this time a crisis response team
was activated...

132
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,590
and everything you see around you
was set in motion.

133
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,260
Can we launch a missile to intercept it?

134
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,430
<i>The military's attempting to do just that.
In fact, they may launch several.</i>

135
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,850
But given the speed at which
this object is moving,

136
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,560
our chances of success are slim at best.

137
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,310
- Why don't they evacuate the area?
- <i>We simply do not have enough time.</i>

138
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,730
The affected area contains
some eight million inhabitants.

139
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,110
The best we can do is to plan for the aftermath.

140
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,950
How long do we have?

141
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,000
Seventy-eight minutes.

142
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,540
<i>Hey, what did the cops want anyway?</i>

143
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,760
Well, there's gonna be...

144
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,970
a big storm tonight.

145
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,970
And...

146
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,180
they needed some scientists to help out.

147
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,390
You know with...

148
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,430
planning stuff.

149
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,480
So, um,

150
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,320
pretty soon, you're all gonna go down
to the basement, okay?

151
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,740
- I already told Isabel.
- <i>I haven't seen anything on TV about--</i>

152
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,160
Jacob, just--

153
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,240
just do it, all right?

154
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,330
<i>All right. I should go.</i>

155
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,330
Wait. Um, can we talk...

156
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,210
just a little bit longer?

157
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,250
<i>We're having dinner now.
I really should go.</i>

158
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,170
You know, I love you very much.

159
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,590
<i>Okay. Bye, Helen.</i>

160
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Is that a cell phone?

161
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,860
Can I borrow it?

162
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,740
What are the odds of an asteroid
making impact on Manhattan?

163
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,160
- Astronomical. Plus, there's no light signature.
- Then it can't be an asteroid.

164
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,040
- A primordial black hole, perhaps.
- You know what that would mean?

165
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,130
Whatever it is, if this object is moving...

166
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,760
at three times 10 to the seventh meters per second,
there will be no aftermath.

167
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,470
If they can't stop it before it hits,
there will be nothing left but dust.

168
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,140
It will sterilize the Earth.
This is all theater.

169
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,350
They're sayin' we lost launch capabilities.

170
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,730
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

171
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,480
- The missile's disabled.
- Disabled by what?

172
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,610
- They don't know.
- <i>But they can restore it, right?</i>

173
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,940
There's a fallback! They have to launch!

174
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,910
Object impact in seven.

175
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,910
- <i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.</i>
- Six. Five.

176
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,460
- Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
- <i>Four.</i>

177
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,960
- <i>on Earth as it is in heaven.</i>
- <i>Three. Two.</i>

178
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,590
<i>One.</i>

179
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,430
Where is it?

180
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,350
- Could they have made a mistake?
- <i>Wait!</i>

181
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,180
Roger that.
They're saying the object's still on its approach.

182
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,350
Well, then where is it?

183
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,610
- <i>It's slowing down.</i>
- I see it.

184
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,860
Radiation levels are slightly elevated,
but it's not dangerous.

185
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,030
I'm getting a lot of electrostatic interference.

186
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,950
Yeah, me too.

187
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,170
Did you feel that?

188
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,920
Feel what?

189
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
I feel it.

190
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,930
It's close.

191
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,580
Checkmate 0-6. Who has tactical command here?

192
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,040
This is 29-17. I need to know
who has jurisdiction on this site.

193
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,130
<i>Checkmate 0-3, this is Gator 2-3.</i>

194
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,680
<i>We're blind here.</i>

195
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,010
<i>Checkmate 0-6, actual.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

196
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,310
<i>What the hell is that thing?</i>

197
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,810
<i>I need the rules of engagement now!</i>

198
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,940
<i>Target is advancing.
Repeat: Target is advancing.</i>

199
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,200
<i>Sniper team leaders, come back.</i>

200
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,460
- <i>Do not fire!</i>
- <i>It's coming right at us!</i>

201
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,170
- <i>Hold your fire! Hold your fire!</i>
- <i>Do we engage?</i>

202
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,760
- <i>Do not fire!</i>
- <i>Fire! Fire!</i>

203
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,930
- Cease fire!
- All stations, cease fire! Cease fire!

204
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,810
Don't shoot! Do not shoot!

205
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,070
We need a medic!

206
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,160
<i>Klaatu, barada, nikto.</i>

207
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,030
We need that D.N.A. swab.
D.N.A. swab now!

208
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,200
- It's soaking through.
- <i>What's the O2, stat?</i>

209
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,910
Get me the O2, stat!

210
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,120
Go. No one else.

211
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,710
Let's go!

212
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,260
<i>What am I supposed to do now?
Do I start an I.V.?</i>

213
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,270
No. We don't know its physiology.
For all we know, the fluids may kill it.

214
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,690
- <i>What do I do? What do I do?</i>
- Its blood is red. It must have hemoglobin.

215
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,650
- Okay, she's right. Start the drip.
- Okay. I can't find a vein.

216
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,110
- It doesn't have any veins.
- Look for a central line site then.

217
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,280
<i>It's going into cardiac arrest. Defib?</i>

218
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,320
- Yeah. Get in there now. Go! Go!
- Clear!

219
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,370
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- The monitor shorted out.

220
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,740
Heart rate is stabilizing. It's stabilizing.

221
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,370
<i>What now? What now?</i>

222
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,750
Do you have a surgeon?

223
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,510
Normally for a gunshot,
we'd be using a general anesthetic.

224
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,350
But as we don't know
how the patient will react,

225
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,390
I have opted for a local.

226
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,770
I'm making the first incision... now.

227
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,990
No explosions.

228
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,160
<i>So far, so good.</i>

229
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,410
Pale flesh.

230
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,410
The texture--

231
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,540
Something akin to--
What?

232
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,380
Whale blubber.

233
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,380
I'm taking a specimen now.

234
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,550
Let's pack that on ice and chopper it
to a genomics lab for D.N.A. mapping.

235
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,550
I'd like a sample of that as well.

236
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,180
<i>I am entering the wound.</i>

237
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,270
And--

238
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,350
My God.

239
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,900
What is this? I'm-I'm sorry.

240
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,320
I'm-I'm a little taken aback.

241
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,360
- <i>What's wrong?</i>
- <i>Nothing's wrong.</i>

242
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,110
That's the thing. It's all so familiar.

243
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,870
The outer layer of the flesh
is exotic, it's strange,

244
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,450
<i>but as I go deeper,</i>

245
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,330
<i>there's muscle, vein, nerve, bone.</i>

246
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,330
<i>I'm extracting...</i>

247
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,500
the bullet.

248
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,880
This gray flesh,

249
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,510
it seems to be just falling away.

250
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,560
It's-- It's removing itself.

251
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,690
I think I need to keep extracting it.

252
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,190
<i>Yes. Continue.</i>

253
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,530
Can you explain any of this?

254
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,380
It's dreaming.

255
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,380
Any signs of neural activity?

256
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,220
<i>It lit up the F.M.R.I.
like Times Square.</i>

257
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,220
Get help.

258
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,310
Code white. Subject is conscious.

259
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,810
Help!

260
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,030
It's looking at you.
Try saying something to it.

261
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,620
My name is Dr. Helen Benson.

262
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,620
We're trying to help you.

263
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,120
You have nothing to fear from us.

264
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,170
Help you. Nothing to fear.

265
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,340
<i>Global markets are panicked
in early trading this morning...</i>

266
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,800
<i>in response to the crisis in Central Park.</i>

267
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,850
<i>Trading has been halted on the New York Stock Exchange,
the Nikkei and the Hang Seng...</i>

268
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,060
<i>as Manhattan prepares for a massive evacuation.</i>

269
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,150
<i>In other cities around the world,
people are voluntarily evacuating population centers,</i>

270
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,230
<i>fearing that the sphere in Central Park...</i>

271
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,400
<i>may be the vanguard
of an impending alien invasion.</i>

272
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,400
<i>The president and the vice president...</i>

273
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,650
<i>have been taken to separate
and secure locations.</i>

274
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,990
Until this situation has some kind of resolve,

275
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,160
I am the eyes and the ears of the presidency.

276
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,870
- So, what do we know?
- Madam Secretary,

277
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,830
we lost contact with one of our D.S.C.S.-3
listening satellites...

278
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,630
- orbiting Earth.
- What is that image?

279
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,170
- Are you saying the sphere in Central Park isn't the only one?
- In fact, we have intelligence...

280
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,010
that smaller spheres have landed
at other locations around the world.

281
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,260
Do we have briefings on that?
And where are these spheres right now?

282
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,810
- How is that even possible?
- I think we're asking the wrong questions.

283
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,220
What questions should we be asking?

284
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,940
Well, let's start with this.
Where is our satellite?

285
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,900
- We lost contact with it.
- In the scheme of things,

286
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
the loss of one satellite
isn't necessarily our concern.

287
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,440
D.S.C.S.-3 stands for
Defense Systems Communications Satellite.

288
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,780
Remember what it communicates with?

289
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,660
They were able to access our defense mainframe
via that satellite.

290
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,410
That's how they temporarily shut down
our missile defenses and entered our airspace.

291
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,250
- <i>We have changed all the codes.</i>
- And on top of that,

292
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,670
there is a vast amount of vital intelligence
on that mainframe.

293
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,630
They know everything about us now.

294
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,960
- And we know nothing about them.
- Almost nothing.

295
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,300
The fact that they chose
to disable our defenses tells us...

296
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,680
something about their intentions.

297
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,180
Madam Secretary,
we brought in several specialists...

298
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,600
to analyze the tissue samples
we harvested from the being.

299
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,690
This is our chief geneticist,
Dr. Hideo Ikegawa.

300
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,860
This is our chief astrobiologist,
Dr. Helen Benson.

301
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,320
- Hello.
- <i>Doctor?</i>

302
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,570
The being is in a nascent state.

303
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,990
The D.N.A. samples we've taken seem to represent
three distinct life forms.

304
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,990
Three different D.N.A. types?

305
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,710
<i>Yes, including the being's brain.</i>

306
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,040
The body tissue is human,
as far as we can tell.

307
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,670
The gray flesh encasing it
is organic material.

308
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,800
Some kind of bioengineered space suit.

309
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,340
What it resembles, oddly enough,
is placental tissue.

310
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,680
Which makes sense, given that placenta's
a life-support system.

311
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,060
And that basically, in order to survive
in our environment,

312
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,100
the being had to be born here...

313
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,520
in its human form.

314
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,480
They must've come here in the past
and obtained a D.N.A. sample from a human subject.

315
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,570
Now, since that birth,

316
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,320
the being has grown exponentially.

317
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,160
This is one hour after surgery.

318
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,950
<i>Three hours.</i>

319
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,080
- Six hours.
- How much can you tell us about it...

320
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,790
- by decoding its D.N.A.?
- <i>Um, you don't understand.</i>

321
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,500
These are the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Geneticists...

322
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,460
- are gonna be studying this code for generations.
- No, they aren't.

323
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:33,390
This code is the property of the U.S. government.
Its very existence is classified.

324
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,470
I wanna see it.

325
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,440
Water.

326
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,200
- Bring him up.
- Does it actually speak our language,

327
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,660
or does it just parrot what it's heard?

328
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,330
No, it seems to already understand our language.

329
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,750
<i>They've compromised our satellites.
They know everything about us.</i>

330
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,080
Mr. Driscoll.

331
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,980
<i>My name is Regina Jackson.</i>

332
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,200
I'm the secretary of defense
of the United States of America.

333
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,080
This body will take some getting used to.

334
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,500
I've been sent here to determine who
or what you represent...

335
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,960
and what your intentions are.

336
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,760
It feels unreal to me.

337
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,220
Alien.

338
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,350
It'll take time to adapt.

339
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,440
What were you... before you were human?

340
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,940
Different.

341
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,950
Different how?

342
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,570
It would only frighten you.

343
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,370
- Do you have a name?
- Klaatu.

344
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,130
Do you represent a civilization?

345
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,630
I represent a group of civilizations.

346
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,100
- Where is this group of civilizations?
- All around you.

347
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,060
<i>What is your purpose in coming here?</i>

348
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,310
There is a gathering of world leaders
not far from here.

349
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,520
I will explain my purpose to them.

350
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,690
I'm afraid that's not possible.

351
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,610
Perhaps you should explain yourself
to me instead.

352
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Do you speak for the entire human race?

353
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,620
I speak for the president of the United States.

354
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,750
<i>Now, please, tell me.</i>

355
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,290
Why have you come to our planet?

356
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,050
- Your planet?
- Yes.

357
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,170
This is our planet.

358
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,550
No. It is not.

359
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,390
We've decided to sedate him
and move him to a more secure location.

360
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,060
- Are you going to interrogate him?
- That's a possibility.

361
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,100
Madam Secretary, as scientists,
we can't consent to this.

362
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,860
He says he wants to speak to the U.N.

363
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,150
History has lessons to teach us
about first encounters...

364
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,150
between civilizations.

365
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,120
As a rule, the less-advanced civilization
is either exterminated or enslaved.

366
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,910
I'm thinking of Pizarro and the Incas,

367
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,540
Columbus and the Native Americans,
and the list goes on.

368
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,290
Unfortunately, in this case,

369
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,290
the less-advanced civilization is us.

370
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,170
This is a representative
of an extraterrestrial civilization.

371
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,470
This is the most important discovery
in the history of mankind.

372
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,260
It may well be the last discovery
in the history of mankind.

373
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,770
<i>We need to know what they're planning,
and we need to know now.</i>

374
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,480
<i>So you wanna drug him?
Interrogate him? I'm sorry.</i>

375
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,360
- We won't do that. You understand?
- I understand completely.

376
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,690
Of course, if you won't do it,
we'll have to call in someone who will.

377
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,400
<i>Well, I'm sure you can find
someone who will help you with--</i>

378
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,080
- I'll do it.
- Helen.

379
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,580
I'll do it.

380
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,350
That won't be necessary, Doctor.

381
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,230
We've already prepared the solution for you.

382
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,240
I just need a syringe.

383
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,500
<i>I want to apologize to you.</i>

384
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,670
<i>It seems we got off to a bad start.</i>

385
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,550
- It seems we did.
- We're going to transport you...

386
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,380
to a different facility
for better medical care.

387
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,050
No, you are not.

388
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,260
Excuse me?

389
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,520
- I am leaving.
- I can't allow you to do that.

390
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,150
- It is not up to you.
- <i>This is a military installation.</i>

391
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,440
<i>You're surrounded by hundreds of soldiers.
There's no leaving here.</i>

392
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,360
I have done nothing wrong.

393
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,780
You invaded our airspace.

394
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:47,370
That... automaton that emerged from the sphere,
it attacked our troops.

395
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,450
It acted to defend me.

396
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,120
It activates in the presence of violence.

397
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,870
Dr. Benson, please.

398
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Run.

399
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
It's done.

400
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,650
If you'll come with us, ma'am.

401
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,510
Keep moving, please.

402
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,060
I'm going to ask you
a series of control questions.

403
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,450
Are you currently in a seated position?

404
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,120
Yes.

405
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,490
Are you human?

406
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
My body is.

407
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,090
Do you feel pain?

408
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,630
My body does.

409
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,890
Are you aware of an impending attack...

410
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,640
on the planet Earth?

411
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,640
You should let me go.

412
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,530
I'll repeat the question.

413
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,560
What gate did you use to enter this base?

414
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,140
- East loading door.
- How do I get there?

415
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,560
100 yards left from the back of this building.

416
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,980
Is there a security code?

417
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,610
Four-four-bravo-three-zero.

418
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,990
What size is that suit?

419
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,080
- Forty-two long.
- Take it off.

420
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:02,750
<i>Attention. All security personnel,
report to your designated posts.</i>

421
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,580
<i>All civilian personnel
report to Operations immediately.</i>

422
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,550
I'm leaving you now.

423
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,390
No.

424
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,460
<i>Put every arm of the government--</i>

425
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,050
<i>military, law enforcement, federal, state and local--
on high alert.</i>

426
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:56,010
- If the media gets word that we've lost the being--
- Use a cover story.

427
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,680
We can't risk a panic.
Call him an escaped convict.

428
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,060
Use every surveillance satellite,
every drone aircraft,

429
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,720
<i>every freeway camera.</i>

430
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:07,140
<i>Use every resource we've got.</i>

431
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,530
<i>Attention: All scheduled trains...</i>

432
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:20,030
<i>into and out of Penn Station
to Manhattan are canceled...</i>

433
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,830
<i>due to the security perimeter
in Central Park.</i>

434
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,220
Excuse me. Excuse me.

435
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:47,520
<i>We are committed to providing you
with quality service.</i>

436
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,770
<i>Thank you.</i>

437
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,860
<i>We ask that our passengers
remain calm and orderly...</i>

438
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,410
<i>during these difficult circumstances.</i>

439
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:10,420
<i>Any disturbance will be subject
to immediate arrest by transit police.</i>

440
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,380
Let's go.

441
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,670
- Back off.
- Don't push me!

442
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,880
- <i>Look, I'm warning you.
- <i>I don't--</i>

443
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,920
- <i>Just give me the ticket!</i>
- <i>I'm not giving you anything. Just--</i>

444
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:25,100
Give me the--
What's the matter with you?

445
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,480
- Hey!
- Go and get him.

446
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,780
- <i>We have a man down.</i>
- <i>Unrest is causing leaders around the world...</i>

447
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,160
<i>to criticize the U.S. response
to the arrival of the spheres.</i>

448
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,160
<i>Reactions from both national...</i>

449
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,290
<i>and international religious communities
have been varied.</i>

450
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,290
<i>While some have responded with hope and measured optimism,
most religious communities...</i>

451
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,210
<i>have considered recent events
to be apocalyptic.</i>

452
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,800
<i>At gatherings and prayer vigils
in virtually every major city,</i>

453
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,090
<i>many see the arrival
of the Central Park sphere...</i>

454
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,300
<i>as a sign of a new era,
or perhaps even the end of the world.</i>

455
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,080
<i>Leaders around the world are protesting
the U.S.'s decision...</i>

456
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,790
<i>to deny foreign scientists
full access to the being.</i>

457
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,790
<i>Have you done your homework?</i>

458
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,000
School's canceled on account of the aliens.

459
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,210
- <i>They say it's an invasion.</i>
- Well, they're wrong.

460
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,930
- What makes you so sure?
- I just know.

461
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,220
Don't get that!

462
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,550
- Jacob!
- Hello?

463
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,970
- <i>May I speak to Dr. Helen Benson, please?</i>
- It's for you.

464
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,690
Hello?

465
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,270
- <i>Dr. Helen Benson?</i>
- Yes.

466
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,320
<i>I'm calling from Newark Penn Station.</i>

467
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,610
I've got your patient here.

468
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,200
Oh. Um, sorry.
I think there's been a mistake.

469
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,530
<i>Um, I'm not that kind of a doctor.</i>

470
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,830
<i>Hold-Hold on a second.</i>

471
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,370
<i>He says you got his medicine.</i>

472
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,790
I'll be right there.

473
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,140
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

474
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,930
Excuse me!

475
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:33,220
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Somebody called me.
My name's Dr. Benson.

476
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,390
Good. He's over there.
He's your problem now.

477
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,600
<i>Go ahead, take him. He's your problem.</i>

478
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:47,410
<i>I need my bag!</i>

479
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,280
<i>It's a black bag.</i>

480
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:54,620
<i>Evacuation registration point
located two blocks this way.</i>

481
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,080
You know, I took a huge risk
back at the hospital.

482
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,500
Did I make a mistake?

483
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,710
Are you a friend to us?

484
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,010
I'm a friend to the Earth.

485
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:12,180
<i>Let's keep it steady, folks.
Let's keep going forward.</i>

486
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,980
- Hello.
- Hi.

487
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,650
Okay. Now what?

488
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,700
Drive.

489
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,420
Look in your pocket.

490
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,050
Your inside pocket.

491
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,750
Turn left.

492
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,190
<i>Striker two-eight-two-niner,
descend and maintain 2,000...</i>

493
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,310
<i>to establish the vectors
to the target area.</i>

494
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,110
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

495
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,900
All right, everybody, we got our mission!

496
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,950
All right. Target acquired and confirmed, sir.
We are locked on.

497
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,030
<i>Madam Secretary,
they're sending in the drones.</i>

498
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,200
Bring in the reapers! We are go!

499
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,460
- Roger that. Descending to 1,200.
- Let's light this thing up.

500
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,510
<i>That's affirmative. In motion now.</i>

501
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:15,050
- <i>Ground forces have been activated.</i>
- Arm your Sidewinder missiles.

502
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,350
<i>Roger that, Colonel.
Sidewinder missiles armed.</i>

503
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,150
- He's activating.
- Fire! Fire, fire!

504
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,820
- Missiles intercepted!
- Get out of there!

505
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:40,370
- <i>Withdraw and realign for another sortie.</i>
- <i>Negative!</i>

506
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,210
I've lost link! I've lost control!

507
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,380
Who's in control of the aircraft then?

508
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,050
<i>Striker 2-8 headed for "R" perimeter.
I am out of control!</i>

509
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,560
Anyone got any other ideas?

510
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,650
<i>Why are people running?</i>

511
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,820
We should stay and fight.

512
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,280
They didn't come here to hurt us.

513
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,950
Well, we should kill 'em anyway,
just to make sure.

514
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,040
- <i>Don't say that.</i>
- <i>That's what Dad would've done.</i>

515
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,330
- I think he would've looked for a different way.
- He would've fought.

516
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,420
I like to think I knew him pretty well.

517
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,880
I knew him too, longer than you.

518
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,630
- What do you think?
- Of what?

519
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,390
Should people run,
or should we stay and fight?

520
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:43,470
- Neither.
- <i>What should we do then?</i>

521
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,520
There's nothing you can do.

522
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:51,230
This is it. Pull in here.

523
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,410
McDonald's?

524
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,830
Where are you going?

525
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,420
- <i>Jacob, where are you going?</i>
- To the bathroom.

526
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,260
Where is the boy's father?

527
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,300
He's dead.

528
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:23,140
- How did he die?
- He was in the army.

529
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,600
So the boy wishes his soldier father were here...

530
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,940
to rescue the world from the aliens?

531
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,690
The boy wishes his father were here
for a lot of reasons,

532
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:35,110
aliens being the least of them.

533
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,530
He wasn't even that kind of a soldier.

534
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:45,160
He was an engineer.
He went over there to build,

535
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:48,290
- not to fight.
- And his mother?

536
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,590
She died when he was a baby.

537
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:58,760
I married his father, and... a year ago,
he was killed.

538
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,310
Why did you come here?

539
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,180
I came to save the Earth.

540
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:13,440
- From what?
- He's here.

541
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,870
<i>And number 44. Forty-four's ready.</i>

542
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,990
Your tea, Grandfather.

543
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,080
Thank you.

544
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,430
Are you one of them?

545
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,890
One of who?

546
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,560
No. Never mind. Sorry.

547
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,440
You've been out of contact
for a long time.

548
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,980
I had a dangerous assignment.

549
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,860
This is hostile territory.

550
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,440
I've noticed.

551
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:01,780
I was hoping I could reason with them.

552
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,240
I'm afraid they are not a reasonable race.

553
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:10,450
I've been living amongst them
for seventy years now.

554
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,370
I know them well.

555
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:14,880
And?

556
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,250
Any attempt to intercede with them
would be futile.

557
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,880
They are destructive,

558
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,720
and they won't change.

559
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:28,640
Is that your official report?

560
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,980
The tragedy is, they know
what's going to become of them.

561
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,270
They sense it.

562
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,530
But they can't seem to do anything about it.

563
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,580
It's decided then.

564
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,870
I'll begin the process as soon as possible.

565
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,170
We should make preparations
for our departure.

566
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,590
I'm staying.

567
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,840
<i>You can't stay here.</i>

568
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,180
I can, and I will.

569
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,340
If you stay, you'll die.

570
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,010
<i>I know.</i>

571
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,310
<i>This is my home now.</i>

572
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:16,060
You yourself called them a destructive race.

573
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,520
<i>That's true.</i>

574
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:22,860
<i>But still, there is another side.</i>

575
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:26,450
You see, I-- I love them.

576
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,660
This is a very strange thing.

577
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,210
I-I-I can't find a way to explain it to you.

578
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,460
For many years, I--

579
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,840
I cursed my luck for being sent here.

580
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,760
Human life is difficult.

581
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,180
But as this life is coming to an end,

582
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,430
I consider myself lucky...
to have lived it.

583
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,610
<i>Copy that, Base.</i>

584
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,360
No sudden movements, no aggressive actions.

585
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,400
No matter what happens, no gunfire.

586
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:09,320
Track is in place, sir.
Containment panels are in position.

587
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,990
- We're ready on your order.
- On my command,

588
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,330
move the panels into place.

589
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,080
- Three.
- <i>Three.</i>

590
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,420
- Two.
- <i>Two.</i>

591
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,880
One.

592
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,540
<i>Synchronize established.
I.S.I. ready to copy.</i>

593
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,760
<i>Containment panels are secure.</i>

594
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:38,350
<i>And... we're still here.</i>

595
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:47,440
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

596
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:50,410
<i>The escaped convict they showed on the news,
I just saw the guy at the gas station.</i>

597
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,450
- <i>Can you describe him?</i>
- <i>He was in a little car.</i>

598
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,040
<i>911. What is your emergency.</i>

599
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,120
<i>I just saw that wanted man
over by the McDonald's.</i>

600
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,080
<i>Can you give me
a description of the car?</i>

601
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,000
- <i>A silver four-door with a woman and a kid.</i>
- <i>I need three units...</i>

602
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,250
- <i>to look for a silver Honda near Ochada orchard.</i>
- <i>Unit one responding.</i>

603
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,090
- <i>We are patrolling the orchards off I-67.</i>
- <i>HP-28 to follow up.</i>

604
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,550
This is it.

605
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,850
Stop here.

606
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,810
Should--

607
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,110
Uh, Helen, who is this guy?

608
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,400
- <i>A friend.</i>
- What kind of friend?

609
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,320
Scootch over. He's a work friend.

610
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,290
- What's his name?
- Klaatu.

611
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,000
- Klaatu?
- Yeah.

612
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,580
What kind of name is that?

613
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,170
It's foreign, I think.

614
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,170
I never heard you talk about him before.

615
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,840
Well, I haven't known him for very long.

616
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,510
We're just giving him a ride.

617
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:54,640
Where?

618
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,220
- Here.
- The forest?

619
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,900
Stay here.
I want you to lock the door, okay?

620
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,860
And don't open it for anyone but me.

621
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,940
I'm serious.

622
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,980
Helen, what's going on?

623
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,320
<i>We're getting images of these spheres
from all over the world.</i>

624
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,780
- Okavango, Gobi, Baku.
- Which of our agencies gathered this intel?

625
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,780
Ma'am, none of them.
We pulled these off the Internet.

626
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:14,590
Is that... them?

627
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,090
No.

628
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:20,090
It's us.
Those are ordinary cephalopods.

629
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:23,470
Squid. Octopus.

630
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,730
<i>I don't like him. He's weird, and--</i>

631
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:33,980
- Why are we driving him around anyway?
- Um--

632
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,570
It's complicated.

633
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:40,030
Is he comin' home with us?

634
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,860
No. No.

635
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:46,830
Well, what if you decide you like him,
and he wants to move in?

636
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,950
No, it's not like that.
God, no!

637
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,960
Listen to me.

638
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,420
No one is moving in.
You don't understand.

639
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,800
- Whatever. You wait for him. I'm goin' home.
- Jacob.

640
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:08,100
Jacob!

641
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:10,980
What is the matter with you?

642
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,350
<i>These spheres now appear to be leaving...</i>

643
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,430
<i>in the same mysterious manner as they came.</i>

644
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,060
<i>Hopefully, this mass exodus
will bring an end to the panic and unrest...</i>

645
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,810
<i>we've been seeing around the world.</i>

646
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,980
<i>The only sphere that
doesn't appear to be leaving...</i>

647
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,020
<i>is the giant sphere in Central Park.</i>

648
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,490
You think we scared 'em off?

649
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,610
They're not afraid of us.

650
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:19,130
I need to get back to the city.

651
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,670
Not until you tell me what's going on.

652
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,420
- Did you do that?
- Yes.

653
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:28,800
- <i>Jacob, get in the car.</i>
- He's one of them.

654
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:30,430
Please, get in the car.

655
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:34,180
Get in the car.

656
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,280
I need to know what's happening.

657
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:50,660
This planet is dying.

658
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,700
The human race is killing it.

659
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:55,120
So you've come here to help us?

660
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:58,330
No, I didn't.

661
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,630
You said you came to save us.

662
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:05,300
I said I came to save the Earth.

663
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,840
You came to save the Earth...

664
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,720
from us.

665
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:15,180
You came to save the Earth from us?

666
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:18,600
We can't risk the survival of this planet
for the sake of one species.

667
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:22,270
- What are you saying?
- If the Earth dies, you die.

668
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,440
If you die, the Earth survives.

669
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:28,160
There are only a handful of planets
in the cosmos...

670
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,570
that are capable of supporting complex life.

671
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,990
- You can't do this.
- This one can't be allowed to perish.

672
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,330
We can change.
We can still turn things around.

673
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,830
We've watched, we've waited
and hoped that you would change.

674
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,380
- Please.
- It's reached the tipping point.

675
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,130
- We have to act.
- Please!

676
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:46,260
We'll undo the damage you've done
and give the Earth a chance to begin again.

677
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,840
Don't do this.

678
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:51,430
Please! We could change.

679
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,680
<i>We can change.</i>

680
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:58,980
The decision is made.
The process has begun.

681
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,980
Oh, God.

682
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,620
<i>Adam 85 confirming.</i>

683
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,660
<i>10-4, Central.</i>

684
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,080
It won't make any difference, Helen.

685
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,170
Even if they arrest me,

686
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,920
even if they kill me,
the process will continue.

687
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:30,550
Both of you, hands on the car, right now!

688
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,260
Is that a child in the car?

689
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:35,890
- Yes.
- <i>This is HP-28.</i>

690
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:39,390
I'm on I-67.
I have the F.B.I. suspect in custody,

691
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,810
along with one adult female
and one child.

692
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,560
- <i>Awaiting instructions.</i>
- <i>7-0-140. Roger.</i>

693
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,940
Tell the child to get out of the car.

694
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:50,150
- <i>Get the kid out of the car!</i>
- Honey, come on.

695
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,030
<i>Okay, you two, over there.</i>

696
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,030
<i>You, I'm not gonna tell you again.</i>

697
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,410
- Hands on the car.
- Please don't hurt him.

698
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,920
- I'm not gonna hurt him, so long as he--
- I wasn't talking to you.

699
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,790
The pain will only last a moment.

700
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:23,020
You killed him! You killed him!

701
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:25,730
- Jacob. Jacob!
- Let me finish.

702
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,820
- You killed him! You killed him!
- Shh. Shh. Come here.

703
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:32,320
- You killed him!
- All right. Sit down.

704
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,700
- <i>He killed him!</i>
- <i>Shh!</i>

705
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,780
<i>He killed him!</i>

706
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,330
He'll be all right.

707
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:26,250
I don't understand.

708
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:30,800
You're gonna kill us all,
but you saved him.

709
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,380
He was an obstacle.
I meant him no harm.

710
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:39,470
You could stop this, couldn't you,
if you wanted to?

711
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,480
I tried to reason with you.
I tried to speak with your leaders.

712
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,600
Those aren't our leaders.

713
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:48,270
You wanna speak to one of our leaders,
I'll take you to one.

714
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,860
<i>Let me take you.</i>

715
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,370
Get in the car.

716
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:02,910
Maybe they were just collecting specimens
from our planet.

717
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,910
It's not our planet.

718
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,580
That what he said to me in the hospital.

719
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,670
An ark.

720
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,630
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
- It's an ark.

721
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,680
So are all the other spheres.

722
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,260
They're saving as many species
as they can.

723
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:27,270
- If the sphere is an ark, then what comes next is--
- The flood.

724
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,840
Karl, we're here.

725
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,760
Okay, let's get you settled.

726
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,770
<i>That's a Nobel Prize.</i>

727
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:13,020
<i>He won it for his work
in biological altruism.</i>

728
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:16,150
Probably still be in his desk drawer
if I hadn't gotten it framed for him.

729
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:22,450
- You tired?
- Just a little.

730
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,580
Close, but no.

731
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,500
I wouldn't--

732
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,670
He won't mind.

733
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:46,470
He's one of them.
You shouldn't be helping him.

734
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,560
We should stop him.

735
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,110
For just this once,
I need you to trust me.

736
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:43,320
Is it possible?

737
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:01,380
I have so many questions to ask you.

738
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,190
It's Bach.

739
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:22,530
It's beautiful.

740
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:25,240
So we're not so different after all.

741
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,950
I wish that were true.

742
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,790
<i>So is it a machine, or a living thing?</i>

743
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,960
- It's both. Or... neither.
- What do you mean, neither?

744
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,750
It seems to be some sort of
silicone-based hybrid.

745
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,220
We're calling it GORT--
Genetically Organized Robotic Technology.

746
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,300
Oh, the military and their acronyms.

747
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,510
We've used every diagnostic method available--

748
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,760
M.R.I., thermal imaging, PET scan.

749
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:54,350
But it was impervious.
So we attempted...

750
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,560
a robotically-assisted exploration
using a diamond drill.

751
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,610
- And?
- The drill bit fractured.

752
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:00,610
It'll take 24 hours to fix it robotically.

753
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:47,240
Colonel, we don't have 24 hours.

754
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,200
Send somebody in there
to fix that drill.

755
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:53,280
<i>Food and fuel hoarding
have led to shortages,</i>

756
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:56,330
<i>which erupted into looting incidents
throughout Asia and South America.</i>

757
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:58,210
<i>Outbreaks of rioting...</i>

758
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:01,920
<i>and unrest in such cities
as Guangdong, China, London and Chicago...</i>

759
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,510
<i>due to the shortages of such basic commodities
as fuel, food and drinking water.</i>

760
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:10,430
<i>Many point to the Central Park sphere as--</i>

761
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:13,100
<i>Amidst the chaos in the
New York-NewJersey areas,</i>

762
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:18,140
<i>local police are looking for an escaped convict
whose name is not being released.</i>

763
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:22,020
<i>Authorities believe that he is
a significant threat to the public...</i>

764
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,530
<i>and are asking for any information
that could lead to his capture.</i>

765
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:29,490
<i>If you have seen this man,
please contact the number on your screen below.</i>

766
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:33,870
There must be alternatives.
You must have some technology that can solve our problem.

767
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:36,410
Your problem is not technology.

768
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,790
The problem is you.

769
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:41,790
- You lack the will to change.
- Then help us change.

770
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,790
I cannot change your nature.

771
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,130
You treat the world
as you treat each other.

772
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:50,470
But every civilization reaches
a crisis point eventually.

773
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:54,350
- <i>Most of them don't make it.</i>
- Yours did. How?

774
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:57,680
Our sun was dying.
We had to evolve in order to survive.

775
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:00,810
So it was only when your world
was threatened with destruction...

776
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,900
that you became what you are now.

777
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,980
- Yes.
- Well, that's where we are.

778
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:09,150
You say we're on the brink of destruction,
and you're right.

779
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,900
But it's only on the brink...

780
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:14,030
that people find the will to change.

781
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,120
Only at the precipice do we evolve.

782
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,500
<i>This is our moment.</i>

783
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:23,880
<i>Don't take it from us.
We are close to an answer.</i>

784
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,220
What's wrong?

785
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:55,030
Jacob. Can you get your boots on?

786
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,370
He can't get caught.

787
01:12:57,490 --> 01:12:59,740
- What do I do?
- Change his mind.

788
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:02,660
Not with reason, but with yourself.

789
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,720
<i>It's too late for that.</i>

790
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,090
Jacob!

791
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:51,300
Down here! He's here!

792
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,550
- Down here! Down here!
- What are you doing?

793
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,590
- He's here!
- What are you doing?

794
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,350
- I'm trying to help them! That's why I called them.
- What?

795
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:01,640
- I told them where we are.
- Jacob, you didn't!

796
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,600
We shouldn't be helping him.

797
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,190
Jacob, I'm trying to help us.

798
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:08,600
We should kill him!
That's what Dad would've done.

799
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:10,650
You fight me on everything.
On everything!

800
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:14,070
- If my dad were here--
- But he isn't here! He's gone!

801
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,540
Jacob--

802
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:27,830
<i>We've extracted the female.
Returning to base.</i>

803
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:41,180
- <i>Got a visual on the male.</i>
- <i>Yeah, I see him.</i>

804
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:45,100
<i>Yep. Got it. Target acquired.
Permission to engage.</i>

805
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,810
<i>You are clear to engage.</i>

806
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:52,230
- <i>You are go to take out the target.</i>
- <i>Roger that.</i>

807
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:34,400
Please don't hurt me!

808
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,080
Thanks.

809
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,130
I don't know where we are.

810
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:03,140
Can you help me get home?

811
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:10,020
This way.

812
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:55,650
- He's come here to exterminate us, hasn't he?
- You can't stop him.

813
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:58,230
The only chance we have is
if he changes his mind.

814
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,530
You have to let me talk to him.

815
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,530
What makes you think he'll listen to you?

816
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:04,530
I don't know that he will.

817
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,780
But I think he trusts me,
and I don't think he wants to do this.

818
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:09,740
We have the situation under control.

819
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:12,370
Madam Secretary, General Quinn
needs to see you in the briefing room.

820
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:16,710
- He says it's urgent.
- You're not in control.

821
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:19,920
You don't know what he's capable of!

822
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:24,380
<i>But she didn't do anything wrong.
So they should let her go, right?</i>

823
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,890
You're afraid you're going
to be left alone.

824
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:33,430
I already am alone. Helen's just someone
that was stuck with me when my dad died.

825
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,520
You know?

826
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:41,230
Oh. I forgot. You're an alien.
You don't understand anything.

827
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,700
<i>We're good to go.</i>

828
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,800
Hold it.

829
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,550
Your sleeve.

830
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:09,550
<i>Oh.</i>

831
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:13,100
<i>Let-Let me out!</i>

832
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,060
- Open the air lock.
- No.

833
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,440
- <i>Open the door!</i>
- Then we have to flash.

834
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,610
- Our protocol--
- I decide what protocol is.

835
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:22,400
<i>Open the door! Let me out!</i>

836
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:24,240
- <i>Let me out!</i>
- Reset the drill.

837
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,950
<i>Open it!</i>

838
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:28,110
I said, reset the drill.

839
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,830
<i>Let me out! Let me out!
Open the door!</i>

840
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,080
<i>Let me out!</i>

841
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:43,340
Sir, the restraints!

842
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:39,770
Open the door!

843
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:42,190
Open the door!

844
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:45,190
This facility has been sealed.

845
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,860
No one leaves.

846
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,840
We've lost contact with the flash chamber, sir.

847
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,100
Whiskey task force, engage!

848
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:49,380
- <i>Were there any survivors?</i>
- No.

849
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:52,260
As you know, at 0524 hours,

850
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:54,800
our pilots launched a salvo
of Sidewinder air-to-air missiles...

851
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:57,100
- into the heart of the mass.
- And?

852
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,520
Every strike made it larger.

853
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,230
<i>And this mass--
Where is it heading?</i>

854
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:04,140
Everywhere.

855
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:56,360
Dr. Benson.

856
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:59,240
Madam Secretary, please.

857
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:03,000
I don't wanna die here in this room
without seeing my son one more time.

858
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:06,710
Do you really think you can persuade him?

859
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:09,670
I think you should let me try.

860
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,220
Go on, then.
But I make you no promises.

861
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,550
I still answer to the president.

862
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,510
- You're on your own.
- No, she's not. I'll go with you.

863
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,520
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

864
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:51,590
It doesn't work.

865
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:01,550
Go ahead.

866
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:11,360
It's me. Are you okay?

867
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:16,240
I'm fine. He's right here.

868
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,860
She wants to talk to you.

869
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,530
Yes.

870
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:26,450
I need to get back to the city.

871
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,790
- Yes.
- Tell her I know where we can meet her.

872
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:44,970
I told Helen we should kill you.

873
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:48,810
Yes, I heard that.

874
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:50,770
I didn't mean it, though.

875
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,440
- You didn't?
- Well, not anymore.

876
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:02,490
So what's gonna happen to us?

877
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:08,790
I was just wondering the same thing.

878
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:20,220
- End of the world!
- Good luck!

879
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,220
This is it.

880
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,430
This is where we're supposed to meet her.

881
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:26,510
Come on!

882
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:37,150
Hurry up. It's this way.

883
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,430
You can do this,

884
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,270
<i>just like with the trooper.</i>

885
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,860
There are some things I can't do.

886
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:20,320
But you have powers.

887
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:24,570
I'm sorry.

888
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:32,410
Please.

889
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:38,380
Jacob, nothing ever truly dies.

890
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:42,130
The universe wastes nothing.
Everything is simply...

891
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,170
transformed.

892
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:48,550
Just leave me alone.

893
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:34,600
- It's not fair.
- No.

894
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,390
No, it isn't fair.

895
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:41,060
He left me alone.

896
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:45,030
Oh, baby. You're not alone.

897
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:49,740
And he didn't leave you.
I see him in you...

898
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:52,240
all the time.

899
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:54,240
All the time.

900
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:57,660
Sometimes, it's hard for me to bear.

901
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,130
You miss him too?

902
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:04,170
So much.

903
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:12,180
I'm sorry.

904
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,850
Okay.

905
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:44,590
<i>It's all right.</i>

906
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:46,510
He's here to help.

907
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,510
There's another side to you.

908
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:59,140
I feel it now.

909
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:16,200
Is that how it ends?

910
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:20,370
Yes.

911
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:23,380
You can't stop it?

912
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:26,500
I don't know.

913
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:34,550
It would come at a price...
to you and your way of life.

914
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,600
But we can change.

915
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,600
You know that now.

916
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:43,060
Please. Please, just give us a chance.

917
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:50,110
I'll try. I must get back to the city.

918
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:13,380
<i>Of course, Mr. President,
I understand the situation.</i>

919
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:16,850
But with all due respect, sir,
any further military action...

920
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:18,850
will only make things worse.

921
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:22,270
I believe we may still be able
to open a dialogue--

922
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:31,070
Yes, Mr. President. As you wish, sir.

923
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:33,280
Thank you.

924
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:05,310
- Checkpoint.
- We can't stop. There isn't time.

925
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,160
Lincoln Bravo One to Lincoln Bravo Two.

926
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:22,740
<i>A black S.U.V. crashed our checkpoint with the suspects.
En route to your position.</i>

927
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:24,910
<i>Roger that, Bravo One.</i>

928
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:34,420
<i>Bravo One, we've got orders to let 'em through.
Do you copy?</i>

929
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:35,840
Roger that.

930
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:39,800
They're slowing down.

931
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:42,350
- They're letting us through.
- <i>Why?</i>

932
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:00,660
Where is everybody?

933
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:03,370
They've cleared the area.

934
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:06,540
- Stop the car.
- What?

935
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,870
Stop the car!

936
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,830
<i>Jacob. Jacob!</i>

937
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:51,370
- I'm okay.
- Jacob. Michael?

938
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,590
Michael.

939
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:05,100
We have to get to the sphere.

940
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,110
Helen!

941
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,630
We won't make it!

942
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:52,770
I can't keep them out for long.

943
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:00,990
Mom.

944
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:12,830
What's happening to him?
Jacob.

945
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,540
They're inside him.

946
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,840
He's dying.

947
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:22,470
Help him.

948
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:31,600
Help him. Please.

949
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:21,400
<i>Your professor was right.</i>

950
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:26,240
At the precipice, we change.

951
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:44,270
It's leaving.

952
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:54,570
No. He's leaving.
