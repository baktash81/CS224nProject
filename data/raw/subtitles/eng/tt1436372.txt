00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:17,973
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Elle.

3
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:26,381
All that Elle wanted to do, was sing.

00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:27,941
NASHVILLE NATIONAL GALLERY OF FAMOUS STARS

5
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:38,093
ELLE A MODERN FAIRY TALE

6
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,683
" What you think you're doing ?"

7
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,155
I said, " What you think you're doing ?"

8
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:46,551
is it possible when getting our Vanilla Latte today?

9
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:48,255
because they are not gonna get theirselves

10
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,957
Right, got it, Vanilla Lattes.

11
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:53,489
Listen up, Elliy this isn't fairy tale land

12
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,627
or Hekceville or wharever you are from.

13
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:57,672
it's Elle and I'm from Nashville.

14
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,034
Who cares Emily.

15
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,867
This is LA and we move fast around here.

16
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:05,342
So when I ask you to get me something, you better tatch

17
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,447
I'd listen to her if I were you

18
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:08,549
Yeah

19
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,617
So, Why that I brought up with her incompetence again?

20
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,280
Because her parents died in some horrible plane crash ...

21
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,986
and the president of our record label adopted her.

22
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:22,889
I think her parents were some kind of back-rancing study manager, or something like that.

23
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:26,498
- whatever, she better watch it.
- That's right.

24
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,128
Is this corset make me look fat?

25
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:31,839
- No
- Really?

26
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:33,434
Because I had eaten two MNM's today.

27
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,375
Elle, you need to be in point.

28
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:36,878
I know, but I'm just really tired.

29
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:39,074
An internship is important business

30
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:41,377
you said you wanted to work with me this summer, right?

31
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:44,318
- well, I did, but I just thought that ...
- Well then, work is work.

32
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:47,252
it was fun when call it thatl, and when you get paid?

33
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:49,552
- But it don't get paid.
- But you're having fun.

34
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:52,493
Hey Allen, I was thinking
What if the next shot.. If we used and try...

35
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:54,826
Iam Sorry, Iam sorry,Iam Sorry, Iam sorry,
Didn't I hire you to do that?

36
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,032
Exactly. Thank you.

37
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,967
Take this

38
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,058
Hey Uncle Allen ...

39
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:01,237
What do you think about me singing again?

40
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,671
I mean, I've been working on this song and ...

41
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,334
I think I told you that I don't think that you're ready yet

42
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:08,938
Well, can you just listen to it and then if this ...

43
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:10,378
Can we talk about it later?

44
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:15,942
Sensation treating you with care or what ?

45
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,681
- Cutist
- great.

46
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:20,188
Watch out for the cables
because they are all over the place

47
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,891
Good morning, sleepy head.

48
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:25,561
- Kit
- yeah

49
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:27,888
How long was they out for?

50
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:30,023
Just 15 minutes, nothing big

51
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:32,128
I mean..
what's up with Sensation?

52
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:33,934
were they horassing you again?

53
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:36,200
You know
I don't know why you take that from them, Elle.

54
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,371
They're Sensation.

55
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:41,902
I mean, do you know when that group  bringing in money at this company?

56
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:45,878
And besides, Uncle Allen told me to keep an eye for them.

57
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:48,019
I don't think he means being their slave.

58
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:51,884
I can't tell Uncle Allen, Kit
I mean, I am daughter probably that he didn't ask for

59
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:54,185
and then, has to send to college.

60
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:55,818
He's done enough for me

61
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:57,591
Hay, do you want anything from Cafe-Cafe?

62
00:05:57,731 --> 00:06:00,495
No, but you can tell Andy that I said "Hello".

63
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,462
Why don't you just come with me and tell him yourself ?

64
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:04,765
No! Not gonna happen, OK?

65
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:07,498
By the way, you were doing it again.

66
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:11,704
- What?
- You know. singing in your sleep.

67
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,879
I think this is weird, who does that?
Sleep singing

68
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,679
You know I don't sing anymore.

69
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:20,810
Well, I need to tell that to your dreams, because they obviously tend to holding them though.

70
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,788
- I gotta go.
- Okay, bye.

71
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:48,077
What is that?

72
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:51,277
Two moco-chocolates. Bang.

73
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:53,621
- Thank you. - Have a good one.

74
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:57,356
- Oh my bel, how goes it?
- The usual.

75
00:06:57,527 --> 00:06:59,893

- Yeah, they are all in the highist.

76
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:00,894

77
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,931
Yeah. I think it's the gases temp

78
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,034

79
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:08,229

82
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,005
Nothing for you today?

83
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,936
Not if it's on the house?

84
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:17,335

00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,447
you need to tell your bob's to get you company card.

87
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:23,052
Well, he is not my bob's.

88
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:25,778
And Iam not even really officially part of the company.

89
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:28,351
I mean, I am not even allowed to enter the recording studio ...

90
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:30,484

00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:18,600
and my days about to get a lot worse

120
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:22,843

Never touch you?

127
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,940

128
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,873

129
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,474
Iam.. Iam sorry, I did not know anyone was in here.

130
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,643
It's fine

131
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:05,615
- Iam just having a bad day you know.
- It happens.

132
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,554
It's my boss, sort of.

133
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,055
She's so mean for no reason.

134
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:14,255
Sometimes I wish she would just do one of her stupid dance moves right off the stage, you know

135
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,331
Bollies, right ?

136
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,933
well, thanks for listening any way

137
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:29,540
Just so you know, no one cares about your boss or your bad day.

138
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:35,978
and for the record, My mother create that stupid dance moves

139
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:38,422

140
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:42,923
I can already see it, Sensation, out!

141
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:52,398
SPUNN records

142
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,331
You've met Kit

143
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:57,274
She is the closest thing to a human being care.

144
00:10:57,343 --> 00:11:01,370
If you don't count Uncle Allen, who isn't even a real Uncle

145
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,070
That's a long story.

146
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,509
and Kit is an intern, Just like me.

147
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:09,380
Yes, there've been a new video coming out and it's gonna be big!

148
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:13,722
No, it's such a harsh word
So, I big you pardon maybe

149
00:11:14,326 --> 00:11:18,023
I'll tell Mr.Brian that you're big big fan's of his

150
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:21,196
I saw Andy today.

151
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:22,392
"And so?"

152
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:24,504
and he said that you should drink more coffee.

153
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:25,933
what you think he meant by that?

154
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:27,740
Maybe he likes to see you more

155
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:31,469
You know, I just haven't been drinking that much coffee lately. It's no big deal

156
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:35,412
I mean, everybody goes through phases and I am just in a last drinking coffee phase right now

157
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,075
You are such a dork

158
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:40,846
I mean if you were less defensive, you wouldn't sound nearly as guilty!

159
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:42,021
What!

160
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,321
Every time you talk about Andy the coffee guy, you get all crazy.

161
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:46,655
That's not true.

162
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:47,988
Really?

163
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:49,653
Okay fine, you got me.

164
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:51,096
But you tell anybody about this

165
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:54,896
And I will expose you
I'll tell everybody that you're a closet country singer

166
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:57,403
and Sensation is your favorite band.

167
00:11:58,473 --> 00:12:00,236
Speak of the devils

168
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:16,185
Would you like me to make another coffee now?

169
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,853
No, I think we've had more then enough coffee
thank you

170
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:22,430
You know you're lucky you're not dead meat

171
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:25,524
Thank God the wardrobe department had another outfit for our video show.

172
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:27,933
Otherwise, you would've ruin the entire thing

173
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,302
Sorry!

174
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:30,861
Yeah, I'm sure

175
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:32,031
Excuse me, everybody

176
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:33,539
- Hay Alen
-Hi girls. Good morning everyone.

177
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,474
I'm sure you are all familiar with the name Kandi Kane.

178
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:39,212
well, she is our newest client.

179
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:42,075
Her online video got one million clicks.

180
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,416
considering how blurry it was, I think she must have something.

181
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:45,886
so, let's do the usual work up

182
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:48,820
I want you in my office in hour to talk about press

183
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:52,760
and Brooke, I want you to block out the recording studio up to next week.

184
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:54,363
Two songs, seven days.

185
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:57,226
By the way, Ty Parker is coming by ferniture later

186
00:12:57,468 --> 00:13:00,028
So, let's just try to contain our excitment when he come

187
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:01,471
Ty Parker!

188
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,231
Ty Parker! oh my god

189
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:05,636
next!

190
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,478
Elle, did you have the Ty Parker theme birthday party, when you were kid?

191
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,812
Yeah, eleven.

192
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:14,815
Eleven years old?

193
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:17,648
No, I had eleven different type Ty Parker themes parties

194
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,954
- Happy birthday, Elle.
- Happy birthday, Elle.

195
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:21,988
- Make a wish.
- yeah, Make a wish.

196
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:24,385
I love you, Ty Parker.

197
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:30,001
Ty Parker.

198
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:33,204
He started as a best friend, in some sitcom.

199
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,699
One record later he was a house hold made

200
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:40,145
A year later, he had the record of the year

201
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,544
and I and all the america followed

202
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:46,050
He grew up and became more than a cute singer.

203
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:48,846
He was Ty Parker.

204
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:54,356
There are moments in life when everything slows down

205
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,623
When a hunderd thing can happen in a space of a single breath

206
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,282
A moment where your heart reaches out and cross the expence of space and time ...

207
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,355
and finds another heart ...

208
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:26,323
beating in time with yours

209
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:30,387
Hi, I'm Stephanie. I'll take you to Allen's office

210
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:36,325
Oh my gosh, he touched my hand.

211
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:39,305
He.. he actully touched my hand

212
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:43,809
Allen, The thing is that my fans are getting older and more sophisticated ...

213
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:45,311
And they're not teeny popers anymore

214
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,513
- And how are you?
- I feel just dead

215
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:49,775
Getting offer from every label and town

216
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:51,716
do the same record I did last year and year before that

217
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:54,381
wanna know what I want?

218
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:55,848
I want a chance to fail

219
00:14:56,024 --> 00:14:58,618
I wanna label that let.. is gonna let me do something different ...

220
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:01,161
not drop me the minimum I don't sell million copies.

221
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:03,322
I get that and respect that, Ty.

222
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:06,790
and there was a time when I felt that

223
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:09,666
but trust me when I say to you

224
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:14,004
that good intentions and good music don't always make a good marraige

225
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,567
Not without a good business

226
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,838
Now I know you've been successful so far.

227
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:19,813
I'm not worried about success.

228
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,175
Allen, Okey ?

229
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:22,836
I need to do something different.

230
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:27,253
and no more lip syncing, and no more can beats

231
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:30,253
just .. this is my chance to do something real.

232
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:33,561
Will do you relize that some of your fans won't accept that

233
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:35,162
and some of them will leave you

234
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:37,256
- I'll get new ones.
- Yeah, if you don't?

235
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,330
At least I was honest.

236
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:41,530
What do you think?

237
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,267
I think I know why you're here at Spunn.

238
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,307
The question is, Do I come back?

239
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,741
Yeah, poor Ty, you are not what I expected.

240
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:54,576
I've been heard that a lot lately

241
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,082
- Is that a bad thing?
- No. ..

242
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:01,022
actually I don't think so.

243
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:05,859
You remind me of the very first band I were representing

244
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:07,328
yeah? Where are they now?

245
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,393
yeah, they're gone

246
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:13,636
Taken

247
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,297
Good music does not keep any plane in the sky

248
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:17,931
So

249
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,172
you sold a lot of records

250
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,908
you welling to give that up just to make the record you wanna make

251
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,949
I have to

252
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,987
Right, Have a seat

253
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,984
How about this?

254
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,654
We'll start with the baby step

255
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:44,194
I decide in upping coming up young pop singer from  London, Kandi Kane.

256
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,032
I think you'll do well with her, you can magic and money.

257
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,641
Allen, I'm trying to stay a way from the pop.

258
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,641
I know. You want to do something different.

259
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,077
what I'm saying is .. Do it in the booth with her

260
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:58,278
She gives you pop, you push back with soul

261
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,613
Trust me, Ty, do this for me ...

262
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:04,390
and I let you do anything you want, any way you want.

263
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,819
What do you say?

264
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:07,524
Well...

265
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,990
you know, I got to think about it

266
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:11,729
no problem.

267
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,025
- Thanks again, Allen.
- Okay, thanks

268
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:22,007
All right everybody it's enough star musing

269
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:26,447
Now Mr. Parker maybe returning forward to our studio

270
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,810
So let's make sure he have full access

271
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:32,177
Hay Uncle Allen, maybe tonight you can give that song a listen

272
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:34,484
I do not know, Elle. I have a lot of work to do ...

273
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:36,046
and I'll probably be home late again

274
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:37,488
you probably shouldn't even wait up

275
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:39,360
Are you sure? I mean.. I can make dinner

276
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:40,589
Don't buther

277
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:43,561
I know you probably welling away

278
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:44,960
cammon take a walk

279
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:50,636
Such a hommerit moment

280
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:53,067
Getting a wormen fussy inside

281
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,905
Warm and fussy

282
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:57,775
I changed my mind.
I do want more drinks Edna

283
00:17:58,548 --> 00:18:00,015
Non-fat, right?

284
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,314
With new competition on the way, you guys might wanna look your best

285
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:06,422
I am not going to degnifine that with a response

286
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,455
- Me neither
- Yeah

287
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:12,585
Yeah, come on, girls, we have a sensational new video to finish

288
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:21,937
What's the matter?

289
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:24,074
"What are you talking about?"

290
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:25,673
"You haven't eaten a bite

291
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:28,342
It's not that hungry.

292
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:31,811
is it about Sensation? your uncle?

293
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,174
Why is that have to be about either one ?

294
00:18:34,585 --> 00:18:37,110
Is there some other drama I don't know about ?!

295
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:38,987
No.

296
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:42,549
I don't know what's wrong kit

297
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:44,694
Maybe it's your singing

298
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:46,121
Why would you say that

299
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:48,429
Because you were dreaming about it

300
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,263
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, You were

301
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:51,359
Everybody heard you

302
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:55,437
leave it alone for the millione time. I don't sing anymore

303
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:58,835
you're good, I mean, you're really good

304
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:01,543
you know how many girls would killed to have your voice?

305
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:04,011
And your musical ability?

306
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:05,674
Just stop it

307
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:08,581
Why would you keep such an incredible talent a hidden

308
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:10,748
You have a gift, a destiny!

309
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:13,255
Destiny? Yeah right!

310
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:16,557
Destiny changes every day and plans change every day ...

311
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:18,596
and things happening and those things change ...

312
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:20,155
So what's the point?

313
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,995
What about Berklee College of Music?

314
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:24,263
I mean, did you even have an audition for them for the scholarship

315
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:26,498
That was a long time ago

316
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:29,367
Elle, that was six months ago.

317
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:33,072
you used to be one of the biggist singer-songwriter on the planet.

318
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:37,010
If you don't perceive your music, what you're gonna do with your life?

319
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,377
I don't know.

320
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,283
like go to a community college or something

321
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:43,615
and become a dental hygienist?

322
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:46,990
And besides, Uncle Allen is needy've been of the Spunn records

323
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:49,426
Can't afford to send me to a real college anyway

324
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:53,897
All I am saying is that if you don't hold what on makes you ...

325
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:57,597
you.. then you'll go to lose yourself and may not find it

326
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:01,204
Wow, that was deep.

327
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:02,470
I know, right!

328
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:06,172
It's like.. I get my east wisdom on the east

329
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,609
What's that?

330
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:11,417
An entry form

331
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:14,888
Berklee having another round of scholarship auditions coming out

332
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:20,190
First of all okey, Berklee screwed my entire life, and secondly, I thought I just told you ..

333
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,720
Okay fine, I will drop it for now.

334
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,591
Do you want to check out this .. Kandi Kane  video?

335
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:29,529
I heard it got ten million hits online.

336
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:31,130
Sure

337
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:33,542
Let's see.

338
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:41,106
oh my gosh

339
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:46,379
What is that ?What is that ?

340
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:49,357
SPUNN RECORDS

341
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:53,089
If you ever wondered what life is a record company intern is like

342
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:55,495
This is it. One of my jobs today ...

343
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:58,000
is to call every radio station in the area

344
00:20:58,068 --> 00:21:00,002
and request Sensation's record

345
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:02,605
More calls, equals more exposure ...

346
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:05,369
More exposure equals more sales

347
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:07,740
And more sales equals this!

348
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,367
Hay, Ellen, how's it going?

349
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:11,881
Fine

350
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:15,782
We just finished our new hit video. It's the best thing we've ever done

351
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,783
- the absoloute best
- yeah

352
00:21:17,922 --> 00:21:21,824
Great, I can't wait to call the stations and request it

353
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,760
Did you need something?

354
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:25,559
Well, we were just wondering what are you doing tomorrow?

355
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,721
The same as today, I guess

356
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:31,527
How would you like to be part of a real recording?

357
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,699
- Are you serious?
- Aha

358
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:35,296
Come with us to the studio tomorrow.

359
00:21:35,373 --> 00:21:37,069
I mean, you will really really be helping us out

360
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,941
We know how well your norm music in

361
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,115
Sure, I can do that. Thanks

362
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:44,706
- No prob.
- See ya

363
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:45,808
Bye."

364
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:50,488
What was that?

365
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:53,217
I don't know, but I get to be in the studio tomorrow.

366
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:55,887
Be carefull, Elle, I do not trust those three as far as they can throw harm

367
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:57,327
Especially Stephanie.

368
00:21:57,964 --> 00:22:00,057
Well, maybe they are turning over on their <theve??>

369
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,432
No.

370
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:02,900
Hay, you know what this means?

371
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,902
What?"

372
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:08,738
If anybody request coffee tomorrow, you'll have to get it from Andy by yourself

373
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:12,111
oh my gosh, Elle, I gotta plan up what I'm gonna to say.

374
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:14,940
- I gotta go
- You are so beutifull

375
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:23,221
Hey, is this WKLA?

376
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,123
Do you have any Sensation single

377
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:28,486
Sensation.

378
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,298
Late night

379
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:42,241
Yeah

380
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:45,369
- You cooked?
- Yeah

381
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:48,144
- More work?
- Yeah

382
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:04,530
Hay, you know what? I.. I have a few minutes now.

383
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:06,034
if you want me hear something?

384
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:07,160
Never mind

385
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,567
It's nothing.

386
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:55,618
And then, Sensation asked me to help in the studio tomorrow.

387
00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:00,620
Sorry, I'm sorry, I was melli-miles away.

388
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:02,717
- Say it again?
- You need to go to bed.

389
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:07,124
Well, do you know what! so do you. because I can't let my interns fall in sleep in the job

390
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,065
But did you hear what I said about Sensation wanna me help in the studio?

391
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:14,367
Yeah, keep your ears and your eyes open.

392
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:16,539
Magic can happen in that booth.

393
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:19,239
- I love you, you know.
- I know you do

394
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:40,991
Very good, huh?

395
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:54,839
This was it

396
00:24:54,982 --> 00:24:59,146
No matter how tough it've been over the past few months. This made up for it all

397
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,685
I was finally getting the respect that I deserve

398
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:04,383
and I was going into the studio.

399
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,400
oh God, this is great

400
00:25:14,535 --> 00:25:15,729
Oh hi

401
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:18,995
oh my gosh, this is so amazing

402
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,732
It is, isn't?

403
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:24,073
this is where Sensation makes its magic.

404
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,874
So, what can I do to help?

405
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,116
I am so Glad to hear how eager you are

406
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:36,282
In the dressing room there is a small fridge with three different kinds of bottle water

407
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:38,758
After every three takes, no more no less ...

408
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,625
We're gonna need one of each kind

409
00:25:40,697 --> 00:25:43,291
And I probably will be half way between the last take

410
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:45,391
because we want you back as soon as we finish.

411
00:25:45,768 --> 00:25:46,700
What ?

412
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,403
I like the strawberry fraibed waters.

413
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:50,496
Steph likes the lemon and Jemmi likes the bland

414
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:51,597
Yeah

415
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:55,475
So you want me to be your water girl !

416
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:56,534
No.

417
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,337
You will get to hold these, too

418
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:01,545
What are these ?

419
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:05,311
These are sweating towels after each take

420
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:06,821
It's got so hot in here

421
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:10,224
sweat towels

422
00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:13,826
Okay.. Yeah ... Now Let's go!

423
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,834
Yeah nice dress there

424
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,003
Okay, ready?

425
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,469
So second take

426
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:22,799
Ready! bigger.. better

427
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,166
be live ready

428
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:36,018
Hi. I am requesting the new single from Sensation.

429
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:40,053
Awesome, I mean I'll listen to any station plays that song.

430
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,381
thanks

431
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:43,989
Nice day, isn't, Elle?

432
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:45,655
Oh, pess off

433
00:26:47,932 --> 00:26:50,298
I am really sorry, I didn't mean that. Iam sorry

434
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,777
Yes, I'd like to vote.

435
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:02,939
I like to peck the new Sensation single, for song of the day.

436
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,641
- Thanks.
- Our ears are burning.

437
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:09,481
Eleanor, thanks so mush for helping today.

438
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:12,625
what? I am not sure what I did that a laundry basket couldn't do

439
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:15,124
oh Emmy poor. is something wrong?

440
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:19,425
I am sure there is ton of interns that would love to be this close to actual stars

441
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,123
You're very lucky.

442
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:24,035
But she doesn't seem very grateful.

443
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:26,535
Ty is an inspirational, isn't he ?

444
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:28,402
The way he just act and laught

445
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,635
It is hard to imagine what all labels going through right now

446
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:33,773
All that money he took with him.

447
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:35,575
All that money?

448
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:37,879
I wonder what would happen for Spunn records

449
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:39,442
if they lost their

450
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,885
biggist act

451
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:45,117
You know wat they call Sensation? a bubble gum pop group

452
00:27:46,627 --> 00:27:48,788
Because bubble gum comes cheap.

453
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:50,788
When you go out for lunch?

454
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:52,761
-  Actualy I brought the...
- Yeah, I'm sure.

455
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:56,099
Go pick up the holy Wraps from the store around the corner.
Not before two

456
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:58,571
and not after three, OK?

457
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:01,101
Yeah, and one last thing ...

458
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:05,203
we have a wordrobe in a minute, and we have to fix some dresses ...

459
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,271
that .. yeah, they might fit cheioper, we have to get them hending fit for us

460
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:09,442
But we getting them henting fit for us

461
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:11,249
small <gal??> girls.

462
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:16,657
Oh is that much to ask my little laundry basket

463
00:28:17,592 --> 00:28:19,924
- Esther.
- <Todols> Elley

464
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:22,430
Have fun, girls.

465
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:25,694
I hope you choke in sequin

466
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:57,120
So this is what it's like to be a star in today's world

467
00:29:57,764 --> 00:30:00,699
All the dresses, the hair, and the makeup.

468
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:04,302
It's not the way I remember it

469
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:06,698
Mom and dad traveling all over the country

470
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:10,641
 just to sing backup for some singers who's last tip was ten years old.

471
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:12,678
But that didn't matter to them

472
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,678
They loved singing

473
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:23,185
Elle, you look so  beautiful.

474
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:25,118
Thank you, Ms. Pembroke.

475
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,552
Ready?

476
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:30,286
now.. I know how much you want to get into Berklee.

477
00:30:30,465 --> 00:30:33,866
Remember, stage fright is all in the mind

478
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:36,002
You are a star.

479
00:30:36,804 --> 00:30:39,864
Are my parents here yet because I really need them

480
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:44,477
They know that and you know that they will be here just as soon as they can.

481
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:48,474
Your uncle called and said that they cought the last flight out of Philadelphia.

482
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,014
Will he becoming too ?

483
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,644
I don't think so

484
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:54,580
Oh that's a shame

485
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:56,486
Aren't you two very close ?

486
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:59,820
Well, he is a sort of a part-time dad

487
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:02,056
Or uncle, I guess

488
00:31:02,898 --> 00:31:05,423
He takes care of me when my parents are on tour.

489
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:07,869
Well, he sounds really special

490
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:11,533
- Be great girl like tonight.
- I will. Thank you.

491
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:14,975
Mrs. Pembroke, we need you for a second, please.

492
00:31:22,451 --> 00:31:23,645
Good luck

493
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,044
Name, please.

494
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:48,612
Elle Daniels.

495
00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:51,313
What will you be singing for us today?

496
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,680
It's.. It's acutaly a song that I wrote for my parents.

497
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,252
Good.

498
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:13,334
Uncle Allen wasn't supposed to be there

499
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:16,437
I knew something was defently wrong.

500
00:32:20,078 --> 00:32:21,272
The thing is..

501
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,948
when you have a memory you would like to erase

502
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:25,674
the opposite happens.

503
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:30,516
A leak, they said later.

504
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:33,488
my parents plane had a hydraulic leak.

505
00:32:33,658 --> 00:32:36,559
Thats stupid plane shouldn't never been flying

506
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:40,457
and the worst part of our remembering those moments

507
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:44,899
is you can't always remember the difference between what really happened ...

508
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:46,834
and what it felt like

509
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:52,738
Maybe there is such a thing as second chance

510
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:57,647
maybe Kit was right, maybe I could do this

511
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,183
I mean what harm could it do to submit a song

512
00:33:07,261 --> 00:33:09,821
a long with the birthday scholarship entry form !

513
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:25,576
 After all, there I was in a Los Angeles recording studio

514
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,679
I was all alone.

515
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,211
I am sorry!

516
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:44,947
no, that .. that was amazing

517
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:46,046
I mean wow!

518
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:49,857
I mean you play soo well, too. What you.. you are really <artho??> full backage

519
00:36:50,594 --> 00:36:53,085
- I. .. I. ..
- So when did you get in ?

520
00:36:54,264 --> 00:36:57,097
I.. I mean.. WOW, Iam just sorry, Iam just.. Iam going off like this and just really excited

521
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,159
I'm.. I'm Ty Parker.

522
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:05,069
yeah, I hope you don't mind me just sneaking in like this. I was in here recording earliar

523
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:08,002
and I.. I.. here it is.. I forgot my phone

524
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,377
I was almost at the hotel where realized, and that..

525
00:37:10,448 --> 00:37:12,712
Wow, listen to me just gamering on !

526
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:14,642
- Well Iam ...

527
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:15,843
yeah. I know

528
00:37:15,987 --> 00:37:18,820
- Yeah, I gotta be honest.. when.. when Allen told me about you

529
00:37:19,424 --> 00:37:22,018
I had.. had no idea what would you look like or sounded like

530
00:37:22,428 --> 00:37:23,861
But I think you're perfect.

531
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,920
I mean the look.. the sound

532
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,493
am I talking too much?

533
00:37:29,435 --> 00:37:31,665
- Iam ..
- You don't say a lot, do you?

534
00:37:32,638 --> 00:37:34,196
no.. I mean you are tired.. yeah

535
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,034
would you.. would you maybe Wanna.. wanna get out of here?

536
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,737
Go out? with you?

537
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:44,007
Yeah

538
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:48,846
And this it. The moment was when I did the dumbest thing I've ever done

539
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:50,855
I turned British for a guy.

540
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:53,890
well.. That would be lovely

541
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:57,961
- Well.. shall we?
- Indeed

542
00:38:09,877 --> 00:38:12,437
wow..  thanks man.

543
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:16,280
I say this isn't very.. most romantic spot.. well..

544
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:19,815
I know you're new here in America, and this is..

545
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:22,185
This is where I shot my first music video..

546
00:38:22,656 --> 00:38:24,715
So, figured maybe we can shot our first music video here

547
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,352
Well,that would be lovely.

548
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:29,824
You know.. I didn't catch this accent before.

549
00:38:29,897 --> 00:38:32,058
- You're.. You're from England, right?
- Yes, England.

550
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:36,636
I was born there. well, I live there. I was born there and I live there.

551
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:38,072
OK

552
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,575
But it's.. not all the time.

553
00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:46,578
Sometimes I go back there, to London, and other parts of England.

554
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:49,008
you know.. actualy I've never been there

555
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:51,276
You must visit sometime

556
00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:57,990
Tower of London, and Buckingham Palace, and fog ...

557
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,925
well, Maybe you can give me a tour sometime

558
00:39:02,265 --> 00:39:04,062
I would be delighted

559
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:06,559
you know.. I'm surprised you're so cool.

560
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,537
I mean I'm sure you used.. you used to fancy restaurants.

561
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:11,840
You will be surprised

562
00:39:12,074 --> 00:39:14,599
it's.. yeah.. the price of fame like this

563
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:16,507
I mean, if we gone to the "four season place"

564
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,945
we'll be swarming in photographers, in 15 minutes

565
00:39:19,081 --> 00:39:21,948
- Have you..have you to deal with that?
- not yet, no

566
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:24,653
Give it time. I mean, the way you sing!

567
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:29,824
yeah, so.. what you think about hot dog cart? They have best french fries

568
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,454
You should really dig in

569
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,458
Sorry

570
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:39,430
It's cool. your mind in somewhere else?

571
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:40,970
something like that

572
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:45,102
They great.. The fries !

573
00:39:45,275 --> 00:39:46,833
don't you mean.. don't you mean chips ?

574
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:48,411
a pardon ?

575
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:51,080
( Fries ) is an.. doesn't it come (chips) in England ?

576
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:53,778
Yes, some places.

577
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:55,712
But you know what they say ...

578
00:39:55,786 --> 00:39:58,152
two countries separated by a common language.

579
00:39:58,357 --> 00:39:59,483
Smart, too

580
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:01,826
what ?

581
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:05,893
You!.. You are breaty, smart, talented, foreign which is cool.

582
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:07,926
well, what about you?

583
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,232
The dashing Ty Parker

584
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,736
<Denate?> heart through all one the cover of almost every magazine

585
00:40:16,274 --> 00:40:17,673
that.. sounds better than it is

586
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,302
what do you mean?

587
00:40:19,313 --> 00:40:23,139
I can't walk out of my frienf door without been hounded of photographers.

588
00:40:23,182 --> 00:40:24,444
And the tabloids?

589
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:27,252
Don't believe anything they say

590
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,047
It can't be that bad.

591
00:40:29,188 --> 00:40:30,280
Really?

592
00:40:31,624 --> 00:40:34,218
I mean.. Have you ever had someone who's constantly tell you what to do

593
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:36,124
someone who thinks they know everything about music?

594
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:37,523
You'd be surprised.

595
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:40,832
some still unsure about signing with Spunn.. I mean

596
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:43,335
I mean, Allen seems like a nice guy, but..

597
00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:46,202
shouldn't 've he loves music the way we do, you know?

598
00:40:47,307 --> 00:40:49,775
I mean, still, he did say I can trend my own disteny

599
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:51,443
That sounds like him

600
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,538
You two had a chance to talk much?!

601
00:40:54,848 --> 00:40:56,213
Not much, no

602
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,842
I.. I think he is really occupied with you and Kandi recording togather

603
00:41:00,154 --> 00:41:01,485
You mean you and I are recording together.

604
00:41:02,423 --> 00:41:03,583
What did I say?

605
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:04,985
You said: "You and Kandi."

606
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:09,395
Well, That's just how we talk in London.

607
00:41:10,898 --> 00:41:14,265
We just <prountendously?> speak in a third persons

608
00:41:14,568 --> 00:41:16,035
it's very literary.

609
00:41:16,804 --> 00:41:17,793
yeah

610
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:19,404
I guess there is a lot I have to learn about you.

611
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:21,170
You have no idea.

612
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:25,076
hey, maybe you wanna.. do you wanna take a walk?

613
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:29,650
I'm not sure I'm dressed for

614
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:30,649
Come on.

615
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:33,186
honestly I've been unable to relax like since one month.

616
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:34,480
"Please...

617
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:35,749
Ok

618
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,139
So, where did you learn how to sing like that?

619
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:02,750
I took few classes when I was young girl

620
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,916
And.. my parents were both singers.

621
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:09,523
Are they back home in England?

622
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:14,756
No.. yeah! just back at home, waiting for me to get back

623
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,930
You're nothing like what I expected.

624
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:19,760
...No?

625
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,265
I mean, there is a rumer that you were look wild

626
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,432
No, not me

627
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,138
I'm an angel

628
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,942

629
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,544
and another heard you were a shallow pop star

630
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,177
Touche, touche.

631
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:38,847
- Is that what you think now?
- No.

632
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:40,950
So what do you think?

633
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:43,579
I think you are one of the sweetist guys I've met

634
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:47,583
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever met

635
00:42:48,725 --> 00:42:50,283
This gonna be the best dual ever

636
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:53,555
Is that.. Is that mine?

637
00:42:53,964 --> 00:42:55,431
No, that's mine

638
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:03,568
- Sorry but I have to go
- No, but ...

639
00:43:06,511 --> 00:43:08,035
Wait, I don't even have your number

640
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:10,774

Well, I kissed him on the cheek anyway, but it was still a kiss.

657
00:44:01,935 --> 00:44:07,737
And now I just have to figure out how in the world I was gonna tell'em that I wasn't the famous Kandi Kane.

00:46:17,443 --> 00:46:19,411
For the thousandth time, yes.

704
00:46:19,478 --> 00:46:20,968
oh my gosh, this is incredible

705
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:23,607
hay wait, he thinks you are Kandi Kane.

706
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:28,752
Okay, not only he did not knew your name, but he also thinks you are from another country.

707
00:46:28,821 --> 00:46:30,413
this is sort of doing fare, I know.

708
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:31,920
This is the best

709
00:46:31,991 --> 00:46:33,788
I can't believe you're enjoying my suffering.

710
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:37,386
You had a romantic evening with your prince charming.

711
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,963
Where is this suffering coming?

712
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:43,434
the whole! I lied about who I am and once he finds out, he's never gonna want to speak to me again

713
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:44,934
Just you need to tell him the truth

714
00:46:45,004 --> 00:46:48,604
once he sees it's you, he's not gonna care if you're American, British or Martian.

715
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:49,801
well, you seem pretty convinced.

716
00:46:49,876 --> 00:46:53,937
Well, I've seen a million teen comedies in this subject.

717
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:56,039
and I am an expert.

718
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:03,619
I really appreciate your shutting down the restaurant foe me, dude

719
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:06,251
Defently, Ty, anything you need anything, defently give me call

720
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:07,692
We'll do it, man. Thanks again

721
00:47:21,243 --> 00:47:22,301
Hi, Ty.

722
00:47:22,444 --> 00:47:25,504
Oh, I'm.. I'm so sorry to be rude, I.. I'm actualy waiting for someone

723
00:47:25,614 --> 00:47:28,981
- Me.
- No, I'm sorry, I.. I  have a meeting to get

724
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:31,012
You have a meeting with me.

725
00:47:31,286 --> 00:47:32,378
I'm Kandi.

726
00:47:34,356 --> 00:47:36,449
Ofcour.. ofcourse you are.. yeah

727
00:47:37,926 --> 00:47:39,416
Please have a seat

728
00:47:41,063 --> 00:47:42,690
where this thing is going !

729
00:47:51,808 --> 00:47:54,606
And that's where I told my agent, we absoulotly most come to America

730
00:47:54,677 --> 00:47:58,306
I mean he is an entire country. It's barely even heard of me.

731
00:47:58,381 --> 00:47:59,905
how is that fair to them.

732
00:48:00,283 --> 00:48:03,480
I know. So we jumped upon as they say here

733
00:48:03,553 --> 00:48:06,716
and here I am sitting here person Ty Parker ...

734
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,888
the hottist star in the colonies

735
00:48:08,992 --> 00:48:09,959
Colonies!

736
00:48:10,027 --> 00:48:12,120
as in the 13 original colonies.

737
00:48:12,296 --> 00:48:15,788
oh Ty, please tell me you're a smart as you are talented, dear boy.

738
00:48:15,966 --> 00:48:18,764
because when I agreed to do this duet, I knew there was only one person ...

739
00:48:18,835 --> 00:48:22,464
and one person alone that could share the stage with Kandi Kane ...

740
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:26,305
and that be blowing compeletly out of the water, and that person is you, Ty.

741
00:48:27,045 --> 00:48:28,239
Aren't you gonna eat?

742
00:48:28,613 --> 00:48:29,637
what?

743
00:48:29,814 --> 00:48:30,906
We haven't ordered

744
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:33,277
and you're gonna need to eat. You need your strength, Ty ...

745
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:36,079
because Kandi Kane is not just a singer ...

746
00:48:36,154 --> 00:48:39,089
Kandi Kane is a force of the nature.

747
00:48:40,092 --> 00:48:41,024
and who knows ...

748
00:48:41,093 --> 00:48:43,618
maybe the studio isn't the only place you and I can play duet.

749
00:48:43,696 --> 00:48:46,392
Kandi, I had.. I'm so sorry, I have to go

750
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:50,557
wow, Listen, I.. I would love to continue this,  but I just.. I really have to run. I'm Sorry.

751
00:48:52,171 --> 00:48:54,901
wow.. whatever you want is delecious, put it in my tab

752
00:48:55,207 --> 00:48:59,473
I'm.. I'm just so sorry. I have to go. I'll see you in the rehearse studio. it.. it was great

753
00:48:59,678 --> 00:49:01,646
Ty! Your phone.

754
00:49:02,748 --> 00:49:03,942
Thank you so much.. thank you

755
00:49:04,016 --> 00:49:05,074
Have a good one

756
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:13,485
How did you sleep honey ?

757
00:49:13,793 --> 00:49:14,885
I didn't

758
00:49:15,095 --> 00:49:16,289
Poor thing.

759
00:49:16,363 --> 00:49:20,322
You know, you really need to get out of this fun qure and.. and just tell the guy

760
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,958
I would if it's just the guy but it's not. It's Ty Parker

761
00:49:24,137 --> 00:49:27,231
The guy that I have convinced that I'm a real singer.

762
00:49:27,307 --> 00:49:28,797
You are a real singer.

763
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:30,873
I sing, I'm not real singer.

764
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:35,938
I mean, I don't have my own record label, my own antrager, interns to boss around

765
00:49:36,082 --> 00:49:37,640
and all I have is Sensation ...

766
00:49:37,717 --> 00:49:41,551
three girls that would like nothing better then to know that I screwed up the record

767
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:42,911
and lied to Ty.

768
00:49:42,923 --> 00:49:45,892
I like the way you call him Ty, it's like you know him.

769
00:49:46,927 --> 00:49:48,724
you are so not helping.

770
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:50,257
Hi everybody!

771
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:55,662
Hay everybody, can I have your attention

772
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:58,630
As I'm sure, you heard there was a mistake in the studio ...

773
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:01,407
there was some girl and there recording a song ...

774
00:50:02,944 --> 00:50:04,571
she was not who I thought she was.

775
00:50:04,879 --> 00:50:06,403
you see! he likes you.

776
00:50:09,317 --> 00:50:13,413
I.. I mean, how did you know it was a girl?

777
00:50:15,056 --> 00:50:16,023
what?

778
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:19,386
Nothing!

779
00:50:20,596 --> 00:50:22,086
Well, she's.. she disappeared.

780
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:25,757
Anyways.. if any of you knew who she is ...

781
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:27,131
It's very important that I get in touch with her

782
00:50:27,636 --> 00:50:28,568
Say something.

783
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:34,835
Hay! Ty.. that's a great idea ...

784
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,142
you know because helping is what people do and we all should be helpful..

785
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:40,547
So, let's do this

786
00:50:42,552 --> 00:50:43,883
I'll be quiet

787
00:50:45,655 --> 00:50:46,781
OK

788
00:50:49,192 --> 00:50:50,955
Thank you guys for your time. Appreciate it

789
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:58,162
- OK, Drew, what do you think?
- It's not what I want.

790
00:50:58,235 --> 00:51:00,203
- what.. what do you mean it's not what you want?
- This is not what I want at all

791
00:51:00,271 --> 00:51:02,933
- It's not my vision.
- OK, I'll tell you what

792
00:51:03,007 --> 00:51:04,702
- I'll tell my secretary give call
- No!

793
00:51:04,775 --> 00:51:05,867
- I'll make my secretary call ...
- No you have to talk about..

794
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:08,173
- Allen, I gotta talk to you.
- Goodbye.

795
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:09,344
Thank you."

796
00:51:09,647 --> 00:51:10,807
- What ?
- look, unless I find this girl ...

797
00:51:10,882 --> 00:51:11,974
I'm leaving Spunn Records.. Ok?

798
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,813
 I'm not kidding.. I'll leave right now

799
00:51:13,985 --> 00:51:15,680
Take it easy, Ty.

800
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,380
- I mean we do have a contract....
- I'll break it

801
00:51:18,456 --> 00:51:19,548
For girl?

802
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:20,691
it's not just a girl.

803
00:51:20,758 --> 00:51:22,658
You said that  I can make the record I want

804
00:51:22,727 --> 00:51:24,388
I want that girl on my record

805
00:51:24,462 --> 00:51:25,394
Make it happen, Allen.

806
00:51:25,463 --> 00:51:27,829
But she is not the girl. That's the problem, Ty.

807
00:51:27,899 --> 00:51:31,335
Look, let's just do our agreement the way we agreed to

808
00:51:31,402 --> 00:51:33,994
with the real Kandi Kane and then we'll find your girl for you.

809
00:51:34,072 --> 00:51:36,700
You asked me to magic and now you're taking it a way of my hat.

810
00:51:37,276 --> 00:51:40,609
Can you just forget about Kandi Kane for two seconds. Help me out!

811
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:43,113
No! I can't forget about her and neither can you

812
00:51:43,282 --> 00:51:44,374
Ty ...

813
00:51:45,217 --> 00:51:48,277
If we walk out on Kandi now, she will sue us both

814
00:51:48,887 --> 00:51:50,184
You know what that means ?

815
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:54,253
No chance to do your music with the girl, or alone.

816
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:56,485
That would be total knock down

817
00:51:57,262 --> 00:51:58,456
Now is that what you want?

818
00:51:59,132 --> 00:52:02,829
It's never been about about what I want, until right now

819
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,028
Look! I'm finding this girl

820
00:52:06,105 --> 00:52:08,733
Hay Allen.. I won't let some stuiped law suit get in way.

821
00:52:19,453 --> 00:52:23,947
You never look this good. This is it

822
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:28,057
I mean, look at these outfits, no one is going to have these. I'm telling you.

823
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,457
I mean, I look so hot today. I don't know what it is that facial yesterday, which is insane

824
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:35,525
- You are always look good.
- I know. It's ridiculous.

825
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,004
- I look fat.
- Go to the gym.

826
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,437
Skip a meal. It works.

827
00:52:39,507 --> 00:52:41,634
- Do you like this scarf?
- yeah

828
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:44,107
Don't ask me again, I've picked it up for you.

829
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,444
Girls, I mean seriously, we're gonna like be the fashion iconed of the 2000's

830
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:51,882
Ok. I think we're ready for shades.

831
00:52:53,555 --> 00:52:54,749
Pose.

832
00:52:54,924 --> 00:52:56,050
Pose.

833
00:52:56,525 --> 00:52:57,958
hit it! Pose!

834
00:52:58,494 --> 00:53:00,086
Take it down.. fussy

835
00:53:01,163 --> 00:53:02,790
Smooth.

836
00:53:04,466 --> 00:53:05,728
That's right.

837
00:53:06,835 --> 00:53:08,097
Sensation.

838
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:11,904
Ok. I'm parched

839
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:15,300
What?"

840
00:53:16,346 --> 00:53:17,574
No water!!

841
00:53:18,114 --> 00:53:19,775
Where is Emma-Jean?

842
00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:21,476
I haven't seen her since lunch.

843
00:53:21,551 --> 00:53:23,678
That is unacceptable.

844
00:53:25,722 --> 00:53:26,848
I'll be back.

845
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:30,320
- Practice!
- OK!

846
00:53:30,527 --> 00:53:31,516
1

847
00:53:31,661 --> 00:53:32,593
2

848
00:53:39,003 --> 00:53:40,527
What do we have here?

849
00:54:14,272 --> 00:54:17,241
That's the song were recorded over our record!

850
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,172
No, she..

851
00:54:23,048 --> 00:54:24,572
No, she didn't!

852
00:54:32,025 --> 00:54:33,049
Girls ...

853
00:54:33,326 --> 00:54:34,452
- What?
- What?

854
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:36,485
We have a problem.

855
00:54:38,664 --> 00:54:41,132
Sensation, out!

856
00:54:47,275 --> 00:54:52,941
What's up? Here's your boy Danny C reporting live from your number one radio station, ZKLA!

857
00:54:53,014 --> 00:54:56,609
We have in the studio my boy Ty Parker, waska! waska! waska!

858
00:54:56,684 --> 00:54:57,742
How is it going, man? it's been a while

859
00:54:57,818 --> 00:55:00,150
Actualy I got a message I gotta get out, and you maybe gotta help me, man

860
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:04,453
oh man, anything I can do would help Ty Parker, brightest artist in the building

861
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:06,320
I met a girl.

862
00:55:06,494 --> 00:55:08,519
I mean, this girl is a diamond in the rough, man

863
00:55:08,696 --> 00:55:10,163
and.. and never heard a voice like hers.

864
00:55:10,231 --> 00:55:13,166
More importantly, I mean, I spent the best night of my life with this girl.

865
00:55:13,234 --> 00:55:16,692
I'm telling you, Danny C, this girl is.. the girl is beautiful, she's funny

866
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:17,833
She got the voice of an angel, man.

867
00:55:17,905 --> 00:55:18,929
wow!

868
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,542
Could Ty Parker be fall in L,O,V,E (love)?

869
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,704
Oh unfortunately I don't know much about her. I don't really even know her name

870
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,142
But I know she's out there ...

871
00:55:26,214 --> 00:55:27,579
and I know she's probably listening on that

872
00:55:27,649 --> 00:55:29,617
wanna see if we can get her to here by herself ? you know

873
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,343

874
00:55:31,419 --> 00:55:33,114
I gotta one of her songs.

875
00:55:33,188 --> 00:55:34,485
I wanna play the beginning of it

876
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:36,990
and if this girl can come in and sing the next line

877
00:55:37,058 --> 00:55:39,492
Take this mystery girl up for the time of her life

878
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:39,994
and she'll record with me in the next album

879
00:55:40,062 --> 00:55:41,962

882
00:55:50,573 --> 00:55:51,562
Next caller.

883
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,099

00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:56,577

887
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:07,087
Sorry, TY, it looks I would come up a sure

888
00:56:07,158 --> 00:56:10,521
- That's all good. It was worth a shot
- There is one upside

889
00:56:10,593 --> 00:56:12,186
- Now, what's that?
- Sounds like..

890
00:56:12,562 --> 00:56:15,363
once you find this mystery girl ...

891
00:56:15,366 --> 00:56:17,425
you really have something special in your hands man

892
00:56:18,002 --> 00:56:19,936
Yeah, thanks again, man

893
00:56:20,004 --> 00:56:21,096
Follow you dude! and you tell me what I can help

894
00:56:21,272 --> 00:56:23,866
- I'm getting out of here. Do you wanna.. you have some need ?
- Yeah, I'm starving

895
00:56:23,942 --> 00:56:24,874
- Chinese?
- yeah

896
00:56:24,943 --> 00:56:25,875
- I'm done
- Ok, lets do it

897
00:56:25,944 --> 00:56:28,310
- You got the BMW key?
- I got the Range

898
00:56:28,379 --> 00:56:30,847
A new Range? I'm still in the Honda.

899
00:56:31,082 --> 00:56:32,106
Let's rock though

900
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,289
Sorry it's not about two gigs that and now talk to my agent

901
00:56:47,365 --> 00:56:50,766
If you expect me to play it in your club, then, you're gonna have to pay me.

902
00:56:50,935 --> 00:56:52,732
And that why I came to America

903
00:56:53,271 --> 00:56:54,329
Oh hello.

904
00:56:54,505 --> 00:56:57,906
You must be the girls from Sensation.

905
00:56:58,076 --> 00:57:00,067
You're so.. cute

906
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,671
Kandi, we're such big fans of yours.

907
00:57:04,149 --> 00:57:06,481
I was wondering if we can talk to you for a minute?

908
00:57:06,752 --> 00:57:07,741
Ofcourse.

909
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,909
Give us a minute, will you loves?

910
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:09,978
What's on your mind?

911
00:57:10,156 --> 00:57:12,750
We heard that you and Ty had a meeting that ended ...

912
00:57:12,826 --> 00:57:13,918
abruptly

913
00:57:13,994 --> 00:57:15,018
He ditched you

914
00:57:15,095 --> 00:57:16,289
I would not say ...

915
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:17,587
ditched

916
00:57:17,998 --> 00:57:19,693
do the English have another word for it?

917
00:57:20,901 --> 00:57:22,698
What can I do for you girls?

918
00:57:22,703 --> 00:57:25,297
We're all in the same boat here, correct?

919
00:57:25,339 --> 00:57:27,933
Ty is obsessed with a certain girl.

920
00:57:28,542 --> 00:57:31,136
Yes, the mystery girl, my devil

921
00:57:31,345 --> 00:57:32,437
We know the girl

922
00:57:32,746 --> 00:57:35,408
- Do you?
- It's our stupid intern.

923
00:57:35,582 --> 00:57:36,913
She can't do her job

924
00:57:36,984 --> 00:57:39,714
She can't even fill our fridge with the right girma water

925
00:57:39,787 --> 00:57:41,851
and she sabotaged our record

926
00:57:41,856 --> 00:57:44,689
- She even tried to sabotage you and Ty.
- yeah

927
00:57:45,693 --> 00:57:47,627
- Oh no!
- yeah just can't take it anymore.

928
00:57:47,795 --> 00:57:49,194
She's so frustrated.

929
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:53,198
Oh no, no, love you must not let these people get to you.

930
00:57:53,334 --> 00:57:56,531
I know how hard is to find good help these days

931
00:57:57,438 --> 00:57:58,598
You're right.

932
00:58:00,908 --> 00:58:02,068
Sensation.

933
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:05,571
Hay you actually really nice

934
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,549
To be honest, I thought we'd be to fake friends

935
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,745
because we are on the same label null, but maybe

936
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,153
we can be real friends.

937
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:18,519
You know something.. I was thinking the exact same thing.

938
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,395
But I have to warn you.

939
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:24,055
When it comes to our little intern

940
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:26,669
we may have to be a little ...

941
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:28,498
Underhanded

942
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,271
You girls don't know me yet

943
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,739
But trust me, when I say (underhanded)

944
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,139
is what I do best.

945
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:38,306
It's hot.

946
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,013
Now, what did you order?

947
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,212
- Hi, Kit
- Hi

948
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,310
Have you seen Elle?

949
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:46,012
No. You look nice today.

950
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,989
Look, coffee-monkey, this isn't about me.

951
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:50,026
Did you listen to Danny C show last night?

952
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,926
- Yeah, Ty Parker on and ...
- Yeah, I know that

953
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:56,363
I wouldn't have asked if you heard the show if I haven't heard the show, would I?

954
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:58,094
Thats dosen't make any sense.

955
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,336
- mmm OK I just ...
- Can it ?

956
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,559
Come here.

957
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:07,300
- What's going here?
- Listen ...

958
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:09,505
I need to confounding you. Do you be trusted?

959
00:59:10,181 --> 00:59:11,341
Ofcourse.

960
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,679
Hay.. what do you do in this weekend?

961
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:18,722
Listen, prom boy, we can talk about us, later

962
00:59:19,157 --> 00:59:21,250
So there is an "us"!

963
00:59:23,095 --> 00:59:25,256
Do you want there to be an "us"?

964
00:59:26,498 --> 00:59:28,523
Yeah I think that would be..

965
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:31,464
- Great.
- Me too.

966
00:59:32,204 --> 00:59:34,069
Yes! cool

967
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:36,469
Yeah, back to business

968
00:59:36,543 --> 00:59:38,067
Danny C show last night

969
00:59:38,144 --> 00:59:40,169
- The song ...
- Oh yeah

970
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:41,907
- " Love is with me now" right?
- That's it

971
00:59:41,981 --> 00:59:43,039
I liked it. It was good

972
00:59:43,116 --> 00:59:44,640
Ofcourse you did. It was Elle.

973
00:59:45,985 --> 00:59:47,179
Get out of here

974
00:59:47,687 --> 00:59:49,279
It's true.

975
00:59:49,622 --> 00:59:51,249
Oh well then.. Why didn't she call in?

976
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,020
Well, it's a long story.

977
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:55,450
Just I need to figure out a way to help my friend ...

978
00:59:55,528 --> 00:59:57,325
But I just don't know how I'm gonna help her

979
00:59:58,866 --> 01:00:00,060
Well, why you tell me?

980
01:00:00,634 --> 01:00:01,601
Two reasons.

981
01:00:01,669 --> 01:00:04,570
One I've been dying to tell someone else this secret

982
01:00:04,638 --> 01:00:05,935
and two ...

983
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:07,869
I've been trying to

984
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:10,675
Figure out a way to start a conversation with you

985
01:00:10,744 --> 01:00:13,042
and I just didn't think this would be half bad.

986
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:19,811
Sweet

987
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:23,116
So.. what we're gonna do?

988
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:24,824
I'll tell you.

989
01:00:30,432 --> 01:00:31,626
I missed you today

990
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:33,694
I think I need to move on, Kit

991
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:35,495
Where? greener pastors?

992
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:36,932
Something like that.

993
01:00:37,238 --> 01:00:39,570
Did you hear Danny C playing your song last day?

994
01:00:39,641 --> 01:00:40,801
Yeah, everyone did

995
01:00:40,942 --> 01:00:43,433
Yeah, especially at Spunn, and do you wanna know a secret?

996
01:00:43,511 --> 01:00:45,274
- What?
- They loved it!

997
01:00:46,781 --> 01:00:48,248
I'm so humiliated

998
01:00:48,316 --> 01:00:51,911
I mean even if I try to do go back to Spunn records, what am I gonna say?

999
01:00:52,454 --> 01:00:55,548
Sooner or later, Ty is gonna see me and right know who I am.

1000
01:00:56,659 --> 01:00:59,492
- Maybe get plastic surgery ...
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

1001
01:00:59,562 --> 01:01:02,360
You can get big fish lips, like this ...

1002
01:01:02,431 --> 01:01:04,991
and have your eyebrows pulled to your hair.. right?

1003
01:01:05,234 --> 01:01:07,168
Okay, maybe that was a dumb idea.

1004
01:01:07,536 --> 01:01:10,164
By the way, I wanted to thank you

1005
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:11,263
for what?

1006
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:15,600
- Thanks, Andy.
- Anytime.

1007
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:16,795
Good song, Elle.

1008
01:01:17,547 --> 01:01:19,037
Thanks, Andy.

1009
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:21,884
- You told him?
- I'm afraid so.

1010
01:01:21,952 --> 01:01:25,513
Can't he know?! he actually knows Ty, they went to high school together or something

1011
01:01:25,623 --> 01:01:27,215
- No
- It's perfect.

1012
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:29,521
They're meeting later. Andy can mention you

1013
01:01:29,593 --> 01:01:30,890
It's the perfect plan.

1014
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:33,996
I mean it's now the time you start getting credit for your music, Elle ...

1015
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:35,190
it's beautiful.

1016
01:01:35,266 --> 01:01:36,290
Whatever.

1017
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:37,629
I have an idea.

1018
01:01:38,002 --> 01:01:42,530
There is a party tomorrow, some celebration for Kandi Kane's arrival to America or something

1019
01:01:42,606 --> 01:01:44,039
Yeah, it's at our house.

1020
01:01:44,608 --> 01:01:45,540
What?"

1021
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:48,234
The real Kandi Kane shows up and we crash her party?

1022
01:01:48,446 --> 01:01:51,313
Yes! Ty can't care less about that English tar

1023
01:01:51,382 --> 01:01:52,974
He wants to meet you ...

1024
01:01:53,184 --> 01:01:55,118
he wants the girl that he met ...

1025
01:01:55,186 --> 01:01:56,983
the girl that he heard singing ...

1026
01:01:57,054 --> 01:01:59,750
the girl that he fall in love for

1027
01:02:02,794 --> 01:02:04,352
You know you might be right?

1028
01:02:04,529 --> 01:02:07,930
- I am?
- Yeah, I mean, look at Andy overthere

1029
01:02:11,169 --> 01:02:14,536
He lights up a candle everytime he sees you.

1030
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:17,802
It could be me and Ty.

1031
01:02:17,976 --> 01:02:22,310
Yes, that's why my dear, I have the perfect plan.

1032
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:41,790
Ready?

1033
01:02:42,002 --> 01:02:44,732
No, I'm so nervous. This is such a bad idea.

1034
01:02:44,805 --> 01:02:46,432
- This is gonna be so much fun.
- No.

1035
01:02:46,507 --> 01:02:51,843
It's like Rom.. Juliet finds out Romio some Montague but they can't be kept of partner no matter what their last themes are.. what?!

1036
01:02:54,848 --> 01:02:56,281
I do read you now !

1037
01:02:56,651 --> 01:03:00,178
- Ok, well,  This is a really stupid idea
- This is a great idea.

1038
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:03,382
and Elle, it was your idea and you look so pretty

1039
01:03:03,557 --> 01:03:07,550
I mean, Ty Parker is going to find out who the real Elle Daniels is

1040
01:03:07,795 --> 01:03:09,262
- Ready?
- No.

1041
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:12,060
Yes, you are. Do your best, good girl. go go go.

1042
01:03:41,163 --> 01:03:42,095
Oh diary!

1043
01:03:50,574 --> 01:03:51,836
What is this?

1044
01:03:54,611 --> 01:03:56,476
Oh god! no taste.. what's so..

1045
01:03:59,182 --> 01:04:00,649
Got to be something.

1046
01:04:01,418 --> 01:04:02,942
what is she saint?

1047
01:05:59,743 --> 01:06:02,371
Oh My God, it's pathetic

1048
01:06:18,028 --> 01:06:20,895
Hello, Elly, I love what you've done with your room.

1049
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:22,959
now I have a question.

1050
01:06:23,033 --> 01:06:26,264
did you really think that you could pretend to be me and get a way with it ?

1051
01:06:26,403 --> 01:06:27,802
Because you can't

1052
01:06:27,871 --> 01:06:32,274
so, why don't you just carry on back to Nashville because there is nothing for you here

1053
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:37,402
It's so sad!

1054
01:06:38,882 --> 01:06:40,611
It is Elle, I can't believe it's her

1055
01:06:40,684 --> 01:06:42,584
I know, look at this ...

1056
01:06:42,986 --> 01:06:45,614
Can you believe what people would do to be famous

1057
01:06:45,689 --> 01:06:48,556
I mean, She even tried to pretend to be me

1058
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:51,856
How.. how could you do this to her?

1059
01:06:52,996 --> 01:06:55,191
Ty, she's nothing.

1060
01:06:57,701 --> 01:06:59,168
Ty, Ty ...

1061
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:01,269
It was funny.

1062
01:07:01,505 --> 01:07:02,938
It was funny. It was fun

1063
01:07:19,024 --> 01:07:21,857
now Andy said that if I came to the party tonight ...

1064
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,757
will be with this girl here that I just

1065
01:07:23,895 --> 01:07:26,625
I'll never forgive myself if I didn't get a chance to meet her.

1066
01:07:27,198 --> 01:07:28,290
And?

1067
01:07:29,868 --> 01:07:32,701
He was right. Why did you do it?

1068
01:07:33,638 --> 01:07:35,003
pretended to be Kandi? I mean..

1069
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,806
I didn't mean do it. I honestly ...

1070
01:07:37,876 --> 01:07:39,400
did't believe that I was Kandi ...

1071
01:07:39,477 --> 01:07:42,173
and that was just so much better than the truth.

1072
01:07:42,248 --> 01:07:44,716
For the first time since my parents died ...

1073
01:07:44,783 --> 01:07:47,684
I decided to stand up and sing, and look what happened.

1074
01:07:50,089 --> 01:07:51,556
Maybe they are right.

1075
01:07:51,724 --> 01:07:53,419
Kandi, Sensation ...

1076
01:07:54,261 --> 01:07:55,421
my parents ...

1077
01:07:55,562 --> 01:07:59,692
lying to you all because of some stupid idea that I thought I could be a real singer.

1078
01:07:59,766 --> 01:08:01,165
I don't.. I don't understand.

1079
01:08:01,234 --> 01:08:02,895
They were in their way to see me ...

1080
01:08:02,969 --> 01:08:05,597
trying to get back in time for my Berklee audition.

1081
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,501
It's because of me, Ty.

1082
01:08:10,243 --> 01:08:12,837
If it wasn't for my singing, my parents would still be alive.

1083
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,282
It is not your fault.

1084
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,422
Do you think for one second, you..

1085
01:08:28,496 --> 01:08:31,192
Your parents would want you to keep your voice from the world?

1086
01:08:31,332 --> 01:08:35,462
Do you think they'd be happy knowing you had this incredible gift ...

1087
01:08:36,337 --> 01:08:38,464
and you're too afraid to share it with anyone, just because you thought

1088
01:08:38,539 --> 01:08:40,769
you could hurt someone with your talent?

1089
01:08:42,443 --> 01:08:43,876
Ofcourse not.

1090
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,573
And that's why they were in their way to support you, Elle.

1091
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:50,947
Because they knew you had something special ...

1092
01:08:51,852 --> 01:08:54,116
and they didn't want you to throw that away.

1093
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:55,956
So do you wanna go to Berklee or not?

1094
01:08:57,026 --> 01:08:58,152
I do

1095
01:09:03,499 --> 01:09:05,126
it's up to you to make it happen.

1096
01:09:09,472 --> 01:09:10,530
Let's go

1097
01:09:20,717 --> 01:09:23,982
Let's see how far he'll get with the nobody.

1098
01:09:25,723 --> 01:09:27,782
I'm so sorry, Uncle Allen.

1099
01:09:27,858 --> 01:09:32,591
I mean, I'm sure you heard of that, recording and makes another record

1100
01:09:32,896 --> 01:09:35,626
Yeah, and you ran off with my biggest client

1101
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:37,827
that too.

1102
01:09:41,374 --> 01:09:42,671
fire me or..

1103
01:09:43,276 --> 01:09:44,971
Or yell at me.

1104
01:09:48,581 --> 01:09:51,744
send me to boarding school, but  don't look at me like that

1105
01:09:51,884 --> 01:09:53,647
Come here, sit down

1106
01:09:54,787 --> 01:09:55,811
Sit down

1107
01:09:56,555 --> 01:09:58,785
do you know how much I admired your parents?

1108
01:09:59,258 --> 01:10:00,350
No.

1109
01:10:00,526 --> 01:10:03,825
I was right beside your dad when you were born.

1110
01:10:04,797 --> 01:10:06,424
It could've knocked down over with it further

1111
01:10:08,401 --> 01:10:11,336
After what you said to me: "Now I have everything, Allen ...

1112
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:16,441
My wife, my kids, my best friend, my music. "

1113
01:10:19,879 --> 01:10:21,210
Yeah, he loved what he did ...

1114
01:10:22,048 --> 01:10:24,881
and made everybody around them love what they do.

1115
01:10:26,352 --> 01:10:28,081
I forgot that for a while.

1116
01:10:28,587 --> 01:10:29,554
It's ok

1117
01:10:29,622 --> 01:10:32,989
No, it's not okay, because I forgot something else, too

1118
01:10:34,694 --> 01:10:38,255
I always wanted to make music, and then money.

1119
01:10:38,898 --> 01:10:40,456
not the other way round

1120
01:10:42,535 --> 01:10:45,800
Elle, you reminded me of that.

1121
01:10:47,107 --> 01:10:48,472
That song of yours

1122
01:10:49,109 --> 01:10:50,269
Yeah

1123
01:10:50,845 --> 01:10:52,335
It's beautiful.

1124
01:10:53,414 --> 01:10:55,211
It's perfect. It's you.

1125
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,940
Thanks, Uncle Allen.

1126
01:10:58,953 --> 01:11:00,784
I want you to make me a promise

1127
01:11:01,055 --> 01:11:02,317
Anything

1128
01:11:03,157 --> 01:11:06,558
No matter what anyone says..

1129
01:11:07,862 --> 01:11:09,591
you never stop singing, ok?

1130
01:11:11,065 --> 01:11:12,225
I won't

1131
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,865
- I love you
- I love you too

1132
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,263
So..

1133
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,067
is Ty still a round?

1134
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:24,043
- Yup
- Well, get him round here

1135
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,707
You got a rehearse, if you gonna in at stand audition for Berklee.

1136
01:12:52,939 --> 01:12:55,703
- It's unacceptable.
- you got to be kidding me, forget it

1137
01:12:55,775 --> 01:12:59,711
- Not acceptable, no, no, no, no!
- Take it easy everybody!

1138
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,910
No, no, no, Mr. Parker is a known business in the change is mind.

1139
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:04,780
duet must go on with Kandi Kane.

1140
01:13:04,851 --> 01:13:06,512
The motion we followed against the move Spunn Recordings ...

1141
01:13:06,586 --> 01:13:07,917
It's explesive in this regard

1142
01:13:07,988 --> 01:13:11,321
Okay, listen, can I just please have a private moment with Miss. Kane. is that ok?

1143
01:13:11,524 --> 01:13:12,889
No, no you don't beat those changes

1144
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:16,292
Actually, well, you know what? actually I don't think that would be such a bad idea.

1145
01:13:16,363 --> 01:13:18,331
Come on, Ty darling, let's talk.

1146
01:13:19,633 --> 01:13:23,501
now, Ty darling, I know this was all just a big misunderstanding.

1147
01:13:23,571 --> 01:13:25,505
That's not what it looked like at the party.

1148
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:26,765
what do you mean?

1149
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:29,000
I mean, any chance we had to perform it togather

1150
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:30,907
was ruined, when you hurt Elle.

1151
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:34,447
T.. Ty, you can't be serious ...

1152
01:13:34,515 --> 01:13:36,142
She's.. she's an intern.

1153
01:13:36,584 --> 01:13:38,142
She's a singer.

1154
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:39,652
She's.. she loves music like you and me.

1155
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,746
No, no, no..  Don't put me in the same category with her

1156
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:46,816
You and I do this for the same reason, and that is the money and the fame.

1157
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:50,259
- Yeah?
- that's.. that's really why you're here?

1158
01:13:50,531 --> 01:13:52,556
Let me make you acount offer

1159
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,430
The duet goes on as it's placed, you know

1160
01:13:55,503 --> 01:14:00,270
I.. you and I get linked to the tabloids, just in time for the release, or ...

1161
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:01,873
We sue

1162
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:06,936
And you and her, this whole little record company, will bob like a flan

1163
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,308
I'm sure Uncle Allen is, I mean, he's gonna find gang of employment

1164
01:14:09,383 --> 01:14:12,910
at any fine fast food establishment

1165
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:14,484
Or not.

1166
01:14:15,391 --> 01:14:16,483
fine

1167
01:14:16,826 --> 01:14:20,057
- And you must let go of little orphan Elly.
- No, I won't

1168
01:14:20,129 --> 01:14:22,359
just until the record's released.

1169
01:14:22,432 --> 01:14:26,232
and then you can chase the mousy girl throw the <gudice?> you like

1170
01:14:27,804 --> 01:14:30,204
You're really an awefull person, you know that?

1171
01:14:30,273 --> 01:14:33,208
Ty, darling, you might grow to like me.

1172
01:14:34,277 --> 01:14:38,737
Well, it seems that Ty and I come to agreement. Comon Mr.Watest

1173
01:14:40,016 --> 01:14:41,916
- I'm really big fan, Mr. Parker.
- Get out of here.

1174
01:14:45,656 --> 01:14:46,680
OK

1175
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:49,347
what did you do?

1176
01:14:51,995 --> 01:14:54,828
hay, I'm so happy for you, Elle.

1177
01:14:55,528 --> 01:15:02,728
Ty and Elle, sit in a tree.. K,I,S,S

1178
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:05,171
- Stop it, guys
- No, I will not

1179
01:15:05,242 --> 01:15:09,372

1183
01:15:24,029 --> 01:15:25,894
You know, and I played a part in it.

1184
01:15:25,965 --> 01:15:27,626
I should do this for a living

1185
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,689
What, middle?

1186
01:15:28,868 --> 01:15:30,165

Do you mind if I talk to Elle for a second?

1190
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,440
"Please...

1191
01:15:44,917 --> 01:15:46,214
Alright, outside.

1192
01:15:57,129 --> 01:15:58,096
wait, you're too close.

1193
01:16:17,051 --> 01:16:18,575
Elle, what's going on?

1194
01:16:18,986 --> 01:16:20,578
Ty just broke up with me.

1195
01:16:20,655 --> 01:16:21,747
What?"

1196
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:29,452
you forgot your coffee.

1197
01:16:31,065 --> 01:16:32,965
I know who's behind this

1198
01:16:33,434 --> 01:16:35,698
oh they're not gonna get a way with it

1199
01:16:35,937 --> 01:16:38,303
- Not on my watch

1200
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:39,371
Let's go

01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,771

- I don't care.

1202
01:16:40,841 --> 01:16:42,832
-  I said let's go
- Okay, I'm going.

1203
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:52,712
I don't know really about this.I.. I just don't think it's gonna work.

1204
01:16:52,888 --> 01:16:54,617
yes, it is. It's gonna work.

1205
01:16:54,657 --> 01:16:55,885
Oh here they come.

1206
01:16:59,696 --> 01:17:01,755
It's so amazing.

1207
01:17:01,831 --> 01:17:06,097
you better stick to our plan or we will tell everybody your little secret.

1208
01:17:06,169 --> 01:17:07,966

1209
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:10,767

1221

Hay, Mom. It's me Brenda.

1231
01:18:58,353 --> 01:18:59,377
No,

1232
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:38,517
Mama, how's Tina?

1233
01:19:39,395 --> 01:19:42,091
Mama, she's a 700 pound cow

1234
01:19:42,231 --> 01:19:44,358
What do you expect us to do with her?

1235
01:19:44,633 --> 01:19:48,433
No, mama, nobody knows who Brenda Smirkle is!

1236
01:19:49,805 --> 01:19:51,238
We really had a good day today.

1237
01:19:51,306 --> 01:19:53,399
We conv.. convince Ty to break up with his girlfriend ...

1238
01:19:53,575 --> 01:19:55,668
So she won't be no problem no more

1239
01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:57,311
No mama

1240
01:19:57,513 --> 01:19:58,980
Nobody thinks a thing mama

1241
01:19:59,048 --> 01:20:03,075
They all think that  I'm Kandi Kane, the British star, from great Britain.

1242
01:20:03,186 --> 01:20:05,950
Yeah, the internets are amazing, aren't they? I know.

1243
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:09,957
No, mama, nobody is gonna think anything

1244
01:20:10,026 --> 01:20:13,826
about time anybody figures this out, we're all gonna be counting money on a beach ...

1245
01:20:13,864 --> 01:20:16,332
Hold it, missy. The only money you'll be counting

1246
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,028
is when you're giving back change at the 95 cent store

1247
01:20:19,103 --> 01:20:20,900
Let's go. You have some explaining to do, you know

1248
01:20:20,971 --> 01:20:22,802
I have all this on video.

1249
01:20:27,245 --> 01:20:30,578
- Mr Sinclair, I can explain.
- oh be quiet, Brenda.

1250
01:20:30,715 --> 01:20:31,943
Who's Brenda?

1251
01:20:33,051 --> 01:20:33,983
What is this?

1252
01:20:34,052 --> 01:20:36,850
It's Kandi's, I mean! Breanda's graduation picture

1253
01:20:36,922 --> 01:20:40,289
You know, I heard Bismarck is quite lovely this time of year.

1254
01:20:40,892 --> 01:20:44,020
Mr. Sinclair, I can explain this whole thing

1255
01:20:44,196 --> 01:20:46,096
Let me save you some time, Brenda.

1256
01:20:46,465 --> 01:20:48,299
What you've been doing is called fraud.

1257
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:50,963
And the fact that you were pretend to make a lot of money doing it ...

1258
01:20:51,037 --> 01:20:52,265
also makes it a felony

1259
01:20:52,872 --> 01:20:56,103
And I have a suspecion that private conversation you had it with Ty in my office

1260
01:20:56,776 --> 01:20:59,244
also had it in the blackmailing

1261
01:21:00,012 --> 01:21:02,207
So if you don't wanna continue this conversation ...

1262
01:21:02,281 --> 01:21:07,150
with a lot of blue uniforms with badges on it, I suggest you leave immediately.

1263
01:21:10,691 --> 01:21:14,525
And as for you three, you can be dismissed as well

1264
01:21:15,028 --> 01:21:17,690
- But Allen ...
- Stick to your renegotiation very soon.

1265
01:21:17,764 --> 01:21:20,358
But Allen, we are Sensation, we are the number one band

1266
01:21:21,635 --> 01:21:22,761
Oh, oh my God! oh my God! oh my God!

1267
01:21:24,906 --> 01:21:26,032
Awesome

1268
01:21:30,411 --> 01:21:31,378
Where is Elle?

1269
01:21:31,613 --> 01:21:32,841
The audition!

1270
01:21:33,114 --> 01:21:34,843
 We gotta go. Common

1271
01:22:07,081 --> 01:22:08,139

1273
01:22:20,564 --> 01:22:21,997

1274
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:24,594
and what will you be singing for us today?

1275
01:22:25,402 --> 01:22:28,098
An original called fairytale.

1276
01:22:28,305 --> 01:22:29,636
What's the song about?

1277
01:22:30,574 --> 01:22:32,667
It's about following your...

1278
01:22:37,914 --> 01:22:39,347
Following your dreams.

1279
01:22:42,152 --> 01:22:43,312
Very well then!

1280
01:23:16,054 --> 01:23:18,682
Iam sorry, I wasn't ready. Can I start again?

1281
01:23:18,757 --> 01:23:22,318
- Are you ready now?
- Yes, Miss. Daniels are you ready?

1282
01:23:25,163 --> 01:23:26,425

1283
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:37,666

1285
01:23:39,845 --> 01:23:41,278

and I always will be. You can do this

1287
01:23:43,816 --> 01:23:45,579
I don't think I can.

1288
01:23:47,553 --> 01:23:50,317

1289
