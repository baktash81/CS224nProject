1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,809
You ready?

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,603
Yeah. Boot it.

4
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,565
That's it.

5
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,567
That's it. That's it. Excellent.

6
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,777
I'm recordin'.

7
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,780
Are you crazy?
Wait till I get this thing down.

8
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,907
You trying to I.D. me?
Fuckin' retard!

9
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,575
Goddamn, you stupid fuck!

10
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,243
Don't be a pussy.

11
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,747
Don't call me a pussy.
I'll fucking I.D. you!

12
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,082
Here, take the gun.

13
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,584
This piece of shit?
I can't believe it.

14
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,628
Is it even loaded?
I want the auto.

15
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,962
Asshole.

16
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,343
Whoo! I love this shit, man!

17
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,929
Don't fuckin'...
Fuck you!

18
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,431
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

19
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,475
It's right there.
Turn right.

20
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,643
OK, just relax.

21
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,977
Relax!

22
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,479
Right, right, right.

23
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,231
Here we go. There it is.

24
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,607
Shh.

25
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,109
Take it easy.

26
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,278
One... two... three... go!

27
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,990
Let's go! Let's go!

28
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,325
Rush that punk!

29
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,872
Put your head down!

30
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,333
I said down!

31
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,960
I'll fuckin'
blow your head off!

32
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,880
This is a robbery!
Everyone, hands up!

33
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,549
You, get to the back!

34
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,676
Hands in the air!

35
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,220
No, no, no.
Where you going, bitch?

36
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,722
Over here. Over here.

37
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,056
Get the fucking money!

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,892
You! Open the fucking register!

39
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,562
You want to die,
you little fuck?

40
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,397
OK. Please, don't shoot!

41
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,399
Where's the fucking money?

42
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,235
There's the fucking money!

43
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,070
Don't shoot us.

44
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,405
This way.

45
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,698
OK.

46
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,410
Go, man. Run!
Run, man, run!

47
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,828
You wanna die?

48
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,079
Go, go, go!

49
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,082
Don't look at me,
you fuckin' Chink!

50
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,584
Get in there!

51
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,628
Get inside,
you fucking cocksucker!

52
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,758
- Did you get the money?
- Yes!

53
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,260
What are you doing,
you fucking asshole?

54
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,928
Come on, we gotta go!

55
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,598
You get the money or not?
How much?

56
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,060
This is the police!

57
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,227
Fuck!

58
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,229
I'm going. I'm going.

59
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,065
Um... fuck. Here.

60
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,318
Come on, follow me!

61
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,906
Go, man, go!

62
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,241
The fucking doors are locked!

63
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,910
Come on!

64
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,411
Come on!

65
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,413
Where are the cops, man?

66
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,415
Fuck you!

67
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,250
What are you doing, man?

68
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,585
Go, man! Go!

69
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,753
Shit!

70
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,255
Stop!

71
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,928
Drop your goddamn weapon!

72
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:40,970
Come on!

73
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,472
They're right behind us!

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,266
Fuck!

75
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,769
Come on! Oh, shit!

76
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,270
Go, man, go!

77
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,438
- Come on.
- Go.

78
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,780
Come on!

79
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,281
Come on, jump!

80
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,325
This is insane, man.

81
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,202
Hey, you, stop!

82
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,375
Come on, grab my hand!

83
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,836
I'm gonna die!
Hold on to me, man!

84
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,004
You mother fucker!

85
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,969
God damn it!
You know I don't deal in snuff!

86
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,387
Don't have a fucking coronary.

87
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,930
You could've
at least warned me!

88
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,433
You know I hate the zap
when they die.

89
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,810
It just brings down
your whole day. Jesus, Tick.

90
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,020
Sorry.

91
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,814
How come the cops
didn't put it in evidence?

92
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,816
With all the blood,
they didn't see the rig.

93
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:35,984
It was under a wig.

94
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,777
How'd it get to you?

95
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,821
I got ways, Lenny.

96
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,948
I got a deal
with some of the paramedics.

97
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,159
My guy pages me,
I pick it up at the morgue.

98
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,787
This clip's got to be
worth a grand, right?

99
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,789
Tick, not to dash your hopes...

100
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,500
but I don't deal this kind
of product. You know that.

101
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,170
I'll give you four, 'cause
I've gotta cut off the end...

102
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,880
and my customers want uncut.

103
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,965
Fuck that, man.
The last part is the best.

104
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,134
You dry dive six stories...
blammo!

105
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,594
You jack into the big black.

106
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,721
I don't deal black-jack clips!

107
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,515
It's policy. I got ethics here.

108
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,559
When did that start?

109
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,811
This is what people wanna see.
You know it.

110
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,480
So lay it off to somebody else.

111
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,647
Lenny, Lenny.

112
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,483
I got expenses.
I gotta get my rig fixed.

113
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,485
There's blood
all over the heads.

114
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,862
- Take it away.
- Gimme six, at least.

115
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,406
This is a good clip.
It gets you pumpin'.

116
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,408
The first part's OK...

117
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,911
better than the usual soaps
you bring me.

118
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,914
That is cold.
I always bring you choice.

119
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,249
Like this low-grade shit here?

120
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,918
Some girl in a fight
with her boyfriend.

121
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,420
It's a test pattern.
Nothing happens. I'm snoring.

122
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,714
Lenny,
you're always telling me...

123
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,925
bring you street life,
real life...

124
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,927
that one man's mundane
and desperate existence...

125
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,346
is another man's Technicolor.

126
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,722
I said that?

127
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,432
Many times.
It's a direct quote.

128
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,434
I'll take it for five.

129
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,728
You'll make out OK,
'cause it's pure cream.

130
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,313
You don't have to cut
anything back to the wearer.

131
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,440
Yeah, that's for sure.

132
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,442
- OK.
- What else you got?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

134
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,546
It's a little after two a.m.,
December 30, 1999.

135
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,715
Second to last day
of the whole darn century.

136
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,592
Jer, hi. I'll drop
the money by tomorrow.

137
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,886
Next day latest.
It's a little crazed right now.

138
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,764
Would I lie?
No, never to you, Jer.

139
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,392
You're not wrong.
You're not wrong.

140
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,935
Prick.

141
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,821
Dan, looking forward to the new year?

142
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,866
Not really.
I mean, what's the point?

143
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,284
Nothing changes New Year's Day.

144
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,286
The economy sucks.

145
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,788
Gas is over
three bucks a gallon.

146
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,459
Fifth-grade kids are shooting
each other at recess.

147
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,503
The whole thing sucks.
What are we celebrating?

148
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,897
You shoot the clip.
Get it to me by Monday.

149
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,399
Client wants a guy and
two girls, and the guy wears.

150
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,818
Yeah. No, I know.
He's trying to be original.

151
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,029
The girls have to be young, OK?

152
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,239
So don't use your mother
like you usually do.

153
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,741
Yeah, you, too, asshole.

154
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,951
Go ahead,
caller. You're on the air.

155
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,453
My name's Dewayne.

156
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,413
I got a New Year's resolution
for the police.

157
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,124
Hey, yo, Five-O, you better
get down with the Two-K.

158
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,834
Two-K? What is that?

159
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,380
Two-K. The big 2000.
Coming up tomorrow night.

160
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,756
Out with the old,
in with the new.

161
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,342
See, for the man,
no new is good new.

162
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,388
We're gonna take it
and make it new, our own.

163
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,972
History's gonna
start right here.

164
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,140
Dewayne...

165
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,851
I wanna give
a shout-out to Boo...

166
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,561
You're on the air, Lori.

167
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,105
If you read the Bible...

168
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,691
you'd know there won't be
another thousand years.

169
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,859
We're in the last days
as foretold in the...

170
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,655
The last days?
The apocalypse, the rapture?

171
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,033
Look at the signs. There
are wars and rumors of wars...

172
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,869
Just so we know
how much time is left...

173
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,706
when is the rapture
supposed to hit, exactly?

174
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,875
- Midnight New Year's Eve?
- That's right.

175
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,877
Now, is that
midnight L.A. time...

176
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,213
or Eastern Standard Time
or what?

177
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,382
What time zone is God in?

178
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,384
I pray for you all.

179
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,400
Ooh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

180
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,112
OK. I can use this.
Listen, it's not bad...

181
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,614
but, honey, you gotta move
your eyes slower next time.

182
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,118
Much slower, like you're
making love with your eyes.

183
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,546
Let me get this straight.

184
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,215
You'll pay me two hundred
dollars to wear a hair net...

185
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,719
and bang some beautiful babe?
I gotta think about this.

186
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,554
Let's get you wired up.

187
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,723
I hope this axle grease
you got on your hair...

188
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,641
doesn't screw up
the SQUID receptors.

189
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,435
What is all
this SQUID shit, anyway?

190
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,940
Superconducting Quantum
Interference Device... SQUID.

191
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,903
The receptor rig on your head
sends a signal to the recorder.

192
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,906
We call it "being wired,"
but there's no wire.

193
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,326
You gotta keep the recorder
close... five, six feet max...

194
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,829
a jacket pocket, by the bed,
wherever you close escrow.

195
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,831
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

196
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,085
There's a half hour of tape,
so give me some lead-in.

197
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,294
Don't wait too long.

198
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,754
I don't want to
be going out for popcorn.

199
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,922
Don't worry. You won't.

200
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,507
- Got it?
- No problem.

201
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,802
You look great.
You look... beautiful.

202
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,309
Shit!

203
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,739
Get out!

204
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,318
Ten-seventeen,
do you request backup?

205
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,820
That's a negative.

206
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,867
Suspect is a black male,
thirty-five to forty.

207
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,870
We're handling it.

208
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,819
- Freeze!
- Freeze! You bitch!

209
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,036
You fuckin' bitch!

210
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,156
Oh, shit.

211
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,451
God!

212
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,804
Hi, it's Lenny.

213
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,764
Just what do you have in mind?

214
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,771
Lenny... God damn it,
you got to be there.

215
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,358
You got to help me.
Please pick up the phone.

216
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,154
Come on, pick up.

217
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,158
Come on, Lenny,
fucking pick up the phone!

218
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,536
OK, I'll call you back.

219
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,575
Watch what I do. You OK?

220
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,620
You're doin' good, honey.

221
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,464
You look so good.

222
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,474
Faith, come back.

223
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,769
You all right? You need help?

224
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,647
Sweetie, you're doing good.

225
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:03,945
Lenny...

226
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:10,201
I'm sorry. Ha ha ha!

227
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,288
I'm sorry, baby. Are you OK?

228
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,462
- How do you feel?
- Lucky.

229
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,758
Dry me.

230
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,895
You wanna watch,
or you gonna do?

231
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,563
Watch and see.

232
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,258
Oh, wow...

233
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,072
Oh, baby, baby, baby...

234
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,243
You're so beautiful.

235
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,912
I love your eyes, Lenny.

236
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,458
I love the way they see.

237
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,519
New Year's Eve, 1999.

238
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,063
It's being called
the party of the century...

239
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,399
but it may be the biggest ever.

240
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,401
No one's seen preparations
like this...

241
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,404
but preparations
require care and insurance...

242
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,906
and the LAPD
is one insurance company...

243
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,908
that doesn't want accidents.

244
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,412
Put you on a reservation

245
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,830
Black nation

246
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,416
Die under your step
and fetch a military lie...

247
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,752
The bodies of two men found
under the Hollywood Freeway...

248
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,255
have been identified
as rap starJeriko One...

249
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:54,092
and band memberJames Polton,
known to fans as Replay.

250
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,220
Both were shot in what police
are characterizing...

251
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,097
as an execution-style killing.

252
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,932
The body
of an unidentified woman...

253
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,518
was found with them,
also shot numerous times.

254
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,855
Police said the killings
appear to be gang-related.

255
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,898
With his band,
Prophets of Light...

256
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,901
Jeriko One's outspoken political
stance and violent lyrics...

257
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,696
have stirred nationwide
controversy.

258
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,699
Meanwhile,
astrologers have been busy...

259
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,367
making predictions
for the coming century.

260
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,537
Some of their fortune-telling
is indeed incredible...

261
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,249
Muammar Qaddafi will be awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize.

262
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,710
Turkey will make
reparations to Armenia.

263
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,880
By 2025,there will be
a second woman president...

264
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,392
- Hey, Lenny.
- How ya doin', man?

265
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,810
Hey, man.

266
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,939
Keith.

267
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,193
- Keith?
- Yeah.

268
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,236
Hi. Lenny. Lenny Nero.

269
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,072
We spoke on the phone. Hi.

270
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,282
OK.

271
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:07,040
Not to be rude, but I gotta ask.
Are you a cop?

272
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,292
I understand. No, I'm not.

273
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,462
You understand. Attorney, right?

274
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,923
That's right.

275
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,635
Tassel shoes. Entertainment law
would be my guess.

276
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,638
It's my job to know people
and what they want...

277
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,640
what's behind their eyes.

278
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,102
OK, so tell me,
have you ever jacked in?

279
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,729
Have you ever wire-tripped?

280
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,482
No.

281
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,944
A virgin brain.
We're gonna start you off right.

282
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,988
Just save us some time,
tell me what you know.

283
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,490
Just what I've read.

284
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,493
That the technology
was developed for the Feds...

285
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:48,123
to replace the body wire,
and now it's gone black market.

286
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,166
That's right, so...

287
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,919
this conversation's
not taking place, OK?

288
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,463
- Damn right it's not.
- Good.

289
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,591
Do I get the deck from you?

290
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,386
I'll get you a deck at my cost.
My thing is the software.

291
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,512
Clips, right?

292
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,222
Clips. Right.

293
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:09,936
Listen, I want you to know
what we're talking about here.

294
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,939
This is not
"like TV, only better."

295
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,109
This is life.

296
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,361
It's a piece of somebody's life.

297
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:22,282
It's pure and uncut, straight
from the cerebral cortex.

298
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,451
You're there. You're doing it.

299
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,286
You're seeing it, hearing it.

300
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,454
You're feeling it.

301
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:27,912
You're feeling it.

302
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,459
What kind of things, exactly?

303
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,003
Anything. Whatever you want,
whoever you wanna be.

304
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:38,298
Want to go skiing without
leaving your den, you can...

305
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,633
but I'm assuming
that a guy like you...

306
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,969
you want to ski,
you fly to Aspen.

307
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,971
That's not what
you're interested in.

308
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,014
It's...

309
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,478
It's about the stuff
that you can't have, right?

310
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,646
The forbidden fruit, hmm?

311
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,649
Running into a liquor store with
a.357 Magnum in your hand...

312
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,903
feeling the adrenaline
pumping through your veins, huh?

313
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:04,908
Or see that guy with the
drop-dead Filipino girlfriend?

314
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:08,161
Wouldn't you like to be
that guy for twenty minutes?

315
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,662
The right twenty minutes.

316
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,623
I can make it happen...

317
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,875
and you won't even tarnish
your wedding ring.

318
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,672
Sounds good.

319
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,591
I can get you what you want.

320
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,302
I can get you anything.
Just talk to me.

321
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:27,847
You have to trust me, OK?
'Cause I'm your priest.

322
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,516
I'm your shrink.

323
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,687
I am your main connection
to the switchboard of souls.

324
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,273
I'm the Magic Man.

325
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:40,360
The Santa Claus
of the subconscious.

326
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,571
You say it,
you think it, you can have it.

327
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,784
You want a girl?

328
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,077
You want two girls?

329
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,790
I don't know what your thing is,
what you're curious about.

330
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,250
You want a guy?

331
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,962
Maybe you want to be a girl.

332
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,840
Hey, think of that. Be a girl.

333
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,258
See what that feels like.

334
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,094
Maybe you want a nun
to tie you up.

335
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,971
It's all doable.

336
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,557
Talk to me about costs.

337
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,935
Before we get into numbers,
I want you to try a taste.

338
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,895
I got a deck with me.

339
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,440
- Right here?
- Step into my office.

340
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:58,688
You were just an 18-year-old
girl taking a shower.

341
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,983
Are you beginning to see
the possibilities here?

342
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,652
Hey. So, where is he?

343
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:48,863
- In the back making a deal.
- Oh.

344
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,323
Next time, let's meet
someplace less public.

345
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,449
Nervous? Don't be.

346
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:53,993
Cops have more to worry about
than the SQUID trade.

347
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:55,203
Oh, yeah?

348
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,123
Assume the position,
you miserable techno-perv puke.

349
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,500
Beat it, fuckwad!

350
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,212
Max, I was with a client!
You think that's funny?

351
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,547
Prick.

352
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,508
See the look
on that preppy puke's face?

353
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,218
Pissed all over his Topsiders.

354
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,887
It was funny,
but it cost me money.

355
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,390
Come on, amigo.
The world's full of marks.

356
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,642
No one knows how to work them
like you do, pal.

357
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,895
You could sell a rat's asshole
for a wedding ring.

358
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,647
Yeah, I could.

359
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:26,568
Let me buy you a drink.
Bobby!

360
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:28,319
Bobby!

361
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:30,363
Tequila, por favor.
Double shots.

362
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,574
Make it a Tres Generaciones.

363
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,617
Nothing but the best
for Lenny...

364
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,579
the finest cop to ever get
thrown off the vice squad.

365
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,206
- Fuck you.
- Ha ha ha!

366
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,044
Whoo. Yeah, nice tie.

367
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,253
Thanks, Max.

368
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,088
You always got to dress
like a fucking pimp?

369
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,215
This tie cost more
than your entire wardrobe.

370
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,092
That's not saying much.

371
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,260
It's the one thing...

372
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,803
that stands between me
and the fucking jungle.

373
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,096
To the jungle...

374
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,266
where some shitbird
can cap you in the head...

375
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,893
and that'll ruin
your whole day.

376
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,603
You were lucky, Max.

377
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:05,774
So darned lucky, I wake up with
a twenty-two in my brainpan...

378
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,902
and a cop pension
I can't live off of.

379
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,780
Damn! It's a good thing
I wasn't luckier.

380
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:16,993
Bobby, hit me again.
You seen Faith lately?

381
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,829
- She won't call me.
- Just as well.

382
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,499
Sure, Faith was
the most outstanding woman...

383
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,167
a guy like you
could ever hope to get...

384
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,462
and it's completely humiliating
that she's gone...

385
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:30,799
but you got to face
that it's over.

386
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,134
Thanks, chaplain.
I'm touched by your concern.

387
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:35,804
I just hate to see you
pining away, man.

388
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:38,848
You're my friend.
It makes me want to vomit.

389
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,228
Hey, Iris. You OK?

390
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:45,146
I gotta talk to you.
It's serious.

391
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:47,982
What happened, honey?
Some john get rough on you?

392
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,610
No. I mean, talk private.
Please?

393
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:53,446
I'm in trouble. So is Faith.

394
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,948
There's the magic fucking word.

395
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,617
Can you come with me
to your car, please?

396
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,327
There's something
you have to see.

397
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:00,537
What's going on?

398
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:05,500
- It's a bad situation.
- What?

399
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,335
If they get me,
I know they'II...

400
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,586
Who?

401
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:10,880
Oh, shit.

402
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,263
Hey! Hang on! That's my car!

403
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,474
Not anymore.
It belongs to the bank.

404
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,019
- Wait a second.
- Whoops.

405
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:26,896
Great. Two million years
of human evolution...

406
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,400
that's the best idea
you can come up with.

407
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:33,903
What do you get to repo a car?
Two hundred? Two-fifty?

408
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,905
I'll pay you
three-fifty right now.

409
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,825
- Got the cash on you?
- I was gonna write a check.

410
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,410
See ya.

411
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,913
I totally respect that.
I would want cash.

412
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:47,709
They'll take my check inside.
Just give me two minutes.

413
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,754
Here. You can keep my watch
for collateral.

414
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,882
It's a Rolex.

415
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,426
I'll be right back.
Two minutes.

416
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,635
Two minutes?

417
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,058
Son of a bitch.

418
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:18,239
What happened to your car
this time?

419
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,992
See, Lenny,
if you packed your piece...

420
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:23,078
you could make the guy
see sense.

421
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:26,081
Bobby, turn this up.

422
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,582
You watch us take it all

423
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:30,794
And then you'll
understand our pain

424
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:33,046
We'll make you the rat

425
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,881
That crawled through the cracks

426
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:37,425
You love
that red, white, and blue

427
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,011
But you hate
the black, black, black

428
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,972
And you tryin' to make me think

429
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,516
I did this to myself

430
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,975
When the drugs I smoke

431
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,769
And the guns I tote

432
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:49,187
Both came from your shelf

433
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,237
But I never had a dream, 'cause

434
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,116
My life is a nightmare

435
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:03,827
America's been my boogieman

436
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,121
For four hundred years

437
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,168
Are you asking me how lfeel?

438
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:15,296
We felt Jeriko.
We listened to him.

439
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,342
The LAPD is a military force...

440
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:22,971
turned against its own people.

441
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:25,515
We live in a police state...

442
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:28,977
- Hey, Macey.
- Shh.

443
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,522
...with their social programs
that don't work.

444
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:38,653
They're rearranging deck chairs
on the Titanic.

445
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:42,699
But a new day is coming.

446
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,827
Two-K is coming.

447
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:49,330
The day of reckoning is upon us.

448
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:50,665
History...

449
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:54,377
ends and begins again...

450
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,297
right here... right now!

451
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,009
Right on!
To the end of all things.

452
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,053
You know how I know
it's the end of the world?

453
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,596
No. Tell me.

454
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,599
'Cause everything's
already been done, you know?

455
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,934
Every kind of music's
been tried...

456
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:14,147
every government's been tried,
every fucking hairstyle...

457
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,942
bubble gum flavors, cereal,
every type of fucking.

458
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,903
What are we going to do?

459
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:22,906
How are we going to make
another thousand years?

460
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,908
I'm telling you, it's over.

461
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:26,701
We used it all up.

462
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,536
What's this week's sad story?

463
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,038
They jerked my wheels.

464
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:32,874
It's outrageous the computer
errors the banks make.

465
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,042
Have you noticed?

466
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:37,170
No, I haven't,
because I make my payments.

467
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,964
So, Max Peltier,
how's the P.I. business?

468
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:42,509
Sucks. But when
I get this new logo...

469
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,761
I want to hear this scumbag.

470
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,137
Do you have any leads?

471
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:48,056
Why wasn't Jeriko One
provided adequate security?

472
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:50,392
He always had adequate
security available to him.

473
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,520
He chose not to have
those encumbrances in his life.

474
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:55,230
Why's he a scumbag?

475
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,773
You-know-who left Lenny for him.

476
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:59,484
- Faith left Lenny for him?
- Don't say Faith.

477
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:02,445
Use the "F" word around Lenny,
it triggers a maudlin display...

478
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,239
and you gotta tranquilize him.

479
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:05,782
Shh.

480
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:09,577
I've lost a friend,
a man of great courage...

481
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:13,081
which is more than I can say
for most of us.

482
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,542
- If you're riding...
- Let's go.

483
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,505
Fuck you, you pig!

484
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,469
Driving Mr. Lenny.

485
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,929
It's going to be a big night.

486
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,473
Can't you feel it?
The energy in the air.

487
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,018
There's money to be made,
dreams to sell.

488
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,310
Sleaze to peddle.

489
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:38,440
That is so unenlightened.
I sell experiences.

490
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:41,276
The way I see it, I'm performing
a humanitarian service.

491
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,069
I probably save lives.

492
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:44,779
I wanna hear this part.

493
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:47,741
Everybody needs to walk to
the dark end of the street.

494
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:48,950
It's what we are.

495
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,786
Now the risks are out of line.
The streets are a war zone.

496
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:53,329
Sex can kill you.

497
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:56,249
You slip on the 'trodes
and get what you need...

498
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:59,627
almost as good as
the real thing and a lot safer.

499
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:03,548
Porno. Face it,
you sell porno to wireheads.

500
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:04,924
Harsh and untrue.

501
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,260
My clients are professionals.
They're people with taste.

502
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,595
Some are even celebrities.

503
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,765
- What celebrities?
- The guy from the news.

504
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:14,726
- He does the weather.
- That counts.

505
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,979
- You passed La Cienega.
- I'm not taking it.

506
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:20,523
It's the quickest way
to the club.

507
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:23,193
I've got business there.
I'm meeting people.

508
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:24,694
Mace, you're my friend.

509
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:27,781
Plus I'll give you twenty-five
percent of what I make tonight.

510
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:30,116
This may be
a hard concept for you...

511
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,327
but friends don't have
to pay their friends.

512
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:35,455
- Faith is singing.
- I should have known.

513
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,458
Look...

514
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,169
I pulled twelve hours.
I gotta get some sleep.

515
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:44,130
I got one last pickup
at the St. James Club.

516
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:47,509
They got a taxi stand.
You can catch a cab.

517
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,010
A taxi?

518
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,054
Well, someone might see me.

519
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,307
Hold it right there, ma'am.

520
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:55,850
Whoa. Hold it right there.

521
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,977
Damn it, Lenny,
you made me late.

522
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,729
What's your pickup's name?
I'll find him.

523
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:02,065
- Fumitsu.
- Fumitsu?

524
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,359
Fumitsu. Fumitsu.

525
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:07,028
You can leave
the car right there.

526
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,613
Oh, fuck.

527
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,036
- Nero.
- Strickland.

528
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,538
Commissioner Strickland.

529
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,416
Since you shit-canned my career,
I don't have to call you "sir."

530
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,209
It's one of
life's small pleasures.

531
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:23,878
Aren't you peddling a little far
from your usual gutter?

532
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,423
I was invited here
by a close friend... Mr. Fumitsu.

533
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:27,590
He's right over there.

534
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,970
I don't like
disappointments, Nero.

535
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,888
You know what disappoints me
very much?

536
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,391
Your sex life? Excuse me.

537
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,018
Mr. Fumitsu.

538
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:44,190
Leonard Nero, BLS Limousine
and Security Service.

539
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,401
I've arranged for
one of our finest drivers...

540
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,361
Lornette Mason,
to take care of you.

541
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:51,865
She's a security specialist
trained in defensive combat.

542
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:54,576
Of course, the car's bulletproof
and fully armored.

543
00:33:56,995 --> 00:34:00,331
I'll be coming along to complete
our periodic driver evaluation.

544
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:02,000
With your permission, of course.

545
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,752
We do it to ensure
that our VIP clients...

546
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:06,421
are always treated
as honored guests.

547
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:09,924
Good evening, Mr. Fumitsu.
Sir, please watch your head.

548
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,889
Excuse me, Mr. Nero.

549
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:17,474
Excuse me, sir!

550
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:19,434
What the fuck are you doing?

551
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:20,977
Coming with you.

552
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,943
You will not live
to see the morning.

553
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,531
Drive on.

554
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,458
Are you a cop?

555
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,626
No.

556
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:48,171
Good. Have you ever been wired?

557
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:49,464
Wired?

558
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,259
The latest technology.

559
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:56,012
Oh.
That is so beautiful.

560
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,807
You got to take
a look at this, OK?

561
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:01,935
Yeah. You're going to love it.

562
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:04,854
- You have more?
- I have more.

563
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,856
Believe me, I have more.

564
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,817
Ha ha ha.

565
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,912
Hey! Careful on the jacket.
It's Armani.

566
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:22,664
Are you angry?

567
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:26,459
I told you no wirehead shit
in my car. You're on foot!

568
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:27,919
In L.A.? Are you crazy?

569
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,218
Can I come in?

570
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,971
I'm having a hard time
hearing the stereo!

571
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,517
I need my case.
It's still in the back.

572
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:49,649
Can we talk a little bit
like two rational adults?

573
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:52,569
Can we talk a little bit
like two rational adults?

574
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,700
That'd be no.

575
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,661
OK, you got my attention.

576
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:03,955
This is cutting off
the circulation to my head.

577
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:07,000
Do you mind? Macey.

578
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,261
It's cool. It's nothing.
Two seconds.

579
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:23,099
This is uncharacteristic,
Miss Ice Water-In-Her-Veins.

580
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:24,893
You push me too far!

581
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:28,188
You made me lose it in front
of a client! I could get fired!

582
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,190
- Are we stillfriends?
- I don't know.

583
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:32,150
Friendship is more
than one person...

584
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,569
constantly doing
favors for another.

585
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,237
I don't hustle my friends.

586
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:39,908
But you just suck people along
with scams and your slick act.

587
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:41,409
We're still buddies?

588
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:43,078
Don't use the time
that I'm talking...

589
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,913
to think about what
you'll say next.

590
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:47,957
- You listening?
- Yeah.

591
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:51,586
Lenny, your ass is always broke,
you go from score to score...

592
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:54,422
and you're getting strung-out.
You don't even see it.

593
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:57,967
It's your brain,
so do whatever you want with it.

594
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,261
But not on my watch,
you understand me?

595
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:02,722
I got a child, I got rent...

596
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:05,225
and an ex-husband
doing hard time...

597
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:06,935
who doesn't send me
a dime of support.

598
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,521
I'm just trying to hold on here.

599
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:13,400
I know you wouldn't say this
if you didn't care about me.

600
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:14,567
Thanks, Mace. Really.

601
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:18,071
You're getting out with Fumitsu,
and that's the end.

602
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:23,743
I'll get you to the Templars
in ten minutes.

603
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,662
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

604
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,163
I'm changing my plans.

605
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:30,250
Your supervisor has recommended
an excellent club...

606
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,294
called the Retinal Fetish.
It's on La Cienega.

607
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:34,963
Yes, sir.

608
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,849
Enjoy your evening, Mr. Fumitsu.

609
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,059
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

610
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:51,312
OK, come on.

611
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:52,522
Excuse us.

612
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,066
Excuse us.

613
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,403
Excuse us.

614
00:37:58,486 --> 00:37:59,571
Hi, Lenny.

615
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:01,322
This is a friend of mine,
Mr. Fumitsu.

616
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:02,574
Can you take care of him?

617
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,034
He's clean. He's fine.

618
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:05,869
Could you take care
of this gentleman?

619
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:07,120
Thank you.

620
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:10,498
OK. Bye.

621
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,020
Hey, Lenny. How ya doing?

622
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,398
Who's the new side
of beef in Gant's posse?

623
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:20,985
Wade Beemer, running back
for the Rams, '96, '97.

624
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:22,779
Like a fucking freight train.

625
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:28,702
Rams. That's football, right?

626
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,996
No, ping-pong.
Iris was looking for you!

627
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:40,922
Hello, Lenny.
It's OK, Wade.

628
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:44,551
He's an old friend of mine.
Lenny Nero.

629
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,930
Come to peddle me some clips
for old time's sake...

630
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:51,266
or just making a few extra bucks
for the holidays?

631
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:53,184
You're not a client anymore.

632
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,020
I wouldn't sell you the sweat
off a dead dog's balls.

633
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:58,356
I've got everything
I need from you. Thanks.

634
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:01,276
Cut it out, Philo.

635
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,653
Too bad about your guy Jeriko.

636
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,822
You've lost your golden goose.

637
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:09,159
Show some respect.
He was an important artist.

638
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:12,620
Important for your label,
so you're in mourning.

639
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:16,458
His records will sell out now,
and you'll make out.

640
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:18,126
Always do.

641
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:21,379
Faith, can I talk to you
for one second?

642
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:24,174
It's not a good idea right now.

643
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:26,134
I just gotta talk to you
for one second.

644
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,302
About what?

645
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:30,138
That'd be between me and Faith.

646
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:35,727
Funny, I don't feel anything
between you and Faith.

647
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:39,606
You see,
that's your problem, Lenny...

648
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:40,982
you assume too much.

649
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,401
You assume there's something
where there's nothing.

650
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,737
You assume
that you have a life...

651
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,282
when, in fact, you peddle pieces
of other people's lives...

652
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:52,494
and the broken parts
of your own.

653
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:55,997
- Faith.
- Get him to his car.

654
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,624
Call me, OK?

655
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,417
Faith!

656
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,211
Call me!

657
00:41:01,294 --> 00:41:03,171
Lenny the loser.

658
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:05,674
Leave him alone, Philo, OK?

659
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:08,843
You shouldn't talk to him
or anybody...

660
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:10,887
not with everything
that's going on.

661
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:14,599
You are too goddamn paranoid.
You know that, Philo?

662
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:19,354
Paranoia's just...
reality on a finer scale.

663
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:24,317
Thank you.

664
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:11,906
Hey. What's up, Tex?

665
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,616
What's up, my brother?

666
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,411
Those rascals
still haven't grown back?

667
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:19,247
No. Any day now. I just know it.

668
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,249
Got something for you.

669
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,752
A present,
something I had custom-made.

670
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:26,171
Happy Millennium.

671
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:29,507
I got something for you, too.

672
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:30,967
Just showed up tonight.

673
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,720
I don't know who from.

674
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:38,058
Fan mailfrom some flounder?

675
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,168
Mmm.

676
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:11,466
- Hi.
- Hi.

677
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:28,900
PRONG SINGING:
Strange days not like before

678
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:01,266
I can hardly wait

679
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:07,939
I can hardly wait

680
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:13,611
I can hardly wait

681
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:20,368
I can hardly wait

682
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:26,958
It's been so long

683
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:30,003
I've lost my taste

684
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:33,089
Say angel come

685
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:36,217
Say lick my face

686
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:39,220
Let fall your drapes

687
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:42,432
I'll play the part

688
00:44:42,515 --> 00:44:45,977
I'll open this mouth wide

689
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:50,899
Eat your heart

690
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:59,532
Your heart

691
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,912
I can hardly wait

692
00:45:06,706 --> 00:45:10,168
I can hardly wait

693
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,341
I can hardly wait

694
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:22,764
I can hardly wait

695
00:45:26,976 --> 00:45:29,521
Lips crack dry

696
00:45:29,604 --> 00:45:32,816
Tongue blue burst

697
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:35,777
Say angel come

698
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,321
Say lick my thrust

699
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:41,991
It's been so long

700
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:45,120
I've lost my taste

701
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:48,123
Here, Romeo

702
00:45:48,164 --> 00:45:51,751
Take my water brain

703
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:02,679
Hi, baby.

704
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,390
I missed you.

705
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:08,143
Lenny, you have to leave.
I mean it.

706
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:11,187
Iris said you were in trouble.

707
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,940
- You talked to Iris? When?
- Tonight.

708
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:17,235
I haven't seen her in months.
What the fuck would she know?

709
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:19,279
Who knows what's going on
in that whore's head?

710
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:21,239
She used to be
your best friend.

711
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:24,284
You're really
running out of excuses...

712
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:25,910
to come around, aren't you?

713
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:26,911
I know you, Faith.

714
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:29,831
You're afraid of something.
What's going on?

715
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:32,667
Just let it alone, Lenny.
It'll take care of itself.

716
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:35,754
It's Gant, isn't it?
This guy is poison.

717
00:46:35,837 --> 00:46:38,673
He's got you walled in.
He uses the wire too much.

718
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:41,176
He gets off on tape,
not on you.

719
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:44,054
That's a good one
coming from you.

720
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:46,139
Why don't you just split?

721
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:48,683
- I don't want to.
- Do you love him?

722
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:50,727
I don't think so.

723
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,437
To him, you're some kind
of possession.

724
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,938
You're like a Ferrari.

725
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:56,274
You're just something
to show the other guys.

726
00:46:57,942 --> 00:47:01,071
Yeah?
He has his uses, too, you know.

727
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:04,115
What? He gonna
record you on his label?

728
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,494
He might.
You never know, right?

729
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:10,538
Faith...

730
00:47:11,414 --> 00:47:13,208
Faith, listen to me.

731
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:15,877
I've watched you create yourself
out of nothing.

732
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:18,380
You're like
a goddamn cruise missile...

733
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:21,758
targeted on making it,
and you will.

734
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:24,552
I know I will.

735
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:27,222
It's you
up on that stage, not him.

736
00:47:27,263 --> 00:47:28,556
You don't need him.

737
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:33,144
You have to get out of here.

738
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,438
If Philo catches you,
he's gonna hurt you.

739
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:36,606
I'm already hurting.

740
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,900
No, I'm serious.
He's acting crazy.

741
00:47:38,983 --> 00:47:41,569
He's doing
way too much playback.

742
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,071
He's gotten completely paranoid.

743
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:45,073
He's such a controlfreak now...

744
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:47,951
he's even paying Max
to follow me around.

745
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,828
Max? You're kidding.

746
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:51,579
Yeah, for about a month now.

747
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:53,915
Jesus.

748
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:58,294
Look, Lenny,
just stay away from Philo...

749
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,963
and stay away from me.

750
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:02,674
Stop trying to rescue me.
Those days are over.

751
00:48:02,757 --> 00:48:04,676
I'm a big girl now.
I've changed.

752
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:06,177
Stop trying to save me.

753
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:09,264
I don't need saving.
Just give up on me!

754
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:14,102
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

755
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:21,026
You know why movies
are still better than playback?

756
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:24,404
'Cause the music comes up,
there's credits...

757
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:26,614
and you always know
when it's over.

758
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:29,409
It's over!

759
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:33,955
You were great.

760
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:43,798
Hey, man.
I know what you're thinking.

761
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:45,842
She told me about your new gig.

762
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:48,553
It's just a job.
lfeel like shit about it.

763
00:48:48,636 --> 00:48:51,973
- You should feel like shit.
- I do.

764
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:53,767
You introduced me
to that prick Gant.

765
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,394
I introduced him to Faith, too.
I don't cherish the moment.

766
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:59,439
Questionable move, given
the historical perspective.

767
00:48:59,522 --> 00:49:02,150
lfigured I could take
the prick's money...

768
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:04,152
you wouldn't believe
what I'm charging him...

769
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:07,280
and make sure Faith
is OK at the same time.

770
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:09,366
Keep an eye on her.
For you, OK?

771
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:10,867
Which you can't do...

772
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,120
without getting your fingers
bent the wrong way back.

773
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:18,166
I need the money.
This does us both some good.

774
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:21,461
Fairly twisted logic,
Max, even for you.

775
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:24,506
- Hey, you got a job.
- I got a job.

776
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:27,759
OK. I'm sorry. You got a job.
That's great.

777
00:49:28,968 --> 00:49:30,887
Listen, you got to stay on her.

778
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:32,639
Watch her for me, please.

779
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:34,182
I'm on her.

780
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:35,725
- OK.
- Stay cool.

781
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:38,520
- Take it easy, all right?
- You, too.

782
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:43,942
Come on.

783
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:50,031
Here, chicky, chicky, chicky...

784
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:52,534
Wait a minute.
I recognize you.

785
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:54,119
You're Wade Beemer, right?

786
00:49:54,202 --> 00:49:59,082
Running back for the Rams,
'96, '97, right?

787
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:01,126
Yeah. That's right.

788
00:50:01,209 --> 00:50:03,920
I saw you play, man.
I mean, you were good.

789
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:06,423
I mean,
like a fuckin' freight train.

790
00:50:06,506 --> 00:50:09,384
So, what happened?
Injuries or what?

791
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:11,261
Bullshit politics, man.

792
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:13,805
It's always politics.
Like this thing we're in here.

793
00:50:13,888 --> 00:50:16,975
He's paying you to tune me up.
I'll pay you more not to.

794
00:50:17,058 --> 00:50:18,601
I'll write a check right now.

795
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:22,605
- I got to go.
- OK. Cash!

796
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:25,442
Here's everything I have on me.
What do you say?

797
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:28,069
How about a Rolex?

798
00:50:29,654 --> 00:50:31,448
I got a real one.

799
00:50:31,531 --> 00:50:33,533
Come on. It won't hurt too bad.

800
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:35,035
It's nothing personal.

801
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,245
Just one second, please.

802
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:43,585
It's my jacket.
It's really expensive.

803
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:46,212
And just not... not the eyes.

804
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,436
You're bleeding.

805
00:51:01,478 --> 00:51:04,356
Some jerk puked on the stairs,
and I slipped.

806
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:06,900
I should sue.
You came back for me.

807
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:09,986
I came back
to pick up my client.

808
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:11,529
No. You came back for me.

809
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:15,367
I got to lie down, Macey,
please, in the back?

810
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:37,639
Some piece of work, Lenny Nero.

811
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:41,476
You're calmly backstroking along
in the big toilet bowl...

812
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:44,813
and somehow,
you never let it touch you.

813
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:46,439
I mean, between working vice...

814
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,983
and your current
so-called occupation...

815
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:51,194
you must have seen
every kind of perversion.

816
00:51:51,277 --> 00:51:55,407
But you're just like
some Teflon man.

817
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,911
You still come out this...
goofball romantic.

818
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:02,872
It's my sword and my shield,
Macey.

819
00:52:14,342 --> 00:52:17,303
All right.
A little B & E action.

820
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,347
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

821
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:01,199
Shit.

822
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:17,924
No, no.

823
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:20,760
Please. Please.

824
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:22,012
Please.

825
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:25,015
You can let me go, please.

826
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:28,226
I haven't seen your face.
Please.

827
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:31,271
Let me go.

828
00:54:31,354 --> 00:54:32,647
Let me go, please.

829
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:34,941
Oh, my... Holy...

830
00:54:39,237 --> 00:54:40,363
Lenny.

831
00:54:41,197 --> 00:54:42,365
Lenny!

832
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:45,326
Go to the Sunset Regent
right now.

833
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,746
Go! Go!

834
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:02,260
Oh, Christ.

835
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:10,518
He's jacking her
into his own output.

836
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,729
She's seeing what he's seeing.

837
00:55:12,812 --> 00:55:16,024
She's... she's seeing herself!

838
00:55:41,716 --> 00:55:43,259
No...

839
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:44,969
Oh...

840
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:51,476
Oh, my God.

841
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:08,910
God!

842
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:28,096
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

843
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:16,978
Lenny, what is it?

844
00:57:17,062 --> 00:57:18,646
A black-jack.

845
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,273
Black-jack?

846
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:22,525
A snuff clip.

847
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:27,739
It was Iris.
The sick fucker killed her.

848
00:57:27,822 --> 00:57:29,491
Are you sure it's real?

849
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:07,404
Oh, shit.

850
00:58:33,763 --> 00:58:35,223
Well, I lost my appetite...

851
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:37,684
for about a year.

852
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:43,189
Want to take a look?

853
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:45,066
Hell, no.
I don't fool with that.

854
00:58:48,945 --> 00:58:51,072
- You all right?
- Yeah.

855
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:53,533
- You OK?
- No. Not really.

856
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:54,784
Here.

857
00:58:57,162 --> 00:58:58,705
All right.

858
00:58:58,788 --> 00:59:00,290
Let's work it.

859
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:02,167
No, l... I can't.

860
00:59:03,084 --> 00:59:05,754
Come on, Lenny, you used
to be good at this shit.

861
00:59:05,837 --> 00:59:07,672
Let's play it down.
What's the perp doing?

862
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:08,923
I can't.

863
00:59:08,965 --> 00:59:10,717
You used to be
a fuckin' cop, OK?

864
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,344
That is a fucking murder.

865
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:15,180
What's he doing?

866
00:59:15,263 --> 00:59:16,598
He stalks her...

867
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:21,436
and... he rapes her...

868
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:22,729
and he does her.

869
00:59:22,812 --> 00:59:24,981
And he records it.
He's a thrill-killer.

870
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:26,149
He wants to see it again.

871
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:29,361
He records himself
raping and killing her.

872
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:30,987
But he sends a signal to her.

873
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:34,324
So she feels what he feels
while he's inside her.

874
00:59:34,407 --> 00:59:36,409
The thrill
while he's killing her...

875
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:38,203
sent to her...

876
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:39,621
heightening her fear...

877
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:42,624
which heightens
the turn-on for him.

878
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:46,878
I've seen a lot.

879
00:59:46,961 --> 00:59:48,380
So have I. Too much.

880
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:51,049
- It's a bad one.
- Yeah.

881
00:59:53,593 --> 00:59:56,638
He makes her see her own death,
feeds off the reaction.

882
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:59,724
He records it all. Everything.

883
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:01,351
And gives it to you.

884
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:03,603
He wants to share it.

885
01:00:03,645 --> 01:00:05,814
Of course
he wants to share, man.

886
01:00:05,897 --> 01:00:08,316
That's his deal.
He needs an audience.

887
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:10,735
- This is a sick puppy.
- Why me?

888
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:12,362
'Cause you're
the Magic Man, Lenny.

889
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:15,323
You make dreams happen,
don't you?

890
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:16,908
If it's got something
to do with the wire...

891
01:00:16,991 --> 01:00:19,369
sooner or later,
it washes up on your beach.

892
01:00:19,452 --> 01:00:21,663
I've never dealt in black-jacks.

893
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:25,417
- Everybody knows that.
- He's just skull-fucking you.

894
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,419
He just wants
a reaction from you.

895
01:00:27,502 --> 01:00:30,964
He wants to make you do
something you do not want to do.

896
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:35,176
Maybe he just figures
Lenny will appreciate it.

897
01:00:35,218 --> 01:00:37,554
It's the dark end of the street.
How do you like it now?

898
01:00:37,637 --> 01:00:39,264
Jesus, Mace, back off.

899
01:00:39,347 --> 01:00:42,559
No. This guy's
one of your SQUID-head contacts.

900
01:00:42,642 --> 01:00:44,477
He's somebody that you know.

901
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:48,606
The problem with that
is Lenny knows everybody.

902
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,066
Take the tape to the cops.

903
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,276
No.

904
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:55,363
No. They'll crucify me.

905
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:59,826
So this wire-freak gets
to keep running around, huh?

906
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:02,537
Lenny's right. The police
will think he's the perp...

907
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:05,123
or they'll go through his
client list and ruin his life...

908
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:07,876
such as it is.

909
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:10,337
I'll call my buddies
at Homicide.

910
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,047
I'll tell them Iris
was a friend of mine...

911
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:13,673
and that'll put me in the loop.

912
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,842
I'll get the forensics
and all that shit.

913
01:01:16,634 --> 01:01:17,719
Get some sleep.

914
01:01:17,802 --> 01:01:19,220
I'll call you
when I get something.

915
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:20,430
Relax!

916
01:01:23,224 --> 01:01:24,684
Lenny!

917
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:26,394
Keep moving, man.

918
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:28,313
Somebody's thinking
about you a whole lot.

919
01:02:05,725 --> 01:02:07,477
Leave me alone.

920
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:10,605
Don't come to my house.

921
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:12,107
Are you trying to ruin my life?

922
01:02:12,148 --> 01:02:14,484
Iris is dead. She was murdered.

923
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:19,614
Who did it?

924
01:02:19,698 --> 01:02:21,783
I don't know, but
this guy's real damaged goods.

925
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:23,118
Iris knew someone was after her.

926
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:24,452
She said
you were in danger, too.

927
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:27,497
- I'm not in any danger.
- No more games.

928
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,873
Whatever you're hiding,
whatever's going on...

929
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:32,127
you have to get out of here now.

930
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,254
Then what?
Are you gonna protect me?

931
01:02:34,337 --> 01:02:37,090
Are you a big tough guy?
You're a fucking talker.

932
01:02:37,173 --> 01:02:38,299
You don't even own a gun.

933
01:02:38,383 --> 01:02:40,135
I have a gun. It's under my bed.

934
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:48,852
You don't know what you're
fucking with.

935
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:49,894
Tell me.

936
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:52,355
Tell him, Faith. Go on.

937
01:02:53,648 --> 01:02:58,611
Lenny just stopped by
to give me some bad news.

938
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:00,321
An old friend of mine's
been murdered.

939
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:02,240
Remember Iris?

940
01:03:02,323 --> 01:03:03,950
How the fuck
did you get up here?

941
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:05,493
Charm.

942
01:03:06,911 --> 01:03:08,455
Tell you what, Lenny.

943
01:03:08,538 --> 01:03:11,291
Just for you, hmm?
Make you a deal.

944
01:03:11,374 --> 01:03:13,251
Why don't you just take her?

945
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:15,754
If she's so unhappy and
wants to leave, she can go.

946
01:03:15,837 --> 01:03:17,672
I'll let her decide.

947
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:21,217
Faith always knows
what she wants. Don't you, baby?

948
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:23,553
See? Hands off.

949
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:27,557
I'll tell you something else.

950
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,185
I'll tell you this, you fuck.

951
01:03:30,226 --> 01:03:33,813
If she says she stays, you go.

952
01:03:33,855 --> 01:03:37,108
You crawl
back in your cockroach hole...

953
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:39,027
and you never
cross my vision again.

954
01:03:43,865 --> 01:03:45,033
Faith...

955
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:48,828
Come on.

956
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:56,336
Come on.

957
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:05,887
I've made my choice, Lenny.

958
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,687
Get him out.

959
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:15,814
Get him out!

960
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,360
You're fucking crazy, Faith!

961
01:04:20,443 --> 01:04:22,904
Come with me! Faith!

962
01:04:26,866 --> 01:04:29,661
I don't love you anymore!
Do you understand that?

963
01:04:29,744 --> 01:04:31,663
You mean nothing to me!

964
01:04:31,746 --> 01:04:35,083
Leave me alone, Lenny, please.

965
01:04:39,462 --> 01:04:42,340
You said you were
gonna get Iris out of this.

966
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:45,010
Now you understand
the danger we're in.

967
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:47,429
That was so sweet what you
said out there. So touching.

968
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:49,305
I almost believed it.

969
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:53,059
I don't think he understands
you did it for him.

970
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:55,103
He doesn't even know
what's going on.

971
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:56,229
Leave him alone!

972
01:04:56,312 --> 01:04:58,189
I'd leave him alone
if he'd stop coming around...

973
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:00,358
and you would just stop
talking to him!

974
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:07,073
The only time a whore
should open her mouth...

975
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:09,617
is when she's giving head.

976
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:17,500
Shit! Mace! Help!

977
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,501
Shit! Mace! Help!

978
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:20,003
Don't be shy, Lenny.
This is your floor.

979
01:05:20,086 --> 01:05:21,212
Let's go.

980
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:24,799
Lenny, guess who's going
to the hospital?

981
01:05:24,841 --> 01:05:27,802
Can we be smart here?
I can make it worth your while.

982
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:31,264
I'm not saying
I mind a couple of shots.

983
01:05:31,348 --> 01:05:34,434
Just go light is all I'm saying.
Here, look. Take my Rolex.

984
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:39,356
Ooh, nice watch.

985
01:05:39,439 --> 01:05:41,649
- Is this impact resistant?
- Yeah, sure.

986
01:05:43,234 --> 01:05:45,153
You stupid piece of shit!

987
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:47,572
You stupid fuck. Get up!

988
01:05:47,655 --> 01:05:49,616
Come on. Get up!

989
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:56,498
Oh, ho. Pain, pain!

990
01:06:01,795 --> 01:06:03,838
Hey, Lenny, we tried
to find a smaller girl...

991
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:06,675
to beat the shit out of you,
but it was short notice.

992
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:09,094
It was short notice.

993
01:06:09,177 --> 01:06:12,389
Oh! Ow! That one had to hurt.

994
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,906
Safety's on.

995
01:06:48,675 --> 01:06:50,385
Come on. Let's go.

996
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:53,388
Hey, wait!

997
01:06:54,806 --> 01:06:57,350
Ohh! That's fucked up.

998
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,398
I need a drink.

999
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,899
Get some rest.

1000
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:06,818
The cops know
they'll never nail this guy...

1001
01:07:06,901 --> 01:07:09,029
the second
they walk in the room.

1002
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:11,114
It's all about
what they see walking in...

1003
01:07:11,197 --> 01:07:14,242
dead hooker, handcuffs,
penetration.

1004
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:16,327
Cops are lazy.

1005
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:18,747
They know nobody gives a shit
about a dead hooker.

1006
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,248
They're road kill, right?

1007
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:22,917
They'll take some pictures,
make some jokes...

1008
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:25,754
and just shrug it off
like it's a random kill.

1009
01:07:25,837 --> 01:07:28,256
It's a trick gone wrong.
It's the kind you never solve.

1010
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:31,092
That doesn't add, does it?

1011
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:33,428
Because Iris said
she knew somebody was after her.

1012
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:34,637
That is not random.

1013
01:07:34,721 --> 01:07:37,307
If they get me...

1014
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:39,809
She said "they."
"If they get me."

1015
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:44,314
This whole random
sex-killer thing is bullshit.

1016
01:07:44,397 --> 01:07:45,899
Somebody whacked her
for a reason.

1017
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,026
So this guy's not a psycho?

1018
01:07:48,109 --> 01:07:49,527
No, he's a psycho.

1019
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:50,695
To do what's on that tape...

1020
01:07:50,779 --> 01:07:53,239
he's not a well-adjusted
human being.

1021
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:55,450
I gotta get some sleep.

1022
01:07:56,618 --> 01:07:57,744
OK, Lenny.

1023
01:07:58,578 --> 01:07:59,788
Put that down...

1024
01:07:59,829 --> 01:08:01,039
and I'll check on you tomorrow.

1025
01:08:01,122 --> 01:08:02,582
Hey, you want to rub my neck?

1026
01:08:04,834 --> 01:08:06,294
My shoulder's real sore.

1027
01:08:06,378 --> 01:08:08,797
OK. All right. Come here.

1028
01:08:11,591 --> 01:08:14,302
- Right here?
- Oh, yeah.

1029
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:15,595
Ohh...

1030
01:08:21,309 --> 01:08:22,727
Don't stop.

1031
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:25,313
How's Zander?

1032
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:27,148
He's fine.

1033
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:31,027
I miss him.

1034
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:32,612
He misses you, too.

1035
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:37,867
I'm real sorry about being
so hard on you earlier.

1036
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:40,829
It's just that I see you...

1037
01:08:40,912 --> 01:08:43,832
getting sucked into this
deeper and deeper, and...

1038
01:08:43,915 --> 01:08:47,210
Macey, come on.
I know you still love me.

1039
01:08:54,843 --> 01:08:57,762
How can you do this
in front of your child?

1040
01:08:58,638 --> 01:09:00,849
- In front of your own son?
- Macey, hold on!

1041
01:09:00,932 --> 01:09:03,309
In front of your own son!

1042
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:06,813
Zander!

1043
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:10,400
Zander!

1044
01:09:12,527 --> 01:09:14,487
"When a child loves you
for a long, long time...

1045
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:16,823
"not just to play with,
but really loves you..."

1046
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:18,908
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mommy!

1047
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:21,870
- This is Lenny.
- Hi.

1048
01:09:24,205 --> 01:09:25,331
Come on.

1049
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:47,604
Hi, it's Lenny.
Just what do you have in mind?

1050
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:52,776
Last day of the world,
you spend it in bed?

1051
01:09:56,112 --> 01:09:58,323
- What's up, Max?
- Not a whole hell of a lot, man.

1052
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:01,159
They've just been
saying words overJeriko.

1053
01:10:01,242 --> 01:10:03,953
Tension's running
pretty high down here.

1054
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:06,081
- Faith OK?
- Yeah.

1055
01:10:06,122 --> 01:10:08,375
She's leaving with Gant,
so I gotta boogie real quick.

1056
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:11,378
Iris checked into the Regent
last night under a false name.

1057
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:13,088
She paid cash.

1058
01:10:13,129 --> 01:10:14,923
- She was hiding out.
- Yep.

1059
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:18,259
I heard you dropped in
on Gant last night.

1060
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:19,803
Another slick Lenny move?

1061
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:22,180
He's in this somehow,
but I don't know how.

1062
01:10:22,263 --> 01:10:24,933
Just stay close to Faith, OK?

1063
01:10:25,016 --> 01:10:27,769
No worries, bro. I gotta jam.

1064
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:28,575
Jesus.

1065
01:13:28,658 --> 01:13:29,868
What up, Lenny?

1066
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:33,705
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere.

1067
01:13:33,788 --> 01:13:35,623
You're acting strange.
What's going on?

1068
01:13:35,665 --> 01:13:36,958
- Shh, Mace.
- What?

1069
01:13:38,668 --> 01:13:40,003
We'll talk about it in the car.

1070
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:43,631
Hand me that box of tapes.

1071
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:45,717
Yeah.

1072
01:13:56,519 --> 01:13:58,855
- Oh, shit.
- What's the matter?

1073
01:13:58,938 --> 01:14:00,774
This tie doesn't go with blue.

1074
01:14:09,908 --> 01:14:11,284
Lenny, would you relax?

1075
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:14,537
We're not being followed.
Stop being so paranoid.

1076
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:19,000
The guy had a knife
to my throat in my living room.

1077
01:14:20,168 --> 01:14:21,795
Relaxing might be right out.

1078
01:14:45,652 --> 01:14:47,445
Oh, man.

1079
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:50,448
That is one unbelievable piece
of eyefuck.

1080
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:51,700
Skip the art criticism, Tick.

1081
01:14:51,741 --> 01:14:53,535
What can you tell me
about the wearer?

1082
01:14:55,495 --> 01:14:57,706
- That guy is fucked up.
- We know that.

1083
01:14:57,747 --> 01:14:59,874
No. The killer's got
some kind of distortion...

1084
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:01,376
in the visual cortex.

1085
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:04,671
The color and gray-scale values
are all messed up.

1086
01:15:04,754 --> 01:15:06,798
Like color blindness.
See the peak period ratios?

1087
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:10,719
There could be some kind
of tumor or brain lesion.

1088
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,430
Whoever's doing this is using
a box to split the signal...

1089
01:15:13,513 --> 01:15:14,973
You ever make a box like that?

1090
01:15:15,056 --> 01:15:18,226
Yeah, but I can't see the gear
well enough to see if it's mine.

1091
01:15:20,103 --> 01:15:21,271
I don't like this.

1092
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:23,898
- This is not good.
- What?

1093
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:27,402
It's cutting close to me.
She was just here, man.

1094
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:29,738
- Who was?
- Iris! Pay attention!

1095
01:15:29,779 --> 01:15:30,905
Iris was here?

1096
01:15:30,947 --> 01:15:33,116
The other night,
shaking like a junkie...

1097
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,118
saying she wanted me
to copy some clip.

1098
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:37,787
- What was it?
- She wouldn't let me see.

1099
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:41,041
She was going to give it
to you to hold for her...

1100
01:15:41,124 --> 01:15:42,625
like insurance or something.

1101
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:45,170
- She never gave me a tape.
- Think back to what she said.

1102
01:15:45,253 --> 01:15:47,589
She came in crying.

1103
01:15:47,672 --> 01:15:49,049
She wanted to go to my car.

1104
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:52,010
Can we go to your car?
You have to see something.

1105
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:54,179
- Something about my car.
- In your car.

1106
01:16:08,234 --> 01:16:10,278
That's a handy little
attitude adjuster.

1107
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,460
Damn. I'm boxed in.

1108
01:16:49,234 --> 01:16:50,735
What's it say?

1109
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:51,945
Nothing.

1110
01:16:52,862 --> 01:16:54,114
Let's go play this back.

1111
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:01,121
Give us the tape right now.

1112
01:17:01,204 --> 01:17:03,248
I just want to get my car back.
The place is closed.

1113
01:17:03,331 --> 01:17:04,916
Shut the fuck up.

1114
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,335
Aah! Give him the tape.

1115
01:17:07,377 --> 01:17:08,920
It's in my case.

1116
01:17:10,171 --> 01:17:11,381
I'm going to open my case.

1117
01:17:12,048 --> 01:17:14,009
Facing us, so we can see it.

1118
01:17:27,564 --> 01:17:29,607
Take it and turn her loose, OK?

1119
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:31,985
Yeah. Absolutely.

1120
01:17:59,637 --> 01:18:02,182
"Oh, no.
We're not being followed, Lenny.

1121
01:18:02,265 --> 01:18:04,476
"Don't be so paranoid, Lenny."

1122
01:18:36,549 --> 01:18:38,301
Oh, shit!

1123
01:18:38,385 --> 01:18:40,345
Take it easy.
The glass is bullet-resistant.

1124
01:18:40,428 --> 01:18:42,931
Bullet-resistant?
What happened to bulletproof?

1125
01:18:44,724 --> 01:18:46,059
Shit!

1126
01:18:46,142 --> 01:18:48,353
Calm down, baby.
This is what I do.

1127
01:18:54,484 --> 01:18:55,610
Hang on!

1128
01:19:23,763 --> 01:19:25,015
Oh, Christ.
