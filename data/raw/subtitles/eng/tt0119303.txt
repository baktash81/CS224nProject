1
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:03,812
Ten million dollars
for the missile chip.

2
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:06,217
Not a plan...

3
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:08,318
...but the chip itself.

4
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,713
Why the big price?

5
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:15,750
My clients have requested it.

6
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:18,792
I honor my clients' requests.

7
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:20,656
Sounds like your clients...

8
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:24,562
...want to build a missile
that can't be detected by radar.

9
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,434
I don't ask questions, Mr. Beaupre.

10
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,941
But whoever possesses this chip
could dominate the entire region.

11
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,658
- Good night, George.
- Good night, Mr. Cooper.

12
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:30,196
- He's clean.
- Here.

13
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,805
That's what you asked for.

14
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,373
Air Force NSB-100, C series.

15
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:41,909
If that goes in a missile,
air defenses can't stop it.

16
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,714
Look, I got a plane to catch.

17
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:49,251
Where's my money?

18
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:01,158
Here.

19
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,230
Hide it in the toy car.

20
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:07,098
We'll slip it right past
airport security.

21
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:17,178
Let's go.

22
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:50,976
<i>Welcome to San Francisco
International Airport.</i>

23
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:54,043
<i>Do not leave your bags unattended.</i>

24
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:09,666
Please remove your jewelry.

25
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:17,905
Let's go.

26
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:21,111
Ma'am, you have to wait.

27
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:29,253
Thank you.

28
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:34,819
Next, please.

29
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:56,643
Oh, my God.

30
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:31,046
Move. Move!

31
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:33,909
Young man!

32
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:43,655
The Dallas, Miami, New York
and Denver lounges. Nothing.

33
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:46,227
Bars, restaurants, club lounge, clean.

34
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:49,932
When I was in the john,
I didn't see anything in there.

35
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:53,165
It has to be on a plane.

36
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,541
We are going to Chicago.

37
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,539
In the winter?

38
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:08,345
I packed tropical.

39
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:13,919
<i>Welcome to Chicago,
where it's 29 degrees outside.</i>

40
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:20,194
Welcome to Chicago.

41
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:21,690
Bye-bye.

42
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,598
Here you go, sir.

43
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,708
Mr. Beaupre!

44
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:38,815
Mr. Unger, Mr. Jernigan.

45
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,649
Excuse me.

46
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,980
- Out of my way.
- Move.

47
00:06:43,922 --> 00:06:47,289
- Did you check any bags, ma'am?
- No. Floor it!

48
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:05,903
She's leaving.

49
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,013
That's him.

50
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,521
Excuse me, pop.
Can I ask you something?

51
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:58,696
What?

52
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:02,798
You had a fare from the airport
around 1620 hours, January 8.

53
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:05,559
Senior citizen, female, Caucasian.

54
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:08,397
- What?
- About 4:30 today. Old broad.

55
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,835
- Oh, yeah.
- You got an address on that?

56
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,542
North Devon Park, Washington Street.

57
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:16,973
Describe the house, please.

58
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:18,682
Big, old...

59
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,744
<i>... Tudor-like place.</i>

60
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:24,216
- Details.
- Christmas lights, wreath on the door.

61
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:27,323
Christmas tree by the driveway,
and the driveway...

62
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,720
...was the only one
on the block not shoveled.

63
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,414
I'm done, Mrs. Hess.
I'm exhausted and sweaty...

64
00:08:51,683 --> 00:08:53,913
...but you can't see
because I'm covered up.

65
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:56,846
You were to deal
with the snow promptly.

66
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:59,386
- Yes, but...
- "Buts" are for ashtrays.

67
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:04,751
I don't care for excuses. We had
an understanding and you broke it.

68
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:08,363
- Your word is worthless.
- Sorry. That'll be no charge.

69
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:12,232
So you can tell the neighbors
I stiffed you on a job?

70
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:21,645
Is this a loaf of the famous
San Francisco sourdough bread?

71
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:25,110
This won't make
a very tasty sandwich, will it?

72
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,780
Because of some silly,
inconsiderate boob who took my bag...

73
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,989
...I left my bread in San Francisco!

74
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,752
Pardon me, Mrs. Hess,
but I think I'm almost, maybe...

75
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,124
...possibly, probably
gonna be late for my dinner.

76
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,129
Consider this your payment.
I have no use for it.

77
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:46,630
Thank you.

78
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:48,838
And have your mother teach you...

79
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:52,440
...that it is rude to scratch
yourself in front of a lady.

80
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:58,779
Good night, Alex.

81
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:00,948
Jeez.

82
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,116
What a grouch.

83
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:36,381
They're all old...

84
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:38,816
...most of them are Tudor...

85
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,217
...all have wreaths
and Christmas trees...

86
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,824
...and the snow's all shoveled.

87
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,858
There are 14 houses.

88
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,321
The toy car must be in one of them.

89
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,733
We'll have to search them all.

90
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:54,900
- We'll come back when it's light.
- We're gonna work in daylight?

91
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:57,967
It's the suburbs, Mr. Unger.

92
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:01,307
Nobody's home during the day.

93
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:18,392
There you go, Speedy.

94
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:53,895
Charlie, I told you last year,
and I'm telling you now...

95
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:55,622
...I can't work weekends.

96
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:58,631
<i>- Why not?
- I've got three kids and a husband.</i>

97
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:01,029
That's Mary Lou. She has no life.

98
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:04,402
It means nothing to her
to work weekends, but I can't.

99
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:07,611
My house is half-renovated.
My kids have activities.

100
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,315
They need to see us doing more
than running to the car.

101
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:15,950
I can't explain over the phone why
we're so excited about this product.

102
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,485
I'll be in Cleveland on Wednesday.

103
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:22,250
Yeah, Wednesday. We'll talk
about it then. Face to face.

104
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,484
Yeah, man to man.

105
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:02,295
Your brother's bug!

106
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,365
Careful! Careful!

107
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,860
Bull's-eye!

108
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:12,933
Three from downtown.

109
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:15,039
And the crowd goes wild.

110
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:27,518
Oh, man.

111
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:31,355
I hope they're not...

112
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,469
Alex slammed the seat
down on his thing again!

113
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,033
Bull's-eye.

114
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,366
Alex, what happened?

115
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,873
I had nothing to do with it.
I'm innocent!

116
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:50,445
I gotta go. My kid slammed
the seat on his thing again.

117
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,081
I'll call you back.

118
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,045
Alex?

119
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:57,544
Keep that in your mouth.

120
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,749
Chickenpox.

121
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:03,187
With all due respect...

122
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:07,124
...this is to get out of his science
project because his bug died.

123
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:08,229
What?

124
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,697
- His face doesn't look that bad.
- His body's covered.

125
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:15,065
- Would that include his buttocks?
- Shut up!

126
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,900
This is great. If he scratches
his spots, we can call him scar-butt.

127
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,506
- Leave.
- Goodbye.

128
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,116
- I'll make you some soup.
- I'll bring the TV up.

129
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:29,216
I'm so sorry.

130
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,354
Hey. Don't scratch.

131
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:34,023
Keep that under your tongue.
I'll be back.

132
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,625
Nice family. Huh, Doris?

133
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:50,069
- You guys should get going.
- See you later, Dad.

134
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:09,718
Greenfield's 401 k is in the Effa fund.

135
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:14,091
You have it in the Midcap fund.
That's where your 3000 shortfall is.

136
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,629
I have to put you on hold one sec.

137
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,964
Alex, I'm on with the office!

138
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:25,136
So I think that what we...

139
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:28,845
I'm sorry.
Can I call you back in a minute?

140
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:42,820
Gotcha.

141
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:44,855
You rang?

142
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:56,435
Thirsty?

143
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,937
Thanks, Mom.

144
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,510
- Here we are.
- I wish my husband could be here.

145
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:11,277
It's a cozy little place.

146
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,514
Isn't this charming!

147
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,453
And it's available immediately.

148
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:20,159
My boys are just gonna love it here.

149
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:22,792
Yes, they will.

150
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,412
<i>Plus, special care and feeding tips,
next on Pets on Parade.</i>

151
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:45,819
Look, Doris.

152
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,724
If you think that was amusing,
wait till you see what I do next.

153
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,409
Oh, yeah.

154
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:31,317
- Sit!
- I can't wait for next week.

155
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:34,294
I hate dogs.

156
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:37,831
Charlie, you know I can't come in.
Alex is sick.

157
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:40,127
<i>Melling's reviewing the proposal.</i>

158
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:41,599
<i>- You're kidding.
- No.</i>

159
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,501
<i>- How long's he in town?
- He's leaving Friday.</i>

160
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:47,003
<i>- We can't cancel.
- It's okay.</i>

161
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:50,213
<i>- Mary Lou can handle it.
- She's not who he expects to see.</i>

162
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:53,881
<i>You're the point person.
You told me you'd handle it.</i>

163
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:57,053
I did, but my child wasn't sick
when I promised you...

164
00:18:57,354 --> 00:18:59,515
<i>Not my fault you can't find a sitter.</i>

165
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,021
Okay, I can come in for one hour.
That is it.

166
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:06,387
If Alex beeps me, I'm gone
and you can fire me.

167
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,619
<i>Karen...</i>

168
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:12,700
Charlie, you're making me choose
between making a house payment...

169
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:16,999
...and taking care of my sick child
and I don't appreciate it.

170
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,504
Jerk.

171
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,977
You tell Charlie I'm desperately ill?

172
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:28,474
Thank you, Alex.

173
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:30,848
Yes, he knows you're sick.

174
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:34,082
What about the Family Leave Act?

175
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:36,088
I just have to go in...

176
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,658
...sign some papers and show my face.

177
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:41,524
I'll be gone an hour at the very most.

178
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,494
I called Mrs. Hess and...

179
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:46,662
You called Mrs. Hess?
She knows I'll be alone?

180
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,033
She said if anything comes up,
she'll be right over.

181
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:54,836
- She wasn't happy about it...
- She'll come over and make me smoke.

182
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:58,273
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What if there's a tornado?

183
00:19:58,582 --> 00:19:59,776
Not in winter.

184
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:02,349
- Social unrest?
- I don't think so.

185
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,951
Boredom? It's deadly in old folks.

186
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:07,019
Goodbye, sweetie.

187
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,923
What about crooks?

188
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:15,796
That's not a problem during the day.

189
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,330
Why not?
No one's home during the day.

190
00:20:18,535 --> 00:20:20,628
I'm 8 and I figured that out.

191
00:20:20,904 --> 00:20:23,702
Couldn't a grown-up crook
figure it out too?

192
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:28,936
This is a very safe neighborhood.
There's only one road in and out.

193
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,876
The doors'll be locked,
you have my numbers.

194
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:33,879
- I'll be home soon.
- But, Mom!

195
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:37,751
What about dragons, giant spiders,
mummies, the living dead...

196
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,979
...and other figments
of my imagination?

197
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,157
Alex, I can't help you there.

198
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,258
Only you can control your imagination.

199
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,062
That's a scary thought.

200
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:38,068
That's weird.

201
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:47,006
Oh, my God.

202
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,388
20 seconds out.

203
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:01,462
Clear.

204
00:23:07,437 --> 00:23:08,699
911 Emergency.

205
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:11,567
- I saw a burglar!
- Are you by yourself?

206
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:15,240
My mom had to leave.
I have the chickenpox.

207
00:23:15,546 --> 00:23:17,036
Can I have your address?

208
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:19,715
He's not at my house!
He's at the Stephans'!

209
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:22,647
Their address is
3015 Washington Street!

210
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:56,846
Nothing.

211
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,173
Burglar at the Stephans'!
I saw him with my telescope!

212
00:24:23,447 --> 00:24:26,541
There's a woman with a dog
and a gray van!

213
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:30,514
I didn't recognize anyone, but
the dog looked like Johnny Allen's...

214
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,279
...so I called the police.

215
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:34,320
You called the police?

216
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:56,338
Freeze!

217
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,157
The burglar alarm was on and working.

218
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,094
There was no one in the house.

219
00:25:18,402 --> 00:25:20,563
Doesn't appear that
anything's been taken.

220
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:24,337
I don't know what he saw
but it wasn't a person.

221
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,043
I'm sorry about this.

222
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:32,408
My son's been home with chickenpox
and I had to run to work.

223
00:25:32,683 --> 00:25:35,049
I'm strapped.
I don't normally do this.

224
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:39,450
Son, false alarms are
no joking matter.

225
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,748
It wasn't!

226
00:25:41,024 --> 00:25:45,188
The guy in the house had two lookouts
and a driver in a gray van.

227
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:47,260
He's been running a fever.

228
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:50,232
Ours is a serious business.

229
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:54,062
Oh, he knows. We gave him
a police set for Christmas...

230
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:58,570
Not this one, but last. You know,
one with a badge, a hat and a whistle.

231
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:03,143
He took it very seriously. He
arrested relatives for various crimes.

232
00:26:03,413 --> 00:26:08,476
Not real crimes, but for leaving
the toilet seat up and snoring and...

233
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:10,314
Absolutely.

234
00:26:10,587 --> 00:26:12,214
I will, yes. Thank you.

235
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:13,719
Thank you.

236
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,064
You get in that bed.

237
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,064
Excuse me, I saw a man
in Karen Stephans' bedroom.

238
00:26:27,304 --> 00:26:31,900
A white male a little older than Dad,
wearing butt inspection gloves.

239
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:34,637
I warned you about that telescope.

240
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:38,679
Look long enough and you'll see
things, whether or not they're there.

241
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:42,110
I guess you have to be 35
before anyone listens to you.

242
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,255
Don't get smart with me.
Sick or not, I'm very angry with you.

243
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,617
You caused a lot of trouble today.

244
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,987
We have to replace a door.
You think we're happy about it?

245
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:53,828
I saw what I saw.

246
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:03,966
Peter Beaupre...

247
00:27:04,808 --> 00:27:06,275
...Earl Unger...

248
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,273
...Burton Jernigan...

249
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:09,774
...and Alice Rivens.

250
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:15,141
They were ticketed under aliases
but didn't board the Hong Kong flight.

251
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:19,287
I believe they're still in the U.S.,
but beyond that, I don't know.

252
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:22,955
Ladies and gentlemen...

253
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:25,354
...we've got to find that chip.

254
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:30,827
<i>What went wrong
with the burglar alarm?</i>

255
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:34,797
- Nothing. It wasn't the alarm.
- Then who called the police?

256
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:37,698
Mr. Jernigan, care to speculate?

257
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,070
Cars came and went.
The mailman came by.

258
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:45,474
We could have a watcher on any house.
It could be anybody.

259
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:50,015
I don't think it's just anybody.
I think it's someone on our street.

260
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:53,347
Someone we are not tracking.

261
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,888
Someone we've missed.

262
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:07,336
Dad, cab's here.

263
00:28:07,537 --> 00:28:08,765
Oh, shoot.

264
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:11,064
Mom's not back yet.

265
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:13,265
Well, all right.

266
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:16,338
Mom took some documents to the bank.

267
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,741
She can't be gone
more than a few minutes.

268
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,243
Mrs. Hess is home. You'll be fine.

269
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,214
My beeper's on speed dial.

270
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:27,117
- Second button. Mom's is the first.
- Right.

271
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,585
- So, you're okay?
- Positively.

272
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,525
Give me a kiss.

273
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:34,791
Dad.

274
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,068
This is a safe neighborhood.

275
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,300
We have great police,
as you learned yesterday.

276
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:45,598
Nothing bad will happen to you.

277
00:28:45,876 --> 00:28:47,241
- Dad?
- Yeah?

278
00:28:47,444 --> 00:28:48,775
- Got your tickets?
- Yep.

279
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,739
- Got your wallet?
- It's in my pocket.

280
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:53,609
Where's your pocket?

281
00:28:58,622 --> 00:28:59,884
Yeah.

282
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:02,924
- Thank you.
- Bye, Dad.

283
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,486
She's leaving.

284
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,180
3025 is all clear.

285
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,780
<i>Red sedan heading south.</i>

286
00:30:01,351 --> 00:30:03,683
Turning right. Hold.

287
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,757
- You are just in time, Mr. Pruitt.
- Wait, wait.

288
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:43,720
Oh, no.

289
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:55,529
Yes.

290
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,342
Abort. Abort.

291
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,245
Evacuate the area.

292
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:36,907
Let's go!

293
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:40,640
Move! Move!

294
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,253
Cool!

295
00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:56,493
Check the back.

296
00:32:07,143 --> 00:32:08,405
Nothing.

297
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:10,272
Let's check upstairs.

298
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,677
Where's the burglar?

299
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:20,512
There is no burglar.

300
00:32:20,824 --> 00:32:23,657
Just a kid home sick from school,
making false alarms.

301
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:27,419
How embarrassing.

302
00:32:33,803 --> 00:32:37,637
This is the second time in two days
that you've called the police.

303
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,700
It's a very serious matter
when a person calls the police.

304
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:44,943
I saw a burglar yesterday,
and I saw one today.

305
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:47,483
Alex, listen to the chief.

306
00:32:48,118 --> 00:32:51,679
- There was no one in that house.
- What about Johnny Allen's dog?

307
00:32:51,955 --> 00:32:56,289
I talked to Johnny last night.
His dog was kidnapped Monday morning.

308
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:58,154
Did he see it happen?

309
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:01,625
Alex, apologize to the chief
and go up to your room.

310
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,791
Excuse me for being a good citizen.

311
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:09,335
Alex! I'm very sorry.

312
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,164
This will not happen again.

313
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:14,337
Will it, honey?
Really, I promise you.

314
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:17,637
We wouldn't want to discourage him
from calling us...

315
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:21,078
...in the event that
something real ever does happen.

316
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:26,181
Loser.

317
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:28,516
- Shut up.
- Make me.

318
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:31,521
You pranked them twice.
It's on your permanent record.

319
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:35,058
For your whole life,
if you call for help, it won't come.

320
00:33:35,365 --> 00:33:38,732
- Dad missed his plane.
- He was late to meet his boss.

321
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:41,233
We have to give family cash
to the Stephans...

322
00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:44,769
...and to an evil octogenarian
to repair their doors.

323
00:33:45,408 --> 00:33:47,035
And even worse...

324
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:48,835
The world laughs.

325
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:51,410
You've stained the family name.

326
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:00,519
First the Stephans.

327
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,121
Then Mrs. Hess.

328
00:34:02,358 --> 00:34:06,419
I agree, Doris.
The next stop is the Alcotts' house.

329
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:09,893
What burglar goes into a house
and doesn't take anything?

330
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,958
You know what I think?
They're looking for something special.

331
00:34:14,237 --> 00:34:18,765
And they're looking in every house
because they don't know who has it.

332
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,136
The question is...

333
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:22,944
...what is it?

334
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,883
If nobody's gonna
do anything about this...

335
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,220
...I'll just have to do it myself.

336
00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:01,607
I am so sorry.
I'm clearly not awake.

337
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,610
It's all right.

338
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:05,812
Have a nice day.

339
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:07,954
I'll try.

340
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:01,738
Watch this.

341
00:37:16,753 --> 00:37:18,311
Look, Doris.

342
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:42,139
I forgot about the stairs.

343
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:29,620
Got him, Doris. Got him.

344
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:32,726
Yes, yes, yes!

345
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:35,964
You are so busted.

346
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:42,868
I have it.

347
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:46,408
The toy car. It's videotaping me.

348
00:38:50,346 --> 00:38:51,574
Come back on that.

349
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:04,550
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

350
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:08,857
Don't spin!

351
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,016
<i>You there!</i>

352
00:39:37,226 --> 00:39:39,558
<i>You was friendly.
I don't have to kill you.</i>

353
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:42,059
<i>You got money that
doesn't belong to you.</i>

354
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:10,316
Hello, this is Karen.
Hi, how's it going?

355
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:13,660
<i>I'm running late
for the office again.</i>

356
00:40:13,896 --> 00:40:17,127
<i>I think blue chips
are overvalued.</i>

357
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,265
<i>Technology stocks are good.</i>

358
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:23,131
<i>I'm in the shower.
Can I call you back?</i>

359
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:29,236
<i>Bad, bad Leroy Brown</i>

360
00:40:29,478 --> 00:40:32,914
<i>Baddest cat in the whole damn town</i>

361
00:40:33,616 --> 00:40:36,107
<i>Badder than old King Kong</i>

362
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:38,620
<i>Meaner than a junkyard dog</i>

363
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,085
Come on, come on.

364
00:40:44,994 --> 00:40:46,484
See you!

365
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:03,008
The car's outside.
I got the woman here. Get over here!

366
00:41:12,822 --> 00:41:14,221
Come on, get up!

367
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,795
Everybody's in a hurry.

368
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:58,860
It's a camera.
Someone's onto us.

369
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:03,595
Think it matters? Chip's in the car.
We're at the airport in 45 minutes.

370
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,704
Where is Alice?

371
00:42:07,843 --> 00:42:08,935
What happened?

372
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:11,909
There is a woman in the house.
I'll deal with her.

373
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:13,580
Get the chip.

374
00:42:32,668 --> 00:42:34,067
I got it.

375
00:42:43,045 --> 00:42:44,239
Ma'am?

376
00:42:45,348 --> 00:42:46,747
May I have a word with you?

377
00:42:47,016 --> 00:42:49,075
Don't come in. I'm naked.

378
00:42:51,187 --> 00:42:53,087
<i>What's on your mind, monkey butt?</i>

379
00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:58,424
Come on.

380
00:43:03,632 --> 00:43:05,964
<i>What's that funky smell?</i>

381
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:09,929
I lost it.

382
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:11,436
What?!

383
00:43:17,747 --> 00:43:18,975
Come on, go, go, go!

384
00:43:25,388 --> 00:43:26,446
It's out of range!

385
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,880
I got it.

386
00:43:54,784 --> 00:43:55,614
I see it.

387
00:44:01,857 --> 00:44:03,119
Look out.

388
00:44:14,603 --> 00:44:16,093
Jernigan, which direction?

389
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:20,840
It got past me.
It's heading south on Adams.

390
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,340
I'm right behind the little...

391
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:34,049
It's off the street,
going through back yards...

392
00:44:34,323 --> 00:44:36,052
...heading west.

393
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:38,017
Alice, what's your position?

394
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:43,458
Fourth house. Moving to the alley.

395
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:00,816
It's going through the hedge.

396
00:45:01,183 --> 00:45:02,514
Jernigan, position.

397
00:45:02,885 --> 00:45:03,749
You're there.

398
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:07,588
- I got it!
- I got it!

399
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:20,596
Unger. What's your position?

400
00:45:20,903 --> 00:45:23,167
Heading down Washington Street.

401
00:45:23,672 --> 00:45:25,503
I didn't copy. Where?

402
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:27,333
I said, I'm heading to Wa...

403
00:45:33,449 --> 00:45:35,007
Stop, you nitwit!

404
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:09,948
I don't see anything.

405
00:46:22,064 --> 00:46:23,463
I'll look around.

406
00:46:52,661 --> 00:46:54,026
I don't have it yet.

407
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:58,457
We're out of time. Give it up.

408
00:47:29,365 --> 00:47:32,801
They got the tape.
Why'd they still chase the toy car?

409
00:47:34,203 --> 00:47:36,364
It's not that expensive.

410
00:47:36,572 --> 00:47:39,564
I'm sure they don't have
enough time to play with it.

411
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:07,730
Look, Doris.

412
00:48:13,876 --> 00:48:16,367
Computer chip, huh?
Where'd you find it?

413
00:48:16,612 --> 00:48:20,605
In a remote-control car I got
for shoveling snow for Mrs. Hess.

414
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:22,544
She lives across the street.

415
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:24,252
It says U.S. Air Force...

416
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:27,581
...but you have to look
under a magnifying glass to see.

417
00:48:28,023 --> 00:48:32,016
Kid, a lot of toys have
"Air Force" written on it.

418
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:35,424
This is a recruiting office.
We don't handle this.

419
00:48:36,465 --> 00:48:39,525
Can I give you the chip number
to give to the right guys?

420
00:48:44,707 --> 00:48:47,369
You think we should tell Mom
about the chip?

421
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,743
I guess you're right.
The less they know, the better.

422
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,039
Those guys are bad news.

423
00:49:01,256 --> 00:49:05,454
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
you hitting me with the van.

424
00:49:05,661 --> 00:49:08,221
Never let emotions
get the best of you.

425
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,996
You should have been more vigilant.

426
00:49:11,266 --> 00:49:13,632
You should have taken driver's ed.

427
00:49:13,902 --> 00:49:15,733
It's a kid. It has to be a kid.

428
00:49:15,938 --> 00:49:20,966
I'm gonna have bad knees when I'm old.
I'll have Jernigan to thank.

429
00:49:21,243 --> 00:49:23,438
The cops come,
they don't believe him...

430
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:25,670
...he takes matters
into his own hands.

431
00:49:25,914 --> 00:49:27,506
It can't be anything else.

432
00:49:27,816 --> 00:49:30,979
If that's the case,
I say take no chances.

433
00:49:31,186 --> 00:49:34,587
Tomorrow, whack every kid
in the neighborhood. Burn them.

434
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:36,685
Then look for that stupid car.

435
00:49:37,459 --> 00:49:40,519
My thoughts keep turning
to number 3026.

436
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,696
It's within the operating radius
of the toy car.

437
00:49:43,932 --> 00:49:46,366
It's in sight of all the houses.

438
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,681
<i>- Hello?
- Do you have the missile chip?</i>

439
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,044
We are close.

440
00:50:06,455 --> 00:50:10,016
If I don't have the chip
in 24 hours, Mr. Beaupre...

441
00:50:10,292 --> 00:50:12,692
...I will have
to terminate the mission...

442
00:50:12,895 --> 00:50:15,386
...and nullify all the participants.

443
00:50:15,731 --> 00:50:18,063
You understand, don't you?

444
00:50:19,835 --> 00:50:20,859
Dad's home tomorrow.

445
00:50:21,637 --> 00:50:24,868
I have my meeting from 12 till 5,
so I need you and Molly...

446
00:50:25,174 --> 00:50:27,836
...to come straight home
to stay with Alex.

447
00:50:28,043 --> 00:50:30,978
I can't. Impossible.
I have gymnastics.

448
00:50:31,213 --> 00:50:33,306
- I have hockey.
- Do I need to repeat myself?

449
00:50:33,749 --> 00:50:35,842
I thought you were getting Mrs. Hess.

450
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:38,884
She's a lot more responsible
than me and Stan.

451
00:50:39,154 --> 00:50:41,179
Mrs. Hess is a backup.

452
00:50:41,423 --> 00:50:44,517
Unless it's an emergency,
I don't want to call her.

453
00:50:44,893 --> 00:50:46,190
I'll be fine alone.

454
00:50:46,995 --> 00:50:48,656
There you have it. Settled.

455
00:50:49,231 --> 00:50:51,256
Could you pass me the false alarms?

456
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,365
Sorry, I meant the peas.

457
00:50:55,404 --> 00:50:56,666
Hello?

458
00:51:00,509 --> 00:51:02,807
He's been home with the chickenpox.

459
00:51:04,213 --> 00:51:06,238
Alex, do you know a Bradley Clovis?

460
00:51:06,682 --> 00:51:07,512
Yeah.

461
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:10,579
It's his mom.
Did you take a toy car from him?

462
00:51:13,689 --> 00:51:17,386
He has one of those cars,
but he got it from a neighbor.

463
00:51:20,696 --> 00:51:22,061
We have it.

464
00:51:23,398 --> 00:51:26,265
What is the matter?
You don't disconnect my calls.

465
00:51:26,635 --> 00:51:28,364
Don't talk to her.

466
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:30,629
- Why not?
- She's dangerous.

467
00:51:30,906 --> 00:51:32,771
- What are you talking about?
- Lies.

468
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:35,771
They're all lies. It wasn't her.

469
00:51:35,978 --> 00:51:37,912
What do you mean, it wasn't her?

470
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:46,949
Call her, you'll be surprised.

471
00:51:56,131 --> 00:51:57,257
Outgoing call.

472
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:03,230
Rerouted.

473
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,471
Hello, Clovis'.

474
00:52:06,675 --> 00:52:10,008
<i>- I beg your pardon. We just...
- I'm sorry.</i>

475
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:12,804
Did I disconnect you, Karen?

476
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:17,347
No, it was me. We're renovating,
the phone lines are a mess.

477
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:20,144
They intercepted the phone call.

478
00:52:20,422 --> 00:52:23,414
Listen, I didn't mean
to accuse your son.

479
00:52:23,659 --> 00:52:27,493
I'm certain Bradley
just misplaced his toy car.

480
00:52:27,763 --> 00:52:31,096
Kids. They lose something
and assume it's been stolen.

481
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:35,999
Little boys do have
wild imaginations, don't they?

482
00:52:37,306 --> 00:52:39,206
Yes, they do.

483
00:52:47,316 --> 00:52:51,719
They're gonna come after me tomorrow,
Doris. Nobody will listen.

484
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:55,553
Not my parents or Molly or Stan...

485
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:59,488
...or the police
or the Air Force. Nobody.

486
00:53:00,228 --> 00:53:01,627
So, what do I do?

487
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:05,862
If that means hide, you're wrong.

488
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:11,336
If that means fight, you're right.

489
00:53:14,209 --> 00:53:18,009
They'll understand when I'm done,
and know I was telling the truth.

490
00:53:18,246 --> 00:53:20,646
I'm not gonna feel sad or scared.

491
00:53:20,882 --> 00:53:22,713
They're grown-up criminals...

492
00:53:22,985 --> 00:53:26,386
...but this is my neighborhood
and this is my house.

493
00:53:26,688 --> 00:53:30,021
No matter how old they are,
no matter how big they are...

494
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:34,058
...they can't beat me here.
They can't beat me at home.

495
00:54:10,866 --> 00:54:14,393
Want to buy a little silence?
Double or nothing.

496
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,311
<i>We're watching a major storm
bearing down on Chicago.</i>

497
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:11,081
<i>On the radar, you can see
the snow is increasing in intensity.</i>

498
00:55:11,293 --> 00:55:12,760
<i>Heavy snow is forecasted.</i>

499
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:16,419
<i>Residents are urged
to stay indoors if possible.</i>

500
00:55:42,724 --> 00:55:44,555
Approaching target.

501
00:55:44,793 --> 00:55:45,817
All clear.

502
00:55:53,034 --> 00:55:55,025
Here we go, Doris.

503
00:56:08,984 --> 00:56:11,544
First, we free the hostages.

504
00:56:12,154 --> 00:56:14,349
<i>Switching on the fiber optics.</i>

505
00:56:32,574 --> 00:56:34,371
Alex, can you get the door?

506
00:56:39,347 --> 00:56:40,746
No answer.

507
00:56:50,025 --> 00:56:52,220
Are we certain target has not left?

508
00:56:53,962 --> 00:56:55,293
We would've seen.

509
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:10,473
I repeat, there is no movement inside.

510
00:57:10,712 --> 00:57:12,236
Permission to enter.

511
00:57:30,265 --> 00:57:31,323
Alice?

512
00:57:37,272 --> 00:57:39,740
Hey. Go home. Go home.

513
00:57:56,258 --> 00:57:58,920
<i>I need assistance. I'm exposed.</i>

514
00:57:59,194 --> 00:58:01,458
Maintain your position.

515
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:05,791
<i>Do not, I repeat, do not
draw attention to yourself.</i>

516
00:58:09,004 --> 00:58:10,403
Pick her up.

517
00:58:10,605 --> 00:58:15,440
We'll move in after the storm hits,
let Mother Nature cover our tracks.

518
00:58:16,611 --> 00:58:19,171
This just came in from the Air Force.

519
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:22,976
Some kid named Pruitt called
the recruiting office in Chicago.

520
00:58:23,184 --> 00:58:26,210
Said he found a computer chip
in a toy car.

521
00:58:27,622 --> 00:58:29,021
We're going to Chicago.

522
00:58:33,828 --> 00:58:35,352
Did you watch the weather?

523
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:38,895
- No problems. Your coat's there.
- I want to wear my brown one.

524
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:40,396
Wait!

525
00:58:40,669 --> 00:58:45,299
Go fill your commuter cup with coffee
and I'll get your coat for you.

526
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:47,304
Thanks, hon.

527
00:58:47,709 --> 00:58:49,574
I'll make you a sandwich.

528
00:59:05,894 --> 00:59:08,362
- Here's your coat.
- Thanks.

529
00:59:09,264 --> 00:59:11,596
Sweetheart, I'm sorry about this week.

530
00:59:11,866 --> 00:59:15,768
It breaks my heart to have to come
and go. It shouldn't be this way.

531
00:59:16,037 --> 00:59:19,268
It's okay. It's not you.
It's the times.

532
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:21,006
Thanks, hon.

533
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,002
You have your beeper?

534
00:59:24,512 --> 00:59:27,948
Great. I'll call every half-hour.

535
00:59:28,283 --> 00:59:31,116
I'll go online and keep
the connection open all day.

536
00:59:31,786 --> 00:59:34,448
I'll have my laptop
in all my meetings.

537
00:59:34,723 --> 00:59:36,520
We'll be in contact at all times.

538
00:59:36,725 --> 00:59:39,285
I have my cellular.
You've got my fax number.

539
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:41,119
We're wired.

540
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:45,328
Oh, my gosh. Did Mrs. Clovis call?

541
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:50,027
She was gonna stop by to confirm
that Bradley's name wasn't on the car.

542
00:59:50,572 --> 00:59:52,563
She did when you were in the shower.

543
00:59:52,774 --> 00:59:54,537
- You let her have it?
- Bigtime.

544
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:58,473
- I hope she felt foolish.
- It was painful.

545
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,110
Okay. Be good.

546
01:00:01,316 --> 01:00:04,080
Be safe.
Keep an eye on the old place.

547
01:00:04,753 --> 01:00:06,118
I got it all covered.

548
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:53,495
Here we go.

549
01:00:54,536 --> 01:00:56,197
It's just you and me.

550
01:00:57,205 --> 01:00:58,832
You mean there's someone else?

551
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:03,076
Get ready to rumble!
Play ball!

552
01:01:58,066 --> 01:01:59,397
The old switcheroo.

553
01:02:07,575 --> 01:02:10,203
- Come on.
- It's showtime!

554
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:15,613
If those are real, I'm an eagle.

555
01:02:19,454 --> 01:02:21,046
Block the street.

556
01:02:49,984 --> 01:02:52,111
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, it's Karen Pruitt.</i>

557
01:02:52,387 --> 01:02:54,218
<i>Could you check on Alex?</i>

558
01:02:54,455 --> 01:02:56,286
I'm just going out.

559
01:02:56,558 --> 01:02:58,492
<i>I'm at work and in a bind.</i>

560
01:02:59,727 --> 01:03:01,854
Well, how long?

561
01:03:02,063 --> 01:03:04,759
<i>It wouldn't be for more than an hour.</i>

562
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:06,933
All right. No cooking.

563
01:03:18,346 --> 01:03:20,507
"Call Mrs. Hess.

564
01:03:20,782 --> 01:03:24,274
She's retired, what else
could she possibly be doing?"

565
01:03:25,153 --> 01:03:29,920
Would they invite me to their house
for holiday eggnog? Of course not!

566
01:03:30,158 --> 01:03:31,989
Look who woke up from her nap.

567
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:41,866
Crooks at 30 yards and closing.

568
01:03:43,204 --> 01:03:45,297
Let the party begin.

569
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:49,367
Good afternoon.
We just moved into your neighborhood.

570
01:03:49,677 --> 01:03:51,269
What do you want, a button?

571
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:55,609
A package was to be delivered to us,
but perhaps they brought it here.

572
01:03:55,817 --> 01:03:57,114
Nope, not here.

573
01:03:57,385 --> 01:04:01,913
They said no one answered the door
and the driver left it in the garage.

574
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:22,669
Sometimes they leave stuff
at the back door.

575
01:04:23,544 --> 01:04:25,136
Why are you closing the door?

576
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,074
I left my heart in San Francisco.

577
01:04:33,354 --> 01:04:36,380
It looks like he has the place
locked up pretty tight.

578
01:04:59,614 --> 01:05:02,276
Jernigan, I think
I'm going to enjoy this.

579
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,576
It's been a long time
since I was a kid.

580
01:05:05,887 --> 01:05:08,219
You forget how
incredibly stupid they are.

581
01:05:09,424 --> 01:05:10,755
You be careful.

582
01:05:11,192 --> 01:05:13,956
When kids get scared,
they wet their pants.

583
01:05:49,063 --> 01:05:49,995
Mr. Unger?

584
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,405
I'm all right.

585
01:06:37,178 --> 01:06:39,646
Mr. Unger, what are you doing?

586
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:43,442
Don't touch the yarn. It's wired.

587
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:47,147
Kid's got the place booby-trapped.

588
01:06:47,855 --> 01:06:49,846
Make no assumptions.

589
01:06:50,324 --> 01:06:51,621
Watch the mat.

590
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,890
This boy is clever.
Have you tried the door?

591
01:06:55,163 --> 01:06:56,391
Not yet.

592
01:06:56,697 --> 01:06:59,222
Let me point something out to you.

593
01:07:03,237 --> 01:07:04,465
Missed that.

594
01:07:05,706 --> 01:07:07,298
Stand clear.

595
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:17,015
Maybe he's not so clever.

596
01:07:17,652 --> 01:07:19,711
I think we're just having an off day.

597
01:07:38,606 --> 01:07:40,938
A thought for you to consider:

598
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:45,340
At airport security...

599
01:07:46,013 --> 01:07:48,914
...make sure you have
the right package.

600
01:07:58,259 --> 01:07:59,886
I certainly hope that you're not...

601
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:04,755
...fond of that little boy
across the street.

602
01:08:12,306 --> 01:08:13,705
I'll leave this open.

603
01:08:15,877 --> 01:08:18,311
Fresh air will be good for you.

604
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:32,054
Think you're smart?
You little brat!

605
01:08:35,129 --> 01:08:37,256
Unger, what's your status?

606
01:09:26,213 --> 01:09:27,475
Heads up.

607
01:09:28,449 --> 01:09:30,212
- How'd that happen?
- I don't know.

608
01:09:37,892 --> 01:09:39,382
Ouch.

609
01:09:46,133 --> 01:09:48,033
You got hit with a book?

610
01:09:49,236 --> 01:09:50,669
Books. Plural.

611
01:09:50,972 --> 01:09:53,805
A trunk full of books...

612
01:09:54,308 --> 01:09:57,539
...then a set of weights.
I got hit twice, you dumb broad.

613
01:09:57,812 --> 01:10:01,646
Excuse me, Mr. Unger.
I didn't get taken down by an infant.

614
01:10:02,016 --> 01:10:04,416
We didn't anticipate the defense.

615
01:10:05,052 --> 01:10:06,542
I'll go in the front.

616
01:10:06,754 --> 01:10:09,052
Mr. Unger, you take the north side.

617
01:10:09,557 --> 01:10:11,752
Alice, you take the south side.

618
01:10:12,326 --> 01:10:13,657
Where is Mr. Jernigan?

619
01:10:35,616 --> 01:10:36,913
<i>Attention, travelers.</i>

620
01:10:37,118 --> 01:10:41,578
<i>All flights to Chicago continue
to be delayed due to severe weather.</i>

621
01:10:41,856 --> 01:10:44,256
<i>Please stand by for further details.</i>

622
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:54,760
You can run
but you can't hide, junior.

623
01:11:55,029 --> 01:11:56,326
Surprise.

624
01:12:04,138 --> 01:12:05,264
What a loser.

625
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:15,770
I got him!

626
01:14:36,156 --> 01:14:37,418
You are dead, kid.

627
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:34,206
Now things are looking up.

628
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:37,517
Gotcha!

629
01:15:39,987 --> 01:15:41,011
See you.

630
01:16:05,446 --> 01:16:07,346
Well, well, well.

631
01:16:15,723 --> 01:16:17,281
Nice try, kid.

632
01:17:19,353 --> 01:17:20,149
Alice?

633
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:36,192
I'm coming down.

634
01:18:07,734 --> 01:18:09,463
Mr. Jernigan! Mr. Unger!

635
01:18:10,704 --> 01:18:11,898
Welcome.

636
01:18:12,906 --> 01:18:14,840
You got a haircut?

637
01:18:25,919 --> 01:18:27,511
Are you almost done in there?

638
01:18:28,188 --> 01:18:30,656
Don't start with me.

639
01:18:32,693 --> 01:18:33,990
I'll wait.

640
01:18:51,778 --> 01:18:53,177
Let's move.

641
01:18:54,781 --> 01:18:57,750
- What stinks?
- Shut up.

642
01:19:01,188 --> 01:19:02,018
Hello?

643
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:05,053
<i>You're out of breath.
Something wrong?</i>

644
01:19:05,292 --> 01:19:06,623
No, everything's fine.

645
01:19:07,194 --> 01:19:09,287
I'm so worried.
The weather is terrible.

646
01:19:15,469 --> 01:19:16,697
I'm coming home now.

647
01:19:17,304 --> 01:19:20,705
No, no, take your time, really.
Don't come home, Mom.

648
01:19:20,941 --> 01:19:23,034
Pick up Stan and Molly from school.

649
01:19:23,277 --> 01:19:24,539
<i>Are you sure?</i>

650
01:19:24,811 --> 01:19:27,780
<i>Yeah, I'm playing Chinese checkers
with Mrs. Hess.</i>

651
01:19:28,048 --> 01:19:29,242
<i>You're not smoking?</i>

652
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:33,041
No. I gotta go. Mrs. Hess gets
nutty when you make her wait.

653
01:19:33,287 --> 01:19:34,720
Okay, play fair.

654
01:19:34,988 --> 01:19:36,046
Always.

655
01:19:37,257 --> 01:19:39,657
What a brave little fellow.

656
01:19:48,135 --> 01:19:49,102
Mr. Jernigan.

657
01:19:49,336 --> 01:19:51,770
- Living room clear.
- Good.

658
01:19:54,808 --> 01:19:56,673
Nothing in the kitchen.

659
01:20:03,817 --> 01:20:05,842
Mr. Jernigan, follow me. Slowly.

660
01:20:07,287 --> 01:20:08,845
Go, Doris.

661
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:20,599
Mr. Unger, go ahead.

662
01:20:21,602 --> 01:20:23,866
Cover him, I'll cover the stairs.

663
01:20:28,108 --> 01:20:30,804
I'm coming for you, shorty,
to pay you back...

664
01:20:31,011 --> 01:20:33,878
...for all the misery you caused me.

665
01:20:34,514 --> 01:20:35,845
What are you doing?

666
01:20:36,116 --> 01:20:37,344
Kid's in the closet.

667
01:20:37,651 --> 01:20:40,779
Scaring him a little,
just before I grab him.

668
01:20:44,524 --> 01:20:46,185
And behind door number one!

669
01:20:51,832 --> 01:20:52,890
Towels.

670
01:20:54,334 --> 01:20:55,801
I saw this door close.

671
01:20:56,036 --> 01:20:57,469
Idiot!

672
01:20:57,738 --> 01:20:59,171
Would I make it up?

673
01:20:59,406 --> 01:21:02,432
Why? What's the point?
We working on commission here?

674
01:21:40,914 --> 01:21:41,710
What's going on?

675
01:21:41,948 --> 01:21:44,007
- Mrs. Pruitt from Washington Street?
- Yes?

676
01:21:44,284 --> 01:21:45,683
Agent Stuckey, FBI.

677
01:21:45,919 --> 01:21:47,682
I came to talk to your son.

678
01:21:48,555 --> 01:21:51,683
You called about a computer chip
in a remote-control car?

679
01:21:52,259 --> 01:21:53,055
No.

680
01:21:53,293 --> 01:21:57,787
Oh, God. It's Alex.
It's my other son. What's happened?

681
01:21:58,231 --> 01:21:59,459
He may be in danger.

682
01:22:01,868 --> 01:22:03,631
He's not here. He's at home.

683
01:22:04,204 --> 01:22:05,136
Let's move.

684
01:22:05,372 --> 01:22:07,203
Why is he in danger?

685
01:22:08,642 --> 01:22:10,542
She asked you a question, sir.

686
01:22:12,312 --> 01:22:14,041
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

687
01:22:17,417 --> 01:22:20,716
The "it" you're referring to
is my little brother.

688
01:22:29,229 --> 01:22:31,493
He intercepted
a top-secret electronic device...

689
01:22:31,765 --> 01:22:33,733
...stolen from
a Defense Dept. Contractor...

690
01:22:33,967 --> 01:22:38,427
...by criminals working for
a North Korean terrorist organization.

691
01:22:51,351 --> 01:22:53,410
Mr. Jernigan, come here.

692
01:23:08,702 --> 01:23:12,365
<i>Green-eyed lady, ocean lady</i>

693
01:23:12,606 --> 01:23:16,372
<i>Moving every breaking wave that comes</i>

694
01:23:24,317 --> 01:23:26,080
Go, Doris, go!

695
01:23:39,633 --> 01:23:43,228
<i>Green-eyed lady, ocean lady</i>

696
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:47,338
<i>Moving every breaking wave that comes</i>

697
01:23:47,841 --> 01:23:50,810
<i>Green-eyed lady, lovely lady</i>

698
01:23:51,077 --> 01:23:54,979
<i>Strolling slowly towards the sun</i>

699
01:23:59,019 --> 01:24:00,043
Sorry, Charlie.

700
01:24:02,589 --> 01:24:04,580
This just ain't your day.

701
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:14,191
Shut up.

702
01:24:20,707 --> 01:24:22,436
- What?
- Don't move.

703
01:24:25,378 --> 01:24:26,811
Don't...

704
01:24:27,047 --> 01:24:28,309
...move.

705
01:24:31,051 --> 01:24:32,177
What?

706
01:24:41,862 --> 01:24:43,193
Excellent.

707
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:44,588
Run, shorty, run!

708
01:24:44,798 --> 01:24:45,787
Come on, Doris.

709
01:24:46,366 --> 01:24:47,492
The kid!

710
01:24:47,801 --> 01:24:49,234
Doris, come on!

711
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:51,796
You little brat!

712
01:24:52,005 --> 01:24:53,905
I got him!

713
01:25:09,055 --> 01:25:11,853
You smacked my winkie.

714
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:16,754
If you changed your shorts, maybe
you wouldn't have rats in your pants!

715
01:25:21,268 --> 01:25:22,667
Scraggy little rug rat!

716
01:25:40,053 --> 01:25:41,452
Where is he?

717
01:25:42,055 --> 01:25:43,750
Stay here, Doris.

718
01:25:48,361 --> 01:25:49,589
Yikes.

719
01:26:10,951 --> 01:26:14,785
He's been watching us the whole time.
He had a camera on us.

720
01:26:17,724 --> 01:26:21,888
You won't find me up there, you
big, dumb, law-breaking knuckleheads!

721
01:26:22,162 --> 01:26:23,720
He's outside.

722
01:26:30,003 --> 01:26:32,096
Recognize this?

723
01:26:35,075 --> 01:26:36,736
How'd he get outside?

724
01:26:36,977 --> 01:26:38,740
The same way you will.

725
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:40,837
Jump! Go!

726
01:26:41,081 --> 01:26:41,911
Don't push.

727
01:26:42,182 --> 01:26:44,480
You're jumping onto a trampoline.

728
01:26:44,684 --> 01:26:46,515
I presume you won't be joining us?

729
01:26:46,753 --> 01:26:49,415
- No, I'll be covering you. Go!
- How comforting.

730
01:26:51,691 --> 01:26:53,158
He's getting away!

731
01:26:54,694 --> 01:26:56,025
This is a snap.

732
01:26:56,997 --> 01:26:58,157
This is a snap.

733
01:26:58,365 --> 01:26:59,263
Go!

734
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:21,552
Cold. Very cold.

735
01:27:42,475 --> 01:27:44,306
Of course.

736
01:27:51,017 --> 01:27:54,043
Here I come, you little brat.

737
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,086
Ouch.

738
01:28:09,335 --> 01:28:10,927
Mrs. Hess!

739
01:28:16,242 --> 01:28:18,039
Mrs. Hess.

740
01:28:28,054 --> 01:28:30,887
You're okay. I'm here now.

741
01:29:00,086 --> 01:29:01,519
Well...

742
01:29:02,889 --> 01:29:04,481
...it's Alex, isn't it?

743
01:29:07,494 --> 01:29:09,758
Today you learn something.

744
01:29:09,963 --> 01:29:13,296
There is a price to be paid
for being a good citizen.

745
01:29:13,733 --> 01:29:17,635
In your zeal to aid your neighbor,
you stepped into one of my traps.

746
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:36,914
Can Mrs. Hess go inside?
She's very old and very cold.

747
01:29:41,661 --> 01:29:43,151
Please?

748
01:29:50,937 --> 01:29:52,427
Give me the chip.

749
01:29:52,672 --> 01:29:54,867
It doesn't belong to you.
It's not yours.

750
01:29:58,845 --> 01:30:02,440
The chip, son.
Give me the chip.

751
01:30:03,883 --> 01:30:06,875
- That doesn't belong to you either.
- What?

752
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:08,882
That's not your gun.

753
01:30:13,726 --> 01:30:16,695
This is your gun.

754
01:30:24,904 --> 01:30:26,496
Gotcha!

755
01:30:31,511 --> 01:30:34,639
- Here, sit down, Mrs. Hess.
- Thank you, Alex.

756
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:40,547
These are times that call for soup.
Any favorites?

757
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:43,015
Thank you. I'm fine.

758
01:30:44,424 --> 01:30:45,823
You know, Mrs. Hess...

759
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:50,323
...it's really cold outside.
You're a pretty tough old bird.

760
01:30:52,665 --> 01:30:55,896
And you're a very sweet young man.

761
01:30:57,103 --> 01:30:59,094
I just never took the time to notice.

762
01:30:59,706 --> 01:31:01,765
You're not alone in that.

763
01:31:51,557 --> 01:31:53,457
Johnson, Williams. Go around back.

764
01:31:59,299 --> 01:32:00,493
Freeze!

765
01:32:03,236 --> 01:32:05,067
You gotta be kidding.

766
01:32:11,444 --> 01:32:12,638
Alex.

767
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:18,674
Mom!

768
01:32:40,606 --> 01:32:43,268
You're hugging and kissing me
in front of the cops.

769
01:32:44,711 --> 01:32:46,611
I'm so sorry.

770
01:32:48,114 --> 01:32:50,446
I'm so sorry
I didn't listen to you.

771
01:32:50,817 --> 01:32:53,308
This is very cool.

772
01:32:53,553 --> 01:32:55,384
Bud, you're a hero.

773
01:32:57,223 --> 01:32:59,191
- Are you Alex?
- Yeah.

774
01:32:59,459 --> 01:33:01,256
Agent Stuckey, FBI.

775
01:33:02,495 --> 01:33:04,053
Here's the chip.

776
01:33:05,398 --> 01:33:07,798
There's a senior citizen
across the street...

777
01:33:08,067 --> 01:33:10,865
...who needs some soup
and a doctor to look at her feet.

778
01:33:11,137 --> 01:33:13,799
There's two in our pool
and one in our basement.

779
01:33:14,374 --> 01:33:16,035
The other one's gone.

780
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:23,012
Is this him?

781
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:25,480
Yep.

782
01:33:27,887 --> 01:33:30,651
Seven years, I've been after this guy.

783
01:33:31,591 --> 01:33:33,991
He always manages to slip away.

784
01:33:36,996 --> 01:33:38,258
Thanks.

785
01:33:43,436 --> 01:33:45,597
- It's just the three.
- Where's your boss?

786
01:33:47,273 --> 01:33:50,265
- Get them out of here!
- Yes, sir. Let's go, popsicle.

787
01:33:50,543 --> 01:33:51,908
Come on.

788
01:34:04,557 --> 01:34:07,583
Lucy, I'm home!

789
01:34:08,861 --> 01:34:11,523
What's on your mind, monkey butt?

790
01:34:11,931 --> 01:34:14,126
<i>Bad, bad, Leroy Brown</i>

791
01:34:24,877 --> 01:34:27,778
Houston, we have a problem.

792
01:34:28,314 --> 01:34:29,474
Counting down in...

793
01:34:29,715 --> 01:34:34,379
...five, four, three, two...

794
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:35,609
Take it.

795
01:34:36,155 --> 01:34:37,213
Double or nothing.

796
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:39,787
I only have one.

797
01:34:42,228 --> 01:34:44,219
We have ignition.

798
01:34:48,434 --> 01:34:49,765
It's showtime!

799
01:35:04,584 --> 01:35:07,849
I'll be there in just a minute.
Okay, bye.

800
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,317
It's the Tudor with the Christmas
lights in the driveway...

801
01:35:11,524 --> 01:35:13,515
...that hasn't been shoveled.

802
01:35:13,793 --> 01:35:15,158
That one, right there.

803
01:35:25,972 --> 01:35:27,940
Have you ever had the chickenpox?

804
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:33,077
I had the chickenpox when
Herbert Hoover was in the White House.

805
01:35:33,946 --> 01:35:35,004
Hello.

806
01:35:37,517 --> 01:35:38,643
Dad!

807
01:35:40,186 --> 01:35:42,051
Hey, come here.

808
01:35:46,626 --> 01:35:49,857
Let's see. You don't look
any worse for the wear.

809
01:35:50,062 --> 01:35:51,529
They couldn't touch me.

810
01:35:51,831 --> 01:35:55,198
The computer company with the boosted
chip is giving Alex a reward.

811
01:35:55,401 --> 01:35:58,199
It's a six-figure sum,
which is extremely cool.

812
01:35:59,839 --> 01:36:01,602
So did you bring me anything?

813
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:04,402
As a matter of fact, I did.

814
01:36:05,278 --> 01:36:06,472
Come here.

815
01:36:08,915 --> 01:36:10,405
Think you can drive that?

816
01:36:10,683 --> 01:36:12,878
I think we can handle it.

817
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:15,844
Gentlemen, start your engines.

818
01:36:16,055 --> 01:36:17,716
360! 360!

819
01:36:21,427 --> 01:36:22,689
Rat overboard!

820
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:26,229
Say cheese.
