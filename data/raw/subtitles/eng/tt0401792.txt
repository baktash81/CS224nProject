1
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:36,396
<i>She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.</i>

2
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,101
<i>I let her hear my footsteps.</i>

3
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,411
<i>She only goes stiff for a moment.</i>

4
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,280
Care for a smoke?

5
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:57,150
Sure.
I'll take one.

6
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,784
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

7
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:05,229
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

8
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,798
I've watched you for days.

9
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:14,637
You're everything a man could ever want.

10
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,177
It's not just your face,

11
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:21,840
your figure, or your voice.

12
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,883
It's your eyes.

13
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,621
All the things I see in your eyes.

14
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,294
What is it you see in my eyes?

15
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:43,531
I see a crazy calm.

16
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,274
You're sick of running.

17
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,579
You're ready to face what you have to face.

18
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,539
But you don't want to face it alone.

19
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,585
No.

20
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,846
I don't want to face it alone.

21
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,531
<i>The wind rises electric.</i>

22
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,262
<i>She's soft and warm
and almost weightless.</i>

23
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:19,328
<i>Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes.</i>

24
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,400
<i>I tell her that everything will be all right.</i>

25
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:30,182
<i>That I'll save her from whatever
she's scared of and take her far, far away.</i>

26
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:36,523
<i>I tell her I love her.</i>

27
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,424
<i>The silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot.</i>

28
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,330
<i>I hold her close until she's gone.</i>

29
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,903
<i>I'll never know
what she was running from.</i>

30
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,535
<i>I'll cash her check in the morning.</i>

31
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:56,157
<i>Just one hour to go.
My last day on the job.</i>

32
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,131
<i>Early retirement.
Not my idea.</i>

33
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,135
<i>Doctor's orders.
Heart condition.</i>

34
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:04,898
<i>"Angina," he calls it.</i>

35
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:09,266
<i>I'm polishing my badge and getting myself
used to the idea of saying goodbye to it.</i>

36
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:13,039
<i>It, and the 30-odd years
of protecting and serving and tears</i>

37
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:17,709
<i>and the blood and terror
and triumph it represents.</i>

38
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,915
<i>I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.</i>

39
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:25,789
<i>About the thick, fat steaks
she picked up at the butcher's today.</i>

40
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:29,260
<i>And I'm thinking about
the one loose end I haven't tied up.</i>

41
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,290
<i>A young girl who's out there somewhere,
helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic.</i>

42
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:43,436
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do this.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

43
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,809
You're gonna get us both killed.
I won't let you. I'm warnin' you.

44
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,814
Let go of my coat, Bob.

45
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,873
You're draggin' me down with you.

46
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,387
I'm your partner.
They can kill me, too.

47
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:57,822
I ain't puttin' up with that. I'm gettin'
on the horn and calling for backup.

48
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,325
Sure, Bob.
We'll just wait.

49
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:04,330
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat gets
his sick thrills with victim number four.

50
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,525
Victim number four!

51
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,125
Nancy Callahan, age 11.

52
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,466
And she'll be raped
and slashed to ribbons.

53
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,466
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

54
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:20,013
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy.

55
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,742
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.

56
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,807
Settle down and think straight.

57
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,746
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker.

58
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,814
You ain't savin' anyone.

59
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,691
You got a great attitude, Bob.

60
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,228
Real credit to the force, you are.

61
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,929
Eileen's at home waitin' for you.
Think about Eileen.

62
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,841
Heck, Bob,

63
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:51,869
maybe you are right.

64
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,278
I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense.

65
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,944
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

66
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,681
<i>Hell of a way to start my retirement.</i>

67
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,553
<i>Nancy Callahan, age 11.</i>

68
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,116
<i>For all I know, she's dead already.</i>

69
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,090
You've been a very good girl, Nancy.

70
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,566
You've been very quiet.

71
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,865
Don't be scared.

72
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,097
We're gonna be
taking you home really soon.

73
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:24,201
But first,
we're going to introduce you to somebody.

74
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,576
He's a very nice man.

75
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,784
<i>Halfway to the warehouse where
Weevil said they took her, and it hits.</i>

76
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,413
<i>Icked spot of indigestion.</i>

77
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,889
<i>At least that's what I pray it is.</i>

78
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,290
...lighthearted
and momentary digression.

79
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:43,262
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure.

80
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,460
For cheap thrills.
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb.

81
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:51,971
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers.

82
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,166
<i>Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump -</i>

83
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:58,506
<i>two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs
with delusions of eloquence.</i>

84
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,403
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet -

85
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,144
temporarily remanded
to our custody though it may be -

86
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:07,449
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark.

87
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,786
<i>Gotta keep this quiet.
Take 'em down fast.</i>

88
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,883
A single dent,
the merest scratch thereupon,

89
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,952
and the before-mentioned consequences
of which I so recently made mention

90
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,589
shall surely be athwart us.

91
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:32,134
<i>Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down.</i>

92
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,237
<i>But it won't slow down.</i>

93
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,341
<i>Get over it.</i>

94
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,616
<i>She needs you.</i>

95
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,416
We're all done here, Benny.

96
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:46,016
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

97
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,958
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.

98
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,360
I'm just making sure
they get along really well.

99
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,199
And what kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

100
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,364
You must be awfully scared now.

101
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,840
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

102
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,743
All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk.

103
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:12,649
That's all. Just a nice talk.
Just you and me.

104
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,211
Don't you cry now.

105
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,349
<i>Doctor said it'd be like this.</i>

106
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,757
<i>Just take the pill he gave you.</i>

107
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,796
<i>No need to play it quiet.</i>

108
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,896
<i>Not anymore.</i>

109
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,006
<i>Breathe steady, old man.
Prove you're not completely useless.</i>

110
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,809
<i>What the hell?
Go out with a bang.</i>

111
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,045
<i>He likes to hear 'em scream.</i>

112
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,711
<i>I've seen his victims
and their twisted little faces,</i>

113
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:51,656
<i>all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed, frozen
in their last horrible moment of living.</i>

114
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:56,389
<i>No screams.
Either I'm just in time, or I'm way too late.</i>

115
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:11,106
<i>It's nothing. Barely a flesh wound.
On your feet, old man.</i>

116
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,979
Roark.
Give it up.

117
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,352
Let the girl go.

118
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,617
You can't do
a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan.

119
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,716
You know who I am.

120
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,023
You know who my father is!

121
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,621
You can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop.

122
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,527
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying.

123
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,705
Sure, I can.

124
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,283
Cover your eyes, Nancy.
I don't want you watching this.

125
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,345
I mean it, baby.
Cover your eyes right now.

126
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,550
<i>I take his weapons away.</i>

127
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,919
<i>Both of them.</i>

128
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,497
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

129
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,543
For God's sakes,
don't make it any worse.

130
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:22,207
- Don't make me kill you.
- Doin' fine, Bob.

131
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,551
Never better.

132
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,787
I'm ready to kick your ass.

133
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,717
<i>Keep him talking.
Buy time.</i>

134
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,454
<i>Just a few more minutes.
Just till the backup gets here.</i>

135
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,464
Sit down and stay down.
I'll kill you if I have to.

136
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:42,434
<i>Keep his mind off the girl -
skinny little Nancy.</i>

137
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,265
<i>He can't kill her
once the backup gets here.</i>

138
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,896
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.

139
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,874
Don't listen to him.
He's a crazy man.

140
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,242
- What a tough man you are?
- You stay right where you're at.

141
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,248
You shoot your partner in the back...

142
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,477
then you try to scare a little girl.

143
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:02,852
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod, plug you
a couple of times, show you how it's done.

144
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,084
We could've worked something out,
but you've blown that.

145
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:08,184
Sit down or I'll blast you in half.

146
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,687
- You're so slow, you'll never stop me.
- Sit down!

147
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,523
You'll never be able to stop me.

148
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:26,570
<i>I finally sit down,
just like you told me to.</i>

149
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,406
<i>The sirens are close now.</i>

150
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,783
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

151
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:46,329
<i>Things go dark.
I don't mind much.</i>

152
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,831
<i>Getting sleepy.
It's OK.</i>

153
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,201
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

154
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,706
<i>An old man dies,</i>

155
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,370
<i>a little girl lives.</i>

156
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,470
<i>Fair trade.</i>

157
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,785
<i>The night is hot as hell.</i>

158
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:11,153
<i>It's a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town.</i>

159
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,826
<i>I'm staring at a goddess.</i>

160
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,329
<i>She's telling me she wants me.</i>

161
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:21,231
<i>I'm not gonna waste one more second
wondering how I've gotten so lucky.</i>

162
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,893
I want you.

163
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,505
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

164
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,140
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

165
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,014
<i>The goddess.</i>

166
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,620
I need you.

167
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,021
<i>Goldie.</i>

168
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,532
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

169
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,933
<i>Three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big.</i>

170
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:08,139
<i>And that cold thing
happens to my stomach.</i>

171
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:12,311
<i>And I realize Goldie's dead.
Not a mark on her.</i>

172
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,718
<i>You'd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers</i>

173
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,553
<i>aren't moving like they would
if she was breathing.</i>

174
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,492
<i>She was murdered
and I was right here when it happened.</i>

175
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,998
<i>Lying next to her,
stone drunk, just like she was.</i>

176
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,493
<i>Damn it, Goldie. Who were you
and who wanted you dead?</i>

177
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:33,004
<i>Who were you
besides an angel of mercy,</i>

178
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,406
<i>giving a two-time loser like me
the night of his life?</i>

179
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,274
<i>It sure as hell wasn't my looks.</i>

180
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,281
<i>So why the sleazy saloon?</i>

181
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,715
<i>Why the kindness, Goldie?</i>

182
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,414
<i>The cops - they're telling me too much,</i>

183
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,390
<i>showing up before anybody
but me and the killer</i>

184
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,689
<i>could know there's been a murder.</i>

185
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:58,288
<i>Somebody paid good money
for this frame.</i>

186
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,063
<i>No reason at all to play it quiet.</i>

187
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,262
<i>No reason to play it any way but my way.</i>

188
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,835
<i>Whoever killed you is gonna pay, Goldie.</i>

189
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,911
Open up, police!

190
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,748
I'll be right out.

191
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,649
<i>I don't know why you died, Goldie.</i>

192
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,755
<i>I don't know why and I don't know how
I never even met you before tonight,</i>

193
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,592
<i>but you were a friend and more
when I needed one.</i>

194
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,359
<i>And when I find out who did it,</i>

195
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,527
<i>it won't be quick and quiet
like it was with you.</i>

196
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,299
<i>It'll be loud and nasty - my kind of kill.</i>

197
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,375
<i>And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I send him to</i>

198
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:20,038
<i>will seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.</i>

199
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,512
<i>I love you, Goldie.</i>

200
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,870
Claire?

201
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:59,184
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

202
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:04,189
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way am I giving you any alcohol.

203
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:08,387
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

204
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,156
No.

205
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,790
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

206
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,164
Thanks.
You're the best.

207
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,796
<i>Lucille's my parole officer.</i>

208
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,065
<i>She's a dyke, but God knows why.</i>

209
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,665
<i>Its that body of hers
she could have any man she wants.</i>

210
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,871
<i>The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.</i>

211
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:30,747
<i>She tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared.</i>

212
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,884
Haven't seen you like this in a while.

213
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:38,413
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them, did ya?

214
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:43,053
Not that I know of. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

215
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,893
How the hell do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

216
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,992
There ain't no squaring it.
Not this time.

217
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,731
This isn't some barroom brawl.

218
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:55,001
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

219
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,666
Hey, hey.
This is big.

220
00:17:56,776 --> 00:18:00,473
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- Hey, there ain't no settlin' down!

221
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,539
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons.

222
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:08,110
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

223
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:11,316
They're back.
There's no choices left.

224
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,188
And I'm ready for war.

225
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,750
Prison was hell for you, Marv.
It's gonna be life this time.

226
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,391
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

227
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,530
But I'm out now.

228
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:28,129
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

229
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:32,268
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

230
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,116
<i>So you were scared,
weren't you, Goldie?</i>

231
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,847
<i>Somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it.</i>

232
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,685
<i>So you hit the saloons, the bad places,</i>

233
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:49,058
<i>looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me.</i>

234
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,791
<i>Well, I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you,</i>

235
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,766
<i>and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye.</i>

236
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:59,094
<i>Walk down
the right back alley in Sin City...</i>

237
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:02,333
<i>- Leave your hands off Nancy.
... and you could find anything.</i>

238
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,138
That coat looks like Baghdad.

239
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,772
So does your face.
Take off!

240
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,613
He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.

241
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,123
<i>Kadie's is my kind of joint.</i>

242
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,364
<i>Nancy's just getting started with her gig,
but already the crowd's breathing hard.</i>

243
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,594
<i>Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy,</i>

244
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,434
<i>shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me.</i>

245
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,965
<i>But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight.</i>

246
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,476
What'll it be, Marv?

247
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,446
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

248
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,177
Sure, honey.
You take it slow, now.

249
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,960
<i>Most people think Marv is crazy.</i>

250
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,767
<i>He just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century.</i>

251
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,307
<i>He'd be right at home
on some ancient battlefield,</i>

252
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,775
<i>swinging an ax into somebody's face.</i>

253
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:16,772
<i>Or in a Roman arena
taking a sword to other gladiators like him.</i>

254
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,752
<i>They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then.</i>

255
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:26,321
Show's over, dickwad.
Drink up.

256
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,293
Now, that's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there.

257
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:36,997
Your killin' days are over,
you over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch.

258
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:42,063
<i>I love hit men. No matter what
you do to them, you don't feel bad.</i>

259
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,516
- Take it off.
- What?

260
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,019
A fine coat like that,
and you're bleeding all over it.

261
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,579
All right, it's all yours.
Oh, God!

262
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:01,184
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.

263
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:05,721
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing.

264
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,063
So tell me, man.
Who sent you?

265
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,433
I don't hear you giving me any names.

266
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,102
So I guess when I shot you in the belly
I aimed a little too high.

267
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:25,881
You keep holding out on me like this,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.

268
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:34,558
It was Telly...
Telly Stern passed me the order.

269
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:38,555
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.

270
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,990
Thanks again.

271
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,207
<i>Then the damnedest thing happens.</i>

272
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:53,405
<i>For a second, I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.</i>

273
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,970
<i>Just need my medicine, is all.</i>

274
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,177
Bastard.

275
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:01,345
You're gonna pay for what you did to me.

276
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:05,919
Feel like talking, Louie?

277
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,483
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie? Huh?

278
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,324
How many for the kill?

279
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,990
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

280
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,593
He'll never talk.

281
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,804
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

282
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:29,014
<i>Connelly talks.
They all talk.</i>

283
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,214
And what have been
your sins, my son?

284
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,845
Well, Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

285
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:37,981
so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch.

286
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:41,049
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

287
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,254
You're speaking figuratively.

288
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:47,925
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and look for somebody

289
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:50,492
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

290
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,766
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

291
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:59,743
By way of a "for instance",
I killed three men tonight.

292
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,177
Tortured 'em first.

293
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:05,581
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

294
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,450
First two were minnows -
small-time messengers.

295
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:13,390
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

296
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,189
Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

297
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:20,028
Just give me a damn name.

298
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:23,432
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck, Padre,

299
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:26,472
feeding me garbage like that.

300
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,733
It can't be that big.

301
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,138
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

302
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:33,144
It's all there.
Find out for yourself.

303
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,180
And while you're at it,

304
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:40,618
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

305
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:43,113
<i>Worth dying for.</i>

306
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,214
<i>Worth killing for.</i>

307
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,657
<i>Worth going to hell for.</i>

308
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,661
Amen.

309
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,101
<i>His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes,</i>

310
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:59,661
<i>or at least that's what they're
passing off as a Mercedes these days.</i>

311
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:03,833
<i>Modern cars -
they all look like electric shavers.</i>

312
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,110
Goldie.

313
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,083
Goldie!

314
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,028
It couldn't be Goldie.

315
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:33,402
<i>It's my own fault, and nobody else's,
that I got confused.</i>

316
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,270
<i>I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.</i>

317
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,277
<i>That wasn't Goldie back there.</i>

318
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,778
<i>Goldie's dead,</i>

319
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:44,806
<i>and that's the whole reason
that I've been doing what I've been doing.</i>

320
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:48,684
<i>When you got a condition,
it's bad to forget your medicine.</i>

321
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:56,986
<i>The cold thing, it creeps into my gut
and tells me one more time it won't let go.</i>

322
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:00,358
<i>This is a bad place, this farm.</i>

323
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:02,162
<i>People have died here...</i>

324
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,630
<i>...the wrong way.</i>

325
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,342
I don't want to fight, pooch.

326
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:16,177
I got no gripe with you.

327
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,381
Easy, boy.

328
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:26,324
<i>No way I was gonna use
my gun on you, buddy.</i>

329
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:29,122
<i>It's whoever owns you I'm curious about,</i>

330
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:33,256
<i>because there's blood on your breath,
and I think I know what kind.</i>

331
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,064
<i>So I sniff around to see what's buried.</i>

332
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,473
Here we go.

333
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,873
<i>It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.</i>

334
00:25:55,521 --> 00:26:00,322
<i>I go blind.
Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.</i>

335
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:04,022
<i>Nobody except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago.</i>

336
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,059
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

337
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,661
You killed Goldie.

338
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,397
It was...

339
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,530
<i>I blew it, Goldie.</i>

340
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,700
<i>I found your killer,
but he was better than me.</i>

341
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:21,371
<i>Too quiet, too quick.</i>

342
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,938
<i>A killer born.</i>

343
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,507
<i>Why didn't he finish the job?</i>

344
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:43,263
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

345
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:46,703
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

346
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:51,637
The wolf just gets scraps.

347
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,679
Bones.

348
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,111
It's him.

349
00:26:56,182 --> 00:27:00,619
He eats people.

350
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:05,048
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

351
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,388
Just like they were steaks.

352
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,792
Now he's got both of us.

353
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:13,093
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

354
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:16,733
Just look at the heads on the wall.

355
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,929
The heads on the wall.

356
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,573
The heads on the wall.

357
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:25,610
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

358
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:29,841
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

359
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,648
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

360
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:37,655
He made me watch!

361
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,530
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

362
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:52,135
<i>Dames.
Sometimes all they gotta do is let it out.</i>

363
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:55,537
<i>And a few buckets later,
there's no way you'd know.</i>

364
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:58,235
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

365
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:02,906
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

366
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,212
Any leads?

367
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:09,015
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

368
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,923
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out
that hooker almost before I did.

369
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:17,622
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

370
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,824
The dead one.

371
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,094
Goldie.

372
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,636
I didn't know she was a hooker.

373
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:27,865
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

374
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:34,608
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

375
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,341
She must have shown you quite a time.

376
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,576
Quiet.
There's a car coming.

377
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,956
Kevin!

378
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:49,758
<i>All I've got is a face... and a name.</i>

379
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,820
I'll see you later, Kevin.

380
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:02,866
Let's go.

381
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,590
They're done checking the house.

382
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:23,686
They're coming this way.

383
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,857
Bastards.
I'll show them.

384
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:36,032
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

385
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,872
No, don't shoot!
Please.

386
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,208
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

387
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,748
He's unconscious and unarmed,

388
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:46,808
so there's no need to kill him.

389
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,323
Captain, the target - there's no sign of him.

390
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,622
Here's a sign!

391
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,141
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

392
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:26,384
<i>I keep coming back to that cop I just killed
and what he told me.</i>

393
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:29,257
<i>I was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille,</i>

394
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,888
<i>so I took my time
with that son of a bitch.</i>

395
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:36,231
<i>It wasn't till I showed him
all those pieces of himself that he said it.</i>

396
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:41,967
<i>Just a name
Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth.</i>

397
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:45,134
<i>Could've become president,
but he chose to serve God.</i>

398
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:49,772
<i>Along the way, he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state.</i>

399
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:53,785
<i>He's brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing.</i>

400
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:57,448
<i>He even made his rotten brother
a US senator without breaking a sweat.</i>

401
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:02,517
<i>And here he's gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker.</i>

402
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:07,498
<i>I'm getting used to the idea.
More and more, I'm liking the sound of it.</i>

403
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,697
<i>Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.</i>

404
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,670
<i>What if I'm wrong?</i>

405
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,605
<i>I've got a condition.</i>

406
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,836
<i>I get confused sometimes.</i>

407
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:22,847
<i>And with Lucille dead,
I can't get my medicine.</i>

408
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,110
<i>What if I've imagined all of this?</i>

409
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:30,486
<i>What if I've finally turned into what
they've always said I was gonna turn into?</i>

410
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,956
<i>A maniac.</i>

411
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:35,425
<i>A psycho killer.</i>

412
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,622
<i>Can't kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to.</i>

413
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,722
<i>I've gotta know for sure.</i>

414
00:31:43,803 --> 00:31:48,297
<i>The merchandise is on display
by the time I make my way to Old Town.</i>

415
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,137
<i>For an hour or so,
I asked around about Goldie.</i>

416
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,008
<i>I don't get any answers,
but I know I'm bound to.</i>

417
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,206
<i>Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,</i>

418
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:59,046
<i>and if she was, she has roots here</i>

419
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:01,951
<i>friends, maybe even family.</i>

420
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,753
You can't be Goldie.
Goldie's dead.

421
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:24,205
Goldie.
Yeah, sure, right.

422
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:28,337
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

423
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,974
No wonder I'm seeing things.

424
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,517
Bastard!

425
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:40,157
He's crazy.

426
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:43,286
Hit him again, Wendy.
Harder.

427
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,330
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

428
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,731
Because that's my name, you ape.

429
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:54,773
Goldie was my sister.
My twin sister.

430
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,206
I guess she was the nice one.

431
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:07,011
Goldie and the other six - where are they?

432
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,077
What did you do to them?

433
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,622
You crazy goddamn broad.

434
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,681
Just take a look at this mug.

435
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,957
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

436
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,659
None of you would, but Goldie.

437
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,897
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

438
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:30,237
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

439
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:35,406
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy,
they showed up, guns blazing.

440
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:40,918
But they didn't get me, and I've been killing
my way to the truth ever since.

441
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:44,649
So, go ahead, doll.

442
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:49,456
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

443
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,430
Nuts.

444
00:33:58,938 --> 00:34:01,805
OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out.

445
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:07,975
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots! That's my specialty!

446
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,912
You sat there and took it,

447
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:12,951
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to.

448
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:17,512
Well, sure. I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

449
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,854
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

450
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:23,019
and I don't hurt girls.

451
00:34:23,696 --> 00:34:25,425
I need a pair of handcuffs.

452
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:28,557
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

453
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:32,593
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

454
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:35,565
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

455
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:39,041
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

456
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:41,579
I know that sounds crazy.

457
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,980
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

458
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,578
<i>Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap.</i>

459
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:52,055
<i>I'm too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet,</i>

460
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:57,084
<i>but she fires up two cigarettes and hands
me one, and I taste her lipstick on it.</i>

461
00:34:57,162 --> 00:35:01,690
<i>And suddenly, my heart's pounding
so loud I can't hear anything else.</i>

462
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:06,329
<i>I want to reach over and touch her
and taste Goldie's sweat one more time.</i>

463
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,565
<i>But she isn't Goldie.</i>

464
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:10,699
<i>Yeah, yeah.
This'll do.</i>

465
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:16,247
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing...

466
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,715
and a spool of razor wire...

467
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:24,983
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

468
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:28,053
Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

469
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,651
You can bet your ass.

470
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:34,031
She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

471
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:37,660
But why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

472
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,901
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

473
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:47,468
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman.

474
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,377
You know, the way I look.

475
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:54,984
<i>I take my mind off her
and I crawl back inside myself.</i>

476
00:35:55,054 --> 00:35:58,023
<i>It's almost killing time,
and I'd better get sharp.</i>

477
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:02,322
<i>I check the list
rubber tubing, gas, saw,</i>

478
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:06,421
<i>gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,</i>

479
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,762
<i>Gladys and my mitts.</i>

480
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:12,793
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

481
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,430
Keep the engine runnin'.

482
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:20,308
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

483
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,313
Kill him for me, Marv.

484
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,478
Kill him good.

485
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:28,315
I won't let you down, Goldie.

486
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,427
<i>Heading downstairs to the kitchen.</i>

487
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:51,100
<i>Getting himself a midnight snack,
and I can guess what kind.</i>

488
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,651
Come on, you son of a bitch.

489
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,491
<i>Damn, he's slick.</i>

490
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,042
Is that the best you can do, creep?

491
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:30,812
<i>That's right.
Get personal, get close. I can take it.</i>

492
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:36,387
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

493
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:45,022
<i>I try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs.</i>

494
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:48,760
<i>My muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come.</i>

495
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:52,634
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

496
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:55,263
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

497
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:58,138
Oh, but I want to...

498
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,271
<i>I'm sorry, kid,
but I haven't even started with this creep,</i>

499
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:06,579
<i>and I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.</i>

500
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:09,678
God, I gotta tell you, I'm good and bushed.

501
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:12,952
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

502
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,926
It's all that sawing and tying.

503
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:19,259
It's not as easy as it looks.

504
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:24,633
Could have been a real mess around here
if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets.

505
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:31,273
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

506
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:36,645
to get the scent in the air,
to get that friend of yours to come running.

507
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:42,016
Well, what do you know?

508
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,448
Look who's here.

509
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,014
Here he comes.

510
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:56,461
That's a good dog.

511
00:38:56,535 --> 00:39:00,562
<i>He doesn't scream,
not even when the mutt's had its fill</i>

512
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,232
<i>and Kevin's guts
are lying all over the place.</i>

513
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:07,210
<i>Somehow the bastard is still alive,
still staring at me.</i>

514
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:11,443
<i>Not even when I grab the saw
and finish the job.</i>

515
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,351
<i>He never screams.</i>

516
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:20,453
<i>I put in a call to Kadie's
and ask Nancy to get her clothes on</i>

517
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,961
<i>and meet me at her place.
She says, "Yes," like always.</i>

518
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,793
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

519
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,834
Sure, Marv.
Who's the babe?

520
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,836
<i>There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.</i>

521
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,600
<i>Not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up</i>

522
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,039
<i>and I straightened him out but good.</i>

523
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,807
<i>It really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames.</i>

524
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,643
So, what do you want me to do with her?

525
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:48,345
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

526
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,514
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

527
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,354
Hell, no.
I like it here.

528
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,162
<i>I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit</i>

529
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,530
<i>so as not to get any attention.</i>

530
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:06,870
<i>My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.</i>

531
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,838
<i>I owe you, Goldie.</i>

532
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,307
<i>I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.</i>

533
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,345
<i>So, if going after Roark
means dying, win or lose -</i>

534
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:18,940
<i>hell, I'll die laughing
if I know I've done this one thing right.</i>

535
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:26,182
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

536
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,988
<i>All right, keep a lookout.</i>

537
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,209
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

538
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,507
The dog ate the rest.

539
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:03,389
Oh, my God.
You monster.

540
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:06,260
You demon.

541
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,792
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

542
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:15,029
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me.

543
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:19,001
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

544
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:24,741
It's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while I'm around.

545
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,080
When he came to me...

546
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,885
he was a tormented boy.

547
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,454
Tormented by guilt.

548
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,761
I tried to counsel him.

549
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:44,758
But the eating - it filled him with white light.

550
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:49,938
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

551
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:52,937
What the hell do you know?

552
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,479
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people.

553
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:58,482
He didn't just eat their bodies,

554
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:01,045
he ate their souls.

555
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:05,054
And I joined in.

556
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:10,488
They were all whores.

557
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:15,429
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

558
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:20,929
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything.

559
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,337
<i>She stayed in public places.</i>

560
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,740
<i>And then with you.</i>

561
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:27,244
<i>You were so convenient.</i>

562
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,580
<i>You'd broke a man's jaw that very night.</i>

563
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:33,209
Who would believe a thug like you?

564
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:34,877
<i>Kevin killed her.</i>

565
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:38,684
<i>I ordered the police in for you,
but you wouldn't be caught.</i>

566
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,224
<i>You wouldn't stop.</i>

567
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:43,227
And now he's dead and you're here to...

568
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,730
eliminate me.

569
00:42:47,466 --> 00:42:50,993
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

570
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:57,731
Killing a helpless old fart?

571
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,608
The killing, no.

572
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:03,477
No satisfaction.

573
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:08,149
Everything up until the killing will be a gas.

574
00:43:11,523 --> 00:43:13,286
Kevin...

575
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,921
we're going home.

576
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:24,124
You can scream now if you want to.

577
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:36,477
<i>It's beautiful, Goldie.
It's just like I promised, only better.</i>

578
00:43:36,548 --> 00:43:38,072
<i>And when his eyes go dead,</i>

579
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:42,381
<i>the hell I sent him to must seem like
heaven after what I've done to him.</i>

580
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,446
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God!

581
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,829
<i>Jerks.</i>

582
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,700
<i>They should've shot me in the head,
and enough times to make sure.</i>

583
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,566
<i>It's so stupid.</i>

584
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:04,608
<i>Everybody knows what's coming,
but they go through the motions anyway.</i>

585
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,870
<i>What a waste of time.</i>

586
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:11,414
<i>Months fall off the calendar
while I breathe and eat through tubes.</i>

587
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:15,385
<i>Night after night, I wait for somebody
to come and finish me off.</i>

588
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:19,287
<i>After a while,
I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that.</i>

589
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:21,919
<i>I'm on my feet for about ten minutes</i>

590
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,928
<i>before the cops kick them out
from under me.</i>

591
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,021
<i>They don't ask me any questions.</i>

592
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:31,558
<i>They just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face.</i>

593
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,661
<i>And I keep spitting blood all over it</i>

594
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:37,299
<i>and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with.</i>

595
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:41,869
<i>Then along comes this worm assistant
district attorney who turns the recorder off</i>

596
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:46,417
<i>and says if I don't sign their confession,
they'll kill my mom.</i>

597
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:49,942
<i>I break his arm in three places
and I sign it.</i>

598
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,115
<i>From then on,
it's the circus everybody wants it to be.</i>

599
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:57,592
<i>They nail me for the works -
not just the people I did kill,</i>

600
00:44:57,662 --> 00:45:01,894
<i>but even Lucille and the girls
that Roark and Kevin ate,</i>

601
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,367
<i>and even Goldie.</i>

602
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:09,632
<i>The judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence.</i>

603
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:13,678
<i>Midnight and my death
are only a few hours away,</i>

604
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:16,941
<i>when I get my first surprise in 18 months.</i>

605
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,950
<i>My only visitor.</i>

606
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:24,011
<i>I'm ready for anything but that scent.</i>

607
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:27,217
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

608
00:45:32,364 --> 00:45:34,992
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

609
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,297
I got confused again.

610
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,998
Just seeing you like this.

611
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,901
You can call me Goldie.

612
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,046
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

613
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:00,751
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

614
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:02,622
<i>The goddess.</i>

615
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,123
<i>Goldie.</i>

616
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,791
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

617
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:14,961
<i>They fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal.</i>

618
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:19,567
<i>They even throw in a brew.
It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's.</i>

619
00:46:19,678 --> 00:46:24,342
<i>Then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it.</i>

620
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:27,283
<i>And it's about damned time,
if you ask me.</i>

621
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:29,912
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death... "

622
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:32,718
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

623
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,487
You heard the man.
Hit it.

624
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:47,795
Is that the best you can do, you pansies?

625
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,111
He's gone.

626
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,132
Forget it, man.

627
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,299
You can bang on that door
all night if you want to.

628
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,934
There is no way in hell I'm letting you in.

629
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:30,481
I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

630
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:34,882
Everything we've shared -
it has to mean something to you.

631
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:36,750
Ha. It meant plenty.

632
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:40,052
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress

633
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:42,753
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises.

634
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:44,419
I know you're angry, baby.

635
00:47:44,496 --> 00:47:47,659
And I forgive you for that
without you even asking me to.

636
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:49,563
There's a difference
between getting honked off

637
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,363
at a guy who's generally not so bad,

638
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:55,599
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

639
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:58,232
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about

640
00:47:58,343 --> 00:48:01,039
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

641
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:04,013
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

642
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:07,051
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

643
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:09,518
That hurt, Shellie.

644
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:15,219
It's one thing for you to play hard to get,
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

645
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:17,818
I am impossible to get.

646
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:24,392
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,
and get help, like a shrink.

647
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:27,302
Get help and get lost.

648
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,066
Just open the door.

649
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:34,043
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

650
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:38,208
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

651
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:43,218
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

652
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:46,951
No! If he knew that you were here with me,
you don't know how bad this could get!

653
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:50,517
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

654
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,722
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall,

655
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:55,425
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

656
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,437
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

657
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:06,067
Somebody! Jackie Boy,
it's a regular African love fest in here!

658
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:09,746
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

659
00:49:09,814 --> 00:49:12,942
and half the bench of
the Basin City Blues keeping me company.

660
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:15,144
You feel like taking them on?

661
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,280
You are teasing me, baby.

662
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:21,917
Some of my best friends...

663
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:24,654
But you're really pushing my buttons.

664
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:26,959
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

665
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:29,864
I've been too polite to point out
that at any time I want to,

666
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:33,131
I could kick this damn door to splinters.

667
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:36,139
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

668
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,505
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

669
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:41,568
All right.
All right, all right!

670
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,751
Troops, make yourself at home.

671
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:59,487
You brought your whole pack with you?

672
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:02,397
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

673
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:04,128
You're gonna love this, baby.

674
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:07,035
You're gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

675
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:10,596
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

676
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,505
and it's gonna be great.

677
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:14,704
I ain't calling up nobody.

678
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:24,052
That's a man's shirt,
and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

679
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:28,491
You got somebody's love stink all over you.

680
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,926
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

681
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:35,432
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

682
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,561
He flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming,

683
00:50:39,671 --> 00:50:42,105
'cause you scared him so bad.

684
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:48,302
You think
I have no feelings at all.

685
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,540
If you're gonna slug me,

686
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:53,641
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

687
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:57,848
There you go,
lying about me again,

688
00:50:57,922 --> 00:51:00,516
right in front of my friends.

689
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:03,890
I have never hit a woman in my life.

690
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:11,729
That's showing her, man.

691
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:16,331
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

692
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:19,376
Baby, we're all here to have a good time.

693
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:23,244
I gotta take a leak.

694
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:25,782
Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy.

695
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:29,483
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

696
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:32,045
Could've seen what a real man looks like.

697
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:35,957
There you go, after my nuts again.

698
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:38,325
But I forgive you.

699
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:40,387
I'm a generous guy.

700
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:44,925
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

701
00:51:45,003 --> 00:51:48,131
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

702
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:51,707
My temper you don't have to worry about.

703
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:55,907
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

704
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,681
I've been told.

705
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:05,652
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

706
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:08,487
Answer me!

707
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,652
I don't need this grief.

708
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:16,598
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

709
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:21,570
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again,
you even think her name,

710
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:25,268
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

711
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:29,836
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

712
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:35,250
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself.

713
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,685
You didn't flush.

714
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:32,776
Troops, get outta here.

715
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,004
No questions, damn it.
No questions.

716
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,910
Now!

717
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,861
Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?

718
00:53:57,935 --> 00:54:00,870
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine.

719
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,099
I don't think he'll be bothering you again.

720
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:07,068
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

721
00:54:07,178 --> 00:54:11,171
Dwight, he was from a while back,

722
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:14,548
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

723
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:18,385
And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him.

724
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:20,890
And it was only once.

725
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,949
I've done some dumb things.

726
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:25,018
Seeing as how
I'm one of those dumb things,

727
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:27,792
I can't give you
too hard a time about that, Shellie.

728
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:32,131
But this guy, he's a menace.

729
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:35,069
He might kill somebody if I don't stop him.

730
00:54:37,008 --> 00:54:38,669
I'll call you later.

731
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,243
No, don't go!

732
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:42,642
<i>Shellie shouts something
I can't quite make out</i>

733
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:45,409
<i>over the racket of a passing police 'copter.</i>

734
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:49,146
<i>- Stop!
- It sounds like "stop," but I can't be sure.</i>

735
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:53,415
<i>It's a chance I shouldn't be taking,
but I can't just go home and forget about it,</i>

736
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,858
<i>and let Jackie Boy and his pals
find their fun.</i>

737
00:54:56,928 --> 00:55:02,525
<i>They're a pack of predators and they're
out for blood tonight - a woman's blood.</i>

738
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,899
Damn it, Dwight.
Damn it.

739
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:08,938
You fool.

740
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,270
You damned fool.

741
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,104
<i>I cut my Caddy across the park</i>

742
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:16,738
<i>to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.</i>

743
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,805
<i>I'm speeding.</i>

744
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:23,684
<i>That's a good way to get yourself noticed.
And if you're a murderer with a new face</i>

745
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:28,123
<i>who's one fingerprint check away from
the fast track to the gas chamber like I am,</i>

746
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:31,320
<i>the last thing you want
is to get noticed.</i>

747
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:37,123
<i>I don't have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop, and even if I did,</i>

748
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:40,364
<i>there's always the outside chance
he's one of the honest ones.</i>

749
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:46,068
<i>Do I try to talk my way out of this,
or do I take this cop down and risk it all?</i>

750
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:50,477
<i>Then Jackie Boy saves me
a great, big, steaming pile of trouble.</i>

751
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:53,142
Watch it, Jack!

752
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:00,886
Cops!
They're right on our ass!

753
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:04,450
Not for long.
Not where we're headed.

754
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:07,588
<i>My gut tightens up.</i>

755
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:12,034
<i>Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.</i>

756
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:16,470
<i>The cop shuts off his siren.</i>

757
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,805
<i>He knows he's not the law,
not in Old Town.</i>

758
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:24,143
<i>The ladies are the law here,
beautiful and merciless.</i>

759
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,183
<i>If you've got the cash
and you play by the rules,</i>

760
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,650
<i>they'll make all your dreams come true.</i>

761
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,519
<i>But if you cross 'em, you're a corpse.</i>

762
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:43,233
Hey, baby.

763
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,297
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

764
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:53,199
Sweetheart. I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

765
00:56:53,311 --> 00:56:56,337
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

766
00:56:57,014 --> 00:57:00,381
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

767
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:02,544
I don't do talk jobs, either.

768
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:07,683
Babydoll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

769
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:11,455
I've been beat up every time I turn around.

770
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:13,656
But the day I get turned down by a hooker

771
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:17,326
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with...

772
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:19,801
well...

773
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:22,372
there's only so much a man can take.

774
00:57:22,473 --> 00:57:24,600
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

775
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:27,075
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

776
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:29,772
The Amigo's a fag joint.

777
00:57:30,314 --> 00:57:36,253
Are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all?

778
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:41,821
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

779
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:44,452
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them.

780
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:46,553
Everything's under control.

781
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:49,792
Enjoy the show.

782
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:52,802
<i>There's no use arguing with her.</i>

783
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:55,770
<i>The ladies are their own enforcers.</i>

784
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,832
So, how's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

785
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:01,844
Not right now, Gail.

786
00:58:02,113 --> 00:58:03,705
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

787
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:08,048
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

788
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:11,145
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

789
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:14,248
Damn it, Gail.
Not right now.

790
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:18,227
Those clowns down the way -
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

791
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:20,388
One of them thinks he is.

792
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:22,489
He's outta control.

793
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:26,002
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

794
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,699
Us helpless little girls.

795
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:34,368
<i>All kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us,</i>

796
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:38,039
<i>and still it's hard to take my eyes off her.</i>

797
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:40,845
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot.

798
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:43,386
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

799
00:58:43,454 --> 00:58:45,922
from seeing what Miho can do.

800
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,983
And she's been aching for some practice.

801
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:55,728
<i>She guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.</i>

802
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,964
<i>- Deadly little Miho.
- You're running out of alley, cowboy.</i>

803
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:04,304
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

804
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:07,070
You're a sassy little thing.

805
00:59:07,178 --> 00:59:11,979
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

806
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:16,110
<i>The trap is set,
locked and ready to spring.</i>

807
00:59:16,187 --> 00:59:20,089
<i>So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.</i>

808
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:23,524
<i>So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?</i>

809
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:26,825
They haven't killed anybody I know about.

810
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:31,596
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

811
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:33,102
And they won't.

812
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,297
<i>Why this rotten feeling?</i>

813
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:38,864
<i>Something Shellie said.
I can't place it.</i>

814
00:59:38,976 --> 00:59:43,208
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

815
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,249
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

816
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:49,581
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

817
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:53,487
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

818
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:55,991
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

819
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:00,390
You wanna see it?

820
01:00:01,499 --> 01:00:04,957
You wanna see what I got?

821
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:09,096
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

822
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:12,675
You seen this one?

823
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:16,272
Get in the car.

824
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:21,010
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

825
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,497
Oh, God, no!

826
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,232
This is crazy!

827
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:46,669
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

828
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:58,851
Go ahead.

829
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:01,289
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

830
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:05,192
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

831
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:11,832
I got you right where I want you.

832
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:15,099
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

833
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:18,664
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

834
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:32,879
This isn't funny.

835
01:01:33,624 --> 01:01:37,219
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

836
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,524
Every one of you is gonna burn.

837
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,528
Hang it up.
She's just playing with you.

838
01:01:43,601 --> 01:01:46,900
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

839
01:01:47,738 --> 01:01:51,333
<i>Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.</i>

840
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:55,242
I told you to shut up.

841
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:02,414
I can't see.

842
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:04,511
What's happening?

843
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,490
I can't see.

844
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,289
I can't hear anything.

845
01:02:11,362 --> 01:02:14,820
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

846
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,459
Make it quick, will you?

847
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:23,399
<i>She doesn't quite chop his head off.</i>

848
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:29,442
<i>She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.</i>

849
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:34,943
<i>Then it's straight to business - stretching
the corpses out on the alley floor</i>

850
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:39,285
<i>and going through their pockets,
divvying up cash when they find it.</i>

851
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:41,415
<i>I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants.</i>

852
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:43,323
<i>His wallet is packed.</i>

853
01:02:43,394 --> 01:02:47,353
<i>Mastercard, Discover,
Platinum American Express,</i>

854
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:49,695
<i>and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties</i>

855
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:53,703
<i>that I'm not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets.</i>

856
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:55,636
<i>Then I find an atom bomb.</i>

857
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,338
<i>Jackie Boy,</i>

858
01:03:00,411 --> 01:03:02,845
<i>you son of a bitch.</i>

859
01:03:07,851 --> 01:03:09,944
<i>There was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket,</i>

860
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,183
<i>I couldn't quite make out what she said.</i>

861
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:15,691
<i>I thought Shellie said "stop. "</i>

862
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:18,387
<i>She said "cop. "</i>

863
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,659
<i>Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.</i>

864
01:03:21,732 --> 01:03:25,065
<i>Iron Jack, the papers call him.</i>

865
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,899
<i>A goddamn hero cop.</i>

866
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:33,241
<i>It's held for years, the shaky truce.</i>

867
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:37,303
<i>The cops get a slice of the profits and free
entertainment when they throw a party.</i>

868
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:40,212
<i>The girls get to administer
their own brand of justice.</i>

869
01:03:40,751 --> 01:03:45,279
<i>They get to defend their own turf.
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood</i>

870
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:49,758
<i>and he's not shopping for what the girls
are selling, they send him packing,</i>

871
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:52,489
<i>but they send him back alive.</i>

872
01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:54,690
<i>That's the rules.</i>

873
01:03:54,765 --> 01:03:56,665
<i>That's the truce.</i>

874
01:03:56,734 --> 01:03:59,259
<i>The cops stay out.</i>

875
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,464
<i>That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out.</i>

876
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:05,531
<i>Old Town will be left wide open.</i>

877
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:07,542
<i>It'll be war.</i>

878
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:11,103
<i>The streets will run red with blood -</i>

879
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:13,513
<i>women's blood.</i>

880
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:16,018
The cops!
The mob!

881
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:18,782
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be!

882
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:22,724
The hell they will!
We got guns.

883
01:04:22,793 --> 01:04:24,886
We'll fight the cops and the mob

884
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:28,398
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

885
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:30,092
- We'll go to war.
- Don't be stupid.

886
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:33,466
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

887
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:36,700
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

888
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:38,172
I'll hide the bodies.

889
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:41,733
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

890
01:04:41,845 --> 01:04:44,336
The cops know Rafferty came here.

891
01:04:44,448 --> 01:04:47,474
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

892
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,451
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

893
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,421
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check the pits.

894
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:54,389
Get that gun out of my face or I'll smack ya.

895
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:58,656
Who do you think you are, giving orders?

896
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:01,323
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

897
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:04,128
You got what you wanted out of me!

898
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:07,830
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

899
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:12,137
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

900
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,938
<i>Miho moves to my back.</i>

901
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,140
<i>One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half.</i>

902
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:22,879
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

903
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:26,184
It'll be the bad old days all over again.

904
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,986
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

905
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:33,018
They won't be watching the roads. Not yet,
they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

906
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:35,360
If I don't make it, you can have your war.

907
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,026
Get that gun out of my face now!

908
01:05:40,671 --> 01:05:42,468
Bastard!

909
01:05:47,211 --> 01:05:49,441
I forgot how quick you are.

910
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,109
<i>My warrior woman.</i>

911
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:55,811
<i>She almost yanks my head clean off,</i>

912
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:59,117
<i>shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts.</i>

913
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:02,625
<i>An explosion that blasts away
the dull, gray years</i>

914
01:06:02,693 --> 01:06:06,993
<i>between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine.</i>

915
01:06:07,865 --> 01:06:10,663
A hardtop with a decent engine.

916
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:13,100
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

917
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:18,335
I'll always love you, baby.

918
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:22,310
Always... and never.

919
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,413
Where'd you find that heap?

920
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:36,016
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

921
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:39,620
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,

922
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:41,687
you think maybe I could go home?

923
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:45,929
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

924
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:48,198
Sure, Becky, go home.

925
01:06:48,272 --> 01:06:51,070
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

926
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,075
They'll never fit in that trunk.

927
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:57,910
Not like this, they won't.
Miho.

928
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,316
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!

929
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:02,511
You'll catch cold if you don't.

930
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:16,858
Hey, Becky.
Gail said no calls.

931
01:07:16,934 --> 01:07:20,700
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

932
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:23,399
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

933
01:07:25,943 --> 01:07:27,467
Hey, Mom?

934
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:33,077
<i>Dizzy dames.</i>

935
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:37,177
<i>What were they thinking, sticking me
with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?</i>

936
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:39,950
<i>We were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was,</i>

937
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:41,684
<i>we packed it so tight.</i>

938
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:46,661
<i>There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,</i>

939
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,632
<i>out where anybody who cares to look
will see him.</i>

940
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:55,771
<i>Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes.</i>

941
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:58,604
<i>It'll help.</i>

942
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:27,469
It's got you smoking there, bud.

943
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:35,068
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

944
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:37,339
You're dead.

945
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:41,646
I'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up.

946
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:46,655
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

947
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:49,157
It's got you hearing things.

948
01:08:49,226 --> 01:08:52,389
It's got your nerves shot.

949
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:55,056
It's got you smoking.

950
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:59,068
You know it's true.

951
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:02,799
Nobody ever really quits.

952
01:09:04,408 --> 01:09:09,175
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

953
01:09:09,246 --> 01:09:14,149
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

954
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:18,181
Will you look at that?

955
01:09:19,723 --> 01:09:23,181
Those hookers let you down.

956
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:29,659
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

957
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:33,965
You sucker for the babes, you.

958
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:37,029
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits.

959
01:09:37,107 --> 01:09:40,235
You shut the hell up.
I'll make it.

960
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:43,779
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie.

961
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:47,909
Watch it!

962
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,376
This is great.

963
01:09:50,454 --> 01:09:53,821
Just like being in a buddy movie.

964
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:56,256
Shut up!

965
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:03,358
Boy, you're screwed.

966
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:05,492
It's over.

967
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:08,094
You're flushed.

968
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:11,766
This time, I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

969
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,208
Sure, he's an asshole.

970
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:17,906
Sure, he's dead.

971
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:21,610
Sure, I'm just imagining that he's talking.

972
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:25,746
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.

973
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:29,280
I don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop.

974
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:31,589
Not in this heap.

975
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:34,186
Pull over!

976
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:39,226
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

977
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:41,770
Tough call.

978
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:45,035
For all I know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

979
01:10:45,142 --> 01:10:49,340
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.

980
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,710
My hand moves all on its own,

981
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:55,808
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

982
01:10:57,988 --> 01:11:02,857
- I don't know what to do.
- You better stop. You're making him mad.

983
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:07,128
Whatever you say.

984
01:11:14,104 --> 01:11:17,767
Your friend here...
party a little too hard tonight?

985
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:22,072
I'm the designated driver.

986
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:31,048
Well, you're driving with a busted tail light.

987
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:38,453
I'll let you off with a warning.

988
01:11:46,236 --> 01:11:47,726
What next?

989
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:56,708
<i>The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits.</i>

990
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:59,749
<i>I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.</i>

991
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:03,081
<i>A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over.</i>

992
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:06,520
<i>Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits,</i>

993
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:10,822
<i>I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,
go home and call it a...</i>

994
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,366
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.

995
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:28,171
Clear the streets.
We're in lockdown.

996
01:12:28,278 --> 01:12:30,940
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

997
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:33,380
Not tonight.

998
01:12:36,786 --> 01:12:40,381
Don't struggle.
You'll only hurt yourself.

999
01:12:40,457 --> 01:12:42,721
Your cause is lost.

1000
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:44,555
We know everything.

1001
01:12:44,628 --> 01:12:48,689
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

1002
01:12:48,765 --> 01:12:53,759
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

1003
01:12:53,837 --> 01:12:57,000
There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.

1004
01:12:57,107 --> 01:13:00,975
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood.

1005
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:05,639
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

1006
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:10,709
But it is within your power
to save many lives

1007
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:15,190
by facilitating the process of transition,

1008
01:13:15,258 --> 01:13:20,594
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

1009
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:23,722
Son of a bitch!
I know you.

1010
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:28,931
I have suffered your kind before -
the dregs of Sin City.

1011
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:31,030
I serve a new master now,

1012
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:35,976
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well.

1013
01:13:36,046 --> 01:13:41,484
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

1014
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:45,112
because, by now, he is surely dead.

1015
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:47,952
You don't know him.

1016
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:51,289
My man will find a way.

1017
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:54,421
He always finds a way.

1018
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:57,924
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1019
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:01,368
and going on about how they got it so bad.

1020
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:03,736
This is a fine, grand country.

1021
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,206
Guiding light of the modern world, it is.

1022
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:09,507
Low taxes, land of opportunity.

1023
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:13,208
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1024
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:15,911
Sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches

1025
01:14:15,985 --> 01:14:18,351
without shite to show for it.

1026
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:22,281
Yeesh.

1027
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,952
You find something, Murphy?

1028
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:28,327
Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge.

1029
01:14:28,398 --> 01:14:30,389
It's all bent up.

1030
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:33,334
What's this stuck in it?

1031
01:14:33,403 --> 01:14:35,462
Bloody hell.
It's the bullet.

1032
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:48,344
You son of a bitch!
Bastard!

1033
01:14:49,753 --> 01:14:51,983
<i>They weren't cops, these four.</i>

1034
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:54,046
<i>They were mercenaries.</i>

1035
01:14:54,124 --> 01:14:56,388
<i>And if they were hired
by who I think they were,</i>

1036
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:59,389
<i>the bad times haven't even started yet.</i>

1037
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:02,954
<i>And everything seemed
to be going so well.</i>

1038
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:20,111
Remember, we don't have to
deliver every last inch of the man, Brian.

1039
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:22,481
You got a good point there, Ronnie.

1040
01:15:22,552 --> 01:15:25,783
Lend me your knife.

1041
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,949
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

1042
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:32,051
I'm at the bone, all right?

1043
01:15:34,264 --> 01:15:36,391
There we go.

1044
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:43,501
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1045
01:15:44,474 --> 01:15:48,069
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

1046
01:15:48,178 --> 01:15:51,045
use your imagination, OK?

1047
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:03,189
<i>Silence, now.</i>

1048
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:05,659
<i>No air to breathe.</i>

1049
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:09,789
<i>Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils.</i>

1050
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:15,401
<i>Let it in.
Let it fill your lungs.</i>

1051
01:16:15,472 --> 01:16:19,135
<i>They were counting on you
and you blew it.</i>

1052
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:24,443
<i>Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.</i>

1053
01:16:24,514 --> 01:16:28,211
<i>Miho, you're an angel.</i>

1054
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:30,184
<i>You're a saint.</i>

1055
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,483
<i>You're Mother Teresa.</i>

1056
01:16:32,555 --> 01:16:34,614
<i>You're Elvis.</i>

1057
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:36,921
<i>You're God.</i>

1058
01:16:37,627 --> 01:16:43,224
<i>And if you'd shown up ten minutes
earlier, we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.</i>

1059
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:46,658
Dwight, they got Gail!

1060
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:50,935
It's a cinch.
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town.

1061
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,907
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

1062
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:56,411
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail.

1063
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,470
But first, we gotta get
our hands on Jackie Boy's head

1064
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:02,745
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this whole situation blows wide open.

1065
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:08,052
Miho, I hope to hell
you left one of 'em alive enough to talk.

1066
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:19,226
<i>I let him know I'm not fooling around.</i>

1067
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:26,066
<i>We talk.</i>

1068
01:17:35,118 --> 01:17:38,918
<i>Stay smart.
Stay cool.</i>

1069
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:42,446
<i>It's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn.</i>

1070
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:45,688
<i>Sometimes, that means dying.</i>

1071
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:49,254
<i>Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people.</i>

1072
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,823
There they are.
What do we do?

1073
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,060
We stop 'em, Dallas.

1074
01:18:02,312 --> 01:18:04,473
<i>Jackie Boy's head is so close to me</i>

1075
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:08,381
<i>I could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there.</i>

1076
01:18:13,656 --> 01:18:15,851
Get the head!

1077
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:19,552
I got it!

1078
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:29,237
Suck on this, you stupid slag!

1079
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:35,976
<i>I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead,</i>

1080
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:40,778
<i>but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me
wants to get some killing done.</i>

1081
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:48,047
You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it!

1082
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:54,990
Brave lad.

1083
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:58,932
I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

1084
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:02,768
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

1085
01:19:02,839 --> 01:19:05,137
You got the drop on me, love.

1086
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,709
I'm as helpless as a baby.

1087
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:17,550
I got to come clean with you, sweetheart.

1088
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:22,648
It was an outright lie I was giving ya
about me revolver being wet.

1089
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:25,353
You see, I'm not too fond of shootin'.

1090
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:28,522
It's my preference to blow things up.

1091
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:30,998
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1092
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:34,833
and seen all the parts flying off people,

1093
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:38,863
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

1094
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:44,709
And here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

1095
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:48,239
But it's me knife I'll be doing you with.

1096
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:50,979
You killed me mates.

1097
01:19:51,054 --> 01:19:55,514
Someone shoulda told ya - never give
an Irishman good cause for revenge.

1098
01:19:57,493 --> 01:19:59,654
<i>Deadly little Miho.</i>

1099
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:03,261
<i>You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to.</i>

1100
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:06,130
<i>She twists the blade.</i>

1101
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:07,968
<i>He feels it.</i>

1102
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,571
<i>I tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it.</i>

1103
01:20:14,677 --> 01:20:19,137
<i>I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make
the most important call of my life.</i>

1104
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:24,208
<i>First, we gotta rescue Gail,
then comes the kill.</i>

1105
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:28,246
<i>The big, fat kill.</i>

1106
01:20:38,568 --> 01:20:41,435
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1107
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:43,631
What, are you kidding me, man?

1108
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:47,176
I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it.

1109
01:20:47,243 --> 01:20:48,710
I mean, the man's an artist.

1110
01:20:48,811 --> 01:20:53,908
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

1111
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:55,917
Your skin is perfect.

1112
01:20:55,985 --> 01:20:59,079
Your nerves, responsive.

1113
01:20:59,155 --> 01:21:00,452
Beautiful.

1114
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:03,617
Just give them what they want, Gail.

1115
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:10,723
- Becky?
- It's over, Gail.

1116
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:15,200
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

1117
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:17,466
They got what's left of that cop we killed.

1118
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:20,542
The mob's gonna turn it over to the police
chief, the cops are gonna mow us down.

1119
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:22,577
We gotta cut a deal.

1120
01:21:22,645 --> 01:21:26,240
You little bitch!
You sold us out!

1121
01:21:26,315 --> 01:21:29,341
I didn't have no choice!
They was gonna hurt my mom.

1122
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:31,613
You gotta cut a deal with these people.

1123
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:33,814
It's selfish, you holding out like this.

1124
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:36,518
You're gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

1125
01:21:36,592 --> 01:21:39,083
It wasn't your mom!

1126
01:21:39,162 --> 01:21:42,325
We could have protected her
and you know it.

1127
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:45,094
It was the money, you stupid little bitch!

1128
01:21:45,168 --> 01:21:49,070
Sure, there's money. Sure, you could've
moved my mom into Old Town

1129
01:21:49,138 --> 01:21:51,902
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore.

1130
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:54,101
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1131
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:58,943
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me - a way out.

1132
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:00,915
I had to watch out for my own neck.

1133
01:22:00,983 --> 01:22:02,678
Your neck.

1134
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:06,882
Your precious, scrawny, little neck!

1135
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:15,054
You're crazy! You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!

1136
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:20,124
Schutz, fetch my blades.

1137
01:22:20,203 --> 01:22:24,230
- Stuka, kill this one.
- No, I was promised!

1138
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,070
Stupid little bitch!
You deserve worse!

1139
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:30,668
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

1140
01:22:37,854 --> 01:22:39,481
Nobody.
I don't see nobody.

1141
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:43,218
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys, look.

1142
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:46,193
There's something wrapped around it.

1143
01:22:46,262 --> 01:22:47,991
Some kind of note.

1144
01:22:48,064 --> 01:22:50,328
Give it to me.

1145
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:53,300
It's poked right through me.
Guys, look.

1146
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:57,432
- It's starting to really hurt.
- Out back. Everyone.

1147
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,303
And bring the women.

1148
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:02,639
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

1149
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:05,373
McCarthy, you fool.

1150
01:23:09,285 --> 01:23:10,650
Guys?

1151
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:21,458
<i>Dozens of them, armed to the teeth.</i>

1152
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:25,523
<i>I'm outnumbered, outgunned.</i>

1153
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:31,198
<i>But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow.</i>

1154
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:33,935
<i>They can't surround me.</i>

1155
01:23:34,043 --> 01:23:39,174
<i>Sometimes, you can beat the odds
with the careful choice of where to fight.</i>

1156
01:23:43,452 --> 01:23:45,943
You can have Old Town, I don't care.

1157
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:50,681
Just give me the woman.

1158
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,751
Shut up.

1159
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:55,820
Dwight, don't do this.

1160
01:23:55,898 --> 01:24:00,198
- Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right.
- Shut up, or I'll plug you!

1161
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:03,796
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade.

1162
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:05,669
She's all yours.

1163
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:19,418
Now, if you'll explain to me why
we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...

1164
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:23,288
Dwight, what have you done?

1165
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:25,384
Exactly what I had to.

1166
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:29,323
Every step of the way.

1167
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:34,894
No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!

1168
01:24:34,971 --> 01:24:37,371
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1169
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:52,016
<i>Where to fight counts for a lot.</i>

1170
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:56,821
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you no good.

1171
01:24:56,892 --> 01:25:00,919
<i>But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns.</i>

1172
01:25:00,997 --> 01:25:03,898
No!
McCarthy, you shit!

1173
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:09,233
<i>The girls all know the score.</i>

1174
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:15,901
<i>No escape, no surrender, no mercy.</i>

1175
01:25:16,012 --> 01:25:19,914
<i>We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of 'em.</i>

1176
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:22,177
<i>Every last one.</i>

1177
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:26,483
<i>Not for revenge,
not because they deserve it,</i>

1178
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:29,752
<i>not because it'll make
the world a better place.</i>

1179
01:25:30,893 --> 01:25:32,724
<i>We need a heap of bloody bodies</i>

1180
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:36,822
<i>so when mob boss Wallenquist
looks over his charts of profits and losses,</i>

1181
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:41,233
<i>he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town.</i>

1182
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:44,500
<i>The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing</i>

1183
01:25:44,607 --> 01:25:49,977
<i>with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,</i>

1184
01:25:50,046 --> 01:25:52,378
<i>and so am I.</i>

1185
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:59,321
<i>The fire, baby.</i>

1186
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:02,186
<i>It'll burn us both.</i>

1187
01:26:02,258 --> 01:26:06,217
<i>There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire,</i>

1188
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:10,664
<i>my warrior woman, my Valkyrie.</i>

1189
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:13,634
<i>You'll always be mine.</i>

1190
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:15,863
<i>Always...</i>

1191
01:26:15,938 --> 01:26:17,633
<i>and never.</i>

1192
01:26:31,153 --> 01:26:34,213
Evenin', officer.

1193
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:39,317
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?
You read the papers.

1194
01:26:39,428 --> 01:26:42,864
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.

1195
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:46,560
You know who I am and what I can do.

1196
01:26:46,635 --> 01:26:49,365
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan.

1197
01:26:49,438 --> 01:26:52,134
Cold and hard, I'm doing you.

1198
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:54,506
You blew my son's ear off.

1199
01:26:56,112 --> 01:27:01,140
You blew his arm off.
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off.

1200
01:27:03,285 --> 01:27:07,085
He's in a coma right now.
They say he may never come out of it.

1201
01:27:07,189 --> 01:27:09,054
My boy.

1202
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:11,855
He could've been the first Roark to become
the President of the United States,

1203
01:27:11,927 --> 01:27:16,159
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak.

1204
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:20,099
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful?

1205
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:25,067
Power don't come from a badge or a gun.

1206
01:27:25,908 --> 01:27:28,638
Power comes from lying.

1207
01:27:28,711 --> 01:27:33,512
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you.

1208
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:36,608
Once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts ain't true,

1209
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:39,279
you've got 'em by the balls.

1210
01:27:39,388 --> 01:27:44,849
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

1211
01:27:47,029 --> 01:27:51,056
I could pump you full of bullets right now,
and I wouldn't even be arrested.

1212
01:27:51,133 --> 01:27:54,500
Everyone would lie for me -
everyone who counts.

1213
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:57,403
Otherwise, all their own lies -
everything that runs Sin City -

1214
01:27:57,473 --> 01:28:01,432
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

1215
01:28:04,914 --> 01:28:08,350
But I want you firm and fit and healthy.

1216
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:11,477
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

1217
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:14,784
Fix that heart condition of yours.

1218
01:28:16,692 --> 01:28:20,321
You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.

1219
01:28:21,897 --> 01:28:26,960
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy.

1220
01:28:27,036 --> 01:28:29,436
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

1221
01:28:29,505 --> 01:28:33,305
disgraced, destroyed...

1222
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:35,400
alone.

1223
01:28:36,312 --> 01:28:38,280
Your wife?

1224
01:28:38,347 --> 01:28:40,611
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

1225
01:28:40,683 --> 01:28:43,777
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

1226
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:47,451
They won't let me testify.

1227
01:28:47,556 --> 01:28:51,890
I told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like I was crazy.

1228
01:28:51,961 --> 01:28:54,794
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

1229
01:28:54,863 --> 01:28:57,423
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

1230
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:59,967
I told them that you saved me
from that Roark creep,

1231
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:04,199
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

1232
01:29:04,273 --> 01:29:08,869
I'm still a virgin, still alive -
thanks to you.

1233
01:29:09,411 --> 01:29:11,242
They got it all backwards.

1234
01:29:11,313 --> 01:29:14,976
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

1235
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:18,645
But you'll always remember things right.

1236
01:29:18,754 --> 01:29:20,847
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

1237
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:27,484
But stay away, Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

1238
01:29:27,596 --> 01:29:29,587
Don't visit me.

1239
01:29:29,665 --> 01:29:31,462
Don't write me.

1240
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:33,728
Don't even say my name.

1241
01:29:34,169 --> 01:29:38,265
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.

1242
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,331
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia. "

1243
01:29:40,909 --> 01:29:44,936
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

1244
01:29:45,014 --> 01:29:49,417
I'll write you every week... for forever.

1245
01:29:49,485 --> 01:29:52,283
Sure, kid.

1246
01:29:52,388 --> 01:29:54,481
Now, run on home.

1247
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:56,922
It's not safe for you here.

1248
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:03,694
Bye, Nancy.

1249
01:30:06,035 --> 01:30:08,367
I love you.

1250
01:30:16,612 --> 01:30:18,739
John Hartigan.

1251
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:21,606
Mr. Law and Order.

1252
01:30:23,218 --> 01:30:26,119
Mr. By the Book.

1253
01:30:26,221 --> 01:30:28,382
Mr. High and Mighty.

1254
01:30:30,826 --> 01:30:34,159
I gotta give you credit, being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years

1255
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:36,390
without it catching up with you.

1256
01:30:36,465 --> 01:30:39,730
It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.

1257
01:30:39,802 --> 01:30:42,066
It's catching up with you but good.

1258
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,940
Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look too good.

1259
01:30:49,011 --> 01:30:55,416
He's hale and hearty, Tammy. See?

1260
01:30:55,484 --> 01:30:58,851
He's the picture of health.

1261
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:02,321
That Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?

1262
01:31:02,424 --> 01:31:04,688
I rented her out of Old Town.

1263
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:09,424
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison.

1264
01:31:09,498 --> 01:31:10,863
You hear me, Hartigan?

1265
01:31:10,933 --> 01:31:14,630
If you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

1266
01:31:14,703 --> 01:31:17,570
you might just get some of Tammy.

1267
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:21,336
You see that?
She flinched.

1268
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:23,742
You make her sick.

1269
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:26,610
She heard about you and that little girl.

1270
01:31:26,682 --> 01:31:31,051
<i>This is nothing but a price I promised
myself I'd pay, and I'm paying it.</i>

1271
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:35,523
<i>You don't save a little girl's life, then
turn around and throw her to the dogs.</i>

1272
01:31:35,591 --> 01:31:37,582
<i>Not in my book, you don't.</i>

1273
01:31:37,693 --> 01:31:41,129
<i>They want a confession.
They won't get it.</i>

1274
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:48,125
<i>There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary.</i>

1275
01:31:48,203 --> 01:31:51,297
<i>She calls herself "Cordelia,"
just like she promised.</i>

1276
01:31:51,373 --> 01:31:55,139
<i>She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away.</i>

1277
01:31:56,078 --> 01:31:58,205
<i>At first, I figure
she'll send another note or two</i>

1278
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:01,511
<i>before her young mind
moves on to better things.</i>

1279
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:04,848
<i>But every Thursday, another one arrives.</i>

1280
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:06,750
<i>What a sweet kid.</i>

1281
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:11,224
<i>I do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when I reach for it.</i>

1282
01:32:11,293 --> 01:32:15,730
<i>She's the only friend I've got -
the daughter I never had.</i>

1283
01:32:15,831 --> 01:32:17,822
<i>My sweet Cordelia.</i>

1284
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:20,494
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

1285
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:24,795
<i>Eight years pass.</i>

1286
01:32:29,178 --> 01:32:32,170
<i>Then comes a Thursday
when I bound from my cot,</i>

1287
01:32:32,247 --> 01:32:34,272
<i>excited as a kid at Christmas,</i>

1288
01:32:34,349 --> 01:32:37,944
<i>only to find myself
staring at the damn floor of my damn cell,</i>

1289
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:41,217
<i>looking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there.</i>

1290
01:32:41,824 --> 01:32:44,258
<i>Then another Thursday with no letter.</i>

1291
01:32:44,326 --> 01:32:46,191
<i>Is she all right?</i>

1292
01:32:46,261 --> 01:32:48,661
<i>Did something happen to her?</i>

1293
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:51,255
<i>Nothing.</i>

1294
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:55,030
<i>Two months now -
not a word from Nancy.</i>

1295
01:32:55,103 --> 01:32:58,539
<i>Did they find her?
Did they get to her?</i>

1296
01:32:58,607 --> 01:33:02,065
<i>Of course!
Stupid old man.</i>

1297
01:33:02,144 --> 01:33:05,773
<i>Do your math.
Nancy's 19 years old.</i>

1298
01:33:05,848 --> 01:33:08,339
<i>How long did you expect her
to keep writing?</i>

1299
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:12,114
<i>She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did.</i>

1300
01:33:12,221 --> 01:33:15,281
<i>She's forgotten you, old man.</i>

1301
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:17,358
<i>You're alone.</i>

1302
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:19,826
<i>You're all alone.</i>

1303
01:33:27,302 --> 01:33:31,204
<i>This guy smells awful -
like bad food.</i>

1304
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:34,674
<i>Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer.</i>

1305
01:33:34,743 --> 01:33:36,938
<i>He stinks so bad, I want to throw up.</i>

1306
01:33:47,856 --> 01:33:50,916
<i>Practically knocked my head off,
the bastard.</i>

1307
01:33:51,493 --> 01:33:53,825
<i>When I come to, I see it.</i>

1308
01:33:53,896 --> 01:33:57,161
<i>The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses,</i>

1309
01:33:57,232 --> 01:33:59,700
<i>but there's no letter inside of it.</i>

1310
01:33:59,768 --> 01:34:01,793
<i>There's something soft,</i>

1311
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:05,806
<i>something that ought to be alive -
a hunk of meat and bone</i>

1312
01:34:05,874 --> 01:34:09,970
<i>that ought to be the index finger
of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl.</i>

1313
01:34:10,045 --> 01:34:12,172
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1314
01:34:12,247 --> 01:34:14,044
<i>She was so careful.</i>

1315
01:34:14,116 --> 01:34:16,983
<i>She never gave away
where she lives or where she works.</i>

1316
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:25,526
<i>I've got to get out.
I've got to help her.</i>

1317
01:34:25,627 --> 01:34:30,724
<i>Nothing else matters -
not my life and not my pride, either.</i>

1318
01:34:30,799 --> 01:34:33,393
<i>It's only one final surrender they want.</i>

1319
01:34:33,468 --> 01:34:37,165
<i>You got me, Roark.
You beat me.</i>

1320
01:34:37,806 --> 01:34:41,401
<i>I say everything they want to hear,
just the way they want to hear it.</i>

1321
01:34:41,476 --> 01:34:44,912
<i>I tell them I'm a twisted,
wretched child molester.</i>

1322
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:48,381
<i>I agree to everything they want from me.</i>

1323
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:50,509
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

1324
01:35:02,297 --> 01:35:04,993
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.

1325
01:35:07,636 --> 01:35:12,232
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me.

1326
01:35:12,307 --> 01:35:16,209
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

1327
01:35:16,278 --> 01:35:18,803
Christ.

1328
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,713
Eight years.

1329
01:35:26,455 --> 01:35:29,424
Well, if it's any consolation to you...

1330
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:33,454
you made me hate myself.

1331
01:35:35,964 --> 01:35:39,195
Any word from Eileen?

1332
01:35:39,568 --> 01:35:43,436
She got remarried four years ago.

1333
01:35:45,774 --> 01:35:49,938
She had two kids.
I'm sorry, John.

1334
01:35:50,012 --> 01:35:52,037
Don't be.

1335
01:35:52,114 --> 01:35:54,605
I'm glad.

1336
01:35:54,683 --> 01:35:57,880
Eileen always wanted kids.

1337
01:35:57,953 --> 01:35:59,887
She'll make a good mother.

1338
01:36:01,857 --> 01:36:06,191
Like you said, Bob -
water under the bridge.

1339
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:20,406
<i>Bob and I get on
with our fond farewells to each other,</i>

1340
01:36:20,475 --> 01:36:24,673
<i>then I go looking for the only human being
on the planet who means a damn to me -</i>

1341
01:36:24,746 --> 01:36:26,145
<i>Nancy.</i>

1342
01:36:26,214 --> 01:36:29,672
<i>How could they have found out it was you
writing all those letters to me?</i>

1343
01:36:30,085 --> 01:36:32,519
<i>How did they find out who you are?</i>

1344
01:36:32,621 --> 01:36:35,749
<i>And what have they done to you, baby?</i>

1345
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:41,622
<i>Not a sound.</i>

1346
01:36:41,697 --> 01:36:44,427
<i>No sign of life.</i>

1347
01:36:44,499 --> 01:36:48,230
<i>Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man,</i>

1348
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:52,069
<i>like a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?</i>

1349
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,938
<i>What has he done to Nancy?</i>

1350
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:57,740
<i>It's like all she ever does
is read and study and write.</i>

1351
01:36:58,146 --> 01:37:03,174
<i>No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere.</i>

1352
01:37:04,219 --> 01:37:08,178
<i>Closest thing to a clue
is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon.</i>

1353
01:37:08,924 --> 01:37:13,520
<i>It's a long shot,
but maybe she's got some friends there.</i>

1354
01:37:20,135 --> 01:37:22,330
<i>A dead end.</i>

1355
01:37:22,404 --> 01:37:26,101
<i>Nancy wouldn't have anything to do
with a pack of drunks and losers like this.</i>

1356
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:30,110
<i>But if there's anything to be found here,
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is</i>

1357
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:33,238
<i>or whoever kidnapped her
and mutilated her, this is the place.</i>

1358
01:37:33,648 --> 01:37:38,347
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. I'm looking for somebody.

1359
01:37:38,453 --> 01:37:41,752
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.

1360
01:37:41,857 --> 01:37:44,724
It's not like that.
Her name is Nancy.

1361
01:37:44,793 --> 01:37:47,261
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.

1362
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:50,593
She's just warming up.

1363
01:37:58,673 --> 01:38:01,608
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

1364
01:38:01,676 --> 01:38:03,576
<i>She grew up.</i>

1365
01:38:03,645 --> 01:38:06,580
<i>She filled out.</i>

1366
01:38:06,648 --> 01:38:10,277
<i>Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.</i>

1367
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:15,280
<i>And here I was,
expecting a skinny little bookworm,</i>

1368
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:19,156
<i>maybe a bit too shy for her own good.</i>

1369
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:25,132
<i>How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years.</i>

1370
01:38:29,304 --> 01:38:31,670
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1371
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:34,265
<i>Then it hits me.</i>

1372
01:38:34,342 --> 01:38:36,606
<i>They were bluffing.</i>

1373
01:38:37,445 --> 01:38:40,346
<i>I've led them straight to her.</i>

1374
01:38:48,657 --> 01:38:51,649
<i>She hasn't spotted you yet.</i>

1375
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,285
<i>Turn around and walk out the door.</i>

1376
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,125
<i>Lead the creep outside.</i>

1377
01:38:57,199 --> 01:39:02,398
<i>Get that Beretta away from him somehow,
and kill him.</i>

1378
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:06,429
<i>I'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer.</i>

1379
01:39:06,508 --> 01:39:09,477
<i>Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.</i>

1380
01:39:10,212 --> 01:39:13,010
<i>No, Nancy.
Don't notice me.</i>

1381
01:39:13,081 --> 01:39:16,448
<i>Don't recognize me.</i>

1382
01:39:26,194 --> 01:39:28,185
There's no time to explain.

1383
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,288
I've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger.

1384
01:39:31,366 --> 01:39:33,732
We need to get out of here
right this second.

1385
01:39:33,802 --> 01:39:37,670
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

1386
01:39:39,774 --> 01:39:44,609
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters.

1387
01:39:44,679 --> 01:39:47,079
Kept me going.

1388
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:50,648
Kept me from killing myself.

1389
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,379
Hurry up, will you?

1390
01:40:00,061 --> 01:40:02,894
- Maybe I should drive.
- Not a chance.

1391
01:40:03,698 --> 01:40:06,462
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

1392
01:40:12,274 --> 01:40:15,937
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody.

1393
01:40:16,011 --> 01:40:19,003
- I don't have a gun.
- Under the seat.

1394
01:40:20,649 --> 01:40:22,480
It's loaded and it works.

1395
01:40:24,486 --> 01:40:27,114
Yeah, this'll do.

1396
01:40:27,222 --> 01:40:30,680
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

1397
01:40:34,829 --> 01:40:40,096
Hartigan, there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

1398
01:40:40,168 --> 01:40:42,728
You've never been far from my thoughts.

1399
01:40:42,804 --> 01:40:46,433
I've lain awake nights, thinking of you.

1400
01:40:46,508 --> 01:40:49,306
What are you talking about?

1401
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:54,144
Keep driving, Nancy.
Keep driving and keep the car on the road!

1402
01:40:56,952 --> 01:40:58,886
<i>She's counting on you, old man.</i>

1403
01:40:58,954 --> 01:41:00,717
What are you doing?

1404
01:41:00,822 --> 01:41:03,222
<i>Prove you're still worth a damn.</i>

1405
01:41:09,197 --> 01:41:11,893
Try and keep it on the road, Nancy!

1406
01:41:14,669 --> 01:41:16,330
<i>He's a decent shot.</i>

1407
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:19,305
<i>He's got skill,
but he's in too much of a hurry.</i>

1408
01:41:19,374 --> 01:41:22,366
<i>Throwing away bullets
like they were candy.</i>

1409
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:28,473
<i>He doesn't know how to take his time.</i>

1410
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:31,849
<i>Aim careful and look the devil in the eye.</i>

1411
01:41:40,395 --> 01:41:42,761
Stop the car, Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

1412
01:41:42,831 --> 01:41:44,924
- What?
- Stop the car, now!

1413
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,094
Right.
Stop the car, confirm the kill.

1414
01:41:54,743 --> 01:41:57,610
Sorry. I got a little rattled.

1415
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,945
It's OK. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

1416
01:42:02,017 --> 01:42:04,212
No!
Let me stay close.

1417
01:42:04,285 --> 01:42:06,810
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

1418
01:42:06,921 --> 01:42:10,084
Please?
Let me stay close.

1419
01:42:19,734 --> 01:42:23,500
<i>The stink - I almost gag.</i>

1420
01:42:23,571 --> 01:42:25,505
<i>His blood smells
even worse than he does.</i>

1421
01:42:25,573 --> 01:42:28,565
<i>- Jesus.
- And it's all over the place.</i>

1422
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:33,137
<i>But the creep himself, he's gone.</i>

1423
01:42:33,214 --> 01:42:35,273
We're out of time.

1424
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:39,810
<i>The sirens - I used to welcome the sound.</i>

1425
01:42:40,355 --> 01:42:43,222
<i>There's nothing to do now
but find a place to hole up for the night,</i>

1426
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:47,057
<i>get Nancy calmed down, and figure out
what on Earth I'm going to do next.</i>

1427
01:42:47,128 --> 01:42:50,689
<i>The stink - somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel.</i>

1428
01:42:51,466 --> 01:42:53,491
Nancy, I went to your apartment.

1429
01:42:53,568 --> 01:42:57,504
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

1430
01:42:57,572 --> 01:42:59,836
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

1431
01:42:59,908 --> 01:43:03,674
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!

1432
01:43:03,745 --> 01:43:07,374
I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.

1433
01:43:07,449 --> 01:43:11,078
But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.

1434
01:43:11,152 --> 01:43:13,712
- I'm such an asshole.
- You should sit down.

1435
01:43:14,956 --> 01:43:17,925
You'll feel a little bit better if you sit down.

1436
01:43:18,593 --> 01:43:20,891
<i>I've never been all that good with people.</i>

1437
01:43:20,962 --> 01:43:24,329
<i>When it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 19-year-old,</i>

1438
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:28,301
<i>I'm as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.</i>

1439
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:31,270
It's always been you, Hartigan.

1440
01:43:31,339 --> 01:43:33,307
All these years.

1441
01:43:34,409 --> 01:43:37,071
It's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy.

1442
01:43:37,145 --> 01:43:40,376
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

1443
01:43:40,448 --> 01:43:43,645
- Sleep with me.
- Stop it, Nancy!

1444
01:43:44,085 --> 01:43:46,178
Eight years.

1445
01:43:46,287 --> 01:43:49,882
Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?

1446
01:43:49,991 --> 01:43:52,152
It wasn't just gratitude.

1447
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:55,354
I tried to fall in love with boys.

1448
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:57,796
Even thought I did once or twice.

1449
01:43:57,866 --> 01:44:01,893
But I was already in love... with you.

1450
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:04,666
That's enough.
Jesus Christ!

1451
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:07,071
I'm old enough to be your grandfather!

1452
01:44:07,142 --> 01:44:09,838
- You're just scared.
- I'm not scared.

1453
01:44:10,545 --> 01:44:12,274
No.

1454
01:44:47,482 --> 01:44:50,679
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

1455
01:44:50,752 --> 01:44:53,277
For God's sakes, you're just a kid!

1456
01:44:54,222 --> 01:44:56,281
I love you.

1457
01:45:00,929 --> 01:45:03,397
I love you, too.

1458
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:05,364
With all my heart.

1459
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:09,831
<i>Cold shower- it helps.</i>

1460
01:45:09,904 --> 01:45:11,201
No, Nancy.

1461
01:45:14,742 --> 01:45:17,006
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?

1462
01:45:17,078 --> 01:45:20,912
Recognize my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

1463
01:45:20,982 --> 01:45:24,816
I look different,
but I bet you can recognize my voice.

1464
01:45:24,886 --> 01:45:28,879
Sure.
I recognize your voice, Junior.

1465
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,428
<i>Everything's gone straight to hell.</i>

1466
01:45:34,529 --> 01:45:36,963
<i>I've been suckered
into betraying the only friend I've got,</i>

1467
01:45:37,031 --> 01:45:40,728
<i>and put her in the hands of a murdering
rapist I thought I'd put down for good.</i>

1468
01:45:41,336 --> 01:45:44,999
<i>Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator.</i>

1469
01:45:45,073 --> 01:45:47,064
<i>It's all gone to hell.</i>

1470
01:45:47,141 --> 01:45:49,109
Klump, it's me.

1471
01:45:49,177 --> 01:45:52,044
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

1472
01:45:52,113 --> 01:45:54,138
I want you to set me up for a party.

1473
01:45:54,215 --> 01:45:56,649
I've already got the girl, you dumb shit!

1474
01:45:56,718 --> 01:45:59,585
Hey, it better be perfect
or I'm calling my dad!

1475
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:02,178
My tools better be clean and sharp.

1476
01:46:02,290 --> 01:46:05,020
It better be ready!
It better be perfect!

1477
01:46:06,928 --> 01:46:12,457
I get to do whatever I want,
however I want, whenever I want it!

1478
01:46:13,001 --> 01:46:16,266
My dad - I'd love him if I didn't hate him.

1479
01:46:16,337 --> 01:46:19,101
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

1480
01:46:19,173 --> 01:46:22,370
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs,

1481
01:46:22,443 --> 01:46:26,812
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid.

1482
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:30,874
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.

1483
01:46:30,952 --> 01:46:33,147
I'm not complaining, though.
Since you've been gone,

1484
01:46:33,254 --> 01:46:34,983
I've been having the time of my life.

1485
01:46:35,089 --> 01:46:38,581
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.

1486
01:46:38,693 --> 01:46:40,786
We all wondered
who wrote all those letters.

1487
01:46:40,895 --> 01:46:42,863
She left not a clue.

1488
01:46:44,232 --> 01:46:47,497
Clever girl.
And so pretty, so pretty.

1489
01:46:50,171 --> 01:46:54,164
A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.

1490
01:46:54,242 --> 01:46:57,439
Nancy, don't scream.

1491
01:46:57,512 --> 01:46:59,912
Whatever he does to you, don't scream.

1492
01:46:59,981 --> 01:47:04,315
She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.

1493
01:47:04,385 --> 01:47:07,718
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.

1494
01:47:07,822 --> 01:47:10,484
They've all screamed, Hartigan.

1495
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:13,389
Dozens of them - maybe a hundred.

1496
01:47:13,461 --> 01:47:16,624
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

1497
01:47:16,698 --> 01:47:18,962
And if there weren't
so many people hereabout,

1498
01:47:19,033 --> 01:47:23,026
I would show you how
I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream.

1499
01:47:23,104 --> 01:47:25,800
It's gonna be one hell of a show!

1500
01:47:34,849 --> 01:47:38,478
<i>This is it.
No way to fight it now.</i>

1501
01:47:38,553 --> 01:47:40,612
<i>No hope left.</i>

1502
01:47:40,722 --> 01:47:42,451
<i>No chance.</i>

1503
01:47:42,557 --> 01:47:46,357
<i>This is it.
This is the end.</i>

1504
01:47:49,097 --> 01:47:50,189
<i>No.</i>

1505
01:47:50,832 --> 01:47:55,098
<i>Give it a shot, old man.
Keep your neck tight. Move.</i>

1506
01:47:55,169 --> 01:47:59,037
<i>The window - maybe there's an alarm.</i>

1507
01:47:59,107 --> 01:48:01,769
<i>Keep your neck tight, goddamn it!
Stay conscious!</i>

1508
01:48:01,843 --> 01:48:04,641
<i>Stay conscious.</i>

1509
01:48:04,712 --> 01:48:05,906
<i>No alarm.</i>

1510
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:08,744
<i>The glass! Cut the rope.</i>

1511
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:11,649
<i>You can do it.</i>

1512
01:48:11,719 --> 01:48:13,414
It is inclement upon me

1513
01:48:13,521 --> 01:48:17,855
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

1514
01:48:17,925 --> 01:48:24,694
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car to heist, Mr. Shlubb.

1515
01:48:24,766 --> 01:48:30,432
Irrelevant to said mission is the following
query, which I now put forth to you.

1516
01:48:30,972 --> 01:48:36,672
Wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports -

1517
01:48:36,744 --> 01:48:39,304
boner-inspiring though it may be -

1518
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:44,283
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

1519
01:48:47,722 --> 01:48:51,123
I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.

1520
01:48:55,663 --> 01:48:59,326
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!

1521
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,095
In plain English, creep!

1522
01:49:01,169 --> 01:49:04,935
The answer you seek is rural,
even agrarian.

1523
01:49:06,274 --> 01:49:08,367
The farm!

1524
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:12,179
<i>That's all I need to hear.
Every cop on the force</i>

1525
01:49:12,246 --> 01:49:16,342
<i>knows about the Roark family's farm
and to stay away from it.</i>

1526
01:49:16,451 --> 01:49:18,715
<i>Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal.</i>

1527
01:49:18,786 --> 01:49:21,914
<i>Once things get loud,
I'll probably have use for the cannons.</i>

1528
01:49:22,023 --> 01:49:24,992
<i>But at first, I'll have to play it quiet.</i>

1529
01:49:25,059 --> 01:49:27,289
<i>Quiet and nasty.</i>

1530
01:49:27,862 --> 01:49:31,229
<i>Nancy's car- six miles from the farm.</i>

1531
01:49:31,299 --> 01:49:34,564
<i>"Nobody but me can keep
this heap running, " she told me.</i>

1532
01:49:34,635 --> 01:49:38,127
<i>Good girl.
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard</i>

1533
01:49:38,206 --> 01:49:40,572
<i>and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again.</i>

1534
01:49:40,641 --> 01:49:44,577
<i>You kept your mouth shut.
I'll bet Junior was furious.</i>

1535
01:49:44,645 --> 01:49:47,239
<i>I'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce.</i>

1536
01:49:47,315 --> 01:49:51,274
<i>But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes.</i>

1537
01:49:51,352 --> 01:49:53,582
<i>There's still a chance, Nancy.</i>

1538
01:49:53,688 --> 01:49:55,656
<i>Don't scream.</i>

1539
01:49:56,724 --> 01:50:00,285
<i>I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm
and make my way through the woods.</i>

1540
01:50:00,828 --> 01:50:04,320
<i>I'm not halfway there when it hits.</i>

1541
01:50:05,266 --> 01:50:08,861
<i>My heart.
Can't be my heart.</i>

1542
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:11,769
<i>I was cured.</i>

1543
01:50:11,839 --> 01:50:14,865
<i>Bad cough - blood in it.</i>

1544
01:50:15,376 --> 01:50:17,003
<i>Doesn't matter now.</i>

1545
01:50:17,078 --> 01:50:20,241
<i>I don't have to stay alive
that much longer, anyway.</i>

1546
01:50:24,919 --> 01:50:27,387
<i>Rotten way to kill a man, but it's quiet.</i>

1547
01:50:33,361 --> 01:50:36,455
<i>Hate yourself later.</i>

1548
01:50:48,075 --> 01:50:51,101
You're only making this worse for yourself,
you stupid cow!

1549
01:51:00,154 --> 01:51:02,588
Do you think I'm tired?

1550
01:51:02,657 --> 01:51:04,784
Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

1551
01:51:04,892 --> 01:51:07,292
You're the one who's gonna crack!

1552
01:51:07,361 --> 01:51:09,329
You'll crack!

1553
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:12,456
You'll cry and beg!

1554
01:51:12,533 --> 01:51:14,262
You'll scream!

1555
01:51:14,335 --> 01:51:19,068
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!

1556
01:51:26,247 --> 01:51:28,807
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?

1557
01:51:29,417 --> 01:51:31,908
That was foreplay.

1558
01:51:32,987 --> 01:51:35,922
Hartigan was right about you.

1559
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:38,458
You can't get it up unless I scream.

1560
01:51:40,127 --> 01:51:41,890
You're pathetic!

1561
01:51:43,197 --> 01:51:45,290
You're pathetic.

1562
01:51:47,668 --> 01:51:50,762
It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.

1563
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:54,707
It brings out the worst in me.

1564
01:52:01,248 --> 01:52:03,011
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1565
01:52:03,084 --> 01:52:05,245
<i>In too much of a hurry.</i>

1566
01:52:06,887 --> 01:52:09,788
Damn!
It can't be!

1567
01:52:10,291 --> 01:52:13,783
<i>Charging in like Galahad,
just like I told myself I wouldn't!</i>

1568
01:52:13,894 --> 01:52:15,191
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1569
01:52:15,262 --> 01:52:19,460
- You tagged him good!
- Don't take no chances. Perforate the fool.

1570
01:52:24,205 --> 01:52:26,036
Good advice.

1571
01:52:36,283 --> 01:52:38,513
Give it up, Junior.

1572
01:52:38,586 --> 01:52:40,577
It's over.
Let her go.

1573
01:52:40,688 --> 01:52:42,383
You're dreaming, Hartigan!

1574
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:47,427
I get to see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you!

1575
01:52:47,495 --> 01:52:50,692
Look at you!
You're about to keel over!

1576
01:52:50,765 --> 01:52:53,529
You can't even lift that cannon!

1577
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:55,967
Sure, I can.

1578
01:53:02,843 --> 01:53:05,505
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.

1579
01:53:05,579 --> 01:53:08,514
Nancy, I'm sorry.

1580
01:53:09,216 --> 01:53:12,014
I'm taking no chances with you.

1581
01:53:14,555 --> 01:53:18,047
First I soften you up,
and then it's showtime.

1582
01:53:21,295 --> 01:53:23,729
Here it comes.

1583
01:53:25,332 --> 01:53:27,163
It's gonna hurt.

1584
01:53:27,234 --> 01:53:29,259
You're right about that.

1585
01:53:33,107 --> 01:53:35,041
Sucker.

1586
01:53:38,312 --> 01:53:40,109
<i>I take away his weapon.</i>

1587
01:53:42,049 --> 01:53:43,414
<i>Both of them.</i>

1588
01:53:55,262 --> 01:53:58,925
Eight long years, son of a bitch!

1589
01:53:59,967 --> 01:54:03,926
<i>After a while, all I'm doing is pounding
wet chunks of bone into the floorboards,</i>

1590
01:54:04,004 --> 01:54:05,198
<i>so I stop.</i>

1591
01:54:06,741 --> 01:54:09,232
So long, Junior.

1592
01:54:09,310 --> 01:54:11,835
Been a pleasure.

1593
01:54:17,218 --> 01:54:20,710
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.

1594
01:54:22,156 --> 01:54:23,714
I didn't scream.

1595
01:54:23,824 --> 01:54:25,951
I know it, baby.

1596
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:28,392
You grew up strong.

1597
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:43,207
<i>By the time I get her to the car,
Nancy stops shaking.</i>

1598
01:54:43,277 --> 01:54:47,213
<i>Her skin is warm again.
She's herself again.</i>

1599
01:54:47,281 --> 01:54:49,749
Thanks for remembering my coat.

1600
01:54:51,085 --> 01:54:53,178
And for all the little things.

1601
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:57,346
Like saving my life, twice.

1602
01:54:58,392 --> 01:55:01,384
- You better get rolling.
- You're not coming along?

1603
01:55:01,495 --> 01:55:06,455
No. I have friends on their way,
to collect evidence.

1604
01:55:06,534 --> 01:55:09,264
I'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open.

1605
01:55:09,336 --> 01:55:11,668
I'm gonna clear my name.

1606
01:55:11,739 --> 01:55:15,800
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs.

1607
01:55:15,876 --> 01:55:19,505
I can't lose you, not again.

1608
01:55:21,882 --> 01:55:24,874
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

1609
01:55:37,598 --> 01:55:41,398
<i>Nancy Callahan, the love of my life.</i>

1610
01:55:42,803 --> 01:55:47,297
<i>Shame to lie to her.
I hope she forgives me for it.</i>

1611
01:55:47,374 --> 01:55:50,969
<i>Get Senator Roark behind bars?
Sure.</i>

1612
01:55:51,045 --> 01:55:54,606
<i>And maybe after I've pulled off
that miracle, I'll go and punch out God.</i>

1613
01:55:54,682 --> 01:55:58,482
<i>There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark.</i>

1614
01:55:58,552 --> 01:56:00,645
<i>I killed his only son.</i>

1615
01:56:00,754 --> 01:56:02,847
<i>The bloodline is cut.</i>

1616
01:56:02,957 --> 01:56:05,755
<i>Roark's lost his goddamn legacy.</i>

1617
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:08,656
<i>He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me.</i>

1618
01:56:08,729 --> 01:56:12,324
<i>He'll go after me through Nancy.
He'll find her again.</i>

1619
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,893
<i>There'll be no end to it.</i>

1620
01:56:14,969 --> 01:56:17,164
<i>She'll never be safe.</i>

1621
01:56:17,238 --> 01:56:19,832
<i>Not as long as I'm alive.</i>

1622
01:56:19,907 --> 01:56:22,501
<i>There's only one way to beat him.</i>

1623
01:56:23,143 --> 01:56:25,805
<i>An old man dies,</i>

1624
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:28,110
<i>a young woman lives.</i>

1625
01:56:29,216 --> 01:56:31,480
<i>Fair trade.</i>

1626
01:56:34,455 --> 01:56:37,390
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

1627
01:56:44,365 --> 01:56:46,424
Yes.

1628
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,866
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

1629
01:56:48,936 --> 01:56:54,101
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

1630
01:56:54,174 --> 01:56:57,769
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

1631
01:56:57,845 --> 01:57:00,211
It should be right as rain in no time.

1632
01:57:19,466 --> 01:57:22,799
<i>Turn the right corner in Sin City</i>

1633
01:57:22,870 --> 01:57:27,364
<i>and you can find anything.</i>

1634
01:57:27,441 --> 01:57:29,136
Becky.

1635
01:57:31,178 --> 01:57:33,840
Care for a smoke?

1636
01:57:35,883 --> 01:57:38,113
Love you, too, Mom.

1637
01:57:40,421 --> 01:57:41,388
<i>Anything.</i>
