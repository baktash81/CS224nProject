00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,309
You ever have nightmares?

188
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,562
- Just the usual kind, you know,

189
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,898
falling, childhood
monsters, things like that.

190
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:49,525
- Plus all the dreams you've forgotten.

191
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,901
- Not these dreams, Doctor.

192
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,778
You don't forget these dreams.

193
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,948
- Okay, the centrepiece
for your dreams is a woman.

194
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,367
The same woman.

195
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,911
The method of murder is different, right?

196
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,829
- Right.

197
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,997
- [Dr. Frieberg] Do you
recognise the woman?

198
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,416
- Not consciously.

199
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,794
- Do you see yourself in the dream?

200
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,337
- I don't think so.
- Then why do you think

201
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:11,964
you're doing the killing?

202
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,841
- I don't see it, I feel it.

203
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,136
It's hard to explain.

204
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:22,224
Um, I feel myself walking
down that hallway.

205
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,145
I feel myself in the body,

206
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,397
moving into the bathroom.

207
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,734
No, I'm the one who's doing those murders.

208
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,529
I woke up and I was actually
choking the woman next to me.

209
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,448
- Well, that could be
a simple reflex action.

210
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,326
See, dreams that generate
this kind of powerful emotion,

211
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,954
occasionally will manifest themselves

212
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,914
with equally strong kinetic activity.

213
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,501
Tell me about the other dream.

214
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,546
- Oh, it was a knife.

215
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,463
Jagged edge.

216
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:55,924
I saw my hand-

217
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,552
- Or somebody's hand.
- But it felt like,

218
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,888
I felt like it was me doing the stabbing.

219
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,391
- Did it give you pleasure?

220
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,476
- No, it scared me.

221
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,396
I, the woman's scream woke me up.

222
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,939
- So the dream frightens you.

223
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,401
You don't associate the
murder with pleasure.

224
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,488
I wouldn't worry about it.

225
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,740
There's no way that I'm gonna interpret

226
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,325
that you're harbouring some

227
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:25,537
bizarre homicidal tendencies
in your subconscious.

228
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,331
It could be something very complicated

229
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,082
or something as simple as stress.

230
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,961
Any case, I'm glad you
decided to talk to somebody.

231
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,672
- What about a CAT scan?

232
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:36,798
- Well, CAT scans are for people

233
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,258
with serious brain problems.

234
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,637
What you need is a good night's sleep.

235
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,805
Don't deliberately try to stay awake.

236
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,224
Don't shy away from the dream.

237
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,226
Chances are you may
not even have it again,

238
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,146
but if you do, don't fight the damn thing,

239
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,523

You're not thrilled to see me?

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,008
- Not a good day. What's up?

247
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,134
- You're out of salami,

248
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,262
your Jack cheese is growing green fur,

249
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,888
you got no lettuce,

250
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,307
and you need mayo and tomato.

251
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,892
- I'm glad you're enjoying your dinner.

252
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,394
- Where you been all evening?

253
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,315
Hot date or something?

254
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,401
- Right.
- Why didn't ya

255
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,361
bring her home? [chuckles]
[water bed sloshing]

256
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,363
- I was with a shrink, Phil.

257
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,073
- I hear they're give good head.

258
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:44,992
- Do me a favor pal-

259
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,495
- Shut up and get the fuck outta here.

260
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,372
- Just shut up,

261
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,252
and, ah, spend the night here, okay?

262
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,462
- Okay.

263
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,886
- So this dream thing's
really got you paranoid.

264
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,097
- I'm just curious.

265
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,598
The shrink couldn't help me out.

266
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,142
I've gotta draw my own conclusions.

267
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,059
- Which are?

268
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,772
- Maybe I'm not just dreaming.

269
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:16,690
- Okay.

270
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,694

[ominous music]

272
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,533
I checked newspaper articles
going back three years.

273
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:30,829
No pictures, no mention of a
girl like her being murdered.

274
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,331
- Okay.

275
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,957
- So that rules out my being influenced

276
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,710
by something that I've seen or read.

277
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,004
- With the exception of "Friday the 13th"

278
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,340
"Jagged Edge" and about 500 other movies.

279
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,299
- No, no.

280
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,426
This dream is too consistent in detail.

Everything.

288

Who's thinking about
planning to kill that girl.

289

What if I'm somehow
intercepting his thoughts?

290

Palma should get together.

00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,563
- Sure, why not? That's all
you've done since you walked up.

546
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,816
- Have you had any kind
of odd dreams lately?

547
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,277
You know, different than usual?

548
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,945
- My dreams are all exactly the same.

549
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,155
Dull colors.

550
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,950
Are you finished now, Dr. Freud?

551
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:07,705
- So you wouldn't know this girl's name?

552
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,124
- Or her address or her astrological sign

553
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,042
or anything else.

554
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:14,879
I suggest you find
somebody else to obsess on.

555
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,591
- Well, my studio is pretty nearby here.

556
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,135
If you do happen to
remember anything about her,

557
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:22,511
would you at least give me a call?

- Oh, I didn't bring any wine or anything.

563
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,394
- Well wine I got. Come on in.

564
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,270

- I think so.

567
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,027
I'm just surprised you
invited me to dinner.

568
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,028
- Why?

569
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,364
- Because I'm a one night kind of girl,

570
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,033
I usually get invited to
dinner before, not after.

571
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,201
- Well with me, it's different.

572
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,286
Come on, sit down.

574

Tonight, we got to Greece.

575
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,458
First stop, the Island of Corfu,

576
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,794
where the chef recommends peasant salad

577
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,338
and vine leaves stuffed with rice.

578

[Lena laughs]
Calamari.

579
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:42,633

Mm. [chuckles]

584
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,650
- I got a little something for ya.

585
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,068
- Designer condoms, right?

586
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,737
- [chuckles] Lena, it wouldn't kill you

587
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,739
just to be a tiny bit romantic.

588
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:06,949
Come on, open it.

[romantic guitar music]

590
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:09,827
Put it on.

591
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,329
- It's beautiful.

592
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:12,538
But why?

593
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:15,416
- I just felt terrible
about the other night,

594
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,793
and I wanted to do something
to make it up to you.

595
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,670
- Scott, you didn't have to do that.

596
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,005
I was yours for the taking.

598
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,300
Thank you.

604
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,451

- 730</i>

606
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,580
Time to you make a living?

607
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:58,376
Listen, next time dinner's on me.

608
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,587
If there's no next time,
thanks, it was great.

Well, are you Scott Bruin?

634
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,354
- Yes.

635
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:44,064
- My name is Kimberly Shawn.

636
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,774
And I want you to tell
the man who hired you

637
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,318
that he's wasting his money

638
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,360
because we're through

639
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,404
and he's never going to see me again.

640
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:51,363
It's over.

641
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,073
It's been over for a year

642
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:55,159
and hiring two-bit private Dick's

643
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,368
won't do him any good.

644
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:57,536
You tell him that for me.

645
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:58,537
All right?

646
00:33:58,746 --> 00:33:59,914
- Wait, wait, wait.

- Keep your hands off me.

- I'm sorry.

649
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,961
But it isn't like you think.

650
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,796
- Just give him my message.

651
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,298
- Who?

652
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,926
- Is he also paying you to act stupid?

653
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,887
- No, no, nobody's paying me for anything.

654
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,973
I'm not, I'm not a private investigator.

655
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:18,933
- Right.

656
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,519
- I'm telling you the
truth. I'm a photographer.

657
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:22,478
Really, look.

658
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:28,692

in, I could prove it to ya.

662
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,077

666
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:54,593
All right.

667
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,512
Let's say you are a photographer.

668
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,347
Why are you trying to find me?

669
00:34:58,556 --> 00:34:59,682
- I'm not.

670
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,976
II mean, I wasn't, II...

671
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,520
Okay, I bought a T-shirt
that had your face on it

672
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,064
and I thought you had an interesting look.

673
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,482
I'm a fashion photographer.

674
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,860
And I asked the guy who
painted it, who you were?

675
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,779
And he told me that you didn't exist.

676
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,531
- Rudy knows my ex-husband.

677
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,449
He was just being protective.

678
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,201
- So I'm not the bad guy anymore?

679
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,831
- Is it safe to leave my bike outside?

680
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,457
- No, not in this neighborhood.

681
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:27,668
- Be right back.

Got any coffee?

685
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,663
That's your third one.

686
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,750
You drink too much coffee.

687
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:09,627
- I didn't sleep too well.

688
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:10,919
- Not that it's any of my business,

689
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,713
but you're a nervous wreck.

690
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:13,631
- Thank you.

691
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,507
Can I buy you dinner?

- I've got plans.
- Lunch?

693
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,178
- Meeting a friend.
- How about an ice cream?

694
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,721
- What time is it?

695
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,306
- It's a few minutes before 11.

696
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,891
- Out of the question.

697
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,935
- So what's what the accent?

698
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:27,978

Brazilian father.

701
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,108
I grew up in Rio and by
the time Mother claimed me,

702
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:34,902
I was 17.

703
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,487
Then I married a Frenchman,

704
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,614
that didn't do much for my accent either.

705
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,449
- So how long were you married?

706
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:41,992
- Three weeks.

707
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,452
- That's not very long.

708
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:44,953
- Three weeks with a Frenchman,

709
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,373
as close as you can get to an eternity.

710
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,167
- From honeymoon to divorce, huh?

711
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,920
- From Monte Carlo to Paris,

712
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,880
and from gambling to solicitors.

715
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,595
- I was sexually attached
to him for awhile.

716
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,640
- Sexual attachments don't last long.

717

If he's still chasing
you, he's still in love.

718
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,604
- We always fall in love
with what we don't have

719
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:11,522
or can't have.

720
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,692
So what are we doing for lunch?

721
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:17,528

- I think you're going to
like the smoked chicken salad,

725
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:36,296
and the champagne grapes
are simply delicious.

726
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,172
- Great.

727
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,761
- What do you think of Kimberly, Scott?

728
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,430
- What do I think of Kimberly?

729
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,306
Interesting question.

730
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,892
- Well, I mean, she's
a very beautiful girl.

731
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,978
Isn't she?
- Mother.

732
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,939
- She took her father's
strong, Brazilian blood,

733
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,360
his temper and his mischief.

734
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:01,155
- 20 years later and she's
still bitter with Father.

735
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,949
- Well, some feelings
just don't wash away.

736
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:06,535
[gentle piano music]
[water flowing]

737
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:08,495
Are you enjoying the champagne grapes?

738
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:09,580
- Simply delicious.

739
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,624
- How did you two meet?

740
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,753
- I ran into him this morning.

741
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,546
He was half naked.

742
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,173
- [Clara] Really? How embarrassing.

743
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,382
- Well, he was.

744
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:22,468
I got him out of the shower.

745
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,720
I thought he was working
for Mr. Wonderful.

746
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,472
- Oh, I think he's too nice a young man

747
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,557
to be working for your ex-husband.

748
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,018
- Jean Jacques is another person

749
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,146
who doesn't wear off with
time in Mother's mind.

750
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:35,063
- Nightmare.

751
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,525
Do you have bad dreams, Scott?

752
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,486
[ominous music]
- No, not usually.

753
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:41,945
- No, neither do I.

754
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,907
Of course, I don't sleep very much anyway.

755
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,534
So, you got Scott out of the shower and?

756
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,828
- Let me make it simple
for you, Mrs. Shawn.

757
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,916
Last night, Kimberly and I slept together.

758
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,793
[gentle piano music]

759
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,212
- No. [chuckles]

760
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,298
No, you didn't.

761
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,510
[birds shrieking]

762
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,346
[intense music]

763
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:10,516
- It's all right, Mother.

764
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:11,600
It's only birds.

765
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:14,102
[intense music]

766
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:17,189
[birds chirping]

767
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,525
Mother has this thing
about birds. [chuckles]

768
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,610
[upbeat rock music]

769
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,197
[engine revving]

770
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,031
- [Scott] Why do I get the feeling

771
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,991
that your mother was upset?

772
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,702
- Probably because you
underestimate her sense of humouir,

773
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,579
which happens to be very dry.

774
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:33,747
She got the joke.

775
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:36,625
[upbeat rock music]

776
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:37,793
- Do you like oldies?

777
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,212
- Sometimes.

778
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,381
- Why'd you go out with me?

779
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,550
- Because I was alone
and feeling miserable.

780
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:45,926
The thought of having lunch with Mother

781
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,386
just bored me to tears.

782
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,471
Plus, I had nothing better to do.

783
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,389
- Ouch.

784
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,559
- You're not gonna pout, are you?

785
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,185
- How about dinner?

786
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:56,603
- You asked before.

787
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:57,813
- Yeah, I know I already asked.

788
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:58,897
How about dinner?

789
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,858
- Still no.
- Somebody else.

790
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,569
[upbeat rock music]

791
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:04,486
Is it serious?

792
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,239
- You ask too many questions.

793
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,867
- Yeah, well you don't
volunteer much information.

794
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,535
- Drop me off over there.

795
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,828
- What?
- There.

796
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:13,912
The black BMW.

797
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:17,583
[upbeat rock music]

798
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,419
[ominous music]

799
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:26,133
- What about your bike?

800
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,134
- Take care of it.

801
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,427
I'll pick it up later.

802
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,803
- When?
- Soon.

803
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,265

[tyres screeching]

806
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,742
- I don't know, man.

807
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,660
The whole thing sounds pretty fishy.

808
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:54,661
[waves crashing]

809
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,371
- Well, how else do you explain it?

810
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,205
- I can't.

811
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,540
[wind whistling]

812
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:01,293
Very basic brain, beer damage.

813
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:06,340
But I do know things like this

814
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,383
just don't happen in real life.

815
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,135
Guy dreams of girl,

816
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:14,306
guy sees picture of girl's
face on stolen T-shirt,

817
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,099
guy tries to track girl down,

818
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,143
girl finds guy,

819
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:19,603
guy loses girl.

820
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:21,939
- She left her bike.

821
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,231
- Big deal.

822
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,859
A witch never leaves
her broomstick behind.

823
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,695

[footsteps tapping]

826
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,639
- Nothing makes sense anymore.

827
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,850
And you know what?

828
00:41:59,059 --> 00:41:59,685
I don't care.

829
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,521

[door bell ringing]

834
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:38,765
It's open.

[romantic music]

837
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,145
I knew you'd show up today.

838
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:45,939
[camera beeps]
After being so mysterious

839
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,816
and complex,

840
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:50,736
it finally starting making sense to me.

841
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,571
You're almost predictable.

842
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,449
[mellow music]

843
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:58,285
I figured you out just by
looking closely at this bike.

844

[camera beeping]

848
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:07,836
But not too much.

849
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:10,255
Enough to drive you off a cliff.

850
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:13,216
Dangerous, yet sleek and beautiful

851
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:14,342
at the same time.

00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:17,971
[romantic music]

853
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,432
I almost lost my head on
a bike like this once.

854
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:22,976
Spent five weeks in the hospital

855
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:25,729
[gentle music]

856
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:27,981
It was a stupid accident.

857
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,109
I think of it as my own Vietnam.

858
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:35,197
Idiotic, senseless.

859
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,826
But to me it was heroic.

860
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,662
[ominous music]

861
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:49,044
I always talk to people
about that accident

862
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:50,212
as if it was the only foolish

863
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,589
and brave thing I've ever done.

864
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:53,799
The first thing I said to myself,

865
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,926
when I got out of intensive care was,

866
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:59,304
"God, I'd love to go for a ride."

867
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:02,724
False sense of freedom,
no seat belts, no helmets.

868
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:05,102
Just you, the machine, the wind.

869
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,605
And you go faster and faster.

870
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:10,524
And it gets riskier and riskier

871
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:12,484
and it gives you a rush like nothing else

872
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,361
you've seen in this world,

873
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:15,570
but you wouldn't stop doing it no matter

874
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:16,863
how dangerous it got.

875
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,408
- If therapy's over, I'll
cook dinner for you now.

876
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:21,284
- Don't play games with me.

877
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:22,702
- I'm not playing games.

878
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,995
- I'm not a good loser.

879
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:25,747
- There's nothing to win or lose here.

880
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:27,290
- How about my sanity?

881
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,086
- You willing to take risks?

882
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,380
- What do you think?
- Then trust me.

The ride scare you?

- You always drive
straight to the bedroom?

899
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:52,584
- Only when I have to pee real bad.

900
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:53,585

- Pretty boring too.

907
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,169
It's being sold for 12 million.

908
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:38,129
- Huh, you'll be rich.

909
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:39,798
- No, I won't. I'm just house sitting.

910
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:42,092
When the owner's sell, I'm outta here.

[wind whistling]
[waves crashing]

912
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:44,803
Wanna play Bocuse?

913
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,056
- I don't know the game.

914
00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:51,393
- Bocuse, chef, South of
France, Nouvelle cuisine.

915

[wind whistling]
[waves crashing]

916
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,021

Like it?

924
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:20,922
- I love it. What is it?

925
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:23,717
- Maybe it's the sauce.

926
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:28,013
Maybe it's just the way I taste.

927
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,475
- Well, I'm not real good with puzzles.

928
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:33,727
Let's find out.

929
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,563

[waves crashing]

937
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,098
- You haven't touched your pizza.

938
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:13,933
- You cook too well.

939
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:16,644
- [chuckles] That's not all I do well.

940
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:17,520
- No?

941
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:18,938
[gentle piano music]

942
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,565
- Mm, I paint.

943
00:48:20,774 --> 00:48:21,608
And I...

944
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,653
[Kimberly slurping]

945
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:26,571
Mm.

946
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,325
I think food is sexy.

[Scott slurping]

949
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:39,542
Like it?

950
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,461
- Now that would make great pizza topping.

951
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:45,382
- [laughing] Is pizza
all you can think about?

952
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:47,300
- What about you, what do you like?

953
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:54,307
- Mm, carpaccio and Souffle Grand Marnier

954
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,268
and veal cooked with grapes

955
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:00,230
and coq au vin.

956
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,731

[Kimberly laughs]

958
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,654
- Uh-huh. [laughs]

959
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:11,408
- What exotic dishes
are we eating right now?

960
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:13,118
- Salad.

961
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:15,787
- Salad?

962
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,080
- [Kimberly] Mm-hmm.

963
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,206
- Plain ordinary salad?

964
00:49:18,415 --> 00:49:19,124
- Mm-hmm.

965
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:21,459

[fire crackling]

973
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,967
- I have a confession to make.

974
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:12,886
- What?

975
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,346
- I can't take you back.

976
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:16,806
I'm too tired.

977
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,101
- Is this a come on, Kimberly?

978
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,317
- You had a good time
with me today, didn't you?

979
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:31,404
- Yeah, I really did.

980
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,866
- I'm starting to like you, Scott.

981
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:38,286
A lot and I really love foreplay.

982
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:40,413
Is there any reason we have to rush this?

983
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,666
- Not that I can think of.

984
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,335
- Good. I'll sleep in my bedroom.

985
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:46,961
The rest of the place is yours.

986
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,591
- I'll clean up.
- Leave it for the maid.

987
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,301
- When does she come?

988
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,302
- Next week.

989

What took you so long?

1002
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,098
- I thought you didn't wanna rush things?

1003
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:06,392
- I lied.

1030
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:53,007
So, what was that all about last night?

1031
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,592
- Love.

1032
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,760
- Come on, Scott.

1033
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,845
I'm talking about your
sudden urge to kiss me

1034
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,680
while I was sleeping so nicely.

1035
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,641
- That's all it was, an urge.

1036
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:05,853
- [chuckles] I'd rather hear the truth.

1037
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:10,191
- Truth is I had a
strange dream last night.

1038
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:15,321
Some guy with a shotgun
came into your room

1039
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:16,739
and blasted you.

1040
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,991
- Did I bleed?
- A lot.

1041
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,161
- Good. That means strong emotions.

1042
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,954
Was it day or night?

1043
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:25,372
- Does it matter?

1044
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:26,874
- Sure.

1045
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:28,375
Strong emotions.

1046
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:29,960
Quiet subconscious.

1047
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:31,337
Violence.

1048
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:34,590
An unknown man in the dark, threat.

1049
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,219
Was he French by any chance?

1050
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:40,137
- He didn't speak.

1051
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:43,599
- Well, I'm no dream expert,

1052
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:47,394
but I bet all of those
Jean Jacques horror stories

1053
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:49,021
affected you real bad.

1054
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,484
- I never had bad dreams before.

1055
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,277
- That makes you abnormal.

1056
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:59,448
I've had horrible dreams until I was 16.

1057
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:00,282
- Then what happened?

1058
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:02,409
- I made love for the first time.

1059
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,705

Come on.

1063
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:31,564
Come on.

1064
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:35,526
Come on. What are you waiting for?

1065
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:43,450
[water splashes]

[Kimberly laughing]

1071
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:00,843
- That wasn't funny.

1072
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,637
- You just have a rotten sense of humour.

1073
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:05,097
- Oh yeah?

1074
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:06,765
What's wrong with it.

1075
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:08,851
- It's got a mind of its own.

1076
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,312
When it's convenient for
you to laugh, it works.

1077
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,522
When it's not convenient, nothing's funny.

1078
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,192
- Very impressive, Doctor.

1079
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,776
We've known each other for 24 hours,

1080
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,320
you've already analysed my dreams

1081
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,071
and criticised my sense of humour.

1082
01:02:22,031 --> 01:02:24,033
- I wouldn't change you for anything.

1083
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,869
[romantic music]

1084
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,090
- You wanna know something?

1085
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,177
Okay.

1086
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:44,094
Here it goes.

1087
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,598
What I'm about to tell you,

1088
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,558
is was one hell of an important thing.

1089
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:52,645
It's not conjecture.

1090
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:54,438
It's not a promise.

1091
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:57,983
It's just what is right now, today.

1092
01:02:58,192 --> 01:02:59,443
At this moment, okay?

1093
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:00,819
[romantic music]

1094
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:03,489

1456
01:27:06,013 --> 01:27:07,807
- Yeah, Kimberly Shawn, please.

1457
01:27:08,015 --> 01:27:08,641
- [Woman] I'm sorry.

1458
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:10,267
Miss Shawn is out with a client.

1459
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:11,811
Can I take a message”?

1460
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:14,563
- I'm supposed to deliver
some shoes to her.

1461
01:27:14,772 --> 01:27:16,148
Could you give me her address?

1464
01:27:32,707 --> 01:27:35,042
- [Woman] Sterling
Associates. Can I help you?

1465
01:27:35,251 --> 01:27:36,752
- Yeah, Kimberly Shawn, please.

1466
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:38,879
- [Woman] I'm sorry, she's still out.

1467
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:40,297
Would you like to leave a message?

1468
01:27:40,506 --> 01:27:41,465
- No, no, no message.

1469
01:27:41,674 --> 01:27:42,800
I called before.

1470
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,135
Thanks.

1475
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:58,899
- [Woman] Sterling Associates.

1476
01:27:59,108 --> 01:28:01,777
- Yeah, is Kimberly Shawn back yet?

1477
01:28:01,986 --> 01:28:03,821
- [Woman] I'm sorry, she's not.

1478
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:06,323
Maybe she's gone for the day.

1479
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:07,616
- Okay. Thanks.

1481
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:29,680
Kimberly Shawn. What a pleasant surprise.

1482
01:28:29,889 --> 01:28:31,140
- Scott.

1483
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:32,224
This is Karen, my-
- Oh, nice to meet you,

1484
01:28:32,433 --> 01:28:33,601
but I'm really in a hurry.

1485
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:34,643
Can we please talk?

1486
01:28:36,103 --> 01:28:37,938
Come with me or I'll break your arm.

1487
01:28:38,147 --> 01:28:39,940

do you think you're doing?

1491
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:56,165
- Oh, don't mind me, Miss Shawn,

1492
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:56,999
I'm just kidnapping you.

1493
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:59,376
I need some answers and
I need 'em fucking quick!

1494
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:00,669
- Answers to what?

1495
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:01,796
- You keep acting stupid,

1496
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:04,006
I'm gonna kick the shit
out of you, right here!

Totally insane.

1506
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:32,660

01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:34,787
Pretty close, but not quite yet.

- Because, dear one,

1513
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:48,592
this disc has my nightmare on it.

1514
01:29:48,801 --> 01:29:49,885
No, let me rephrase that.

1515
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:52,304
This disc is my nightmare.

1517
01:29:55,683 --> 01:29:56,892
And guess where I found it?

1518
01:29:57,101 --> 01:29:59,520
In your house, in your screening room.

1519
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:01,814
Now ain't that a coincidence?

1520
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:03,190
- No, it's not.

1521
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:05,818
I took it out of the vault
and put it there myself.

1523

1528
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:28,132

shoot me.

1530
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:37,016
It's not a game,

1531
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:38,517
it's an experiment,

1532
01:30:38,726 --> 01:30:40,686
and we're both part of it,

1533
01:30:40,895 --> 01:30:42,396
but it went too far.

1534
01:30:42,605 --> 01:30:43,522
I had to stop it,

1535
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,775
for your sake, for mine.

1536
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:51,030
- Well, it's nice to
know I'm not going nuts.

1537
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:56,160
Now I'd like to know who's behind it.

1538
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:58,245
- You should be talking to Ken Strom.

1539
01:30:58,454 --> 01:30:59,788
- I intend to.

1540
01:30:59,997 --> 01:31:01,081
Where do I find him?

1541
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,083
- You'd never make it alone. You need me.

1542
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:04,835
- Like a hole in the head.

1543
01:31:05,044 --> 01:31:06,086
- Use me as a hostage.

1544
01:31:06,295 --> 01:31:09,048
Ken won't touch you as long
as he thinks I'm in danger.

1545
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:10,174
- Why should he care?

1546
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:15,512

This is your pal, Scott Bruin.

No, let them through.

Oh, don't get up.

We're all family here.

No need to get hung up on formalities.

- Even trade, your
girlfriend for my sanity.

1579
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:57,531
- Let her go.

1580
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:00,409
And then you can have what you want.

1581
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:01,660

01:33:02,703 --> 01:33:03,829
Remember, Ken,

01:33:04,038 --> 01:33:05,330
I'm out of control,

1584
01:33:05,539 --> 01:33:07,750

1585
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:09,334
I'm your product, Ken,

1586
01:33:09,543 --> 01:33:11,879
and I'll bet you're real
proud of what I've become.

1587
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:14,089

1594
01:33:31,065 --> 01:33:32,691
broad beyond any imagination.

1595
01:33:33,859 --> 01:33:36,653
One that will alter the face of the world.

1596
01:33:36,862 --> 01:33:41,742
True, we did use you in a
very cruel and inhuman manner,

1597
01:33:42,034 --> 01:33:44,536
but there was no other way.

1598
01:33:44,745 --> 01:33:47,372

01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:49,625
Why me?

1600
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:52,336

You stayed five weeks in intensive care.

We obtained access to your brain.

[remote control beeping]
CAT scans, EEG'S,

every chart and bit of
information available,

01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:11,688
including the rather tempting fact

01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:14,733
that you had four broken
teeth that needed replacement.

small enough to be implanted in a tooth,

You trust me, I trust you.

1627
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:05,284
True, we did some things that
might seem ethically wrong,

1628
01:35:05,492 --> 01:35:07,578
but it's worth a lot of money.

1629
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:10,038
And we had a colossal Japanese investment

1633
01:35:20,382 --> 01:35:23,010
Sometimes we must
sacrifice our own emotions

1634
01:35:23,218 --> 01:35:25,012
to the life of the venture.

1635
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,972
- I paid a high price, myself.

1636
01:35:27,181 --> 01:35:28,849
Kimberly is precious to me.

1637
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:29,766
- Me too.

1638
01:35:30,684 --> 01:35:31,685
She's a great lay.

1639
01:35:31,894 --> 01:35:34,980
[ominous music]

1640
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:38,192
- I assume by now that you've figured out

1641
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,568
the rest of the story.

1642
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:43,363
The guy on the bicycle, Dr. Frieberg,

1643
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:44,907
Rudy, Mrs. Shawn.

1644
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:47,201
They all work for us.

1645
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:50,871
And all the other minor characters

1646
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:53,665
and the props like the
mysterious black BMW

1647
01:35:53,874 --> 01:35:56,084
and the rented house in Malibu.

1648
01:35:56,293 --> 01:35:57,753
Now that you understand the scale

1649
01:35:57,961 --> 01:35:59,922
and the importance of this project,

1650
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:02,466
take ordinary people, make them killers,

1651
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:06,094
take those born violent, make them good.

1652
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:08,931
Now that you understand
the meaning of real power,

1653
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:11,725
let me suggest your options.

1654
01:36:11,934 --> 01:36:14,186
Worst case scenario, you shoot me,

1655
01:36:14,394 --> 01:36:15,395
my men storm the room,

1656
01:36:15,604 --> 01:36:18,357
they shoot you and Kimberly.

1657
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,360
Best case scenario,

1658
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:22,694
you get back your discs,

1659
01:36:22,903 --> 01:36:25,197
we give you a decent
cheque for your troubles,

1660
01:36:25,405 --> 01:36:27,449
and we put this thing to bed.

1661
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:31,328
- You're so intelligent and eloquent, Ken.

1662
01:36:32,246 --> 01:36:35,123
How could anyone resist
such a rational approach?

1663
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,168
I'll tell you what, let me give you

1664
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:40,295
my best case, worst case scenario

1665
01:36:40,504 --> 01:36:42,005
and see where that takes us.

1666
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:43,924
Best case scenario,

1667
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:45,467
I walk out of here with Kimberly.

1668
01:36:45,676 --> 01:36:47,094
I get to keep her.

1669
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:48,178
I go public.

1670
01:36:48,387 --> 01:36:49,888
You go through some heavy
shit with some lawyers

1671
01:36:50,097 --> 01:36:51,640
and spend a few years in the pen.

1672
01:36:52,516 --> 01:36:54,643
Worst case scenario. I shoot Kimberly,

1673
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:55,936
I shoot you.

1674
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:57,437
Boom, it's a wrap.

1675
01:36:57,646 --> 01:36:58,897
- You wouldn't kill her.

1676
01:36:59,106 --> 01:37:00,482
- I will, Ken.

1677
01:37:00,691 --> 01:37:01,817
It's like you said,

1678
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:04,361
"Sometimes we have to
sacrifice our own emotions

1679
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:06,238
for the sake of the venture."

1680
01:37:06,446 --> 01:37:07,823
And if I can't have her,

1681
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:09,616
I really don't care if she's dead.

1682
01:37:10,826 --> 01:37:12,995
Well, it's been nice socialising,

1683
01:37:13,203 --> 01:37:15,247
but I got a dentist appointment.

1684
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:16,581
You tell your goons,

1685
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:19,418
they make one wrong move
and no more Kimberly.

1686
01:37:19,626 --> 01:37:23,171
Oh and Ken, I'm not the crazy one here.

1687
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:26,091
It's you, you are the
sickest motherfucker

1688
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:28,051
I've ever met in my life.

1689
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:29,886
[ominous music]
- Wherever you go,

1690
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:32,389
I'll be there.

1691
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:35,225
And Kimberly, be careful.

1692
01:37:35,434 --> 01:37:37,978
Remember, I love you very much.

1693
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:39,438
Don't forget that.

1694
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,274
[intense music]

1695
01:37:50,407 --> 01:37:51,199
Don't lose them.

1696
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,160
Get the van ready.

1697
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:55,996
[intense music]

1698
01:37:58,874 --> 01:38:01,543
You really do love him,
don't you, Kimberly?

1699
01:38:05,714 --> 01:38:07,674
I want you to stay close.

1700
01:38:08,842 --> 01:38:09,760
Make it look clean.

1701
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:16,141
If you have to, sacrifice the girl.

It's all over.

1749
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:36,776
- It'll never be over.

1750
01:42:36,985 --> 01:42:38,236
He'll come after us.

1751
01:42:38,445 --> 01:42:41,114
He always gets what he wants.

1752
01:42:41,323 --> 01:42:42,490
- Maybe not this time.

1753
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:44,034
Not if we're smart.

1754
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:46,244
What are else are you
keeping in that vault?

1755
01:42:47,746 --> 01:42:50,915
- All the original tapes of the project,

1756
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:52,876
all the files, names,

1757
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:54,961
cancelled cheques, everything.

1758
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:56,671
- That's our insurance.

1759
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,798
- Can't go back to the house.

1760
01:42:59,007 --> 01:43:00,884
They're probably waiting.

1761
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:03,345
I don't make good collateral anymore.

1762
01:43:03,553 --> 01:43:04,262

- About five or six, I think.

1767
01:43:34,376 --> 01:43:35,377

- Why?

1785
01:46:24,504 --> 01:46:26,673
- Because it had to be like this.

1786
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:29,759
Because sooner or later
he would claim what's his.

1787
01:46:29,968 --> 01:46:31,636
You and I would never have any peace,

1788
01:46:31,845 --> 01:46:34,430
no matter how far we ran or where we hid.

1789
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:38,810
Because I am a bad dream
and I betrayed you,

1790
01:46:40,061 --> 01:46:41,604
and you would never forget that.

1791
01:46:42,897 --> 01:46:45,650

this way you'd be safe.

or can't have.

1798
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:08,965
