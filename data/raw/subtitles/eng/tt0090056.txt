1
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,806
I have
a priority package

2
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,309
from the nat-sat
printing room.

3
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,311
why don't you
say it a little louder?

4
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,312
we could open
the window.

5
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
you could shout it
towards Moscow.

6
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,315
sorry. I--

7
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,318
it's not your fault
you're stupid.

8
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,821
just open the case
and get out of here.

9
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,824
the case is chained
to my wrist.

10
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,826
security dispatch
has the key.

11
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,829
leave the material,
take the case,

12
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,831
and wait outside.

13
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,833
no can do.

14
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,835
the material's
locked inside.

15
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,838
all right.
just give it to me.

16
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,348
get in the closet.

17
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,868
Hi-weather IV

18
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,870
transmitted this stuff
an hour ago.

19
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,872
beautiful close-ups!

20
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,875
miegs and sline
will drool.

21
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,878
they're late again.
unusual for soldiers.

22
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,881
they know
what they're doing.

23
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
gentlemen.

24
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,889
here they are.

25
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,392
are those the shots
from the latest fly-by?

26
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,893
over here, general.

27
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,898
wait.

28
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,401
is someone
in this closet?

29
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,402
ignore him.

30
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
he's just one
of our couriers.

31
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,907
well... ok.

32
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,409
nice close-ups.

33
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,412
definitely approaching
full-go hour.

34
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,918
I greased the house committee
for covert appropriations.

35
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,922
they think the funds are
for more stealth bombers.

36
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,924
we've selected
2 GLG-20s--

37
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,926
they're the best men
we have.

38
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,429
the last 2
were the best men we had.

39
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,931
now they're our
2 best dead men.

40
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,434
I'm convinced
there's a security leak

41
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,935
in your training program.

42
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,438
well, we could
bypass training.

43
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,941
no. they'll train with
2 other GLG-20s--

44
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,445
2 who are responsible
for the project

45
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,447
and 2 who are...

46
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,948
disposable.

47
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,950
are you suggesting
we assign this job

48
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,951
to inferior personnel?

49
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,953
no, I understand.

50
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,455
2 teams.

51
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
one to do the job,

52
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,959
the other
to be a diversion.

53
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,962
you mean decoys? targets?

54
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,963
exactly.

55
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,466
GLG-20s don't
exactly grow on trees.

56
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,968
I'd hate to waste
2 of them as targets.

57
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,970
I'm sure you can find
a couple of men

58
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,972
you won't mind wasting.

59
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,691
I'll be when?
lovin' you

60
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,193
cloudy days or sunny

61
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,695
lovin' you

62
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,696
are you sure?

63
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,197
that's a promise, honey?

64
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:13,201
when your kiss can
no longer pack a thrill

65
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,704
nothin'.

66
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,207
I'll still
be lovin' you

67
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,209
I'll be huggin' you?

68
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,711
how?

69
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,213
like a baby panda,
kissin' you

70
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,214
where?

71
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,216
on your
old veranda

72
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,720
when your charm, dear,
is absolutely nil

73
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,723
yeah, I know. you'll
still be lovin' me.

74
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,226
billin', cooin'

75
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,228
you I'll keep
pursuin'

76
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,731
always lovin'

77
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,733
hotter than
a baker's oven

78
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,237
we do smart work

79
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,739
what?

80
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,741
you'll just love
our artwork

81
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,244
don't blame me...

82
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,245
what?

83
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,248
aren't you taking
this test tomorrow?

84
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,751
the foreign
service board? yeah.

85
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,252
don't you
have to study?

86
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,756
I know the FSB exam
glass-backwards.

87
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,759
I've taken it
3 times already.

88
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,762
it's supposed to be
different this year--

89
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,764
500 questions
in 2 hours.

90
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,767
let me see
the booklet.

91
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,271
look at these samples.

92
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,273
all multiple choice.
it's easy.

93
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,777
here.

94
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,279
"if discovered appropriating
classified documents

95
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,281
"at a foreign
consulate reception,

96
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,785
"you should...
a--express concern,

97
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,787
"b--act surprised,

00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,789
"c--deny everything,

99

and d--all 3."

100
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,793
the answer is "d," all 3.

101
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,795
common-sense stuff.

102
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,297
I guess you just don't want
advancement bad enough.

103
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,800
my granddad
was an envoy.

104
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,802
my dad was an envoy.

105
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,804
I was born
into the trade.

106
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,808
besides, I've arranged
for an intimate lunch

107
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,310
with our supervisor.

108
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,812
you have to take
that test.

109
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,315
I'm very hurt that's why
you invited me over.

110
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,317
don't do that, alice.

111
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,320
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself today.

112
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,323
I saw my neurologist
this morning.

113
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,326
don't give me some
bullshit you're dying.

114
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,328
no...

115
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,831
not now.

116
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,831
radio: 'cause there's
one thing we forgot to say

117
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,335
 we're gonna
rock the house down

118
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,836
Millbarge.

119
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,339
 we're gonna
shake up the place--

120
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,842
where's the brain
for the scramjam 7000?

121
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,844
procurement picked it up
over an hour ago.

122
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,346
was it fixed?

123
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,847
yeah, with new
voice-scramblers.

124
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:25,352
oh. what about that
red-chinese radio chatter?

125
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,355
it's done.
here you go.

126
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,357
done?

127
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,360
that was a static-filled,

128
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,362
triple-scrambled
microwave transmission

129
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,864
between 2 soldiers
talking in mandarin chinese.

130
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,366
they were only using

131
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,368
a simple polyphonetically
grouped 20-digit key

132
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,370
transposed
in boustrophendonic form

133
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,372
with multiple nulls.

134
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,874
I broke it with this.

135
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,376
a drogan's
decoder wheel?

136
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,379
they put these into
cereal boxes for kids.

137
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,383
yeah, I found it in
a box of lucky charms.

138
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,885
break it down again
with the machines!

139
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,887
I already did.

140
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,394
well, then...
clean up the desk!

141
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,900
good.

142
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,402
that's much better.

143
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,905
by the way, good luck
on the test tomorrow.

144
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,407
what test?

145
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,410
the foreign service
board exams. good luck.

146
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,412
foreign service
boards tomorrow?

147
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,913
I can't take it.

148
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,915
I haven't studied.
I'm not prepared.

149
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,918
you were bumped up
on the list.

150
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,920
you're scheduled
for tomorrow morning.

151
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,423
I'm sure I told you.

152
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,926
this is dated
2 weeks ago.

153
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,428
you planned this.

154
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,430
you want me
to fail that test

155
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,433
so you can keep me in
the center of the earth

156
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,934
doing your work for you.

157
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,936
you just watch
your mouth, mister.

158
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,939
this department's laying off
civilians left and right.

159
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,444
where are you going?

160
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,447
home. to study.

161
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,951
one night studying
for a grade-19 FSB exam?

162
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,453
good luck.

163
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,456
listen, captain, I'm
going to pass that exam,

164
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,958
and I'm going to get
out of this hole

165
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,462
and do some really important
work for national security.

166
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,464
yeah, sure.

167
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,467
I was going to do
your family a favor

168
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,470
and hook up
the Disney channel for free.

169
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,971
well, forget it.

170
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,976
ladies and gentlemen,
as of this afternoon,

171
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,978
the undersecretary
for south American affairs

172
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,981
emphatically denies
any and all intervention

173
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,484
in the current realignment
of top positions

174
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,487
in the paraguayan air force.
thank you very much.

175
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,489
what about
the army's request

176
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,491
for spraying
subsidies?

177
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,993
are there
any Paraguayans here?

178
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,495
no?

179
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,998
their request for subsidies
was not Paraguayan,

180
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,000
as it were.

181
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,004
the United States would never--
if the president--

182
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,007
that's how it will always be.
is that clear?

183
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,509
how can you say

184
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,512
we aren't spending
millions on spraying

185
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,014
when the international
wheat board reported

186
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,516
"extensive contamination

187
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,518
in the grain fields
of southern Argentina"?

188
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,521
the state de... eber...
uh... the state...

189
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,022
microphones...

190
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,024
cutting out on us.
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,527
however,
the qu... wo... si...

192
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,029
...unch date,
so I must go.

193
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:31,413
these examinations
are qualifiers for positions

194
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,916
in the intelligence sections
of our embassies overseas.

195
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:40,922
the nature of your postings
will be secret.

196
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,926
now, secret work
can be very risky.

197
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,430
I cite what happened to one
of our greatest Americans--

198
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,931
not yet!

199
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,934
oop!
excuse me.

200
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:53,935
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:54,936
my fault.

202
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,447
I'm sorry I'm late.

203
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,449
I had to attend
the reading of a will.

204
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,452
I had to stay
till the very end.

205
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,455
I found out
I received nothing.

206
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,457
broke my arm.

207
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:24,966
would you hold my wallet
while I take the test?

208
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,968
there's $1,000 in there...

209
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,970
or maybe there isn't.

210
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,972
know what I mean?

211
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,974
are you saying
I can take this money

212
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,476
if I help you pass?

213
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,978
what doyouthink?

214
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,984
thank you.

215
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,987
so, where do I--

216
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,489
sit down!

217
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,509
you may begin...

218
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,510
now.

219
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,535
excuse me.

220
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,613
ahem.

221
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,620
ahem! ahem!

222
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,634
ahem! ahem! ahem!

223
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,135
ahem!

224
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,657
thank you.

225
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,158
you're welcome.

226
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,163
oh, god, the pressure!

227
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,165
I can't take it!

228
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,170
I can't take it!

229
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,673
I can't!
I can't do it!

230
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,182
I can't... what page?

231
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,853
this is
Emmett Fitz-Hume.

232
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,856
he's an information
officer at state.

233
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,859
he started there in '74
as a mail boy.

234
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,861
his father
got him his job.

235
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,864
this is Austin Millbarge.

236
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,365
he's a repair supervisor

237
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,869
in dia's code-breaking arm
at the pentagon.

238
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,873
wiggled into supervisor's pay
through an f-section.

239
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,375
his last job
before joining defense

240
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,877
was fixing office copiers.

241
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,881
he's good with hardware,
got some Russian.

242
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,382
want to see
their test scores?

243
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,384
what the hell for?

244
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,888
they're a couple of absolutely
self-involved bullshit artists

245
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,390
who got caught cheating
on a departmental exam.

246
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,894
they'll do anything
to save their jobs.

247
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,396
one's got
basic diplomacy skills.

248
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,399
the other's a code-breaker
with language ability.

249
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,402
I believe
we've found our decoys.

250
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,904
ahhh!

251
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,408
heart attack!
ahhh!

252
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,914
can I borrow your pen?

253
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,916
everybody,
please, stand back!

254
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,418
I am a trained
cardiovascular

255
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,420
respiratory emergency
assist technician.

256
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,423
I want all of you to stand back!
this man needs air!

257
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,425
in fact, all of you
should leave the room--

258
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,427
well?

259
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,933
so, what are we gonna get?
dismissal? suspension?

260
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,936
censure? departmental
prosecution? what?

261
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,437
promotion.

262
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,438
what?

263
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,940
that's right.

264
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,442
we like what we've
seen of you two.

265
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,945
we're bucking you
right up front

266
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,447
to gathering,
level 20.

267
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,449
gathering,
level 20?

268
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,451
that's quite a step up
in base pay.

269
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,453
we're not
in trouble?

270
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,956
we're not recruiting
for the boy scouts.

271
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,458
we want people
who are aggressive,

272
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,461
who know how
to go after that edge

273
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,964
you need to survive.

274
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,967
we especially liked
the way you two guys

275
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,969
were working as a team
in there.

276
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,971
now...

277
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:06,474
if you feel
you can work together,

278
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,476
you're on your way up.

279
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,481
we've got a very
special assignment.

280
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,484
foreign service?

281
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,485
yes.

282
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,987
undercover work?

283
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,488
yes.

284
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,491
Emmett Fitz-Hume.

285
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,993
Austin Millbarge.

286
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,995
when do we begin
our training?

287
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,496
right away.

288
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,998
boy!

289
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,425
we're just
hitching a ride.

290
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,427
they won't
make us jump.

291
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,930
jump? no chance.
we won't have to jump.

292
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,434
all right,
sky-troopers!

293
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,935
let's go!

294
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,438
go?
what does he mean?

295
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,440
you can't do this!

296
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,941
what are you doing?

297
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,444
aaah!

298
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,446
Fitz-Hume!

299
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,948
aaah!

300
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,969
help! help! help! help!

301
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,971
oh! oh, no! oh, no!

302
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,473
whoa!

303
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,974
aaah!

304
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,480
woooaaahhh!

305
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,981
oooh!

306
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,994
where are we?

307
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,996
I don't know.
I wasn't watching.

308
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,998
I lost everything
at 7,000 feet.

309
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,002
you hear that?

310
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,503
yeah.
it's a dickfer.

311
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,005
what's a dickfer?

312
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,007
to pee with.

313
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,511
man: aah!

314
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:09,014
was that me?

315
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,518
eiiaaww! haiii!

316
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,532
we need a plan.

317
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,534
let's play dead.

318
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,536
eiiaaww!
haiii!

319
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,539
haiii!
haiii!

320
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,541
come on, superspy,
think of something.

321
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:40,045
you're the diplomat.
talk to them.

322
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,051
all right.

323
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,552
stop right there,

324
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:50,555
and I'll bring
back the sun.

325
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,057
ok?

326
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,059
this is my sister.

327
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,561
you can
all have her.

328
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,563
I hear
she's very good.

329
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,565
one more step,
I start swinging!

330
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:03,568
he's threatening you!
let's get him!

331
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,070
show some balls!

332
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,073
it's too late to try
to impress them.

333
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,076
that's enough.

334
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,084
Austin Millbarge?

335
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,086
here, sir.

336
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,088
Emmett Fitz-Hume.

337
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,090
hello.

338
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:29,594
sir.

339
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,099
colonel Rhombus,
special projects training.

340
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,101
we've been expecting you.

341
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:39,604
excuse me, but what
was all this, uh...

342
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,606
that's how
I welcome new trainees.

343
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,608
what's wrong with
coffee and a handshake?

344
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:47,112
it's my job to get you ready
for field combat.

345
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:50,615
I must know right away
what I've got to work with.

346
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,617
I've made my decision.

347
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,619
what's it say?

348
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:55,620
"pussy."

349
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,622
that's not fair.
they had swords.

350
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:59,124
what could we do?

351
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:03,128
it depends on your
particular arena of combat.

352
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,129
maybe this.

353
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:24,107
I'll take you
back to the base.

354
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,903
this is
the obstacle course.

355
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:30,405
it is essentially the course

356
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,407
familiar to
armed service recruits,

357
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:35,410
except here in intelligence
operative training,

358
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,412
we do it a bit differently.

359
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,914
we add the element
of scorched earth.

360
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:52,927
this is your standard
bog negotiation trial.

361
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,933
you'll be judged
on survivability and time.

362
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,435
enter...

363
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:01,936
now!

364
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:11,446
heads down!

365
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,951
this will
verify your ability

366
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,954
to stay afloat
at high speeds.

367
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,469
we'll now
begin with afpsr--

368
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,972
air force
passive strain response.

369
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,477
you'll not be required
to exert yourself at all,

370
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,981
only to survive aggravated
body temperature measurement.

371
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,485
whoa!

372
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,487
oooh!
owww!

373
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,489
hot! hot! hot!

374
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:57,492
we will now determine
your g-force threshold.

375
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:58,993
just relax, gentlemen.

376
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,996
I guess
we just sit here?

377
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,499
piece of cake.

378
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,035
you want some coffee?

379
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:42,537
that's a good idea.

380
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,044
colonel,
we were just talking,

381
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,546
and, uh, we've had
loads of fun here.

382
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,548
met new friends,
had a great lunch.

383
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,550
wasn't that
a great lunch?

384
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,053
the tuna and cream
casserole was beautiful.

385
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:01,556
anyway, we were talking,
and we'd like to go home now.

386
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,558
thanks for the bruises.

387
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,560
keep the stool samples.

388
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:15,070
boys, it would be a shame
to have to kill you now.

389
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,573
what did he
mean by that?

390
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,575
it means we're O. I. O.

391
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:22,077
what's that?

392
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:25,080
Obligated
Involuntary Officers.

393
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,582
gentlemen,

394
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,584
begin radical vertical
impact simulation...

395
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:31,586
now.

396
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,226
come in.

397
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,233
you wanted
to see us, sir?

398
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,239
sit.

399
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,749
congratulations, men.
you're about to enter

400
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,251
the operational phase
of your assignment.

401
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,255
I'm not authorized to give you
the full operational packet,

402
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:18,258
but I'll tell you the location
of your initial drop

403
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,760
will be well inside
the borders of Pakistan.

404
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,762
Pakistan?
Pakistan?

405
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,336
is one of these people
our contact?

406
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,841
ok...

407
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:45,345
who led the American league
in home runs in 1953?

408
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,850
I'll handle this.

409
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,383
what's he doing?

410
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,385
it's just their way
of saying hello.

411
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,847
hello.
I'm Austin.

412
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,854
hi. Bud Schnelker,
liaison office.

413
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:37,856
u. s. consulate,

414
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:39,858
Rob Hodges.
DIA, west asian section.

415
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,359
welcome to Pakistan.

416
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,862
boy, we're glad
to see you guys.

417
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,364
when's lunch?

418
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:49,117
come on, guys.
jeep's over here.

419
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:58,585
Emmett: I'm starving.
what time you got?

420
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,593
listen, could we stop?

421
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,595
what's the matter?

422
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,096
I got to take a leak.

423
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,609
you should go, too.

424
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,111
what are you,
my mother?

425
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,113
don't you think I'm
capable of determining

426
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,615
my own time to go
to the bathroom?

427
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:31,117
so, isn't now
one of those times?

428
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:32,619
no.

429
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,121
you don't feel a certain
degree of urgent pressure

430
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,623
on the inner wall
of your bladder

431
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,625
now right at
this moment?

432
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,627
no. I'm fine.

433
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:43,129
well, wouldn't you feel
more comfortable

434
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:46,633
being fully relieved
of excess fluidsnow?

435
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:51,137
I got to take a whiz?

436
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,640
don't go away.

437
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,642
oh, we'll be here.

438
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:05,151
these guys are not
our legitimate contacts.

439
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,153
they're KGB special branch.

440
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:08,655
oh, come on.

441
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,657
that was
a Russian wristwatch.

442
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:12,659
I know the country of origin of
every timepiece in the world.

443
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,620
that was a Russian copy
of a 1969 Timex digital.

444
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,622
is this your hobby?

445
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:20,625
basic. most common
slip-up in espionage.

446
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:24,129
we walked right
into enemy hands.

447
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,631
hi.

448
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:29,134
if you do know your
final objective,

449
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,135
you'd be smart
to tell us.

450
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:33,138
we'll work things
out a lot quicker.

451
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,599
we still
don't know.

452
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,603
you know what they say
about this type of operation...

453
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,608
da! da!
da!

454
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,116
feet.

455
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,117
hat.

456
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,126
come on!

457
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:11,134
look out!

458
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,142
they sure had me fooled.

459
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:22,145
the Soviets obviously
know we're here now.

460
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,147
where to, boss?

461
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:26,649
first we check
our gasoline supply.

462
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:28,151
how's our
gasoline supply?

463
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:29,652
8 5-gallon cans.

464
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,154
enough to get us
to an airport?

465
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:34,657
I hope so.
we'll drive in shifts.

466
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,659
one guy'll drive,
the other'll sleep.

467
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,162
ok. I'll drive,
you sleep.

468
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,165
wake me up
when you get tired.

469
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:43,166
ok.

470
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,668
good night.

471
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,169
good night.

472
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:47,671
sleep tight.

473
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,172
thanks.

474
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:51,675
don't let
the bedbugs bite.

475
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,176
ok.

476
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:54,678
night.

477
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,297
good morning.

478
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,300
is there
an airport near here?

479
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,832
Austin.
your turn to drive.

480
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:13,340
these are
the Yusufzai.

481
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,342
they're afghani
freedom-fighters.

482
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:17,344
they're our allies.

483
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:18,345
oh!

484
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:22,849
we're Americans!

485
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:40,367
dr. Hadley!

486
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:47,874
oh, my god!

487
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,379
what do you think
you're doing?

488
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:57,384
sorry about this.

489
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,886
they're very distrustful
of outsiders.

490
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,888
no problem.

491
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:04,891
get your men
to cut them down.

492
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,403
who are you?

493
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:17,904
oh, sorry. Hadley.

london college of medicine.

495
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:22,409
they only allow us here because
we're helping with the wounded.

496
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,411
they didn't realize
you were with the effort.

497
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,412
with who?

498
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,914
the United Nations
medical effort, of course.

499
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:30,417

everything's fine.

509
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:59,446
we'll head back
to the old u. n.

510
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:02,949

a good job you're doing.

511
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,453

anxious to meet you.

547
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,531
doctor.

548
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:27,534
doctor.

549
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,035
doctor.

550
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:30,537
doctor.

551
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,038
doctor.
doctor.

552
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:33,540
doctor.
doctor.

553
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,875
doctor.
doctor.

554
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:39,379
we're not doctors.

555
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:42,382
we've got to leave
here immediately!

556
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:44,884
no. not until I've had--

557
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,386
excuse me.

558
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:48,888
her.

559
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:50,390
am I interrupting?

560
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,892
no! he was just
on his way out.

561
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:00,400
what happens when
the real doctors come?

562
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:03,403
hi.

563
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:04,904
dr. Trowbridge.

564
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:05,905
where?

565
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:07,407
oh! right!

566
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:09,409
make yourself
comfortable. sit down.

567
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,911
thank you.

568
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,427
what can I do for you?

569
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,430
dr. Trowbridge--
may I call you Homer?

570
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,431
why?

571
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:32,932
well, that's your name.

572
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,435
oh! right!
Homer. of course.

573
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:36,936
what's your name?

574
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:38,438
Karen.

575
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:39,939
Karen.

576
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,941
dr. Trowbridge...
Homer...

577
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:45,445
when you walked
into this tent,

578
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,947
it was the most exciting
moment of my life.

579
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:49,949
well, you just wait.

580
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:53,411
you're my hero. I've
read all your papers.

581
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:54,913
how'd you get
my papers?

582
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:57,916
oh, you mean
my medical papers!

583
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:58,917
are you
making fun of me?

584
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,419
oh, Karen,
our first fight.

585
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:03,922
you might think I'm silly
to worship you the way I do,

586
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:06,424
but in my estimation,
you're a genius.

587
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:09,427
well, I think genius
is a pretty strong word,

588
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:12,430
but if you insist on using it,
I can handle it.

589
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,433
in fact, I hesitate
to mention my problem.

590
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,936
it's a task hardly worthy
of your abilities.

591
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,437
go ahead. mention it.

592
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:21,439
there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

593
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:23,942
the khan's brother,
he's been suffering

594
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:25,944
from pain in
the right lower abdomen,

595
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:27,946
obviously
an inflamed appendix.

596
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:29,447
obviously.

597
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:31,950
dr. Hadley was
going to remove it,

598
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,952
but now that
you're here,

599
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,454
just to see you perform
even a simple surgery

600
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:39,457
would be a great thrill
in my life.

601
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:40,959
I'd really rather not.

602
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,961
I don't have
my instruments with me.

603
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:44,462
use dr. Hadley's.

604
00:41:44,462 --> 00:41:48,466
the khan's brother
is being prepped now.

605
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:49,968
if you refuse
to do this,

606
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:52,971
the khan will lose
faith in you and us.

607
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,974
the consequences
could be severe.

608
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:58,977
I see.

609
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:01,980
well, the truth is
I am a great surgeon,

610
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,483
but alas, I recently suffered
severe nerve damage

611
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:07,485
in my left hand.

612
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:09,487
oh, my god!

613
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:11,489
yeah. look at that.

614
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:13,491
no feeling at all.

615
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:14,993
dead.

616
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:16,995
how did that happen?

617
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:20,999
I was lifting
a car off a child.

618
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:23,001
it was a big cadillac.

619
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,003
I'm so disappointed.

620
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:28,006
the khan will be
very suspicious.

621
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:29,507
my god.

622
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:32,010
oh, there, there, there.

623
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,013
actually, I could
operate without my hands.

624
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:37,515
dr. Greenbaum
could be my hands.

625
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:40,018
I could tell him
what to do.

626
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,020
youwouldget a chance
see me in action.

627
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,522
that would be
wonderful.

628
00:42:44,522 --> 00:42:48,526
after I guide dr. Greenbaum
through an operation,

629
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:50,528
I get very depressed.

630
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:53,031
I couldn't
do it myself.

631
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,533
it's a very bad time
for me.

632
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:59,037
don't you worry.
I'll be with you.

633
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,542
give me a break.

634
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:10,548
about an hour?

635
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:12,759
fine. an hour.

636
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,762
thank you.

637
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:16,763
bye.

638
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:17,764
bye.

639
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:23,269
you're good with tools,
aren't you? instruments?

640
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,773
you kidding? you're
talking to Millbarge.

641
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,775
want something converted,
built, repaired, modified?

642
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:31,277
you're talking
to mr. hands.

643
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,783
ahh. mind if
I play through?

644
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:41,287
doctor. doctor.

645
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:44,290
glad I'm not sick.

646
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:56,803
if anything happens to him,
my people will be angry.

647
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:59,806
to die in battle
is glorious.

648
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:02,809
to die in a tent
is disgrace.

649
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,812
and with that, I give you
dr. Julius Greenbaum.

650
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:07,814
thank you, doctor.

651
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:09,816
I'll just step out
for a smoke.

652
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:11,818
perhaps
I'll stay here.

653
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,821
today we'll be removing
the patient's appendix.

654
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:18,825
the first step in an operation
of this particular type is...

655
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,841
to shave the patient.

656
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:42,349
nah, forget it,
forget it.

657
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:48,855
we'll skip the shave
and go to the operation.

658
00:44:48,855 --> 00:44:52,359
the second step
in this operation is...

659
00:44:58,365 --> 00:44:59,866
anesthetic.

660
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:04,871
but can't you tell
he's already been given

661
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:06,873
the required injection
of pentothal?

662
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:08,375
of course.

663
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:12,379
he's already been given
the required... injections.

664
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:16,383
all right. let us begin
the operation.

665
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,904
thank you, doctor.

666
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:40,907
and now,
the first incision.

667
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:51,418
doctor.

668
00:45:51,918 --> 00:45:53,420
isn't that incision
a bit high

669
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,422
for an appendix?

670
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,923
do you want to do
the operation?

671
00:45:56,923 --> 00:45:59,426
fine! you come on up here,
and you do it!

672
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:00,927
imhaus.

673
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:02,429
he was cutting
into his chest!

674
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,931
did I cut his chest?

675
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:08,435
I was probing to determining
muscle tone and skeletal girth.

676
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,437
it's a new technique!

677
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:13,940
we mock what
we don't understand.

678
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,942
go ahead, will you?

679
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:17,944
I'm getting hungry.

680
00:46:19,946 --> 00:46:22,449
and now,
the first incision.

681
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:48,475
and now,
I will incise.

682
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:56,983
cut the sucker.

683
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,489
ahhhhh...

684
00:47:11,998 --> 00:47:15,001
this man is dead.

685
00:47:50,203 --> 00:47:51,705
excuse us.

686
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:53,206
thank you.

687
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,775
let me do it!

688
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:25,799
Emmett!

689
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,801
help me!

690
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,307
let go!

691
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:27,986
the drive-in
is closed.

692
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:31,489
we're with
the Ace tomato company.

693
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:49,507
all this
cloak-and-dagger stuff.

694
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:51,509
the military love it.

695
00:50:51,509 --> 00:50:55,513
christ, will you
look at this place?

696
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:13,031
mr. ruby.

697
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:14,032
sir.

698
00:51:14,532 --> 00:51:15,533
mr. keyes.

699
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:16,534
yes, sir.

700
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:20,038
won't you gentlemen
have a Pepsi?

701
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,562
2 pepsis to go.

702
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,072
now what?

703
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:58,076
"why don't you
gentlemen have a Pepsi?"

704
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,592
you do it.

705
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:26,604
aaah!
aaah!

706
00:52:43,621 --> 00:52:44,622
this way,
gentlemen.

707
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:53,548
welcome to W. A. M. P.

708
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:03,183
general sline, sir.

709
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:04,684
yes, sergeant?

710
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:08,688
it's a collect call from
Pakistan for mr. Ruby

711
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:10,190
from mr. Fitz-Hume.

712
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,191
what?

713
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:13,693
we'll just be
another minute.

714
00:53:13,693 --> 00:53:15,695
thank you
for your patience.

715
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:18,198
it's collect. their
contacts tried to kill them.

716
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:20,700
they don't know what to do.

717
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,702
and they told you this

718
00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:24,704
over a public phone?

719
00:53:24,704 --> 00:53:27,207
no, sir. at&t's operator
told our operator.

720
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:29,709
they're insane!

721
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,711
and apparently
roaming free.

722
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:33,213
he's on line 7, sir.

723
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,714
get us the hell out!

724
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:37,717
everything's under
control, mr. Fitz-Hume.

725
00:53:37,717 --> 00:53:39,719
hold on one moment.

726
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:42,222
look, the longer they're
out in the field,

727
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:45,225
the more heat we can draw
away from the real team.

728
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:49,729
I agree. let's send them
over the border.

729
00:53:49,729 --> 00:53:51,731
how will
they get there?

730
00:53:51,731 --> 00:53:53,733
that's their problem.

731
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:55,735
hello, gentlemen.

732
00:53:55,735 --> 00:53:59,739
we're organizing
a rescue operation for you.

733
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:02,742
for after you've reached
your final objective.

734
00:54:02,742 --> 00:54:04,244
what is
our final objective?

735
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:07,247
that information is on
a need-to-know basis.

736
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:10,750
at this particular time,
you do not need to know.

737
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,252
however, we can tell you

738
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:16,256
to make immediately
for the Soviet Pamir district.

739
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:22,262
wait for your next contact
on the road to Dushanbe.

740
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:28,268
the road to Dushanbe?

741
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:30,770
you practically told them
the strike zone.

742
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:33,273
listen, if they
make it there at all,

743
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:35,275
they'll be plucked by
Soviet motorized infantry.

744
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:37,277
the road to Dushanbe

745
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:39,279
is a heavily traveled
military artery.

746
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:42,282
I guess that
takes care of that.

747
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:47,287
we must make
no mistakes this time.

748
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:50,790
our whole way of life
hangs in the balance.

749
00:54:57,964 --> 00:54:59,466
pamir? Dushanbe?

750
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:02,469
you're sure
that's what he said?

751
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,971
right. aren't they
in Russia?

752
00:55:04,971 --> 00:55:06,473
and how!

753
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:12,979
no, thanks.
I've already eaten.

754
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:15,482
how can we get there?
it's thousands of miles.

755
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,984
if this is
the lower Kohistan,

756
00:55:17,984 --> 00:55:21,988
we're about 150 miles
from the Soviet border.

757
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:24,991
youwouldhave to
know that.

758
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:26,493
wait a minute!

759
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:29,996
how do we cross
the Soviet border?

760
00:55:29,996 --> 00:55:32,999
we don't shave,
sell the ambulance,

761
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:36,002
sell our clothes,
and go native.

762
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:51,518
how far do we have
to go on this bus?

763
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:54,521
as far as it
takes us.

764
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,033
hey, look!
it's dr. Boyer!

765
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,043
she's the last person
we want to see.

766
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:20,046
no! she's nice.

767
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:59,085
what's this, the border?

768
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:00,587
no. toll stop.

769
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:04,257
hopefully, there won't be
guardposts where we cross.

770
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,761
look.

771
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:09,763
dr. Boyer.

772
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:13,767
leave it alone.

773
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,278
I left without
saying good-bye.

774
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,282
where are you going?

775
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:32,786
you can't deny what
happened between us.

776
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:36,289
don't touch me.
come on.

777
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:44,798
"don't touch me."

778
00:57:57,811 --> 00:58:00,814
look at this.
it's really neat.

779
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:06,820
how can she let a little death
interfere with romance?

780
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,322
they couldn't
have done better.

781
00:58:09,322 --> 00:58:11,324
they aren't doctors.

782
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:13,326
what do you mean?

783
00:58:13,326 --> 00:58:16,830
that metal case she was
packing on her horse.

784
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,831
what about it?

785
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:19,332
it's a Satscrambler
terminal.

786
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:20,834
sophisticated equipment
for sending, scrambling,

787
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:23,336
and receiving
satellite messages.

788
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,338
so she's
a sophisticated woman.

789
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,340
it's a highly
classified piece

790
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,342
of intelligence
hardware.

791
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:32,345
she's a high-class
intelligent piece.

792
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:34,347
knock it off.

793
00:58:34,848 --> 00:58:37,350
you're saying that
they're spies like us?

794
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:41,354
they're spies, but not
necessarily on our side.

795
00:58:43,356 --> 00:58:45,859
I think it's our duty
as American operatives

796
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:48,862
to follow her and
find out what she's up to.

797
00:58:49,362 --> 00:58:50,864
you just want
to follow her.

798
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:51,865
no.

799
00:58:52,365 --> 00:58:54,367
you're thinking
with your dick.

800
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:56,870
they left their
land rover here.

801
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,872
they're probably
headed for the border.

802
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:01,374
it would save us
a lot of trouble.

803
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,878
they seem to be headed
in that direction.

804
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:06,379
maybe your dick's
not so dumb.

805
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:08,590
got me through
high school.

806
00:59:22,562 --> 00:59:25,565
do you think those men
are following us?

807
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:31,071
they're most likely
Chitrali nomads.

808
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:32,572
not to worry.

809
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:52,592
did you say sit?

810
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:54,094
I didn't say sit.

811
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:55,595
did you say sit?

812
00:59:55,595 --> 00:59:58,098
no, I didn't say sit.
what--

813
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:05,605
now what?

814
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:08,108
I guess we walk.

815
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:39,639
why do we have to carry
all this stuff?

816
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:42,642
the Dushanbe road runs across
the top of the mountains.

817
01:00:42,642 --> 01:00:45,145
it'll be sub-arctic
temperatures up there.

818
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:47,147
you'll thank me.

819
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:49,149
"you'll thank me."

820
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,181
that's it.

821
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:23,183
the Dushanbe road...

822
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:26,686
where we're supposed
to meet our contacts...

823
01:01:26,686 --> 01:01:28,188
I hope.

824
01:01:33,651 --> 01:01:36,988
only insofar as it
serves to confirm

825
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:38,948
the president's
own beliefs.

826
01:01:38,948 --> 01:01:41,951
this is quite
an exciting project.

827
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:43,953
what was the cost of
this star wars system?

828
01:01:43,953 --> 01:01:45,955
just under
$60 billion.

829
01:01:45,955 --> 01:01:46,956
quite a bargain.

830
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:49,459
sir, printout
from gravsat.

831
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:52,462
a transmission
from the field,

832
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:53,963
your GLG-20s.

833
01:01:54,464 --> 01:01:55,965
well, wonderful.
they confirm

834
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:58,968
estimated arrival
at the strike site

835
01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:00,970
by 6 p. m.
their time tomorrow.

836
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,973
that's 9 a. m. here.
right on schedule.

837
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:07,977
you can always
count on our people.

838
01:02:15,985 --> 01:02:17,987
well, this is it.

839
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:20,990
where are those contacts
we heard so much about?

840
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:23,493
did they say where
on the road?

841
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:24,994
no.

842
01:02:24,994 --> 01:02:27,497
maybe we should
start hitchhiking.

843
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:30,500
we're inside
the Soviet union.

844
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,503
I wish we hadn't
lost Boyer.

845
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:37,007
they had horses.
we were on foot!

846
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:55,525
it's the tadzhik
highway patrol.

847
01:02:56,526 --> 01:02:59,529
they were just
sitting there.

848
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:01,531
they heard our
entire conversation.

849
01:03:03,533 --> 01:03:05,535
what are they saying?

850
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:08,538
he says we needn't
bother whispering.

851
01:03:08,538 --> 01:03:11,041
let's get
out of here.

852
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,043
they'll cut us down.

853
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:14,544
we can't just
go with them.

854
01:03:14,544 --> 01:03:16,546
what other choice
do we have?

855
01:03:16,546 --> 01:03:18,048
if we give ourselves up,

856
01:03:18,548 --> 01:03:20,050
the state department
will get us home.

857
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:21,551
not me!

858
01:03:28,558 --> 01:03:30,560
hi! just me.

859
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:57,587
I was just looking for
the burt reynolds theater.

860
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:03,593
don't I get
a phone call?

861
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:14,604
and who do you
intend to call?

862
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,612
goddamn it!

863
01:04:22,612 --> 01:04:24,614
he gives himself up!

864
01:04:28,618 --> 01:04:30,120
what is
your objective?

865
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,621
my objective?

866
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:34,624
well, I object to
buying a girl dinner,

867
01:04:34,624 --> 01:04:38,128
then she won't
put out for you.

868
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:41,631
why are you here?

869
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:43,633
why am I here?

870
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:45,635
why are you here?

871
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,138
why is anybody here?
I think sartre said--

872
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:49,639
how do you spell sartre?

873
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:51,641
ow! and let that
be a lesson to you!

874
01:04:51,641 --> 01:04:54,644
every minute you don't
tell us why you're here,

875
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:57,147
I cut off a finger.

876
01:04:57,147 --> 01:04:58,148
mine or yours?

877
01:04:58,148 --> 01:04:59,649
yours.

878
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:01,109
damn!

879
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:03,111
why are you
still hitting me?

880
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:04,612
he's going to cut
my fingers off!

881
01:05:04,612 --> 01:05:06,114
you have 30 seconds.

882
01:05:06,614 --> 01:05:08,116
you're not gonna hum
thejeopardytheme?

883
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:11,619
we start with
the little one.

884
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:14,622
all right!
I'm an American agent.

885
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:15,623
and?

886
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:18,126
and, uh...
and, uh...

887
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:21,629
they sent me here
to assassinate your premier.

888
01:05:21,629 --> 01:05:23,631
I knew it!
pay up, comrade.

889
01:05:23,631 --> 01:05:26,134
let's cut his
fingers off anyway.

890
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:28,136
no.

891
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:31,139
let's take him to
headquarters in Moscow.

892
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:33,141
good move.
good move.

893
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:34,142
headquarters.

894
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:40,815
it shouldn't be much further.
we've made good time.

895
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:42,817
we'll go on foot
from here.

896
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:13,848
ow! ohh!

897
01:06:14,349 --> 01:06:16,351
whoa!

898
01:06:23,858 --> 01:06:26,361
goddamn it!

899
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:28,363
whoa!

900
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:38,373
ah--ahh--ahhh!

901
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:40,375
whoa! whoa!

902
01:06:43,878 --> 01:06:45,380
hi!

903
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,383
how you doing?
remember me?

904
01:06:48,383 --> 01:06:49,884
what are you
doing here?

905
01:06:49,884 --> 01:06:51,886
what areyou
doing here?

906
01:06:51,886 --> 01:06:54,889
they surprised us.
border troops.

907
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:56,891
they got my partner.

908
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:57,892
did they
get you, too?

909
01:06:57,892 --> 01:06:59,894
I'm fine!

910
01:06:59,894 --> 01:07:02,897
no wonder neither
of you could operate.

911
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:04,399
you're spies like us!

912
01:07:04,899 --> 01:07:05,900
you mean, you're--

913
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,403
Austin Millbarge.
I'm a GLG-20.

914
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:09,904
so...

915
01:07:09,904 --> 01:07:12,907
you two are
the other GLG-20s.

916
01:07:12,907 --> 01:07:14,409
the decoys.

917
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:15,410
decoys!

918
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:16,911
lower your voice.

919
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:18,913
that's why they rushed
us through training,

920
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:20,915
why we were met
by the KGB,

921
01:07:20,915 --> 01:07:23,918
why they sent us
into enemy hands.

922
01:07:23,918 --> 01:07:24,919
right.

923
01:07:24,919 --> 01:07:27,922
I am--extremely
pissed off!

924
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:29,424
my partner and I
were set up!

925
01:07:29,924 --> 01:07:31,926
forget it!
that's behind us!

926
01:07:31,926 --> 01:07:34,429
our first priority
is to cover those bodies,

927
01:07:34,929 --> 01:07:36,931
establish
a new base camp,

928
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:39,434
and complete
this project.

929
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:41,936
Fitz-Hume's
in the custody

930
01:07:41,936 --> 01:07:44,939
of the tadzhik
highway patrol

931
01:07:44,939 --> 01:07:46,441
because of you.

932
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:48,943
the only project
I have to complete

933
01:07:48,943 --> 01:07:50,945
is to get
my partner out.

934
01:08:07,962 --> 01:08:09,464
Fitz-Hume!

935
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:10,965
Fitz-Hume!

936
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,481
come on!

937
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,494
look! did you do that?

938
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:41,496
yeah. I did that
for you.

939
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:10,025
you know, I must
really like you,

940
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:11,526
because I don't
like horses,

941
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:13,028
and I hate guns.

942
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:33,548
what's this?

943
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:36,051
you don't want it!

944
01:09:43,558 --> 01:09:45,560
aah!
aah!

945
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,562
aah!

946
01:09:47,562 --> 01:09:49,064
duck!

947
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:05,080
I'll get the horse.

948
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:19,094
let's go!

949
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:23,598
hi-ho, silver!
away!

950
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:05,056
it'ssoul finger
by the bar-kays.

951
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:07,559
they must be having
trouble getting gigs.

952
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:24,075
wow!

953
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:30,081
this is a Soviet
icbm site.

954
01:11:35,086 --> 01:11:38,089
Austin: that's
an SS-50 long-range rocket

955
01:11:38,089 --> 01:11:39,591
and mobile launcher.

956
01:11:44,596 --> 01:11:46,097
they just moved it
in here.

957
01:11:46,097 --> 01:11:48,099
haven't even put up
their locator beacon.

958
01:11:48,099 --> 01:11:51,102
means they're not hooked
into Soviet defense.

959
01:11:51,102 --> 01:11:52,604
they are radio-isolated.

960
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:53,605
only 3 men.

961
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:56,608
and their mother.

962
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,621
oh!

963
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:14,626
let me see that.

964
01:12:15,126 --> 01:12:16,127
hey!

965
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,129
come on!

966
01:12:28,139 --> 01:12:29,140
honestly!

967
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:31,142
you two
are unbelievable!

968
01:12:31,142 --> 01:12:33,645
wait a minute.
what are we doing here?

969
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:36,147
this is our final objective.

970
01:12:36,147 --> 01:12:38,149
our project orders
are to subdue the crew

971
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,652
and seize control
of this emplacement.

972
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:43,154
hold it, sister. we're
not going near that thing.

973
01:12:43,154 --> 01:12:45,657
that missile has
a 40-megaton nuclear warhead.

974
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:47,158
good night,
everybody.

975
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:48,660
where are you going?

976
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:49,661
home.

977
01:12:49,661 --> 01:12:51,663
for once, I'm in
complete agreement.

978
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:53,665
we should get up and
leave immediately.

979
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:55,166
those things can suck
the paint off your house

980
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:58,169
and give your family
a permanent orange afro.

981
01:12:58,169 --> 01:13:00,171
I don't what you two do,

982
01:13:00,171 --> 01:13:02,674
but I'm fulfilling
my obligation.

983
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:04,676
I intend to go down there
and seize control

984
01:13:05,176 --> 01:13:07,178
of that emplacement,
alone if I have to.

985
01:13:07,178 --> 01:13:09,681
you know we'd do
anything for you,

986
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,182
but we can't
seize that rocket.

987
01:13:11,683 --> 01:13:13,184
we'd have to kill
everybody down there.

988
01:13:13,184 --> 01:13:15,186
I'm not
killing anybody.

989
01:13:15,186 --> 01:13:16,688
I'm not, either.

990
01:13:23,194 --> 01:13:27,198
gentlemen, I think
you both should realize

991
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:28,700
the gravity
of this moment.

992
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,703
I've spent the last
2 1/2 years of my life

993
01:13:31,703 --> 01:13:33,204
preparing for
this penetration.

994
01:13:33,204 --> 01:13:36,708
this afternoon, I buried
my partner Jerry Hadley,

995
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:39,711
perhaps the finest,
most dedicated GLG-20

996
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:41,713
in the history
of the service.

997
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:44,716
he is now entombed
in a snowy grave,

998
01:13:44,716 --> 01:13:46,718
and it's not gonna be
for nothing.

999
01:13:46,718 --> 01:13:50,221
we are here today
to guarantee

1000
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:52,724
the personal freedom
of every American.

1001
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:54,726
and we should never forget

1002
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:56,728
the words of president
john f. kennedy

1003
01:13:56,728 --> 01:14:00,732
who said,"ask not what
your country can do for you,

1004
01:14:01,232 --> 01:14:03,735
but what you can do
for your country."

1005
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:08,740
will you marry me?

1006
01:14:16,247 --> 01:14:18,249
now...

1007
01:14:18,249 --> 01:14:21,753
these are high-compression
tranquilizer pistols.

1008
01:14:21,753 --> 01:14:24,756
we're not going
to kill anybody,

1009
01:14:25,256 --> 01:14:29,761
but you've got to get
in close to use them.

1010
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:44,943
hours--t-minus 2 until
designated target apogee.

1011
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:49,948
sir, all air traffic
has been diverted

1012
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:52,450
from our
response corridor.

1013
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:54,452
what's our present
on-line power reading?

1014
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:57,956
michigan reactor
and washington state

1015
01:14:57,956 --> 01:14:59,958
atomic plants
on-line, general.

1016
01:15:01,459 --> 01:15:03,461
lock us in, sergeant.

1017
01:15:11,469 --> 01:15:12,971
W. A. M. P. secure, sir.

1018
01:15:13,471 --> 01:15:14,973
all right.

1019
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:18,476
let's go to
response level yellow.

1020
01:15:18,476 --> 01:15:20,478
initiating level yellow.

1021
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:52,510
run your full servo
and arming.

1022
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:33,051
servo on and armed.

1023
01:16:58,576 --> 01:17:00,078
ah...

1024
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:01,579
soul finger!

1025
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:09,087
soul finger.

1026
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:49,127
what's she saying?

1027
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:52,630
hair... hairbrush...
headrest...

1028
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:55,633
where did you learn your
Russian, J. C. Penney?

1029
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:04,642
when she was a child
in lithuania,

1030
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:06,144
her uncle used to tell a story
about strange beings

1031
01:18:06,644 --> 01:18:10,648
that came down from
a disc and stole an ox

1032
01:18:10,648 --> 01:18:14,652
which the village had
put aside for roasting.

1033
01:18:14,652 --> 01:18:15,653
I told you
it would work.

1034
01:18:15,653 --> 01:18:18,156
everybody knows
about ufos.

1035
01:18:18,656 --> 01:18:21,659
apparently, the aliens
dissected the ox

1036
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,662
and kept the best pieces
of meat for themselves.

1037
01:18:24,662 --> 01:18:26,664
so we owe them
a cow.

1038
01:18:27,665 --> 01:18:30,168
where do we get one?

1039
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:53,692
nee nee nee!
de de de!

1040
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:04,661
do what I do.

1041
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:06,162
aah! aah! aah!

1042
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:08,665
aah! aah! aah!

1043
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:18,174
aah!

1044
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:40,280
Satscram signal
from the strike site.

1045
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,782
your GLG-20s have
penetrated successfully

1046
01:19:42,782 --> 01:19:44,284
and are awaiting
the go-code.

1047
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:46,786
open and lock down
ground deflectors.

1048
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:26,284
ground deflectors
opened and locked.

1049
01:20:40,298 --> 01:20:42,300
ok, dostoevsky,
what does it say?

1050
01:20:42,801 --> 01:20:43,802
it says...

1051
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:46,304
"approach SS-50...

1052
01:20:46,805 --> 01:20:49,808
source programmable
rocket."

1053
01:20:57,816 --> 01:20:58,817
easy.

1054
01:20:59,317 --> 01:21:03,822
"find control box
at front of transporter."

1055
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:08,827
this is a snap.

1056
01:21:08,827 --> 01:21:12,831
"for erector panel,
push red button."

1057
01:21:25,343 --> 01:21:27,846
"depress red key switch.

1058
01:21:27,846 --> 01:21:30,306

1059
01:21:30,306 --> 01:21:31,307
go.

1060
01:21:31,808 --> 01:21:34,310
"3-3-9...

1061
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:37,313
"dash 2-5-9...

"acknowledge compliance

1064
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:46,823
GLG-20s acknowledge
programming and compliance.

1065
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:49,826
bring all birds
into final bounce mode.

1066
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:53,890
bounce mode engaged.

1067
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:57,894
send them the go-code.

1068
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:14,786

sac-com confirms
an outbound blip

from Soviet central asia.

1074
01:24:30,362 --> 01:24:32,364

I think we just started
world war iii.

1080
01:25:19,911 --> 01:25:24,916
she wants to know why
we would do such a thing.

1081
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:27,419
tell her
so do we.

1082
01:25:39,931 --> 01:25:41,433
what are they
saying?

1083
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:42,934
it's 4:47 a. m.

1084
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:44,936
they're saying it'll be
28 minutes

1085
01:25:44,936 --> 01:25:47,439
before the rocket detonates
above its target

1086
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:49,941
somewhere inside
the continental United States.

1087
01:25:53,945 --> 01:25:55,947
let's see--28 minutes.

1088
01:25:55,947 --> 01:25:57,949
that's 18 until it's
inside the u. s. radar cup.

1089
01:25:57,949 --> 01:26:00,952
figure 2
for our response,

1090
01:26:00,952 --> 01:26:02,954
say,20 until
total commitment.

1091
01:26:03,455 --> 01:26:04,956
figure 20,22

1092
01:26:04,956 --> 01:26:06,458
until the first impact
of our retaliatory strike.

1093
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:09,461
I figure
we have 42 minutes

1094
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:11,963
until the end of civilization
as we know it.

1095
01:26:16,468 --> 01:26:18,470
you want to go out
with a bang?

1096
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:19,971
I beg your pardon?

1097
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:22,474
it was just an idea.

1098
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:23,975
you know, if we were
sitting in a bar,

1099
01:26:24,476 --> 01:26:26,478
I'd throw a drink
right in your face...

1100
01:26:29,981 --> 01:26:31,983
but under
the circumstances,

1101
01:26:31,983 --> 01:26:35,487
it's not such
a bad idea.

1102
01:28:15,795 --> 01:28:17,797
release full pulse.

1103
01:28:17,797 --> 01:28:19,299
3...

1104
01:28:19,799 --> 01:28:21,301
2...

1105
01:28:22,302 --> 01:28:23,803
1.

1106
01:28:23,803 --> 01:28:24,804
fire!

1107
01:28:35,815 --> 01:28:38,318
bounce pulse failed to
connect with target, sir.

1108
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:41,321
just what are you
saying, soldier?

1109
01:28:41,321 --> 01:28:42,322
we missed it, sir.

1110
01:28:42,822 --> 01:28:43,823
what?

1111
01:28:43,823 --> 01:28:46,326
we missed the rocket.
it didn't work.

1112
01:28:46,326 --> 01:28:49,829
didn't work?
where did the pulse go?

1113
01:28:49,829 --> 01:28:51,831
I don't know, sir, but
it definitely didn't connect

1114
01:28:51,831 --> 01:28:52,832
with the inbound traffic.

1115
01:29:02,342 --> 01:29:03,843
wow!

1116
01:29:03,843 --> 01:29:04,844
excellent!

1117
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:10,850
we'd better
call the president.

1118
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:11,851
we're not calling anyone.

1119
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:14,354
what do you mean,
we're not calling anyone?

1120
01:29:14,354 --> 01:29:15,855
the president must know
that this attack

1121
01:29:15,855 --> 01:29:18,358
was not initiated
by the Soviet union.

1122
01:29:21,861 --> 01:29:24,864
we are prepared
for this contingency.

1123
01:29:24,864 --> 01:29:27,867
what in hell do you
intend to do?

1124
01:29:28,368 --> 01:29:30,370
you understand, sir,
that we are responsible

1125
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:32,872
for launching a nuclear weapon
against our own country?

1126
01:29:32,872 --> 01:29:34,874
no one outside
this command center

1127
01:29:34,874 --> 01:29:36,876
has that information,
gentlemen.

1128
01:29:36,876 --> 01:29:39,879
when we commissioned
the schmectel corporation

1129
01:29:39,879 --> 01:29:42,882
to research this precise
event sequence scenario,

1130
01:29:43,383 --> 01:29:45,385
it was determined that
the continual stockpiling

1131
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:46,886
and development
of our nuclear arsenal

1132
01:29:46,886 --> 01:29:48,888
was becoming
self-defeating.

1133
01:29:48,888 --> 01:29:52,892
a weapon unused
is a useless weapon.

1134
01:29:52,892 --> 01:29:54,394
sac-com confirms

1135
01:29:54,394 --> 01:29:55,895
all defense systems
commitment ready.

1136
01:29:56,396 --> 01:29:57,397
we have verification.

1137
01:29:57,897 --> 01:30:00,400
the president is aboard
the airborne command center.

1138
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,403
I'm sure it will only be
a matter of minutes

1139
01:30:03,903 --> 01:30:06,906
before the president
commits to total release.

1140
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:11,911
jesus christ!

1141
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:19,419
you see, we had to show

1142
01:30:19,419 --> 01:30:22,422
that we had
the technical capability

1143
01:30:22,422 --> 01:30:24,424
and were determined.

1144
01:30:24,424 --> 01:30:27,927
history demonstrates
conclusively

1145
01:30:27,927 --> 01:30:30,930
that naive
wishing for peace

1146
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:33,433
is the surest
possible way

1147
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,435
to encourage
an aggressor.

1148
01:30:35,935 --> 01:30:36,936
I demand you place me

1149
01:30:36,936 --> 01:30:38,438
in immediate communication
with the president!

1150
01:30:38,438 --> 01:30:39,939
relax, mr. ruby.

1151
01:30:39,939 --> 01:30:41,941
this facility is more than
adequately stocked

1152
01:30:41,941 --> 01:30:44,944
for a comfortable 17 months
of below-ground existence.

1153
01:30:44,944 --> 01:30:46,446
we'll be fine.

1154
01:30:46,946 --> 01:30:47,947
by your actions, sir,

1155
01:30:47,947 --> 01:30:50,450
you are risking the future
of the human race!

1156
01:30:51,951 --> 01:30:53,953
to guarantee
the American way of life...

1157
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:58,458
I'm willing
to take that risk.

1158
01:31:09,427 --> 01:31:10,929
it's hard to believe
it's been only 15 minutes

1159
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:12,430
since I destroyed
the world.

1160
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:16,935
in another 15 minutes,
it will all be over.

1161
01:31:16,935 --> 01:31:19,938
it's such a short time
to destroy a world.

1162
01:31:20,438 --> 01:31:21,940
and to think my high school
guidance counselor

1163
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,942
said I'd never
amount to anything.

1164
01:31:23,942 --> 01:31:25,944
it just goes to show--

1165
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:28,947
guidance! source
programmable guidance!

1166
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:30,949
Fitz-Hume! Boyer!

1167
01:31:30,949 --> 01:31:33,451
get up! get up!

1168
01:31:37,455 --> 01:31:39,457
come on! come on!

1169
01:31:39,457 --> 01:31:40,959
come on!

1170
01:31:40,959 --> 01:31:42,460
Fitz-Hume!

1171
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,462
Boyer!

1172
01:31:44,462 --> 01:31:47,465
um...

1173
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:54,472
wait a minute!
what's going on here?

1174
01:31:54,472 --> 01:31:55,473
you have a tent?

1175
01:31:55,473 --> 01:31:57,475
bring me
the Satscram dish.

1176
01:31:57,475 --> 01:31:58,476
I think we can
recall it.

1177
01:31:58,476 --> 01:31:59,477
what do you mean,
recall it?

1178
01:31:59,477 --> 01:32:00,979
you mean like
a defective pinto?

1179
01:32:03,481 --> 01:32:04,983
take this up.

1180
01:32:05,483 --> 01:32:06,484
up. climb.

1181
01:32:08,486 --> 01:32:11,489
grab a rock.
grab a hammer.

1182
01:32:11,489 --> 01:32:12,490
we can divert it.

1183
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,492
it's made to respond
to in-flight commands.

1184
01:32:14,492 --> 01:32:16,494
here's a rock.

1185
01:32:16,494 --> 01:32:17,996
go to the Satscram
terminal.

1186
01:32:19,497 --> 01:32:21,499
now what?

1187
01:32:21,499 --> 01:32:23,001
smash that thing!

1188
01:32:26,504 --> 01:32:28,506
it's broken.

1189
01:32:28,506 --> 01:32:30,008
bring it here.

1190
01:32:30,008 --> 01:32:32,010
not the rock.

1191
01:32:34,512 --> 01:32:37,015
what's the use? it's
probably all over anyway.

1192
01:32:37,015 --> 01:32:38,516
no, no, no.

1193
01:32:38,516 --> 01:32:41,019
all we have to do is
switch sending boards.

1194
01:32:43,521 --> 01:32:45,523
ok.

1195
01:32:45,523 --> 01:32:48,026
start sending the launch
sequence in reverse order.

1196
01:32:48,026 --> 01:32:49,027
yes, sir.

1197
01:32:56,534 --> 01:32:57,535
Fitz-Hume...

1198
01:32:57,535 --> 01:32:59,537
hold these together.

1199
01:32:59,537 --> 01:33:02,040
I've got
to make the splice.

1200
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,042
hold it together.

1201
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:05,043
ow! I got a shock.

1202
01:33:05,543 --> 01:33:06,544
and you will.

1203
01:33:06,544 --> 01:33:08,046
I don't care
how painful it is,

1204
01:33:08,046 --> 01:33:09,547
you've got
to hold them together.

1205
01:33:09,547 --> 01:33:11,049
you are the circuit bridge.

1206
01:33:11,049 --> 01:33:12,550
b-b-but...

1207
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:14,552
I need, uh...

1208
01:33:14,552 --> 01:33:16,054
bigger
than a bread box?

1209
01:33:16,054 --> 01:33:18,056
I need, uh, uh...

1210
01:33:18,056 --> 01:33:19,557
the title
of a movie?

1211
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,062
animals and
their natural habitats?

1212
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:26,064
the title of a book?

1213
01:33:26,064 --> 01:33:27,565
things that are being
electrocuted?

1214
01:33:27,565 --> 01:33:29,567
I got it!

1215
01:33:39,077 --> 01:33:41,079
miles--

1216
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:43,081
5.

1217
01:33:43,081 --> 01:33:44,582
zero.

1218
01:33:44,582 --> 01:33:46,584
zero.

1219
01:33:54,592 --> 01:33:55,593
we did it!

1220
01:33:55,593 --> 01:33:58,596
we did?
we did it!

1221
01:34:00,598 --> 01:34:03,601
can I borrow your tent?

1222
01:34:03,601 --> 01:34:07,605
sac-com confirms
destruction of the inbound.

1223
01:34:07,605 --> 01:34:09,107
what about the rest
of their inbounds?

1224
01:34:09,107 --> 01:34:10,608
there are none, sir.

1225
01:34:10,608 --> 01:34:14,112
both the u. s. and Soviet
response chain on full recall.

1226
01:34:14,112 --> 01:34:16,114
damn.

1227
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:18,116
recalled.

1228
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:44,642
place them under arrest--
all of them.

1229
01:34:44,642 --> 01:34:46,644
wait! we don't know
these men.

1230
01:34:46,644 --> 01:34:48,146
we were kidnapped.

1231
01:34:48,146 --> 01:34:49,647
that's right!
kidnapped!

1232
01:34:49,647 --> 01:34:52,567
yes! we were. we were
at the drive-in.

1233
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:54,361
as the disarmament
talks here

1234
01:34:54,361 --> 01:34:56,363
continue through
closed sessions

1235
01:34:56,863 --> 01:34:58,865
last night and
on into this afternoon,

1236
01:34:58,865 --> 01:35:00,867
a feeling
of positive anticipation

1237
01:35:01,368 --> 01:35:03,370
is shared by everyone
in the press corps.

1238
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:06,373
the doors
to the conference room

1239
01:35:06,373 --> 01:35:07,874
are opening.

1240
01:35:07,874 --> 01:35:10,377
I see the chief
United States delegate

1241
01:35:10,377 --> 01:35:11,878
mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume.

1242
01:35:12,879 --> 01:35:13,880
mr. Fitz-Hume.

1243
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,382
hi, ed.

1244
01:35:15,382 --> 01:35:18,385
everybody at home is
most anxious to know

1245
01:35:18,385 --> 01:35:20,387
how things are going
in there.

1246
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:21,388
well, ed, right now

1247
01:35:21,388 --> 01:35:23,390
we're at an extremely
sensitive juncture.

1248
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:25,392
and, of course,
the slightest misperceived

1249
01:35:25,392 --> 01:35:26,393
phrase or gesture

1250
01:35:26,393 --> 01:35:29,396
could upset everything
we've achieved today.

1251
01:35:29,396 --> 01:35:31,398
now if you'll
excuse me, ed...

1252
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:32,899
thank you,
mr. Fitz-Hume.

1253
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:33,900
thank you, Ed.

1254
01:35:34,401 --> 01:35:35,402
mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume,

1255
01:35:35,402 --> 01:35:37,404
chief state department
negotiator

1256
01:35:37,404 --> 01:35:38,905
here at
the disarmament talks

1257
01:35:39,406 --> 01:35:40,407
re-entering
what he has called

1258
01:35:40,907 --> 01:35:43,410
"the delicately
balanced negotiations."

1259
01:35:46,413 --> 01:35:48,415
comrade!

1260
01:35:51,418 --> 01:35:52,919
ok.
