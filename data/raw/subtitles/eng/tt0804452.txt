1
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:14,265
<i>- Okay, chicas. Ready?
- Let's do it.</i>

2
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:16,219
- Okay, on three.
- One.

3
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,233
- Two.
- Three.

4
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:28,851
First day has arrived.
Ready to be ready?

5
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:30,550
Oh, man!

6
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,476
The skirt I bought
is at my mom's house.

7
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,068
I thought you were
at your mom's house.

8
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:36,312
No, it's Monday.
I'm at my dad's house.

9
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:38,072
Joint custody.
What can I say?

10
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,515
Has anyone seen my turquoise shirt?

11
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,404
You left it here by mistake.

12
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,417
Do you mind if I wear?

13
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,217
- Oh, of course.
- Okay.

14
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:46,706
Turquoise thermal, tank,

15
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:50,229
and... stripey warmers.

16
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:51,130
Super cute.

17
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:54,067
Killer plunge... shorties,

18
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:56,378
and leopard kicks.

19
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:58,333
Plaid skirt, lame sweater.

20
00:01:58,398 --> 00:01:59,291
Jade.

21
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:01,245
What?
You know my parents.

22
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,903
Just till I get out of the house.

23
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:03,868
And then?

24
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:06,073
And then I'm gonna blow all y'all away.

25
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:14,618
I guess none of you wanna
know what I'm wearing.

26
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:16,858
Shoes to die for.

27
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:19,512
Lucky guess. Okay.

28
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,004
40 minutes, front entrance,
we walk in together.

29
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:23,639
<i>- Adios.
- Sayonara.</i>

30
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,915
<i>- Do svidaniya.
- Ciao, my sisters.</i>

31
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,462
<i>Manny, jandalel</i>

32
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:36,349
<i>jEs el primero día de la escuelal</i>

33
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:38,903
You have ten seconds to get
out of there, you little toad.

34
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:41,015
<i>Don't get your bragas in a twist.</i>

35
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:45,659
Perfection takes time,
and I'm worth every single second.

36
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:47,866
Enough with the hair already.

37
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:51,802
<i>Looking good, chica.</i>

38
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,082
Yasmin, you will pay for this.

39
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:57,110
Bubbie, Bubbie!

40
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:58,395
You were waiting for me?

41
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:00,602
<i>Come on, niños. Get dressed.</i>

42
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:02,615
You don't wanna be late.

43
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:05,718
Go comb your hair.

44
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:08,923
And you, you come with me.
I got something for you.

45
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:13,079
<i>Buenos diasl</i>

46
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,063
Oh, hey.

47
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:18,432
I want you to go get dressed
and put these on.

48
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:21,592
Bubbie!

49
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:25,822
I know.

50
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,712
So, come on. Pay up.

51
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,505
Chocolate. How do you do that?

52
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,221
I'm not telling.

53
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,624
Nice doing business with you.

54
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:48,126
Come on!

55
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,917
- Dad.
- What?

56
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:53,657
What would I do without you?

57
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,985
It's probably your mom.

58
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:58,303
I'll get it.

59
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,705
Tell her that she's gotta take you
to the dentist on Thursday.

60
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,032
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

61
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,749
Did your dad give you breakfast?

62
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,768
I'll be ready in a minute, 'kay?

63
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:08,825
Okay, beautiful.

64
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:10,655
Oh, hey, honey,
could you tell your dad

65
00:04:10,723 --> 00:04:13,178
he needs to take you
to the dentist on Thursday?

66
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:17,026
Why can't the two of you
just talk to each other?

67
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,433
I'm the kid.

68
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:20,026
You're supposed to be the adults.

69
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:24,893
By the way, the dentist is on Friday.

70
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,216
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

71
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:50,594
Jade! Jade!

72
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:55,364
Let me look at you before you go.

73
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,764
Now, remember, Jade,
you have Mathletes,

74
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:00,349
science club, room one, and violin.

75
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,047
Mom, you forgot something.

76
00:05:02,117 --> 00:05:03,361
- I did?
- School!

77
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,956
And speaking of which, I gotta go.

78
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:08,673
Papa. Papa.
Take a picture.

79
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:11,198
Hey, what's up, ladies?

80
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,571
Mom.

81
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:15,809
Perfect. Have fun.

82
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:17,055
Bye.

83
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,686
C-A-double-R-Y!

84
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:46,980
Where's Cloe?

85
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:52,731
She's here.

86
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:57,950
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, girl.

87
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:01,989
Okay, it's a big school.
It's the first day.

88
00:06:02,055 --> 00:06:03,135
We're just freshmen.

89
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:05,280
What are we gonna do?

90
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:06,497
Blend?

91
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:08,543
- Own it!
- Right.

92
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:12,320
BFFs!

93
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:18,562
Guys. Hello!

94
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:20,356
- Re-huddle!
- Yeah.

95
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,288
I'm gonna own cheerleading.

96
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,888
I'm gonna try out for soccer.

97
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,099
Yas, you have to join chorus.

98
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:30,273
You know you have the most
insane voice ever.

99
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:33,411
Not a chance.
Remember kindergarten?

100
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:36,994
Me, "Mary Had a Little Lamb,"
throw-up, 30 kids screaming?

101
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:39,301
Yeah. I think I'll own journalism instead.

102
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,678
I'm ownin' the science.

103
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:44,063
Okay, work the IQ, girl,

104
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,374
but please don't lose
your passion for fashion.

105
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:48,351
Just to keep Mom and Dad off my back.

106
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:49,767
I'm also gonna rule home ec.

107
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,720
I'm gonna need
sewing machines for projects.

108
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,574
I'm gonna have the hottest clothes ever.

109
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:54,819
Break.

110
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,479
Wow.

111
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:16,994
Okay, girls.
Now let's do it.

112
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:26,079
Now, being president of the school
is a huge responsibility.

113
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:27,781
And it is one that I take very seriously.

114
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:29,607
Just sit here, Paris.

115
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,033
Hello.

116
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:33,220
Dylan, dude, that was a totally...

117
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,876
Avery, Quinn, please pay attention.

118
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:40,328
I need to become very familiar
with the clique lunch table assignment chart.

119
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:44,552
Because, as you can see,
there are 48 distinct cliques.

120
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,180
Let me break this down for you.

121
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:50,660
You have the goths, the skaters,
the disco dorks, the beat boy blingers,

122
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:53,634
the gangstas, the wanna-be gangstas,
the pretzel people who are into yoga,

123
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:57,963
very different from the greenies
who hate anything not made of plants.

124
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:01,444
Then you have the nerds,
the kids who like to dress like dinosaurs,

125
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:03,938
and the football jocks.

126
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:06,565
Oh, hi, little freshman.
I'm Meredith.

127
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:10,149
- So... any clubs?
- Nope.

128
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,009
- Interests?
- Nope.

129
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:13,768
- Friends?
- Nope.

130
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:15,113
Okay.

131
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,930
- Loner.
- Yeah.

132
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,972
- Over there.
- I don't get the Ioners.

133
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,500
They're Ioners, but they like
to hang out together.

134
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:24,999
Leave me alone.

135
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,957
Whatever. Next?

136
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:29,803
I really believe very strongly
in renewable energy.

137
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,244
Eco-maniac.

138
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,026
Very good, Cameron.
Tree hugger.

139
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:37,093
Now, if you sit at this table,
you'll find some people

140
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,915
who totally rock
the "paper versus plastic" debate.

141
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:41,159
Next!

142
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:45,923
Good morning, Principal Dimly.

143
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:47,721
Oh, good morning, students.

144
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,863
Pumpkin pie?

145
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:51,624
- Good morning Principal Dimly.
- Good morning Principal Dimly.

146
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:53,353
Yes, Daddy, what is it?

147
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,160
You were right.

148
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,179
Chapter 10.

149
00:08:58,255 --> 00:09:01,222
"Control the population.

150
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:04,491
A: Separate the inmates into groups."

151
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,835
You see, this was your idea.

152
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:07,757
Advanced thinking. Genius.

153
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:08,870
Okay. Daddy?

154
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:10,982
I've told you this more than 50 times.

155
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:13,291
You may not speak to me
during school hours.

156
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,814
Well, dear, everyone knows
you're my daughter,

157
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:16,836
and I'm very proud of you.

158
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:19,781
Do you want me to tell Mother about this?

159
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:20,803
Oh, no.

160
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,156
Well, I'm busy now, Daddy.

161
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:23,750
Bye.

162
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:27,271
I'll see you at home, then, candy cane.

163
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,156
Next.

164
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:33,998
Okay, honey, this is a really nice table,

165
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:36,813
and I promise it will
always be the same table

166
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,597
because I understand that
change is really upsetting.

167
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,749
Oh, no!

168
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,825
They did not just walk past us
without checking in.

169
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,522
Who is that?

170
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:07,048
No one you even need
to think about, Cameron.

171
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:08,365
They look kind of cool.

172
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:15,565
Yeah, in a totally trashy,
beneath our contempt,

173
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:19,016
maybe we could find a little spare time
to crush them into the dirt sort of way.

174
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,286
- Yeah.
- No, Avery, we don't crush.

175
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:25,103
We focus on the positive
here at Carry Nation High.

176
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,058
We help them find their way.

177
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,675
Or else.

178
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:35,342
Yeah!

179
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,320
You try beating Carry Nation High

180
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:51,281
Is it just me, or does this all look
a little creepily well organized?

181
00:10:52,947 --> 00:10:54,092
See you at lunch!

182
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:55,308
See ya later.

183
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:02,000
Excuse me, miss.

184
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:04,873
Are you in the right room?

185
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,723
Yeah.

186
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:11,404
A little magnesium,
some sodium chloride,

187
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:15,305
a pinch of perchlorate,
a soupcon of strontium nitrate,

188
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,624
and a little bling.

189
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:19,597
And...

190
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,629
A Bernoulli effect.

191
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,555
You are seriously superior.

192
00:11:33,621 --> 00:11:36,076
We would be honored to have you
as a member of our science team.

193
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:38,156
Yeah, thanks for the accolades.

194
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:40,755
Everybody, go

195
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,064
Let's go, Falcons

196
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,759
Let's go, Falcons

197
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:44,778
Last time!

198
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:45,998
Everybody, go

199
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:47,346
Let's go, Falcons

200
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:49,999
Let's go, Falcons

201
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:55,693
Now, that's the level I expect
from a Falcon cheerleader.

202
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:57,359
- Who's got it?
- Please.

203
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,771
You've got something better?

204
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:01,707
- Oh, you know I do.
- So bring it.

205
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,953
Girl, I brought it, nailed it,
lent it to my friend's kid sister,

206
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:07,120
and I brought it back while
you were still figuring out the beat.

207
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,164
Yeah!

208
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:43,663
What are you gawking at?

209
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:45,014
She's hot.

210
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,528
Hot player. Seriously.

211
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,686
Not bad for a rookie.

212
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:55,511
In fact, not bad at all.

213
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:57,172
Yes!

214
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,047
It's very red.

215
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:12,176
It's very you.

216
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,224
You in?

217
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,239
Why don't you watch where you're going?

218
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:58,291
Are you blind?

219
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:01,558
Hello?

220
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:05,368
No, but I'm deaf.

221
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,517
What?

222
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:09,404
I'm deaf.

223
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:11,062
You don't sound deaf.

224
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:14,963
Well, you don't look ignorant,
but I guess you can't judge a book, right?

225
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:39,802
Where do they think they're gonna sit?

226
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,080
Give me the seating charts.

227
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,347
Hi, guys. I'm Meredith,
student body president.

228
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,131
I saw you looking kind of lost,
so I thought I'd come over and help.

229
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:53,108
Thanks, but I think we're good.

230
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:56,216
It's no problem.
I have the seating charts right here.

231
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:59,070
Well, thanks, but I think
we'd rather sit together.

232
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:02,102
But there's really not a table for that.

233
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:04,248
That's okay, I'm sure
we'll find space somewhere.

234
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,327
But the lunch courtyard
isn't organized that way.

235
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,821
Oh, don't worry.
We'll figure something out.

236
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:12,573
- What was that about?
- 'Kay.

237
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,272
What are you looking at?

238
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:24,159
They're just awesome...

239
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:26,613
ful.

240
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:27,899
Awful.

241
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:29,725
Their clothes? Yuck.

242
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,581
Really super awful.

243
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:33,721
To look at.

244
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,774
Really.

245
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:36,190
Yeah, I know.

246
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:37,719
What are we gonna
do about them, you guys?

247
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:40,510
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
Nothing.

248
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:43,162
Quinn, my system is flawless.

249
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:44,694
Hey. Hey, Jade.

250
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:45,784
Look.

251
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:47,418
Come here.
Check out this radical theorem.

252
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:48,831
You'll absolutely dig it.

253
00:16:48,897 --> 00:16:50,042
- Later!
- Bye.

254
00:16:50,113 --> 00:16:53,048
Hey, Sasha, come sit with us.

255
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:54,015
I gotta go.

256
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,576
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Sasha.

257
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,537
Yo, Cloe.
Girl, come check this out.

258
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,194
Oh, my God.

259
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:00,443
Oh, sure.

260
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:13,911
You see?

261
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:16,375
We have no problems at all.

262
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:21,690
Jade, I'm stuck babysitting.
Come over and hang.

263
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:24,381
Papi made your favorite.
Matzo albondigas.

264
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:26,458
I have Mathletes.
Next week?

265
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:29,051
- I'm booked solid. Yikes.
- Next week?

266
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:30,071
I have journalism.

267
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:31,772
- How about tomorrow?
- We have to make time for each other.

268
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,882
- Wanna come over and study?
- Let's do it next week for sure.

269
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:35,100
You said that the last time.

270
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:36,633
- Where are you?
- I seriously miss you guys.

271
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,136
What's happening here?

272
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:39,421
You're always busy!

273
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:51,033
Fine!

274
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:54,115
- Hey, Sasha.
- Yasmin, hey, girl.

275
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,448
Long time, no see.
What are you doing here?

276
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:59,450
We were supposed to go
shopping together, remember?

277
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:00,572
Go, Falcons!

278
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,254
No worries.

279
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:05,917
My bad, Yas.
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:07,515
I've got practice with the girls.

281
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,930
Can we do it next week?

282
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,720
Oh, sure.

283
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,447
Yas, you're the best.

284
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:15,331
We'll do it next week, okay?
For sure. I'll call you.

285
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:17,152
- Okay. Call me.
- Bye.

286
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,877
You ruined my hair!

287
00:18:51,942 --> 00:18:53,469
Hey, you can take the bus.

288
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:55,298
Yo, listen up.
That bus is weak.

289
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:56,773
It's cramped up with freaks.

290
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:59,456
And I have no time
to show my hair mystique.

291
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:00,955
Word.

292
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,175
Weird.

293
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:07,942
- Hi, Ali!
- Bethany!

294
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:08,988
Hey, Dexter!

295
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,513
Hey, what's up, ladies?

296
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:05,057
All right, we can sit down now.

297
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:06,755
Let's sit down.

298
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:09,825
Well, well, well, welcome back
to another wonderful year

299
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:11,423
at Carry Nation High School.

300
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:14,694
And now, without further ado,
I'm going to introduce to you

301
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,445
your very popular President
of the Student Body,

302
00:20:17,514 --> 00:20:20,514
my little pollywog, my daughter,

303
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,560
Meredith Baxter Dimly.

304
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,737
Good morning.

305
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,225
I am so thrilled to be here
as your student body president

306
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,443
once again.

307
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:42,474
I am here to talk about the talent show,
which I will be heading up again.

308
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:45,833
And the fact that besides
the coveted Golden Hatchet,

309
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:49,892
our wonderful arts committee is providing
a spectacular grand prize this semester:

310
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:54,883
A college scholarship
to the school of your choice!

311
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:56,068
Isn't that amazing?

312
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:58,343
So you can post
your auditions on MySpace...

313
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:25,127
Hey.

314
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,756
Hi.

315
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,250
Oh, good gloss.
Peach party?

316
00:21:29,324 --> 00:21:31,211
Yeah! I just got it!
You like it?

317
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:33,219
- I love it.
- I know.

318
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:37,644
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

319
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:39,138
Great lip gloss.

320
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:41,155
Yeah, it's so shiny and...

321
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:42,789
- Yes, very.
- Yeah.

322
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:44,290
Shiny.

323
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:45,892
Yeah, so...

324
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:47,590
I actually have to get to class.

325
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:49,036
Oh, yeah, of course.
Well...

326
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,923
Have a good class.

327
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:52,745
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Okey-dokey.

328
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,148
- Back at ya.
- See ya.

329
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,595
I miss you.

330
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,445
Wow, Meredith,
starting a new trend at school?

331
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,095
House frump chic.
It suits you.

332
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,778
Seriously, Cherish, I told you,
you may not speak to me before noon.

333
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:23,213
Is that so I don't have
to smell your morning breath?

334
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,067
Or is that the dogs?

335
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:28,680
<i>Did you make your appointment
with Extreme Face Makeover yet?</i>

336
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,696
Voila.

337
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:37,614
Now, you are Fido-fabulous.

338
00:22:38,863 --> 00:22:42,092
Now we are both true fashion icons,
aren't we, Paris?

339
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,785
Yeah, fetching.

340
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:47,046
Get it? Dog?

341
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,134
Fetching?

342
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:49,581
A dog fetches?

343
00:22:51,632 --> 00:22:53,901
These are the jokes, people!

344
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:22,446
Dylan, you've been holding out on me.

345
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:26,411
All this time, I thought
you were just some cool jock.

346
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:33,166
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan.
What's up?

347
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:34,411
Nothing.

348
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:38,280
I miss it.

349
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:39,433
I miss music.

350
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,999
I feel you, but you don't have to.

351
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:43,277
What are you talking about?
I can't hear.

352
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,752
Come here.

353
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:55,818
Feel that?

354
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,265
Yeah, but...

355
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,759
it doesn't mean that I can play it.

356
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:01,649
True. Come here.

357
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:16,391
Try it.

358
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:30,509
Know something, Whitman?

359
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:32,041
You're a weird dude.

360
00:24:32,116 --> 00:24:33,904
But you're okay.
You know that?

361
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:35,433
Wanna learn a few tricks?

362
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,068
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

363
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,860
I can feel that on my neck.

364
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:51,123
So what're you gonna do
for the talent show this year, Meredith?

365
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:53,555
It doesn't matter.
You know she's gonna win.

366
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,929
Just because I'm going to win

367
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:57,418
doesn't mean that
I don't owe all of my fans

368
00:24:57,493 --> 00:24:58,703
a really cool show.

369
00:24:58,772 --> 00:24:59,917
That's true.

370
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:03,916
Hey. What do you think?

371
00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:05,963
Juggling? Please.

372
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,826
That is so not talent show ready.

373
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:28,912
Hi.

374
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:30,258
Who, me?

375
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:31,438
Yeah.

376
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:34,990
Okay, Paris, we're a team,
and Mommy needs your help.

377
00:25:35,062 --> 00:25:37,167
I need you to go over there.
Yes, I do.

378
00:25:37,238 --> 00:25:39,605
And I need you to make sure
that Cameron stops talking

379
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,907
to the evil soccer freak.

380
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,691
Okay? Okay?
Thank you.

381
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:58,996
Wow. Hi, l...

382
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:01,234
- I'm Cloe.
- I'm Cameron.

383
00:26:01,303 --> 00:26:02,961
Yeah, I know.

384
00:26:03,031 --> 00:26:04,111
What classes are you in?

385
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,678
Classes?

386
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:08,564
Stuff.

387
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:23,696
Cloe! You are the biggest klutz ever!

388
00:26:23,768 --> 00:26:24,913
You always ruin everything...

389
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:28,118
Oh, no.

390
00:26:28,184 --> 00:26:30,094
Cloe!

391
00:26:32,472 --> 00:26:34,382
Oh, my gosh.
I am so sorry.

392
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:38,134
Oh! No! You didn't!

393
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:40,405
Jade, you totally did that on purpose!

394
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:53,326
Oh, my gosh!
My hair!

395
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:57,657
Sasha! You stupid... cheerleader!

396
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:59,281
You did not just say that!

397
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:00,433
Keep talking!

398
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:02,294
Someday you'll say something intelligent.

399
00:27:06,553 --> 00:27:07,928
You know what?

400
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,066
You're not as bad as people say you are.

401
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:11,217
You're worse!

402
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:16,502
Food fight!

403
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:20,533
Yasmin, you...

404
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:25,113
Cloe, this is all your fault!

405
00:27:25,178 --> 00:27:26,607
Get down here!

406
00:27:59,836 --> 00:28:01,941
Take that!
Oh, my gosh!

407
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:04,570
No! Jade!

408
00:28:06,524 --> 00:28:08,412
- Oh, my gosh.
- Here, want some of this?

409
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:09,753
Enough already!

410
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:23,189
Oh, my gosh!

411
00:28:31,036 --> 00:28:33,109
Hey, make a hole.
Principal Dimly coming through!

412
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:34,391
Move it!

413
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:36,763
Principal Dimly's coming through.

414
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:38,040
Oh, hi, Daddy.

415
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:39,570
Lookie.

416
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:46,105
I want to know who did this,
or I'm going to...

417
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:48,083
I'm going to pass this over
to Vice Principal Sludge.

418
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:49,565
Rollo, you take over.

419
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:52,531
It's the four girls lying next
to the statue. Hello.

420
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:57,590
You, you, you, and you.

421
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:58,872
Detention.

422
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,973
You started it, clumsy!

423
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,453
I tripped.
Excuse me, Princess Perfect.

424
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:07,933
That is so like you!

425
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,559
You've always been the queen of denial!

426
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:10,459
You know what?

427
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:12,185
Neither one of you ever thinks
anything through.

428
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:13,880
It's always me having
to pick up the pieces.

429
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,601
That's interesting.
We haven't talked in two years.

430
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,126
Ever since you dumped us
to be queen of the dorks!

431
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:19,995
Me?

432
00:29:20,063 --> 00:29:23,096
You haven't spoken to any of us
since you went all cheerleader.

433
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:25,884
I'm not a snob, I'm just better
than you are, yeah!

434
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:28,318
I didn't stop talking to you,
you stopped talking to me.

435
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:29,910
What're you talking about, Sasha?

436
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:32,318
At least we don't buy our friends
with our daddy's bank account.

437
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:35,612
Only because you don't have a dad
or a bank account!

438
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,108
Stop it!

439
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:41,212
All of you, just stop it.

440
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,855
I can't believe
you said that to Cloe.

441
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,992
That's okay.

442
00:29:52,064 --> 00:29:53,952
No. It's not.

443
00:29:55,424 --> 00:29:56,733
When your parents got divorced,

444
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,386
Cloe and her mom were
totally there for you.

445
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:00,831
Don't forget that, Sasha.

446
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:03,896
Cloe.

447
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,107
I'm sorry.

448
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:09,723
Can't believe I said that.

449
00:30:09,793 --> 00:30:10,971
What happened to us?

450
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:12,601
- It's okay.
- We were a team.

451
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:14,299
We always had each other's backs.

452
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:16,758
Seriously. Like when you
canceled your ski trip

453
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,077
to help Cloe study for finals.

454
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:21,407
That's what friends do.
What about you, Yas?

455
00:30:21,473 --> 00:30:23,513
Remember, you completely
crushed those girls

456
00:30:23,585 --> 00:30:26,717
that used to slam Jade
before she grew into her ears.

457
00:30:26,786 --> 00:30:29,885
Well, she would've done
the same for me. Big deal.

458
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,415
It is a big deal.

459
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,595
Friendship is a big deal.

460
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,112
Why aren't we friends anymore?

461
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:40,480
I can't even remember.

462
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:42,848
It's the cliques.
We're all in them.

463
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:44,856
That's just how high school works.

464
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:47,200
Sasha, you're a cheerleader,
Cloe's a jock,

465
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:50,528
and Jade, you spend your time between
the science and home ec geeks.

466
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:52,733
They're not geeks.

467
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:55,007
They're really interesting people.

468
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:58,337
Yeah, but I would never know that
because I'm not in your clique.

469
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:02,207
So... what do we do?

470
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:03,616
We have to take control

471
00:31:03,683 --> 00:31:06,203
of our lives, of our friendships.

472
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:08,184
It's our own fault.

473
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:09,601
We can be friends with each other

474
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,293
and do our own thing, right?

475
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:14,330
Okay. How?

476
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:17,752
We be ourselves,
just like we used to be.

477
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:20,064
I miss my girls.

478
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:21,408
Me, too.

479
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:24,378
I didn't realize
how much until now.

480
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:29,473
BFFs?

481
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,053
BFFs!

482
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,380
- You smell like pasta.
- So do you.

483
00:31:40,228 --> 00:31:42,116
I can't believe them.

484
00:31:42,181 --> 00:31:43,839
This is all your fault, Cameron.

485
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:46,429
Because if you hadn't walked over
and talked to that soccer joke,

486
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:47,777
I wouldn't have had to take action.

487
00:31:47,844 --> 00:31:49,535
And then Daddy's bust
would not have been broken.

488
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:51,613
And those bimbettes wouldn't be
in detention and back together

489
00:31:51,684 --> 00:31:54,051
creating anarchy in my kingdom.

490
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:55,840
Thanks a lot.

491
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:58,364
Well, if all else fails, I can use this.

492
00:31:58,437 --> 00:31:59,714
Meredith!

493
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:03,643
I don't think this, you know,
calls for the jump drive, Meredith.

494
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:05,506
Maybe everything will be
back to normal by tomorrow.

495
00:32:05,574 --> 00:32:07,996
"Maybe everything will be
back to normal by tomorrow."

496
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:10,939
Moron.

497
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:14,178
Let's go.
I can't stand to look at this.

498
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:56,065
<i>So tell me, chica, why so happy?</i>

499
00:32:56,136 --> 00:32:57,597
Is there a boy?

500
00:32:57,671 --> 00:33:00,453
Come on, you've been
holding out on me.

501
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,981
There's no boy, Bubbie.

502
00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:03,714
It's Sasha, Jade, and Cloe.

503
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:04,864
We're a team again!

504
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:06,343
I mean, everyone at school

505
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:08,066
is only friends with
the people in their group,

506
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:10,623
but we've decided to be
friends with everyone.

507
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:12,584
Well, you girls are
doing the right thing.

508
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:14,623
You walk into school,

509
00:33:14,697 --> 00:33:17,152
you socialize with each other,

510
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:18,566
with everyone.

511
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:21,862
You walk in with your
heads held high.

512
00:33:21,928 --> 00:33:24,416
And you walk in

513
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:27,489
with these gorgeous new shoes.

514
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:29,862
<i>JSon divinasl</i>

515
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:32,646
<i>jHolal
Who's your Bubbie?</i>

516
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:36,259
<i>JHolal You are!</i>

517
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:39,809
Bubbie, they're gorgeous!
I love them!

518
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:42,248
Ah-ah-ah.
Sweet talk is cheap.

519
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,452
Pay the lettuce.

520
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,315
<i>Dos chocolatésl</i>

521
00:33:49,386 --> 00:33:51,687
How do you do that?

522
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:54,372
<i>Te amo, Bubbie.</i>

523
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:57,125
Mmm, I love the smell
of retail in the morning.

524
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:00,008
That's my Sasha.

525
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:01,764
Gosh, guys.
I missed you so much.

526
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,940
Two years?
That's, like, forever.

527
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:05,537
So what's the latest
and greatest?

528
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,887
Same old, same old,

529
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:09,026
I just wish my parents
could see who I really am.

530
00:34:09,098 --> 00:34:10,822
- The worst.
- You know, it's not that bad.

531
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,384
It just means
I spend a lot of time

532
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,084
changing clothes
in skinny bathrooms.

533
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:16,610
That's so weird.
Fashion's like your superpower.

534
00:34:16,683 --> 00:34:18,057
You shouldn't have to hide it.

535
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,489
Please, that's like a textbook
definition of superpower.

536
00:34:20,555 --> 00:34:22,442
It's a thing in your life
that you're really amazing at,

537
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,842
but you hide it from the world
so people will think you're normal.

538
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:25,922
And you, Yas?

539
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:27,401
I started writing some music,

540
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,158
and yes, it's sounding pretty good.

541
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:30,722
And no, you can't hear it.

542
00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:32,737
- Stage fright?
- Yeah.

543
00:34:32,812 --> 00:34:35,430
But, Sasha, I mean, it's really
been about missing you guys.

544
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:38,052
Speaking of guys, whoa.

545
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:40,873
- Whoo!
- I know, right?

546
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,947
Yas, look who's walking by

547
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,809
sporting some bad jeans
and looking fine.

548
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:47,494
Oh, my gosh.

549
00:34:47,564 --> 00:34:48,939
He totally just checked you out!

550
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,564
Did you see that? He's into you!

551
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:52,611
What, Dylan?
Are you kidding me?

552
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:54,659
He hates me.

553
00:34:54,732 --> 00:34:56,259
Besides, he is totally not my type.

554
00:34:56,332 --> 00:34:58,569
Oh, you have a type.

555
00:34:58,636 --> 00:35:00,196
Come on, guys.

556
00:35:00,268 --> 00:35:02,276
Dylan is not the least bit
interested in me.

557
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:05,098
OMG. It's so obvious.

558
00:35:05,164 --> 00:35:07,336
Okay, you are so wrong.

559
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,834
He never looks me in the eye,

560
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:10,086
he's never asked me out,

561
00:35:10,156 --> 00:35:12,545
and he can never
even remember my name.

562
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:14,890
Oh, my God.

563
00:35:14,956 --> 00:35:16,418
He's crazy about me!

564
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:20,583
Promise we'll never let anything
break us up ever again.

565
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:21,831
Pinky swear.

566
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:25,513
Pinky swear!

567
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:37,093
I love MySpace.

568
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:56,749
Yeah, that's much.

569
00:35:56,814 --> 00:35:58,276
Next!

570
00:35:58,351 --> 00:36:00,293
Hello! I am Magnificent Mike!

571
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,880
Watch as I place my assistant
into the sword box of death.

572
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:05,260
Prepare to be amazed.

573
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:10,439
Great.

574
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:11,853
You're in.

575
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:20,364
Thank you very much. Next!

576
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,353
If I see one more violin
playing contortionist,

577
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:27,529
I'm going to scream. Next!

578
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:51,494
I think we're making this too complicated.

579
00:36:51,568 --> 00:36:54,187
I mean, if we wanna be friends,
we should just be friends.

580
00:36:54,257 --> 00:36:56,329
I totally agree.
I mean, we walk to school.

581
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:58,540
And we lead by example.
Come on.

582
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:08,040
Yo, Cloe. Come to us.

583
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:13,102
Serious?

584
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:18,288
Oh, hey, Jade.
Come here. Check this out.

585
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:19,947
I'm sorry.

586
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:21,905
Hey, Sasha!

587
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,377
Come sit with us!

588
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,101
I can't.

589
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:32,111
Are people staring?

590
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:33,553
Oh, yeah.

591
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:01,386
Super awkward.

592
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:03,052
Okay, this is weird.

593
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:05,228
I think it's time for plan B.

594
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:06,728
Operation Mingle.

595
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:11,307
Beautiful!

596
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,071
Wait.

597
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:20,303
Perfection!

598
00:38:22,357 --> 00:38:24,528
No, straighten your legs.

599
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:27,979
See, like, don't you have
any fancy pair of sneakers

600
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:29,482
in your Yasmin collection?

601
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:30,985
I mean, anything under 6 inches.

602
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,908
I just want to stay vertical!

603
00:38:33,973 --> 00:38:36,340
Come on, stay vertical!

604
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:37,780
Honey, when I'm through with you,

605
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:40,496
you will be playing your next
soccer game in stilettos.

606
00:38:40,565 --> 00:38:41,994
- You serious?
- Trust me.

607
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,411
Hey, Dexter.

608
00:38:43,477 --> 00:38:45,038
Salutations, Jade.

609
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:46,702
Hey, nerd.

610
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:48,333
Why is she talking to you?

611
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,063
Jade? She's my lab partner.

612
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:52,523
Hey, hottie.

613
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,986
I bet you and I could do
a lab experiment

614
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:56,883
without the Bunsen burner.

615
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,877
You feel me?

616
00:38:57,941 --> 00:38:59,403
Ugh.

617
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,988
I think it behooves you to extend
an apology to the lady.

618
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:05,548
I don't know what you just said,

619
00:39:05,622 --> 00:39:08,818
but I think you better
mind your own business.

620
00:39:08,886 --> 00:39:10,796
Oh, you're gonna cry?

621
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,397
Now, would you like to apologize to the lady?

622
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:35,765
Sorry, Jade.

623
00:39:38,775 --> 00:39:40,368
Dude, you ever think
about playing football?

624
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:48,879
Okay, so, X + Y + Z

625
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:51,319
divided by 3 is?

626
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,319
Okay.

627
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:57,970
Let's try this.

628
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,495
I think this might make more sense.

629
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:02,870
Oh, yeah.

630
00:40:02,936 --> 00:40:04,180
What's a touchdown?

631
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:05,972
Six!

632
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,863
- Plus an extra point?
- One!

633
00:40:07,928 --> 00:40:09,554
Plus a safety?

634
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:10,901
Two.

635
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:12,725
Divided by a field goal?

636
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:13,938
Three?

637
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:17,075
It's good!

638
00:40:17,145 --> 00:40:19,731
Number 1!
Who's number 1?

639
00:40:33,818 --> 00:40:34,898
Killer rip.

640
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,758
Thanks.

641
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:39,160
But I think with a little adjustment,

642
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:40,371
it'd be a whole lot better.

643
00:40:43,578 --> 00:40:45,040
Power comes from your core.

644
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:47,186
Like this.

645
00:40:47,258 --> 00:40:49,942
See? All right?

646
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,417
- All right.
- Try one.

647
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:56,817
You may want to move, just in case.

648
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,384
I'm good.

649
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,182
Okay.

650
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,457
Oh, no!

651
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:07,025
I'm such a klutz!

652
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:10,101
I'm sorry.

653
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:12,276
- Are you okay?
- No worries.

654
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,583
Should we try it again?

655
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,660
Oh, my God, Cherish.

656
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:34,008
What are you doing?

657
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:37,272
I'm trying to imagine you
with a personality.

658
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,991
Take me to the happy place.

659
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,711
Take me to the happy place.

660
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,024
Hurry up.

661
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:46,329
Can't you find somewhere
else to be a freak?

662
00:41:46,397 --> 00:41:47,826
So embarrassing.

663
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:49,145
I'm busy now.

664
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:51,122
Can I ignore you some other time?

665
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:52,342
Didn't you hear, munchkin?

666
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:54,234
Everyone does what I tell them to do.

667
00:41:54,301 --> 00:41:56,156
Not from what I hear.

668
00:41:57,116 --> 00:41:58,643
Ouch.

669
00:41:58,717 --> 00:41:59,928
Oh, whatever, Avery.

670
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,266
This is just a temporary loss of control.

671
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:09,203
I can assure you, I will bring order
back to our school.

672
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:12,374
Now, girls, think.

673
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:15,609
When was I at the height
of my popularity?

674
00:42:15,678 --> 00:42:18,045
- Last week?
- Last year's talent show?

675
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,154
- I know this one.
- Yes, Quinn?

676
00:42:20,222 --> 00:42:21,782
Your super sweet 16.

677
00:42:21,854 --> 00:42:23,196
She's totally right.

678
00:42:23,262 --> 00:42:25,018
That was, like, the most
amazing party ever.

679
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:26,548
Remember, everyone was,
like, sucking up to you

680
00:42:26,622 --> 00:42:28,727
for weeks before just
to get an invitation.

681
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:29,780
Well, then, it's settled.

682
00:42:29,854 --> 00:42:32,309
I'm throwing another
super sweet 16 party.

683
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,684
Um, but you're already 16.

684
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:39,355
I'm throwing
another super sweet 16.

685
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:42,555
In fact, I'll have MTV
tape the whole thing.

686
00:42:42,623 --> 00:42:46,169
My mom is best friends
with the producers.

687
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,832
Why is she throwing
another sweet 16?

688
00:42:47,903 --> 00:42:49,975
I'm not really sure, exactly.

689
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:51,902
I'm going to use the invitations

690
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:55,513
to bring organization
and harmony back to our school.

691
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:56,957
Oh, I get it.

692
00:42:57,023 --> 00:42:58,267
No cliquey, no tickey.

693
00:42:58,335 --> 00:42:59,830
You have a visitor.

694
00:42:59,904 --> 00:43:01,692
And that'll crush
those snotty girls forever.

695
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,662
And then we'll live happily ever after.
Brilliant!

696
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:08,031
Yo, Cherish, you left
your shoes at ballet class.

697
00:43:09,696 --> 00:43:11,387
Hey, it's a total chick farm.

698
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:14,107
Athletic and yet very hot.

699
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:15,069
Me likey.

700
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:17,340
Me thinky you're a twerp.

701
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:18,902
So what do you think
of my hair today?

702
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:20,764
I did this side just for you.

703
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:23,866
Don't you need a license
to be that ugly?

704
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,360
Ooh, I like 'em feisty.

705
00:43:28,224 --> 00:43:29,817
Isn't that Yasmin's little brother?

706
00:43:29,888 --> 00:43:32,277
Yeah. What's he doing here?

707
00:43:32,353 --> 00:43:34,393
<i>Hey, looking good, mamitas.</i>

708
00:43:34,465 --> 00:43:36,440
Ugh. Okay, that is truly gross.

709
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:37,592
Oh, my God.

710
00:43:37,664 --> 00:43:40,086
You have the most incredible hair ever.

711
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:41,371
I know, right?

712
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:42,816
I'm going out for best hair this year.

713
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:45,914
No doubt. Anyway...

714
00:43:45,985 --> 00:43:48,636
why don't you come over here
and tell me all about yourself.

715
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:49,916
Are you kidding me?

716
00:43:49,986 --> 00:43:53,248
Okay. Here, keep this dry.

717
00:44:02,818 --> 00:44:05,720
So, your sister Yasmin.

718
00:44:05,794 --> 00:44:08,063
She is so sweet.

719
00:44:08,131 --> 00:44:10,367
I mean, what's it like
having such a perfect sister?

720
00:44:10,434 --> 00:44:12,987
Yeah, what's it like?

721
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:14,717
Perfect? Ha ha!

722
00:44:14,787 --> 00:44:17,208
Have you actually met her?

723
00:44:17,282 --> 00:44:18,908
You're so funny.

724
00:44:18,979 --> 00:44:21,467
I mean, she's just so good
at everything, right?

725
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:25,117
You think so? Check this out.

726
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:27,870
It's truly fantastic.

727
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:36,607
Wow.

728
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:38,683
She is precious.

729
00:44:38,755 --> 00:44:41,602
I just have to have this
for my collection.

730
00:44:41,668 --> 00:44:43,872
Do you think you could
transfer it to this?

731
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:49,882
Yeah, sure.

732
00:44:57,764 --> 00:45:01,026
Meredith's MTV...
my super sweet 16.

733
00:45:01,092 --> 00:45:04,387
Yeah, it's gonna be totally even more
incredibly awesome than the last one.

734
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,794
How excited are you?

735
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,900
She already had a sweet 16.

736
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:09,434
What do you think she's up to?

737
00:45:09,509 --> 00:45:10,621
Does it matter?

738
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:12,634
Hello? It's a party.

739
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:13,853
This can't be good.

740
00:45:13,924 --> 00:45:15,037
Come on.

741
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,130
Oh, my God, how cute is this?

742
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:22,466
Darling. Love it.

743
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:24,508
Apparently so.

744
00:45:24,581 --> 00:45:26,141
Come on, girl. Give it up.

745
00:45:26,213 --> 00:45:27,260
Tell us what's wrong.

746
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:28,959
I'm not going to Meredith's party.

747
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:32,095
Okay? I can't afford
to buy anything new.

748
00:45:32,165 --> 00:45:33,823
You guys need to go without me.

749
00:45:33,893 --> 00:45:34,821
I mean it.

750
00:45:34,886 --> 00:45:37,155
Oh, my God, Cloe.
Stop it right now, okay?

751
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:38,432
The only way
you could embarrass us

752
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:39,679
is if you don't walk into Meredith's

753
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:41,953
ridiculously extreme extravaganza.

754
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:44,029
Yeah, and we've been
pulled apart for too long.

755
00:45:44,102 --> 00:45:46,207
It's not happening again,
not for anything,

756
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:47,871
and especially not for Meredith.

757
00:45:47,942 --> 00:45:51,455
But, Sasha,
I have nothing to wear.

758
00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:53,086
You do now.

759
00:45:53,158 --> 00:45:54,685
I have two guilt certificates.

760
00:45:54,758 --> 00:45:56,798
One from my mom
and one from my dad.

761
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:59,139
And now one for you.

762
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:01,443
Hey, divorce isn't all that bad.

763
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:04,413
Now come on, girl, we've got
some serious shopping to do!

764
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:05,435
Mwah!

765
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,348
Come on!

766
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:07,392
Aah!

767
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,128
The mall hath no fury
like a shopper scorned.

768
00:47:13,193 --> 00:47:14,087
Yeah.

769
00:47:14,153 --> 00:47:15,136
Good job, girl.

770
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:16,322
- Thank you.
- I'm proud of you.

771
00:47:17,513 --> 00:47:19,237
Pop your balloons
to see if you're invited

772
00:47:19,306 --> 00:47:22,023
to my MTV
Super Sweet 16 party!

773
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,865
Now, seating will be
organized according to groups,

774
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,840
so if you don't belong to a group,

775
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:30,249
you really can't come to my party.

776
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,932
So until then, I'll be watching you.

777
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:35,141
Go ahead, pop 'em!

778
00:47:40,747 --> 00:47:44,162
Oh, my God, this is so fabulous.

779
00:47:44,235 --> 00:47:47,050
I knew it.
It was too good to be true.

780
00:47:49,697 --> 00:47:52,447
I just don't understand
why Meredith is so evil.

781
00:47:52,513 --> 00:47:54,749
I mean, what are we gonna do about her
party?

782
00:47:54,816 --> 00:47:56,987
Nothing, okay? We don't go.

783
00:47:57,056 --> 00:48:00,057
If we can't go to the festival
of Meredith on our own terms,

784
00:48:00,129 --> 00:48:02,016
then trust me, it's not worth it.

785
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:04,700
Yas, it's gonna be
an amazing party!

786
00:48:04,769 --> 00:48:06,524
Yeah. And, if we don't go,

787
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,343
we can be branded as
total losers and outcasts.

788
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,165
But I'm willing to take the risk.

789
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:13,144
I'm with Yasmin.
Skip the ego trip.

790
00:48:13,217 --> 00:48:14,679
Yeah, I second that emotion.

791
00:48:14,753 --> 00:48:17,022
- But, guys...
- Sasha, no.

792
00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:20,156
Okay, I hear you.

793
00:48:20,226 --> 00:48:22,943
It's just... there's this
tragic new outfit out there

794
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:24,416
that's just calling my name.

795
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:27,548
But... hey, you know?

796
00:48:27,618 --> 00:48:30,203
I'm hanging up and changing my number.

797
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:31,681
Hold me.

798
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:34,267
Oh, honey. You'll be just fine.

799
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:35,744
Come on.

800
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,716
No.

801
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:20,954
I agree. Absolutely not.

802
00:49:22,595 --> 00:49:24,417
Don't look, Paris.

803
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,484
I'd rather die.

804
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:35,421
That's the one.

805
00:49:35,491 --> 00:49:36,735
Show me...

806
00:49:36,803 --> 00:49:38,908
I need a little
something right there.

807
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,401
Thank you.

808
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:43,581
I just love me.

809
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,465
I look so hot.

810
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,881
High five.

811
00:49:54,948 --> 00:49:56,322
Okay, keep going.

812
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,403
Wow. Your singing's amazing.

813
00:50:22,468 --> 00:50:25,021
Oh, my God. Really?

814
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:26,782
Yeah, like beyond amazing.

815
00:50:26,851 --> 00:50:28,794
Seriously? Thanks.

816
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:31,203
But I don't understand.

817
00:50:31,268 --> 00:50:32,960
I mean, you can't...

818
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:34,970
Hear?

819
00:50:35,044 --> 00:50:36,254
It's okay. You can say it.

820
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:39,456
It's cool. I can't hear, but I heard you.

821
00:50:39,525 --> 00:50:42,591
Okay. I'll bite.

822
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:44,865
Here. Come here. Let me show you.

823
00:50:47,685 --> 00:50:48,830
Sing something.

824
00:50:53,189 --> 00:50:56,003
Wow! So that's
how you heard me?

825
00:50:56,068 --> 00:51:00,259
Well, I didn't exactly
hear your voice.

826
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:02,627
I felt your voice.

827
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:04,515
And it felt amazing.

828
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:05,475
Awesome.

829
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:07,036
Yeah, you are.

830
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:08,190
You have a serious gift.

831
00:51:08,262 --> 00:51:09,952
You did sign up for
the talent show, didn't you?

832
00:51:10,021 --> 00:51:10,969
Because you're definitely winning.

833
00:51:11,045 --> 00:51:13,282
Oh, thanks, but no thanks.

834
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:14,626
I can't sing in front of people.

835
00:51:14,694 --> 00:51:17,149
I literally get ill. It's not pretty.

836
00:51:17,222 --> 00:51:18,651
You know what?

837
00:51:18,726 --> 00:51:20,668
I can't hear, but I learned to spin.

838
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:27,392
You can do it if you really want to.

839
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:30,757
Seriously, it'd be a crime
to keep that voice inside yourself.

840
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:35,361
What's that mean?

841
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,738
Go for it.

842
00:51:42,087 --> 00:51:44,737
Mom? Wow.

843
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:47,742
This must be a major party.

844
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,789
Mom?

845
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:53,828
Mom, are you okay?

846
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:55,650
You're burning up!

847
00:51:55,718 --> 00:51:58,436
Oh, I have to cook the food.
I have to cook the food.

848
00:51:58,503 --> 00:51:59,877
- No, Mom.
- I have to cook the food.

849
00:51:59,942 --> 00:52:01,436
Mom, you can't work.

850
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,591
You need to sleep.

851
00:52:02,663 --> 00:52:04,964
- Where?
- Mom. Mom.

852
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,110
Mom, look at me!

853
00:52:06,183 --> 00:52:10,307
You need to sleep.

854
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:12,230
Okay.

855
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,012
A couple hours. You promise
you'll wake me up?

856
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:18,047
I promise.
Just get some rest.

857
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:19,777
Please, Mom.

858
00:52:25,991 --> 00:52:28,261
Girl, are you joking?
It's Saturday morning.

859
00:52:28,327 --> 00:52:29,756
- This better be good.
- What's wrong?

860
00:52:29,831 --> 00:52:32,352
It's an emergency.
I need your help.

861
00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:33,372
- I'm there.
- We're there.

862
00:52:34,503 --> 00:52:36,412
So we need to make 150 of each dish.

863
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,237
Cook? You want me to cook?

864
00:52:39,303 --> 00:52:41,637
Girl, I burn water.

865
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:42,981
Yeah, are you kidding?

866
00:52:43,048 --> 00:52:45,219
'Cause there's definitely
no way I can do this.

867
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:46,181
What's this?

868
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:47,677
Come on, Jade. We can do it.

869
00:52:47,752 --> 00:52:48,832
You're a designer.

870
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:51,292
Just think of it as...
high fashion for food.

871
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:53,124
Let's do it.

872
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:20,871
Cloe, you didn't wake me up.

873
00:53:20,936 --> 00:53:23,140
It's 5:00. I've got so much to...

874
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:27,747
Who did this?

875
00:53:27,817 --> 00:53:29,475
We did!

876
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:38,406
This is amazing.

877
00:53:38,473 --> 00:53:40,415
You girls are absolute angels.

878
00:53:40,488 --> 00:53:42,496
Aren't we?

879
00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:43,714
It was a breeze.

880
00:53:45,257 --> 00:53:46,151
What?

881
00:53:46,217 --> 00:53:47,494
Oh, God...

882
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,354
Mom, what's wrong?

883
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:55,399
My servers can't make it.

884
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,183
This is the biggest party of my career.

885
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,119
Where am I gonna get
servers in two hours?

886
00:54:01,192 --> 00:54:02,470
We're free.

887
00:54:02,538 --> 00:54:04,577
No, wait. Wait. Wait.

888
00:54:04,649 --> 00:54:05,729
This is Meredith's sweet 16.

889
00:54:05,801 --> 00:54:07,395
Mom, are you kidding?

890
00:54:07,466 --> 00:54:09,854
I couldn't turn it down, honey.
I'm sorry.

891
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,653
No. No. No. It's okay.

892
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:12,834
I understand.

893
00:54:12,906 --> 00:54:14,084
I'm just gonna cancel it.

894
00:54:14,154 --> 00:54:15,976
We're in.

895
00:54:17,258 --> 00:54:18,664
You sure you want to do it?

896
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,206
What's the worst
that could happen?

897
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,789
Why the sad faces?

898
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,476
Clowns are supposed to be happy.

899
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:43,816
Be happy.

900
00:54:49,546 --> 00:54:51,433
Perfect.

901
00:54:53,835 --> 00:54:56,803
If you guys want to back out,
I'll totally understand.

902
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:58,467
All right.

903
00:54:58,538 --> 00:54:59,748
Everyone's out there
waiting for food,

904
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:01,728
and gosh darn it,
we're gonna serve it.

905
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:04,737
I just need five little
minutes and F.E.R.

906
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,942
Girl, I may be wearing
circus clothes and a clown nose,

907
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:09,985
but I draw a line
at wearing animals.

908
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:12,393
Uh, no. Not fur.

909
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:13,921
F-E-R:

910
00:55:13,995 --> 00:55:16,035
My fashion emergency raft.

911
00:55:16,107 --> 00:55:19,042
I never leave home without it.

912
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,898
Well, I got S-M-K:

913
00:55:21,964 --> 00:55:24,265
Sasha's make-up kit.

914
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:27,202
Holla!

915
00:55:50,283 --> 00:55:53,666
Now that's what I call clown couture.

916
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,045
Giddyup, Jumbo.

917
00:56:07,116 --> 00:56:08,523
Hi, everyone.

918
00:56:08,588 --> 00:56:10,376
Hi, MTV. It's Meredith.

919
00:56:10,444 --> 00:56:12,332
Isn't this amazing?

920
00:56:12,397 --> 00:56:14,568
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad
you could make it

921
00:56:14,636 --> 00:56:16,709
to my super sweet 16 party.

922
00:56:16,781 --> 00:56:19,563
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Hi, everyone.

923
00:56:19,629 --> 00:56:21,003
I know. So cool, right?

924
00:56:21,068 --> 00:56:24,036
Best party ever already,
and we're just starting.

925
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,510
Fellas, you guys, look.

926
00:56:29,581 --> 00:56:32,069
Oh, yeah!

927
00:56:32,141 --> 00:56:34,530
Oh!

928
00:56:37,262 --> 00:56:39,268
I'm so excited to be here.

929
00:56:43,405 --> 00:56:45,860
Candy, quiche, and pickle puffs!

930
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:51,429
Thank you so much for coming.

931
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:54,886
Hello? Me time now.

932
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:58,437
It's me. On an elephant.

933
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:11,435
That was amazing.

934
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:13,193
Get out of my way.

935
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:18,089
Well, don't you look adorable.

936
00:57:18,158 --> 00:57:19,684
But you're not here to look adorable.

937
00:57:19,758 --> 00:57:21,547
You're here to work.

938
00:57:21,614 --> 00:57:23,272
It's Clover, isn't it?

939
00:57:23,342 --> 00:57:25,164
- Cloe.
- Oopsies.

940
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:27,434
Anyway, we're all dying of thirst,

941
00:57:27,502 --> 00:57:28,746
so you wanna get us a soda?

942
00:57:28,814 --> 00:57:30,853
I'll take mine with a slice of lime.

943
00:57:30,926 --> 00:57:34,309
Oh, you know, make that
a lemon with a cherry.

944
00:57:34,382 --> 00:57:37,481
But take off the stem
and put in two umbrellas.

945
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,241
One green and, um...

946
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:41,350
one yellow, 'kay?

947
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:43,113
Oh, no! Listen, Missy, you...

948
00:57:43,183 --> 00:57:44,557
Sasha.

949
00:57:45,806 --> 00:57:47,978
- Step back.
- Listen...

950
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,672
make sure your friends
keep a cork in it

951
00:57:49,742 --> 00:57:52,645
because I wouldn't want
to have to fire your mother.

952
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,798
Again.

953
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,951
Okay, what was that about?

954
00:57:59,022 --> 00:58:00,102
Nothing.

955
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:01,385
I don't want to talk about it.

956
00:58:01,454 --> 00:58:02,981
Come on, let's work.

957
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:13,637
Ooh!

958
00:58:13,711 --> 00:58:15,238
Hi, I'm Meredith's sister.

959
00:58:15,311 --> 00:58:18,410
I've had to put up with
this every day for 11 years.

960
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:21,129
Can you feel my pain?
Yeah, I'm stuck with her.

961
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:22,727
You guys look like total rock stars.

962
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,108
I look like a circus freak.

963
00:58:24,176 --> 00:58:25,452
I'll pay you to kidnap me.

964
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:27,243
I'm worth a lot.

965
00:58:27,312 --> 00:58:28,260
I'll do it.

966
00:58:28,335 --> 00:58:30,190
That nose is workin' for me.

967
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:31,302
Me likey.

968
00:58:58,928 --> 00:59:01,197
You're a very beautiful girl, cupcake.

969
00:59:01,264 --> 00:59:02,606
And you look cute
as a button tonight.

970
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:03,600
Don't let anyone kid ya.

971
00:59:03,664 --> 00:59:05,322
You're a good dad.

972
00:59:05,392 --> 00:59:07,247
Thank you, uh, jellybean.

973
00:59:07,313 --> 00:59:10,029
May I have your attention, please?

974
00:59:10,096 --> 00:59:12,846
For our first super fun event
of my super evening,

975
00:59:12,912 --> 00:59:14,636
It's time for the entertainment:

976
00:59:14,705 --> 00:59:15,784
Me!

977
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:17,929
Please hold your applause
until the end.

978
01:00:38,642 --> 01:00:41,063
We love you!

979
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,284
Yeah!

980
01:00:44,658 --> 01:00:46,993
Thank you so much.

981
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:50,026
And now, for a real treat,

982
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:53,677
I'd like to invite my dear,
dear friend to go next.

983
01:00:53,746 --> 01:00:54,956
Oh, my God.

984
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,914
I can't believe she's
gonna let me go first.

985
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,408
Yasie, darling.

986
01:00:58,483 --> 01:01:01,899
A little birdie told me
that you just love to sing.

987
01:01:06,772 --> 01:01:09,324
Come on up here. Come on.

988
01:01:09,395 --> 01:01:13,105
- Come on.
- No. No, please don't.

989
01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:14,218
Don't do this to her.

990
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:15,273
She has stage fright!

991
01:01:15,347 --> 01:01:16,296
No, stop!

992
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,370
This is gonna be fantastic.

993
01:01:24,755 --> 01:01:25,649
Raise the roof, Yasmin!

994
01:01:30,963 --> 01:01:33,168
We love you, Yasmin!

995
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,994
Come on, Yasmin. It's my birthday.

996
01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:53,329
Show us what you can do.

997
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:08,977
Oh, dear. She is so adorably shy.

998
01:02:09,044 --> 01:02:10,702
Precious.

999
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:13,904
Well, I have had the privilege
of watching her sing,

1000
01:02:13,973 --> 01:02:15,533
and I just want you
all to see it.

1001
01:02:34,613 --> 01:02:37,002
Hey, come on, you guys.
Dance with me.

1002
01:02:39,701 --> 01:02:40,846
Up! Up! Up!

1003
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:41,997
Come on! Everyone!

1004
01:02:44,117 --> 01:02:45,939
Stop it!

1005
01:02:48,405 --> 01:02:49,299
Do something about this.

1006
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,477
I'm on it.

1007
01:02:57,878 --> 01:02:58,826
Stop it!

1008
01:03:05,173 --> 01:03:08,916
And now, for my second change
of the evening.

1009
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:12,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
my Aquamarine Meringue.

1010
01:03:28,118 --> 01:03:30,452
Well, is everyone
having a good time?

1011
01:03:31,991 --> 01:03:36,366
Is this, like, the best
super sweet 16 party ever?

1012
01:03:36,439 --> 01:03:39,254
Do you guys, like,
totally love me?

1013
01:03:40,246 --> 01:03:41,556
What did she say?

1014
01:03:41,623 --> 01:03:43,149
Let's... Let's start dancing.

1015
01:03:43,222 --> 01:03:44,564
Okay?

1016
01:03:46,871 --> 01:03:49,740
Hi, MTV.
Welcome to my super sweet 16 party.

1017
01:03:49,815 --> 01:03:52,019
We love you, MTV!

1018
01:03:52,087 --> 01:03:54,258
My party was totally better than yours.

1019
01:03:59,479 --> 01:04:01,203
I am so sorry.

1020
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:05,741
<i>Foie gras mousse?</i>

1021
01:04:05,814 --> 01:04:10,092
I'm pretty good at lip reading,
not that good.

1022
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:11,542
You looked great on the big screen.

1023
01:04:11,608 --> 01:04:13,877
Oh, don't remind me.

1024
01:04:13,943 --> 01:04:15,284
So humiliating.

1025
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:17,206
Yeah, don't let it get to you.

1026
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:18,645
Consider the source.

1027
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,364
Excuse me! Yasmin!

1028
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,221
Get back to work.
That is not what I'm paying you for.

1029
01:04:31,288 --> 01:04:33,743
No fraternizing with my guests.

1030
01:04:35,448 --> 01:04:37,358
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

1031
01:04:37,432 --> 01:04:39,187
Shoo! Go! Go!

1032
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,086
Excuse me!

1033
01:04:45,144 --> 01:04:46,454
Jumbo, come here, boy!

1034
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:48,081
Go. Go, Jumbo, go.

1035
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:51,281
Oh, my gosh.

1036
01:04:51,353 --> 01:04:54,254
Well, if it isn't Cloe the klutzy clown.

1037
01:04:54,328 --> 01:04:55,735
You're fired.

1038
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,102
Now clean up this disgusting mess
before my guests see it.

1039
01:04:58,168 --> 01:05:00,372
Cameron, what are you doing?
Get up.

1040
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,190
Cameron!

1041
01:05:03,256 --> 01:05:05,525
Cameron? Cameron?

1042
01:05:05,592 --> 01:05:06,803
Get me a drink?

1043
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:11,157
Get your own drink.

1044
01:05:11,225 --> 01:05:13,778
What? Cameron!

1045
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:18,832
Thanks a lot, Jumbo.

1046
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:34,419
Oh, what are you looking at?

1047
01:05:34,489 --> 01:05:38,166
Stop it! Stop it!

1048
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:40,983
This is my MTV super sweet 16 party!

1049
01:05:41,049 --> 01:05:44,115
Everybody go back to your
assigned tables immediately!

1050
01:05:50,393 --> 01:05:51,735
Thank you.

1051
01:06:01,882 --> 01:06:03,987
Meredith, are you okay?

1052
01:06:04,058 --> 01:06:04,951
Do you need a hand?

1053
01:06:05,017 --> 01:06:06,327
I can knit you a towel.

1054
01:06:06,394 --> 01:06:07,442
I know CPR.

1055
01:06:07,514 --> 01:06:10,678
Look at me!
You guys have ruined everything!

1056
01:06:10,746 --> 01:06:13,430
There was gonna be
a cake and dancing

1057
01:06:13,498 --> 01:06:15,286
and an amazing goodie bag.

1058
01:06:15,353 --> 01:06:19,794
But now the party's over!
You've ruined it for everyone!

1059
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:21,492
You... you...

1060
01:06:21,563 --> 01:06:23,450
brats!

1061
01:06:23,514 --> 01:06:24,976
Hi, MTV.

1062
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:29,590
This is the best party I have ever
been to in my whole life.

1063
01:06:29,658 --> 01:06:31,763
Happy Birthday, Meredith.

1064
01:06:36,443 --> 01:06:39,574
Well, she's brought back cliques.

1065
01:06:39,643 --> 01:06:41,618
Ok, so, what do we do now?

1066
01:06:41,691 --> 01:06:42,934
Sasha?

1067
01:06:43,002 --> 01:06:44,147
Hey, Bethany.

1068
01:06:44,218 --> 01:06:46,128
So, we've been talking,

1069
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:48,210
and you're a really
great cheerleader,

1070
01:06:48,283 --> 01:06:50,454
and we really want you
to be a part of the team,

1071
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:52,889
but if you don't want
to hang out with us,

1072
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:56,217
then maybe you don't have
the right kind of school spirit for the job.

1073
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:58,322
So you're saying
if I'm not a part of your clique,

1074
01:06:58,395 --> 01:07:00,021
I'm off the squad?

1075
01:07:00,091 --> 01:07:01,750
Think about it.

1076
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,222
Hey.

1077
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:09,680
You either need to spend
more time with us,

1078
01:07:09,755 --> 01:07:11,796
or we need to cut you
from the roster.

1079
01:07:11,868 --> 01:07:14,388
Dexter... don't be that guy.

1080
01:07:14,459 --> 01:07:16,216
I'm afraid that's not up to me.

1081
01:07:18,108 --> 01:07:20,529
We had a real chemistry, Jade.

1082
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,409
I'm not doing it.

1083
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:26,134
Come on, Yas, get over it.

1084
01:07:26,204 --> 01:07:29,400
The only way to get everyone
back together is to win the talent show.

1085
01:07:29,468 --> 01:07:31,672
Meredith wins every year.

1086
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,627
You're the only one
that can break her streak.

1087
01:07:33,692 --> 01:07:36,376
Maybe so, but I'm still not doing it.

1088
01:07:36,445 --> 01:07:38,103
Next subject, please.

1089
01:07:38,172 --> 01:07:39,065
A chicken!

1090
01:07:40,603 --> 01:07:43,287
<i>Fine, that's me.
El pollo Yasmin.</i>

1091
01:07:43,356 --> 01:07:45,047
Look, if you sing, I'll spin.

1092
01:07:45,116 --> 01:07:46,044
Really?

1093
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:47,286
- Yeah.
- No.

1094
01:07:47,357 --> 01:07:49,844
Come on!
We'll all help you.

1095
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:51,542
You'll sing, I'll choreograph,

1096
01:07:51,612 --> 01:07:53,139
Cloe will splash the background
with her video bling,

1097
01:07:53,213 --> 01:07:54,106
and Jade will...

1098
01:07:54,172 --> 01:07:55,579
What, add numbers
faster than anyone?

1099
01:07:55,644 --> 01:07:56,823
2, 147.

1100
01:07:56,893 --> 01:07:57,841
3,268.

1101
01:07:57,917 --> 01:07:59,826
5,415. Big whoop.

1102
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,682
Hello, fashion diva.
We're gonna need costumes.

1103
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:03,730
Now you're talking, sister.

1104
01:08:03,804 --> 01:08:05,014
And we're gonna need
backup singers, too.

1105
01:08:05,084 --> 01:08:06,612
- And dancers.
- Why stop there?

1106
01:08:06,685 --> 01:08:08,888
We should get everyone who
Meredith shot down to perform with us.

1107
01:08:08,956 --> 01:08:10,418
Perfect! Then you don't need me.

1108
01:08:10,492 --> 01:08:12,282
Ugh. Okay, how about this?

1109
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:14,203
The winner gets a scholarship.

1110
01:08:14,269 --> 01:08:16,952
Know anyone who might need that?

1111
01:08:17,022 --> 01:08:20,021
Cloe.

1112
01:08:20,093 --> 01:08:21,752
Okay, fine.

1113
01:08:21,822 --> 01:08:24,309
But only for Cloe.

1114
01:08:24,381 --> 01:08:25,625
But I still can't do it.

1115
01:08:25,693 --> 01:08:28,082
- Why?
- Why?

1116
01:08:28,157 --> 01:08:30,546
Because we don't have a name.

1117
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:34,744
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the brats?

1118
01:08:34,813 --> 01:08:36,220
Bratz.

1119
01:08:36,285 --> 01:08:37,529
Cloe, you're a genius.

1120
01:08:37,597 --> 01:08:39,157
I am?

1121
01:08:39,229 --> 01:08:42,361
- Bratz!
- Yeah!

1122
01:08:46,782 --> 01:08:49,367
Ready? 5, 6, 7, 8.

1123
01:09:00,477 --> 01:09:02,550
I love it. Next!

1124
01:09:12,447 --> 01:09:14,901
I got some great images
that I took of the mime.

1125
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:22,846
You're awesome.

1126
01:09:26,943 --> 01:09:27,837
That looks good.

1127
01:09:39,071 --> 01:09:41,373
- You're in.
- 5, 6, 7, 8...

1128
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,261
Stop! You're killing us.

1129
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:44,984
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, California.

1130
01:09:45,054 --> 01:09:46,331
Boring.

1131
01:09:50,175 --> 01:09:51,069
Horrible.

1132
01:09:51,135 --> 01:09:52,761
Horrible. You're in.

1133
01:09:55,936 --> 01:09:57,081
Next!

1134
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:59,126
I am Plunger Man!

1135
01:10:01,184 --> 01:10:02,907
Come on, now.
Get up.

1136
01:10:20,609 --> 01:10:23,575
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hi, Dad.

1137
01:10:23,647 --> 01:10:25,884
Aren't you supposed
to be at Mom's tonight?

1138
01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:29,050
Oh, Dad, I'm so exhausted,
I completely forgot.

1139
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,291
You know what? You go on to bed.
I'll call Mom.

1140
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,669
And I just wanna
tell you something.

1141
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:34,078
I'm really proud of you.

1142
01:10:34,144 --> 01:10:36,152
- You are?
- Yeah.

1143
01:10:36,225 --> 01:10:38,777
You and your friends have put aside
all your differences

1144
01:10:38,848 --> 01:10:39,928
and made it work.

1145
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,582
Thanks, Dad.

1146
01:10:43,648 --> 01:10:45,853
Maybe one day you and Mom
will do the same thing.

1147
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:48,441
Yeah. Maybe.

1148
01:10:52,577 --> 01:10:54,681
Bratz?

1149
01:10:54,752 --> 01:10:57,753
Oh-no. No way.
Nuh-uh. I don't think so.

1150
01:10:57,825 --> 01:10:59,385
They ruined my super sweet 16.

1151
01:10:59,457 --> 01:11:02,043
I am not going to put
them in my talent show.

1152
01:11:05,216 --> 01:11:06,265
Hello, Yasmin?

1153
01:11:06,369 --> 01:11:10,198
So, you see, it's really
in your best interests

1154
01:11:10,273 --> 01:11:11,419
to drop out of the talent show.

1155
01:11:11,489 --> 01:11:14,391
Or I'll be forced to go public

1156
01:11:14,465 --> 01:11:15,710
with all these embarrassing flaws

1157
01:11:15,778 --> 01:11:17,272
that I have right here
on your friends,

1158
01:11:17,345 --> 01:11:20,062
Sasha, Jade,
and particularly Clover.

1159
01:11:20,129 --> 01:11:21,242
Cloe.

1160
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:22,742
Same thing.

1161
01:11:22,817 --> 01:11:25,752
I'm pretty sure Cloe wouldn't want
the entire student body

1162
01:11:25,826 --> 01:11:27,898
to know that when
her mother worked for us,

1163
01:11:27,969 --> 01:11:30,620
things just disappeared.

1164
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:33,373
Poor girl. How terribly pitiful.

1165
01:11:33,441 --> 01:11:35,001
You are so devious.

1166
01:11:35,073 --> 01:11:37,627
Thank you.

1167
01:11:37,698 --> 01:11:39,802
I mean, I hate to do it,

1168
01:11:39,873 --> 01:11:43,103
but you can certainly see
my predicament, and yours.

1169
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,446
Can't you?

1170
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:46,489
How pathetic.

1171
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:48,350
I can't believe you.
You spend half your time

1172
01:11:48,418 --> 01:11:50,327
documenting dirt on everyone else?

1173
01:11:50,401 --> 01:11:52,060
You really need to get a life.

1174
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:54,584
Oh, I have one.
And it is fabulous.

1175
01:11:54,657 --> 01:11:56,862
Save it.

1176
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:58,653
Just leave Cloe alone.

1177
01:11:58,722 --> 01:12:00,315
Smart move.

1178
01:12:06,338 --> 01:12:08,923
5, 6, 7, 8.

1179
01:12:08,994 --> 01:12:10,271
1, 2, 3, 4,

1180
01:12:10,338 --> 01:12:11,899
5, 6, 7, 8.

1181
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:13,825
1, 2, 3, 4,

1182
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:15,680
5, 6, 7, 8.

1183
01:12:15,747 --> 01:12:17,503
Hit 1, 2, 3, 4.

1184
01:12:17,571 --> 01:12:19,163
5, 6, 7,8.

1185
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,340
1, 2, 3, 4,

1186
01:12:21,411 --> 01:12:22,785
5, 6, 7, 8.

1187
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:24,955
Yas, come here.
You have to see this.

1188
01:12:25,026 --> 01:12:26,849
We are so tight. Check.
Watch, show her, ready?

1189
01:12:26,915 --> 01:12:28,922
Wait. Wait. Guys, wait!

1190
01:12:30,338 --> 01:12:32,728
I need to tell you something.

1191
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:38,906
I'm dropping out of the talent show.

1192
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,287
I just can't do it.

1193
01:12:41,347 --> 01:12:42,295
- What?
- What?

1194
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:43,647
I'm sorry.

1195
01:12:43,714 --> 01:12:46,617
It's just, you guys kind
of pulled me into it.

1196
01:12:46,691 --> 01:12:48,381
And I never really
wanted to do it anyway.

1197
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:50,240
This is a joke, right?

1198
01:12:50,307 --> 01:12:53,024
No, it's not.

1199
01:12:53,091 --> 01:12:55,360
It's just not my thing.
It's kind of stupid.

1200
01:12:55,428 --> 01:12:59,039
Stupid?

1201
01:12:59,107 --> 01:13:00,864
No, what's stupid is...

1202
01:13:00,932 --> 01:13:04,193
is that I'm almost getting
kicked off of my soccer team

1203
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:06,496
and you, you're the one dropping out?

1204
01:13:06,564 --> 01:13:09,912
Whatever. I don't want to talk about it.

1205
01:13:09,987 --> 01:13:11,297
You don't wanna talk about it?

1206
01:13:11,364 --> 01:13:13,916
Can we talk about the fact
that my grades have dropped?

1207
01:13:13,987 --> 01:13:15,002
How selfish can you be?

1208
01:13:15,076 --> 01:13:17,443
What happened to sticking together?

1209
01:13:17,508 --> 01:13:21,632
I guess I'm just not feeling it anymore.

1210
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,129
Sorry.

1211
01:13:23,204 --> 01:13:25,626
Right. Okay.

1212
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:28,252
Well, I guess if you're not feeling it
anymore, then we're not feeling you.

1213
01:13:28,323 --> 01:13:32,634
You know what? Come on, girls.
We're through here.

1214
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,202
Oh, and Yasmin?

1215
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:35,738
Delete my number from
your cell phone, okay?

1216
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:38,365
Mine, too.

1217
01:13:38,436 --> 01:13:41,567
Yeah, sounds about right.

1218
01:14:33,733 --> 01:14:37,029
I tried to protect them,

1219
01:14:37,093 --> 01:14:39,165
but I lost them instead.

1220
01:14:39,237 --> 01:14:40,798
<i>Ah, cara mia.</i>

1221
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,757
They're your best friends.

1222
01:14:42,822 --> 01:14:44,894
Tell them the truth.

1223
01:14:44,966 --> 01:14:46,559
You don't know Meredith.

1224
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:49,499
Maybe you should let them decide.

1225
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:52,541
<i>Está bien, mi niña.</i>

1226
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:55,713
<i>Está bien, mi amor.</i>

1227
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:59,131
<i>Bubbie te quiere mucho.</i>

1228
01:15:14,854 --> 01:15:16,829
Okay.

1229
01:15:16,903 --> 01:15:19,324
Brown. Blue.

1230
01:15:21,254 --> 01:15:23,523
Blue. Brown.

1231
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,084
Why aren't you girls getting ready?

1232
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:26,336
Mom, we're not going.

1233
01:15:26,406 --> 01:15:28,675
Not going? Why?

1234
01:15:28,742 --> 01:15:30,685
Yasmin bailed on us.

1235
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:31,904
Yasmin?

1236
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:33,633
She just quit the show.

1237
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:35,613
We thought our friendship was
more important than anything.

1238
01:15:35,687 --> 01:15:38,076
I mean, after everything
we've been through.

1239
01:15:38,151 --> 01:15:41,053
We put it all on the line.
I can't believe it.

1240
01:15:41,127 --> 01:15:42,621
Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

1241
01:15:42,695 --> 01:15:45,346
Maybe something's wrong with her.

1242
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:51,555
You girls have been friends forever.

1243
01:15:51,623 --> 01:15:53,990
Don't you think that you
at least owe it to Yasmin

1244
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:56,543
to look a little bit deeper?

1245
01:15:56,616 --> 01:15:58,306
Find out why she did what she did?

1246
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,073
Sasha, I have something
to tell you guys.

1247
01:16:19,144 --> 01:16:21,184
- Like, face to face.
- Okay.

1248
01:16:21,256 --> 01:16:22,466
Look out your window.

1249
01:16:40,873 --> 01:16:43,393
Ladies and gentlemen,

1250
01:16:43,464 --> 01:16:47,109
welcome to a night of magic.

1251
01:16:49,512 --> 01:16:51,040
Before we begin,

1252
01:16:51,113 --> 01:16:54,112
I'd like to introduce you
to our illustrious celebrity judges

1253
01:16:54,184 --> 01:16:55,395
who will be voting for me.

1254
01:16:58,057 --> 01:16:59,584
I'm totally kidding.

1255
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:03,235
Ugh. I can't believe
Meredith would stoop so low.

1256
01:17:03,305 --> 01:17:04,417
Wait, did I just say that?

1257
01:17:04,488 --> 01:17:07,107
We should've known
you were just protecting us.

1258
01:17:07,177 --> 01:17:08,224
I didn't tell you.

1259
01:17:08,297 --> 01:17:10,152
Yeah, but we should've known anyway.

1260
01:17:10,218 --> 01:17:13,446
Yas, we want to do
the talent show with you.

1261
01:17:13,513 --> 01:17:16,001
But, guys, remember Meredith?

1262
01:17:16,073 --> 01:17:17,186
Whatever.

1263
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,948
If we let Meredith scare us
into quitting the show,

1264
01:17:19,017 --> 01:17:20,392
then it's all over.

1265
01:17:20,457 --> 01:17:22,464
She's gonna make our lives
miserable for the rest of the year.

1266
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:24,392
Yeah, and it doesn't matter if we win.

1267
01:17:24,457 --> 01:17:25,832
We gotta stand up for ourselves.

1268
01:17:25,898 --> 01:17:27,108
Show some attitude.

1269
01:17:27,177 --> 01:17:28,639
So let me get this straight.

1270
01:17:28,713 --> 01:17:31,234
You guys want to
stand up on stage,

1271
01:17:31,306 --> 01:17:32,615
in front of the whole school

1272
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,142
and risk everyone laughing at us

1273
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:36,673
and thinking we're losers
until we graduate?

1274
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:41,447
Exercise?
Yeah, I get enough exercise.

1275
01:17:41,514 --> 01:17:44,416
Just pushing my luck.
Ba-dum-cha!

1276
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:50,601
Anyway, what do termites
eat for breakfast?

1277
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,797
Oak-meal. Get it?

1278
01:17:53,866 --> 01:17:56,233
Oak-meal?

1279
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,634
That was just hilarious.

1280
01:18:06,698 --> 01:18:09,032
Really. Really wonderful.

1281
01:18:09,098 --> 01:18:10,757
- Thank you, guys.
- It's hilarious.

1282
01:18:10,826 --> 01:18:13,281
Stiff competition.

1283
01:18:13,354 --> 01:18:15,875
Our next act is simply amazing.

1284
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:45,092
Ladies and gentlemen,
live from Carry Nation High,

1285
01:18:45,164 --> 01:18:48,163
Meredith and the Meredettes.

1286
01:18:59,915 --> 01:19:01,323
# You know it's all about me #

1287
01:19:02,731 --> 01:19:05,601
# You know it's all about me #

1288
01:19:05,676 --> 01:19:08,425
# You know it's all about me #

1289
01:19:08,491 --> 01:19:11,841
# You know it's all about me #

1290
01:19:32,748 --> 01:19:35,716
# Don't hate me 'cause I got it goin' on #

1291
01:19:35,789 --> 01:19:38,919
# It's just me, I'm hot, never cold #

1292
01:19:38,989 --> 01:19:41,771
# I can rock it any way that I choose #

1293
01:19:41,836 --> 01:19:44,683
# I'm so good, oh, yeah,
I make up all the rules #

1294
01:19:44,748 --> 01:19:47,978
# I can't help it if I set all the trends #

1295
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:50,183
# Everybody wants
to be my best friend #

1296
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:53,515
# It's infectious, come on,
don't you be jealous #

1297
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:54,693
# Just join in this love fest #

1298
01:19:54,764 --> 01:19:58,343
# You know that it's all about me #

1299
01:19:58,413 --> 01:20:01,031
# It's all about me #

1300
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:04,167
# Oh, yeah, me, myself, and I #

1301
01:20:04,237 --> 01:20:06,026
# It's all about me #

1302
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:11,237
# Ma-ma-ma MySpace,
I have 10 million friends #

1303
01:20:11,309 --> 01:20:13,927
# Text me, BFF till the end #

1304
01:20:13,997 --> 01:20:16,715
# Page me on your cell
and press "send" #

1305
01:20:16,782 --> 01:20:18,821
# Diva what? Diva who?
Diva where? #

1306
01:20:18,893 --> 01:20:20,454
# That's me #

1307
01:20:20,526 --> 01:20:23,111
# Download all my crazy new hooks #

1308
01:20:23,181 --> 01:20:26,084
# Upload all my video looks #

1309
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:28,841
# So buy my ringtone,
fashion line, and cook books #

1310
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:30,437
# Diva what? Diva who?
Diva where? #

1311
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,673
# It's all about me #

1312
01:20:33,741 --> 01:20:36,393
# It's all about me,
me, me, me, me #

1313
01:20:36,462 --> 01:20:40,040
# Everybody knows it's I #

1314
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,965
# It's all about me #

1315
01:20:43,534 --> 01:20:44,581
# Don't blame her #

1316
01:20:44,653 --> 01:20:46,825
# I'm so beautiful #

1317
01:20:46,894 --> 01:20:49,163
- # Not her fault #
- # I'm platinum and gold #

1318
01:20:49,229 --> 01:20:50,572
# She's the queen #

1319
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,100
# And my reign is supreme #

1320
01:20:52,174 --> 01:20:55,491
# So follow the leader,
you're all on my team #

1321
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:58,283
# I can't help it
if I set all the trends #

1322
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:01,482
# Everybody wants
to be my best friend #

1323
01:21:01,551 --> 01:21:04,006
# It's contagious,
and it's so outrageous #

1324
01:21:04,078 --> 01:21:07,308
# Grandparents, grownups,
and kids of all ages #

1325
01:21:07,374 --> 01:21:10,342
# You know Madonna
ain't got nothing on me #

1326
01:21:10,415 --> 01:21:12,716
# Bu-bu-Beyoncé
ain't got nothing on me #

1327
01:21:12,782 --> 01:21:15,717
# Cha-cha-Christina
ain't got nothing on me #

1328
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:17,765
# Diva what? Diva who?
Diva where? #

1329
01:21:17,838 --> 01:21:18,885
# That's me #

1330
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,453
# You know it's all about me #

1331
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:21,639
# I'm a specialty #

1332
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:23,402
# You know it's all about me #

1333
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:24,616
# I'm an anomaly #

1334
01:21:24,687 --> 01:21:26,182
# You know it's all about me #

1335
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:27,433
# Who else could it be? #

1336
01:21:27,503 --> 01:21:29,412
# Upload, download,
text me, page me #

1337
01:21:29,487 --> 01:21:30,829
# MySpace, YouTube,
don't erase me #

1338
01:21:30,895 --> 01:21:32,269
# Indoor, outdoor,
I'm so clever #

1339
01:21:32,335 --> 01:21:33,512
# That's why I will rule forever #

1340
01:21:33,583 --> 01:21:34,695
# Me #

1341
01:21:40,015 --> 01:21:41,292
Get off my stage. Go!

1342
01:21:43,375 --> 01:21:44,553
Wasn't that awesome?

1343
01:21:46,352 --> 01:21:48,685
Ladies and gentlemen,
without further ado,

1344
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:50,442
let's see who you have chosen

1345
01:21:50,512 --> 01:21:51,886
as this year's
most talented student

1346
01:21:51,951 --> 01:21:53,544
at Carry Nation High.

1347
01:21:53,615 --> 01:21:55,438
Judges, the envelope, please.

1348
01:21:55,504 --> 01:21:56,911
Wait a minute.

1349
01:21:56,976 --> 01:21:58,502
There's still one more act.

1350
01:21:58,575 --> 01:22:00,463
No, the show is over,

1351
01:22:00,528 --> 01:22:01,476
with a capital over.

1352
01:22:01,552 --> 01:22:03,013
Hey, listen, the girls signed up,

1353
01:22:03,088 --> 01:22:04,845
they deserve the right to perform.

1354
01:22:04,913 --> 01:22:06,920
- He's right.
- Oh, please.

1355
01:22:06,991 --> 01:22:08,617
I know the rules, but thanks anyway.

1356
01:22:08,688 --> 01:22:10,663
Hey, those are my parents
you're talking to.

1357
01:22:10,736 --> 01:22:12,874
You will not disrespect them like that.

1358
01:22:12,944 --> 01:22:14,318
Have you considered anger management?

1359
01:22:14,383 --> 01:22:16,751
Oh, Meredith. Bag it.

1360
01:22:16,816 --> 01:22:19,271
- Introduce us, Cloe.
- Wait!

1361
01:22:19,344 --> 01:22:22,246
Are you sure you want to do
this to your friends, Yasmin?

1362
01:22:27,216 --> 01:22:29,354
Well, then, it is my responsibility,

1363
01:22:29,423 --> 01:22:30,602
as your student body president,

1364
01:22:30,673 --> 01:22:33,487
to let you know
who these brats really are.

1365
01:22:42,768 --> 01:22:45,998
Exhibit A, the fashionista.

1366
01:22:46,065 --> 01:22:47,853
I say Imposturista.

1367
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,216
She lies to her parents,
to her teachers,

1368
01:22:51,281 --> 01:22:52,710
and to you.

1369
01:22:52,785 --> 01:22:55,120
This is who you think she is.

1370
01:22:55,186 --> 01:22:58,120
This is who she really is.

1371
01:22:59,184 --> 01:23:02,054
Here's the dealio.

1372
01:23:02,129 --> 01:23:04,517
I'm not either of those girls
Meredith showed you.

1373
01:23:04,592 --> 01:23:06,120
I'm both.

1374
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:09,259
I love science and math
and my parents,

1375
01:23:09,329 --> 01:23:10,988
a lot,

1376
01:23:11,057 --> 01:23:12,999
but I have a passion for fashion.

1377
01:23:13,074 --> 01:23:15,245
It's how I express who I am.

1378
01:23:15,313 --> 01:23:16,742
And if I can't do that,

1379
01:23:16,817 --> 01:23:17,929
I'm nobody.

1380
01:23:18,001 --> 01:23:20,369
I want everyone in my life
to accept that.

1381
01:23:20,434 --> 01:23:21,481
Sorry.

1382
01:23:21,554 --> 01:23:23,212
Pathetic, isn't it?

1383
01:23:23,282 --> 01:23:26,130
Well, nowhere as pathetic as this.

1384
01:23:26,194 --> 01:23:29,008
Exhibit B, the soccer jock.

1385
01:23:29,073 --> 01:23:31,594
All-American girl, the perfect daughter,

1386
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:32,713
you decide.

1387
01:23:32,785 --> 01:23:35,633
When her mother
desperately needed a job,

1388
01:23:35,698 --> 01:23:37,389
my family was kind enough

1389
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:41,036
to offer her employment as our maid.

1390
01:23:41,106 --> 01:23:43,245
And how did her daughter
repay this kindness?

1391
01:23:43,314 --> 01:23:48,529
By stealing my favorite, most beloved dolly.

1392
01:23:48,594 --> 01:23:51,726
Ow. Still hurts.

1393
01:23:51,794 --> 01:23:53,485
Look, it's true.

1394
01:23:53,554 --> 01:23:55,758
My mom did clean Meredith's house.

1395
01:23:55,826 --> 01:23:59,950
She would do anything
to provide for us.

1396
01:24:00,018 --> 01:24:01,741
My mom...

1397
01:24:04,274 --> 01:24:05,452
My mom is my hero.

1398
01:24:10,803 --> 01:24:12,591
But I never took your doll.

1399
01:24:12,658 --> 01:24:14,218
Actually, I did.

1400
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:16,080
You were using it as a doorstop.

1401
01:24:16,147 --> 01:24:18,154
I eavesdropped on my sister.

1402
01:24:18,226 --> 01:24:19,470
And then I betrayed her.

1403
01:24:19,538 --> 01:24:22,321
Yasmin, I'm very sorry.

1404
01:24:22,387 --> 01:24:24,559
Most of my friends
think I'm a tough jock,

1405
01:24:24,627 --> 01:24:27,725
but I've been taking ballet
since I was 5.

1406
01:24:27,795 --> 01:24:29,289
And you know what? I like it.

1407
01:24:30,324 --> 01:24:33,040
I cheated on my pop quiz

1408
01:24:33,107 --> 01:24:36,490
and my midterm, and my final.

1409
01:24:36,563 --> 01:24:37,970
I'm Bubbie,

1410
01:24:38,035 --> 01:24:39,759
and I am a chocoholic.

1411
01:24:39,828 --> 01:24:41,519
- Hi, Bubbie.
- Hi, Bubbie.

1412
01:24:42,867 --> 01:24:45,453
Meredith, this one's for you.

1413
01:24:52,115 --> 01:24:53,903
# We got that Bratitude #

1414
01:24:53,972 --> 01:24:55,499
# It's not that attitude #

1415
01:24:55,572 --> 01:24:57,677
# We got that Bratitude #

1416
01:24:57,748 --> 01:24:59,154
# Yeah, come on #

1417
01:25:00,148 --> 01:25:03,442
# There's a voice inside of me #

1418
01:25:03,508 --> 01:25:06,824
# Set it free, set it free, set it free #

1419
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:10,730
# And it lives way
down deep in my soul #

# They say my Bratitude
is just an attitude #

1426
01:25:29,589 --> 01:25:31,563
# Gonna take the latitude #

1427
01:25:31,636 --> 01:25:33,163
# To say that it's okay #

1428
01:25:33,237 --> 01:25:34,644

# Express yourself and you'll see #

1433
01:25:48,212 --> 01:25:50,963
# Set it free, set it free,
set it free #

1434
01:25:51,029 --> 01:25:55,022

# Bratitude #

1447
01:26:25,398 --> 01:26:27,732
# You know my Bratitude
is not an attitude #

1448
01:26:27,798 --> 01:26:31,792
# Gotta take the latitude
to say that it's okay #

1449
01:26:31,862 --> 01:26:35,310
# It's not a platitude
to feel some gratitude #

1450
01:26:35,383 --> 01:26:38,252
# So show your Bratitude
in each and every way #

1451

01:26:48,981 --> 01:26:52,364
# That's what we call #

1454
01:26:52,438 --> 01:26:56,399
# Bratitude #

1455
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:59,537
# There ain't no difference
who you are #

1456
01:26:59,607 --> 01:27:03,021
# No ifs, no buts, no maybes #

1457
01:27:03,094 --> 01:27:06,029

# B-rat tat tat tat #

1460
01:27:12,278 --> 01:27:16,021
# The Bratz got your back #

1461
01:27:16,087 --> 01:27:17,974
# So get up on your feet #

1462
01:27:18,038 --> 01:27:19,762
# Let's take it to the street #

1463
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:23,126
# To everyone you'll meet today #

1464
01:27:24,888 --> 01:27:26,513
# We got it #

1465
01:27:26,583 --> 01:27:28,852
# We'll share it, we'll show it #

1466
01:27:28,919 --> 01:27:31,374
# Want the whole world
to know it #

1467
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:33,356

# It's not a platitude
to feel some gratitude #

1473
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,960
You go on that stage, and
I am never speaking to you again.

1474
01:27:51,031 --> 01:27:52,241
You know what?

1475
01:27:52,311 --> 01:27:54,287
That's the best offer
I've heard all day.

1476
01:27:54,361 --> 01:27:58,997
# There's a voice deep inside of me #

1477
01:27:59,063 --> 01:28:02,478
# Set it free, set it free, set it free #

1478

# That is why we got Bratitude #

1490
01:28:29,016 --> 01:28:32,562
# We can fly with our Bratitude #

1491

1492
01:28:35,961 --> 01:28:39,605

Oh, that was so good!

Yes!

1501
01:29:19,962 --> 01:29:21,936
Yeah!

1502
01:29:30,682 --> 01:29:34,294
You were all absolutely wonderful.

1503
01:29:34,362 --> 01:29:36,336
And the winner is...

1504
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:39,600
It's a tie.

1505
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:41,872
It's a tie.

1506
01:29:41,946 --> 01:29:44,281
Well, we... That's a first.

1507
01:29:44,347 --> 01:29:46,452
So I guess we just...
We'II, uh...

1508
01:29:46,523 --> 01:29:49,206
I'd like to present
the Golden Hatchet

1509
01:29:49,275 --> 01:29:51,991
to Meredith Baxter Dimly.

1510
01:29:52,058 --> 01:29:53,913
I really didn't see this coming.

1511
01:29:53,978 --> 01:29:57,110
I won, I won, I won, I won!

1512
01:29:57,179 --> 01:29:59,448
Look, everyone. I won.

1513
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:02,228
- Thank you.

1514
01:30:02,299 --> 01:30:07,034
Now, the scholarship
goes to the Bratz!

1515
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:26,486
Meredith. Tom McShavie,
Vice President, MTV Networks.

1516
01:30:26,555 --> 01:30:28,529
- Great show.
- Thank you.

1517
01:30:28,603 --> 01:30:30,709
I caught your MTV
My Super Sweet 16,

1518
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:32,852
and it's got the best numbers to date.

1519
01:30:32,923 --> 01:30:34,931
You in the pool. Outrageous.

1520
01:30:35,003 --> 01:30:36,465
My idea.

1521
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,132
Smart girl.

1522
01:30:38,203 --> 01:30:40,113
Oh, but you four girls, whoa.

1523
01:30:40,188 --> 01:30:43,635
You have got superstar
written all over you.

1524
01:30:43,707 --> 01:30:44,602
- We do?
- They do?

1525
01:30:44,668 --> 01:30:45,912
Without question.

1526
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:49,177
We're having a movie premiere
next Saturday night.

1527
01:30:49,244 --> 01:30:52,277
How would you girls like to be
the featured act on the red carpet?

1528
01:30:52,348 --> 01:30:54,770
Two words. Uh, duh!

1529
01:30:54,845 --> 01:30:56,306
Fantastic.

1530
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:58,289
- We'll be in touch.
- Oh, no way.

1531
01:30:58,364 --> 01:31:01,048
Oh, my God, the red carpet!

1532
01:31:01,116 --> 01:31:02,425
Oh, my God, the scholarship!

we want to give to you, Cloe.

1535
01:31:07,804 --> 01:31:10,804
You're going to college,
no ifs, ands, or buts.

1536
01:31:10,876 --> 01:31:12,120
For real?

1537
01:31:12,188 --> 01:31:15,254
Oh, I love you guys!

1538
01:31:15,324 --> 01:31:18,619
We are truly best friends forever.

1539
01:31:23,293 --> 01:31:26,457
BFFs!

1540
01:31:26,525 --> 01:31:28,728
Even better.

1541
01:31:28,797 --> 01:31:30,739
Bratz!

1543
01:31:55,472 --> 01:31:57,413
I totally would've won
that scholarship.

1544
01:31:57,487 --> 01:31:59,659
Well, dear, there's
always the next time.

1545
01:32:09,489 --> 01:32:11,398
No, there is not a next time.

1546
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:12,520
I'm graduating.

1547
01:32:12,592 --> 01:32:14,698
Oh, yes.

1548
01:32:14,768 --> 01:32:17,582
Congratulations, dear.

1549
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,048
