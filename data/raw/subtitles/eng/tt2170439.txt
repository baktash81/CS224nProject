1
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,185
¶ Well, I'm running,
police on my back ¶

2
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,389
¶ I've been hiding,
police on my back ¶

3
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:26,625
¶ there was a shooting,
police on my back ¶

4
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,828
¶ and the victim,
well, he won't come back ¶

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,832
¶ I've been running Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday ¶

6
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,036
¶ Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday ¶

7
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:40,239
¶ running Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday ¶

8
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,875
¶ Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday ¶

9
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,077
Hey, hey, hey! If you're
coming in for the morning grind,

10
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,313
it's another brutal Monday
out there traffic-wise.

11
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,315
The 2 is slow-and-go to the 5.

12
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,317
A sig alert
is bogging down the I-10.

13
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,520
And if you're
on the 405 freeway,

14
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,355
you're probably already
late for work.

15
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:58,190
Now, if your boss gives you
a hard time about it,

16
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,826
you have him come down here
and talk to... Rachel.

17
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,227
Oh, no.

18
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,230
Zing!
Thanks, skip.

19
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,666
But, hey, speaking of bosses,
after the break,

20
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,368
we get to meet
three guys

21
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,771
who are chasing their dream
of becoming their own bosses.

22
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,006
Stay with us.

23
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:16,008
And... We're out.

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,210
Very good, guys.
We're back in 90 seconds.

25
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,445
Okay, we're out.
Back in 90.
Could've work a jacket,
I guess,

26
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:21,447
but I think casual's
probably better.

27
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:23,449
Jesus Christ. Dale,
you got to stop sweating, pal.

28
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:24,783
Hey. Hey.
Oh, wow. You are wet.

29
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,685
"Stop sweating."
How do I stop sweating?

30
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,053
I mean, guys,
this is a big deal.

31
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,254
I mean, we got everything
riding on this,

32
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,622
all right?
We've quit our jobs.

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,591
I have three children
to think about now.

34
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,859
How about that, all right?
Okay, well,
think about this, okay?

35
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,294
You do a good job
right now,

36
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,129
you're gonna make
your little boys very proud.

37
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,031
Girls.
I have three girls, dude.
Hmm?

38
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,633
Oh, right. Well, I mean,
so what? You can't even
tell at that age.

39
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,769
They basically look like
potatoes with arms.
don't call
my kids potatoes, okay?

40
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,637
He's really freaking out.
I feel like you guys
should go on without me.

41
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,473
Can you guys
go on without me?
Well, I'm glad you said it.

42
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,374
Why don't you wait in the car,
buddy? That's a lot of sweat.

43
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,642
Oh, come on, calm down, okay?
You're making him more nervous.

44
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,544
Look, Dale, it's gonna be
real easy, okay?

45
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,746
You just got to talk about
you and Stacy having triplets.

46
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,449
- People eat that shit up.
- You are the heart.

47
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,151
All we have to do
is be ourselves.

48
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:00,786
Oh, let's not be ourselves.
Ourselves is a dumpster fire.

49
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,054
Let's be
<i>better</i> than ourselves.

50
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,722
Let's try to elevate
a little bit.

51
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,657
That's a good note.
Nobody be themselves. Good tip.

52
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,126
And we're back in 5, 4...

53
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,129
¶ It's time to get up,
get up, get up ¶

54
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,764
¶ and get out, good morning ¶

55
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,566
And we're back.

56
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,969
You know, every week,
we like to highlight

57
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,604
local inventors
and entrepreneurs

58
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,405
in our
big idea spotlight.

59
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:24,409
That's right, Mike, and today,
we have three modern-day Edisons

60
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,011
who've created
a new shower gadget

61
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,247
they hope
to really<i> clean up</i> with.

62
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,852
Please... Welcome
Nick, Kurt, and Dale.

63
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,455
Pleasure to be here.
Now, um, before we get
into the product,

64
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,658
can you tell us what is it
that inspired three regular Joes

65
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,793
to go into business
for yourselves?

66
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,328
Yeah, well, we were...
we were all working

67
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,963
at pretty terrible jobs
for some awful bosses.

68
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,765
And we just thought,
well, if we ever got a chance

69
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,967
to be our own bosses
that we'd do things differently.

70
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,469
And this might be our shot.
Yeah. Yeah.

71
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,037
Yeah, so, we didn't think
we'd ever get the chance,

72
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,472
but then our buddy Dale here
had an amazing idea.

73
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,207
Don't go to Dale.
Uh, yeah.

74
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,042
And, uh, you know, we just
started, uh, meeting together

75
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,477
to talk
about the invention

76
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,012
instead of complaining
about our jobs.

77
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,347
Hey, I think that's exciting.

78
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,349
Well done.
Dale, you know,
I just want to know,

79
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,984
where did
the idea come from

80
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,654
for a new shower... Head?
I have<i> three</i> kids!

81
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,023
Uh,
let me answer the question.

82
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,658
Um, Dale, uh,
had just gotten back

83
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,992
from one of those
self-service car washes, right,

84
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,494
with the wand
with the soap and the wax?

85
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,296
Oh, yeah, it's got everything
in the one thing.

86
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,864
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, okay. Yeah.
He simply thought,

87
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,332
"why don't they make
one of these for your body?"

88
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,967
Yeah. Yeah,
and after we had a few beers,

89
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,502
we came up with the,
uh, shower buddy.

90
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,803
The "shower buddy"?

91
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,205
I-I'm sorry.
That name's not official yet.

92
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,639
No, he's wrong.
It is official.

93
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,374
I wanted
"the shower daddy."

94
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,810
"Shower daddy" is worse on
pretty much every level, so...

95
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,178
Yeah.
I have to agree with Nick.

96
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,180
It's better than having
some strange dude

97
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,815
in the shower with you.
It's<i> not</i> some strange dude,
Dale,

98
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,750
as I've said many, many times.
It's your buddy!

99
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,986
Well, why would your buddy
be in the shower with you?!

100
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,387
Why would your dad?!
Uh-oh!

101
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,223
Don't scream
on television.

102
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,991
Well, you know what?
How about you fellas

103
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,526
show us how
this little gizmo works?

104
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,927
Right?
Let's get it going.

105
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,663
Yes. Make it rain.
Yes! work it, work it.

106
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,065
Oh, this is awesome!

107
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,499
So, Kurt's gonna go ahead
and get in there,

108
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,734
and he's gonna
turn on the shower.

109
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,603
You're gonna see
the water come out.

110
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:00,038
After a little bit of time, the
shampoo's gonna automatically

111
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,607
be triggered out
of the showerhead,
mix with the water...

112
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:02,841
no water.
No water pressure.
Use the blue handle.

113
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,576
No, there's no water
pressure.

114
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,877
You know what,
there's a pump on the back.

115
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,212
I could
pump it up manually.
Great.

116
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,280
Dale's gonna help out.
Thank you, buddy.

117
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,548
Dale's gonna do it.
Okay.

118
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,117
Pump... I got it.
You got it? You do?

119
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,685
The water comes out,
and the shampoo

120
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,420
then automatically mixes
with the water.

121
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,422
Then shortly thereafter that,
conditioner then comes in.

122
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,625
And then you shower in half
the time with the shower buddy.

123
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,260
Effectively, yeah.
The average American...

124
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,527
I don't know
if you guys know this...

125
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,929
spends about 50 hours a week
working.

126
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,764
Hand's cramping up.

127
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,432
Here, let me help.

128
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,102
...commuting, and if we can save
you just 5 minutes every...

129
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,536
There's not enough lube.
The whole rod's too dry,
right?

130
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:32,871
Yeah, spit on it.
Spit on it.

131
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,540
There it is? Better?
See, yeah.

132
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,975
If you lube it up,
it's... it's better.

133
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,443
Oh, no, absolutely.
We... we are, uh...

134
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,811
Oh, look, guys.
I'm so sorry.

135
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:40,979
There's just
a little hole in the back.

136
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,381
I'm gonna
stick my finger in it,

137
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,615
plug it up,
and then we're good to go.

138
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,916
Just get it done, right?

139
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,586
Whatever it takes.
Live TV, right?

140
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,488
Live TV! You know,
what are you gonna do?

141
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,323
Yeah! Here we go!
Oh, here it comes!

142
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,658
It's a miracle!

143
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,126
Worked just
as promised, okay?

144
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,161
Now, uh, go ahead
and shut it off there, Kurt.

145
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,996
It's so cool. I want one.
Yeah.

146
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,431
You want...
you can't have this one.

147
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,133
It's the only one.
It's the prototype.

148
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,068
But we're looking for partners
to bring it to markets.

149
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,003
Well, you know what,
I'll tell you right now.
I'm sold. I want invest.

150
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,672
We got one!
All right, Mike.

151
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,141
Now, how would I... how would I
get in touch with you guys?

152
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,509
You go straight to
Nick-hurt-Dale.

153
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,577
I'm sorry, what?

154
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,579
- Dot-com. It's our website...
- nickkurtdale. Com.

155
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,649
I'm positive
I'm not hearing that right.

156
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,851
It's our names...
Nick, Kurt, Dale.

157
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,421
Nick-Kurt-Dale.

158
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,357
Y'all... y'all got to
change that name.

159
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,328
Boy, cannot believe we never
said it out loud before.

160
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,496
It looked so good
on paper.

161
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,131
Well, it was a nice dream
while it lasted,

162
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,867
but I think it's time
we all go beg for our jobs back.

163
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,602
Maybe just accept the fact
that we'll always be

164
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,338
cogs in the machine,
you know?

165
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,873
Wait. "Cocks in the machine"...
what is that?

166
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,442
"Cogs." "Guh."

167
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,044
You know what? You're right.
We're not...

168
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,045
we're not boss material.
We're... we're worker bees.

169
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,314
We're grunts.

170
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,316
Oh, boy. That song...
I can't hear that now.

171
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,684
Just put it on vibrate.

172
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,152
Will you stop?
Please?

173
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,287
Come on. I picked this song
to inspire us.

174
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,822
It's not inspiring me.

175
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,523
Ooh, look at this.
Unknown caller.

176
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,958
Can you just answer it?
Hello?

177
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,727
Yep, this is one of
the shower buddy guys.

178
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,196
Mm-hmm. Really?

179
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,398
Yes. No, of course.
I know exactly who you are.

180
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,200
Look up "Boulder stream."
"Boulder stream."

181
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,068
Uh-huh.
Well, thank you.

182
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,670
No, we're very proud
of the product.

183
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,472
Yeah, if you just want to
e-mail us the details,

184
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:14,740
that'll be fine.
Is that a real thing?

185
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,508
Yeah, my e-mail?
Not yours.

186
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,378
Yeah, it's
phatballllz@hotmail.Com.

187
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,815
It's p-h-a-t
b-a-l-l...

188
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,550
l-l...

189
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,918
Z.

190
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,354
@hotmail.Com. Yeah.
All right. Thank you.

191
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,555
Yeah. No.
See you tomorrow.

192
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,990
Wow.
Holy shit.

193
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,925
Boulder stream
loves the shower buddy.

194
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,594
Who the fuck
is Boulder stream?

195
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,596
Only one of the largest
catalogue retailers

196
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,164
in north America.

197
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,668
¶<i> You're gonna hear me roar</i> ¶

198
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,203
Nice.

199
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,506
See, when you're in a good mood,
it's a good song.

200
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,975
Bad mood, bad song.
And that's art. That's good art.

201
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,012
Man, this place is legit!

202
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,580
Yeah, it's nice.

203
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,249
Did you see
the free cookies?
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

204
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,851
Yeah, you clearly have.
That's, like, four of those.

205
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,753
You're gonna have chocolate
all over your face.
Oh, hey.

206
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,722
You know,
you're gonna look like a kid.
Hey, really quick, guys.

207
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:04,956
When we meet this guy,
when you shake his hand,

208
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,391
use your other hand
and touch his elbow.

209
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,759
It's a classy move.
I don't know this move.

210
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,528
Just give him a nice,
firm handshake.

211
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,962
Mm, that's nice!
How about that?

212
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,364
That's real nice!
It's really good, yeah.

213
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,065
Let me get ya here.
No, no.

214
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,802
You got chocolate on your
fingers. Now it's on my jacket.

215
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,103
I got ya.
You put your crumbs on my leg.
Put a little water on it.

216
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,805
I don't need water.
That will set it.

217
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,240
Get the cookie away from me,
please, Dale.

218
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,442
No, it's like
a fire-on-fire thing.

219
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,310
No,
the water will set it.

220
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,112
Ha! There they are!

221
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,548
There are my shower buddies.
How are you? In the flesh.

222
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,916
It's just like
on that morning show.

223
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,250
You're always fighting.
I love it.

224
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,318
Oh.
Yeah, it's...

225
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,586
Rex hanson.
Oh, hey.

226
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,221
Kurt buckman, man.
Good to see ya, Kurt.

227
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,756
Nice to see you, too.
Well, that's a classy handshake.

228
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,558
- Nick, pleasure.
- Yeah, yeah. Hey.

229
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,460
Dale arb... uh, shoot.
I just learned it.

230
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,495
We can do it
whichever way you want, buddy.

231
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,931
Right?

232
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,066
Guys, why don't we grab
the refreshments, the coffee,

233
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,135
grab some cookies if you want.
Let's head upstairs

234
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,337
and talk about this product,
all right? Is that corduroy?

235
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,339
Step inside.

236
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,741
- Dreams do come true.
- Wow, wow.

237
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,342
You guys good?
You want something to drink?

238
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,110
- Yeah, I'll have one, yeah.
- Sure!

239
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,112
No, no. It's very early.
No. Never mind.

240
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,448
No? No for us. Sorry.
I'm gonna cut right to it,
gentlemen.

241
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,951
The shower buddy...
a home run.

242
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,953
Well, Mr. hanson, we...
we couldn't be happier...

243
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,957
Mr. hanson is my father.
It's Rex.

244
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,160
Please, sit down.
Get comfortable. Take a seat.
Great. Okay. Thank you.

245
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,095
Uh, we want you to know that...
that we are a company

246
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,763
you can be very proud
to be in business with.

247
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,198
You know, our workers are all
gonna have healthcare.

248
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,833
They're gonna be
profit-sharing.

249
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,468
Yeah, okay, I don't really
give a shit about that.

250
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,471
Do you see this? This is
Jimi Hendrix's actual guitar.

251
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,640
Yeah! The one he did the fire
and the fingers thing with.

252
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,709
You guys like
cool shit like this?

253
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,677
Oh, yeah, yeah,
we love cool shit.
Oh, yeah. I'm into cool shit.

254
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,813
I knew ya did!
You get into business with me,

255
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,681
you're gonna have
fucking loads of it!

256
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,850
And, so, you are offering
to carry our product,

257
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,119
- not only as a...
- wait a minute. Check this out.

258
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,455
Miss lang, will you come in here
a moment, please?

259
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,956
Now what?

260
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,859
Jesus fucking Christ.

261
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,628
Sweetheart,
we were racking our brains.

262
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,664
What... what's a beer can
made out of?

263
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,266
Do you mean aluminium?

264
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,802
That'll be all, miss lang.
Thank you.
Okay.

265
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,207
And where does she go now?

266
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,542
Now,<i> that</i> is the kind
of cool shit

267
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,976
you have to look forward to.

268
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,878
Look, the best part
about this whole deal...

269
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,813
you're not even gonna have to
lift a finger.

270
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,082
My company will assume
all future product development,

271
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,517
outsource manufacturing
to China,

272
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,919
and you gents will receive

273
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,687
a handsome one-time
development fee.

274
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,056
I want to dig in on the one-time
fee thing, because, you know...

275
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,591
you see this football?

276
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,359
This is the one
where Peyton Manning threw it

277
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,261
and the guy caught it in the
back of his helmet. Keep it.

278
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,897
Oh.
You know, uh, Rex,
the... the one-time fee thing...

279
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,899
we're not looking to give up
control of the company.

280
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,101
In fact...
right. No, we want to handle
all the manufacturing,

281
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,870
and you guys
do distribution.

282
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,606
What... you manufacture?
Here, in America?

283
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,008
That's the plan.
Yeah, we're trying to do
the whole American-dream thing.

284
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,677
Boys, I hate
to break it to you,

285
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,745
but the American dream,
it's made in China.

286
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,381
Now, look,
I respect your naiveté,

287
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,751
uh, but I'm afraid that this
deal only happens one way.

288
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,621
I did say
"handsome" fee, right?

289
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,890
Can I have one minute? Just love
to talk to my partners.

290
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,759
You got it. Take your time.
I'll be over here.

291
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,431
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
What do you guys think?

292
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,199
I didn't
want to say anything,

293
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,234
but I think he means<i> Eli</i> Manning
and not Peyton Manning.

294
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,904
You know?
Yeah. Maybe.
Maybe... Kurt.

295
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,739
I think she has she has
an amazing fucking body,

296
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,574
but that accent puts her over
the top. I mean, it's insane.

297
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:12,711
Right. Agreed on both points.
How about the deal?

298
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,412
The deal, yeah, it's sweet, man.
We got to take it.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We should take it.

299
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,047
We should take the money
and get the hell out of here.

300
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,482
Cool shit.
He's got cool shit everywhere.
Yeah.

301
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,917
Can you imagine
having your own cool shit?

302
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,619
But...
but look at this place.

303
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,254
I mean, these guys make
loads of money selling stuff,

304
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,657
and he just called
our shower buddy a home run.

305
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,493
I don't know why we'd sell
a home run for a one-time fee.

306
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,662
That's a good point.
I don't know. I mean,

307
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,497
I could really use the money
for Stacy and the girls.

308
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,899
That's a good point. Yeah,
that's true. I could use money.

309
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:38,103
Yeah, I-I get that. But maybe
it's not just about the money.
That's a good point.

310
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:42,107
Maybe it's about never having
to work for anybody ever again,

311
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,109
that's right.
Right? Being our own bosses.

312
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,311
I say we bet on ourselves.
Me, too.

313
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,512
You're right.
I'm in.

314
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,913
I'm in. Let's do it.

315
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,649
Okay. Rex.

316
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,484
- Yeah.
- Uh, no deal.

317
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,519
Sorry.
Yeah, we're, uh...
we're betting on ourselves.

318
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,955
Is that right?
Yeah, and no hard feelings.

319
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,957
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.
Honestly,
we really appreciate the offer.

320
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,594
Sorry.
Yeah. I can respect that.

321
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,530
Takes some serious balls to walk
away from three million bucks.

322
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,966
What did he say?
What did he say?
Hang on. Three million dollars?
We'll take that.

323
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,801
Sorry.
Offer's off the table.

324
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,003
We'll take half! Half is fine!
Can we have half?!
Well...

325
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,005
Ship's sailed.
Thank you so much for coming in.

326
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,840
Dale, I'm gonna need
that ball back.

327
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,043
Good luck
building something in America.

328
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,845
You know...

329
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:25,483
I built this company from
the bottom up here in America.

330
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,485
Dad, I-I didn't know
you were back. How was
your... how was your trip?

331
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,721
What'd I tell you about
using my office while I'm away?

332
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,556
I know. I just...
I just thought...

333
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,726
Bert hanson.
You're the shower buddy guys?

334
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,461
Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah.
We are, sir.

335
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,796
I respect you gentlemen

336
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,198
for wanting
to roll up your sleeves

337
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,201
and build something,
stake your claim.

338
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,404
Now, I came to this country
with nothing.

339
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,741
And through risk
and hard work,

340
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,576
I made my own American dream
come true.

341
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,746
Mm.
Good for you.

342
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,182
Well, here's what
I'm gonna do.

343
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,885
I'll refer you to my contact
at pacific shore national.

344
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,888
That's a bank.
They won't balk
at giving you a start-up loan

345
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,091
once they hear
that Bert hanson just has placed

346
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:09,894
an initial order of,
say, um...

347
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,732
...100,000 units?

348
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,367
100,000 shower buddies?
Wha...

349
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,770
You're gonna make
100,000 shower buddies?!

350
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,406
Dad, what are you talking about?
We never make this kind of deal.

351
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,877
Sorry, sir.

352
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,447
But Boulder stream needs to be
your exclusive retailer.

353
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,416
Um, well,
let's think it over.

354
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,051
Yes. No. We won't pick up
the phone if anyone calls!
No, of course.

355
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,352
We have a deal?

356
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,354
Yeah,
you got a fucking deal!

357
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,789
Hey, all right!
There it is.

358
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,357
I got his elbow!

359
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,226
Oh, I got some chocolate
on you there.

360
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,894
It doesn't matter.

361
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,596
That's great.

362
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,930
That is good news!

363
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,699
So,
it's 20,000 square feet,

364
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,401
but it's a minimum
five-year lease.

365
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,204
20,000. That sounds like a whole
lot more than we need, you know?

366
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,273
But we want something
we can grow into, right?

367
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,041
And we have
a really big order, Nick.

368
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,043
Damn straight.
Come on, Nick.

369
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,612
Nick...
I-I don't know. I mean,

370
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,447
I say that, uh...
you know, I say we<i> take</i> it.

371
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,649
Yes. Yes, we do.

372
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,484
Excellent.
¶ return of the mack, get up ¶

387
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,620
You've got
no work experience at all.

388
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:43,955
Is that bad?

389
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,456
Are you kidding?
Nah, it's great.

390
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,458
You're enthusiastic,
and you're unjaded.

391
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,960
And unqualified.
You know what?

392
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,628
You're hired.
Oops.

393
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,030
Really?

394
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,599
That was unexpected
and, uh, u-undeserving.

395
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,811
You're hired.

396
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,046
<i>Sí?</i>

397
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,981
That's a yes.
That's an obvious yes.

398
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,316
<i>Ai, gracias!</i>

399
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,219
<i>Gracias!</i>

400
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,520
Well, again...

401
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,055
No résumé at all.
...You know, not much...

402
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,356
you don't need it.
Your eyes speak for yourself.

403
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,658
You seem honest.
Hold on, pal.

404
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,060
Um... You're hired.

405
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,328
Really?
Well...

406
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,996
I mean, if you'll have us.
Thank you.

407
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,065
Says here you've been convicted
of a felony.

408
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,399
That was bullshit.

409
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,034
Word up, though.
I get that, man.

410
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,803
Like I had...
I had a similar thing, you know,

411
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,705
they tried to peg me as,
like, a child sex offender.

412
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:34,906
It was total bullshit.

413
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,174
Oh, whoa, yo, yo.

414
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,876
I ain't down
with no kid fuckers.

415
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,344
I'm not down
with kid shit, either.

416
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,045
Yeah, none of us are.
Nobody agrees with that.

417
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,847
You know, man?
"N" to the "o," brother.

418
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,250
We do not support that
at all.

419
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,685
But, you know, let's just
give the guy a job.
Oh.

420
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,727
It's just... yeah, I-I don't
want to upset this guy.

421
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,489
Well, tell you what,
Tiffany.

422
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,324
You're hired!
I'm hired?

423
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,926
Yeah, you are!

424
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,561
There you go!
Oh, thank you!

425
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,763
Whoo-hoo-hoo! All right,
we'll see you later, okay?

426
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,932
See you Monday.
Get out of here, all right?

427
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,701
Kurt, you got to stop hiring
hot, unqualified women.
Come on.

428
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,004
What's the point of being
the boss if you can't
stock the pond a little?

429
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,706
You do realize you can't sleep
with these women, right?
What's he talking about?

430
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,909
He's talking
about you're the boss.
It's called sexual harassment.

431
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,111
Yeah,
remember sexual harassment?
I tried to kill my boss.

432
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:16,214
Ring a bell?
So what? I got to fire them
all now? We just hired them.

433
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,216
Oh, you can't fire them.
No, you can't fire them
just because you're not allowed

434
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,685
to sleep with them.
That's<i> also</i> sexual harassment.

435
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:24,022
Why are we even doing this,
then?!

436
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,627
¶ Can we go back,
this is the moment ¶

437
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,630
¶ tonight is the night,
we'll fight till it's over ¶

438
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,633
¶ so we put our hands up
like the ceiling can't hold us ¶

439
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,635
oh, boy. This is it.

440
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,771
Here we go. Here we go.
¶ like the ceiling
can't hold us ¶

441
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,774
¶ can we go back,
this is the moment ¶

442
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,777

443
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,782
¶ so we put our hands up

444
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:54,419
¶ like the ceiling

445
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,054
we did it.
We're at 100,000.

446
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,889
We did it?
Yeah.

447
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,851
Let me see. Ohh.
¶ like the ceiling
can't hold us ¶

448
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,560
This is a great idea!

449
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,395
How do you think
they mow this thing?

450
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,297
Hey, are you guys sure
we shouldn't have called ahead?

451
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,665
No! He's gonna love it.
But the cake
and the balloons...

452
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,334
you don't think
that's overdoing it, huh?

453
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,169
I don't think so. No.
I think he's gonna be psyched

454
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,004
that the order's done
three days early.

455
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,439
That's true.
I think he's gonna be,
like, flipping out

456
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,840
to see us
out on his course.

457
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,241
Hey, you know what?
I wouldn't be surprised

458
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,943
if he gives us a membership
to this place.

459
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,144
Are you serious?!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,546
Oh, my god.
I want that!

461
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,817
Ohh!
Hey.

462
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,251
- Surprise!
Whoo-hoo!

463
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,953
Sir, we have finished your order
in full,

464
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,288
and it is ready
to be shipped.

465
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,290
Excellent news.

466
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,858
And we got you a little cake
that says,

467
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,593
"thanks for believing
in us!"

468
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,996
And some balloons,
of course.
We're the "us."

469
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,631
Congratulations, boys.
What an accomplishment.

470
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,333
Thank you.
Thanks.

471
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,370
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
cancel that order.

472
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:46,804
What'd he say?

473
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,006
It sounded like he said
"cancel the order."

474
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,440
You say "cancel"?
I'm sorry,

475
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,276
cancel what?
Cancel the order.

476
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,978
Don't need it.

477
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,680
Wait, no.
That doesn't work.

478
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,949
Sir, sir, sir...
No, no. No.
You can't do that, though.

479
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,631
...we went 500 grand
in the hole.
We were in business
with each other.

480
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,120
And if you don't buy,
we are ruined.

481
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,388
We were in business
with each other.

482
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,358
He's gonna putt.
He's just gonna putt out.

483
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,161
And he makes the putt.
Wow. Congratulations.
Can you please explain to us
what's happening

484
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,496
and why
you're doing this?

485
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,231
Yeah, sure.
Fair question.

486
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,833
You see, boys, in one week,
your bridge loan comes due.

487
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,969
And you, of course,
won't be able to pay it.

488
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,837
And your loan officer
has assured me

489
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,673
no extension will be granted.

490
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,009
At that moment, your company
will go into foreclosure,

491
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,345
and I will buy
all of those units

492
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,380
at auction
for pennies on the dollar,

493
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,382
even cheaper than I could have
gotten them from the Chinese.

494
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,318
Oh, my fucking god!
I can't believe this.

495
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,221
Anyway, as an added bonus,
I will also own your patent,

496
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,057
and these gentlemen here
will take over manufacturing

497
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,393
of our new product...
the shower pal.

498
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,028
It's a better name, too.
It<i> is</i> a better name.

499
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,596
God damn it.
Fucking hell.

500
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:49,033
Oh, dad, that is a hell
of a fucking play.

501
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,102
We should fit these guys
for crowns,

502
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,204
'cause they just got
fucked royally.

503
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,408
Rex, no call
for this mtv showboating.

504
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,111
They're aware
of their defeat.

505
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:04,248
In these moments,
it's more impactful to be still.

506
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,084
What about all that stuff
about hard work

507
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,019
and starting a company
in America?
Yeah! Yeah, sir.

508
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,221
The American dream
and hard work.
Is that all bullshit?

509
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:13,624
You honestly think
hard work creates wealth?

510
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,695
The only thing
that creates wealth is wealth.

511
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,464
And we have it.
You don't.

512
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,467
Okay. Okay.
You know what?

513
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,035
Take it easy.

514
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,636
Take it easy.
I got it. I got it.

515
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,271
Hey, listen, bucko.

516
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,474
You don't want to make enemies
out of us, okay?

517
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,911
Whoa, easy.
I didn't walk all up on you.

518
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:38,449
I make new enemies every day.
It's called business.

519
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,720
Thank you, gentlemen,
for stopping by.

520
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,422
Have a lovely day.

521
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,823
Rex, get the cake.

522
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,496
Rich motherfucking

523
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,264
over-privileged
fucking assholes!

524
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,266
What happened
to decency?!

525
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,335
Do you realize
I'm gonna lose my house?
Yeah.

526
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,504
You know, Stacy's gonna divorce
me. She's gonna marry some dude.
Yes, she is.

527
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,972
I'm gonna have supervised visits
at a McDonald's.

528
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,174
Fucking McDonald's!
What were we thinking?

529
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,943
Who bets on themselves?
Why the fuck did we do that?

530
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,479
What?
<i>You</i> fucking do! You're the one
who talked me into it!

531
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,014
I was on the fence!
I had the idea.

532
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,450
You were almost on my side.
Oh, we're fucked!

533
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,318
Our employees are fucked! What
about them?! What about lupe?!
Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay.

534
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,020
Okay, okay, okay. Hey, you know
what? This is just a problem.

535
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,289
That means all we got to do is
come up with a solution, right?

536
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,857
You know
what we would do?

537
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,959
We would put some ideas
up on the board, right?

538
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,828
That's what I'm talking about.
Here we go! Here we go!
Here we go, boys!

539
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,030
No idea's a bad idea!
No bad ideas.
No idea's a bad idea!

540
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
Who's gonna start us off?
I got it!

541
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,934
Kurt!
Let's kill
these motherfuckers!

542
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,669
No, no.
Murder! Yes!

543
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,638
M-u-r-d-e-r.
You don't need to
write that down. Hey.

544
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,140
Kill them! We kill them.
We shoot them!
Let's fucking kill them!

545
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,308
No.
Kill them!
I want them dead!

546
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,509
No.
I want them dead!

547
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,677
Neck snap!
I want them dead!

548
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,145
Hey! Enough!

549
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,713
If we've learned one thing
about ourselves,

550
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,382
it's that
we're not murderers.

551
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,783
Besides, how does killing them
get us our money back?

552
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,052
What do you mean?
There's ways.

553
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,621
You harvest their organs, sell
them on the black market. Boom!
Be fucking serious.

554
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,890
Let's... come on. This is
not helpful. Think seriously.

555
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,192
Okay, fine.
You're right. You're right.

556
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,960
There's other things
people have done.

557
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,795
There's plots.
Yeah, for money,
for money, for money.

558
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,297
There's the plot
of the movie "speed."

559
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,798
Yes! There you go!
Put a bomb on a bus.

560
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,533
Great idea. So what we'll do
is we'll rig a bus

561
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,168
so that when it goes
below 50 miles an hour,

562
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,204
it blows up.
What the fuck is that?

563
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,072
You said no idea was a bad idea!
I'm just coming up
with something.

564
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,208
I was wrong. That idea sucks,
the movie sucks, and so do you.

565
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,743
Hey! That is the movie that
introduced us to Sandy bullock.

566
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,145
Fuck you!
I love Sandra bullock!

567
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,747
All right, I'm running hot.
You're right.

568
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,381
I'm sorry. I'm running hot.
I'm just... you know,

569
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,150
the whole fucking thing's
got me upset. I'm sorry.

570
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,085
Give me the marker back, and
I'll come up with a better idea.

571
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,554
You want the marker back?
Give me $500,000, 'cause
that's what we need.

572
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,189
What, you're gonna
hold the marker ransom?

573
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,191
Call it what you want.
I need a half a million dollars.

574
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:30,261
I don't need shit ideas
and a bunch of hot air.

575
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,096
Come on.

576
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,598
Dale!

577
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,603
Boom! Marker drop.

578
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,670
"Kidnaping."

579
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,038
That's "kidnapping."

580
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,107
With one more "p" it is.
That's "kid-nape-ing."

581
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,542
Well,
however the fuck you spell it.
You know what I'm talking about.

582
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,510
I'm talking about kidnapping.
Come on.

583
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,379
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Dude,
that's a fucking great idea!

584
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,549
Think about it. Okay, first
of all, we kidnap Rex. Right?

585
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,752
Right, yeah.
Yeah, the ransom money.
We get money from Bert.
We save the business.

586
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,054
What do you know
about executing a kidnapping?

587
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,856
What do you mean?
You just...

588
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,725
You get zip... zip...
zip ties.

589
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,927
You don't know shit
about kidnapping.

590
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,062
Okay, we don't know a ton.
We don't know a ton, all right?

591
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,530
But I bet
we know someone that does.

592
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:09,367
Who?
Motherfucker Jones.

593
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,535
Oh, Jesus.
Come on, look.
It'd be great to see him.

594
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,037
Wouldn't it be good to see him?
Come on. Please. Please.
Please. Come on.

595
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,605
We're not gonna go see
motherfucker Jones,

596
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,241
because we're not gonna
"kid-nape" anyone.

597
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,077
Come on, this guy's
a master business prick.

598
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,081
He's at the top of his game.
We need to figure out...

599
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,486
Boy, look what we got.

600
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,087
Is that a sharpie?
Well, hang on.

601
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,256
What was a sharpie doing
on there in the first place?

602
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,058
You put it on there.
I did put it on there.

603
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,459
Permanently on the board now.

604
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,762
This illustrates my point,
idiots.

605
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,464
We need to find somebody
who's legitimate.

606
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:44,035
We need to find someone
who can get us our company back.

607
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,451
Hello, Nick.

608
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,186
Guy who saved my life.

609
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,155
Guy who
fucked my wife.

610
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,990
Ah, it was a blow job.
It was a blow job, only.

611
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,258
Didn't fuck her.

612
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,693
You got my e-mail?

613
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:09,695
I did.

614
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,862
And I was very amused by it.

615
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,597
I know Bert hanson.

616
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,000
I like the cut of his jib.
And I do admire

617
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,602
the way he bent you three idiots
over a barrel

618
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,204
and showed you the 50 states.

619
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,873
Ah. See? Told you
it was a saying.
Wow.

620
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,310
Now, Nick, just...
just tell me something.

621
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:29,513
Why would you start production

622
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,517
without at least a guarantee
of 35% down

623
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,686
to cover manufacturing costs?

624
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,023
I mean, why would you do that?

625
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,691
Is he telling a joke?
Is something funny?

626
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,363
Uh, we assumed that
we were dealing with
somebody who was ethical...

627
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,064
No, that's the wrong answer.

628
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:50,067
The right answer is because...

629
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:53,971
You're all fucking morons!

630
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,006
Boy, he shined a light
on that, didn't he?

631
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,175
Yeah. I think...
that's true. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

632
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,811
You thought I was such
a bad boss. But, I don't know,

633
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,514
I think maybe running your
own company into the ground

634
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,750
and ruining the livelihood
of your employees

635
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:08,085
is maybe a bit worse.
What do you think, Nick?

636
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,321
I think that's fair.
Should I be on the phone
if I'm taking notes?

637
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,490
No, we got it. We got it here.
I mean, I'm not getting
any of what he's saying.

638
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,191
It's all right.
It's just a lot of,
you know, rhetorical questions.

639
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,493
Okay, I'll just
try to get his reactions.

640
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,261
So, what do you want
from me, Nick?

641
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:20,197
With all due respect, you know
what makes a guy like that tick.

642
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,433
So if you could give us
some advice

643
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,269
on how to get our money back,
I will play real nice

644
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,105
at your next parole hearing.
How does that sound?

645
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,610
You would do that for me?
Yes, I would.

646
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:35,846
Okay.
I think I can help you.

647
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,182
He's helping.
He's gonna help?
Okay, I got a notepad.

648
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:40,518
I got a notepad!
From a legal standpoint...

649
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,786
"Legal standpoint."
"Legal standpoint."

650
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,521
...your options are...

651
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,456
"Options are."
"Legal options."

652
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,891
...Jack...

653
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,693
Fucking... Shit.

654
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,629
I heard "Jack leibowitz."
Is that an attorney?
Got to be.

655
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:53,697
I'm gonna write that down.
"Jack leibowitz."

656
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,399
Can we get his
contact info, please?
Do you have his contact info?

657
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:58,402
Even if you had the money
to fight him in the courts,

658
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,572
his lawyers are just gonna
file motions and continuances

659
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:05,576
long after you three
piss-ant little fuck-ups

660
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,545
have blown your tiny,
little brains out.

661
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:09,480
Are you saying
nothing can be done?

662
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,749
No, I didn't say that. I said
there's nothing<i> you</i> can do.

663
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:15,586
There's plenty that could be
done, but<i> you</i> won't do it.

664
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,555
And do<i> you</i> want to know why?

665
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:20,591
No, not really.
Because you have no balls!

666
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,625
I see.
Okay.

667
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,627
And your fathers had no balls!

668
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,330
You are all the product
of generations of ball-less men

669
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,466
who were either too weak
or too frightened

670
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,434
to stand up
and take what was theirs.

671
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:35,439
And one day, you will pass on
your empty, shriveled sacs

672
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:38,142
to your own pitiful offspring!

673
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,677
I can't hear a goddamn thing.

674
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,779
What is he talking about?
Our... our nut sacs, mostly.

675
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:44,415
Well, how did that come up?
Why don't you pitch
him the kidnapping?

676
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:46,750
No, let the kidnapping go,
all right?
Pitch him the kidnapping.

677
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,319
Grow some balls,
all right?

678
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,954
You want to see
some balls, Kurt?
Yeah.

679
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,589
Then kidnap someone.
You'll end up in here.

680
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:52,990
You'll see plenty of balls
on your forehead.

681
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,758
Mm.
Why are they
on my forehead?

682
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,627
Was the dick
on top of my head?
That makes no sense.

683
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,262
Oh, I'm upside down.

684
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,030
You sure are.
Your face is getting fucked.

685
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,838
Motherfucker.

686
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
¶ Every day I'm hustling,
hustling ¶

687
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,042
¶ who the fuck you
think you fucking with? ¶

688
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,677
¶ I'm the fucking boss ¶

689
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,113
¶ 745, white-on-white,
that's fucking Ross ¶

690
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,948
mm-hmm.

691
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,619
So, y'all planning to use the
ransom to save your business?

692
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:23,821
Exactly, yeah. That's it.
Yeah, that's what we're hoping.

693
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:26,323
You tell these idiots
how stupid that is, please?

694
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,659
I like it.

695
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,994
Nice. Man, see? Yeah!
I knew he'd like it.
Told you.

696
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:31,662
I appreciate the fact
that you're doing

697
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,631
whatever you need to do
to keep your business going.

698
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,966
Yes.
I had a dream for a long time
to get my own business.

699
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,737
Yeah.
I wanted to open
my own... Pinkberry.

700
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,906
What the fuck
is the chuckles about?

701
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,741
Oh, I thought
you were joking.

702
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,175
You ain't seen how many crackers
line up outside to get that

703
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,545
captain-crunch-covered
freezing-ass shit?

704
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,213
I probably eat it three times
a week. I love pinkberry.
That's a great dream!

705
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,015
Hey, man. That's awesome.
I didn't know that about you.

706
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,683
All I know, if somebody
were to take my pinkberry,

707
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,351
I wouldn't take that
sitting down.

708
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:55,553
Mm-hmm.
You would fight
for that pinkberry.

709
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,421
I would cut a motherfucker
in half.

710
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,723
Tell you what you<i> wouldn't</i> do.
You wouldn't kidnap someone...

711
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,559
Yes, you would.
...'Cause you can't
successfully pull it off.

712
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,028
That's not true!
Name me a kidnapping movie

713
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,764
where the kidnappers weren't
dead or incarcerated at the end.

714
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,666
"Nine to five," asshole.
"Nine to five."

715
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,000
"Nine to five."
Name me<i> two.</i>
Name me<i> two</i> movies, then.

716
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,602
You said name one.
Well, that's a comedy.

717
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,070
You said name one. Bam.
I nailed one right on you.

718
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,438
"Nine to five"
was this movie...

719
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,173
I know what the fuck
"nine to five" is.

720
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,275
It's about the white bitch
with the big-ass titties.

721
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,277
That's the one, yeah.
She got old.
The titties stayed young.

722
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,846
Guys, I'm not gonna kidnap
someone based on "nine to five."

723
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,448
That's because
you Jane Fonda.
Ooh, snap.

724
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,083
That's right.
You're the scaredy-cat one.

725
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,218
You're always the last
to man up about everything.

726
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,221
You're dragging your feet.
Can I pose a question
to you colonizers?

727
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,524
Happened
a long time ago.

728
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:36,727
How do you kidnap somebody
without them knowing...

729
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,963
They've been kidnapped?

730
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,364
Okay.

731
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,899
You smarten up,
and you don't even do it.

732
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,734
Hey, man, no.
He's a black sphinx.
I like this.

733
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,569
Yeah,
he threw a riddle our way.

734
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,972
Okay, how do you...
I can give you the answers.

735
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,141
$50,000.

736
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,143
No.
Ohh.

737
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,644
We can't.
$600?

738
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,980
You should not run a pinkberry.
I'm sorry.

739
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,582
I mean, that's just
the weirdest negotiating style.
We don't have any money.

740
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:02,386
You know, we're here 'cause we
have zero dollars. We're broke.
That's true.

741
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:03,988
Fuck it.
Give me the watch.

742
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,456
Nope.
Give him your watch.

743
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,458
I'm not giving him this.
It's a fucking tag heuer.

744
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,426
And this is a wrist
without a watch.

745
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,595
Come on, Nick. Give him...
it's just material things.

746
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,130
Can't take it with you,
right?

747
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,092
You can borrow it
while you tell us a shitty plan.

748
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,601
All right.

749
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:22,740
Slip him a Mickey.

750
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:24,942
Give me
the watch back.

751
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,443
You sneak into his crib
late at night.

752
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,445
You find out whatever
his beverage of choice is

753
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,848
before he goes to bed. You slip
the Mickey in the beverage,

754
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,484
knock him out nice and easy,

755
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,754
and you keep that bitch sedated
until daddy pays up.

756
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,022
Wait a second.
That could work.

757
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,990
That's great.
That makes total sense.

758
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,291
Yeah, right, 'cause he
doesn't, like, see our
faces or hear our voices.

759
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,260
We're ghosts.
No, we don't even exist.

760
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,262
When you're saying "Mickey,"
you're talking about...

761
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,264
It's like a date rape
drug, okay? Motherfucker,
where do you get those?

762
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,633
Where do<i> I</i> get them?!
Uh, yeah.

763
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,135
You think just because of
the hue of my skin

764
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,970
that I know where to get
date rape drugs?

765
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,972
You brought up
the date raping!
What are you doing, Dale?

766
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:56,273
You got "n" word
in your eyes.

767
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,975
Why are your eyes saying
the "n" word?!

768
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,176
Klan eyes.
<i>You've</i> got klan eyes.

769
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,811
You ever take a eye test?
He does.

770
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:03,047
Yes!
All you pick out is the "k."

771
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,049
I can see every letter
on there!
He<i> does</i> have klan eyes.

772
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,351
You can see them poking out
behind that sheet.

773
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,553
Oh, it's just ridic... I can't...
I mean, I'm not even gonna...

774
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,990
so, let me ask you a question.
When you got raped by Julia,

775
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,491
what did she use
to knock you out, laughing gas?

776
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,826
Why are we...
oh, right.

777
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,861
That'll work.
That's pretty interesting.

778
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,396
Yeah. Do you still have keys
to the, uh, office?

779
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,564
No, but I know the code,
probably.

780
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,800
Yes!
Okay. You did it again.

781
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,368
That's pretty interesting.
Look, for the record,
I am not racist.

782
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,637
You're the best in the biz.
Thank you very much.

783
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:27,638
Okay, good...
good to see you, man.
Come on. Let's go.
We'll see you.

784
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,839
Surprisingly helpful.

785
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,708
Any way
I can get the watch back?

786
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,076
Fuck out of here,
Jane Fonda.

787
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,383
God, that's a tough one.

788
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,051
And you can't
fuck all three, right?

789
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,053
You cannot.
Not the game. Okay.

790
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,689
Well, then,
I would marry Peter,

791
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,691
kill Bobby, and fuck Greg.
That's what I'd do, too.

792
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,526
Yeah? I think that's
the only way to play it.
Yeah.

793
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:50,728
It makes sense.
Yeah.

794
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,996
How'd you do?
Okay. I did great.

795
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,765
I actually got
a couple extra supplies,

796
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,366
'cause I think we got to be
more careful this time around.

797
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,735
You know what I mean?
Absolutely. No, good call.

798
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,103
I got a magazine
to cut up the ransom note.

799
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,671
So smart.
Can't be writing it by hand!

800
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:02,906
So smart.
<i>Bride again</i> magazine?

801
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,375
Yeah, that's to throw
the cops off if they, you
know, start snooping around

802
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,377
and they try to figure out
where the letters came from.

803
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,379
"Dora the explorer"
walkie-talkies?
Awesome.

804
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,715
Well, it's not a spy store.
It's a convenience store.

805
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,517
It's the only kind
of walkie-talkies...
didn't want to
just use our phones?

806
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,519
Oh, let's just use our phones
that make a record of everything

807
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,955
- that we say and do and where we are all the time!
- What?

808
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,556
Do you watch
the fucking news?

809
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,091
"Hey, Obama, I'm... I'm breaking
into my old office!"

810
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,559
It's just the three of us
doing this,

811
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,561
not us and the NSA,
you dipshit.

812
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,463
I'm trying to help us out
so we don't, you know,
do dumb shit this time.

813
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,098
Did you get scissors?
I got some scissors, yeah.

814
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,134
I don't see
any latex gloves in here.

815
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:32,136
They're, like, super expensive.
I didn't want to...

816
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,570
how much?
9 bucks a pair.

817
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,639
That's ridiculous.
Right? It's too much.

818
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,474
Come on. Go in.
It's the only thing you went
in there to buy. Go get it.

819
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,476
She's got a ton of latex gloves
in her office!

820
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,311
We'll just use those.
Good point.
We'll use the ones inside.

821
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,747
You need them to<i> get</i> inside,
so we don't leave fingerprints.

822
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:46,150
Fuck. That's right. You fucking
dummy. don't you know that?

823
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,618
I'm trying to...
it's just such a rip-off.
Hey, you know what we can do?

824
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,052
We can use my golf gloves
I got in my bag.

825
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,588
He's got gloves in his golf bag,
all right?

826
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,223
Great. We'll do that, then.
don't poke holes in everything,
'cause I'm trying to help out.

827
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,292
Okay.
Guys, the team's
back together!

828
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,927
Whoo!
I call lookout,

829
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:59,563
and I will let you know
if I see swiper.

830
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,235
Nice!

831
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,737
Let's go.

832
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,109
How we doing
in there, guys?

833
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,844
Oh, shit.
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

834
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,979
We're all good in here. How are
things looking out there, Nick?

835
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,648
Things are good.

836
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,083
Hey, can you not say my name
over the radio, please?

837
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,251
Why not?

838
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,187
Could be somebody
on the frequency.

839
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,856
Oh, yeah. That's a good point.
Smart. Very smart.
Smart, smart.

840
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:27,991
There you go. That's using
the old Hendricks brain.

841
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,993
And there's
the last name.

842
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,695
Hey, you know what?
What?

843
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,096
We should come up
with code names.
Absolutely.

844
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:34,698
Hey, Nick, where you landing
on code names?

845
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,633
Boy, I'd love it
if you'd stop saying my name.

846
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,368
Can you just get the gas
and get out here?

847
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,503
Roger that.

848
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,841
"The blade"
has acquired the target.

849
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,142
Was that "the blade"?

850
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,810
Mm-hmm. That's
my code name, Nick.

851
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:49,213
We don't need code names.
Everybody knows who's talking.

852
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:51,215
I think they're sounding
pretty cool, though,

853
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:52,716
so let's try
to land on a couple.

854
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,051
I'm gonna think up one
real quick,

855
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,719
and I'm gonna
lay it on you.

856
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:59,356
Uh... I'm coming in at you
with "the majestic lion."

857
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,791
I'm gonna be
"the majestic lion."

858
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:03,493
Now we're talking.
Not gonna call you that.

859
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,964
That's a bummer there. I'm gonna
need a reason as to why.

860
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:10,334
'Cause you're not a jungle cat,
and it's stupid as shit.

861
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,969
Ah, fair point, fair point.
Good catch.

862
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,637
Uh, we should come up
with one for him.

863
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,305
Oh, how about "St. Nick"
for you?

864
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,040
Hey, you've said my name
like four fucking times now.

865
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,709
If you could just come back out
to the car, guys,

866
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,811
we can go home.

867
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:22,479
Oh, hey, you know what?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

868
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,881
Somebody's here.
Somebody's here.

869
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,149
...drop "the lion"
and just "the majestic"?

870
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:27,417
I drop the "the" part, right?
I love that. I like that.
That's what I like.

871
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,052
Shut up
about the code names.

872
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,723
A bunch of people just pulled up
into the parking lot.

873
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:35,259
Uh, hello!
Get your thumb off the butt...

874
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:36,560
yeah, you're right.
It's too much.

875
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:40,264
¶ Hey ¶

876
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,099
¶ hey ¶
oh, my god.

877
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,935
¶ ev-everybody love
me, everybody love me ¶

878
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:49,373
real hot chick just pulled
into Julia's parking spot.

879
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,842
I think Julia's
headed into the building.

880
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:55,412
If you'd get your thumb
off the fucking button and...

881
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,047
ah, fuck. Fucking idiots.

882
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,049
Well, you know what?
It's not my fault.

883
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,051
It's not my goddamn fault.

884
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,887
I haven't done a thing illegal.
I can just drive out of here.

885
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:07,391
I can just
drive right home.

886
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:10,093
No, I can't do that.
I can't do that.

887
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,529
They'll just
fucking tell on me.

888
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,097
All right,
we're on our way to you.

889
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,899
The chickens have left the pot.
My god, my god.

890
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,534
The Coop, I think.
What?

891
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,936
Wait, the "my god, my god"
does sound like a thing.

892
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,805
I know it does. Oh!
Oh, shit!

893
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,451
Why don't you
set the food up over there,

894
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,787
and then we'll just
circle these chairs around?

895
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,127
Dale!

896
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,730
Kurt!

897
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,201
Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-caw!

898
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:53,937
God, Grant us...

899
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:56,740
Oh, shit. It's a cult.
It's a fucking cult!

900
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,642
...about our sex addiction
that we cannot change...

901
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,078
Sex addiction?
It's a sex addiction. Yeah.

902
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,379
Neat!

903
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:08,318
So proud of you,
each and every one of you,

904
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,519
for being here today.

905
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,755
Shit!

906
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,966
How's it going?

907
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:26,169
Hi. It's going, uh...

908
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,704
...You know.

909
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,341
I'm in trouble.

910
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,843
Save it.

911
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,978
Okay.

912
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,740
...something that happened
to them this week.

913
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:41,451
Found this gentleman
loitering out in your hall.

914
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,220
Oh, shit!
Nick got busted!

915
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,489
Says he knows
he's in trouble.

916
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:47,024
Yeah.

917
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,492
We're all in trouble.

918
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,894
You don't have to be afraid.
You're safe here.

919
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,896
Okay.

920
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,865
Sorry I'm late.

921
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,533
'Sup, brother?

922
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,169
Toby, why don't you grab a chair
and bring it into the circle

923
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,904
so this young man
can join us?

924
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,073
Yeah, um...

925
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,975
Boy, uh...

926
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:06,243
What's your name,
honey?

927
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:10,280
I am, um...

928
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,685
I am blanston.

929
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,087
Hi, blanston.

930
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:18,722
Hi.

931
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,690
Well, it's nice to have
some fresh blood in the group.

932
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:21,892
Appreciate it.

933
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,326
Fresh,<i> cute</i> blood.

934
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,562
Hey.
Easy, Julia.

935
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,164
Blanston, would you like to
share with us

936
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,932
what's led
you into recovery?

937
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,233
Uh, well, okay.

938
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,036
I-I do have
a very big... Problem.

939
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,838
Mm.

940
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,607
Just been hitting it
hard. I've been hitting it hard.

941
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,443
He thinks
he's in an aa meeting.

942
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,380
Getting together
with the guys.

943
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:46,416
Oftentimes,
ending up just face down.

944
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:50,253
Chugging one after the other,
sometimes double fisted.

945
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,621
Just "gah, gah, gah,"
you know?

946
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:52,856
You know
what I'm talking about.

947
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,691
So,
your sexual addiction,

948
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,027
it's... it's homosexual
in nature?

949
00:34:57,029 --> 00:35:00,030
My sex addiction?
My sex addiction is, um...

950
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:02,065
And then
what did you say?

951
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,900
You like to fuck guys.
No.

952
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,736
My sex addiction
is to<i> ladies.</i>

953
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,572
Oh.
You know,
I'm addicted to women.

954
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:09,706
Boring.

955
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,142
Quiet!

956
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:14,411
What is...
she's coming! Hide!

957
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,947
But there was once, though.
There was once... oh, boy.

958
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,916
If I could just...
if this is safe in here,

959
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:22,285
I'd love to shake this out
and share it.

960
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,488
Something must've happened.
Don't fall on me.

961
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,290
Don't worry. I took a parkour
class at the community center.

962
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,292
Oh, he got her...
he got her to go back.

963
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,261
Uh, I was a boy.

964
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,996
How old were you?
I don't know. Young.

965
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,965
14, maybe?
I think we were.

966
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,067
Two 14-year-old boys
at camp,

967
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,069
and not knowing
what we're doing,

968
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:41,905
and just...

969
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,006
Wrestling.

970
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,841
Ooh,
wrestling camp.

971
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,409
14.

972
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,844
Nice.

973
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,279
Is he
telling the truth?

974
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,915
I-I don't know.
But, I mean, if he is...

975
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:54,851
Good for him, right?
Absolutely. That's great.

976
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,419
Did you guys wear those, um,
tight, little onesies?

977
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,022
Singlets?
Is that what they're called?

978
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,924
That's right.
Singlets.

979
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:03,493
Tight, little spandex
offering a clear, little outline

980
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,428
of, say,
a circumcised helmet?

981
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,831
Oh, boy.
Am I getting warm?

982
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,666
Okay, uh, maybe someone else
should share.

983
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,935
No, no, no.
Let's go to the unit.
Sorry?

984
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:14,271
What was the unit like
on this little b...

985
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:15,939
was it veiny?
Smooth?

986
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:18,508
Little turtleneck.
Anteater.

987
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,810
I just... I don't know.
Pretty normal.

988
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,513
It's, like, good to have
a gay friend in your
group, too, you know?

989
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,849
Absolutely. Yeah, I know. It is.
It makes us more colorful.
Yeah.

990
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,051
Now, did this penis ever,
a-at any point,

991
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,887
find its way
into your mouth?
Jesus.

992
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,390
Julia, no. You're not gonna
pull this stunt again.

993
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:36,626
What stunt is that?
Stopping a meeting early so she
can try to flip another gay.

994
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:40,063
Really?
She always wants
what she can't have.

995
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:44,134
Listen, relax, okay?
He's not even gay. He had
one cock when he was 14,

996
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:46,570
and it hasn't even made its way
into his mouth yet.
Well, if you'd let me finish...

997
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:49,806
so you<i> did</i> eat that cock.
You're asking
if I sucked it?

998
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,676
I know you sucked it.
I just want to hear you say it.

999
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,544
Okay, blanston,
you don't have to say it.

1000
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,546
Roz, shut your mouth, please.
Yeah, shut up
and let him share!

1001
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,582
So you ate it?
Please say yes. Please say yes.

1002
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:00,183
You want to know
if I ate that dick?

1003
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,886
Did you suck that cock like
a bomb pop down to the blue?

1004
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,921
You want the answer?
Give it to me, blanston.

1005
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,256
I ate that dick,
I ate those balls,

1006
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,258
and I licked that kid's
sweaty asshole!

1007
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,860
Damn right, you did,
because you are awesomely gay!
That's right.

1008
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,395
I am super gay!
Never been straight!

1009
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,998
You know what else
I've never been? Inside a woman.

1010
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,566
Meeting adjourned.
Everybody out.

1011
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,601
Son of a bitch.

1012
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,202
Come on! Hurry it up.

1013
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,838
Hurry it up! Come on! See you
later. Bye-bye. That's it.

1014
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,574
Okay, Julia, you are
letting the addiction win.

1015
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,177
Oh, fuck you, roz.
No one likes you anyway.

1016
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:28,712
Okay.

1017
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:31,448
Mm. Let's get you prepped
for a fill 'n drill.

1018
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,450
Let's do it.
You ever done it
in a dentist's chair?

1019
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:34,951
No, no, I've always
wanted to nail my dentist,

1020
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,453
but he's... he's a man.

1021
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,255
Oh, I'm gonna make you
forget all about him.

1022
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,257
Hey, why... why don't you go
get the chair ready?

1023
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,425
I'm just gonna visit
the men's room real quick, okay?

1024
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,960
Oh,
you can do that on me.

1025
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:47,897
Oh, uh... well, it's, uh...
it's, uh...

1026
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,232
And...?

1027
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,234
Mm, well, uh,
first time on the slopes,

1028
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,236
so I'm gonna stay off
the black diamond.

1029
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,272
Either way.

1030
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:58,642
You guys are so noisy!
Let's go!

1031
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,110
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1032
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,979
Congrats, dude. I'm so proud
of you for coming out.

1033
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,614
I'm not gay. Come on, now.
I'll be right out, okay?

1034
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,316
What... come on!

1035
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,718
I just think it will be a little
suspicious if I disappear,

1036
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,287
so I'm gonna
complete the diversion.

1037
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,055
No, we got to go!
I thought you were gay!

1038
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:13,923
I'm not gay. Go on, go on.
I'll be right out!

1039
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,326
Oh, oh. I get it.
You're bi.

1040
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:17,761
I'm not bi.

1041
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:19,596
Not bi?

1042
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:21,231
Do you have, uh, an "s"?

1043
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,266
"S."
Yeah, I need an "s."

1044
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,768
How's that?

1045
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,336
Uh, do you have a scarier "s"
than that, or...?

1046
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,971
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got a... oh, here.

1047
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,606
This is from an article
about bridezillas.

1048
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:31,107
Yeah, that'll do it.

1049
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,109
Okay, uh, can I read you
what I've got right now?

1050
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,612
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Okay.

1051
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:37,247
"Give us the $500,000,

1052
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,649
or the little boy dies!"

1053
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:44,120
"You have 24 hours-s-s-s."

1054
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,522
Shit. I wish you were there
to read it to him.

1055
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,123
That sounds scary as hell
in that voice.

1056
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,291
Well, that's why I wanted
the scary letters, you know,

1057
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,760
so hopefully he...
you know,

1058
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,362
he's hearing a voice like that
when he reads it.
Oh. Oh, that
you would hope. Yeah.

1059
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,798
God, I tell you what.
I hope this doesn't sound cocky.

1060
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,434
I think we're really good
at this.

1061
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:58,802
We're extremely good at it.
Yeah.

1062
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:01,137
And I didn't want to say
anything, either,

1063
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,106
but, like,
way better than murder.
Oh, my god.
A lot better than murder.

1064
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,341
You know, it's like
we kind of found our groove.

1065
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,009
This is fun.
It<i> is</i> kind of fun.

1066
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,977
Like, it's like... and nobody
gets hurt or anything.

1067
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,479
I always wanted to make
a ransom note like this.

1068
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:10,680
Oh, here we go. Here we go.
All here! Let's go.

1069
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,515
Oh! Son of a bitch.

1070
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,851
I knew I should have been
gluing them as I went along.

1071
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,853
Oi-oi-oi.

1072
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,155
Hey. Hey. Talk to me.
How was it?

1073
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,624
It was like something
I-I've just never encountered.

1074
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,626
What, a-a woman?

1075
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:27,197
I mean, she's so free.
She's so eloquent with her body.

1076
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,467
I mean, all of that...
all of that sexual energy,

1077
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:33,670
it flows from this place
of deep tenderness, you know?

1078
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,572
It's called her vagina,
Nick.

1079
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:36,740
Please don't talk
like that, you guys.

1080
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,408
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

1081
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,143
Golly, listen to this guy.
He's being so protective.

1082
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,745
I know. You're talking like
you fell in love with her.

1083
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:44,981
What... are you
in love with her, Nick?

1084
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:47,417
No, Dale.
That was a real long pause
right there, buddy.

1085
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:49,719
That was a fucking
moment of silence.
That was a real long pause
right there.

1086
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,721
I'm not in love with her.
That's ridiculous.
That's what we don't need.

1087
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:55,058
I don't need you...
she gave me a very rich
and positive experience.

1088
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,394
Oh, yeah?
Better than wrestling camp?

1089
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:07,837
Oh, boy.

1090
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,038
Nice house.

1091
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
Eh, well,
he's doing well.

1092
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,009
Good for him.

1093
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:15,011
All right, let's discuss
our options, huh?
Breathe, and go!

1094
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:17,614
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1095
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,849
Guys, you can't just park right
in front of the guy's house.

1096
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,352
Wait. You want to carry
a giant unconscious
dude down the street?

1097
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,187
He's gonna be way too heavy.
Come on! Let's move.
Come on.

1098
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,589
That's a good point.
Good point.

1099
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,358
Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1100
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,360
You can't just walk up
to the guy's front door.
Shh!

1101
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:31,961
Will you calm down?
We have a plan.

1102
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:33,396
We have a plan!
Just relax.

1103
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:35,031
Oh, do you?
That's great.

1104
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,634
That makes me feel
a lot better.

1105
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,636
Okay, you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

1106
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,070
Watch this. Go.

1107
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,472
Ah, fuck.

1108
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:45,074
Fuck. It's a bust.
It's locked.

1109
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:48,311
The plan did not account
for a locked door?

1110
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,447
Well...
Well, I mean, it's
a 50/50 chance it's
gonna be open, right?

1111
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,549
How do you figure that?

1112
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,551
It's either locked
or unlocked. Yeah.
50/50. Yeah.

1113
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,920
It's like basic math.
What's up with you tonight?
Hmm.

1114
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:58,755
Give me your credit card.
Yeah. Credit card.
Credit card.
Good. All right.

1115
00:40:58,757 --> 00:40:59,956
Plan b's got
a credit card in it?

1116
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,558
Come on.
Your plan sucks.

1117
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,960
Your<i> math</i> sucks.
That's what's going on there.

1118
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,295
Wait. Shit.
What if he's in there?

1119
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,464
Oh, yeah.
How do we make sure he's not?

1120
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:08,832
I don't know. Why don't
you guys ring the doorbell
while you're hot?

1121
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,600
I love it. Smart.
No. don't. don't, Kurt!

1122
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,836
Oh, shit! Are you kidding?

1123
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:16,139
You know, it's pretty
dark in there. I don't
think anybody's here.

1124
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,307
Don't... don't hit it again!

1125
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,008
You hear that?

1126
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,777
I know that song.
Huh?

1127
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,345
What is that?
It's a song, right? Is it...

1128
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:24,581
yeah. What song is that?
¶ no matter what you do ¶

1129
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:25,915
no, no.

1130
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,016
¶ I will always be with you ¶

1131
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,785
who sings that?
Badfinger.

1132
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:30,620
¶ No matter
what you do, girl ¶

1133
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:31,754
quiet!

1134
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:32,956
¶ Ooh, girl ¶

1135
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,991
¶ with you ¶
you nailed it.

1136
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,793
¶ Knock
on this old gray wall ¶

1137
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:38,261
shut the fuck up!

1138
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:39,262
Shh. Shh.
Hey, you're yelling.

1139
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:40,363
Hey.
You're yelling.

1140
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:41,798
Do me a favor.
Hurry up.

1141
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,199
Fail to open up
the front door

1142
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,635
so we can get
the fuck out of here.

1143
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,871
Ah, fuck.
Oh!

1144
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:48,938
What's "fuck"?
What happened?

1145
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,440
We got a problem.
Hang on.

1146
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,442
Yeah, see?
Right there?

1147
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:52,642
Yep.
God damn it.

1148
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,043
There it is,
just staring back at us.

1149
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,178
Okay, what now?

1150
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,446
I guess
we follow your idea,

1151
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:57,514
and we get
the heck out of here.

1152
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:58,982
Yeah, we got to go.
No, no.

1153
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,650
Hey, hey, hey!
My credit card is in there.

1154
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:02,552
Yeah, I know. Just
call them and cancel
it. It'll be fine.

1155
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:03,953
Yeah. They'll send you
a new one like overnight.
Yeah. Like that.

1156
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,355
No, no, no.
When they find the card,

1157
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,556
they're gonna know
that we were here.

1158
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,358
It's pretty simple.
Oh, shit.

1159
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,726
Well, technically, they're
gonna know<i> you</i> were here.

1160
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:12,262
Go, go! Car! Car!

1161
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,972
Is that his wife?

1162
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:24,574
No.
That's a '93 civic,

1163
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:25,808
and she's carrying
dry cleaning.

1164
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,210
I'm gonna go
with a maid.

1165
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,146
He married his maid?

1166
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,384
Nice.

1167
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:43,026
Mr. Rex!
Are you home?!

1168
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,895
It me, Kim song!

1169
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:49,332
I pick up your dry cleaning!

1170
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,045
Okay, I got it!

1171
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,581
Wow.
He's got good taste.

1172
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,783
It's bent, god damn it.

1173
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:08,017
Nice, clean lines.
Little pops of color.

1174
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,252
Let's go.

1175
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,420
Go?
What?

1176
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,221
Hey, we just got inside.
Let's stay.

1177
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:14,223
Yeah, so did she.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1178
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,392
What, are you quitting
on the plan, dude?

1179
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,528
Back in! Back in!
Back in! Back in! He's here,

1180
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,696
Why? Who's here?

1181
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:20,698
Mr. Rex.

1182
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,032
Shit!

1183
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:25,368
Kim?!

1184
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,537
You here?!

1185
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:30,540
Hey, Kim.
You got my shirts?

1186
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:31,742
Yes, Mr. Rex.
I go hang up now.

1187
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:32,976
Great.

1188
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:35,244
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Kim. Kimbo.

1189
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,446
Take a look at this
for me.

1190
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,081
Will you tell me
what you see?

1191
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,316
Uh...
Are you gonna leave
this mess

1192
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,918
in the bottom of my sink?

1193
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,886
The... Water?

1194
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:47,457
Yes. The little water droplets
all over the bottom of my sink.

1195
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,459
I don't know what thatched hut
you grew up in,

1196
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:50,827
but this is disgusting.

1197
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,829
But it...
it just water.

1198
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:55,064
Okay. Okay.

1199
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:57,233
Then you just fire.

1200
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,636
Mm-hmm.
You lose your job.

1201
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:01,070
Too bad for you.

1202
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:04,641
Bye-bye!

1203
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,477
Look at you!

1204
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,145
I got you again!

1205
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,014
Look at
that little chubby face!

1206
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:13,249
What, did you think
I was gonna fire you

1207
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,651
on your fucking birthday?

1208
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,486
Are you out of your mind,
Mrs. miyagi?

1209
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:17,787
Get over here.

1210
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,355
Come here, you.
Happy birthday!

1211
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:23,359
Hold on one sec. Hey.

1212
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:26,529
Yeah. No, no, no. I'm just
trying to make my maid's day.

1213
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,698
It's her birthday.
Huh?

1214
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,000
Hey, Kim.
Seriously, though...

1215
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,635
can we keep a dry sink
from here on in?

1216
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:34,170
Yes, Mr. Rex.

1217
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,172
What's up?

1218
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,840
No, fuck that, man.

1219
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,009
Kim.

1220
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:42,945
Ohh!

1221
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:26,055
Dude, I'm trying.

1222
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,857
My dad is being a total dick
about the money.

1223
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:30,593
What's she doing?

1224
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:32,228
Oh, my god.
What is she doing?!

1225
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,563
Oh, my god.
Kurt, Kurt, Kurt.

1226
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:35,932
What? What? What?

1227
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:37,366
Oh, shit.
That's<i> my</i> thing!

1228
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:38,735
She's doing my thing!

1229
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,269
I can't believe
she's fucking doing that!

1230
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,071
She's not going in
deep enough.

1231
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,907
What a rookie.

1232
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,276
Okay, there she goes.
Okay. All right.

1233
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:49,812
Kimchi!

1234
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:54,083
There he is!
Okay. Shh. Shh.

1235
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,284
Shh, shh.
Oh, no.

1236
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:57,386
He's gonna brush
his teeth.

1237
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,255
He's gonna do it.
He's gonna do it.
Here he goes. Here he goes.

1238
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,624
Do it.
Do it! Yeah!

1239
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:04,527
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh!

1240
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:07,530
Yeah, get them nice and clean,
you son of a bitch!

1241
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:10,566
So satisfying.
Wait, guys. Okay.
Now what, though?

1242
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:12,401
What are we doing?
What do we do now?
What do we do now?

1243
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,603
We wait for him
to go to bed.

1244
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:15,238
Dale starts the gas,
okay?

1245
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,539
I've got the ransom note.

1246
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:17,640
Not now. Not now. Not now.
Turn it off.

1247
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:19,108
He said,
"Dale, start the gas."

1248
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,543
No. I said,
"Dale<i> starts</i> the gas."

1249
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:22,245
You said, "Dale, start..."
later, you idiot.

1250
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:23,446
Turn that off!
We can't have the gas in here.
Jesus.

1251
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,647
Okay.
I'll put this on the...

1252
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:26,616
hey. Turn it off.

1253
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:28,951
I'm trying to.
It's, like, broken or something.
Are you kidding me?

1254
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,920
Give it to me.
Turn it the other way.
Turn it the other way.

1255
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,121
We dropped it
like a million times.

1256
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,422
I think we broke it.
No. See?

1257
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:34,957
It's just like
it's not doing anything.

1258
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,326
Let's get the fuck
out of here.
Get out of here?

1259
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,728
What are you talking about?
He's right outside!
Shit! He's right there!

1260
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,329
Then get the fucking can
out of here!

1261
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:41,330
Don't start laughing.
Look at your face.

1262
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:42,465
What is funny about this?

1263
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:43,900
Look at his face.

1264
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:45,902
Oh, no.
Dude, you got<i> your</i> face.

1265
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,503
The gas. Is this the gas?
Face.

1266
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,939
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

1267
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:51,340
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey.

1268
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,176
No, no.
Listen. Keep it together.

1269
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:54,410
Yes, it's the gas.

1270
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,012
It's pretty good.

1271
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:57,446
<i>You</i> keep it together.

1272
00:46:57,448 --> 00:47:00,449
Ooh. W-whoa!

1273
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,285
I was trying to hit him.

1274
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:04,120
Guys.

1275
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:05,955
Oh, no, no, no. No.
No. No. No.

1276
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:07,790
Okay. I'm good.
I'm good.

1277
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:10,193
Let's...

1278
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:21,204
¶<i> Tiger, a fighter</i> ¶

1279
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:22,638
¶<i> dancing through the fire</i> ¶

1280
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,641
shit. Kurt. Kurt.
Your phone.

1281
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,276
Hmm? Oh.
Your phone.
It's your phone.

1282
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:29,679
I got it.
I got it. I got it.
Where are we?

1283
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,314
Shut it off.

1284
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:32,882
Why is your wife
calling me?

1285
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:34,984
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1286
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:37,987
She's probably freaking out.
I didn't come home last night.
Quiet.

1287
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,690
Dude, get your fucking head
out of my crotch.
Hmm?

1288
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:48,831
Will you look at this fucking
view during the daytime?
Hey.

1289
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,666
You kidding me?
Unbelievable!
All right.

1290
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:52,668
He seems gone. Bed's made.
Yeah. Yeah.

1291
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,871
I can't believe this.
We should maybe just check.

1292
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,505
Hey! Rex!
Hey.

1293
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:57,707
Rex!

1294
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:58,908
Rex!

1295
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,910
Dale!
Huh?

1296
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:03,746
Did you have a plan
if he responded?

1297
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:05,581
I didn't think
that far ahead.
Yeah. Of course you didn't.

1298
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,883
I would have
just been quieter.
Yeah.

1299
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,517
You're even dumber
in the mornings.

1300
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:11,554
You know, Stacy's
just gonna completely flip out

1301
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,022
when I get home.
Dale, do me a favor.

1302
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:14,423
What kind of dad
doesn't come home all night?!

1303
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:15,691
Shut that down, okay?
You're not a dad yet.

1304
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:17,226
Because if the worst thing
that happens

1305
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:18,861
from this whole clusterfuck
is your domestic problems,

1306
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:20,196
then we can consider
ourselves lucky.

1307
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,597
We just dodged a huge bullet
back there.

1308
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,067
We almost made the worst
decision of our lives.

1309
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,669
No, that's true.
You know why?

1310
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,437
'Cause if he opens
that closet door and sees us,

1311
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:30,273
we're...
we're in prison right now.
That's... that's right.

1312
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:32,275
You know?
So we're very, very lucky.

1313
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:34,076
What the fuck
is the matter with us?

1314
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,378
You know what?
I tell you what.

1315
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,779
If a couple tiny things
went our way,

1316
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,180
we could have
pulled that off.
No.

1317
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,049
Just saying.
We're not criminals!

1318
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,517
We suck at crime!
We're, like, nice, normal guys.
I know.

1319
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,287
I like baseball.
I wear pants.
Yeah. Yep.

1320
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,688
Back to being cogs
in the machine.
Cogs!

1321
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,056
No shame in that.
Cogs, dude.

1322
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,258
No, cogs are good.
It's a relief, you know?

1323
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,127
It's like a weight...
a weight lifted off your...

1324
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:52,628
what is that... shoulders?
That's right.
No, this is good.

1325
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,930
This is good.
It's a fresh start

1326
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:55,097
where everything's
gonna be like...

1327
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,399
I'll call you guys later.

1328
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:57,700
Please don't kill me!

1329
00:48:57,702 --> 00:49:00,102
Fuck!
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

1330
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,537
What the fuck is that?!
What the fuck is that?!

1331
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,972
What did we do?

1332
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:05,141
We fucking kidnap him
while we're high on nitrous?

1333
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:06,776
And then what? Just went
back into the closet

1334
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:08,377
and went to sleep?
Why would we do that?

1335
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:09,578
Shh, shh, shh.
What?

1336
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,282
Is he crying?

1337
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:19,822
The best!

1338
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:23,292
That was so good.

1339
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,493
Help me out.

1340
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,130
The look on your...

1341
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:33,903
Yeah. All right.

1342
00:49:33,905 --> 00:49:36,105
I really couldn't...

1343
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:38,274
Your fucking face!

1344
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:40,910
Oh, my god.
Hey, man. Yeah.

1345
00:49:40,912 --> 00:49:43,245
Whoo-wee.
Ah.

1346
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:44,647
You had us.

1347
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:45,848
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh! Oh! Oh!

1348
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,686
What's happening?
I don't know.

1349
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:53,322
What's happening?
Oh, boy.

1350
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,159
Oh, my god!
You guys!

1351
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,794
I completely
underestimated you.

1352
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,997
You fuckers
have some low-hanging balls!

1353
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,698
I mean it.
I'm impressed.

1354
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,300
Hmm.
I mean, I wake up,

1355
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,935
I find you three
in my closet,

1356
00:50:05,937 --> 00:50:08,337
along with a ransom note,
a big ol' bottle of nitrous.

1357
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,772
I'm like, "holy shit!

1358
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:11,607
These fuckers
were gonna gas me!"

1359
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:14,610
I'm about to call the cops
when I think, "hold up a sec.

1360
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:17,780
These guys
may be onto something."

1361
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:20,216
I want to partner up
on this thing.

1362
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:21,550
Part... what are you
talking about?

1363
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:22,952
What thing?
What are you talking about?

1364
00:50:22,954 --> 00:50:24,153
I'm not sure what you mean.
Mm. The thing?

1365
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:26,155
This thing. My kidnapping.
Oh.

1366
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:28,791
Truth be told,
pop and I,

1367
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:30,626
we've hit
a rough patch lately.

1368
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,461
He's refusing to cover
some of my expenses.

1369
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:33,963
Blah, blah, blah.
Long story.

1370
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:35,364
Anyway, your timing
could not have been better.

1371
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,233
Is this
a fucking marlin?

1372
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:38,667
Rex, this is, uh,
cool and all,

1373
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,669
but we decided,
like, we're out.

1374
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,304
You know,
we're not doing crime.
Yeah. Not our thing.

1375
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:43,706
Yeah, no, he's right.
No.

1376
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,708
The kidnapping is off,
actually.
Okay?

1377
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,376
Huh?
No. No, no, it's on.

1378
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,011
No, it's off.
No, it's totally on!

1379
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:50,813
I sent the ransom note
to my dad!

1380
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:52,314
You what?
You did what?
Yeah.

1381
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:53,649
I was a little insulted

1382
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:55,051
you only asked for $500,000
for me.

1383
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,252
I mean,
is that all I'm worth?

1384
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:57,353
Hmm? No sweat.

1385
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:59,255
I tacked on
another zero.

1386
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:00,489
$500 million?!

1387
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,558
Wow. That's a ton.
No.

1388
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,527
$5 million, guys.
$5 million.

1389
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,262
$5 million. $5 million.
5? Right, right,
right, right.

1390
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:07,530
Yeah. $5 million.

1391
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:10,533
$1 million for you guys.
4 for me.

1392
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,401
Why don't we find a pay phone
and make that ransom call?

1393
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,603
Yeah, Rex, let's...
let's not, ok...

1394
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,072
we appreciate
the generous offer,

1395
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,907
and thank you very much
for not calling the cops.

1396
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,508
Yes.
But we're gonna pass.

1397
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:20,943
No.
Yeah.

1398
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:23,045
Guys. Guys, how's this
anything but great news?

1399
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:25,681
All I'm asking you to do
is finish your own plan,

1400
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,917
but for double the money.

1401
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,552
And, plus, it just got
1,000 times easier

1402
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:31,187
because now
I'm your inside man.

1403
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:32,922
I can make sure
dad pays up.

1404
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,924
And then, you know,
when you "set me free,"

1405
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,559
I can tell the cops
it was three other morons.

1406
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:37,893
"They went thataway."

1407
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,428
Oh. Well, wow.

1408
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,397
I mean, that's not the worst
idea I've ever heard.

1409
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:43,032
I mean, it's better
than our original idea.
A lot better.

1410
00:51:43,034 --> 00:51:45,901
G-give us one second?
Fucking what?!

1411
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:48,604
We can't trust this guy.
You can trust me.

1412
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,039
No, you're right.
What are we talking about?

1413
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,874
Yeah. Of course.
They burned us once already.

1414
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,075
We're not gonna get
burned again.
Nice try.

1415
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:54,810
Uh, thanks,
but, no, thanks.

1416
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:56,645
That's a niggerda...
Nick-Kurt-Dale no from us.

1417
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,080
Nick, Kurt, and Dale.
Yeah.

1418
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:01,217
So thank you,
but adiós.

1419
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,618
Okay.
You need a ride?

1420
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,054
No. I think
I'll hang out here.

1421
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:07,056
You know...
escape from your clutches.

1422
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:09,592
And call the police.

1423
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:10,993
And tell them what?
Go ahead. Call them. Yeah.

1424
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,928
We never kidnapped you.
Yeah, you did.

1425
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,930
We didn't.
Yeah, you abducted me.

1426
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:16,765
We did not.
Yeah, you brought me
back here.

1427
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,400
There was a struggle.

1428
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:19,802
Oh, shit!
Come on, man!

1429
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:22,271
Things got broken.

1430
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:24,573
What the...

1431
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,642
And then
you assaulted me.

1432
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,310
Oh, shit! What?!

1433
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,945
This guy's fucking nuts.
What are you doing?

1434
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:31,814
Hey, Rex.
It's off, pal.

1435
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,649
Oh,
and then you beat me.

1436
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,451
Mercilessly.

1437
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:37,653
- Oh, wow!
- Holy shit!

1438
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,754
He's "fight-clubbing"
himself!

1439
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,156
We got
a "fight-clubber"!

1440
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,358
And then I found my way
up here.

1441
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,994
Then I found this phone.
Then I picked up the receiver.

1442
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:47,296
Oh, no.
And I dialed 9...

1443
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:49,698
don't, don't, don't call.
Come on, man. Joke's over.

1444
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,834
...1...
don't you hit
the second "1."

1445
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,117
don't hit it.
Come on, man. don't do it!
don't do it! Stop!

1446
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:56,839
I don't know
where I'm going.

1447
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,607
I don't even know where you
find pay phones these days.

1448
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,342
No. There's some... there's some
pay phones at the park up here.

1449
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,344
Okay.

1450
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,546
Boys,
we are doing this!

1451
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:05,848
The adventure begins!
Who's fired up?

1452
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:10,119
Such a negative energy.
This is killing me.

1453
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:12,521
Guys, come on.
Will you... can you actually...

1454
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,156
can you scoot over
just a-a-a smidge?
Huh?

1455
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:15,791
No.
I sit in the middle.

1456
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,059
That's his seat, dude.
It's a whole thing, Rex.

1457
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:18,694
I know.
It's just you're crowding me.

1458
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,896
I'm crowding
this guy now?

1459
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,898
He's forcing us to kidnap him,
and I'm crowding him?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1460
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,733
Buddy. Simmer down.

1461
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:26,635
Kidnapping was
<i>your</i> idea. Remember?

1462
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:28,637
Yeah, but then we had
the idea to not do it.

1463
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,239
Yeah, exactly.
I sit in the middle!

1464
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:31,507
Hey, hey.

1465
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:32,708
Dale, just do
what he says.

1466
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,477
Oh,
for Christ's sake.

1467
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:39,114
Oh, god. That is nice.
This is way better.

1468
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:43,285
This is bullshit,
by the way.

1469
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,758
E-excuse me,
Dr. Harris.

1470
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,761
Was someone
in the office last night?

1471
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:55,431
Uh, my sex addiction group
met here at 8:00.

1472
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:57,499
Oh. Yes.

1473
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:59,935
But, doctor, the keypad
logged an earlier entrance.

1474
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:01,570
Really?

1475
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,606
Let's check
our fancy new camera system.

1476
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,844
That's a gay guy.
It's so weird.

1477
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:10,613
He didn't bone me like a gay
guy. You know what I mean?

1478
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:12,214
He only cried
like a little bit.

1479
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:14,049
And he was oddly squeamish
about his own asshole,

1480
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,417
which is weird.

1481
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,052
It's so weird.

1482
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:18,687
Yeah.
That's what I thought.

1483
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:21,523
Is that... Dale?

1484
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:24,593
What's he doing
with Kurt and blanston?

1485
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,562
Should we call
the police?

1486
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:30,099
No. No.
I'll take care of them.

1487
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,534
Enjoy.

1488
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:36,038
It's good stuff.
Learn something.

1489
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:43,646
All right, guys.
It's ringing.

1490
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:45,281
Remember... you guys
hold all the cards.

1491
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:48,284
Game faces.
You are going to crush this.

1492
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:49,785
Okay, wait. Hold on. Hold on.
He knows what we sound like.

1493
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,620
We got to, like,
use an accent or something.

1494
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,155
You know what I mean?
Accents?
No accents. That's ridiculous.

1495
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:54,590
No, that's a great idea,
kurty.

1496
00:54:54,592 --> 00:54:56,158
Boulder stream.

1497
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,594
Accent. The secretary.
Who is this? The secretary?

1498
00:54:58,596 --> 00:54:59,795
Uh, hey, homey!

1499
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,964
Let me speak
to Mr. Bert hanson.

1500
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,632
No, I don't mind holding.
Yeah.

1501
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,768
I just barely even called you
right now, already.

1502
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,936
That's incredibly racist.
Super racist.

1503
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,305
Just... just do...
just a Southern accent.

1504
00:55:09,307 --> 00:55:10,572
Southern?
Southern I got.

1505
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:11,840
Southern, Southern.
No problem.

1506
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:15,511
Hanson.

1507
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:17,946
Well, howdy, there, partner.

1508
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:20,916
Uh, this here's the gents what
got your young 'un and all.

1509
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:23,652
And, well, we... we got
some talkin' to do and...

1510
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,487
Southern.
Not old prospector.

1511
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,822
I thought
that was pretty good.

1512
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:29,258
Listen,
you low-life bottom-feeder.

1513
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,527
I don't have time
for this little fuck-around.

1514
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:34,096
Either this ends right now,

1515
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:36,131
- or it ends with bullets in your skulls.
- Now, you hush there.

1516
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,500
You don't scare us one bit.
We got your boy.

1517
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,135
Huh? I'll bet that tears
you up somethin' fierce.

1518
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:43,205
Oh, yeah? How do I know
you really have my boy?

1519
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:45,841
Dad!

1520
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:49,178
Dad, is that you? Please!
They're... they're crazy.

1521
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,380
They told me if you call
the police, they'd kill me.

1522
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:52,948
Please.
Please do whatever they say.

1523
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,884
I don't want to die, dad!
No police!

1524
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:57,820
Oh! God!

1525
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:59,221
Rex? Rex?
Where are you?

1526
00:55:59,223 --> 00:56:00,522
Now, you listen here.

1527
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:01,957
Y'all gonna
have to wrassle up

1528
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:05,294
that 5 million bucks
in cash.

1529
00:56:05,296 --> 00:56:06,995
We're looking
at all $100s.

1530
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,063
Unmarked.
Unmarked.

1531
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:09,164
No tracers.
No tracers.

1532
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:11,200
And no dye packs neither!
Sure.

1533
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:13,635
Otherwise,
we gonna take your boy

1534
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:17,473
and string him up
by his pretty little neck

1535
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:20,876
with the roughest,
coarsest piece of rope

1536
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:24,646
we got
in our rope inventory.

1537
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:27,750
You understand?
You got 24 hours before he dead.

1538
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:29,585
- Boom!
- Yes.

1539
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:31,820
That is how it's done.
Let's go. All right?

1540
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:34,723
Guys, that was great!
Mm-hmm.

1541
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,392
That was so much fun!
Yeah!

1542
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:37,826
Absolutely.
You were incredible!

1543
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:39,928
Thanks. Thanks
for getting us snacks, dude.

1544
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,330
You earned it.

1545
00:56:41,332 --> 00:56:42,531
All right. So now what?
What do we do?

1546
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,066
Okay.
What's the plan?

1547
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,601
I say we go back
to the office.
Mm-hmm.

1548
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:47,836
Okay?
Lay low for a little while.
Yeah.

1549
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,439
And we wait for
that money train to roll in.

1550
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:52,074
Choo-choo!

1551
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:53,675
Choo-choo!
Choo-choo, baby!

1552
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,211
Oh, turn up this song!
I love this song.
Mm!

1553
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:57,579
We're doing this thing!
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1554
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,214
You know, I hate
to break up the car party,

1555
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:01,617
but, Rex, you don't have
a plan for the ransom drop,

1556
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,051
and that is the part
where people get caught, okay?

1557
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:04,353
Wow. Wow.
God.

1558
00:57:04,355 --> 00:57:06,755
The ransom drop
is only hard

1559
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,190
if the police
are involved.

1560
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:09,591
Yeah, dude!
Yeah. That's right.

1561
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,226
But what if he does
call the police?

1562
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:12,461
'Cause that
wouldn't be good.

1563
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:13,929
He's a billionaire.

1564
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,764
Well, he's not gonna risk
my life over $5 million.

1565
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,400
After Kurt's little
performance back there...
Aw, come on.

1566
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:19,802
...there's no way
he's gonna call the cops.

1567
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:21,370
Trust me.
<i>My</i> performance?

1568
00:57:21,372 --> 00:57:22,771
What about yours?
You were so in the moment!

1569
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,940
You think so?
You were great!

1570
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,709
And<i> you</i> were great!
Get your mouths off
his dick, okay? Come on.

1571
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:29,711
I'm just saying everyone was,
you know, doing pretty good.
Whoa, whoa.

1572
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:30,946
Take it down a notch.

1573
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:31,980
Wait. Shut up!
Shut up, shut up!

1574
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:33,282
Shut up!
This is Stacy.

1575
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:34,283
Oh, my god.
I forgot to call her.

1576
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,784
Uh, hi, honey!

1577
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,985
Where the hell
have you been all night, Dale?

1578
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:38,720
Now,
here's what happened...

1579
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:41,323
I fell asleep at the office,
really?

1580
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:43,892
Because find my iPhone said
you weren't even at the office.

1581
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,961
What, are you cheating
on me, Dale?

1582
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,796
Look, you're...
you're upset, and you're...
oh, shit!

1583
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,232
Oh, god.
God damn it.

1584
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:51,834
He called the cops.
Oh, we're busted.

1585
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:53,936
Busted?! Oh, my god!

1586
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:55,671
Well, fucker,
drive or pull in.
I'm not busted, honey.

1587
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:58,073
No one is busted in like
a bad sense of the word.

1588
00:57:58,075 --> 00:57:59,641
Too late. Lupe's got us.
Pull in.

1589
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,310
Okay. We're pulling in.
Put your head in my lap.

1590
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:02,945
Honey, no one's head's
going in my lap.

1591
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:04,313
It's just something
that the guys are saying now.

1592
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,681
What the hell is going on?!
I can't talk!

1593
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:07,449
Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.
I am fucked!

1594
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:08,917
Okay. Let's just go in.

1595
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:11,019
We got to be calm
and just be cool.
Shit. Hi.

1596
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:14,289
Gentlemen.
You own this establishment?
This place here?

1597
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:16,458
Oh, boy.
I don't know. Do you really
own anything in this lifetime?

1598
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,659
We... we're renting.
We're currently renting the...
You know what I mean?

1599
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,927
It's all just
material and matter.

1600
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:20,429
We... yes. Yes.
Electrons, protons.

1601
00:58:20,431 --> 00:58:21,997
What?
Yeah. We do.
I mean, technically, yeah.

1602
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,632
Let me ask you,
has your company

1603
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:27,002
done business recently
with a Mr. Bert hanson?

1604
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,137
Barb fanson?
Doesn't ring a bell.
No, he said...

1605
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,807
not really ringing a bell.
I don't think that we have.

1606
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,976
Yeah. No, no,
that's not our guy.

1607
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:35,344
Oh, well,
that's interesting.

1608
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:36,979
The way I hear it,
you're working with him,

1609
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:40,048
and things didn't shake out
too well for you boys.

1610
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,216
Oh,<i> that</i> Bert!
Oh, Bert hanson!

1611
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:42,951
Oh, yeah.
Is that what he said?

1612
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:45,320
Oh, yeah, yeah. We know him.
Yes. We know<i> that</i> guy.

1613
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:47,155
You know, we had
a business disagreement.

1614
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:49,458
No big deal.
We liked the guy

1615
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,860
and definitely don't think his
son deserves to be kidnapped.
Yeah, yeah. Mm...

1616
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,495
Kidnapped?

1617
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:56,532
Who said anything
about kidnapping?

1618
00:58:58,168 --> 00:58:59,368
Uh...

1619
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,303
I...
I want to say you did.

1620
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:02,571
No, I didn't.
I think I heard you say it.

1621
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:04,806
No, I didn't.
I feel like you did.

1622
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,542
I sort of heard it, too.
You said "kidnapping."

1623
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:08,377
I was like,
"what a weird word!"
Yeah, yeah.

1624
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:09,978
Should be
more "kidnabbing."

1625
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:13,048
No, I did not.
Did I say that?

1626
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,417
I think you might
have said it, sir.
You're sure?

1627
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:17,019
Well, I got a little lost
with all their yammering,

1628
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:19,555
but pretty sure.

1629
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:23,225
All right. Maybe I did.

1630
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:25,360
Hey.
Been a long week.

1631
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:27,229
We'll be in touch.
Yeah, yeah!

1632
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,997
All right, see you guys.
Anytime you want.
And don't worry,

1633
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:30,599
'cause the main thing
is that you said it.
All right.

1634
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:32,501
Stop talking.
Stop talking.

1635
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:34,703
And...
you've done plenty,
plenty of talking.

1636
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:36,338
Where you going?
Come back here.
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

1637
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,173
Come over here.
We're going this way.

1638
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:41,176
And I don't want you
to thank me.

1639
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:43,011
I just want you to go home
and enjoy your family.

1640
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:44,413
Enjoy the rest
of the day off, everyone!

1641
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:45,614
You've earned it!

1642
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:47,616
Uh-huh-h-h.

1643
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:49,451
Ohh!

1644
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:51,453
The police
were just checking,

1645
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:53,288
making sure
we're locking up at night.

1646
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,723
You know, they're keeping
the neighborhood safe!

1647
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:56,391
They're heroes!

1648
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:59,027
Okay. All taken care of.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1649
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:01,129
No, everyone's gone. Oh.
No, no.

1650
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:02,564
He's spinning out.

1651
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:05,968
I was really clear
my life was in danger.

1652
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:10,072
He called
the police anyway.

1653
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:12,274
Yeah.

1654
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,710
And since he did,
it's pretty clear

1655
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:17,245
that we're not gonna be
able to continue with the scam.

1656
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:20,882
$5 million
is nothing to him.

1657
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:23,285
But I guess it's worth
more to him than my life.

1658
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,454
Ooh. I don't...
Aw.

1659
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:27,055
I'm his son, for Christ's sake.

1660
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:28,557
Oh, boy.
We got a crier.
Yeah.

1661
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,925
Look how blue his eyes
get when he's crying.

1662
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:32,494
I'm sorry. This is
so fucking embarrassing.

1663
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:33,962
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No! Hey.

1664
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,131
Toilet paper here.
You can blow your nose.

1665
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,966
Look at this, okay?
Just because your dad
called the cops...

1666
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,135
Thank you.
...Doesn't mean
he doesn't love you.

1667
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,570
No, of course not!
Oh, my gosh.

1668
01:00:41,572 --> 01:00:42,971
Listen, I'm sure it was
just his first reaction.

1669
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,007
Absolutely. It's natural.
He's scared.

1670
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:46,408
He's confused.
Yeah.

1671
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,976
I mean, Dale's a dad, you know?
I'm a dad.

1672
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,412
Can you imagine if someone
stole just one of them?

1673
01:00:50,414 --> 01:00:51,647
No.
I can't even imagine.

1674
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:53,281
You would call the cops
immediately.

1675
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,017
No, I don't think
I'd call the cops.
You wouldn't?

1676
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:57,152
I couldn't take that risk.

1677
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,520
Ohh. No.
That's a different situation.
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, man.

1678
01:00:58,522 --> 01:00:59,955
Bad example.
That was a bad example.

1679
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,690
Maybe some alone time
would be the most helpful.

1680
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:04,126
Why don't we step outside
and give him a minute?
Yes.

1681
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:06,495
Right. Yeah. We'll come back.
And don't do anything rash.
We're just right outside here.

1682
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:08,130
Can I talk to you
outside, please?

1683
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:09,331
Oh, boy.

1684
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,532
Man, I feel terrible
for that guy.

1685
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:12,267
I know.
Are you kidding me?

1686
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:14,036
Poor, poor guy.
I mean, that is rough.
I know.

1687
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:15,370
Huh? Rough!
Yeah, that's a bummer.

1688
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:17,339
Are you guys
shitting me in there?

1689
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,607
Well, I mean, his dad
sold him out for, like...

1690
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:20,308
honestly, it was
probably nothing to him.

1691
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,510
Pennies to him.
The guy's so rich.

1692
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,278
That would rock me
to my core.

1693
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,113
I mean, have a<i> little</i> empathy,
Nick. Please?
Yeah.

1694
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:26,548
What are
you talking about?

1695
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,684
You're acting like
you have Stockholm syndrome.

1696
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,719
Yeah.
What is that?
What is that...
like jet lag?

1697
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:31,953
No.
Dude, do I look tired
to you?

1698
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:33,221
You don't, no.

1699
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:35,223
You don't look tired to me.
I'm fine.

1700
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:37,492
Yeah.
Stockholm syndrome is when you
bond with your captors, idiots.

1701
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:38,660
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh. Okay.

1702
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:39,728
Well,
then hold on a second.

1703
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,329
He's the hostage.
Yeah.

1704
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:42,831
So technically this would be
reverse Stockholm syndrome.

1705
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:45,467
Yeah, and we don't
have that, okay?
Yes. True.

1706
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:46,868
He's just a really,
really,

1707
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,503
really, really,
really likable guy.

1708
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:49,705
I like him a lot.
He's really likable.

1709
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:50,872
Cool.
The guy's a winner!

1710
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,374
You know,
that's so true.

1711
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,575
It's nice to be around
a winner for a change.

1712
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:55,477
Oh, boy.
It feels right, Nick.

1713
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:56,878
Come on, man.
Here's what
we're gonna do...

1714
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,513
we're gonna go in there,
we're gonna tell him

1715
01:01:58,515 --> 01:01:59,915
cops were never part
of this plan.

1716
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:02,851
And the shit ends now.
Let's do it.

1717
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:04,252
Come on.

1718
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:05,754
It was
a wonderful idea.

1719
01:02:05,756 --> 01:02:07,556
Didn't work out.

1720
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:10,192
So I think the best thing
to do is just to pull the plug,

1721
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:11,693
and you tell the police

1722
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:15,764
that the guys who got you
chickened out, let you go.

1723
01:02:15,766 --> 01:02:17,566
They're long gone.
They didn't<i> all</i>
chicken out.

1724
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:20,402
Now's not the time
to back off, boys.

1725
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:21,870
I say we chop off a toe,
mail it to him,

1726
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:23,905
and double the ransom.

1727
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,341
Now you're talking. Yes!
Chop, chop, chop!
Yes! Wait.<i> Whose</i> toe?

1728
01:02:26,343 --> 01:02:27,709
Not it. Not it.
Not my toe.

1729
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:29,711
No one's toe.
Keep your toes.

1730
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:31,213
Time to call it off.

1731
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:33,115
Nick! Nick!
Come on!

1732
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:35,117
Nick, look at me.
Oy.

1733
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,385
Look, man, if we give up now,
I'll be just fine.

1734
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:38,787
You know?
But you guys...

1735
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:40,222
Your employees,
for god's sake...

1736
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:42,424
Dale's little boys.
Girls, Kurt.

1737
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:43,859
Hey, thanks. Yes.
Yeah.

1738
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:45,227
...you're all fucked.

1739
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,628
Nick, come on, man.
Look, man.

1740
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,463
You can't just roll over
and die

1741
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:49,765
every time your back
is against the wall.

1742
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:50,966
That's right.
Don't roll over and die!

1743
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:52,400
Yeah,
you got to be careful.

1744
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:54,202
You have to take
what's yours in this...

1745
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:55,804
you have to take it!
Take what's yours!
Put your name on it!

1746
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:57,038
Write your fucking name on it
and say, "that's mine!"

1747
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,640
And take...
and take it.

1748
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:00,275
I think
I'll take it from here, okay?

1749
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,610
He's got it. He's got it.
He's got it.

1750
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:02,944
Listen, right here.
Listen to him, man.

1751
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,746
This is where you want it
to come from.

1752
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,148
Not us. We don't know.
Rex is...
I got it!!

1753
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,983
Yeah.
Sorry, Rex. Sorry.

1754
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:08,984
Sorry about that.
You got it, Rex.
He's got it.

1755
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:10,452
Come on, man.

1756
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,888
Help me help you
get revenge on my asshole dad

1757
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:16,124
and get you paid
a million bucks, cash!
Yes.

1758
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,425
Boy, it sounds awesome,

1759
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:20,328
but there's no way
to get it done.

1760
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,164
That's not true.
How about this thing?

1761
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:23,598
How about this? How about if
we just put our heads together?

1762
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,233
We brainstorm a little.

1763
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:28,069
If we don't come up with
a ransom plan that you love,

1764
01:03:28,071 --> 01:03:29,671
we pull the plug.

1765
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:32,107
Then you'd let us walk?
You have my word.

1766
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:35,310
But if we do come up
with something really inspired,

1767
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,579
then we're in it to win it.

1768
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:42,851
Well, I-I can't stop anybody
from brainstorming.

1769
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,422
Me and him...
like that.

1770
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:48,623
All right.

1771
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:50,759
I'll see you upstairs,
guys.

1772
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:55,330
¶ Now, there was a time ¶

1773
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,600
¶ when you loved me so ¶

1774
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:02,971
¶ I could have been wrong ¶

1775
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:07,843
¶ now you needed to know ¶

1776
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:12,814
¶ see, I've been a bad,
bad, bad, bad man ¶

1777
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:16,618
¶ and I'm in deep ¶

1778
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,186
¶ yeah ¶

1779
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:21,623
¶ I found a brand-new love
for this man ¶

1780
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,658
¶ and can't wait till you see ¶

1781
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,660
¶ I can't wait ¶

1782
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:29,064
¶ so, how you like me now? ¶

1783
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:30,866
¶ how you like me now? ¶

1784
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:32,367
¶ how you like me now? ¶

1785
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:35,370
¶ how you like me now? ¶

1786
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:36,805
¶ how you like me now? ¶

1787
01:04:40,811 --> 01:04:43,645
is "vagina"
with a "g" or a "j"?

1788
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:45,146
¶ How you like me now? ¶

1789
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:47,515
¶ how you like me now? ¶

1790
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:50,218
¶ how you like me now? ¶

1791
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,153
¶ how you like me now? ¶

1792
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:56,424
¶ how you like me n-o-o-ow? ¶

1793
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:58,426
all right.

1794
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:00,996
Let's run it down
from the top.

1795
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:02,430
Okay.
First, we tie up Rex

1796
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:05,166
in one of those abandoned
warehouses off 3rd.

1797
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:13,108
Then we call Bert
on a dark phone.

1798
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,743
It's prepaid
and untraceable.

1799
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:22,584
Go to the bench on the 4th
street bridge to make the drop.

1800
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:24,786
Not long enough
to trace the call.

1801
01:05:24,788 --> 01:05:27,022
God damn it!

1802
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:29,024
These guys are pros.

1803
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:31,459
I want a tracer
put in that bag.

1804
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:35,697
The police are sending everyone
they've got to watch the bridge.

1805
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,699
Weapons tight. Eyes on.

1806
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:39,768
All right.
Tactical command, red team.

1807
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:42,604
¶ And I felt the fire ¶

1808
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:46,041
¶ there was nothing
for me to do ¶

1809
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:49,577
here we go.

1810
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:53,748
But when he gets there,

1811
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,830
he finds the dark phone
that I planted ahead of time.

1812
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:01,923
Then we call him
from the second dark phone,

1813
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:03,325
and we tell him
to proceed downtown.

1814
01:06:03,327 --> 01:06:05,160
Hello?

1815
01:06:05,162 --> 01:06:07,595
You're gonna want to
pull into the garage

1816
01:06:07,597 --> 01:06:10,966
under the mandrake hotel
and park in space 4421.

1817
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:12,400
There, you will find
a red bag.

1818
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:14,602
You will transfer the money
into this bag,

1819
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:16,805
then drive out and await
the location of the drop.

1820
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,640
And we tell him
if anyone follows him in,

1821
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,075
his son's
a fucking corpse.

1822
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,946
¶ I am caught up
in your desire ¶

1823
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:27,148
¶ it's flush-in-the-face
desire ¶

1824
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,151
And when Burt drives
that far underground,

1825
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,153
the police will lose
the signal from his wire.

1826
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:38,193
But when he arrives,
instead of finding a bag,

1827
01:06:38,195 --> 01:06:41,629
he finds you three...
disguised, armed, dangerous.

1828
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:43,465
Yeah, but the gun's
not loaded, right?

1829
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:46,334
Of course not.
Nobody gets hurt. Come on.

1830
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:49,270
I then tell him to give me
his jacket and tie.

1831
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:58,113
So, just as the cops
are starting to sweat,

1832
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:00,115
dad pulls out
with the new red bag,

1833
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:02,017
just as he was instructed.

1834
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,651
Sir, we have
the signal back.

1835
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,053
Thank god.

1836
01:07:05,055 --> 01:07:07,489
Only it won't be
my father driving.

1837
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:10,358
It'll be our ringer.

1838
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,794
We're back on him, sir.
How do you know it's him?

1839
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:16,664
<i>I still have the cash,
and I'm heading to the drop.</i>

1840
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:19,300
I guess it's him.
Stay with him.

1841
01:07:19,302 --> 01:07:21,503
So, I drive
to the staples center.

1842
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:23,505
Kings have Vancouver.
Great matchup.

1843
01:07:23,507 --> 01:07:24,806
Place will be packed.

1844
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,843
The cops will stay
with the money

1845
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:30,845
and wait for the kidnappers
to receive the drop.

1846
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:33,481
Hanson made the drop.
Stay on the money.

1847
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:40,055
We got our man.
Take him down.

1848
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:46,761
- Stay down!
- Back it up!

1849
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:49,064
A lot of them, too.
Back it up, please.

1850
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:51,866
Son of a bitch!

1851
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:55,770
By the time the cops
know they've been had...

1852
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,774
...Kurt's a ghost.

1853
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:04,279
And Nick and Dale
disappear with the cash.

1854
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:12,420
And, finally, I am rescued
from my hellish captivity.

1855
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:15,457
Oh, thank you.
Where's my dad?

1856
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:17,092
Dad!

1857
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,628
And a week later,
once the smoke clears,

1858
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,064
we'll be sitting poolside,
splitting up the cash.

1859
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:25,867
It's raining!
Who wants it?!

1860
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:28,403
Yeah!
There's enough
to share!

1861
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,639
Look what came.
Who's thirsty?

1862
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:32,874
Who wants some Tequila?

1863
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:34,042
It's cash!
Thanks, babe.

1864
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:35,410
Hey, whoa! Dale!

1865
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:38,113
Get your goddamn kids
out of the fantasy.

1866
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:40,582
What? Let them enjoy the
pool and let them enjoy
the money, okay? Relax.

1867
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:41,983
They're not even allowed
at this pool. They should
be at the kids' pool.
That's right.

1868
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:43,418
I can't turn my mind off!
They're in my fantasy.

1869
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,253
Guys! Guys! Guys!
Will you stop it?!

1870
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:48,089
Come on!
Let's not argue, okay?

1871
01:08:48,091 --> 01:08:49,724
We came up
with an awesome plan.

1872
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:52,494
It is smart.
It is mad creative.

1873
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:54,496
You know, you boys
continue to impress me.

1874
01:08:54,498 --> 01:08:55,930
I'm proud of you.

1875
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:57,165
Thanks, man.

1876
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:58,266
You came up with most of it,
though.

1877
01:08:58,268 --> 01:08:59,601
I did not, Nick.
You did.

1878
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:01,603
That is a lie.
It was a team effort.

1879
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:03,104
You came up with that
whole going into the garage,

1880
01:09:03,106 --> 01:09:04,739
- losing the signal.
- Yeah, that was good.

1881
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:06,407
That was brilliant.
That was good.

1882
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:07,942
Kurty came up with
the dark phone business.

1883
01:09:07,944 --> 01:09:08,943
That's from
"Grand Theft Auto." I took it.

1884
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:10,111
Genius.
Yeah. Thank you.

1885
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:11,746
And Dale, uh...

1886
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:13,348
I had the thing
where you go on the zip line

1887
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,116
to the trampoline,
to the skateboard.

1888
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:16,751
Nick shot that down, though,
if you remember.

1889
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:18,686
Yeah.
It wasn't a good idea.

1890
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:20,522
It was a bad idea.
It really was.

1891
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:22,524
You had a lot of bad ideas,
though, that led to good ideas.

1892
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:24,159
And that is value.

1893
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:25,960
Thanks, man.

1894
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:28,429
All right, Nick.
Look, my word is still good.

1895
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:29,964
You know, if you...

1896
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:32,600
if you don't think
it can work, we call it off.

1897
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:36,437
It's up to you, buddy.

1898
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,873
Where do we get
some untraceable phones?

1899
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,508
There we go!
Yeah!

1900
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,943
That's our guy!
This guy!

1901
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:44,212
There we go!

1902
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:49,617
Prepaid with bitcoins.

1903
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:53,021
Jailbroken.
100% untraceable.

1904
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,623
We got it.
Thanks, man. Solid.
Thank you, motherfucker.

1905
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,493
Good luck out there, boys.

1906
01:09:58,495 --> 01:10:00,395
What's that laugh about?
Why are you...

1907
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:01,863
I just said, "good luck."

1908
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:03,164
No, that was a sinister giggle,
motherfucker.

1909
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:04,199
You said it with
a little sinister giggle.

1910
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:05,533
I'm not saying that.

1911
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:06,668
I'm just saying
that maybe you guys

1912
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,369
might want
a little advice.

1913
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:11,005
Boy, that was predictable.
No, thanks.
We're good.

1914
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:12,907
You know what, then?
Get the fuck on, then.

1915
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,375
Right, that's what I said.
"Get the fuck on." Let's go.

1916
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,377
Wait a minute. Hold on.
I don't like this.

1917
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,845
Now I want to hear
what he has to say.

1918
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:19,247
Oh, now you want hear?
You know some shit.

1919
01:10:19,249 --> 01:10:20,715
You got one on the hook.
Give it to him.

1920
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:22,917
It's gonna cost you
51% share of your company.

1921
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:25,186
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Come on.

1922
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:28,089
It's gonna cost you
2% share of your company.

1923
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:29,891
Yeah, whatever.
It's so weird
how you negotiate.

1924
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,659
It won't be in existence
tomorrow, probably.
You can have that.

1925
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:32,860
There's a middle ground.
I'd like my watch back,
though, too.

1926
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:36,497
Here's the advice,
young men...

1927
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:38,700
y'all criminals.

1928
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:41,102
It's never good advice, is it?
I can't find the advice
in that.

1929
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:42,537
It's not even true,
actually.
Exactly.

1930
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:44,906
We're not criminals.
We got dicked into this.

1931
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,774
Shut the fuck up!

1932
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:49,444
See, you can't have this
both ways.

1933
01:10:49,446 --> 01:10:50,878
Every time you guys
come in here, you're like,

1934
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,448
"oh, we're just a bunch
of happy-go-lucky guys.

1935
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,882
"You know, once again,
through no fault of our own,

1936
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:56,417
"we found ourselves
in another pickle,

1937
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:58,253
and we can't get our fingers
out of our asses."

1938
01:10:58,255 --> 01:10:59,687
Fuck that chicken shit!

1939
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:01,889
You're fucking criminals.

1940
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:03,925
You've tried to
kill your bosses.
One of them ended up dead.

1941
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:07,362
Now, you want to
perpetrate a kidnapping?

1942
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:08,896
You three
are the craziest

1943
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:11,933
motherfucking criminals
I've ever seen in my life.

1944
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:13,701
You want to
pull this shit off?

1945
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:16,271
You got to act like it.

1946
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:18,473
Word.

1947
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:19,741
¶ Unh ¶

1948
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:21,643
¶ unh ¶
¶ unh ¶

1949
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:23,578
¶ unh ¶
¶ come on ¶

1950
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,213
¶ ha,
sicker than your average ¶

1951
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:26,614
¶ poppa twist cabbage off ¶

1952
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,451
Oh,
that was embarrassing.

1953
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,987
We're trying to do
a super cool slow-mo walk, guy.

1954
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:34,555
Come on, man.
Easy.

1955
01:11:34,557 --> 01:11:36,557
No, no. It's over. Let's go.
Where you going, Nick?

1956
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:37,825
Moronic idea.
Come on, man.

1957
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:39,460
I am mortified.
Let's do the walk.

1958
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:40,895
You got to stick
with it.

1959
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,567
What do you think, Nick?

1960
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:48,403
Should I beat myself up
a little bit more?
No, no.

1961
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:49,737
No, no, no, no, no, you don't
need to hit yourself any more.

1962
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:51,272
I just think we should
just go ahead

1963
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:52,907
and just make the call,
all right?
Hold on,

1964
01:11:52,909 --> 01:11:54,809
before we kick this thing off,
could I just say something?

1965
01:11:54,811 --> 01:12:00,281
I'm not really good
at this kind of thing, you know?

1966
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:03,484
Um, my mom died when I was 4,
and, um...

1967
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,921
You know, when you're
raised by Bert hanson...

1968
01:12:06,923 --> 01:12:08,790
Most of your friends
are shitheads.

1969
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:12,627
Um, yeah, and I know
I dragged you guys into this,

1970
01:12:12,629 --> 01:12:14,295
but I-I'm not sorry.

1971
01:12:14,297 --> 01:12:19,100
Because... I'm really glad
I met you guys.

1972
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:22,503
Anyway, I want you guys
to have this.

1973
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,872
What is it?
It's an actual fang
from "predator."

1974
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:26,441
"Predator" the movie?
Yep.

1975
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:28,443
I want you to have it.
Here.

1976
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:30,211
For real?
Yeah. I swear to god.

1977
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:31,879
Do you like "predator"?

1978
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,514
Yeah,
I like "predator."

1979
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:34,849
Kurty?

1980
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,485
Yeah. Yeah,
I like "predator," too.

1981
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:40,655
I mean also,
not the sequel.

1982
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:42,290
Nick?
Oh, well...

1983
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:45,727
I didn't like "predator"
when I first saw it,

1984
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:48,730
but it grew on me
quite a bit.

1985
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:51,566
I like "predator"
a great deal.

1986
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,670
Are we talking about
him, or are we talking
about "predator"?

1987
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:57,071
I'm terrible
with metaphors.

1988
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:58,473
Let's just make
the phone call.

1989
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:00,641
It was lost on me.
Most things are.

1990
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,348
Yeah.

1991
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,850
Hey,
you got that sack of cash?

1992
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:10,752
Yeah, I got it.

1993
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:13,187
Yeah, now I want you to sashay
up to the 4th street bridge.

1994
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:15,156
You're gonna find a bench there
about halfway up,

1995
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:16,557
want you to take
a load off.

1996
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,393
And you bring the amount
that we agreed upon,

1997
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:19,894
and you come alone.

1998
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,329
And if you do,
you will find your son

1999
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:23,398
returned home
lickety-splickety.

2000
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:28,035
4th street bridge,
he's gonna have him
drop it over the side.

2001
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:29,837
Now, I want
every inch covered,

2002
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:32,440
but everyone holds
a safe distance.

2003
01:13:32,442 --> 01:13:34,675
Yeah, but not too safe
a distance. Understand?

2004
01:13:34,677 --> 01:13:37,578
This bag is your
number fucking one priority.

2005
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,748
No, actually, your son's life
is our number one priority.

2006
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,283
Yeah,
you know what I mean.

2007
01:13:42,285 --> 01:13:46,154
Yeah, I think I do.

2008
01:13:57,801 --> 01:13:59,567
Does anybody
have a visual?

2009
01:13:59,569 --> 01:14:02,270
Bridge is still clear,
chief.

2010
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:04,939
Hanson approaching.
Eta two minutes.

2011
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:09,977
The blade
is in position.

2012
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:12,914
Majestic, in position.

2013
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:16,317
I am in...

2014
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:18,920
Kill shot is in position.

2015
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:20,288
Whoa, "kill shot"?

2016
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,622
Yeah, I want to be
kill shot.

2017
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:23,758
Then you are kill shot, dude.
I love it.

2018
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,259
That's a pretty sweet name
there, Nick.

2019
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:26,594
Oh, easy, easy.
We don't want to use real names

2020
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:28,296
if we're
using code names, Dale.

2021
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:30,298
Don't say my name
either, Kurt.
Mine was an accident.

2022
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,933
Yours was clearly
on purpose there.

2023
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:33,100
I'm sorry.
I don't think yours
was an accident.

2024
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,169
What are
you talking about?!

2025
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:36,604
You know,
why are we on walkie-talkies?
We're in the same room? Come on.

2026
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:37,839
We're checking
the equipment.

2027
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:39,240
We don't need to
check the equipment.

2028
01:14:39,242 --> 01:14:40,675
He's on
a TV remote control!

2029
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:41,776
You know, I mean,
I was trying to participate.

2030
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:43,444
I didn't
have anything to...

2031
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:45,112
hey! Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho!
Hold up. Blade's got a visual.

2032
01:14:45,114 --> 01:14:46,481
He's here. He's here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2033
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,015
Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

2034
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:49,283
Oh, shit. All right.
Kill shot, make the call.

2035
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:53,421
I'm dialing. Here we go.
Oh, my god.

2036
01:14:53,423 --> 01:14:54,622
Hey, what's that?

2037
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:55,756
Who's calling you?

2038
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:57,158
I don't know.
It's blocked.

2039
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,160
Oh, no.

2040
01:14:58,161 --> 01:14:59,794
Hello.
Hi.

2041
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:02,530
Who is this?
It's me, dickless!

2042
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:04,599
Hey, what're you doing?
You're supposed to
call the dark phone.

2043
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:06,100
I did!
You've got it in your hand.

2044
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:07,435
You were supposed to tape
that under the bench.

2045
01:15:07,437 --> 01:15:09,670
No, that's not...
I... oh, wait.

2046
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:17,545

Oh!

2050
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,387
Oh, shit!
So, what phone does he have?!

2051
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:27,688
Bert has Kurt's phone,

2052
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,790
with our contact information
on it.

2053
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:31,192
And all the pictures of us from
when we used to be friends?

2054
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,793
Are you kidding me?!
Easy, easy, easy.

2055
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:34,795
Knock it off! Okay, look, this
is no big deal, all right?

2056
01:15:34,797 --> 01:15:36,330
We'll just punt.
We'll do it tomorrow.

2057
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:37,732
All right? I mean, as long as
we don't call the phone,

2058
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:39,534
- he'll never find it.
- He found it.

2059
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:40,968
He... what?! How?! Shit.
We are screwed.

2060
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,803
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I got an idea.

2061
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:43,905
I got an idea.
Okay, call your phone.

2062
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:46,007
If he's talking on it,

2063
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:48,009
he's not gonna look through it
and see all the contacts.
That's a great idea.

2064
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:49,571
Here we go, here we go.
Okay. All right.

2065
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,713

These guys are confident.

2068
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,588
Yeah, hello.

2069
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:02,256
Well, look like the grasshopper

2070
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:04,492
found himself a blade of grass
to sit upon!
Too much.

2071
01:16:04,494 --> 01:16:06,027
Hello!

2072
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:08,229
Let's get this over with,
pretend cowboy.

2073
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:10,364
Yeah, now, listen.
I need you to proceed

2074
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:11,666
to the mandrake hotel.

2075
01:16:11,668 --> 01:16:13,067
I need you to go underground
into parking.

2076
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,336
I need you
to get to spot 4421.

2077
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:16,437
You're gonna see a big,
ol' bag there.

2078
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:18,005
Fill it up
with that money!

2079
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:20,675
And then I need you
to proceed north onto figueroa

2080
01:16:20,677 --> 01:16:22,443
and await
further instructions.

2081
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:24,111
W-wait, wait,
wait, wait.

2082
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:26,113
And don't think that we don't
know you got the law with you,

2083
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:27,915
'cause that's something
that we<i> do</i> know!

2084
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,517
All right?

2085
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:30,918
So if any of them cavalry
follow you down in the garage?

2086
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,253
I'm personally
gonna stick

2087
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:34,455
a hot poker
so far up your son's ass,

2088
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:38,559
I'm-a pop his teeth
like popcorn!

2089
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:40,695
See? We're back on track.

2090
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:42,363
Hey, guys,
with game-time traffic,

2091
01:16:42,365 --> 01:16:44,265
he could be here
in less than 10 minutes.

2092
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:45,900
How we doing, Kurt?
Almost done.

2093
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:47,068
Where are
the bellhop costumes?

2094
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,270
The what?
The bellhop costumes.

2095
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,371
Aren't we dressed
as bellhops

2096
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:52,740
when we escape
with the money? Like,
we come out of the hotel...

2097
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:54,241
what are you talking about?
This place doesn't even
have bellhops. No.
It doesn't?

2098
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:55,876
I thought there was supposed
to be some sweet-ass...

2099
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:57,144
no, there's no
bellhop costumes in there.

2100
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:59,046
What the fuck are these,
man?

2101
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:00,448
It's not Halloween time.
It's the best I could
do on short notice.

2102
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:01,916
It's not scary.
Don't make fun.

2103
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:03,150
Hey, guys,
how do I look?

2104
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:05,252
Who the hell are you?
It's me, Kurt.

2105
01:17:05,254 --> 01:17:06,754
I know that part.
That looks terrible.

2106
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:08,990
You don't look like Bert,
you look like mark twain.

2107
01:17:08,992 --> 01:17:10,591
Guys, none of this is
like I pictured it when
we were planning it.

2108
01:17:10,593 --> 01:17:11,892
Everything was so much cooler.
No, it'll be fine.

2109
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:13,227
No, it will be good.

2110
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:14,495
It just has to look good
from a distance.

2111
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:16,597
You're driving by.
It's nighttime.

2112
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:17,965
Here we go. Let's do it.
Let's roll. Let's roll.
Let's go. Let's go!

2113
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,400
All right. Let's just do
what we got to do,

2114
01:17:19,402 --> 01:17:21,302
do it confidently
and we should be fine.

2115
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:22,336
Here we go.

2116
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:24,305
Oh!
Hi, boys.

2117
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:25,673
Oh, hi.

2118
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:27,074
You... you staying
at the hotel, or...

2119
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:29,110
is this your hotel?
Are you staying here?

2120
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:31,512
I've been
keeping my eye on you

2121
01:17:31,514 --> 01:17:33,280
since you
broke into my office.

2122
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:35,149
I don't know
what's going on here,

2123
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,984
and I don't give a shit.

2124
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,786
Julia, why are you here?
What do you want?

2125
01:17:38,788 --> 01:17:40,621
I think you know
what I want.

2126
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:42,323
No, I-I-I'm not gonna
sleep with you.

2127
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,358
Why... why can't this crazy
bitch get it through her head?

2128
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,760
I'm not sleeping
with the woman.

2129
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:47,094
Hey. Keep it respectful.
Sorry about that.

2130
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:48,929
Are you kidding me?
Don't call her that.

2131
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:50,865
All right, look. I'm gonna
make this really simple.

2132
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:52,366
I'm gonna call
the police, and I'm
gonna send you all to jail.

2133
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:53,668
Don't do that.
Whoa, whoa. Come on.

2134
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,603
Unless Dale plows me.

2135
01:17:55,605 --> 01:17:58,606
Why?! Why me?!
What is so special about me?

2136
01:17:58,608 --> 01:18:02,109
That's a fair question.
Everybody's wondering.
I am.

2137
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:03,844
Did you ever
collect anything, Dale?

2138
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,279
Boy, don't get him
going on this.

2139
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:07,048
What do I collect?
Tons of stuff.

2140
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,449
"Encyclopedia brown"?

2141
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:09,550
Like, new beanie babies,
which makes no sense.

2142
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:11,018
"Battlestar Galactica."

2143
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,486
All right, fine.
I collect some stuff. Why?

2144
01:18:12,488 --> 01:18:14,221
Okay, well,
I collect cocks.

2145
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:15,356
Cogs?
Julia.

2146
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:17,692
"Cocks."
Oh, yeah. Well...

2147
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:19,527
Mm-hmm.
Right up here.

2148
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:24,498
I've got quite an impressive
trophy room filled with cocks.

2149
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,800
We're in there.
Don't.

2150
01:18:25,802 --> 01:18:27,902
And at night,
when I close my eyes,

2151
01:18:27,904 --> 01:18:29,870
I reflect on them.

2152
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,139
I alphabetize them.

2153
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,908
I dust them.

2154
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,710
Why are they dusty?

2155
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:37,078
But there's one
little problem, Dale.

2156
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,847
See that space,

2157
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:42,683
that empty space,
above the fireplace?

2158
01:18:42,685 --> 01:18:43,884
See that?

2159
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,252
You got
a cock missing?

2160
01:18:45,254 --> 01:18:47,521
That's reserved
for the only man

2161
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:50,257
who's ever said no
to this.

2162
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:54,729
That's you, Dale.
My white whale.

2163
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,163
Please, no. Timeout.
Julia, I think we all know

2164
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:58,232
this is just
the addiction talking.

2165
01:18:58,234 --> 01:18:59,834
And if you're looking
for something more than
just a quick fix,

2166
01:18:59,836 --> 01:19:01,402
I can provide you
something

2167
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:02,603
that's very meaningful,
something long-lasting.

2168
01:19:02,605 --> 01:19:04,772
What?
What're you talking about?

2169
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:06,273
I'm talking about
us. You know what
I'm talking about.

2170
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:07,775
Us? All of us?

2171
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:09,009
No.
That's even better.

2172
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:10,177
No.
More the merrier!

2173
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:11,612
Julia.
I love this idea.

2174
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:13,247
You guys got a lot of stuff
sticking out.

2175
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,615
I got a lot of holes
going in.

2176
01:19:14,617 --> 01:19:16,717
Just,
at one point of the night,

2177
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,586
you'd better make sure that
that one is in this one.

2178
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:21,388
Thank you. Ooh. Ohh!
That's not what I meant,
you misunderstood.

2179
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,057
All right,
I'm gonna go freshen up.

2180
01:19:23,059 --> 01:19:25,099
Why don't you guys suck
each other off to get ready?

2181
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:28,129
All right, here we go.
What are you doing?

2182
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:29,864
What do you mean?
She's making us fuck her.

2183
01:19:29,866 --> 01:19:31,732
Well, I'm not gonna
fuck anyone.
Thank you.

2184
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:33,400
Okay, I am willing
to make love to her,

2185
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:35,236
if that is
what is required here.
Are you serious?

2186
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:36,637
Uh,
can I borrow this razor?

2187
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:38,205
Yeah. Go nuts.

2188
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:40,541
Any requests?
Landing strip? Dinner roll?

2189
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,943
Uh, whatever's there.
We're in a rush. Thanks.

2190
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,880
Hmm.
Look, I-I don't want to commit
adultery on my wife. I'm sorry.

2191
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:47,782
No, no, no. No, it's not
adultery if you're doing
it to save your family.

2192
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,383
True.
Okay?

2193
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:50,584
I mean, do you really think
Stacy and your little girls

2194
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:52,219
are gonna
wait around for you

2195
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:53,621
while you're in prison
for 30 years?

2196
01:19:53,623 --> 01:19:54,989
They're not.
Can't we just, like,

2197
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:57,591
come up with
some kind of plan, though?

2198
01:19:57,593 --> 01:19:59,794
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
I got a plan. Okay, here we go.

2199
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:02,663
Um, areas. Um, I'll go...
Butt, face, puss.

2200
01:20:02,665 --> 01:20:04,665
I cannot go in the puss. That's
gonna make me the most guilty.

2201
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:07,334
No, good call. Good call.
Okay, how about this...

2202
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:09,103
how about, uh,
butt, face, puss? Yeah?
That's where I should be.

2203
01:20:09,105 --> 01:20:10,304
No, I'm trying to talk about
a way where I don't ha...

2204
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:11,939
wait, that's actually good.
Right?

2205
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:13,607
Because maybe if we're switching
positions constantly,

2206
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:15,509
she'll lose track
of who's where.
Like a shell game.

2207
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:17,244
Yeah, like a shell game.
Right, right.
Three-card monte. Exactly.

2208
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:18,846
Okay, and then I can just,
like, motorboat her boobies,

2209
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:19,980
right, and then like,
you know, smack on her butt.

2210
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,515
So long as
nothing is done

2211
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:22,650
in a cheap
or degrading way.
Of course not.

2212
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:24,418
We'll be as sensitive
as Dr. Phil.

2213
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,320
I don't know
if I can fuck this woman.
Yes, you can.

2214
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,855
Just think about your wife
and your girls, all right?
That's true.

2215
01:20:27,857 --> 01:20:29,023
Yeah, right, I'll think
about my little girls.

2216
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:30,025
I can get it done.

2217
01:20:30,026 --> 01:20:32,793
All right?

2218
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:34,361
Stacy!
Oh, no.

2219
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:36,330
Hey, how did you
find me here?
Been there awhile?

2220
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,299
Find my iPhone!

2221
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:39,500
Ohh!

2222
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:41,535
I knew you
were cheating on me.

2223
01:20:41,537 --> 01:20:43,103
No, I'm not though.
He's not. We're just trying
to stay out of prison.

2224
01:20:43,105 --> 01:20:44,772
Prison?

2225
01:20:44,774 --> 01:20:46,373
No, no one's going to prison.
No, no, of course not.

2226
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,642
'Cause we're gonna
kidnap someone.
Kidnapping?!

2227
01:20:48,644 --> 01:20:51,111
No! Okay, first of all,
the man kidnapped himself.
That's exactly right.

2228
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:52,646
And he forced us.

2229
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:54,615
Dale wouldn't even
do the puss.

2230
01:20:54,617 --> 01:20:55,883
I didn't even
want to do the puss!
I chose ass both times.

2231
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:58,552
I said puss is make me
the most guilty.

2232
01:20:58,554 --> 01:21:00,187
Wait! Shut up! You're not
helping me! Shut up!

2233
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,022
Okay, look, uh, this is such
a stupid thing, honey.

2234
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:04,024
And easy, and nothing sexual
is even happening here.

2235
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,526
- Nothing.
- Come on, Dale,

2236
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,895
this pussy
isn't gonna eat itself.

2237
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:10,130
Julia?
Stacy!

2238
01:21:10,132 --> 01:21:11,832
Listen to me
for one second.
You are sick!

2239
01:21:11,834 --> 01:21:13,067
I'm not sick! Please!
Do not follow me!

2240
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:14,401
Can I just explain...

2241
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:17,137
do not follow me!
No! You fucking bitch.

2242
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:20,474
Sorry. Really didn't mean
for that to happen.

2243
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:23,043
Okay, Julia.
You want to fuck?

2244
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:24,511
Yeah.

2245
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:26,080
Why not, right?
You know?

2246
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:27,681
My marriage is over.
It's basically ruined.

2247
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:29,884
So how about I ruin that pussy?
That sound good?

2248
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,553
What? No, no, no, no.
You're face.
I'm puss.

2249
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:33,921
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no.
This one's all mine.

2250
01:21:33,923 --> 01:21:35,222
What?
Let's do it, baby.

2251
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,657
Let's do it in the shower,
huh?

2252
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:38,392
Thataboy.
Is that what you want?

2253
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:42,229
Nice and wet in here.

2254
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:43,664
All right, boys.

2255
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:45,199
I can't save my marriage
from prison, right?

2256
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:46,401
No, you can't.
No. Great, Dale.

2257
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,801
Let's roll.

2258
01:21:53,276 --> 01:21:55,209
We lost the wire.
Shit.

2259
01:21:55,211 --> 01:21:56,510
Should we send in
an unmarked?

2260
01:21:56,512 --> 01:22:00,547
We can't risk it.
We'll hold here.

2261
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,231
Hello! Howdy do!

2262
01:22:17,233 --> 01:22:18,632
Go on that side.
Stop it.

2263
01:22:18,634 --> 01:22:20,401
Hey!

2264
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:21,869
What the fuck
is this?

2265
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:23,404
I do not need
that sass-mouth.

2266
01:22:23,406 --> 01:22:25,072
What I need is
that sack of cash.

2267
01:22:25,074 --> 01:22:26,807
Now get it over here.

2268
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:29,076
Don't you throw it at me.
You slide it.

2269
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:31,946
Do it again.
No, we'll keep it here.
Check it.

2270
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,150
Holy shit!

2271
01:22:36,152 --> 01:22:38,052
Looky there.
We did it.

2272
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:39,887
There's a pretty bag.
Okay. All right. Hey!

2273
01:22:39,889 --> 01:22:42,456
I'll also take that damn
mobile telephone you took from

2274
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,325
the under bottom
of that park bench.

2275
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:45,626
What?

2276
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:47,761
The cell phone!
Give me the cell phone.

2277
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:49,463
Throw the phone
over to him.

2278
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,732
Now that fancy jacket
and that snappy tie.

2279
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:53,734
Get them off.
Get them over.
No.

2280
01:22:53,736 --> 01:22:55,569
He say "no"?
I think he said "no."

2281
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:58,172
But we got this.
don't you make me use
this six shooter.

2282
01:22:58,174 --> 01:22:59,573
Man's got a shooter,
now.

2283
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:01,575
You make me sick.

2284
01:23:01,577 --> 01:23:02,977
You're what's wrong
with America.

2285
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:04,244
Everyone just wants
a handout.

2286
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:06,080
Take, take,
take from the people

2287
01:23:06,082 --> 01:23:08,015
who earn their money
honestly.

2288
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:09,650
All right,
let's not chitchat now.

2289
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,919
The man does have a gun.
You got a real lip on you.

2290
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:13,921
I will shoot you
in the chest.

2291
01:23:13,923 --> 01:23:15,756
Well, go ahead.
Shoot me.

2292
01:23:15,758 --> 01:23:17,791
You don't
have the balls.

2293
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:19,593
Yeah, he does!
He got big ol' balls!

2294
01:23:19,595 --> 01:23:21,495
Big mouth.
Nothing behind it.

2295
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:25,032
- Dude!
- Oh, my god.

2296
01:23:25,034 --> 01:23:26,467
What the fuck?!
Oh, my god!

2297
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:28,268
What did you do?!
Oh, my god!

2298
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,970
You shot him!
No, I didn't!

2299
01:23:29,972 --> 01:23:32,106
Yes, you did!
That was not supposed
to be loaded!

2300
01:23:32,108 --> 01:23:34,375
What do you mean
you didn't do it?!
That's not my fault!

2301
01:23:34,377 --> 01:23:36,377
Oh, my god!
Wait, hold...

2302
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:48,555
Man, you should've seen
your faces right now

2303
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:50,991
when you started
blaming each other.

2304
01:23:52,228 --> 01:23:54,895
What's happening
right now?

2305
01:23:54,897 --> 01:23:56,964
I'm fucking you over.

2306
01:23:56,966 --> 01:23:59,366
No, no. But we're...
but we're all friends now.

2307
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,001
You know, we are,
but what a great twist, right?

2308
01:24:01,003 --> 01:24:03,904
I mean, at first I-I was just
gonna take all the money

2309
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:05,139
and throw you guys
under the bus.

2310
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:06,540
Right?
I mean, come on, duh.

2311
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,375
But then when dad
called the cops

2312
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:10,137
and proved he doesn't give
a fuck about me...

2313
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:13,714
...I realized... why just take
a few of his millions

2314
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:15,249
when I can inherit
all of them?

2315
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:16,850
And you guys could
take the fall for it, right?

2316
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:19,219
Because in minutes
the police will be down here,

2317
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,422
and discover that you three
killed my poor father

2318
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:22,856
with a gun that you stole
from my room

2319
01:24:22,858 --> 01:24:24,324
when you abducted me.

2320
01:24:24,326 --> 01:24:26,760
That is a lie!

2321
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:28,996
He knows.
He knows.

2322
01:24:28,998 --> 01:24:31,832
He knows.
Don't worry, guys.

2323
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:33,901
I'll take it from here.

2324
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:36,737
Sorry, Rex.
But we gotcha.

2325
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:38,172
<i>Why just take
a few of his millions</i>

2326
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:39,606
<i>when I can inherit
all of them?</i>

2327
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:41,175
<i>And you guys can take
the fall for it.</i>

2328
01:24:41,177 --> 01:24:44,578
Ooh, checkmate, bitch.

2329
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,216
All right, here.
Let's have that.

2330
01:24:49,218 --> 01:24:52,419
Yeah. Yeah.
No. Right. Sorry.
Thanks, man.

2331
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:55,622
Didn't want to hold on to that
for two more minutes?

2332
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:57,724
Naw, that was a gift.

2333
01:24:57,726 --> 01:25:00,094
Nick, did you park the prius
in the back alley?

2334
01:25:00,096 --> 01:25:01,528
I sure did, Rex.
Do you have the keys?

2335
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:03,964
Here you go.

2336
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:10,571
I'm really proud of you guys.
I mean, seriously.

2337
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:13,307
You pulled together.
You work like a team.
Just like we planned.

2338
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:20,047
I'm...
I'm gonna miss you guys.

2339
01:25:20,049 --> 01:25:22,449
Okay. Bye.

2340
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:23,784
Catch!

2341
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:25,085
Don't...
god damn it.
Oh, shit.

2342
01:25:25,087 --> 01:25:26,620
I'm sorry.
I just have good hands.

2343
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:27,988
Fuck. Wait.
Hang on a second.

2344
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,423
Hey, freeze!
Freeze!

2345
01:25:29,425 --> 01:25:30,757
Dale, come on.

2346
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:32,493
You think I'd give you
a loaded gun?

2347
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:35,462
Ah, shit.

2348
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,164
Guys, seriously,
I got to get going.

2349
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:38,265
I got to wait to be saved
at the warehouse by the cops.

2350
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:39,366
See ya.

2351
01:25:41,003 --> 01:25:42,803
Oh, shit. Good luck
talking to the cops.

2352
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:45,005
You have your dad's blood
all over your... ohh!

2353
01:25:45,007 --> 01:25:47,774
Can we not keep<i> anything</i>
to ourselves?
Fuck me!

2354
01:25:47,776 --> 01:25:49,676
I'm so sorry.
That's much worse
than what I did.

2355
01:25:49,678 --> 01:25:51,512
What did I do?!
You're friends with him.

2356
01:25:51,514 --> 01:25:52,679
You introduced me to him.

2357
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:53,981
We're not gonna
be afraid of

2358
01:25:53,983 --> 01:25:55,415
an unloaded gun, Rex,
you dipshit.

2359
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:57,518
He's got bullets.
He's got bullets.

2360
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,020
He's got bullets?
Fucking hell!

2361
01:26:00,022 --> 01:26:02,089
Kurt, what are you?
A 32 waist?

2362
01:26:02,091 --> 01:26:04,091
Oh, dear god.
He's gonna rape us.

2363
01:26:04,093 --> 01:26:05,492
No.
Oh, you just want my p...

2364
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:06,493
oh, he just wants
the pants.

2365
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:10,130
That's great.

2366
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:15,536
All time shittiest idea
you guys have ever fucking had.
Oh, my god.

2367
01:26:15,538 --> 01:26:17,538
I can't believe
you talked me into this.

2368
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:20,307
This guy's dead now!
I know that!

2369
01:26:20,309 --> 01:26:22,476
He's fucking dead!
We should have stayed
cogs in the wheel.

2370
01:26:22,478 --> 01:26:25,679
This is taking
too damn long.

2371
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:29,516
Shit.
This isn't about the bag.

2372
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:31,518
This is
the goddamn drop.

2373
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,189
Move in.
Everybody move in now.

2374
01:26:35,191 --> 01:26:37,824
Please take off the
incriminating pants, Kurt.

2375
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:39,159
Well, what are
you talking about?

2376
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:40,527
Run around in
my fucking underwear? Come on.

2377
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,162
Why don't we just throw
the body in the trunk?

2378
01:26:42,164 --> 01:26:45,132
We got 5 million bucks cash.
There's police everywhere!

2379
01:26:45,134 --> 01:26:47,000
We're not gonna get away
with it! Oh, shit!

2380
01:26:50,139 --> 01:26:53,640
Grab the bag.
Get the fuck in.

2381
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:56,043
Why?
We're gonna lead the cops
to that warehouse

2382
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:57,544
before your boy
gets there.

2383
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:00,547
If they see him out
walking free,

2384
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,683
they just might
believe your ass. Let's go!

2385
01:27:02,685 --> 01:27:04,818
Get the money.

2386
01:27:10,192 --> 01:27:11,592
¶ Straight out of Compton ¶

2387
01:27:11,594 --> 01:27:13,660
¶ crazy motherfucker
named ice cube ¶

2388
01:27:13,662 --> 01:27:15,862
¶ from the gang called
niggaz with attitudes ¶

2389
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:18,398
¶ when I'm called off,
I got a sawed off ¶

2390
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,201
hey! Hey, guys!
¶ squeeze the trigger,
and bodies are hauled off ¶

2391
01:27:21,203 --> 01:27:23,403
goddamn it.
It's those idiots.

2392
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:25,272
Come on! Let's go!

2393
01:27:25,274 --> 01:27:27,274
I'm pretty sure following
us is already a part
of their plan, Kurt.

2394
01:27:27,276 --> 01:27:28,842
You never know.
You want to make sure, right?

2395
01:27:28,844 --> 01:27:30,611
What is the seat belt
situation in here?

2396
01:27:30,613 --> 01:27:31,878
I got mine.
Good idea.
We should put them on.

2397
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,181
Guys, can I get one?
Can I get under one?

2398
01:27:34,183 --> 01:27:35,716
Just hold on
to the dashboard.

2399
01:27:35,718 --> 01:27:38,619
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
No, this is the wrong way.

2400
01:27:38,621 --> 01:27:41,221
This is the wrong way!
Turn around! Stop the car!

2401
01:27:41,223 --> 01:27:43,924
Who the fuck you texting?
I'm texting my lady.

2402
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:45,926
Put it down!
If I don't check in,
she goes crazy.

2403
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:47,761
Are you serious?!
Be careful. Careful.

2404
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:54,101
By the way, what the hell
were you doing back there

2405
01:27:54,103 --> 01:27:57,537
in that garage
in the first place?

2406
01:27:57,539 --> 01:27:59,206
What's that, now?

2407
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:00,641
Holy shit.
What's going on?

2408
01:28:00,643 --> 01:28:03,110
You were down there
to steal the ransom money,

2409
01:28:03,112 --> 01:28:04,544
weren't you?
Listen, I hustle,
I don't steal.

2410
01:28:04,546 --> 01:28:06,046
What the fuck does that...

2411
01:28:06,048 --> 01:28:08,115
what were you doing
in the garage, motherfucker?

2412
01:28:09,752 --> 01:28:10,984
All right, look, I was thinking
there was a chance

2413
01:28:10,986 --> 01:28:12,419
that your drop
might go south

2414
01:28:12,421 --> 01:28:13,487
and that guy would kill
all three of y'all.

2415
01:28:13,489 --> 01:28:14,921
And in such a scenario,

2416
01:28:14,923 --> 01:28:16,923
you'd rather me have the cash
than him.

2417
01:28:16,925 --> 01:28:18,325
A very big assumption.

2418
01:28:18,327 --> 01:28:19,760
He was betting against us.
You motherfucker!

2419
01:28:19,762 --> 01:28:22,596
I was honoring
your potential death.

2420
01:28:22,598 --> 01:28:25,265
Honoring us!
What are we, samurai?

2421
01:28:25,267 --> 01:28:27,934
Wait, hold on.
Oh, oh, hey! Train!

2422
01:28:27,936 --> 01:28:29,816
Train! Train, train!
Train! Train! Train! Train!

2423
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:37,110
Nice! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

2424
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:39,413
That's how you lose the cops!
That's how you lose the cops!

2425
01:28:39,415 --> 01:28:41,782
We're not supposed
to lose the cops.
don't lose the cops!

2426
01:28:43,185 --> 01:28:44,985
That's the whole idea.

2427
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:46,687
It was a good thought.
We're going back now.

2428
01:28:46,689 --> 01:28:48,121
This is great.
I really wish
you'd just slow down.

2429
01:28:48,123 --> 01:28:49,623
You wouldn't make mistakes
like that.

2430
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:53,126
Don't criticize the man.
He's doing the best he can.

2431
01:28:53,128 --> 01:28:56,196
Here, I'll let them know.
Hold on.

2432
01:28:56,198 --> 01:28:57,698
Hey! We're back!

2433
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:01,134
We'll stay here
till all this shit goes by.

2434
01:29:01,136 --> 01:29:02,869
Then we'll all roll.

2435
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:06,039
What the fuck
are these assholes doing?

2436
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:08,375
They get that?
Yeah, I think so.
I think they're good.

2437
01:29:08,377 --> 01:29:10,844
What is that shit you're
carrying around back there?
Hey, yeah. What is that?

2438
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,446
It's for my kitties.

2439
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,947
Oh, yeah.
You got kittens, huh?
Surprising.

2440
01:29:13,949 --> 01:29:15,315
What the fuck,
I can't have kittens?

2441
01:29:15,317 --> 01:29:17,317
What? Why are you always
jumping on everything?

2442
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:20,187
It's just weird you're
hauling around a cat stand, man.
I love pussy.

2443
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:21,722
Hey, can I hop out
and piss really quick?

2444
01:29:21,724 --> 01:29:23,290
No, you cannot.
We're in a car Chase.

2445
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:24,891
Super long train.
I feel like I could get it done.

2446
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:26,827
It is
a lot of freight.

2447
01:29:29,665 --> 01:29:32,165
¶<i> It's not in the way you look</i> ¶

2448
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:35,202
¶<i> or the things</i>
<i>that you say that you do</i> ¶

2449
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:37,637
¶<i> hold the line</i> ¶
eh... It probably needs...

2450
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:39,639
Eh... Mm.
¶<i> love isn't always on time</i> ¶

2451
01:29:41,343 --> 01:29:42,743
Aah!
¶<i> oh, oh, whoa, whoa</i> ¶

2452
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:45,645
¶<i> hold the line</i> ¶

2453
01:29:45,647 --> 01:29:49,549
It's just too goddamn easy.

2454
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:27,587
I feel like
I could've pissed by now.
Let him go.

2455
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:30,457
Open the door. Get him out.
Caboose coming.

2456
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:33,760
Ah, shit!

2457
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:48,475
Oh, shit. Cops!

2458
01:30:48,477 --> 01:30:50,844
Cops. Cops! Cops!
Shit!
Cops, cops, cops!

2459
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:55,215
What happened?
Ah, you lost your stuff.

2460
01:30:55,217 --> 01:30:58,218
You lost your cat stuff.
Yeah, you lost your cat stuff.
What?! Damn it!

2461
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:01,888
Okay, there's a man there.
Watch out for him.

2462
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,123
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

2463
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,326
Hey, we're boxed in here!
Ooh!

2464
01:31:06,328 --> 01:31:07,828
Not for long.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2465
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:09,963
I've always wanted
to do this!
Aah!

2466
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:14,401
¶<i> We've got to,</i>
<i>we've got to make it last</i> ¶

2467
01:31:14,403 --> 01:31:16,403
¶ I touch you once ¶
¶<i> I touch you once</i> ¶

2468
01:31:16,405 --> 01:31:18,972
¶ I touch you twice ¶
¶<i> I touch you twice</i> ¶

2469
01:31:29,585 --> 01:31:33,320
Shit.

2470
01:31:40,095 --> 01:31:41,928
What?

2471
01:31:45,634 --> 01:31:47,200
So where's this place?

2472
01:31:47,202 --> 01:31:50,136
It's up here,
under the bridge.

2473
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:53,173
Hey, what're you doing?!
No, you're supposed
to go<i> under</i> the bridge.

2474
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:55,342
Relax.

2475
01:31:57,946 --> 01:32:00,447
The wheels are locked.
Pump the brakes or something.

2476
01:32:00,449 --> 01:32:02,482
Yeah, yeah.
Shift down.

2477
01:32:02,484 --> 01:32:04,985
Put it in park!
I can't think!

2478
01:32:04,987 --> 01:32:06,953
No, no, no, no!
No! No! No!

2479
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,299
Oh, fuck!

2480
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:20,967
I'm gonna puke.

2481
01:32:20,969 --> 01:32:23,049
Well, what's the next part
of the plan, motherfucker?

2482
01:32:36,685 --> 01:32:40,053
There! There!
There! There! There!

2483
01:32:51,366 --> 01:32:52,699
Hey!
Hey, he's not here.

2484
01:32:52,701 --> 01:32:53,934
We beat him!
What?

2485
01:32:53,936 --> 01:32:55,235
We beat him!
Hey!

2486
01:32:55,237 --> 01:32:56,870
Hey! Nice job!

2487
01:32:56,872 --> 01:32:58,271
Where's motherfucker?

2488
01:32:58,273 --> 01:33:00,774
I don't know.

2489
01:33:00,776 --> 01:33:02,075
Cops. Cops.

2490
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:09,349
Hey!

2491
01:33:09,351 --> 01:33:11,685
Get out of the car.
Put your hands up!

2492
01:33:11,687 --> 01:33:14,854
Just relax.
Please, put your guns down.
Okay?

2493
01:33:14,856 --> 01:33:17,223
All right, we didn't
kill anybody. I swear to god.

2494
01:33:17,225 --> 01:33:20,093
I don't give a god damn.
You tell it to the judge.

2495
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,795
We didn't kidnap
anybody, either.
The guy kidnapped himself.

2496
01:33:21,797 --> 01:33:23,697
He's gonna be sneaking
in here any second. You'll see.

2497
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:24,898
Yeah, hey, he was supposed to
be tied up to that
chair right there.

2498
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,566
That's right.
Right behind you.

2499
01:33:26,568 --> 01:33:29,402
Who? Him?

2500
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:31,037
Yeah!
Oh, that looks bad.

2501
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:32,973
That looks bad.

2502
01:33:32,975 --> 01:33:35,475
This fucking guy!
You got to believe us.

2503
01:33:35,477 --> 01:33:37,444
That's them! Those three,
they... they...

2504
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:39,479
th-they tortured me, and
then th-they said they
were gonna kill my dad.

2505
01:33:39,481 --> 01:33:40,647
Oh, don't listen
to that!

2506
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:41,815
That's garbage!
No, no, no, no.

2507
01:33:41,817 --> 01:33:44,451
Tell me he's okay.
Please.

2508
01:33:44,453 --> 01:33:46,119
I'm sorry, son.

2509
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:48,321
No!

2510
01:33:48,323 --> 01:33:49,756
- No!
- He killed his father!

2511
01:33:49,758 --> 01:33:51,591
He's a very strong actor.
Don't buy it.

2512
01:33:51,593 --> 01:33:53,460
- Oh, bravo!
- Get on the ground.

2513
01:33:53,462 --> 01:33:55,061
Okay!
We're getting down,
okay?

2514
01:33:55,063 --> 01:33:57,464
I can't believe you're buying
that acting, though, man.

2515
01:33:57,466 --> 01:33:59,099
It's really... I mean,
it's good but it's fucking...

2516
01:33:59,101 --> 01:34:01,601
you have the right
to remain silent, assholes.

2517
01:34:01,603 --> 01:34:04,804
You have the right to
an attorney, asshole.

2518
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:06,106
Y...
<i>¶ tiger, a fighter ¶</i>

2519
01:34:06,108 --> 01:34:08,675
<i>¶ dancing through the fire ¶</i>

2520
01:34:08,677 --> 01:34:10,510
Hey.
Hey, that's my phone!

2521
01:34:10,512 --> 01:34:12,612
He has my phone! That's
the phone Bert had on the bench!

2522
01:34:12,614 --> 01:34:14,080
Check that phone!

2523
01:34:14,082 --> 01:34:15,649
If he was tied up here
the whole time,

2524
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,750
how could Rex have the same
phone? Check the phone.

2525
01:34:16,752 --> 01:34:19,119
Exactly.
They switched pants!

2526
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:21,354
Yeah. They got it.
They got it.
Check it!

2527
01:34:21,356 --> 01:34:22,856
It's the same ringtone,
sir.

2528
01:34:22,858 --> 01:34:24,791
Yeah, th-that's... th-that's...
that's my phone.

2529
01:34:24,793 --> 01:34:27,794
I have the same ringtone.
It's... it's... it's
an inspiring ringtone.

2530
01:34:27,796 --> 01:34:30,430
You were here this whole time
with a cellphone,

2531
01:34:30,432 --> 01:34:32,432
and you didn't bother
to call the police?

2532
01:34:32,434 --> 01:34:34,634
Ah! Ah-ha!
Yes!

2533
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:37,504
Shut the fuck up.

2534
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:41,241
Let me see it.
I said let me see it.

2535
01:34:45,113 --> 01:34:46,513
Everybody
move the fuck off.

2536
01:34:46,515 --> 01:34:48,348
Yeah, he looks
pretty guilty now, right?

2537
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,783
He's definitely suspect.

2538
01:34:49,785 --> 01:34:51,685
Drop your fucking guns.

2539
01:34:51,687 --> 01:34:55,188
You shoot this prick.
You shoot this prick right now.

2540
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:57,390
You drop your guns, or I'll
blow his fucking head off.

2541
01:34:57,392 --> 01:35:00,260
You hear me? Move!
Move!

2542
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:03,697
Oh, shit, he's gonna
get away with this.

2543
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:06,199
This guy doesn't quit.
Jesus.
He's incredibly resilient.

2544
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:09,369
You. Keys in the car?
Keys are in the car.

2545
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:11,204
This fucking guy.
Calm down.

2546
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:12,839
This fucking guy
took everything from me.

2547
01:35:12,841 --> 01:35:14,474
"Calm down"?
"Calm down, Dale"?

2548
01:35:14,476 --> 01:35:16,076
No, fuck
this fucking guy!

2549
01:35:16,078 --> 01:35:17,711
He took my wife,
all right, step away.

2550
01:35:17,713 --> 01:35:20,146
He took my kids. I'm gonna
do something about this.

2551
01:35:20,148 --> 01:35:21,748
What are you
gonna do about it?

2552
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:23,983
Look who's
a predator now, bitch.

2553
01:35:23,985 --> 01:35:25,251
Wait, Dale.
What are you doing?

2554
01:35:30,258 --> 01:35:31,491
Dale!
Oh!

2555
01:35:31,493 --> 01:35:32,625
Oh, I'm shot.

2556
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:37,530
Cuff this
crazy asshole,

2557
01:35:37,532 --> 01:35:40,600
and beat the shit out of him
while you're at it.

2558
01:35:40,602 --> 01:35:41,768
- Oh, shit.
- Dale, buddy, you okay?

2559
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:43,837
Hey.
Oh, wow.

2560
01:35:43,839 --> 01:35:46,339
What was that?

2561
01:35:46,341 --> 01:35:48,441
Dale, let's put this
down. Now, what was
the plan here, buddy?

2562
01:35:48,443 --> 01:35:50,243
I don't know.
I just overreacted.
It's not even sharp.

2563
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:53,279
Yeah, adrenaline. I get it.
Did it just graze me, or...

2564
01:35:53,281 --> 01:35:54,748
No, you got hit in the...
I went right in me, right?

2565
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,282
Yeah, right in the...
square in the fucking chest.

2566
01:35:56,284 --> 01:35:57,851
But you're gonna
be fine, okay?

2567
01:35:57,853 --> 01:35:59,919
Yeah, yeah. No, no, no.
I don't know about that, man.

2568
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:03,523
That's a lot of blood.
don't listen to him.
Hey. You're gonna make it.

2569
01:36:03,525 --> 01:36:05,592
Oh, thank you.
Hey, Dale, yes, if you
want hope, listen to him.

2570
01:36:05,594 --> 01:36:07,594
Good!
If you want the truth,<i> I'm</i>
your fucking guy, all right?

2571
01:36:07,596 --> 01:36:08,795
Oh, fuck you, man.
This is bad news.

2572
01:36:08,797 --> 01:36:10,296
Can we get
some help over here?

2573
01:36:10,298 --> 01:36:12,732
Don't worry, son.
We're gonna get you fixed up.

2574
01:36:12,734 --> 01:36:15,135
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2575
01:36:15,137 --> 01:36:17,070
That's a big fucking hole.
Yeah.

2576
01:36:17,072 --> 01:36:18,905
I'm gonna go
to this light right here.

2577
01:36:18,907 --> 01:36:20,907
If you've got to go,
you got to go, man.

2578
01:36:20,909 --> 01:36:22,742
Please don't let me die
with him talking.

2579
01:36:22,744 --> 01:36:24,577
I'll take care
of Stacy and your boys.

2580
01:36:31,987 --> 01:36:34,087
That couldn't be more annoying.
It couldn't be more annoying.

2581
01:36:34,089 --> 01:36:35,922
I'm not trying to be annoying,
I'm trying to have fun.
It's annoying.

2582
01:36:35,924 --> 01:36:37,557
Hey!
It worked, though.
Look at that.

2583
01:36:37,559 --> 01:36:40,260
Look who's talking.
You okay, pal?

2584
01:36:40,262 --> 01:36:42,395
You've been drifting in
and out, but it's nice
to hear you talking, man.

2585
01:36:42,397 --> 01:36:45,431
So, what's... what's...
what do the doctors
say? Am I gonna die?

2586
01:36:45,433 --> 01:36:47,433
Yes.
Yes?!
No.

2587
01:36:47,435 --> 01:36:49,269
We're all gonna die, Nick.
He's old enough to know that.

2588
01:36:49,271 --> 01:36:51,337
It's been very touch-and-go,
but you're gonna be fine.

2589
01:36:51,339 --> 01:36:52,972
Yeah, the doctors
are gonna let you out
of here now that you're up.

2590
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:55,408
How long was I out?
Really?!
two years.

2591
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:57,410
Four days.
That's better.
Why didn't you play?

2592
01:36:57,412 --> 01:36:59,012
I thought we were gonna say
two years or something.
No. No, no, no.

2593
01:36:59,014 --> 01:37:01,681
That's better.
We've got a woman president!

2594
01:37:01,683 --> 01:37:04,117
Ah, shit.

2595
01:37:04,119 --> 01:37:05,518
Look who's here.
Oh, my gosh! He's talking.

2596
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06,753
Oh, yeah.
You're talking. Hi!

2597
01:37:06,755 --> 01:37:08,588
We'll leave
you guys alone.

2598
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:10,957
Please, let me
explain everything to you.
No, no, no, sweetie.

2599
01:37:10,959 --> 01:37:14,360
'Cause there are so many
misunderstandings.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay. It's okay.

2600
01:37:14,362 --> 01:37:15,929
Julia explained everything.

2601
01:37:15,931 --> 01:37:18,097
No. don't talk to her.
She's crazy.
No, no, no.

2602
01:37:18,099 --> 01:37:20,133
She told me everything
she put you through because
of her affliction.

2603
01:37:20,135 --> 01:37:23,770
"Her a-affliction"?!
It's just so heartbreaking
what she's been through.

2604
01:37:23,772 --> 01:37:24,804
Hi.

2605
01:37:24,806 --> 01:37:26,539
She also told me

2606
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:29,209
that my husband is the only one
that ever resisted her.

2607
01:37:29,211 --> 01:37:32,712
Okay.
Dale,
you are one lucky man.

2608
01:37:32,714 --> 01:37:35,448
Your wife is so
understanding and caring.

2609
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:38,484
Right.
So... Beautiful.

2610
01:37:38,486 --> 01:37:41,688
She has been so supportive
with the babies and helpful.

2611
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:44,123
Please, it's the least
I can do to make amends
for my bad behavior.

2612
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:45,892
Okay.
Okay, baby.

2613
01:37:45,894 --> 01:37:48,528
I'm gonna find Dr. Mike and
tell him that you're talking.

2614
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:51,164
I'll see you soon.
Okay, good. Yeah, go get
the doctor 'cause I'm...
I'm feeling a little...

2615
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:53,566
what is going on here?
What's up?

2616
01:37:53,568 --> 01:37:56,502
So, I-I'm off the hook?
There's no more white-whale
business or any of that?

2617
01:37:56,504 --> 01:37:59,239
Mm-hmm. No more.
You're off the hook.

2618
01:37:59,241 --> 01:38:01,674
Really?

2619
01:38:01,676 --> 01:38:04,077
Did you know
that when men are in a coma...

2620
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:06,012
They can still
get an erection?

2621
01:38:06,014 --> 01:38:08,748
It's true, Dale.
Coma boners.

2622
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,683
"Coma boner"?
What?

2623
01:38:10,685 --> 01:38:13,887
Lots... And lots...

2624
01:38:13,889 --> 01:38:15,989
Of coma boners.

2625
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:17,390
Think about it.

2626
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:18,491
Oh, shit.

2627
01:38:18,493 --> 01:38:20,193
All right, well,
I better go.

2628
01:38:20,195 --> 01:38:22,896
I'm booking a spa day
for me and Stacy.

2629
01:38:22,898 --> 01:38:25,398
Hmm.

2630
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,600
I'm gonna
fuck your wife, Dale.

2631
01:38:27,602 --> 01:38:29,235
No, no. No.

2632
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:30,536
Uh, no, you're not. Hang on.
Yes, I am.

2633
01:38:30,538 --> 01:38:31,538
Hang on. No!

2634
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:33,373
Hey! There she is.

2635
01:38:33,375 --> 01:38:35,208
Boys.
You look fantastic.

2636
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:38,278
Mm-hmm.
You know, been sending you
a lot of unanswered texts.

2637
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:42,081
That's not how you catch them,
am I right?
I think she said
she's gonna fuck my wife.

2638
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:44,517
<i>"Gonna</i> fuck"?
I thought she already did.
Oh, boy, yeah. That horse
may have left the barn.

2639
01:38:44,519 --> 01:38:47,287
I figured those guys
have been bumping tacos
for the last few days.
Shit.

2640
01:38:47,289 --> 01:38:50,123
Super touchy-feely lately.
I can't process this.
This is too much.

2641
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:52,959
Anyway, so, like,
what's even going on?

2642
01:38:52,961 --> 01:38:54,560
What happened? Did we get in
trouble with the police, or...

2643
01:38:54,562 --> 01:38:56,396
W-we did, yeah.
Yeah. A lot.

2644
01:38:56,398 --> 01:38:58,765
We got arrested
for a long list of felonies.
Mm-hmm.

2645
01:39:01,136 --> 01:39:02,969
But because you took
a bullet for the detective,

2646
01:39:02,971 --> 01:39:04,537
d.A. Got rid of
a lot of the biggies.

2647
01:39:04,539 --> 01:39:05,939
Pretty sweet.

2648
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:08,074
All right, so I'm guessing
we saved the business.

2649
01:39:08,076 --> 01:39:09,742
Nope. We did not. No.
We did not.

2650
01:39:09,744 --> 01:39:12,979
The bank foreclosed
a couple days ago.

2651
01:39:12,981 --> 01:39:15,615
Going once, going twice,
sold!

2652
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:17,050
D.H. Commercial trust.

2653
01:39:17,052 --> 01:39:19,052
But there's
good news, too.

2654
01:39:19,054 --> 01:39:21,054
The guy who bought the company
is keeping us on to run it.

2655
01:39:21,056 --> 01:39:23,056
And then, in
the wholesale department.

2656
01:39:23,058 --> 01:39:25,058
If we bring that
down to $300, you've got...

2657
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:26,392
lupe!

2658
01:39:26,394 --> 01:39:28,094
Oh!<i> Hola,</i> lupe!
<i>Hola, hola.</i>

2659
01:39:28,096 --> 01:39:30,730
Mm-hmm.

2660
01:39:30,732 --> 01:39:32,799
Uh... Skymall?

2661
01:39:32,801 --> 01:39:35,435
<i>- Sí!</i> Skymall.
- Great! That's great news.

2662
01:39:35,437 --> 01:39:38,638
Uh, skymall order
is ready to ship!
Yeah, the boss
is gonna love that.

2663
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:41,200
Yes, he will. Let's go
show him these great
numbers, too. Come on.

2664
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:46,312
Are we happy
with these numbers?

2665
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:48,748
Oh, I mean...
They're pretty good.

2666
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:50,950
There's room
for improvement.
We can do better.

2667
01:39:50,952 --> 01:39:53,152
Oh, my god.
I just realized.

2668
01:39:53,154 --> 01:39:55,254
You actually thought you
were bringing me good news.

2669
01:39:55,256 --> 01:39:56,756
The three of you
walked in here

2670
01:39:56,758 --> 01:39:58,958
with little smiles on your
fucking pathetic faces.

2671
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,995
Why were you born?
Why were the three of you born?

2672
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:05,598
It's like looking at you
is like looking out over the
grand canyon of ineptitude.

2673
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,500
I mean, it's a wonder
your parents didn't
smother you when you w...

2674
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:09,702
- where are you going? Oh, no, no.
- See you next week, boss!

2675
01:40:09,704 --> 01:40:12,138
I have an idea... why don't you
try a suicide pact, huh?!

2676
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,806
And I'm not talking about
throwing yourself off a building

2677
01:40:13,808 --> 01:40:16,642
or some sleeping-pills
fucking shit!

2678
01:40:16,644 --> 01:40:18,644
I'm talking about, you can
fuck each other to death!

2679
01:40:18,646 --> 01:40:20,646
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?! I own you!

2680
01:40:20,648 --> 01:40:22,849
¶ How you like me now? ¶

2681
01:40:22,851 --> 01:40:25,051
¶ how you like me now? ¶

2682
01:40:25,053 --> 01:40:27,220
¶ how you like me now? ¶

2683
01:40:27,222 --> 01:40:28,688
¶ how you like me now? ¶

2684
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:30,823
Well, we have several
franchise opportunities

2685
01:40:30,825 --> 01:40:35,228
available in your area,
but, uh, purchasing a store

2686
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:39,499
requires significant
up-front investment.

2687
01:40:39,501 --> 01:40:42,602
Well, in that case...

2688
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:49,342
...start me off
with three locations.

2689
01:40:49,344 --> 01:40:52,745
I'm sure that we
can accommodate you, Mr. Jones.

2690
01:40:52,747 --> 01:40:54,514
Please.

2691
01:40:54,516 --> 01:40:57,150
Mr. Jones?
That's my daddy.

2692
01:40:57,152 --> 01:40:58,551
Call me motherfucker.

2693
01:40:58,553 --> 01:41:00,253
¶ How you like me now? ¶

2694
01:41:00,255 --> 01:41:01,654
¶ how you like me now? ¶

2695
01:41:01,656 --> 01:41:04,057
¶ how you like me now? ¶

2696
01:41:04,059 --> 01:41:05,258
every... this guy!

2697
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:08,261
¶ How you like me n-o-o-ow? ¶

2698
01:41:08,263 --> 01:41:09,729
okay, first, we tie up Rex

2699
01:41:09,731 --> 01:41:11,564
in one of those abandoned
warehouses off 3rd.

2700
01:41:15,003 --> 01:41:17,570
First, we're gonna tie up Rex...

2701
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:20,239
First, we're gonna
tie up Rex in one of those...
fuck off, everybody.

2702
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:23,242
As soon as Bert's car
is underground...

2703
01:41:23,244 --> 01:41:24,744
The police loses...

2704
01:41:24,746 --> 01:41:26,946
Bert's car
goes underground, right?

2705
01:41:26,948 --> 01:41:28,388
Police lose the signal
from the wire.

2706
01:41:32,353 --> 01:41:35,553
Do you guys validate parking?
Not you personally. Obviously,
that would be racist.

2707
01:41:38,359 --> 01:41:40,193
You're gonna
pull into space 4421.

2708
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:45,798
I got to call you back.

2709
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,433
The bank foreclosed
two days ago.

2710
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:49,936
Hey, but there is
good news.

2711
01:41:49,938 --> 01:41:51,871
Really?

2712
01:41:53,074 --> 01:41:54,607
"Really?"

2713
01:41:54,609 --> 01:41:56,242
We need to talk to somebody
who's legitimate.

2714
01:41:56,244 --> 01:42:00,346
We need to find someone
who can get us our company back.

2715
01:42:02,484 --> 01:42:04,917
I can't take you to the next
scene any better than that.

2716
01:42:06,254 --> 01:42:08,654
Well, then I would
marry Daniel Craig,

2717
01:42:08,656 --> 01:42:11,157
I'd fuck Sean connery,
and I'd kill Timothy Dalton.

2718
01:42:11,159 --> 01:42:13,392
I would marry ed helms,
fuck Bradley Cooper,

2719
01:42:13,394 --> 01:42:14,894
and kill
Zach galifianakis.

2720
01:42:14,896 --> 01:42:16,496
Marry crackle...

2721
01:42:16,498 --> 01:42:17,498
Fuck snap, kill pop.

2722
01:42:17,499 --> 01:42:19,432
Mm-hmm.
Right?

2723
01:42:19,434 --> 01:42:22,635
Oh, my god, do you know
what this looks like?
What?

2724
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:24,937
It looks like we don't know
what we're doing.

2725
01:42:26,508 --> 01:42:28,741
Boy, I'd love it if you'd
stop saying my na...

2726
01:42:31,846 --> 01:42:34,080
Wait, hang on a second!
Hey, freeze!

2727
01:42:34,082 --> 01:42:36,282
Guess who's
got the gun now?

2728
01:42:36,284 --> 01:42:37,683
Me.

2729
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:44,690
Where do you think
she learned it?

2730
01:42:44,692 --> 01:42:47,260
Maybe from
the first movie.

2731
01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:51,497
Get that chair ready.
I'm gonna take a quick
tinkle, all right?

2732
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,533
Oh, but I'm thirsty.

2733
01:42:53,535 --> 01:42:56,169
Save me a shake.

2734
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:57,870
I just can't say it.

2735
01:43:00,108 --> 01:43:01,941
So you want to
use the ransom...

2736
01:43:01,943 --> 01:43:04,143
- what is it?
- Uh...

2737
01:43:04,145 --> 01:43:07,113
"Y'all plan to use the ransom
to save y'all bidness."

2738
01:43:07,115 --> 01:43:09,015
I just like
to hear you say it.

2739
01:43:11,653 --> 01:43:12,952
Come on, man.

2740
01:43:12,954 --> 01:43:14,787
Help me help you
get revenge on my assho...

2741
01:43:16,991 --> 01:43:20,193
...my asshole...
Asshole dad!

2742
01:43:21,896 --> 01:43:23,729
You have to take
what's yours in this...

2743
01:43:23,731 --> 01:43:25,731
In this l...

2744
01:43:27,168 --> 01:43:29,168
I mean, you have to...
You have to...

2745
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:30,803
...take what's yours
in this life.

2746
01:43:30,805 --> 01:43:31,805
Take it!

2747
01:43:31,806 --> 01:43:33,105
Grab it!

2748
01:43:34,842 --> 01:43:38,477
You will pass your empty,
sack-less ball sacks...

2749
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:39,679
No, it's not that.

2750
01:43:41,249 --> 01:43:42,748
"Empty,<i> shriveled</i> sacks."
They're shriveled.

2751
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:44,270
I should know that
just looking at you.

2752
01:43:52,827 --> 01:43:54,827
That's your credit picture
right there.

2753
01:43:58,166 --> 01:44:00,566
Here comes the heavy.
I smell dog shit.

2754
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:03,202
Do you really?
Yeah.

2755
01:44:03,204 --> 01:44:05,037
It might be
your acting.

2756
01:44:12,113 --> 01:44:16,549
¶ No matter what you are ¶

2757
01:44:16,551 --> 01:44:20,553
¶ I will always be with you ¶

2758
01:44:20,555 --> 01:44:24,557
¶ doesn't matter
what you do, girl ¶

2759
01:44:24,559 --> 01:44:28,761
¶ ooh, girl, with you ¶

2760
01:44:28,763 --> 01:44:33,199
¶ no matter what you do ¶

2761
