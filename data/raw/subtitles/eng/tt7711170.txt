<i>Turn right.</i>

00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:22,293
<i>You will reach
your destination in four days.</i>

4
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:07,670
Sorry.

5
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:47,338
<i>The next storm
is already developing...</i>

6
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:50,167
<i>The lucky winners</i>

00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:52,036

Super Lottery draw.</i>

8
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,948
<i>...hungry to know the meaning</i>

9
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,050
<i>and origin
of every new word she heard.</i>

10
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,455
<i>Fascinated by old buildings
and dying towns,</i>

11
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,257
<i>her wit was...</i>

12
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:29,739
<i>...as there were
necessary obstacles</i>

13
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:35,446
<i>to her ideal life of animals,
and plants, and perhaps...</i>

14
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:44,555
<i>...not been an easy journey,
not since she was 12</i>

15
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:47,824
<i>and had fled
from her adoptive parents.</i>

16
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:51,295
<i>She would turn 42
that autumn...</i>

17
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:56,900
<i>...a whole lifetime to explore.</i>

18
00:06:57,301 --> 00:07:01,872
<i>Sometimes the details didn't
seem to jive, of course.</i>

19
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:05,142
<i>Sometimes names
were changed,</i>

20
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:07,344
<i>chronologies
were inconsistent.</i>

21
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:10,047
<i>As a freelance
graphic designer...</i>

22
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:43,514
Move!

23
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:49,353
Shit.

24
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,494
Holy fuck.

25
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,874
What the fuck?

26
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,898
What the fuck?

27
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:12,002
<i>...Fiona flings her body</i>

28
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:15,973
<i>against the horizontal
metal bar...</i>

29
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,688
- <i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>
- Hi.

30
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,758
<i>Why don't you call the home
number and speak to Mom?</i>

31
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:39,129
Because I wanted to talk
to you and not Mom.

32
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:41,598
<i>Oh, um...</i>

33
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,836
<i>well, any... any progress
with the bank?</i>

34
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:47,237
Yeah.

35
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,939
<i>Hey, look,
signal's kind of bad.</i>

36
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:50,875
<i>Are you at home?</i>

37
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,510
Actually, I... I left already.

38
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:55,746
I just wanted you to know.

39
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:58,849
<i>What? When?</i>

40
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,852
This morning.

41
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:03,654
<i>Oh, we were supposed to come
over and help you tomorrow.</i>

42
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:05,022
I know, I know.

43
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:08,158
I just wanted to avoid Mom
and the ensuing drama.

44
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:10,127
<i>She's just worried about you.</i>

45
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,930
<i>So am I.</i>

46
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:13,831
I know. I'll be fine.

47
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:15,799
<i>We just wanted to make...</i>

48
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,669
<i>Oh, never mind.</i>

49
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,038
<i>So how far are you?</i>

50
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:22,840
I'm sorry.
What'd you say, Dad?

51
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:24,374
<i>I... How far are you?</i>

52
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:27,444
About 300 miles
from the house.

53
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:30,113
<i>Boy, you must have been
moving along, yeah?</i>

54
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:31,782
Yeah, I... I guess.

55
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:43,494
Oh, I... I just wanted
to let you know.

56
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:45,262
<i>Okay.</i>

57
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,432
<i>Well, thanks for calling.</i>

58
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:52,202
<i>Maybe we can come
and visit you</i>

59
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,872
<i>when you've settled in a bit?</i>

60
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:56,440
Of course, and...

61
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:59,443
say hi to Mom for me.

62
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:55,352
Sorry.

63
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:04,661
- S... scared you?
- Yeah.

64
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,731
It's okay, no worries.

65
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,734
- Sure?
- Yeah.

66
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:16,273
Uh, do you recognize me?

67
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:20,544
No, not really.

68
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,983
I'm driving that.

69
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,155
Right.

70
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:34,025
Yeah, I... I just wanted
to apologize for yesterday.

71
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:35,093
I was texting.

72
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:36,560
I didn't see you trying to pass.

73
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,365
Well, it was a close call.

74
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,871
Nah, I put my phone down, and...

75
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:50,307
realized I was in a hurry,
and so I had to repass you.

76
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,542
It was just one
of those days, you know?

77
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:55,913
It's okay.

78
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:58,315
What's done is done.

79
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:01,585
But I scared you
a little bit.

80
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:03,855
I... Look, I gotta go, sorry.

81
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:07,591
- Do you live, uh, nearby?
- Uh, no, no, not really.

82
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,393
Where are you, um...
where are you going?

83
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:14,899
- I'm headed north.
- I'm always in the area, so...

84
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,568
Do you...
uh, do you have a name?

85
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,306
- Jessica.
- Jessica.

86
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,410
I apologize again,

87
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:29,279
and...

88
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,015
I'll see you around.

89
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,520
Yeah, yeah, it was...
it was nice meeting you.

90
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:38,055
Nice to meet you, too.

91
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,557
I hope you have a good trip.

92
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:41,926
Thanks.

93
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:45,883
Do you mind to open up?

94
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,724
Hey, there.

95
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:57,427
Hey, what's... what's going on?

96
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,531
No idea.
The engine just died on me.

97
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,334
It's a piece of shit.
What can I say?

98
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:05,835
Yeah, that's... that's too bad.

99
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:08,105
Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

100
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:14,312
You want me to call you a...
a tow truck?

101
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:16,813
No, if... if you could just
give me a ride

102
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:18,883
to the next town,
I can go to a gas station.

103
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,086
But first, I need some help
to get the car out of the road.

104
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:27,058
Look, I'm...
I'm just in a bit of a hurry.

105
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:31,561
Yeah, I mean, me too.
I... it'll just take a minute.

106
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:34,198
I'll push.
You can steer.

107
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,533
Come on.

108
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,440
I can check the GPS.

109
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:46,010
- Excuse me?
- I can search on GPS.

110
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,111
Why?

111
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:49,246
I'll... I'll find
the next gas station.

112
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,916
- I... I'll just give them a call.
- I know where it is.

113
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:54,085
It's just up the road
about 15 minutes.

114
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,752
Well, then I'll just go
up there,

115
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,254
and I'll tell them
to come back and get you.

116
00:18:57,587 --> 00:19:00,523
Well, I do need help getting
the car out of the road first.

117
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:02,692
It's a bit hard with this thing.

118
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:05,662
I'm sorry, I've got to go...

119
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:06,931
It's just gonna take a minute.

120
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,265
I've got to go.
I'm late for a meeting.

121
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:09,599
- I'm sorry.
- I just need a...

122
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,380
<i>One night, when her eyes</i>

123
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:24,781
<i>looked about the neighborhood
of the Palais-Royal</i>

124
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:28,551
<i>doubtful to what amusement we
should next partake ourselves</i>

125
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,621
<i>my friend proposed a visit
to Visconti,</i>

126
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,492
<i>but his suggestion was not...</i>

127
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:38,195
<i>...I knew Visconti,
and what I'm saying is...</i>

128
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:20,971
<i>Hello?</i>

129
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:22,973
<i>Jess?</i>

130
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:24,108
Hi.

131
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,977
<i>Sweetie, why'd you leave
without telling us?</i>

132
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:28,913
<i>I don't understand.</i>

133
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:31,082
Well, I woke up early,

134
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:33,884
and I thought I might
as well get going.

135
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:36,120
<i>Sweetie, I... I tried you
a few times,</i>

136
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:38,189
<i>and I wasn't able
to get through.</i>

137
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:40,790
I'm busy.

138
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:46,330
<i>So...</i>

139
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:48,665
<i>Are... are you there yet?</i>

140
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:52,937
No...
I'd say sometime tomorrow.

141
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,144
<i>Are you smoking again?</i>

142
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:03,013
Nope.

143
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:10,988
<i>So, um...</i>

144
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:14,291
<i>Jess, have you called
the therapist yet?</i>

145
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:17,461
Like I said, I've been busy.

146
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:21,165
<i>I just don't understand
why you're leaving right now.</i>

147
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:23,067
<i>After all that's happened,
wouldn't it be better...</i>

148
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,202
Mom, we've been through this.

149
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:29,874
<i>Why don't you want
to talk about it?</i>

150
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,675
Because I don't need to.
I'm fine.

151
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:37,414
<i>Really?</i>

152
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:41,684
<i>Jess, come on.</i>

153
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:46,056
- <i>Sweetie.</i>
- Really.

154
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:49,360
<i>Well...</i>

155
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:51,629
<i>...we just think it's
a really bad idea.</i>

156
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:53,898
<i>You have friends and family</i>

157
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:55,732
<i>who will support you
down here, sweetheart...</i>

158
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:58,202
Well, I'm going anyway.

159
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,740
<i>I just think
you should've stayed home</i>

160
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:05,142
<i>until you felt
a little bit better.</i>

161
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:10,114
It's been six months...
it's time to move on.

162
00:22:11,482 --> 00:22:13,716
<i>Okay, but promise me
you'll talk to someone</i>

163
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:14,852
<i>when you get there.</i>

164
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:17,988
I got to go.

165
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:20,991
<i>Promise me. Please, Jess,
you need to promise me...</i>

166
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:22,660
Mom, um, I got to go.

167
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,161
I... I'll talk
to you later, okay?

168
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:25,396
<i>Okay, but call me
when you get there.</i>

169
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:27,264
Okay, bye.

170
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,409
Hey, I just...

171
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:20,251
All right.

172
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:27,891
Fuck!

173
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:29,326
Come on!

174
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,395
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

175
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:35,299
Hey!

176
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,501
I was just trying
to go to the bathroom,

177
00:23:37,635 --> 00:23:38,801
and you almost hit me.

178
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:42,006
What the hell's your problem?

179
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:45,109
Hello? Hey!

180
00:24:29,953 --> 00:24:31,355
Pick up, pick up.

181
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:34,191
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

182
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:35,993
Hi, my name is
Jessica Swanson.

183
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,928
I think I'm being followed.

184
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:39,296
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am.
Can you repeat that?</i>

185
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,031
<i>We seem to have
a bad connection.</i>

186
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:43,000
My name is Jessica Swanson.
I'm being followed.

187
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,501
- <i>Who's following you?</i>
- I... I don't know.

188
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:46,370
There's this guy, I've seen him
a couple of times.

189
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:50,574
I don't know what he wants.
He's right behind me!

190
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,047
<i>What is your location, ma'am?</i>

191
00:24:57,181 --> 00:24:59,350
I'm in my car!
Can you hear me?

192
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:01,485
<i>Ma'am, please,
tell me your location.</i>

193
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:03,153
Fuck, I don't know!

194
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:07,524
I can't, I don't know!

195
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:13,197
<i>Ma'am?</i>

196
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,100
Oh, shit.

197
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:20,371
I'm sorry, that's...

198
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:24,308
- That was a false alarm.
- <i>It wasn't him?</i>

199
00:25:26,677 --> 00:25:28,045
No.

200
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:32,383
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

201
00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:34,318
<i>I'll connect you
to one of the officers,</i>

202
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,520
<i>and you can tell him a bit
more about your situation.</i>

203
00:25:37,254 --> 00:25:38,589
Okay.

204
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:53,670
What the fuck is...

205
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:14,591
Shit!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

206
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,441
Fuck.

207
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,569
Come on, come on.

208
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,619
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

209
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:26,356
Oh, no, no, stop.

210
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,125
Get the fuck off me!
Get off me!

211
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:30,093
Get off me!
No! Ah, fuck!

212
00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:31,461
Come here.

213
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:11,655
Hey!

214
00:31:14,257 --> 00:31:16,660
Let me out!
Help!

215
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:19,563
Help me!

216
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:25,836
Help me!
Let me the fuck out of here!

217
00:31:26,104 --> 00:31:29,140
Let me out, please, please.
Please, I'm begging you.

218
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:32,676
Please. Please!

219
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,717
What do you want from me?

220
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:25,388
What do you want?

221
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:30,694
Is it money?
I can... I can get you money, I...

222
00:33:31,528 --> 00:33:33,264
Just tell me how much.
I can pay you.

223
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,765
I promise.
Just tell me how much.

224
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:38,635
Just tell me how much.

225
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:46,911
You can let me go.

226
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:55,086
I won't tell anybody.
I... I promise.

227
00:33:58,289 --> 00:33:59,689
I promise.

228
00:34:02,026 --> 00:34:05,395
Do you think you're
the first one to say that?

229
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,909
Take your clothes off.

230
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:27,952
Go on.

231
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:32,622
You want some help?

232
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:37,761
I just...

233
00:34:38,896 --> 00:34:40,998
need to use the bathroom first.

234
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:48,072
Go right ahead.

235
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:49,033
It's okay.

236
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:51,735
There you go.

237
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,574
I didn't even have time

238
00:35:57,707 --> 00:35:59,709
to cut all the way through
at the rest stop.

239
00:36:04,614 --> 00:36:07,118
Please just let me go.

240
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:09,920
Almost gave up.

241
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,991
Please.

242
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,993
Let's see what we have here.

243
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,203
<i>Okay, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

244
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:29,373
<i>I am finally learning
how to do this trick.</i>

245
00:36:29,507 --> 00:36:30,640
<i>This is the only reason</i>

246
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,009
- <i>I married this man...</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

247
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:34,011
<i>Because he impressed me
with this trick.</i>

248
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:36,047
- <i>Yeah, the only reason.</i>
- <i>The only reason.</i>

249
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,517
<i>All right, can you take this?</i>

250
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:41,118
<i>Pick a card.</i>

251
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:43,120
<i>Um...</i>

252
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:49,026
<i>Don't look, don't look.
Don't look, don't look.</i>

253
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:52,662
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

254
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:56,033
<i>Ooh-hoo.
What was that move?</i>

255
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:58,369
- <i>What was that move?</i>
- <i>You just saw.</i>

256
00:37:00,204 --> 00:37:01,872
- <i>I'm watching you. I know.</i>
- <i>Uh...</i>

257
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:03,706
- I know what's happening.
- <i>Abracadabra!</i>

258
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,042
You're cute together.

259
00:37:06,877 --> 00:37:08,279
- <i>Where's my card?
- Oh, shit.</i>

260
00:37:08,546 --> 00:37:10,047
- <i>Where is your card?</i>
- <i>Where's my card?</i>

261
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:11,916
<i>My card's supposed to be
in the middle.</i>

262
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:13,250
<i>Wait, did I mess it?
Wait, no, there's your card.</i>

263
00:37:13,384 --> 00:37:14,717
<i>What!</i>

264
00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:15,652
You think he's worried
about you?

265
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:20,757
<i>I fucked it up.</i>

266
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:25,096
Hey...
I asked you a question.

267
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:01,265
He left you.

268
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:06,971
- Huh?
- He died.

269
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:11,208
How?

270
00:38:13,776 --> 00:38:15,379
How did he die?

271
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,917
He...

272
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,319
He killed himself.

273
00:38:28,926 --> 00:38:30,327
In what way?

274
00:38:34,797 --> 00:38:38,903
A gun.

275
00:38:47,978 --> 00:38:50,147
And you found him?

276
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:58,355
That's tough.

277
00:39:00,524 --> 00:39:03,294
That's tough.

278
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,202
Aw, it's gonna be okay.

279
00:39:11,669 --> 00:39:13,770
It's gonna be okay.

280
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:29,046
Come on!

281
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:32,116
Ah, shit.

282
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:27,304
Come on.

283
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:21,338
Hey.

284
00:45:23,173 --> 00:45:25,609
No, no, I'm not
doing much right now.

285
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,578
Just at the hotel.

286
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:29,846
About to go get some lunch here
in a little bit.

287
00:45:31,615 --> 00:45:32,516
Oh, gosh.

288
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:36,486
It is...
absolutely beautiful here.

289
00:45:37,087 --> 00:45:40,157
It's... it's so gorgeous.

290
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:41,725
Looks out over the water.

291
00:45:43,126 --> 00:45:44,394
Mm-hmm.

292
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:47,865
You and I should come here
some time.

293
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:51,168
Yeah.

294
00:45:52,603 --> 00:45:55,839
Nah, the deal's just taking
longer than... than I expected.

295
00:45:58,076 --> 00:45:59,676
Um, I don't know.

296
00:46:00,477 --> 00:46:03,380
It looks like
it may be Wednesday.

297
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:08,485
It just depends on when they
can make their mind up, yeah.

298
00:46:10,955 --> 00:46:12,222
Mm-hmm.

299
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,961
No, we're just down
to some little detail on it.

300
00:46:17,394 --> 00:46:19,864
I think it's gonna be fine.
Yeah.

301
00:46:21,032 --> 00:46:22,165
Mm-hmm.

302
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,268
And how's Mina?

303
00:46:27,972 --> 00:46:29,139
Yeah.

304
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,343
Yeah, just...
I guess just make sure

305
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:35,880
she doesn't have any more milk
until we know for sure.

306
00:46:37,314 --> 00:46:38,515
Uh-huh.

307
00:46:39,616 --> 00:46:42,285
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let me talk to her.

308
00:46:46,757 --> 00:46:48,325
Hey, little bug.

309
00:46:50,427 --> 00:46:53,430
Aw, I miss you, too,
sweetheart.

310
00:46:55,565 --> 00:46:57,768
Yeah, how's the stomach?

311
00:47:00,537 --> 00:47:01,805
Yeah, Mom told me,

312
00:47:01,939 --> 00:47:05,877
but you are gonna be
just fine real soon.

313
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:08,980
I promise.
Uh-huh.

314
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,483
I think that I'm gonna see you
in a couple of days,

315
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:16,820
but you're probably gonna be
asleep when I get home.

316
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:19,423
I love you, too.

317
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,727
All right, bye.
And let me talk to Mom first.

318
00:47:24,062 --> 00:47:25,429
Bye.

319
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,533
Yeah.

320
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,903
No, I know.

321
00:47:33,236 --> 00:47:37,374
All right, let me, uh, let me
give you a call tomorrow,

322
00:47:37,507 --> 00:47:39,676
and I'll let you know
how it's looking.

323
00:47:41,511 --> 00:47:43,513
Okay.
Love you, babe.

324
00:47:44,214 --> 00:47:45,983
All right, bye.

325
00:49:04,262 --> 00:49:07,697
Help me!
Oh, God.

326
00:49:10,467 --> 00:49:11,835
Oh, God.

327
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,084
Mm.

328
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,371
- No!
- Back off!

329
00:54:47,505 --> 00:54:49,340
Get down on your knees.

330
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:54,044
Please. I'm sorry.
You have to help me.

331
00:54:54,311 --> 00:54:58,015
Please, I need you
to help me right now.

332
00:54:58,648 --> 00:55:01,318
Fuck! What the hell is going on?

333
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:03,621
We have to get out of here.

334
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:06,557
- Let's go...
- You stay right where you are.

335
00:55:06,689 --> 00:55:08,926
No, someone is trying
to kill me.

336
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,861
- What?
- He's crazy.

337
00:55:10,995 --> 00:55:13,397
He's completely fucking crazy.

338
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:17,834
Please, do you have a phone?
Anything, please?

339
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:23,274
Anything?

340
00:55:23,874 --> 00:55:25,075
Hang on.

341
00:55:27,611 --> 00:55:29,013
Oh, shit.

342
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:38,355
I got to get out of here.
Please get me out of here.

343
00:55:41,525 --> 00:55:42,960
What'd you do to your foot?

344
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:45,262
I stepped on a root.

345
00:55:49,133 --> 00:55:52,303
I have some...
extra boots in the car.

346
00:55:53,504 --> 00:55:54,939
Back that way.

347
00:55:59,076 --> 00:56:00,743
Don't try anything with that.

348
00:56:02,146 --> 00:56:03,147
I won't.

349
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:05,049
Now come on.

350
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:07,284
Okay.

351
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:43,387
These are my wife's.

352
00:56:43,753 --> 00:56:46,357
They're probably too big,
but better that than too small.

353
00:56:46,523 --> 00:56:47,658
- Right?
- Thank you.

354
00:56:58,035 --> 00:56:59,970
Well, let's get out of here.

355
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:48,952
You okay?

356
00:57:51,588 --> 00:57:52,956
Yeah.

357
00:57:54,591 --> 00:57:55,825
I'm fine.

358
00:57:57,695 --> 00:57:59,563
When was the last time
you had anything to eat?

359
00:58:05,069 --> 00:58:06,904
I don't remember.

360
00:58:07,037 --> 00:58:08,806
There's some sandwiches
in the backpack.

361
00:58:08,939 --> 00:58:10,374
You can help yourself.

362
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,316
Goat cheese and honey,
if that's all right.

363
00:58:20,617 --> 00:58:23,120
My wife makes
a killer sandwich.

364
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:37,401
There should be some water
in there.

365
00:59:02,926 --> 00:59:04,495
You think he's still out there?

366
00:59:07,197 --> 00:59:08,499
Maybe.

367
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:13,670
I think he's long gone.

368
00:59:13,804 --> 00:59:15,305
He's probably somewhere

369
00:59:15,439 --> 00:59:18,609
trying to think up an alibi.

370
00:59:21,011 --> 00:59:23,380
Oh, God.
What's this?

371
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:30,554
No, no, no!

372
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,589
- Jessica, Jessica, calm down!
- No, this is him!

373
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:41,198
No, no, no.

374
00:59:45,836 --> 00:59:47,137
You have to help me.

375
00:59:47,404 --> 00:59:49,573
Jessica, you're never
gonna be able to move that.

376
00:59:50,073 --> 00:59:51,742
Come on. Come on.

377
00:59:52,142 --> 00:59:54,511
One, two, three.

378
00:59:56,113 --> 00:59:58,148
Oh, come on.
This is not gonna go anywhere.

379
00:59:58,282 --> 01:00:00,050
Push!

380
01:00:01,051 --> 01:00:02,586
Ah, fuck.

381
01:00:03,554 --> 01:00:05,155
Is there any other way
out of here?

382
01:00:05,289 --> 01:00:06,590
How do I know?

383
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,305
That's him.

384
01:00:21,438 --> 01:00:24,308
No, no!
You let me handle this.

385
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:25,843
- He will kill me.
- I'll handle this.

386
01:00:25,976 --> 01:00:28,479
You get back over there.
Back up against the tree.

387
01:00:32,282 --> 01:00:35,319
No, no.
Thank God, no.

388
01:00:35,452 --> 01:00:37,688
No, she's...
she's standing here.

389
01:00:38,021 --> 01:00:40,357
Okay, yeah.
No, she's with somebody.

390
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,392
Okay, thank you so much,

391
01:00:42,526 --> 01:00:45,529
and I'm so sorry that we had
to bother you with this again.

392
01:00:45,897 --> 01:00:48,031
Okay, I will.
All right, bye.

393
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:50,969
Jess, for God's sake.

394
01:00:51,301 --> 01:00:53,070
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Jess, please.

395
01:00:53,203 --> 01:00:55,439
Look, what is...
what is going on here?

396
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:58,141
Sir, you're gonna have
to excuse my sister.

397
01:00:58,275 --> 01:00:59,543
She's not feeling well.

398
01:00:59,676 --> 01:01:02,179
I am not your sister,
you fucking psycho!

399
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,449
I found her
about a half hour ago.

400
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:08,252
- She says you kidnapped her.
- Oh, God, no.

401
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:11,421
She had one of her episodes,
and before I knew it,

402
01:01:11,555 --> 01:01:14,391
she was out of the house, and
she had jumped in the river.

403
01:01:14,725 --> 01:01:15,860
Don't you believe him.

404
01:01:15,994 --> 01:01:17,427
- Look, all right, um...
- Jess, that's enough.

405
01:01:17,561 --> 01:01:19,998
Obviously, we...
we have a situation here.

406
01:01:20,364 --> 01:01:22,366
Oh, God.
W... what else did she say?

407
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:24,635
She said you locked her
in a basement?

408
01:01:24,801 --> 01:01:26,069
Jesus.

409
01:01:27,538 --> 01:01:28,605
Jess...

410
01:01:29,941 --> 01:01:31,141
Listen.

411
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:33,243
We've had a...

412
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:36,713
a tragedy
in our family recently,

413
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:40,350
and her...
her husband killed himself.

414
01:01:40,484 --> 01:01:42,185
Shut up, you sick fuck.

415
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,855
Now she's developed
these triggers,

416
01:01:43,988 --> 01:01:47,090
and one second, she's fine, and
then the next, she goes off.

417
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:49,626
Is she seeing a doctor?

418
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,962
E... every Tuesday.

419
01:01:51,094 --> 01:01:53,063
He's lying.
He's fucking lying.

420
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:56,466
Listen, I just got off
the phone with the police

421
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,168
and called off the search.

422
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:00,203
This is not the first time
that this has happened...

423
01:02:00,337 --> 01:02:01,471
- He's crazy.
- Get back.

424
01:02:01,605 --> 01:02:03,273
Get back.
Over there.

425
01:02:03,407 --> 01:02:05,642
I'm sorry, sir.
W... what's your name?

426
01:02:05,776 --> 01:02:06,810
Robert.

427
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:09,513
I can't begin to thank you
for what you've done.

428
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:11,315
Now that he's seen you,

429
01:02:11,448 --> 01:02:14,151
he's never gonna let you
out of here alive, never.

430
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:17,154
Jessica, that is
enough for today.

431
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:19,456
Come on.

432
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:21,859
If you could just help me
get her in the car first.

433
01:02:22,192 --> 01:02:24,963
No, no! No!

434
01:02:25,262 --> 01:02:27,999
No! Help me!

435
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:29,232
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

436
01:02:29,366 --> 01:02:30,701
- Help me!
- You're okay.

437
01:02:30,902 --> 01:02:33,004
Can you give me a hand?

438
01:02:33,136 --> 01:02:34,438
- Ask for his phone!
- What?

439
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:36,473
- Stop.
- Ask for his fucking phone!

440
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:38,442
- Let me just...
- No!

441
01:02:38,642 --> 01:02:41,111
Ask for his phone
and call the police!

442
01:02:41,244 --> 01:02:44,181
No, no!

443
01:02:44,414 --> 01:02:46,017
- Excuse me.
- What?

444
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,318
Can I borrow
your phone, please?

445
01:02:48,452 --> 01:02:50,821
Fuck! Ouch!

446
01:02:51,521 --> 01:02:52,623
You stop!

447
01:02:56,593 --> 01:02:58,863
- Could you grab her, please?
- No, she's right.

448
01:02:59,496 --> 01:03:00,697
I need to call the police

449
01:03:00,831 --> 01:03:02,366
and make sure
everything checks out.

450
01:03:02,499 --> 01:03:03,767
It's... it's gonna make me
feel a lot better.

451
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:05,802
Okay, but could you
please just help me

452
01:03:05,937 --> 01:03:06,938
get her in the car first?

453
01:03:07,071 --> 01:03:07,972
Phone.

454
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,508
- You want to see my phone?
- Yes.

455
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:16,213
Sure, if that's gonna
make you feel better.

456
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,915
Here you go.

457
01:03:18,815 --> 01:03:22,386
Watch out!

458
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:25,188
Stop!

459
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:43,480
I know you're close.

460
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:49,486
I know I hit you.

461
01:07:57,794 --> 01:08:00,497
I give you about two hours...

462
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:03,433
before you bleed to death.

463
01:08:10,473 --> 01:08:13,010
Soon the cramps will set in...

464
01:08:16,613 --> 01:08:18,815
spreading through your body...

465
01:08:21,953 --> 01:08:24,521
and then the rot will start.

466
01:08:30,294 --> 01:08:33,898
Why don't you come out
and fight while you still can?

467
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:39,769
Yeah, I'll play fair.

468
01:09:00,191 --> 01:09:01,892
It's loaded.

469
01:09:06,397 --> 01:09:09,666
You have one minute...

470
01:09:11,735 --> 01:09:13,170
to try and grab it...

471
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:16,606
starting...

472
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:18,708
now.

473
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,982
Are you too scared?

474
01:09:27,684 --> 01:09:30,187
You know the one thing
I can't stand?

475
01:09:34,025 --> 01:09:35,092
Cowards!

476
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:43,666
Just like that husband
of yours.

477
01:09:45,668 --> 01:09:48,139
Why did he kill himself anyway?

478
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:51,608
Was he too weak?

479
01:09:54,378 --> 01:09:55,379
You know...

480
01:09:56,247 --> 01:09:59,316
people who are thinking
about killing themselves...

481
01:10:01,751 --> 01:10:05,688
They usually cry out for help.

482
01:10:07,557 --> 01:10:11,429
They send these subtle signals

483
01:10:11,561 --> 01:10:13,830
to their family and friends.

484
01:10:15,598 --> 01:10:19,103
That must just really
tear you apart.

485
01:10:26,077 --> 01:10:27,211
Knowing...

486
01:10:28,711 --> 01:10:30,147
that he...

487
01:10:34,684 --> 01:10:37,188
probably tried to tell you.

488
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:44,794
That guilt must be
something else.

489
01:10:49,533 --> 01:10:54,071
He was supposed to be
the father of your children,

490
01:10:54,271 --> 01:10:55,805
and now...

491
01:10:56,874 --> 01:11:00,144
he's rotting
in some grave somewhere.

492
01:11:06,417 --> 01:11:08,319
All that sorrow...

493
01:11:10,387 --> 01:11:11,754
all that guilt...

494
01:11:14,225 --> 01:11:17,394
would drive me nuts
if I were you.

495
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:23,267
Completely fucking nuts.

496
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:30,875
He was a coward.

497
01:11:33,878 --> 01:11:36,347
I know fear when I see it.

498
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,183
It's all in the eyes!

499
01:11:40,783 --> 01:11:43,087
It's all in the fucking eyes!

500
01:11:51,428 --> 01:11:53,497
People think they can hide it,

501
01:11:53,631 --> 01:11:54,965
but they can't!

502
01:11:55,566 --> 01:11:57,168
Not from me!

503
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:02,940
Prove to me that I'm wrong!

504
01:12:04,508 --> 01:12:06,877
Show me some fucking guts!

505
01:12:08,212 --> 01:12:10,281
Show me you're just
a little bit better

506
01:12:10,414 --> 01:12:12,983
than that shitbag husband
of yours!

507
01:12:17,555 --> 01:12:19,056
Do you hear me?

508
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:28,199
Do you fucking hear me?

509
01:12:32,835 --> 01:12:34,538
I'm gonna get you,

510
01:12:34,672 --> 01:12:37,174
you delicious fucking bitch!

511
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,882
I'm coming for you.

512
01:12:49,486 --> 01:12:52,223
I am coming for you.

513
01:18:41,738 --> 01:18:43,240
Come on.

514
01:23:25,223 --> 01:23:27,091
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

515
01:23:27,225 --> 01:23:28,725
Help me.

516
01:23:29,826 --> 01:23:30,760
<i>Hello?</i>

517
01:23:31,329 --> 01:23:33,331
Help me.

518
01:23:33,463 --> 01:23:34,966
<i>You need to speak up.</i>

519
01:23:36,499 --> 01:23:38,368
There's a man in glasses.

520
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:39,971
I've been kidnapped.

521
01:23:40,137 --> 01:23:42,139
<i>I'm sorry.
Can you repeat that?</i>

522
01:23:43,107 --> 01:23:46,376
He's going to kill me.
He's gonna kill me.

523
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:49,379
- <i>Who's trying to...</i>
- Just trace this call.

524
01:23:49,646 --> 01:23:52,382
<i>Hello? I can't hear you.</i>

525
01:23:52,917 --> 01:23:55,752
Trace this call.

526
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:01,484
Bitch!

527
01:27:24,895 --> 01:27:28,265
Hey.

528
01:29:17,942 --> 01:29:20,411
- <i>Hi, Daddy.</i>
- Can I talk to your mom?

529
01:29:20,644 --> 01:29:21,679
<i>Who is this?</i>

530
01:29:21,946 --> 01:29:23,414
Please let me talk
to your mom.

531
01:29:24,048 --> 01:29:26,517
<i>Mom, someone wants
to talk to you.</i>

532
01:29:26,984 --> 01:29:28,352
<i>This is Catherine Dillon.</i>

533
01:29:28,485 --> 01:29:30,354
This is
your husband's phone, right?

534
01:29:30,688 --> 01:29:31,956
- <i>I'm sorry?</i>
- Right?

535
01:29:32,089 --> 01:29:33,891
<i>Yeah, but who are you?</i>

536
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:36,560
Do you know
where he is right now?

537
01:29:36,994 --> 01:29:38,596
<i>I don't know
what you're talking about...</i>

538
01:29:38,728 --> 01:29:40,130
I asked you
a fucking question.

539
01:29:41,031 --> 01:29:43,400
Do you know
where he is right now?

540
01:29:43,534 --> 01:29:45,669
<i>My husband is in California
on a business trip...</i>

541
01:29:45,802 --> 01:29:48,771
- No, he's not.
- <i>I'm...</i>

542
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:53,077
He's a kidnapper...
and a murderer.

543
01:29:53,277 --> 01:29:55,613
<i>Is this some kind of joke?
If it is...</i>

544
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:57,780
No, it's not a fucking joke!

545
01:29:58,748 --> 01:30:02,886
- <i>Sam, are you there?</i>
- You want to talk to him?

546
01:30:03,087 --> 01:30:06,090
Here, hold on a second.
I'll put him on.

547
01:30:07,558 --> 01:30:08,993
You have a phone call.

548
01:30:09,727 --> 01:30:12,129
<i>Sam, are you there?</i>

549
01:30:14,198 --> 01:30:17,668
<i>Sam...
what the hell is going on?</i>

550
01:30:17,935 --> 01:30:20,504
<i>Sam?
Talk to me.</i>

551
01:30:20,904 --> 01:30:22,940
My name is Jessica Swanson...

552
01:30:25,109 --> 01:30:27,344
and if this is the last time
you hear from me,

553
01:30:28,045 --> 01:30:30,180
it's because your husband
killed me,

554
01:30:31,115 --> 01:30:33,284
just like he killed a man
named Robert.

555
01:30:34,451 --> 01:30:36,453
People are probably looking
for him, too.

556
01:30:36,854 --> 01:30:38,088
<i>Sam!</i>

557
01:30:38,589 --> 01:30:41,225
Go on. Go on!

558
01:30:42,593 --> 01:30:43,961
Talk to your wife!

559
01:30:44,895 --> 01:30:46,897
<i>Sam, are you there?</i>

560
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:52,069
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

561
01:30:53,037 --> 01:30:55,306
I just need
to take care of something.

562
01:30:55,838 --> 01:30:58,942
<i>Are you there? Sam!</i>

563
01:31:00,778 --> 01:31:03,247
<i>Sam, are you there?</i>

564
01:31:03,813 --> 01:31:05,115
<i>Sam!</i>

565
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,017
Bye.

566
01:34:11,522 --> 01:34:16,522
