00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,671
Good morning,

00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,839
That was
"A-Billion-and-One Strings,"

3
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,974
playing one of
your favorite tunes.

4
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,143
At the top of the news
this morning...

5
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,551
there's monkey
business in Utah.

6
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,715
A band of renegade
chimpanzees...

7
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,554
have kidnapped Pulitzer prize-winning
poet Lester Charles.

8
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,119
What's the big idea?
I'm attempting to sleep!!

9
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,461
I doing a broadcasting.
Do you mind?

10
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,400
Whoa,
not in the face!

11
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,166
Uh, the chimps
are protesting...

12
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,402
I've got a mind to reset
your alarm... permanently!

13
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,774
Sorry, folks.

14
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,006
We're experiencing
technical difficulty...

15
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,310
but it's nothing
we can't handle!!

16
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,374
This just in.

17
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,045
Domestic violence erupts
in peaceful cottage!

18
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,180
We'll keep
you post...

19
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,588
Whew!

20
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,856
Can't hear your own thoughts
with all the racket.

21
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,430
Holy mother of Edison!
What were you thinking?

22
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,561
You might have
broken my bulb!

23
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,733
I'm thinking you think too much.
We need wake-up music.

24
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,675
So when it's raining

25
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,076
Have no regrets

26
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,741
Because it isn't raining
rain you know

27
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,875
It's raining violets

28
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,762
Blah!

29
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,169
Va-rooooom!

30
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,516
I'll track you to
the end of this carpet.

31
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,492
Come here.
I'm going to get you.

32
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,086
Wait till I fix
your speaker!!

33
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,394
Rusetti picks it up
and throws.

34
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,027
Cepeda tags,
he heads for second.

35
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,435

my plugs on you!

The crowd goes wild.

37
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,540

[Lamp]
I've got you.

39
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,811
I've got you now.

40
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,784
Ha, ha, ha.

41
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,787
Come here.

42
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,619
You dare to cross foils...

43
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,092
with the greatest Saxon
swordsman in the land?

44
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,959
[Radio]
Have you any inkling who you're dealing with?

45
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,659
[Lamp]
Precisely. A total idiot.

46
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,065
[Radio]
If your saber wags as loosely as your tongue...

47
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,400
you'll be run through
in an instant.

48
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,929
Defend yourself,
Sir Lampy of Locksley.

49
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,909
- A blow for Richard!
- Ouch!

50
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,946
- A blow for Marian!
- Ouch!

51
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,881
- A blow for Mario, the garbage man.
- Ouch!

52
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,714
And for the boys
at the delicatessen.

53
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,688
And here's one for
the guys on 5th Street.

54
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,690
No!

55
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,558
Whoa! Ugh!

56
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,369
What's going on?
Who turned out the lights?

57
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,836
Good morning.

58
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,998
Good morning,
Toaster.

59
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,542
- Hey, slots.
- Salutations!

60
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,543
Umph!

61
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,974
- Thanks.
- What's on our lineup today?

62
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,044
What are our
instructions?

63
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,181
What are we
gonna do today?

64
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,657
The same thing we've done
for the last 2,000 days.

65
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,160
Chores!

66
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,492
- Chores?
- It'll be fun.

67
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,623
I'm always
up for fun!

68
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,963
Listen, a broadcast
from Ebbets Field!

69
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,265
It's the top
of the ninth...

70
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,965
I don't understand
how chores could be fun.

71
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,476
Not supposed to be fun.
It's work!

72
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,535
I don't like to work
without the Master.

73
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,547
Well, okay.

74
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,413
If you don't want to work,
why don't we play a game?

75
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,545
- What sort of game?
- What are the rules?

76
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,555
There's only one rule.

77
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,921
You can't stop till
the house is clean.

78
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,426
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
- Boo!!

82
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,796

bebop blaster...

I hate being left

that it wasn't him.

Let's get back
to work.

- In the garbage!

- You can't!
- Wimp!

- Let go!
- He's not coming back anyway.

laughing at?

Absolutely nothing,
nothing at all.

laughing at us.

come romping back...

just come whistling
back through that door...

177
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,903

will be the same...

- Uh-huh.
- It's a possibility.

180
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,737
Well, at least we
try to be optimistic.

181
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,803
Optimistic?

in this guy's cord.

Why don't you
just shut off?

184
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,077
I'm real scared, Kirby.

185
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,350
Are you going
to suck me to death?

186
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,120
- Hmph!
- What is it with you?

187
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,662
You act like you just came
off the assembly line.

your chrome.

189
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,096

abandoned.

190
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,499
- But he loved us.
- That's right.

191
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,733
So what?
He has a family.

192
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,071

It's a package deal.

193

He's not coming back,
pure and simple.

195
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,511
Did you talk to him?

196
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,846
They could drive up
any second.

197
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,078
You really think so?

198
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,747
I'm not talking to you.

of five, maybe less.

It's scrap metal time.

202

You're gonna get me bawling
like a baby any time now.

204

I think
you're jealous.

205
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,206
Sure, I'm jealous of
a bunch of dimwits.

- Dim?
- Yeah!

207
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,269
The Master never
played with you.

208
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,407
Because you're
stuck in the wall!

209
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:52,954
So, it's back to that
stupid static again.

210
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,825
You think I don't know
what's going on in here?

211
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,456
I know what goes on
in this cottage.

212
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,726
It's a conspiracy...

213
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,861
and every one of you
low-watts is in on it.

214
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,906
Just because
you move around...

215
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,237

better than I am.

219
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,849

to reach my dials!

really.

about cars.

00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,737

- What do you mean?

00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:13,496
Exactly
what I said.

We're gonna go out

No matter what!

How would you propose we're
gonna do that, exactly?

00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:40,015
Maybe it was
a basset hound.

You're all insane!

257
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:45,085
It was a news flash
I picked up about a dog.

In an amazing show
of loyalty and courage...

259
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:50,160
a terrier named Grover
traveled hundreds of miles...

260
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,260
to be reunited
with his owner.

261
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:56,135
The poor critter was
accidentally left behind...

262
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:58,732
on a fishing trip
three weeks ago.

263
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,369
He had to find his way
across rugged mountains...

264
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:04,380
and scorching deserts
in order to get home.

265
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:07,975
Little Grover turned out
to be one spunky pup.

If a dog can do it,
we can do it!

357
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:09,370
Head says you should stay

358
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:11,471
But your heart says to begin

359
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:14,016
So you go

360
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:16,882
But you don't
want to go

361
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,956
Any life worth living

362
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,049
Isn't life just
filled with ease

363
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,560
You just stay forgiving

364
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:26,619
Through the forests
and the trees

365
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:29,165
And you'll go

366
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:33,563
Just where you want to go

367
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:39,542
Time flies by
in the city of light

368
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,444
Time stands still
in the country

369
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:47,678
There's no time
for a fuss and a fight

370
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:51,517
As we travel the land

371
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:53,522
And I'd
be satisfied

372
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,524
Just to be
not denied

373
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:58,220
To reside with some pride

374
00:24:58,295 --> 00:25:00,820
While I ride to the city

375
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:03,492
The city of light

376
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:12,368
Light shines like a diamond
in the city at night

377
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:14,376
When that
diamond shines

378
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:16,378
You know that
everything's all right

379
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:19,006
But you know

380
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:23,577
We got a way to go

381
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:27,022
Let us meet the Master

382
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,183
We don't want
to make him wait

383
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:32,626
You just keep a-knocking
he will open up the gate

384
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:35,961
To that city of light

385
00:25:41,605 --> 00:25:45,371
Master is a man
with a plan I can understand

386
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:49,776
Master is a man
of great reflection

387
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:53,339
Master is a man who lays
his hand across the land

388
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,716
Master is a man
of our affection

389
00:25:56,787 --> 00:26:00,279
Time flies by
in the city of light

390
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:04,384
Time stands still
in the country

391
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:08,329
There's no time for
a fuss and a fight

392
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:11,890
As we travel the land

393
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:14,267
And I'd
be satisfied

394
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:16,272
Just to be

395
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,274
To reside
with some pride

396
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:22,073
While I ride
to the city

397
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:24,170
The city of light

398
00:26:54,978 --> 00:26:57,947
Hey, everybody.
Look!

399
00:26:58,015 --> 00:27:01,348
- A clearing!
- Great.

400
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:04,216
Spread out the blanket
and have a picnic.

401
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:06,813
I'm full of stickers.

402
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,552
My bag's full of
thistles and sticks...

403
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:11,617
and who knows
what else!

404
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:14,630
Whose idea was it
to come this way?

405
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:16,632
The lamp's.

406
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,395
Oh, yeah?

407
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:21,403
Who's supposed to be
the big shot navigator...

408
00:27:21,471 --> 00:27:23,405
Mr. Loudmouth?

409
00:27:23,473 --> 00:27:25,998
Mr. Big Loudmouth.

410
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:28,806
- Yeah.
- Where are we?

411
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:30,904
Give me a second and...

412
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,915
listen to this.

413
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:35,645
It's the top of the ninth,
the bases are loaded...

414
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,687
and Pee Wee Reese
is at the plate.

415
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:40,518
There's the pitch.
He connects.

416
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,320
Oh, and it's a triple play.

417
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:45,293
Knock it off!

418
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:47,330
We should all
settle down...

419
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:49,422
and try to get
some sleep.

420
00:27:56,506 --> 00:27:58,531
This is my sleeping space.

421
00:27:58,608 --> 00:28:00,542
Nobody crosses this line.

422
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,807
You better not wake us
up at 6:00 as usual.

423
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,941
- Why are you complaining?
You didn't work today.
- Yeah.

424
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:13,481
Go find your own place
to sleep, fuzz ball.

425
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:22,031
Watch it.

426
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:24,158
Are you blind?
It's a line.

427
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:26,031
Good night!

428
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:35,578
Come on,
I'm not the Master.

429
00:28:35,645 --> 00:28:38,409
Go snuggle
somewhere else.

430
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:41,383
I'm trying to
get some sleep.

431
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:43,817
Go on.

432
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:54,928
[Sigh]

433
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:26,991
Help!
Don't leave me.

434
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,333
Listen, listen.
What's that?

Oh, look!

00:29:56,793 --> 00:29:59,353

I see light!

00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:56,085
That's the same
riff I used...

449
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:58,087
when I was drumming
for Cab Calloway.

450
00:30:58,155 --> 00:31:00,146
Like this.

451
00:31:00,223 --> 00:31:02,157
Cut that out!

Whoa!

459
00:32:30,847 --> 00:32:33,077

No, no.

464
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:03,845
It's just a reflection.

465
00:33:03,913 --> 00:33:05,881
I'm not a flower.

Come on, help me.
They're killing me.

469
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,397
Leave him alone!

470
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,731
Stop it.
Give me that.

471
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:13,514
He was chewing
on the Master.

472
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,744
Time to go.

473
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:18,788
Bye.

Are you sure this is the right direction?

As sure as I am honest.

Then we're definitely lost.

Waa-waa!

What's the matter,

481
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,611
Battery's running low.

482
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,772
We should
give it a rest.

483
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,474
Turn out that light.

00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:05,795
Do we have
to stop here?

486
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:07,796
Only for a while.

487
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:09,991
Just long enough
to lose our minds.

00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,365
We'll be cannibals
within a few days.

we can stay here.

were a goner.

You wish.

497
00:36:37,794 --> 00:36:41,423

some kind of shelter.

Good night, America,

That's all right.

So, what's this thing
with you and the blanket?

515
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,076
What thing?

516
00:38:06,149 --> 00:38:10,313
All of a sudden you're
being so darn nice to him.

517
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,823
I was just thinking,
and I got this feeling...

518
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,155
that I should be nicer
to him for a change.

519
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:19,218
And now
I feel better.

520
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:21,958
- That's weird.
- What's weird about it?

521
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:25,593
You were never
this nice to him before...

00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:28,695
and now you're nice
to him all the time.

I don't know.

00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:34,232
I'm just trying to understand,
figure out what it means.

525
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,609
It's kinda
hard to describe.

to a new loaf of bread.

Hmm, let's see.

00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:50,849

toasty feeling inside.

00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,760
- A glow?
- Yeah.

00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:59,268
I think I know what
you're talking about.

"It's over.
I'm burned out.

537
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:20,156
Eighty-sixed.
To the showers!!"

538
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:24,626
But then the Master
put in a brand-new bulb.

539
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,893
And I just glowed.

540
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:33,192
That's all
there is to it.

541
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:37,297
That's very interesting.

542
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:39,774
Good night, slot head.

543
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,338
Good night.

544
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,392
Blah.

545
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,333
Ahh.

546
00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:37,963
Run.

547
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:54,713
[Wicked Laughter]

548
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,093
[Thunder]

549
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:14,498
Aahh. Help me!

550
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:16,869
Help me!

551
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:19,772
Toaster!

552
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:22,710
Blanky!!

553
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:28,280
- Blanky?
- Blanky!

554
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,444
Where are you?

555
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,545
- Blanky?
- Blanky!!

556
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:35,785
- Blanket!
- Can you hear me?

557
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:43,690
The battery's
gone dead!

558
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,826
We're trapped
like rats...

559
00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:48,234
small rats with
no hair and one light.

560
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:50,238
Blanky!

561
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:55,401
- Blanket!!
- Blanky!!

562
00:41:57,714 --> 00:42:00,342
Where are you,
you little wimp?

563
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:06,945
Blanky!!

564
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,574
Lampy!

565
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,770
Blanky?

566
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:01,675
Where are you?

567
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:06,045
Blan...

568
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,516
...keey?

569
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:12,351
Come on, Blanky,
speak up!

570
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,225
Just relax.

571
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:19,523
You've done enough.
We'll look for him.

572
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:21,894
I am feeling
burned out.

573
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:23,432
Listen.

574
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,627
Lamp was awarded
a Purple Heart...

575
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:27,761
for being wounded
in the line of duty.

576
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:29,896
Lamps across the nation
were switched off...

577
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:34,410
for a moment of silence
in respect for his bravery.

578
00:43:34,477 --> 00:43:36,274
Help.

579
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:39,281
- Listen.
- Help me.

580
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:42,910
Toaster, Kirby,
I'm stuck.

581
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:46,387
- I hear him.
- But I can't see him.

582
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:48,890
Maybe he's calling
from blanket heaven.

583
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:52,450
He's a puffy yellow angel,
with a knob nose.

584
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,794
He's just stuck,
that's all. Look!

585
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:00,392
Help.

586
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:13,415
[Toaster]
Hang on tight.

587
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:15,178
I am.

588
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:18,277
[Radio]
Don't let the tremendous height scare you.

589
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:26,091
Hey, watch out.
Come on.

590
00:44:26,162 --> 00:44:28,824
I can't see.
Get off.

591
00:44:30,366 --> 00:44:32,630
Watch out below!!

592
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:37,939
That was
kind of fun.

593
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:39,941
Now get off
of my face!

594
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:42,876
- Thanks, Kirby.
- Great idea.

595
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,880
You saved me.

596
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,473
I knight thee
"Sir Vac."

597
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,040
Cut it out.

598
00:44:49,118 --> 00:44:51,348
I did it
so we could go.

599
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:53,514
We're wasting time.

600
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,867
[Thunderous Noise]

601
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:08,199
What's this?
What's...

602
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:11,570
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

603
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:18,004
Kirby, no!

604
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,015
Get the cord
out of his mouth!

605
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,051
Don't let him
swallow it.

606
00:45:22,118 --> 00:45:24,052
Switch him off.

607
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,561
Just shorted right out.

608
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,499
Cracked up, snapped,
sold the farm.

609
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:42,402
- Poor chump.
- How's he look?

610
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:44,406
Better than you,
actually.

611
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:46,408
Keep it up, slots.

612
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:48,535
Carpet-sweeping motions.

613
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:50,875
He should
come around.

614
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:53,438
Hey, I think
it's working.

615
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:57,213
Kirby, can
you hear me?

616
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:00,723
Wake up.
Wake up!

617
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,850
- Kirby!
- You're all right.

618
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,189
Yeah!

619
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:09,664
Lay off.
Just lay off!

620
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:13,224
- What's the matter?
- We were worried.

621
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,396
You gave us
a scare, pal.

622
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:18,235
There's nothing wrong
with me, pal!

623
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:21,072
- Just back off!
- Don't be angry.

624
00:46:21,144 --> 00:46:23,977
Keep your antennas,
knobs, and wires...

625
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,311
and rivets
off my chrome!

626
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:28,316
Who needs you?

627
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:31,615
Got to drag you
around all the time.

628
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,622
I'd be better off
without you.

629
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,816
But...

630
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:37,325
Especially you,
you little rag.

631
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:44,796
So how do we get across
this thing, anyway?

632
00:46:48,604 --> 00:46:50,629
Houdini did this once.

633
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,335
He was out of the hospital
in no time.

634
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:55,240
That's encouraging.

635
00:46:57,647 --> 00:47:00,138
Okay, Kirby.

636
00:47:21,437 --> 00:47:23,701
Hey, we're not dead.

637
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:26,708
Yeah? Where's some wood
to knock on?

638
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:28,767
Toaster, you okay?

639
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:31,336
Toaster?

640
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:35,680
Yeah, I am.

641
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,277
Give me some slack.

642
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:41,515
Oh.

643
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,827
Wha...

644
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:51,423
Agh.

645
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,526
Aaahhhh!

646
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:23,261
Yeowwww!

647
00:48:33,776 --> 00:48:36,210
Help! Help!

648
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,984
Damn thee,
thou cursed whale!!

649
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,359
From the depths of hell
I stab at thee.

650
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,297
- Climb on, you idiot.
- Oh, it's you.

651
00:48:57,366 --> 00:48:59,357
Where's Toaster?

652
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:01,369
He sank.

653
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,089
Are we glad
to see you!

654
00:49:20,156 --> 00:49:23,455
I really thought I'd
turned in my warranty.

655
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:25,585
Yeah, until
baggy showed up.

656
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:28,289
I just slipped and
fell in, that's all.

657
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:31,891
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Sure!

658
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,596
You can't fool us.
We love you.

659
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,230
Like Mrs. Roosevelt
loved her husband.

660
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:40,571
Here's the shore.
Everybody off.

661
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:43,874
Listen to this!
This is President Roosevelt...

662
00:49:43,946 --> 00:49:46,414
awarding the vacuum
the Medal of Honor.

663
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:48,416
Blah!

664
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:51,146
Ha, ha!
That's funny.

665
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,154
I'm dying.

666
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:56,191
Where are we?

667
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:03,924
I can't
believe this.

668
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,195
I'm really sorry.

669
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,430
Oh, come on.

670
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:11,098
It's not your fault.

671
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,405
Things could be worse,
you know.

672
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:16,570
- How?
- How what?

673
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,637
How could
they be worse?

674
00:50:18,714 --> 00:50:21,182
They couldn't.
I lied.

675
00:50:38,267 --> 00:50:40,201
Can't you find anything?

676
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:42,669
I'm lucky my backup
batteries work at all.

677
00:50:42,738 --> 00:50:45,434
I hope we're not
going in circles.

678
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:47,703
Come on.

679
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,214
Aaah!

680
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:03,588
I knew I shouldn't
have let you guys drive.

681
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:05,752
Come on, pull!

682
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,997
Kirby!

683
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,329
This is great fun.

684
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,426
Let's make these outings
a regular thing, okay?

685
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:16,767
Inflate your bag!

686
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:19,774
Help me!

687
00:51:19,842 --> 00:51:21,434
Aaah!

688
00:51:22,545 --> 00:51:25,981
Wow, the poor guy
didn't have a chance.

689
00:51:26,048 --> 00:51:28,516
Just ssss,
and that's it.

690
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:32,020
Don't look now, but you're
about to ssss yourself!

691
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:34,750
What? Whoa!

692
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:38,316
Blanky, let go.
Try to untie yourself.

693
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:41,295
I'm not scared.

694
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:49,163
Well, that concludes
our broadcast today.

695
00:51:49,238 --> 00:51:51,433
Actually, it concludes...

696
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:53,907
all future broadcasting
of any sort.

697
00:51:53,976 --> 00:51:57,503
We'll sign off now
with a suitable tune!

698
00:51:58,481 --> 00:52:00,574
Mammy

699
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,313
Mammy, Mammy
I'm coming

700
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,753
Oh l...

701
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:09,290
I hope I didn't
make you wait

702
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:11,656
Mammy
I'm coming

703
00:52:12,728 --> 00:52:14,855
O, Lord

704
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,202
Ha, I thought
I heard a radio!

705
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,032
Whoa!

706
00:52:24,106 --> 00:52:25,539
Hmmm.

707
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:28,133
Do-dilly
yup-bup-bup

708
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:31,441
Upsy-daisy!

709
00:52:31,514 --> 00:52:33,812
Whoop!!
There you go!!

710
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,589
Good boy, Quadruped.

711
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:49,790
You remembered
your seat belt.

712
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:38,112
Ahh.

713
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,975
[Ding-Ding]

714
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:44,986
A customer!

715
00:53:47,823 --> 00:53:50,758
Seems like a nice fella.
Dingy, but nice.

716
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:52,794
Heh-heh-heh!!

717
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,921
Heh-heh-heh!

quite an amusing fellow...

00:53:57,967 --> 00:53:59,867
isn't he?

720
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,835
Oh, you poor baby.

Here, you can have
one of mine.

723

Use it in good health...

Hello, compadre...

727
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,648
I am in deep need
of a blender motor.

728
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:26,024
Ha, ha!
A blender motor?

729
00:54:26,095 --> 00:54:30,293
I got a whole shipment
ofblender motors in last week.

Heaven sent you to me.

731
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:36,504
I'll have it for you in
2 shakes of a lamb's tail.

732
00:54:36,572 --> 00:54:40,668
Now what did I do
with that blender?

733
00:54:40,743 --> 00:54:44,179
I could've sworn I left
it here a second ago.

734
00:54:44,246 --> 00:54:46,680
I'm getting as
loopy as a polecat...

735
00:54:46,749 --> 00:54:48,683
without any whiskers.

736
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:53,121
There you are!
I found you.

737
00:54:54,156 --> 00:54:56,488
Gotta move you guys
out of the way.

Heh-heh-heh!!

You never quite know
what he's going to do.

746
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:05,750
He's so spontaneous.

747
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:08,592
W-w-well,
how do we escape?

748
00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:10,655
Did you
hear that?

749
00:56:10,733 --> 00:56:13,201
They want to know
how to escape!

You must be

What's that sound
Is someone moving 'round

755

Sit down for a spell
You don't look so well

Wait a minute
I feel great

757

yourself to fate

just hang around

the missus loved the blender motor.

802
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:30,257
Was wondering if you got
some radio tubes, too.

803
00:59:30,332 --> 00:59:31,765
Sure.

804
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:35,031
I got a whole shipment of
radio tubes in this morning.

805
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:38,369
You gotta help me.
I'll do anything!

Now what did I do
with that radio?

I could swear I left
it right here...

in this very,
very spot.

811
00:59:54,189 --> 00:59:57,386
What did it do,
get up and walk away?

00:59:57,459 --> 01:00:00,223

drink more coffee.

let them in?

to enter, all of ya.

into those big blue eyes.

It was you who
killed Johnson.

and you killed him.

01:06:00,388 --> 01:06:02,413
Then you tried
to get me.

It's your turn,

Now you're
taking the fall.

There was a shot!
A puff of smoke!

Well, something like that.

And all on
your own, too.

How convenient.

01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:23,834
I mean...

898
01:06:23,912 --> 01:06:26,472
- Remarkable.
- Yeah.

899
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:29,714
Junkyard refugees...

900
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:32,446
- in this house.
- What's the world coming to?

901
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,115
I wouldn't sew a stitch
on that raggedy blanket.

902
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:37,920
If you could
call it a blanket.

903
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:40,621
- Looks like an old diaper.
- It smells.

904
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:43,721
- It's raggedy.
- Get that thing away from me.

905
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:46,392
- Did someone wash that thing?
- No.

906
01:06:46,468 --> 01:06:48,698
Yuck.
I'm nauseous.

907
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:52,399
Oh, how do you do?

908
01:06:52,474 --> 01:06:55,375
How do you do?

909
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:03,308
Hey, look at this!!

910
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,859
Boy!!

911
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,895
He sure has grown.

912
01:07:13,962 --> 01:07:16,294
What a heartbreaker!

913
01:07:16,364 --> 01:07:18,525
He graduated, too!

914
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,535
Of course!
He knows how to work hard.

915
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:23,696
He's all big now.

916
01:07:23,772 --> 01:07:27,538
- I hope he still needs us.
- Still needs you?

917
01:07:27,609 --> 01:07:30,134
That's the silliest thing
I ever heard!

918
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,010
If it isn't
old rabbit ears!

919
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:35,709
If it isn't
old loudmouth!

920
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:38,344
- Hi, TV!
- How ya doing?

921
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,650
I've got a few
more seasons left.

922
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:43,919
The cottage wasn't the same
after they took you away.

923
01:07:43,992 --> 01:07:46,324
Yeah,
it wasn't as noisy.

924
01:07:46,394 --> 01:07:48,362
I see you
haven't changed.

925
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,421
Kind of gives you
a sense of security.

926
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:52,432
[Blanky]
Where's the Master?

927
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,491
[TV]
No one told you?

928
01:07:54,569 --> 01:07:57,504
Is he gonna be surprised
when he gets back!

929
01:07:57,572 --> 01:08:00,097
He just left to
drive out to the...

930

[Speaking Spanish]

931
01:08:05,146 --> 01:08:07,979
- Hey!
- What's the idea?

932
01:08:08,049 --> 01:08:10,244
Oh, many pardons.

933
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:13,151
Was you watching
that channel?

934
01:08:13,221 --> 01:08:15,917
Come on in.

935
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,789
It's the greatest,
isn't it?

936
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,988
You guys sure did some weird
stuff with your furniture.

937
01:08:27,135 --> 01:08:29,262
What happened?

938
01:08:29,337 --> 01:08:31,999
This is... Gee!

939
01:08:32,073 --> 01:08:35,201
Somebody trashed
the whole cottage!

940
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,211
You big dumbo.

941
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,509
Didn't you lock
the doors?

942
01:08:39,614 --> 01:08:42,105
I don't believe
I've ever seen...

943
01:08:42,183 --> 01:08:44,310
quite so many
smiles before.

944
01:08:44,385 --> 01:08:47,115
I've never seen
contraptions with so many...

945
01:08:47,188 --> 01:08:50,646
buttons and knobs
and dials before.

946
01:08:50,725 --> 01:08:52,750
Naturally.

947
01:08:52,827 --> 01:08:55,694
We are on the cutting edge
of technology.

948
01:08:55,763 --> 01:08:58,493
- Wow.
- What does that mean?

949
01:08:58,566 --> 01:09:01,194
I don't know.
What does that mean?

[Electronic Beeps]

951
01:09:14,081 --> 01:09:16,015
Since you came here
uninvited

952
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:18,017
We all knew
you'd be delighted

953
01:09:18,085 --> 01:09:20,883
This is not the time
or place to hedge

954
01:09:20,955 --> 01:09:23,116
No one here
would be so bold to

955
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:25,158
But since you asked
and no one's told you

956
01:09:25,226 --> 01:09:28,024
Let us take you
to the cutting edge

957
01:09:28,095 --> 01:09:30,461
I can process words
accounting too

You'd rather stay at home

Pop some dough boy
out for you

999
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:49,736
Where's the radio,
the lamp and blanket?

1000
01:11:49,804 --> 01:11:51,669

I'm glad the Master
has such good appliances.

1003
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,489
Yeah, couldn't get
any more modern.

1004
01:13:49,556 --> 01:13:52,252

Honey, take some of our things.

1006
01:14:22,723 --> 01:14:26,181

so cute in your dorm room.

1007
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,784
Go for it.

01:14:27,861 --> 01:14:30,386
What are you
going to read by?

1009
01:14:30,464 --> 01:14:32,398
I'll buy
some candles.

1010
01:14:32,466 --> 01:14:34,525
I won't read.
I'll go out.

1011
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:36,694
I'm not gonna
take your stuff.

1012
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:39,762
I'll just pick up a few
cheap things this afternoon.

1013
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,331
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.

1014

available now at
Ernie's Disposal.

Where's a good bargain
place around here?

1017
01:14:49,984 --> 01:14:52,350
You should have gone
for the new stuff.

1018
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:01,727
Oh, were you
in line first?

1019
01:15:01,795 --> 01:15:03,820
After you,
of course!

01:15:03,897 --> 01:15:05,831
Pardon me!

1021
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:23,216
I can't take this
kind of pressure

1022
01:15:23,283 --> 01:15:25,274
I must confess

1023
01:15:25,352 --> 01:15:27,286
One more dusty road

1024
01:15:27,354 --> 01:15:29,481
Would just be
a road too long

1025
01:15:30,858 --> 01:15:33,725
Worthless

1026
01:15:33,794 --> 01:15:35,762
I just can't
I just can't

1027
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:37,797
I just can't seem
to get started

1028
01:15:37,865 --> 01:15:40,527
I don't have the heart
to live in the fast lane

1029
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:43,968
All that is past
and gone

1030
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:48,666
Worthless

1031
01:15:48,742 --> 01:15:51,267
And there ain't nothing
you can do about it!

1032
01:15:52,312 --> 01:15:54,644
Pardon me
while I panic!

1033
01:15:54,715 --> 01:15:57,183

Worthless

1034
01:15:57,251 --> 01:15:59,981
Worthless

1035
01:16:00,054 --> 01:16:02,921
No, that place
is too expensive.

1036
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:04,924
Cheap!

1037
01:16:04,992 --> 01:16:07,119
We're talking
real cheap!

1038
01:16:07,194 --> 01:16:09,719
What about Rooney's
down on 53rd?

1039
01:16:09,797 --> 01:16:12,994
They've got used
vacuums and junk.

1040
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:15,092
This just in.

1041
01:16:15,169 --> 01:16:17,330
Rooney's vacuums
found to be...

1042
01:16:17,404 --> 01:16:20,100
carcinogenic in
recent lab tests!

1043
01:16:20,174 --> 01:16:22,642
Big, big tumors
on those rats.

1044
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:24,802
We've got photos
to prove it...

1045
01:16:24,878 --> 01:16:26,846
and I don't even
want to look at them.

1046
01:16:26,914 --> 01:16:29,712
I come from
K.C., Missouri

1047
01:16:29,783 --> 01:16:32,149
And I got my kicks
on Route 66

1048
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:35,848
Every truck stop
from Butte to M.O.

1049
01:16:35,923 --> 01:16:38,858
Motown to old Alabama

1050
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:42,925
From Texarkana
and east of Savannah

1051
01:16:42,996 --> 01:16:45,897
From Tampa
to old Kokomo

1052
01:16:48,836 --> 01:16:51,396
Worthless

1053
01:16:51,472 --> 01:16:53,906
I once ran
the Indy 500

1054
01:16:56,777 --> 01:16:59,371
I must confess
I'm impressed how I did

1055
01:16:59,446 --> 01:17:01,710
And I wonder how close
that I came

1056
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:05,612
Now I get
a second sensation

1057
01:17:05,686 --> 01:17:07,620
I was the top
of the line

1058
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:09,622
Out of sight
out of mind

1059
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,749
So much for
fortune and fame

1060
01:17:11,825 --> 01:17:14,453
A bargain
in every buck!

1061
01:17:14,528 --> 01:17:17,019
A buck in
every pocket!

1062
01:17:17,097 --> 01:17:19,998
A pocket in,
uh, every trouser!

1063
01:17:20,067 --> 01:17:22,001
Ernie's Bargain Circus...

1064
01:17:22,069 --> 01:17:24,663
where you ride
the Ferris wheel of values...

1065
01:17:24,738 --> 01:17:26,672
toward a better tomorrow.

1066
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,368
Once took a Texan
to a wedding

1067
01:17:29,443 --> 01:17:32,105
Once took a Texan
to a wedding

1068
01:17:32,179 --> 01:17:34,272
He kept forgetting
his loneliness

1069
01:17:34,348 --> 01:17:37,181
Letting his thoughts
turn to home and return

1070
01:17:38,919 --> 01:17:41,513
I took a man
to a graveyard

1071
01:17:41,588 --> 01:17:44,148
I beg your pardon
It's quite hard enough

1072
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:47,250
Just living with the stuff
I have learned

1073
01:17:49,463 --> 01:17:51,397
Worthless

1074
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:56,568
Let's go cruising and
see what we can find.

1075
01:17:58,005 --> 01:18:01,099
Why wander endlessly through
the sprawling wasteland...

1076
01:18:01,175 --> 01:18:03,166
they call the city...

1077
01:18:03,243 --> 01:18:05,541
when your dreams
are all under one roof?

1078
01:18:05,612 --> 01:18:08,410
Our roof,
corner of 3rd and E.

1079
01:18:08,482 --> 01:18:12,976
Crazy Ernie's
Amazing Emporium...

1080
01:18:13,053 --> 01:18:16,250
of total
bargain madness!

1081
01:18:16,323 --> 01:18:19,019
Ha-ha-ha!

1082
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,293
Ha!

1083
01:18:22,429 --> 01:18:24,920
Have you ever heard
of this place before?

1084
01:18:24,998 --> 01:18:26,932
Looks pretty neat.

1085
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,436
Once drove
a surfer to sunset

1086
01:18:30,504 --> 01:18:32,904
There were bikinis
and buns filled with weenies

1087
01:18:32,973 --> 01:18:35,806
Fellini just
couldn't forget

1088
01:18:37,244 --> 01:18:39,940
Pico, let's go
up to Zuma

1089
01:18:40,013 --> 01:18:42,641
Pico, let's go
up to Zuma

1090
01:18:42,716 --> 01:18:44,741
From Zuma to Yuma
the rumor was

1091
01:18:44,818 --> 01:18:47,685
I had a hand
in the lay of the land

1092
01:18:49,456 --> 01:18:51,686
Get up and go
hit the highway

1093
01:19:08,842 --> 01:19:10,776
Ooo-ooo

1094
01:19:10,844 --> 01:19:13,472
I worked on
a reservation

1095
01:19:13,547 --> 01:19:14,980
Ooo-ooo

1096
01:19:15,048 --> 01:19:17,039
Who would believe
they would love me

1097
01:19:17,117 --> 01:19:20,211
And leave on a bus
back to old Santa Fe

1098
01:19:21,555 --> 01:19:24,285
Once in an
Indian nation

1099
01:19:24,358 --> 01:19:26,349
I took the kids
on the skids

1100
01:19:26,426 --> 01:19:29,395
With a Hopi was happy
to lie in the shade

1101
01:19:30,297 --> 01:19:33,755
You're worthless

1102
01:19:48,348 --> 01:19:50,475
This sure doesn't
look like...

1103
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:54,509
Crazy Ernie's Amazing Emporium
of total bargain madness.

1104
01:19:57,991 --> 01:20:00,858
- It's the right address.
- Hmm.

1105
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,273
Oh!

1106
01:20:19,546 --> 01:20:21,776
At least we'll
all go together.

1107
01:20:21,848 --> 01:20:24,646
That's looking at the
bright side, isn't it?

1108
01:20:24,718 --> 01:20:27,209
The Master's down there!

1109
01:20:27,287 --> 01:20:28,845
Look!

1110
01:20:28,922 --> 01:20:31,550
- It's him!
- What? Where?

1111
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,593
Why look,
it is him!!

1112
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,493
Maybe he still
needs us!

1113
01:20:36,563 --> 01:20:38,497
Yeah!

1114
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,848
Chris?

1115
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:57,975
Hey, these are
hard to find.

1116
01:20:58,051 --> 01:21:00,144
This is me.

1117
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:02,654
What?
I can't hear you.

1118
01:21:02,723 --> 01:21:04,714
I don't get it.

1119
01:21:15,302 --> 01:21:18,135
There he is.

1120
01:21:18,205 --> 01:21:20,298
I can't believe it.

1121
01:21:20,374 --> 01:21:22,399
Freeze.
Here he comes.

1122
01:21:28,582 --> 01:21:30,573
[Clink-Clink]

1123
01:21:35,522 --> 01:21:38,582
You jump off one side,
I'll jump off the other.

1124
01:21:38,658 --> 01:21:40,853
Okay, I got it.
Which side?

1125
01:21:40,927 --> 01:21:43,862
- Right side.
- Okay.

1126
01:21:53,173 --> 01:21:56,267
I'm glad we don't have
to do this every day.

1127
01:21:56,343 --> 01:21:57,776
Look!

1128
01:22:01,047 --> 01:22:03,174
Hey Rob,
come here.

1129
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,218
What?

1130
01:22:05,285 --> 01:22:07,719
Doggone it!

1131
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:13,518
- He's coming back.
- He'll see us this time.

1132
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,033
Run!

1133
01:22:49,463 --> 01:22:52,432
This looks just
like my old blanket.

1134
01:22:52,499 --> 01:22:54,797
I think it is
my blanket.

1135
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:01,832
That's my radio.
Hey, Chris!

1136
01:23:01,908 --> 01:23:03,808
And the lamp!

1137
01:23:03,877 --> 01:23:05,845
Hey, Chris!

1138
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:21,293
Wait a minute!

1139
01:23:21,361 --> 01:23:23,886
These are mine.
Let go!

1140
01:23:23,964 --> 01:23:26,296
Whoa!

1141
01:23:34,574 --> 01:23:37,509
Let me down!

1142
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:39,568
Aaah!

1143
01:23:50,557 --> 01:23:52,991
Chris! Help!

1144
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:55,619
Where are you?

1145
01:23:55,695 --> 01:23:57,162
Rob?

1146
01:24:02,469 --> 01:24:04,494
Chris!

1147
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:11,741
Aaah!

1148
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:37,837
Whew!

1149
01:24:37,904 --> 01:24:40,429
Would you cool it?
Get down here.

1150
01:24:40,507 --> 01:24:42,873
You're scaring me
to death.

1151
01:24:55,956 --> 01:24:57,981
Really now.

1152
01:24:58,058 --> 01:25:00,549
Why don't you just
buy a new one?

1153
01:25:00,627 --> 01:25:04,290
Where could I find another
toaster like this?

1154
01:25:04,364 --> 01:25:07,424
Like that?
Probably nowhere.

1155
01:25:11,771 --> 01:25:14,103
Ah-ha!

1156
01:25:18,445 --> 01:25:20,640
Bye, Mom.
I love you.

1157
01:25:20,714 --> 01:25:22,705
I'll call you tonight.

1158
01:25:22,782 --> 01:25:24,750
You forgot your sweater!!

1159
01:25:26,853 --> 01:25:29,321
We did good,
didn't we?

1160
01:25:29,389 --> 01:25:32,847
Yep, we did good.

1161
01:25:32,926 --> 01:25:35,258
You know,
I've been thinking.

1162
01:25:35,328 --> 01:25:38,889
This college business
seems like a good idea.

1163
01:25:38,965 --> 01:25:42,162
I can absorb a lot
of interesting facts.

1164
01:25:42,235 --> 01:25:44,965
I'm picking up a news flash!

1165
01:25:45,038 --> 01:25:48,974
President Roosevelt has declared
today a national holiday...

1166
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:53,274
in honor of those five amazing
appliances we've heard about.

1167
01:25:53,346 --> 01:25:56,144
So lock up the office,
take down the top...

1168
01:25:56,216 --> 01:25:58,343
and open that
rumble seat!

1169
01:25:58,418 --> 01:26:01,012
Last one to Coney Island
is a party pooper.

1170
01:26:01,087 --> 01:26:03,851
From the starlight roof
high atop the Ritz...

1171
01:26:03,923 --> 01:26:06,414
we wish our intrepid
little friends...

1172
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:08,552
the best of luck...

1173
01:26:08,628 --> 01:26:11,153
and a fond farewell!

1174
01:26:11,231 --> 01:26:14,200
Ah, you're all
a bunch of junk.
