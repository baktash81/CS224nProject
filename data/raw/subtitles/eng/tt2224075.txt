1
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:08,158
Hey, boss, what about Chloe?
- Right, right. Okay.

2
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:14,170
This is the epic story of
two noble chihuahuas,

3
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,107
Papi, and the love of his life, Chloe.

4
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,168
What about Uncle Pedro?
And the pups?

5
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,271
Yeah. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay.

6
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,010
This is the story of
a whole family of chihuahuas.

7
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,441
Okay.

8
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,943
It is a tale of bravery,
treachery, compassion...

9
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:33,688
Peanut butter.
- Peanut butter and love.

10
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,532
No, Mr. president,
it's an honor meeting you,

11
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,437
but I have to get
the pups ready for school.

12
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:50,102
Keep dreaming, mi Amor.
Papi will take care of everything.

13
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,446
This goes in the toy pile.

14
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,250
Voila.

15
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,260
Good morning.
Rise and shine.

16
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,632
Up we go. The early dog
gets the bone.

17
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,966
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

18
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,135
Let's go!

19
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,269
- Dad!
- You're up!

20
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,778
Mmm. Peanut butter.

21
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,748
Mmm. Flaky.

22
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,590
Papi, have I mentioned lately
how much I love you?

23
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,895
<i>Mi Corazon, you are my moon, my stars,</i>

24
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,094
- my squeaky chew toy of love.
- Aww.

25
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,234
Gross. We're right here, you know.

26
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,341
All right! Who's ready for school?

27
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,266
Please tell me this won't
involve dirt or bones.

28
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,710
I just had my paws done.

29
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:04,011
<i>You're a dog!
Dirt and bones is 90% of our day!</i>

30
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,146
- Huh?
- Listen, where I'm from they say,

31
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,652
"anything worth doing

32
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,986
"requires getting a little
dirt under the paw nails. "

33
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,390
Now, come on!
We got a great lesson today.

34
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,093
Last one out has to lick a cat!
- Yeah!

35
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,763
Cats are weird.
- I'm no cat-licker.

36
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,061
You'll be licking a cat.
- I'm not licking a cat!

37
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,190
Ow!

38
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,828
Stupid door.

39
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,997
Okay, that was pep,
Ali, Lala, Papi, Jr.

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,134
Wait a minute. Rosa?

41
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,838
Where is he? Squeaks?

42
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,675
I've gotta find him.

43
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,252
No. Not here.
Where are you?

44
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,310
<i>Vamos, Rosita.</i>

45
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:45,291
Unless you wanna be
coughing up fur balls, I'd shake a tail.

46
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,654
But I can't find squeaks.

47
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,323
I buried him during the scavenger hunt,
and now he's gone.

48
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,859
Ah. I see.

49
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,802
You wouldn't happen to mean
this handsome squirrel?

50
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,231
Ah, ah, ah?

51
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,869
Forgetting something?

52
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,874
Thanks, dad.

53
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,779
Gross. It smells like pee.

54
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,581
I smell Uncle Pedro?

55
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,844
Aha.

56
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,947
<i>You see, mis hijos, long before humans
communicated with each other</i>

57
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,586
through small
electronic devices,

58
00:04:55,628 --> 00:05:00,429
dogs had a simpler, more effective
means of communication, pee-maii.

59
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,558
Pee-maii?
- What?

60
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,625
Let's see.

61
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,232
Single male pit bull, six,
seeks a wet nose with a warm heart.

62
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,534
If you like peanut-butter coladas
and off-leash walks in the rain...

63
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,209
- Bro, are you on stray date?
- Pee-harmony.

64
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,551
Pups, this message
was from Uncle Pedro.

65
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,713
Now, what did we learn today?

66
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,852
- Uh... Uncle Pedro needs a girlfriend?
- This is just embarrassing.

67
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,026
Do I smell churros for breakfast?

68
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,027
Mmm-hmm. I wanted
to try a new recipe. Don't get used to it.

69
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,694
They look amazing. Thank you.

70
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:43,102
You know, Rache,
now that you finished school,

71
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,834
I don't feel right
relying on aunt Viv so much.

72
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,346
And that probably means
getting our own place.

73
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,375
I just want it to be the right place.

74
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,941
Check this out.

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,255
Whoa! "The Langham
huntington Pasadena seeks candidates

76
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,088
"for the following positions,

77
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,321
- Sam, you'd be perfect!
- Keep scrolling.

78
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,793
Oh, um...

79
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,488
"Experienced sous-chef... "

80
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:11,231
Experienced sous-chef?
At the royce? No way.

81
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,998
Keep reading. That's not the best part.

82
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,837
Okay, we get to live at the hotel?

83
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,406
We'd get to live at the hotel!

84
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,173
My gosh, honey. It'd be perfect.

85
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,703
Now, there's just one little thing.

86
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,175
- What?
- Well, we gotta land the jobs first.

87
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,976
Minor detail.

88
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,862
Hmm.

89
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,261
Huh?

90
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,800
- It's Latin.
- I'm Latin.

91
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:51,208
It means "life, love, pedigree. "
This place is a dream.

92
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,269
I hope Rachel and Sam do well.

93
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,247
Our pups would love it here.

94
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,545
They have the poshest
doggy day school in the city.

95
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,743
Whoa. Hold up!

96
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,719
"Doggy day schooi"?

97
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,685
I know you love teaching the pups,

98
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,351
but, I mean,
the pups always seem to get straight a's.

99
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,859
Do you grade on a curve?

100
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,954
Baby, I grade on the curb!
I teach 'em street school.

101
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,998
I know you're a great teacher.

102
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,934
It's just you know
how I feel about homeschooling.

103
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,027
Homeschooling?

104
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,801
You know what happens when you send
pups off to those day schools?

105
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,799
Pup pressure and ticks and...
And tail piercings!

106
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,073
That's actually
a common misconception.

107
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,881
Welcome to the Langham,
where we're all bark and no bite.

108
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,386
And that's okay.

109
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:39,548
I run our award-winning certified
canine academy with Jenny over here.

110
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,219
The name's Oscar. What's yours?

111
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,288
Hi. I'm Chloe and this is Papi.

112
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,322
No way! Chloe winthrop ashe?

113
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,992
Cortez.

114
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,398
Aww!

115
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,896
What a wittle cutie-wutie! Hi!

116
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,736
Who are you calling wittle, lady?

117
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,007
Oscar, let's go set up
the welcome bowls.

118
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,482
Gotta make sure our pups fuel up
for a full day of learning

119
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,484
and fun, fun, fun!

120
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,645
- Jenny!
- Oh! Miss Brickhouse.

121
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,185
So what do you teach
at this school anyway?

122
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,057
You cover hydrant awareness?
Doorbell barking?

123
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,323
Do you even teach basic bone burial?

124
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,360
Don't worry about it, little dude.

125
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,889
I got it all covered. High four, bro.

126
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,963
I'm not your bro, dude.

127
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,328
No problemo.

128
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,832
"Thank you for your interest in
the Langham huntington Pasadena.

129
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,307

Well, thank you for your time.

132
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,382
Papi, Chloe, come on. Let's go.

133
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,920
Excuse me. That's your dog?

134
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,023
I'm sorry. The lady on the phone said
it was okay if we brought them.

135
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,422
Please, don't apologize.

136
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,295
You see, we've had
a little trouble with business

137
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,695
ever since the montague
opened up down the street.

138
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,165
Montague. Remember, Rache, that was
the place I was telling you about,

139
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,998
with the incredible gardens that were...

140
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,900
How unsightly they are. Total eyesore.
- Right.

141
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,440
We're in the midst of making
the Langham the luxury dog destination,

142
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,509
but we need a dog to be
the face of our hotel.

143
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,606
Hello!

144
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,743
A dog who will attract those
well-heeled jetsetters

145
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,213
and their canine companions.
- I like this guy!

146
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,585
- A dog with style.
- Yep.

147
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,849
A dog with grace.

148
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,017
Hey, when you got it, you got it.

149
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,524
Chloe winthrop ashe.

150
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,989
Cortez.

151
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,698
We need her to make appearances.

152
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,134
Spa treatments, grooming service,
lounging by the dog pools.

153
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,732
A paid socialite.

154
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,036
That sounds right up Chloe's alley.

155
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,203
Brilliant. When can she start?

156
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,579
Sir, it is your lucky day

157
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:46,750
because we can all start tomorrow.

158
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,691
Hmm. Okay. You've got yourself a deal.

159
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,753
- Great.
- All right.

160
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,921
Great. Thank you.

161
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,728
Right this way to fill out your paperwork.

162
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,662
We'll be right back.

163
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:11,106
Tomorrow? But I had a great food safety
lesson planned for the pups.

164
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,202
I was gonna teach 'em the five-day rule.

165
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:17,945
I know this is a big change, but trust me,
the pups are in good hands.

166
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,282
Oscar and Jenny seem great.
- Great?

167
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,313
Have you been drinking toilet water?

168
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,289
<i>Those two are loco.</i>

169
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,620
Look at 'em!

170
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,356
There you go. It's a dog.

171
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,763
High four! Give me some paw.

172
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:36,561
Papi, we raised five very bright pups

173
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:40,333
and whatever comes their way,
i know they'll be ready to face it.

174
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,532
What if I'm not ready?

175
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,114
Okay, everyone. It's time for bed.

176
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,916
You'll need lots of rest
before your first day.

177
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,615
Rosa, is something wrong?
- She's been like this all day.

178
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,959
Can you blame her?
I mean, our first day of school.

179
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,294
Uh... I didn't mean that, mom.
I just meant real school.

180
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,197
- Uh... I mean...
- I know what you mean, pep.

181
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,136
Now get some sleep.
Tomorrow's a big day.

182
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,708
Yeah!
- Go faster! This is so much fun!

183
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,240
Go faster! I can feel the wind in my fur.

184
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,718
This is so much fun!
Come on, come on. Go!

185
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:33,248
- Go faster! Hang on! Gangway!
- Come on, keep going!

186
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,895
I don't know, Rache,
do you think we brought enough stuff?

187
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,694
To what room shall I take these?

188
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,294
Oh, uh...

189
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,966
- Room 318.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,299
Thank you.

191
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,277
Let's be on our best behavior, shall we?

192
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:56,842
We're hosting a vip just above
your room in the presidential suite.

193
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,283
<i>Amelia James,
editor-in-chief of James leisure,</i>

194
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,078
in town for our garden gala.

195
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,952
The party of the year.

196
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,049
Oh. But you didn't hear
any of this from me.

197
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,518
- You don't have to worry about us, sir.
- Oh. Really?

198
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,490
Am I correct in presuming that

199
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:15,296
the pups currently go-carting
in the lobby belong to you?

200
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:20,101
That would be Ali, Lala,
pep, rosa and Papi, Jr.

201
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,731
And you, of course, know Chloe.

202
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,899
Oh!
Welcome back, Chloe.

203
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,335
And you know Papi.

204
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,471
Yes. Papi.

205
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,410
And, last but not least, there's Pedro.

206
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,816
Hold it, bro. Resist!

207
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,516
No, don't!

208
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,519
This Pedro, is he...
He's definitely part of he family, too?

209
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,692
Definitely. I'm sure you understand, sir.
Your family must live here.

210
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:54,500
Well, I can't say that they do,
or that I have any family to speak of.

211
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,835
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to presume that you did...

212
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:58,969
Well, well, well, no.

213
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:04,005
Work keeps me so busy, I hardly even
notice the long, lonely nights.

214
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,417
I'm sorry. That must be tough.

215
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,583
Only on days that end in "y. "

216
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,448
- Hey, great suit!
- Mmm-hmm.

217
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,654
I really love the handkerchief
thing you got going on there.

218
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,391
It's hermes.
- It's hermes-ing.

219
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,394
Sam.

220
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,993
Shall we?

221
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,666
Yeah.
- Yes.

222
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,541
Impressive.

223
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,352
Whoa! This is ours?
- Awesome!

224
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,411
This is great!

225
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,355
Hey! I get this couch!
- I get this one!

226
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,017
This place is great!
- Check out this view!

227
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,322
What are we waiting for?

228
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,925
Mr. Cortez, I'm afraid

229
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,661
the only thing they have
to offer you this evening

230
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,795
is our michelin star
six-course tasting menu.

231
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,467
And I hope you don't mind,
but it's all absolutely free.

232
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,169
That should be all right, Mrs. Cortez.

233
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,475
I'll just have to check
with Lester, my assistant.

234
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,547
You get an assistant?
- I get an assistant.

235
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,984
Yeah.
- Oh, honey.

236
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,044
Do you think we could check out

237
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,090
one of these tango classes
in the dance studio?

238
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:21,218
Thank you.

239
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,184
Thank you!
- Yeah.

240
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,688
The Langham.

241
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,131
You know,
i hear they have a whole closet

242
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,795
dedicated exclusively to peanut butter.

243
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,360
Really?
Wow. No way.

244
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,996
Is that really true?

245
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,031
They've got one shelf
for chunky, one for creamy,

246
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,806
one for sort of creamy
but also a little chunky,

247
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:43,337
one for all natural,
but no one ever eats those.

248
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,713
Too hard to stir.

249
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,948
<i>What's wrong, mi hija?</i>

250
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,786
First day of school jitters?

251
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,960
You know, I wasn't always the brave
chihuahua you see before you today.

252
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,088
I'm scared of lots of things.

253
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,565
Mom?
- No, not mom.

254
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,032
Who packed this?

255
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,633
Well, yeah, sometimes mom.

256
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,066
But the point is, it's okay to be afraid.

257
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,974
And remember, rosa, there's nothing
wrong with being different.

258
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,504
Different is just
a nice way of saying "runt. "

259
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,173
Ah. But you're not just different,
you're special.

260
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,343
Too special to be like everyone else.

261
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,718
Hey, Papi, this was
in a box marked "do not open. "

262
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,915
Where do you want it?

263
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,288
Yeah, just leave it right there. Thanks.

264
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,316
<i>You were on dancing with the stars?</i>

265
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,729
<i>I wasn't on dancing with the stars.</i>

266
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:35,361
<i>I was a chambelan, part of an honor
court at a friend's quinceanera.</i>

267
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,402
Is that like
a sweet sixteen or something?

268
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,899
It's better!

269
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,170
<i>A quinceanera is
a very special celebration.</i>

270
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,609
See, on her fifteenth birthday,

271
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:49,774
<i>a quince steps out from
beneath the watchful eye of sus padres</i>

272
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,283
to stand on her own four paws.

273
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,115
Who else's paws would she stand on?

274
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,847
Let me rephrase.
You see, pups spend years learning.

275
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,690
They're told what to wear,
when to sit, and when to heel.

276
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,818
Tell me about it.

277
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:07,231
But then one day, the pup,
she stops relying on all those lessons.

278
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,199
What does she rely on, then?

279
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,525
<i>Her heart, mi hija.</i>

280
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,167
<i>Someday, you too will become a quince.</i>

281
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,686
Phillips head.
I'm gonna need a Phillips head!

282
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,595
Wait, I don't even
know how to use a Phillips head.

283
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:40,929
I'm no expert,

284
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,958
but I don't think you need
a screwdriver to go scuba diving.

285
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:47,836
This is not a leisure trip.
It's a safety inspection.

286
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,671
Oscar may be their teacher,
but I'm still their father,

287
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,507
and it's my job to make sure
my pups are safe.

288
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,838
Keep an eye on the filter,
i have to go check on Chloe.

289
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,414
They make these things so tight,
I'm chafing.

290
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,518
Yeah, Chloe, yeah!
Okay, now growl like a wolf, huh?

291
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,254
Yes. I think you are part wolf.

292
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,487
Now make me love it!

293
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,123
Now make me hate it!

294
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,331
Now make me confused,
but I can't look away.

295
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,631
Now give me,

296
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,933
"somebody put something in my bowl
and I don't know what that is. "

297
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,044
<i>Mi Amor,
how is your first day on the job?</i>

298
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,642
Are you too hot? Too cold?

299
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,416
Are they giving you
regular water breaks?

300
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,717
Okay, now what is this?

301
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,190
Sweetie, they're taking good care of me.

302
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,954
Oh. Okay, good.

303
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,157
Hey, you know, there are some
beautiful off-leash trails here.

304
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,927
I thought maybe tomorrow
we could take a romantic hike.

305
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,993
You, me, some kibbles, some bits...

306
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,266
That sounds fun, honey, but I can't.

307
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,172
I have a ribbon-biting ceremony
for the new boutique.

308
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,574
Right. Okay, another time.

309
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,574
<i>Hey, chica, great scarf.
Bark Jacobs?</i>

310
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,341
- Pucci, actually.
- Loves it!

311
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,612
- Careful, pool boy.
- Papi!

312
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,676
What?

313
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,077
This is interesting.

314
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,317
I was just telling him to be careful.

315
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,553
It's the polite thing to do around a pool.

316
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,895
- Hey, Pedro! Be careful!
- Thanks, Papi!

317
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,055
See?

318
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:27,401
So,
wonder how the pups are doing.

319
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,689
Who's ready for a super-duper day?

320
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,918
Today we're gonna learn
how to lay on floatie rafts

321
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,192
without getting our paws
all wet and icky.

322
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,191
But dad always tells us to jump right in.

323
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,328
Shh, Papi, Jr.
dad's not our teacher anymore.

324
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:04,007
Okay, everyone, find a partner.
We're gonna follow Oscar to the pool.

325
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,210
Yeah! We get to go to the pool!
The pool is so much fun!

326
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,943
Little rosa, remember you have to
wear your swimmies at all times.

327
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,540
I'm gonna learn how to doggy paddle.

328
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,710
You don't know
how to doggy paddle?

329
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,242
Wanna be my swimming partner?

330
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,618
It's so nice outside!

331
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,350
I can't wait to go to the pool!

332
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,325
Yeah, pool!
- Let's go!

333
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,757
Hi, I'm rosa. Nice to meet you.

334
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,533
Aww. Look at the little puppykins
in the little swimmies!

335
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,663
She has swimmies!

336
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,901
Rosa, wait up.

337
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,877
What is wrong with you?

338
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,149
That's just what you get
when you mess with our sister.

339
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,591
Or wear spandex.

340
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:03,494
Hi! I'm Rachel. Hi, I work here, too.

341
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,199
- Hi. Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi. Hi.

342
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,103
- What is that? Salmon?
- Salmon, yes.

343
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,370
Salmon, no. Do it again.

344
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,345
<i>That, that looks more like salmonella.
Allez! In the corner.</i>

345
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,676
Ah! You. There you are.

346
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,048
<i>The dishes are overflowing.
Allez, hop! Zou! Hop!</i>

347
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,649
The dishes? Oh, uh, no.
I'm sorry. Actually, it's me. Rachel.

348
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,991
- Cortez?
- Yeah. Rachel Cortez.

349
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,756
- Your new sous-chef?
- Yeah, yeah.

350
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,097
Anyway, chef didier,
it is such a pleasure to meet you

351
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,693
and I am such a huge fan
of your truffled gnocchi.

352
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,668
What is it you are saying?
I cannot hear you.

353
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,765
All I can hear is
the sound of the dishes not being done!

354
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:43,934
<i>Allez! Zou! Hop!</i>

355
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:50,210
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Were you waiting for an invitation? Huh?

356
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,176
There must be some confusion,
because I was just...

357
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:55,653
No! Make it shine
or your goose is cooked! Cooked!

358
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,285
"Your goose is cooked. "

359
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,917
Yes, it has a nice ring to it, it has...
Poetic, but firm.

360
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,718
Why is she staring at me?

361
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:09,127
Are you staring at me?
Are you staring at chef didier?

362
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:11,363
- The chef didier? Huh?
- Uh... no, no.

363
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,103
So rude!

364
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,037
So rude. No manners,
these young people nowadays.

365
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,113
I'm not rude. I'm Frank.

366
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,710
I'm didier, but I'm Frank.
You know, like direct.

367
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,286
She was staring at me.
Hey! Don't stare at me. Don't stare.

368
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,346
Don't stare at me.

369
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:51,704
Hey. Hey! You must be Sam, right?

370
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,467
- Yes.
- I'm Lester.

371
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,804
Welcome to the team, boss.

372
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,549
Wow. Looks like
we got our work cut out for us, huh?

373
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,247
Yeah, yeah. Sure do.

374
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,855
Mind grabbing that shovel?
Better start digging.

375
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:07,983
Ooh, ooh.

376
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,154
I would love to, but I can't.
Carpal tunnel.

377
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,727
- You have carpal tunnel syndrome?
- No. Thank goodness.

378
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,666
- Have you had it?
- No.

379
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,102
It's bad. You do not wanna get it.

380
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:23,130
Don't get caught in the tunnel.
The carpal tunnel. No.

381
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,735
Hey, great to meet you.
Really, really good.

382
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,074
- Uh, Lester!
- Yeah.

383
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,075
What about these plants?
They're not just gonna trim themselves.

384
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,849
They're not? I like the plants.

385
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,913
It's kind of part of
my overgrown style I'm developing.

386
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,015
Huh?

387
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,686
It's more of an organic... where the
plants just become themselves.

388
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,922
And they live in their own truth.

389
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,126
Papi. I've never been happier to see you.

390
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,330
Do you think you can give me a hand?

391
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,896
Hey, you don't
have to ask this chihuahua twice.

392
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,536
Oscar. Where's he going?

393
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,606
Who's with the pups?

394
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,138
Sam, will you excuse me
for one second?

395
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,342
I'll be right back.

396
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,992
What is this place?

397
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,089
Oscar?

398
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,163
Hello?

399
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,738
What's going on back here?

400
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,772
Hey, what's that gate lead to?

401
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,144
You all right, man?

402
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:46,184
Hey. Hey, skedaddle.

403
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,318
I thought I told you
not to come around here.

404
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,720
- Oscar, what is going on around...
- Papi!

405
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,722
<i>Hola, amigo. Don't mind him,
that's just Arnie, our resident stray.</i>

406
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,628
- What's his deal?
- Poor fellow's a mute.

407
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,797
So, what brings you around these parts?

408
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,237
You come here often?

409
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,965
I'm working.
Shouldn't you be doing the same?

410
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,571
Whoa! Wait. Was that Jenny?
Who's watching the pups?

411
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:12,447
What? No, no.
That wasn't Jenny. I know Jenny.

412
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,709
Then who was it?

413
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,787
Who was who?
Who are any of us, really?

414
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,023
Yeah, okay, right.
Listen, I'm gonna get back to work.

415
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,855
I suggest you do the same.

416
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,861
Hey, listen. I don't trust that Oscar guy.

417
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,530
You see anything strange going on
back here, give me a bark, okay?

418
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,299
Hey, nice carving.

419
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,776
You got skills, man. Who's it of?

420
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,409
You trying to tell me something?

421
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,542
All right. Good talk.

422
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,855
<i>Okay. Quinoa frittata
with heirloom kibble aigre-doux?</i>

423
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:58,954
- That looks delicious!
- I want some!

424
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,488
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- I want some!

425
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,228
Mom, I want some!

426
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,593
Who ordered theirs
with a side of peanut butter?

427
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,899
Oh, um...

428
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,769
Chloe! We need to talk.

429
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,934
There's something fishy
about Jenny and Oscar. They're...

430
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,169
Kennel cough!

431
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,874
Gee, I sure hope I'm well enough to
go back to school tomorrow.

432
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,413
We need to get you to the vet!

433
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,485
Whoa! The vet?
Uh... I'm suddenly feeling much better.

434
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,285
All right. The only thing
i want you coughing up is the truth.

435
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,755
Mom, please.
I don't wanna go back to school.

436
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,019
Rosa, school can be fun.

437
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,858
Not if you're the runt of the litter!

438
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,866
That's the worst thing to be in a litter.

439
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,696
Hey! No one calls my little girl a runt!

440
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,599
I don't wanna be a "little" anything.

441
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,196
<i>I want to be a quince.</i>

442
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,434
- I'm almost 15.
-15?

443
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,670
- Fifteen?
- She's as old as me. I'm two!

444
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,042
- What are you talking about?
- In dog years.

445
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,574
<i>What's a quince?</i>

446
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,809
It sounds like one
of dad's weird Mexican holidays.

447
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,111
What about our sweet sixteen?

448
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,446
Sweet sixteen?

449
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,784
Who said anything
about a sweet sixteen?

450
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,585
<i>Quinceaneras are the coolest.</i>

451
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,988
I'm not sure.
- I don't know about that.

452
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,287
- I want the sweet sixteen.
- Quince-hubba-whatta?

453
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,384
Dad?

454
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,588
Yes, my little Rosita?

455
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,191
<i>I want a quince.</i>

456
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,899
Well, lucky you.
'Cause your father's gonna throw you

457
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:15,202
the biggest, baddest fiesta
this town's ever seen!

458
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,904
Did you guys hear that?

459
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,841
Hey! Forgetting something?

460
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,770
Thanks, dad.

461
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,913
Whoops.

462
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,182
Got it!

463
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,417
<i>A quinceanera?</i>

464
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,525
Are you sure you're ready
to let your little girl go?

465
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,758
I don't wanna let her go.
I just wanna make her feel special.

466
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,627
Sam?

467
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,797
Honey?

468
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:56,245
I'm sure you've had a long day,
but these are like 600 count sheets.

469
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,207
Do you wanna maybe shower?

470
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,586
Okay.

471
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,346
Sleep well.

472
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,097
<i>Mi Amor, I made the doggy bags</i>

473
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,565
and I'm all ready for bedtime!

474
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,295
Papi, you didn't have to
do their bags.

475
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,994
The chef at school makes their lunch.

476
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,602
That's not school. It's vacation!

477
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,372
They'll never have to learn anything for
themselves as long as they're here.

478
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,173
That's why they call it
a full-service hotel.

479
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,348
<i>Mi Amor, will you come out already?</i>

480
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,716
I've been waiting patiently
to see your angelic...

481
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,851
Beautiful, exquisite face.

482
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,393
Remember, my love,
only drink out of your own bowl.

483
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,130
No belly rubs from strangers.

484
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,630
- And if you need me...
- Goodbye, Papi.

485
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,868
I'll meet up with you
and the party planner after work.

486
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,041
I will count the...
Party planner? What?

487
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,511
You don't think
i can handle this on my own?

488
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,681
Rosa said everyone at school uses one
for their sweet sixteen.

489
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,578
- But this is a...
- Party of a lifetime!

490
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,643
Sebastian!

491
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,550
That's right, everybody.

492
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,319
Fasten your chew-boutins
and let the planning begin.

493
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,225
I'm here and I have fabric samples!

494
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:22,129
And here you'll find
our exquisite, top of the line,

495
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,327
vip pool for you and
your darling Charlotte.

496
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,599
Come look, Charlotte.

497
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,107
Yes, you'll have every amenity

498
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,542
that you could possibly desire
right here at your fingertips.

499
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:37,480
Poolside belly rubs,
poolside pedicures...

500
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,857
Ginkgo-mango smoothies.

501
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,794
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

502
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,225
- Go. Go.
- Poolside massages and...

503
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,064
You call this a state-of-the-art pool?

504
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,700
They can't possibly expect me

505
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,866
to be using the same pool
as the likes of such riffruff.

506
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,104
I meant, for staff and dogs.

507
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,304
You can just ignore this for your review.

508
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:15,243
Miss Charlotte will have
her very own royal plunge pool.

509
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,679
Charlotte doesn't plunge. She floats.

510
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,747
- Oh.
- On a float.

511
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,050
Uh... yes.

512
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:25,153
Can you imagine what
chlorine would do to this gorgeous coat?

513
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,555
Terrible things.

514
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,294
She's a defending champion of
the westminster dog show,

515
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,596
not some bottle blonde.

516
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,226
Yes, yes. I... I...

517
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,596
- Will you please show us to our room?
- Yes.

518
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,004
- Yes. The presidential suite.
- Come, Charlotte.

519
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,675
We expect
you'll be most comfortable there.

520
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,736
- I can peel grapes.
- Psst.

521
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,871
Pardon, your highness.

522
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,613
Welcome to the Langham.

523
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:50,883
Perhaps we could meet at the park
for a moonlit stroll sometime. Hmm?

524
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,253
Oh! Uh... hmm.

525
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,762
Charlotte.

526
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,025
Hey, kids!

527
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,732
Hey! Papi, Jr.? Ali? Pep? Lala?

528
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,807
- What's up, dad? Morning!
- Rosita?

529
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,809
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, dad.

530
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,242
You guys left without me.

531
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,403
It's okay, dad. We know the way.

532
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,411
Hey! Hey, Rosita,
are you forgetting something?

533
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,513
Nope. They have everything
we need at school.

534
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,148
Oscar!

535
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,714
Hey, little dudes.
Ready for a big day?

536
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:27,884
Yeah!

537
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,231
<i>I think we want a tone
that screams quince, you know?</i>

538
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,367
That just gets all up
in your face and yells,

539
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,810
<i>"I'm a quince,
what are you gonna do about it?"</i>

540
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,513
<i>Doesn't the father of the quince
get a say in any of this?</i>

541
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:54,243
Of course! Listen, if we need digging
advice, you're our first stop.

542
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,921
Well, what if we had
little chew toy party favors?

543
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,289
You see, rosa, it's so cute,

544
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,658
she carries around
this little squeaky squirrel like...

545
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,026
Like an adorable little puppy?

546
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,830
Papi, sweetie, boychick,
she's not your little puppy anymore.

547
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,031
<i>- The quince is all about letting go.
- I know! I know.</i>

548
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,970
- Can't I just hold on a little longer?
- Papi.

549
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,474
Shh. Did you hear that?

550
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:24,744
There, there, Papi.
I'll protect you from the scary butterfly.

551
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,583
Hello, we're talking here!

552
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,820
So, we good
on the color tones?

553
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,559
What's that rustling? Oscar?

554
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,203
Just close the door.
You're freaking me out.

555
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,431
We are at the Langham, okay?

556
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,997
It's not like some boogeyman is gonna
come flying over the...

557
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:52,771
Hey, you guys.

558
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,143
The Langham sure does have
some nice flowers back here.

559
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,439
I can't afford this kind of stress.

560
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,279
I'm gray and wrinkly as it is.

561
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,545
Pedro, what are you doing?

562
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:01,777
I need your opinion.

563
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,814
The rose says I'm a romantic,
but the sunflower says I like to party.

564
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,990
Okay, spill it. What's her name?

565
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,353
Charlotte James. Like a sonnet.

566
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,259
Nice, bro. She fixed?

567
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:17,899
I believe so!
But she won't even sniff in my direction.

568
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:23,064
I hate to beat the pinata of true love,
but we have a party to plan.

569
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,770
Now, when I think about the color motif,
i see fuchsia.

570
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:27,835
What about you, Pedro?

571
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,241
I see peanut butter.

572
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,445
Uh-huh.
And what about the centerpieces?

573
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,710
Peanut butter.

574
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,945
Fabulous! You're gonna be a big help.

575
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,359
<i>Let me ask you something.
You went to culinary school, oui?</i>

576
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,028
<i>Yes. Oui, sir.</i>

577
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,473
I graduated from the Beverly hills
culinary institute with distinction.

578
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,407
Wow. How impressive.

579
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:02,912
As a distinct graduate,
may I offer my advice from an old chef?

580
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,048
I'd be honored, sir.

581
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,516
Nobody cares!

582
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:13,490
Go back to work
or your potatoes are fried!

583
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,486
My God, that one,
i didn't quite land that one.

584
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,962
<i>Okay, qu'est-ce qu'il y a encore?</i>

585
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,464
Chef, I'm afraid one of our guests
didn't like the Risotto.

586
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,863
<i>What do you mean "didn't like"?
This is magnifique!</i>

587
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:24,300
<i>I mean, who doesn't like magnifique?</i>

588
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:27,370
Amelia James, sir.
She found it to be uninspired.

589
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,236
- Uninspired?
- Yeah.

590
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,435
What would you like me to do?

591
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,970
I'll tell you what I'd like you to do.
You're going to take this

592
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,717
<i>and give it to her. Go! Allez! Go!</i>

593
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,980
Now! Go!

594
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,389
Uninspired. Uninspired.
These Americans!

595
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,253
Compliments of chef didier.

596
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:57,394
Our locally sourced
heirloom bloomsdale savoy spinach,

597
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,369
wrapped and folded in layers of

598
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:03,204
handmade artisanal sheets
of unbleached grain,

599
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:07,177
caressed in waves of ragusa,
sicilian ricotta,

600
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,374
and drizzled with
the essence of San marzano tomatoes,

601
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,916
picked at the height of their harvest

602
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:17,281
and flown in from
the valle del Sarno this very morning.

603
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,958
In other words, lasagna?

604
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,260
Bon appetit.

605
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,298
Hmm.

606
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:33,595
Ladies and gentlemen, please give
a warm welcome to a very special guest,

607
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,299
who will now be regaling us
on the piano.

608
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,384
Oh!

609
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,625
<i>Music.</i>

610
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,966
If music be the kibble of love, play on.

611
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,472
Who said that?
- I just did.

612
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,039
<i>Listen. For rosa's quinceanera,
music is the most important thing.</i>

613
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,641
It's the heart, the soul,
the paws, the tail, the ears...

614
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:53,707
I get it.

615
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:57,084
That's why I've assembled
some of the greatest acts in fur today.

616
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,114
Canine inch nails,
motley chew, the fixxed!

617
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,150
Ready to have your mind blown?

618
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:07,221
First up, put your paws together
for Bob Marley and me!

619
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,765
<i>Jah-jah

624
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,267
isn't this wonderful?
"Jah-huahua," they call it.

625
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:21,540
<i>Big heart, little paws</i>

626
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,173

You'll be humming this
tomorrow, guaranteed.

irie mon, pass me a biscuit.

639
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,045
- Aren't they wonderful?
- I don't think so.

640
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,680
You're right. Terrible. Next!

641
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,776
Ladies and gentlemen...

642
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:05,755
Er... Papi, give it up for black labbeth!

643
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,674
I love the black leather.

644
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,620
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

645
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,590
Ow! Ouch, ouch!

646
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:53,626
It's just the same three chords
over and over!

647
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,568
Hey, man, you try playing
an augmented fifth with three toes.

648
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,235
Fine, but you guys are
still booked for my winter formal, right?

649
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,542
<i>Two sets, free jerky treats,
no brown m&m's. I got it.</i>

650
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:07,045
Coming up next is houndgarden!

651
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,950
I don't get it,
but they're huge in Seattle.

652
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,761
I mean, it's just completely rude.
- Yeah, man.

653
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,494
They cut us off like
30 seconds into the song. Cut us off.

654
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,001
Yeah, I mean, that's not right.

655
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,004
I don't think they get
our music in the colonies.

656
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,062
Next!

657
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:32,298
Throw your tails in the air
for the black eyed fleas!

658
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,081
Great guys.
They used to rehearse on me.

659
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,851
- Such showmanship.
- Next!

660
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:54,395
Lady gaga and the tramp.

661
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,390
Oh, please.

662
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,864
Next!

663
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,596
There is no next.
You've rejected all of them.

664
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,607
But none of them
were good enough for my Rosita.

665
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,932
We need someone special.

666
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,638
Someone magical.

667
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,540
Someone with soul.

668
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,054
Someone unforgettable.

669
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,091
In short, we need a miracle.

670
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,329
<i>Buenas tardes.</i>

671
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,391
Who are you?

672
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,658
Please, allow me to introduce myself.

673
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:35,132
<i>I am El senor Diego arroyo
Montoya de marengo.</i>

674
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,767
This is humberto Juan Carlos
Gutierrez de Nunez.

675
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,634
- And that's Phil.
- What's up?

676
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:45,076
And we are the three mariachis.

677
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,041
Okay, moving right along.

678
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,519
<i>- Can you cover R&B?
- Si.</i>

679
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:51,918
<i>- Hip-hop?
- Si.</i>

680
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,218
<i>- Death metal?
- Si.</i>

681
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,521
<i>- Klezmer?
- Si, si, si.</i>

682
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,920
Baroque opera.

683
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,560
Vivaldi or bach?

684
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,797
We'll give 'em a shot.

685
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,660
It is a miracle.

686
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,962
I love these guys!

687
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,646
Man, those mariachis
really wiped me out.

688
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:27,912
How did you get home from school?

689
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,209
I walked.

690
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,947
By yourself?
Where are the other pups?

691
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,184
They stayed late
to finish the polo match.

692
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:37,023
polo match? Wait a minute.
With, like, a pony?

693
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,393
- How do you even get up there?
- I couldn't.

694
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:44,094
Oscar said I was too small,
so I got stuck in arts and crafts.

695
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,725
I made you a picture.

696
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,531
This right here is
a good-looking rabbit.

697
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,273
Practically a Picasso.

698
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,271
It's a goat, dad.

699
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,506
Uh...

700
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,779
Hi, honey. I'm sorry I'm late.
I missed you.

701
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,376
Hey, where are the rest of the pups?

702
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,349
I wanna talk to you about that.

703
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,652
I don't like
what the pups are learning at school.

704
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,748
Like what?

705
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:11,292
Like polo!
These are not good chihuahua values!

706
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,956
And don't even get me started
on this Oscar character.

707
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,695
Honey, the pups love Oscar.
He's been nothing but kind.

708
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:21,526
Yeah? Well, I got my ears on him.

709
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,434
<i>Remember, mijos,
if you need anything, just bark me.</i>

710
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:30,311
Any time. No problem is too small.
Dad is here. Completely available.

711
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,440
And Rosita, don't forget to make daddy

712
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,678
another one of your
famous goat pictures!

713
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,349
Goat picture.

714
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,212
What? It was a nice picture.

715
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,918
What the...

716
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,424
Hey! Hold it right there!

717
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:55,066
Papi. Hey! So great to see you, buddy!
What are you doing here?

718
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,470
The question is,
what are you doing here?

719
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,032
Are you ever with the pups?

720
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,007
Papi, buddy, relax.
The pups are great.

721
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,872
Oscar! Come on over!
I wanna introduce you to someone.

722
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,479
Here, boy!

723
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,277
On my way!

724
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,955
But where were you
on your way to before?

725
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,515
I got a pretty good guess.

726
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:34,939
Does anyone know you're here?

727
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,503
Of course not.

728
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,014
Because I could get into a lot of trouble.

729
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,274
I can't get

730
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,074
high enough!

731
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:43,011
Gotta buy me

732
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,179
one of those

733
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,214
trampolines!

734
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,750
Why is Oscar always
hanging around back here?

735
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,421
If only you had some way to tell me.

736
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,030
You're getting pretty good at those, man.

737
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,293
What's this one?

738
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,459
That doesn't sound like Oscar.

739
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,304
Listen, we've got trouble.

740
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,468
They've hired a new dog at the hotel,

741
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:08,569
and she's here with her pups,
and I think...

742
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:11,848
- Did you hear that?
- Relax.

743
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,908
You are doing a great job, Jenny.

744
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:18,115
Jenny? I knew
there was something fishy about her.

745
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,679
No one's that perky.

746
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:24,089
So, maybe Papi
is on to something after all.

747
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,892
Yeah! Which one's Papi?

748
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:29,126
Phil, are you even paying attention?

749
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,124
Uh... not really.

750
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,531
Papi better have a real good excuse,

751
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,904
because tardy is not
gonna plan this party!

752
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,432
Guys, guys! I knew it!
That Bernard is no Saint!

753
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,103
It's Jenny and Oscar.

754
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:45,673
I know it might seem like they're just
manipulative, rude and sneaky,

755
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,247
but it gets worse.

756
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,252
They're also conniving schemers.

757
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,687
Yeah, they seem real suspect,
with their balloons and their hugs...

758
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,884
I overheard Jenny
talking about Chloe!

759
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:57,018
Sweetie, everybody's
talking about Chloe.

760
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,996
Her face is plastered
on every brochure in this hotel.

761
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,524
Papi, the fiesta fun train is

762
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:04,557
about to leave the station.

763
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:06,832
So you can either
get both paws onboard,

764
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,273
or destroy rosa's hopes and dreams
on the most important day of her life.

765
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,769
Totally your call.

766
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,835
All right, I'm on the fun train.

767
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,779
Excellent! Now that we're all playing
off the same sheet of music,

768
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,680
did everybody bring
their dancing shoes?

769
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,741
Huh?

770
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,910
Well, this is humiliating.

771
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,180
But at least he didn't make me
wear sparkly legwarmers.

772
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:31,251
<i>They're not legwarmers. They're...
Ay, dios mio, they're legwarmers.</i>

773
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,024
Hey, when do we get to eat the salsa?

774
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,055
I gotta get to the spa.
Chloe is there with Oscar.

775
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,694
I need to... I'm good.

776
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:41,631
One, two, three, eyes on me.

777
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,038
<i>And, uno, dos, tres, cuatro.</i>

778
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,005
It's all about the motion in the ocean.

779
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,842
Feel the beat, feel the rhythm.

780
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,410
Try to be one with the music!

781
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,575
Try to be Juan?

782
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,177
Pedro, sweetheart, give me something.
Give me anything!

783
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,417
I've seen pet cemeteries with more life.
Come on, people!

784
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:02,016
Let's do a little fosse, a little twyla.

785
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,859
And salsa, and salsa,
and salsa, and chips!

786
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,053
Thank you.

787
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,598
Yes, we offer Swedish,
shiatsu, acupressure...

788
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:15,167
Yes, we do offer seaweed wraps.
Hang on one second.

789
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,773
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
you need an appointment.

790
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,937
I'm not sure where
the seaweed comes from.

791
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:25,476
Yes, I believe it comes from the ocean.
Can you hang on a sec?

792
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,948
Yes, we do offer mud baths.

793
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,415
"Will you get dirty?"

794
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,595
Oh, Oscar,
you're kidding!

795
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,879
Whoo! My dogs are barking!
That was some workout? Huh?

796
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,915
That instructor always kicks my tail.

797
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,974
You're really good at downward dog.

798
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,508
Thanks.

799
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:03,713
Hey!

800
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:06,255
You might have everyone else fooled
with your whistle

801
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,624
and your unusually silky coat,
but I'm on to you, Buster!

802
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,652
Papi? What are you doing here?

803
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,630
<i>Mi Amor, I was just...</i>

804
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,292
- Spying on me?
- No!

805
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,860
I was just hiding in the mud,
listening to you talk.

806
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:24,135
Look, Papi, Chloe and I were just trying
to enjoy a nice detox, ya know?

807
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,734
Exchanging juicing tips
and clearing our chakras,

808
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:30,612
but I'll give you two some space
to talk things out.

809
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,542
<i>Hasta luego, amigo.</i>

810
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,846
What? You don't think
he speaks Spanish?

811
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,879
We'll discuss this tonight.

812
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,823
But, mi Amor...

813
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,816
Right. I was just leaving.

814
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,296
Poor Papi. Trouble in paradise.

815
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,460
I can't see anything!
Everything's green!

816
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,201
Phil! Calm down.
You have cucumbers on your eyes.

817
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,206
Oh! Yeah.

818
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,004
She snuck in!

819
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,207
- I'm not gonna tell anyone.
- It wasn't my fault!

820
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,375
Shh! Dad's coming!

821
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,646
<i>Hijos, I've missed you so much.</i>

822
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,812
Dad! Our friends are right there!

823
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:15,718
Oh! I am so sorry to ruin your day
with a father's undying love.

824
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,318
Hey, where's your sister?

825
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:18,521
It wasn't our fault!

826
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,189
- Ali tried to get it first!
- She snuck in!

827
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,720
- We couldn't do anything!
- It was too late!

828
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,594
I was too far away
to do anything, dad!

829
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,694
Hold it! Hold it! One at a time.

830
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:33,233
<i>Ay, chihuahua! Rosita, what happened?</i>

831
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,335
I snuck into frisbee football.

832
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,347
- Who was watching you?
- Nobody.

833
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,312
That's how I snuck in.

834
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:44,113
<i>Wait up, hija! Your father
is getting too old to chase after you.</i>

835
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,621
Then stop chasing!

836
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,590
Come on, Rosita. Come back.

837
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,489
Don't you want
to see the moves your father learned

838
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:50,584
<i>for your quinceanera?</i>

839
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,390
<i>Never mind the quince!</i>

840
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,187
Jenny still won't even let me in the water

841
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,256
without wearing
those humiliating swimmies!

842
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,191
I'll never learn to swim!

843
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:01,329
- So, don't wear humiliating swimmies.
- What?

844
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,430
I'm not saying, don't wear swimmies,

845
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,907
I'm saying, don't let them humiliate you.

846
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,171
What do you mean?

847
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:10,669
In a world of big dogs,
Rosita, your Papi is pretty small.

848
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,741
But instead of letting my size
be a disadvantage, I learn to use it.

849
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,016
I made the big dogs wish
they were small.

850
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:23,886
You are rosa Cortez.
Take pride in what makes you different.

851
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,674
Try this.

852
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,990
That's my little girl.

853
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,125
What did you say to me?

854
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,924
You heard what I said. I said I quit!

855
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:03,160
Quit? Quit, quit?
Nobody quits! Nobody quits! I...

856
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:07,329
I fired him! I fired you!
Yeah, your egg is poached!

857
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,931
And you have been replaced by, uh...

858
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,337
<i>You! Cleaning lady! Ici.</i>

859
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,311
I'm actually the sous-chef, sir.

860
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,440
Not anymore. You are executive
pastry chef, effective immediately.

861
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,507
<i>Allez, hop!</i>

862
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,710
<i>- Are you serious?
- Oui, I am serious. I am.</i>

863
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,381
That's amazing! Thank you, chef!
You are not gonna regret this!

864
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:29,358
Are you touching me?
Is she touching me?

865
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,917
No! No.

866
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,259
Okay, okay. Can you do souffle?

867
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:34,662
- Can I do a souffle?
- Yes.

868
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,428
Do birds sing and do dogs bark?

869
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,832
Not generally at this hotel.

870
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,734
But, start practicing and make it good.

871
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:45,035
We have a gala on Friday
and Ms. James likes her souffle perfect.

872
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,337
- Capiche?
- Capiche!

873
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,140
Good! Good.
Our review depends on it. Good girl.

874
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:02,054
Okay. Invites? Check.
Appetizers? Yes.

875
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,652
Crystal drinking bowls? Fabulous.

876
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:06,128
Sebastian! Listen. Is your...

877
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:10,532
Papi. There you are. We have got to
make a final decision on these linens.

878
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,763
Didn't you get my message?
I peed outside your door like six times.

879
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,396
I can't worry about that right now.

880
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,465
Just tell me, is your groomer still
next to the police station?

881
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,999
Because I need you to
give a message to a trusted friend.

882
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,205
Sure, Papi, sure.
Whatever you need.

883
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,374
Thanks, Sebastian. Now I gotta go
keep an eye on that Jenny.

884
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,476
Oh, right.
Because she's so dangerously perky.

885
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,685
<i>Hey, vatos.</i>

886
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:34,850
When will they
believe Papi?

887
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:36,525
Will it be too late?

888
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,652
I believe him.

889
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,219
Phil, you don't know
what we're talking about, do you?

890
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,423
Nope.

891
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,273
- Hi!
- Hi!

892
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,315
- Sir?
- Yes?

893
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,617
You need to see this.

894
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:11,891
What? Why all these cancellations?
Why now?

895
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:26,466
Whoa.

896
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:31,876
Okay.

897
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:38,783
Not good.

898
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,846
Uh...

899
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,392
Mr. Hollis! Hey!

900
00:52:44,428 --> 00:52:46,828
What are you doing in here?
And what is this dog doing in here?

901
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:51,493
I heard a crash,
and after I heard the crash I found this...

902
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:54,194
This culprit.

903
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,671
He has a very guilty
expression on his face, doesn't he?

904
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,231
Is that my handkerchief?

905
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,704
Do you know this is hermes?

906
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,240
I just don't think he
appreciates fine linen, sir.

907
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:13,278
You know, Papi,

908
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:17,255
it's been hard enough here
without getting yelled at by my boss.

909
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:19,790
I really didn't need this.

910
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,334
Hmm.

911
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,237
Okay, let's see what I got.

912
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:40,977
"Love will make you do crazy things.
Please forgive me.

913
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,111
"5 P.M. on the bridge of love".

914
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,553
Good!

915
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,171
Perfect. Now Pedro.

916
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,898
You can do it!

917
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,608
Come on, bro.
You gotta take a chance.

918
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:11,044
You know what, Papi?
You're right.

919
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,517
I need to give Charlotte
the chance to reject me for who I am.

920
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:16,484
Hit it, boys!

921
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:53,222
Well, I have never
been serenaded by a pit bull before.

922
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:54,956
In a bow tie.

923
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,049
Is that good?

924
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:58,083
Well, she's still here.

925
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,420
Oh.

926
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,223
<i>Dios mio.</i>

927
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:37,161
Lester!
- What? What?

928
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,463
What do you think?

929
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,300
Oh!

930
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,864
It's finished!

931
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,475
It's sublime. It's beautiful!

932
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,071
Sam, we did it!

933
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,144
We did it!

934
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,518
Okay, all right, all right.

935
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,156
Hey, do you mind taking down
that netting before you head off?

936
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,150
And wrapping up the hoses?

937
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,889
You got it, Sam.

938
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,453
Night, Lester.

939
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,725
- Good night, Sam.
- Yeah.

940
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:27,482
Okay, rosa. This is it.
You've mastered the little pool.

941
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,548
You can do this!

942
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,885
Does this look like
a puppy pool to you?

943
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:37,149
Because it doesn't look
like a puppy pool to me.

944
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:42,055
Do you see any other puppies?
Oh, look! No puppies.

945
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,867
Honey, check the vip tag.

946
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,462
Besides, aren't you
a little small for such a big pool?

947
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:52,708
I'm big where it counts, ma'am.

948
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,837
That is really cute, honey,
but you don't belong here.

949
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,310
So go on. Scram. Shoo.

950
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:05,147
Oh. Well, aren't you a beauty?

951
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,782
You don't look a day over seven,
if I must say.

952
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,116
Oh! No, my tag! But I...

953
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:15,264
Doggone it! I can't believe this.

954
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,663
Ah. Everything is perfect.

955
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,137
How could she not forgive me,
right, Arnie?

956
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,108
I mean, I'd forgive me.

957
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,941
Hey, Oscar. Oscar?

958
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:32,008
Hey, man, where you going?

959
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,442
Relax, little dude.
You shouldn't worry so much about me.

960
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,518
You should be worrying
about you and your family.

961
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,786
What's that supposed to mean?

962
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:43,450
Hey! Hey, come back here! Pedro?

963
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,887
Here, Papi. I brought you
a centerpiece for your picnic.

964
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,158
Aloe?

965
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:51,224
Hello. I brought you
a centerpiece for your picnic.

966
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,566
Hey! Got a new one?

967
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,839
Pedro, check it out.
He's got like a whole collection here.

968
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,699
What is that, a whistle?

969
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:05,105
Wait a second.
Wait a second! Jenny?

970
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,840
The gate.

971
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,080
Oscar!

972
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,412
Arnie, you're a genius!

973
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,648
- Where are you going?
- The gate!

974
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,089
That Saint Bernard is up
to something, I knew it!

975
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,217
I'll be right back!

976
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,420
No way I'm letting you go
in there without backup.

977
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:22,793
We'll just have a taste.

978
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,163
Papi won't even notice.

979
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:36,102
This is it, Mr. montague.
Tomorrow's guest list.

980
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:41,113
Celebrities, senators, dignitaries.
All the vip guests for the garden gala.

981
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,247
- So I gotta go.
- Ah, ah, ah.

982
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,677
Hasty now, aren't we?

983
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,421
What else do you need?

984
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:54,629
What I need is to protect
my multi-million dollar venture.

985
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,263
And that means making sure that
the Langham's little gala

986
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,593
hits a few bumps in the road.

987
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:10,936
Are you hearing this?
Jenny is out to ruin the gala!

988
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,547
I guess you're not crazy after all, Papi.

989
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,607
Thanks a lot, bro.

990
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:20,147
<i>Ay, chihuahua! Mi Amor!
You are poetry on paws.</i>

991
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:23,023
I was so looking forward
to our romantic dinner.

992
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,755
Why are there three mariachis eating it?

993
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,387
Chloe, I can explain.

994
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:28,920
Wait.

995
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,660
Did you hear that?

996
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,292
Someone's in trouble!

997
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:39,872
Help! Somebody!
Somebody help me. I can't swim.

998
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:46,004
Help! Anybody! Somebody, help!

999
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,907
The deep end!

1000
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,852
Help me! Somebody...

1001
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:56,047
I can't swim!

1002
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:57,750
Come on, man! Let's roll!

1003
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,726
- That sounds like Charlotte!
- That sounds like rosa!

1004
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,265
I'm caught!
Something's got me! It's a snake!

1005
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,461
It's a hose! Who ever heard of
a snake in the garden?

1006
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:08,061
That's why they
call 'em garden snakes!

1007
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,298
This is where they live!

1008
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:10,397
Papi! No, no, slow down!

1009
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,498
Something big and ugly
is chasing me!

1010
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,565
That's me!

1011
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,167
I'm trying to get you to slow down!

1012
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,610
- Pedro, why are you chasing me?
- Papi, you've got to... oh!

1013
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:17,977
Papi, there goes a tree!

1014
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,481
Of all the nights for it to rain!

1015
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:21,711
That's not rain!
You're breaking all the sprinklers!

1016
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:23,013
Who planted all these trees here?

1017
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,020
It's a garden!
That's where they plant trees!

1018
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,453
Pedro, you don't do well in crisis.

1019
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:27,979
Okay, there goes a statue!

1020
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,355
I never liked that statue.

1021
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,519
Pedro! It got me! I'm stuck!

1022
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,558
Pedro, get me loose! Get me loose!

1023
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:36,827
- Yeah, I got it.
- Let's go! I'm coming, Rosita!

1024
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,398
Close call.
That could have gotten ugly.

1025
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:48,733
Help! Please, please.

1026
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:53,776
Help! Somebody help!

1027
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:56,215
Please. Please.

1028
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,620
I'm sinking.

1029
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,453
Here! Grab this!

1030
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,525
I can't swim!

1031
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,017
Rosita, are you okay?

1032
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:07,255
- I'm fine, dad.
- You're shivering.

1033
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,816
Thank you. You're very kind.

1034
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:12,225
You have
a lot of explaining to do, young lady.

1035
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:15,560
At the pool, at night, without swimmies!

1036
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,725
You're the one who told me
to get my paws wet.

1037
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:20,429
Not in the deep end.
I don't go in the deep end.

1038
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,598
I didn't have a choice, dad.
You have to believe me.

1039
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,699
Tell him. Tell him what happened.

1040
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,937
I lost my tag,
and I was just reaching for it and...

1041
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:29,342
Charlotte!

1042
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,572
I'm telling you,
Mr. Hollis, it was terrifying.

1043
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,582
I could hear them all the way
from the kitchen.

1044
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:35,208
- Charlotte!
- What were you doing in the kitchen?

1045
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:36,543
Oh! Um...

1046
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,146
Late-night snack.
- Oh! Thank goodness.

1047
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,151
Oh! Charlotte. Come on, Charlotte.

1048
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,323
Baby! Honey!

1049
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,296
We're gonna take good care of you.

1050
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,459
I never in a million years
could have fathomed it.

1051
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:57,167
My eight-time award-winning dog
accosted by mutts at the Langham?

1052
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,366
Ms. James, please.

1053
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:01,969
We'll have Charlotte groomed
to perfection at the spa.

1054
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,407
She won't even
remember this happened.

1055
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,745
She might not, but I certainly will.

1056
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,684
I assure you, those animals

1057
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,710
will be dealt with accordingly.

1058
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,187
What do you think he means?

1059
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,952
Rosa, go to your room.
I will take care of this.

1060
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:17,619
- This isn't fair.
- Now.

1061
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,494
What?

1062
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,730
<i>Boss, we got a bad
situation here. We need to get you...</i>

1063
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,330
I'm with a very important guest
at the moment.

1064
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,603
<i>Sir, the new gardens
have been destroyed,</i>

1065
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,873
<i>and both kitchen freezers have broken.
We need you.</i>

1066
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:38,540
Come on, Charlotte.
We are going to pack

1067
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:42,108
and we're gonna go move
into the montague in the morning.

1068
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,748
Ms. James, please wait.

1069
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:47,221
Gentlemen, I didn't quite
get a chance to explain.

1070
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,082
I think she likes me.

1071
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:56,597
Uh...

1072
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:13,279
Why did you punch holes
in the souffle with a fork?

1073
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,181
What culinary school did you go to?

1074
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,379
Give me the name,
and I will have them shut down!

1075
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,251
- Something is wrong, chef.
- Yes, and we agree, then.

1076
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,848
No, they were perfect
when I pulled them out of the oven...

1077
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,626
These souffles are an insult
to souffles everywhere!

1078
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,218
I mean, no, this is the worst.

1079
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:30,164
You, my girl,
your souffle has been punctured.

1080
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:32,830
<i>Give me your hat. Allez.</i>

1081
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:35,597
Now.

1082
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:39,298
<i>Adieu, mademoiselle.</i>

1083
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:46,908
I presume you know why you're here.

1084
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:49,277
Yeah. I take it
you've seen the gardens, sir.

1085
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,717
I'm afraid I have.

1086
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,914
What? Is it the succulents?
'Cause I can take those out.

1087
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:56,857
Sam, they've been destroyed

1088
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,123
and covered from bush to
bush with paw prints.

1089
01:04:59,162 --> 01:05:00,686
What?

1090
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:05,225
I'm afraid you've left me no choice, Sam.

1091
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:08,134
You're fired.

1092
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:13,139
Does this mean I won't get to
see the peanut butter closet?

1093
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,706
But I was just getting good
at Kong ball croquet!

1094
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,374
I am not leaving this hotel without Carol.

1095
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,315
My paws have never looked better.

1096
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,614
This isn't fair. We didn't do anything.

1097
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:27,045
Hey, no paw-pointing.

1098
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,823
Rosa. Honey, what happened out there?

1099
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:31,326
It doesn't matter.

1100
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,760
It's not like anyone
would believe me, anyway.

1101
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:37,892
<i>Quince or no quince,
I'll always just be the runt of the litter.</i>

1102
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,700
<i>Mi Amor.</i>

1103
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,532
About our date.

1104
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:48,942
Getting, you know...

1105
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,843
Hello?

1106
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,876
Interrupted.

1107
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:54,273
Hello?

1108
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,747
Chloe winthrop ashe?

1109
01:05:56,819 --> 01:06:00,255
Cortez, actually. Have we met?

1110
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,657
I'm sorry. I think
i came to the wrong room, anyway.

1111
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:06,662
I'm just looking for that family
with the mischievous little pups.

1112
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:07,788
Have you seen them?

1113
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,231
Come on in.

1114
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:14,860
<i>Rock-a-bye puppy in the treetop</i>

1115
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:16,535
<i>when the wind blows</i>

1116
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,039
you mean those are your...

1117
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:21,475
My five vips, very important puppies.

1118
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,578
Listen, soon as they fall asleep,
come meet me at the restaurant.

1119
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,010
But it's closed.

1120
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:29,108
Being a vip has its privileges.

1121
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,609
And, hey, bring the big one, too.
Kind of cute.

1122
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,583
Although he might want
to stick to his day job.

1123
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:40,823
And that's how rosa
saved my life.

1124
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,555
Wow.

1125
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:46,830
Our rosa, a hero. I am so proud.

1126
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,264
To rosa!
To rosa!

1127
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:01,908
- That girl's got no fear.
- And I got no clue.

1128
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,475
I can't believe I doubted her.

1129
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,818
I was so pigheaded
and close-minded and...

1130
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,886
Feel free to stop me when you disagree.

1131
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:11,958
You're starting to win me over. Go on.

1132
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:14,588
<i>Corazon, I just wanted
to believe that rosa...</i>

1133
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:17,897
That you all still needed me.

1134
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,600
Papi, we always will.

1135
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:25,038
That's one thing that will never change.

1136
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,502
You're gonna make a grown dog cry!

1137
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,336
Well, sweet as that is, honey,

1138
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:33,314
Amelia's taking us over to the montague
first thing in the morning.

1139
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:34,577
Then let's get to work.

1140
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,312
We gotta fix those gardens,

1141
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:40,288
<i>because that's where we're going to
throw the greatest quinceanera ever!</i>

1142
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:44,419
But, Papi, how? We're supposed to
be out by tomorrow morning.

1143
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:48,089
Let's just say
this old dog knows a few new tricks.

1144
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,496
Well, then, we'd better fuel up.

1145
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:15,589
Whoa! Hey! Hey.

1146
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,960
Officer, everything under control?

1147
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,421
Don't scare me like that.

1148
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:30,464
Delgado, thanks for coming
on such short notice.

1149
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,270
I got your message.
Anything you need, Papi.

1150
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:34,776
Sebastian, you came!

1151
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:38,541
As if I didn't have to
battle huge bags under my eyes already.

1152
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:42,073
All right, everybody.
Let's divide and conquer!

1153
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:17,518
It does exist!

1154
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:31,025
<i>Hey, show your attitude
make it understood</i>

1155
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:34,901
<i>you're the one who's
changing everybody's point of view</i>

1156
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:38,998
<i>give it all you've got
viva El carnaval</i>

1157
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:42,340
<i>this will be a moment
you will cherish all your life</i>

1158
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:43,602
<i>you've come so far</i>

1159
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,476
<i>that's who you are</i>

1160
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:49,574
<i>with all my friends together</i>

1161
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,450
<i>we'll, we'll take this night</i>

1162
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:57,289
<i>all by surprise
celebrating</i>

1163
01:09:57,326 --> 01:10:00,693
<i>fiesta, party
quinceanera, family</i>

1164
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:03,857
<i>all together
we can be as one</i>

1165
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:07,596
<i>come celebrate with me</i>

1166
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:12,635
I came, I saw, I decorated.

1167
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,383
They actually pulled it off.

1168
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,978
Boys, looks like we got ourselves a gig.

1169
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,148
This party's gonna be great!
I hope there's music.

1170
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,852
Oy. Phil. Phil, Phil, Phil.

1171
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:31,951
Yeah?

1172
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:40,101
- Pedro, are you in position?
- Affirmative.

1173
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:42,404
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this, Papi?

1174
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:44,303
What they gonna do, kick us out?

1175
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,306
Shh. They're coming.

1176
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,407
Keep it quiet, Oscar.
There's no one there.

1177
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:50,537
Now!

1178
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,677
Peanut butter?

1179
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,449
Hah! Is that the best you can do?

1180
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,513
- Pedro?
- Peanut butter!

1181
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,182
Get your peanut butter!

1182
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:06,626
Freshly churned peanut butter
over in the South garden!

1183
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:16,769
Peanut butter?
- I think it's that way!

1184
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:17,965
Is it free?

1185
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,235
It better be
for what my room cost!

1186
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,716
Somebody, help me!

1187
01:11:37,193 --> 01:11:40,219
Get off! Get off!
What did I ever do to you?

1188
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:43,663
I was such a good trainer!
I was the best trainer!

1189
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:46,164
I'm late for a grooming.

1190
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:51,931
What on earth is going on...
Get out of here!

1191
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,169
<i>The garden gala starts in 20 minutes.</i>

1192
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:57,373
Thank you, Mr. Hollis.
You saved my life.

1193
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,542
You're a kind man.

1194
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,383
So I've been told.

1195
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,415
Now, what's this?

1196
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,686
All our classified guest information.

1197
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,151
Jenny, where were you taking this?

1198
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:18,257
Nowhere! I swear. It was just...

1199
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:22,035
It was the chihuahua!

1200
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:25,233
What is going on?

1201
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:26,768
Pedro?

1202
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,543
Montague?

1203
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:37,108
Jenny! Jenny! Tell them.

1204
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:43,052
Tell them how I just like
to come back here and sniff the roses.

1205
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:48,261
So this is how they manage
to poach our clientele!

1206
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,498
I should've known
you were up to something.

1207
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,830
No one's that perky.

1208
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,798
Hello? That's what
I've been saying all along.

1209
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:01,133
I've misjudged you, Papi.

1210
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,041
You're a good man.

1211
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,111
Thank you.

1212
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:08,247
Thanks. Yeah, you got your moments.

1213
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:14,686
Papi, you were right all along.
I owe you an apology.

1214
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:16,449
I'll settle for a kiss.

1215
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,262
Will you please let me down?
Mmm-mmm.

1216
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,702
Psst... psst.

1217
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,412
Rosita!

1218
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:41,710
What's going on? What's that?

1219
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:45,086
<i>A little something your mother
picked up for your quinceanera.</i>

1220
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,448
<i>Quinceanera?</i>

1221
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:50,758
But we're moving out.
How are we going to...

1222
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:53,193
It's just gonna be a small family affair.

1223
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:56,061
There's a little something in the bag
for your brothers and sisters, too.

1224
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:59,597
Oh. And if Papi, Jr. gives you
any trouble about it,

1225
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:02,029
show him this.

1226
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,543
No, it's okay. I completely understand.

1227
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,205
I love you. Bye.

1228
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:15,715
Well, aunt Viv rented the guest house.

1229
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:18,417
But I guess, on the bright side,

1230
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,048
there are worse streets
to sleep on than Beverly hills.

1231
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,756
I'm sorry, Rache.
I wanted to start a life of our own.

1232
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:30,264
- Sam.
- It's my fault.

1233
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,630
I was the one that
pushed for the move.

1234
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:32,895
Sam, you gotta see this.

1235
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:49,445
It's like an angel fell from heaven,

1236
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:53,020
and grew fur.

1237
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,120
Places, everybody!

1238
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,421
<i>The quince and her honor court
are coming.</i>

1239
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,598
Everyone's going to make fun of me.

1240
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,531
I think it looks very chic.

1241
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,934
<i>Yeah, if it were 1972!</i>

1242
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,002
Don't worry.

1243
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:13,872
Dad said it's just going
to be a family thing.

1244
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:22,173
<i>Presenting our quince,
rosa Cortez and her honor court!</i>

1245
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:25,381
Cool!

1246
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:27,782
Isn't she pretty?

1247
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,120
Aren't they adorable?
- So cute.

1248
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:30,489
I love the dress.

1249
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,426
Oh, my God.
Rosa's all grown up now.

1250
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:34,691
Oh! Look at Papi, Jr. in his suit.

1251
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:41,935
Need a tissue, bro?

1252
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:47,003
Just a bug in my eye, that's all.

1253
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:51,805
Move over.

1254
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:08,663
Rosa,
before we go any further,

1255
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:10,790
I got one more little surprise.

1256
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,562
<i>Amigos!</i>

1257
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:28,306
I may have mentioned to a few pups
how you saved Charlotte.

1258
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:31,111
Why is everyone wearing swimmies?

1259
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,811
The question is, why aren't you?

1260
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,115
I can't believe all of this is for me.

1261
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:41,118
Rosa, you're not only
the bravest dog I know,

1262
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:44,030
you are also the coolest pup in school.

1263
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:47,359
So, go on, sweetheart. Soak it up.

1264
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:50,371
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
time for the brindis,</i>

1265
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:52,930
<i>the traditional toast
of the quinceanera...</i>

1266
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:54,573
I'm sorry...

1267
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:58,671
<i>Given by the father of the quince,
senor Papi Cortez.</i>

1268
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,348
Friends, family,

1269
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:07,116
<i>today we celebrate
the quinceanera of rosa,</i>

1270
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:09,817
who I am so proud to call my daughter.

1271
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:14,292
Rosa has shown determination
in the face of adversity

1272
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:17,565
and heroism in the face of danger.

1273
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:21,035
She was given peanuts,
and she made peanut butter.

1274
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,229
And most importantly,

1275
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:27,298
she stopped listening to everyone
who told her what she couldn't do

1276
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:31,711
and started listening inside
to discover all that she could.

1277
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:35,379
She even taught her old dad
there's a time to hang on

1278
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,480
and a time to let go.

1279
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:41,051
<i>And she didn't need this party
to become a true quinceanera.</i>

1280
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,290
She already was.

1281
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:48,523
To rosa!
- To rosa!

1282
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:56,801
To rosa!

1283
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:59,365
This isn't the goldberg bar mitzvah.

1284
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:04,476
This is like the coolest party
i have ever been to.

1285
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:07,880
<i>Dad, is it too late for us
to become quinces, too?</i>

1286
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,384
Oh, pep, it is never too late.

1287
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,991
Oh, my God. It's beautiful.

1288
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:21,924
But how?

1289
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,967
Sam, we never got to tango, did we?

1290
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:28,094
What?

1291
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:31,600
I... no, I guess we didn't.
I'm sorry, Rache.

1292
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,972
Don't be. Let's dance!

1293
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:38,303
<i>I told you not to order
the huevos rancheros!</i>

1294
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:39,780
We're late for the gig!

1295
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,287
<i>Excusez-moi, excusez-moi.</i>

1296
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:56,525
You are on my foot, buddy.
That was my toe. My toe!

1297
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:58,390
<i>Mademoiselle, mademoiselle, uh...</i>

1298
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,924
Whatever.
Executive dishwasher chef.

1299
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,163
Rachel.

1300
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:04,434
It's a mob scene. It's a mob scene.

1301
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:08,341
This is the biggest gala in the
Langham's history, and I need your...

1302
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,503
I need your...

1303
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,143
I need your help! Please!

1304
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:22,653
I'm gonna need that hat.

1305
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:23,953
My toque?

1306
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:25,391
No, no.

1307
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,634
Okay, okay, you can have my toque!

1308
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,202
And my job?
- Yes!

1309
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:39,571
<i>Let's go! Come on! Let's go!
Rachel, on y va, allez.</i>

1310
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:40,802
Chef didier coming through!

1311
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:41,934
Chef Rachel coming through!

1312
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:43,706
No, no, sous-chef.
Sous-chef Rachel.

1313
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:44,905
I've got the hat. Chef.

1314
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:46,436
Mine is bigger than yours.

1315
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,206
It's not like
Charlotte to disappear.

1316
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,548
Ms. James, don't worry.
I just saw her back here.

1317
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:00,554
Must've been a pretty big reward, huh?

1318
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:03,058
Reward? For what?

1319
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:06,698
The little chihuahua.
The one that saved your dog.

1320
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,496
Excuse me?

1321
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,903
Out in the pool. Didn't you hear?

1322
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:19,809
Take my bags back up
to the penthouse.

1323
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:25,781
But who will take care of the dogs
when I'm gone?

1324
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:29,348
Officer sims?
They're the ones who will suffer.

1325
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:33,418
Is that what you want,
to punish innocent little doggies?

1326
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:37,998
I've never seen that woman
before in my life.

1327
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:39,830
Tell it to the judge.

1328
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:41,897
Okay.

1329
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:43,336
Watch your tail!

1330
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:49,234
I can't go to jail!
I've never even been crated!

1331
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:50,938
I can't take enclosed spaces!

1332
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:53,880
Come on!
Throw me a bone here. I'm innocent!

1333
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:57,316
Come on, man!
If the collar don't fit, you must acquit.

1334
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:59,047
You want an alibi?
I can give you an alibi.

1335
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:03,251
I got as many as you want.
I can't eat prison food, man!

1336
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:06,518
I got a gluten-free kosher diet!

1337
01:21:11,133 --> 01:21:14,466
Mr. Cortez.
Well, I don't know how you did it,

1338
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,595
but these gardens
are nothing short of exquisite.

1339
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:20,805
I hope you'll accept my apologies,

1340
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:24,243
along with a permanent
contract with the hotel.

1341
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,116
Are you...

1342
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:36,220
Sure, go ahead. Just the once.
All right. Don't touch me anymore.

1343
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:37,418
- That's fine.
- Okay.

1344
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:39,484
This one is for rosa.

1345
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,449
Thank you all so much
for coming to our fiesta today,

1346
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:05,317
<i>especially those of you who schlepped
all the way from the 90210.</i>

1347
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:08,248
I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry.

1348
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:12,181
<i>That wraps up
the quinceanera of mi hija rosa.</i>

1349
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,559
Dad, aren't you forgetting something?

1350
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:15,688
Forgetting something?

1351
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:19,063
Rosita, I got the band.
I took salsa lessons.

1352
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,695
We decorated the garden.
What did I possibly forget?

1353
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:23,965
This.

1354
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:27,736
That's sweet.

1355
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:28,902
That is sweet.

1356
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,741
I think I'd like to have
some puppies soon.

1357
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:31,803
Hmm?

1358
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:33,405
That's not all you forgot.

1359
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,780
Now that Sam got his job back
and we can stay,

1360
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:39,548
and now that Oscar's gone,
they need a new teacher at school.

1361
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:42,284
You didn't ask
who's been chosen to replace him.

1362
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:43,549
You mean...

1363
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:45,890
<i>Congratulations, Professor.</i>

1364
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,719
Awesome!
- I'm sitting in front!

1365
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:49,093
Now we can get
our paws wet!

1366
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,462
I want to learn
to salsa and chips.

1367
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:53,330
You're gonna be
the best teacher ever!

1368
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:55,495
<i>Papi likes.
- Goodbye, polo, hello, pollo.</i>

1369
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:57,004
Now we can master pee-mail!

1370
01:22:57,038 --> 01:23:00,804
And so the Cortez family
lived happily ever after.

1371
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:03,543
At least until Pedro got a vip tag

1372
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:06,103
and locked himself
in the peanut butter closet.

1373
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:08,982
But that's another story.

1374
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:13,580
You really stepped
up to the bowl today, Papi.

1375
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:16,591
Sebastian! Don't let 'em
pack up that Margarita machine!

1376
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:21,460
Papi, you're a good dad,
a good friend, and a good dog.

1377
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:25,286
They don't appreciate
classic dog band music here. You know.

1378
01:24:25,327 --> 01:24:26,385
That's what I'm saying.

1379
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,488
<i>Like, I'm talking about pee-52s,
the Rex pistols.</i>

1380
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:30,930
Reo taii-waggin'.

1381
01:24:30,966 --> 01:24:32,490
Yeah, yeah, good band, good band.

1382
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:33,933
- New odor.
- Yeah.

1383
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:35,231
- Right? Iggy pup.
- Right.

1384
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,897
He's a little violent on stage.

1385
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:39,202
The fur flew, but that was,
you know, part of the magic.

1386
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,605
Collie Parton is one of

1387
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:41,904
my personal favorites.

1388
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:43,843
I'm not into the country so much myself,

1389
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:45,072
but yeah, I respect her.

1390
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:46,137
No, you don't know what

1391
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,205
you're missing there, and...

1392
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:48,977
She's got a lot of fur. Big, big fur,

1393
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,747
like blown out every night
before she goes on.

1394
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:52,912
Coldspay.

1395
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:55,149
They got a little into the treats
in the later years, yeah?

1396
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:58,159
Yeah, that's true. They were up to like
30-40 treats a day, actually.

1397
01:24:58,193 --> 01:24:59,888
It ruined them.

1398
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,361
You know, cheap tick.

1399
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:04,524
- Earth, wind and fur.
- Rage against the vacuum cleaner.

1400
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:07,501
Great band. Did you see that?

1401
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:09,761
- Nice tail.
- Fancy a bit of that.

1402
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:04,624
Well, hey there.
Well, who do you belong to?

1403
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:12,188
No one? Yeah, well, I know the feeling.

1404
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:23,406
There, there, boy.

1405
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:32,445
Front desk? Hollis.

1406
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:33,784
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1407
01:26:33,822 --> 01:26:37,758
I have a dog here
who's gonna be needing a new hotel tag.

1408
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:39,384
<i>- What room, sir?
- Which room?</i>

1409
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:44,131
Manager's suite.

1410
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:45,462
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1411
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:51,701
You are a handsome devil, aren't you?

1412
01:27:02,484 --> 01:27:05,942
Every pet
deserves a loving and permanent home.

1413
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:11,088
So when you choose to adopt,
please adopt responsibly.

1414
01:27:11,126 --> 01:27:13,356
<i>Gracias, and thank you.</i>

1415
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:55,329
<i>You'll be humming
this tomorrow, guaranteed.</i>
