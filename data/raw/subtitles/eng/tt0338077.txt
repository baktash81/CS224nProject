1
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:20,663
It's a beautiful morning' Chicago. And to
all you graduating Bulldogs' "Go get them!"

2
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,315
Boys.

3
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,249
Hey.

4
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,190
Dude!

5
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,495
Dude.

6
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,996
How's it hanging, man?

7
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,869
Slightly to the left, bro.
Why? What's up?

8
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,029
Nothing. Just stopped by to check out
your decks. I thrashed mine.

9
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:14,836
- Check out my new "sponsor me" tape.
- Any different than the last three?

10
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,378
Totally. Remember that trick I was trying
on the vert? That flip trick?

11
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:21,415
This close to landing it.
I'll have it in a week.

12
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,751
- You're wasting your time.
- Thanks.

13
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,446
I'll tell you what.
If you land it, I'll sponsor you.

14
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,082
- All right.
- In the meantime, wanna buy something?

15
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,956
I wish I could, dude. I'm broke.

16
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,826
I'm broke. Just let me hang out.
I'm your best customer. I'm here every day.

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,664
But you never spend money. You gotta start
spending money. Money-spending is good.

18
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:45,899
Little man! I told you already.
Reach your hand in there with that T-shirt...

19
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:49,238
...you're pulling out a stump! Don't make
me go over and smack you!

20
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:50,902
Yo, Bam.

21
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,014
- What's up, man?
- Bro.

22
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:56,481
- I love you, bro.
- All right. Easy, Greg.

23
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,053
Freaking me out, man.
Let me get a skateboard.

24
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:03,181
- Which one do you want?
- I don't care. They're all the same shape.

25
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,350
I want my board, right there.
That one.

26
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:08,725
- Let me get all three of those.
- I can do that for you.

27
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:15,237
- Bam special. Bam!
- Bam.

28
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,601
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up, man?

29
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:23,405
Do you remember me? Probably not. We
skated SCRAP together a couple years ago.

30
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,980
- Oh, yeah. Dude, yeah. You were ripping.
- Thanks, bro.

31
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,879
- Keep an eye on this kid.
- Thanks.

32
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,782
Watch out for this guy's frontside 360.

33
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,749
- He's got the SSBSTS lurking.
- It's for the wall.

34
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:39,326
- You going to the demo later on?
- Hell, yeah. I wouldn't miss it.

35
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:42,430
- It's for the wall.
- You don't have to make excuses.

36
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:53,034
- Sorry.
- Bam was a loser before he got sponsored.

37
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,234
- Just like you, dude.
- Thanks.

38
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:58,175
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Greg.

39
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,714
- You flow me one of these decks.
- For free?

40
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:05,047
Yeah, for free. Exactly.
And in exchange, I'll skate it.

41
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,520
I'll tell everybody where I got it.
You can sponsor me.

42
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,318
All right, dude.

43
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:12,220
Which one do you want?

44
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:13,857
For real?

45
00:05:14,764 --> 00:05:16,356
All right.

46
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,193
How about we go with one
of those Elements, like Bam got?

47
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,966
Dude, for you, I can go that board $ 140.

48
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:27,707
Tax not included.

49
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:58,765
Nice hat.

50
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,941
We're late.

51
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,706
Let's go.

52
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,715
Shut up.

53
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:21,263
I still can't believe it. Bam just walks in and
Greg tosses him a handful of his decks.

54
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,828
- I can't wait to get my own deck.
- I did the math.

55
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:31,599
There's 53 guys who make a living skating
and about a million wannabes like us.

56
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,036
And?

57
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:36,804
And nothing. But until a sponsor backs
a tour bus into my driveway...

58
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,641
...I have to work all summer
to pay for school.

59
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,478
I don't believe you.
You're still gonna bail on me.

60
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,611
You know what? Matt listened to your crap,
and look where that got him.

61
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,689
The guy is a complete stain.

62
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,587
- Matt deceives you.
- I don't...

63
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,527
He does because he, in actuality,
really knows which end is up.

64
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:10,804
What's up, man?

65
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,247
So Dustin's bailing on us again.

66
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,377
Really? I'm gonna alert the press, man.
Dustin's always bailing.

67
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:24,125
I'll always skate.
I just won't be homeless with you.

68
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,659
You say that,
but I know you mean something else.

69
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:31,357
Before you know it, you'll be a fat,
middle-aged male with a nice beer gut...

70
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,163
...divorced about 20 times,
wishing you were skating again.

71
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:36,965
Dudes.

72
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:40,875
- Get the moron out of the pool.
- Matt.

73
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:45,743
When is the moron gonna
release his death grip on our premises?

74
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:48,315
Have you smelled it lately?
It's like an open sewer.

75
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:51,385
- Good to see you too, Pops.
- We need to talk about your future.

76
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,046
Yeah, you know, I'd love to,
but we're heading out to this...

77
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:58,586
- Sugarplum.
- I hate when he calls me that.

78
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:02,226
Listen, remember our deal.

79
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,232
- Dad, l...
- Don't "Dad" me. We had a deal.

80
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:10,338
You're either in school, or you're at Rivers
Hardware working next to your old man.

81
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:14,237
Sniffing a little of that lacquer
while you're mixing the paint. Come on!

82
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,743
Obvious perks there.
It's a good living. It's a good future.

83
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:21,173
It's a good life. I'll tell you that much.
Think about it.

84
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,409
Yeah. Let's go, honey.

85
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,617
Get in there, you little...

86
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,750
Dude, your stepmom is so hot.

87
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,194
See the way she was looking at me?

88
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:34,693
I was like...

89
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:50,577
- Hello?
- Good afternoon, Chili N Such.

90
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:53,408
- Can I scoop for you?
- I'd like chili' Fire in the Hole...

91
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,416
...hotter than hell'
make it meat in the ass.

92
00:08:56,652 --> 00:08:58,017
Hey there.

93
00:08:58,187 --> 00:09:01,486
Hi, I ordered a Tummy-Killer Ranchero...

94
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:04,785
...and I got a Double-Chunk Gut Bomb
with cheese by mistake.

95
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,929
- I'd like what I ordered.
- Sorry, sir.

96
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,959
- Hello?
- I didn't get that, sir. Could you...?

97
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,862
- Could you repeat that?
- Open your ears, jackass!

98
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:16,095
Yeah, I see that you already ate
the Gut Bomb, though.

99
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:21,005
Yeah, but I can't help it that I didn't
figure it out until I'd swallowed it all.

100
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:24,176
- You really think you need another?
- What?

101
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:25,974
Mr. Knight, let me handle this.

102
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:30,585
Sir, our policy clearly states every customer
will be served to his satisfaction.

103
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:34,018
Customer may receive a replacement...
Excuse me, I'll be right with you.

104
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,717
A replacement will be given as long
as he has a receipt. You have one?

105
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:41,294
All right, that's good.
Give him one of these. You're late, Eric.

106
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:43,261
You're just a little bit late.

107
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,662
And late is not great.

108
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,865
Do you wanna go to the restroom
before I reload you?

109
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:52,769
- You want me to call the grownup back?
- You're probably leaking beans.

110
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:56,673
One big scoop. That's two,
but two is enough. Two is plenty.

111
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,178
Now, let's go over here
and do the cheddar.

112
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:03,250
Two scoops of cheddar, one scoop
of onion. That's very good, son.

113
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:07,617
You know, Eric, you've got great potential.
Just go to it. You go to it, deputy.

114
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,655
Attaboy! Fire in the Hole!

115
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:11,650
One Fire in the Hole there.

116
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:14,091
No, sir, we don't have diet.

117
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,025
Two hours till the demo. Let's get
this place cleaned up and get out.

118
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,761
I can't. I need the overtime.

119
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:24,662
Oh, boy!

120
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,937
Boy! Someone really abused the men's
room. It's like a doody bomb exploded.

121
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:33,177
Was he a tall guy with glasses maybe?
Just a hunch.

122
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:36,508
- Think this is funny, Mr. Knight?
- No, I don't.

123
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:40,053
Show a little team spirit. Go in there
and make it sparkle. Here you go.

124
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,190
- It'll be my pleasure.
- Thank you, sir.

125
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,383
Hey, listen. Wear gloves, buddy.

126
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,293
Keep laughing, Eric, but I'm gonna be at
college in the fall, and you'll still be here.

127
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:53,762
And you, sir.
There's a birthday party at table 13.

128
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,868
Need you in the bean suit.

129
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,398
You're kidding me.
The bean suit again?

130
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,107
Bean suit right away.

131
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:05,104
Thank you, sir.

132
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,245
- Whose birthday is it?
- Ours.

133
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,445
I'm Sheriff Bean.

134
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,748
Ladies and gentlemen' put your hands
together and scream...

135
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,908
...because it is on today' Chicago.

136
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:21,489
I don't know if you were praying last night'
but we got some great weather today.

137
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,491
- I can't believe you quit.
- Shut up and pay attention.

138
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:29,327
This is insane. I've never seen anyone
do these lines at the park.

139
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:31,463
- Cold?
- Jimmy Wilson!

140
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:34,603
Give it up! That's right, Chicago.

141
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:37,071
Jimmy, over here!

142
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:43,711
Look at all those hot chicks lining up
to get a crack at him.

143
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:48,278
- There is no bruised fruit in that medley.
- No beasts.

144
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:52,650
You know what? It's more than that.
This guy is skating for a living.

145
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:18,704
- You guys wanna go check out the vert?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,955
Mommy!

147
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,120
Can you move, in case one
of those skaters looks over here?

148
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:34,456
- I'm a professional skater, baby.
- Yeah, right.

149
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,589
I'm telling you the truth. I'm not skating
today, because I thrashed my arm.

150
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:42,259
Here, smell this. You think it's more like
pepperoni or ass crack?

151
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:45,066
I got 5 bucks on pepperoni.

152
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,732
You're so gross, man.

153
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,636
You'll be back.

154
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:21,870
- Think he does his own laundry?
- Are you kidding me?

155
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,548
He gets sick of his shirt, he takes it off
and he gets a new one for free.

156
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,148
I want!

157
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,851
You need to earn your rank here.

158
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:38,853
Check it out.

159
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,256
Jimmy Wilson!

160
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:50,565
Yeah!

161
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:09,523
Can you imagine for five seconds
what it must be like to ride in that thing?

162
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,421
Hell, yeah.

163
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:14,085
Girls, money...

164
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:17,027
...signing autographs,
making the girls go...

165
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,326
Look at this. Look at this.

166
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:28,707
No way, man!

167
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,435
Pinch me.

168
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:36,546
Let's go.

169
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,580
Don't I know you from Chili N Such?

170
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,585
Breasts.

171
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:48,295
I like them two at a time and round.
Ladies!

172
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:51,794
I represent
the Release the Twins Foundation.

173
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:54,162
You guys wanna make a little donation?

174
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:57,897
- What are you talking about?
- About releasing those twins.

175
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:02,007
They look uncomfortable
in their little cages. Come out!

176
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:04,940
It's no wonder why you can't get a date.

177
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:07,309
It was working.

178
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:12,412
- I'm in a dry spell, man.
- To be in a dry spell...

179
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:15,921
...you've had to have been in a wet spell.
- I've had sex.

180
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:18,252
Yeah, with a human, though.

181
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:22,653
Who's making these rules, man?

182
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:30,396
Product toss.

183
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,571
I love it when these little freaks
tear each other's skin off for a sticker.

184
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:50,054
What is he doing?

185
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,863
I had to skin a 9-year-old
for that, man.

186
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,036
You needed a board.

187
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:03,933
It's yours.

188
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:10,702
Let's see if we can talk to Jimmy
before we jet.

189
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:13,879
Excuse me, sir,
we're here to see Jimmy.

190
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,847
- Oh, my freaking Lord!
- Oh, my God! Get it away.

191
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,079
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, sir.

192
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:25,750
We are just here to see Jimmy. Is he in the
scar...? The car? The bus? That where he is?

193
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:28,829
- That's a big "no" on Jimmy.
- Good. Thank you.

194
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:31,295
- What are you looking at, pinhead?
- No.

195
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,362
What's up?

196
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,710
Actually, we're here to see Jimmy.
He told me to drop this tape by for him.

197
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:47,107
- I think he wants to sponsor us.
- That's cool.

198
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:50,445
- I'm stoked.
- That's great, guys. Hang on just a minute.

199
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,177
All right.

200
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,652
Let's see.

201
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,487
- Cool.
- There you go.

202
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,960
Yeah. This is just today's haul.

203
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,626
- Excuse me, that's all from today?
- Yeah.

204
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:12,399
- "Sponsor me." Two very popular words.
- How does he have time to watch all those?

205
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:16,442
Well, he's worked out this technique
where he doesn't watch any of them.

206
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:19,638
It's working out really well for him. Yeah.

207
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,647
- Should I bounce these nerds out of here?
- No, they're cool. You guys are cool, right?

208
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:30,519
- Yeah, we're straight.
- I'm cool.

209
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,126
- It's okay.
- All right.

210
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:39,323
So I'm here to help you.
I don't want you to get in trouble.

211
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:44,268
Because the truth is, Jimmy did want us
to come by and say what's up, you know?

212
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:47,340
And if you could just get us in
for two minutes...

213
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:49,976
- I can do that.
- You can do that.

214
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:54,411
But I'm not going to do that,
because I don't want to.

215
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,814
And I just can't seem to find my way
around that.

216
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:02,218
I'm sorry. I really wish you guys
all the best in the world, sincerely.

217
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,760
You know, but... You know, hey.
Guys, just skate, you know?

218
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:10,023
And if you're really any good,
then someone will find you.

219
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,461
All right?

220
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,325
All right.

221
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:17,866
- Now would be a good time.
- Hey! Get out of here!

222
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:22,004
Nice kids. I like them.
Don't you like them?

223
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:23,303
I like them.

224
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:35,285
All right, so pack your shit.
We're going on tour.

225
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:37,618
- When do we leave?
- Did somebody see our tapes?

226
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:41,058
- Whose team are we on?
- Hold on. Hold on.

227
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:44,662
Live for your viewing pleasure.

228
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:47,865
We are Super Duper Skates.

229
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:52,564
Dear Lord, Eric!
I am never, ever going to wear that.

230
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,608
The whole thing sort of sounds sketchy.
I'm sorry.

231
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,677
I never heard of this Super Duper Skates.

232
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:00,842
Yeah, I know.
That's because I just made it up.

233
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:03,450
Wake up and smell the desperation.

234
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,081
We needed a company name
to give us credibility on tour.

235
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:10,350
- On tour?
- Right. We're hitting the road as a team.

236
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:14,086
- We skate better than half of those guys.
- Yeah, I can. It's weird.

237
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:18,199
There you go. Jimmy's a man, right? Once
we're on the road, we follow him around.

238
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:21,427
We get in front of him one time,
he'll see we're the real deal.

239
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,397
That does sound super-duper.

240
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:28,634
But I really don't... I mean,
I'm just saying, if you think about it...

241
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,337
No, it's cool. It's cool. You two
can sit here and touch yourselves...

242
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:37,281
...for the rest of your lives, or you can try
getting off your asses and making it happen.

243
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,682
That's about a nine
on the Richter scale, man.

244
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:44,588
I think he's saying we got a nest egg
here, and we're extraordinarily comfortable.

245
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,864
Slug Bug!

246
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,062
Mr. Rivers!

247
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,335
Slug Bug!

248
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,135
Mr. Rivers.

249
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:03,203
Kids dig me.

250
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:06,170
- When's her lease up?
- Where's the money we're using...

251
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,282
...on this trip coming from?

252
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:17,553
- Stop looking at me.
- You can do this. You have no choice.

253
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:20,092
- I absolutely am not doing it. I can't.
- You can.

254
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:24,092
No. Don't even talk... I'm not.
There's no way in hell I'm doing it.

255
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:25,828
What?

256
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:30,931
Now that the money issue is settled,
where are we gonna get some wheels?

257
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,006
We just got to find a van.

258
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:35,235
I got it!

259
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,792
That was my mom's.

260
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,123
This was actually my grandma's,
this little bellybutton ring.

261
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,458
- It's crazy.
- That's so sweet.

262
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,930
I like the way you guys smell.

263
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,734
- Sweet Lou.
- See you girls later.

264
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,565
- What's going on?
- What's up, fool?

265
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,368
- How are you guys doing?
- Doing good.

266
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,169
Matt Jensen.

267
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:12,674
- Good to see you guys.
- So, dude, listen, we're thinking...

268
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:15,078
...about joining the Jimmy Wilson Tour.
- Really?

269
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,311
Yeah. It's gonna be phat. We need a fourth
skater, so we were thinking about you.

270
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:21,586
Naturally, but...

271
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:24,252
Sweet Lou's got everything
he needs right here.

272
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:29,593
What? Okay. Dude, we're going
cross-country. You know what that means.

273
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,233
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you do.

274
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,631
No. What does that mean?

275
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:41,469
Dude, chicks in different area codes.
Uncharted territory.

276
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:44,942
I got pros
I got pros

277
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,013
You know what I'm saying?

278
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:49,946
It's tempting, but...

279
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,685
I don't know.

280
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,354
You know, school just let out and all.

281
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:57,617
Didn't you graduate six years ago?

282
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:59,618
Yeah.

283
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,490
But they didn't.

284
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:05,733
- Hi.
- Again, a good point.

285
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:09,029
Well...

286
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:13,271
Maybe it's none of my business
or anything...

287
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:16,468
...but don't you think maybe you should
move on? A little change?

288
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:21,048
It's just too easy, sitting here year after
year, watching the new crop roll in...

289
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:22,740
...and me just taking my pick.

290
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,984
Besides, my calendar
is already pretty booked.

291
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:28,349
You saw those two Betties
that were here before?

292
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:31,017
They're just my Tuesday.

293
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:32,820
You should see Friday.

294
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,626
Yeah, we should hang out.

295
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:39,233
You guys have fun on your little road trip,
but count me out.

296
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,197
All right, man, well I'm gonna miss you.

297
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:45,839
- Hey, Lou.
- Hey, Wednesday.

298
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,438
It's Sandy.

299
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,872
Right.

300
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:51,740
I've been trying you all day.

301
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:55,280
Sandy, chill.
I told you, I'd call you.

302
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,712
Wednesday.

303
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,682
Don't get so extended.

304
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,981
What's up, baby? Matt Jensen.

305
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,050
I'm okay with that and everything,
but my dad is crazed.

306
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:09,129
- You told your dad?
- Yeah. He says he's gonna kill you...

307
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:12,460
...and then dangle your balls
from his rear-view mirror.

308
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:16,861
Daddy!

309
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:26,080
- What's the first stop?
- Wait! You're in?

310
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,284
Daddy, don't hurt him! Please!

311
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:36,885
- Call me!
- Bye, Lou!

312
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,549
Call me on Wednesday, okay?

313
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:55,069
One more thing, dude.

314
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,555
Not bad.

315
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:18,731
Van Gogh.

316
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,864
- Let's roll.
- Cool.

317
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:27,901
Dustin was supposed to be here
a half-hour ago.

318
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,975
- What about my overtime?
- You don't need it.

319
00:25:37,152 --> 00:25:39,712
- What about college?
- Consider this your full ride.

320
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:42,118
Then I need to go back
and get my special pillow.

321
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,951
Get inside!

322
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:47,420
Excuse me, Mr. Knight,
your shift is not over!

323
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:49,587
You have not punched out, Mr. Knight!

324
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:51,595
Mr. Knight!

325
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:55,165
Where are we going?

326
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,928
Jimmy Wilson's skating the Pro-Am contest
in Kansas. It's our first stop.

327
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:18,252
Damn, it smells like roses.

328
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,195
I done farted!

329
00:26:21,896 --> 00:26:24,490
Why you always gotta base
in my face, fool?

330
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,928
Yo, yo, check it.

331
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,436
All right, Kansas,
are you ready to go big?

332
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:37,908
I knew you knew who I was!
You saw that front cover, baby.

333
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,808
Watch out, son.

334
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:43,107
Yo, I know you wannabes
are not here to skate!

335
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:45,219
What's up, white chocolate?

336
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,512
Don't be talking no head, fool.
Red Crip, tell them what's up.

337
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,626
- Yeah, I'm feeling to bust you in your grills.
- Yeah, in your grills, dog!

338
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:55,820
Our grills?
Is there some sort of barbecue later?

339
00:26:57,165 --> 00:27:00,100
The party is at Rolling Deuce tonight.
It should be pretty cool.

340
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:02,896
- Sounds cool.
- She's talking to Matt Ball, dude.

341
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:07,769
All right, no worries.
I got this under control.

342
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,645
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

343
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:13,042
Eric Rivers,
with the Super Duper Skate team.

344
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,909
That's cute. Super Duper?

345
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,347
- That's great.
- Yeah, it's great.

346
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,444
Wait.

347
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,517
- You're not registered.
- I'm sure we're on there.

348
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:25,956
- We're sponsored, so...
- Okay.

349
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:30,920
I'm sorry. If you're not preregistered,
you can't skate this event. Next!

350
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:35,798
No, no. This is our first event as a team,
and we just drove all the way from Chicago.

351
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,202
And I basically kidnapped my best friend,
okay? And blew his only shot at college.

352
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:45,539
So if you could find some way to make
the list work, we'd be really thankful.

353
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:50,674
You know what? Tell your sob story
someplace else. We're all full up here.

354
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:52,479
Next.

355
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,582
Next!

356
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,087
Let me get in here.

357
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:02,059
I can't believe they've never heard of Super
Duper Skates. That's a freaking outrage.

358
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:05,664
All right, let's go skate the parking lot
and wait Jimmy out.

359
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,461
Don't be so harsh, mama.

360
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,227
Hook us up.

361
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:11,467
You know what?

362
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:14,468
Mama's already been hooked up.

363
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:17,776
Next.

364
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,743
Next.

365
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,245
Let's skate the lot.

366
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:29,088
Matt!

367
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:30,988
Matt!

368
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:17,000
- You all right?
- What happened?

369
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:19,637
- You all right, dude?
- What happened?

370
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:23,202
- I sprained my taint!
- Probably because you forgot to stretch.

371
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:27,007
- Listen, put some soda pop on it.
- Rub it clockwise, dude.

372
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:29,182
- What's that feel like?
- No, no, no, no.

373
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,314
You want a sip, man?

374
00:29:34,656 --> 00:29:36,681
Can you roll off the ramp
so we can skate?

375
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:40,191
- Let me get it from behind.
- Where did my board go?

376
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:56,872
Ladies, nice balloons. Nice.

377
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:03,245
Come over here for a second. Don't be
like that. I got a little trick for you. Hey!

378
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:05,448
Girls, how are you tonight?

379
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,453
Do a little trick?
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?

380
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:12,551
All right. We got this.

381
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:15,223
Like we've done it a million times.

382
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,830
I stepped in dog poo.

383
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,258
All right, hold up.

384
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:27,735
- That burns! What's that for?
- Because you need it.

385
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:34,378
Look at this line.

386
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:55,602
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I hate clowns.

387
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,567
Oh, I'm sure they'll let four guys in.

388
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,120
Check this out.

389
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,985
What's up?

390
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:22,489
Watch out, son.

391
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,532
Yo, muscles, check it, okay?

392
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,104
Check the list, girl.

393
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:33,331
Don't be scared.

394
00:31:33,508 --> 00:31:38,104
Come on, now, you know who we are.
Don't you know who we are? Come on!

395
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,645
You know who we are, right?

396
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,510
- What up, girls?
- Word up.

397
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:44,675
Thank you very much, mademoiselle.

398
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:47,787
All up in my business
All up in my business

399
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:50,288
Break out the Cristal, fool!

400
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:53,018
We up in here!

401
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:58,795
Eric, you're the shizit.

402
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,303
Check it out. It's Brian Patch.

403
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:11,944
Hey, Bam!

404
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,925
Bob Burnquist!

405
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:34,398
What's up, man? Matt Jensen.

406
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,369
Maybe she'll clean the van, dude!

407
00:32:57,358 --> 00:33:00,088
Come to papa.

408
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:03,020
Guys, come on, stay focused, all right?

409
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:07,600
Fan out, take advantage
of any opportunities, look for pros.

410
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:19,608
Oh, I'm sorry.

411
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,271
Brian Sumner!

412
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:23,883
What's up? How are you doing?

413
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,551
That's crazy.

414
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:37,161
So, what is your name?

415
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:39,060
What is it?

416
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:45,971
What's going on, baby?

417
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,903
What's up? You're cute.

418
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:49,703
- Yeah.
- Are you a pro skater?

419
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:52,539
I drove down from Springfield
to meet a pro skater.

420
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:55,239
- So did I.
- You're from Springfield?

421
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:58,908
No, I came here to meet
some skaters, man!

422
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,150
Why do I always end up talking
to the gay guy?

423
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:04,485
What?

424
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:06,215
No!

425
00:34:07,095 --> 00:34:09,996
I can't even hear what you said.
What did you say?

426
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:13,259
I can hear you fine.

427
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:15,925
I'm just not listening.

428
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:18,766
Okay.

429
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,398
Let me just get you
another glass of bitch.

430
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,634
Let's go. Okay.

431
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:29,577
You're drunk.

432
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,519
Ladies.

433
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,024
What's up?

434
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:47,457
Not much.

435
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,307
You wanna make out?

436
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:56,306
Yeah.

437
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,479
Stacy, come here.

438
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:15,062
What's going on, man?
How's it going?

439
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:18,721
It's so cool that I saw you here
because I'm trying to get sponsored...

440
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,391
...and I was wondering...
- It's not a good time.

441
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:26,666
I know. Seriously, right? I can't get anyone
to check my tape out. It's, like, impossible.

442
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,900
- So how did you get started?
- I'm working on something here.

443
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:33,569
Since this is a party,
you could go work on some for yourself.

444
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:37,412
Right.

445
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:40,247
Right on. All right, no worries.

446
00:36:26,634 --> 00:36:28,898
- I'm all out. You want another drink?
- Sure.

447
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,731
Okay.

448
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:35,738
- Hey.
- What's going on?

449
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,902
It's our song, dude! Come on!

450
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:42,805
Come on, bitch.

451
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:45,248
You too. Move.

452
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,154
- You're doing it. Yeah.
- I don't know.

453
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:51,921
I don't wanna do it.
I don't like this song.

454
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:53,651
I don't wanna.

455
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:56,490
You know what? Shut up.

456
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,056
All right, come on.

457
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:08,326
Come on.

458
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:10,367
I'm going.

459
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,832
Come on.

460
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:16,874
Trouble in the house!

461
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:22,514
Well, at least we got to hang
at the party.

462
00:38:22,683 --> 00:38:25,174
Hell, yeah, man.

463
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:31,718
Dude, where's Sweet Lou?

464
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:48,700
What are you doing?

465
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:50,468
Why...?

466
00:38:50,644 --> 00:38:52,271
Why would you do...? Get off me!

467
00:38:52,446 --> 00:38:54,539
- This is vacation!
- Get off me! Get off!

468
00:38:54,715 --> 00:39:00,745
Why would you do that? I'm gonna vomit!
Do it again, and I'll castrate you like salami.

469
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,889
What are you gonna do?

470
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:05,116
- What are you gonna do?
- I swear to God!

471
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:08,921
Why would you throw out my book?
Because you can't read? It makes you mad?

472
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,087
Try it again! Try it again!

473
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:13,327
What now? What now?

474
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:17,401
Guys, look, it's those whigga dicks!

475
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,838
Nice bunny nostril!

476
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:22,942
- What? What?
- What, dog?

477
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,771
What are you doing here?

478
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,014
- Look out!
- Damn!

479
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:31,315
Fire!

480
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:34,113
- Get me something!
- What now?

481
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:39,988
Fire in the hole!

482
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:42,129
Put that away. What you gonna do?

483
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:46,730
Taste our pain, bitches!

484
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:49,301
Yeah, bomb them with it, dog!

485
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:51,266
Yeah!

486
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,304
Peace out!

487
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:07,812
It's got a pool.

488
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:29,470
And you boys said that we
wouldn't have any fun.

489
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:32,635
I'm catching hepatitis
just looking at it.

490
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:41,046
Oh, my little friend.

491
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:44,482
There's a lot of good meat on you.

492
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:51,058
I don't care how skinny you get.
I am still gonna eat you.

493
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:53,063
Excuse me.

494
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,330
Well, hello!

495
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:03,409
So how much for a room?

496
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:09,243
Well, it's $ 10 an hour,
and 40 for the whole night.

497
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:13,079
I guess that depends what you playboys
got in mind, huh?

498
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:14,949
Yeah, yeah.

499
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:21,023
You're crazy.

500
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:24,228
All right. You know what?

501
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,765
We'll clean your pool
if you let us crash here tonight.

502
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:31,371
Oh, yeah, my skimmer's been broken.

503
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:35,771
All right. You do the deed,
and Room 126 is yours.

504
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:38,503
And that, my friend,
is the honeymoon suite.

505
00:43:11,538 --> 00:43:13,870
Pop the hood, man.

506
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:18,968
This is the honeymoon suite. Just...

507
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:24,711
There's only one bed,
and there's four guys.

508
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:33,824
I got it! I got it!

509
00:43:34,895 --> 00:43:36,556
This is my side!

510
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:39,058
Get off me!

511
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,391
Manties!

512
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:46,973
What the...? What?

513
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:50,042
You did not just find these in that bed.

514
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:57,347
Yo, D.

515
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:02,913
You still pissed at me?

516
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:08,186
No, man, forget about it.

517
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:10,690
Good times.

518
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,032
You really think we have a chance?

519
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:24,374
I don't know, dude.
This is what I want in life.

520
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:26,945
This is what I was meant to do.

521
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:30,847
If we focus...

522
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:34,715
...there's no reason
why we don't have a chance.

523
00:44:39,493 --> 00:44:42,758
Greetings from the interior.

524
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:48,467
- Matt!
- I think I can taste that one.

525
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,731
Matt!

526
00:44:55,242 --> 00:44:56,539
That wasn't me.

527
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:01,670
Sorry. That was me.
Can I have my underwear back?

528
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,179
Slug Bug!

529
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:44,016
- Butt slap.
- I was playing by the rules.

530
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:48,127
- God!
- I am so sick of this butt rock music, man.

531
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:51,958
- Don't change it.
- No! I need some beats, dude.

532
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,734
I'll snap your neck like a glowstick!

533
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,295
Nice tits. Can I squeeze them?

534
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:08,211
What the hell is this?

535
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:10,816
Are you serious?

536
00:46:11,718 --> 00:46:14,482
Just listen and learn, boys.

537
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:25,917
So glad to be skating this summer, boys,
instead of McJobbing it.

538
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,618
Two scoops cheddar, one scoop onion,
my friend.

539
00:47:28,795 --> 00:47:31,320
- Sweet Lou needs fuel.
- Right on.

540
00:47:31,498 --> 00:47:33,398
What do you say, Dust?
Spot us some cash.

541
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:36,661
Listen, I already put out for gas
and put out for food...

542
00:47:36,837 --> 00:47:38,498
...and I put out for porn.

543
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:40,105
You're so stingy, you punk.

544
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,242
Damn it! Why?

545
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:45,936
- I didn't even know I was going!
- It's so... I just got peed on.

546
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,879
All right, all right, all right.
I got a plan.

547
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:53,178
They got one of these in Colorado?

548
00:47:53,654 --> 00:47:54,985
I hate Chili N Such.

549
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:57,419
All right, bro, you know the drill.

550
00:47:57,925 --> 00:47:59,950
Oh, yes, I do.

551
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,186
Wait, what are we doing?

552
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:03,991
We don't have any cash.

553
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:05,961
Chili, chili, chili, chili.

554
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,431
What are you doing?

555
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:18,341
I dropped something,
and I'm looking for it.

556
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:21,140
I had curly cheese fries,
lots of them, and a shake.

557
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:25,183
Okay. Didn't your mom ever tell you
not to talk to strangers?

558
00:48:26,587 --> 00:48:30,318
I guess she didn't say anything about
puking on them, though. Thank you.

559
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:33,218
Chili, chili, chili, chili...

560
00:48:49,142 --> 00:48:50,871
- Hello?
- Welcome to Chili N Such.

561
00:48:51,044 --> 00:48:52,875
- Can I scoop for you?
- So listen...

562
00:48:53,046 --> 00:48:56,379
...I was actually by here
about an hour ago.

563
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:02,489
And we ordered 10 Gut Bomb
Chili Surprises and five shakes.

564
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:06,820
It's funny because when I got home,
there were actually only coffees...

565
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:09,554
- Chili.
...in the bag.

566
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:13,427
I remember that order. Drive through'
and we'll replace it.

567
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:27,746
"Animal Chin Skate Shop.

568
00:49:27,914 --> 00:49:31,077
Internationally renowned skateboarder
Jimmy Wilson...

569
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:34,743
...discovered here, 1992."

570
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:38,755
Yeah, but where is Jimmy's bus?
Shouldn't there be a big crowd here?

571
00:49:38,925 --> 00:49:41,359
I don't know, bro. Maybe we're early.

572
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:43,860
Let's go scope it out.

573
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:47,427
- What's up, yo?
- "What's up, yo?"

574
00:49:49,436 --> 00:49:50,562
How's it going there?

575
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,069
- Jimmy Wilson?
- Jimmy Wilson. The demo.

576
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,935
Check this cut.

577
00:50:03,684 --> 00:50:05,379
Excuse me!

578
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:07,713
We're here for Jimmy's demo.
Jimmy Wilson.

579
00:50:07,888 --> 00:50:09,753
Do you know Jimmy?

580
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,584
Jimmy was gnarly.

581
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,623
Jimmy was...

582
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:17,025
Jimmy was Jimmy. Jimmy was...

583
00:50:17,297 --> 00:50:19,390
...off the hook.

584
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:21,558
Off the hook.

585
00:50:21,735 --> 00:50:23,600
You know?

586
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,759
Jimmy was...

587
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,565
Jimmy was:

588
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:34,070
- I'm sorry, did you say, "was"?
- Did you guys see...?

589
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:36,147
Today is...

590
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:41,050
Today is Saturday. Today is Sunday.
The demo was yesterday.

591
00:50:41,221 --> 00:50:42,984
- Goddamn it.
- It happened already?

592
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:47,490
Did you guys see...?
Jimmy was, like:

593
00:50:51,665 --> 00:50:55,294
Yeah, Saturday, man. Saturday.
Demo was Saturday.

594
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:59,735
- Today is Sunday. So Saturday plus a day...
- You said that.

595
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:02,466
...is Sunday.
- It happened already!

596
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,769
It already happened.

597
00:51:04,945 --> 00:51:06,742
I think you guys missed a day.

598
00:51:06,913 --> 00:51:07,937
We lost a day.

599
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:11,744
Jimmy was something. He was...
He was old school.

600
00:51:12,285 --> 00:51:14,685
You know what I'm saying? He was like:

601
00:51:17,124 --> 00:51:19,524
That was Jimmy right there.

602
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:26,361
All right, well, what do we do?
I mean, since we're already here...

603
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:29,525
...there's not much we can do now.

604
00:51:30,203 --> 00:51:32,296
So at least we can skate the lot.

605
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:34,463
You guys know Jimmy?

606
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:38,975
No. Is it cool if we just...?

607
00:51:39,146 --> 00:51:41,046
Jimmy was gnarly, bro.

608
00:51:41,214 --> 00:51:43,045
He was awesome, dudes.

609
00:51:43,216 --> 00:51:46,379
Do you mind if we at least set
some cones up out there?

610
00:51:46,553 --> 00:51:48,111
Do a little demo of our own?

611
00:51:48,655 --> 00:51:50,816
You wanna skate the park?

612
00:52:20,253 --> 00:52:21,845
What's up?

613
00:52:22,022 --> 00:52:23,922
You.

614
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:27,685
Nice.

615
00:52:31,932 --> 00:52:34,196
Dude, you're pretty badass.

616
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:36,801
- Thanks, man.
- But I could totally take you.

617
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,437
Dude, what grade are you in?

618
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:41,369
Seventh. I'm 12, bitch.

619
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:44,040
And you got something to teach me?

620
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:47,772
All right, how about you talk to me
when you're out of diapers.

621
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:10,095
That kid is totally taking you.
What is he in, seventh grade?

622
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,231
I wonder if he's got a sister.

623
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:15,964
You wanna make out?

624
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:20,137
Yeah, sure.

625
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:31,986
- Where's the product toss?
- Where's the free stuff?

626
00:53:32,158 --> 00:53:35,821
If you losers are really sponsored,
where's the free stuff?

627
00:53:41,668 --> 00:53:46,002
What do you say you and me lose
this dead weight and hit the strip clubs?

628
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:50,102
I like your style, kid. Keep it up.

629
00:53:53,013 --> 00:53:55,641
- Where's the stuff?
- Lil' Bow Wow, keep barking...

630
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,682
...and it's a one-way walk in the woods.
- You got jokes?

631
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:02,083
- I don't got jokes, I got threats.
- Man, give me your skateboard.

632
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:07,186
Man, give me a T-shirt!
Man, give me your shoes! Give me...

633
00:54:08,795 --> 00:54:12,390
- In your face!
- Your team sucks!

634
00:54:12,565 --> 00:54:15,557
Our team doesn't suck!
What is wrong with their eyes?

635
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:18,602
In the van! In the van! Product toss.
Look at that, free hat.

636
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,067
Shirt!

637
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:23,335
Let's get out of here!

638
00:54:23,643 --> 00:54:25,907
Ride my fingerboard, bitches!

639
00:54:44,564 --> 00:54:46,828
All right.

640
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:50,331
Yeah, you got good hands.

641
00:54:50,837 --> 00:54:52,327
Can you go deeper?

642
00:54:52,505 --> 00:54:54,666
Oh, yeah, that's deep.

643
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,242
This is fantastic.

644
00:54:59,412 --> 00:55:01,573
What about doing my glutes next?

645
00:55:01,748 --> 00:55:03,010
With what, my face?

646
00:55:15,028 --> 00:55:17,360
Shit.

647
00:55:29,275 --> 00:55:31,266
Put some elbow into it, man.

648
00:55:31,444 --> 00:55:34,038
I'll put some elbow into your face.

649
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:39,917
How we gonna get Jimmy Wilson to see us
if we can't even skate a contest?

650
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,350
How we gonna get girls to see us?

651
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:45,184
Have you been in a coma this entire time?

652
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:47,121
They're everywhere.

653
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:50,194
Sweet Lou is all over
this little pro chick right now.

654
00:55:50,363 --> 00:55:52,888
Why does that bother you so much?

655
00:55:53,466 --> 00:55:55,195
Because it's not happening to me.

656
00:55:55,368 --> 00:55:59,532
If you would change your clothes,
even one time, there might... I don't know.

657
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:03,899
What's wrong with you?

658
00:56:04,077 --> 00:56:05,772
My college fund is gutted.

659
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:10,815
Well, that's what separates the men
from the boys.

660
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:13,742
Maybe I can get my job back.

661
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,252
You know what, Sweet Lou?

662
00:56:16,423 --> 00:56:18,823
I got a rule, man.

663
00:56:18,992 --> 00:56:22,086
No more of these freaky, spazzy chicks...

664
00:56:22,262 --> 00:56:24,423
...coming across state lines
with us, man.

665
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:27,327
That's what's bringing
this team vibe down!

666
00:56:28,501 --> 00:56:32,164
It's my van. It's my rules.

667
00:56:32,939 --> 00:56:34,998
And I like her.

668
00:56:37,944 --> 00:56:42,108
At least there's no way in hell
that this could get any worse.

669
00:56:44,017 --> 00:56:47,953
In the name of all things holy.
Are you kidding me, man?

670
00:56:48,121 --> 00:56:52,182
I'm sorry. Are you upset with the fact
that I've worked hard and saved money?

671
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:56,124
And with that money, I happened
to buy a little food for myself?

672
00:56:58,631 --> 00:56:59,655
It's bread.

673
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,368
No!

674
00:57:05,538 --> 00:57:07,028
I said, no girls!

675
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:10,732
No! God, stop!

676
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:16,972
Damn it!

677
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:32,490
At least she left our stuff.

678
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,232
Touche.

679
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:48,009
We're gonna die out here.
We have no food and no car.

680
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,513
Seriously, anyone,
what are we gonna do?

681
00:57:50,683 --> 00:57:52,514
I thought she was a sweet girl.

682
00:57:52,685 --> 00:57:56,280
That's her ass you're thinking about,
not her depraved criminal mind.

683
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:59,584
Wham, bam, steal the van.

684
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:03,690
We just need something. Some kind
of sign to tell us to keep going.

685
00:58:03,863 --> 00:58:06,093
Do we? I'm sure we're gonna get a sign.

686
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:10,202
Look, Jimmy Wilson is coming over the hill
right now to give us a big deal.

687
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:14,033
There he is. Look, there's his bus,
and he's got a scholarship for me.

688
00:58:14,207 --> 00:58:17,665
Oh, no, wait. That's a mirage because
we're in the middle of the desert!

689
00:58:31,724 --> 00:58:33,885
- Tucson, that's where we're headed?
- Yeah.

690
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,857
That's good.

691
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:42,827
No one's food here!

692
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:53,637
I just had the wildest dream, man.

693
00:59:20,338 --> 00:59:22,272
What are you doing?

694
00:59:26,944 --> 00:59:28,741
Save me!

695
00:59:30,448 --> 00:59:32,211
Look! It's a lizard!

696
00:59:32,383 --> 00:59:36,012
I just got violated by a lizard, man.

697
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:46,963
Actually, that felt kind of good.

698
00:59:53,704 --> 00:59:57,538
- Somebody's coming.
- All right, you guys hang back. All right?

699
00:59:57,708 --> 00:59:59,471
And hide Matt.

700
00:59:59,644 --> 01:00:01,635
Come here, buddy.

701
01:00:01,812 --> 01:00:05,304
- Did you just say, "buddy"?
- Shut up.

702
01:00:21,232 --> 01:00:23,530
Nice ass!

703
01:00:29,173 --> 01:00:30,868
Hey.

704
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:34,273
I'm on my way to Tucson. Climb in.

705
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:50,918
What's up?

706
01:00:51,095 --> 01:00:53,586
Hi. How are you?

707
01:00:53,764 --> 01:00:55,755
Real good.

708
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,261
Sweet Lou!

709
01:00:58,436 --> 01:01:00,495
Nice catch, man.

710
01:01:02,707 --> 01:01:05,107
All right, I'll check you guys later.

711
01:01:53,157 --> 01:01:54,818
- That ain't gonna happen.
- What?

712
01:01:54,992 --> 01:01:58,985
Come on. Do you work out?
Can we sit down and talk about it?

713
01:01:59,163 --> 01:02:00,596
- Bam! Bam!
- What's up?

714
01:02:00,765 --> 01:02:02,733
What's going on? Remember me from...?

715
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,993
- The skate shop, right?
- Skate shop. Exactly.

716
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:07,603
- He's with me.
- I'm with him.

717
01:02:08,439 --> 01:02:10,339
So how's everything going?

718
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:12,203
Yeah, really good.

719
01:02:13,944 --> 01:02:16,105
So this is crazy, huh?

720
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,679
Yeah, it is pretty insane.

721
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:22,483
I know your schedule and everything
like that has gotta be pretty nuts...

722
01:02:22,653 --> 01:02:25,645
...but if you have five minutes,
could you just check this out?

723
01:02:25,823 --> 01:02:28,656
It's a tape we put together.
Could you pass it on to Jimmy?

724
01:02:28,959 --> 01:02:32,087
I got so much shit on my plate,
the last thing I need now...

725
01:02:32,263 --> 01:02:34,959
...is looking at some random
"sponsor me" tape.

726
01:02:35,266 --> 01:02:38,497
- Sorry about that.
- That's cool. I figured I'd give it a shot.

727
01:02:38,669 --> 01:02:42,400
Give me the tape. Of course I'll watch it.
I'm not that big of a dick.

728
01:02:42,673 --> 01:02:45,540
- Thanks. That's great.
- Cool.

729
01:02:46,077 --> 01:02:48,341
You talking shit about me?

730
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:50,806
Jamie, do you really wanna
do this now?

731
01:02:50,981 --> 01:02:53,006
Have the balls to say it to my face.

732
01:02:53,384 --> 01:02:56,410
Okay, I'm saying it to your face.
I don't want you here.

733
01:02:56,587 --> 01:02:59,021
Okay? The last thing
I need on this tour...

734
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,887
...is some haggard-ass
chick lurking around.

735
01:03:04,395 --> 01:03:06,090
Just take it easy, man.

736
01:03:06,263 --> 01:03:08,629
What? You serious?

737
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:13,031
Yeah, relax. I mean, she doesn't
need you insulting her.

738
01:03:13,871 --> 01:03:19,104
If you wanted me to watch your tape,
you pretty much ruined that. So...

739
01:03:24,014 --> 01:03:25,743
Thanks.

740
01:03:27,918 --> 01:03:31,115
Hey, so, that was pretty harsh, huh?

741
01:03:31,288 --> 01:03:33,984
I think I can take care of myself.

742
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:38,361
No, I figured that.
I mean, I can tell, but...

743
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,357
You know, everybody could use
a little backup once in a while.

744
01:03:48,572 --> 01:03:50,472
Wanna get out of here?

745
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,973
You serious?

746
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,681
I don't think anybody is home.

747
01:04:04,955 --> 01:04:07,480
Let's just get in
and out real fast, okay?

748
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:10,184
Hello?

749
01:04:10,828 --> 01:04:14,787
- Anybody home?
- Hey, Matt, don't touch anything, okay?

750
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:17,599
Mirrored ceilings.

751
01:04:17,835 --> 01:04:20,133
We got this place to ourselves, man.

752
01:04:20,304 --> 01:04:23,205
Oh, black leather.
That's just how Snoop would do it.

753
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:27,003
- Oh, come on.
- Good.

754
01:04:27,311 --> 01:04:29,336
Hey, ladies...

755
01:04:30,414 --> 01:04:34,646
...l'm Jimmy Wilson.
Tonight you're gonna be my love slaves.

756
01:04:37,021 --> 01:04:38,579
There it is.

757
01:04:39,456 --> 01:04:43,358
Stop it for five seconds. All right, Jimbo,
just gonna bust a little switcheroo.

758
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:46,257
You hit play, you're gonna enjoy
the Super Duper team demo.

759
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:49,365
I've been holding it for two days.
It's about to go downtown.

760
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:53,401
Good idea. Take a crap on his bus.
He would appreciate that.

761
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,351
I got it. Let's go.

762
01:05:14,758 --> 01:05:18,854
All right, dude, let's go.
I did it. Let's go.

763
01:05:21,832 --> 01:05:23,265
Dude.

764
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:29,828
I might not get a piece of Jimmy Wilson,
but he got a piece of me.

765
01:05:30,074 --> 01:05:32,235
That smells like hermit craps.

766
01:05:33,911 --> 01:05:35,071
That was amazing, Jimmy!

767
01:05:35,246 --> 01:05:37,680
I've been waiting two years
to pull that trick.

768
01:05:37,848 --> 01:05:40,578
- We got it on footage, check it out.
- Let's see it.

769
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:44,517
Oh, no. What the hell?

770
01:05:44,688 --> 01:05:47,384
Tell me that's not
your only copy of the tape.

771
01:05:52,463 --> 01:05:54,226
Somebody broke the tour rule.

772
01:05:54,398 --> 01:05:56,559
I'll fix this. Let's get out of here.

773
01:05:56,734 --> 01:06:01,000
Who did number two on the bus, man?
How many times do I have to tell them?

774
01:06:02,072 --> 01:06:04,802
No going number two on my bus!

775
01:06:08,212 --> 01:06:09,736
So basically...

776
01:06:09,914 --> 01:06:14,078
...we've been following the Jimmy Wilson
Tour all over the country.

777
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:15,377
That's insane.

778
01:06:15,552 --> 01:06:18,885
Yeah. It sucks.
I had this whole thing planned out.

779
01:06:19,123 --> 01:06:22,320
All we had to do, get in front of him,
and it was so easy.

780
01:06:22,493 --> 01:06:25,519
He just had to see us skate,
and he'd pick us up.

781
01:06:25,896 --> 01:06:27,227
But...

782
01:06:27,398 --> 01:06:31,357
...of course, we found a way
to screw everything up...

783
01:06:31,635 --> 01:06:34,570
...and the whole thing
has turned into a disaster.

784
01:06:34,738 --> 01:06:37,730
You can't argue with talent. So...

785
01:06:37,908 --> 01:06:42,641
...just keep skating,
and someone will find you.

786
01:06:43,147 --> 01:06:45,741
- I know about these things.
- You must.

787
01:06:49,153 --> 01:06:54,090
I guess, by the way things went down,
you guys have been hooking up for a while.

788
01:06:55,492 --> 01:06:58,461
You think I'm into Bam
because he's on tour?

789
01:06:58,996 --> 01:07:02,557
I don't know. I thought that's
how things went around here.

790
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:05,998
Everyone hung out with the pros
and did their thing.

791
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,935
- Tour slut at your service.
- No!

792
01:07:10,574 --> 01:07:13,873
I didn't... I really didn't
mean it like that. I...

793
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:19,342
It's just, you know, you're super cute.

794
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:24,284
I'd throw myself under
the wheels of Jimmy's bus...

795
01:07:24,455 --> 01:07:26,980
...to get a chance to be
with a girl like you.

796
01:07:27,157 --> 01:07:30,092
You're sick! You're sick!
That's sick!

797
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:36,328
I know you.

798
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,697
We got on Jimmy Wilson's bus,
and Matt took a big crap on it.

799
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:43,499
I don't know if it was the stroganoff
or what, but I was like...

800
01:07:43,741 --> 01:07:44,799
Stop. Wonderful.

801
01:07:44,975 --> 01:07:49,344
These are my friends by default and not
by choice, and we're leaving right now.

802
01:07:49,613 --> 01:07:51,547
All right. See you.

803
01:07:52,082 --> 01:07:55,176
- Bye, friends.
- Sometimes Eric looks like He-Man.

804
01:07:57,621 --> 01:07:59,486
So, what's up?

805
01:08:01,258 --> 01:08:02,623
Let's go.

806
01:08:06,296 --> 01:08:08,196
Excuse me, sorry.

807
01:08:08,532 --> 01:08:11,057
I got a code brown to
wrestle down to the ground.

808
01:08:11,769 --> 01:08:13,031
Oh, my God!

809
01:08:16,974 --> 01:08:19,135
There she is, boys.

810
01:08:20,878 --> 01:08:23,039
What do we do now, man?

811
01:08:23,213 --> 01:08:25,078
I don't know, dude.

812
01:08:28,652 --> 01:08:30,643
Look at this guy.
Is this guy gonna stop?

813
01:08:32,256 --> 01:08:33,814
Shit!

814
01:08:33,991 --> 01:08:35,322
God, jackass!

815
01:08:44,368 --> 01:08:46,063
Man, those things are awesome.

816
01:08:46,236 --> 01:08:49,228
He's not playing piano anytime soon, man.

817
01:08:58,882 --> 01:09:01,407
Guys, come on. Come on, come on!

818
01:09:12,596 --> 01:09:14,496
Go, go, go, go, go!

819
01:09:19,803 --> 01:09:20,895
Come on!

820
01:09:22,372 --> 01:09:23,737
Kick the thing! Come on!

821
01:10:06,183 --> 01:10:07,411
Hey, you all right?

822
01:10:08,118 --> 01:10:11,554
- They didn't see it.
- But I sure did.

823
01:10:12,089 --> 01:10:17,686
I'm sick and tired of you punks thinking you
can skate wherever the hell you feel like.

824
01:10:18,328 --> 01:10:20,819
Sir, we're at a skate demo.

825
01:10:25,335 --> 01:10:27,064
Smart-ass.

826
01:10:27,938 --> 01:10:30,668
You know, I could have
you guys arrested.

827
01:10:32,876 --> 01:10:34,366
Come here.

828
01:10:35,979 --> 01:10:40,416
But for once, I'm gonna have you skaters
take care of your own mess.

829
01:10:43,453 --> 01:10:46,286
Sweet Lou cleans no man's poop.

830
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:48,855
Have fun, girls.

831
01:10:57,534 --> 01:10:58,831
So to recap...

832
01:10:59,703 --> 01:11:02,831
...we smell like turds, we have no car,
no Jimmy Wilson...

833
01:11:03,407 --> 01:11:05,739
...and I'm broke. Call me stupid.

834
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:07,240
- Hey, stupid.
- What?

835
01:11:07,477 --> 01:11:08,842
Don't worry about it, man.

836
01:11:09,012 --> 01:11:11,981
This is the part where
Eric Rivers jumps up...

837
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:16,347
...and angels descend from heaven,
sustaining one long note...

838
01:11:16,853 --> 01:11:20,050
...and he says, "Team meeting."
- Does he have a plan? I bet he does.

839
01:11:20,424 --> 01:11:23,291
He has a plan, so we all run
over there, and he goes:

840
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,927
"This is our last shot."

841
01:11:31,768 --> 01:11:33,099
It's over.

842
01:11:38,809 --> 01:11:41,607
What? Wait, he's giving up?

843
01:11:43,213 --> 01:11:45,909
What the hell else you want me to do?

844
01:11:47,017 --> 01:11:50,680
I'm fricking one step away
from being somebody's stalker.

845
01:11:51,688 --> 01:11:55,852
You guys should have just stayed home,
not listened to a word I said.

846
01:11:56,093 --> 01:11:57,287
My fault.

847
01:11:59,129 --> 01:12:03,691
Let's get one thing straight here.
I followed you here because you got balls.

848
01:12:05,602 --> 01:12:08,833
And because Sandy's dad
was about to rip mine off, but...

849
01:12:09,006 --> 01:12:11,702
Seriously. If it wasn't for you,
we'd still be at home.

850
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:14,139
- I'd still be on your couch.
- Don't push me!

851
01:12:14,378 --> 01:12:18,314
Hey, man, I'm trying to tell you
we're having fun, bro.

852
01:12:18,815 --> 01:12:22,251
For real, man. We're on an adventure.

853
01:12:24,254 --> 01:12:28,247
No. No, we're on a train wreck.
This is a revolving nightmare.

854
01:12:28,425 --> 01:12:30,825
No, a revolving nightmare
is us still in Chicago...

855
01:12:30,994 --> 01:12:33,485
...not trying to do anything
with our lives.

856
01:12:33,664 --> 01:12:39,261
Let me tell you something. The $ 736.18
I've spent since I've been here...

857
01:12:39,436 --> 01:12:41,063
...worth it.

858
01:12:41,271 --> 01:12:45,469
- You have that down to an exact...?
- Yes, worth it. Every penny.

859
01:12:46,043 --> 01:12:47,908
Look at us, man.

860
01:12:48,145 --> 01:12:50,613
We're not losers anymore, man.
We're a team.

861
01:12:52,516 --> 01:12:54,882
We're Super Duper.

862
01:12:57,688 --> 01:12:59,656
Fucking assholes.

863
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:01,919
Come on, don't be sad.

864
01:13:04,995 --> 01:13:06,758
- Hey!
- Hey, what's going on?

865
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:10,696
You might want to stand
back about 40 feet.

866
01:13:11,601 --> 01:13:13,967
Yeah, look, I'm a little ripe right now.

867
01:13:14,137 --> 01:13:17,402
So listen, are you guys going
up to Santa Monica?

868
01:13:17,574 --> 01:13:19,940
No, we weren't going to.
What's going on there?

869
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:22,977
It's the Pro Jam. If you're pro
or sponsored, you can skate.

870
01:13:23,213 --> 01:13:24,840
Really?

871
01:13:26,249 --> 01:13:28,683
I could try to help you guys out.

872
01:13:29,086 --> 01:13:31,554
Maybe go with you?

873
01:13:31,722 --> 01:13:34,122
All right. That would be great.

874
01:13:34,725 --> 01:13:37,125
Come here, team meeting. Excuse us.

875
01:13:38,128 --> 01:13:39,595
What's up?

876
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:43,160
Give me five seconds. What?

877
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:48,202
In the name of all things holy, please.
You feel this vibe? You feel the pulse?

878
01:13:48,372 --> 01:13:51,739
How we're all sharing one heartbeat,
like a herd of elk?

879
01:13:51,908 --> 01:13:57,471
We finally accumulated something
of a team vibe over there. Do not ruin it.

880
01:13:58,682 --> 01:14:00,206
You don't wanna bring a girl?

881
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:03,842
No, man! Where's the van, dude?
They're all cute, and...

882
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:06,488
...the horns come out. No!
Rules are rules.

883
01:14:06,656 --> 01:14:09,750
But where's the van? Where's our car?
Maybe she has a car.

884
01:14:09,926 --> 01:14:11,894
She's a good girl. Trust her.

885
01:14:12,062 --> 01:14:15,259
- She's sexy.
- Guys. I'm right here. I can hear you.

886
01:14:15,799 --> 01:14:16,857
Hi.

887
01:14:17,033 --> 01:14:20,935
It's cool. I mean, whatever.
Just do your thing.

888
01:14:21,104 --> 01:14:24,699
Seriously, I don't want to interrupt
your team vibe.

889
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:27,241
But you're not. That's the thing.

890
01:14:27,411 --> 01:14:31,074
No, I get it. I totally... I get it.
It's no big deal.

891
01:14:31,248 --> 01:14:33,216
I hope I see you guys at the beach.

892
01:14:34,251 --> 01:14:35,240
See you.

893
01:14:35,419 --> 01:14:37,250
Jamie, it's nothing personal.

894
01:14:37,621 --> 01:14:39,953
- It's just rules.
- You are such a dumb-ass.

895
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:44,627
I'm so hungry, one of my ribs
is poking through the skin.

896
01:14:44,928 --> 01:14:48,295
I would literally kill
for a night in a real bed.

897
01:14:53,069 --> 01:14:57,165
Look who's got a nice, comfy SUV?

898
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,706
A nice "suv."

899
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:02,540
What do we do now, Matt?

900
01:15:04,247 --> 01:15:06,681
It's time to meet the clowns, man.

901
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:18,651
Guys, what are we doing
in a clown college?

902
01:15:31,575 --> 01:15:32,940
Matty!

903
01:15:37,914 --> 01:15:41,645
- Hey, Mom.
- We missed the hell out of you!

904
01:15:42,219 --> 01:15:44,710
Those are Matt's parents?

905
01:15:44,955 --> 01:15:47,253
They really are clowns.

906
01:15:48,024 --> 01:15:49,924
You reek!

907
01:15:50,827 --> 01:15:52,294
Hey, Dad.

908
01:15:54,431 --> 01:15:55,955
Matt?

909
01:15:56,466 --> 01:15:59,367
- What's up?
- You smell funky.

910
01:16:00,036 --> 01:16:03,437
Wait, don't tell me. Give me a second.
I'm really good at this.

911
01:16:03,673 --> 01:16:04,970
I'm covered in shit.

912
01:16:08,011 --> 01:16:09,774
Now, why the sudden visit?

913
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,641
Why haven't you called?

914
01:16:13,316 --> 01:16:16,479
I don't know.
I guess I'm still kind of bitter...

915
01:16:16,653 --> 01:16:19,816
...from when you guys abandoned me
my senior year in high school...

916
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:22,185
...and ran off to join a circus.

917
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:24,156
I see.

918
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,360
- I'm sorry.
- No, we're sorry, son.

919
01:16:33,937 --> 01:16:38,499
We're sorry we tried to push
you through clown college.

920
01:16:38,675 --> 01:16:41,041
Sorry about a lot of other things.

921
01:16:41,211 --> 01:16:45,375
There's more to life than a pie
in the face for you, and we accept that.

922
01:16:48,985 --> 01:16:53,854
I've been so pissed off at you for running
off and getting into this whole clown thing.

923
01:16:55,725 --> 01:16:58,057
But I think I get it now.

924
01:16:59,396 --> 01:17:02,160
You guys are just trying
to make yourselves happy.

925
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:07,698
There are things in life
that just aren't that easy.

926
01:17:07,871 --> 01:17:11,363
But the important thing is,
you're out there trying.

927
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:13,566
You're a man now.

928
01:17:14,778 --> 01:17:16,109
We're proud of you.

929
01:17:16,546 --> 01:17:18,537
I love you, Dad.

930
01:17:19,482 --> 01:17:21,541
I got him!

931
01:17:27,123 --> 01:17:28,784
What's up?

932
01:17:31,061 --> 01:17:32,619
Bang.

933
01:17:35,865 --> 01:17:38,459
I can't believe you're Matt's sister.

934
01:17:39,803 --> 01:17:41,532
Me either.

935
01:17:43,206 --> 01:17:45,333
So you want to...?

936
01:17:49,379 --> 01:17:51,313
"You want to...?"

937
01:17:56,386 --> 01:18:00,379
Do you wanna learn how to throw a pie?

938
01:18:02,726 --> 01:18:05,524
Bet you never turn down pie.

939
01:18:40,163 --> 01:18:42,131
Oh, no.

940
01:18:45,835 --> 01:18:47,462
Nice.

941
01:18:48,138 --> 01:18:50,538
Matt, you look different.

942
01:18:50,707 --> 01:18:54,837
Looking good, stud. I see you've taken
a lesson from the Sweet Lou.

943
01:18:55,545 --> 01:18:57,604
Thought I'd clean up a little bit.

944
01:18:57,781 --> 01:19:02,241
Welcome to the human race, my friend.
I think you'll like it here.

945
01:19:08,024 --> 01:19:12,120
Thank you, guys,
for letting us crash here...

946
01:19:12,295 --> 01:19:14,559
...and eat your food...

947
01:19:14,731 --> 01:19:17,791
...and the clothes
and letting us take a shower.

948
01:19:18,501 --> 01:19:20,162
And thanks for the truck.

949
01:19:21,404 --> 01:19:23,372
We're always here for you, son.

950
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:28,173
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, son.

951
01:19:30,413 --> 01:19:33,211
- Okay.
- I love you, Mom.

952
01:19:39,489 --> 01:19:40,956
Matt!

953
01:19:55,538 --> 01:19:57,028
Mom.

954
01:19:59,275 --> 01:20:01,641
I'm not gonna be needing these.

955
01:20:02,345 --> 01:20:05,143
You can't blame a mom for trying.

956
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,070
Bye!

957
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,995
Great.

958
01:21:33,002 --> 01:21:34,833
Yo, check it out.

959
01:21:36,272 --> 01:21:38,172
- Oh, no you didn't.
- Hell, no.

960
01:21:38,341 --> 01:21:41,333
Get out of my business
before we bust a cap in your ass, fool.

961
01:21:41,511 --> 01:21:44,503
Yo, this is a professional
skateboarding event, dog.

962
01:21:44,848 --> 01:21:47,840
- It don't include you.
- You wanna step, bee-yatch?

963
01:21:48,284 --> 01:21:50,013
Let me tell you how we do it.

964
01:21:55,491 --> 01:21:58,221
- Keep it rolling, crackers.
- Keep going.

965
01:21:58,394 --> 01:22:00,726
- Super Duper bitches!
- Keep walking!

966
01:22:26,656 --> 01:22:28,419
- All right, get me a kid.
- Okay.

967
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:32,252
- Wait, what?
- Just get me a kid.

968
01:22:38,034 --> 01:22:40,901
Hey. Eric Rivers.

969
01:22:41,804 --> 01:22:46,503
Yeah, and this is little Timmy
from Create-A-Wish Foundation.

970
01:22:46,776 --> 01:22:50,507
He wants to see us skate
before his head explodes.

971
01:22:51,114 --> 01:22:53,241
I'm not a little kid!

972
01:22:55,451 --> 01:22:59,444
Come on, guys. You know you can't
skate unless you're preregistered.

973
01:22:59,822 --> 01:23:01,187
Which...

974
01:23:01,758 --> 01:23:03,350
...you are.

975
01:23:06,062 --> 01:23:07,552
Here you go.

976
01:23:08,564 --> 01:23:10,088
It worked?

977
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,494
Dude, that's her!

978
01:24:35,485 --> 01:24:36,884
You go, girl!

979
01:24:39,022 --> 01:24:40,148
She's bad!

980
01:24:40,323 --> 01:24:43,724
Let's hear it for the Dream Team!
Give it up!

981
01:24:53,436 --> 01:24:55,836
So I put you and your friends on the list.

982
01:24:56,005 --> 01:24:57,905
Figured if you could get out here...

983
01:24:58,608 --> 01:25:01,099
...you shouldn't be stopped
by paperwork.

984
01:25:02,278 --> 01:25:04,337
I think I love you.

985
01:25:06,682 --> 01:25:09,708
You don't have a problem
with chick skaters?

986
01:25:09,886 --> 01:25:12,116
No. Why? Should I?

987
01:25:13,322 --> 01:25:14,812
You shouldn't.

988
01:25:19,128 --> 01:25:22,996
I'm sorry about everything. About...

989
01:25:23,766 --> 01:25:25,893
I was so caught up in my own trip...

990
01:25:26,069 --> 01:25:30,529
...I totally didn't see you
for who you were.

991
01:25:33,509 --> 01:25:35,374
Who am I to you?

992
01:25:39,215 --> 01:25:40,773
I don't know.

993
01:25:41,584 --> 01:25:43,211
But...

994
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:47,147
...I really want to find out.

995
01:25:50,326 --> 01:25:52,089
Find out.

996
01:25:52,261 --> 01:25:53,694
Yeah?

997
01:26:17,086 --> 01:26:18,883
We're up next.

998
01:26:24,227 --> 01:26:25,319
This is it.

999
01:26:25,928 --> 01:26:29,762
No matter what happens,
I'm so glad that you guys stuck with me.

1000
01:26:29,999 --> 01:26:33,730
- I'm glad we did this together.
- We've had a ride, all right.

1001
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:36,038
Bro, you got me out of your garage...

1002
01:26:36,205 --> 01:26:39,402
...talking to the clowns,
chicks are starting to look at me.

1003
01:26:39,575 --> 01:26:42,135
That's because you don't smell
like anus anymore.

1004
01:26:44,814 --> 01:26:48,306
I'm pissed that I'm broke,
but it was worth the money to be here.

1005
01:26:48,484 --> 01:26:50,975
Even if we choke out there.

1006
01:26:54,624 --> 01:26:56,148
I love you, Eric.

1007
01:26:58,995 --> 01:27:00,326
Why did you do that?

1008
01:27:00,496 --> 01:27:02,828
I'm psyching you up, dude!

1009
01:27:02,999 --> 01:27:06,093
Could you psych me up
a little softer next time?

1010
01:27:06,269 --> 01:27:11,036
Sweet Lou. My sister wanted
me to give you this. It's her nose.

1011
01:27:21,817 --> 01:27:23,409
All right, boys. Get on it.

1012
01:27:23,586 --> 01:27:26,646
Santa Monica' it is time to get busy...

1013
01:27:26,856 --> 01:27:30,587
...because next up, we have four cats
that you might not have heard of.

1014
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:35,959
They are Eric Rivers, Dustin Knight,
Matt Jensen and Sweet Lou Singer.

1015
01:27:36,132 --> 01:27:40,501
If you haven't heard of these kids,
guess what. We are all in the same boat.

1016
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:43,195
But they are here,
they're ready to get busy.

1017
01:27:43,372 --> 01:27:48,605
They're representing Super Duper
Skateboards. Let's take it to the street.

1018
01:29:24,674 --> 01:29:26,471
Oh, God. What's up?

1019
01:29:26,642 --> 01:29:29,042
Just keeping an eye out
for something special.

1020
01:29:29,211 --> 01:29:31,475
- See something you like?
- Maybe.

1021
01:29:31,647 --> 01:29:33,911
Oh, my God!

1022
01:29:50,466 --> 01:29:52,900
What's up, dog?
Didn't I tell you to break out, fool?

1023
01:29:53,069 --> 01:29:55,765
I just don't like you, fool. Bounce.

1024
01:29:57,773 --> 01:29:58,933
You know what?

1025
01:29:59,108 --> 01:30:00,700
- What?
- You and me.

1026
01:30:00,876 --> 01:30:03,037
- Oh, hells yeah!
- Get him, dog!

1027
01:30:03,212 --> 01:30:05,840
He's gonna hand you your ass, punk.

1028
01:30:06,015 --> 01:30:08,040
You gonna take that side? All right.

1029
01:34:20,402 --> 01:34:22,893
- Eric!
- Go, Eric!

1030
01:35:52,728 --> 01:35:55,219
I've never seen anything like that.

1031
01:35:55,397 --> 01:35:58,696
Seriously, your batwing,
dude, that was...

1032
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:05,331
Yo, dog, I always be up in your business,
but, you know...

1033
01:36:06,175 --> 01:36:08,700
That was tight, dude! You crazy, dog!

1034
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:12,639
- Hey, sorry about what I said.
- That's all right.

1035
01:36:12,915 --> 01:36:14,712
Hey, 40s on me, everybody!

1036
01:36:14,883 --> 01:36:18,080
Yo, but we're still taking your girl.

1037
01:36:18,787 --> 01:36:22,245
- That's not gonna happen.
- Take her, dude.

1038
01:36:22,424 --> 01:36:25,052
All right, man. Hey, peace.

1039
01:36:25,527 --> 01:36:27,154
- Peace out.
- See you guys.

1040
01:36:28,230 --> 01:36:29,891
Seriously...

1041
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:32,759
...that was awesome!
- Thank you.

1042
01:36:32,935 --> 01:36:35,335
I've never seen skating like that. Hey!

1043
01:36:35,504 --> 01:36:37,995
- That counts for something.
- Hell, yeah, it does.

1044
01:36:38,173 --> 01:36:41,199
By the way, guys,
I think I'm done playing the field.

1045
01:36:41,376 --> 01:36:44,436
- Yeah, right.
- No, Sweet Lou's in love.

1046
01:36:44,613 --> 01:36:47,047
It's crazy, I know. They're clowns.

1047
01:36:47,449 --> 01:36:50,885
You were so good! I didn't know
you could skateboard like that.

1048
01:36:51,053 --> 01:36:53,817
You're all really great.

1049
01:36:54,256 --> 01:36:56,588
Hey, I don't think Jimmy saw us.

1050
01:36:57,626 --> 01:36:59,253
Sorry, man.

1051
01:37:06,301 --> 01:37:09,964
I gotta get back to my dad's shop
and mix some paint.

1052
01:37:10,472 --> 01:37:12,167
Have you talked to Jamie lately?

1053
01:37:12,341 --> 01:37:16,072
Yeah, I got ahold of her last weekend.
She was up in Toronto somewhere.

1054
01:37:16,245 --> 01:37:20,341
It's so freaking hard to track her down
when she's here, there and everywhere.

1055
01:37:22,251 --> 01:37:24,412
Dude, Sweet Lou called me yesterday.

1056
01:37:24,586 --> 01:37:26,850
No way! How is he liking the circus?

1057
01:37:27,022 --> 01:37:29,081
He's loving the circus.

1058
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,821
I can't believe that dude's
in the circus with my sister.

1059
01:37:32,995 --> 01:37:35,987
He's pulling her finger as we speak.

1060
01:37:37,032 --> 01:37:39,796
Seriously, you can't say
this wasn't a good summer.

1061
01:37:39,968 --> 01:37:43,597
Dude, I mean, we tried, and that's
more than most people can say.

1062
01:37:45,407 --> 01:37:47,466
No way!

1063
01:37:58,353 --> 01:38:01,117
Hey, guys. We've been looking
everywhere for you.

1064
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:03,690
I brought someone
who wants to meet you.

1065
01:38:03,892 --> 01:38:06,417
So I saw this tape on my bus...

1066
01:38:06,595 --> 01:38:08,825
...and Jamie sat me down
and made me watch it.

1067
01:38:08,997 --> 01:38:10,988
You pulled some sick stuff
in Santa Monica.

1068
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:14,594
He found a tape on the bus.
What do you know?

1069
01:38:15,037 --> 01:38:16,937
Would you like to join me on tour?

1070
01:38:18,507 --> 01:38:20,065
What?

1071
01:38:20,542 --> 01:38:22,373
Yes, we will. Yeah.

1072
01:38:22,978 --> 01:38:25,845
- Let's go.
- Let's do it, man!

1073
01:38:27,049 --> 01:38:28,607
So...

1074
01:38:31,353 --> 01:38:34,516
- What's up?
- Find out.

1075
01:38:49,438 --> 01:38:53,670
Rivers, seriously, please,
while we're young.

1076
01:38:59,248 --> 01:39:03,082
I know your board is all cracked up,
but you've gotta start spending money.

1077
01:39:03,252 --> 01:39:04,719
Because money-spending is good.

1078
01:39:05,153 --> 01:39:07,883
- Eric!
- Good to see you, bro.

1079
01:39:08,056 --> 01:39:09,284
- Big love.
- You too.

1080
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:11,585
I'm gonna need a bunch of my decks.

1081
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:13,589
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Cool.

1082
01:39:13,762 --> 01:39:16,253
Dude, it's Eric Rivers, here in person.

1083
01:39:20,802 --> 01:39:22,064
- "Rivers."
- Cool, dude.

1084
01:39:22,237 --> 01:39:24,933
I saw your demo down in Springfield.
You're awesome.

1085
01:39:25,107 --> 01:39:28,770
- Cool, thanks. You got a pen, real quick?
- Yeah.

1086
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:36,209
Cool.

1087
01:39:36,385 --> 01:39:39,616
Your board is pretty thrashed.
There you go. Thanks, Greg.

1088
01:40:00,943 --> 01:40:02,570
We're the dopest shit in the movie.

1089
01:40:02,878 --> 01:40:04,140
Ladies.

1090
01:40:05,647 --> 01:40:08,377
I really...
All right, real quick.

1091
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:09,881
See you in the bean suit.

1092
01:40:10,052 --> 01:40:12,043
Dude, I'm dropping pebbles.

1093
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:15,417
Here we go. And action!

1094
01:40:21,096 --> 01:40:22,563
Cut!

1095
01:40:22,731 --> 01:40:24,358
- Can I make a suggestion?
- Yeah.

1096
01:40:24,533 --> 01:40:26,728
Why don't you direct your way
to the 40s.

1097
01:40:34,376 --> 01:40:35,604
We gotta redo that.

1098
01:40:51,526 --> 01:40:53,084
How's Mountain Gleebin
and Globin?

1099
01:40:53,261 --> 01:40:57,664
Casey La Scala
Just for a dollar

1100
01:40:59,935 --> 01:41:01,493
How big you want me to go?

1101
01:41:02,137 --> 01:41:03,434
Cut.

1102
01:41:03,605 --> 01:41:07,769
I didn't recognize you in the bright lights.

1103
01:41:11,079 --> 01:41:12,341
Oh, crikey.

1104
01:41:22,024 --> 01:41:23,548
She sure was a slippery one.

1105
01:41:27,195 --> 01:41:28,719
Sweet Lou!

1106
01:42:46,108 --> 01:42:48,770
You think we're gonna have
a sequel, or what?

1107
01:42:48,944 --> 01:42:52,436
I heard you're not in it,
so I don't know, I can't talk about it.

1108
01:44:39,654 --> 01:44:41,417
Peace out!
