00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,756
- It's a real nice sign. How much?
- I have to see ID.

4
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:12,550
- I left it at home. How much?
- Not unless you show me ID.

5
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,342
- Stop being a shit. Keep the change, man.
- I'm not keeping it. I have to see ID.

6
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:21,391
I don't have any. I been coming here
three months, Frank never carded me.

7
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:25,188
Frank lost his job because
he didn't get proper ID when he sold beer.

8
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:29,897
Why you being an asshole? Take the
money and let me get the fuck out of here.

9
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:33,235
- It's the law and the policy...
- I don't give a fuck about you,

10
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:35,824
and I don't give a fuck about your laws.

11
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:40,166
- Take the goddamn money, all right?
- Let go of the beer.

12
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:43,577
- Don't be an asshole.
- Let go of the beer.

- Dick.
- Shithead.

14
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:49,425
Dick.

15
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,273
Don't mention it.

16
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:11,903
I saw you this morning.

17
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:14,528
Yeah?

18
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,867
Got any dope?

19
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:19,035
No.

20
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:26,789
Get in. I know where to get some.

21
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:36,512
Where are we going?

22
00:06:39,602 --> 00:06:41,642
Feck's.

23
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,959
Radical.

24
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:07,776
He did something bad to her, I know it.

25
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,902
We'll find her.
Where is that brother of yours?

26
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,318
Where's my Missy?

27
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,450
- I killed her.
- No!

28
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:18,819
I drowned her.

29
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:22,039
- <i>(man)</i> A man's trying to sleep.
- Shh, Kim, please.

30
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,617
- You little punk.
- <i>(man)</i> I said I'm trying to sleep up here!

31
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:28,374
Please, Kim.
We'll make him buy you a new one.

32
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:32,124
It wouldn't be the same,
I want my Missy back.

33
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:34,667
Why are you so mean?

34
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:38,220
- Where are you going?
- <i>(man)</i> Somebody is trying to sleep.

35
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,509
Stick your head up your ass if you
want quiet. Tim, you get back here.

36
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:45,686

Remember my age.

39
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:59,483
Stupid enough you pull a stunt like that,
but then to brag about it...

40

- <i>(mother)</i> Open this door.

- None of your business.

44

What about your other doll, pretty Tracy?

46

- No.
- I'll make the turdface buy you a new one.

47
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:33,693
I don't want the turdface to buy me
a new one. I want you to beat him up.

48
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,697
Oh, honey... Tim?

49
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,363
- <i>(mother)</i> Tim.
- <i>(man)</i> Matt!

50
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:45,073
- Going to Feck's, huh?
- What do you know about Feck?

51
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,333
<i>(Matt)</i> Beat it, fart.

52
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:51,923
Let me go with you guys.
Could show you a dead body.

53
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,588
What? You got a girlfriend now?

54
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,587
I'm not kidding. Look, I'm dying for a joint.

55
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,763
Aww!

56
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:18,697
You get back in this house
right this instant. Tim. Tim!

57
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:25,916
What's this? Feck doesn't charge.

58
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:31,203
I charge. What? You think this car
runs on God's own methane?

59
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:37,548
- I don't know.
- Where were you last night, anyhow?

60
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,467
John was getting all out of control.

61
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:44,467
- I'll bet. Who else was there?
- Jamie.

62
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,807
Oh, Jamie. I didn't miss anything.

63
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,605
Now, Clarissa, maybe.

64
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:55,864
Keep your hands off Clarissa, dude.

65
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,239
Shit, what am I worried about?

66
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,629
<i>(saxophone played badly)</i>

67
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:23,304
Feck.

68
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:27,848
<i>(one long note on saxophone)</i>

69
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:31,232
What? Are you dying in there?

70
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:40,657
Feck.

71
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:46,831
Feck.

72
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,389
Feck.

73
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:18,817
- Cheque's in the mail.
- It's me, Feck, Layne. Don't shoot, OK?

74
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,239
I could blow your brains out.

75
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:23,658
- I know, Feck.
- I shot a girl once.

76
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:27,703
I know. You keep telling me that.
You want to lower that barrel some?

77
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,290
I am your friend.

78
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:34,417
Yeah, you say so, huh?

79
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:36,507
- You're my friend?
- Yeah.

80
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:39,208
Yeah, maybe so.

81
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:41,967
- Don't you try anything.
- OK.

82
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:47,765
Why don't you and Matt come in and, uh...

83
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:50,304
- see Ellie?
- Oh!

84
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:55,019
I'd love to, Feck, you know?
But we're kind of, we're late for school...

85
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,193
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

86
00:12:58,574 --> 00:13:02,903
Well? How much you want, then?

87
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:06,488
Aw, come on. No, I came by to see
how you're doing, good old Feck.

88
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,616
Yeah, good old Feck.

89
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:10,957
Yeah. How much you want?

90
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:13,459
Just a couple of joints.

91
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:17,422
Wait here.

92
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,685
- You're my friend.
- Of course.

93
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:35,769
She had it coming, man.

94
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:41,822
Yeah, I know, Feck. You know,
women are evil. You had to kill her.

95
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:44,823
- Yeah. They're still after me, you know.
- Yeah.

96
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:47,411
- All right. See you.
- All right, see you.

97
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,459
Thanks for the weed.

98
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:56,171
Friends.

99
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,220
You're my friend.

100
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:08,764
Ellie, huh? The gun - did he have the gun?

101
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:10,604
Right.

102
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,107
You're my friend.

103
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:24,318
- Gimme a cigarette, man.
- You fucking gave up cigarettes.

104
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:27,289
- I gave up yesterday, not today.
- I gave up lending.

105
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:30,369
Learn some self-control,
you're interrupting. Go on.

106
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:34,713
I don't know. I just figured
we could dump this place, you know?

107
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,291
Go up there, and if we like it,
we stay, don't come back.

108
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:42,045
- Where did you get Portland?
- Well, nobody knows us up there.

109
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,885
- People know us here?
- I know you, babe.

110
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,843
That's really annoying.

111
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:50,097
So, what, man?
We could be lumberjacks or something?

112
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,646
- There's other things to do.
- Like what?

113
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:57,725
- Like get stoned.
- It almost sounds like a plan.

114
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,066
Except we're all broke,
and I'm the only one with a car.

115
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,494
We could just take all our parents' money,
take off, discover America,

116
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:09,120
and make like we're <i>Easy Rider</i> plus five.

117
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:13,618
I gotta go. Burkewaite's gonna
have a spaz attack if I'm late.

118
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:16,921
She's in love with his middle-aged ass.

119
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,670
He's not middle-aged, asshole. Hi, John.

120
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:21,925
<i>(Layne)</i> Didn't think you'd make it.

121
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,177
Where's Jamie?

122
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:27,758
- I killed her.
- She'll be in trouble if she keeps ditching.

123
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,894
- You what?
- I killed her.

124
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:33,061
You're strange, John.

125
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,903
What did you do, man? Sit on her?

126
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:47,446
They don't believe me.

127
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:52,409
<i>(Layne)</i> Crazy fucking story like that,
why should anyone believe you?

If you brought us all the way
out here for nothing...

129
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:58,169
Come on.

130
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,380
<i>(Layne)</i> It's a joke. What BS.

131
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,019
You crazy motherfucker, John.

132
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:23,074
- Do you see this?
- Yeah, I see it.

133
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:25,952
You crazy motherfucker.

134
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:31,575
Why did you kill her?

135
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,081
She was talking shit.

136
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:40,589
You could fry for this, you know.

137
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:42,758
Yeah.

138
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:49,180
This is unreal, completely unreal.

139
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:54,270
Matt.

140
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,317
- What's with you?
- We better go, huh?

141
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:09,820
John.

142
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:26,338
It's like some fucking movie, you know?

143
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:30,008
Friends since second grade,
fucking like this.

144
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:34,604
And then one of us gets himself
in potentially big trouble,

145
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:40,153
and now we've gotta deal with it. We've
gotta test our loyalty against all odds.

146
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:43,114
It's kind of exciting.

147
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,286
I feel like Chuck Norris, you know?

148
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:55,201
<i>(teacher)</i> So, what was accomplished?

149
00:17:55,337 --> 00:17:58,338
I mean, that's the normal question.

150
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:03,211
All the hippies are executives now,
and everybody's sold out.

151
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:07,343
Well, let me tell you something, Tom.
Save it, Kevin.

152
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:09,597
Fundamental changes were made,

153
00:18:09,727 --> 00:18:13,309
changes so basic
that we now take 'em for granted.

154
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:16,559
The civil rights movement,
later the Women's Movement.

155
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:20,524
I mean, like it or not, ladies,
you're now expected to have careers,

156
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:24,273
then maybe later
the husbands and the babies.

157
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:26,235
And Vietnam.

158
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:30,032
We stopped a war, man.

159
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:32,655
We took to the streets
and made a difference.

160
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:36,077
We turned public sentiment around,

161
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:40,755
and we made people see the truth. Not
that we always thought good thoughts.

162
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:44,667
Cops around you cracking skulls,
you got a picket sign in your hand,

163
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,556
you're not thinking about
stopping the war now,

164
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:52,391
you're thinking about
knocking a few pigs on their asses.

165
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,889
But as crazy as it all seemed, though,

166
00:18:56,024 --> 00:19:00,271
there was a meaning in the madness,
a clear and a real purpose.

167
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:05,777
- But don't you think violence is wrong?
- Fuck off, Kevin. Wasting pigs is radical.

168
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:07,948
<i>(bell)</i>

169
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:13,449
You missed my point.

170
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:18,420
- Come on, let's go grab a smoke.
- You go on, I'll be there in a minute.

171
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:20,586
You're hooked.

172
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:35,856
- Yes.
- Bullshit.

173
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:38,602
Would I lie?

174
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:41,651
- You really...
- <i>(girl)</i> Really what?

175
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,020
- No way.
- Look, dude.

176
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:47,655
I saw it right there in front of me.
I poked at it with a stick.

177
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:50,073
- No chance.
- Poked at what?

178
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:53,573
- <i>(boy)</i> By the river, huh?
- <i>(Layne)</i> Tony.

179
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:57,327
We'll take you there,
and we'll show you. Right, Matt?

180
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,834
- Count me out, OK?
- Count you out of what?

181
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,085
What's by the river,
and what are you guys talking about?

182
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:07,595
- Layne's saying Samson killed Jamie.
- No way.

183
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,549
And you believe them?

184
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:12,221
A bunch of us are going
out there to check it out.

185
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:14,428
I don't know. It's probably some joke.

186
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:18,264
Yeah, they're just trying to lure
you up there so they can rape you.

187
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,187
- You think so?
- <i>(laughter)</i>

188
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:39,999
- No free food, Layne.
- Come on, Mike. I just came by to say hi.

189
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:41,673
- Hi.
- Hi.

190
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,838
Oh, no.

191
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:53,968
- You can't use my truck, Layne.
- Come on, Mike. It's important.

192
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,355
What's all this?

193
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:09,864
We're the newly appointed truant patrol.

194
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:15,071
Looking to capture and kill ten-year-old
runaway homeboys. Like you.

195
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:19,419
- Hear you're all gonna go see a dead girl.
- What do you know about a dead girl?

196
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:22,119
Me and John are close. Huh, John?

197
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,461
Yeah.

198
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:30,259
- Thinking of coming with you guys.
- No room. Both you guys, outta here.

199
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,881
John wants us to stay.

200
00:21:33,018 --> 00:21:35,224
Don't you, John?

201
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:40,024
Nice try, Layne. Nice try, but forget it.

202
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,151
I won't let you do this to me again.
I promised myself.

203
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:45,947
- N-o spells nuh-uh.
- Mike.

204
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:49,691
No. No one drives that truck but me.

205
00:21:49,826 --> 00:21:53,871
- Well, then, you drive it, then.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

206
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:57,117
My supervisor's gonna kill me
if he sees me talking to you.

207
00:21:57,251 --> 00:22:00,335
Now you want me to just walk out,
leave work, lose my job?

208
00:22:10,724 --> 00:22:13,559
- I ain't got all day, you know.
- I know, Mike.

209
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:16,093
Some of us have to work, Layne.

210
00:22:16,229 --> 00:22:21,354
- <i>(girl)</i> Is that it over there?
- <i>(girl #2)</i> That's just a log, man.

211
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:24,900
What, that?

212
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,066
<i>(Tony)</i> It's a dummy. This is a joke.

213
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,699
We all came out here
for some stupid joke.

214
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:35,328
Oh, my God.

215
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:40,667
Oh, my God.

216
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:32,297
You're in trouble, dude.

217
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:34,223
No, man.

218
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,055
Nobody has to find out.

219
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:39,305
OK, listen up.

220
00:23:40,774 --> 00:23:43,644
We've got a lot of people here.

221
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:48,355
We could bury her so she's never found.

222
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:56,329
Is anybody gonna help me?

223
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:03,577
Where are you going, Mike?
Get back here.

224
00:24:03,714 --> 00:24:09,088
- I gotta get back to work, Layne.
- I said get back here, goddammit.

225
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:14,845
Layne, leave me alone.

226
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:18,594
- Let me go.
- We're dealing with a friend's future.

227
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,766
- He killed somebody.
- You're gonna bring her back?

228
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,651
He brings us out here
like it's some fucking show.

229
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:27,066
We're here to deal with it.
Give me your keys.

230
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:29,486
No, dammit!

231
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:32,072
- You son of a bitch.
- Layne.

232
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:38,957
- Leave him alone, Layne.
- What the fuck are you doing?

233
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:42,868
He doesn't have to stay
if he doesn't want to.

234
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:56,057
So me and John are gonna have
to do this all by ourselves, huh?

235
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:02,895
What the fuck are you doing?

236
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:05,350
She's heavy. Come on.

237
00:25:06,445 --> 00:25:08,485
Are you coming?

238
00:25:11,116 --> 00:25:15,031
You people are a fucking test, I swear.

239
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:31,008
You nailed it.

240
00:25:36,684 --> 00:25:40,349
- Sure you don't wanna come?
- Yeah, I'm tired.

241
00:25:41,314 --> 00:25:44,481
- Hey, you, stubdick. Come here.
- Suck me.

242
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,732
I'm serious, Tim.

243
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:55,568
Keep your fucking mouth shut, you hear?

244
00:25:55,703 --> 00:26:00,200
- About what?
- You know. Tony told me you know.

245
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,540
Oh, the death.

246
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:05,540
Don't worry, I'm with you.

247
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:09,213
I'll trust you.

248
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:21,644
Why are you two such delinquents?

249
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:24,939
Because of our fucked-up childhood.

250
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,902
- What are you doing?
- Taking my gun.

251
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:32,569
You gave it to me two months ago.

252
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,654
<i>(mimics voice)</i>
I gave it to you two months ago.

253
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:38,871
You pothead fuckbrain!

254
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:44,875
- <i>(mother)</i> I have to work tonight, honey.
- <i>(Kim)</i> Miss work.

255
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:48,006
<i>(mother)</i> Don't smoke in the house.
Jim is sensitive to smoke.

256
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,331
Jim, Jim, Jim.

257
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:53,512
He pays the rent, Matt. He has
a right to his comfort. Where's Tim?

258
00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:57,339
Outside being worthless. Why do you
let him play with that hoodlum?

259
00:26:57,476 --> 00:27:00,346
Why do I let him? What am I gonna do?

260
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:03,812
Why do I let you
smoke dope in the house?

261
00:27:03,941 --> 00:27:08,852
- Where did you get that, anyway?
- Don't worry, it's not yours.

262
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:17,151
- Will you come to Missy's funeral?
- I'll come.

263
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,208
- Hole.
- <i>(Tony)</i> You're losing your touch.

264
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:24,583
It's the circuits inside.
The owners have 'em reconnected,

265
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:29,421
cos they know if I ever learn this machine,
I'll take control of the fucking universe.

266
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,589
So what's gonna happen?

267
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:34,340
I'll put a quarter in this machine
and murder it.

268
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:36,797
No, no, with John and all that.

269
00:27:36,932 --> 00:27:40,882
Nothing's gonna happen. I'll tie up
a few loose ends tonight and...

270
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,558
- nothing's gonna happen.
- That's it?

271
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:47,473
He murders Jamie and we just ignore it?

272
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,362
He had his reasons.

273
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:53,489
She was shooting her mouth off
about his mom.

274
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:57,661
- His mother's dead.
- Yeah. See?

275
00:27:57,787 --> 00:28:01,488
He's got a couple loose springs
when it comes to his dead mother.

276
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:04,459
But he's bragging.
It's like he wants to get caught.

277
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:09,129
He's not gonna get caught, because
no one's gonna tell. Isn't that right, Tony?

278
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:11,297
- I wouldn't nark.
- Don't you think...

279
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:16,467
I think we should just quit talking about it,
cos some potential fink could be listening.

280
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:19,634
- That's what I think, right, Tony?
- Sure thing, man.

281
00:28:19,768 --> 00:28:22,093
OK. Clarissa.

282
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:27,567
Wouldn't want John hearing you
shoot your mouth off about it, right?

283
00:28:31,155 --> 00:28:35,367
- Bullshit. Layne's full of bullshit.
- There's the phone there.

284
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:39,906
He thinks he controls us. Thinks because
he says something, we have to do it.

285
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,411
- We usually do.
- Well, this isn't right.

286
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:45,115
I don't care if it was John, or who it was.

287
00:28:45,253 --> 00:28:46,877
There's the phone.

288
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:50,872
What makes John more important than
Jamie? Wasn't Jamie our friend too?

289
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:54,544
- I've known her since kindergarten.
- Here, here's a quarter.

290
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,219
He's dangerous. It could have been you or
me dead now. He probably raped her, too.

291
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:02,677
Here.

292
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:06,387
- Who do I call, anyway?
- The police, I guess.

293
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:09,229
- I don't know the number.
- Call the operator.

294
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:12,148
- You do it.
- I don't know what to say.

295
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,198
Here, I'll dial and you talk.

296
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:24,122
Damn him, anyway.

297
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:28,796
<i>(man) Everybody that's been exposed</i>
<i>to the infection stays here. You too.</i>

298
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:32,172
- <i>(man #2) Me? Well, what do you mean?</i>
- <i>You're quarantined.</i>

299
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:35,919
<i>(man #2) Why, that's ridiculous.</i>
<i>I won't stand for it.</i>

300
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,387
<i>It's meningitis.</i>
<i>Just a kid's disease, isn't it?</i>

301
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,556
<i>(man) Hardly. It hits all ages.</i>

302
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:47,729
Matt.

303
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:02,415
I can't get the damn thing
to stand up straight.

304
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,579
Don't cuss.

305
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:17,669
<i>(car horn)</i>

306
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:20,047
Shit, that's Layne.

307
00:30:20,183 --> 00:30:22,638
- Tell him I'm not here, OK?
- OK.

308
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,195
- He's not here.
- Yeah? Where'd he go?

309
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:41,862
- To buy an egg. Goodbye.
- Hold on there, little lady.

310
00:30:41,998 --> 00:30:45,082
- I said he's not here.
- I believe you. Can I use your phone?

311
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,700
- No.
- Your mommy and daddy home?

312
00:30:47,837 --> 00:30:51,537
Mommy's at work, Jim's at a bar.
I don't have a daddy.

313
00:30:51,674 --> 00:30:53,299
Oh.

314
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,895
Thank you, Samson.
Will you read to me later?

315
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:07,481
What tonight?

316
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:12,186
- <i>Cat in the Hat.</i> No, <i>Green Eggs and Ham.</i>
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

317
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,360
Sure thing, Aunto.

318
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:21,661
Yeah?

319
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,405
Fixing Aunto's dinner.

320
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,618
Yeah.

321
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,163
No.

322
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,297
No, no. I have to read to her later.

323
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:37,505
Jesus, Layne, don't worry about it.
It ain't that important.

324
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:39,677
Ain't important?

325
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,720
They're gonna nail you, dude.

326
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:51,395
I've known you for too fucking long
to let something like that happen to you.

327
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:57,731
Fuck you, then. I'll do it myself.
And I'll be expecting a sixer for this.

328
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:03,778
What I do for my fucking friends.

329
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,538
Good work.

00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:23,265
Hello?

333
00:32:24,227 --> 00:32:27,311
Just a sec. It's Clarissa.

334
00:32:31,025 --> 00:32:33,481
- Do I tell her you're buying an egg?
- No.

335
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:37,194
- Is it your girlfriend?
- Get out.

336
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:38,901
Hello? Clarissa?

337
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:41,785
That's right. Just called to see what's up.

338
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:45,861
Nothing much.
I was just helping my sister with, uh...

339
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:48,870
- <i>With what?</i>
- Nothing.

340
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:53,297
I didn't see you at the arcade today.
Figured you had something going on.

341
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,424
Yeah.

342
00:32:57,762 --> 00:33:01,261
You probably want to get back
to whatever it is you're doing.

343
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,890
- <i>No, I can talk.</i>
- No, no, you're busy.

344
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:11,306
I was just sitting around,
figured I'd call you.

345
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:16,060
You know how it is. Nothing important.

346
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:21,322
- I'll see you tomorrow, Matt.
- <i>Yeah, I'll see you, Clarissa.</i>

347
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,553
I'll be there in a second, OK?
You go in now, all right?

348
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:50,664
<i>(splash)</i>

349
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:23,032
You'd think I'd at least rate a Michelob.

350
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,119
- Don't be an ingrate.
- You're calling me an ingrate?

351
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,081
I never asked you to do it, Layne.

352
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:36,453
A friend doesn't have to ask a friend
to do something like that.

353
00:35:38,384 --> 00:35:41,302
Urgh, it's warm, even.

354
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:44,797
You don't even care, do you?

355
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:49,429
- I ain't drinking it.
- About yourself, you dumb fuck.

356
00:35:49,562 --> 00:35:53,560
How do you expect other
people to care about you?

357
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:58,779
It's people like you that are sending
this country down the tubes.

358
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:04,991
No sense of pride, no sense of loyalty,
no sense of nothing, man.

359
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,200
Why do you think there are so many
fucking welfare cases in this country?

360
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:13,745
Why do you think it is that Russia's
gearing up to kick our asses, man?

361
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:17,711
- Drink your beer.
- I won't drink my beer. I'm talking here.

362
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:23,465
These things are important to me. And,
believe it or not, you're important to me.

363
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,511
Look at that.

364
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,928
- Son of a bitch. Duck down.
- Hope they don't upset Aunto.

365
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:34,646
Duck down, goddammit!
You want to get caught?

366
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,653
Somebody fucking narked.

367
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:48,320
- Yeah.
- OK. Now, we can't panic.

368
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,622
I'll bet you it was Mike.
I'll bet you anything it was Mike.

369
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:56,543
We're just gonna drive around a little
while, see if we can't figure this thing out.

370
00:36:56,672 --> 00:37:01,334
We have to get you out of town somehow.
You have any money? We'll need money.

371
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,221
We have to put you up somewhere
until we get money.

372
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,931
We can't panic, though.
We're dead if we panic, OK?

373
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,595
Whatever you say, Layne.

374
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,059
OK.

375
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:38,958
Sure this is the right place?

376
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,927
- I can't understand it.
- You said she was buried.

377
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:46,466
No, she was just lying down here,
in the grass.

378
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,090
If this is some joke that you're playing...

379
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:52,181
<i>(man)</i> Captain Bennett! Over here.

380
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:57,936
<i>(Bennett)</i> Did the sight of this dead girl
move you in any particular way?

381
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:02,731
- <i>(Matt)</i> I don't know.
- Were you shocked, angered, saddened?

382
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:06,815
- Did the sight please you?
- I don't know how I felt.

383
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:08,744
- You knew this girl.
- Yeah.

384
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,363
- How did you feel about her?
- I don't know.

385
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:15,877
OK, I'm getting sick of "I don't know",
do you hear me?

386
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:20,298
Did you love her? Did you hate her?
Did you fuck her when you got bored?

387
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:24,090
- She was a friend, I guess.
- You guess? She was or she wasn't?

388
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,631
She was.

389
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,681
So you're standing there,
staring at your dead friend

390
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:32,142
like it's all some kind of a big joke, right?

391
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:36,809
Some adventure. What the hell
was going on in your head, Matt? Huh?

392
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:39,859
Exactly what?
What were you thinking about?

393
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:44,732
Or were you even thinking at the time?
Answer me, goddammit!

394
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:48,236
I don't know, OK?
You want me to make something up?

395
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,995
No.

396
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:02,465
I want you to tell me the truth.

397
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:06,887
The body, Matt.
How do you figure it got in the river?

398
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:10,101
- I don't know.
- Well, take a stab, huh?

399
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:13,975
What do you think? You think
maybe it rolled, or a big gust of wind

400
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:16,478
peeled off the river and scooped it up?

401
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:18,850
- Maybe.
- Or maybe somebody pushed it.

402
00:39:18,986 --> 00:39:20,314
- Maybe.
- Maybe you.

403
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:23,400
- I didn't push it.
- You're the only one we know was there.

404
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:25,441
- I told you about John.
- John?

405
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:29,823
Samson. We call him John
because of his last name, Toulette.

406
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:33,040
You know. Toulette, toilet, john.

407
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,826
That's very clever.

408
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:40,707
So you... you helped Samson,
John, push the body off.

409
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:42,668
- After I helped kill her.
- Yeah?

410
00:39:42,802 --> 00:39:45,719
Yeah, and fuck you, too!
I reported the thing, man.

411
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:49,630
- You act like I'm guilty of a crime.
- You think you're going somewhere?

412
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:53,218
I've got rights. You can't keep me here.
I didn't do anything.

413
00:39:53,354 --> 00:39:56,271
That was exactly your mistake, buddy.

414
00:39:56,399 --> 00:40:01,191
You saw this and didn't act immediately.
Makes you an accessory after the fact.

415
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,659
I could arrest you right now if I wanted to,
so why don't you sit down?

416
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:09,240
We'll talk some more.

417
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,745
I find you very interesting.

418
00:40:32,227 --> 00:40:34,054
Feck.

419
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:38,356
Feck.

420
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:44,696
Feck.

421
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:51,492
<i>(knocking)</i>

422
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,754
- Cheque's in the mail.
- <i>(Layne)</i> No time for bullshit. Open up.

423
00:41:01,882 --> 00:41:05,796
And put that thing away, last thing
we need is cops. Hurry your ass.

424
00:41:05,928 --> 00:41:09,795
- You've met John.
- Hey, I've killed men bigger than you.

425
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:14,594
He knows, Feck, he knows.
Look, Feck, John's in trouble.

426
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:17,219
- He needs your help.
- Trouble? What did you do?

427
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:19,230
<i>(Layne)</i> Nothing, Feck.

428
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:22,810
- I killed Jamie.
- Dammit, John!

429
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:27,407
He didn't exactly kill her,
it was an accident.

430
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:30,321
I killed a girl once. It was no accident.

431
00:41:30,912 --> 00:41:35,242
Put the gun right to the back of her head,
blew her brains right out the front.

432
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,285
I was in love.

433
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:41,626
- I strangled mine.
- Did you love her?

434
00:41:41,757 --> 00:41:44,164
- She was OK.
- OK, OK, Feck.

435
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:48,718
We've got to get John out of state.
Need your car.

436
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:51,765
You're not using my car.
You've got a car of your own.

437
00:41:51,892 --> 00:41:55,807
- Mine won't make it that far.
- No, I might need mine.

438
00:41:55,938 --> 00:41:59,852
Feck, you haven't been
out of this house in over five years.

439
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,689
What if somebody sees it, then?

440
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:06,860
They're still after me.

441
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,651
You know that.

442
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:11,454
They've been after me for 20 years.

443
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:16,455
I mean, you kill a person,
they don't let you forget.

444
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,960
They stick after you like ghosts.

445
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:25,212
I mean, they don't believe you
when you say you're sorry.

446
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:29,257
They want you to pay somehow.

447
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:31,428
OK, OK, OK. Uh, Feck.

448
00:42:31,557 --> 00:42:33,846
Forget the car.

449
00:42:33,977 --> 00:42:40,691
How about if John just stays here
while I go figure this thing out?

450
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:43,818
- Sure.
- OK, I'll be back.

451
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:49,188
John. I don't want you showing
your face outside this house.

452
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:58,740
Company.

453
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:00,501
Yeah. I...

454
00:43:00,629 --> 00:43:02,538
I love company.

455
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:26,231
- <i>(Matt)</i> What are you staring at?
- You're involved in this murder.

456
00:43:26,363 --> 00:43:29,483
I didn't kill anybody, dammit.

457
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:33,318
- John did it. John wasted Jamie.
- You don't seem too concerned.

458
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:36,290
Well, what the hell do you know?

459
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,456
You don't know anything.

460
00:43:38,585 --> 00:43:43,128
Tim hasn't come home tonight. He's only
12 years old, Matt. It's past midnight.

461
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:46,008
Where do my children go at night?

462
00:43:49,638 --> 00:43:53,221
Put the car into gear, Mom. He's OK.

463
00:43:55,811 --> 00:44:00,224
Hey. I saw your friend on TV tonight.
I thought maybe I might catch you, too.

464
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:02,979
- Fuck off.
- Don't you two start.

465
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,360
Why? His best friend killed a girl.
That's big news.

466
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:11,150
I mean, he dumped her body and he
bragged about it all round school. Whoo!

467
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:14,986
- I'll bet you know where he's hiding.
- They haven't caught him?

468
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:19,914
Don't give me that phoney surprise shit.
Your punk friend's been calling all night.

469
00:44:20,044 --> 00:44:25,038
- What? He help you kill the poor girl?
- Maybe he did. Maybe I am a killer.

470
00:44:25,174 --> 00:44:29,503
Why should you care? You're just here
to fuck my mother and eat her food.

471
00:44:29,637 --> 00:44:31,795
- <i>(mother)</i> Matt!
- Oh, he moves.

472
00:44:31,931 --> 00:44:34,303
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Try something.

473
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:36,722
Motherfucker! Food-eater!

474
00:44:36,853 --> 00:44:39,640
- <i>(Jim)</i> I'm gonna shove that up your ass.
- Come on.

475
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:41,053
<i>(Jim)</i> Come on, hit me.

476
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,524
- Hit me.
- Come on. Come on.

477
00:44:44,652 --> 00:44:47,737
- Tough guy, huh? Show me how tough.
- You're not worth it.

478
00:44:47,864 --> 00:44:49,903
<i>(Matt)</i> Shit.

479
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:52,906
Great.

480
00:45:01,127 --> 00:45:03,832
He's still killing her.

481
00:45:18,562 --> 00:45:22,180
Come here. Come here!

482
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:28,773
- Why do you pull shit like that?
- Leave me alone.

483
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:31,741
Answer me. Answer me.

484
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:33,990
I didn't do anything.

485
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:37,987
- Fuck you!
- Answer me. Why? Why?

486
00:45:39,124 --> 00:45:41,996
Hey. Get off of him. Come on.

487
00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:45,289
You dirty traitor.

488
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:48,093
- What do you mean by that?
- You know what I mean.

489
00:45:48,218 --> 00:45:50,923
I saw you on that phone tonight.

490
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:53,627
<i>(Matt)</i> You keep your little mouth shut.

491
00:45:53,765 --> 00:45:57,217
You're gonna pay for what you did.

492
00:45:57,352 --> 00:45:59,724
You're gonna die for what you did.

493
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:02,559
- You little shit.
- Hey.

494
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:05,937
- You're a dead man, Matt.
- <i>(Jim)</i> Hey!

495
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:10,488
Hey!

496
00:46:14,203 --> 00:46:16,907
Hey, Timmy. Timmy.

497
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:23,076
Hey, where you going? Come on.

498
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:26,082
You let them both get away?

499
00:46:26,215 --> 00:46:30,509
Madeleine, I got troubles of my own.
I don't want to fight your delinquent sons.

500
00:46:30,636 --> 00:46:32,842
- You don't care.
- You're the mother.

501
00:46:32,972 --> 00:46:36,056
I didn't give birth to the monsters.

502
00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:03,414
My fucking brother. Go get your
nun-chucks and your dad's car.

503
00:47:03,544 --> 00:47:06,035
I know where we can get a gun.

504
00:47:18,852 --> 00:47:20,595
Matt.

505
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:25,816
Where the hell have you been?
I've been looking for you all night.

506
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:30,355
- We should have never let Mike in on it.
- It could have been anybody, Layne.

507
00:47:30,488 --> 00:47:35,067
Bullshit. I happen to know my friends,
fucking know them.

508
00:47:35,202 --> 00:47:37,871
I know who's cool and who's not.

509
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:41,743
Maybe John finked on himself.

510
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:46,454
And maybe you finked on him.
Be realistic. This is us we're talking about.

511
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:49,674
We're a fucking team.
We're like Starsky and Hutch.

512
00:47:49,801 --> 00:47:53,336
- None of us would fuck it up on purpose.
- Where's John now?

513
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:57,765
Safely hidden away,
where he can't get in any trouble.

514
00:48:02,772 --> 00:48:06,640
No finer weed have you ever tasted.

515
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:12,313
My sister, she drives
this down from Humboldt,

516
00:48:13,408 --> 00:48:16,279
along with the regular Feck weed.

517
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,625
She comes to visit about once a year.

518
00:48:26,421 --> 00:48:28,544
She's real fat.

519
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:32,623
You ought to see her,
she's like a goddamn hippopotamus.

520
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:34,588
John?

521
00:48:39,143 --> 00:48:41,182
Where are you?

522
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:43,681
John?

523
00:48:45,107 --> 00:48:46,934
Shit.

524
00:48:56,494 --> 00:48:59,163
Who's that?

525
00:48:59,288 --> 00:49:01,613
- Who's there?
- <i>(Layne)</i> The mad rapist.

526
00:49:01,749 --> 00:49:03,576
Layne?

527
00:49:06,629 --> 00:49:09,713
John? Look, this isn't funny.

528
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,755
I'm getting scared here,
I'm about to scream.

529
00:49:21,936 --> 00:49:23,976
Have a heart attack.

530
00:49:24,105 --> 00:49:27,723
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Just came by to say hi.

531
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:31,442
- Some way of saying it.
- Hope I didn't wake you up.

532
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:34,738
Get dressed, come out here.
Bring all your money.

533
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:37,322
- What?
- Just do it.

534
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,285
- <i>(woman)</i> Clarissa? Is that you?
- Yes.

535
00:49:48,171 --> 00:49:50,211
Let's have it.

536
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,051
- Quarters?
- What do you expect?

537
00:49:55,178 --> 00:49:59,094
Waking me up in the middle of the night
and not telling me what's going on.

538
00:49:59,225 --> 00:50:01,681
What's going on?

539
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:05,310
2 dollars and money for gas.

540
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,891
One of us should get a job or something.

541
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:13,070
Are you coming, or what?
We've got to get Tony.

542
00:50:13,198 --> 00:50:16,448
You're letting yourself
get jerked around again, girl.

543
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:31,579
It's Tony's dad.

544
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:33,919
Tony.

545
00:50:34,177 --> 00:50:36,336
Tony.

546
00:50:44,646 --> 00:50:46,473
Shit!

547
00:50:55,073 --> 00:50:57,611
You should have stayed in bed.

548
00:51:05,626 --> 00:51:07,665
<i>(engine splutters)</i>

549
00:51:15,845 --> 00:51:17,884
What a crazy fucking guy.

550
00:51:18,013 --> 00:51:20,551
Tony's always broke anyhow.

551
00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:27,436
Clarissa! Hey!

552
00:51:29,108 --> 00:51:30,982
Bitchin'.

553
00:51:33,279 --> 00:51:35,568
Go up here.

554
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:40,486
That's Feck's.

555
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:47,915
Park over there.

556
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,457
John.

557
00:51:57,721 --> 00:52:00,093
Oh, there you are.

558
00:52:00,223 --> 00:52:03,094
- I was getting worried.
- Look what I found.

559
00:52:03,226 --> 00:52:05,599
We could get it stoned.

560
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:10,972
- You got that special dope you promised?
- Yeah. Yeah, sit down.

561
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:16,907
You know, Layne said you weren't
supposed to leave till he come back.

562
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:20,616
Layne can be a little annoying sometimes.

563
00:52:20,745 --> 00:52:23,117
He means well. Hey, look.

564
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:25,205
- Hey!
- <i>(cat yowls)</i>

565
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,539
Don't do that, man.

566
00:52:27,669 --> 00:52:30,242
What's the matter? Is she allergic to cats?

567
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,419
Cats have claws.

568
00:52:33,925 --> 00:52:36,760
Come on. Go get that cat
and get it out of here, man.

569
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:38,546
No.

570
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,349
Let it explore.

571
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:47,723
You're really attached to this thing,
aren't you? I saw you two dancing.

572
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:49,599
Hey, Feck.

573
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:53,184
Are you... You know,
are you a psycho or something?

574
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,941
No, I'm normal.

575
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:59,572
She's a doll. I know that. Right, Ellie?

576
00:53:02,537 --> 00:53:07,199
But you, you killed a girl, right?
Are you a psycho?

577
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:10,418
Yeah, probably.

578
00:53:10,546 --> 00:53:13,215
What other excuse do I have?

579
00:53:19,346 --> 00:53:21,635
You were a biker.

580
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,805
Yeah, years ago.

581
00:53:26,061 --> 00:53:28,303
Man.

582
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:34,643
I ate so much pussy in those days,
my beard looked like a glazed doughnut.

583
00:53:35,696 --> 00:53:39,314
- Is that when you lost your leg?
- Motorcycle accident.

584
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,941
Whole gang ditched me...

585
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:44,284
kept on riding.

586
00:53:44,413 --> 00:53:48,625
My leg was right out
in the middle of the street.

587
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:53,497
I remember lying in the gutter,
all bleeding and shaking,

588
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:57,214
staring at my leg, right next to a beer can.

589
00:53:57,343 --> 00:54:04,556
And I remember thinking, "That's my leg.
I wonder if there's any beer in that can."

590
00:54:05,977 --> 00:54:10,769
I also remember thinking,
"Maybe they can sew that leg back on."

591
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:14,767
And then there comes the ambulance
and runs right over all of it.

592
00:54:14,904 --> 00:54:20,776
- Wasted that leg.
- What'd I need it for? I got another one.

593
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:26,699
I figure once you start fighting,
you're always defending yourself.

594
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:31,789
Me, I get in a fight,
I go fucking crazy, you know?

595
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:35,420
Everything goes black.
And then I fucking explode, you know?

596
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:40,793
Like it's the end of the world. Who cares
if this guy wastes me? I'll waste him first.

597
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:45,888
The whole world's gonna blow up
anyway. I might as well keep my pride.

598
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:48,475
I got this philosophy.

599
00:54:49,522 --> 00:54:53,187
You do shit, and it's done...

600
00:54:54,277 --> 00:54:56,317
and then you die.

601
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:03,198
You got any more beer?

602
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:07,286
Shit. What time is it? Is it two yet?

603
00:55:07,415 --> 00:55:10,416
- It's creeping up.
- Fuck, man. Time for a beer run.

604
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:13,082
Does that car of yours work?

605
00:55:16,049 --> 00:55:18,671
You're not supposed to go anywhere.
Layne said...

606
00:55:18,802 --> 00:55:20,344
Layne, Layne, Layne.

607
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,926
You go. I'll stay here.

608
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:26,223
I'll be a good boy. Come on, Feck.

609
00:55:27,311 --> 00:55:32,305
There are people out there who would
like to see me dead, and I've told you that.

610
00:55:32,441 --> 00:55:35,644
So who buys your groceries for you?
Ellie?

611
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:36,976
<i>(rattle)</i>

612
00:55:37,112 --> 00:55:40,695
That. Did you hear that? Huh?

613
00:55:40,824 --> 00:55:43,660
Get paranoid, why don't you?

614
00:55:43,786 --> 00:55:45,695
No. No. Out front.

615
00:55:53,003 --> 00:55:56,704
- You didn't have to call me a stupid bitch.
- You would have driven past us.

616
00:55:56,841 --> 00:56:00,007
- We had to yell something.
- You yelled it.

617
00:56:00,136 --> 00:56:03,172
I've got a name.
You're lucky I didn't just drive home.

618
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:06,509
OK, OK, OK, I'm sorry, <i>Clarissa.</i>

619
00:56:06,642 --> 00:56:11,388
But you've got to understand that at a time
like this, where every second counts,

620
00:56:11,522 --> 00:56:14,440
a man can't waste his time
choosing words.

621
00:56:14,567 --> 00:56:18,102
- What is this, <i>Mission: Lmpossible?</i>
- <i>(Matt hums theme)</i>

622
00:56:18,237 --> 00:56:22,735
- I don't even see why you need us here.
- OK, it's not like I need you here,

623
00:56:22,868 --> 00:56:25,276
like, physically need you here.

624
00:56:25,412 --> 00:56:28,781
I mean, I can drive, I can collect money,

625
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:32,202
but we're a gang,
and I need you here, you know?

626
00:56:32,336 --> 00:56:35,788
Shut up. Would you shut up back there?

627
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:41,050
I feel real twisted now. Like I should go
to the cops and tell them where John is.

628
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:44,547
I wouldn't even joke about that, Clarissa.

629
00:56:44,682 --> 00:56:48,265
What would you do? Kill me?
You'd love that, I bet.

630
00:56:48,394 --> 00:56:51,099
You and John could run off
and be outlaws together.

631
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:57,185
But first, to show off, strap my body to
the top of this car and drive all over town.

632
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:01,695
Get... out.

633
00:57:02,784 --> 00:57:04,195
What?

634
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:08,277
You don't understand
a goddamn thing, do you?

635
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:13,332
Jamie is dead, dammit.

636
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:17,874
And there's nothing that we can do to
save her. Now, I happened to like Jamie.

637
00:57:18,008 --> 00:57:21,044
But John is still alive.

638
00:57:21,177 --> 00:57:23,300
Don't you see that?

639
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:25,719
And who's next on his list?

640
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:33,730
You're just gonna leave me here?

641
00:57:33,857 --> 00:57:36,146
What if John's around?

642
00:57:36,276 --> 00:57:38,684
Ask him to forgive you.

643
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:43,032
Here. Here's your money.
We don't need this shit.

644
00:57:46,203 --> 00:57:50,070
- We can't just leave her alone like this.
- OK.

645
00:57:50,207 --> 00:57:51,998
Fuck.

646
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:56,123
You stay here, and you protect her.

647
00:57:57,131 --> 00:58:01,211
I should have known that I was
the only one who could handle a crisis.

648
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:04,214
You want your money back, too?

649
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:06,386
Keep my money, Layne.

650
00:58:24,575 --> 00:58:28,359
- What's with you?
- I don't know. I figured I'd walk you home.

651
00:58:28,496 --> 00:58:30,535
I can make it on my own.

652
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,081
Well, come, if you're gonna come.

653
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:42,753
You want my coat or something?
You look kinda cold.

654
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:44,879
No, I'm OK.

655
00:58:45,014 --> 00:58:48,714
- You agree with him, don't you?
- Layne? Not really.

656
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:53,596
You probably do. Everybody goes along
with him, like he has some special power.

657
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:56,187
I think he's totally wrong.

658
00:58:56,317 --> 00:59:00,646
- Layne brags about me, doesn't he?
- What do you mean?

659
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:06,023
About getting me. I know he does,
so don't even say he doesn't.

660
00:59:07,286 --> 00:59:09,956
- Doesn't he?
- Not to me.

661
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:13,741
You look kinda cute
when you lie, you know?

662
00:59:13,876 --> 00:59:16,284
What?

663
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:19,955
You should see him when no one's
around and he's alone with me,

664
00:59:20,091 --> 00:59:22,582
and he thinks he might get lucky.

665
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:27,262
Shakes like a leaf.
Always has to be drunk, too.

666
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:32,930
He's like <i>Layne - Portrait of a Teenage</i>
<i>Alcoholic.</i> They could make a movie.

667
00:59:35,732 --> 00:59:39,860
Do you have to be drunk
before you can kiss a girl?

668
00:59:41,613 --> 00:59:43,652
Wait here.

669
00:59:50,622 --> 00:59:53,706
- <i>(woman)</i> Clarissa, is that you?
- Yes.

670
01:00:07,097 --> 01:00:13,301
I'm too hyped up to sleep. Let's go to the
park and look at the stars or something.

671
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:23,314
We'll pick up a sixer on the way.

672
01:00:29,745 --> 01:00:31,785
<i>(car approaches)</i>

673
01:00:55,606 --> 01:00:58,690
<i>(Layne)</i> Come on, goddammit.

674
01:00:58,817 --> 01:01:01,273
I know you're in there.

675
01:01:17,712 --> 01:01:19,835
Those assholes!

676
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:24,673
- Evening.
- Sorry, the bar's closed.

677
01:01:24,802 --> 01:01:28,503
- Why?
- It's five after two, man.

678
01:01:32,352 --> 01:01:35,139
- Hi, John.
- Hey, Matt.

679
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:39,020
Is this guy giving you any trouble?
You giving my friend trouble?

680
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:42,982
I cannot sell you guys beer
after two o'clock in the morning.

681
01:01:43,112 --> 01:01:46,861
I'm here to turn back the time.
Matt, take your beer and leave.

682
01:01:46,991 --> 01:01:49,992
- Look, John, it's not that...
- Do it.

683
01:01:51,663 --> 01:01:53,869
Thanks.

684
01:01:53,999 --> 01:01:57,831
Hey, you got any Bud in bottles?

685
01:01:58,628 --> 01:02:02,211
- I told you he's crazy.
- Just keep moving.

686
01:02:07,888 --> 01:02:10,379
Fuck you, then.

687
01:02:10,515 --> 01:02:12,971
You want to get caught,
want to fucking fry,

688
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:15,427
go ahead, treat your friends this way.

689
01:02:15,562 --> 01:02:18,100
Talk about speeding out.

690
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:29,026
Yeah.

691
01:02:32,496 --> 01:02:34,536
Find the gun.

692
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,026
Fucking shit!

693
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:09,529
Moko. Come here.

694
01:03:13,872 --> 01:03:17,407
- <i>(breaking glass)</i>
- <i>(alarm)</i>

695
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:48,359
Now we'll see if that gun
of yours still works.

696
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:53,568
You know, you're a crazy motherfucker,
you know that?

697
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:59,459
- You want a beer?
- You trying to get me drunk, Matt?

698
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:07,464
- I wish it was me who narked.
- What?

699
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:14,131
Who narked on John. And I don't even
care if you tell anybody what I just said.

700
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,636
But don't tell anybody what I just said.

701
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:26,768
I mean, I respect the person who narked.
You know, even if it was Mike.

702
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:29,574
Especially if it was Mike.

703
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:34,740
- It wasn't Mike.
- How do you know? Was it you?

704
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:40,783
It <i>was</i> you.

705
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:45,712
I didn't think I'd be the only one.
Don't tell Layne.

706
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:49,506
Of course I won't. God, weren't
you scared of people finding out?

707
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,795
Yeah.

708
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:57,174
But I kept seeing her face, Clarissa.
Didn't you keep seeing her face?

709
01:04:57,312 --> 01:05:00,811
I mean, it affected me. Didn't it affect you?

710
01:05:00,941 --> 01:05:02,483
It did.

711
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:05,100
I mean, we knew Jamie, right?

712
01:05:05,237 --> 01:05:08,736
And there she is, dead,
right there in front of us.

713
01:05:08,865 --> 01:05:13,942
And even that close, we don't
even feel like we've lost anything.

714
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:18,124
At least, I didn't. That got me the most.

715
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,622
I couldn't even cry for her, Matt.

716
01:05:21,128 --> 01:05:24,828
I mean, I cried when that guy
in <i>Brian's Song</i> died.

717
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:29,544
You'd at least figure I'd be able to cry
for someone we hung around with.

718
01:05:29,678 --> 01:05:32,798
It'll hit us. I know it will.

719
01:05:32,931 --> 01:05:35,601
Probably at her funeral.

720
01:05:35,726 --> 01:05:40,471
Sometimes I think
it'd be a lot easier being dead.

721
01:05:41,899 --> 01:05:46,526
Ah, that's bullshit.
You couldn't get stoned any more.

722
01:05:47,488 --> 01:05:50,157
I hear it's the same sensation.

723
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:55,992
I like you.

724
01:06:21,564 --> 01:06:23,142
OK.

725
01:06:23,274 --> 01:06:26,145
OK, OK, OK, OK.

726
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:29,860
I'm gonna take care of you, Toulette.
I'm gonna find you.

727
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:33,822
Someone's gotta take care of you.
I'm gonna take care of you, OK?

728
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:41,281
Dammit, John, where the fuck are you?

729
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:56,011
Hey, Ellie don't drink.

730
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:00,510
- She does something with this mouth.
- Ellie's a nice girl.

731
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:02,685
I'm sure she is.

732
01:07:02,815 --> 01:07:05,306
Like, real nice.

733
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:09,311
Let's see what kind of tricks
she knows here, huh?

734
01:07:09,447 --> 01:07:12,816
Oh, yeah, baby. That's nice.
Oh, that is real nice.

735
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:16,699
Would you please not do that, John?

736
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:19,535
Oh, baby, not so quick,
you're making me hot.

737
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:23,117
Please, John. Stop that.

738
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:27,666
Oh, oh... Oh, baby, baby, baby,
baby, baby, baby...

739
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:30,634
Please! <i>(echoes)</i>

740
01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:35,508
Cool.

741
01:07:37,226 --> 01:07:39,265
You hear that?

742
01:07:42,022 --> 01:07:44,062
Hey!

743
01:07:46,777 --> 01:07:49,778
Hey, you, eat me.

744
01:07:50,864 --> 01:07:54,233
Don't give me no shit. You eat me.

745
01:07:54,368 --> 01:07:57,120
<i>(man)</i> No, you eat me.

746
01:07:58,205 --> 01:08:02,285
- No, you eat me.
- You eat me, asshole.

747
01:08:02,418 --> 01:08:06,712
- No, you eat me, asshole.
- Shut up before I call the cops.

748
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:08,879
You shut up.

749
01:08:10,926 --> 01:08:13,418
Yeah?

750
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:15,179
Call 'em.

751
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:18,549
You better settle down, John.

752
01:08:18,684 --> 01:08:20,558
You try it.

753
01:08:20,686 --> 01:08:24,815
I better not. You come here,
and you sit down.

754
01:08:24,941 --> 01:08:27,514
We don't want to attract attention, man.

755
01:08:27,652 --> 01:08:30,819
Come on, Feck. Fire your gun.

756
01:08:30,947 --> 01:08:34,565
Bet you haven't fired it in years.

757
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:39,363
It's not something that
I just shoot off, without reason.

758
01:08:39,497 --> 01:08:41,490
Why not?

759
01:08:45,086 --> 01:08:48,253
It's got a sentimental value.

760
01:08:55,096 --> 01:08:58,762
Is this the gun you wasted the chick with?

761
01:08:58,892 --> 01:09:00,635
Huh?

762
01:09:01,812 --> 01:09:04,303
It is.

763
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:06,977
I bet you look back with pride, huh?

764
01:09:09,277 --> 01:09:11,519
It's something I did.

765
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:16,197
You wanted to show her who was boss.

766
01:09:16,703 --> 01:09:19,657
I don't know if you can understand.

767
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:24,240
I loved her.

768
01:09:24,377 --> 01:09:27,627
So why'd you kill her?
Did she tell you to eat shit?

769
01:09:27,756 --> 01:09:31,456
No. No.

770
01:09:31,593 --> 01:09:35,293
Come on, Feck, I'm with you.
Man, I killed a girl, too.

771
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:38,965
I wanted to show the world who's boss.

772
01:09:39,768 --> 01:09:41,725
What's that?

773
01:09:41,853 --> 01:09:44,391
It's nothing. Close your ears.

774
01:09:46,233 --> 01:09:48,902
<i>(Feck) You better give me the gun, John.</i>

775
01:09:52,781 --> 01:09:55,568
I didn't need no gun.

776
01:09:56,243 --> 01:09:58,615
I did mine with my hands.

777
01:09:58,745 --> 01:10:03,123
I was right there, I was right on top of her,
I was face to face.

778
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:07,705
<i>I wasn't even mad, really.</i>

779
01:10:07,838 --> 01:10:10,543
<i>She didn't look too surprised.</i>

780
01:10:10,674 --> 01:10:12,714
<i>Just a little stoned.</i>

781
01:10:14,261 --> 01:10:16,384
<i>After a few minutes,</i>

782
01:10:16,514 --> 01:10:22,469
<i>her face puffed out and it turned</i>
<i>dark purple and she just stared at me.</i>

783
01:10:23,938 --> 01:10:26,643
<i>She couldn't move.</i>

784
01:10:26,774 --> 01:10:29,561
<i>She couldn't scream.</i>

785
01:10:29,694 --> 01:10:33,691
<i>I had total control of her.</i>

786
01:10:39,495 --> 01:10:42,911
<i>I had total control of her.</i>

787
01:10:47,045 --> 01:10:49,500
<i>It all felt so real.</i>

788
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:53,213
It felt so... real.

789
01:10:54,219 --> 01:11:00,553
She was dead, there, in front of me,
and I felt so fucking alive!

790
01:11:06,481 --> 01:11:09,482
Is that how you felt, Feck?

791
01:11:10,694 --> 01:11:12,817
Not quite, man.

792
01:11:21,288 --> 01:11:23,328
Funny thing is...

793
01:11:25,376 --> 01:11:27,416
I'm dead now.

794
01:11:29,589 --> 01:11:33,373
- They're gonna fry me for sure.
- Ah, don't say that.

795
01:11:33,509 --> 01:11:35,632
Layne's gonna help you out.

796
01:11:35,762 --> 01:11:37,801
Layne?

797
01:11:39,307 --> 01:11:42,178
What the fuck...
Layne's gonna send me to Portland,

798
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:45,560
and hide me out in some
dark room for 20 years.

799
01:11:45,689 --> 01:11:48,180
So I end up like you, Feck.

800
01:11:50,694 --> 01:11:53,564
You think I want that?

801
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:57,942
No.

802
01:11:58,076 --> 01:12:00,152
You don't.

803
01:12:02,372 --> 01:12:06,073
Layne was never really a friend, anyway.

804
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:09,208
He doesn't even know me.

805
01:12:24,561 --> 01:12:26,969
I'll be your friend.

806
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,280
I like you.

807
01:12:41,787 --> 01:12:44,907
- I'm glad we decided to go against Layne.
- Mm-hm.

808
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:49,501
Sometimes I feel like
I don't even know him any more.

809
01:12:56,969 --> 01:13:00,220
He's lost. Let's get some sleep.

810
01:14:16,468 --> 01:14:19,220
You weren't supposed to get old.

811
01:14:25,435 --> 01:14:27,594
Oh, God.

812
01:15:16,529 --> 01:15:18,569
<i>(gunshot)</i>

813
01:15:31,586 --> 01:15:33,625
<i>(door opens)</i>

814
01:16:19,803 --> 01:16:21,546
Hit him again.

815
01:17:19,572 --> 01:17:21,611
I'm awake, I'm awake.

816
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:24,279
Oh, fuck.

817
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:26,035
Hi.

818
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,706
Can you tell us anything
about the murder?

819
01:17:32,835 --> 01:17:36,038
- Are you the killer?
- What?

820
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:41,418
Don't I even get a fucking phone call?

821
01:17:59,363 --> 01:18:04,109
- So now we get married, right?
- No. Let's get stoned instead.

822
01:18:04,243 --> 01:18:06,283
Ah, that'd be great.

823
01:18:06,412 --> 01:18:10,741
I could just lie here all day,
cut school and soak up the rays.

824
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:13,580
Shit, school.

825
01:18:13,711 --> 01:18:17,626
I really shouldn't miss Burkewaite's class.

826
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,048
You really have the hots
for that guy, don't you?

827
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,054
No.

828
01:18:26,182 --> 01:18:27,807
I just...

829
01:18:27,934 --> 01:18:32,014
- I don't know, respect him.
- You respect an adult?

830
01:18:32,147 --> 01:18:34,186
I really do need to get stoned.

831
01:18:34,315 --> 01:18:38,977
We'll stop at my house on the way to
school. I think I have some Feck weed left.

832
01:18:39,112 --> 01:18:42,979
I feel like someone
dipped me in used cooking oil.

833
01:18:43,116 --> 01:18:45,322
We could take a shower.

834
01:18:45,452 --> 01:18:48,951
I mean, you could, you know. By yourself.

835
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:52,660
No.

836
01:18:52,793 --> 01:18:57,040
<i>(mother)</i> What am I supposed to do, then?
What am I supposed to do with him?

837
01:18:57,172 --> 01:19:02,249
- Look, if it's gonna be a hassle...
- No, no hassle. OK? No hassle.

838
01:19:02,386 --> 01:19:04,509
Be right back, OK?

839
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:11,135
<i>(Jim)</i> You're supposed to raise him right.
The both of them. Control them.

840
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:15,979
<i>(mother)</i> That easy? Just tell 'em what
to do, tell 'em what not to do. Perfect kids.

841
01:19:16,108 --> 01:19:19,062
<i>(Jim)</i> It's not impossible.
My father raised me right.

842
01:19:19,194 --> 01:19:24,569
- Your father beat the shit outta you.
- So what? Huh? It'd make 'em listen.

843
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,906
Big fucking talk.

844
01:19:28,078 --> 01:19:29,905
Matt.

845
01:19:34,668 --> 01:19:36,495
Matt?

846
01:19:40,466 --> 01:19:41,960
<i>(knocks at door)</i>

847
01:19:42,093 --> 01:19:46,589
- I'm upset, Matt.
- Kick that idiot outta the house, then.

848
01:19:46,722 --> 01:19:50,091
Suppose I just kick you outta the house?

849
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,604
Tim didn't come home last night.

850
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:01,269
- Did you hear me?
- You got any spare dope?

851
01:20:01,405 --> 01:20:05,818
Oh, shit, I don't believe this.
Your little brother.

852
01:20:05,951 --> 01:20:11,028
He's 12 years old. He hasn't come home,
hasn't called. God knows what he's doing.

853
01:20:11,165 --> 01:20:14,664
What am I supposed to do?
I'm not his mother.

854
01:20:14,794 --> 01:20:18,661
Then I'm not his mother either.
I am nobody's mother.

855
01:20:18,798 --> 01:20:24,172
I give up this mother bullshit, it's not
worth it. You were all mistakes anyway.

856
01:20:24,303 --> 01:20:26,011
Don't give up, Mommy.

857
01:20:26,138 --> 01:20:29,092
I'm gonna leave you all,
just like your father did.

858
01:20:29,225 --> 01:20:31,798
Jesus, Ma, settle down, OK?

859
01:20:31,936 --> 01:20:33,478
Tim's all right.

860
01:20:33,688 --> 01:20:37,816
Look, everything's just a little crazy now,
a little outta control, OK?

861
01:20:37,942 --> 01:20:42,604
Look, I got somebody waiting outside
for me, I'm in a rush. We'll talk later.

862
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:49,157
I'm gonna take this joint. And don't
worry about Tim, OK? I'll get him home.

863
01:21:11,435 --> 01:21:14,886
Yeah, it really shocked me.
I think killing is wrong.

864
01:21:15,021 --> 01:21:18,355
<i>(woman)</i> What about all those people
going to see the body?

865
01:21:18,483 --> 01:21:22,018
That shocked me too.
I think they should have arrested John.

866
01:21:22,154 --> 01:21:24,859
- John?
- Well, he killed Jamie.

867
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:27,066
- You knew the killer?
- Yeah.

868
01:21:27,201 --> 01:21:29,905
You know, we both kinda knew the killer.

869
01:21:30,037 --> 01:21:34,200
As well as, um, in addition to,
you know, who he killed, too.

870
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:38,378
I mean, because of that,
it's pretty hard for us to be, um...

871
01:21:38,504 --> 01:21:41,707
- Objective?
- Yeah, that's it, objective.

872
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,838
You know, since we knew the two
alleged people involved and everything.

873
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:49,173
And whereas we might be upset
this morning or something,

874
01:21:49,306 --> 01:21:53,304
you know, we're not, because of
the fact that we're not objective at all.

875
01:21:53,436 --> 01:21:55,927
I also play guitar, by the way.

876
01:21:56,063 --> 01:21:58,815
- You don't even know what a friend is.
- I'm tired.

877
01:21:58,941 --> 01:22:01,812
- You call Samson a friend?
- Don't I get a phone call?

878
01:22:01,944 --> 01:22:04,696
Enough of a friend to cover up for?

879
01:22:04,822 --> 01:22:09,319
Help him hide the body. Maybe...
maybe even help him kill the poor girl.

880
01:22:09,453 --> 01:22:12,323
I didn't kill nobody.

881
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:17,704
Did he tell you why he did it?

882
01:22:18,837 --> 01:22:21,589
Weren't you even curious?

883
01:22:21,715 --> 01:22:23,922
Did you even give a flying fuck?

884
01:22:24,051 --> 01:22:29,390
These are stupid questions. I know
my rights. I know I get a phone call.

885
01:22:29,515 --> 01:22:34,391
You don't have any rights just yet, Layne.
We haven't arrested you.

886
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,272
Great. See you.

887
01:22:37,398 --> 01:22:39,521
OK.

888
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:42,106
OK. OK.

889
01:22:42,945 --> 01:22:45,271
Go. Make your phone call.

890
01:22:46,365 --> 01:22:49,532
Go call one of your precious friends.

891
01:23:14,102 --> 01:23:18,515
- I asked you a question.
- I didn't know her, OK?

892
01:23:18,648 --> 01:23:21,768
I just want to say,
it was horrible what those kids did.

893
01:23:21,902 --> 01:23:26,979
And the incident points up a fundamental
moral breakdown in our society.

894
01:23:27,115 --> 01:23:32,489
Thank you, Kevin, for your
insightful self-righteous indignation.

895
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:38,624
- I'd still like to hear from Tom.
- Just quit staring at me like that, man.

896
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:45,790
- Clarissa.
- Sorry I'm late.

897
01:23:45,926 --> 01:23:49,924
You knew Jamie, right?
You were one of her friends.

898
01:23:50,055 --> 01:23:52,842
Describe to us how you remember her.

899
01:23:53,392 --> 01:23:55,183
Remember her?

900
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:59,558
Yeah, what she looked like.
What she meant to you.

901
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:04,233
You're bullshit. What gives you the right
to put Clarissa on the spot like that?

902
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:07,398
I mean, she's upset, man.
Her friend is dead.

903
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:10,283
Are you upset, Clarissa?

904
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:14,905
Are you? I mean, if you are,
come on, let's get it off your chest.

905
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:17,613
Fuck you.
Why don't you just leave her alone?

906
01:24:17,751 --> 01:24:20,324
No, fuck you, man.

907
01:24:20,462 --> 01:24:22,704
Because I don't buy it.

908
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,999
You don't give a damn.

909
01:24:26,134 --> 01:24:30,843
I don't give a damn. Nobody in this
classroom gives a damn that she is dead.

910
01:24:30,973 --> 01:24:33,642
It gives us a chance to feel superior,

911
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:37,635
and to point up a fundamental
moral breakdown in society,

912
01:24:37,771 --> 01:24:41,390
but it doesn't really affect us, does it?

913
01:24:41,525 --> 01:24:46,318
Because if it did, none of us would
be in this classroom right now.

914
01:24:46,447 --> 01:24:50,943
We'd be out on the street,
half-crazy from lack of sleep,

915
01:24:51,077 --> 01:24:53,615
hunting down Samson Toulette
with a gun.

916
01:24:53,746 --> 01:24:57,613
- That's a reprehensible attitude.
- Just shut up, Kevin.

917
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:01,333
Are we gonna be tested on this shit?

918
01:25:28,531 --> 01:25:31,022
<i>(bell)</i>

919
01:25:51,722 --> 01:25:56,633
It's gonna be like this all day. Teachers
lecturing us about what monsters we are.

920
01:25:56,768 --> 01:26:02,225
- I can't handle much more.
- I say we split. Got just the place, too.

921
01:26:03,275 --> 01:26:06,395
Come on, Clarissa.
We're taking the day off.

922
01:26:10,616 --> 01:26:12,655
<i>(phone rings)</i>

923
01:26:26,842 --> 01:26:30,376
- Cheque... cheque's in the mail.
- Feck.

924
01:26:30,512 --> 01:26:35,008
Where the hell have you been?
Where's John?

925
01:26:35,142 --> 01:26:36,933
John.

926
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:39,302
He's gone.

927
01:26:39,438 --> 01:26:41,893
He's gone to the river.

928
01:26:43,692 --> 01:26:46,978
- I'm dying.
- Put your hands up!

929
01:26:47,112 --> 01:26:49,152
Company.

930
01:26:51,575 --> 01:26:54,742
<i>(policeman) Hello? Hello, who is this?</i>

931
01:27:28,905 --> 01:27:32,440
<i>(Tony)</i> This just blows my mind, man.
We're celebrities.

932
01:27:32,575 --> 01:27:35,991
- Just what you always wanted, huh?
- Well, it's a start.

933
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,790
They're having an open casket
funeral for Jamie.

934
01:27:38,915 --> 01:27:42,865
- <i>(girl)</i> That's gross.
- I know. I think it's in bad taste.

935
01:27:43,002 --> 01:27:45,244
<i>(Tony)</i> This entire episode is in bad taste.

936
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:49,045
Young people are a disgrace
to the human race. To all living things.

937
01:27:49,175 --> 01:27:53,884
To plants, even. You shouldn't even
be seen in the same room as a cactus.

938
01:27:54,014 --> 01:27:56,090
What's that?

939
01:27:59,561 --> 01:28:02,478
- Shit.
- Oh, my God. Not again.

940
01:28:02,606 --> 01:28:04,847
- Is it dead?
- It's a dummy.

941
01:28:05,358 --> 01:28:08,276
I'm getting outta here.
I told you this was stupid.

942
01:28:08,403 --> 01:28:10,443
No, no, no, hold it.

943
01:28:12,115 --> 01:28:16,409
What are you doing? Don't throw rocks,
it's a person. Maybe it's still alive.

944
01:28:16,536 --> 01:28:18,328
- No, it's Ellie.
- Ellie?

945
01:28:18,455 --> 01:28:21,029
- It's a sex doll.
- Who's Ellie?

946
01:28:21,166 --> 01:28:26,161
That's Ellie. Feck's girlfriend.
I wonder what she's doing here?

947
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:52,778
<i>(Tony)</i> It's just, like, you gotta make
the best of it while we're still alive,

948
01:28:52,908 --> 01:28:55,233
because any day now, boom!
And we're dead.

949
01:28:55,369 --> 01:28:58,488
- You want to know what I think?
- No, Mike.

950
01:28:58,622 --> 01:29:04,043
Somebody could murder you, you know.
Or Russia could send over nuclear bombs.

951
01:29:04,169 --> 01:29:09,543
I say we just get the Russians stoned.
It might mellow 'em out a touch.

952
01:29:10,551 --> 01:29:13,386
- Where's John?
- What?

953
01:29:13,512 --> 01:29:16,679
Forget about John. God.
Would you just forget about him?

954
01:29:16,807 --> 01:29:21,019
- I should kick your ass right here.
- What did I do?

955
01:29:24,774 --> 01:29:27,099
Leave me alone.

956
01:29:27,651 --> 01:29:32,148
You don't know what's going on.
None of you know what's going on.

957
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:34,570
I'll find him myself.

958
01:29:40,206 --> 01:29:42,412
- Layne?
- John!

959
01:29:42,542 --> 01:29:45,459
You've been awake all night
searching for the asshole.

960
01:29:45,586 --> 01:29:47,959
He's not an asshole.

961
01:29:48,089 --> 01:29:52,217
He's an asshole. He doesn't give a shit
about anything. His friends, himself.

962
01:29:52,343 --> 01:29:57,052
He doesn't care if he dies.
Can't you see? Would you listen to me?

963
01:29:57,181 --> 01:29:59,507
I know you don't care
about him that much.

964
01:29:59,642 --> 01:30:03,806
- You know that?
- I fucking know you, Layne.

965
01:30:03,938 --> 01:30:07,438
You get these ideas in your head
and you don't think.

966
01:30:07,567 --> 01:30:11,399
And this idea of helping John out,
it's not a good idea.

967
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:14,067
You have a better idea?

968
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:16,322
Yeah.

969
01:30:16,451 --> 01:30:19,369
Turn him in.

970
01:30:19,496 --> 01:30:22,248
You <i>would</i> do that, wouldn't you?

971
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:24,415
I did.

972
01:30:26,044 --> 01:30:28,831
You should finish the job, Layne.

973
01:30:28,964 --> 01:30:33,425
- I should kill you for even saying that.
- You're talking shit and you know it.

974
01:30:33,552 --> 01:30:36,837
You turn on us so easily.

975
01:30:36,972 --> 01:30:40,756
I thought you were a fucking friend.

976
01:30:40,893 --> 01:30:44,594
I knew that me and John
were alone all along.

977
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:46,770
- Layne.
- Let him go.

978
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,902
What's with him?

979
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,238
He's upset.

980
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:00,906
John.

981
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:07,124
John.

982
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:09,415
John.

983
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,377
John.

984
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:20,346
<i>(wails)</i>

985
01:31:49,463 --> 01:31:51,586

986
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,875
You shouldn't have hit me.

- Don't be stupid, Tim.
- You finked on John.

988
01:32:01,476 --> 01:32:04,049
I'm your brother. Give me the gun.

989
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:12,349
Look. I'm sorry I hurt you, OK?
I was upset.

990
01:32:12,487 --> 01:32:14,610
Now give me the gun, OK?

991
01:32:18,117 --> 01:32:20,157
Goddammit, Tim.

992
01:32:21,621 --> 01:32:23,661
I'm your brother.

993
01:32:40,807 --> 01:32:42,847
Come on.

994
01:32:56,491 --> 01:32:59,029
They fucking killed him.

995
01:33:16,511 --> 01:33:18,551
They killed him.

996
01:33:21,016 --> 01:33:24,136
Because there was no hope for him.

997
01:33:24,269 --> 01:33:26,974
There was no hope at all.

998
01:33:28,523 --> 01:33:30,563
He didn't love her.

999
01:33:31,568 --> 01:33:34,273
He didn't feel a thing.

1000
01:33:37,825 --> 01:33:39,864
I, uh...

1001
01:33:41,495 --> 01:33:44,330
at least loved her.

1002
01:33:44,456 --> 01:33:46,496
I cared for her.

1003
01:33:47,835 --> 01:33:51,500
I mean... You understand, don't you?

1004
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,339
Sure you do.

1005
01:33:58,804 --> 01:34:02,339
I don't, uh, like killing people.

1006
01:34:04,977 --> 01:34:07,646
But sometimes it's necessary.

1007
01:34:12,485 --> 01:34:15,402
That's enough for now.

1008
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:17,403
I...

1009
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:21,326
I'd like you all to leave now.

1010
01:34:23,913 --> 01:34:27,199
I'm very tired, and sort of depressed.

1011
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:34,672
I lost a good friend today, you know?

<i>Please don't say your last goodbye</i>

1014
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:58,986

1015
01:34:59,116 --> 01:35:04,158
<i>Say your last, your last goodbye</i>

1016
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:10,291
<i>Yes, you're leaving me</i>

1017
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:15,378
<i>Leaving me here to cry</i>

1018
01:35:18,094 --> 01:35:21,131
<i>You know I love you</i>

1019
01:35:21,264 --> 01:35:22,924

1024
01:35:46,081 --> 01:35:51,123
