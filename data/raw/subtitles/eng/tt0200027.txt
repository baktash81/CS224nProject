1
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:41,284
There on a windswept bluff, he stands
waiting. The man of your dreams.

2
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:46,242
The man who"II love you more
than anything the rest of your life.

3
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,718
You run to each other.
Your bodies, your lips...

4
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:56,003
...they"re coming closer and closer
together. Until, finally...

5
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:58,564
...you kiss.

6
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:02,920
Okay, go.

7
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,324
Janet, like this.

8
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,807
I feel weird, Bev.

9
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:14,884
Weird? Wait till he shoves
his tongue in your mouth.

10
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:26,680
Ann, did you get the lights
for the dining room?

11
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:29,084
l"m looking for them, Teresa.

12
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,439
Now this is Christmas, huh?

13
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:33,208
Yes, it"s beautif ul.

14
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,400
Have Lou look for them.

15
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,442
She wants it up
before Leo and Bev get back.

16
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,401
I gotta go.

17
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:46,560
Okay, Leo.

18
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:52,124
Beverly Ann Donof rio, your father"s
waiting to go buy the tree!

19
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,001
l"m coming, Mom!

20
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:57,008
Okay, so is Christmas.

21
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:03,440
-This song"s giving me a headache.
-Wait. Before you go with Pop.

22
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,766
Why would a guy
put his tongue in my mouth?

23
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,482
What?!

24
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:13,162
A boy does that because
he wants you to bite it off.

25
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,721
Go.

26
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,048
Bye, Mom.

27
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,168
Hi.

28
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:33,688
-You ready?
-Yeah.

29
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,607
Let"s go.

30
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,920
-Pop, everyone"s decorating the house.
-Good.

31
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,562
Janet wanted to come.

32
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:45,681
When you"re in college,
it"II be her turn.

33
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:49,361
Dreaming of <i>w</i>armth?
Dream <i>w</i>ith the Everly Brothers.

34
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:53,119
-Good, that"s our song!
-Great! Ready? One, two:

35
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,367
Pop, this is it! Pull over.

36
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,639
The big one, there. See?

37
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,647
l"II buy that for you when l"m rich.

38
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,046
-I bet you will.
-Mom and sis would like it.

39
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,121
You know what you want for Christmas?

40
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,726
You want the bike, right?

41
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:46,080
It"s the bike. But you think
it"s too expensive.

42
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,484
See, I know how you think.

43
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:53,683
Speak up. If you don"t ask for
anything, it"s what you get, nothing.

44
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,248
Okay.

45
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,320
There"s this guy, Billy Schnar,
he"s really cute.

46
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:05,479
Billy Schnar?

47
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,762
We"re the smartest in class.
You know who he likes? Guess!

48
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:13,439
-Who?
-Melissa Thomas, you know her?

49
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:16,447
The one with braces and ugly red hair.

50
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:21,558
She thought Israel was in Europe.
You know why he likes her? Guess!

51
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,444
-Because she"s stupid.
-No, because she"s got boobs!

52
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:29,568
Or it looks like she does,
but she doesn"t. She wears a bra...

53
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,408
...which s<i>q</i>uishes her fat together...

54
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:35,243
...and makes her look like
she has big boobs.

55
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:38,925
Pop, l"m gonna die
if I don"t marry Billy Schnar.

56
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,845
l"m gonna die all because
Melissa has boobs?

57
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,246
That"s just way too tragic,
even for Shakespeare.

58
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:51,240
Okay, Pop, so that"s why for
Christmas, l"d like a bra.

59
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:55,884
To enhance what I got,
which is more than Melissa.

60
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,042
-You"re too young.
-Pop, you can"t negotiate my boobs.

61
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:03,799
Too young or not, l"ve got them.
l"m a woman.

62
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:07,479
-It"s hard to see through my clothes.
-<i>Q</i>uiet!

63
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:09,845
The answer is no.

64
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,728
Keep your mind on books, not boys.

65
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,640
<i>T</i>his is <i>w</i>hy therapists are <i>w</i>ealthy.:
moments like this.

66
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:29,969
<i>W</i>hy didn<i>'</i>t he just get her the bra?
/t<i>'</i>s certainly cheaper than a bicycle.

67
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,167
<i>P</i>arents and the damage they can do.

68
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:36,008
Sometimes, it<i>'</i>s endless.

69
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:39,966
But she survived.
<i>y</i> ou kno<i>w w</i>hat they say.:

70
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,559
<i>"T</i>hat <i>w</i>hich doesn<i>'</i>t kill you,
makes you <i>w</i>ant to die. <i>"</i>

71
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:48,198
/f she <i>w</i>as Southern,
she<i>'</i>d have turned life into a song.

72
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:54,243
Since she<i>'</i>s from Connecticut,
she turned it into a memoir.

73
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:57,640
Someone <i>w</i>ants to publish it,
if she clears one hurdle.

74
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:59,726
So she called me for help.

75
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:05,124
<i>T</i>hat<i>'</i>s <i>w</i>hy this is a tough day
to tell her /<i>'</i>m leaving her.

76
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:12,086
/ can al<i>w</i>ays tell <i>w</i>hen she<i>'</i>s nervous.
She <i>w</i>ears a lot of makeup.

77
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,043
And today, she<i>'</i>s packed on
an e<i>x</i>tra layer of nervous.

78
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,477
Forty minutes late.
l"m not complaining.

79
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,843
-It"s just so unlike you.
-Sorry.

80
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,839
<i>W</i>e <i>w</i>ent off to solve the problem.
Her problem. Mine <i>w</i>ould have to <i>w</i>ait.

81
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:31,884
-What happened?
-You"re cold, lean into the vent.

82
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:35,721
Sorry.

83
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:42,328
-Thanks for driving me to Wallingford.
-Just make it fast.

84
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,402
If Ray doesn"t sign,
they won"t publish it.

85
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:46,843
He will.

86
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:51,406
-I know seeing Ray is hard for you.
-Seeing Ray doesn"t bother me.

87
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,805
It should. And I understand.

88
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,767
I won"t make myself nuts.
l"II stay calm and be positive.

89
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,368
Good.

90
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,318
Did I show you the galleys?

91
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,449
It"s starting to look
like a real book.

92
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:25,005
-Did you just put spit in my hair?
-Yeah, l"m fixing it. Sorry.

93
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:30,242
Just a little--

94
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:32,842
Okay.

95
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:39,799
I have a surprise for you.
I finished the dedication.

96
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:47,807
"Of the many men who have come into my
life, there is finally one I trust.

97
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:52,047
Jason, this book is for you."

98
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,242
Don"t take this the wrong way...

99
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,919
...but don"t dedicate the book to me.

100
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:06,962
Let"s just leave it at that.
Just don"t.

101
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,763
Fine. Fine. Great.

102
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,442
l"m sorry, it is possible I have
my own stuff going on today.

103
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,684
What? What is it?

104
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:23,847
No. It"s nothing.

105
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,048
l"II get over it. Look, don"t worry.

106
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:33,728
l"m having a bad day.
What"s one bad day, right?

107
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,604
One day? Are you kidding?
Let me <i>q</i>uote myself.

108
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:43,044
"One day can make your life.
One day can ruin your life.

109
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:48,084
All life is, is four or five big days
that change everything."

110
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:59,046
Sky Barrister is my dreamboat!

111
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,401
Sit down, you"II hurt yourself.
Be caref ul.

112
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:07,246
-Tina, you need a little more rouge.
-I have some right here.

113
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:17,362
Hey, Bev! Tina!

114
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,681
-Where you going?
-We"re going to a party!

115
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,607
-Can we come?
-Sorry.

116
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:25,483
She wouldn"t let us come
to some party.

117
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,566
Are we invited to this party?

118
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,919
-They"re Fay"s f riends.
-They"re not.

119
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:33,041
My parents are f riends
with their parents.

120
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:36,559
What"s important is
Sky Barrister will be there.

121
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:39,602
Sky has had his hands
in everything you got.

122
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:43,637
And has a ton of your poems.
And does he call you once?

123
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,807
No. Bev, you are truly a great person.

124
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:50,240
But someone as conceited
as Sky won"t see that.

125
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:53,247
Because all he can see is himself.

126
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:57,884
-You know l"m right.
-It"s true, Bev.

127
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:02,242
-Let me wear that dress.
-What?

128
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:07,285
If I look half as beautif ul
as you in that dress...

129
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:09,639
...Sky will have to notice me.

130
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:12,841
-You can wear my dress.
-No.

131
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,285
No, Bev. It won"t fit.

132
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,208
-You got to let me wear that dress.
-Why?

133
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:24,246
Because I love you.

134
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:28,203
-Please, please, please.
-All right.

135
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:29,808
Put the top up!

136
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,564
Look at all these new cars.
Tina, park in the street.

137
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:46,758
Come on!

138
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:51,281
-Did you take my scarf?
-I got it. You"re sitting on my purse.

139
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:56,040
Bobby will crash with his f riend.
This dress is swimming on me.

140
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,918
And don"t blame me
if this party"s boring and no f un.

141
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,040
Fun? Fun?

142
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:05,122
Fun is what you bring with you.

143
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:11,325
-Do I have something in my braces?
-I don"t know.

144
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:12,843
There.

145
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:14,880
-It"s out.
-Yeah.

146
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:20,602
Who invited her to my party?
Who? Did you? Did you?

147
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:22,401
I invited Fay.

148
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,437
The noseguard points to me,
like he"s gonna hurt me.

149
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:31,206
-<i>Q</i>uick, give me that!
-They"re stuffing themselves.

150
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:35,402
-Guess it"s what Bobby likes.
-Wonder what that feels like.

151
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,518
-Are they even?
-I think so.

152
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,601
-You could be with any girl here.
-Of course, I know that.

153
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,765
l"m just a placekicker.

154
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:49,559
Bobby, wait. Where are we going?

155
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,681
-Come here.
-What?

156
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,880
Mind if I sit?

157
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:04,842
Great.

158
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:12,282
-Who"s that sitting on Kevin?
-Some townie.

159
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,885
-Who"d you come with?
-Ray Hasek.

160
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:21,047
-Him? Where is he?
-In the bathroom.

161
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:23,080
Stay here.

162
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:05,119
Hello, Sky.

163
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:13,885
Tommy, why do you gotta
sneak up on people?

164
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:15,966
You idiot. Shoot!

165
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,808
Sorry, Bev. I didn"t mean
to scare you.

166
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:22,968
l"m sorry. l"m just completely
distracted at the moment.

167
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,842
Don"t talk right now.

168
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:36,686
-Hungry?
-Oh, sure.

169
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,399
-You want some salt?
-Sure.

170
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:00,688
I checked out F. Scott
Fitzgerald"s stories--

171
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:06,646
l"m doing something daring right now,
and l"m working up some optimism.

172
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:09,921
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

173
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,643
-l"m just a big chicken.
-No, Bev.

174
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:21,363
Someone once said a coward and a hero
have one thing in common: fear.

175
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,562
You may be scared,
but you"re no coward.

176
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,647
I come off the field,
following me are scouts...

177
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:32,922
...f rom Notre Dame, Penn State,
Ohio State, all talking to me.

178
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:37,964
So l"m like, "Alphabetical order."
So the guy f rom Penn State is first--

179
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:42,640
Sky, wouldn"t Notre Dame be first
if it"s alphabetical order?

180
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,643
-Hi, Sky.
-Hi!

181
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:50,007
Here.

182
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:53,008
Don"t open it now.

183
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:57,844
-Read it later when you can.
-Later when I can.

184
00:14:58,049 --> 00:14:59,402
Read it.

185
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:02,885
"Silver buttons of night"s
velvet dress unbuttoned...

186
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,559
...to reveal my simple universe
and our heavenly touch."

187
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:10,648
The last one was about her legs
trembling and heaving bosom.

188
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:13,158
-She loves you.
-Bev!

189
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:16,920
I like the poem, Bev! Bev!

190
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,083
-Don"t open that door!
-Okay.

191
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:54,358
Is everything all right?

192
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:04,761
Can I have a cigarette?

193
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,284
You"re blowing it out.

194
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:21,962
You"re blowing it out.
Don"t breathe out. You do it.

195
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:29,963
I know you. You were in the play
at the high school.

196
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:33,639
You"re Fay"s f riend.
You"re the smart one.

197
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:36,644
l"m Ray Hasek.

198
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:38,282
Bobby"s f riend.

199
00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:43,080
Fay made us go because she painted
all the background stuff. Remember?

200
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:46,048
-You were the girl.
-Juliet.

201
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:47,477
Yeah!

202
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,082
You were beautif ul.

203
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:55,962
I told Bobby, "You watch,
that girl"s gonna be something."

204
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,883
-That"s what I said.
-I write my own stuff too.

205
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:06,888
-And l"m probably gonna go to NYU.
-l"m sorry.

206
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:11,924
But no, that"s good. Wow.

207
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:21,286
Look, I know it"s none of my business,
but why are you crying?

208
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:24,166
Because of this guy.

209
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:28,442
He said very personal stuff about me
in f ront of everyone.

210
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:33,485
But the poem was good.
I think it"II hit him on the way home.

211
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:36,328
Wait. Who is this guy?

212
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:41,768
Sky Barrister.

213
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,638
Oh, yeah. I know that asshole.

214
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:50,280
l"II go tell him not
to say stuff about you.

215
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:54,278
He"s very handsome,
so don"t hit him in the face.

216
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:01,725
What is she still doing here?

217
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:04,364
She"s blond, 26.

218
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:07,925
And who"s that? I didn"t invite him.

219
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,757
-Hey, Sky.
-What"s going on?

220
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:17,886
Hit me. Right here.

221
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:22,607
No, man! Hit me right here!

222
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:26,758
No! Come on, hit me!

223
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:31,408
-My hand!
-Sky!

224
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,926
-See? He came in, I went down.
-It"s broken!

225
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:41,838
-There goes the season!
-Come on. Come on!

226
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:43,721
Let"s get him!

227
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:46,238
-Thanks, Tommy.
-See you Monday, Bev.

228
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:49,282
-Out of the way, Tommy!
-Go, go, go!

229
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:52,163
Get in the car!

230
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:55,679
-Let"s go!
-Get in the car!

231
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:58,278
-I go down and--
-Get in the car!

232
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:01,880
-We forgot Tina!
-She"s got her own car.

233
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:05,047
Tommy"s car"s blocking the way.
Go, Bobby!

234
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:10,880
-Bev, can you hop in f ront, please?
-All right.

235
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,922
This is Bobby"s and my favorite spot.

236
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:17,758
Ray, take her. Come here, you.

237
00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:20,927
-Bev, get in f ront with Ray.
-l"m going.

238
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:23,085
Come here, sweetie.

239
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:28,646
Come on, babe. You know
l"m heading out to basic. Please!

240
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:32,202
God, l"m gonna miss you so much.

241
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:34,881
Thanks.

242
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,201
Thanks for doing that
for me back there.

243
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:51,560
-Does your head hurt?
-No.

244
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:56,797
My father always said
that my head was like a rock.

245
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:59,569
He broke his hand twice on it.

246
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:03,603
What"s in your chest?
What is this?

247
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:08,844
-It"s Bev"s dress. It"s too big.
-Oh, sweetie.

248
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,199
It didn"t look right on me.

249
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:15,243
-How come I never see you in school?
-I don"t go.

250
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,641
-Don"t your parents care?
-There"s a lot of it!

251
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:22,567
My...

252
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:26,922
...pop, he got drunk and died fishing.

253
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:31,168
And Ma, she doesn"t want me
hanging around my sister.

254
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:34,008
She thinks l"m bad like my brother.

255
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:38,121
So you"re all alone.
You don"t have anybody.

256
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:44,326
Well, there"s Lizzard, he"s a f riend.

257
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:47,242
And I got Bobby. He"s like family.

258
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:50,521
-What you doing?
-Spelling my name in hickies.

259
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:52,162
Just your first name.

260
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:54,963
-Let"s get you home.
-Stop!

261
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:57,803
-Oh, my knee!
-Are you okay?

262
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:00,045
I don"t wanna go home yet.

263
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,287
But, I....

264
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,769
Listen. Don"t.

265
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:14,804
Beverly, listen. You shouldn"t get
mix ed up with me. l"m no good.

266
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:18,484
You were good to me.

267
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:27,798
Open your eyes.
Don"t take them off of me.

268
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:33,607
Cool.

269
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:41,368
Don"t. What are you doing?

270
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:46,288
-You better stop laughing.
-Leave me alone, Fay.

271
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:51,320
God bless you.

272
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:54,003
What is that?

273
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,159
What the heck is this?

274
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:02,882
-Bev, stop laughing. Give me my shoes.
-Ray. Ray!

275
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,206
-It"s her father.
-l"m looking. I found one.

276
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,683
It"s your father!

277
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:12,007
-Pete, we"re taking them in.
-What?!

278
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,404
Sorry, Daddy.

279
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,605
What happened to your dress?

280
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:19,119
-You won"t see that girl again.
-You can"t be trusted.

281
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:22,048
What? Are you chewing?
Say it again.

282
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:24,126
l"II call you back.

283
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:27,765
Look at you. For God"s sake,
button your blouse.

284
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:35,928
-What happened to you?
-Nothing. l"m still the same.

285
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:39,439
You know that guy"s brother got
sent up for robbery?

286
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:43,602
Yes, but he"s doing well in prison.
He"s learning a trade.

287
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:47,689
All we were doing was making out.

288
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:51,601
I just met him.
l"d never go past second base.

289
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:55,802
Which means nothing below the waist.
My waist, not his.

290
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:04,886
You"re home. Get out.

291
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:11,480
Pop, I swear, nothing happened.

292
00:23:30,449 --> 00:23:33,919
Look at that guy. He"s so hot!

293
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:41,798
-Wait.
-No.

294
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:47,888
/ had to run out. Jason, if it<i>'</i>s you,
say something great.

295
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,438
It"s me.

296
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:55,007
The last two weeks
have changed my life.

297
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:58,963
l"m not involved with her.
I had to do this just one day.

298
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:02,081
l"m gonna tell her
about us this morning.

299
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:06,567
This afternoon, tops. I swear l"II
be back by 6:00 tonight...

300
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:09,078
...and you and I are on that plane.

301
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:13,487
And, okay, here goes. Amelia...

302
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:20,045
...I love you.

303
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:27,404
That girlf riend of yours
sure likes that horn.

304
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:29,799
She"s not my girlf riend.

305
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:36,038
-She"s my mother.
-Your mother?

306
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:40,642
Kill me, Fay,
because I want to die!

307
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:44,808
I want to be dead!
That"s not too much to ask for.

308
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:48,638
How will I tell my parents?
We can"t talk about anything.

309
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:52,637
How am I supposed to tell them
I committed a mortal sin?!

310
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:55,727
Okay! I know, I understand.

311
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,363
Calm down. We"II practice.

312
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:03,967
Pretend l"m your parents. Say what
you"II say. You"II get through it.

313
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,763
Tell me like you would tell them.

314
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,645
-Mom. Pop.
-Yeah?

315
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:20,568
-I don"t know how to tell you this.
-But...?

316
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:25,324
-l"m pregnant.
-My daughter"s a tramp.

317
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:29,884
My daughter is a tramp!
My daughter"s a tramp!

318
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:33,126
You"re 15 years old!
How could you do this?

319
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:36,765
You make me sick to my stomach!
Just take my gun!

320
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:42,601
Take my gun and shoot me in the head,
tramp! I wish you were never born!

321
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:45,366
Okay, go.

322
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:51,559
You can do it.

323
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:58,522
-Maybe you should tell Ray first.
-Okay.

324
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:04,967
In Puerto Rico you can get rid of it,
but I don"t have any money.

325
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:08,206
-Do you have any money?
-No.

326
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,922
That"s it, then.

327
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:15,962
I have to throw myself
at my parents" mercy.

328
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:21,440
If they help me take care of the baby,
I can get a job and save money.

329
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:23,207
That"d be good.

330
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:27,004
Then I could move to New York,
get a job at a newspaper.

331
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:31,361
-Nothing big, something small.
-I can"t. Wait! New York?

332
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:33,242
Bev...

333
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,437
-...what about me?
-What about you?

334
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,047
Well...

335
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,317
...I love you. A lot.

336
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,641
What, Bev?

337
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:47,965
What are you talking about?!

338
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:51,044
What?

339
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:55,802
-Why is this happening to me?
-Bev, l"m sorry. Come on.

340
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:59,001
My life is over! I might as well jump!

341
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:01,404
What are you doing? Come on.

342
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:04,368
We"ve been going out. I mean...

343
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:06,640
...do you love me?

344
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:13,688
-It was summer.
-Yeah, but do--?

345
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:17,240
You"re not the guy
l"m supposed to end up with.

346
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:21,285
It would derail my life.

347
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,528
Bev, look at me. Bev!

348
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:27,004
Okay, look. Maybe...

349
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:32,724
...you"re not supposed to end up with
me. But l"II make you happy. I swear.

350
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:37,920
If you married me,
I would cherish you...

351
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:41,439
...for all the time, till death.
Till I die.

352
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:43,685
Till death. For the--

353
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:47,598
I may not be the perfect guy
in a lot of ways...

354
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:52,047
...but l"m the right guy
because nobody will love you like me.

355
00:27:58,689 --> 00:28:03,922
Please marry me.
Because l"m shit without you.

356
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:08,005
How romantic.

357
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:12,122
A marriage proposal
that contains the word "shit."

358
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,565
Sorry.

359
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:18,006
Okay, just hold on, Fay.
Janet, door.

360
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:20,325
Can you believe he did that?

361
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:26,087
I swear, I would rather die than marry
Ray. I don"t care what my father says.

362
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:29,241
Bev...

363
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:32,964
...I know this sounds horrible...

364
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:38,204
...but my aunt fell down the stairs
when she was preg-- You know.

365
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:40,684
And she...

366
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:42,880
...you know.

367
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:46,798
And I thought maybe you could--
You know?

368
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:49,280
Good night, Fay.

369
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:53,040
Janet?

370
00:28:56,489 --> 00:29:00,880
l"II give you five bucks
if you throw me down the stairs.

371
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:03,721
No!

372
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:07,326
Janet? You"d better be asleep!

373
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:45,403
What was that?

374
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:47,321
What are they doing?

375
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:48,877
I don"t know.

376
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,364
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

377
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,686
Dear Mom and <i>P</i>op.:

378
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:09,082

...I have to spit it out.

I am pregnant."

386
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:38,242
Wow. That"s really good writing.

387
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:40,966
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

388
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:44,166

391
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:55,888
Beverly.

392
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:04,365
This is what we"II do. She"II go
to school until she starts to show.

393
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:07,364
Then she"II get
her e<i>q</i>uivalency.

394
00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:10,118
Then she"II get
a job as a secretary.

395
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:14,722
After they"re married,
they"II move into the rec room. Right?

396
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,082
That"s not the plan
I have in mind.

397
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:23,722
l"ve decided what"s best
for my f uture...

398
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:26,758
...is not getting married.

399
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:31,602
As you can see f rom my letter,
I have a flair for writing.

400
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:34,603
-So my plan is--
-Plan?

401
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:36,484
You have a plan?

402
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:39,962
You have a plan.

403
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:42,446
Well, I had a plan too.

404
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:47,922
I was gonna work hard,
raise a good family...

405
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,446
...hold my head up proud.

406
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:53,043
That plan"s dead.

407
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:56,962
Know what I thought?

408
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:00,166
No. No, I better not.

409
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:08,047
Go ahead.
Say whatever you want.

410
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:14,128
You were special.

411
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:17,846
And you ruined your life.

412
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:21,322
And you broke my heart.

413
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:33,322
I just....

414
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:35,248
Say something.

415
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:45,120
Leo, it"II be okay.

416
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:47,320
Don"t cry, Pop. Please.

417
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,405
Mom"s right.
Everything will be okay.

418
00:32:52,689 --> 00:32:54,645
We"re gonna get married...

419
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:57,441
...because we"re in love...

420
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:01,124
...and we"re gonna get married.

421
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,328
Ex cuse me!

422
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:10,483
-You"re late.
-You know my parents.

423
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:12,321
I had to sneak out.

424
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:13,922
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

425
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:17,918
-What"s the shoe polish for?
-Decorating the car, silly.

426
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,247
I got her some Green Stamps.
I hope it"s okay.

427
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:24,201
Please, stand still.

428
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,797
-Sexy.
-Stop it.

429
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,203
Stop hitting her.

430
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,964
-Come on. I can"t get it.
-Please!

431
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:33,402
-Stop moving around. You ready?
-Stop!

432
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:35,201
All right? Do I got it?

433
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:39,084
-Take the picture!
-Don"t yell in f ront of the church!

434
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:41,485
Take the picture, will you?!

435
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:44,358
-Everybody stand still.
-My baby.

436
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,202
That was a good one.

437
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:49,799
-Can I have some more?
-Yeah.

438
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:00,278
-Can we get some more wine, please?
-Don"t!

439
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,767
Sorry.

440
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:08,358
Okay, this is for Bobby.

441
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:29,000
-Say something.
-I got it.

442
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:36,038
-This is a wedding.
-Let her finish!

443
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:37,648
Thank you. l"m sorry.

444
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:39,919
Save it for the Vietnamese.

445
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:43,485
-I love you, Bobby.
-I love you too.

446
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:53,001
When I get back,
we"re starting our own garage.

447
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:57,088
Cars, bikes,
l"m thinking maybe even trucks.

448
00:34:57,289 --> 00:34:58,642
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

449
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:04,127
That"s great!
Because between you and me...

450
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:09,481
...I had no idea
how I was gonna make a living.

451
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:13,328
-Lovely affair.
-Thanks. They need it.

452
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:15,884
No, give it to Teresa.

453
00:35:16,089 --> 00:35:19,399
-She can"t hear.
-To Teresa! l"II keep it.

454
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:21,162
-No!
-Give me that!

455
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:29,326
Thank you.
I really like the macaroni salad.

456
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:37,482
Watch this. Go!

457
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:41,127
Bev, look at Tina.

458
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:42,717
And Kevin.

459
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:52,647
She loves to dance.

460
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,641
Beautif ul.

461
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:01,882
Janet, you were great.

462
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:05,603
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Tony.

463
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:10,121
Thank you. We"re going to take
an intermission to eat.

464
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:13,646
We"II be back. Thank you very much.

465
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:18,564
You should have danced.

466
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:22,566
What"s the matter?

467
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,682
What?

468
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:28,006
My father never asked me to dance.

469
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,406
He"s embarrassed to be seen with me.

470
00:36:32,129 --> 00:36:33,403
You"re crazy.

471
00:36:34,129 --> 00:36:36,484
Nobody"s ashamed
to be seen with you.

472
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:39,567
How come no one"s come to say hi?

473
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:43,398
l"m the bride. The only person
to even look at me...

474
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:48,160
...is crazy Aunt Mildy, who"s
calling me Agnes, my dead cousin.

475
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:50,280
-Agnes!
-Hi, Mildy.

476
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:52,968
-Know what?
-I love you!

477
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:56,162
Who cares about them? Right?

478
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,927
No, I know what"s gonna happen.

479
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:04,999
When you graduate, you"II get sent
to a fancy school. l"II be alone.

480
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:08,966
With a kid.

481
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:11,478
-Let"s hear a speech.
-Good idea!

482
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,448
-Speech! Speech!
-Tony, drum roll.

483
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,048
All right!

484
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:28,885
There are times in a man"s life
when there is cause to celebrate.

485
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:33,165
-See?
-And finding f riends is easy.

486
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:37,443
But then there are times like this.

487
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:42,126
And if people are still there,
those are his real f riends.

488
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:45,206
His real family.

489
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:49,448
We all know what brought us here.

490
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:54,680
And the fact you still
saw it in your hearts to come....

491
00:37:58,449 --> 00:37:59,928
Well, you"re in my...

492
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:04,044
...my heart forever.

493
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:09,364
-Salud.
-Salud<i>!</i>

494
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:15,003
Now you can go back and eat.
And finish eating.

495
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:20,880
-Wasn"t that nice?
-Beautif ul!

496
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:23,404
-Beautif ul!
-Thanks. Sit down.

497
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:29,603
She"s not gonna sing again, is she?

498
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:33,802
Hi.

499
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:36,679
My name is Fay.

500
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:39,877
And l"m Bev"s best f riend.

501
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:43,965
I just wanted to say...

502
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:47,567
...how beautif ul Bev looks tonight.

503
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:50,761
And to wish her
all the happiness in the world.

504
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:56,125
Now that l"ve said it,
maybe one of you could say it too.

505
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:03,809
Sitting over there is a girl who
has a light around her.

506
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:05,323
It"s the chair.

507
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:09,357
When you"re near her,
something ex citing will happen.

508
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:13,484
If you think you deserve a medal
for being here...

509
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:15,566
...due to the circumstances--

510
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:19,398
-That"s enough--
-No. Wait, l"m not finished yet.

511
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:24,725
If you"re so great for being here,
don"t talk to me, either.

512
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,882
Okay?

513
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:32,600
Because l"m pregnant too.

514
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:37,448
She"s what?

515
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:39,247
-Congratulations.
-Really?

516
00:39:39,689 --> 00:39:41,600
-Did you know?
-No.

517
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:43,881
It"s an epidemic.

518
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:45,647
Go back to eating now.

519
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:47,608
Salud.

520
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:50,369
-Tony!
-Come on, put the food down.

521
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:57,128
Zippy, ask your cousin to dance.
Janet, dance with Zippy.

522
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,081
I don"t know what to say.

523
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:03,084
-Swear you"re not joking.
-I swear.

524
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,320
I found out two days ago.

525
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:08,204
I had to tell Bobby first.
Sorry.

526
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:11,765
-It"s okay.
-It"s not. There"s no ceremony.

527
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:14,767
We"re getting married
before he ships out.

528
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:18,439
My father wanted me
to live with my brother...

529
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:22,602
...and put the baby up for adoption,
but Mom said no.

530
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:24,765
That"s what"s going on.

531
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:29,397
We"re gonna be pregnant together!

532
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:33,683
And we"re both gonna have girls!

533
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:38,727
And they"re gonna be just like us!

534
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:49,400
She"s crazy.

535
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:54,440
-Keep them closed!
-All right.

536
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:57,124
-Where are we? Fay?
-No peeking.

537
00:40:57,729 --> 00:40:59,720
-l"m right here.
-You coming?

538
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:03,399
You want to come in? Bobby!

539
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,328
Fay Forrester!

540
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:07,561
l"II write f rom Vietnam!

541
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:10,647
They had to leave.
Keep going.

542
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,642
Keep them closed.

543
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:16,886
-Keep them closed.
-What are you doing?

544
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,081
Bend the knee.

545
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:23,083
-My God. All right.
-Okay.

546
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:26,085
Keep them closed.
All right.

547
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:28,166
-l"m caught.
-It"s all right.

548
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:32,487
-Where are we going?
-Don"t open them until I say.

549
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:34,481
Okay!

550
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:38,120
Okay, open your eyes!

551
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:41,679
Open your eyes, come on.

552
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:51,724
-What is it?
-What is it?

553
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:55,763
This is our place!
This is where we"re gonna live!

554
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:58,688
-How"d you do this?
-I talked to your father.

555
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:01,449
He got us public housing.

556
00:42:01,689 --> 00:42:03,042
He helped you?

557
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:08,327
Us. I think he was glad
that I came to him.

558
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:12,801
I figured you didn"t want
to be under their rules anymore.

559
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:15,842
Look. This is a great stove. Really.

560
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:19,928
It goes all the way to 550.
That"s like lava. Hot.

561
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:23,285
Close your eyes.

562
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,442
Okay.

563
00:42:27,409 --> 00:42:32,529
Very few people in my life
have treated me as good as you do.

564
00:42:32,729 --> 00:42:35,402
That has to mean
something good, right?

565
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:37,327
I don"t know.

566
00:42:39,409 --> 00:42:44,608
Tonight I have an amazing feeling,
like everything"s gonna be okay.

567
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:48,086
And...

568
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:53,880
...l"m done.

569
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:03,201
Our own home.

570
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:07,846
-Ray, this is going to be so much f un!
-It"s good, huh?

571
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:12,361
My God! I can"t believe it!
No parents! Our own house!

572
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:16,805
Last night, I fought Ray
for the last piece of chicken.

573
00:43:17,009 --> 00:43:20,046
I said, "If you don"t let go,
l"II kill you!"

574
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:22,922
l"m starting to scare myself, Fay.

575
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:26,405
It"s good Bobby"s away
because I get all the food.

576
00:43:26,649 --> 00:43:31,245
No fights. It"s a better marriage
because of it. You okay?

577
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:33,487
She"s kicking.

578
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:35,561
Mine too.

579
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:37,964
Let"s let them play together.

580
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:44,199
Beverly! Fay!

581
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:46,047
-Hi, Tina.
-Tina!

582
00:43:46,649 --> 00:43:49,038
We"re on our way to junior prom.

583
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:51,559
l"II tell you all about it.

584
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:54,044
-Bye, girls!
-You got really big.

585
00:43:54,249 --> 00:43:57,047
That was genuinely insensitive!

586
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:02,765
It"s hot, I know.
l"m doing the floor.

587
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:10,567
Where is he? He was supposed to
be here three hours ago.

588
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:16,129
-I missed my appointment.
-What"II they say that"s new?

589
00:44:17,169 --> 00:44:21,560
l"m two weeks late.
Why won"t this thing come out?!

590
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:24,357
That "thing" is very smart.

591
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:27,288
It"s not coming out
until you"re ready.

592
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:31,169
What are you doing?
You"re making a mess.

593
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:39,641
Pull. Pull.

594
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:44,245
l"II clean it up.

595
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:48,558
-You"re three hours late!
-l"m sorry.

596
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:50,282
-You"re drunk.
-No.

597
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:54,801
-You were with Lizzard!
-No! My boss.

598
00:44:56,449 --> 00:44:57,723
Bev, come on.

599
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:59,288
Bev.

600
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:01,122
What are you doing?

601
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:02,842
l"m locking him out!

602
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:06,843
Come on!
Open up or else l"Il--

603
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:10,559
What? Break it down?
You"II break your neck.

604
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:12,208
Enough of this.

605
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:15,447
-Where are you going?
-l"m not staying.

606
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:21,879
I didn"t break my neck.
Hi, Ma.

607
00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:23,801
-Hi, Raymond.
-You idiot!

608
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:28,161
We can"t afford a crib,
and you broke the window!

609
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:31,600
What am I supposed to do?
Tell my boss that--

610
00:45:31,889 --> 00:45:33,481
Oh, Raymond.

611
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:35,925
You"re bleeding.

612
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:37,683
l"m bleeding!

613
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:42,444
You"re getting it on the floor.
And on the wall!

614
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:44,640
-Stop bleeding!
-l"m trying!

615
00:45:44,929 --> 00:45:47,397
-Stop bleeding!
-Shut up.

616
00:45:47,729 --> 00:45:50,289
Start moving.
Come on!

617
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:54,641
Get some peroxide and toilet paper.
Hurry up!

618
00:45:54,849 --> 00:45:57,158
-Is there glass in there?
-No!

619
00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:00,566
Waddle <i>q</i>uicker!
He"s bleeding to death!

620
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:02,442
Hold it tight.

621
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:06,964
It was my boss.
I had to go.

622
00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:09,001
Raymond?
Look at me.

623
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:12,208
You"re the man of this house.

624
00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:17,364
Bring home the bacon.
If you say you"II be here, be here!

625
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:19,725
-No lying, no drinking!
-Mom!

626
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:22,204
-What?
-Help!

627
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:24,127
Help! Come on!

628
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,004
What?

629
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:31,120
What"s happening?

630
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:35,402
Oh, Bev.

631
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:39,765
-Your water broke.
-What?

632
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:43,602
Is that supposed to happen?

633
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:48,203
-l"m so ex cited.
-This is so gross.

634
00:46:57,249 --> 00:47:01,037
Hello, beautif ul.
Hello, beautif ul baby.

635
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:05,248
Is this the most
beautif ul baby you"ve ever seen?

636
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:10,121
l"m serious. Is this the most
beautif ul baby you"ve seen?

637
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:13,208
Well, to be honest, yeah.

638
00:47:14,049 --> 00:47:17,359
Let"s go see Bev.
She wants to see you.

639
00:47:17,729 --> 00:47:19,606
Come on, it"II be f un.

640
00:47:20,209 --> 00:47:24,646
Mommy"s 15, Daddy"s a moron,
and they want us to celebrate.

641
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,157
We know better.

642
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:28,917
l"II be back later.
Come on, Leo.

643
00:47:29,169 --> 00:47:31,967
For the record,
l"m on your side.

644
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:49,363
Mr. and Mrs. Hasek,
I have your baby.

645
00:47:49,729 --> 00:47:52,368
Hey, can you wait one second?

646
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:56,083
Hey, Bev.

647
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:02,123
l"m sorry I broke your water.

648
00:48:02,649 --> 00:48:05,880
Nothing like that
will ever happen again.

649
00:48:06,169 --> 00:48:10,447
No more drinking.
No more forgetting.

650
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:13,647
l"m gonna be good, okay?

651
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:17,763
I love you so much.

652
00:48:32,729 --> 00:48:37,041
This is one of the most beautif ul
baby boys l"ve ever seen.

653
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:40,008
I didn"t have a boy,
I had a girl.

654
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:43,406
No, we had a boy.
Don"t you remember?

655
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:48,403
I told Fay we"d both have girls...

656
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:51,482
...and they"d be just like us.

657
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:54,278
No, we had a boy.

658
00:48:54,649 --> 00:48:58,119
He"s going to grow up
and be just like me.

659
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:02,487
Try feeding him for a little while.

660
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:05,881
l"II be back in 20 minutes.

661
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:09,367
l"II try.

662
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:17,201
It"s a boy.

663
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:23,239
-It sure is.
-It"s a boy.

664
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:28,561
No!

665
00:49:34,169 --> 00:49:37,400
Hydrogen, helium,
lithium, beryllium....

666
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:40,561
We"re gonna get a good one.
Ready?

667
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:43,283
Hold that! Ready?
Click.

668
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:47,404
Jason and Amelia,
sitting in a tree...

669
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:51,924
...while Bev is getting
her high school degree.

670
00:49:59,689 --> 00:50:01,361
l"m trying to study.

671
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:05,325
Ten more minutes.
Be <i>q</i>uiet for a minute.

672
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:07,128
Jason, God!

673
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:09,320
Can"t he hit the bowl?

674
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:16,086
You"re distracting me.

675
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:18,643
Ma!

676
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:23,247
-What?
-Jason won"t leave me alone!

677
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:25,565
You"re his mother.

678
00:50:26,049 --> 00:50:30,327
I got four weeks to study
for the SAT, for the scholarship.

679
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:34,285
I know you"re smart,
and you have dreams.

680
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:36,161
But you need a job.

681
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:39,167
This one pays for living expenses.

682
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:45,723
I told you to change his diaper
an hour ago.

683
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:48,359
He loves when you do it.

684
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,963
-I have to iron now.
-Ma!

685
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,398
Change it!

686
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,761
Mommy has to study.

687
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:59,757
l"m doing everything I can
to get us out of here.

688
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,805
Mr. Stinky Pants.

689
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,282
What happened?

690
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:09,008
What?!

691
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:11,761
What happened?

692
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:14,326
He peed in my mouth!

693
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:22,801
Come here, Jason.

694
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:24,926
Come on, big boy.

695
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:28,999
Jason, God bless you.

696
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:34,164
You make your grandma so happy.
Mommy pee-pee mouth.

697
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:39,007
-l"II get this one.
-What do I do?

698
00:51:40,769 --> 00:51:42,839
Let"s throw some more.

699
00:51:43,129 --> 00:51:44,244
Check it out.

700
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:49,719
-I don"t have any rocks.
-You don"t need rocks after this.

701
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:54,204
Yeah! All right!

702
00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:58,004
You okay?
How long you been sick?

703
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:00,367
About ten--

704
00:52:05,049 --> 00:52:07,927
Hey, Al, l"m done for the day.

705
00:52:09,049 --> 00:52:10,562
All right, man.

706
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:13,647
-See you tomorrow.
-On time, okay?

707
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:28,560
-I see it.
-That"s because we screwed up.

708
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:31,081
I said to him:

709
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,887
"B-O-B-B-Y...

710
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:39,000
...if you re-enlist,
I want a D-l-V-O-R-C-E."

711
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:43,007
I got the guts to say it.

712
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:44,927
Know what he said?

713
00:52:47,129 --> 00:52:48,562
He wanted one too.

714
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:54,169
Sorry to bother you with this.

715
00:52:54,449 --> 00:52:56,724
Mom, we"re stuck.

716
00:52:57,089 --> 00:52:59,603
He"s met some girl named Monsoon.

717
00:53:00,249 --> 00:53:03,127
l"m here, taking care of our kid...

718
00:53:03,409 --> 00:53:06,845
...he"s on some beach,
falling in love with Monsoon.

719
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:09,404
What kind of name is Monsoon?

720
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:11,879
-Good.
-That"s good?

721
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:14,284
We know Bobby"s not coming back.

722
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:19,120
-What"re you gonna do with your life?
-I don"t know.

723
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,557
Mommy!

724
00:53:22,049 --> 00:53:25,883
Fay has bigger problems right now.
Be considerate.

725
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:28,563
What am I gonna do?

726
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:31,887
You"re a great artist.
Do something with that.

727
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:35,399
-Like what?
-Like me and my scholarship.

728
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:39,398
-l"m not as smart as you.
-l"II help you.

729
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:43,918
-Just you and me.
-It"s always you and me.

730
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:49,208
Yeah!

731
00:53:51,249 --> 00:53:54,047
I can wear it and return it.

732
00:54:00,729 --> 00:54:02,606
Can you finish me up?

733
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:06,323
Perf ume.

734
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:10,240
Ready, go.

735
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:12,360
Okay, put it down.

736
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:22,282
Come on.

737
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:28,358
-How do I look?
-You look beautif ul, Mommy.

738
00:54:29,209 --> 00:54:31,769
No, say that I look smart.

739
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,122
You look smart, Mommy.
You do.

740
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:36,762
Thank you.

741
00:54:37,049 --> 00:54:39,768
l"m going to drop you off
with Daddy.

742
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,446
And then Mommy...

743
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:47,448
...is gonna do something to change
the rest of our lives!

744
00:54:49,089 --> 00:54:50,647
Let"s go!

745
00:54:53,649 --> 00:54:57,688
Stay with Daddy.
Later, we"II have a celebration.

746
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:02,442
-Al, where"s Ray?
-You tell me.

747
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:05,083
He didn"t show up for work.

748
00:55:05,689 --> 00:55:08,078
He comes and goes as he pleases.

749
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:10,919
I can"t believe this!

750
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:14,326
-I want to stay with Daddy.
-He"s not here.

751
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:17,845
You have to come with me.
Get in the cab.

752
00:55:18,169 --> 00:55:20,922
-I want to play.
-You"II play later.

753
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:23,723
-I want to play.
-It won"t take long.

754
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:27,400
Ex cuse me, where is
the interview room?

755
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:30,328
Sorry.

756
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:34,883
I called you for two reasons.

757
00:55:35,089 --> 00:55:39,401
One is to meet the girl
who wrote such a tremendous essay.

758
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:44,360
The other is to compliment you
on your strong effort.

759
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:48,878
It"s down to seven girls.
You should be proud.

760
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,004
Thank you.

761
00:55:51,249 --> 00:55:55,083
If you pick me,
I will not let you down.

762
00:55:55,409 --> 00:55:58,003
l"II be everything you"re looking for.

763
00:56:04,849 --> 00:56:06,805
What l"m getting at...

764
00:56:07,649 --> 00:56:12,359
...is we want to be very sure
that the person we give this to...

765
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:16,039
...will not only graduate,
but go to grad school...

766
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:18,319
...and not be someone who"II be....

767
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:22,288
Distracted?

768
00:56:23,009 --> 00:56:24,567
-Yes.
-Not me.

769
00:56:24,809 --> 00:56:29,644
If you give me the scholarship,
it"s like giving me my master"s.

770
00:56:29,849 --> 00:56:32,204
Nothing gets in my way.

771
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:41,042
You probably need to get going.

772
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,407
We"II call when we know.

773
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,400
When will you know?

774
00:56:48,729 --> 00:56:50,640
Two weeks.

775
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:53,998
Nice meeting you, Mrs. Hasek.

776
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:59,883
Don"t make me go crazy for two weeks.
This means so much to me.

777
00:57:00,249 --> 00:57:01,318
Mr. Price...

778
00:57:03,409 --> 00:57:05,684
...l"m not gonna get this, am I?

779
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:10,801
l"m sorry, no.

780
00:57:11,169 --> 00:57:13,080
N-O. No.

781
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:28,362
Daddy!

782
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:33,803
-Hey, big guy.
-Come say hello to Uncle Lizzard.

783
00:57:34,849 --> 00:57:37,158
Look at you. Magazine.

784
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:42,601
Why do I look like this today?

785
00:57:43,289 --> 00:57:46,361
Why do I look nice today?

786
00:57:48,409 --> 00:57:51,924
The most important day of my life?

787
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:57,037
Yeah.

788
00:57:58,289 --> 00:58:00,359
Bev, l"m sorry.

789
00:58:00,649 --> 00:58:02,844
No, not sorry.
Where were you?

790
00:58:03,089 --> 00:58:06,320
-I was, I was at--
-No. Where were you?

791
00:58:07,409 --> 00:58:09,764
-I had--
-No.

792
00:58:11,169 --> 00:58:13,125
Where were you?

793
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:20,604
-Say something.
-You can"t hide behind Jason.

794
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:23,966
-Yes, he can.
-I am invisible.

795
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:28,760
-Help me out, boy.
-Hiding behind Jason won"t work.

796
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:34,847
Answer me.

797
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:41,085
I forgot.

798
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:45,322
You forgot?

799
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:49,799
You forgot?
You forgot?!

800
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,003
Haven"t you had a dream?

801
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:56,289
-Yeah.
-Shut up, Lizzard!

802
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:04,446
I woke up this morning,
truly believing...

803
00:59:04,729 --> 00:59:09,007
...that by this afternoon,
my life would be different.

804
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:14,643
Not only because it was my dream,
but because l"d earned it.

805
00:59:14,929 --> 00:59:17,204
And now look at me.

806
00:59:18,169 --> 00:59:22,640
It"s 4:00 in the afternoon,
and l"m just another housewife...

807
00:59:23,009 --> 00:59:27,321
...yelling at her husband
in f ront of the neighbors.

808
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:30,278
Yeah, that"s me!

809
00:59:30,929 --> 00:59:33,568
Wonderf ul!
Thank you, Ray!

810
00:59:35,929 --> 00:59:37,806
You look smart, Mom.

811
00:59:39,129 --> 00:59:42,007
You do.
You look really smart.

812
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,240
Come on, Bev.

813
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:48,398
The whole college thing,
it"II work out.

814
00:59:50,289 --> 00:59:52,359
No, it won"t.

815
00:59:56,089 --> 00:59:57,807
And l"II adjust.

816
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:06,161
Should I have left?

817
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:13,126
I can"t do anything right!

818
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:15,240
You better clean that up!

819
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:24,080
/t<i>'</i>s family legend
and a huge deal in her book...

820
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:26,723
... the day she didn<i>'</i>t get
her scholarship.

821
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,558
<i>T</i>o me it<i>'</i>s not about <i>R</i>ay<i>'</i>s mistake.

822
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:32,118
/t<i>'</i>s about ho<i>w</i> my mere presence...

823
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:35,605
...forever crushed
all my mother<i>'</i>s dreams.

824
01:00:37,729 --> 01:00:41,483
Is this a comfortable silence for you?

825
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:44,202
Yes.

826
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:54,645
Are we gonna do this all day?
You not telling me what"s wrong.

827
01:00:59,609 --> 01:01:02,328
Okay, l"II tell you.

828
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:04,999
But promise not to go crazy.

829
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,762
I won"t go crazy.

830
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:16,084
I think I should transfer schools.

831
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:20,084
Instead of NYU,
I think Indiana might be nice.

832
01:01:21,889 --> 01:01:24,039
-No.
-Let me finish! l"ve--

833
01:01:24,569 --> 01:01:27,606
I don"t want to hear it.
The answer is no.

834
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,118
Two years and you"re finished.

835
01:01:31,129 --> 01:01:35,964
You"II be a college graduate.
You"II have the life I dreamed of.

836
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,681
Vic, these are for Mimi.

837
01:01:42,009 --> 01:01:43,442
Hi, Bev.

838
01:01:43,809 --> 01:01:46,642
We"d like 17 delux e
Delite burgers, please.

839
01:01:47,009 --> 01:01:49,477
No, make that twenty Delite f ries.

840
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:52,846
And 20 Delite cones.

841
01:01:55,409 --> 01:01:57,877
Eleven dollars.
Twenty f ries.

842
01:01:58,129 --> 01:02:01,360
Looks like Bev finally found
a job that suits her.

843
01:02:07,609 --> 01:02:08,564
They"re ready.

844
01:02:10,049 --> 01:02:12,244
Ready? Here you go.

845
01:02:13,569 --> 01:02:16,367
Hit it right there.
Hit the chief.

846
01:02:19,729 --> 01:02:21,003
Right here.

847
01:02:24,129 --> 01:02:27,963
Please, thank you.
No yelling.

848
01:02:29,569 --> 01:02:33,482
And smile, okay?
Even if she is a real bitch.

849
01:02:35,009 --> 01:02:38,160
Mrs. Forrester.
Nice to see you.

850
01:02:39,969 --> 01:02:41,482
Is Fay home?

851
01:02:42,649 --> 01:02:46,437
I swear, I haven"t smiled in a month.

852
01:02:47,449 --> 01:02:51,078
Your mom taking the kids
to the movies is great.

853
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:52,563
Shut the door.

854
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:57,680
Play nice, kids.

855
01:03:01,329 --> 01:03:04,878
-What are these?
-Ray gave me two of them.

856
01:03:05,169 --> 01:03:08,081
What are they?
I don"t want to see my skull.

857
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:12,120
Ray always wants me
to take them with him.

858
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:16,760
He says they"re great to take
with someone you love and trust.

859
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:28,640
-Fay?
-Yeah.

860
01:03:28,849 --> 01:03:33,969
-Do you love Amelia?
-Oh, man, don"t get heavy on me now.

861
01:03:34,169 --> 01:03:35,602
It"s a real <i>q</i>uestion.

862
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:39,964
-We didn"t pick this.
-Because we got knocked up?

863
01:03:41,649 --> 01:03:47,599
-Romance took a strange turn for us.
-Yeah, we got knocked up.

864
01:03:50,449 --> 01:03:54,328
I want to thank your mom.
Mrs. Forrester....

865
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:59,643
l"d love to forgive each other for
whatever keeps us f rom being close.

866
01:04:00,209 --> 01:04:03,087
You"ve probably said
awf ul things about me.

867
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:07,243
And you probably heard me
call you "ice crotch."

868
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:11,437
-I thought you hated me.
-Amelia.

869
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:17,645
-l"m taking Amelia to the movies.
-What about Jason?

870
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:20,283
His mommy is leaving soon.

871
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:24,277
I wouldn"t want her to leave
without him. Let"s go.

872
01:04:25,049 --> 01:04:26,641
Bye, sweetie.

873
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:31,087
-She loved hearing that.
-It just fell out of my mouth.

874
01:04:34,769 --> 01:04:39,604
-Go inside and watch TV.
-I want to stay here with you.

875
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:44,644
l"m having a hard time with you here,
and I need to talk to Fay.

876
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:48,841
-Go.
-I don"t have anything to do.

877
01:04:49,329 --> 01:04:52,799
Well, use your imagination!

878
01:04:56,209 --> 01:04:57,483
Go.

879
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:08,004
So?

880
01:05:08,369 --> 01:05:11,247
So? What was the <i>q</i>uestion?

881
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:12,918
Do you love Amelia?

882
01:05:13,969 --> 01:05:16,961
Yes, I love her.
And you love Jason.

883
01:05:17,649 --> 01:05:20,402
-Right?
-Yeah, I love him, but....

884
01:05:20,729 --> 01:05:22,367
You love him but what?

885
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:28,885
I don"t know if I really love him
or I have to love him.

886
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:35,246
And it scares me to death.

887
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:43,566
Good people don"t think this way.

888
01:05:47,409 --> 01:05:50,446
-What"s wrong with me?
-Bev?

889
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:53,161
Take my word on this.

890
01:05:55,209 --> 01:05:57,643
You really do love him.

891
01:05:58,129 --> 01:06:02,964
Sometimes we love people so much,
we have to be numb to it.

892
01:06:04,729 --> 01:06:08,085
If we actually felt how much,
it would kill us.

893
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:19,727
That doesn"t make you a bad person.
It means your heart"s too big.

894
01:06:26,129 --> 01:06:28,199
Good way to look at it.

895
01:06:29,849 --> 01:06:31,282
Mom, help!

896
01:06:34,809 --> 01:06:37,482
Stay calm, stay calm.
Don"t panic.

897
01:06:42,769 --> 01:06:45,602
-Get over here.
-Got him?

898
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:48,528
Don"t pull him out yet.
He"II f reeze.

899
01:06:48,729 --> 01:06:51,402
-l"m sorry.
-l"II get towels.

900
01:06:51,649 --> 01:06:56,962
This shouldn"t have happened.
From now on, l"II be more attentive.

901
01:06:57,289 --> 01:06:59,598
-Do you know what that means?
-No.

902
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:03,085
Responsible.
You know what responsible means?

903
01:07:03,409 --> 01:07:04,558
No.

904
01:07:05,169 --> 01:07:07,683
I should have read to you more!

905
01:07:07,889 --> 01:07:09,481
No! Come here!

906
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:12,640
l"m so sorry!

907
01:07:15,929 --> 01:07:19,399
-l"m a terrible mother.
-Yeah.

908
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:36,197
Scoot.

909
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:38,444
Jason.

910
01:07:40,569 --> 01:07:41,797
I love you.

911
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:45,317
Okay?

912
01:07:49,009 --> 01:07:51,603
They"re playing kickball.

913
01:07:52,209 --> 01:07:53,961
Go play with them.

914
01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:57,645
Adults inside, kids outside.

915
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:11,284
That"s $20! You know how
much you can buy with that?

916
01:08:12,809 --> 01:08:16,085
My parents always
bought stuff I hated.

917
01:08:16,369 --> 01:08:18,644
The card is the real present.

918
01:08:19,089 --> 01:08:23,241
I got carried away,
but it"s a plan for your life.

919
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:25,327
Here, l"II read it to you.

920
01:08:26,289 --> 01:08:28,041
-"Dearest Jason--"
-Mom?

921
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:36,680
We"II catch up later.
Are you ready to go have f un?

922
01:08:38,329 --> 01:08:39,648
Okay, good.

923
01:08:43,129 --> 01:08:44,403
Go have f un.

924
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:46,799
Everybody, come in.

925
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:49,442
Hi, Amelia.

926
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:52,840
Davy, I got your stuff.
Get it later.

927
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:57,808
-The card was the present?
-It"s a plan for my life.

928
01:08:58,129 --> 01:09:00,962
-She"s crazy!
-You guys be caref ul.

929
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:06,362
What?

930
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:11,601
Minimum wage is what,
one-sixty an hour?

931
01:09:11,889 --> 01:09:15,404
l"II pay $160,
just to use your oven.

932
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:20,885
I don"t think my parents will let you
use their oven to dry weed.

933
01:09:25,849 --> 01:09:28,568
-Oh, Bev.
-I made it for him.

934
01:09:28,769 --> 01:09:29,997
You did a great job.

935
01:09:30,649 --> 01:09:33,368
You stayed up all night?
It looks delicious.

936
01:09:33,929 --> 01:09:35,078
You hog!

937
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:41,843
Get me another beer.

938
01:09:42,049 --> 01:09:44,563
-l"m way ahead of you.
-Make it two.

939
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:51,608
Bev?

940
01:09:55,409 --> 01:09:58,162
Don"t tell me you don"t remember me.

941
01:10:01,689 --> 01:10:05,807
Braces, short curly hair, pimples.

942
01:10:06,329 --> 01:10:08,285
Tommy?

943
01:10:10,649 --> 01:10:11,923
Wow.

944
01:10:15,129 --> 01:10:17,962
-So I graduated f rom Berkeley.
-Berkeley?

945
01:10:18,169 --> 01:10:21,718
Spent the year driving around,
seeing everything.

946
01:10:22,809 --> 01:10:27,087
In a few days l"m heading back
to California to get my master"s.

947
01:10:27,409 --> 01:10:29,843
But I wanted to see you first.

948
01:10:30,089 --> 01:10:32,364
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah.

949
01:10:32,609 --> 01:10:34,440
Just to say hi.

950
01:10:35,889 --> 01:10:37,641
-Hi.
-Hi.

951
01:10:39,329 --> 01:10:41,843
-Bev! Hey, Bev!
-Ex cuse me.

952
01:10:43,089 --> 01:10:45,159
-Tina!
-Bev.

953
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:47,288
You actually came!

954
01:10:47,489 --> 01:10:49,798
-l"m so glad.
-Of course I came.

955
01:10:50,809 --> 01:10:54,563
-This is f rom Joey.
-Joey.

956
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:57,682
Joe got you something?

957
01:10:58,009 --> 01:10:59,283
Thanks, Joe.

958
01:11:02,089 --> 01:11:05,479
-That"s outside. Outside toy.
-Stop.

959
01:11:05,729 --> 01:11:10,325
-Come in and say hi.
-I can"t. Kevin"s waiting by the car.

960
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:13,403
This is fiberglass.

961
01:11:14,049 --> 01:11:16,199
I just came to say goodbye.

962
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:19,765
-What do you mean?
-Kevin and I are engaged.

963
01:11:20,369 --> 01:11:22,644
-You"re pregnant.
-No.

964
01:11:22,849 --> 01:11:27,365
Kevin"s been in school in New York.
He can"t stand being away f rom me.

965
01:11:27,609 --> 01:11:31,966
I wanted to tell you before
you heard it. l"m going to college.

966
01:11:33,449 --> 01:11:38,045
Kevin"s father got me into
that real good college in New York.

967
01:11:38,369 --> 01:11:40,883
-NYU?
-Yeah.

968
01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:46,046
-You"re going to NYU?
-Yeah.

969
01:11:46,249 --> 01:11:49,798
Holy shit. It"s Jackie O.
Come here!

970
01:11:50,089 --> 01:11:52,000
Fay, the divorcée!

971
01:11:52,209 --> 01:11:56,168
This is the only thing
my father ever gave me.

972
01:11:57,329 --> 01:12:00,480
It"s supposed to be lucky,
but it wasn"t for him.

973
01:12:00,729 --> 01:12:04,802
And it hasn"t been for me.
Maybe it"II be lucky for you.

974
01:12:05,009 --> 01:12:06,283
Maybe it"s stupid.

975
01:12:07,729 --> 01:12:08,957
I couldn"t wrap it.

976
01:12:09,169 --> 01:12:14,038
They"re not stupid. They"re great!
I love your guts, Dad!

977
01:12:14,249 --> 01:12:16,683
I love your guts too, buddy.

978
01:12:18,249 --> 01:12:22,037
Bye! I love you guys!
l"II call, okay? I swear!

979
01:12:22,249 --> 01:12:24,479
-Bye, girls!
-Bye!

980
01:12:24,729 --> 01:12:27,289
Come visit me in New York, okay?

981
01:12:44,689 --> 01:12:45,883
Hey.

982
01:12:48,849 --> 01:12:50,407
Sorry.

983
01:12:51,089 --> 01:12:52,807
Did I scare you?

984
01:12:53,449 --> 01:12:55,246
No.

985
01:12:56,129 --> 01:12:58,085
What are you doing here?

986
01:12:58,289 --> 01:13:01,122
I wanted to see if you were okay.

987
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:03,608
You okay?

988
01:13:09,449 --> 01:13:11,167
Wanna go for a walk?

989
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:19,005
-Maybe just around the....
-Good. Come on.

990
01:13:26,809 --> 01:13:29,607
Tell me what you"re thinking
right now.

991
01:13:29,969 --> 01:13:33,928
l"m 22 years old.
That"s almost 30.

992
01:13:34,129 --> 01:13:37,485
I still haven"t accepted
that this is my life.

993
01:13:38,769 --> 01:13:43,126
I wish I could be dumb
and then I wouldn"t know better.

994
01:13:43,569 --> 01:13:48,006
And I could be happy
and stop hoping.

995
01:13:48,209 --> 01:13:53,283
And l"m telling you this like
you"re interested in my boring life.

996
01:13:54,249 --> 01:13:57,480
Come to California with me.
l"ve got room.

997
01:13:57,809 --> 01:13:59,959
I could take all of you.

998
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:03,844
If you want to change your life,
you can.

999
01:14:04,049 --> 01:14:06,358
If money"s tight,
it doesn"t matter.

1000
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:09,487
You"ve always been smart.
It"s easy.

1001
01:14:09,849 --> 01:14:12,647
-You want to go to college?
-Yes.

1002
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:14,282
The state pays.

1003
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:17,640
The state pays, Bev.

1004
01:14:23,929 --> 01:14:28,559
-Ray won"t go for it.
-lf Ray loves you, he"II do it.

1005
01:14:29,809 --> 01:14:31,367
Right?

1006
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:38,881
Just do whatever it takes to get
out of here. You don"t belong here.

1007
01:14:40,489 --> 01:14:41,968
You don"t.

1008
01:14:54,769 --> 01:14:58,444
Thank you for saying
the things you said tonight.

1009
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,922
It"s just good to see you smile.

1010
01:15:03,889 --> 01:15:05,481
-Mom!
-Yes!

1011
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:07,759
I woke up and you were gone!

1012
01:15:07,969 --> 01:15:11,086
She"s not supposed
to leave a kid alone!

1013
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:14,759
It"s dangerous!
I could have choked!

1014
01:15:17,009 --> 01:15:19,079
l"II talk to Ray.

1015
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:24,041
Just let me know.
My classes start up.

1016
01:15:24,689 --> 01:15:28,045
Good night, Bev.
Good night, Jason.

1017
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:34,202
What do you think
about California?

1018
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:35,842
/ told you to stop it.

1019
01:15:39,049 --> 01:15:41,005
Well, I just....

1020
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:49,125
Wanna go to California?

1021
01:15:49,329 --> 01:15:52,048
I wanna go if you wanna go.

1022
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:03,923
-All right. Let"s go to California.
-Yes, Ray!

1023
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:09,160
-Thank you, Ray! Thank you!
-Yeah.

1024
01:16:10,449 --> 01:16:13,919
Don"t forget to get
baby aspirin for Jason.

1025
01:16:14,129 --> 01:16:16,802
Baby aspirin, okay.

1026
01:16:17,009 --> 01:16:22,606
-l"II finish packing.
-Yeah, baby aspirin.

1027
01:16:22,969 --> 01:16:27,087
-You guys seen Lizzard?
-No, sorry.

1028
01:16:30,849 --> 01:16:35,286
-Hello?
<i>-y</i> ou better get over here. /t<i>'</i>s <i>R</i>ay.

1029
01:16:42,449 --> 01:16:45,009
Okay, up the stairs. Up.

1030
01:16:51,169 --> 01:16:54,161
-Where"s Ray?
-l"m sorry about California.

1031
01:16:55,369 --> 01:16:58,247
-What--?
-He"s downstairs with your father.

1032
01:16:58,449 --> 01:17:00,679
-What"s going on?
-Don"t know.

1033
01:17:00,889 --> 01:17:03,562
Why don"t you sit here?
Come on.

1034
01:17:03,769 --> 01:17:05,327
Get your jacket off.

1035
01:17:05,609 --> 01:17:07,361
-Say it.
-All right.

1036
01:17:07,609 --> 01:17:09,008
Okay.

1037
01:17:14,969 --> 01:17:18,803
-Jason, how"s it going over there?
-Trouble.

1038
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:22,361
Your husband has come to me
with a problem.

1039
01:17:22,769 --> 01:17:24,805
And he wants my help.

1040
01:17:27,969 --> 01:17:29,482
Raymond?

1041
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,839
Hey, Bev, how"s it going?

1042
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:41,481
Okay.

1043
01:17:42,969 --> 01:17:44,607
I got a....

1044
01:17:46,289 --> 01:17:48,644
I can"t do it without a....

1045
01:17:50,129 --> 01:17:51,960
"Dear Beverly.

1046
01:17:52,569 --> 01:17:55,242
Please don"t go crazy
when you hear this.

1047
01:17:55,569 --> 01:18:01,087
But I regret to inform you
that I am...

1048
01:18:02,049 --> 01:18:03,926
...a junkie.

1049
01:18:04,329 --> 01:18:09,278
I spent all our money on heroin.
I spent everything.

1050
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:12,128
I even spent the money...

1051
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:15,883
...for Jason"s aspirin on a fix."

1052
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:20,083
It was just a tiny fix.

1053
01:18:21,809 --> 01:18:25,768
-But I spent that too.
-Heroin?

1054
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:30,444
I knew you drank a lot,
but heroin?

1055
01:18:30,809 --> 01:18:33,084
Jesus, Ray!

1056
01:18:35,889 --> 01:18:37,322
For how long?

1057
01:18:38,929 --> 01:18:40,999
-I don"t know.
-No....

1058
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:45,319
-How long?
-Two years, October 31 .

1059
01:18:46,969 --> 01:18:48,925
Halloween night.

1060
01:18:49,129 --> 01:18:51,802
Remember when Jason
was a monkey?

1061
01:18:52,209 --> 01:18:54,803
-Stop listening!
-You"ve been sick.

1062
01:18:55,009 --> 01:18:59,002
-l"m clearing up.
-I feel so stupid for not knowing!

1063
01:18:59,209 --> 01:19:01,006
Bev, l"m really sorry.

1064
01:19:01,449 --> 01:19:05,727
Shut up. Don"t say sorry.
Sorry doesn"t mean anything.

1065
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,207
-Stop.
-No! This is the last time.

1066
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:12,687
You"re not helping.
You don"t pay attention!

1067
01:19:12,889 --> 01:19:17,167
Listen. Everything l"m doing
right now is for that boy.

1068
01:19:17,809 --> 01:19:20,607
He needs a father.
This is his father.

1069
01:19:21,049 --> 01:19:24,724
I didn"t pick him.
He"II be sick for a while.

1070
01:19:24,929 --> 01:19:29,127
Your mother and I will take Jason
while you help him. Got it?

1071
01:19:29,329 --> 01:19:33,561
I don"t want your help.
I can take care of my own kid.

1072
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:45,163
Okay, Ray, I cleaned you a new one.
Okay?

1073
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,127
You feel better?

1074
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:51,401
You going to throw up again?
Here, Ray.

1075
01:19:51,649 --> 01:19:55,119
Here, Ray. Here.
Oh, no!

1076
01:19:56,849 --> 01:19:59,727
This is so gross.

1077
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:02,397
Oh, my God!
Please kill me!

1078
01:20:02,649 --> 01:20:06,562
Fine! Stop screaming.
You"re gonna scare Jason.

1079
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:09,920
Oh, my God. Bev!

1080
01:20:10,129 --> 01:20:13,758
-l"II get more sheets.
-Bev, please! Help me!

1081
01:20:13,969 --> 01:20:16,199
Is Dad okay?

1082
01:20:16,689 --> 01:20:21,319
-What"s your favorite song?
-"Cincinnati Dancing Pig."

1083
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:05,319
Scoot over.

1084
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:09,719
I need to rest between rounds.

1085
01:21:13,049 --> 01:21:16,837
Sorry you didn"t get to
go to California.

1086
01:21:17,049 --> 01:21:21,964
Please turn off the pig song!
It"s not helping much.

1087
01:21:24,329 --> 01:21:26,797
Turn off that song!

1088
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:38,767
-What are you doing?
-Making you breakfast.

1089
01:21:38,969 --> 01:21:40,368
Thank you.

1090
01:21:40,569 --> 01:21:44,448
-Why are you whispering?
-I don"t wanna wake your dad.

1091
01:21:44,689 --> 01:21:47,157
He"s not here.
He left.

1092
01:21:52,649 --> 01:21:55,243
Ray?

1093
01:22:15,129 --> 01:22:16,562
Hey.

1094
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:21,681
Bev? Let me just....

1095
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:26,044
Jason"s in his room.
He can hear us.

1096
01:22:26,369 --> 01:22:28,485
All right, Bev. Look....

1097
01:22:28,689 --> 01:22:30,600
Look at me.

1098
01:22:31,889 --> 01:22:33,322
What?

1099
01:22:38,009 --> 01:22:41,001
Don"t say you"re sorry.

1100
01:22:41,889 --> 01:22:43,402
-Just go.
-No!

1101
01:22:43,649 --> 01:22:47,801
I know what you"re thinking.
l"ve got it figured out.

1102
01:22:48,009 --> 01:22:49,840
All right? Look.

1103
01:22:51,649 --> 01:22:54,766
I just can"t <i>q</i>uit, okay?

1104
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:58,564
You can"t hold it against me
if it"s impossible.

1105
01:22:58,769 --> 01:23:01,886
It"s just who I am.
All right?

1106
01:23:02,089 --> 01:23:07,607
All I need is a little, to keep me
straight. Not enough to get me high.

1107
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:12,127
Just enough to keep me straight.
Just like this.

1108
01:23:15,809 --> 01:23:18,118
So, what if we keep it at that?

1109
01:23:18,689 --> 01:23:23,080
You want permission to use
a small amount of heroin forever?

1110
01:23:24,969 --> 01:23:26,004
Okay.

1111
01:23:26,369 --> 01:23:28,724
I am gonna get a good job.

1112
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:31,683
-And, one, look--
-No.

1113
01:23:31,889 --> 01:23:33,163
What?

1114
01:23:35,329 --> 01:23:36,557
No.

1115
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:39,682
Bev, come on.

1116
01:23:43,009 --> 01:23:45,318
This plan works!

1117
01:23:45,569 --> 01:23:47,002
Ray.

1118
01:23:50,849 --> 01:23:55,127
-You need to think like a grown-up now.
-All right.

1119
01:23:55,929 --> 01:24:01,640
Like a 40-year-old businessman
who takes a train to work every day...

1120
01:24:01,849 --> 01:24:04,727
...and makes responsible decisions.

1121
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:08,203
-Can you do that?
-Yeah. l"II try.

1122
01:24:08,569 --> 01:24:11,288
You say it"s impossible to <i>q</i>uit.

1123
01:24:11,489 --> 01:24:16,847
I believe you.
I won"t even hold it against you.

1124
01:24:17,089 --> 01:24:20,525
But if you stay
and you ruin our lives...

1125
01:24:20,729 --> 01:24:22,959
...and you know that you will...

1126
01:24:25,409 --> 01:24:27,798
...then it"s my fault.

1127
01:24:31,009 --> 01:24:33,648
Do you want me to live with that?

1128
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:42,440
No.

1129
01:24:53,129 --> 01:24:54,118
Hey, Dad.

1130
01:24:55,329 --> 01:24:58,958
-Guess what?
-What?

1131
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:01,806
I lost my tooth.

1132
01:25:03,489 --> 01:25:05,002
See?

1133
01:25:17,729 --> 01:25:19,082
Well.

1134
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:24,958
-I just came in to say good night.
-Good night, Dad.

1135
01:25:31,489 --> 01:25:34,879
-I love your guts, buddy.
-I love you.

1136
01:25:35,649 --> 01:25:38,447
Dad, are you going somewhere?

1137
01:25:43,689 --> 01:25:45,407
Can I come?

1138
01:25:47,649 --> 01:25:49,207
Why can"t I come?

1139
01:25:49,849 --> 01:25:51,726
Because your mom...

1140
01:25:51,969 --> 01:25:57,248
...doesn"t think it"s a good idea
if we"re around each other any more.

1141
01:25:57,809 --> 01:25:59,845
l"m not supposed to say that.

1142
01:26:09,729 --> 01:26:12,687
You"re gonna hear
a lot of bad things about me.

1143
01:26:13,409 --> 01:26:15,001
Okay?

1144
01:26:15,329 --> 01:26:19,447
But only two out of the three things
are gonna be right.

1145
01:26:19,649 --> 01:26:25,485
So when you hear something
that"s really, really bad...

1146
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:31,247
...you try to think that"s
the one time they"re wrong, okay?

1147
01:26:32,129 --> 01:26:34,120
Okay.

1148
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:36,887
All right?

1149
01:26:37,089 --> 01:26:40,877
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you too.

1150
01:26:41,089 --> 01:26:42,920
All right, buddy?

1151
01:26:45,609 --> 01:26:46,962
Okay, I gotta go.

1152
01:26:51,329 --> 01:26:52,808
I gotta go!

1153
01:26:53,489 --> 01:26:56,879
Dad! Wait!

1154
01:26:57,089 --> 01:26:58,761
Dad, wait!

1155
01:26:58,969 --> 01:27:01,244
Dad, wait!

1156
01:27:01,889 --> 01:27:04,767
Jason, what are you doing?

1157
01:27:06,449 --> 01:27:08,724
Jason, you cannot go with him!

1158
01:27:08,929 --> 01:27:10,965
Dad, wait!

1159
01:27:11,169 --> 01:27:15,082
Dad! I wanna go with you!

1160
01:27:15,289 --> 01:27:19,202
-Jason?!
-Wait! Dad!

1161
01:27:19,409 --> 01:27:22,481
-Jason.
-Take me with you!

1162
01:27:22,929 --> 01:27:27,605
You"re mad, but we wouldn"t
have had a chance unless I did this.

1163
01:27:28,289 --> 01:27:30,678
Leave me alone.

1164
01:27:33,049 --> 01:27:36,359
Leave me alone!

1165
01:27:37,249 --> 01:27:40,924
If you get out of the street,
l"II leave you alone.

1166
01:27:46,969 --> 01:27:51,406
But remember,
I am your mother.

1167
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:56,965
That means you"re not allowed
to stay mad at me!

1168
01:28:08,769 --> 01:28:11,124
-Can I get two coffees, black?
-Sure.

1169
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:14,480
-Where"s the bathroom?
-Two coffees, to go.

1170
01:28:19,929 --> 01:28:21,726
-Hello?
-Amelia.

1171
01:28:22,209 --> 01:28:27,237
Jason. l"m so glad it"s you.
Have you seen your father?

1172
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:31,727
-No, we"re not there yet. l--
-/ got your message.

1173
01:28:31,929 --> 01:28:34,921
-You did?
-Yeah.

1174
01:28:35,649 --> 01:28:37,162
I love you too.

1175
01:28:37,849 --> 01:28:42,127
This is the greatest conversation
of my life!

1176
01:28:42,329 --> 01:28:45,366
This is the greatest conversation
of my life.

1177
01:28:46,369 --> 01:28:47,768
Okay.

1178
01:28:47,969 --> 01:28:52,281
So, l"m all packed.
l"ve almost got you all packed.

1179
01:28:52,609 --> 01:28:55,407
And we"re leaving tonight.

1180
01:28:57,609 --> 01:29:00,885
-How did your mom take it?
-There was a discussion.

1181
01:29:01,089 --> 01:29:04,604
And she had some <i>q</i>uestions.

1182
01:29:04,929 --> 01:29:07,079
But / think...

1183
01:29:07,289 --> 01:29:10,964
...I figured a way for it
to be okay with everyone.

1184
01:29:11,169 --> 01:29:13,729
-You did?
-You transfer here.

1185
01:29:15,769 --> 01:29:20,285
-What are you talking about?
-I don"t know. l"m just....

1186
01:29:20,649 --> 01:29:23,083
-Jase<i>!</i>
-l"m screwing us up.

1187
01:29:24,129 --> 01:29:27,246
No. No.

1188
01:29:27,809 --> 01:29:32,678
You are not allowed
to feel bad about us. Okay?

1189
01:29:33,089 --> 01:29:37,480
Listen to me. I am not
another woman you have to handle.

1190
01:29:39,049 --> 01:29:43,725
/f you don<i>'</i>t go <i>w</i>ith me, <i>w</i>e<i>'</i>ll
see each other every chance <i>w</i>e get.

1191
01:29:43,929 --> 01:29:46,807
-You are amazing.
-No, l"m not.

1192
01:29:47,009 --> 01:29:49,648
<i>-y</i> ou are.
-l"m not.

1193
01:29:49,849 --> 01:29:51,487
l"m f urious at her!

1194
01:29:54,569 --> 01:29:56,082
But...

1195
01:29:58,689 --> 01:30:01,044
...I can"t give up on you.

1196
01:30:01,409 --> 01:30:06,927
Someday you"II stop raising her.
You"ve been doing it your whole life.

1197
01:30:07,809 --> 01:30:13,042
You"re young. You deserve to be young.
We deserve to be young together.

1198
01:30:13,289 --> 01:30:16,565
<i>R</i>ight no<i>w</i>,
/ can<i>'</i>t make you happy, so...

1199
01:30:17,409 --> 01:30:19,923
-...I gotta go.
-Amelia, wait.

1200
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:22,968
l"II call you when my flight gets in.

1201
01:30:23,969 --> 01:30:25,846
I love you so much.

1202
01:30:35,489 --> 01:30:37,081
Sorry.

1203
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:46,645
Jason, are you coming?

1204
01:31:00,889 --> 01:31:03,926
Do my grocery shopping,
and l"II pay you.

1205
01:31:11,329 --> 01:31:15,607
-Every station"s in color.
-Who"d you steal it f rom?

1206
01:31:15,809 --> 01:31:17,242
I bought it.

1207
01:31:19,809 --> 01:31:23,643
I was wondering
if we could be alone for a minute.

1208
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:28,079
Alone is an unknown dimension to me.
Talk.

1209
01:31:28,289 --> 01:31:32,168
I know l"m not
your favorite person in the world.

1210
01:31:33,769 --> 01:31:37,159
But l"d like to help.
Ray was a good f riend.

1211
01:31:37,369 --> 01:31:41,920
l"d like to offer you a job.
$200 an hour to use your stove.

1212
01:31:42,169 --> 01:31:44,729
Goodbye, Lizzard.
Take the TV.

1213
01:31:44,929 --> 01:31:48,205
No. It"s a gift for me.
Isn"t it?

1214
01:31:48,449 --> 01:31:50,440
Yes, it is.

1215
01:31:51,329 --> 01:31:53,285
It"s a gift. For him.

1216
01:31:53,489 --> 01:31:57,402
-We need to have a family talk.
-It"s not your fault.

1217
01:31:58,089 --> 01:32:00,683
You handle a kid by
taking things away.

1218
01:32:00,889 --> 01:32:06,088
But he doesn"t have anything
to take away. Now he does.

1219
01:32:06,569 --> 01:32:08,366
l"II just wait here.

1220
01:32:08,569 --> 01:32:10,764
It"s not fair, Ma!

1221
01:32:11,169 --> 01:32:13,808
l"m the only kid
without a color TV.

1222
01:32:14,009 --> 01:32:17,968
Well, l"m the only mother
who wears ripped pantyhose.

1223
01:32:18,209 --> 01:32:22,168
l"m the only kid I know
who wears ripped socks!

1224
01:32:23,129 --> 01:32:26,166
l"m the only mother
whose shoes talk to people!

1225
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,200
And I do everything here!

1226
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:31,924
I have to shop, cook, clean
and do the laundry!

1227
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:34,324
I never get to play!

1228
01:32:34,569 --> 01:32:37,845
Yeah? Neither do I!
I go to night school.

1229
01:32:38,129 --> 01:32:43,567
When you work a double shift, I use
the spare time to sleep and bathe.

1230
01:32:43,769 --> 01:32:46,078
-We"re a team, right?
-No!

1231
01:32:46,289 --> 01:32:50,726
You"re supposed to be the mother!
l"m supposed to be the kid!

1232
01:32:59,009 --> 01:33:00,408
Yeah.

1233
01:33:03,649 --> 01:33:07,437
-Let us in! Amelia"s f reezing!
-l"m not cold.

1234
01:33:14,449 --> 01:33:16,724
My father wrote me again.

1235
01:33:16,929 --> 01:33:19,602
He put in another picture
of his wife.

1236
01:33:20,129 --> 01:33:23,326
He wants me
to call her Mother Monsoon.

1237
01:33:23,969 --> 01:33:29,407
I wrote back saying, "She"s not my
mother. Only my mother"s my mother."

1238
01:33:30,329 --> 01:33:33,048
I hate him.

1239
01:33:36,649 --> 01:33:38,765
Come on, Amelia.
Don"t cry.

1240
01:33:39,209 --> 01:33:41,359
At least your father writes.

1241
01:33:41,609 --> 01:33:45,284
He thinks about you.
l"II tell you this much.

1242
01:33:45,489 --> 01:33:49,482
Wherever my dad is,
l"d rather be there than out here.

1243
01:33:53,569 --> 01:33:55,161
We"ve got to focus.

1244
01:33:55,369 --> 01:33:58,202
This will get all of us out of here.

1245
01:33:58,409 --> 01:34:02,004
And I won"t have to ask
my parents for money. Okay?

1246
01:34:02,849 --> 01:34:06,808
When we move to New York,
l"II find the richest guy.

1247
01:34:07,609 --> 01:34:10,442
We"II live in a penthouse.

1248
01:34:12,129 --> 01:34:17,203
You"II be a famous author,
and we"II have book-signing parties.

1249
01:34:19,169 --> 01:34:22,764
-Hey.
-Hey, Grandpa.

1250
01:34:22,969 --> 01:34:27,724
Your grandma wanted me to bring this.
You need it. Give me a kiss.

1251
01:34:28,449 --> 01:34:30,326
You"re so big.

1252
01:34:30,569 --> 01:34:33,606
Your mom care you"re throwing snow
at the house?

1253
01:34:34,009 --> 01:34:38,400
Our mothers went to the store.
They won"t be back for a long time.

1254
01:34:38,849 --> 01:34:40,362
Is that so?

1255
01:34:41,969 --> 01:34:43,880
Don"t break any windows.

1256
01:34:44,089 --> 01:34:48,287
It"s your turn to pick a night
to stay over, huh? Button up.

1257
01:34:51,929 --> 01:34:53,806
Grandpa?

1258
01:34:58,209 --> 01:35:00,723
Mom"s inside drying weed.

1259
01:35:04,289 --> 01:35:08,646
Oh, boy.
These kids got small voices, huh?

1260
01:35:08,849 --> 01:35:13,445
-What do you think of that?
-I didn"t hear a thing. Let"s go.

1261
01:35:14,969 --> 01:35:16,687
Leo, come on.

1262
01:35:25,089 --> 01:35:28,126
Hasek. You made bail.

1263
01:35:32,409 --> 01:35:35,481
The kid"s out,
they"re in business in a day.

1264
01:35:36,609 --> 01:35:42,320
Go to Main Street. You know the old
brick building? He"s chopping cars.

1265
01:35:45,729 --> 01:35:48,527
-Can you fix this?
-Sure.

1266
01:35:48,729 --> 01:35:50,162
How did they know?

1267
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:52,564
I won"t ever tell you told.

1268
01:35:52,769 --> 01:35:57,240
If there"s anyone in the world
you can trust, it"s me.

1269
01:35:57,569 --> 01:35:59,127
-Thanks.
-You"re welcome.

1270
01:36:02,969 --> 01:36:08,566
They took it all. All the money
I was saving to get to New York. Gone.

1271
01:36:10,449 --> 01:36:14,158
They didn"t take it.
I used it to bail you out.

1272
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:17,884
Why didn"t you borrow it
f rom your parents?

1273
01:36:18,209 --> 01:36:23,442
My parents wouldn"t bail me out!
Did you want me to leave you there?

1274
01:36:23,809 --> 01:36:27,882
-No. Who bailed you out?
-Dennis.

1275
01:36:29,689 --> 01:36:34,160
-I thought he wasn"t talking to you.
-Yeah, well...

1276
01:36:34,369 --> 01:36:38,999
...he rode into town on his big
white horse to save the family name.

1277
01:36:40,769 --> 01:36:42,885
But I had to make him a deal.

1278
01:36:43,609 --> 01:36:44,928
What kind of deal?

1279
01:36:45,249 --> 01:36:47,809
Since my parents
are kicking me out...

1280
01:36:48,049 --> 01:36:51,758
...he wants to bring me and Amelia
to Arizona with him.

1281
01:36:51,969 --> 01:36:57,487
He said he"II cover my rent
and food and anything I want.

1282
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:01,404
-lf I don"t....
-lf you don"t what?

1283
01:37:03,329 --> 01:37:05,445
If I don"t see you anymore.

1284
01:37:07,289 --> 01:37:10,804
But l"m gonna tell him
no way tomorrow.

1285
01:37:11,009 --> 01:37:12,203
l"II....

1286
01:37:37,569 --> 01:37:40,037
They like to hug a lot.

1287
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:44,039
They"II never keep us apart.

1288
01:37:49,689 --> 01:37:52,283
l"II call you as soon as I get there.

1289
01:37:53,089 --> 01:37:54,681
I love you.

1290
01:37:57,209 --> 01:37:59,803
Come on, Amelia.
We got to go now.

1291
01:38:03,329 --> 01:38:04,648
Bye.

1292
01:38:06,169 --> 01:38:08,205
Bye, Jason.

1293
01:38:12,889 --> 01:38:14,641
Jason, get in the car.

1294
01:38:15,169 --> 01:38:17,683
-Would you go, Dennis?
-All right.

1295
01:38:19,249 --> 01:38:21,604
Dennis, drive caref ully.

1296
01:38:33,689 --> 01:38:38,763
If I told you something important,
you promise not to get mad?

1297
01:38:39,169 --> 01:38:41,046
Tell me. What?

1298
01:38:42,209 --> 01:38:46,441
You got to swear not to get mad,
or else l"m not going to tell you.

1299
01:38:46,689 --> 01:38:48,566
Fine. I swear.

1300
01:38:50,689 --> 01:38:52,725
I told Grandpa.

1301
01:38:53,169 --> 01:38:55,603
You told Grandpa what?

1302
01:38:55,969 --> 01:38:59,041
I told him you were inside
drying weed.

1303
01:39:00,129 --> 01:39:01,847
You what?

1304
01:39:14,969 --> 01:39:18,848
-Why would you do that? Why?
-I don"t know.

1305
01:39:20,129 --> 01:39:25,123
You don"t destroy everybody"s life
and then say, "I don"t know." Why?

1306
01:39:25,569 --> 01:39:29,482
I was gonna use that money
to get us out of here.

1307
01:39:29,729 --> 01:39:33,483
Do you understand?
You just ruined our lives!

1308
01:39:33,769 --> 01:39:38,081
That"s not what you say
when someone tells the truth.

1309
01:39:39,009 --> 01:39:44,083
And the worst thing of all is
Fay is gone. Because of you.

1310
01:39:46,969 --> 01:39:48,960
I have no one.

1311
01:39:56,729 --> 01:39:58,367
Some things never change.

1312
01:39:58,609 --> 01:40:03,319
Like me being confused about
everything e<i>x</i> cept <i>w</i>hat she<i>'</i>s feeling.

1313
01:40:03,569 --> 01:40:05,127
We must be getting close.

1314
01:40:05,329 --> 01:40:07,206
This is where he lives.

1315
01:40:07,409 --> 01:40:11,607
She <i>w</i>on<i>'</i>t admit it,
but she<i>'</i>s scared about seeing <i>R</i>ay.

1316
01:40:25,169 --> 01:40:28,002
Are you sure you"II be okay
seeing him?

1317
01:40:28,889 --> 01:40:30,242
Sure.

1318
01:40:30,449 --> 01:40:35,204
You can wait in the car if you want.
I completely understand.

1319
01:40:35,409 --> 01:40:36,842
l"m fine.

1320
01:40:50,009 --> 01:40:53,479
Coming! Just a second!

1321
01:40:54,849 --> 01:40:57,682
l"II get my robe on!

1322
01:41:06,209 --> 01:41:09,804
-Does Raymond Hasek live here?
-And you are?

1323
01:41:10,649 --> 01:41:12,207
Beverly.

1324
01:41:15,209 --> 01:41:20,124
-It"s for you. Get up!
-Hold on, l"m coming.

1325
01:41:20,329 --> 01:41:24,447
Come on in. He"s indisposed.
You might as well come in.

1326
01:41:25,209 --> 01:41:26,881
Thank you.

1327
01:41:29,049 --> 01:41:32,041
Sorry, we weren"t expecting company.

1328
01:41:32,249 --> 01:41:35,241
-You"ve got cool stuff.
-I collect things.

1329
01:41:38,129 --> 01:41:39,926
Is it hunting season?

1330
01:41:40,569 --> 01:41:45,165
That"s the firing range.
You into that?

1331
01:41:45,649 --> 01:41:48,209
Some people....
Ray!

1332
01:41:48,729 --> 01:41:50,287
Just a sec.

1333
01:41:56,689 --> 01:41:58,805
Ray, it"s me.

1334
01:42:01,329 --> 01:42:02,921
Beverly.

1335
01:42:05,409 --> 01:42:07,365
Bev! Hey!

1336
01:42:08,369 --> 01:42:10,724
Hey, Bev. It"s me, Ray.

1337
01:42:14,849 --> 01:42:17,807
I never thought of you as being older.

1338
01:42:25,249 --> 01:42:27,319
Beverly, this is Shirley.

1339
01:42:27,969 --> 01:42:30,403
Shirley, this is my first wife.

1340
01:42:31,449 --> 01:42:32,564
Hello.

1341
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:35,407
Charmed.

1342
01:42:37,009 --> 01:42:38,442
Hey, man.

1343
01:42:38,929 --> 01:42:41,762
Ray, this is your son, Jason.

1344
01:42:52,369 --> 01:42:54,837
I wouldn"t have known you.

1345
01:43:03,049 --> 01:43:04,687
Hey, thanks.

1346
01:43:07,489 --> 01:43:10,083
Hey, you wanna sit down?
Come on.

1347
01:43:10,449 --> 01:43:14,681
Clear off the thing.
Have a seat.

1348
01:43:17,169 --> 01:43:20,320
Right there is good.
Something to drink?

1349
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:23,402
-Something to drink?
-We don"t have anything.

1350
01:43:23,609 --> 01:43:26,407
Get them an orange thing.

1351
01:43:27,009 --> 01:43:28,920
A moment alone, Ray?

1352
01:43:29,409 --> 01:43:31,365
-Kool-Aid?
-You want to--

1353
01:43:31,609 --> 01:43:36,046
-l"m not going anywhere.
-Yeah. Thanks.

1354
01:43:37,089 --> 01:43:39,239
Right.

1355
01:43:41,609 --> 01:43:43,201
Let me lay this out.

1356
01:43:43,409 --> 01:43:48,802
l"ve been making my living working
at a small newspaper in New York.

1357
01:43:49,009 --> 01:43:51,967
But at night, for 6 years...

1358
01:43:53,089 --> 01:43:56,638
-...l"ve been writing a book.
-Four years.

1359
01:43:56,849 --> 01:43:59,602
You started the book
when I turned 16.

1360
01:44:00,009 --> 01:44:03,684
It was my birthday present.
That was four years ago.

1361
01:44:04,049 --> 01:44:08,964
-Fine, four years. Happy?
-Just give it to him right.

1362
01:44:13,009 --> 01:44:15,364
Kool-Aid.

1363
01:44:15,849 --> 01:44:17,202
Enjoy.

1364
01:44:18,689 --> 01:44:22,921
-I finished the book.
-Really? That"s great.

1365
01:44:23,969 --> 01:44:26,324
And they want to publish it.

1366
01:44:27,889 --> 01:44:30,847
You know this is huge for me.

1367
01:44:31,049 --> 01:44:35,008
It"s what l"ve wanted
for as long as I can remember.

1368
01:44:39,089 --> 01:44:41,808
But it"s a small publishing house.

1369
01:44:43,089 --> 01:44:48,561
Since you"re in so much of it,
they wanna be caref ul about lawsuits.

1370
01:44:48,769 --> 01:44:53,923
There"s a lot about you and drugs and
illegal acts. It"s not flattering.

1371
01:44:54,129 --> 01:44:56,199
Anyway...

1372
01:44:57,489 --> 01:44:59,844
...what l"m getting at is...

1373
01:45:00,969 --> 01:45:04,041
...they need you
to sign this release...

1374
01:45:04,369 --> 01:45:07,202
...or they can"t risk publishing it.

1375
01:45:10,649 --> 01:45:12,128
I get it.

1376
01:45:13,889 --> 01:45:15,686
Ex cuse me.

1377
01:45:15,889 --> 01:45:20,440
Ex cuse me, Ray.
Honey, stop.

1378
01:45:20,849 --> 01:45:23,568
-Give me that.
-She has to pay you.

1379
01:45:23,769 --> 01:45:29,685
-You"re in her book. She"II get rich.
-What are you talking about?

1380
01:45:30,289 --> 01:45:33,281
-l"m asking how much we get.
-I don"t--

1381
01:45:33,489 --> 01:45:36,083
-Why are you starting?
-$100, 000.

1382
01:45:36,449 --> 01:45:37,848
What?!

1383
01:45:39,969 --> 01:45:43,803
-Did I ever ask for child support?
-Get out.

1384
01:45:44,329 --> 01:45:48,766
-Hey, come on.
-Come back when you got money.

1385
01:45:48,969 --> 01:45:50,880
-Calm down.
-l"m not leaving.

1386
01:45:51,089 --> 01:45:54,001
-Just get up.
-We can"t leave.

1387
01:45:54,209 --> 01:45:57,724
l"m the one busting my ass
to get us out of here!

1388
01:45:57,929 --> 01:46:00,568
If you think about moving,
l"m gone.

1389
01:46:01,169 --> 01:46:05,560
-I will never forgive you!
-We"II get over it, trust me.

1390
01:46:06,409 --> 01:46:10,402
We should"ve given you more time
to talk. l"m sorry.

1391
01:46:10,649 --> 01:46:12,640
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1392
01:46:13,329 --> 01:46:17,288
-What are you doing?
-You were gonna sign your life away.

1393
01:46:17,489 --> 01:46:21,118
What were you thinking?
God, I can"t stand her!

1394
01:46:23,209 --> 01:46:25,279
-Give me the keys.
-No.

1395
01:46:25,489 --> 01:46:30,279
You don"t care. l"m not getting
published, and you don"t even care.

1396
01:46:32,129 --> 01:46:36,247
I just saw a guy
who hasn"t showered in a month.

1397
01:46:36,449 --> 01:46:40,442
Whose teeth are rotting,
who"s living in shit.

1398
01:46:40,849 --> 01:46:43,568
-And he"s my dad.
-Don"t do this.

1399
01:46:43,889 --> 01:46:46,767
Don"t turn this into your problem.

1400
01:46:47,569 --> 01:46:53,121
Do me a favor. Just pretend
to be a good mother for two minutes.

1401
01:46:53,329 --> 01:46:57,242
Just two minutes
out of your whole life.

1402
01:46:57,449 --> 01:46:59,326
Okay?

1403
01:47:06,769 --> 01:47:08,646
Where are you going?

1404
01:47:08,849 --> 01:47:14,082
You"II have to remember what you
just said as long as you live.

1405
01:47:14,289 --> 01:47:17,122
-l"m not coming after you!
-Good.

1406
01:47:17,329 --> 01:47:19,126
She hasn"t changed.

1407
01:47:20,649 --> 01:47:24,403
Everything always happens to her,
no one else.

1408
01:47:24,649 --> 01:47:26,401
Hey, come here.

1409
01:47:30,609 --> 01:47:31,803
Come here.

1410
01:47:38,689 --> 01:47:40,884
I signed that thing, okay?

1411
01:47:43,809 --> 01:47:48,246
I can"t give it to you,
she"s watching. Don"t look.

1412
01:47:48,689 --> 01:47:53,638
I said I came out to take out the
garbage and say goodbye.

1413
01:47:53,849 --> 01:47:56,079
-Right, right, right.
-So....

1414
01:47:57,049 --> 01:48:01,998
Wow, this is probably the last time
l"II ever talk to you.

1415
01:48:02,689 --> 01:48:05,999
I just want to say that....

1416
01:48:06,209 --> 01:48:10,600
I used to feel real bad
about leaving you and all.

1417
01:48:11,569 --> 01:48:16,359
Then, a couple of years ago,
your ma sent me a letter, saying...

1418
01:48:18,449 --> 01:48:20,485
...what a nice kid you were.

1419
01:48:20,849 --> 01:48:24,478
What a good man
you turned out to be.

1420
01:48:25,729 --> 01:48:28,926
l"d like to think
I had a lot to do with that.

1421
01:48:29,889 --> 01:48:34,883
-Yeah, okay.
-Even if all I did was stay away...

1422
01:48:35,409 --> 01:48:38,719
...it"s still the best thing
I ever did in my life.

1423
01:48:44,449 --> 01:48:48,362
I can"t give you the paper.
She"s watching us like a hawk.

1424
01:48:48,889 --> 01:48:51,357
Don"t look, don"t look, don"t look.

1425
01:48:52,249 --> 01:48:57,243
So l"m gonna come in
like l"m hugging you.

1426
01:48:57,449 --> 01:48:59,758
l"II slip it in your pocket.

1427
01:48:59,969 --> 01:49:04,087
l"m gonna come in now.
Lift up your arm.

1428
01:49:06,609 --> 01:49:09,248
-It"s in.
-All right.

1429
01:49:13,209 --> 01:49:16,406
-Finished throwing out the garbage?
-Yeah.

1430
01:49:17,809 --> 01:49:21,119
-You sure about this?
-What, Shirley?

1431
01:49:21,329 --> 01:49:24,799
She"II get over it.
Women want to forgive.

1432
01:49:26,169 --> 01:49:30,447
Even a total screw-up, they"II help.
It"s in their nature.

1433
01:49:31,649 --> 01:49:36,677
You just gotta remember, you gotta
tell them you need their help.

1434
01:49:36,889 --> 01:49:39,084
Or else they won"t do it.

1435
01:49:40,249 --> 01:49:44,037
Lord knows, I need
all the help I can get.

1436
01:49:46,009 --> 01:49:48,000
Don"t we all?

1437
01:49:52,409 --> 01:49:54,718
Goodbye, son.

1438
01:50:29,489 --> 01:50:33,641
I was a good mother.
No, I was a great mother...

1439
01:50:33,849 --> 01:50:37,285
...for what I went through
to keep you together.

1440
01:50:37,489 --> 01:50:42,483
l"m not asking for thanks,
but don"t do this to me, you ingrate.

1441
01:50:44,209 --> 01:50:46,245
Who says l"m in one piece?

1442
01:50:47,129 --> 01:50:51,008
-You"re the most normal person I know.
-Normal?

1443
01:50:53,049 --> 01:50:54,482
Normal?

1444
01:50:54,729 --> 01:50:59,723
Amelia was in New York two weeks ago.
She wants me to transfer.

1445
01:50:59,929 --> 01:51:03,399
She wants me to enroll in her school.

1446
01:51:03,609 --> 01:51:05,998
But I can"t go.

1447
01:51:06,889 --> 01:51:12,122
I can"t leave you.
If something bad happens to you...

1448
01:51:12,369 --> 01:51:14,644
...it"s my fault.

1449
01:51:17,289 --> 01:51:22,921
l"m what went wrong with your life.
You know, you wrote a book about it.

1450
01:51:26,489 --> 01:51:28,844
I swore I wouldn"t--

1451
01:51:29,689 --> 01:51:34,717
Did you know I love Amelia?
Don"t worry, she left already.

1452
01:51:35,249 --> 01:51:37,285
Here"s the f unny thing.

1453
01:51:37,489 --> 01:51:41,607
She thinks I can"t love her
because she can"t make me happy...

1454
01:51:41,809 --> 01:51:45,484
...and damn it, she"s the only
good thing in my life.

1455
01:51:48,849 --> 01:51:51,568
l"m just incredibly screwed up.

1456
01:51:51,769 --> 01:51:55,398
Just so we"re real clear about this,
I blame you.

1457
01:52:01,089 --> 01:52:03,887
When does this job ever end?

1458
01:52:06,089 --> 01:52:08,045
You call it a job?

1459
01:52:08,249 --> 01:52:11,207
Well, what do you think it is?
A calling?

1460
01:52:18,849 --> 01:52:20,885
I screwed up.

1461
01:52:23,649 --> 01:52:25,685
I screwed up.

1462
01:52:26,249 --> 01:52:29,400
Come on, don"t cry.
l"m sorry.

1463
01:52:30,849 --> 01:52:34,762
l"m sorry.
Look, Ray signed.

1464
01:52:36,769 --> 01:52:40,967
I don"t care. Just go.

1465
01:52:41,169 --> 01:52:43,205
Just leave me here.

1466
01:52:50,969 --> 01:52:53,358
Mom...

1467
01:52:53,929 --> 01:52:56,284
...I need your help.

1468
01:53:01,049 --> 01:53:03,199
With what?

1469
01:53:15,409 --> 01:53:19,561
Mom, wait.
What about clothes?

1470
01:53:20,129 --> 01:53:23,201
-They sell them in Indiana.
-My apartment?

1471
01:53:24,969 --> 01:53:27,119
l"II take care of it.

1472
01:53:28,369 --> 01:53:31,725
l"II take care of everything.
Just go.

1473
01:53:31,929 --> 01:53:34,238
How will you get home?

1474
01:53:34,449 --> 01:53:37,600
l"II drop you off
and leave tomorrow.

1475
01:53:37,809 --> 01:53:40,721
If you don"t go now,
you"II never go.

1476
01:53:42,409 --> 01:53:43,762
l"II be fine here.

1477
01:53:44,249 --> 01:53:48,162
There"s a pay phone.
l"II call someone.

1478
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:51,923
Just go.

1479
01:53:58,249 --> 01:53:59,364
Wait.

1480
01:54:04,489 --> 01:54:06,957
Stay there.

1481
01:54:08,969 --> 01:54:11,961
I wanna make something clear.

1482
01:54:12,649 --> 01:54:16,562
I don"t think I would"ve been
better off without you.

1483
01:54:16,889 --> 01:54:20,848
You are not what went wrong
with anything.

1484
01:54:21,289 --> 01:54:23,644
You were what saved me.

1485
01:54:26,489 --> 01:54:29,208
I want to thank you for that.

1486
01:54:33,809 --> 01:54:35,401
Okay?

1487
01:54:39,889 --> 01:54:41,880
You"re welcome?

1488
01:54:46,209 --> 01:54:49,599
Now hug me,
or l"II take it all back.

1489
01:54:59,369 --> 01:55:01,929
I love you.

1490
01:55:09,009 --> 01:55:10,601
I love you too.

1491
01:55:27,009 --> 01:55:31,287
Not that it matters, but does Fay
know about you and Amelia?

1492
01:55:32,449 --> 01:55:35,680
She thinks it"s great.

1493
01:55:36,569 --> 01:55:40,881
I can"t believe that.
I can"t believe that. Fay!

1494
01:55:42,809 --> 01:55:46,643
We talked two nights ago.
She didn"t say anything.

1495
01:55:46,849 --> 01:55:51,161
-Bye, Mom.
-l"m supposed to be her best f riend!

1496
01:55:53,089 --> 01:55:56,081
l"II call you f rom Indiana.

1497
01:56:53,049 --> 01:56:54,198
Cold.

1498
01:56:55,249 --> 01:56:57,160
Sure is.

1499
01:56:59,649 --> 01:57:03,085
-It"s okay if I spend the night?
-Yeah.

1500
01:57:05,129 --> 01:57:09,566
Jason blames me for everything
that"s happened in his life.

1501
01:57:09,889 --> 01:57:12,881
Can you imagine?

1502
02:05:53,369 --> 02:05:54,279
