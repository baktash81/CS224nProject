1
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,700
MAN BITES DOG
(IT HAPPENED I N YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD)

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,600
I've just finished
ballasting the corpse, see?

3
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,000
That means you fill it
with certain things because...

4
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,800
You may not be aware that
a corpse under water

5
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,000
swells up with air, see?

6
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,300
So it tends to float
to the surface.

7
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,100
You have to load it
with ballast so it sinks.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,100
You weight it down with stones
and other heavy stuff.

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,600
There's a ballast ratio
for corpses...

10
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,400
Three times body weight

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,900
for an average adult
like this victim.

12
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,700
But for children
and midgets it's different.

13
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,700
Kids are lighter.

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,200
So it's four times body weight.

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,700
What?
- Never had problems?

16
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,600
No. Midgets are heavier,
so you double the weight.

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
Midgets have denser bones
so you double the weight.

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,600
For old people, multiply by five.
Old bones are porous.

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,000
- Hi, Mom!
- Goodness gracious!

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,800
How's my little boy?

21
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,700
This is Mom, that's Grandma,
this is the store.

22
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,000
This is where I grew up.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,700
Grandpa's not here?
- He's out.

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,700
He'll be back soon.

25
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
What time is it?

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,900
Guess what...

27
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,100
My Grandpa.

28
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,500
I've put up with her now
for 53 years!

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,900
Imagine that.

30
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Imagine the effort it took him?

31
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,200
Guess who made the effort,
me or him?

32
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,200
Hats off. I've put up
with her now for 53 years.

33
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,200
He was such a cheerful little boy.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,300
Full of pranks,
and blond as a field of wheat.

35
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't tease me, Papa.
- Stop it or I'll cry!

36
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
You ruin everything.

37
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,100
Benoit was such a delight.

38
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,900
- A good boy?
- A darling!

39
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,100
He was affectionate and sweet.

40
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,100
Laughing all the time, all the time.

41
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,100
What do you mean, "he was"?
He's not anymore?

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
You don't understand me, Papa.

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,100
How they bickered!

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,100
Like cats and dogs!

45
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,500
Lights!

46
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,900
<i>I usually start the month
with a postman.</i>

47
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,100
<i>I get up in the morning</i>

48
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,900
<i>and spend it pinching pensions.</i>

49
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,000
<i>At the same time this allows me
to locate old folks with money.</i>

50
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,500
<i>What I avoid are young couples.
They stink of poverty.</i>

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,500
It's unpleasant.
But old folks are loaded, that's for sure!

52
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
I've never seen an old pauper.

53
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,500
Stingy? Yes. But paupers? Never.

54
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,000
You watching me... or the kids?

55
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,000
They have guns just like me.

56
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Not bad at all, these gadgets.

57
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,100
Give me one.

58
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,200
Go on and play.

59
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,600
No school today?

60
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,400
That's the trouble with women.

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,100
Sure I've been hurt before.

62
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,300
I gave them something,
they gave me something.

63
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,200
But there comes a time

64
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,500
when you start to ask questions.

65
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
All on account of that little door.

66
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,100
In a couple,
the door has to stay open.

67
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,900
And when it's open

68
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,800
it's either to bring
in new nourishment...

69
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,000
or it's to let you out.

70
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
Either you add a little seed...

71
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,600
and that seed can be a baby,

72
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,500
or a good time or a holiday...

73
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Or you get out,
lock, stock and seed.

74
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,900
With women, you can't always tell
if the door's open

75
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
and if it's time to add a seed,

76
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,300
or get the hell out.

77
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,300
I've been hurt
because I'd open the door wide,

78
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,100
and they'd shut it.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,900
Love leaves a trail of sulfur

80
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,700
like some lingering smell.

81
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,900
As soon as you meet someone,
you smell it.

82
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Like when you take a leak,
your fingers smell.

83
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,900
You have to wash them
two or three times

84
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
<i>so you can forget you pissed.</i>

85
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,700
Watch me, I'll show you a trick.

86
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,000
As a kid they called me
"The Octopus."

87
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,100
Know why?

88
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,800
Because I could make
any part of my body move on its own.

89
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,400
I'll show you.

90
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,800
All by itself. Watch my nose.

91
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,600
Look.

92
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,900
Now my ears. Watch closely.

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,900
See that? Look!

94
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,500
Now the right one.
Now the left... See?

95
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,900
I can make something else move,

96
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
but it's not for the camera!

97
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,200
Turn it off, you jerk!

98
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,300
- Got home okay last night?
- No problem.

99
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,800
I figured you guys
must have been bushed.

100
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,200
Throw the keys down.

101
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
Or are you coming down?

102
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,400
I'll throw you the keys.

103
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,600
It's not the right key.

104
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,800
It's not this one.

105
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,700
Must be the other one.

106
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,700
Look who's here! Benoit!

107
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm so glad to see you!

108
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,900
What a surprise!
How've you been?

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,500
Fine, Jenny.
I'm here with a camera...

110
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,500
They're doing a thing on me.

111
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Do you mind?
- Not at all.

112
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Come in, come in.

113
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,300
Don't stay out there.

114
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,200
So what's new?
- I had a rough time locating you.

115
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,100
I thought you still lived at Sablon.

116
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,300
We were evicted by urban renewal.

117
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,700
Here's where we wound up.
- Maurice gave me the address.

118
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,700
I'm so glad to see you!

119
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,500
Got anything to drink?

120
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,300
My throat's dry.

121
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,700
- What'll it be?
- Some of your brandy.

122
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,500
- How about your friends?
- Ask them.

123
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,800
- What'll it be?
- Something cold.

124
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,800
- And you, sir?
- A beer for me.

125
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
- And you?
- A brandy as well.

126
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,800
Coming up!

127
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,500
That's myJenny.

128
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,300
That's her, this is her world.

129
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,300
That's her in her prime,
when she was a beauty.

130
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,900
She's still a beauty.

131
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,600
That's when I met her.

132
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,800
This is Jenny's bed.

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,300
I'll show you something.

134
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,600
You can tan while you make love.

135
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,300
When you're through,
you've got a brown ass!

136
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,800
Ever see anything like it? Bet not!

137
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,400
What nonsense!

138
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,900
Baloney, baloney...

139
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,200
Jenny used to live...

140
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,100
I told you she moved.
That's why we had trouble finding her.

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,400
She lived 30 years
in the Sablon district.

142
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Then some real estate developer...

143
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,300
I can't remember the name,
but the hell with it...

144
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,300
decided just like that

145
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,700
<i>to move in.! Sure they could...</i>

146
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,700
The law's on their side.
We didn't own the house.

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Anyway, they raised holy hell,
threw everyone out.

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,500
But it was the way
they went about it...

149
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,700
So, they told Jenny to move out...

150
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,700
There was this little smart-ass,

151
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,700
<i>a vulgar littlejerk,
who had the nerve</i>

152
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,100
to speak and behave rudely
with Jenny...

153
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
The Sablon may have got a face-lift,

154
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,500
but one guy's no longer around
to enjoy it.

155
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,500
It's only fair if a member
of the family is wronged...

156
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,200
So I went and had a little talk
with that fella...

157
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,200
I'll call you back, sweets,
I'm still working.

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,900
Talk to you in a sec.

159
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,100
Those bastards!
A black night watchman!

160
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,000
What a dirty trick!

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,400
So you can't see him!
Who'd ever sink so low?

162
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,500
They'll stop at nothing!

163
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,600
Poor kid, born under the sun!

164
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,000
I bet he grew up
under the baobabs,

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,900
and here he is on a work site.
It makes me sick.

166
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,700
They try to get away with murder.

167
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,500
It's like this cement. Hungarian
probably. Made to last temporarily.

168
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,800
You can be sure they use
more sand than cement, too.

169
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,500
They pinch pennies,
then the walls crack!

170
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,600
The whole building crumbles.

171
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,300
<i>I once buried two Arabs
in a wall over there...</i>

172
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,400
Facing Mecca, of course...

173
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,000
In two years their assholes
will see daylight.

174
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
Let's go sink this Mubutu.

175
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
A handsome fella to boot.

176
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,800
But I'm warning you,
I won't touch him.

177
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,500
Why not?

178
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,100
Al DS, Remy...

179
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,500
Al DS. Green monkeys.

180
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,600
Grab him by the galoshes,
but I won't touch him.

181
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,400
But why's he in yellow
if he's in camouflage?

182
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,600
At least he had no dogs,
usually they have a pack of curs.

183
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,900
I hate them. Blacks have a way
with animals, you know.

184
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,300
That's a fact.

185
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,700
They know how to talk to them.

186
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,100
Here's our golden opportunity.

187
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,500
To see if that legend
about their size is true.

188
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,400
Remy, pull his pants down.

189
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,200
We'll know in a jiffy.

190
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,700
Good Lord!

191
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,700
He's really well hung.

192
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,800
You can wrap it up now.
It's disgusting!

193
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,300
The kid's barely 18
and already hung like a polar bear!

194
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Kids like that often work
in nightclubs.

195
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,400
It's their livelihood.

196
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,000
He must be a prude
to take a job like this.

197
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,900
But some guys make a living
with their organ. Awful, isn't it?

198
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,400
What's so funny?

199
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,700
It sure won't make you a living.

200
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,400
Here we are in a neighborhood
of mostly senior citizens.

201
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,600
Planners design so-called
low-cost housing.

202
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,200
Flats meant for young people,

203
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,700
for newlyweds setting up house,

204
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,800
for workers,
for housewives,

205
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,500
and maybe even the unemployed.

206
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,600
It's all part
of the district renewal plan

207
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,600
that aims to bring old folks
out of isolation by mixing them

208
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,000
with the working population.

209
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,000
It's a great idea,
but what I don't like is...

210
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,200
and here's the rub...
how can you design

211
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,600
low-cost housing projects

212
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,700
in total disregard for aesthetics?

213
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,600
I can't accept that, I'm sorry.

214
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,100
They thought of planting
Japanese cherry trees

215
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
along the lanes, see?

216
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,300
In the style of English beach resorts.

217
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,000
A truly grand idea,
but did they do it?

218
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
Did they do it?
- No.

219
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,700
Yes, they did.
But they didn't follow through!

220
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,500
That's the shame of it.
It was purely cosmetic.

221
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,700
Just to dazzle them,
and people fell for it.

222
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,700
I followed it all,
I saw how far their bright ideas went.

223
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,800
What do you notice at first glance?

224
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,900
What stands out?

225
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,100
The red bricks!

226
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,200
What's red bring to mind?

227
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,900
Red is the color of blood,
of Indians!

228
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,000
It's the color of violence!

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,400
And the scourge of society...
as everybody agrees... is violence.

230
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,100
So why the red bricks?

231
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,900
Red is also the color of wine...

232
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,000
For wining and dining.

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,300
It's all about palm-greasing,
dirty politicians

234
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,200
and wheeling and dealing.

235
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,100
It pains me.
Wherever you take your camera...

236
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,400
Folks would love to stop and say,

237
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,000
"What a lovely flower bed,
what powerful asymmetry!"

238
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,600
"What a beautiful red hue of brick."

239
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
But they never get the chance.

240
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,800
Instead they sit in front
of their TV sets.

241
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,000
If I'd been asked to design
that kind of a layout,

242
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'd have planned
ground-level homes

243
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,200
with spacious lawns,
a bit like Frank Lloyd Wright,

244
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
in the style ofJapanese houses.

245
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,200
Despite their faults,
those people sure know how to live!

246
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,600
You know, emphasizing aesthetics
is one thing,

247
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,600
stressing the functional is another.

248
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,800
Those guys
overemphasize the functional,

249
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,700
unlike people like Gaudi,

250
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,800
who had a magnificent
architectural style,

251
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,200
a very organic style,
forms that grow out of nowhere.

252
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,900
Or Horta who did
such fabulous things,

253
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
those great whiplash effects.

254
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,500
Sorry to disturb you,
we're a television crew.

255
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,600
We're doing a report on loneliness
in high-rise apartments.

256
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,500
Would you mind answering
a few questions?

257
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,900
Of course,
if it doesn't take too long.

258
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,000
I promise we'll be brief.

259
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,600
Come in.

260
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,500
You'll hardly notice us.

261
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,800
This is the crew.

262
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,100
Sit down.

263
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,900
Go ahead.

264
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,700
Don't let the camera intimidate you.
Just act and speak naturally.

265
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,900
It bothers me none.
I was filmed once in Mons.

266
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,800
There was an army band concert.
I enjoyed that.

267
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,700
That's fine, our subject
is used to the camera.

268
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,900
Just fine.

269
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,800
May I ask my first question?
- Of course.

270
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,900
Tell me, Madam,
among your friends and acquaintances,

271
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,400
does anyone visit you regularly?

272
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,100
I have acquaintances...

273
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,800
but I get along with everybody.

274
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,400
They call me Granny...

275
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,700
Granny Snuff, ever been snuffed out?

276
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,900
This is a special case.

277
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,700
When I came in, I immediately
noticed the box of Sedocar.

278
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,300
You may not know this,

279
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,400
but Sedocar is a drug
for heart patients.

280
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,800
So I just freaked her out,

281
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,700
which saves me a bullet.

282
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,700
It's so much easier on the neighbors,
on me, and on her.

283
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,400
I like to try out new work methods.

284
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,500
She's fading fast now.

285
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,900
We may as well go straight
to the heart of the matter.

286
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,600
Let's hit the jackpot.
On to the kitchen?

287
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,800
Lift the tablecloth.

288
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,400
I'm gonna have a drink.

289
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
Help yourselves.

290
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,600
There's plenty for all.

291
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,900
I know you're filming
on a shoestring budget.

292
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,500
I believe in sharing, no problem.

293
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,600
Thanks, Ben.

294
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,500
Back to work.
Follow me and I'll show you.

295
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,600
I bet there's something
under the bed.

296
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,600
I don't know, but I have
a feeling about this room.

297
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,000
The little hog!

298
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,000
Now I'll show you something.

299
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,900
Here's the jewelry,
glassware and stuff...

300
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,500
The old lady whet my appetite.

301
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,700
Know what I'd like, Remy?

302
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,400
A nice big plate of mussels,

303
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,900
with lots of veggies,
sauce, and fries.

304
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,800
Where can you get mussels?

305
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,600
- A restaurant.
- By the sea.

306
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,200
You're my guests for a seaside dinner.

307
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,500
What do you say?
It's a two-hour drive.

308
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,600
A big plate of mussels,
some drinks...

309
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,200
It'll be a great evening.
Just to celebrate.

310
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,700
What's wrong?

311
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,500
What's the matter?
Don't you like mussels?

312
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,000
Sure, I do.

313
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,000
Then why the blank look?
Let's go.

314
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,800
I think Andre has to be home tonight.

315
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,300
- You have to go home?
- I had other plans.

316
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,700
Then call home
and let's hit the road.

317
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,300
Patrick?

318
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,400
What about him?

319
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,100
Without Andre, there's no point...

320
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,700
I'm the guy who should be invited!

321
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,000
Let's paint the town red.

322
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,600
What if we went another time?

323
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,700
They have commitments.

324
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,000
It's okay, if I plan in advance.

325
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's nice of you, Ben.

326
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,900
Then come with me.

327
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,200
I have no car.

328
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,600
- We'll all go some other time.
- Okay, forget it.

329
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,700
I'll find a restaurant nearby.

330
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
Never mind, guys.

331
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,700
It'll be for another time.

332
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Sure, no problem, another time.

333
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,300
We'll have plenty of opportunities.

334
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,200
Sure we will.

335
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,900
See you around.
Let me know when you need me.

336
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,500
- Do you want a lift?
- Walking's good for the appetite.

337
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,900
- We'll give you a lift.
- I'd rather walk, for the appetite.

338
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,500
Thanks anyway, guys.

339
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,600
Andre hinted earlier

340
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
that you might have trouble
financing the rest of your film.

341
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,400
I'm naturally ready to share
the cost of film.

342
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,400
- I'd be delighted.
- That's nice of you.

343
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,000
And if we have to work overtime,
we'll do it.

344
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
We'll turn this film into an epic!

345
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,400
A toast to the old lady.

346
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
White or red?

347
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,500
Shall I choose?

348
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,200
We'll have this one.

349
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,800
I'm afraid that's not
the wisest choice today.

350
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,800
If you'll allow me...
- I'll allow you nothing.

351
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,600
Take care of your face case,
then you can make allowances.

352
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,700
At times, crafty as a fox,

353
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,700
at times, a little rascal,

354
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,600
at times, a gangster,

355
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,800
but generous as they come.

356
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,400
Whatever the amount
you need, Remy,

357
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,300
Benoit will always,
and I mean always, deliver.

358
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,000
Thanks, Ben.

359
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,200
<i>In a kingdom by the sea,</i>

360
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,100
<i>along clear gulfs,</i>

361
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,100
<i>and plump waves</i>

362
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,600
<i>to stop the waves,</i>

363
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,400
<i>and flying fish, gliding like gulls,</i>

364
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,100
<i>and plankton to your heart's content,</i>

365
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,400
<i>and red salmon</i>

366
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,800
<i>leaping from the heavens,</i>

367
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,500
<i>the sourjellyfish
and purple seaweed,</i>

368
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,800
<i>and the winter's kelp...</i>

369
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,800
<i>Nothing shall stop me
from calling your name...</i>

370
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,300
<i>Sea, Sea, Sea, O cruel mother,</i>

371
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,900
<i>Oh, say, can you see...</i>

372
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,300
What are you waiting for,
douche bag, high tide?

373
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,300
We'd better go.
Bring us a mop, please.

374
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,100
I'm all right.

375
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Must be bad mussels.

376
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,100
You don't feel sick?
- I'm okay.

377
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,100
Let's go home.

378
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,400
I'll pay and we'll leave.

379
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,000
Meet Valerie...
thanks to her many worldly contacts,

380
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,700
she's given me a taste
of various artistic circles.

381
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,600
Some of those circles
are very closed.

382
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,400
Today we're in the world
of painting.

383
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,900
I have a keen interest in that world.

384
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,600
This is a very nice Swedish exhibit.
Had a look?

385
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,000
The Swedish are interesting...
intensely sensitive.

386
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,300
An artist I really appreciate
is Bernard Buffet.

387
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,800
Know his work?
You know who I mean?

388
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,800
He did a poster for Robert Hossein...
Heard of him, no?

389
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,200
For a show called
"The Life ofJesus."

390
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,900
It shows a big hand
reaching up to the sky.

391
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,400
And the hand's meant
to evokeJesus.

392
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,300
The scarification
and all that jazz.

393
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,000
Big hands, big drawings...
A knockout!

394
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,600
Hossein sure knows
how to pick his collaborators.

395
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,900
You like Hossein?
His shows are great.

396
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,800
Seen any?

397
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,600
A great actor, too.
He's made lots of movies.

398
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,000
He used to play dark romantic types
in those old costume pictures.

399
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,100
Do you know Ben's trade?

400
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,200
You can speak up.
Your silence is eloquent!

401
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,500
Some trade!
- Dummy!

402
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,900
Doesn't it bother you?

403
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,600
I don't pry into his work.

404
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,500
Everyone's got to eat.

405
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,900
Besides, we're old friends.

406
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,900
Talking about Buffet,
here it comes!

407
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,700
Over this way.

408
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,400
Don't be afraid.

409
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
The camera makes him nervous.

410
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,200
Help yourselves to canapes.

411
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,700
I only eat the top part.

412
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,000
- What note did you just play?
- Oh, it's an F sharp.

413
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,500
- And what did you play?
- An F natural.

414
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,800
That's right, ducky.

415
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
<i>In 4/ 4 time.</i>

416
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,800
<i>I met Valerie at the conservatory.</i>

417
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,200
Keep in time.

418
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,600
You're playing too fast.

419
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,300
<i>She must've been about 10.</i>

420
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,300
She had long dark braids
right behind her ears,

421
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,100
little white ankle socks
and a little skirt.

422
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
She was always smiling,

423
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,700
running here and there,
always late.

424
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,800
We used to laugh about it.

425
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,900
I must have been 17 or 18,

426
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,700
and I took her under my wing
right off.

427
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,600
She'd play minuets
and short pieces for me.

428
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,700
I'd try to accompany her.

429
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,400
She went on to make a career
for herself, as you know.

430
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,600
And I'm proud of her.

431
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
I changed instruments.

432
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,300
The piano?

433
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,700
The blunderbuss.

434
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,400
But it's like a horn,
it needs polishing.

435
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,000
Stay on his tail!

436
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
You idiot!

437
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,900
- I think I hit him.
- Where'd he go?

438
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,500
In there.

439
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,900
He came this way.

440
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,500
Say, Remy...

441
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,000
Smell something funny?

442
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,400
- What is it?
- Chickenshit.

443
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,100
We're warm.
Doomsday is near.

444
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,700
Come and look.

445
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,700
Up there by the skylight.
Look, Remy.

446
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,400
Look, Patrick!

447
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,800
It's a pair. It's mating season.

448
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,300
Look at this feather.

449
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,400
It's oily.

450
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,100
The male secretes
a pungent greasy substance

451
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,700
that lures the female.

452
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,300
That's Mother Nature.

453
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,600
<i>Pigeon, winged cloak of grey,</i>

454
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,300
<i>In the city's hellish maw,</i>

455
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,200
<i>One glance and you fly away,</i>

456
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,200
<i>Your grace holds me in awe.</i>

457
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,300
Shit, shit, shit...

458
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,500
Got a problem?

459
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,900
I lost something.

460
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,700
My I.D. Bracelet.
- What?

461
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,900
I lost my I.D. Bracelet.

462
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,900
Goddamn it!

463
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,100
- Sentimental value?
- First Communion.

464
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,300
It's a pain losing it, huh?

465
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,800
It was a pain to steal.

466
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,300
There aren't many kids around
with my first name.

467
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,300
It's worth a small fortune.

468
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,100
I bought it with Dad.

469
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,900
Patrick?

470
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,200
See anything?
- Nothing down here.

471
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,800
Remy!

472
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,300
Look over the railing.

473
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,700
- Here?
- To the left.

474
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,900
Here?
Don't see a thing.

475
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,600
Move up, I see something shiny.

476
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,500
Take a good look. Go up two steps.

477
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,300
There's something shiny
to your right.

478
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,200
Here?

479
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,300
That's not it.

480
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,400
It's just a piece of metal.

481
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,100
This happened to me in Biarritz.
The only time...

482
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,400
Find anything?

483
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,200
...I went swimming with my signet ring,
and lost it among the rocks.

484
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,300
No way of finding it, just like now.

485
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,100
I'd need a metal detector.

486
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Got a zoom lens?

487
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,700
Can you zoom in and find him?

488
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,600
You okay?

489
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,200
Sorry about your pal.
It was an accident.

490
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,800
Stop it, kid, you start like that
and it becomes a habit...

491
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,800
That's revenge... Stop it.

492
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,000
Come on... I understand... Stop it.

493
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,100
I'll buy you a drink at Malou's.

494
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,800
I completely forgot
about this one!

495
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Help me get him in the trunk.

496
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,900
Take his feet.

497
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,000
We'll make it a quick one,
I'm beat.

498
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Hi, Malou, how's life?
- Fine.

499
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,900
Not much action.

500
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,500
Not for now. It'll pick up.

501
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,000
You gotta have hope.

502
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Here you go.

503
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
See anything worthwhile?

504
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,900
I saw a real good boxing match.

505
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,400
<i>The Moroccan featherweight...
A massacre...</i>

506
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
He clobbered little Freddy.

507
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,800
They wipe us out everywhere,
even in the ring. It's amazing.

508
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,300
It's awful.

509
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,800
Real quick on his feet,
the little Moroccan...

510
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,500
And I mean little.
- They all are.

511
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,400
You weren't big
in the ring yourself.

512
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,700
No, but I had a real wallop.

513
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,600
- You sure did.
- That's what counts, the wallop.

514
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,700
Take the train station murder.

515
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,300
The restroom murder.

516
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,600
Who got the headlines? Who?

517
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,100
Come on, who got the headlines?

518
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,900
- The dentist.
- The dental mechanic!

519
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,500
And the toilet attendant
didn't even get a single line!

520
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,100
Little guys don't make waves.

521
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,000
If you kill a whale,

522
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,800
you get Greenpeace
and Jacques Cousteau on your back!

523
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,100
But wipe out sardines
and you get a canning subsidy!

524
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,000
I go for the small fry.

525
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,300
- You're afraid of the big fish.
- What?

526
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,800
- Afraid of the big fish.
- You don't get it! Bug off!

527
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,500
I'd rather talk to him.

528
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,300
I'm not afraid of big stuff, Remy,
honestly I'm not.

529
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,800
I just don't like to make a fuss.

530
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,300
I hate making waves.
I work small and reap big!

531
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,600
But I know the nice suburbs.
Anytime you wanna go!

532
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,800
- Let's go then.
- Whenever you like!

533
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,600
- Not tonight.
- Why not?

534
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,200
Because we lost our sound man,

535
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,900
and without him
I don't feel up to it.

536
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,500
And I still have to dump the cabbie.

537
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,600
I'm going to the quarry,
the canal's a drag.

538
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,200
This one's on me.

539
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,900
Anyway...

540
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,300
The shooting's temporarily on hold.

541
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,600
Patrick, our sound man...

542
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
is dead.

543
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,300
Things like that are
really hard to talk about.

544
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,600
This may sound like a cliche...

545
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,300
But it's an occupational hazard.

546
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,300
We're all aware of that.

547
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,100
I think Patrick was.

548
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,000
And I think we should continue
the film...

549
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,300
because this is your film, Patrick.

550
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,200
That's what I wanted to tell you...

551
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,000
that we're all thinking of you...

552
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,000
and Marie-Paule,

553
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,400
the girl you just moved in with...

554
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,100
who's carrying your child.

555
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,600
So long, Patrick.

556
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,900
Bear up, Marie-Paule.

557
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,000
No, no, that one's much too big.

558
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,700
Too near the street.

559
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,000
Hold on a bit...

560
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,400
Stop here, Remy.

561
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,100
Yeah, here...

562
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,200
You wanted a nice suburban home,
take your pick.

563
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,000
Nice grounds.

564
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,400
All we have to do now is wait.

565
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,200
We wait nice and quiet
until dark.

566
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,000
Hand me a beer.

567
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,700
Who shook up the beers?

568
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,400
I haven't always been...

569
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
Check that out.

570
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,400
Ten years from now
she'll be sucking dick like her mother.

571
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,100
Nature really does things right.

572
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,100
Amazing. And she doesn't even
know it yet.

573
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,200
Doesn't even know
the color of a cock.

574
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,000
Say, Remy, that reminds me...

575
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Aren't there a hell of a lot of gays
in your trade?

576
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,000
In show biz?

577
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,200
You oughta know,
there are more in your trade

578
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,100
than in most normal trades.

579
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,900
You can say what you want.

580
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,800
You don't mind me talking
about it?

581
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,700
Look at Charles Trenet.

582
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,000
Now there's a flagrant case for you.

583
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,300
<i>I think they're all over the place,
you know...</i>

584
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,800
It doesn't bother me personally.

585
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,500
You must know a few.
- Like Cocteau?

586
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,000
No, that's Jean Marais.
But you must know some gays, Andre.

587
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,200
I was watching you three
the other day.

588
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,300
You wouldn't happen to be gay?

589
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,400
No kidding, Remy?

590
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,300
Because I don't mind if you are...
No?

591
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,200
Close the door, Remy.

592
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,200
She'll calm down soon enough.

593
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,000
Honey!

594
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,600
Catherine, get the door!

595
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,600
Who was it, darling?

596
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,500
Andre, Remy!
Does this remind you of anything?

597
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,800
<i>The Old Gun!</i>

598
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,300
Philippe Noiret!
A nice movie.

599
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,900
Franco, over here.

600
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,100
Stick the mike here.

601
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,000
That's my idea.
Fat Noiret didn't do that.

602
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,700
Noiret's put on weight.

603
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,300
Mommy! Mommy!

604
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,600
I lost him.

605
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,400
Kid!

606
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,900
Come on out!

607
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,800
It's just for fun, kid!

608
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,900
Little bugger!

609
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,500
Come on, kid!

610
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,000
You can't stay in the woods alone.

611
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,300
Put out your spotlight.

612
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,700
Put it on!

613
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,200
Get him!

614
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,600
Mommy!

615
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,700
What the fuck are you doing?
Catch him, you morons!

616
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,000
Damn it, he's as turbulent
as his mother!

617
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,700
Remy, gimme a hand,
get his arms and legs.

618
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,800
Filthy kid, goddamn it!

619
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,500
Hold his arms.

620
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,100
Do you kill many children?

621
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,900
No.

622
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,300
You must have noticed that I don't really
have the knack in this department.

623
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,600
This must be my second or third kid
in five years.

624
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,800
Why?

625
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,600
- I don't like infanticide.
- Why not?

626
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,100
Kids aren't good business, Remy.

627
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,500
In theory, they're not bankable,
understand?

628
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,200
You can still make something off him.

629
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,400
You must mean kidnapping.

630
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,400
But I think it's more of a nuisance
than anything else.

631
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,900
Especially
when the media gets involved.

632
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,700
Now hold on,
I'm not talking about you.

633
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,800
You're pretty discreet.
Congrats.

634
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,500
That'll do it.

635
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,000
The little creep really had us going.

636
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,100
Nothing here.

637
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,200
We really blew it.

638
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,000
I warned you about suburban homes.

639
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,400
There are credit cards.

640
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,700
You might as well
call the cops right now.

641
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
Go on. There's the phone.

642
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,000
This is bullshit.

643
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,100
And we're running out
of cash for film.

644
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,400
And we're running out
of cash for film.

645
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,400
The problem's not cash.
That, I have.

646
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,700
It's those three innocents.
There oughta be a law.

647
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,900
Well, I'm... I'm not...

648
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,600
I'm not a lunatic.

649
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,400
It's a shame to let big houses
fall into neglect like this.

650
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,400
Throw a coat of paint
on the walls and mirrors...

651
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,700
and it's Versailles.

652
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,900
Could be, but it'll take more coats
than you think.

653
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,200
Your bad breath is
something awful, Remy.

654
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,400
You shouldn't talk
under people's noses,

655
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,600
because it's really unpleasant.

656
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,900
Watch out for the window, Andre.

657
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,800
Stop bumping into things.

658
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,700
Really! I don't know why,
but all day long

659
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,400
you stink like a billy goat
when you talk loud under people's noses.

660
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,200
Don't mind the mess.

661
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,400
Come on.

662
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,100
How much you need this time?

663
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,200
How much?
- 10,000.

664
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,600
10,000!

665
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,200
Damn it, you spend it faster
than I make it, Remy.

666
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,900
Let me tell you something, Remy,
your spotlight gets on my tits.

667
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Sorry, but there's not enough light.

668
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,500
I know, but yesterday with the kid
it blinded me and disrupted my work.

669
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,400
- I'm sorry.
- Sure, you're sorry.

670
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,200
Here, for your bad breath...
have a candy.

671
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,500
Right before he died, I told him,

672
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,700
"Come on,
we've got enough footage.

673
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,000
We've got enough sound."

674
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And he said,

675
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,900
"We'll never have enough."

676
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,100
He was a charming boy...

677
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,600
who wouldn't compromise...

678
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,500
We're all thinking of you, Franco,

679
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,200
and this film's dedicated to you.

680
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,200
And I'm thinking of Marie-Paule,
your girlfriend...

681
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,100
who's carrying...

682
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,100
your child.

683
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,800
Ricardo Giovanni,
alias the Nightingale.

684
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,100
Capable but dissolute,
much too dissolute.

685
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,200
Like all Mediterraneans.

686
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,100
Come on out.

687
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,900
Holy shit!

688
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,000
A camera crew. Know 'em?

689
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,700
I'm a director. This is my team...

690
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,600
Holy smoke, Andre!
Get a load of the big camera!

691
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,400
This is real fancy material.
Don't you want it?

692
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,600
No, it's video.

693
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,500
- And what's ours?
- Film.

694
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,400
Let's take advantage
of our luck, Remy.

695
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,600
This one's for you.

696
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,000
That makes 68 francs...

697
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,700
Here you go.

698
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,300
Do you have any room, sir?
I'll give you a bag.

699
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,700
180 grams. All right?

700
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,900
For once we have something
to celebrate...

701
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,400
Don't tell her! I'll have some...

702
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,400
Well, it's a French drink...

703
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,000
Malaga wine.
- There is none.

704
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
- Some Muscat.
- There's no Muscat.

705
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,200
- No alcohol?
- None at all.

706
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,300
- A Coke?
- That, I have.

707
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,200
Ice cold.

708
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,600
No, thank you.

709
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,700
Grandma's not here?

710
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,400
She's in the store.

711
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,900
But I can still have
something else.

712
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,100
What?

713
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,000
What I had with Hugues.

714
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,500
- Port wine.
- Port!

715
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,300
Be careful,
he's not allowed to drink.

716
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,800
Don't give him a drink.
He shouldn't.

717
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,000
- Why not?
- He's been sick.

718
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,000
- Really?
- Yes, indeed.

719
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,100
What did he have?

720
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,600
Vascular spasms.
He could get a heart attack.

721
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,200
So be careful.
He mustn't overdo it.

722
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,500
One glass...
He forgets, too.

723
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,900
He forgets what he drinks,
and that makes it even worse.

724
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,600
Understand?
- Yes, sure.

725
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,300
He doesn't realize it.

726
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,800
You promise?

727
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,600
I have two pairs of panties of...
Brigitte Bardot's.

728
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,900
The fellow was in raptures.

729
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,500
But I tell him
it's 200 francs a pair.

730
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,500
In those days, 200 francs
was a lot for the time.

731
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,100
So we make a deal.

732
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,100
But I still had
to pick up the panties

733
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,700
at the department store.

734
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,200
I buy the panties, I rumple them,
I come back.

735
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,500
- You bought two pairs?
- Two pairs?

736
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,700
No, just one...

737
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,300
So I give him one and I say,
"There are the panties."

738
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,600
And I get my 200 francs.

739
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,000
So for 200 francs,
I sold Brigitte Bardot's panties.

740
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,500
In those days, that's at least
1,000 francs nowadays.

741
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,400
In those days.
- He still thinks it's her real panties?

742
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
I think he does.

743
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,000
I recently asked him
if he still had them.

744
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,300
He says, "I still got 'em."

745
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,500
It's a true story.

746
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,000
I think the chubby one there
was Grandma's sister.

747
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,100
Switch on the lights, Remy.

748
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,000
These old films are just charming.

749
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,200
Just charming.

750
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,600
Grandpa didn't do so badly
with his tiny material.

751
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,400
I love watching them.

752
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,100
You're gonna break 'em.
Just take it easy with those.

753
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,100
Let's go downstairs
before you break everything.

754
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,700
What did I tell you?

755
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,300
- I think...
- I've had enough.

756
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,500
- Do you want an orange?
- No, I don't like fruit.

757
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,500
Are you sure?

758
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,600
They killed a child...

759
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,200
But just before,
they killed his parents.

760
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,500
So he saw his parents being killed.
Can you imagine?

761
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,000
I swear if they did that
to a child of mine, I'd slaughter 'em.

762
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,800
And with me, there'd be no trial.

763
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,200
I'd be judge and jury myself!

764
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,300
Has Roger been around
the ring lately?

765
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,300
- Who?
- Roger.

766
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,300
Haven't seen him in a while.
Why?

767
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,000
I hear he's boxing again.

768
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,900
I don't know what happened.

769
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,600
Kalifa.

770
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,800
Tell the gentleman
how you got your job here.

771
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,200
Mr. Benoit got it for me.

772
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,200
You haven't come to see me
in a while.

773
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,900
What?
- I didn't know.

774
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,600
I can't hear you.

775
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,800
I didn't know
where you were, sir.

776
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,100
And no kiss from Benichou?

777
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,500
He doesn't look happy to see me.

778
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,300
The boy looks pale.

779
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,800
Come see me after the fight.
I'll give you some money.

780
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,200
Buy him a new satchel.

781
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,800
And buy yourself some shoes.
You look like a gypsy.

782
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Film lovers!

783
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,000
Film lovers, good evening!

784
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,200
Tonight, for one showing only...

785
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,300
My big dick!

786
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,000
You're not gonna start that again?

787
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,300
Film lovers,
a slight change of program...

788
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,300
You're gonna see
Malou's great big tits.

789
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,400
Malou! Your tits!

790
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,200
Cut it out, Ben!

791
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,400
You've gone far enough.
- Okay, okay.

792
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,900
I've had it with your grossness.

793
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,600
- What'll it be, Remy?
- Another one.

794
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,500
A Dead Baby Boy.

795
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,100
No more beer,
you're having a Dead Baby Boy.

796
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,900
How about you?
- A Dead Baby Boy.

797
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,900
- And the new guy?
- A screwdriver.

798
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,600
You're having a Dead Baby Boy
with the rest of us!

799
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,600
Malou! Four Dead Baby Boys!

800
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,000
What's that?

801
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,400
What is it?
- A Dead Baby Boy?

802
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,800
It's dynamite.

803
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,500
You'll see.

804
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,900
Malou, make 'em stiff!

805
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,800
You know your problem?

806
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,400
It's your temper,
it does you wrong.

807
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,800
I wonder why.

808
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,000
- It does you wrong.
- No, it doesn't.

809
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,100
It'll do you wrong soon.

810
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,500
Quit laughing, you half-wit!

811
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,100
Stop hitting me, creep!

812
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,000
Holy shit.

813
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,200
Are you ugly when you laugh!

814
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,700
It's unbelievable!

815
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,200
He's so ugly when he laughs!

816
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,000
You should have let me
film him, Andre.

817
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,300
Serve us up.

818
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,400
A tear of gin.

819
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,900
Just a tear.

820
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,600
A river of tonic...

821
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,100
And then...

822
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,800
the little victim:

823
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,800
One part olive,

824
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,800
one part sugar cube,

825
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,400
and one part piece of string.

826
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,000
And there's our Dead Baby Boy.

827
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,800
A quick ratio quiz:

828
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,900
How much ballast does it take
to sink a dead kid?

829
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,400
Remy?

830
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,100
How many times
the kid's body weight?

831
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,300
Twice his weight!

832
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,300
Shut up and let Remy answer.
Twice his weight, correct.

833
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,500
Why? Because his bones are...
- Porous!

834
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,300
If I'm boring you, just say so.

835
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,400
You're not even paying attention.

836
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,700
Now you take
your Dead Baby Boy

837
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,200
and sink it.

838
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,000
And you wait and see.

839
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,800
When the olive rises...

840
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,700
Whichever comes up first

841
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,400
is the loser,
and buys the next round.

842
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,100
It's as simple as that.

843
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,900
Goddamn it.
I get my jacket soaked

844
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,400
every time I serve a drink.

845
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,000
You lose!

846
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,300
Shit.

847
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,900
Malou, set up another round.

848
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,300
Andre's second...

849
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,300
Remy's third.

850
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,100
That was a nice little package,
Vincent.

851
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,600
Sucker.
He's a sucker.

852
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,800
I'll buy the next one.

853
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,000
I think...

854
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,800
I'll eat my Dead Baby Boy.

855
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,700
Waste not, want not.

856
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,300
Never swallow the string.

857
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,800
That was a great one!

858
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,000
Get out!
I've had it with you!

859
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,400
Just say I disgust you!

860
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,700
All because I have some faults!

861
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,100
<i>Cinema.!</i>

862
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,200
I'll go because I am cinema!

863
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,200
<i>From screen to screen,
film to film,</i>

864
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,900
<i>I gave you my life,</i>

01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,100

868
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,700
All together now!

869
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,000
Get a shot of me while I piss,
that's it!

870
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Come on, you jerks!

871
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,600
<i>In the port of shadows,</i>

872
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,900
<i>sings Michele Morgan.</i>

873
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,100

<i>He put it so nicely, thatJean.</i>

875
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,200

<i>Hush, not a sound,

01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,600
<i>Hush, not a sound,
It's the night round.</i>

882
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,400
<i>With diligence,</i>

883
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,300
<i>Keep the silence,</i>

884
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,000
<i>Onward without a sound.</i>

885
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,800
Your turn.

886
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,100
Don't move!

887
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,200
I'll blow his brains out!

888
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,000
What's your wife's name?

889
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,100
Martine.

890
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,700
I like to know a woman
before making her come.

891
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,700
You're all beasts.
It takes a little gentleness.

892
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,100
Like a little bird
coming home to roost.

893
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,000
Like a little piggy.

894
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,300
Filthy slut.

895
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,100
See that?
She's moaning!

896
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,800
<i>After my tour</i>

897
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,500
the concierge gave me this.

898
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,800
It'd been in a box for 3 days.
It began to stink.

899
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,300
I had a shock!

900
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,600
I didn't know
if I should wait to show you.

901
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,900
You did the right thing.
Put it away now.

902
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,800
- I had to show you.
- You did right.

903
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,600
- Know what it means?
- Don't worry, I know.

904
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,300
You see, Remy,

905
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,400
at that hideout I wasted
an Italian named Giovanni.

906
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,600
Well, this is a warning
from his brother.

907
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,000
I knew he'd turn up someday,

908
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,400
but it's just a warning.

909
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,400
Don't worry, Valerie,
just burn it and forget about it.

910
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,900
They're just Italians...
Small-time.

911
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,500
He hasn't been working out regularly.

912
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,100
Paul, go and work with Karim.

913
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,200
- Does it hurt?
- A bit.

914
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,300
But that's normal.

915
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,000
I'm starting to get
some movement again.

916
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,300
- Are you?
- Sure.

917
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,700
Just look.

918
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,400
Good for you.

919
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,900
Careful, don't exert yourself.

920
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,900
Don't overdo it.

921
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,500
I'll be on my feet
in a couple of weeks.

922
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,200
When you're young,
you're in shape soon enough.

923
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,100
When you've got your youth,
you mend quickly.

924
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,600
You can be sure of that.

925
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,300
Modern medicine works wonders.

926
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,500
The things they can do today.

927
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,900
I always warned him
this would happen.

928
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,100
It was a great match.

929
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,100
That's the way sports are.

930
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:54,000
All that running around,
it's like soccer, you murder each other.

931
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,400
Mom got a rat in the mail.

932
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,800
A skewered rat!

933
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,700
Really? A skewered rat?

934
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,600
I know who sent it.

935
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,800
It's those Taviers again.

936
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,400
Guess what they did
just recently?

937
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,600
They pissed in
Madam Joquet's mailbox!

938
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,000
All her letters soaked through,

939
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,800
everything ruined.

940
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,700
Unreadable.

941
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,700
Why, did you read them?

942
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,000
It hurts to laugh.

943
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,800
When you see something like that...

944
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,800
But just look
at that poor man there...

945
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,600
His children don't even
come to visit.

946
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,800
What a shame.
- It's a shame.

947
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,000
- Does he have kids?
- I think so.

948
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,900
He must have children,
but he never gets any visits.

949
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,200
Don't you smell something?

950
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,700
A bit.

951
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,800
Chickenshit?
- Not that.

952
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,700
It smells like shit.
- Could be.

953
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,100
Did you make caca?

954
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,200
Did you make caca?

955
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,000
Thank you.

956
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,600
That's kind of you,
but don't bother.

957
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,900
You did make caca!

958
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:22,100
I'm all right.
It's fine like that.

959
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,200
I'll ring for the nurse.

960
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,900
What for?

961
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,100
He shits all day long.

962
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,700
It doesn't bother you?

963
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:36,000
It's like this all day, and he sings too.

964
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,800
Shits and sings,
that's all he can do.

965
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,400
He's a pharmacist.

966
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,800
You again?

967
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,200
You're just in time
for a real treat.

968
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,600
- We did a big caca!
- I did it just for you.

969
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,000
<i>I shit for nights,
I shit for days,</i>

970
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,300
<i>I shit all over,
I shit always.</i>

971
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,300
If you'd only behave.
Behave!

972
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,900
If you don't have looks,
at least have manners.

973
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,900
You want to repeat that?

974
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,500
I'm here to do my job agreeably!

975
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,300
If you call that work...
You enjoy it.

976
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,400
You love shit, eh?
You sure raise a stink over crap!

977
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,800
I give you plenty,
but you're never happy.

978
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,700
I'll change you.

979
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,000
Count your blessings!

980
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,400
- You could leave me as I am.
- Wallowing in shit?

981
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,500
You enjoy it.

982
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,200
You'd be mad
if there wasn't enough!

983
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,600
- Lucky they're not all like him.
- You'll get your money's worth.

984
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,700
Let's go, my girl.

985
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,900
<i>I shit for nights,
I shit for days,</i>

986
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,900
<i>I shit all over,
I shit always.</i>

987
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,700
Take care of yourself.
And we'll go out

988
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,300
and have that drink
when you're out and about.

989
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,100
Talk about surprises,

990
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,800
this takes the cake.

991
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,100
Were you in on this?

992
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,600
Hi, Jenny.

993
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,800
This is a hell of a surprise.

994
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,100
Already rolling?

995
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:16,700
It sure is nice to see people
in the pink.

996
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,600
You're all fixed now.

997
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,000
How's the hip, Jenny?

998
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,300
- Getting better.
- Watch yourself.

999
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,900
You too, Valerie,
with all those drugs you take.

1000
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,000
Especially the pill!

1001
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,600
Let's have some cake.

1002
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,600
Just a small piece,

1003
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,400
I already ate at the hospital.

1004
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,300
For me, a big piece,
like my piece!

1005
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,400
It's worth tasting.

1006
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,400
Here's to Ben.

1007
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,700
- For me?
- From the whole crew.

1008
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,700
How thoughtful.

1009
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,800
Thanks, Andre, Vincent.
- Happy birthday, Ben.

1010
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,000
What is it?

1011
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,400
It's not very heavy.
It can't be a bomb.

1012
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,700
I'll open it.

1013
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:36,000
That's a great idea.

1014
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,700
A holster.

1015
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,500
Just the right color.
Who picked it out?

1016
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,800
- Andre.
- Thanks so much.

1017
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,100
It was the perfect choice.

1018
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,100
Help me put it on, Remy.

1019
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
It's just what I needed,
but never thought of it myself.

1020
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,900
Quality leather, too.

1021
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,600
Can you get me my revolver?
I'll try it right now.

1022
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,700
Found it, Valerie?

1023
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,200
It's superb.

1024
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,700
What freedom of movement,
what a difference!

1025
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,700
You can really move around
in a thing like this.

1026
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,600
May I have some more bubbly?

1027
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,200
Another present?

1028
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,400
You're spoiling me.
- Aren't we?

1029
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,000
What is it?

1030
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,200
- It's a beauty.
- I thought so.

1031
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,000
It's a real pleasure.

1032
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,100
It's a splendid seagull.
Got it in the frame?

1033
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,400
Isn't it nice?

1034
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,200
A fine gull.

1035
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,800
Have some more cake.

1036
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,700
I haven't finished my first slice.

1037
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,600
Anyway, I'm not that hungry.

1038
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,300
That's sweet of you, Jenny.

1039
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,000
You're welcome, sir.

1040
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,600
If you like it.

1041
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,000
You don't have to call me "sir."

1042
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,800
What's this "sir" business
all of a sudden?

1043
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,600
True, I don't always say "sir."

1044
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,500
How can I say it...

1045
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,700
- You're moved?
- I'm moved...

1046
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,800
By that pretty creature!

1047
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,900
We can forget it.

1048
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,500
Take a look.

1049
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:35,800
What the hell are you doing?

1050
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,000
I can still see a huge bundle
from up here!

1051
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,000
Do I have to come
and do it myself?

1052
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,700
Cover all that up!

1053
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,200
Remy, I can see legs sticking out!

1054
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,100
Don't just stand there!

1055
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,700
You have nothing better
to do than film, Andre?

1056
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,300
You faggot!

1057
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,800
<i>Am I on television?</i>

1058
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,200
Shouldn't have done it like that.

1059
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,500
I should have thrown him
on the crates and hit him.

1060
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,900
He had me waltzing like a skirt.

1061
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,800
He had time to kick me
in the nuts.

1062
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,000
I can't move in this thing.

1063
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,500
He got out of that nicely.

1064
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,900
You could have given me
a hand there.

1065
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,400
I didn't expect...

1066
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,100
Teamwork means being able
to count on your colleagues.

1067
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:12,200
But I couldn't count on you
this time, right or wrong?

1068
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:14,800
Right.

1069
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,100
It's a shame.

1070
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,700
And stop making faces
behind my back.

1071
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,700
<i>Thejury handed down its verdict
late this afternoon.</i>

1072
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:47,600
<i>For the last time, Benoit Patard
stood in the dock,</i>

1073
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,700
<i>a sardonic grin on his face,</i>

1074
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,800
<i>and his usual smug,
arrogant glint in his eye.</i>

1075
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,200
<i>Don't talk to me about other murders
until these are proven.</i>

1076
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,400
A harsh verdict
for such evidence?

1077
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,000
Yes. I will be consulting my client
to decide if we'll appeal.

1078
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,200
That's all I have to say.
Thank you.

1079
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,200
Counsellor!

1080
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,200
What would you like me
to bring you?

1081
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,400
Nothing.

1082
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,600
Don't say that.

1083
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,600
We always need something.

1084
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,900
What can I bring you
from the store?

1085
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,800
I'll come see you often, I promise.

1086
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,800
How often can I come?

1087
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:37,900
I have no idea.

1088
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,700
They didn't tell you yet?

1089
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,300
Bring cigarettes.

1090
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,600
- Smoking's allowed?
- Yes, it's allowed.

1091
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,900
I'll bring some,
but you need food...

1092
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,400
Cigarettes aren't enough.

1093
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,800
I don't believe it.

1094
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:01,000
I don't believe anything they say.
I really don't.

1095
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,600
I'm so sad,

1096
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,800
but whatever happens,
I'll always come.

1097
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,700
<i>Remy, it's Ben.</i>

1098
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,400
<i>I escaped.</i>

1099
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,400
<i>Meet me in two hours.</i>

1100
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,400
<i>First, pick up Valerie.</i>

1101
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,100
<i>Meet me
where we met the first time.</i>

1102
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,000
<i>I'd written a poem about autumn.</i>

1103
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,300
<i>A thousand leaves mingle</i>

1104
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,300
<i>In the misty breeze</i>

1105
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,900
<i>Plump brown chestnuts</i>

1106
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,800
<i>Pummel the ground,
Yet I remain unharmed.</i>

1107
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,100
<i>The cold spews scorn
At summer's dying twitch,</i>

1108
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,200
<i>Which with a last lazy stroke</i>

1109
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,600
<i>Warms my limbs aching
From another assault</i>

1110
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,100
<i>Without trumpets or banners,</i>

1111
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,400
<i>See it, here it comes.</i>

1112
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,900
<i>The splendid autumn.</i>

1113
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,000
- Hi, Ben.
- Valerie's not with you?

1114
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,100
She was to meet us here.

1115
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,100
Can I have a cigarette?

1116
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,800
How'd the jailbreak go?

1117
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,600
Take off, Remy.

1118
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,300
Where to?

1119
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,400
To Valerie's.

1120
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,500
Valerie!

1121
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:41,100
- Water's no good for flutes.
- Think shit's good for scales?

1122
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,100
Is it serious?

1123
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:08,000
Mom wasn't a musician!
Is that what you want to know?

1124
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,800
She got hers with a broom!

1125
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,500
Sorry, Remy...
I'm sorry, kid.

1126
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,500
I want to get some things
out of the closet.

1127
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,500
It was a great hideout.

1128
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,200
- Sorry?
- I said it was a great hideout.

1129
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,800
- What'll you do now?
- What?

1130
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,600
What do you plan to do now?

1131
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,900
I don't know...
Leave, in any case.

1132
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,500
Got a place to go?
Where you know somebody?

1133
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,400
So you're here, too.

1134
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,500
Let's recite, Remy.

1135
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,800
<i>Pigeon...</i>

1136
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,300
<i>winged cloaked of...</i>

1137
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,900
<i>... Grey.</i>

1138
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,400
<i>In the city's hellish maw...</i>

1139
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:35,600
<i>One glance and you fly away...
You've got it.</i>

1140
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,500
<i>Your grace...</i>
