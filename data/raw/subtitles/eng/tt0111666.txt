1
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:09,727
Sir! Would you like to buy stamps
to help people with tuberculosis?

2
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,246
Help fight
people with tuberculosis!

3
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,286
It's for cancer!

4
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:25,606
You boys from Longeverne
aren't very quick.

5
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:28,326
The boys from Velrans already
hit me for two books of stamps.

6
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:30,966
And that was at least an hour ago.

7
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:33,606
Two? Why did you buy from them
since you are from Longevernes?

8
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:37,086
It's because the sick can't wait.

9
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:40,405
You don't mess around
with sickness, you know?

10
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,445
Watch out!

11
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:45,745
Everything's fine
as long as you're healthy.

12
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,165
But when you're sick...

13
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:51,405
You don't mess around
with sickness.

14
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:54,284
Everything's fine
as long as you're healthy.

15
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:58,124
But when your health goes, you
can't mess around with sickness.

16
00:02:58,324 --> 00:03:00,044
Which one do we attack?

17
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:03,525
The priest!
He can't turn us down. Father!

18
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:06,684
- Would you like some stamps?
- It's for a good cause!

19
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,284
Darn it!
He's already got some, too!

20
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:12,484
On top of that,
he made us miss Nestor.

21
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:15,763
Let's run after him!
He has to walk his bike uphill.

22
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,282
How dare you
try selling me stamps?

23
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:34,483
I'll show you
what I think of that!

24
00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:37,762
Hey, you jerks from Velrans!
He's our mailman, not yours.

25
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:40,802
We can forget about the priest,
but Nestor belongs to us.

26
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:42,122
You can't sell him stamps.

27
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:45,802
Nestor? From Longeverne?
He belongs to all of France.

28
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:49,162
- That's right! Nobody owns him.
- Go ahead, call us jerks again.

29
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:51,961
- Jerks! Jerks!
- Thieves! Mailman stealers!

30
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:54,001
You people from Longeverne
have soft balls!

31
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,321
What does that mean?

32
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:01,361
Everyone from Longeverne
has soft balls!

33
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,361
Beat it!

34
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:06,121
Get lost, losers!

35
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:08,641
I'm gonna tell--

36
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,280
I'm gonna tell Lebraque.

37
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,280
Guys, the first bell's ringing!

38
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,000
I thought he said "snowballs."

39
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,640
- Hi, Gibus.
- Hi.

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,880
I knew I shouldn't have went.

41
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,359
- What happened?
- Some Velrans jerks ambushed us.

42
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,879
- They pelted us with stones.
- Then they said we were snowballs.

43
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,959
- They didn't call us that.
- So what did they call us?

44
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:42,958
What names? What names?

45
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,958
Well, we didn't really understand.

46
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:47,278
- Let's go ask Lebraque.
- Yeah!

47
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:50,758
What names? What names? Tell me!

48
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:55,398
Stamp sale to raise funds
for the fight against tuberculosis.

49
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:04,637
Here come the Gibus brothers.

50
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:06,678
What happened?

51
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:23,357
What do you want?

52
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:31,476
So... what do you want?

53
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:34,836
Sir, are there any bad words
with "soft" in them?

54
00:05:36,396 --> 00:05:38,476
You're asking me that?

55
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:40,796
I don't know any bad words.

56
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:42,875
My eye!

57
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,796
Come on, what's the baddest
bad word that has "soft" in it?

58
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:50,115
"Balls," we know, everybody's
got them. But why "soft"?

59
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,435
We don't care, but we must
find out if it's nasty.

60
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:54,915
Guys!

61
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:56,955
Even the teacher
doesn't know what it is.

62
00:05:57,115 --> 00:06:01,235
- You moron! You told him?
- Yeah, but not to his face.

63
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,475
Hey, you're smart, little Gibus.

64
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:05,474
Move out of my way.

65
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:12,274
Hey, Gaston, come here.

66
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:17,874
- Where's your father?
- Over there.

67
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:20,674
Go call your father "soft balls."

68
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,513
- He'll give you some candy.
- Will I have to give it to you?

69
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,713
It's okay, you can keep it.
Go, and don't forget!

70
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,393
Soft balls, soft balls, soft balls.

71
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:42,352
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

72
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,632
All right, settle down.

73
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:52,711
- Finished counting, Lacrique?
- Yes, sir, it's a piece of cake.

74
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:58,351
Hey, Camus, did he come out yet?
- No.

75
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:07,271
Groucoulard: none sold. Tintin:
none sold. Camus: one sold.

76
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,591
- That will make the count uneven.
- Boulon--

77
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,950
Here he comes!

78
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,990
Back in your seats everyone.
Camus, sit down!

79
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,990
Lebraque!

80
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:36,229
Tonight, we'll show the Velrans...

81
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,349
if we have soft balls.

82
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:51,949
- Come on, guys.
- We've been running pretty fast.

83
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:54,788
- Did you bring the chalk?
- I've got my pockets full of it.

84
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:57,708
Guys, guys! Wait for me!

85
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:00,389
Sorry, my parents
won't let me go without him.

86
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:03,668
You really look stupid. Let's go.

87
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:10,668
Why don't we take the road?

88
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:14,067
- The rabbits' way is faster.
- No way, we'll tear our pants.

89
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,867
Just do like everyone else
I'm the chief.

90
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:21,587
I didn't say I wasn't coming.

91
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,987
But to have chiefs,
you need a vote.

92
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:28,147
You must be kidding.

93
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:31,906
- Who knows about ranks?
- Me! Captain. That's a big one.

94
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:37,027
I know a guy who's a sergeant. He's
smart. He finished the 7th grade.

95
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:41,426
Yes, but the best is being
a first class soldier.

96
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:45,266
So, that means that there are
second class soldiers...

97
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:49,785
- and also "freight class" soldiers.
- Do we vote or choose our rank?

98
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:54,466
Let's choose. I'll
be a second class colonel.

99
00:08:54,665 --> 00:09:00,185
Better yet, a locomotive colonel
or a luggage wagon colonel.

100
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:04,825
- You're really starting to bug us.
- But we need to have chiefs.

101
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:09,344
You know, in real life, the chief
is the one with the biggest weenie.

102
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:18,944
Just look at dogs... and goats...
and rams... and foxes.

103
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:20,944
It's the same everywhere.

104
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:36,983
- Come on, take off your shoes.
- What are we gonna do?

105
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:38,982
You'll see. Shh!

106
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:11,101
You go first.

107
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:12,621
Who? Me?

108
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,221
He won't pay attention to a kid
carrying a milk can.

109
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,020
He'll go back inside.

110
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,300
- What am I gonna tell him?
- Nothing, just walk past him.

111
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,020
Are you a colonel or what?
So, just follow the orders.

112
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,340
I knew I shouldn't have went.

113
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:43,059
Are you the one who's making
the dogs bark?

114
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:05,658
My brother! What are we gonna do?

115
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:08,858
Come, my little one.

116
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:11,738
Sit here.

117
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,977
- Has the cat got your tongue?
- He must be in shock.

118
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:17,857
You gave him such a scare.
You're always yelling.

119
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:20,937
- I didn't yell, I spoke.
- You should have shut your mouth.

120
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:24,337
Hello, little guy.
If I shut up, he won't talk.

121
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:25,857
You scared him.

122
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:30,857
Let's give him a little nip.
We can't leave him like that.

123
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:33,456
Soft balls.

124
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:38,416
A little shot of calvados
never hurt anyone.

125
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:42,897
That will make you run
like a rabbit, you'll see.

126
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:50,656
- Yeah.
- That's it.

127
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:52,856
Soft balls.

128
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:58,056
- He's at the Laztecs.
- We've got to go.

129
00:11:58,215 --> 00:12:00,415
Go watch the corner.

130
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:03,775
Give me the chalk.

131
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:07,575
Stay with me, Lacrique, in case
I spell something the wrong way.

132
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,974
Are you feeling better?

133
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:33,414
What's he saying?

134
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:37,694
- What are you saying?
- I... I spilled my milk.

135
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:39,853
He's just upset about his milk.

136
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:43,213
It's only a half gallon of milk.
We'll give you some.

137
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:45,773
We'll give you some.

138
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,813
- Henri, go fill his can.
- What?

139
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:51,212
I'm doing my homework.

140
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:55,492
- I told you to go get him milk.
- I'm not at his service.

141
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:57,972
Well, we'll see about that.
Go now.

142
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,252
All right. Okay.

143
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:05,372
Go ahead, make even more noise.

144
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:09,811
- It was good.
- You like it, huh?

145
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:17,971
Put an "S" there.

146
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:26,531
- Watch out, here comes a car.
- Done.

147
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:32,131
ALL THE VELRANS ARE CREEPS

148
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,010
- We showed them.
- Yeah, and good luck erasing it!

149
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,050
My little brother!
I lost him.

150
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:54,249
Good night, my good people.

151
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,649
<i>My pants are bursting
at the seams</i>

152
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,649
He learns fast, uh?

153
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:12,248
He's drunk as a skunk.

154
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:24,528
- Hey, little Gibus!
- He must've emptied their cellar.

155
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:32,967
<i>My pants are bursting
at the seams</i>

156
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:37,007
<i>If it keeps going
you're gonna see my--</i>

157
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,206
Quiet. We're fishing.

158
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:06,645
Your umbrella, little Gibus.

159
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:11,565
Quickly.

160
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:15,165
Give me the worms.

161
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,565
- Is that enough?
- Yeah.

162
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,644
Look, I can see myself.

163
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:26,564
Do the fish see the real me...

164
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:30,244
- or do they see me like this?
- Why do you care?

165
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:34,004
Because, if they see me like this,
it must scare them to death.

166
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:42,083
- The Velrans!
- Show yourselves!

167
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:45,243
Creeps, losers, pigs.

168
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:49,243
Here I am.
You don't need to scream, fartface.

169
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:52,363
- Fartface yourself.
- Come on, get over here.

170
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:56,203
We don't need to get closer,
you smell rotten from here.

171
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:59,483
- Your sister is--
- My sister pees on your head.

172
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:00,802
Something wrong with that?

173
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:04,042
Your parents
can't pay their mortgage!

174
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:05,362
Mortgage yourself!

175
00:16:05,522 --> 00:16:07,722
Are you gonna
come fight us or what?

176
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:10,122
Do you think you're gonna get us?

177
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:13,482
Wait 'til we get to you tomorrow,
you creeps from Velrans.

178
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:17,881
You'll get your butt kicked
by the soft balls from Longeverne.

179
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,122
Take shelter
behind the umbrella, everyone!

180
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:27,241
- The bastards.
- That's not fair.

181
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:40,281
Let's go! It's Mr. Schaefer!
He's blind as a bat!

182
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,800
- Camus, grab the oars.
- Hide, little Gibus.

183
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,040
And you, Boulon, move it!

184
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,239
Got it!

185
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,319
So did you figure out
how much a pound of apples costs?

186
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:09,719
Yeah, it's 150,000 francs...

187
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:12,238
point 3333 and some change.

188
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,359
So are we at war?

189
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:34,358
- Why is he going to our bathroom?
- Why doesn't he use his own?

190
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:43,837
"General Mobilization
To hell with the Velrans!"

191
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:46,797
To hell with the Velrans!

192
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,354
Are you crazy or what?

193
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:38,794
- To hell with the Velrans!
- Did anybody see my glasses?

194
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:46,434
Wait. Let's hide here
and take some prisoners.

195
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:56,313
Degalle! Migue The Moon!
Get Lebraque!

196
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:12,152
Ready, guys? I got one.

197
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:23,232
Hurrah, we got Migue The Moon!

198
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:30,751
- You're dead meat.
- You're trapped like a rat.

199
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:33,071
Let's lynch him.

200
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,030
Is it true that
you torture prisoners?

201
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:39,871
You haven't seen anything yet.
Give me your knife, Camus.

202
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:46,191
What are you gonna do to me?

203
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,270
Move back, so that everybody sees.

204
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:55,669
- What should we cut off?
- His ears! His tongue!

205
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,310
- His snoot!
- Let's cut off his weenie.

206
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,710
If you touch me,
I'll tell the priest and the mayor.

207
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,949
How are you gonna do it?
You won't have a tongue anymore.

208
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:05,989
And no weenie, either.

209
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:07,989
- Should we start from the top?
- Yeah.

210
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:10,549
Ears first. Hold him tight.

211
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:14,389
Please, Lebraque! Please don't!

212
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,149
Chicken. It's only
the back of the knife.

213
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,189
- Is everyone like you in Velrans?
- You're not even bleeding.

214
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:24,228
We should put him in a cave
and go fart, one after the other.

215
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:28,148
It would be like a gas chamber.

216
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:31,148
- Now let's get...
- No! No!

217
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:32,708
...serious.

218
00:20:32,868 --> 00:20:35,548
I don't care about your ears,
your snoot or your weenie.

219
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:37,188
Only one thing matters to a man.

220
00:20:37,347 --> 00:20:41,587
His honor. And in five minutes,
you won't be proud of yourself.

221
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,988
No, Lebraque! Please don't!

222
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:52,347
Where does he get
all these ideas from?

223
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,305
Now, go see your priest
and your mayor.

224
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:44,984
<i>We sing all the way to Victory</i>

225
00:21:45,143 --> 00:21:48,503
<i>As she awaits us with open arms</i>

226
00:21:48,664 --> 00:21:52,144
<i>Freedom guides our steps</i>

227
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:55,903
<i>From the north to the south</i>

228
00:21:56,063 --> 00:22:00,063
<i>the Trumpet of War</i>

229
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:02,783
<i>sounds the charge</i>

230
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:05,783
Fourth requirement:

231
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:08,983
you must register to vote...

232
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:10,862
at your town hall.

233
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:12,622
- Hey, Lebraque.
- What?

234
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:16,502
- They said they'd be back tonight.
- Then we'll thrash them again.

235
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:19,102
Tell the others and
go hide again in your tree.

236
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:20,862
Lebraque.

237
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:22,902
What are the requirements
to be able to vote?

238
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:32,141
- Let's meet tonight at the quarry.
- I've warned you before, Lebraque.

239
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:35,702
- Watch out for detention.
- Please not tonight, sir.

240
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:38,741
I'm still waiting. What does it
take to be able to vote?

241
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:45,821
You must know your geography.

242
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:49,621
Be quiet, Macailler. It doesn't
hurt to know your geography.

243
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,620
But that's not enough
to be a voter.

244
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:56,021
- You must be from that country?
- What country?

245
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,140
France.

246
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,340
All right.

247
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,860
What else?

248
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,580
This is not the day
to get detention.

249
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:11,579
Could you be a voter?

250
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:13,499
- No, sir.
- Why?

251
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:21,219
Because you don't have hair
on your ass yet.

252
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,579
- What did you say, Lacrique?
- I said that, uh... uh...

253
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:28,498
- What?
- It's because he's too young, sir.

254
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,778
Excellent answer.

255
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:31,618
Big Gibus!
You're staying after class.

256
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:33,298
- Sir, please--
- You too, Lebraque!

257
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:36,299
It's not his fault. I was the one
whispering the answers to him.

258
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,818
Then you'll join them in detention.

259
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:42,138
Those dummies, now we're short
three guys. I'll have to lead.

260
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,857
Fourth requirement: you must
register to vote at the town hall.

261
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,217
Fifth requirement:

262
00:23:53,737 --> 00:23:55,577
Hurry. We're late.

263
00:24:05,496 --> 00:24:10,056
What's happening? What are you
doing down there?

264
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,456
I can't see anymore! I can't see!

265
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:15,336
- Give me back my bandage.
- What are you doing here?

266
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:19,416
I knew I shouldn't have went!

267
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:22,576
What would you have done?
They had at least ten extra guys.

268
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:25,856
- Where are the others?
- I don't know. They're all over.

269
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:29,056
What a thrashing.

270
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:31,575
- You guys look pitiful.
- Hey, we were outnumbered.

271
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:34,575
That's no excuse. One Longeverne is
worth ten of those Velrans creeps!

272
00:24:44,414 --> 00:24:46,014
Come and get me.

273
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:48,694
You can play tough now but you'll
have to come down sooner or later.

274
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,174
Sooner or later, I'll have to pee,
and guess who will get hosed?

275
00:24:52,373 --> 00:24:55,133
Guys, guys.
Here comes Lebraque.

276
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:58,814
You two, block his retreat.
Everybody else with me.

277
00:25:13,653 --> 00:25:16,493
Watch out, Lebraque,
they're stalking y--

278
00:25:22,252 --> 00:25:23,412
Lebraque.

279
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:26,853
Let's go.

280
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:34,972
- I heard you torture prisoners.
- He wanted to cut off my weenie.

281
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:38,291
Yeah, but I don't need the mayor
or the priest to defend me.

282
00:25:38,452 --> 00:25:39,932
Get him!

283
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:48,291
- Soon you won't be so proud.
- That's not very original.

284
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,410
Shut up!

285
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,010
Do you see me cry
or squeal like a piglet?

286
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:16,609
- Should we pay you honors?
- Leave him alone.

287
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,530
You. Tell me.
Is Longeverne this way?

288
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:24,805
What time is your brat coming home?

289
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:37,405
Finally.
Do you know what time it is?

290
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,525
Answer your mother.

291
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:47,644
Yes, I know what time it is.

292
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:55,244
Where have you been?

293
00:27:57,044 --> 00:27:58,284
Did you hear me?

294
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:03,804
Button up your shirt
and your jacket.

295
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:10,804
- Do you call that buttoned up?
- God, you always break things.

296
00:28:11,003 --> 00:28:13,883
- It just stayed in my hand.
- Just like the plate this morning.

297
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,483
I told you I didn't mean to do it.
I don't know my strength.

298
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:19,723
- I spend my life fixing everything.
- Hush now.

299
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:23,563
Stop arguing.
It was torn beforehand.

300
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:28,202
And all my buttonholes
are destroyed.

301
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:29,922
Your buttonholes?

302
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:34,402
Anyhow, they were useless since
I don't have buttons any more.

303
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:37,522
What the hell is this?

304
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,402
- How did you get into such a mess?
- I won't talk.

305
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:42,882
You're gonna to tell me,
you little rascal.

306
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:46,881
I know I deserve a beating
so go ahead. Get it over with.

307
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:50,801
On top of it, he's asking for it!

308
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:53,401
- I can't believe this.
- My stool!

309
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:55,241
Now it's the stool.

310
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,160
Your shirt, your buttonholes and
buttons and now the stool.

311
00:28:59,361 --> 00:29:01,841
Do you think we're the Rockefellers
to be able to afford this?

312
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,560
I'm gonna show you,
you little good for nothing.

313
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,240
- No!
- I'll teach you respect.

314
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
- Mommy!
- Scoundrel.

315
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,680
Control yourself, Eugene.

316
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,760
Just tell him he'll go to school
naked tomorrow as punishment.

317
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,240
Control yourself,
he's just a little boy.

318
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:20,279
Just tell him we'll send him naked.

319
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
Explain to me
what a "courtyard" is.

320
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:28,759
I don't know, but I know a yard
is about this long.

321
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:33,679
Things have not improved, Lebraque.
I'm going to run out of patience.

322
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,519
Sorry, sir, I'm just thinking
about something funny.

323
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:43,399
We'll talk about this later.
Everybody out. Recess.

324
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:54,717
- Me too, sir?
- You too.

325
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:58,397
- I'm not punished?
- No.

326
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:22,596
- Are you gonna tell my father?
- You'll see.

327
00:30:22,756 --> 00:30:24,516
Please don't, sir.

328
00:30:24,716 --> 00:30:27,956
You got another thrashing
yesterday. Is that it?

329
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:33,036
I can take the thrashing but I'm
afraid to be sent to boarding school.

330
00:30:33,195 --> 00:30:36,235
- He wants to send you there?
- And he will. Can't you tell?

331
00:30:36,395 --> 00:30:39,435
What I can tell is that
you clown around and do nothing.

332
00:30:40,915 --> 00:30:44,915
Just leave me in my corner, sir.
I promise I'll behave.

333
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:47,635
We're not
at the sand quarry, Lebraque.

334
00:30:47,794 --> 00:30:49,714
You're not the boss here, I am.

335
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:04,434
- Did you go to boarding school?
- Yes.

336
00:31:04,594 --> 00:31:07,994
- And it didn't kill me.
- But it's different for you.

337
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:10,993
I can't learn but I know
a lot of useful tricks.

338
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:12,314
Is that enough?

339
00:31:12,513 --> 00:31:15,313
Fishing and hunting.
That's enough to feed a man.

340
00:31:15,513 --> 00:31:17,353
Start with learning your lessons.

341
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:20,793
We'll see about the boarding school
with your father. Out of my sight.

342
00:31:20,993 --> 00:31:22,833
Wait!

343
00:31:22,993 --> 00:31:26,233
- What was so funny earlier?
- Nothing, sir. It's my mother.

344
00:31:26,432 --> 00:31:29,632
She wanted me to go naked
so I wouldn't ruin my clothes.

345
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:33,833
- That's funny.
- Not really, but what's funny...

346
00:31:33,953 --> 00:31:36,313
is the idea it gave me.

347
00:31:58,111 --> 00:31:59,351
Do you see anything?

348
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:03,631
Only Camus in the tree.
They chickened out.

349
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:07,271
Exactly what I wanted.
Let's go.

350
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,750
Everybody on him!
Surrender, Camus!

351
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,070
Let's climb the tree.

352
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:25,069
Here come the Velrans.

353
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:29,629
Let's go!

354
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:41,389
I wanna go too.

355
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:33,946
Hey, guys! Lebraque!

356
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:37,506
Lebraque. Where are you?

357
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:45,185
I knew I shouldn't have went!

358
00:33:50,865 --> 00:33:53,865
- I knew I shouldn't have went.
- Well, you shouldn't have.

359
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:58,345
- My pants don't fit me anymore.
- God, you guys sound like we lost.

360
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:01,985
We shouldn't have chased them
so far. It was cold out there.

361
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:05,105
Camus's right. Stop whining.
Did we kick their butt or not?

362
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:07,584
Yes, but by now,
they're warm and toasty.

363
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,784
There's a slug in my shorts.

364
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:11,784
That'll give you an extra one.

365
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:16,823
Are we gonna sing or not?

366
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:25,343
<i>We sing on our way to Victory</i>

367
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:29,663
<i>as she awaits us with open arms</i>

368
00:34:29,823 --> 00:34:34,783
<i>Freedom guides our steps
from the north to the south</i>

369
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:42,582
I'm gonna be sick.

370
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:45,702
- I'm never doing this again.
- Me neither.

371
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:49,942
I knew I shouldn't have went.

372
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:53,142
"I went through--" Past tense.

373
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,381
"The village to continue--"

374
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:59,661
Infinitive. "My journey."

375
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:03,861
- Gambette, give me that note.
- What note, sir?

376
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:08,541
You mean, you don't know that
you have a note in your left hand?

377
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:11,741
See, I told you. Bring it to me.

378
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,820
Lebraque. Did you write this?

379
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,300
I didn't mean it, sir.

380
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,140
I'll mean it when I correct your
mistakes. Come to the blackboard.

381
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:40,179
- Write this.
- This? On the blackboard?

382
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,859
Yes, but first, read it out loud.

383
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,739
- You want me to read this?
- Are you deaf or what?

384
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:53,338
- "I figured it out.
- Past tense.

385
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:57,738
- To mend out clothes, let's find--
- Imperative.

386
00:35:57,898 --> 00:36:01,738
- some money in order to buy--
- Infinitive.

387
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:05,418
buttons, shoelaces,
suspenders, belts...

388
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:09,458
needles, thread, the whole thing.

389
00:36:09,618 --> 00:36:12,338
- Everybody must--
- Present tense.

390
00:36:12,498 --> 00:36:16,578
- contribute 20 francs per week."
- Oh, no!

391
00:36:16,737 --> 00:36:18,977
I knew I shouldn't have went!

392
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:23,217
- What's wrong with you?
- I've got diarrhea.

393
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:25,217
Go then.

394
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:34,216
- Come on, little Gibus.
- Hurry up.

395
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:36,377
- I'm not coming out.
- What's with you?

396
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:40,056
Lebraque is a scumbag. Let him
come to piss, I'll show him.

397
00:36:40,256 --> 00:36:45,016
- Don't you think it's a good idea?
- Yeah, we'll always have buttons.

398
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:47,016
We could even start a war chest.

399
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:49,616
- Where would we put it?
- In the forest.

400
00:36:49,815 --> 00:36:52,135
- We'd have a cache.
- Depends how big our war chest is.

401
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:56,336
- And we'll have to guard it.
- Then it's a doghouse we need.

402
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:59,775
Or a fort. That's it!
We could build one with branches.

403
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:03,735
- And with planks and nails.
- A fort just for us, no one else.

404
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:06,415
Hey, Lebraque!

405
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:09,215
Come over here if you dare.

406
00:37:09,415 --> 00:37:10,895
What's with you?

407
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:13,494
How can I afford
20 francs a week?

408
00:37:13,654 --> 00:37:17,854
Like everyone else. We decided to be
a republic, so we're all equal.

409
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:20,014
I only know one thing:
Equality, Fraternity.

410
00:37:20,174 --> 00:37:25,294
You don't know anything. Some
of use have money and some don't.

411
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,133
- That's right. I can't pay.
- Me neither.

412
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,533
Then we can't have Equality,
Fraternity anymore.

413
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:33,253
If some pay and others don't,
it's back to royalty.

414
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:34,893
And I guillotine kings.

415
00:37:35,093 --> 00:37:39,093
So do we, but it's easy
to speak of equality--

416
00:37:39,253 --> 00:37:43,453
- Equality is when nobody pays.
- No, it's when we all pay the same.

417
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:47,133
How about the poor?
You're shaming us, Lebraque.

418
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:50,013
That's not worthy
of a good citizen.

419
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:57,612
So, Lacrique, what's equality?

420
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:00,212
Equality means that you have
as much as your neighbor.

421
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:03,092
- See, I told you.
- So we're not practicing equality?

422
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,971
Well, since some of us
don't have money--

423
00:38:06,131 --> 00:38:09,651
Those who can pay stay here, those
who can't, stand by little Gibus.

424
00:38:14,691 --> 00:38:18,811
I don't want the poor in the john,
since it's not a shame.

425
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,090
The poor over here
and the rich over there.

426
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,810
Okay, here's what I suggest.

427
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,530
Let's leave our own money
out of it.

428
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,810
That money is not for our army.

429
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:41,809
It's for our personal use.

430
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:44,049
The money we'll hide in our fort.

431
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,050
- What fort?
- I'll tell you later.

432
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:52,009
We must raise our own money
and it must belong to everybody.

433
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:54,289
Lacrique, is that equality?

434
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:55,409
Yes.

435
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:57,648
I knew it!

436
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:00,289
How are we gonna make money?

437
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:03,568
- Let's pick mushrooms.
- That's it.

438
00:39:03,728 --> 00:39:05,888
- And watercress.
- And catch frogs.

439
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:08,688
- And vipers.
- They sell for 10 francs in town.

440
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,608
- Foxes too. But we'll need luck.
- How much do they go for?

441
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:16,248
Lacrique, you're in charge
of finding out all the prices.

442
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:18,247
What do I do?

443
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:24,407
We're a republic!
There'll be jobs for everyone!

444
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:26,808
<i>Vive l'equality!</i>

445
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,687
Inspection.

446
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:41,846
- How many have you caught?
- 14.

447
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:46,966
14 times 2 equals 28 frog legs
at 60 francs per dozen.

448
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:50,206
That makes 100 francs and--

449
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:53,406
Make it an even count, okay?
Let's go.

450
00:39:59,045 --> 00:40:00,245
Watch out, the Velrans.

451
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:02,846
He's in the tree.
Go faster!

452
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:13,284
What are you two doing here?
I told you to keep watch.

453
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:16,085
- We found a vipers' nest.
- That's not your job.

454
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:19,324
- Go back to your station.
- What do we do with these?

455
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:22,724
Wow! 3 live vipers. 30 francs.

456
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:25,364
- You drained their venom, right?
- Yes.

457
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:28,644
Give them to me
and go back to your station.

458
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,843
- How many pounds?
- We can't find anything.

459
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:45,123
- I can smell mushrooms from here.
- Yes, but not the right kind.

460
00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:48,323
Do what you gotta do,
but I need 4 pounds by tonight.

461
00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:56,083
- Is that the Velrans?
- No way. Take this. I'll go check.

462
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:14,641
Lacrique, do you see the fox?

463
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:17,921
- Is it a male or a female?
- I couldn't tell.

464
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:20,921
Because they pay
twice as much for females.

465
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:24,201
I see it!

466
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:29,321
There! There! There!

467
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,520
- Hurry, Lebraque! It's in there.
- Make sure it doesn't get away!

468
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:41,999
Get some dry branches, Camus.
We'll smoke him out.

469
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:44,999
Follow me, guys!
Let's get some rocks!

470
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,640
- You'll be the dog, little Gibus.
- What?

471
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,960
- Be the dog. Bark in there.
- All right.

472
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:02,799
Get me some wire, Lacrique.

473
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:04,918
Some wire?

474
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:07,438
There you go.

475
00:42:17,997 --> 00:42:20,077
We're gonna poke him with this.

476
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,798
Get out of the way. It's burning!

477
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,198
Get out!

478
00:42:25,398 --> 00:42:28,878
Between this and the smoke,
it'll have to come out.

479
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:31,798
And bam!
Hit it on the coccyx.

480
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:34,317
Not the coccyx, the occiput.

481
00:42:36,117 --> 00:42:38,637
I can feel it move.

482
00:42:38,837 --> 00:42:42,557
The reward, plus the extra bonus
if it's a female...

483
00:42:42,716 --> 00:42:43,836
- plus the fur price--
- It's coming out.

484
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:52,396
Darn. A male.

485
00:42:52,595 --> 00:42:55,275
A male?
I'll show you if it's a male.

486
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:59,435
- What are you gonna do to him?
- What we didn't do to Migue.

487
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:16,395
Look! A female.

488
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:19,234
Here, Lacrique. We've got
at least 4 pounds.

489
00:43:19,394 --> 00:43:22,074
- It's not all ceps.
- Well, we got a bit of everything.

490
00:43:22,274 --> 00:43:25,594
- Who are you gonna sell those to?
- I know some pretty dumb people.

491
00:43:25,754 --> 00:43:27,594
We'll put the good ones on top.

492
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:30,594
They're all good ones.

493
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:22,191
- You're the best sister ever.
- I've got everything.

494
00:44:22,351 --> 00:44:26,311
Wow! Luckily,
our fort will be big.

495
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:29,031
- They didn't find it peculiar?
- I made several trips.

496
00:44:29,191 --> 00:44:33,191
I went to Terrin, then Montabot.
I said it was for Mrs. Champopourt.

497
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,150
It's full. Do you want me
to help you close it?

498
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,310
No need. You've helped us
a lot already. Thanks, goodbye.

499
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,790
The four corner posts are already
up and we've started this wall.

500
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:52,869
- Will there be room for a table?
- No problem.

501
00:44:53,029 --> 00:44:54,989
The fireplace will be here
and the door there.

502
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,990
We'll have to decorate
so we can feel at home.

503
00:44:58,189 --> 00:45:00,669
We've got an old clock that doesn't
work anymore in our attic.

504
00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:02,029
Bring it.

505
00:45:02,189 --> 00:45:05,629
I'll bring my parents'
wedding picture.

506
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:10,069
I'll bring the picture of my dad
as a soldier posing with a chick.

507
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:13,509
- It's mom, you dummy.
- Mommy, my eye!

508
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:16,548
- I'm telling you.
- Mommy, my eye!

509
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:19,549
- Guys, I swear it was my mom.
- We don't care.

510
00:45:19,668 --> 00:45:22,748
We'll have to find a spot
for our war chest.

511
00:45:27,587 --> 00:45:29,107
Here's our war chest!

512
00:45:30,987 --> 00:45:33,707
Move out of the way.
Don't touch it.

513
00:45:33,908 --> 00:45:36,828
You're not allowed to look.
You didn't bring the vipers!

514
00:45:37,027 --> 00:45:40,427
- It's not my fault! I was scared!
- You made us lose 30 francs.

515
00:45:40,587 --> 00:45:42,947
- Get him out of here.
- We want to see!

516
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,947
- I'll show you everything later.
- That's not equality!

517
00:45:46,107 --> 00:45:49,107
To hell with the republic.
Long live the King!

518
00:45:49,306 --> 00:45:51,066
Long live the King!

519
00:45:51,226 --> 00:45:53,906
- 50 shirt buttons.
- Wow.

520
00:45:54,066 --> 00:45:56,706
24 for pants.

521
00:45:56,866 --> 00:45:59,626
18 for sweaters.

522
00:45:59,786 --> 00:46:02,586
11 fasteners.

523
00:46:02,745 --> 00:46:04,425
3 pairs of suspenders.

524
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:09,066
2 spools of white thread.

525
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:15,305
Let's stick everything
in our pockets, we'll count later.

526
00:46:24,945 --> 00:46:28,745
I'm gonna repeat "buttons" the whole
day. If he asks me why, I'll talk.

527
00:46:28,905 --> 00:46:30,145
- Shut up.
- Buttons.

528
00:46:30,344 --> 00:46:31,784
- Quiet.
- Buttons, buttons.

529
00:46:31,984 --> 00:46:34,144
- What's happening, Macailler?
- Nothing. Just saying "buttons."

530
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:36,704
- What are you saying?
- "Buttons, buttons buttons."

531
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:39,584
Are you sure you're feeling well?
Maybe you should go to the doctor.

532
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:40,943
Let's go.

533
00:46:49,903 --> 00:46:54,103
Take another five minutes,
the fresh air will do you good.

534
00:46:57,103 --> 00:47:00,063
Long live the King. Shit!

535
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:19,302
Go straight to the fort with
the buttons and wait for us there.

536
00:47:19,502 --> 00:47:22,422
- The Velrans can show up today.
- Even cut off our buttons.

537
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:25,142
- And even put holes in our pants.
- We don't care about your pants.

538
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,381
Marie will fix them.

539
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:28,541
She'll mend them.

540
00:47:28,701 --> 00:47:30,861
- She'll brush off the dirt.
- She'll wash them.

541
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:33,701
Look what I'm gonna do
to my pants.

542
00:47:33,861 --> 00:47:36,741
Me too.

543
00:47:36,861 --> 00:47:39,701
Look at me!

544
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,100
To hell with the Velrans!

545
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,259
I can't walk anymore.
My leg is hurting.

546
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:04,659
I'm going to see the school nurse.

547
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:07,859
I don't care about your stupid war
since I'm a Royalist.

548
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:17,459
Stop. A white flag.

549
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:20,499
I request a ceasefire.
We have an injury.

550
00:48:20,658 --> 00:48:23,778
- It's a trap.
- Come see for yourselves.

551
00:48:23,978 --> 00:48:26,338
- Don't go.
- It's Lebraque I'm talking to.

552
00:48:26,498 --> 00:48:30,778
- Have your men step back.
- They won't move, I swear.

553
00:48:30,897 --> 00:48:32,777
Stay here.

554
00:48:39,538 --> 00:48:41,658
Is that a trap?

555
00:48:41,857 --> 00:48:42,897
It's your stupid slingshots.

556
00:48:43,057 --> 00:48:45,697
You fight us with slingshots too.

557
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:49,937
- He's got a broken leg.
- See.

558
00:48:50,137 --> 00:48:51,937
Hey, we didn't do it on purpose!

559
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,337
- He's young, he should recover.
- For sure.

560
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:58,777
He needs a splint. Just tie
a piece of wood to his leg.

561
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,576
- Will my shoelace do?
- Let's use mine, yours is leather.

562
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:04,816
- Go cut me a branch.
- From a birch?

563
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:07,336
- No, get one from the oak there.
- Okay.

564
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,735
What are you doing?

565
00:49:32,895 --> 00:49:35,815
I'm preparing the spot
where we'll put flowers.

566
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,694
- How come you're not at the war?
- I'm injured. I need your help.

567
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:41,694
- What's wrong with you?
- My leg. You need to massage it.

568
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:46,294
- Higher. Massage my thigh.
- No, that's disgusting!

569
00:49:46,454 --> 00:49:49,214
Just a bit. I'll feel better.

570
00:49:49,373 --> 00:49:51,213
I told you it's disgusting.

571
00:49:51,373 --> 00:49:54,413
- If I were Lebraque, you'd day yes.
- What do you think I'd say?

572
00:49:54,613 --> 00:49:57,533
- You'd say something else.
- Leave me alone or I'll tell him.

573
00:49:57,733 --> 00:49:59,893
- What will you tell him?
- I'll tell him what you said.

574
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:03,333
- I didn't say anything.
- That's what you say.

575
00:50:03,453 --> 00:50:05,533
Just wait 'til I tell him!

576
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:12,653
Go home or you'll get scolded.

577
00:50:19,732 --> 00:50:24,812
So what do we do now?

578
00:50:24,972 --> 00:50:29,692
- Depends. Anybody got the time?
- 10 to 7.

579
00:50:29,852 --> 00:50:34,412
- It's late.
- Shall we start again tomorrow?

580
00:50:34,571 --> 00:50:37,691
Step back, guys.
Don't show them your backs.

581
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:40,331
Why should't they?
We're not backstabbers.

582
00:50:40,531 --> 00:50:42,931
We know here the Velrans are.

583
00:50:43,091 --> 00:50:44,891
The Longevernes are scum.

584
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:49,611
- We didn't ask for the Armistice.
- It was a ceasefire.

585
00:50:49,811 --> 00:50:52,211
Still, it was a good trick
to avoid getting thrashed.

586
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,610
We'll see who'll get thrashed.

587
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:57,290
You chickened out.

588
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,570
Speak for yourselves.

589
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,490
- Creeps.
- Scumbags.

590
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:07,250
- We would've thrashed you.
- We'll see about that tomorrow.

591
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:10,449
Soft balls!

592
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,610
Twits!

593
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:25,529
You told Mr. Trachet you'd return
the horse? Did he suspect anything?

594
00:51:25,689 --> 00:51:29,529
No, grown-ups just assume
we're at their service.

595
00:51:29,688 --> 00:51:32,008
He didn't even thank me.
Do you see him?

596
00:51:32,168 --> 00:51:34,488
- No, he's gone through the fields.
- Jump up.

597
00:51:34,648 --> 00:51:36,648
You. Help me.

598
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:43,287
- What do I do with my basket?
- Pick up the droppings behind me.

599
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:46,767
We can't leave any tracks.
I want to see it full later.

600
00:51:46,927 --> 00:51:50,367
And that's what
you call a republic!

601
00:51:54,886 --> 00:51:58,406
I'm gonna show the Velrans.
I'll ride my horse to battle.

602
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:23,126
- Is that all you could find?
- It's Mr. Chafouin's donkey.

603
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:24,805
- Can it go fast?
- Yes!

604
00:52:24,965 --> 00:52:27,805
Amazing. Now I'm a general
with his own cavalry.

605
00:52:29,405 --> 00:52:31,405
Help!

606
00:52:46,524 --> 00:52:51,044
I'll show you!
Go! I won't tell you twice!

607
00:52:52,723 --> 00:52:56,203
Traitor! Dumb-ass!

608
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:37,761
We got him.

609
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,241
Let's tie him up.

610
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:51,241
Marie! Damn it, come on, Marie!

611
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm coming.

612
00:53:54,761 --> 00:53:57,921
- Do you want me to sew something?
- Just help me with the donkey.

613
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,120
One, two, three and...

614
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,040
They won. Hurrah for the cavalry!

615
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:07,919
The cavalry on horses, that's okay.
But not on this dumb-ass.

616
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,400
They're going to the fort. Come on.

617
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,840
- What about the donkey?
- It's not gonna go anywhere.

618
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,960
What will Mr. Chafouin say?

619
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,318
Halt.
Let's unload our spoils of war.

620
00:54:36,478 --> 00:54:38,318
Marie, come over here.

621
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:40,838
Lower Laztec's pants down.

622
00:54:52,717 --> 00:54:57,437
Buttons, suspenders and shoelaces
taken from the Velrans go in here.

623
00:55:00,877 --> 00:55:02,837
Give me time to count them.

624
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:06,076
9 buttons from Truyat,
1 belt from Migue The Moon...

625
00:55:06,276 --> 00:55:10,796
1 zipper from Dufagot, 6 sweater
buttons from Fetuchin...

626
00:55:10,956 --> 00:55:13,156
1 suspender clip from Greluchet,
1 shoelace from Valorin.

627
00:55:13,316 --> 00:55:18,156
- The donkey's still at the quarry.
- I'll help you.

628
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:22,196
I have something else to say.

629
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:25,236
Dear fort, until today,
we had nothing.

630
00:55:25,436 --> 00:55:30,596
But now that we have you,
we are owners.

631
00:55:30,756 --> 00:55:35,036
Now we can tell grown-ups--
everybody, on the count of three--

632
00:55:35,235 --> 00:55:38,355
- Die!
- Die!

633
00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:40,355
- Shit.
- Little Gibus!

634
00:55:40,515 --> 00:55:44,955
I don't want to hear bad language
on a day like this.

635
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:48,315
- What do we say to the world?
- Die! Die! Die!

636
00:55:53,274 --> 00:55:57,114
- What do I do with the droppings?
- Eat them.

637
00:56:16,712 --> 00:56:19,792
- Come on. Come on.
- Look! He moved.

638
00:56:19,952 --> 00:56:23,712
- You wish.
- He did! He went from here to here.

639
00:56:23,872 --> 00:56:26,032
- How do you know?
- I'll make a mark.

640
00:56:26,193 --> 00:56:28,073
I'll show you he's moving.

641
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:33,992
- He moved at least 3 inches!
- At this pace...

642
00:56:38,271 --> 00:56:41,871
We're gonna get a thrashing
when we get home.

643
00:56:42,072 --> 00:56:45,432
It's dark. We'll be discreet.

644
00:56:45,591 --> 00:56:47,911
I've had it! Let's go.

645
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:22,270
What in hell is going on?

646
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:27,549
Did you break something again?

647
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:05,867
Here you are.

648
00:58:16,867 --> 00:58:18,947
I'm warning you,
I know all my lessons by heart.

649
00:58:19,106 --> 00:58:22,626
So if somebody wants to send me to
boarding school, it will be unfair.

650
00:58:40,345 --> 00:58:42,785
- Look who's here! Laztec!
- Macailler!

651
00:58:42,985 --> 00:58:45,625
- Are you going to the fair?
- Yes, I'm picking up my tractor.

652
00:58:45,785 --> 00:58:49,545
- Ouch! Going to the fair, Laztec?
- Pray to come out in one piece.

653
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:53,624
Would you like my window seat?
Ouch! Ow!

654
00:59:19,903 --> 00:59:24,743
- Get lost, you fartface.
- Come on, we're friends.

655
00:59:24,903 --> 00:59:27,463
Let me sit next to you.

656
00:59:27,662 --> 00:59:32,022
What if I said "Lebraque is
a creep" when I get back?

657
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:36,583
What if I told you what Lebraque
and the others are doing?

658
00:59:36,742 --> 00:59:40,902
Let me sit next to you
and I'll tell you...

659
00:59:41,062 --> 00:59:43,942
what they'll do Thursday
in the fort they're building.

660
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:48,462
They've built a fort
next to the old quarry.

661
00:59:48,582 --> 00:59:50,982
They have a treasure.
It's a bag of buttons.

662
00:59:52,142 --> 00:59:54,582
Next Thursday,
they'll all be there.

663
00:59:57,301 --> 00:59:59,941
They say
we're a republic, but...

664
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:05,381
- Is everybody here?
- Yes.

665
01:00:05,581 --> 01:00:09,301
- Does everybody have bread?
- Yes.

666
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:12,020
- 12 chocolate bars.
- Yes.

667
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,220
4 pounds of sugar cubes.

668
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,260
- So, are you done yet?
- Wait, I'm doing the inventory.

669
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:25,300
Laztec, October 16th.

670
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:31,659
Migue The Moon, September 20th.

671
01:00:36,739 --> 01:00:39,259
- 4 liters of red wine.
- Correct.

672
01:00:39,419 --> 01:00:41,259
5 packs of Gauloises cigarettes.

673
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:03,937
- Almost done.
- Hey, guys, we're almost done.

674
01:01:04,137 --> 01:01:09,017
You're coming too, Macailler.
Nobody will be left out.

675
01:01:09,177 --> 01:01:12,137
- It's everybody's celebration.
- Let's go, guys.

676
01:01:26,736 --> 01:01:28,696
- Who wants to make a speech?
- Lebraque!

677
01:01:28,896 --> 01:01:30,456
No, not me. Not again!

678
01:01:30,616 --> 01:01:34,616
- Why don't I give a speech?
- Shut up. We're here to have fun.

679
01:01:34,776 --> 01:01:38,936
- What if I gave a funny speech?
- Let's have an aperitif first.

680
01:01:39,135 --> 01:01:40,295
Pour it, Camus.

681
01:01:40,456 --> 01:01:44,216
It's good brandy.
It will knock your socks off.

682
01:01:57,454 --> 01:02:00,734
We'll start with a nip,
but then let's move on to wine!

683
01:02:00,895 --> 01:02:04,015
- Who has a dirty story to tell?
- Me! Me!

684
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:08,734
Guys, look what I dug up.

685
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:10,253
Me too.

686
01:02:10,414 --> 01:02:12,454
<i>"The Journal of Medicine
Breast oedema"</i>

687
01:02:12,614 --> 01:02:16,214
- Just press on them.
- What's an o-e-dema?

688
01:02:16,374 --> 01:02:18,774
Can't you tell from the picture?

689
01:02:18,933 --> 01:02:20,773
- Just ask Marie.
- Marie. Explain to him.

690
01:02:23,413 --> 01:02:25,773
No.

691
01:02:25,933 --> 01:02:28,613
We've seen show before.
Come on, show us.

692
01:02:28,773 --> 01:02:32,413
- Little Gibus can't see my oedemas!
- Hey, why not?

693
01:02:32,573 --> 01:02:35,613
- Because you don't have any.
- They haven't grown yet.

694
01:02:35,772 --> 01:02:38,972
- How do you know?
- You don't read that magazine.

695
01:02:39,133 --> 01:02:41,933
Leave her alone.
She doesn't want to.

696
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,172
- Anyhow, we're here to party!
- To hell with the Velrans!

697
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:12,450
They have a cavalry.
Well, now we have tanks.

698
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:20,010
Today's youths are something.
He's also a great mechanic.

699
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:24,730
- Hey, where are you going?
- It stalls in 3rd gear!

700
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:29,050
I want to try driving it uphill.
It'll only take 15 minutes.

701
01:03:30,209 --> 01:03:32,969
See, he knows his stuff.

702
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:35,329
I tell you.

703
01:03:37,849 --> 01:03:42,649
<i>Achtung, citizens! Today you can
scream "Hurrah for our fort"...</i>

704
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:47,809
because we've built a rectangular
parallelepiped with a 6mX3m base...

705
01:03:47,969 --> 01:03:50,409
which makes: 6 times 3 equals
18 square metres.

706
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:53,248
Since, citizens, the surface of
a rectangle equals...

707
01:03:53,408 --> 01:03:55,848
the short side multiplied by
the long side.

708
01:03:57,928 --> 01:04:02,248
The volume is 18 times
its height of 2 metres...

709
01:04:02,448 --> 01:04:04,368
that is 36 cubic metres...

710
01:04:04,527 --> 01:04:07,167
because the volume of a rectangular
parallelepiped equals...

711
01:04:07,287 --> 01:04:10,927
the base surface multiplied by
the height, citizens.

712
01:04:12,087 --> 01:04:13,687
Unlike the volume of a pyramid...

713
01:04:13,887 --> 01:04:16,207
which is obtained
by dividing the height by two.

714
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:18,048
Therefore, citizens...

715
01:04:18,207 --> 01:04:19,607
if we theorized...

716
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:22,247
that our fort was a pyramind...

717
01:04:22,446 --> 01:04:24,886
we would have
to multiply 36 by 1...

718
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,687
or 18 by 2.

719
01:04:26,846 --> 01:04:28,086
- Citizens--
- Bravo!

720
01:04:31,006 --> 01:04:33,806
Wait! The surface of a trapeze--

721
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:36,046
My turn to give a speech.

722
01:04:38,086 --> 01:04:40,246
- Out of my way!
- What's wrong with him?

723
01:04:40,406 --> 01:04:42,686
If Lacrique keeps going on
like this, I'm gonna do the same.

724
01:04:42,886 --> 01:04:45,126
Me too.

725
01:04:45,286 --> 01:04:48,846
Come on, Macailler. Show us you're
man enough to sing a song.

726
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:55,806
<i>Little Jesus
was going to school</i>

727
01:04:55,965 --> 01:05:00,245
<i>Carrying the cross
on his shoulders</i>

728
01:05:00,405 --> 01:05:04,125
<i>When he retained his lessons
he would receive a bonbon</i>

729
01:05:04,284 --> 01:05:06,724
<i>An apple to put in his mouth</i>

730
01:05:08,764 --> 01:05:11,764
<i>A bouquet to put in his heart</i>

731
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:14,284
The Velrans! The Velrans!

732
01:05:29,483 --> 01:05:32,443
Not me! Not me! Ask Laztec.

733
01:05:32,603 --> 01:05:34,683
Leave Macailler alone.

734
01:05:34,883 --> 01:05:36,843
Lacrique, Big Gibus,
follow Macailler!

735
01:05:37,003 --> 01:05:38,283
Laztec, don't! Don't!

736
01:05:38,443 --> 01:05:39,723
Not our fort!

737
01:05:43,963 --> 01:05:46,843
- Get our warchest, Camus.
- I'm going in.

738
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:02,918
Well, Marie. You've got your work
cut out for you.

739
01:07:07,638 --> 01:07:10,838
I knew I shouldn't have went!

740
01:07:10,997 --> 01:07:15,437
- Let go of me! I want to go home!
- There he is.

741
01:07:17,638 --> 01:07:19,518
- Let me go home!
- Take him in!

742
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:23,718
- What did I do to you?
- Let's get to the bottom of this.

743
01:07:25,317 --> 01:07:28,797
- We don't serve justice like that.
- What justice?

744
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:31,877
You'll see that later.
I say there's a traitor among us.

745
01:07:32,076 --> 01:07:34,236
- Where?
- Look in the mirror!

746
01:07:34,397 --> 01:07:36,637
- Wait. He hasn't confessed yet.
- You're gonna wait a long time.

747
01:07:36,797 --> 01:07:39,357
- Why did Laztec leave you alone?
- I don't know.

748
01:07:39,516 --> 01:07:43,516
- You were at the fair with him.
- Mr. Chafouin saw you.

749
01:07:43,676 --> 01:07:45,596
- Why did the Velrans let you go?
- I don't know.

750
01:07:45,836 --> 01:07:49,156
- I saw you.
- Hey don't move! I can't sew!

751
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:52,756
I didn't do anything.
What do you have against me?

752
01:07:52,915 --> 01:07:55,875
Let's find out.
Tie his arms and legs.

753
01:07:56,075 --> 01:07:58,035
No, it's not me. It's not true.

754
01:07:58,195 --> 01:08:00,875
Wait, guys. Lacrique, come here.

755
01:08:01,075 --> 01:08:03,115
How did they force traitors to
confess during the Middle Ages?

756
01:08:03,315 --> 01:08:07,315
- They roasted their toes.
- Take off his shoes.

757
01:08:07,475 --> 01:08:11,355
Let go of me. What did I do to you?

758
01:08:14,995 --> 01:08:17,155
- Like this, Lebraque?
- Hold his feet!

759
01:08:17,314 --> 01:08:20,194
I confess! I did it! I did it!

760
01:08:20,314 --> 01:08:23,634
- Untie him. We're gonna judge him.
- I confessed! You can't touch me.

761
01:08:24,954 --> 01:08:27,514
It took us weeks to build the fort.

762
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:30,634
We built it with our labor,
courage, and even our education.

763
01:08:30,793 --> 01:08:34,673
Ask Lacrique: the surfaces,
the volumes, everything.

764
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:37,113
We didn't learn all that for
nothing because of our fort.

765
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,433
All that has been smashed
because of you.

766
01:08:39,593 --> 01:08:42,713
- We've lost half of our war chest.
- You stole from all of us.

767
01:08:42,873 --> 01:08:46,033
You're a thief, Macailler.

768
01:08:46,192 --> 01:08:48,272
You have no excuse.

769
01:08:48,433 --> 01:08:53,073
You made us lose a battle.
I feel ashamed tonight.

770
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:05,271
We all fled
because we'd been betrayed.

771
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:08,832
And when there's a traitor,
all battles are lost.

772
01:09:10,631 --> 01:09:14,671
- So, we're gonna kill him?
- We should.

773
01:09:14,832 --> 01:09:20,152
We're gonna pierce his eyes with
needles and sew his eyelids shut?

774
01:09:20,311 --> 01:09:22,231
No. Drop his pants.

775
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:31,350
Since he's hurt us all,
we'll flog him first.

776
01:09:31,511 --> 01:09:33,831
We'll take turns and then we'll
decide what to do with him.

777
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:53,349
I said I would only be 15 minutes.

778
01:09:53,509 --> 01:09:55,269
Mommy!

779
01:10:03,228 --> 01:10:05,348
That's my boy!

780
01:10:09,348 --> 01:10:13,268
- Who did this to you?
- Lebraque and his friends.

781
01:10:13,388 --> 01:10:16,068
- My god!
- Mommy!

782
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:20,908
My little Jesus, what happened?

783
01:10:21,027 --> 01:10:24,147
It's that little hoodlum
Lebraque again.

784
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:32,627
What happened, my little Jesus?

785
01:10:34,186 --> 01:10:35,506
They tortured him.

786
01:10:35,707 --> 01:10:38,507
Then it's the parents who
must face the music.

787
01:10:38,666 --> 01:10:43,306
I'm gonna tell you what I think.
Your kids are all hoodlums.

788
01:10:43,466 --> 01:10:45,826
They're hoodlums and savages.

789
01:10:45,986 --> 01:10:50,346
And I'm gonna sue
the parents for damages.

790
01:10:55,305 --> 01:10:59,945
In the fort--
Mom-- Dad--

791
01:11:00,105 --> 01:11:04,585
They undressed me.
They beat me.

792
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:22,064
Be quiet!

793
01:11:36,904 --> 01:11:38,424
We're gonna get it.

794
01:11:38,624 --> 01:11:42,944
Stop whining. Last time we're the
ones who thrashed the Velrans.

795
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:46,583
Don't you remember Migue The Moon
with his shorts on his head?

796
01:11:46,823 --> 01:11:51,463
That's what he looked like.
Look, I'm Migue The Moon.

797
01:11:51,623 --> 01:11:55,263
How funny. I can see the ground.

798
01:11:55,383 --> 01:11:58,743
I can walk like this.
I'm not scared.

799
01:12:15,061 --> 01:12:17,701
You little hoodlum!

800
01:12:19,861 --> 01:12:22,221
- Macailler spilled the beans.
- What are we gonna do?

801
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:26,821
You're gonna get a good licking.
You're gonna pay for this.

802
01:12:27,021 --> 01:12:29,981
You're gonna get it good!
They're back!

803
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,060
You're gonna remember it!

804
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:35,060
- Here comes your father, Boulon.
- Go, we'll see what he says.

805
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:39,701
- We can't let him go alone.
- Let's all go. Right, Lebraque?

806
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,740
I would if I knew they wouldn't
send me to boarding school.

807
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:46,260
- You too will have to go home.
- They might calm down by tonight.

808
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:49,180
Okay, but for us
it's the sooner, the better.

809
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:52,420
- Tell them, Lebraque.
- He's right, guys. Go.

810
01:12:52,579 --> 01:12:55,779
- I give the command over to Camus.
- Form ranks and follow me.

811
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:57,300
Forward and march.

812
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:11,059
Bye, guys.

813
01:13:11,218 --> 01:13:12,778
Bye, Lebraque.

814
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:42,657
Damn tractor!

815
01:14:12,575 --> 01:14:15,775
Why buttons? And how many?

816
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:18,735
How did you pay for them?
Are you going to tell me?

817
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:22,974
It's not me.
I didn't do anything.

818
01:14:28,894 --> 01:14:31,254
Who's going to pay the damages?

819
01:14:34,813 --> 01:14:36,173
You'll grow up to be a criminal.

820
01:14:45,094 --> 01:14:46,214
Who did this?

821
01:14:46,413 --> 01:14:48,733
Me! Lebraque!
You won't get me that easily!

822
01:14:48,893 --> 01:14:51,813
I'd rather die than live in your
dumps or your boarding schools!

823
01:14:51,973 --> 01:14:55,173
You'll never find me!
Die, you pigs!

824
01:15:33,651 --> 01:15:36,971
Look who's here.

825
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:39,371
You don't need this anymore.

826
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:52,650
I'm telling you, we'll find him!

827
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:55,610
- Even if it takes all day.
- Or night.

828
01:15:55,769 --> 01:15:59,089
In any case, we won't die
of thirst. He'd better watch out!

829
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:03,370
Should we tell the police?

830
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:06,089
Tell them
to mind their own business.

831
01:16:34,528 --> 01:16:36,328
Let's have a snack.

832
01:16:36,487 --> 01:16:39,327
We can't go
with our stomachs empty.

833
01:16:42,247 --> 01:16:45,687
- Do we start with red or white?
- How about one of each.

834
01:16:50,127 --> 01:16:52,727
Mind you, in my young days,
I may have done the same thing.

835
01:16:52,847 --> 01:16:55,727
- What thing are you talking about?
- My boy and yours.

836
01:16:57,566 --> 01:17:01,166
Suppose you would've snitched.
I would've smashed your face.

837
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:04,126
If you're defending him,
what are you doing here?

838
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,926
I'm not. I'm just telling you
I don't like snitches.

839
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:09,926
I'm gonna tell you something,
Lebraque.

840
01:17:14,526 --> 01:17:16,526
Go ahead, tell him.

841
01:17:16,725 --> 01:17:20,565
With your big mouth
and the way you defend him...

842
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:24,325
you'll be all hugs and kisses when
we find him. You'll forgive him.

843
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:27,445
Me, forgive him?

844
01:17:27,605 --> 01:17:30,205
I'll show you if I'll forgive him!
Let him try to get away!

845
01:17:30,365 --> 01:17:32,965
You don't know
what's in my pockets.

846
01:17:33,165 --> 01:17:35,085
Look at this.

847
01:17:35,245 --> 01:17:38,725
I'll fry his butt
if he tries to get away.

848
01:17:38,885 --> 01:17:41,165
A good old grenade
from Grandpa Lebraque.

849
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:43,124
<i>A grenade from the real war.</i>

850
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:46,363
From Verdun, 1916. Not from their
stupid war with the atomic bomb.

851
01:17:46,523 --> 01:17:48,403
Ye Gods! Look at this!

852
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:49,803
Lebraque, wait!

853
01:17:56,203 --> 01:17:59,563
Damn! Let me throw it back
before it explodes.

854
01:18:05,163 --> 01:18:07,523
- Oh, God!
- I'm dead!

855
01:18:07,682 --> 01:18:09,442
You idiots!
Can't you see it's defused?

856
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,802
I want to scare my boy,
not kill him.

857
01:18:12,002 --> 01:18:13,922
Who's the nitwit who threw that?

858
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:16,802
Nitwit yourself!
Anyhow, it's defused.

859
01:18:17,002 --> 01:18:20,202
You'd have to be from Longeverne
to do such a stupid trick.

860
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:22,921
You didn't say that when we got
drunk at your place the other day.

861
01:18:23,082 --> 01:18:26,442
- No, but I used to 40 years ago.
- Well, your sister is ugly.

862
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:29,522
She may be ugly,
but she's still too good for you!

863
01:18:29,721 --> 01:18:32,721
Get out of here, Velrans.
You're in Longeverne territory.

864
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:34,561
Who says that?

865
01:18:34,721 --> 01:18:36,561
Damn it!

866
01:18:36,761 --> 01:18:38,001
First warning.

867
01:18:38,161 --> 01:18:40,161
Second warning.
Fire!

868
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,160
To hell with the Velrans!

869
01:18:43,321 --> 01:18:46,361
To hell with the Longeverne!

870
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,801
Creeps! Dumb-asses!
Soft balls!

871
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:04,360
What happened? Is anybody hurt?

872
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:09,160
I don't know
how a real one got in there.

873
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,320
I could slap a fine on you!

874
01:19:11,519 --> 01:19:13,759
You just reminded me.
I was gonna go fishing with it.

875
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,759
God!

876
01:19:17,839 --> 01:19:21,959
- Let's have a drink to recover.
- There's enough for everyone.

877
01:19:41,397 --> 01:19:46,077
1916. Can't complain
about the quality.

878
01:19:46,237 --> 01:19:49,117
<i>If it keeps going,
you're gonna see my--</i>

879
01:19:49,277 --> 01:19:52,477
<i>My pants are bursting
at the seams</i>

880
01:19:52,677 --> 01:19:54,877
<i>If it keeps going
you're gonna see--</i>

881
01:20:05,796 --> 01:20:09,716
- They didn't get him.
- I knew he wouldn't get caught.

882
01:20:36,075 --> 01:20:38,835
Hey, you found some buddies.

883
01:20:43,114 --> 01:20:45,954
Now, let's have a bite.

884
01:20:48,953 --> 01:20:51,833
They're not gonna come bug us.

885
01:20:51,994 --> 01:20:53,834
Don't move, I'll be back.

886
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,032
Find him.

887
01:21:20,912 --> 01:21:23,512
Go, otherwise you'll lead
the dogs to me.

888
01:21:23,672 --> 01:21:26,832
Sorry, my friends, they're gonna
go after you or after me.

889
01:21:26,992 --> 01:21:29,592
Don't be mad at me. Run fast.
The two of us will manage.

890
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:01,350
If he's really drowned,
we'll need divers.

891
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:04,230
My boy is not the kind
to commit suicide.

892
01:23:35,425 --> 01:23:38,505
Sorry, buddy.
I have no other choice.

893
01:23:53,064 --> 01:23:57,024
You keep quiet. Let me sleep.

894
01:24:41,102 --> 01:24:44,302
Lebraque!

895
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:03,420
Lebraque! The teacher said
not to do something stupid!

896
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:16,700
Loggers, sir! Can we go see them?

897
01:25:16,859 --> 01:25:18,699
Yes, but be careful.

898
01:25:23,499 --> 01:25:24,699
Give me your hand.

899
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:31,499
Camus, what kind of tree
are they cutting down?

900
01:25:31,699 --> 01:25:32,859
An oak, sir.

901
01:25:33,058 --> 01:25:36,018
- What will they do with it?
- They'll feed it to the pigs.

902
01:25:36,179 --> 01:25:40,299
You feed its acorns to the pigs,
but what about the wood?

903
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:43,938
- They'll make furniture, sir.
- Very good.

904
01:25:49,498 --> 01:25:52,818
- Freedom or Death!
- Lebraque!

905
01:26:52,054 --> 01:26:55,374
See, you'll be able to put
your personal belongings here.

906
01:26:57,055 --> 01:27:00,535
Come on, it's not a prison.

907
01:27:06,134 --> 01:27:07,494
Is it?

908
01:27:12,974 --> 01:27:14,814
Another tough cookie, huh?

909
01:27:21,133 --> 01:27:25,173
I'll be back next Thursday.

910
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:29,093
If you behave, they won't keep you
here very long. I'll see to it.

911
01:27:35,252 --> 01:27:37,972
By the way, what should I tell
your father?

912
01:27:39,572 --> 01:27:42,052
Tell him he could have
brought me himself.

913
01:27:44,571 --> 01:27:46,931
Bye, little guy. Behave.

914
01:28:09,571 --> 01:28:11,411
Excuse me, sir.

915
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:16,290
I know this one too.
Is he in the same dorm?

916
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:17,690
He's new too.

917
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:20,850
Don't leave them together or
there's gonna be some rough stuff.

918
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:24,890
Believe me, I know them firsthand.
That's how I make a living.

919
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,490
A very meager living,
I might add.

920
01:28:48,848 --> 01:28:51,128
Are you new too?

921
01:28:52,568 --> 01:28:53,648
Laztec.

922
01:28:54,448 --> 01:28:56,768
Lebraque.

923
01:28:56,928 --> 01:29:00,408
- What are you doing here?
- It's my dad. And you?

924
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:02,488
Me too.

925
01:29:02,647 --> 01:29:06,527
- I can't believe it! Laztec!
- Lebraque!

926
01:29:07,687 --> 01:29:09,727
- Good old Laztec!
- Good old Lebraque!

927
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:11,087
The creeps.

928
01:29:11,207 --> 01:29:14,367
To think that when we're big
we'll be as dumb as they are.
