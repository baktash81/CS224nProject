Sir?

4
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,565
At the microphone,
Do your work Sir.

5
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:02,904
I am sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,336
Time to go.

13

<i>BBC NEWS READER :
Using the new invention of radio,</i>

15
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:02,017
<i>The Opening Ceremony was the first time
his Majesty the King addressed his subjects
on the wireless.</i>

from his Majesty....t' ek

22
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,017
...The King.

23
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:27,585
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM:
Inhale deep into your lungs..
Your Royal Highness.

24
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,496
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?

25
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,741
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves
and gives you confidence.

26
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:43,258
If Your Highness will be very kind as
to open your hand...

27
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,431
It's Sterilized. Now..

28
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,098
Now...if I may take the liberty?

29
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,298
...insert some into your mouth.

30
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,750
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?

31
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,988
The classic approach,
it cured Demosthenes.

32
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:18,948
That was in Ancient Greece...uh

33
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:20,598
Has it worked since?

34
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:25,944
Now,
if you would be so kind as to read...

35
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,327
A wealth of words.

36
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,959
Fight against those marbles,
Your Royal Highness.

37
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:42,999
Enunciate!

38
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:49,611
A little more concentration
your Royal Higness.

39
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:55,794
I nearly swallowed
the bloody things!

40
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:58,287
Thank you so much, Doctor,

41
00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:01,485
it’s been most...hmm
interesting.

42
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,849
Insert marbles!

43
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:10,561
He can insert his own bloody marbles....!

44
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:18,704
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

45
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:24,055
You know,
you can’t keep doing this, Bertie.

46
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:27,537
I know.

47
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:35,609
Promise me:
no more.

48
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:07,194
Hello.
Is anyone there?

49
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:09,004
I’m just in the loo.

50
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:21,899
Ah, Mrs.Johnson
There you are.

51
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:25,256
I’m sorry, there’s no receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.

52
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:28,848
“Poor and content
is rich and rich enough”

53
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:32,109
- Sorry?
- Shakespeare. How are you?

54
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,004
How do you do?

55
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,203
Coughing a lot.

56
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:40,013
Now, this is slightly awkward, But..
I’m afraid you’re late.

57
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:43,496
Yes,
I’m afraid I am.

58
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:44,448
Where’s Mr Johnson?

59
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:47,651
He doesn’t know I’m here.

60
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:49,930
That’s not a promising start.

61
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:58,410
My husband has seen everyone to no avail.
Awefully 'fraid he’s given up hope.

62
00:09:58,411 --> 00:09:59,362
He hasn’t seen me.

63
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:01,943
You’re awfully sure of yourself.

64
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:04,606
Well,
I’m sure of anyone who wants to be cured.

65
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:05,607
Of course, he wishes to be cured.

66
00:10:05,657 --> 00:10:10,649
My husband is umm..
he's required to speak publicly.

67
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,601
Perhaps he should change jobs?

68
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:14,111
- He can’t.

69
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,565
Indentured servitude?

70
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:18,416
Something of that nature.

71
00:10:20,197 --> 00:10:22,116
Well we need to  have your hubby pop by...

72
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,493
Uh..Tuesday would be good...

73
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:30,130
He can give me his personal details and
I’ll make a frank appraisal and then, We can take it from there.

74
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,131
Doctor, forgive me.

75
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:34,228
I do not have a “hubby”.
We don’t ‘pop’.

76
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:37,421
and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.

77
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:40,181
You...
must come to us.

78
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:43,952
I'm Sorry, Mrs Johnson,
my game, my turf, my rules.

79
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:48,765
You'll have to talk over this with your hauband
and then you can speak to me on the telephone.

80
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,399
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.

81
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:57,774
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?

82
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,533
The Duke of York?

83
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:02,438
Yes...
the Duke of York.

84
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:16,662
I thought the appointment was for “Johnson”?
Forgive me, your ...?

85
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:18,469
- ..Royal Highness.

86
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,421
Johnson was used during the Great War;

87
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:23,168
when the Navy didn’t want the enemy
to know ‘he’ was aboard.

88
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:25,347
- Am I...considered the enemy?

89
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:28,027
You will be,
if you remain un- obliging.

90
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:37,251
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?

91
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:40,675
The President of the Speech Therapists Society.

92
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,236
Eileen McCleod?
She’s a sport.

93
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:48,525
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean methods
were “unorthodox and controversial”.

94
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,093
I warned her...
those were not my favorite words.

95
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:57,359
I can cure your husband.
But for my  method to work I need trust and total equality;

96
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,734
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.

97
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,606
No exceptions.

98
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:07,435
Well then, in that case...

99
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,301
When can you start?

100
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,027
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.

101
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:29,908
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!

102
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,922
Did you pick mum up from Bridge?

103
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,714
Yes, I’ve hardly been out of the car all day.

104
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:37,067
I had a special visitor this afternoon.

105
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:39,900
- May I please leave this table
- How special, special?

106
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,708
No, You must stay,
bored stupid, listening to your
parents’ inane conversation.

107
00:12:43,758 --> 00:12:45,473
- Thanks Dad..
- and Mum.

108
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:47,606
- Me too.
- You meeting Jean?

109
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,974
- No, someone else.

110
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:55,565
Doctor? Doctor? Can't you help
your brother with the washing...

111
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,363
I’m fine.

112
00:12:57,398 --> 00:12:58,866
Who's it Lionel?

113
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:01,656
Why bring it up
if you can’t talk about it?

114
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:06,650
Myrtle, It's just a woman,
looking to help her husband.

115
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,346
Oh!
And I had a ‘call’.

116
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,266
for an audition.

117
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:13,111
One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?

118
00:13:13,146 --> 00:13:14,996
It Could be a lot of fun.

119
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,157
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

120
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:19,820
They’re a highly regarded group.

121
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,940
From Putney.

122
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:26,188
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.

123
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,473
‘The Flight’.

124
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:31,684
Oh, to fly away!

125
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:33,284
Weren’t they lucky!

126
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,466
Now Papa tell a  story!

127
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,640
- Could I be a penguin instead?

128
00:13:57,156 --> 00:14:00,092
Once, there were two princesses...

129
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:03,236
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.

130
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:05,899
whose Papa was a penguin.

131
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:13,718
This was because he  had been
turned into one by the wicket witch.

132
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,777
This was an...
inconvenient for him..

133
00:14:15,827 --> 00:14:21,856
because he loved to hold
his princesses in his arms...

134
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:26,828
and you can’t because he
don't have wings like herrings

135
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:29,601
- Herrings don’t have wings.

136
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,847
- Penguins have wings
which is shaped like herrings

137
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:37,525
and make matters worse...

138
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:41,208
is that she
sent him to the South Pole.

139
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:43,630
which is an awfully long walk..back.

140
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,446
if you can’t fly.

141
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:49,799
So..When he reached the water,

142
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:52,566
he dived in through the dept so fast...

143
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,651
that he was in Southampton
waters by lunchtime.

144
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:59,586
And from there,
he took the 2.30 to Weybridge,

145
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:06,161
changed at Clapham Junction and asked
a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.

146
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:09,296
He swam up the Thames,
out through the  plughole,

147
00:15:09,297 --> 00:15:10,248
and gave the cook,

148
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:14,207
Mama and ...Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.

149
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,458
Now when the girls heard all the commotions,

150
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:21,747
they ran to the kitchen where
they gave him a good scrub,

151
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:24,033
a mackerel and a kiss.

152
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:25,996
and as they kissed him,

153
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,479
guess what he turned into?

154
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,245
- A handsome prince.

155
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,609
A short-tailed Albatross.

156
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,339
With wings so big

157
00:15:36,374 --> 00:15:41,146
that he could wrap them both
his two girls together.

158
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:43,913
Now, now..
It's time for bed.

159
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:53,294
Will Mrs Simpson  be there?

160
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:56,775
- My brother’s insisting.

161
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,598
- Is he serious?

162
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:02,050
- About her coming to dinner?

163
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,737
- No. About her!

164
00:16:06,784 --> 00:16:08,480
- A married woman? He can’t be.

165
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,481
- She can.

166
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:10,482
By the way,

167
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:13,813
I think I found someone rather interesting.

168
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,165
On Harley Street. A doctor.

169
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:16,166
- Out of the question.

170
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:20,973
I’m not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.

171
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:23,624
- His approach seems rather different....

172
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,342
Now?

173
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:29,280
Now.

174
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:39,886
<i>“Now is the winter of our discontent,</i>

175
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:44,650
<i>Made glorious summer
by this sun of York".</i>

176
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:47,792
<i>“And all the clouds
that lour’d upon our house</i>

177
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:50,392
<i>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</i>

178
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:55,190
<i>Now are our brows,
bound with victorious... wreaths;</i>

179
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:56,391
- Thank you!

180
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,556
Lovely diction Mr...?

181
00:17:01,591 --> 00:17:03,332
- Logue. Lionel Logue.

182
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,783
- Well, Mr.Logue.

183
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:11,716
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed
creature yearning to be King.

184
00:17:11,717 --> 00:17:16,823
Nor did I realize Richard the Third
was King of the Colonies.

185
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:23,442
I do know the lines.
I’ve played the role before.

186
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,138
- Sydney?
- Perth.

187
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:28,577
- Major theater town, is it?

188
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,151
-Enthusiastic.

189
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:33,018
- Ah.
- I was well reviewed.

190
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:39,131
Yes...
well...Lionel,

191
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:43,021
I think our dramatic society,

192
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:47,837
is looking for someone slightly younger
and a...

193
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:51,649
little more regal.

194
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:12,244
Where did you find this...physician?

195
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:13,245
Classifieds,

196
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:15,747
next to “French model,
Shepherd’s Market”.

197
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:19,970
He comes highly recommended.

198
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,248
Charges substantial fees
in order to help the poor.

199
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,598
Oh dear,
perhaps he’s a Bolshevik?!

200
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:29,099
No receptionist.
He likes to keep things simple.

201
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:35,536
- The Johnsons.

202
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,712
You can go in now, “Mr. Johnson”.

203
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:52,433
Lionel says...

204
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:54,760
wait here if you  wish, Mrs Johnson.

205
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:59,786
Or, it being a p-

206
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:07,147
pleasant day,
p-perhaps take a stroll.

207
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,515
Was that alright...Lionel?

208
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,264
Marvellous! Willy.
You can stay and wait for your mom.

209
00:19:20,098 --> 00:19:21,418
Mrs Johnson...

210
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,619
Mr Johnson, Do come in.

211
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,547
He’s a good lad, Willy.

212
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:49,875
He could hardly make a sound, you know,

213
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,775
when he first came to me.

214
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:02,541
My boys made those.
Good, aren’t they?

215
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:06,238
Please make yourself comfortable.

216
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,819
I was told not to sit too close.

217
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,756
Well I believe when speaking with a Prince,

218
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:37,556
One waits for the prince to choose a topic.

219
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:47,491
Waiting for me to...
commence

220
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:51,863
a conversation ..
one can wait a rather long wait.

221
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:02,121
Do you Know any jokes?

222
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Timing isn’t my strong suit.

223
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,972
Cuppa tea?

224
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,902
No thank you.

225
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,964
Aren’t you going to start treating me
Dr Logue?

226
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:37,073
Only if you’re interested in being treated.

227
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:40,728
Please,
call me Lionel.

228
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:44,977
I prefer Doctor.

229
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:49,240
I prefer Lionel.
What’ll I call you?

230
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:55,057
Your Royal Highness,
then Sir after that.

231
00:21:55,092 --> 00:21:58,658
A bit formal for here.
What about your name?

232
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:05,018
Prince Albert ...Frederick Arthur
George?

233
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:07,361
How about Bertie?

234
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:12,754
Only my family uses that.

235
00:22:12,804 --> 00:22:17,193
Perfect.
In here, it’s better if we’re equals.

236
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:27,304
If we were equal I wouldn’t be
here.

237
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,472
I’d be at home with my wife

238
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:33,568
and no-one would give a damn.

239
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:36,407
Please, Don’t do that.

240
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:37,694
I'm sorry?

241
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:41,349
I believe, Sucking smoke
into your lungs will kill you.

242
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,787
My physicians say
it relaxes the throat.

243
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,099
They’re idiots.

244
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,555
They’ve all been knighted.

245
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:50,507
Makes it official then.

246
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:55,103
My ‘castle’, my rules.

247
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:04,592
What was your earliest memory?

248
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,306
What?
an earth do you mean?

249
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:08,307
Your First recollection.

250
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:09,457
I'm not...

251
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:15,007
here to discuss my personal matters.

252
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:16,328
Why’re you here then?

253
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:17,502
Because I bloody well stammer!

254
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:21,254
You have a bit of a temper?

255
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:23,117
One of my many faults.

256
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,028
When did the defect start?

257
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:27,029
I've always been this way!

258
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,030
I doubt that.

259
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,345
Don’t tell me! It’s my stammer!

260
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:33,297
- Its my field.

261
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:36,976
I can assure you,
no infant starts to speak with a stammer.

262
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:38,878
When did yours start?

263
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:42,255
four or five.

264
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:43,783
That's typical.

265
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:45,981
So I’ve been told.

266
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:48,846
I can’t remember not doing it.

267
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:53,684
I can believe that. Do you hesitate
when you think?

268
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:55,380
Don’t be ridiculous.

269
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:57,731
How about
when you talk to yourself?

270
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:01,794
Everyone natters occasionally
Bertie.

271
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:03,497
Stop calling me that!

272
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:05,298
I’m not going to call you anything
else.

273
00:24:05,348 --> 00:24:06,998
Then we shan’t speak!

274
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:24,892
Are you charging for this, Doctor?

275
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:28,624
A fortune.

276
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:41,847
So, when you
talk to yourself, do you stammer?

277
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:46,330
Of course not!

278
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,669
Well, that proves your impediment isn’t
a permanent part of you.

279
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,820
What do
you think was the cause?

280
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,898
I don't know.

281
00:24:56,423 --> 00:24:59,894
I don’t care!
I stammer!

282
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:04,565
And no one can fix it.

283
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:08,601
I Bet you,  you can read
flawlessly, right here, right now.

284
00:25:08,602 --> 00:25:12,511
And if I win, I get to ask
questions.

285
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:13,944
- And if I win?

286
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,929
- You don’t have to answer.

287
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:19,934
One usually ...
wagers money.

288
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:21,951
A bob each to sweeten it?

289
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:24,370
Lets See your shilling??

290
00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:27,802
- I don’t...
carry money.

291
00:25:27,837 --> 00:25:29,984
- I had a funny feeling you mightn’t.

292
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:33,579
I'll stake you.
You can  Pay me back next time.

293
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:35,235
- Who says there is a next time?

294
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,785
- I haven’t agreed
to take you on, yet.

295
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,358
Please stand.
and take a look at that...

296
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:54,196
I can’t  read this.

297
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,981
Then you owe me a shilling ,
for not trying.

298
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:14,477
“To be...
or not to be,....That...

299
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:20,687
I can’t read!

300
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:24,132
I haven’t finished yet.

301
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:37,232
I’m going to record your voice and
then play it back to you on the same machine.

302
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:38,694
This is brilliant.

303
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,944
It’s the latest thing from America:
its a Silvertone.

304
00:26:54,977 --> 00:26:56,408
Pop this on?

305
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:01,586
There’s a bob in this, mate. You
can go home rich!

306
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,543
- You’re playing music.
- I know.

307
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:14,987
How can I hear what I’m saying?!

308
00:27:15,022 --> 00:27:18,034
Surely a Prince’s brain knows what
its mouth is doing?

309
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:22,330
You’re not well acquainted with
Royal Princes, are you?

310
00:27:59,195 --> 00:28:01,227
Hopeless.
Hopeless!

311
00:28:04,523 --> 00:28:09,691
You were sublime. Would I lie to a
prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?

312
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:14,378
I’ve no idea what an Australian
might do for that sort of money.

313
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:16,363
Let me play it back to you.

314
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:18,937
No.

315
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:21,259
All right then,
I get to ask you the question.

316
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:22,260
Thank you Doctor,

317
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:26,138
I don't feel..
this is for me.

318
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,785
Thank You for your time,
Bye.

319
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:38,575
- Sir?

320
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:45,720
the recording is free.

321
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,111
Please..
keep it as a souvenir.

322
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:23,776
<i>KING GEORGE V (O.S.)
For the present, the work to which
we are all equally bound,</i>

323
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:26,926
<i>is to arrive at a reasoned
tranquillity...</i>

324
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:34,271
<i>...within our borders, to regain
prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking</i>

325
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:42,683
<i>and to carry with us those whom the
burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.</i>

326
00:29:42,718 --> 00:29:45,371
<i>To all,
to each,</i>

327
00:29:45,406 --> 00:29:49,954
<i>I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.</i>

328
00:29:57,237 --> 00:29:58,987
Easy when you know how.

329
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,805
Have a go yourself.

330
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,390
Congratulations, Sir.

331
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,461
Ah, Mr Wood.

332
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:17,997
Splendid fellow. Chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.

333
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,933
Sit up,
straight back,

334
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:27,438
face boldly up to the bloody thing
and stare it square in the eye,

335
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:29,117
as you would any decent Englishman.

336
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:30,740
Show who’s in command.

337
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,290
Papa, I D-d-don’t
thu-thu-think I c-c-can read this.

338
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,480
- This devilish device will change
everything if you don’t.

339
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:42,728
In the past all a King had to do was look
respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.

340
00:30:42,763 --> 00:30:46,713
Now we must invade people’s homes
and ingratiate ourselves with them.

341
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:51,248
This family is reduced to those lowest,
basest of all creatures...

342
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,375
we’ve become...actors!

343
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:56,370
- we’re not a family,
we’re a firm.

344
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:59,204
- Yet at any moment,
some of us may be out of work.

345
00:30:59,254 --> 00:31:02,244
Your darling brother,
and future king!

346
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:06,725
The only wife he appears interested in
is invariably the wife of another!

347
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:09,171
- He’s broken off
with Lady Furness.

348
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:10,123
And taken up a Mrs Simpson,

349
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:12,898
a woman
with two husbands living!

350
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:17,583
I told him straight,
no divorced person could ever be received at court.

351
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,718
He said,
"It made him sublimely happy."

352
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:26,177
I imagined that was because she was
sleeping with him.

353
00:31:26,212 --> 00:31:28,962
“I give you my word..'
this is what he said.

354
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,658
“I give you my
word we’ve never had immoral relations,”

355
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:36,869
Stared square into his father’s eyes...
and lied!

356
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:41,502
When I’m dead that boy will ruin
himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.

357
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:42,966
Who’ll pick up the pieces?

358
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:47,829
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of
Europe, Marshall Stalin the other half?

359
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:54,634
Who’ll stand between us, the
jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?

360
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:57,625
You?

361
00:32:02,282 --> 00:32:07,382
With your older brother shirking his duties,
you’re going to have to do a lot more of this.

362
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,791
Have a go yourself.
Son.

363
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:21,271
Get it out boy!

364
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:27,195
...m-marvels of m-
- Modern...

365
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,739
just take your time -
form your words carefully

366
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:38,634
Science, I am enabled, this ...
- Relax!

367
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,070
Just try it!

368
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:53,021
Do it!

369
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:09,657
Lying ..
bastard.

370
00:33:51,702 --> 00:33:54,751
<i>“To be, or not to be,
- that is the question: -</i>

371
00:33:54,752 --> 00:34:01,245
<i>“...whether tis nobler in the mind
to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</i>

372
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:07,446
<i>Or to take arms against a sea of
troubles, And by opposing end them..”</i>

373
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:11,262
<i>"..to die...
to sleep; no more.."</i>

374
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:27,976
Strictly  business.

375
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:32,966
No p..
personal nonsense.

376
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:35,178
I thought I’d made that very clear
in our interview.

377
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:37,018
- Got the shilling you owe me?

378
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:38,697
- No I haven’t!

379
00:34:38,732 --> 00:34:40,233
- Didn’t think so.

380
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:43,163
Besides,
you tricked me!

381
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:45,912
Physical excercises and tricks are important...

382
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:48,697
What you’re asking will only deal
with the surface of the problem.

383
00:34:48,747 --> 00:34:50,487
That’s sufficient.

384
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,465
As far as i see it,
My hausband...

385
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,693
has mechanical difficulties with his speech.

386
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,462
Maybe...
Just deal with that.

387
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:07,306
- I’m willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
- Lionel.

388
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:11,795
- Are you..
are you willing to do your part?

389
00:35:15,443 --> 00:35:17,148
Alright.
You want mechanics?

390
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,627
We need to relax your throat muscles
and strengthen your tongue.

391
00:35:20,677 --> 00:35:23,308
By repeating tongue twisters for example.

392
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,652
<i>“I am a thistle-sifter. I have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.</i>

393
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:29,362
<i>Because I am a thistle sifter.”</i>

394
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:30,412
- Fine!

395
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:35,139
You have a flabby tummy,
we must build up the strength in your diaphragm.

396
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,429
Simple mechanics.

397
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:37,444
That is all we ask.

398
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:38,620
And that’s about a shilling’s worth.

399
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,970
Forget about the blessed shilling!

400
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:57,459
Perhaps, upon occasion,

401
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:07,834
you might be requested
some assistance in cope with a minor event.

402
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,530
Will that agreeable?

403
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:11,427
Of course.

404
00:36:13,587 --> 00:36:15,491
That will be the full extent of your services.

405
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,276
- Shall I see you next week?

406
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:19,402
- I shall see you every day.

407
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,313
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.

408
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:27,364
Feel the loosening of the jaw

409
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:44,874
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand your chest..

410
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:51,346
How do you feel?

411
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:53,504
full of hot air.

412
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:56,489
- Isn’t that what public speaking is all about?

413
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:11,536
Are you alright, Bertie?

414
00:37:11,586 --> 00:37:13,786
This is actually quite good fun,

415
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:16,787
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello David.

416
00:39:29,676 --> 00:39:31,176
Where’ve you been?

417
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:34,413
Been busy.
- So was I.

418
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,144
Elizabeth has pneumonia.

419
00:39:38,194 --> 00:39:40,791
I’m sorry. She’ll recover.

420
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,540
Father won’t.

421
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:47,191
- I’ll drive.

422
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:52,190
Old bugger’s doing this on purpose.

423
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,045
Dying?

424
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,565
Departing prematurely...
to complicate matters.

425
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,286
Oh for heaven’s sake, David. You
know how long he’s been ill.

426
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:08,333
Wallis explained. She’s terribly
clever about this thing.

427
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:17,114
LORD WIGRAM:
... whereas by letters patent underthe Great Seal, bearing date of
Westminster, the eleventh June 1912

428
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:23,066
his Majesty King George V did constitute,
order and declare that there should be a guardian,

429
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:27,708
Custos Regni,
in the form of Councillors of State

430
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:31,889
It’s the order of the Council for
the State, Sir.

431
00:40:31,924 --> 00:40:36,161
So we may act on your behalf.

432
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:43,561
I’m still confused...

433
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:44,896
Approved.

434
00:40:44,931 --> 00:40:46,129
Thank you.

435
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,081
Feeling a little better Sir?

436
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:16,081
No. I’m not feeling any better. I
feel dreadful.

437
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:21,649
Have you been ice skating?
..Ice skating.

438
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:23,167
No, George.

439
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,792
...I know, darling, a talk, even a
lovely long talk, is a poor substitute

440
00:41:44,842 --> 00:41:50,583
for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either,

441
00:41:50,618 --> 00:41:51,982
as we’ve had to dofar too often lately.

442
00:41:52,032 --> 00:41:53,292
David, Dinner?

443
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:54,992
- I’m on with Wallis!

444
00:42:12,683 --> 00:42:13,757
Wallis misses me terribly.

445
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:16,157
- Mama says you’re late for dinner.

446
00:42:23,196 --> 00:42:26,996
- She forgets Papa’s bloody clocks
were always half an hour fast!

447
00:42:42,188 --> 00:42:44,652
How is the king?
I hope he is not in pain.

448
00:42:44,702 --> 00:42:47,531
No, no, His Majesty,
he’s quieter now.

449
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:51,449
Thank you.

450
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:00,620
David, If your father were well, tardiness
would not be tolerated.

451
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:05,543
None of this..
unpleasantness would be tolerated

452
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:16,514
You know Sir, I appreciate that yo
are different from your father in your outlook and temperament.

453
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:21,073
I want you to know that whenever
the King questioned your conduct,

454
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:27,545
I  tried in your interest, to present
it in a most favourable light.

455
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:32,558
I can always trust you to have my
best interests at heart.

456
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:49,165
I fear, our vigil will not be of
long duration.

457
00:43:49,215 --> 00:43:50,665
Please, continue.

458
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:10,843
We commend our brother George to
the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.

459
00:44:24,476 --> 00:44:26,026
Long live the King.

460
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,268
I hope,
I will make good as he has made good.

461
00:45:18,288 --> 00:45:19,473
What on earth was that?

462
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:22,792
Poor Wallis.
Now I’m trapped!

463
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,750
Time for a Shake, dad?

464
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:02,689
You sure?

465
00:46:02,724 --> 00:46:04,003
Go on.

466
00:46:12,897 --> 00:46:14,797
Put your thinking caps on.

467
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:19,122
Bet its the Scottish Play.

468
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:21,922
No, I bet it’s Othello.
It’s always Othello.

469
00:46:32,201 --> 00:46:33,701
<i>“Art thou afeard?”</i>

470
00:46:36,058 --> 00:46:37,128
Caliban!

471
00:46:37,163 --> 00:46:40,593
Oh! For heaven’s sake.. that was a
lucky guess!

472
00:46:40,628 --> 00:46:42,978
Don’t listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.

473
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:48,864
<i>“the isle is full ofnoises,Sounds and sweet airs,
that give delight, and hurt not.</i>

474
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:54,093
<i>Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments
Will hum about mine ears;</i>

475
00:46:54,128 --> 00:46:59,734
<i>and sometimes voices,That, if then I had waked after
long sleep,Will make me sleep again:”</i>

476
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:02,552
Alright, clever clogs,
what comes next?

477
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:06,866
“..and then, in dreaming,
The clouds me thought would open,

478
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:10,952
and show riches Ready to drop upon me;
that when I'm awake...”

479
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:12,315
...when I waked, I cried to dream again.”

480
00:47:12,365 --> 00:47:14,165
It’s such a sad thought.

481
00:47:16,513 --> 00:47:18,338
My next patient must be early.

482
00:47:18,388 --> 00:47:20,488
You better go lads, I’m sorry.

483
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,480
Won’t be a moment, Clifford.

484
00:47:27,376 --> 00:47:32,312
Bertie!
they told me not to expect you.

485
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,529
I am Sorry about your father.

486
00:47:38,352 --> 00:47:39,529
I don’t wish to intrude..

487
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:41,744
oh no...
course. Please come in.

488
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:57,304
I’ve been practising. One hour a
day. In spite of everything.

489
00:47:59,328 --> 00:48:01,028
What’s going on there?

490
00:48:03,288 --> 00:48:05,938
I was, sorry,
mucking around with my kids.

491
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,390
Do you feel like working today?

492
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:17,769
A Curtis bi-plane.

493
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:19,719
I’ll put on some hot milk.

494
00:48:19,754 --> 00:48:24,023
Logue, I’d kill for something stronger.

495
00:48:29,903 --> 00:48:33,351
I wasn’t there for my father’s
death. Still makes me sad.

496
00:48:33,386 --> 00:48:35,527
I can imagine so.

497
00:48:38,286 --> 00:48:39,368
What did you father do?

498
00:48:39,418 --> 00:48:40,958
He was a brewer.

499
00:48:40,993 --> 00:48:43,043
At least there was free beer.

500
00:48:44,647 --> 00:48:47,047
Here’s to the memory of your father.

501
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:55,317
I was informed,
after the fact...

502
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:59,738
that  my father’s last words were:

503
00:49:02,244 --> 00:49:06,333
“Bertie has more guts than the rest of his
brothers put together.”

504
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:13,829
He couldn’t say that to my face.

505
00:49:18,533 --> 00:49:19,683
My brother.

506
00:49:22,014 --> 00:49:23,364
What about him?

507
00:49:26,278 --> 00:49:27,478
Try singing.

508
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:29,792
I'm sorry.

509
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,349
Know any songs?

510
00:49:31,384 --> 00:49:32,790
Songs?

511
00:49:32,825 --> 00:49:34,094
Yes songs.

512
00:49:34,129 --> 00:49:35,294
“Swanee River”.

513
00:49:35,344 --> 00:49:36,381
I love that song.

514
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,847
Happens to be my favorite.

515
00:49:37,897 --> 00:49:39,359
Sing me the chorus.

516
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,959
No.  Certainly not.

517
00:49:45,223 --> 00:49:50,886
Always wanted to build models.
Father wouldn’t allow it.

518
00:49:52,613 --> 00:49:57,222
He collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.

519
00:49:58,986 --> 00:50:01,386
You can finish that off.
If you sing.

520
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:09,385
I'm not going to sit here,
wobbling.

521
00:50:09,435 --> 00:50:10,807
You can with me.

522
00:50:10,857 --> 00:50:12,927
Because you’re peculiar.

523
00:50:12,962 --> 00:50:14,962
I take that as a compliment.

524
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:29,175
I’m not crooning “Swanee River!”

525
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,823
Try “Camptown Races” then.

526
00:50:30,873 --> 00:50:36,894
“My brother D, he said to me, doo-
dah doo-dah...” Continuous sound will give you flow.

527
00:50:48,526 --> 00:50:51,726
Does it feel strange,
now that David’s on the throne?

528
00:50:53,025 --> 00:50:54,344
To tell the truth,

529
00:50:54,394 --> 00:50:55,569
It was a relief...

530
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:00,329
Knowing I wouldn’t be King.

531
00:51:00,364 --> 00:51:05,784
But unless he produces an heir,
you’re next in line.

532
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:10,562
And your daughter, Elizabeth,
would then succeed you.

533
00:51:12,296 --> 00:51:15,664
“You’re barking up the wrong tree
now, Doctor, Doctor.”

534
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:19,392
“Lionel” See?
You didn’stammer.

535
00:51:19,427 --> 00:51:22,248
Of course I didn’t stammer, I was singing!

536
00:51:25,698 --> 00:51:29,598
Well, as a little reward, you get
to put some glue on these struts.

537
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,514
Your boy,
won't mind?

538
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:37,899
No, not at all.

539
00:51:42,155 --> 00:51:48,411
David and I were very close. Young
bucks... You know.

540
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:52,604
Chase the same girls?

541
00:51:56,963 --> 00:52:10,810
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations of “Paulette” in Paris.

542
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:19,672
Not at the same time of course.

543
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:25,260
Did David tease you?

544
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,682
Yes, they all did.
“Buh-buh-buh-Bertie”.

545
00:52:30,754 --> 00:52:35,755
Father encouraged it. “Get it out,
boy!” Said it would make me stop.

546
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:44,099
Said...”I was afraid of my father,
and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me”.

547
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:48,761
Are you naturally right handed?

548
00:52:51,837 --> 00:52:57,269
Left.
I was punished. Now I use the right.

549
00:52:57,304 --> 00:53:00,277
Yes, that’s very common with stammerers.

550
00:53:04,253 --> 00:53:05,967
Anything other corrections?

551
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:08,156
Knock knees.

552
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:15,700
Metal splints were made...worn
night and day.

553
00:53:17,836 --> 00:53:19,069
That must have been painful.

554
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,333
Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.

555
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:27,962
Who were you closest to in your family?

556
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:34,900
Nannies. Not my first nanny,
though..she loved David...hated me.

557
00:53:34,935 --> 00:53:45,676
When we are presented to my parents
for the daily viewing, she’d pinch me..

558
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:49,641
I'd cry and
be handed back to her..

559
00:53:49,676 --> 00:53:50,876
immediately.

560
00:53:54,153 --> 00:53:56,760
Then...
she would...

561
00:53:59,785 --> 00:54:01,128
Sing it.

562
00:54:02,808 --> 00:54:08,968
" then she wouldn’t feed me,
far far away.”

563
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:16,039
Took three years for my parents to notice.

564
00:54:16,074 --> 00:54:24,200
As you can imagine, it
caused some stomach problems. Still.

565
00:54:29,879 --> 00:54:32,079
What about your brother Johnnie?

566
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:35,635
Were you close to him?

567
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:39,462
Johnny..
Sweet boy.

568
00:54:49,311 --> 00:54:52,470
Epilepsy...and...

569
00:54:52,505 --> 00:54:55,967
he was ’different’.

570
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:04,062
Died at 13, hidden from view.

571
00:55:08,414 --> 00:55:11,838
I’ve been told it’s not catching.

572
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,712
Do you want a top-up?

573
00:55:19,134 --> 00:55:20,344
Please.

574
00:55:25,574 --> 00:55:31,158
You know, Lionel, you’re the first
ordinary Englishman...

575
00:55:31,193 --> 00:55:32,519
Australian.

576
00:55:34,759 --> 00:55:36,859
...I’ve ever really spoken to.

577
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:43,271
Sometimes, when I ride through the
streets and see, you know,

578
00:55:45,353 --> 00:55:47,000
the Common Man staring at me,

579
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:52,377
I’m struck by how little I know of hislife,
and how little he knows of mine.

580
00:55:52,378 --> 00:55:53,478
Thank you.

581
00:55:55,214 --> 00:55:56,814
What’re friends for.

582
00:56:00,198 --> 00:56:01,598
I wouldn’t know.

583
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:15,967
<i>“I sifted seven thick-stalked
thistles through strong thicksieves. I sifted seven...”</i>

584
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:30,671
One hundred year old
oaks...removed to improve the view!

585
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,161
Who does she think she is!

586
00:56:33,211 --> 00:56:36,306
Nonetheless...we must try to be
pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.

587
00:56:36,356 --> 00:56:38,555
You know she calls me “The Fat
Scottish Cook”?

588
00:56:38,605 --> 00:56:39,955
You’re not fat.

589
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,931
I’m getting plump.

590
00:56:44,383 --> 00:56:45,783
You seldom cook.

591
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,321
I sifted seven.

592
00:56:49,371 --> 00:56:50,609
Shut up!!

593
00:57:00,912 --> 00:57:04,062
<i>Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and
Duchess of York.</i>

594
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:06,105
How lovely to see you both.

595
00:57:08,689 --> 00:57:11,039
Welcome
to our little country shack.

596
00:57:12,986 --> 00:57:15,386
I came at the invitation of the
King.

597
00:57:40,762 --> 00:57:41,811
Hello David.

598
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:45,250
you’re making some changes to
the garden, I see

599
00:57:45,285 --> 00:57:47,875
yes, I am.
I am not quite finished.

600
00:57:52,997 --> 00:57:54,765
Don’t tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.

601
00:57:54,815 --> 00:58:02,357
On the contrary, your Royal
Highness. Etiquette decrees royalty
must be greeted by the official host: in this case: the King.

602
00:58:02,392 --> 00:58:07,724
Not a commoner.
- Thank you.

603
00:58:08,883 --> 00:58:10,332
What is her hold on him?

604
00:58:10,382 --> 00:58:11,732
I have no idea.

605
00:58:14,643 --> 00:58:16,764
Apparently she has
certain...skills,

606
00:58:16,814 --> 00:58:20,412
...in an establishment in Shanghai.

607
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:42,919
David,
I’ve been trying to see you...

608
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:44,680
I’ve been terribly busy.

609
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:45,880
Doing what?

610
00:58:47,297 --> 00:58:48,162
Kinging.

611
00:58:48,212 --> 00:58:50,857
Kinging?

612
00:58:52,298 --> 00:58:54,201
is a precarious business!
These days.

613
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:57,637
Where is the Russian Tsar?
Where is Cousin Wilhelm?

614
00:58:57,672 --> 00:58:59,272
You’re being dreary.

615
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:03,830
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff at Sandringham

616
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:06,868
and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there ar
people marching across Europe singing “The Red Flag”?

617
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,929
Stop your worrying. Herr Hitler
will sort that lot out.

618
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:10,979
Who’ll sort out Herr Hitler?

619
00:59:13,072 --> 00:59:14,680
And you’ve put that woman into our
mother’s suite?

620
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,648
Mother’s not still in the bed,
is she?

621
00:59:16,698 --> 00:59:18,148
That’s not funny.

622
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,726
Wally likes the very best.

623
00:59:20,776 --> 00:59:24,093
I don’t care what woman you carry
on with at night,

624
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:27,078
as long as you show up for duty in the morning!

625
00:59:27,171 --> 00:59:29,564
Wally is not just some woman I am
carrying on with.

626
00:59:29,614 --> 00:59:31,180
We intend to marry.

627
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:34,969
Excuse me?

628
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:37,354
She’s filing a petition for
divorce.

629
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:39,449
Good God.

630
00:59:41,233 --> 00:59:43,890
Can’t you just give her a nice
house and a title?

631
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,594
I won’t have her as my mistress.

632
00:59:45,644 --> 00:59:48,954
David, the Church does not
recognise divorce and you are the head of the Church.

633
00:59:49,004 --> 00:59:50,385
Haven’t I any rights?

634
00:59:50,435 --> 00:59:52,328
Many privileges...

635
00:59:52,363 --> 00:59:53,664
Not the same thing.

636
00:59:53,714 --> 00:59:56,144
Your beloved Common Man may marry for love,

637
00:59:56,194 --> 00:59:57,184
why not me?

638
00:59:57,234 --> 01:00:02,672
If you were the Common Man, on what
basis could you possibly claim to be King?!

639
01:00:02,707 --> 01:00:05,024
Sounds like you’ve studied our
wretched constitution.

640
01:00:05,074 --> 01:00:05,913
Sounds like you haven’t.

641
01:00:05,963 --> 01:00:12,023
Is that what this is all about? Brushing up..
hence the elocution lessons?

642
01:00:12,058 --> 01:00:16,896
I’m trying to t-t...

643
01:00:19,322 --> 01:00:22,472
Yearning for a larger audience are we,
B-b-b-bertie?

644
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:28,258
D-don’t ...

645
01:00:31,779 --> 01:00:35,179
Younger brother trying to push older
brother off throne..

646
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:37,719
Pa pa..
...Positively medieval.

647
01:00:43,053 --> 01:00:46,203
Where have you been all this time?
- Never you mind.

648
01:00:49,115 --> 01:00:53,625
Ahh..what a complicated
lovely coon you are.

649
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:54,960
- I try to be.

650
01:00:57,234 --> 01:00:59,490
All that work, down the drain.

651
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:03,339
My own brother...

652
01:01:03,389 --> 01:01:05,946
I couldn’t say..
I couldn’t say a word in reply!

653
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,685
Why do you stammer more with David
than you do with me?

654
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,021
Because you’re bloody well paid to listen!

655
01:01:12,071 --> 01:01:14,121
Bertie,
I’m not a geisha girl.

656
01:01:15,276 --> 01:01:16,405
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!

657
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:19,061
What is it about David that stops you speaking?

658
01:01:19,111 --> 01:01:23,977
What is it about you, that bloody makes
want you to go on about it, all the time.

659
01:01:24,012 --> 01:01:27,085
Vulgar but fluent. You don’t
stammer when you swear.

660
01:01:27,135 --> 01:01:28,022
Bugger off!

661
01:01:28,072 --> 01:01:29,445
Is that the best you can do?

662
01:01:29,495 --> 01:01:35,252
Well, bloody bugger to you,
you beastly bastard.

663
01:01:35,287 --> 01:01:38,444
A public school prig can do better
than that.

664
01:01:40,198 --> 01:01:41,098
Shit !

665
01:01:42,213 --> 01:01:44,469
Shit, shit, shit!
shit!

666
01:01:48,819 --> 01:01:50,468
See how defecation flows trippingly
from the tongue?

667
01:01:50,518 --> 01:01:51,492
Because I’m angry!

668
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:53,142
You Know the f-word?

669
01:01:56,107 --> 01:01:56,859
Fornication?

670
01:01:56,909 --> 01:01:58,009
OH Bertie.

671
01:01:59,043 --> 01:02:01,923
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!

672
01:02:07,395 --> 01:02:09,666
Yes! You see! Not a hesitation!

673
01:02:09,701 --> 01:02:13,220
Bloody, bloody, bloody! Shit, shit,
shit! Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

674
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,131
Dad? What’s going on?

675
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:17,803
Sorry. Finish your homework

676
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:23,271
Well ..that’s a side of you we don’t
get to see that often.

677
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:27,027
No. No we’re not supposed to
really, not publicly.

678
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:29,215
Let’s get some air.

679
01:02:29,265 --> 01:02:32,343
No Logue, I don’t think that’s a
good idea.

680
01:02:34,658 --> 01:02:37,358
What’s the matter?
What’s got you so upset?

681
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:40,633
Logue, you have no idea.

682
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:50,369
My brother is infatuated with a woman who’s
been married twice.

683
01:02:50,943 --> 01:02:54,693
She’s asking for a divorce and
David is determined to marry her.

684
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,783
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.

685
01:03:01,832 --> 01:03:03,449
That’s not right.
Queen Wallis of Baltimore?

686
01:03:03,499 --> 01:03:04,699
Unthinkable.

687
01:03:06,304 --> 01:03:07,337
Can he do that?

688
01:03:07,387 --> 01:03:10,399
Absolutely not.
But he’s going to anyway.

689
01:03:10,434 --> 01:03:12,234
All hell’s broken loose.

690
01:03:13,848 --> 01:03:15,737
- Can’t they carry on privately?

691
01:03:15,787 --> 01:03:17,437
- If only they would.

692
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,480
- Where does that leave you?

693
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:25,019
I know my place!

694
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:31,720
I’ll do anything...
in my power to keep my brother on the throne.

695
01:03:33,831 --> 01:03:36,136
-Is it that serious?

696
01:03:37,138 --> 01:03:38,571
your place may be on the throne.

697
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:40,386
I am not an alternative to my
brother.

698
01:03:40,436 --> 01:03:41,955
If you had to you could outshine David...

699
01:03:42,005 --> 01:03:43,655
Don’t take liberties!

700
01:03:44,858 --> 01:03:45,939
That’s bordering on treason.

701
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,906
I’m just saying you could be King.
You could do it!

702
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:49,361
That is treason!

703
01:03:49,396 --> 01:03:51,561
I’m trying to get you to realise
you need not be governed by fear.

704
01:03:51,611 --> 01:03:53,411
I’ve had enough of this!

705
01:03:54,546 --> 01:03:55,505
What’re you afraid of?

706
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:56,594
Your poisonous words!

707
01:03:56,644 --> 01:03:58,253
Why’d you come to me?

708
01:03:58,303 --> 01:04:02,350
You are not some middle class bugger,
who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...

709
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,245
Don’t instruct me on my duties!

710
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,556
I’m the son of a ....
King...

711
01:04:09,787 --> 01:04:11,134
the brother of a king.

712
01:04:11,184 --> 01:04:14,661
You’re the disappointing son of a brewer!

713
01:04:14,696 --> 01:04:17,821
A jumped-up jackeroo from the
outback!

714
01:04:19,517 --> 01:04:20,817
You’re nobody.

715
01:04:21,572 --> 01:04:23,372
These sessions are over!

716
01:05:05,732 --> 01:05:09,430
It’s not because she’s an American.
That is the least of it.

717
01:05:10,926 --> 01:05:14,527
It’s because she is a soon to
be a twice divorced American,

718
01:05:15,898 --> 01:05:21,650
and the King as  head of The Church of England...
can not marry a divorced woman.

719
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:28,745
And Sir,
I apologize for the nature of this,

720
01:05:29,078 --> 01:05:35,735
according to Scotland Yard,
the King has not always possess exclusive..rights

721
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:42,384
to Mrs. Simpson’s...
favours and affections,

722
01:05:43,647 --> 01:05:45,878
sharing them with a
married used car salesman,

723
01:05:45,928 --> 01:05:47,965
a certain Mr Guy Trundle.

724
01:05:50,734 --> 01:05:53,249
In addition, it is also rumoured...

725
01:05:54,425 --> 01:05:59,120
Hitler’s ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop,
sends her 17 carnations every day.

726
01:06:01,337 --> 01:06:06,154
Should your brother continue to
ignore the advice of His Government, He must abdicate.

727
01:06:06,204 --> 01:06:10,225
Otherwise His Government has no
choice but to resign.

728
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,298
Prime Minister,

729
01:06:11,348 --> 01:06:16,602
you’d leave the
country without a government?

730
01:06:18,762 --> 01:06:20,912
Does the King do what he wants,

731
01:06:22,161 --> 01:06:25,111
or does he do what his people expect him to do?

732
01:06:32,644 --> 01:06:34,085
What’s the matter, love?

733
01:06:34,135 --> 01:06:36,685
I'm Just having trouble with a patient.

734
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:42,334
That Isn't like you..
why?

735
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:48,064
He's scared...
He is afraid with his own shadow.

736
01:06:50,029 --> 01:06:52,229
Isn’t that why they come to you?

737
01:06:54,342 --> 01:06:57,792
This fellow could be somebody
great, and he’s fighting me.

738
01:06:59,742 --> 01:07:02,192
Perhaps, he doesn’t want to be great.

739
01:07:04,966 --> 01:07:07,016
Perhaps that’s what you want.

740
01:07:11,247 --> 01:07:13,547
I might have overstepped the mark.

741
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,310
Apologize,

742
01:07:16,345 --> 01:07:17,795
Do you both good.

743
01:07:30,244 --> 01:07:32,994
I’m very sorry, Mr Logue,
the Duke is  busy.

744
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:36,773
I’m happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.

745
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,300
As I said,
the Duke is terribly busy.

746
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:50,587
Thank you.

747
01:08:04,396 --> 01:08:07,596
The parliament will not support their marriage.

748
01:08:10,018 --> 01:08:11,828
But there were other reasons for concern, Sir.

749
01:08:11,878 --> 01:08:14,331
He was careless with state papers.

750
01:08:14,366 --> 01:08:15,892
He lacked commitment and resolve.

751
01:08:15,942 --> 01:08:20,539
There were those that worried where
he would stand when war comes with Germany .

752
01:08:23,768 --> 01:08:24,746
We’re not coming to that?

753
01:08:24,796 --> 01:08:26,681
Indeed we are, Sir.

754
01:08:26,716 --> 01:08:31,849
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this,
but Hitler’s intent is crystal clear.

755
01:08:33,336 --> 01:08:39,071
War with Germany will come, and we will need
a King behind whom we can all stand united.

756
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:44,259
I fear...my brother is not of

757
01:08:44,294 --> 01:08:47,684
sound mind, at this time.

758
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:52,419
Have you thought what you will call yourself?

759
01:08:59,063 --> 01:09:02,431
Certainly not Albert, Sir.
Too Germanic.

760
01:09:10,656 --> 01:09:11,857
What about George?

761
01:09:11,907 --> 01:09:15,712
After your father? George the sixth.

762
01:09:15,747 --> 01:09:21,168
It has rather a nice continuity to it,
don’t you think?

763
01:09:25,902 --> 01:09:27,352
David! Thank God.

764
01:09:29,142 --> 01:09:30,692
You look exhausted!

765
01:09:33,798 --> 01:09:35,548
How are you bearing up?

766
01:09:36,037 --> 01:09:38,337
Bertie.  The decision’s been made.

767
01:09:39,014 --> 01:09:40,264
I have to go.

768
01:09:42,198 --> 01:09:44,455
I cannot accept that.
You are in no condition to make that decision.

769
01:09:44,505 --> 01:09:45,743
I’m afraid there’s no other way.

770
01:09:45,793 --> 01:09:50,263
I must marry her.

771
01:09:50,298 --> 01:09:54,158
My mind’s made up.
I’m... sorry.

772
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:00,350
That’s a terrible thing to hear.

773
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:06,422
David, nobody wants that.
I least of all.

774
01:10:13,433 --> 01:10:18,826
<i>" At long last I am able to say,
a few words of my own.</i>

775
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:24,849
<i>I have never wanted to withhold anything,
but until now,</i>

776
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:28,452
<i>it has not been constitutionally
possible for me to speak.</i>

777
01:10:30,148 --> 01:10:36,797
<i>A few hours ago I discharged
my last duty as King and Emperor.</i>

778
01:10:39,509 --> 01:10:43,189
<i>Now that I have been succeeded by
my brother, the Duke of York</i>

779
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:48,302
<i>my first words must be
to declare my allegiance to him.</i>

780
01:10:48,352 --> 01:10:51,708
<i>This I do with all my heart.</i>

781
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:59,533
<i>You all know the reasons which have
impelled me to renounce the throne.</i>

782
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:03,111
<i>But you must believe me,
when I tell you</i>

783
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:10,153
<i>I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of
responsibility and to discharge my duties..</i>

784
01:11:10,203 --> 01:11:18,177
<i>as King as I would wish to do without
the help and support of the woman I love...</i>

785
01:11:20,338 --> 01:11:21,635
<i>And I want you to know,</i>

786
01:11:21,685 --> 01:11:25,882
<i>..This decision has been made less
difficult to me</i>

787
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:32,538
<i>by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his
long training in the public affairs of this country...</i>

788
01:11:34,554 --> 01:11:36,804
<i>...and with his fine qualities...</i>

789
01:11:37,602 --> 01:11:39,563
<i>...will be able to take my place forth with</i>

790
01:11:39,613 --> 01:11:47,794
<i>without interruption or
injury to the life and progress of the empire."</i>

791
01:13:04,733 --> 01:13:06,597
I meet you today...

792
01:13:13,525 --> 01:13:15,525
in circumstances which are -

793
01:13:48,913 --> 01:13:50,865
Mama, will we have space for our
horses in our new home?

794
01:13:50,915 --> 01:13:54,315
Of course we will, darling, we’ll
have a palace of rooms.

795
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:04,508
Curtsey.

796
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,188
Your Majesty.

797
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:27,150
How was it?

798
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:46,319
I’m trying to familiarise myself
with what a state paper looks like.

799
01:14:51,127 --> 01:14:54,903
A despatch from Mr Baldwin
which I don’t understand a word of.

800
01:14:58,982 --> 01:15:00,432
David’s finances.

801
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:10,262
The Christmas broadcast -

802
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:12,497
I think that might be a mistake.

803
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,592
Plans for the Coronation -

804
01:15:26,642 --> 01:15:30,502
I think that’s an even bigger mistake.

805
01:15:33,689 --> 01:15:35,351
I’m not a King.

806
01:15:40,289 --> 01:15:41,307
I’m a naval officer.

807
01:15:41,357 --> 01:15:43,257
Its the only thing I know.

808
01:15:45,554 --> 01:15:47,002
I’m not a King.

809
01:15:57,898 --> 01:16:00,594
Dear, dear man...

810
01:16:05,016 --> 01:16:10,192
You  know...
i refused your first two marriage proposals,

811
01:16:10,227 --> 01:16:11,897
not because I didn’t love you,

812
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:15,376
but because I couldn’t bear the royal cage.

813
01:16:15,411 --> 01:16:21,153
Couldn't bear the idea of a life
of tours and public duties,

814
01:16:21,188 --> 01:16:24,808
a life that no longer
was really to be my own.

815
01:16:24,843 --> 01:16:27,311
But then I thought...

816
01:16:27,346 --> 01:16:30,033
he stammers so beautifully...

817
01:16:30,068 --> 01:16:31,818
they’ll leave us alone.

818
01:16:58,144 --> 01:17:02,199
Waiting for a king to apologize,
one can wait rather a long wait.

819
01:17:07,528 --> 01:17:09,678
I’m afraid we’re slightly late.

820
01:17:12,528 --> 01:17:16,919
This is home. Myrtle’s at bridge.
I’ve made sure the boys are out.

821
01:17:16,954 --> 01:17:18,448
It’s lovely.

822
01:17:19,823 --> 01:17:21,323
Absolutely lovely.

823
01:17:32,367 --> 01:17:33,393
Would you like some tea, Ma’am?

824
01:17:33,443 --> 01:17:34,704
Yes. I’ll help myself.

825
01:17:34,754 --> 01:17:36,191
Off you go...

826
01:17:36,226 --> 01:17:38,626
Or must I knock your heads together?

827
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:42,240
Here’s your shilling,

828
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:54,493
I understand...

829
01:17:55,957 --> 01:17:58,257
what you were tryingto say, Logue.

830
01:17:59,013 --> 01:18:01,113
I went about it the wrong way.

831
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:03,258
I’m sorry.

832
01:18:05,998 --> 01:18:06,983
Now here I am.

833
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:12,214
Is the nation ready
for two minutes of radio silence?

834
01:18:12,249 --> 01:18:15,949
Every stammerer always fears they
will fall back to square one.

835
01:18:16,932 --> 01:18:18,005
I don’t let that happen.

836
01:18:18,055 --> 01:18:19,805
If I fail in my duty...

837
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,281
David could come back.

838
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:25,031
I’ve seen the placards

839
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:29,170
“Save Our King!”

840
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:32,050
They don’t mean me.

841
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,380
Every other monarch in history

842
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:43,168
succeeded someone who was dead,
or just about to be.

843
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:51,200
My predecessor is not
only alive, but very much so.

844
01:18:55,904 --> 01:18:57,454
What a bloody mess!

845
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,100
I can’t even give
them a Christmas Speech.

846
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:02,800
Like your Dad used to do?

847
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:04,190
Precisely.

848
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:06,470
He's not here anymore.

849
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:12,390
Yes he is. He’s on that shilling I gave you.

850
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:18,600
Easy enough to give away. You don’t have
to carry him around in your pocket.

851
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,040
Or your brother.

852
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:26,970
You don't need to be afraid of the things
as you were afraid of when you were five.

853
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:35,570
You’re very much your own man, Bertie.

854
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,000
Am I?

855
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:44,570
Your face is next, mate.

856
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,970
Lionel?

857
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,150
Myrtle!

858
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:50,600
- Is it alright?
- Yes.

859
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:54,200
Bertie, come here.

860
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,730
- Are you alright, Logue?
- Yes.

861
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,550
- Shall we go through?
- Trust me. It's important.

862
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:06,230
What is it?

863
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:10,920
- Your... Your...
- It's “Your Majesty”, the first time.

864
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:14,920
After that, it's “Ma’am,” as in Ham,
not Ma'lm as in Palm.

865
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:19,650
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.

866
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:24,620
I'm told your husband calls
my husband Bertie

867
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,660
and my husband calls your husband Lionel.

868
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:29,810
I trust you won't call me Liz.

869
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,660
Your Majesty, you may call me
Mrs Logue, Ma'am.

870
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,750
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue.

871
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:40,090
Logue, we can't stand here all day.

872
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:43,090
Yes we can. Look, I need to wait
for the right moment.

873
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,290
- Logue, you’re being a coward!
- You're damn right.

874
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:50,010
Get out there, man!

875
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:53,070
Hello, Myrtle darling!

876
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:59,440
You're early. I believe you two have met!
But I didn't think, you know...

877
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:04,330
King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.

878
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:11,220
Will their Majesties be staying
to dinner?

879
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:16,220
We would love to, such a treat,
but alas...

880
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:19,230
a previous engagement. What a pitty.

881
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,950
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, your Majesty.

882
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,800
What a glorious tranformation, Sir.

883
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,830
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue
out preparations.

884
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:52,330
And now you will allow me to guide you
through the ceremony.

885
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:01,300
We begin of course at the West door,
then into the nave.

886
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:07,230
I see you all your pronouncements are
to be broadcast, Archbishop.

887
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:12,530
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora’s Box.

888
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:16,850
I'm afraid I also have to permit
the newsreel cameras.

889
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:20,370
The product of which I shall personally
edit.

890
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:23,060
Without momentary hesitation.

891
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:30,100
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
He's my speech therapist.

892
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:35,460
- Your Grace. - Had I known that Your
Majesty was seeking assistance

893
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:38,060
I should’ve made my own recommendation.

894
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:40,765
Dr. Logue...

895
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,690
will be attending the Coronation.

896
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:48,250
Well of course I shall speak with the Dean,
but it was extremely difficult.

897
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:55,820
I should like the Doctor to be seated
in the King's Box.

898
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:00,350
But members of your Family will be seated
there, Sir.

899
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,300
That is why it’s suitable.

900
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,510
And now, if you don’t mind Your Grace,
we need the premises.

901
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,250
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
The Church must prepare his Majesty.

902
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:14,090
My preparations are equalized in important

903
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,290
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.

904
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:25,270
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

905
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:33,550
I shall place the Abbey at Your Majesty’s
disposal... this evening. Your Majesty.

906
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,350
.

907
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,620
.

908
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:08,500
I can’t believe I’m walking on Chaucer
and Handel and Dickens.

909
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,670
Everything alright? Let's get cracking.

910
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:19,610
I’m not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.

911
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:24,280
Call me Lionel.

912
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:31,700
True, you... never...
called yourself "Doctor."

913
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:36,140
I did that... for you.

914
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:48,510
No training, no... diploma,
no... qualifications.

915
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,920
Just a... great deal of nerve.

916
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:56,630
The star chamber inquisition, is this?

917
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:02,090
You asked trust and... total equality.

918
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:06,200
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.

919
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,440
My son Laurie said “Dad, do you think
you could help that poor man?”

920
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:12,590
What, as a failed actor!?

921
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:18,570
It’s true, I’m not a doctor,
and yes I acted a bit,

922
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:23,800
Well I recited in pubs
and taught elocution in schools.

923
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,920
When the Great War came,

924
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:28,350
all our Soldiers were returning
straight from the front,

925
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,150
a lot of them shell-shocked,
unable to speak

926
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,590
somebody said, “Lionel, you're very good
at all this speech stuff.

927
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:37,890
Do you thin you can possibly help
these poor buggers.”

928
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:43,070
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation,
but I knew I had to go deeper.

929
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:49,680
These poor young blokes had cried out
in fear, no-one was listening to them.

930
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:54,320
My job was to give them faith
in their own voice

931
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,130
and let them know that a friend
was listening.

932
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:02,540
That must ring a few bells with you,
Bertie.

933
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,550
You give a very noble account of yourself.

934
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,700
Make inquiries. It’s all true.

935
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,370
Inquiries have been made! You have no idea
who I have breathing down my neck?

936
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:24,300
I vouched for you and you have no...
credentials.

937
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:27,930
But lots of success!
I can't show you certificate -

938
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:31,590
there was no training then.
Everything I know I know from experience,

939
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,120
and that war... was some experience.

940
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:40,050
My plaque says,
"L. Logue, Speech Defects."

941
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,800
No Dr., there are no letters
after my name.

942
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:50,520
Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could!

943
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:52,420
- On what charge?
- Fraud!

944
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,560
With war looming, you’ve saddled
this nation with a voiceless King.

945
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:03,340
You destroyed the happiness of my family.
All for the sake of ensnaring a star...

946
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:07,810
patient you couldn’t possibly hope
to assist!

947
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:14,470
It'll be like mad...
King George the Third,

948
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:22,000
there’ll be
mad King George the stammerer,

949
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,860
who let his people down so badly
in their hour of need!

950
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,050
What’re you doing? Get up!
You can’t sit there! Get up!

951
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,310
Why not? It’s a chair.

952
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,670
No, that's not a chair,
that is... that is...

953
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:40,270
That is Saint Edward's Chair!
- People have carved their names on it.

954
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,950
That chair is the seat on which every
King and Queen---

955
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,180
- It's held in a place by a large rock!
- That’s the Stone of Scone,

956
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:48,560
you are trivialising everything.
- You believe such bollocks.

957
01:27:48,610 --> 01:27:50,260
- You’re trivialising everything!
- I don’t care how many royal...

958
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:52,120
- Listen to me. Listen to me!
-  ...arse have sat in this chair.

959
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:54,130
- Listen to me... !
- Listen to you?! By what right?

960
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:56,140
By the divine right, if you must!
I’m your King!!!

961
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:58,990
No you’re not! You told me so yourself.
You said you didn’t want it.

962
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,530
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
- Because I have a right to be heard!

963
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,980
- Heard as what?!
- I HAVE A VOICE!!!

964
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,430
Yes you do.

965
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:24,250
You have such a perservance, Bertie,
you’re the bravest man I know.

966
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,980
And you’ll make a bloody good king.

967
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:38,130
- What on earth’s going on, Sir?
- It's quite alright, Archbishop.

968
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:42,070
Mr Logue, you must know that I found
a replacement English specialist

969
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:47,140
with impeccable credentials. Hence, your
services will no longer be required.

970
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:51,020
- I’m sorry? - Your Majesty's function
is to consult and be advised.

971
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:54,690
And you didn't consuly, but you've just
been advised.

972
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:03,270
Now I advise you: in this personal matter
I will make my own decision.

973
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:08,410
My concern is for the head upon
which I must place the crown.

974
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:13,460
I appreciate that Archbshop,
but it’s my head!

975
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,460
Your humble servant.

976
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,400
Thank you Bertie.

977
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:31,580
Shall we rehearse?
Come on up on your purge.

978
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:43,010
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through
the West door,

979
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:46,910
you’ll be greeted by the hymn
“I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me.”

980
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:51,610
Actually you won't be that glad, because
they sing it for a very long time.

981
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:56,880
Then your friend the Archbishop
will ponce up the stairs toward you

982
01:29:57,530 --> 01:30:02,380
and say “Sir, is Your Majesty willing
to take The Oath?”

983
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:06,170
- “I am willing”.
-  Course you are!

984
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:08,595
I'm gonna see what it sounds
like in the cheap seats

985
01:30:08,645 --> 01:30:10,845
so even your old nanny can hear.

986
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:16,080
“Will you govern your peoples of
Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,

987
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:21,580
Australia and New Zealand according to
their lands and customs?”

988
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:26,430
- "I solemnly promise so do so."
- LOUDER! I can’t hear you up the back.

989
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,990
“I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!”

990
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:30,650
Very good!

991
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:34,200
"Will you to your power cause Law
and Justice, in Mercy,

992
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:37,430
to be executed in all your judgements?"

993
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:39,450
"I will." “I WILL!”

994
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:42,130
Then there's a very long bit about
upholding the faith,

995
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:45,880
goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...

996
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:53,940
"The things which I have herebefore
promised, I will perform and keep.

997
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,860
So help me God.”

998
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:58,880
And that’s all you'll say.
Four short responses,

999
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,990
kiss the book and sign the oath
and you're King.

1000
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:04,330
Easy.

1001
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:20,460
You nearly crowned him backwards
Archbishop!

1002
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:25,800
Someone had removed the thread
marking the back of the Crown, Sir.

1003
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,760
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.

1004
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,670
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.

1005
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:39,570
Very good, very good. Archbishop.

1006
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:44,140
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled
with the result.

1007
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:47,370
You could switch that machine off now.

1008
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:49,460
No, wait, keep going.

1009
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:52,060
Do have a seat, Archbishop.

1010
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:56,140
<i>Movie commentary</i>

1011
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:58,670

01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:01,600

1016
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:14,860
- Papa? - Mmm? - Papa, what’s he saying?

1017
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:18,300
I don’t know, but he seems to be
saying it rather well.

1018
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:46,790
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order
to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.

1019
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:51,600
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.

1020
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,720
Neville Chamberlain will take my place
as Prime Minister.

1021
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:59,330
It’s a matter of principal.
I was mistaken.

1022
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:06,940
I have found it impossible to believe
that there is any man in the World

1023
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:11,890
so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,

1024
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:20,300
but the world might be hurled for a second
time into the abyss of destructive War.

1025
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:27,800
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler’s intention.

1026
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:33,300
I am many very sorry to leave you in
this great time of crisis.

1027
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:42,320
I am very much afraid Sir, that your
greatest test is yet to come.

1028
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:53,480
I am speaking to you from the cabinet
room at 10 Downing Street.

1029
01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:58,990
This morning the British Ambassador
in Berlin

1030
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:03,070
handed the German Government a final note

1031
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:08,900
stating that unless we heard from them
by 11 o’clock

1032
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:14,220
that they were prepared at once to
withdraw their troops from Poland,

1033
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:18,170
a state of war would exist between us.

1034
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:24,780
I have to tell you now that no such
undertaking has been received,

1035
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:31,060
and that consequently this country is
at war with Germany.

1036
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:42,240
At last Sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.

1037
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:49,510
I’ve timed it at just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.

1038
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:52,790
The Prime Minister will be joining you
for the broadcast

1039
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:57,230
which will go out live across the Nation,
the Empire and to our Armed Forces.

1040
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,230
Get Logue here immediately.

1041
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,340
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.

1042
01:35:18,190 --> 01:35:20,480
They got them up there quickly. Yeah.

1043
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:23,140
.

1044
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:28,550
.

1045
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,980
.

1046
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:37,540
- Should we pull over and find shelter?
- No, go straight on. We’ll be alright

1047
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:39,780
.

1048
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,070
- Yes. Sir? - Lionel Logue.

1049
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,040
Major Hartley's expecting me.
This is my son Laury.

1050
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:01,860
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.

1051
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:10,110
- The King’s Speech.
- Thank you, Sir.

1052
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,040
We have about forty minutes until
the broadcast.

1053
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,600
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1054
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:23,940
“There may be dark days ahead, and..."

1055
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:26,360
Try again.

1056
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:34,160
“There may be dark days ahead, and..."

1057
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:39,110
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say
to yourself, “God save the King”.

1058
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:42,660
I say that continuously,
but apparently no one’s listening.

1059
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:46,130
Long pauses are good: they add
solemnity to great occasions.

1060
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:49,030
Then I’m the solemnest king who ever lived.

1061
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:53,460
And Lionel, if I am to be King...
where is my power?

1062
01:36:53,670 --> 01:37:01,530
Can I... Can I form a Government? Can I...
Can I levy a tax or declare a war? No!

1063
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:03,830
Yet I am the seat of all authority. Why?

1064
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:09,530
Because the Nation believes that
when I speak, I speak for them.

1065
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,130
Yet I cannot speak!

1066
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:16,370
Let’s take it all again from the top.
“In this grave hour...”

1067
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:32,040
“In this grave hour fuck fuck fuck

1068
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:35,350
perhaps the most fateful in our history
bugger shit shit

1069
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:39,050
I send to every household of my...

1070
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:44,190
You see "P" is always difficult,
even when I'm singing.

1071
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:47,390
Bounce onto it "a-peoples", not "people".

1072
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:55,090
“a-people household of  me...”
“a-peoples both at home and overseas...”

1073
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,700
Beaut.

1074
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:01,960
...this message, doo-dah, spoken with
the same depth of feeling, doo-dah-dey,

1075
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:05,960
...for each one of you as if I were able
to shit fuck bugger

1076
01:38:06,010 --> 01:38:09,020
cross your threshold and speak to you”

1077
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,910
In your head, now: “I have a right to be
bloody well heard!”

1078
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,660
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard,
bloody well heard myself!

1079
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:19,660
Now Waltz. Move! Get continuous movement.

1080
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:25,400
“For the second time in the lives of most
of us we are at...”

1081
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:29,120
- “we are...” Take a pause.
- Lionel, I can’t do this.

1082
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:31,210
Bertie, you can do it.

1083
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:36,830
-  Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie, it’s time.

1084
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:42,290
<i>There he is.</i>

1085
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,870
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.

1086
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:55,660
A great moment, Sir.

1087
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,340
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.

1088
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:08,720
Nice to see you again, so soon.

1089
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:20,000
Good of you to be here, I’m sure
you’ve had rather a busy day.

1090
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:24,380
Let’s hope we have no more interruptions
from those damned sirens, Sir.

1091
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:26,560
Or the wretched dogs.

1092
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:33,000
- Congratulations. First Lord of
the Admiralty. - Your Majesty.

1093
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:40,030
The long walk.

1094
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:44,320
Good luck, Sir.

1095
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:52,240
I too dread this apparatus. Had a speech
impediment myself, you know.

1096
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:56,760
- I didn’t.
- Family secret. Tongue-tied.

1097
01:39:57,530 --> 01:40:00,190
An operation was considered to be
too dangerous.

1098
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:03,790
I eventually made an asset of it.

1099
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,110
- Thank you, Mr Churchill.
- Good, Sir.

1100
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:11,340
Darling.

1101
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:14,560
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes, Sir.

1102
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:25,430
.

1103
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:32,140
<i>Five seconds, Sir.</i>

1104
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:37,110
<i>5, 4, 3 , 2 , 1.</i>

1105
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:41,830
.

1106
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:43,890
.

1107
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:47,620
- Mr Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.

1108
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:52,310
Mr Wood.

1109
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:55,730
- You'll be decorated, Logue.
- I made it cosy.

1110
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:59,640
Some fresh air.

1111
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:02,480
There you are, Darling.

1112
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,750
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted
thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.

1113
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:15,080
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve
on unsifted thistles, because I'm...

1114
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:18,130
Bertie, darling, make sure it’s not switched on!

1115
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:22,660
Remember the red light will blink four times
and then I’ve asked them to turn it off,

1116
01:41:22,710 --> 01:41:26,810
because we don’t want that evil eye
staring at you all the way through.

1117
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:28,760
One minute, sir.

1118
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:33,500
I am sure you will be splendid.

1119
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,050
Fourty seconds, Sir.

1120
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,720
Logue, however this turns out,

1121
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:59,150
I don’t know how to thank you
for what you’ve done.

1122
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:03,800
Knighthood?

1123
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,020
Twenty seconds.

1124
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:23,480
Forget everything else and just say
it to me. Say it to me, as a friend.

1125
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:09,620
In this grave hour,

1126
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:21,790
perhaps the most fateful in our history,

1127
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:33,450
I send to every household of my peoples,

1128
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,400
both at home

1129
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:44,510
and overseas

1130
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,400
this message

1131
01:43:58,070 --> 01:44:02,010
spoken with the same depth of feeling

1132
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:04,820
for each one of you

1133
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:09,730
as if I were able to cross your threshold

1134
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:14,380
and speak to you myself.

1135
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:22,710
For the second time in the lives of
most of us

1136
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:28,240
we are at... at war.

1137
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:36,710
Over and over again

1138
01:44:38,190 --> 01:44:41,030
we have tried to find

1139
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:51,700
a peaceful way out of the differences
between ourselves

1140
01:44:53,120 --> 01:45:00,750
and those who are now our enemies.

1141
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:05,980
But it has been in vain.

1142
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:11,570
We have been forced into a conflict.

1143
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:17,610
For we are called, to meet the challenge
of a principle

1144
01:45:18,990 --> 01:45:21,250
which, if it were to prevail,

1145
01:45:21,970 --> 01:45:25,570
would be fatal to any civilized order

1146
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,250
in the world.

1147
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:31,440
Such a principle,

1148
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:36,770
stripped of all disguise,

1149
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:40,810
is surely the mere

1150
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:50,700
primitive doctrine that might is right.

1151
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:57,460
For the sake of all that we ourselves
hold dear,

1152
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:08,670
it is unthinkable that we should refuse
to meet the challenge.

1153
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:18,840
It is to this high purpose
that I now call

1154
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:26,670
my people at home and my peoples across
the seas,

1155
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:32,040
who will make our cause their own.

1156
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:38,580
I ask them to stand calm and firm,

1157
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:43,590
and united in this time of trial

1158
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:47,020
the task will be hard.

1159
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:52,010
There may be dark days ahead,

1160
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:59,820
and war can no longer be confined
to the battlefield.

1161
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:05,510
But we can only do the right
as we see the right

1162
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:14,520
and reverently commit our cause to God.

1163
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:24,520
If one and all we keep resolutely
faithful to it,

1164
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:29,720
then, with God’s help,

1165
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:35,330
we shall prevail.

1166
01:47:50,770 --> 01:47:52,270
Very good, Bertie.

1167
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:09,630
You still stammered on the “w”.

1168
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,380
Had to throw in a few so they knew
it was me.

1169
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:22,770
Congratulations, your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.

1170
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:24,370
Thank you, Mr Wood.

1171
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:29,610
Congratulations, your Majesty.

1172
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:33,340
- Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Thank you.

1173
01:48:44,270 --> 01:48:45,770
Ready.

1174
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:48,160
- Good?
- Perfect.

1175
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:54,430
Your first war time speech.
Congratulations.

1176
01:48:55,890 --> 01:48:59,780
Expect I shall have to do
a great deal more.

1177
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,460
Thank you, Logue.

1178
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:18,400
Well done, my friend.

1179
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:24,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1180
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:39,040
I knew you’d be good.

1181
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:51,040
Thank you, Lionel.

1182
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,220
Onwards?

1183
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:58,940
Congratulations, Sir.

1184
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,380
Almost did it better then myself, Sir.

1185
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:05,170
Your Majesty, I’m speechless.

1186
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:07,240
Congratulations, Sir.

1187
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:08,540
Gentlemen.

1188
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:11,010
Congratulations, your Majesty.

1189
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:12,830
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?

1190
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:18,540
Halting at first, but you got much
better Papa.

1191
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:20,210
Bless you.

1192
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:25,030
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.

1193
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,500
Of course I was.

1194
01:50:28,550 --> 01:50:30,050
