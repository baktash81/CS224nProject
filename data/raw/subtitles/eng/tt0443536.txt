1
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,880
<i>Red Riding Hood,
you probably know the story.</i>

2
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,760
<i>But there's more to every tale
than meets the eye.</i>

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,280
<i>It's just like they always say,
you can't judge a book by its cover.</i>

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,320
<i>If you want to know the truth,
you've gotta flip through the pages.</i>

5
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,640
Granny!

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,480
It's me, Red!

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,520
Is everything OK?

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,720
Oh, yeah, sure thing. Oome on in.

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,280
What?

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,320
- Who are you?
- I'm your grandma.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,800
Your face looks really weird, Granny.

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,720
I've been sick. I...

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,640
Your mouth doesn't move when you talk.

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,520
Plastic surgery.
Grandma's had a little work done.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,720
Now, come on over here.
Let's have a look at you.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,000
So, what's going on, Grandma?

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,960
This and that, doing a lot of quilting.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,120
So you got the loot?

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,680
Whoa. What big hands you have.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,040
Oh, all the better
to scratch my back with.

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,520
- And what big ears you have!
- All the better to hear your...

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,680
...many criticisms!

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,960
Old people just have big ears, dear.

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,480
And Granny, what big eyes you have!

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,720
Are we just gonna sit around here
and talk about how big I'm getting?

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,280
You came here for a reason. So tell
old Granny what you got in the basket.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,080
Ah, Granny! What bad breath you have!

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,520
- All right!
- Ah!

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,560
You again? What do I have to do,
get a restraining order?

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,840
Settle down, little girl. I'm on to you.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,960
- Hai-ya!
- Save it, Red Fu.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,160
You been dodging me all day,
but now you might as well give up.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,360
Ahh!

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,040
Ha!

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,360
You crazy wolf!
What have you done with Granny?

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,880
I'm taking Granny down, and you're next!

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,600
- Granny!
- It's you! But you...

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,160
Ohief Grizzly,
are the suspects

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,560
- connected with the Goody Bandit?
- Yeah, uh...

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,360
No. Don't print that, Maxine.
We don't know anything yet.

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,600
Is the house
made of gingerbread?

42
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,720
- Don't think so.
- Do bears eat gingerbread?

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,320
That's enough with the questions.
Jerry, come on! Get these people back!

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,760
All right, back it up!
Let the chief do his job!

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,760
Oome on, you, with the feathers,
back behind the snake.

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,720
I just want to go home and hibernate.

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,920
- Bill!
- Ohief!

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,760
- All right, what do we got?
- It's a domestic disturbance.

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,360
Breaking and entering, wielding an ax
without a license, intent to eat.

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,000
I get it. Any connection
with the recipe robberies?

51
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,640
You mean the Goody Bandit? Oould be.
The house belongs to Granny Puckett.

52
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,160
- The cookbook lady?
- Yeah, that's the one.

53
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,840
Hmm.

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,720
OK, Paul Bunyan was swinging the ax,
and Wolfie was trying to eat Lil' Bit.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,120
- All right, get a muzzle on that guy.
- I can explain everything.

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,800
You can explain it to the judge.

57
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,480
- Shouldn't you be in school?
- Shouldn't I have a lawyer?

58
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,880
Uh... What are you doing?

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,040
- Hey. We was just...
- I was just smelling it.

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,880
- Don't eat that. That's evidence.
- Right.

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,680
All right, so this looks
pretty open-and-shut.

62
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,560
Little Miss Rosy Oakes making covert
deliveries to the goody tycoon,

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,280
Wolfie tries to eat 'em both,

64
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,480
then Orazy Flannel Pants with the ax
here busts in swinging vigilante-style.

65
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,120
Take 'em downtown, boys.

66
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,480
It's the woods, chief.
We don't have a downtown.

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,360
You know what I mean.
Just book 'em!

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Not so fast, Grizzly.

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,320
That's the problem with you bears,
always growling up the wrong tree.

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,320
- Hey, Nicky!
- You on the case, Nick?

71
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,680
No, just stopping by
to have a sarsaparilla.

72
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,000
Say, Tommy, you lose some weight?

73
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,400
- Uh, no.
- Didn't think so.

74
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
Nicky Flippers. What are you
doing here? This is my case.

75
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,840
Well, someone hibernated
on the wrong side of the cave.

76
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,160
I saw the lights,
thought the circus was in town.

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,720
Now, of course, I see I was right.

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,400
You're too late, Nicky.
I got this case all wrapped up.

79
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,320
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,680
They got us all wrong,
Mr. Flippers.

81
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,360
Oh, I don't know,
you look pretty dangerous to me.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,960
- What's your name?
- Red.

83
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,120
- And why do they call you that?
- Why do they call you "Flippers"?

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,560
<i>Go Flippers</i>

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,080
- Jump! Get on!
- "Go Flippers"

86
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,960
<i>Go Flippers
Go Flippers</i>

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,880
Uh, no reason.

88
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,440
They call me Red
because of this red hood I wear.

89
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,960
- What about when you're not wearing it?
- I usually wear it.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
Recipes have come up missing
all over the forest.

91
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,960
Goody shops have been
going out of business for months,

92
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,360
and the trail ends here.
I got a case to close.

93
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,760
Slow down, chief. We've got four
suspects, and that means four stories,

94
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,120
and if you get people talking long
enough, someone will spill the beans.

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,760
- Beans?
- Oould I just make a quick phone call?

96
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,120
Aaah!

97
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,880
I'll tell you what happened.

98
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,400
What's with the handcuffs on a girl?
Her wrists could slip right out.

99
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,920
- How about a cage?
- Bring in the cage!

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,400
- I was being sarcastic.
- Sarcasm. Strike the cage.

101
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,640
All right,
get the cuffs off her.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,720
So, Red, why don't you explain
how this all began?

103
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,320
Well, like any other day.

104
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
<i>I was making deliveries
for my Granny's goody shop.</i>

105
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,480
# Ba ba ba-da-ba-da

106
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,720

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,680

# You'll like

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,880
# It's the one about the girl

112
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,480
- # I know
- Hi, Red!

113
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,000
# It's a tired old tale
but it still rings true

114
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,480
- Hey, Red.
- # She could never be rude

115
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,680
- # Or unkind
- Hey!

116
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,600
# But a sad song played
at the back of her mind

117
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,760
# Oh

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,920
# Oan someone show me a different day

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,800
# To take me away

120
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,880
# Take me out of the woods

121
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,360
# Great big world

122
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,640
# You know what I'm wanting for you

123
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,440
# You know what I'm wanting for you

124
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,960
# What I'm wanting for you

125
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,400
# Wanting for you

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,360
Ahh!

127
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,200
# Oh ##

128
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,000
Hey, Red!

129
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,800
Oh! Nice outfit. Always red with you.

130
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
- You must be in autumn.
- Hey, Boingo.

131
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,080
Aren't you helping the Muffin Man today?

132
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,440
Oh, he closed up shop.
Someone took all his recipes last night,

133
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,840
and now I'm out of a job.

134
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,240
Gee, Boingo, I'm really sorry.
Are you still running the cable car?

135
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,880
Yeah, yeah, I am.

136
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,120
But it's nothing like
making goodies all day.

137
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,280
Would a carrot crumpet
make you feel better?

138
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,880
Oh, boy, oh, boy! Thanks, Red.
I can always count on you to deliver,

139
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,080
you little rascally devil.

140
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,840
Yeah, well, the woods
don't go around by themselves.

141
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,800
Shut it down.

142
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,720
- Oome on, let's go.
- Where are we going now, Mama?

143
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,720
<i>With the Goody Bandit
on the loose,</i>

144
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,520
<i>recipes were becoming
an endangered species.</i>

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,160
<i>I decided to call Granny.</i>

146
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,920
<i>If anyone would know what to do,
she would.</i>

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,880
I don't know what to do.
I'm just a tired old lady.

148
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,080
Your recipes are the most famous
in the whole forest, Granny.

149
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,760
What if they get swiped?
It could wipe you out.

150
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,720
Maybe I should bring you
the recipe book, for safekeeping.

151
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,560
A trip up the mountain
is too dangerous for a little girl.

152
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,360
I'm not so little anymore.

153
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,360
Please, dear, you just keep the recipes
there, and everything will be fine.

154
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
- But...
- I have to go now. My program's on.

155
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Kisses.

156
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,000
What you reading, Red?

157
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,320
"Far Away Places"?

158
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,720
- Are you going somewhere far away?
- No. The world is too dangerous.

159
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,400
Oan't see! Danger! Turn into the skid!

160
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,680
I'm OK. I'll walk it off.

161
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,480
You can't go away.
Who's gonna ride the Goody Bike?

162
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,400
If I had wings like you,
I'd fly all the way past that mountain,

163
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,320
and the next one and the next one...

164
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,640
But I can't. I'm just a kid.

165
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,320
I'm just a woodpecker.

166
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,680
Uh-oh.

167
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,120
"You're next"?

168
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,040
What... what does it mean,
"you're next"?

169
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,880
Ruined.

170
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,320
It means someone wants our recipes.

171
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,760
Are they gonna get your recipes?

172
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
Not today.

173
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,400
So you deliberately
took your Granny's recipes

174
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,560
from the family vault,
without permission.

175
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
- Help yourself.
- And then,

176
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,000
you set out on a dangerous journey
up the mountain...

177
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,960
- ... alone?
- Yeah. I guess I did.

178
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,400
# "Critters have feelings"

179
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,440
# "Well, critters have feelings"

180
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,760
# "Critters have feelings"

181
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,040
# "Well, critters have feelings too"

182
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,440
<i># "Critters have feelings"
Critters have feelings</i>

183
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,360
I guess running the cable car's
not so bad, you know.

184
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,880
It's a great way to see the forest
without worrying about all those big,

185
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,280
mean, hairy beasts out there.

186
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,480
- Beasts?
- Oh, yeah, you know, beasts.

187
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,960
The wolves and the bobcats
and the mountain lions

188
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,400
and the saber-tooth tigers!
But mostly wolves.

189
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,600
Mostly wolves.

190
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,240
The forest can be a dangerous place for
a little guy like me, with my cute...

191
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
Look at me, I'm fuzzy...
You deliver up this far?

192
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,440
Well, not usually.

193
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,400
But I was thinking
about what you told me earlier.

194
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,200
About the Muffin Man?

195
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,440
I need to protect Granny's recipes
from that Bandit's evil plan.

196
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,800
They're gonna shut down everyone
in the forest if we're not careful.

197
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,680
Aaah! Aah! Aah!

198
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,600
- No!
- Aaah!

199
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
Ohh!

200
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,800
Aah! Whoa! Ohh!

201
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,480
Aaah!

202
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,360
'Afternoon.

203
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,520
Hello.

204
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,920
So you're the little girl
in the red hood.

205
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,320
That was quite a bit of falling
you did just now.

206
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,560
- You saw that.
- Yeah, gravity's working.

207
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,120
Those old cable cars on the...
You should write a letter.

208
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,120
Wow! Something smells good.
Those, uh... goodies in there?

209
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

210
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,640
No, you shouldn't. Good call.

211
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,760
What are you doing
in the big, bad forest?

212
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,680
You taking the goodies
to someone in particular?

213
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,800
- Um... my granny.
- Granny?

214
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,520
Granny Puckett? The goody lady?

215
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,640
My goodness,
she makes some good... goodies.

216
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,200
She's got a thing, it's like a...
It's like a... cookies.

217
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,400
Shortbread,
chocolate icing between, very...

218
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,720
It's good. Ah, it's very good.

219
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,040
You make deliveries
to your granny often?

220
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,760
I don't think I should tell you that.

221
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,760
Oh, you don't have
anything else in that?

222
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
You ask a lot of questions, mister.

223
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,960
Well, I'm a curious guy.
Let me have a look.

224
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,320
I'd rather you didn't.

225
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Red! Red Riding Hood!

226
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,400
Hand over the basket.

227
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,040
Aaah!

228
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,040
Red!

229
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,800
You can't hold
onto those recipes forever!

230
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,520
I'll get you,
and your little Granny too!

231
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,160
<i>Well, that settles it.</i>

232
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,760
- We got our Bandit.
- Oould be.

233
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,240
I'd like to count my chickens
after they hatch.

234
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,480
Ohickens?

235
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,440
You've gotta admit, a wolf stopping
kids in the middle of the forest...

236
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,120
- That's pretty creepy.
- Right. Yes, yes.

237
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
But we don't arrest people
for being creepy.

238
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,800
Yeah, Bruce. You know that guy
we got in the tank?

239
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,960
- "The creepy one?"
- Yeah. Better let him go.

240
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,640
So you went on to Granny's?

241
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,600
I found an old trail
up the north side of the mountain.

242
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,640
Hello!

243
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,560
Hello.

244
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,880
I'm looking for Granny Puckett's house.

245
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,760
# Granny Puckett

246
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,440
- Oould you stop singing for one moment?
- # No, I can't, I wish I could

247
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,240
# But a mountain witch done
put a spell on me 37 years ago

248
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,240
# And now I gotta sing
everything I say

249
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,240
- Everything?
- That's right.

250
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,120
You just talked! Just now!

251
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,520
Did I?

252
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,880
# Did I?

253
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,560
# Did I, did I, did I
doo-dah, doo-dah did-i-doo

254
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,840
- Granny?
- What's that? Who's there?

255
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,000
It's Red. I'm on my way
to come see...

256
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,760
Oh, my dearie, I'm not prepared.

257
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,000
I need to put down fresh doilies! Aah!

258
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,120
- Granny! Granny, what's wrong?
- Gotta go, munchkin.

259
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,120
Bonsai!

260
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Oh, no.

261
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,760
Mr. Goat, my granny's in trouble.

262
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,560
I've gotta find a way
around the mountain, fast.

263
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,880
# Well, you came to the right goat

264
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, good. More singing.

265
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,240
# Thirty-seven years ago
a witch done put a spell on me

266
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,360
Yeah. I know.

267
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,400
# A spell where when I'm talking
I'm singing it with glee

268
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,320
# But when you're always singing
you've got to live alone

269
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,360
# That's why I made
this mountain shack my home

270
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,400
That's great...

271
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,960
# When you're on the mountain
there's lots to be a-feared

272
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,680
# That's why this here
old mountain goat's prepared

273
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,680
# Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

274
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,160
These tunnels, I need one
that leads to Puckett Grove.

275
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,440
Ohh.

276
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,240
# But I got horns that open bottles
and I got horns that hold my keys

277
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,400
# I got horns that
when you turn 'em right

278
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,280
# They help me watch TV

279
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,400
# I got horns that open pickle jars
and horns that come with hair

280
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,680
# I got horns that hang my other horns

281
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,320
# I always come prepared

282
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,080
- Oan you help me find...?
- # To be prepared, to be prepared

283
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,760
# This lesson must be shared
This lesson must be shared

284
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,760
# To be prepared

285
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,200
# To be prepared, to be prepared

286
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,320
# And unless you've got a spare

287
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,000
# You've got one life
so handle it with care

288
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,200
- Aaah!
- Yipee!

289
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,400
Keep your hands and feet
inside of the vehicle at all times!

290
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,120
Whoo-wee!

291
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,560
# An avalanche is coming
and I do not feel prepared

292
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,560
# It's rumbling like a mountain lion
I must say that I'm scared

293
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,520
# And if not for the witch's spell
you'd hearjust how I scream

294
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,520
# But since I'm only singing
I'll just yodel till we're creamed

295
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,880
Aaah! Aaah!

296
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,080
Aaah!

297
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,800
Red!

298
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Granny?

299
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,280
Use the hood, Red!

300
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,440
Use the hood!

301
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,320
What?

302
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,720
# I was prepared!

303
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,880
Granny! It's me, Red. Is everything OK?

304
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

305
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,360
So this wolf, he was dressed
as your grandmother?

306
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,680
- Yes.
- I'm your grandma.

307
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,280
- And you bought that?
- No, not really.

308
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,560
Whoa. What big hands you have.

309
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
And what big ears you have.

310
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,960
What bad breath you have!
What big eyes you have.

311
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,280
Are we just gonna sit around here
and talk about how big I'm getting?

312
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,120
Then the fellow with the ax burst in?

313
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,680
- Aaah!
- Whoa! Whoa!

314
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,960
No, no, not yet.

315
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
First I was attacked
by that crazy wolf!

316
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,400
Hai-ya! You crazy wolf!

317
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,320
<i>My granny jumped
out of a closet.</i>

318
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,560
<i>- Aaah!
- But she was tied up...</i>

319
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,680
And then the axman cometh?

320
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,800
You got it.

321
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,520
Only he was screaming.

322
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,640
Arghh?

323
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,040
Like a maniac.

324
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
- Wow.
- Hmm.

325
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,840
- So that was it?
- That wolf was gonna eat us all.

326
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,440
The guy's pawprints
are all over the room. Book him!

327
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,040
Hold the phone, fuzzy-wuzzy.
Let's hear it from the wolf's mouth.

328
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,520
- Don't I get a drink?
- No!

329
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,440
So, Mr. Wolf, may I call you "Wolf"?

330
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,400
You can call me Sheila.
I like long walks and fresh flowers.

331
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,840
Quit playing around, Wolf!

332
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,120
You're looking at three-to-five
in an old shoe with no windows!

333
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,840
So start singing!

334
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,320
- Your face looks familiar.
- I get around the forest.

335
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,040
What do you for a living, Mr. Wolf?

336
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,480
I'm a shepherd. Hey!

337
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,000
You might as well confess.
I told them everything!

338
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,200
Oould you keep her
away from me, please?

339
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,920
I remember you.

340
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,040
Three years ago on the Stiltskin case.

341
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,680
You were snooping around
for a lead on his real name.

342
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,880
I was close too.

343
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,680
I was gonna go with "Greg. "
Greg Stiltskin.

344
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,520
Wait a minute, Flippers!
You saying this guy's a cop?

345
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,800
Worse. He's a reporter.

346
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,080
- A what?
- And I've got the real story.

347
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,520
<i>I'm an investigativejournalist.</i>

348
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,080
<i>You've probably read my column
Facts and Fairy Tales.</i>

349
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,440
<i>I spent the last six months undercover</i>

350
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,200
<i>investigating
the so-called "Goody Bandit. "</i>

351
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,960
<i>As more recipes go missing,
the trail has gotten hotter.</i>

352
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,400
Huh?

353
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,200
And I'm talking hot coffee, hot coffee,

354
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,080
all over my neck. Very, very painful.

355
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,480
People think a health board examiner
doesn't lead a dangerous life,

356
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,240
but I will tell you, my furry friend,
food is dangerous.

357
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,720
That's why Kenny told me
to come and take a look.

358
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,120
- Who?
- Your boss, Kenny.

359
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,320
- You mean Earl?
- That's what Earl said.

360
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,000
He said, uh, "Kenny, come down here,"
and so, here I am.

361
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,640
I'm surprised your dessert counter
hasn't been hit,

362
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,480
with all the thievery going around.

363
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,480
- What did you say your name was?
- Shaw. Rick Shaw. I'm in from Japan.

364
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,200
Well, Kenny, I'm gonna
give you a clean bill of health.

365
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,600
But I'm gonna need the names
of all your suppliers.

366
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,080
You'll have to talk to Earl.

367
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,360
Well, that's Earl right now.
Probably called the FDA.

368
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,880
You keep that thing groomed.
And watch out for hot coffee. Painful.

369
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,760
No desserts. Waste of time.

370
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,080
<i>The little delivery girl
in the red hood.</i>

371
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,080
<i>Always on the go.</i>

372
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,280
<i>More goodies pass through her hands
than anyone's in the whole forest.</i>

373
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,480
<i>She seemed happy...</i>

374
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,680
<i>...a little too happy, perhaps.</i>

375
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,920
Oh! Oreepy.

376
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,360
<i>I was starting to have my suspicions.</i>

377
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,800
Question:
Who does she move the goodies for?

378
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,960
Where do they come from?
Where are they going?

379
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,160
And why the hood?

380
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,200
Aaah!

381
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,280
- Twitchy, you scared me.
- Hey, boss, I beeped you. Get my beep?

382
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,240
- Oalm down.
- I got up early. Got the gear.

383
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,360
I was watching the girl
like you told me to.

384
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,080
- Yeah. Did you see where she went?
- Past porcupines and the bird's tree,

385
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,400
guy with the beard, now she's
up the creek! She sings everywhere!

386
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,400
I'm way ahead of you.
We gotta find out who she's working for.

387
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,600
- You got the camera?
- The 220x and photograb with autofocus!

388
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,720
- Oolor or black and white?
- Doesn't matter.

389
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,000
- I brought a flash!
- Put that away!

390
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,360
- It's covert. No flash.
- Undercover, got it.

391
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,920
Nobody sees, nobody knows.
Olick-click. Hee-hee.

392
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,000
You ever thought
about decaffeinated coffee?

393
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,560
I don't drink coffee!

394
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,680
Hmm...

395
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,240
Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon.

396
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,880
<i>I decided to get the word on the
street from one of my top informants.</i>

397
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,840
- How's it going, Woolworth?
- Man, what are you doing here?

398
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,400
The shepherd comes by and sees me
talking to you, I'm gonna get the crook.

399
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,680
Yeah? There's a bigger crook
on the loose that I'm concerned about.

400
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,760
- What ya hear about the Goody Bandit?
- What do I know?

401
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,720
Hiya, Twitchy.

402
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,080
- The little girl in the red hood.
- Don't know, never heard of her.

403
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,440
Little Red? Processing...

404
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,560
Yeah, yeah, it's coming back to me now.
Sweet gal. Not like that Bo Peep.

405
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,680
Brat put in an invisible fence.
I tasted my own fillings for a week!

406
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,120
Focus! The girl in the hood.

407
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,680
You get around the mountain.
Who does she work for?

408
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,800
How should I know?
I ain't that curious.

409
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,760
Family business. Ain't you
ever heard of Granny Puckett?

410
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,080
- Puckett?
- Her grandma.

411
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,320
The Granny Puckett?
You pulling the wool over my eyes?

412
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,240
Ha-ha. Hilarious. Oome up
with that yourself? That's funny.

413
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,440
- You're looking pretty tasty.
- Why you gotta be like that?

414
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,200
All I know is that the old lady
lives up high in the hills.

415
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,640
- Not a lot of visitors.
- Except the little girl.

416
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,440
She's been known to take
the cable car up the mountain.

417
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,440
Oable car?

418
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,160
Those sheep made me hungry.
After this, we're grabbing a bite.

419
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,880
Sounds good. Sounds good.

420
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,240
<i>Baa.</i>

421
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,600
<i>I don't know what to do.
Should I call her?</i>

422
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,920
<i>- Am I supposed to play it cool?
- Keeping her options open.</i>

423
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,600
<i>Seeing other people.
You should do the same.</i>

424
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,960
<i>Shh. Up there.</i>

425
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,440
Do you mind?

426
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,560
Ooh. Sorry.

427
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,960
<i>Hey, you deliver up this far?</i>

428
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,600
<i>The Muffin Man...
Granny's recipes...</i>

429
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,840
<i>...an evil plan.</i>

430
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,640
<i>...shut down everyone in the forest...</i>

431
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:02,880
I knew it.

432
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,280
She's working for the old lady. Twitchy.

433
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,080
Aaah!

434
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,960
Aaah!

435
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,320
Ooh! Uhh!

436
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,920
Uhh! Ooh! Ugh!

437
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,880
Ouch!

438
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,720
Ohh!

439
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,680
Ahh!

440
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,160
Ohh!

441
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,520
'Afternoon.

442
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,800
Hello.

443
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,760
So you're the little girl
in the red hood.

444
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,960
That's quite a bit of falling
you did just now.

445
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,040
Gravity's working.

446
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,080
What are you doing
in the big, bad forest?

447
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,080
You taking goodies
to someone in particular?

448
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,400
Um... Granny.

449
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,000
You don't have anything else
in that basket?

450
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,480
- You ask a lot of questions, mister.
- Well, I'm a curious guy.

451
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,560
- Let me have a look.
- I'd rather you didn't.

452
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,080
I mean, "please. " Oome back here!

453
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,440
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I was winding.

454
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,000
Oome on! We're gonna lose her!
Red! Red Riding Hood!

455
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,680
We'll never catch her.

456
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,640
Taxi!

457
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,800
Whoa! That was her.
We passed her. Right here's fine.

458
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,320
Suspect is approaching on foot,
stolen recipes in basket.

459
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm about to catch her red-handed.

460
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,040
Hand over the basket!

461
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,560
- Aaah!
- Hyahh!

462
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,240
So you really took a beating...

463
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,360
- ... from a little girl?
- Hey!

464
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,160
- Hai-yah!
- Ooh!

465
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,080
Get back here, you little brat!

466
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,760
<i># "One, two, buckle to you"
Ready or not, here I come</i>

467
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,160
# "Don't you run away"

468
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,760
<i># "A-B-C, I can read"
And the sign up ahead said</i>

469
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,800
<i># "Son, you're the 1-2-3-4"
Knock on the door</i>

470
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,440
# "Open up, gotta run away" ##

471
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,320
OK. Not cool. Ahhh!

472
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,040
You can't hold
onto those recipes forever!

473
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,760
I'll get you,
and your little Granny too!

474
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,520
Well, that's fishy.

475
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,480
What? They're evil. I'll prove it!

476
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,800
- So can we eat?
- Sure. You hungry for failure?

477
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,960
Maybe a side of unemployment?
'Oause that's what's for lunch.

478
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
- What do we do?
- We go right to the source.

479
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,000
We gotta get to Granny's before the kid.

480
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,520
- Is it a surprise?
- Excuse me?

481
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,960
You're going over to Granny's house
to surprise Red. Is it her birthday,

482
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,360
or what is it? Is there a shindig?
'Oause I'm great at parties.

483
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,360
- Watch me pull myself out of a hat!
- Yeah.

484
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,800
Big surprise party.
You know how to get there?

485
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
In fact, I know a shortcut.

486
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,760
You hear that? He knows a shortcut.

487
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,880
Over the woods and through the river...

488
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,920
No, you don't want to go
through the river, you'll get all wet.

489
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You see, Twitchy, you get lemons,
you make lemonade.

490
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,200
And then that lemonade goes bitter
and ferments and turns to pig swill.

491
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,720
Never trust a bunny
with directions, Twitchy.

492
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,600
Sure thing, boss. Never trust a bunny!

493
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,000
The bright side is,
at least I finally dried off.

494
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,480
Ohh!

495
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,240
Why couldn't I write movie reviews?

496
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,240
We are in a pickle, and I blame myself.

497
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,240
That bunny was worthless, not to mention
he wrote directions on an Easter egg,

498
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,480
- which is hard to read.
- We're gonna die here!

499
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,000
Hey, now, that's what they said
at The Alamo.

500
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Wha... what was that? Who's that?

501
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,360
Aaah!

502
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,800
Uhh!

503
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,320
Hey, look where we are. More cave.

504
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,680
- Hey, whazzi-lookie!
- With God as my witness,

505
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,240
you will learn to speak.
Look! A way out.

506
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,720
But I was just... Ahh!

507
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,560
Follow me.

508
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,320
Hmm...

509
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,440
- Huh?
- Oome on.

510
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,920
# "Train"

511
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,920
# "Train"

512
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,840
# "Living like a bandit" #

513
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,240
Now, this is a shortcut.

514
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,160
Whazzat? Sounds like an avalanche!

515
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,040
Well, Twitchy, that's natural.

516
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,440
It's just Old Man Mountain
showing us who's boss.

517
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,640
Hey, lookie!
A box of candles! A big box!

518
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,760
Box of candles? Light 'em up!

519
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,640
Wow, that's nice and bright.
What kind of candles are those?

520
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,320
- Deen-a-meet-tay. Must be Italian.
- Ah! Lose the candle!

521
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,880
- But I...
- Ahhh!

522
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,040
Got it.

523
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,720
Ahhh!

524
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,760
Aaahhh!

525
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,600
- Did you hear something?
- Hm?

526
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,480
Hm. Oome on, let's get to Granny's.

527
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,440
Hello! Paper boy.

528
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,480
Publisher's, uh...

529
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,800
Oandygram.

530
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,920
What do we do, boss?

531
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,160
Ohh!

532
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,800
<i>Lucky for me, Granny keeps
her merchandise around the cottage.</i>

533
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,320
<i>Disguise was the only way
to catch this girl</i>

534
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,880
<i>in the act of smuggling.</i>

535
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,560
Sweetie-pie! Sugar plum!

536
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,880
Hug your granny, little pudding pop.

537
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,560
Aww!

538
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,480
Boy, that's hot. OK, change of plans.

539
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,400
You can be Granny.

540
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,640
She's coming!

541
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,240
- Wa-dee-dee!
- Ohh!

542
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,440
Granny! It's me, Red.

543
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,600
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, sure thing. Oome on in.

544
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,000
<i>Pretty thin, Wolf.</i>

545
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,480
You said the old lady
was already tied up.

546
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,520
- How did that happen?
- I don't know,

547
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,440
maybe to make herself look innocent.

548
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,760
I just write the news, chief,
I don't make it.

549
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,520
For a reporter, you have
a strange way of doing yourjob.

550
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,080
What can I say?
I was raised by wolves.

551
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,760
- Got a way to back this up?
- I got these pictures developed.

552
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,800
That so? Let's have a look.

553
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,320
These are good.

554
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,560
- Here's a nice one of you, Wolf.
- Ugh!

555
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,960
I wanna do a gallery show.
A coffee table book.

556
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,040
I don't drink coffee.
A Ohai tea latte book.

557
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,960
Photos don't lie, chief.

558
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,720
- Good work, Twitchy.
- Arghh.

559
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,320
Now, I want to know more
about this fellow with the ax.

560
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,720
How does he fit into all of this?

561
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,920
Maybe you should
"ax" him yourself.

562
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,440
You see? "Ax" him? He was saying...

563
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,600
I'll bring him in.

564
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,560
Ohh!

565
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,440
Hmm. Hello.

566
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,440
My, my. You're a big fellow, aren't you?

567
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,440
- Shop at the Big and Tall store?
- This is a big and tall mistake.

568
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,400
I would not hurt a butterfly.

569
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,280
Then what's this? A letter opener?

570
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,160
That's a funny accent
you got there, choppy.

571
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,840
I can do the cowboy accent.
Howdy, partner!

572
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,520
Indeed you can.

573
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,080
Say, before you ride off
into the sunset, hopalong,

574
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,200
you think you could
rustle up information?

575
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,680
I will do my best.

576
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,520
How about explaining what
you were doing in the forest?

577
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,680
Oh! I am working
to make good my call-back!

578
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,000
Your what-what?

579
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,920
Paul's Bunion Oream
has a soothing formula

580
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,400
to make the bunions
head for the hills!

581
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,480
- This guy's a loon.
- Watch it, chief. My mama's half-loon.

582
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,960
Your call-back.
You mean, like, for an audition?

583
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,800
Yes! For the bunion cream.

584
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,720
I must find my wood-cutting self
to book the spot.

585
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,240
- The what?
- The commercial.

586
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,400
- He's an actor.
- Oh, boy.

587
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,880
Arghh!

588
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,760
Paul's Bunion Oream
has the soothing formula...

589
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
No, hold it! Hold it!

590
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,240
- Stop. "Arghh"?
- Uh-huh.

591
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,160
What are you, some kind
of German pirate or something?

592
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,160
I just got the script,
like, five minutes ago.

593
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,040
- You're not getting it.
- I'm trying.

594
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,760
- My name Kirk.
- Kirk. OK, Kirk.

595
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,360
What makes you feel proud
and strong and mighty?

596
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,480
What puts a fire
in your belly, Steven?

597
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,520
- Oh! My dream!
- Yes, yes! Your dream!

598
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,160
To travel the world

599
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,240
with the greatest singing group
of all time...

600
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,720
...the Happy Yodelers!

601
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,320
# To yodel for the people

602
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,000
# To hear the applause

603
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,600
# My dream #

604
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,640
Sorry.

605
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,080
Listen. We'll look at your tape
and we'll give you a call, OK?

606
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,520
Thanks for coming in.
Have a nice life. Next!

607
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,560
<i>That was
my first audition in months.</i>

608
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,720
<i>Then it was back to my day job.</i>

609
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,760
<i>I drive a schnitzel truck.</i>

610
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,280
<i>It's not such a bad job.</i>

611
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,560
<i>After all, I bring much joy
to the childrenl</i>

612
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,200
# Schnitzel!

613
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Mommy, Mommy!
I want a schnitzel stick!

614
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,640
Ooh, the schnitzel man!

615
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,480
# Schnitzel, the favorite treat
For little girls and boys to eat

616
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,360
# Schnitzel man can serve them quick

617
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,480
# It's a schnitzel on a stick

618
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,280
# No more spoons
Use your hands

619
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,760
# Says
the friendly schnitzel man

620
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
# Make sure you keep an extra one

621
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,920
# For later in your lederhosen

622
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,880
- Schnitzel!
- Ow!

623
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,680
# Schnitz...

624
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,320
What the schnitzel?

625
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,080
My schnitzel truck,
it's been piddly... piddle-llaged...

626
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,360
They stole everything!

627
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,040
Oh, that's too bad.

628
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,240
It's not easy being in the
goody business these days, huh?

629
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,680
I'm getting schnitzeled
left and right today.

630
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,480
I cannot even sell the bunion cream.

631
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,440
- Now I'm gonna lose my job!
- Ohin up, mister.

632
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,680
Maybe someday somebody
will open up a great big goody shop

633
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,120
and we can all work
for that little guy.

634
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,240
<i>Oh, yeah... What?</i>

635
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,565
Uhh...

636
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,680
- Hello?
- Kirk! Yeah, baby, listen.

637
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,000
We got the client here,
we looked at your tape,

638
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,080
and we think we might have a real
"Hercules goes bananas" angle on this.

639
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,200
- So we want you to come back in.
- Oome back in?

640
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,840
It's a call-back.

641
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,000
<i>I had always heard
about call-backs,</i>

642
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,680
<i>but I had never gotten onel</i>

643
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,200
A call-back?

644
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,800
Ahh! What do I do?

645
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,320
You come back tomorrow,
do the same you did today,

646
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,880
only this time you do it good.
Oan you handle that?

647
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,120
- I will. I can do it!
- OK.

648
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,520
Now, I want you
to go out into the wild

649
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,000
and I want you to find that
tree-chopping side of yourself.

650
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,880
You find your inner woodsman, Ourtis.

651
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,240
Don't act like a woodsman,
be a woodsman. Got it?

652
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,680
Yes, I can!

653
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,760
Find an ax, start swinging, OK?

654
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,240
I've gotta be in a circle wipe
across town, but I'll see you at 10:00.

655
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,680
I have to go
and find the little woodsman...

656
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,920
...in me!

657
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,400
OK. Well, tell him I said hello.

658
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,560
Ay! Ay-ay-ay-ay!

659
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,960
Ooh!

660
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,240
Ha-ha!

661
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,560
Goodbye!

662
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,880
Hup, hup!

663
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,440
Sorry, little birds!

664
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,320
Run!

665
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,600
<i>I had done itl</i>

666
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,360
<i>I had found
the little woodsman inside of mel</i>

667
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,800
Yes.

668
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,840
Paul's... Bunion...

669
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,560
...Oream...

670
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,040
...has the soothing formula...

671
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,680
...to make your bunions...

672
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,920
...head for the hills!

673
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,560
Right!

674
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,120
...bunion...

675
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,520
...cream...

676
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,240

677
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,720
...formula...

678
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,680
Hello?

679
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,320
Ohh...

680
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,680
Oh, schnitzel!

681
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,320
Aah! Aah!

682
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,160
Ohh! Ohh!

683
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,040
Aahhh!

684
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,840
I'm taking Granny down,
and you're next!

685
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,280
Aahhh!

686
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,760
So you didn'tjump through
the window, you were pushed?

687
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,880
- Yes.
- By a tree.

688
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,880
Yes.

689
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,520
Because you were pretending
to be a woodsman.

690
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,520
- That's right!
- To sell foot cream.

691
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,840
I got the call-back!

692
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,840
And good for you.

693
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,680
Well, I think it's safe to say
that our thespian friend here

694
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,240
knows the least about anything
of anyone in this room.

695
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,440
Exactly! What does that mean?

696
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,200
That it all points to Granny.

697
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,160
What about it, Granny?

698
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,520
Maybe you're not the sweet goody-maker
everyone thinks you are.

699
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,880
Are you stealing recipes
to protect your sugar-coated kingdom?

700
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,440
Oh, no, Mr. Flippers.

701
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,280
The only crime I've ever committed

702
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,040
is making my goodies
unlawfully delicious!

703
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,200
My granny doesn't keep secrets.

704
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,320
And even if she did,
she'd tell me about it.

705
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,960
We tell each other everything.
Right, Granny?

706
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,680
Sure, dear. Mostly.

707
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,240
- Mostly?
- What are you hiding, old girl?

708
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,360
My family worries too much.
I didn't want them to find out.

709
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,720
- Find out what?
- Yeah. What?

710
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,840
Hey, chief!

711
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,400
Oheck this out!

712
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,240
When did they make that a sport?

713
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,280
I noticed you have three G's
tattooed on the back of your neck.

714
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,480
That's appropriate, since there
are three strikes against you.

715
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,600
It's true.

716
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,720
I'm not like other grannies.

717
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,120
I never did like the quilting bees
and the bingo parlors.

718
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,480
I'd rather live life to the extreme.

719

732
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,200
A trip up the mountain
is too dangerous for a little girl.

733
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm not so little anymore.

734
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,960
Please, dear, you just keep the recipes
there, and everything will be fine.

735
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,480
- But...
- I have to go now. My program's on.

736
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,080
Kisses.

737
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,680
Time to shred some powder!

738

for Red to visit today.</i>

739
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,520

740
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,040
<i>I've been training
three months for this one.</i>

741
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,280

742
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,920

# I'm a tree critter

747
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,200
- Triple G, what's up, baby?
- Granny, what's happening?

748
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,040
What up, my homeys?
You ready to get spanked?

749
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,800
So, what's the dizzo, grizzo?
You ready to floss that hill, playa?

750
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,840
- Fo' shizzle!
- Yeah, gimme some love.

751
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,600
G, you checking the hardcore
European team over there?

752
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,960
Those guys put the Saber-Tooth Brothers
in the hospital yesterday!

753
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,440
On the real, it's gonna be
wicked out there!

754
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,080
You let me worry
about those player-haters.

755
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,200
Oh, I almost forgot.
I made you kids some snicker-doodles.

756
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,720
- Yo!
- Tight!

757
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,080
Yeah, snicker-doodles!
Give it up! Give it up!

758
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,320
Snickadeedoo!

759

# You can take the critter

760
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,680
# But you can't take the tree
out of the tree critter's needs

761
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,840
# Now this critter's gotta run
with the birds and the bees

762
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,760
Well, what's your name?

763
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,080
Just put, "To my biggest
and cutest fan, Boingo. "

764
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,320
And then, like, put some X's and O's
and a little smiley-face.

765
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,760
<i>All contestants

766
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,480
Oh, yeah.

767
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,320
Be careful,
Granny Puckett.

768
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,520
Old ladies get hurt on these slopes.

769
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,560
Bring it, honey.

770
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,400
Aahhh!

771
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,560
Yo, Granny!

772
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,605
I know you did notjust
swing your pole at me!

773
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,560
- You're little! You're small!
- Yeah? Well, take that, yo!

774
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,200
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

775
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,560
- Yeah.
- Watch that skier!

776
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,160
- Whoa! Look out!
- So it's like that?

777
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,520
You wanna play now? Get some of this!

778
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,480
Whoa! Whoa!

782
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,240
- " Granny?"
- What's that? Who's there?

783
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,680
- Take that, from Mr. Big Muscleman!
- Want some of this?

784
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,960
Ha-ha!

785
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,840
Gotta go, munchkin! Bonsai!

786
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,440

Ohh! Aww!

789
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,080
Oh, you're not so bad!

790
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,600
- Who do you work for?
- I can't tell you that.

791
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,960
- Young man, you tell me this instant!
- All right!

792
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,400
We were hired by the Bandit!

793
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,320
Who is the Bandit?

794
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,440
Ha!

795
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,440
Granny is finished.

796
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,800

847
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,200
<i>I could've handled
that wolf myself.</i>

848
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,320
<i>But then the craziest thing happened.</i>

849
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,840
Honey, don't look
at your granny like that.

850
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,160
I'm sorry, I thought you were Triple G.

851
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,600
Or are you the Bandit?

852
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,320
Awkward!

853
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,800
- You're being ridiculous, Red.
- I'm being ridiculous?

854
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,360
You're off living"... la vida loca,"

855
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,400
risking your life for some dumb thrills,

856
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,840
and I'm supposed to stay home
and be your happy little delivery girl?

857
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,080
- I have a...
- Ooffee break, anyone?

858
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,280
- Yeah.
- Who's got my keys?

859
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,960
You think Granny would mind
if I went through her garbage?

860
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,660
- Excuse us.
- I thought you were happy.

861
00:48:01,695 --> 00:48:03,320
- Excuse us.
- I thought you were happy.

862
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,840
Open your eyes.

863
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,040
I've never even been outside the forest.

864
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,040
Don't you think I want more than that?

865
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,280
Of course you do. You're a Puckett.

866
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,880
I don't know what that means anymore.

867
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,600
- Hey, look! It's Little Red!
- No, it's just some kid.

868
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,960
- She's not wearing the red hood.
- There she goes!

869
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,000
- Excuse me!
- Little girl!

870
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,560
# "Everything is changing"

871
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,440
# "You're looking for the cure"

872
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,360
<i># "And you feel like"
you're the loneliest girl</i>

873
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,360
# "In the world"

874
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,520
# "Trouble in your head, now"

875
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,240
# "You don't know what to do"

876
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,120
# "Seems like up is down and red"

877
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,040
# "Is blue"

878
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,280
# "Because red is blue"

879
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,320
# "Doesn't make much sense"

880
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,160
# "But red is blue"

881
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:42,400
# "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

882
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,800
How do you remember
all these recipes?

883
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,000
They're all right here
in this book.

884
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,000
Every recipe in here
comes from the Puckett family,

885
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,560
generation after generation. See?

886
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,560
Now, there's Sylvia Puckett
at the North Pole.

887
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,040
She found the best hot chocolate
in the world there.

888
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,760
And there's Emma Puckett.

889
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,880
She flew cheesecakes
across the Atlantic.

890
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,400
For as long as critters
have had a sweet tooth,

891
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,400
Pucketts have been making
and collecting recipes

892
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,080
all over the world,

893
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,680
refining them, giving them
that special Puckett touch.

894
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,080
So you see, Red,
when you put that hood on,

895
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,520
you carry on a grand tradition.

896
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,960
It's a big job, making sure
the world stays sweet.

897
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,640
Huh? What's this?

898
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,800
Oh, it says,
"World's Greatest Grandma. "

899
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,360
Grandma, I can read.

900
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,680
It says,
"Battle of the Iron Oage Gladiators. "

901
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,400
A- ha! Ahh!

902
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,360
- Granny?
- Listen, munchkin.

903
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,720
If there are two things
your Granny doesn't do,

904
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,480
it's lie and play extreme sports.

905
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,600
<i># "In your heart there's a room"
where you lock away</i>

906
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,240
<i># "All the times"
and the things that she said</i>

907
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,000
# "And now red is blue"

908
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,800
# "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

909
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,160
# "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh" #

910
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,400
- Is it a flush that beats a full house?
- No, that's a full house.

911
00:51:25,435 --> 00:51:26,880
- Is it a flush that beats a full house?
- No, that's a full house.

912
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,920
- It's not my turn?
- I know about houses.

913
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,320
I built mine out of straw.
I'm not an idiot.

914
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,760
Am I gonna get to put the cuffs
on someone, or what?

915
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,760
Remember, Ted,

916
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,520
pieces of a puzzle make funny shapes,
but they still fit together in the end.

917
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,680
Boy, you're just full of those,
aren't you?

918
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,800
We are closer to the Bandit
than we've ever been before, chief.

919
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,320
The clues to find him
are right here in this room.

920
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,080
In this room?
That's what I've been saying!

921
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,280
Are you telling me
we're back to square one?

922
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,400
Hold on, Smokey.
Where's the fire?

923
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,000
<i>Timmy, it's Tommy.
You there? Over.</i>

924
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,160
Am I talking to the wall?

925
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,440
<i>If you don't have your walkie,
don't talk to me,</i>

926
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,280
<i>but if you got your walkie, let's talk.</i>

927
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,920
Put everybody in cuffs.
I'm taking them all in.

928
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,480
It's what I do,
that's why I'm police chief.

929
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,880
<i>Timmy, it's Tommy. Pick up.
If you're there, pick up the walkie.</i>

930
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,360
<i>What are you doing this weekend? Over.</i>

931
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,760
We've got this place
locked down, all secured.

932
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,600
It would seem that all of you
came together tonight by mistake.

933
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,440
Maybe you naughty neighbors butted heads
so we could get to the real truth.

934
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,240
- The Goody Bandit.
- That's right.

935
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,200
The Bandit's still at large.

936
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,560
There's been a lot
of finger-pointing tonight,

937
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,600
but now all fingers point to the Bandit.

938
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,760
- Not my finger!
- Oh, no,

939
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,520
you were just out
damaging forest property,

940
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,840
cutting down the redwoods
we all call home.

941
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,800
Big guy like you, you could
probably take whatever you want

942
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,800
from little goody-loving creatures.

943
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,320
But someone robbed me!
Have we lost track of that?

944
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,640
That's right, someone did.

945
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,440
Maybe a snack food competitor.

946
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,160
Right, Granny?

947
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,360
Now, hold on a pea-picking minute!

948
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,040
I may lead a double life
full of secrets and deception,

949
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,480
- but that's no reason to be suspicious.
- Huh?

950
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,040
A woman like you could have a lot
to gain stealing all those recipes.

951
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,440
And that's how she makes
her goodies so good! Huh?

952
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,640
Or she could just be another victim...

953
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,480
- What?
- ... of a hungry wolf!

954
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,480
The wolf did it. Talk about profiling.

955
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,440
Why should we trust someone
who wears disguises for a living?

956
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,000
- Maybe he's not a wolf at all!
- You got me. I'm a poodle.

957
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,600
- Just haven't been to the barbershop.
- Is this all just a big joke to you?

958
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,080
- I just followed the girl here.
- You leave my granddaughter alone!

959
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,360
Yes, now we get to Little Red,

960
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,880
the girl with the basket on the run.

961
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,920
- Where is she, anyway?
- I was just...

962
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,840
The recipes are gone!

963
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,720
- Are you saying Red is the Bandit?
- Not my Red!

964
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,840
Oalm down there, Triple G.

965
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,240
The only thing your
granddaughter is guilty of

966
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,520
is flying hummingbirds
without a license.

967
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,000
It would seem there is
another player in this game,

968
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,760
someone who's hippity-hopped
his way through all of your stories.

969
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,440
Yes, there's someone else.

970
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,640
<i>The only one who was with Red
when she fell...</i>

971
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,440
- Ohh!
- No!

972
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,400
...who knew a shortcut to Granny's...

973
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,200
Oh, yeah. In fact, I know a shortcut.

974
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,120
<i>...who fraternizes
with evil ski teams...</i>

975
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,160
- What's your name?
- Put, "To my biggest and cutest fan. "

976
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,240
...and someone who was there

977
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,480
when the schnitzel truck
was schnitzeled.

978
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,640
What the schnitzel?

979
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,560
Not the bunny!

980
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,800
- I knew it. Never trust a bunny.
- Never trust a bunny!

981
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,920
- Uh, chief.
- Yeah?

982
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,440
No one's seen the bunny or the girl,
and that cable car left the station.

983
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,880
I think we need an APB out
on something small and fuzzy.

984
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,000
I think you're right.

985
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,040
Get your boys to Red's place.
We need to head off that cable car.

986
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,360
And bring in a police sketch artist.
No, make it a cartoonist.

987
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,520
We gotta hurry to beat it down.
Bill, get everyone in the cars.

988
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,360
Tommy, you can bring that evidence
with you. Let's go!

989
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,840
- You heard the chief, let's move it!
- Not in the same car!

990
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,200
Keep it moving.
There's nothing to see.

991
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,680
- Who's got my keys?
- Shotgun.

992
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,920
- Did you get any shots of the bunny?
- The bunny? Why?

993
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,840
I told you to take pictures
of everything!

994
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,000
Ohh! We gotta get this to print
before it's all over the forest!

995
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,200
Something don't sit right
in my bones about this.

996
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,440
- What's that?
- Maybe it's your bones.

997
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,760
I smell schnitzel.

998
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,000
What have they done
to my schnitzel truck?

999
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,800
Why are they going up?

1000
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,160
There's on old cable car station
at the top of the mountain.

1001
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,880
We've got to follow them, boys.
Red's up there. I know it!

1002
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,560
Get down the mountain.
You gotta stop those cops.

1003
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,040
Run 'em off the road,
dangle a donut, I don't care.

1004
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,360
- Tell 'em they're going the wrong way.
- Eezie-peezie! Leave it to me!

1005
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,600
You'll never catch 'em in time.

1006
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,960
Is that coffee?

1007
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,360
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but... drink up.

1008
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,360
We may want...

1009
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,440
...to stand back.

1010
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,640
Yee-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1011
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,400
Oaffeine! Yeah, baby!

1012
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,640
- Whoa!
- Go get 'em, boy.

1013
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,560
What...

1014
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,680
- ... have I done?
- Now the rest is up to us.

1015
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,040
Oan I have coffee?

1016
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,040
I don't like it.
The cops are all over the place.

1017
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,240
Forget about the cops!

1018
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,520
We've got everything
we need right here.

1019
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,240
What about the old lady?
If she's alive, she'll be back.

1020
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,560
You just don't get it, do you,
Dolph? I'm done!

1021
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,160
I'm done dancing for the man!

1022
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,600
The Muffin Man and Granny!

1023
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,520
They can both take a hike!

1024
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:41,680
I'm never gonna answer
to anyone ever again!

1025
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,080
A- ha-ha!

1026
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,200
Ah, I just love my job!

1027
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,040
You see how it works, Dolph?

1028
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,280
You prioritize, you set your goals,
you write a mission statement.

1029
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,240
You ask yourself,
"Where do I see me in five years?"

1030
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,440
How about behind bars?

1031
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,040
Red! Oh, hi, Red! What are you...?

1032
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:11,320
- You've spoiled the surprise.
- You're the Bandit.

1033
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,360
Surprise!

1034
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,680
I'm walkin' out of here
with those recipes.

1035
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,960
- Really?
- Yeah.

1036
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,560
You're a bad bunny.

1037
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,720
Oh, somebody's finally catching up!

1038
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,320
Did you think I followed you around
on your deliveries because I liked you?

1039
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,560
Oh, you best be fearing the ear, baby.

1040
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,160
Ahh!

1041
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,080
Hai-yahh!

1042
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,320
Is that all you got?

1043
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,000
- Ohh!
- Ha! You hit like a girl!

1044
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,400
Oome on.

1045
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,400
And ka-blam!

1046
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,920
Why don't you go home
and cry to your granny?

1047
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,640
Dolph, tie up the brat.
Lesa, hold the book.

1048
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,840
Vincent, get the truck. And Keith...

1049
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,360
Darn it, change your name. Please.

1050
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,160
That's not scary,
and I'm embarrassed to say it.

1051
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,040
- Boris. Try that.
- Hmm.

1052
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,520
Keith. You know?

1053
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,520
Oh, watch out for Keith.

1054
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,680
- You're crazy!
- Maybe so.

1055
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,280
But I'm top of the woods now, baby!

1056
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,720
# When you're

1057
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,080
# Hopping on down the bunny trail

1058
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,160
# The critters all seem to look down

1059
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,800
# You're fuzzy and small
Your ears are too tall

1060
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,080
# And goodies make the woods go round

1061
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,120
# Now, I'm not a pig
But you gotta think big

1062
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,720
# When you're competing
with the girl in the hood

1063
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,240
# So you won't be a fan of my evil plan

1064
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,760
# But I'm gonna be top of the woods

1065
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,840
# Now the kids will be packed
with my Boingo snacks

1066
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,320
# Oonstruction begins in a day

1067
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,320
# And all of the bears
will be ruled by the hare

1068
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,720
# As I maniacally plot
from my evil lair

1069
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:16,240
We've really grown in the past year.
Nabbing all the recipes was phase one.

1070
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,440
Now phase two is adding
my own special ingredient

1071
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,640
to every goody.

1072
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,920
A little something
I like to call "Boingonium. "

1073
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,240
It makes my snacks a little more...
habit-forming.

1074
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,520
Happy customer!

1075
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,000
Phase three gets a little messy.

1076
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,720
I'm gonna need a lot of real estate
down the mountain,

1077
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,600
so I've gotta blow the competition away.

1078
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,040
Oh, and that's not a metaphor.

1079
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,480
We've literally got
to blow them away. OK?

1080
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,120
Yeah, I got it.

1081
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,120
And now that I have
your granny's secrets,

1082
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,600
I'm afraid you'll be taking
the dyno-mite express home.

1083
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,520
# You won't be disrespecting
this bunny no more

1084
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,160
# 'Oause I'm gonna be top of the woods
Oh, yeah

1085
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,040
# I said I'm gonna be top of the woods

1086
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,400
# Let's bring it on home!

1087
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,120
# I said, I'm gonna be

1088
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,280
# Top of the woods

1089
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,960
# You've been hoodwinked, baby!

1090
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,400
# Oh, yeah #

1091
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,440
Sweet tea and cookies!
We got to do something!

1092
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,440
I know.

1093
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,280
The song was catchy,
but the choreography was terrible.

1094
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,240
OK, listen.

1095
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,840
I have an idea, but we need
to get past that ski team.

1096
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,720
The toughest one is the big fella,
really mean-looking,

1097
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,480
with a fat head and a thick skull.
Looks like a shaved ape.

1098
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,280
I mean, he is u-u-u-ugly!

1099
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,600
Like a big, swollen, overgrown...

1100
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,600
He's standing right behind me, isn't he?

1101
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,760
- Mm-hm.
- Ahh!

1102
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,840
Ah.

1103
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,320
Ohh! Ohh!

1104
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,160
Whoa!

1105
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,200
Whew!

1106
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:07,560
- Who taught you how to drive?
- Almost hit a squirrel. That was close.

1107
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,480
Whee-yahh!

1108
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,120
What's the big idea?

1109
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,320
I could've made road pizza
out of you, kid!

1110
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,720
- What's he saying?
- What is it, boy?

1111
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,840
Truck. Trouble at the mill!

1112
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,000
Is the barn on fire?

1113
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,160
The barn's on fire! The well!
Timmy's stuck in the well!

1114
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,240
Hold on. He seems to be
speaking words of some kind.

1115
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,600
Pffsst!

1116
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,080
You're a delivery girl.
Then could you do me a favor?

1117
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,040
Oould you take this down the mountain?

1118
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,280
'Oause it absolutely, positively
has to be there tonight!

1119
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,880
I'm sorry. What?
I can't quite... with the...

1120
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,200
You got something right there
across your mouth!

1121
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,760
You're an actor, right?
So this is your big part.

1122
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,840
This is the role of a lifetime.
Make them believe in you.

1123
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,840
Don't act like an evil henchman,
be an evil henchman. Got it?

1124
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,080
- Know what you're gonna say, right?
- Right!

1125
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,560
- Mr. Rabbit?
- Dolph! Where have you been?

1126
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,040
You nim-witted Eurotrash with the...
What is that, a ski mask?

1127
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,840
I like that. See, that's scary.
That's good.

1128
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,920
- Boss...
- What? Say it! Spit it out!

1129
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,240
- What's going on?
- Boss...

1130
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,880
Paul's Bunion cream
has the soothing formula...

1131
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,200
Hi there. What he means to say
is that I'm the building inspector.

1132
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,080
- Yes.
- I just need to tap the pipes

1133
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,760
to see if your wiring's up to par.

1134
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:38,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it. You're not...
No. You can't touch anything in here.

1135
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,600
Let's walk.

1136
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,480
Let me level with you.
You're an evil genius, right?

1137
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,880
Well, I don't know
if I'd say genius, you know.

1138
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,480
I was asked to join Mensa.

1139
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,160
You got an evil lair in a cave,
that's standard,

1140
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,960
but see, most masters of evil
that we deal with

1141
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,240
are up to evil genius code.

1142
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,160
Are you familiar with the code?

1143
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,520
You know, I'm more of a
do-it-yourself kind of guy. Yeah.

1144
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,160
I understand.
Thinking about putting in a laser?

1145
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,600
I don't know. I don't...
Do you think I should?

1146
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,680
Well, it's standard equipment
for a cave lair.

1147
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,080
I'm not saying you're
gonna zap someone today,

1148
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,400
but you gotta think about the future.
They gotta be calibrated.

1149
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,280
- You gonna do that yourself?
- Well, I... I...

1150
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,440
We should take a look
at that power grid.

1151
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,720
OK. Yeah, sure, sure.

1152
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,320
Wait a minute.

1153
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,280
I smell hairspray.

1154
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,200
A- haaa!

1155
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,600
Oome here, you little bunny!

1156
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,280
Huh?

1157
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,760
Ooh!

1158
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,880
Whoo!

1159
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,200
Ha-ha!

1160
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,840
Gotcha!

1161
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,720
Get over here!

1162
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,560
Aahhh!

1163
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,760
Hey, Puckett!

1164
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,040
Little Red's gonna take a ride!

1165
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,720
And there ain't...

1166
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,280
...no...

1167
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,520
...brakes!

1168
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,560
Red!

1169
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,680
Aah!

1170
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,840
Whoo!

1171
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,280
She doesn't trust you anymore, Granny!

1172
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,120
Out of my way, bunny!

1173
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,840
Whoo! Ha-ha!

1174
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,000
Ahh!

1175
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,000
Uhh!

1176
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,920
Dolph!

1177
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,240
Whahh!

1178
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,920
Wow, that's a... that's a long way.

1179
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,360
- We could take the truck.
- Let's take the truck.

1180
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,600
Yeah, cool.

1181
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,400
They go up, you go down.
Gotta help! APB! Get the bunny!

1182
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,680
- This squirrel ate the wrong nuts.
- English! What's wrong with you?

1183
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,360
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

1184
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,840
Ah... OK.

1185
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,040
<i>The criminal cannot be found
at the bottom of the mountain.</i>

1186
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,320
<i>He resides at the top
in a cave fortress</i>

1187
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,640
<i>where my companions
are trying to detain him.</i>

1188
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,120
Aww.

1189
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,680
- That's more like it.
- How do we know he's on the level?

1190
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,560
He threw himself in front of a car.
That's commitment.

1191
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,360
No, that's crazy.
We can't get up there in time anyway.

1192
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,160
Hey, chief! It looks like
they're coming to us!

1193
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,120
Ahh!

1194
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,720
Ohh! Ohh!

1195
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,600
A- ha!

1196
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,560
- Granny!
- I'm coming, honey!

1197
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,160
Grab the hood!

1198
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,720
Aahhh!

1199
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,000
Hold tight!

1200
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,080
Whoo-hoo!

1201
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,640
End of the line, ladies!

1202
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,520
- Granny!
- You know what to do.

1203
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,680
Whoo!

1204
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,760
Oh, wonderful.

1205
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,920
No!

1206
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,240
Watch your head.

1207
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,200
- Oh!
- Ow!

1208
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,240
That hurts.

1209
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,080
Get 'em outta here, boys.

1210
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,560
- No, no, no, no. Not prison.
- Say Parcheesi!

1211
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,600
Not prison! Not for a cute
little bunny rabbit!

1212
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,240
Granny, Little Bit, we got 'em!

1213
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,520
- Not bad for a little cookie maker.
- Thanks.

1214
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:52,040
I guess I must have had
my eyes shut pretty tight

1215
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,480
not to see how fast
you were growing up.

1216
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,160
You were really something up there.

1217
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,800
I take after my granny.

1218
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,680
Hello, everybody!
Here, we have the book!

1219
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,480
- What happened here tonight?
- My granny swooped in and saved me.

1220
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,680
- And the whole forest!
- It was my Red who saved the day.

1221
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,280
Well, it was a group effort,
spearheaded by myself, of course.

1222
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:26,600
You'll read the story in tomorrow's
column, but I will take a few questions.

1223
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,240
Mr. Kirkendal will be appearing
in our ad campaign...

1224
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,360
- I got a call-back!
- No, don't talk.

1225
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,320
If a tree falls in the forest,
you'll get three stories,

1226
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,800
yours, mine and the tree's.

1227
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,800
Well, a bunny gone bad
is going away,

1228
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,880
and you'll wake up tomorrow
with piping hot tea cakes,

1229
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,800
same as always.

1230
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,840
Ooh!

1231
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,400
Those are piping hot.

1232
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,720
So how about that new
delivery system?

1233
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,120
Well, it beats riding a bike,
that's for sure.

1234
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,200
# I got horns that hold the muffins

1235
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,280
# And I got horns that hold the pies

1236
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,040
Hey, did you hear about Kirk?
He finally made it.

1237
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,720
- Wanna see the show with us?
- I'm allergic to yodeling.

1238
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,160
- Now, Wolfie...
- I'm front page material now,

1239
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,360
I'm about to crack a story
about the three pigs

1240
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,840
running a home improvement scam.
Houses falling.

1241
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,240
I got the wide-angle lenses
for those piggies.

1242
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,400
You sure this is the right place?

1243
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,040
- Ah.
- Mr. Flippers.

1244
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,800
I see you all got my message.

1245
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,040
- Glad you could make it.
- What's going on?

1246
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,280
Well, I was wondering if you would
like to come and work for me.

1247
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,800
I could use some fresh talent like you.

1248
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,640
What kind of work
are we talking about?

1249
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,480
You'd be undercover,
on impossible missions...

1250
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,760
...to faraway places.

1251
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,120
There's a lot of stories out there
that need a happy ending.

1252
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,160
I'm part of a secret organization
that makes sure that happens.

1253
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,480
"Happily Ever After Agency"?

1254
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,880
The woods don't
go around by themselves.

1255
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,320
We fight the bad guys,
swing through the windows

1256
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,160
secret-agent-style, right?

1257
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,360
So, what do you think?

1258
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,080
Bring it, honey.

1259
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,720
I always did like happy endings.
