1
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,317
Will you stop your daydreaming,
Tommy Stubbins?

2
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:22,876
- Hello, Matt.
- Come and help me select
a suitable dinner...

3
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:25,445
- for me clients here.
- Can I push the barrow?

4
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:28,425
Well, it's not gonna
push itself now, is it?

5
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,984
It's against my religion to do anything
violent till the end of the day.

6
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:32,996
God bless all Irishmen.

7
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:35,726
You know what I was thinking, Matt?

8
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,735
- No, what was that?
Not for you, me darling.

9
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:40,567
It'll make your fur fall out.

10
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,233
I was thinking
that if you sold your fish barrow,

11
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:45,242
and I sold my grandfather's watch,

12
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,244
we could buy a boat and go to China.

13
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:50,907
Oh. Oh, you're the middle
and two ends of a fine fellow, Tom.

14
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:54,008
It's a beautiful proposition,
but don't you see the problem?

15
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:57,213
- What's that?
- Well, do you speak Chinese?

16
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,884
- No.
- Then, if you sell
your grandfather's watch,

17
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,950
and we go to China,

18
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:05,394
how are you goin' to tell the time?

19
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:09,298
- I never thought of that.
- Ah, well, you see,
you have to plan ahead.

20
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,301
It's very important.

21
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,304
I mean, the whole secret
of my success with the fish barrow...

22
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,602
was years of planning ahead.

23
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:18,609
Thank you, Charlie.

24
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:22,340
May the 17 holy men of Donnybrook
reward you in heaven.

25
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,575
I'd sooner you rewarded me down here.

26
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:27,413
- Who's this then?
- Wild duck off the marshes.

27
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:30,751
- Is that a fact?
- Flew straight into the mast,
cross-eyed fool.

28
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:33,620
Can you imagine that now?
He was probably under the influence.

29
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:36,160
He looks Irish to me.

30
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:38,992
Don't worry.
I'll fix him up.

31
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:40,998
Bring him back.
That's my dinner.

32
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:43,000
Now don't ask me
to do that, Charlie.

33
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:45,002
As Secretary for the Preservation
of Irish Ducks,

34
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,937
it's more than me job is worth.

35
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,942
You never told me
you were secretary of Irish ducks.

36
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,138
Oh, well, now I don't
talk about it much.

37
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:58,182
- I'm a very modest fella.
- What are we going to do with it then?

38
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,184
Well, now, as soon as
I finish me deliveries,

39
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:02,117
we'll take him over
to John Dolittle.

40
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,121
- Here.
- Who's John Dolittle?

41
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:06,180
Eat hearty, me lovelies.

42
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:09,727
- And heaven bless
all Catholic pussycats.
- Who is John Dolittle?

43
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,229
John Dolittle is the greatest
animal doctor in the world today...

44
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:16,732
and a close personal friend
of Matthew Mugg.

45
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,734
He lives right here
in Puddleby, he does.

46
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:21,396
- Out on the Oxenthorpe Road.
- What does he do?

47
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:26,102
He's a genius. That's what he does.
He can talk to animals.

48
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:28,440
- Talk to them?
- Speaks their language, he does.

49
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:30,446
Just like you and me's chatting now.

50
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:33,540
He'll have a word with
that little fellow in wild duck talk...

51
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:35,551
and put him straight in no time.

52
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:37,553
Oh, the darlin' man.

53
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:41,387
He'd think nothin' of travelin' halfway
round the world to cure a sick sparrow.

54
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,518
Only last week,
he went all the way to Africa.

55
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:47,496
Ask me why.

56
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:50,658
- Why?
- Why? I'll tell you.

57
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:53,760
To look after a crocodile
with toothache.

58
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:56,897
He's altogether a marvelous man.

59
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:01,939
And he understands the Irish.

60
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:04,947
And any man who
understands the Irish

61
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:09,179
Can't be reckoned
altogether bad

62
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:11,278
The same way
that the lunatic

63
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,414
Whose patron saint
is Patrick

64
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,256
Can't be reckoned
altogether mad

65
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:21,163
The doctor's very smart

66
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,165
He's an Irishman at heart

67
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,963
His favorite color
Sure it must be green

68
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:28,971
And also he's a man

69
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,973
Who'll blarney when he can

70
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,807
Let me explain
the sort of thing I mean

71
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:38,541
My friend the doctor says
the moon is made of apple pie

72
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:42,517
And once a month
it's eaten by the sun

73
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:44,520
And that is why
up in the sky

74
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:46,579
You'll find
as every month goes by

75
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:50,115
Somebody in the sky
is making another one

76
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:53,960
My friend the doctor says
the sun is made of cheddar cheese

77
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:57,762
The doctor even knows
the reason why

78
00:08:57,835 --> 00:08:59,769
The facts are these
Try if you please

79
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:01,828
Pretending you're a lonely cheese

80
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:04,135
Wouldn't you want
to try finding an apple pie

81
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,142
Of course you would.

82
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,873
Maybe what the doctor tells me

83
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:12,711
Isn't altogether true

84
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:16,947
But I love every tale he tells me

85
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,387
I don't know any better ones
Do you?

86
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:24,621
My friend the doctor says
the world is full of fantasy

87
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:28,096
And who are you and I
to disagree

88
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:30,190
Let's hope and pray
that is the way

89
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:32,201
The life we love
will always stay

90
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,568
For my friend the doctor

91
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,972
And me

92
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:58,595
La, la, la, la

93
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:03,389
Here, Tom, catch!

94
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:09,666
My friend the doctor says
the stars are made of lemon drops

95
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,198
The bigger ones are
lollipops and ice  Come on!

96
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:15,211
The clouds have shops
up on the top

97
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,213
That sells you sweets
and soda pop

98
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:19,215
What do they call the place

99
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:21,217
-  Isn't it paradise

100
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:36,491
My friend the doctor says
that every time it starts to rain

101
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:40,332
And people run indoors
again in swarms

102
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:42,338
If you remain out in the rain

103
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,431
You'll think you're drinking
pink champagne

104
00:10:44,508 --> 00:10:47,909
And you'll spend your life
praying for thunderstorms

105
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:52,472
Maybe what the doctor tells me

106
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:55,575
Isn't altogether true

107
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:59,645
But I love every tale
he tells me

108
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:03,318
I don't know any better ones
Do you?

109
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:07,124
My friend the doctor says
the world is full of fantasy

110
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:10,758
And who are you and I
to disagree

111
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,768
Let's hope and pray
that is the way

112
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:17,330
The life we love will always stay
for my friend the doctor

113
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:22,344
My friend the doctor and me

114
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:27,381
What was that?

115
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:31,478
- Ah, now, that's just some of his pets.
- Pets?

116
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,260
Polynesia,
me lovely little darling.

117
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:48,270
Give us a kiss then. Here.

118
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,467
And, Chee-Chee,
how are you, me old rascal?

119
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:57,138
I'd like you to meet one of me
dearest friends. Master Thomas Stubbins.

120
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:59,148
Tom, this is Miss Polynesia.

121
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:02,049
How do you do, Master Stubbins?

122
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,553
How do you do, Miss Polynesia?

123
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:08,113
You wanna watch out for her, Tom.
She's 199 years old.

124
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:11,354
She can remember every single word
that's been spoken to her...

125
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:14,886
since the execution
of Charles I in 1648.

126
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:19,402
- Isn't that right, Polynesia?
- No, Matthew, 'twas 1649.

127
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:23,639
'Twas a Tuesday.

128
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:26,141
Oh, yeah, right.
You see what I mean?

129
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,200
And this is Chee-Chee.

130
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:30,212
- How do you do, Chee-Chee?

131
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,339
- Where's the good doctor?
- He's working in the library.

132
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,407
Show them in, Chee-Chee.

133
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:41,355
I know he's in there.

134
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,614
Good heavens, Matthew.

135
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:41,776
Oh, I'm terrible sorry. I must have
frightened them out of their lives.

136
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,786
Matthew, you're soaking wet.

137
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:46,254
You're a little
on the damp side yourself, sir.

138
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:48,257
Oh, it's these fish languages.

139
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:51,055
They really only work underwater.

140
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,119
It's fascinating.

141
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:57,326
The basic system is
mouth movements and bubble signals.

142
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,334
At the moment,
I can only make big bubbles,

143
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:01,267
and they keep
telling me I'm shouting.

144
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:03,272
Beggin' me ignorance, sir,

145
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,798
but what can you hope to get out
of a conversation with a goldfish?

146
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:08,811
Matthew, I'll show you.

147
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:16,713
The legendary great pink sea snail.

148
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:19,220
For hundreds of years, sailors
have claimed that they've seen it.

149
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:22,554
Oh, poor devils.
It's that rotten stock they drink.

150
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:27,288
But, uh, what has this
got to do with goldfish?

151
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:29,764
I don't believe it's legendary.
I believe it actually exists.

152
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,767
What's that got to do
with goldfish?

153
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:33,769
Well, I'm planning
a voyage to find it.

154
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,771
That is, if I can get
enough money together.

155
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,898
Oh, may the saints
reward you, sir.

156
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:39,908
But, uh, what's that
got to do with the...

157
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:42,809
Well, if I find it, Matthew,
I'm going to want to talk to it.

158
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,507
Therefore, I have to acquire
a knowledge of ancient shellfish,

159
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:47,550
which is extremely complicated.

160
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:49,642
So, I'm starting
with basic fish languages,

161
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:52,449
like halibut, mackerel and goldfish.

162
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:56,219
Ah, there, you see? I knew it
had something to do with goldfish.

163
00:14:58,094 --> 00:15:00,756
Now, about your last voyage, Doctor.

164
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,890
Did, uh, did you find
the crocodile with a toothache?

165
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:07,198
Crocodile?
Oh, yes, in the Congo, yes.

166
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,397
I got back on Saturday.

167
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:13,932
- Look.
- Isn't that a beauty now?

168
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,978
Make a marvelous bottle opener.

169
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:18,606
Look at that, Tom.
Oh, forgive me, Doctor.

170
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:22,641
- This is me ol' pal, Tommy Stubbins.
- How do you do, sir?

171
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:25,882
- He's brought a patient for you.
- It's a duck, sir.

172
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:28,686
- It's a drake.

173
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:30,692
You're sopping wet too.

174
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,955
- Yes, sir, it's raining.

175
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,067
He's hurt his wing, sir.

176
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:41,069
- Yes, so he's been telling me.

177
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:43,935
Oh, quack, quack.
Oh, poor chap, yes.

178
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:45,941
Sorry.

179
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:49,968
Quack, quack.

180
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:52,514
He had a row with his wife
and wasn't looking where he was going.

181
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:54,516
He told you all that?

182
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:56,711
They're very neurotic creatures.

183
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:00,756
You'll be all right by the morning.

184
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:05,490
Yes, I'll get word to your wife.

185
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:07,621
Quack, quack, quack.

186
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:12,194
Now, while our friend's
convalescing,

187
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,328
I'll try and find you
something dry to wear.

188
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,395
Then, we all can have
some food together.

189
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:19,169
- Polynesia, two more for dinner.
- Yes, Doctor.

190
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:22,143
Oh, and, Matthew, hold on
to that crocodile's tooth.

191
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:24,407
Must be a bottle somewhere
you can open with it.

192
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,738
Gub-Gub.

193
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:59,373
Will you please stop making
that infernal noise?

194
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,474
A few pork sausages
and a bit of bacon.

195
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:05,419
The way you're carrying on, you'd think
we were cooking your entire family.

196
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:07,922
Chee-Chee, make him behave.

197
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:16,255
But you can hardly blame him
for being a bit upset, Doctor.

198
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:20,133
I'd be upset meself if you
started frying Irishmen.

199
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:22,228
You know the problem
as well as I do, Matthew.

200
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:25,331
I've nearly 600 mouths to feed,
including the mice.

201
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:27,569
- Six hundred!
- Yes. So if the butcher...

202
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,703
gives me a string of sausages
now and then, I take it,

203
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:32,009
whether it upsets Gub-Gub or not.

204
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,141
Anyway, he eats more
than any of us.

205
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:36,151
Sure you won't be
having anything?

206
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:38,744
- Quite sure. Thank you, Matthew.
- Aren't you hungry, Doctor?

207
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:40,756
Yes, but I follow
a very special diet, Stubbins.

208
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:44,487
- It's highly nutritious and very good.
- Oh, I see.

209
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:47,689
The doctor's in rather
an awkward position, you see, Tom.

210
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:49,732
- Aren't you, Doctor?
- What do you mean, Matt?

211
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,200
You understand, Stubbins,
he means meat.

212
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:56,102
It upsets the animals
if I, uh...

213
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:58,504
- Oh, of course.
- So I don't.

214
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:03,410
As a matter of principle,
one should always try to avoid
eating one's friends.

215
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,911
The day that I became
a veterinarian

216
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:10,180
I had a sudden
overwhelming wish

217
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:13,154
To be a pure
and simple vegetarian

218
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:16,249
And give up eating
all that meat and fish

219
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:19,989
- I think that's marvelous.
- Meat is very unhealthy for you.

220
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:23,430
So now I live
on healthy food instead

221
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,401
Like apple cores
and parsnip juice

222
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:29,233
And chunks of plain
brown bread

223
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:33,601
All right, all right.
I'm coming.

224
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,176
When I see my fellowman
consuming sirloin steak

225
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:45,415
And I find myself enjoying
tea and Dundee cake

226
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:49,151
There is really only
one conclusion I can make

227
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:52,353
I'm a devoted vegetarian

228
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:54,363
No, no, no, no,
you've had yours.

229
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:02,365
When my host at dinner
offers succulent roast beef

230
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:06,341
Proudly I refuse it
People stare in disbelief

231
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:09,936
Lost in admiration
as I nibble on a leaf

232
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:13,608
A very noted vegetarian

233
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:17,619
I wouldn't even eat horseradish,
in case I upset the horses.

234
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:21,487
I stay away
from deviled ham on principle

235
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:25,187
I wouldn't eat roast duckling
if I could

236
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:28,958
Willpower has made me invincible

237
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:32,126
My word
Those sausages look good

238
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,372
Where's my dinner gone?

239
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:41,433
They've done it again.

240
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:44,844
Come on. Own up. Who's got it
this time? Who's got my dinner?

241
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:48,947
It's bad enough to have to eat
this muck in the first place.

242
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:51,145
Just 'cause I eat this
instead of eating them,

243
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:53,155
they think they can
take advantage of me.

244
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:55,157
You've no idea what I put up with
on their account.

245
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:59,127
I eat every flowering shrub
there is except for gorse

246
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:03,097
Sometimes I get luxuries
like beetroot leaves, of course

247
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:07,159
My life's much the same
as that of any English horse

248
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:11,139
Why should I be a vegetarian

249
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,904
Turnip pie and peanuts
That's the sort of filth I eat

250
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:18,607
Any sort of rubbish
that is wholesome and discreet

251
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:22,173
Why don't I admit
that my hypocrisy's complete

252
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:25,585
If I should live
to be a centenarian

253
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:29,352
Become our most adored
humanitarian

254
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:32,656
I'll never make
a decent vegetarian

255
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:34,663
I'm a cheat, I love meat

256
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,665
I'm a cheat, yes, I am

257
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,894
I love red-blooded
juicy chunks of meat

258
00:20:38,968 --> 00:20:40,902
Legs of lamb, sides of beef

259
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,564
And chops and steaks
and veal and pork, of course

260
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,006
-  My favorite meal

261
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:52,880
And then I hear
poor Gub-Gub squeal

262
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:56,749
Oh, me, oh, my

263
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:00,118
A reluctant but sincere

264
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:03,181
Vegetarian

265
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,523
Am I

266
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,257
So, you see, Stubbins,
being an animal doctor has its problems.

267
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:13,928
For one thing, you don't get paid
anything, at least not in money.

268
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:16,233
You get bones
or nuts or worms...

269
00:21:16,306 --> 00:21:19,298
or whatever the particular
animal's currency happens to be.

270
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,742
And secondly, most of the animals who
come here as patients like it so much,

271
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:24,780
they stay here permanently.

272
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:27,782
It's hardly what you'd call
a profit-making enterprise.

273
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,943
But who looks after
the animals?

274
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:31,953
They look after themselves,
for the most part.

275
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:34,581
Animals are much better
at that than human beings.

276
00:21:34,657 --> 00:21:36,591
And how did you become a veteran?

277
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,457
No, Stubbins,
the word is "veterinarian."

278
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,020
But say "animal doctor."
It's less pretentious.

279
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:44,362
It all happened
rather suddenly, actually.

280
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:46,925
My entire life changed in one day,
didn't it, Matthew?

281
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:53,708
It was my sister, Sarah,
who started it all.

282
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:55,710
Sarah.

283
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:13,595
Oh!

284
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:21,099
Did you know that an ant has
more intelligence than a hippopotamus?

285
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,502
And that a grasshopper...
in relation to his size...

286
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:27,270
has more power in his hind legs
than a kangaroo?

287
00:22:27,343 --> 00:22:29,334
Absolutely fascinating.

288
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:33,212
There's no doubt about it. Animals
are much more interesting than people.

289
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:37,150
Good heavens, Sarah.
What on Earth are you doing down there?

290
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:41,884
There are pigeons
in the linen cupboard.

291
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,893
- Oh, yes, I thought
it would be warmer for them.
- You knew?

292
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:47,862
Yes, I put them there. It gets
so terribly chilly on the roof at night.

293
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,728
And two tortoises
in the guest room.

294
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,360
That's where they are.
I wondered where they got to.

295
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:56,428
- And white mice
in your chest of drawers.
- That's right.

296
00:22:56,506 --> 00:22:59,498
And the grass snakes are
in the roll top desk under the envelopes.

297
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:01,509
Grass snakes?

298
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:04,171
John Dolittle, if those animals
aren't out of this house by tonight...

299
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,375
Oh, dear!

300
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,511
Nine o'clock precisely.

301
00:23:11,587 --> 00:23:13,521
That will be Lady Petherington.

302
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:15,523
I wonder what she's found wrong
with herself today.

303
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:17,525
All right, Sarah.
Show her in, please.

304
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:22,796
I mean it, John.
I shall leave.

305
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:27,029
Those animals,
they're destroying your practice.

306
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:29,537
You won't have
a decent patient left soon.

307
00:23:29,605 --> 00:23:31,539
Not unless you answer the door.

308
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:36,306
I don't understand the things that go on
around this house with those animals.

309
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:39,075
And we'll probably never see
the vicar's wife again...

310
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:42,174
after giving her that glass of milk
with a frog in it.

311
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:47,222
I really don't know
what you expect me to do.

312
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:51,960
Oh, good morning,
Lady Petherington.

313
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:53,962
Are we feeling better today?

314
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,967
We're no better for being left to freeze
to death on Doctor's front doorsteps.

315
00:23:59,035 --> 00:24:01,128
Oh.

316
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:05,834
Dr. Dolittle,
oh, it's my nerves.

317
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:08,570
You must do something
for them instantly.

318
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:10,839
Oh, you'll never guess
what happened.

319
00:24:10,913 --> 00:24:13,347
It's quite the worst
experience of my life.

320
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,350
Uh, won't you come in,
Lady Petherington?

321
00:24:15,418 --> 00:24:17,784
I was giving
this dinner party last night...

322
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:19,981
up at the Grange
for the Duke of St. Albans.

323
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:25,050
Fifty guests. The most
embarrassing moment of my entire life.

324
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:27,596
A mouse ran across the table.

325
00:24:27,663 --> 00:24:29,893
Oh, I thought I'd die.

326
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:33,902
I may still.
Can you imagine? A mouse.

327
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,438
Do you know who was there, hmm?

328
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:38,440
Well, of course, everybody.

329
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:40,567
The humiliation.

330
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:43,669
Crown Prince Angelicus
of Brandenberg.

331
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:47,079
He's so well-bred,
he doesn't even know what a mouse is.

332
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,584
Fainted dead away.

333
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:51,677
I haven't slept all night.

334
00:24:51,754 --> 00:24:54,018
Of course, I discharged
my entire staff,

335
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,024
especially the gardeners.

336
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:59,084
I'll be struck
from the social directory.

337
00:24:59,162 --> 00:25:01,790
A mouse. Hmph.

338
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:11,236
- Vicar, what a surprise!
- Bless me.

339
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:13,832
How is your frog?
I mean, your wife.

340
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,402
Oh, the less said about her the better.
I mean, that incident.

341
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,383
Most unfor... for... for... fortunate.

342
00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:24,976
Bless me.

343
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:27,284
Miss Dolittle, it's my hay fever.

344
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:30,086
The Bishop of Glastonbury
is attending my sermon this evening,

345
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,559
- and it's most important,
you understand.
- Of course.

346
00:25:32,628 --> 00:25:34,926
- But my hay... hay...

347
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:39,624
Oh! Oh! Oh!

348
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:41,897
But... But... Oh!

349
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:53,006
- Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!

350
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:55,016
Where in the heavens does
that woman think she's going?

351
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:58,212
- Get out of my way, Vicar!

352
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:00,221
Oh!

353
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:05,420
Ow!

354
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:08,691
Oh!

355
00:26:08,764 --> 00:26:10,732
Oh!

356
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:16,896
Ow!

357
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:23,806
Oh, let me out of this madhouse!

358
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,440
- Oh! Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!

359
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:33,420
Ow!

360
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:52,073
John!

361
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,575
Yes, Sarah?

362
00:26:54,644 --> 00:26:58,546
I shall give you just five minutes
to make up your mind.

363
00:26:58,614 --> 00:27:02,015
Either you get rid of every
hideous bird, beast and reptile...

364
00:27:02,084 --> 00:27:04,848
in this ridiculous
menagerie immediately,

365
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:07,515
- or I am leaving... today!
- But...

366
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,788
- Five minutes.
- Sarah, I can't just...

367
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:13,795
Oh, yes, you can just.

368
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:21,061
I don't think five minutes
is very long.

369
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:35,550
Anybody home?

370
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:37,552
Oh, come in, Matthew.

371
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:42,119
Well, l-I didn't know
you was having a party.

372
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:49,626
What are we celebrating?

373
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:54,033
You know, Matthew,
today I made a great discovery.

374
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:58,699
Oh? What was that then?

375
00:27:58,774 --> 00:28:00,901
I'm a terrible doctor.

376
00:28:00,977 --> 00:28:03,946
I'm probably
the worst doctor in the world.

377
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:07,642
Good for you.
I like a man who knows his worth.

378
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:12,416
I have absolutely no interest in
the health and welfare of my patients.

379
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:14,854
I can't begin
to communicate with them.

380
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:16,983
I don't even want
to communicate with them.

381
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:20,859
I've come to the conclusion that, with
the possible exception of yourself,

382
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,058
I have nothing in common
with the human race.

383
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:27,102
You know, the trouble with you,
John Dolittle,

384
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:29,831
is you prefer animals to people.

385
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:33,306
But animals are
so much more fun than people.

386
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:36,140
Then be an animal doctor.

387
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:43,911
- What was that?
- I said, "Be an animal doctor."

388
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:46,546
Animal doctor?

389
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:49,853
You know more about animals
than anybody I've ever met.

390
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:53,656
I could get every sick animal
within miles to come to you.

391
00:28:53,729 --> 00:28:56,562
Aye, so could I.

392
00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:58,725
At least all the dogs and cats.

393
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:02,430
All the rich ones, that is.
The Pekes and the poodles.

394
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,564
I could slip a little something
into their meat.

395
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,235
Shh, Matthew.
What do you mean?

396
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,269
I mean, there isn't one good
animal doctor in the west of England.

397
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:14,748
Farmer Green's cow was saying
only the other day...

398
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:19,379
she just will not have another calf
until she gets a decent doctor.

399
00:29:19,455 --> 00:29:21,616
You mean, you spoke to her?

400
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,624
At the Animals' Welfare League.

401
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:26,286
We meet every Wednesday.
She's chair-cow.

402
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:30,458
You mean, animals actually
talk to one another?

403
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:33,400
Well, of course, we can.
Do you think we're all dumb?

404
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:36,961
L... No, no.
I knew parrots could talk.

405
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,475
Parrots are the finest linguists
in the animal kingdom.

406
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:44,707
I speak over 2,000 languages,
including dodo and unicorn.

407
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,580
- Unicorn?
- I have a classical education.

408
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:52,451
Polynesia, could I learn
to talk to animals?

409
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:55,752
I don't see why not.
You're quite intelligent.

410
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:57,759
Oh, thank you.

411
00:29:59,662 --> 00:30:01,960
If I succeeded, I could become...

412
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:05,000
the greatest animal doctor
in the world.

413
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:08,093
Oh, no question.
Mind you, it isn't easy.

414
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,138
I'm the only parrot
in the world...

415
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:13,698
who actually understands
what she's talking about.

416
00:30:13,776 --> 00:30:16,301
Well, if you can do it,
I don't see why I shouldn't.

417
00:30:16,378 --> 00:30:18,369
I like your attitude.

418
00:30:18,447 --> 00:30:20,950
Why have I never thought
of this before?

419
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:24,382
Polynesia, I want you
to teach me everything you know.

420
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:26,819
What, 2,000 languages?

421
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:29,289
Certainly. We'll start
at 8:00 tomorrow morning.

422
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:31,792
But it took me
over a hundred years.

423
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,693
Then we'll start at 7:00.
There's not a moment to lose.

424
00:30:34,763 --> 00:30:37,254
Matthew, think
what it would mean...

425
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,131
If I could talk
to the animals

426
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:44,696
Just imagine it
Chatting to a chimp in chimpanzee

427
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:48,539
Imagine talking to a tiger
Chatting to a cheetah

428
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,206
What a neat achievement
that would be

429
00:30:53,282 --> 00:30:55,546
If we could talk
to the animals

430
00:30:55,617 --> 00:30:57,551
Learn their languages

431
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:00,213
Maybe take an animal degree

432
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:04,487
I'd study elephant and eagle
buffalo and beagle

433
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,586
Alligator, guinea pig and flea

434
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:11,258
I would converse
in polar bear and python

435
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,860
And I would curse
in fluent kangaroo

436
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:18,395
If people asked me
Can you speak rhinoceros

437
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:21,068
I'd say, of course-eros
Can't you

438
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:33,083
If I conferred
with our furry friends

439
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:37,558
Man-to-animal
Think of the amazing repartee

440
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:40,117
If I could walk
with the animals

441
00:31:40,195 --> 00:31:42,129
Talk with the animals

442
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:45,223
Grunt and squeak and squawk
with the animals

443
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:50,805
And they could talk to me

444
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:55,773
If I consulted with quadrupeds

445
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:57,778
Think what fun we'd have

446
00:31:57,846 --> 00:32:00,474
Asking over crocodiles for tea

447
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:02,983
Or maybe lunch
with two or three lions

448
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:04,986
Walruses or sea lions

449
00:32:05,054 --> 00:32:07,716
What a lovely place
the world would be

450
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:30,807
If I spoke slang to orangutans

451
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:35,782
The advantages any fool on Earth
could plainly see

452
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:38,149
Discussing Eastern art and dramas

453
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,450
With intellectual llamas

454
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:43,616
That's a big step forward
You'll agree

455
00:32:43,692 --> 00:32:47,287
I'd learn to speak
in antelope and turtle

456
00:32:47,362 --> 00:32:50,957
My Pekingese would be
extremely good

457
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:54,491
If I were asked
to sing in hippopotamus

458
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,529
I'd say, why not-amus
and would

459
00:32:58,607 --> 00:33:01,269
If I could parley
with pachyderms

460
00:33:01,343 --> 00:33:05,871
It's a fairy tale worthy
of Hans Andersen or Grimm

461
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:08,382
A man who walks
with the animals

462
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,384
Talks with the animals

463
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:14,013
Grunts and squeaks and squawks
with the animals

464
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:16,455
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me, Polynesia.

465
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:18,459
I can't wait to start.

466
00:33:23,665 --> 00:33:26,429
Just the very thing.

467
00:33:26,502 --> 00:33:28,436
For instance, Polynesia,
how would I say...

468
00:33:28,504 --> 00:33:30,438
"good morning"
to our friend there?

469
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:32,440
In pig talk, I mean.

470
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:34,874
That's simple.

471
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:39,843
- Was that it?
- Why, yes.

472
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:43,510
It's remarkable.
What was all the leg-shaking business?

473
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:45,576
That's part of "good morning."

474
00:33:45,654 --> 00:33:48,987
Most animal languages are
a mixture of sounds and movements.

475
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:51,321
A short snort means "good."

476
00:33:51,393 --> 00:33:53,486
Shaking the leg means "morning."

477
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:56,224
And you... And you
just put the two together?

478
00:33:56,298 --> 00:33:58,994
That's right.

479
00:34:11,613 --> 00:34:13,547
Didn't answer me.

480
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:17,051
No, that's your right leg.
That means "good night."

481
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,577
Oh.

482
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:26,154
She answered.
Did you see that? She answered.

483
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:28,753
All I went was...

484
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,027
Did it again.

485
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,830
Good heavens. I speak pig.

486
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:36,837
Where are we going?

487
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:39,738
I want to say good morning
to every animal in Puddleby.

488
00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:28,720
It's incredible.
It's impossible.

489
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,693
But it's true.
A man can talk to the animals

490
00:35:33,762 --> 00:35:38,062
It's a miracle
In a year from now I guarantee

491
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:40,158
I'll be the marvel
of the mammals

492
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:42,169
Playing chess with camels

493
00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:44,432
No more just a boring old M.D.

494
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:48,237
I'll study every living
creature's language

495
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,575
So I can speak
to all of them on sight

496
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:54,946
If friends say
Can he talk in crab or pelican

497
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:57,815
You'll say, like helican
and you'll be right

498
00:35:57,886 --> 00:36:01,117
And if you just stop
to think a bit

499
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:05,182
There's no doubt of it
I shall win a place in history

500
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,286
For I can walk with the animals

501
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:10,297
Talk with the animals

502
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:14,324
Grunt and squeak and squawk
with the animals

503
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:23,538
And they can squeak and squawk

504
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:25,842
And speak and talk

505
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:27,848
To me

506
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:41,521
Needless to say, Stubbins,
I've neither seen nor spoken...

507
00:36:41,596 --> 00:36:44,121
to dear sister, Sarah,
from that day to this.

508
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:48,363
But I do have the consolation of being
able to speak 498 animal languages.

509
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:51,270
Any one of which is more fun
than talking to Sarah.

510
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,274
Four hundred and ninety-eight?

511
00:36:53,342 --> 00:36:55,572
With goldfish, it will be 499.

512
00:36:55,644 --> 00:36:57,874
When you get to 500, Doctor,
we ought to have a party.

513
00:36:57,946 --> 00:36:59,880
We must.

514
00:36:59,948 --> 00:37:04,112
You'll need more than languages
before we can search for
the great pink sea snail.

515
00:37:04,186 --> 00:37:06,416
Voyages cost money, you know.

516
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:08,422
Mm, quite.

517
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,424
Now, gentlemen,
if you'll forgive me,

518
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:12,460
animals are earlier risers
than human beings,

519
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:14,961
and I've got to be up
at 5:30 to open the clinic.

520
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:18,966
Good heavens.
You can't go home in that.

521
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:22,026
Matthew, you can make up a bed here,
if you don't mind Gub-Gub snoring.

522
00:37:22,104 --> 00:37:25,301
Stubbins can sleep
on the sofa in the library.

523
00:37:25,374 --> 00:37:28,707
Polynesia will go over to your house
and tell your parents you're all right.

524
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:30,711
Good night.

525
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:33,111
- Good night.
- Good night.

526
00:37:34,182 --> 00:37:36,116
He's a genius.

527
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:09,883
Uh-hum.

528
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:18,092
I think you're next.

529
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:30,971
What did you tell her?

530
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,304
To take two of these pills
three times a day after meals.

531
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:41,605
Polynesia, remember that lady
owes us a gallon of milk.

532
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:44,379
- All right, Doctor.
- Now, what next?

533
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:46,614
This mouse. He has a bent tail.

534
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:49,384
Oh, it's you again.

535
00:38:52,294 --> 00:38:54,319
Well, that's the third time
this week.

536
00:38:55,564 --> 00:38:57,498
What's that machine?

537
00:38:57,566 --> 00:39:01,024
It's a whisker and tail straightener.
My own invention.

538
00:39:01,102 --> 00:39:04,731
These field mice are always getting
caught in General Bellowes' pantry...

539
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:06,740
up at the Grange.

540
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:10,209
Being a military man, he has
a regular defense system of mousetraps,

541
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:13,111
and they're all having
very narrow escapes, like this one.

542
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:18,177
There we are.
That should do it. Good as new.

543
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:21,952
There.

544
00:39:25,093 --> 00:39:28,494
But, uh, keep away
from General Bellowes' pantry.

545
00:39:28,563 --> 00:39:31,623
Next.

546
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,568
Good morning, Sheila.
On the desk, please, Stubbins.

547
00:39:35,637 --> 00:39:37,571
Yes, sir.

548
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:56,682
- Oh, I see.
- What's the matter?

549
00:39:56,758 --> 00:39:58,885
Apparently one of her children
have got flat feet.

550
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,726
This one? Yes.
Very dangerous in hunting season.

551
00:40:02,797 --> 00:40:06,460
Can't run fast enough.
I'll work out some form of exercise.

552
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:11,735
Bum-bum. Bum-bum.

553
00:40:11,806 --> 00:40:13,774
Bum-bum. Something like that.

554
00:40:13,842 --> 00:40:16,970
Anyhow, we'd better see
our other patients first.

555
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:19,070
I can get on with this later.

556
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:24,551
Good boy, Jip.

557
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:28,555
Uh-oh.

558
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:36,020
Ah, Toggle.

559
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,300
Oh, yes, of course.

560
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:47,170
Toggle's getting a bit
shortsighted in his old age.

561
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:53,477
There now.
We'll just, uh, test these.

562
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,816
Now, I'm sure this will be better
than the last time.

563
00:41:25,914 --> 00:41:29,281
Good Lord. That's excellent.

564
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:31,911
Polynesia, remember
Toggle owes me a free ride...

565
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:34,080
next time I have to go
to Plymouth or Penzance.

566
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:36,089
Yes, Doctor.

567
00:41:36,157 --> 00:41:39,320
What the devil! Emma, I'll
murder him if I lay my hands on him!

568
00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:41,828
- That's Bellowes' voice.
- Damn it! What's the matter?

569
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:44,421
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

570
00:41:44,499 --> 00:41:47,059
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

571
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:51,268
There he is.
We've caught him red-handed.

572
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:53,273
- Emma, you're a witness.
- A witness to what?

573
00:41:53,341 --> 00:41:55,275
The most flagrant display
of organized animal stealing...

574
00:41:55,343 --> 00:41:57,277
in the history
of Puddleby crime.

575
00:41:57,345 --> 00:42:02,044
Organized? I beg...
I am a doctor, sir.

576
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:06,850
You are a horse thief, sir.
That is my plow horse.

577
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:08,855
It's no good
your trying to disguise him.

578
00:42:08,923 --> 00:42:11,414
He's wearing glasses
because he's shortsighted.

579
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:14,155
I'd recognize him anywhere.

580
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:17,960
Take them off. At once, sir.

581
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:21,764
Shortsighted. That won't sound very
convincing in front of the magistrate.

582
00:42:21,836 --> 00:42:23,997
- Magistrate?
- I'm prosecuting,

583
00:42:24,072 --> 00:42:26,302
and I don't fancy
your chances in court.

584
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:29,502
I'm the magistrate,
and if I weren't late for my foxhunt,

585
00:42:29,577 --> 00:42:32,842
I'd report you for cruelty to animals.

586
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,354
Don't you dare lay a finger on her.

587
00:42:40,422 --> 00:42:42,356
- She's one of my patients.
- One of your what?

588
00:42:42,424 --> 00:42:45,222
She's been chased by your wretched
foxhounds three times in two weeks.

589
00:42:45,293 --> 00:42:47,158
You've already murdered her husband.

590
00:42:47,228 --> 00:42:50,527
If anything happened to her,
these babies are going to be orphans.

591
00:42:50,598 --> 00:42:52,725
It's all right, Sheila.
I won't let him hurt you.

592
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:55,565
I've never heard... Sheila?

593
00:42:55,637 --> 00:42:58,367
Just the sight of you is enough
to give her a heart attack.

594
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,704
Look at her.
She's a complete nervous wreck.

595
00:43:00,775 --> 00:43:03,335
She'll be more than that
by the time I'm finished with her!

596
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,947
- You'll never catch her.
- Tallyho!

597
00:43:14,422 --> 00:43:17,755
There are times when the English
are rather tiresome.

598
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:25,758
Bellowes, no!

599
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:29,702
Out of my way!

600
00:43:31,172 --> 00:43:34,471
- Out of my way! Out of my way!
- Oh, well.

601
00:43:38,513 --> 00:43:40,447
"Never catch her," eh?

602
00:43:40,515 --> 00:43:43,416
What do you think this is?

603
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:47,450
My horse!

604
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:02,959
- Where did they come from?
- North America.

605
00:44:03,037 --> 00:44:05,505
We formed an Anglo-American
Fox Protection Society.

606
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:07,507
Purely volunteer, of course.

607
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:15,108
Fox Protection Society?

608
00:44:15,183 --> 00:44:18,209
Yes. During the hunting season,
a skunk will always run with a fox.

609
00:44:18,286 --> 00:44:20,345
The idea is to put
the hounds off the scent.

610
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:22,355
I never dreamt
it would work so well.

611
00:44:22,423 --> 00:44:25,119
- How dare you!
- I beg your pardon?

612
00:44:25,193 --> 00:44:27,127
- General Bellowes...
- He certainly does.

613
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:29,629
- Is my uncle.
- I'm sorry.

614
00:44:29,697 --> 00:44:31,995
- Is that an apology?
- I'm sorry he's your uncle.

615
00:44:32,066 --> 00:44:34,000
And I'm sorry I'm his niece.

616
00:44:34,068 --> 00:44:36,161
- It must be terrible.
- What do you mean?

617
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:38,171
Having a name like Bellowes.

618
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,640
- My name is Emma Fairfax.
- Oh, that's a bit better.

619
00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:45,145
What I meant was that if I were
his nephew instead of his niece...

620
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:47,841
If you were his nephew,
you'd hardly be called Emma Fairfax.

621
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,441
- If I were a man...
- Fred Fairfax?

622
00:44:50,518 --> 00:44:52,611
I have never
in my entire experience...

623
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:56,282
known anyone treat people
as appallingly as you do.

624
00:44:56,357 --> 00:44:58,689
I don't treat people, madam.
I treat animals.

625
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,694
You treat people like animals too.

626
00:45:00,762 --> 00:45:02,992
And I have nothing but contempt
for people whose idea of pleasure...

627
00:45:03,064 --> 00:45:06,465
is to take a defenseless animal and make
a social event out of a ritual killing.

628
00:45:06,534 --> 00:45:09,230
- That's it, John Dolittle. You tell her.
- Matthew, I am telling her.

629
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:11,272
- You make it sound...
- Furthermore...

630
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:14,706
- Don't keep interrupting me!
- I'm sorry. What did you wish to say?

631
00:45:14,776 --> 00:45:16,835
Oh, I've forgotten!

632
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:18,970
Very well. Furthermore, I would deem it
a favor if in the future...

633
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:20,981
you and your
bloodthirsty relatives...

634
00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:22,983
would avoid coming here
and upsetting the animals.

635
00:45:23,051 --> 00:45:26,350
In any case, I find it hard
to believe that a grown man...

636
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:30,221
can waste his entire life
playing with animals in the first place.

637
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:32,350
And I, madam, find it
equally hard to believe...

638
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:35,658
that a grown woman could spend her
entire life doing absolutely nothing.

639
00:45:40,568 --> 00:45:43,401
You got to admit that
for someone called Fred,

640
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:45,841
she's a fair-looking fellow.

641
00:45:52,948 --> 00:45:55,382
If I were a man

642
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:58,283
I'd scratch his eyes out

643
00:45:58,353 --> 00:46:01,117
I'd tear his hair out
by the roots

644
00:46:01,189 --> 00:46:04,181
And kick his shins in
with my boots

645
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:07,592
And I would bite his hand
as only I can

646
00:46:07,662 --> 00:46:11,689
If only I could be a man

647
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:16,527
A great man would not hesitate

648
00:46:16,605 --> 00:46:19,540
To put Dr. Dolittle to death

649
00:46:19,608 --> 00:46:22,372
Attila the Hun
To name only one

650
00:46:22,444 --> 00:46:26,437
Would chuckle at his dying breath

651
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,617
It seems a man can be
as rude as he likes

652
00:46:31,686 --> 00:46:34,086
Crude as he likes
Lewd as he likes too

653
00:46:37,692 --> 00:46:41,287
But a girl must be
discreet as she can

654
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:46,266
Sweet as she can
Neat as she can too

655
00:46:54,809 --> 00:46:57,300
But that's not the life

656
00:46:57,379 --> 00:47:00,007
That I want to lead

657
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:04,950
Normal and formal
as homespun tweed

658
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,320
I need the freedom to go

659
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,882
Where I please

660
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:15,255
But where

661
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,321
Do I please

662
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:20,596
I don't know

663
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:24,469
That's the trouble

664
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:30,444
I don't know

665
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,978
Here I stand
at the crossroads of life

666
00:47:38,053 --> 00:47:40,521
Childhood behind me

667
00:47:40,588 --> 00:47:43,523
The future to come

668
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:48,686
And alone

669
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:58,671
Nothing planned
at the crossroads of life

670
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,004
But life will find me

671
00:48:01,076 --> 00:48:04,068
More grateful than some

672
00:48:06,815 --> 00:48:11,252
It has known

673
00:48:13,154 --> 00:48:16,021
Grateful to see

674
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:21,119
All the wonderful things I see

675
00:48:21,196 --> 00:48:23,892
Grateful to be

676
00:48:23,965 --> 00:48:29,403
What life expects me to be

677
00:48:31,106 --> 00:48:37,477
So I stand
at the crossroads of life

678
00:48:37,545 --> 00:48:39,979
This way or that way

679
00:48:40,048 --> 00:48:44,280
Well, which shall I go

680
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:51,621
Towards the left
or the right

681
00:48:51,693 --> 00:48:55,789
Towards the day
or the night

682
00:48:55,864 --> 00:49:02,167
Towards the dark
or the light

683
00:49:02,237 --> 00:49:07,732
Only my heart can know

684
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:14,248
Only my heart

685
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:22,349
Can know

686
00:49:39,841 --> 00:49:43,902
- What is it?
- Ha. I don't know, Doctor.
It just arrived for ya.

687
00:49:43,978 --> 00:49:46,446
- It's making funny noises.

688
00:49:46,514 --> 00:49:49,449
- Extraordinary-looking thing.
- It's from Tibet.

689
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:51,883
It's probably that pink sea snail
you was lookin' for.

690
00:49:51,953 --> 00:49:53,921
No, it's not big enough for that.

691
00:49:53,988 --> 00:49:55,922
What do you suppose it is?

692
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,924
Well, we could always
open it and find out.

693
00:49:57,992 --> 00:49:59,926
Oh, yes. What a good idea.

694
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:06,500
Ah. Oh, look, it's a llama.

695
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:08,502
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.

696
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:13,030
I think he's nervous. Open up the
other end and give him a push, Matthew.

697
00:50:14,442 --> 00:50:17,843
Here.

698
00:50:17,912 --> 00:50:20,676
There's another one at this end.
There's two of them.

699
00:50:20,748 --> 00:50:23,945
Two llamas? How thoughtful of somebody.
People are awfully nice.

700
00:50:24,018 --> 00:50:26,714
- What are you going to do with them?
- We could make ourselves...

701
00:50:26,788 --> 00:50:28,949
a couple of nice overcoats
for a start.

702
00:50:29,023 --> 00:50:31,992
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.

703
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,221
This way, lad. Come on. Come on.

704
00:50:34,295 --> 00:50:37,628
That's a good fella.

705
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:41,328
I don't believe it. It can't be.

706
00:50:43,037 --> 00:50:45,562
- It is! It is!
- What? What? What?

707
00:50:49,043 --> 00:50:50,977
It's a pushmi-pullyu.

708
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:53,946
- Look.
- Holy O'Reilly. Forgive me.

709
00:50:54,015 --> 00:50:55,949
I'll never touch another drop.

710
00:50:56,017 --> 00:50:58,110
Stubbins, pat the other end.
They're very timid.

711
00:50:58,186 --> 00:51:00,984
This is without doubt the first one
that's ever been captured.

712
00:51:01,055 --> 00:51:03,819
If I had a head at each end,
I'd take a bit of catchin' too.

713
00:51:09,097 --> 00:51:11,725
- What's he saying, Doctor?
- It's rather difficult to understand.

714
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:14,393
It's a camel dialect
with rather a thick accent.

715
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:21,331
- A message? Oh, a message for me.
- Is this it?

716
00:51:21,409 --> 00:51:23,900
Ah, yes, it's from Long Arrow.
I should have guessed.

717
00:51:23,978 --> 00:51:25,912
Who's he when he's at home?

718
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,278
The greatest naturalist in the world
and a very old friend.

719
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:30,408
- He's a Red Indian gentleman.
- With a name like Long Arrow,

720
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:32,419
I didn't think he was Irish.

721
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:34,421
- What's all them drawings, Doctor?
- Picture writing.

722
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:36,423
It's the only way
we can communicate.

723
00:51:36,491 --> 00:51:39,483
You see, this means
the pushmi-pullyu is a gift.

724
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:42,724
The open hand, you see?
For me. That's me.

725
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:45,561
From his friend, Long Arrow.

726
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:47,658
To make money to take a ship...

727
00:51:47,735 --> 00:51:50,795
to search for great pink sea snail.

728
00:51:50,872 --> 00:51:54,364
Signed Long Arrow.

729
00:51:54,442 --> 00:51:56,376
Oh, that's marvelous.

730
00:51:56,444 --> 00:52:00,141
But tell me, Doctor, how do you
make money with a pushmi-pullyu?

731
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:04,083
I thought it was obvious. Stubbins,
what would you do if you had two heads?

732
00:52:04,152 --> 00:52:06,746
- I'd join a circus, sir.
- Exactly.

733
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:13,923
Excuse me. I'm looking
for the proprietor.

734
00:52:13,995 --> 00:52:15,929
You've found him. Albert Blossom.

735
00:52:15,997 --> 00:52:19,228
- Splendid. How do you do?
My name's Dolittle.
- I'm not interested.

736
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,565
- I thought you might like
to see a rather unusual...
- No, I wouldn't.

737
00:52:22,637 --> 00:52:24,867
It's probably something
you haven't seen before.

738
00:52:24,939 --> 00:52:26,998
I've seen everything before.

739
00:52:27,075 --> 00:52:30,067
- Then you aren't interested?
- That's right. I'm not interested.

740
00:52:30,144 --> 00:52:32,078
Come along, Matthew.

741
00:52:34,182 --> 00:52:38,551
- Sorry to have troubled you. Good day.
- Good day.

742
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,854
- It's a trick.
- No, it's no trick.

743
00:52:44,926 --> 00:52:48,862
Why... But... I've never
seen anything like it.

744
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,694
- Neither has anybody else.
- Hey, whoa! I say, come here!
Just a minute.

745
00:52:51,766 --> 00:52:56,169
Hey, hey! I mean,
l-I've never seen anything like it.

746
00:52:56,237 --> 00:52:58,762
I mean, I've seen the world
I've been around

747
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,308
I can tell you stories
that would quite astound you

748
00:53:01,376 --> 00:53:03,310
I'm not a fool
I went to school

749
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:05,312
I've been from
Liverpool to Istanbul

750
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,940
Istanbul, I'm no fool

751
00:53:08,016 --> 00:53:11,713
And anyone will tell you that
I'm sharper than a knife

752
00:53:11,786 --> 00:53:15,119
But I've never seen anything
like it in my life

753
00:53:15,189 --> 00:53:17,123
- It's a pushmi-pullyu.
- Is it?

754
00:53:17,191 --> 00:53:20,820
Well, I've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it

755
00:53:20,895 --> 00:53:23,762
I've never seen anything
like it in my life

756
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:27,631
- It's the rarest animal on Earth.
- It certainly is!

757
00:53:27,702 --> 00:53:29,636
Hey, hold up a moment. Hey!

758
00:53:29,704 --> 00:53:32,070
I mean, I know the game
I've seen them all

759
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,301
I could tell you stories that
would quite enthrall you

760
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:36,400
I know me job
Pleasin' the mob

761
00:53:36,477 --> 00:53:38,741
I give 'em what they want
for just two bob

762
00:53:38,813 --> 00:53:40,872
Just two bob
Well, that's my job

763
00:53:40,948 --> 00:53:45,442
But this is so fantastic
I can't wait to tell the wife

764
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,353
Gertie, you've never seen
anything like it in your life

765
00:53:48,423 --> 00:53:50,357
Come on out!

766
00:53:50,425 --> 00:53:54,088
You've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it

767
00:53:54,162 --> 00:53:57,461
You've never seen anything
like it in your life

768
00:53:57,532 --> 00:54:00,626
It's a bicranium, madam.

769
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:04,900
Arthur! Charlie! Joe!

770
00:54:04,972 --> 00:54:06,906
Come and have a look at this!

771
00:54:06,974 --> 00:54:09,442
Beverly, get Joe!

772
00:54:14,215 --> 00:54:18,481
I thought I'd seen
every wonder in the world

773
00:54:18,553 --> 00:54:22,683
I've seen the Colosseum
in Rome and the Acropolis

774
00:54:22,757 --> 00:54:27,387
I've made the biggest blunder
in the world

775
00:54:27,462 --> 00:54:32,297
'Cause I've never seen
anything quite like this

776
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:34,858
Now look what you've done!
You've frightened him!

777
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:36,995
Hey, come back! Come back!

778
00:54:43,978 --> 00:54:46,139
I'm down to earth
I'll tell you straight

779
00:54:46,214 --> 00:54:48,307
I could tell you stories
that would fascinate you

780
00:54:48,383 --> 00:54:50,317
I know the trade
I know the tricks

781
00:54:50,385 --> 00:54:52,353
I once bought an elephant
for two pound six

782
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,513
Two pound six
Taught it tricks

783
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:58,889
But for your pushmi-pullyu
I'd pay three pounds

784
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,724
Four pounds!

785
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:03,730
Five!

786
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:07,825
'Cause I've never seen anything
like it that's alive

787
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:10,928
I tell you what.
I'd even pay for it in cash.

788
00:55:11,005 --> 00:55:14,441
Five? That wasn't exactly
what we had in mind.

789
00:55:14,509 --> 00:55:18,707
Because, you see, pushmi-pullyus
are remarkable creatures

790
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,340
Of all God's animals
they're the cleverest

791
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:24,874
They develop these remarkable features
running up and down Mount Everest

792
00:55:24,952 --> 00:55:27,682
- No!
- Yes! Absolutely true.

793
00:55:27,755 --> 00:55:30,417
Runnin' up and down
Mount Everest?

794
00:55:30,491 --> 00:55:32,584
Exactly. You see...

795
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,187
Running up and down the mountain
gives them very nimble feet

796
00:55:36,264 --> 00:55:38,698
Put them on the right rope
They could walk a tightrope

797
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:40,734
That should give the audience
a rare old treat

798
00:55:40,802 --> 00:55:44,294
And this extreme agility
begets a rare ability

799
00:55:44,372 --> 00:55:47,899
Shared only with
the mountain goats of France

800
00:55:47,975 --> 00:55:51,968
The pushmi-pullyu loves to dance

801
00:56:27,515 --> 00:56:30,746
I'll give you
anything you want.

802
00:56:30,818 --> 00:56:33,309
- The terms are quite simple.
- Anything you want!

803
00:56:33,387 --> 00:56:35,321
- Four-week engagement.
- Right!

804
00:56:35,389 --> 00:56:37,516
- Share all profits equally.
- Right.

805
00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:39,890
Two performances a day.

806
00:56:39,961 --> 00:56:43,192
Oh, uh, no, uh,
four performances a day.

807
00:56:43,264 --> 00:56:45,198
Just a minute.

808
00:56:51,506 --> 00:56:53,940
We have a problem.

809
00:56:57,678 --> 00:56:59,771
Well, what do they want?

810
00:56:59,847 --> 00:57:02,748
Three shows a day.

811
00:57:02,817 --> 00:57:05,047
And four on Saturday?

812
00:57:07,522 --> 00:57:09,717
They agree.

813
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,348
Done!

814
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:35,608
La, la-la, la

815
00:57:35,683 --> 00:57:37,378
La, la, la, la, la

816
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:55,830
- My dear Dolittle!
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

817
00:58:21,295 --> 00:58:23,763
You've never seen
anything like it!

818
00:58:23,831 --> 00:58:25,765
I've never seen
anything like it.

819
00:58:33,307 --> 00:58:36,401
Dolittle, me.

820
00:58:39,313 --> 00:58:40,644
Thank you.

821
00:58:53,894 --> 00:58:55,828
- Me.
- No, Dolittle.

822
00:59:50,317 --> 00:59:53,150
I mean, you're not a fool

823
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,711
Neither am I

824
00:59:55,790 --> 01:00:00,955
I could tell you stories
that would stultify you

825
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:05,328
Open your eyes
What do you see

826
01:00:05,399 --> 01:00:10,735
This thing's a miracle
for you and me

827
01:00:10,805 --> 01:00:14,002
Guarantee

828
01:00:14,075 --> 01:00:17,010
I agree

829
01:00:17,078 --> 01:00:21,606
Within a meager month
I've seen my wildest dreams come true

830
01:00:21,682 --> 01:00:25,812
'Cause I've never seen anything
like it nor have you

831
01:00:25,886 --> 01:00:30,258
Oh, I've never seen anything like it
Never seen anything like it

832
01:00:30,391 --> 01:00:32,256
I've never seen
anything like it

833
01:00:32,326 --> 01:00:36,695
In all my

834
01:00:36,764 --> 01:00:38,857
Life

835
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:51,176
What's the matter with you, Sophie?

836
01:00:51,245 --> 01:00:54,976
Come on, Sophie. Catch it.

837
01:00:55,049 --> 01:00:58,985
Try again, Sophie.

838
01:01:02,323 --> 01:01:04,655
Come on, Sophie.

839
01:01:04,725 --> 01:01:07,023
- That's yours.
- Oh, thanks.

840
01:01:07,094 --> 01:01:10,427
Right, well,
I'm off to the bank.

841
01:01:10,498 --> 01:01:14,764
Ah, here we are now. "Seals are
notoriously sentimental creatures.

842
01:01:14,835 --> 01:01:17,963
Prolonged separation from
those they love can result...

843
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:20,974
in complete lack of interest
in their usual activities."

844
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:23,977
That would explain why Sophie
keeps dropping things in her act.

845
01:01:24,045 --> 01:01:27,481
It isn't like her.
I'm sure she's pining for some reason.

846
01:01:27,548 --> 01:01:30,711
I must go and have a chat with her.
This fellow obviously knows
what he's talking about.

847
01:01:30,785 --> 01:01:34,551
- Who wrote the book, Doctor?
- Uh, oh, I did.

848
01:01:34,622 --> 01:01:36,681
- Hmm.
- Just a moment!

849
01:01:36,757 --> 01:01:38,850
I have something to say to you,

850
01:01:38,926 --> 01:01:42,020
- Mr. Dolittle.
- Doctor.

851
01:01:42,096 --> 01:01:44,121
Doctor?

852
01:01:44,198 --> 01:01:49,135
I've heard of some hypocrites
in my time, but you are contemptible!

853
01:01:49,203 --> 01:01:53,435
All that sanctimonious claptrap
about protecting defenseless creatures,

854
01:01:53,507 --> 01:01:57,443
and here you are an animal trainer
in a cheap circus!

855
01:01:57,511 --> 01:02:00,002
Exhibiting freaks!

856
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:06,146
Come, lad. Why don't you go
and make some cocoa?

857
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:10,554
- I don't want any cocoa, do you?
- I'd love some, lad. Yes. Off you go.

858
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:12,559
Hello, Fred.

859
01:02:12,627 --> 01:02:15,960
He is... He's very rude.

860
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:20,364
Who, the doctor?
Oh, no, not at all. He's a darlin' man.

861
01:02:20,434 --> 01:02:23,062
Did you hear what
he said about my uncle?

862
01:02:23,137 --> 01:02:28,040
Oh, that, yeah, well,
he's a darlin' man, but he's very rude.

863
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:32,876
Of course, I wouldn't mind so much
except everything he said was true.

864
01:02:32,947 --> 01:02:36,280
You should never believe anybody
who goes around tellin' the truth.

865
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:38,318
They're not to be trusted.

866
01:02:38,386 --> 01:02:43,915
Ya have to do it both ends.
Otherwise it gets jealous.

867
01:02:43,991 --> 01:02:47,654
He was too ashamed to say
anything just now, of course.

868
01:02:47,728 --> 01:02:50,788
- Too nice.
- Nice?

869
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:53,993
He's the kindest man
on God's Earth, Fred.

870
01:02:54,068 --> 01:02:58,198
He understands animals better than you
and me will ever understand anythin'.

871
01:02:58,272 --> 01:03:01,503
Well, I certainly
don't understand him.

872
01:03:01,575 --> 01:03:05,443
Ah, sure, now.
He's one of the beautiful people.

873
01:03:05,513 --> 01:03:08,880
And I'm sure now
he's one of the horrible people.

874
01:03:08,949 --> 01:03:11,144
You're wrong, sweetheart.

875
01:03:11,352 --> 01:03:14,480
I can't explain
what it is that he is

876
01:03:14,555 --> 01:03:19,219
But he is what he is
for a very good reason

877
01:03:19,293 --> 01:03:22,785
I can't explain why he does
what he does

878
01:03:22,863 --> 01:03:27,391
But he does what he does
'cause his heart is pure

879
01:03:27,468 --> 01:03:30,232
Of that much

880
01:03:30,304 --> 01:03:33,603
I am sure

881
01:03:33,674 --> 01:03:37,610
I'm sure as I told
young Tom the other day

882
01:03:37,678 --> 01:03:41,045
He lives in
a world of fantasy

883
01:03:41,115 --> 01:03:45,984
And that is a world
I plan to see, fantasy

884
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:51,454
Can't you see

885
01:03:51,525 --> 01:03:56,292
The world is full
of beautiful things

886
01:03:56,364 --> 01:04:00,300
Butterfly wings
Fairy tale kings

887
01:04:00,368 --> 01:04:04,031
And each new day
undoubtedly brings

888
01:04:04,105 --> 01:04:07,973
Still more beautiful things

889
01:04:10,211 --> 01:04:14,147
The world abounds
with many delights

890
01:04:14,215 --> 01:04:17,707
Magical sights
Fanciful flights

891
01:04:17,785 --> 01:04:21,687
And those who dream
on beautiful nights

892
01:04:21,756 --> 01:04:25,089
Dream of beautiful things

893
01:04:27,228 --> 01:04:30,994
Beautiful days
for sunshine lazin'

894
01:04:31,065 --> 01:04:34,626
Beautiful skies and shores

895
01:04:34,702 --> 01:04:38,604
Beautiful days
when I can gaze

896
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:41,505
In beautiful eyes

897
01:04:41,575 --> 01:04:44,840
Like yours

898
01:05:14,341 --> 01:05:19,870
Our lives tick by
like a pendulum swings

899
01:05:19,947 --> 01:05:23,906
Poor little things
Puppets on strings

900
01:05:23,984 --> 01:05:26,316
But life is full

901
01:05:26,387 --> 01:05:31,188
Of beautiful things

902
01:05:31,258 --> 01:05:33,783
Beautiful people

903
01:05:33,861 --> 01:05:36,591
Too

904
01:05:36,664 --> 01:05:41,533
Beautiful people

905
01:05:41,602 --> 01:05:44,264
Like

906
01:05:44,338 --> 01:05:55,146
You

907
01:06:02,323 --> 01:06:05,986
I see. I see.

908
01:06:09,063 --> 01:06:11,827
I'm sorry. Hmm.

909
01:06:11,899 --> 01:06:14,197
Ah, cocoa.
Come in, gentlemen.

910
01:06:14,268 --> 01:06:17,066
You know Sophie, don't you?
Oh, yes, of course you do.

911
01:06:17,137 --> 01:06:19,469
It seems we have
a problem on our hands.

912
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,974
Sophie's just been telling me
how much she misses her husband.

913
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:25,239
That's why she couldn't concentrate
on her performance, just as I thought.

914
01:06:25,312 --> 01:06:28,406
- Where is her husband?
- The North Pole. That's the problem.

915
01:06:28,482 --> 01:06:31,280
They were on their way there
when Sophie was captured.

916
01:06:31,352 --> 01:06:35,083
If she doesn't get back to him,
she feels she's going to go
completely to pieces.

917
01:06:35,155 --> 01:06:37,851
What do you want us to do?
Go to the North Pole?

918
01:06:37,925 --> 01:06:40,393
Unfortunately, there isn't time,
but it's very pleasant up there.

919
01:06:40,461 --> 01:06:42,656
But the North Pole
hasn't been discovered yet.

920
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:46,723
Not officially.
I'd never say anything about it.
I promised the polar bears I wouldn't.

921
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,995
Anyway, that's beside the point.

922
01:06:49,069 --> 01:06:52,004
What we've got to do is
to get Sophie back to her husband.

923
01:06:52,072 --> 01:06:54,734
Now, if I could get her
to the Bristol Channel,

924
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:57,106
she could swim it
in about a week.

925
01:06:57,177 --> 01:07:02,706
You go along there,
around that bit, then straight on
and then slightly to the left.

926
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:07,015
Oh, that's great, but how does
she get to the Bristol Channel?

927
01:07:07,087 --> 01:07:11,820
- Well, she'd have to escape.
- Escape? A seal?

928
01:07:11,892 --> 01:07:15,885
I can hardly go to Blossom
and say she wanted to go to
the North Pole to see her husband.

929
01:07:15,963 --> 01:07:17,954
He wouldn't believe a word.

930
01:07:18,032 --> 01:07:20,466
- You know something?
- What?

931
01:07:20,534 --> 01:07:24,334
- She's gonna have to escape.
- Tonight.

932
01:08:37,378 --> 01:08:40,313
Shh. Shh.

933
01:09:27,561 --> 01:09:32,692
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's my grandmother.
She's not very well.

934
01:09:32,766 --> 01:09:35,200
I'm taking her to Bristol.

935
01:09:36,837 --> 01:09:39,601
- Can you smell fish?
- Fish?

936
01:09:39,673 --> 01:09:44,269
It's Granny.
She's on a special diet.

937
01:09:44,344 --> 01:09:46,812
Very wise, sir.

938
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:46,369
Are you all right, dear?
Enjoying the trip?

939
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,136
Oh, that's good.

940
01:11:05,192 --> 01:11:08,127
Whoa! Whoa!

941
01:11:10,764 --> 01:11:12,732
What's the delay?
What's going on there?

942
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,600
Jack Fitch, the highwayman,
has been seen on this road.
We have to search all coaches.

943
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:19,935
Help yourself.
You'll find no surprise in here.

944
01:11:39,259 --> 01:11:41,853
All right, driver.

945
01:11:43,764 --> 01:11:45,595
All right, get up.

946
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,930
All right, go on.

947
01:12:33,947 --> 01:12:36,347
Come back here, Nelly!
Nelly, come back here!

948
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:39,476
Where are you going?
Where are you going, Nelly?

949
01:12:39,553 --> 01:12:42,078
Come on back!
Come back here, I tell ya!

950
01:13:08,048 --> 01:13:12,985
Well, here we are. Sorry it was
such an uncomfortable journey,

951
01:13:13,053 --> 01:13:15,988
but it was really the only way.

952
01:13:23,864 --> 01:13:25,991
There, there, there, Sophie.

953
01:13:26,066 --> 01:13:30,469
Don't get upset.
I can't bear females who cry.

954
01:13:30,537 --> 01:13:33,529
Shh. Don't look at me
like that, Sophie,

955
01:13:33,607 --> 01:13:35,905
or I'll get upset too.

956
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:40,106
Dear Sophie, you understand
so much, don't you?

957
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:43,081
When I look in your eyes

958
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:47,484
I see the wisdom of the world
in your eyes

959
01:13:47,554 --> 01:13:52,856
I see the sadness
of a thousand good-byes

960
01:13:52,926 --> 01:13:56,020
When I look in your eyes
Shh, shh.

961
01:13:59,633 --> 01:14:03,000
And it is no surprise

962
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:07,837
To see the softness
of the moon in your eyes

963
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:12,072
The gentle sparkle of
the stars in the skies

964
01:14:12,145 --> 01:14:16,844
When I look in your eyes

965
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:27,754
In your eyes I see
the deepness of the sea

966
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:30,763
I see the deepness

967
01:14:30,831 --> 01:14:36,326
Of the love, the love
I feel you feel for me

968
01:14:43,076 --> 01:14:46,204
Autumn comes, summer dies

969
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:50,875
I see the passing
of the years in your eyes

970
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:55,081
And when we part, there will
be no tears, no good-byes

971
01:14:55,155 --> 01:14:59,785
I'll just look into your eyes

972
01:15:03,897 --> 01:15:07,697
Dear Sophie
Those eyes so wise

973
01:15:07,768 --> 01:15:10,601
So warm, so real

974
01:15:12,072 --> 01:15:15,132
Isn't it a pity
you're a seal

975
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:38,591
Well, she's on her way.

976
01:15:38,665 --> 01:15:43,796
- What did you throw her in for?
- She wanted to go back to her husband.

977
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:49,904
No, you don't understand at all.

978
01:15:49,974 --> 01:15:52,738
She wasn't a woman. She was a seal.

979
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:55,301
- A seal?
- Yes.

980
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,905
Dressed in a bonnet and shawl?

981
01:15:57,982 --> 01:16:02,715
That's right. Yes. I'd sort of borrowed
it from this lady in the tavern.

982
01:16:02,787 --> 01:16:05,449
The bonnet had
a little brown ribbon through...

983
01:16:05,523 --> 01:16:07,684
Never mind about
the brown ribbons.

984
01:16:07,759 --> 01:16:10,853
You then took the seal
to Bristol in a stagecoach...

985
01:16:10,929 --> 01:16:14,956
and upon arrival promptly
threw her over a cliff.

986
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:16,967
Exactly.

987
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:19,469
May one ask why?

988
01:16:19,537 --> 01:16:24,372
Uh, certainly. Um, she wanted to go
to the North Pole to see her husband.

989
01:16:32,617 --> 01:16:35,245
- Her husband?
- Yes.

990
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:38,380
What makes you think this seal
wanted to go to the North Pole?

991
01:16:38,456 --> 01:16:41,653
- Well, she told me.
- She told you?

992
01:16:41,726 --> 01:16:44,024
Yes, we discussed it
in great detail.

993
01:16:44,095 --> 01:16:47,531
Are you in the habit
of talking to animals?

994
01:16:47,598 --> 01:16:50,226
Yes, I am.
I do it all the time.

995
01:16:50,301 --> 01:16:54,567
I thought perhaps you did.

996
01:16:56,874 --> 01:17:01,470
With all due respect to
Your Worship, I think I detect
a note of skepticism in the court.

997
01:17:01,546 --> 01:17:03,844
I would, therefore,
like an opportunity...

998
01:17:03,915 --> 01:17:07,009
to prove the point by talking
to any animal you care to nominate.

999
01:17:14,726 --> 01:17:18,753
Very well then.
My dog Rufus is outside. Bring him in!

1000
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:34,207
Oh, that's very kind of you.
This way, please.

1001
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:49,426
Oh, thank you very much.

1002
01:17:49,494 --> 01:17:52,691
Yes, Rufus will be only too happy
to answer any questions you care to ask.

1003
01:17:58,503 --> 01:18:02,405
Oh, I think we can dispense
with that formality.

1004
01:18:02,473 --> 01:18:05,237
Uh, ask him what I had
for dinner last night.

1005
01:18:05,309 --> 01:18:09,541
Very well.

1006
01:18:12,116 --> 01:18:14,050
Did he?

1007
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,918
Well, really? Did he?

1008
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:20,617
Good Lord. Well, well.

1009
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:22,659
Did he really?

1010
01:18:22,727 --> 01:18:24,661
Well, well, well.

1011
01:18:24,729 --> 01:18:27,061
What did he say?

1012
01:18:27,131 --> 01:18:31,261
I'm grateful that Your Worship
acknowledges the fact
that the dog was talking.

1013
01:18:33,004 --> 01:18:36,496
For dinner last night,
Your Lordship enjoyed the following:

1014
01:18:36,574 --> 01:18:40,601
Two helpings of boiled trout,
four helpings of roast pheasant,

1015
01:18:40,678 --> 01:18:43,613
roast potatoes,
brussels sprouts and gravy,

1016
01:18:43,681 --> 01:18:47,845
Followed by six large portions
of blackberry pie with whipped cream.

1017
01:18:47,919 --> 01:18:52,754
It's not true! I only had
five helpings of blackberry pie!

1018
01:18:55,726 --> 01:18:58,786
Your Lordship also drank
a great deal of wine and brandy...

1019
01:18:58,863 --> 01:19:03,698
and later in the evening sang
noisy songs with your friends
about a woman from Swansea...

1020
01:19:03,768 --> 01:19:06,931
That's enough!

1021
01:19:08,406 --> 01:19:10,465
The court is adjourned
until tomorrow morning,

1022
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:15,376
pending inquiries about
the bonnet and shawl stolen
from the tavern in question.

1023
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:24,352
Hmm. Thank you.

1024
01:19:35,566 --> 01:19:40,799
Well, by my calculation, the trial
will be over by 11:00 tomorrow morning.

1025
01:19:40,872 --> 01:19:43,397
Polynesia, how much did
we earn from the circus?

1026
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:47,570
206 pounds,
seven and fourpence, halfpenny.

1027
01:19:47,645 --> 01:19:49,670
Ah, it's more than enough.

1028
01:19:49,747 --> 01:19:52,841
I see no reason why we shouldn't set out
to find the pink sea snail right away.

1029
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:55,147
Matthew, go to the house
and pick up my clothes.

1030
01:19:55,219 --> 01:19:57,153
Have the boat
ready to sail by 12:00.

1031
01:19:57,221 --> 01:20:00,349
We'll catch the noontide
or whatever it's called.

1032
01:20:00,424 --> 01:20:04,224
We haven't got a crew,
so we'll have to make due with you
and Stubbins and the animals.

1033
01:20:04,295 --> 01:20:06,229
I can come too?

1034
01:20:06,297 --> 01:20:08,424
If your parents say so
and you know how to tie a knot.

1035
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:11,263
Hear that? We're going to help
the doctor find the pink sea snail.

1036
01:20:11,335 --> 01:20:15,669
I should wait until you see
his boat before you get too excited.

1037
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:18,538
It isn't by chance
it's called the Flounder.

1038
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:21,373
No sailor in his right mind
would touch it.

1039
01:20:21,445 --> 01:20:24,380
I'm not asking a sailor
in his right mind. I was asking you.

1040
01:20:25,683 --> 01:20:28,015
What do you say?

1041
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,689
I say that for a man who's
about to be hanged for murder...

1042
01:20:32,757 --> 01:20:37,694
to be gettin' ready to go on a pleasure
cruise shows a very nice outlook.

1043
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:47,232
- Fred!
- To what do we owe this, uh, pleasure?

1044
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:49,364
- I've brought dinner.
- Dinner?

1045
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,399
- Yes, for Matthew and Tommy.
- Oh.

1046
01:20:53,477 --> 01:20:55,536
Set it down there, Hubert.

1047
01:20:55,613 --> 01:21:00,243
Steak and kidney pie
and oxtail and roast beef.

1048
01:21:03,087 --> 01:21:05,783
- Would you like some?
- Uh, no.

1049
01:21:05,856 --> 01:21:09,917
Oh, come on, Doctor.
Ya haven't had a bite all day.

1050
01:21:09,994 --> 01:21:14,124
- No, thank you.
- He's a vegetarian.

1051
01:21:14,198 --> 01:21:16,428
Oh, no!

1052
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,697
It, uh, seems
a pity to waste it.

1053
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:22,933
It's all right, Matthew.
Um, carry on.

1054
01:21:23,007 --> 01:21:26,340
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Come on, Tom.

1055
01:21:27,545 --> 01:21:29,513
Doctor?

1056
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:36,747
Um, Rufus was right.

1057
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:44,090
He did have six helpings
of blackberry pie.

1058
01:21:45,396 --> 01:21:48,957
Thank you.

1059
01:21:49,033 --> 01:21:51,934
Oh, thank you, Chee-Chee.

1060
01:21:57,842 --> 01:22:01,005
It seems that a bonnet and shawl
were, in fact, removed...

1061
01:22:01,078 --> 01:22:03,638
from the tavern in question
on the day in question.

1062
01:22:03,714 --> 01:22:08,083
The lady who owns them,
for reasons best known to herself,
has no wish to prosecute.

1063
01:22:08,152 --> 01:22:11,986
You are, therefore, acquitted
of the charge of murder.

1064
01:22:18,429 --> 01:22:21,956
Thank you very much.

1065
01:22:22,033 --> 01:22:24,194
However,

1066
01:22:26,037 --> 01:22:29,029
your performance in this courtroom
in the past two days...

1067
01:22:29,106 --> 01:22:32,269
has left little doubt in the minds of my
distinguished colleagues and myself...

1068
01:22:32,343 --> 01:22:36,939
that your lunatic activities
with animals infringe
upon the public safety...

1069
01:22:37,014 --> 01:22:39,847
and are not to be tolerated.

1070
01:22:39,917 --> 01:22:45,048
Happily, Her Majesty's farseeing
benevolence provides a sanctuary
for sad people like you...

1071
01:22:45,122 --> 01:22:49,718
who think they can talk to animals and
want to treat them like human beings.

1072
01:22:49,794 --> 01:22:52,194
Therefore, it is
the judgment of this court...

1073
01:22:52,263 --> 01:22:56,359
that you be committed indefinitely
to an asylum for the insane.

1074
01:23:03,374 --> 01:23:05,672
Have you anything to say?

1075
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,948
I do not understand
the human race

1076
01:23:13,017 --> 01:23:15,850
It has so little love
for creatures

1077
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,150
With a different face

1078
01:23:18,222 --> 01:23:23,023
Treating animals like people
is no madness or disgrace

1079
01:23:23,094 --> 01:23:27,030
I do not understand
the human race

1080
01:23:27,098 --> 01:23:32,365
I wonder why do we treat
animals like animals

1081
01:23:32,436 --> 01:23:35,599
Animals treat us so very well

1082
01:23:35,673 --> 01:23:38,972
The devoted way they serve us
and protect us when we're nervous

1083
01:23:39,043 --> 01:23:41,477
Oh, they really don't deserve us

1084
01:23:41,545 --> 01:23:44,673
All we give them is hell

1085
01:23:44,749 --> 01:23:47,240
Tell me how else
man repays them

1086
01:23:47,318 --> 01:23:49,718
Do we ever think to
praise them, no, we don't

1087
01:23:49,787 --> 01:23:52,620
And this dismays them
You can tell

1088
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:56,626
We are riddled with ingratitude
We give no love or latitude

1089
01:23:56,694 --> 01:24:01,063
In every way our attitude is
well, like animals

1090
01:24:01,132 --> 01:24:06,263
No, no. That's not
what I mean. I mean...

1091
01:24:06,337 --> 01:24:09,829
Why do we treat animals
like animals

1092
01:24:09,907 --> 01:24:13,104
How can people
be so inhumane

1093
01:24:13,177 --> 01:24:15,145
Cows and chickens
work to feed us

1094
01:24:15,212 --> 01:24:17,510
Dogs and horses
show they need us

1095
01:24:17,581 --> 01:24:22,450
And though cats don't always heed us
their affection is plain

1096
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:25,921
What do we do, we neglect them
We do nothing to protect them

1097
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:29,756
We reject them
Don't expect them to complain

1098
01:24:29,827 --> 01:24:33,263
We ignore them or we beat them
When we're hungry then we eat them

1099
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:36,299
It's appalling how
we treat them, it's insane

1100
01:24:36,367 --> 01:24:38,858
Like animals

1101
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:46,035
We humiliate and murder
and confine them

1102
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:49,136
We create their wretched status

1103
01:24:49,213 --> 01:24:53,206
Then we use it to malign them

1104
01:24:53,284 --> 01:24:57,744
I mean, why should we say
Treat him like a dog

1105
01:24:57,822 --> 01:25:01,349
Why should we say
Working like a horse

1106
01:25:01,425 --> 01:25:03,791
Why should we say
Eating like a hog

1107
01:25:03,861 --> 01:25:06,659
When what we mean is
Eating like a man

1108
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:10,393
Don't we, of course

1109
01:25:10,468 --> 01:25:14,996
A man of ill repute
is called a weasel or a rat

1110
01:25:15,072 --> 01:25:18,940
A woman you dislike
becomes a vixen or a cat

1111
01:25:19,009 --> 01:25:22,740
A family that is blessed with
healthy reproductive habits

1112
01:25:22,813 --> 01:25:27,716
Occasions the remark, well, you know
them, they breed like rabbits

1113
01:25:27,785 --> 01:25:30,447
He's as stubborn as a mule
He's as stupid as an ox

1114
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:33,547
He's as slimy as a snake
He's as crafty as a fox

1115
01:25:34,992 --> 01:25:38,484
Remarks like that
really get my goat

1116
01:25:38,562 --> 01:25:43,261
Why don't we say
Noble as a frog

1117
01:25:43,334 --> 01:25:46,963
Or why can't we say
Wealthy as a hen

1118
01:25:48,806 --> 01:25:51,036
True, we say
Devoted as a dog

1119
01:25:51,108 --> 01:25:54,441
What we should say is
Chic as a giraffe

1120
01:25:54,512 --> 01:25:58,209
Pretty as a pig, eh
That will be the big day, won't it

1121
01:25:58,282 --> 01:26:01,911
But when, but when

1122
01:26:01,986 --> 01:26:07,014
But when, when will we stop
treating them like animals

1123
01:26:07,091 --> 01:26:09,582
Is the human race
entirely mad

1124
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:13,926
Women see a baby goatskin
or a lambskin or a stoatskin

1125
01:26:13,998 --> 01:26:17,661
And to them it's just a coatskin
Oh, it's terribly sad

1126
01:26:19,436 --> 01:26:23,065
When you dress in suede or leather
or some fancy fur or feather

1127
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,870
Do you stop and wonder
whether for a fad

1128
01:26:25,943 --> 01:26:29,674
You have killed
some beast or other

1129
01:26:29,747 --> 01:26:33,478
That you're wearing
someone's brother

1130
01:26:33,551 --> 01:26:38,113
Or perhaps it's someone's mother
in which you're clad

1131
01:26:38,188 --> 01:26:40,486
Like animals

1132
01:26:40,558 --> 01:26:42,958
Like animals

1133
01:26:43,027 --> 01:26:45,188
Like animals

1134
01:26:50,167 --> 01:26:52,829
Well, it's true

1135
01:26:52,903 --> 01:26:56,805
We do not live in a zoo

1136
01:26:56,874 --> 01:27:00,810
But man is an animal too

1137
01:27:01,979 --> 01:27:04,675
So why can't you

1138
01:27:04,748 --> 01:27:07,046
Like me

1139
01:27:07,117 --> 01:27:10,314
Like animals

1140
01:27:11,755 --> 01:27:13,950
Animals

1141
01:30:04,943 --> 01:30:08,174
Now, the prison faces the road here.

1142
01:30:08,247 --> 01:30:12,775
So what we do is we tie the ropes from
the bars of the cell to the elephant,

1143
01:30:12,851 --> 01:30:15,046
and he pulls the whole wall off.

1144
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,384
How can you go on the voyage
if the doctor's still in prison?

1145
01:30:17,456 --> 01:30:21,153
We can't. That's why Matthew's got
this marvelous plan to get him out.

1146
01:30:21,226 --> 01:30:23,820
Then this second elephant...
he's bigger than the first elephant...

1147
01:30:23,896 --> 01:30:27,855
All the doctor has to do is step through
the hole in the wall onto his back.

1148
01:30:27,933 --> 01:30:31,369
- You'll never get away with this.
- Listen, here's the clever part.

1149
01:30:31,437 --> 01:30:35,669
He slides down the elephant's trunk onto
a waitin' rhinoceros and away they go!

1150
01:30:35,741 --> 01:30:38,175
Just the three of you
are going off on this boat?

1151
01:30:38,243 --> 01:30:41,007
Oh, no. Chee-Chee, Polynesia
and Jip are coming too.

1152
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:44,048
Then there's these six tigers,
you see, to stop anyone followin'.

1153
01:30:44,116 --> 01:30:46,050
To look for a pink sea snail?

1154
01:30:46,118 --> 01:30:48,916
They'll be standing on
the other side of the road
while I'm settin' off the dynamite.

1155
01:30:48,987 --> 01:30:51,717
- Dynamite?
- Oh, sure.

1156
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:56,625
If we blow up the road,
they'll have to go all the way
around the town to get to the harbor,

1157
01:30:56,695 --> 01:30:59,562
which gives me time
to nip back here...

1158
01:30:59,631 --> 01:31:03,158
and blow up the bridge while
you're gettin' on the boat.

1159
01:31:03,235 --> 01:31:07,103
That's the beauty of this whole plan...
its simplicity.

1160
01:31:07,172 --> 01:31:10,573
- Are they really going to
keep the doctor in prison?
- Oh, no, no.

1161
01:31:10,642 --> 01:31:13,509
They're moving him across
to the loony bin at 12:00.

1162
01:31:13,579 --> 01:31:15,513
- Today?
- Aye.

1163
01:31:15,581 --> 01:31:18,345
I've also an idea.
You get the boat ready.

1164
01:31:18,417 --> 01:31:21,716
Leave the doctor to me.
We sail at 12:00. Avast now.

1165
01:31:21,787 --> 01:31:25,223
Aye, aye, sir.

1166
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:29,886
We're a fine bunch,
takin' orders from a parrot.

1167
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:44,106
Matthew, how did you enjoy
the food I brought you
in the prison the other night?

1168
01:31:44,176 --> 01:31:46,974
'Twas the best meal
I ever had in me life.

1169
01:31:47,045 --> 01:31:50,378
They say that prison food is terrible.
I won't hear a word against it.

1170
01:31:50,449 --> 01:31:52,383
I was thinking.

1171
01:31:52,451 --> 01:31:56,820
Wouldn't it be nice if you were to have
those kind of meals on your voyage?

1172
01:31:56,889 --> 01:31:58,823
Oh, true now.
It would be marvelous.

1173
01:31:58,891 --> 01:32:03,624
The only way we could do that
is if you was to...

1174
01:32:03,695 --> 01:32:06,664
If we was to, uh...

1175
01:32:09,902 --> 01:32:12,871
Ah!

1176
01:32:16,141 --> 01:32:18,735
I'll tell you one thing, Fred.

1177
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:21,608
I only hope there's
no stowaways on that boat.

1178
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:26,413
Because if there was,
I wouldn't know where to look for them.

1179
01:32:26,485 --> 01:32:31,752
Anyway, once we're out at sea
with an escaped convict,
there's no turnin' back.

1180
01:32:31,823 --> 01:32:34,291
Oh, Matthew!

1181
01:32:34,359 --> 01:32:36,827
I love you!

1182
01:32:45,871 --> 01:32:48,465
Who would have thought
that one little kiss

1183
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:53,477
Soft and sweet from
the lips of a lovely girl

1184
01:32:53,545 --> 01:32:58,312
Would to change my life

1185
01:32:58,383 --> 01:33:02,615
But by my life

1186
01:33:02,688 --> 01:33:07,318
It will

1187
01:33:08,894 --> 01:33:14,355
After today nothing
will be the same again

1188
01:33:14,433 --> 01:33:20,065
After today I'll make
my claim to fame and then

1189
01:33:20,138 --> 01:33:23,437
The grass will be greener

1190
01:33:23,508 --> 01:33:26,341
And the air will be cleaner

1191
01:33:26,411 --> 01:33:29,676
And my life be serener

1192
01:33:29,748 --> 01:33:32,945
Than heaven knows when

1193
01:33:33,018 --> 01:33:35,987
Heaven knows when

1194
01:33:36,054 --> 01:33:41,492
After today I shall have
bid my fears good-bye

1195
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:45,860
After today I shall
have no more tears

1196
01:33:45,931 --> 01:33:48,092
To cry

1197
01:33:48,166 --> 01:33:53,866
I'll learn to live
with laughter to stay

1198
01:33:53,939 --> 01:33:56,806
After

1199
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:59,343
Today

1200
01:34:01,546 --> 01:34:06,848
After today nothing
will be the way it was

1201
01:34:06,918 --> 01:34:12,220
After today I'll say
Oh, what a day it was

1202
01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:15,054
My heart will be lighter

1203
01:34:15,127 --> 01:34:17,857
And my smile
will be brighter

1204
01:34:17,929 --> 01:34:20,921
And I'll be
twice the fighter

1205
01:34:20,999 --> 01:34:24,162
That ever I was

1206
01:34:24,236 --> 01:34:27,034
Clever because

1207
01:34:27,105 --> 01:34:32,543
After today I shall have
bid my fears farewell

1208
01:34:32,611 --> 01:34:36,570
After today I shall
have no more tears

1209
01:34:36,648 --> 01:34:38,707
To quell

1210
01:34:38,784 --> 01:34:42,584
I'll learn to live
with laughter

1211
01:34:42,654 --> 01:34:44,645
To stay

1212
01:34:44,723 --> 01:34:49,057
After the tears
comes the laughter

1213
01:34:49,127 --> 01:34:57,296
After today

1214
01:35:58,230 --> 01:36:01,028
Chee-Chee.

1215
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:13,374
Run! Run!

1216
01:36:13,445 --> 01:36:14,969
Stop!

1217
01:36:15,046 --> 01:36:18,914
Don't follow the doctor!

1218
01:36:18,984 --> 01:36:23,182
Don't obey! Don't obey!

1219
01:36:23,255 --> 01:36:27,089
Right!

1220
01:36:32,964 --> 01:36:37,401
Come on! This way!
Don't sit down!

1221
01:36:37,469 --> 01:36:40,165
- Get up!
- After them!

1222
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:42,331
Go after him!

1223
01:36:42,407 --> 01:36:46,343
This way. Come on. After him. This way.

1224
01:36:46,411 --> 01:36:50,370
- This way! No, this way!
- Ta-ta.

1225
01:36:50,448 --> 01:36:53,679
- Stop them!
- Stop them! Stop them!

1226
01:37:23,348 --> 01:37:26,215
It's all right, Doctor.
You can come out now.

1227
01:37:26,284 --> 01:37:29,583
- There's not a policeman in sight.
- Oh, thank you, Matthew.

1228
01:37:29,654 --> 01:37:33,488
Makes a very good little reading room,
this. I must use it more often.

1229
01:37:35,393 --> 01:37:38,328
Now, let's see where we are.

1230
01:37:44,669 --> 01:37:47,467
Ah, I see.

1231
01:37:47,539 --> 01:37:51,134
He says there's a faint smell of garlic
coming from the southeast.

1232
01:37:51,209 --> 01:37:55,805
- What does that mean?
- It means we're about ten miles
off the coast of France.

1233
01:37:55,881 --> 01:37:59,817
I've got about the best navigational
system on the high seas today.

1234
01:37:59,885 --> 01:38:02,376
Jip's got this
incredible sense of smell,

1235
01:38:02,454 --> 01:38:05,617
and Polynesia gets
marvelous weather reports
from the passing birds and fishes.

1236
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:09,217
- Everything all right at the house?
- Yes, Doctor.

1237
01:38:09,294 --> 01:38:13,230
Good. Keep an eye on everything and
don't bump into anything like Ireland.

1238
01:38:13,298 --> 01:38:15,232
Aye, aye, Doctor.

1239
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:17,427
- A very well organized escape.
Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1240
01:38:17,502 --> 01:38:19,766
I doubt if there's a ship afloat
with flowers like these.

1241
01:38:19,838 --> 01:38:22,238
Look at these geraniums.
Absolutely glorious.

1242
01:38:22,307 --> 01:38:25,037
Have you seen my azaleas
on the starboard side?

1243
01:38:25,110 --> 01:38:28,477
- No, sir, I can't say as I have.
- They're doing wonderfully.

1244
01:38:28,546 --> 01:38:31,640
How are you enjoying life
on the rolling deep?

1245
01:38:31,716 --> 01:38:35,311
If the good Lord meant us to take
to water, He'd have given us flippers.

1246
01:38:37,389 --> 01:38:39,949
No, Stubbins,
move your mouth about more.

1247
01:38:40,025 --> 01:38:43,483
You must reread my essay
on basic chimpanzee, page one.

1248
01:38:43,561 --> 01:38:47,429
I must cut these roses back.
There's so much to do on a ship.

1249
01:38:47,499 --> 01:38:50,935
What a marvelous smell, Matthew.

1250
01:38:51,002 --> 01:38:53,800
What have you been cooking?
I'm absolutely starving.

1251
01:38:53,872 --> 01:38:56,670
Will this do?

1252
01:39:03,281 --> 01:39:06,182
Do come on while it's still hot.

1253
01:39:12,991 --> 01:39:15,186
What are you doing here?

1254
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:19,424
I thought someone capable ought
to look after Tommy on the voyage.

1255
01:39:19,497 --> 01:39:22,398
Stubbins is perfectly capable
of looking after himself.

1256
01:39:22,467 --> 01:39:25,561
I must turn the ship around
and go straight back to Puddleby...

1257
01:39:25,637 --> 01:39:28,731
uh, well, immediately after lunch.

1258
01:39:31,142 --> 01:39:35,977
They'll, uh... They'll put ya
inside if you go back, Doctor.

1259
01:39:36,047 --> 01:39:38,538
Oh, yes, that is a point.

1260
01:39:38,616 --> 01:39:41,278
What are we going to do
with her if she stays?

1261
01:39:41,353 --> 01:39:43,480
You make me
sound like a stray cat.

1262
01:39:43,555 --> 01:39:45,420
A cat would be most welcome.

1263
01:39:47,692 --> 01:39:50,354
Don't worry. It's vegetarian.

1264
01:39:50,428 --> 01:39:53,625
- It's delicious.
- It's marvelous.

1265
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:57,827
Mmm. What is it?

1266
01:39:57,902 --> 01:40:01,303
- Algue marine en croute.
- Oh, yes.

1267
01:40:01,373 --> 01:40:04,137
- What's that in English?
- Seaweed pie.

1268
01:40:05,677 --> 01:40:07,838
Mmm! It's really rather good.

1269
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:16,077
- Well, where are we going?
- To hunt for the great pink sea snail.

1270
01:40:16,154 --> 01:40:18,145
And where do you
expect to find it?

1271
01:40:18,223 --> 01:40:20,589
I haven't the faintest idea.

1272
01:40:20,658 --> 01:40:23,923
But as one place is as good as another,
it's high time we decided.

1273
01:40:23,995 --> 01:40:27,522
- Otherwise, when we get there,
we won't know we've arrived.
- Good thinking.

1274
01:40:27,599 --> 01:40:31,831
- Thank you.
- Are your voyages always
as well planned as this?

1275
01:40:31,903 --> 01:40:36,363
When possible. Unfortunately,
one doesn't always have time
to go into minute details.

1276
01:40:36,441 --> 01:40:39,342
- Such as knowing where you're going?
- That sort of thing.

1277
01:40:39,411 --> 01:40:42,278
But then how do you decide?

1278
01:40:42,347 --> 01:40:45,646
We play a little game I invented.

1279
01:40:45,717 --> 01:40:49,517
One of us opens the atlas at random,
sticks a pin in the open page.

1280
01:40:49,587 --> 01:40:51,612
Wherever it lands,
that's where we go.

1281
01:40:51,689 --> 01:40:54,214
- You can't be serious.
- I'm very serious.

1282
01:40:54,292 --> 01:40:58,228
That is the most ridiculous thing
I have ever heard of.

1283
01:40:58,296 --> 01:41:01,231
You could end up in
all sorts of terrible places.

1284
01:41:01,299 --> 01:41:03,233
That's absolutely true.

1285
01:41:03,301 --> 01:41:06,429
I remember going to the Sahara Desert
four times in succession...

1286
01:41:06,504 --> 01:41:10,440
before I realized Chee-Chee
had stuck down all the other pages
of the atlas with jam.

1287
01:41:10,508 --> 01:41:12,669
Marvelous trips. Lots of sand.

1288
01:41:12,744 --> 01:41:15,542
But that is exactly what I mean.

1289
01:41:15,613 --> 01:41:19,750
It's all right now. I cleaned
all the jam off. Little bit there.

1290
01:41:21,718 --> 01:41:27,281
How you can sit there and say what
you're saying I just don't know.

1291
01:41:27,357 --> 01:41:32,989
I must admit the Sahara is one place
I'm praying we just won't go.

1292
01:41:34,264 --> 01:41:38,200
You know, that's absolutely
typical of a woman.

1293
01:41:38,268 --> 01:41:43,934
There are so many fabulous
faraway places to see

1294
01:41:44,007 --> 01:41:46,407
She makes one seaweed pie
and goes mad.

1295
01:41:46,476 --> 01:41:51,072
Such as Mexico, Sweden
Hawaii, Japan and Capri

1296
01:41:51,148 --> 01:41:52,877
Who does she think she is?

1297
01:41:52,949 --> 01:41:56,817
There's so many exciting
and wonderful places

1298
01:41:56,887 --> 01:42:00,084
Much more inviting
than desert oases

1299
01:42:00,157 --> 01:42:03,126
Pleasant as home is
it isn't what Rome is

1300
01:42:03,193 --> 01:42:06,026
So why stay there

1301
01:42:06,096 --> 01:42:10,726
When there are so many fabulous
faraway places to see

1302
01:42:10,801 --> 01:42:13,269
As though the seaweed pie
was all that marvelous.

1303
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:15,736
Why should Spain
and Tahiti and Rio

1304
01:42:15,806 --> 01:42:19,799
- Just be only names to you and me
- Is there any more?

1305
01:42:19,876 --> 01:42:23,710
I feel certain there are people
we'd be glad to know there

1306
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:27,113
So tell me why don't
we get up and go there

1307
01:42:27,184 --> 01:42:33,589
Go to those fabulous places
where we long to be

1308
01:42:33,657 --> 01:42:37,320
Go to Bangkok and Hong Kong
and Paris and Venice

1309
01:42:37,394 --> 01:42:40,659
Tokyo and Cairo
and Lisbon and London

1310
01:42:40,730 --> 01:42:44,723
Wonderful, fabulous places

1311
01:42:44,801 --> 01:42:49,261
We're longing to see

1312
01:42:54,344 --> 01:42:57,177
When I think of
the warm Caribbean

1313
01:42:57,247 --> 01:43:01,081
I see a new world
for you and me

1314
01:43:01,151 --> 01:43:04,746
I'd give anything just to
have one single day there

1315
01:43:04,821 --> 01:43:07,881
Once we get there
I know that we'll stay there

1316
01:43:07,958 --> 01:43:13,362
Stay in those fabulous places
where we long to be

1317
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:15,523
-  Such as Siam
-  Sienna

1318
01:43:15,599 --> 01:43:17,567
-  Vienna
-  Verona

1319
01:43:17,634 --> 01:43:19,568
- Java, Jamaica
- Jamaica, Bombay

1320
01:43:19,636 --> 01:43:22,764
-  Barcelona
- Ole!

1321
01:43:22,839 --> 01:43:24,773
- Ole! Ole! Ole!
- El toro!

1322
01:43:24,841 --> 01:43:27,332
- Ha, ha!
- Ole! Ole! Ole!

1323
01:43:30,413 --> 01:43:33,746
Show me those fabulous places

1324
01:43:33,817 --> 01:43:37,014
I'm longing to see

1325
01:43:37,087 --> 01:43:41,114
My dear Miss Fairfax, you seem
to have entirely missed the point.

1326
01:43:41,191 --> 01:43:44,786
I'm aware there are fabulous places
wherever we sail

1327
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:46,829
- Will we see them?
- We will.

1328
01:43:46,897 --> 01:43:51,027
But the point of the journey
is science and finding the snail

1329
01:43:51,101 --> 01:43:53,729
An incomparable thrill

1330
01:43:53,803 --> 01:43:56,567
We shall question the sharks
off the coast of Tobago

1331
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:59,131
Interview swamp life
in Tierra del Fuego

1332
01:43:59,209 --> 01:44:04,841
-  That sounds horrendous
-  No, no, it's tremendous
and well worthwhile

1333
01:44:04,915 --> 01:44:08,817
We'll make detailed inquiries
of every crustacean we meet

1334
01:44:08,885 --> 01:44:11,376
- Crustacean?
-  Shellfish, they're sweet

1335
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:13,888
We will sail
to the ends of the earth

1336
01:44:13,957 --> 01:44:17,358
Till our search for the snail
is quite complete

1337
01:44:17,427 --> 01:44:20,726
We'll interrogate beetles
and bugs in Nigeria

1338
01:44:20,797 --> 01:44:23,561
And if we have to
spend weeks in Siberia

1339
01:44:23,633 --> 01:44:26,830
Eighty below but a place
that we all ought to see

1340
01:44:26,903 --> 01:44:29,736
But I haven't brought
the right clothes for Siberia

1341
01:44:29,806 --> 01:44:32,707
Those are the fabulous places
you'll visit with me

1342
01:44:32,776 --> 01:44:34,744
Sounds as if we're in
for a good time.

1343
01:44:34,811 --> 01:44:38,178
Well, Siberia is one place
you'll never see me go

1344
01:44:38,248 --> 01:44:40,910
Stick in the pin
Where the pins goes, then we go

1345
01:44:40,984 --> 01:44:43,748
- Ireland!
- Romania!
- No, Ruritania!

1346
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:46,618
We'll chase that sea snail
from here to Tasmania

1347
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:49,955
Show me those fabulous places

1348
01:44:50,026 --> 01:44:52,796
I'm longing to

1349
01:44:52,796 --> 01:44:53,854
I'm longing to

1350
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:58,492
See

1351
01:45:01,971 --> 01:45:04,906
It doesn't count.
You landed in the sea.

1352
01:45:04,974 --> 01:45:07,738
No, she hasn't. Look. There.

1353
01:45:11,547 --> 01:45:14,516
Well, that doesn't
look very interesting.

1354
01:45:14,584 --> 01:45:18,748
- What is it?
- "Sea Star Island.

1355
01:45:18,821 --> 01:45:21,346
Last reported position."

1356
01:45:21,424 --> 01:45:25,861
Last reported position?
What can that mean?

1357
01:45:25,928 --> 01:45:31,389
The Sea Star Island. That's faintly
familiar. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1358
01:45:31,467 --> 01:45:34,698
"Seashore, sea slug, sea snail.

1359
01:45:34,771 --> 01:45:37,569
Sea Star Island."

1360
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:41,167
It's that floating island.
It moves all over the world like a ship.

1361
01:45:41,244 --> 01:45:43,178
It's a freak of nature.

1362
01:45:43,246 --> 01:45:48,183
This time of year it's sometimes
sighted off the coast of Africa.

1363
01:45:48,251 --> 01:45:53,018
How terribly exciting.
I think you have chosen rather well.

1364
01:45:53,089 --> 01:45:55,580
I don't think
it's exciting at all.

1365
01:45:55,658 --> 01:45:59,253
Couldn't we go to...
Couldn't we go to Monte Carlo?

1366
01:45:59,328 --> 01:46:04,265
Miss Fairfax, this is a serious
zoogeographical expedition.

1367
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:07,200
It's not a pleasure cruise
for your personal benefit.

1368
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:10,831
I promise to ask for
no special privileges.

1369
01:46:10,907 --> 01:46:13,375
I promise to grant none.
A ship is no place for a woman.

1370
01:46:13,443 --> 01:46:16,776
The simple answer then
is to treat me like a man.

1371
01:46:16,846 --> 01:46:18,837
I intend to.

1372
01:46:29,392 --> 01:46:31,792
Well, good-bye.

1373
01:48:31,147 --> 01:48:34,344
Twelve.

1374
01:48:34,417 --> 01:48:38,183
Uh-huh. How is the score, Stubbins?
And the arithmetic?

1375
01:48:38,254 --> 01:48:40,188
You're winning, sir, I think.

1376
01:48:42,825 --> 01:48:46,420
Ah, well, that's the first sure sign
we've been at sea too long.

1377
01:48:46,495 --> 01:48:49,020
Polynesia spoke to some swallows.

1378
01:48:49,098 --> 01:48:52,499
They said there's a terrific storm
up ahead. Isn't that marvelous?

1379
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:56,026
No, it isn't.
Can't we drive round it?

1380
01:48:56,105 --> 01:48:59,802
I shouldn't think so.
The latest long-range fish forecast
wasn't too encouraging.

1381
01:48:59,875 --> 01:49:02,105
Jip said he could smell thunder.

1382
01:49:02,178 --> 01:49:05,079
- I didn't know thunder had a smell.
- It does if you're a dog.

1383
01:49:05,147 --> 01:49:09,243
Uh, 82. Mind you,
Jip does tend to exaggerate.

1384
01:49:09,318 --> 01:49:14,017
If you ask me, bein' at sea is
very much the same as bein' in prison,

1385
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:17,651
except at sea ya stand
a better chance of drownin'.

1386
01:49:17,727 --> 01:49:21,185
That reminds me. One of the ship's rats
came to see me this afternoon.

1387
01:49:21,263 --> 01:49:24,790
Said he had
a distinct tingle in his tail,
a sure sign the ship was going down.

1388
01:49:24,867 --> 01:49:28,826
So his lot are preparing to leave,
according to rat tradition.

1389
01:49:28,904 --> 01:49:30,895
He highly recommended
we should do the same.

1390
01:49:30,973 --> 01:49:32,497
There's nowhere we can go.

1391
01:49:32,575 --> 01:49:36,534
- Exactly. That's what I told the rat.
- Two.

1392
01:49:40,883 --> 01:49:45,149
- What was that?
- A bit of lightning. That's all.

1393
01:49:45,221 --> 01:49:48,156
When you finish clearing up, you better
batten down the hatches and stay below.

1394
01:49:48,224 --> 01:49:51,091
Women are always
scared stiff of storms.

1395
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:55,221
Well, I'm not.
I'm a man, remember?

1396
01:50:05,341 --> 01:50:08,572
I dread to think what this
is going to do to my azaleas.

1397
01:50:27,363 --> 01:50:29,456
August 10.

1398
01:50:29,532 --> 01:50:33,559
Signs of inclement weather.

1399
01:50:36,105 --> 01:50:40,201
Crew's morale remains high.

1400
01:50:57,193 --> 01:51:00,026
Steady as she goes.

1401
01:52:03,559 --> 01:52:07,188
Thank you.
Thank you very much, indeed.

1402
01:52:09,665 --> 01:52:13,533
- Any sign of her, Polynesia?
- Not yet.

1403
01:52:21,977 --> 01:52:25,344
Ah, good morning, Stubbins.
Beautiful day.

1404
01:52:25,414 --> 01:52:29,009
Yes, sir, good morning.
What happened to the ship?

1405
01:52:29,084 --> 01:52:34,021
Very good question.
If we ever find enough bits,
we'll put them together and find out.

1406
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:41,122
Come on, Matthew.
Rise and shine.

1407
01:52:41,197 --> 01:52:45,930
I told ya Flounder
was a terrible name for a boat.

1408
01:52:46,001 --> 01:52:48,970
Nonsense. The flounder's
a most reliable little fish.

1409
01:52:49,038 --> 01:52:51,199
It's survived the sea
for thousands of years.

1410
01:52:51,273 --> 01:52:53,707
Aye, below the surface.

1411
01:52:53,776 --> 01:52:56,267
Anyway, we're all safe.
That's the main thing.

1412
01:52:56,345 --> 01:53:00,509
- At least, we will be as soon
as we find Miss Fairfax.
- Poor Fred.

1413
01:53:00,583 --> 01:53:04,019
I said all along a ship
was no place for a woman.

1414
01:53:04,086 --> 01:53:07,351
Heaven knows I did my best to make
the voyage pleasant for her.

1415
01:53:07,423 --> 01:53:09,755
You can't spend your life
running after a woman,

1416
01:53:09,825 --> 01:53:13,158
waiting on her hand and foot
when there's important work to be done.

1417
01:53:13,229 --> 01:53:16,096
I think under the circumstances
I treated her very well.

1418
01:53:17,499 --> 01:53:20,798
Probably too well.

1419
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:23,100
Spoiled her, in fact.

1420
01:53:23,172 --> 01:53:25,572
And I tied her
very securely to that raft.

1421
01:53:27,343 --> 01:53:30,938
I hope she's all right.
That's all.

1422
01:53:33,616 --> 01:53:38,451
- We'll make a full-scale search
as soon as we get ashore.
- Ashore?

1423
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:41,512
Sea Star Island.
That's where we're going, isn't it?

1424
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:45,082
Apart from the fact
that we're shipwrecked,
that we have no means of gettin' there,

1425
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:47,424
and that we don't know
where it is anyway, yes.

1426
01:53:47,496 --> 01:53:50,021
You mustn't worry about things
like that, Matthew.

1427
01:53:50,099 --> 01:53:54,729
By my calculations, we were sort of
coming down in this direction like this,

1428
01:53:54,803 --> 01:53:58,432
and the floating island was sort of
coming down in that direction like that.

1429
01:53:58,507 --> 01:54:01,965
Then we sort of somehow or other
sort of more or less meet...

1430
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:04,342
somewhere round about here.

1431
01:54:05,414 --> 01:54:07,405
Is that a fact?

1432
01:54:07,483 --> 01:54:10,577
Ah! There it is now.

1433
01:54:17,059 --> 01:54:21,257
Well, shall we go ashore?

1434
01:54:27,136 --> 01:54:29,127
Giddyap.

1435
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:44,278
I must remember to get meself
one of those.

1436
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:13,705
Hmph. Any sign of Fred?

1437
01:55:13,782 --> 01:55:16,717
Not yet. I only hope
she caught the island.

1438
01:55:16,785 --> 01:55:19,379
It won't be passing here
again for months.

1439
01:55:19,455 --> 01:55:21,980
You and Stubbins search the beaches.
I'll go inland.

1440
01:55:22,057 --> 01:55:26,653
- Meet back here in two or three hours.
- Yeah. Tommy?

1441
01:55:32,401 --> 01:55:36,428
Polynesia, I want every living creature
on this island looking for that girl.

1442
01:55:36,505 --> 01:55:38,439
Yes, Doctor.

1443
01:55:38,507 --> 01:55:41,567
- Every bird that can fly I want
airborne until she's found.
- Yes, Doctor.

1444
01:55:41,643 --> 01:55:44,373
She can't be at sea.
We'd have heard from the fish by now.

1445
01:55:44,446 --> 01:55:47,415
- You sure she'll be
all right, Polynesia?
- Yes, Doctor.

1446
01:55:47,483 --> 01:55:49,781
She's standing
right behind you.

1447
01:55:49,852 --> 01:55:51,786
Good morning.

1448
01:55:51,854 --> 01:55:54,846
Oh, good morning.

1449
01:55:54,923 --> 01:55:59,383
Um, afraid we had
a bit of a storm last night.

1450
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:04,663
Thank you for telling me.

1451
01:56:04,733 --> 01:56:08,362
Pity you got lost. You could have
given us a hand getting these ashore.

1452
01:56:08,437 --> 01:56:11,770
I'm sorry. I was fully occupied
getting myself ashore.

1453
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:16,470
No mind. We managed. Some of these books
are very heavy though.

1454
01:56:16,545 --> 01:56:19,673
Saved all your books, I see.

1455
01:56:19,748 --> 01:56:23,240
- Yes, most fortunate.
- You lost all my dresses.

1456
01:56:23,318 --> 01:56:27,084
Yes, most unfortunate. I saw your trunk
floating amongst the wreckage.

1457
01:56:27,156 --> 01:56:29,989
However, the outfit you're
wearing this morning...

1458
01:56:30,059 --> 01:56:33,051
is the nicest thing I've seen you in
since you left England.

1459
01:56:33,128 --> 01:56:35,460
This is my underwear.

1460
01:56:35,531 --> 01:56:38,466
Oh. Anyway, it suits you.

1461
01:56:38,534 --> 01:56:41,560
I'm terribly glad to see you.

1462
01:56:43,972 --> 01:56:45,906
Are you?

1463
01:56:45,974 --> 01:56:49,876
Uh, well, we got
a tremendous lot to do.

1464
01:56:49,945 --> 01:56:53,448
We've got to unload the raft,
find food and build whatever
it is one has to build.

1465
01:56:53,581 --> 01:56:55,845
- What are you trying to say?
- Hmm?

1466
01:56:55,917 --> 01:56:58,181
Why don't you say what you mean?

1467
01:56:58,252 --> 01:57:00,743
What do you mean, say what I mean?

1468
01:57:00,822 --> 01:57:03,313
For a month or more
I have listened and dreamed

1469
01:57:03,391 --> 01:57:08,090
While the moon has glistened
and a million stars have gleamed

1470
01:57:08,162 --> 01:57:10,960
-  Waiting
- Waiting?

1471
01:57:11,032 --> 01:57:13,000
-  Waiting
- What for?

1472
01:57:13,067 --> 01:57:16,332
What for?  For a man
I know who is clever and kind

1473
01:57:16,404 --> 01:57:21,467
But a man who never ever
seems to know his mind

1474
01:57:21,542 --> 01:57:23,601
Waiting

1475
01:57:24,679 --> 01:57:27,648
Waiting

1476
01:57:27,715 --> 01:57:32,084
Waiting for you to say
you like me

1477
01:57:32,153 --> 01:57:36,055
Or hate me or miss me
or kiss me or something

1478
01:57:36,123 --> 01:57:40,526
But nothing
Nothing do you say

1479
01:57:40,595 --> 01:57:43,621
At all

1480
01:57:43,698 --> 01:57:48,761
Little wonder I feel
sorely neglected

1481
01:57:48,836 --> 01:57:54,206
Unwanted, rejected and small

1482
01:57:54,275 --> 01:57:59,508
Little more than two feet tall

1483
01:58:01,115 --> 01:58:04,380
Lucky to be here

1484
01:58:04,452 --> 01:58:07,319
At all

1485
01:58:08,556 --> 01:58:10,490
Emma?

1486
01:58:13,728 --> 01:58:16,526
I think I... like you.

1487
01:58:18,099 --> 01:58:21,193
Yes, I think I do.

1488
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:25,862
I think I like you.

1489
01:58:26,941 --> 01:58:29,432
I'm almost sure that I do

1490
01:58:31,078 --> 01:58:34,241
I think I like
the way you look

1491
01:58:34,315 --> 01:58:37,580
The way your eyes
reveal your mind

1492
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:44,148
Like a precious book
that's hard to find

1493
01:58:48,629 --> 01:58:53,157
I think I'm learning
something strange and new

1494
01:58:54,268 --> 01:58:57,635
But it's well worth learning

1495
01:58:57,705 --> 01:59:01,971
Because I'm learning about you

1496
01:59:02,043 --> 01:59:04,136
Like dawning sunshine

1497
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:08,375
When a new day is due

1498
01:59:08,449 --> 01:59:11,213
I think I like you

1499
01:59:13,955 --> 01:59:17,584
And I think you like me too

1500
01:59:17,658 --> 01:59:20,126
Do you?

1501
01:59:20,194 --> 01:59:22,162
Do you?

1502
01:59:22,229 --> 01:59:24,163
Do you?

1503
01:59:40,548 --> 01:59:44,279
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

1504
01:59:56,497 --> 02:00:00,490
Good heavens. I do believe that's
a great crested oriental moonbird.

1505
02:00:03,404 --> 02:00:05,668
It's terribly rare.
I'm so glad we came.

1506
02:00:16,617 --> 02:00:19,484
Great crested oriental moonbird.

1507
02:00:19,553 --> 02:00:21,953
What a bit of luck.

1508
02:00:32,967 --> 02:00:35,765
Ah, that's better.

1509
02:00:35,836 --> 02:00:39,602
Thank you very much.

1510
02:00:39,674 --> 02:00:41,608
Bye-bye.

1511
02:00:46,981 --> 02:00:49,711
The locals aren't
a very friendly lot, are they?

1512
02:00:49,784 --> 02:00:53,015
I bet you anything you like
they're going to kill us.

1513
02:00:53,087 --> 02:00:57,717
Whoever said children had beautiful
minds had obviously never met you.

1514
02:00:57,792 --> 02:01:01,626
Bein' in prison is much
the same as bein' on a boat,

1515
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:03,823
except in prison
there's less chance of drownin'.

1516
02:01:03,898 --> 02:01:05,832
And less chance of our
getting back to Puddleby.

1517
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:08,596
I must have a serious talk
to whoever runs this place.

1518
02:01:08,669 --> 02:01:11,331
I promised to get Stubbins home
in time to go to school.

1519
02:01:11,405 --> 02:01:15,341
I'm sure if you tell them that
we'll be out of here in no time.

1520
02:01:15,409 --> 02:01:20,745
Give me a leg up.
I want to see what's going on out there.

1521
02:01:33,527 --> 02:01:36,394
Good heavens.

1522
02:01:36,464 --> 02:01:38,932
All right, Matthew. Down.

1523
02:01:38,999 --> 02:01:42,025
- Why is it so cold?
- It's like being back in England.

1524
02:01:42,103 --> 02:01:44,867
There's a bit of frost. That's all.
It's quite clear what happened.

1525
02:01:44,939 --> 02:01:48,375
The storm that sank
the Flounder must have blown
the island off its usual course.

1526
02:01:48,442 --> 02:01:50,376
We're drifting too far north.

1527
02:01:50,444 --> 02:01:53,436
If we don't do something about it,
that marvelous vegetation
is going to die of frostbite.

1528
02:01:53,514 --> 02:01:55,448
To say nothin'
of our dear selves.

1529
02:02:04,458 --> 02:02:07,450
This is obviously
the gentleman to talk to.

1530
02:02:09,597 --> 02:02:11,997
Good morning.

1531
02:02:12,066 --> 02:02:16,662
Me Dr. Dolittle.
Search for great pink sea snail.

1532
02:02:16,737 --> 02:02:20,400
Small boy late for school.
Here very cold.

1533
02:02:20,474 --> 02:02:24,274
They all go home
Puddleby, yes?

1534
02:02:27,047 --> 02:02:28,981
What a funny accent.

1535
02:02:29,049 --> 02:02:30,983
Oh, I beg your pardon.

1536
02:02:31,051 --> 02:02:33,576
Actually, that's what
I came to see you about.

1537
02:02:41,195 --> 02:02:44,995
My name is William Shakespeare,
the Tenth. You may call me Willie.

1538
02:02:45,065 --> 02:02:47,329
Come with me, please.

1539
02:02:56,277 --> 02:02:58,973
Thank you.

1540
02:03:02,950 --> 02:03:05,043
We've had lots of
shipwrecks, of course.

1541
02:03:05,119 --> 02:03:09,351
Being a floating island does tend to
make us a bit of a danger to shipping.

1542
02:03:09,423 --> 02:03:11,891
We've bumped into lots
of things over the years.

1543
02:03:11,959 --> 02:03:15,190
But on the credit side, it enabled us
to build a marvelous museum...

1544
02:03:15,262 --> 02:03:20,097
and public library... books and
art treasures from all over the place.

1545
02:03:20,167 --> 02:03:23,330
Everybody on the island
speaks nine or ten languages.

1546
02:03:23,404 --> 02:03:26,567
We even name our children
after our favorite authors.

1547
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:29,234
That's why my name
is William Shakespeare.

1548
02:03:29,310 --> 02:03:31,369
Do forgive this paraphernalia.

1549
02:03:31,445 --> 02:03:35,643
We're rehearsing now
The Merchant Of Venice
for our Shakespeare drama festival.

1550
02:03:35,716 --> 02:03:39,117
- Do sit down. Milk or lemon?
- Milk, please.

1551
02:03:39,186 --> 02:03:41,120
Must be a near perfect civilization.

1552
02:03:41,188 --> 02:03:43,622
Then what are we doin' in prison?

1553
02:03:43,691 --> 02:03:46,524
Purely a precaution, old boy,
a sort of quarantine.

1554
02:03:46,594 --> 02:03:49,654
Most of the white men who have
come here in the past...

1555
02:03:49,730 --> 02:03:53,131
usually started killing people
before they've been introduced.

1556
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:57,068
- Extraordinary. Help yourself to sugar.
- Thank you.

1557
02:03:57,137 --> 02:04:01,267
But they never stay long.
They can't stand the peace and quiet.

1558
02:04:01,342 --> 02:04:05,779
I love peace and quiet,
but unfortunately we won't
be able to stay long either.

1559
02:04:05,846 --> 02:04:08,781
We've got to continue our hunt
for the great pink sea snail.

1560
02:04:08,849 --> 02:04:11,511
You haven't by any chance heard
of it being in the vicinity?

1561
02:04:11,585 --> 02:04:14,884
At the moment you have a bigger problem
than looking for snails.

1562
02:04:14,955 --> 02:04:17,753
According to
popular superstition,

1563
02:04:17,825 --> 02:04:22,694
newcomers to the island
are responsible for all our misfortunes.

1564
02:04:22,763 --> 02:04:26,699
So the elders of the village
are blaming you for this frost.

1565
02:04:26,767 --> 02:04:30,396
I don't know what we can do
about that. Perhaps there
is something I can think of.

1566
02:04:30,471 --> 02:04:33,269
I do hope so for your sake.

1567
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:36,798
You see, it's written here
in the law book.

1568
02:04:36,877 --> 02:04:40,540
"He who brings sunshine
to the coldness of our days...

1569
02:04:40,614 --> 02:04:44,072
shall bask in the splendor
of a thousand summers."

1570
02:04:44,151 --> 02:04:46,642
- That's very nice.
- Yeah.

1571
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:49,883
Yes, but it goes on.

1572
02:04:49,957 --> 02:04:53,552
"He who brings winter
into the summer of our lives...

1573
02:04:53,627 --> 02:04:56,994
shall die the death
of a thousand screams."

1574
02:04:57,064 --> 02:05:00,227
- Oh.
- I prefer the first one.

1575
02:05:00,301 --> 02:05:02,462
Yes, so did I.

1576
02:05:02,569 --> 02:05:06,061
The elders are also blaming you
for what's happened to the animals.

1577
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:08,074
What has happened
to the animals?

1578
02:05:08,142 --> 02:05:12,408
They've all caught colds.
They're coughing and sneezing
all over the place.

1579
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:16,381
I must do something about this
immediately. Come along, Polynesia.

1580
02:05:16,450 --> 02:05:18,418
We've got work to do.

1581
02:05:21,655 --> 02:05:23,953
Bless you.

1582
02:05:24,024 --> 02:05:26,117
Gesundheit.

1583
02:05:29,630 --> 02:05:31,928
Ha.

1584
02:05:34,401 --> 02:05:38,337
Here you are, Tommy. Another little
baby lion for you to take care of.

1585
02:05:38,405 --> 02:05:40,999
Yes, sir.

1586
02:05:41,075 --> 02:05:43,009
Bless you.

1587
02:05:43,077 --> 02:05:45,671
That inhalant seems
to be working very well.

1588
02:05:45,746 --> 02:05:50,649
Bless you.

1589
02:05:50,718 --> 02:05:54,586
I was hoping this
mustard bath would work.

1590
02:05:54,655 --> 02:05:58,648
Still very hot.

1591
02:05:59,827 --> 02:06:02,625
How soon will
my cough mixture be ready?

1592
02:06:02,696 --> 02:06:06,393
- Five minutes. Smell.
- Mmm!

1593
02:06:06,467 --> 02:06:09,334
I'd give it to the baby elephant
first, if I were you.

1594
02:06:09,403 --> 02:06:11,769
- Why?
- She's got a terrible cold.

1595
02:06:11,839 --> 02:06:14,273
I want to control it
before she gives it to the family.

1596
02:06:14,341 --> 02:06:16,901
When a herd of elephants start sneezing,
it's like a hurricane.

1597
02:06:16,977 --> 02:06:22,649
Might drive the island even further
off course. Thank you very much.

1598
02:06:24,617 --> 02:06:29,554
If we was to point them
in the right direction, perhaps
they could blow us back on course.

1599
02:06:29,622 --> 02:06:32,557
Pretty good theory,
but terribly difficult to organize.

1600
02:06:32,625 --> 02:06:35,526
If elephants could swim,
one good shove...

1601
02:06:35,595 --> 02:06:39,463
and we'd be back in a southerly current
before we could...

1602
02:06:41,034 --> 02:06:43,298
Why didn't I think of that before?

1603
02:06:43,369 --> 02:06:46,861
- They can swim.
- What, elephants?

1604
02:06:46,939 --> 02:06:51,569
No, no, no, Matthew. Tommy, what's
as big as an elephant that can swim?

1605
02:06:51,644 --> 02:06:53,942
A whale, sir.

1606
02:06:54,013 --> 02:06:56,675
Exactly.

1607
02:06:56,749 --> 02:07:00,014
Emma, get on
with the cough mixture.

1608
02:07:00,086 --> 02:07:02,577
Bless you.

1609
02:07:02,655 --> 02:07:05,419
Now, how do you get
in touch with a whale?

1610
02:07:06,726 --> 02:07:09,889
I'll talk to him immediately.

1611
02:07:09,962 --> 02:07:12,556
Splendid.

1612
02:07:12,632 --> 02:07:17,069
Good morning. Marvelous,
if the giraffe doesn't mind.

1613
02:07:17,136 --> 02:07:21,038
Extremely kind of you.
I do appreciate it.

1614
02:07:23,676 --> 02:07:25,041
Bless you.

1615
02:07:25,111 --> 02:07:28,740
You'll explain? Good.

1616
02:07:40,593 --> 02:07:42,754
Here he comes.

1617
02:07:42,829 --> 02:07:48,165
It was very decent of that turtle
to put us in touch with him.

1618
02:07:48,234 --> 02:07:50,395
My word! He's a big fellow.

1619
02:07:52,071 --> 02:07:56,838
Now, if he gave a shove below us,
that should just about do the trick.

1620
02:08:14,827 --> 02:08:17,261
Good morning.

1621
02:08:20,066 --> 02:08:25,527
One... shove... here.

1622
02:08:30,276 --> 02:08:33,905
We really must learn to speak
a few words of whale.

1623
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:37,040
Apparently they're very nice,
but nobody ever talks to them.

1624
02:09:00,907 --> 02:09:02,841
Look!

1625
02:09:07,413 --> 02:09:09,574
Why is it doing that?

1626
02:09:09,649 --> 02:09:12,140
The island is bound to roll
a bit after that shove.

1627
02:09:12,218 --> 02:09:14,209
It set that balancing rock
in motion.

1628
02:09:19,492 --> 02:09:23,656
- It'll soon calm down.
- That would be highly desirable.

1629
02:09:23,729 --> 02:09:26,960
It says here in the law book,

1630
02:09:27,033 --> 02:09:30,764
"He who causes the great rock
to fall into the hot mountain...

1631
02:09:30,837 --> 02:09:34,705
shall die the death
of 10,000 screams."

1632
02:09:44,217 --> 02:09:49,245
- Uh, how many screams did you say?
- 10,000.

1633
02:09:49,322 --> 02:09:53,850
I shouldn't have thought
it was worth more than five.

1634
02:10:04,704 --> 02:10:08,834
- I cannot tell you
how upset I am about this.
- You're upset?

1635
02:10:08,908 --> 02:10:10,842
We realize it isn't your fault.

1636
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:15,244
I've been through the law book
from cover to cover.
There is nothing I can do.

1637
02:10:15,314 --> 02:10:20,217
- This is the tradition.
- Oh, well, we hate to break a tradition.

1638
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:39,228
I once heard a story about
a tribe that burned people alive,
then et them for dinner.

1639
02:10:39,305 --> 02:10:41,899
I bet that's what
they're going to do to us.

1640
02:10:41,974 --> 02:10:46,673
Will you please put a curb
on your lurid imagination?

1641
02:10:46,746 --> 02:10:48,941
I'm sorry about this, Emma.

1642
02:10:49,015 --> 02:10:51,677
It hasn't been very relaxing
the last few days, has it?

1643
02:12:01,721 --> 02:12:05,384
I think we've bumped
into something.

1644
02:12:19,505 --> 02:12:21,166
Stop!

1645
02:12:23,442 --> 02:12:25,603
Release them!

1646
02:12:28,414 --> 02:12:30,939
Holy Pat.
What did we do now?

1647
02:12:32,485 --> 02:12:36,581
We've collided with the mainland.
The two pieces fit perfectly.

1648
02:12:36,655 --> 02:12:38,816
- How extraordinary.
- Not really.

1649
02:12:38,891 --> 02:12:41,416
The oldest legend of the island
has always maintained...

1650
02:12:41,494 --> 02:12:45,396
that we are a bit of Africa
that has been missing for 5,000 years.

1651
02:12:45,464 --> 02:12:47,591
Is there a reward
for finding it?

1652
02:12:47,666 --> 02:12:50,931
Oh, indeed, yes.

1653
02:12:51,003 --> 02:12:54,530
"He who brings back
the lost island from the sea...

1654
02:12:54,607 --> 02:12:58,236
shall live as a god
for a thousand moons."

1655
02:12:58,310 --> 02:13:00,870
Thank you. Thank you.

1656
02:13:00,946 --> 02:13:04,541
That's very pleasant,
but if you will excuse me,
I must get back to the hospital,

1657
02:13:04,617 --> 02:13:08,917
in case the elephant sneezes
and blows all the other patients away.

1658
02:13:08,988 --> 02:13:12,389
What will you do when
the animals are all well again?

1659
02:13:12,458 --> 02:13:17,896
I have one great ambition.
I came to find a great pink sea snail.
I intend to find it.

1660
02:13:17,963 --> 02:13:20,591
The great pink sea snail
is more than mythical.

1661
02:13:20,666 --> 02:13:22,600
I always thought that,
too, Willie.

1662
02:13:27,273 --> 02:13:29,366
No, no. You can see
the animals as they come out.

1663
02:13:29,442 --> 02:13:31,376
- Guard the gate, Matthew.
- Oh!

1664
02:13:31,444 --> 02:13:35,540
Come on. Come on.

1665
02:13:35,614 --> 02:13:40,381
- Why does he have the animals in there?
- All right, all right.

1666
02:13:40,453 --> 02:13:43,286
I'll tell ya.

1667
02:13:43,355 --> 02:13:48,554
Behind these gates is the most
wonderful place in all the world.

1668
02:13:48,627 --> 02:13:51,323
- Can we see it?
- Can we see it?

1669
02:13:51,397 --> 02:13:53,331
- Shh!
- Shh!

1670
02:14:18,357 --> 02:14:22,817
This is the world
of Dr. Dolittle

1671
02:14:22,895 --> 02:14:26,956
The wonderful world
of Dr. Dolittle

1672
02:14:27,032 --> 02:14:31,025
Where crocodiles talk
and elephants sing

1673
02:14:31,103 --> 02:14:35,233
And animals do
most any old thing

1674
02:14:35,307 --> 02:14:39,209
Where polar bears
wear top hats

1675
02:14:39,278 --> 02:14:42,213
And leopards
with spots wear spats

1676
02:14:42,281 --> 02:14:47,446
Well, that's life in
the world of Dr. Dolittle

1677
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:51,616
Doves start to coo
when they see Dolittle

1678
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:55,717
He has a profound philosophy

1679
02:14:55,794 --> 02:14:59,423
If animals can be friends
says he

1680
02:14:59,498 --> 02:15:05,061
Well, then why can't we

1681
02:15:05,137 --> 02:15:08,766
Matthew, open the gate.

1682
02:15:15,414 --> 02:15:18,906
Come on, baby. Up!

1683
02:15:21,153 --> 02:15:23,451
See they're all right, Matthew.

1684
02:15:25,824 --> 02:15:30,454
Say how do you do
to the world of Dr. Dolittle

1685
02:15:30,529 --> 02:15:34,295
Say how do you do
to the world of Dr. Dolittle

1686
02:15:34,366 --> 02:15:37,392
Life is a zoo to Dr. Dolittle

1687
02:15:37,469 --> 02:15:40,597
Life is a zoo
to Dr. Dolittle

1688
02:15:40,673 --> 02:15:44,302
Where antelopes lope

1689
02:15:44,376 --> 02:15:48,813
-  And ostriches fan
-  And ostriches fan

1690
02:15:48,881 --> 02:15:53,079
And kangaroos do
what kangaroos can

1691
02:15:53,152 --> 02:15:57,054
To make the hyenas laugh

1692
02:15:57,122 --> 02:16:00,091
As long as a long giraffe

1693
02:16:04,363 --> 02:16:09,426
Every calf starts to moo
when they see Dolittle

1694
02:16:09,501 --> 02:16:13,494
Even the few
who used to moo little

1695
02:16:13,572 --> 02:16:17,736
For all of the birds
and beasts agree

1696
02:16:17,810 --> 02:16:21,246
He has a profound philosophy

1697
02:16:21,313 --> 02:16:26,012
And so why can't

1698
02:16:26,085 --> 02:16:29,248
We.

1699
02:16:29,321 --> 02:16:33,519
All of the birds
and beasts agree

1700
02:16:33,592 --> 02:16:37,494
He has a profound philosophy

1701
02:16:37,563 --> 02:16:42,694
And so why can't we

1702
02:16:42,768 --> 02:16:47,535
Do little things to help them

1703
02:16:47,606 --> 02:16:49,631
Why

1704
02:16:49,708 --> 02:16:51,767
Can't

1705
02:16:51,844 --> 02:16:54,745
We

1706
02:16:54,813 --> 02:16:56,804
Oh.

1707
02:16:59,118 --> 02:17:01,712
Well, thank goodness
they only had head colds.

1708
02:17:01,787 --> 02:17:05,917
Think how terrible it would have been
if they'd had sore throats.

1709
02:17:05,991 --> 02:17:08,391
Our last two patients.
Well done, Emma.

1710
02:17:15,968 --> 02:17:19,199
Well, not a sniffle left
on the island.

1711
02:17:23,909 --> 02:17:28,073
Interesting noise. Can't be.

1712
02:17:28,147 --> 02:17:32,880
You mean, the great pink sea snail...

1713
02:17:32,951 --> 02:17:38,480
Precisely, and by the sound of it,
he seems to have caught a chill too.

1714
02:18:07,252 --> 02:18:11,416
So sorry.

1715
02:18:11,490 --> 02:18:14,516
I've never seen anything like it.

1716
02:18:14,593 --> 02:18:18,552
- Yes, I see.
Well, just a minute. Amazing!
- What is?

1717
02:18:18,630 --> 02:18:22,566
We've been searching
for weeks for the great snail.
He's been with us all the time.

1718
02:18:22,634 --> 02:18:25,262
Lives in an underground cave
and moves about with the island.

1719
02:18:25,337 --> 02:18:28,773
I was quite right. He's got a shocking
cold. I told him I was a doctor,

1720
02:18:28,841 --> 02:18:31,969
and if he'd come on the beach,
I'd mix him a batch of my special tonic.

1721
02:18:32,044 --> 02:18:35,241
It'll need to be
rather large, won't it?

1722
02:18:44,656 --> 02:18:47,124
What's that?

1723
02:18:47,192 --> 02:18:49,888
- What is it?
- He's purring.

1724
02:18:53,732 --> 02:18:58,999
Thrilled with his medicine. Feels much
more relaxed, almost like a new snail.

1725
02:18:59,071 --> 02:19:02,040
- Wanted to know if there's
anything he can do for us.
- Is there?

1726
02:19:02,107 --> 02:19:05,599
Yes, he can take you all
safely back to Puddleby.

1727
02:19:07,146 --> 02:19:10,479
Oh, well. Well, that's
a bit of an imposition.

1728
02:19:10,549 --> 02:19:14,315
Puddleby's a long way away. All you did
was give him a little medicine.

1729
02:19:14,386 --> 02:19:18,254
He's 2,000 years old.
He's lonely. It'll be company for him.

1730
02:19:18,323 --> 02:19:21,656
He'd been planning
to visit his cousin in Scotland
for 300 years and put it off.

1731
02:19:21,727 --> 02:19:23,661
Be a great opportunity for him.

1732
02:19:23,729 --> 02:19:26,323
- His cousin in Scotland?
- You've heard of the Loch Ness monster?

1733
02:19:26,398 --> 02:19:28,332
- Yes.
- Well, it's a cousin.

1734
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:30,960
- Good heavens.
- Travel under the sea?

1735
02:19:31,036 --> 02:19:34,335
But it's bad enough on top.
We'd all drown, Doctor.

1736
02:19:34,406 --> 02:19:36,931
No, the shell is
completely watertight.

1737
02:19:37,009 --> 02:19:39,273
It'll be like traveling
in a big pink bubble.

1738
02:19:39,344 --> 02:19:44,281
Yes, he says he can get you back
to Puddleby by two weeks from Tuesday.

1739
02:19:59,198 --> 02:20:02,634
This must be the only snail
in the world with four bedrooms.

1740
02:20:02,701 --> 02:20:04,635
Oh, and, Polynesia,

1741
02:20:04,703 --> 02:20:10,073
don't forget to remind
the snail to surface twice a day
for his cough mixture.

1742
02:20:10,142 --> 02:20:13,270
It will fix up his cold, and stretch
your legs and get some sea air.

1743
02:20:13,345 --> 02:20:15,643
- Yes, Doctor.
- Oh, good.

1744
02:20:15,714 --> 02:20:18,444
I'd hate to miss my turn on deck.

1745
02:20:18,517 --> 02:20:22,510
And, Chee-Chee, don't eat all
the bananas. Leave some for the others.

1746
02:20:22,588 --> 02:20:27,355
Shh, shh. Don't be sad.

1747
02:20:27,426 --> 02:20:29,360
That's all, sir.

1748
02:20:29,428 --> 02:20:32,192
Good-bye, Stubbins.
Go up to the house whenever you like.

1749
02:20:32,264 --> 02:20:36,098
Yes, sir. And, Doctor,
come home soon, sir.

1750
02:20:37,469 --> 02:20:39,403
Well...

1751
02:20:46,078 --> 02:20:51,345
Well, I'll, uh... I'll send your other
high hat back from Puddleby, Doctor.

1752
02:20:51,416 --> 02:20:54,385
The snail can bring it
back with him.

1753
02:20:54,453 --> 02:20:56,887
Yours is looking
a little grubby now.

1754
02:20:56,955 --> 02:20:59,753
You'll probably find it
a bit difficult to get one here.

1755
02:20:59,825 --> 02:21:02,919
Yes, uh, probably.

1756
02:21:04,096 --> 02:21:06,257
Well, thank you, Matthew.

1757
02:21:07,332 --> 02:21:09,493
Well, uh, good-bye.

1758
02:21:09,568 --> 02:21:11,763
Bye.

1759
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:17,338
Uh, give my love
to everyone at home,

1760
02:21:17,410 --> 02:21:20,277
to Gub-Gub and Dab-Dab
and everyone.

1761
02:21:20,346 --> 02:21:22,837
Good-bye, John Dolittle.

1762
02:21:23,916 --> 02:21:26,350
Take care!

1763
02:21:31,123 --> 02:21:35,787
Well, Tom, I still wish
he was comin' with us.

1764
02:21:35,861 --> 02:21:40,127
I've never driven
one of these things before.

1765
02:21:49,708 --> 02:21:52,575
Sure you won't change your mind
and come with us?

1766
02:21:52,645 --> 02:21:57,742
I can't, Emma. Your uncle will put me
away the moment I set foot in Puddleby.

1767
02:21:57,817 --> 02:21:59,808
But you have
to come back one day.

1768
02:21:59,885 --> 02:22:03,446
I hope so. A lot
of animals depend on me.

1769
02:22:03,522 --> 02:22:06,582
One or two people too.

1770
02:22:09,395 --> 02:22:14,059
Puddleby's going to seem
very dull after all this excitement.

1771
02:22:14,133 --> 02:22:16,761
I mean, what are you
going to do here?

1772
02:22:16,836 --> 02:22:20,328
I think I'll start
planning my next voyage.

1773
02:22:20,406 --> 02:22:23,466
Where are you going
this time? The moon?

1774
02:22:23,542 --> 02:22:26,534
- Very probably, yes.
- You're not serious.

1775
02:22:26,612 --> 02:22:28,671
- Oh, yes.
- How?

1776
02:22:28,747 --> 02:22:32,046
On the giant lunar moth.
Magnificent creature.

1777
02:22:32,117 --> 02:22:34,051
Flies backwards and forwards
between the earth and the moon.

1778
02:22:34,119 --> 02:22:36,713
When it reaches one,
it's attracted by the light
of the other and flies back again.

1779
02:22:36,789 --> 02:22:38,723
Willie tells me
there's one on the island.

1780
02:22:38,791 --> 02:22:41,589
My idea is to build some sort
of saddle arrangement,

1781
02:22:41,660 --> 02:22:44,356
- very secure,
so I don't fall off halfway.
- Can I come?

1782
02:22:45,931 --> 02:22:47,865
Hmm?

1783
02:22:47,933 --> 02:22:50,458
Can I come with you?

1784
02:22:52,271 --> 02:22:55,832
Emma, I'm afraid...

1785
02:22:55,908 --> 02:22:59,901
I'm not very good with people.

1786
02:22:59,979 --> 02:23:04,609
L... I'm all right
with animals, but people...

1787
02:23:04,683 --> 02:23:07,880
I'm not very good with.

1788
02:23:07,953 --> 02:23:10,581
I never have been.
I don't know why.

1789
02:23:18,230 --> 02:23:20,824
I'll write to you.

1790
02:23:20,900 --> 02:23:26,236
I'll organize an air postal service
with the seagulls.

1791
02:23:32,745 --> 02:23:34,713
I'll miss you, John Dolittle.

1792
02:24:59,865 --> 02:25:03,392
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Tom.

1793
02:25:03,469 --> 02:25:07,269
If we ever drown in this thing,
it'll be in a flood of tears.

1794
02:25:39,505 --> 02:25:42,770
Sophie. What are you doing here?

1795
02:25:47,913 --> 02:25:52,850
No. Oh, how do you do, sir?

1796
02:25:52,918 --> 02:25:56,183
Really? Good Lord.

1797
02:25:56,255 --> 02:26:00,385
Sophie, that's marvelous news.
Thank you very much, indeed.

1798
02:26:05,397 --> 02:26:07,661
Good-bye, Sophie.
Thank you. Thank you!

1799
02:26:10,469 --> 02:26:15,634
"Good night, sweet Prince, and flights
of angels sing thee to thy rest."

1800
02:26:15,708 --> 02:26:18,871
Willie! Willie!
Wonderful news.

1801
02:26:18,944 --> 02:26:22,141
Sophie, the seal,
and her husband have come to tell me...

1802
02:26:22,214 --> 02:26:24,409
all the animals in England
are on strike.

1803
02:26:24,483 --> 02:26:26,883
They refuse to do any work
until I'm reprieved.

1804
02:26:26,952 --> 02:26:30,444
- You can go home?
- Yes. The local magistrate
is begging me to go back.

1805
02:26:30,522 --> 02:26:32,854
The whole country's paralyzed
without the animals.

1806
02:26:32,925 --> 02:26:35,894
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1807
02:26:35,961 --> 02:26:39,590
I think that tree
is about the right size.

1808
02:26:39,665 --> 02:26:43,032
It's a 60-foot overall wingspan.

1809
02:26:43,102 --> 02:26:47,129
- But you've missed the snail.
- I've got a better idea.
I'm going to fly home.

1810
02:26:47,206 --> 02:26:50,937
Can you imagine their faces
when they see me on the quayside
waiting for them in Puddleby?

1811
02:26:51,009 --> 02:26:55,139
- Fly home?
- Since you say there's one
on the island, on the lunar moth.

1812
02:26:55,214 --> 02:26:58,650
- Help me make a model so I can
gauge where to put the saddle.
- Certainly.

1813
02:26:58,717 --> 02:27:01,447
I've got to allow for
a very steep rate of climb.

1814
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:05,149
Now, you see,
you'll be the wings.

1815
02:27:05,224 --> 02:27:08,216
All of you. That's it.

1816
02:27:08,293 --> 02:27:10,955
Just sit down inside
those lines I've just drawn.

1817
02:27:11,029 --> 02:27:13,964
Everybody. That's the idea.

1818
02:27:14,032 --> 02:27:18,162
Good. Yes, I think
it's going to work splendidly.

1819
02:27:18,237 --> 02:27:22,469
As soon as I've built this saddle, we'll
go and have a chat with the lunar moth.

1820
02:27:22,541 --> 02:27:26,102
I only hope he understands
common house moth. That's all I speak.

1821
02:27:26,178 --> 02:27:29,079
Then as soon as the moon comes up,
we'll be off to Puddleby.

1822
02:27:29,148 --> 02:27:31,116
Wonderful night for flying.

1823
02:27:31,183 --> 02:27:34,152
By my calculations I should
be home in time for breakfast.

1824
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:40,592
The stars are made
of lemon drops

1825
02:27:40,659 --> 02:27:44,459
The bigger ones
are lollipops and ice

1826
02:27:44,530 --> 02:27:46,521
The clouds have shops
up on the tops

1827
02:27:46,598 --> 02:27:48,691
That sell you sweets
and soda pops

1828
02:27:48,767 --> 02:27:52,703
What do they call the place
Isn't it paradise

1829
02:27:52,771 --> 02:27:56,639
Maybe what the doctor tells me

1830
02:27:56,708 --> 02:28:00,439
Isn't altogether true

1831
02:28:00,512 --> 02:28:04,710
But I know every tale he tells me

1832
02:28:04,783 --> 02:28:08,583
I don't know any better ones
Do you

1833
02:28:08,654 --> 02:28:12,647
My friend the doctor says
the world is full of fantasy

1834
02:28:12,724 --> 02:28:16,125
And who are you and I
to disagree

1835
02:28:16,195 --> 02:28:18,561
Let's hope and pray
that is the way

1836
02:28:18,630 --> 02:28:20,825
The life we love
will always stay

1837
02:28:20,899 --> 02:28:24,164
For my friend the doctor

1838
02:28:24,236 --> 02:28:28,866
And me
