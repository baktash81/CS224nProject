1
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,264
The war criminals will proceed
in orderly fashion...

2
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:56,864
to the main waiting room
and await instructions

3
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:01,504
Obey the guards

4
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,320
War criminals must proceed
to the main waiting room

5
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,920
Those caught talking
will be severely punished

6
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:00,672
The Emperor

7
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,184
Your Majesty...His Majesty

8
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:06,880
What do they think they are doing?

9
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:08,128
It is dangerous

10
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,288
Go back

11
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:16,128
They could kill us all

12
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,968
Open the door

13
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:18,560
Open the door!

14
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:24,704
"PEKING, 1908"

15
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,336
By the command of Her lmperial Majesty
...also called the Compassionate

16
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:21,984
...and the Blessed...the
Respectful and the Long Living

17
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:29,632
The Empress Dowager commands...
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi...Son of Prince Chun...

18
00:07:29,664 --> 00:07:34,336
shall be transferred...immediately
...to the Forbidden City...

19
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:39,456
and will remain in the Great Within
awaiting Her Majesty's decision

20
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:41,952
Respect this

21
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:20,544
"Ar Mo, I am giving you my Son"

22
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:21,888
My son is your son

23
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,424
"Quick, quick"

24
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:47,136
I want to go home

25
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,136
Look. Look at the Forbidden City

26
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:44,256
Give him to me

27
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,056
Ar Mo

28
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:19,328
Pu Yi. Come here

29
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,464
Are you afraid of me?

30
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:42,016
Everyone is

31
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:46,944
I am the Grand Empress Dowager

32
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:52,640
"And I have lived here...
for a long, long time"

33
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:09,376
And they call me the Old Buddha

34
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:15,904
This is Peony

35
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:18,976
Do you like her?

36
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:26,208
"Men, you know...are not allowed
in the Forbidden City after dark"

37
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,840
Even little men like you

38
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,184
The only man who can live
here...is the Emperor

39
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:46,624
But the Emperor is on high
...ridding the dragon now

40
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:51,808
He died today

41
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:10,272
Longevity

42
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:17,888
These other men...they're not real men

43
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:22,048
They are all eunuchs

44
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:33,248
And now...they are all
waiting...for me to die

45
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,296
That is why...they are putting my
bed...in the middle of the room...

46
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:43,424
under the Black Pearl

47
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,352
Little Pu Yi

48
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:58,336
I have decided...that you will be
the new Lord of Ten Thousand Years

49
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:07,264
You will be the Son of Heaven

50
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:58,400
"Are we going home, Papa?"

51
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,312
It will soon be over

52
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,184
Look!

53
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,344
Cricket!

54
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:14,560
"Cricket, where's the cricket?"

55
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:17,888
"He is my friend, Your Majesty"

56
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,800
Safe and warm under my arm

57
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:25,184
Kept me company on the long journey here

58
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:31,296
He is kowtowing to Your Majesty

59
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:36,224
Now he can be the Emperor's cricket

60
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:49,088
"Your Majesty, this is the Forbidden City"

61
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:55,296
This little one is...Your Majesty's bedroom

62
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,672
This is where we are

63
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:58,240
Am I going home today?

64
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:01,984
Not today

65
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:08,640
"And here, look"

66
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:25,664
I'll give Your Majesty
the Gate of Marshovala

67
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:38,368
I don't like baths!

68
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:42,720
I don't like baths

69
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:50,016
More beancurd today. And no meat

70
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,992
Is it true I can do anything I want?

71
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:13,440
Of course Your Majesty. Anything you want

72
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,192
You are the Lord of Ten Thousand Years

73
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:23,744
I am the Son of Heaven!

74
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:30,432
I am the Son of Heaven!

75
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,560
"Ar Mo, I want to go home"

76
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:38,368
"I want to go home, I want to go home,
I want to go home, Ar Mo"

77
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:41,120
I want to go home

78
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:05,024
Once upon a time...there was a great tree

79
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:08,480
and a great wind

80
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:13,472
And when the tree fell...
the monkeys were scattered

81
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:38,688
His soup is getting cold

82
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,992
Where am I?

83
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:43,104
In the People's Republic of China...

84
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:50,144
Why did you stop me?

85
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:52,768
You are a criminal. You must be judged

86
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:38,400
I repeat...

87
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Prisoners going to their cells
will walk with their heads bowed

88
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:44,000
Keep your eyes on the ground

89
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:46,688
No looking forward...or to the side

90
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:48,928
The Guard will give you directions...

91
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,528
and tell you when to turn

92
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:07,520
Pu Chieh

93
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,576
Your guest is waiting to
meet you...Your Majesty

94
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:38,368
Also your mother has arrived

95
00:22:39,552 --> 00:22:44,064
"You have not seen your mother
for many years, Your Majesty"

96
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:55,840
He is so small

97
00:22:56,448 --> 00:22:58,624
"He is young, Your Majesty"

98
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:01,920
Go

99
00:23:06,272 --> 00:23:10,240
The Emperor's brother.
His Excellency Pu Chieh

100
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:28,960
Ar Mo

101
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:44,448
How is the health of His Majesty's mother?

102
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,656
"It is better, thank you"

103
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,304
How much His Majesty has grown

104
00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:56,576
My mother has not seen me for seven years

105
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:02,208
Do you remember my face?

106
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,992
No

107
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:09,184
The night they came with the horses
...I knew it would be like this

108
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,136
My brother sees you every day

109
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:13,120
Pu Chieh is very excited to meet you

110
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,880
He often talks about you

111
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,888
We are all very proud of you

112
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:19,712
The kite

113
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,496
He chose this for you

114
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,920
Papa

115
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:17,312
They're turning away

116
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:20,768
Of course. Ordinary people are not
allowed to look at the Emperor

117
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,176
I'm too important

118
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:25,120
Is that true that you can
do whatever you want?

119
00:25:25,152 --> 00:25:26,496
Of course I can

120
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:29,344
If I am naughty someone else is punished

121
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:31,392
One of them

122
00:25:34,944 --> 00:25:36,096
Stop

123
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
The Emperor will walk

124
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,968
Are they all like you?

125
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,336
I've got three sisters and two friends

126
00:25:54,368 --> 00:25:56,576
If you come to our house...
you can play with us

127
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:58,880
The Emperor never leaves the palace

128
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,984
We play games together

129
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:03,584
I know a game too

130
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,864
Run

131
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,416
The ones on the boat are the High Consorts

132
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:01,632
High Consorts?

133
00:27:02,144 --> 00:27:04,288
The wives of the Emperor before me

134
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,728
They say they're my mother

135
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,384
But they're not

136
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:08,768
Why are you wearing that?
You are not allowed to wear yellow

137
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:11,840
But it is ordinary yellow

138
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:13,152
It is lmperial yellow

139
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,848
"No, it is not"

140
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
We say it is

141
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:18,368
Only the Emperor can wear that yellow

142
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:19,424
Take it off

143
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:20,320
No

144
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:21,216
Take it off

145
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:23,904
"No, and you're not the Emperor any more"

146
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:25,760
There is a new Emperor now

147
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:28,256
He has cut off his queue.
And instead of a camel...

148
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:30,144
he has got a car

149
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:31,904
What did you say?

150
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:38,400
You're not the Emperor

151
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,960
Liar

152
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,136
You're not the Emperor any more

153
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,512
You're not the Emperor

154
00:29:54,112 --> 00:29:55,168
You're not the Emperor

155
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,448
How dare you!

156
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,504
You're not the Emperor!

157
00:30:09,536 --> 00:30:11,616
How dare you

158
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,728
Am I the Emperor or not?

159
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,216
Your Majesty...will always be the Emperor

160
00:30:21,728 --> 00:30:22,560
You see

161
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:24,160
Prove it

162
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,424
Big Foot

163
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,576
Drink it

164
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,416
Drink the green ink

165
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,672
I will show you

166
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:27,168
"See, that is a car"

167
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,696
He is the President of the Republic

168
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:29,664
"Why is this wall here, Lord Chamberlain?"

169
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:34,560
"It is just a wall, Your Majesty.
Nothing has changed here"

170
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,800
You are lying

171
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:51,776
High Tutor

172
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:53,920
Am I still the Emperor?

173
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,464
You will always be the Emperor...
inside the Forbidden City...

174
00:32:58,784 --> 00:33:00,736
but not outside

175
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,592
I do not understand

176
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:06,400
Outside China is now a Republic...

177
00:33:06,432 --> 00:33:08,000
with a President

178
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:11,648
Where is Ar Mo?

179
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:37,440
You are all liars

180
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:45,472
Let me say goodbye

181
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,136
Hurry

182
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,440
He's my child

183
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:26,752
I do not understand

184
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,568
I do not understand

185
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,712
Your Majesty is a big boy now

186
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:34,464
He cannot have a wet nurse any more

187
00:34:34,496 --> 00:34:36,160
It is much better like this

188
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,824
Much healthier

189
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,064
But she is not my wet nurse

190
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:44,032
She is my butterfly

191
00:34:56,288 --> 00:35:03,136
Ar Mo

192
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:18,048
Ar Mo

193
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:16,256
This is the detention centre...

194
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:18,720
of the Fushun Bureau of Public Security...

195
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,216
and I am the Governer

196
00:36:21,536 --> 00:36:25,248
During the war...this was a Japanese prison

197
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,040
Many of you may remember it...

198
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,048
because you worked with the Japanese

199
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:32,608
You were responsible for building it...

200
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,744
and you filled it with innocent people

201
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,600
How could this happen?

202
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:39,328
Why did you betray your country?

203
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,984
What turned you into war criminals?

204
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,408
We believe...that men are born good

205
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,704
We believe...that the only way to change...

206
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,384
is to discover the truth
and look at it in the face

207
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:55,040
That is why you are here

208
00:36:55,264 --> 00:36:58,720
You will begin by writing
the story of your lives...

209
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,704
and by confessing your crimes

210
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,360
Your salvation will lie entirely...

211
00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:07,328
in the attitude you take

212
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,200
I advise you to be frank and sincere

213
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:16,576
Otherwise things can still
go very badly for you

214
00:37:29,376 --> 00:37:32,160
TWILIGHTIN THE FORBIDDEN CITY

215
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:44,288
After a few years the Chinese Republic...

216
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,912
had become as corrupt as the old empire

217
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:51,808
It fell quickly into the hands of
ambitious generals and corrupt bureaucrats

218
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:55,488
The era of the warlords had begun

219
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,400
By May 1919 when I had
received my appointment...

220
00:37:58,432 --> 00:38:01,024
China was in turmoil

221
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:04,416
May the new tutor present himself

222
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,856
Your lmperial Highness...the new tutor

223
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:26,560
Mr Reginald Fleming Johnston

224
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:29,888
"How do you do, Mr Johnston?"

225
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:33,568
"How do you do, Your Majesty"

226
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,720
Now we will go to school

227
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
Your Majesty...

228
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,120
in my country it would be usual to begin
...with some kind of an examination

229
00:40:53,472 --> 00:40:56,000
The Emperor cannot be examined

230
00:40:56,256 --> 00:40:58,368
Now that my have to change

231
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:02,816
But first your Majesty might
like to ask me some questions?

232
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,744
Where are your ancestors buried?

233
00:41:07,776 --> 00:41:10,048
"In Scotland, Your Majesty"

234
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:14,240
But then where's your skirt?

235
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,376
"In your country men wear
short skirts, do they not?"

236
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:20,192
"No, Your Majesty, Scotsmen
do not wear skirts..."

237
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:22,688
they wear kilts

238
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,152
Kilts?

239
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,296
A matter of words

240
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:29,376
perhaps but words are important

241
00:41:29,408 --> 00:41:30,944
Why are words important?

242
00:41:30,976 --> 00:41:33,792
"If you cannot say what
you mean, Your Majesty..."

243
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,352
you will never mean what you say

244
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:40,480
And a gentleman should
always mean what he says

245
00:41:40,512 --> 00:41:42,848
Ah yes! A gentleman

246
00:41:43,616 --> 00:41:46,048
Are you a gentleman?

247
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:49,696
"I would like to be a gentleman, Your Majesty"

248
00:41:50,272 --> 00:41:51,584
I try to be

249
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,248
I am not a gentleman

250
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:55,904
I'm not allowed to say what I mean

251
00:41:55,936 --> 00:41:58,496
They are always telling me what to say

252
00:41:59,712 --> 00:42:03,392
Your Majesty is still very young

253
00:42:04,832 --> 00:42:09,344
I thought he might like to see
some English and American magazines

254
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:12,704
I have just received them

255
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,432
I know that you know...
that I know that you know...

256
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:26,432
that that is a dialogue between
Confucious...and Chuang-Tsu

257
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:31,520
"Concerning respect, Your Majesty"

258
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:45,568
Who is this George Washington?

259
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:48,256
"A famous American, Your Majesty"

260
00:42:48,288 --> 00:42:51,552
"A revolutionary General,
the first American President"

261
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,176
"Ah, like Mr Lenin in Russia?"

262
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,896
Not quiet

263
00:42:57,696 --> 00:42:59,904
Does he have a car?

264
00:43:00,448 --> 00:43:03,744
"He lived a long time ago, Your Majesty"

265
00:43:04,544 --> 00:43:07,488
I want a car

266
00:43:10,912 --> 00:43:15,392
"I think your mouse is trying to escape,
Your Majesty"

267
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,128
Please do not tell anyone about my mouse

268
00:43:32,288 --> 00:43:35,296
The lesson is finished

269
00:44:04,192 --> 00:44:07,008
Our official taster is a brave man

270
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:12,576
"Many of my ancestors have
been poisoned, you know"

271
00:44:14,592 --> 00:44:17,760
Does Your Majesty have lunch
like this every day?

272
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:20,320
"Oh, yes, every day. Like theatre"

273
00:44:20,384 --> 00:44:23,104
I do not know why.
It has always been like that

274
00:44:28,224 --> 00:44:30,880
How do they kill Emperor's in the West?

275
00:44:32,448 --> 00:44:35,008
"The Austrian Emperor was shot, was he not?"

276
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:39,392
But this nephew was assassinated
before the Great War

277
00:44:39,424 --> 00:44:41,664
But the Russian Emperor has been shot

278
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:43,104
He was called the Tsar

279
00:44:44,288 --> 00:44:46,944
He took lots of our land in Manchuria

280
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,352
I'm a Manchurian

281
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:52,384
"Even after the Republic,
it's still my country"

282
00:44:52,960 --> 00:45:00,032
"The, er...secret,
Your Majesty, is emerging again"

283
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:19,840
Something is happening

284
00:45:24,512 --> 00:45:26,208
"What is happening, Mr Johnston?"

285
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:29,056
Nothing is Quiet

286
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,480
"On our way here, Your Majesty..."

287
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:15,776
we were held up by
students from a University

288
00:46:16,288 --> 00:46:19,232
They were protesting against
the Republican Government...

289
00:46:19,264 --> 00:46:23,520
because it has agreed to give
away Chinese territory...to Japan

290
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,776
"Is it true, Mr Johnston..."

291
00:46:28,064 --> 00:46:29,760
that many people out there have
had their heads chopped off?

292
00:46:30,112 --> 00:46:32,064
"It is true, Your Majesty..."

293
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,360
many heads have been chopped off

294
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,488
It does stop them thinking

295
00:46:39,872 --> 00:46:41,792
It is time for the Emperor's rest

296
00:46:41,824 --> 00:46:45,024
The students are right to be angry

297
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,224
I am angry

298
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:56,768
But I'm not allowed to
leave the Forbidden City

299
00:46:57,504 --> 00:47:00,320
"I want to go out, Mr Johnston"

300
00:47:02,496 --> 00:47:06,272
"My Lord, I want to see the city of sounds"

301
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,536
The Emperor awards you...with
the order of the Ruby Hat Button...

302
00:47:17,824 --> 00:47:22,592
and with the right to be carried in
your own chair with four bearers

303
00:49:06,976 --> 00:49:09,376
I hope the Emperor has not forgotten...

304
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:12,672
that this is the day for his maths class

305
00:49:19,616 --> 00:49:21,632
For Your Majesty

306
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,064
My doctor said bicycles are bad for you

307
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:26,432
"Bad for you, nonsense"

308
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,192
How does it work?

309
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,424
Oh...it's simple

310
00:49:40,928 --> 00:49:45,440
Head up and eyes forward as in life

311
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:11,904
"My Mother's dead, is she not?"

312
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,024
"Yes, Your Majesty. I'm profoundly sorry"

313
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,496
I'm not

314
00:50:22,336 --> 00:50:24,128
She killed herself

315
00:50:24,384 --> 00:50:27,104
She swallowed a ball of opium

316
00:50:28,032 --> 00:50:31,648
"I'm going to see her, and my brother"

317
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,584
Open the door

318
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:03,072
Open the door!

319
00:52:14,688 --> 00:52:19,808
Open the door!

320
00:53:11,424 --> 00:53:12,640
Look where you lead him

321
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:16,192
"And you are an old, cruel, ignorant man"

322
00:53:16,224 --> 00:53:17,408
The boy's Mother is dead

323
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:20,000
and he's not even allowed to see her

324
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,328
I want to go out! I want to go out!

325
00:53:23,584 --> 00:53:25,504
Stop it. Stay where you are

326
00:53:25,504 --> 00:53:26,688
I want to go out

327
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,736
Stop it! Stay where you are

328
00:53:28,736 --> 00:53:29,856
I want to go out!

329
00:53:35,552 --> 00:53:37,568
Hunchback. Big Foot

330
00:54:04,832 --> 00:54:10,368
"Give me your hand, sir"

331
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,160
"Give me your hand, sir"

332
00:54:39,168 --> 00:54:41,280
"Look at my left ear please, sir"

333
00:54:44,256 --> 00:54:46,816
And now my right

334
00:54:48,096 --> 00:54:51,616
"Would you follow my finger please, sir"

335
00:54:57,856 --> 00:54:59,456
"Well, it's perfectly simple Johnstone"

336
00:54:59,744 --> 00:55:01,952
The Emperor needs spectacles

337
00:55:02,112 --> 00:55:03,936
Like Harold Lloyd

338
00:55:04,224 --> 00:55:05,728
Impossible

339
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,000
An Emperor does not wear spectacles

340
00:55:08,544 --> 00:55:10,496
That cannot be allowed

341
00:55:10,528 --> 00:55:13,472
"Times have changed, Your Highnesses"

342
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:30,432
"If His Majesty doesn't get
spectacles, Johnston..."

343
00:55:30,464 --> 00:55:32,128
he could lose his sight

344
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:58,912
"If the Emperor does not get spectacles,
I will resign"

345
00:55:59,264 --> 00:56:02,368
"Unfortunately, our decision is final..."

346
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,192
and unfortunately what I have to say...

347
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:08,480
will be published in every newspaper in China

348
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:14,112
"What do you have to say, Mr Johnston?"

349
00:56:15,136 --> 00:56:17,792
The Emperor has been a
prisoner in his own palace...

350
00:56:17,824 --> 00:56:19,680
since the day that he was crowned...

351
00:56:19,712 --> 00:56:21,856
and has remained a prisoner
since he abdicated

352
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:25,056
"But, now he's growing up...he may wonder
why he's the only person in China"

353
00:56:25,088 --> 00:56:27,808
who may not walk out of his own front door

354
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:34,144
I think the Emperor is the
loneliest boy on earth

355
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,416
It would be conveniently sad...
if he becomes blind

356
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,104
Blind...Mr Johnston?

357
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,336
"To the expense, Your Excellency"

358
00:56:46,656 --> 00:56:49,888
To the cost of maintaining one
thousand two hundred Eunuchs...

359
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,840
three hundred and fifty ladies-in-waiting...

360
00:56:51,872 --> 00:56:54,976
and one hundred and eighty-five cooks

361
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:58,048
To buying one hundred and
twenty sable furs a month...

362
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,288
and three thousand chickens a week

363
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,712
To the fact that eight hundred
and forty Guards and employees...

364
00:57:03,744 --> 00:57:07,520
of the Household Department
plus one Lord Chamberlain...

365
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:09,504
care only about one thing...

366
00:57:09,536 --> 00:57:12,640
filling their own rice bowls

367
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,320
"You are very good at accounts, Mr Johnston"

368
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:18,752
The Emperor may have abdicated...

369
00:57:19,072 --> 00:57:23,616
but he is still a symbol of
great importance...to many people

370
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:28,192
If I did not agree with
that I would not be here

371
00:57:29,472 --> 00:57:35,616
And some of us believe...that one
day soon he may be more than a symbol

372
00:57:36,128 --> 00:57:38,816
The spectacles are a detail

373
00:57:38,848 --> 00:57:41,536
"What do you really want, Mr Johnston?"

374
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:45,440
Just the spectacles

375
00:58:34,656 --> 00:58:37,408
"Oh no...The Princess Wan Jung, Your Majesty"

376
00:58:37,696 --> 00:58:39,648
Seventeen years old

377
00:58:46,528 --> 00:58:50,304
"Princess Who Jen, fifteen years old"

378
00:58:50,624 --> 00:58:52,896
"The Princess Li Li, Your Majesty"

379
00:58:54,432 --> 00:58:57,536
And the Princess Fun Ying

380
00:59:09,472 --> 00:59:10,816
Who is this?

381
00:59:11,488 --> 00:59:14,272
"Princess Wen Hsiu, twelve years old"

382
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,384
She has got a funny face

383
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:28,192
Not just one wife

384
00:59:28,224 --> 00:59:30,464
One Empress and one Secondary Consort

385
00:59:30,624 --> 00:59:31,712
Two wives

386
00:59:31,712 --> 00:59:33,984
"But, who did you choose to be the Empress?"

387
00:59:34,016 --> 00:59:36,256
"They chose her, she's very old, Johnston"

388
00:59:36,512 --> 00:59:37,600
She's seventeen

389
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,672
"That's not so old, Your Majesty"

390
00:59:40,896 --> 00:59:42,112
What does she look like?

391
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:43,392
Old-fashioned

392
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,344
"I want a modern wife, Johnston"

393
00:59:45,632 --> 00:59:48,064
Who speaks English and French

394
00:59:50,304 --> 00:59:52,576
And who can dance the quickstep

395
01:00:02,912 --> 01:00:05,344
Johnston

396
01:00:08,704 --> 01:00:11,008
"I'm going to escape, Johnston"

397
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,080
I've got a suitcase and a ticket to English

398
01:00:14,112 --> 01:00:16,864
I'm going to Oxford University

399
01:00:17,152 --> 01:00:20,256
Your Majesty...if you get married...

400
01:00:20,288 --> 01:00:23,488
you will become the master of your own house

401
01:00:23,552 --> 01:00:27,520
A wedding might be a more
practical way to escape

402
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,624
"Why did you never get married, Johnston?"

403
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,120
The Secondary Consort welcomes the Empress

404
01:01:17,152 --> 01:01:20,512
The Empress greets the Secondary Consort

405
01:01:30,784 --> 01:01:32,512
You are doing everything every well

406
01:01:32,544 --> 01:01:35,040
Thank you. I rehearsed many times

407
01:02:31,872 --> 01:02:34,240
What is his Majesty thinking?

408
01:02:34,496 --> 01:02:36,896
I was thinking if I was a real Emperor...

409
01:02:36,928 --> 01:02:39,168
I would become the ruler of China now

410
01:02:40,064 --> 01:02:42,432
And what would the Emperor do...

411
01:02:42,464 --> 01:02:43,904
if he could really rule?

412
01:02:43,936 --> 01:02:45,248
I would change everything

413
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,264
Even the way we get married

414
01:02:48,256 --> 01:02:50,720
Is the Emperor against arranged marriages?

415
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,592
It is humiliating not to
choose whom you marry

416
01:02:54,944 --> 01:02:57,824
Even I was not allowed to choose

417
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,352
In another year or two...

418
01:03:12,672 --> 01:03:14,560
His Majesty will be taller than me

419
01:03:16,096 --> 01:03:19,008
Is it true the Emperor has
a suitcase under his bed...

420
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:21,536
and is going to Oxford

421
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,512
Will the Emperor take Wan Jung with him?

422
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:30,560
Perhaps he would like to
see my face before he decides

423
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:35,680
The Emperor would like to see
the face of the Empress

424
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,448
It is the Emperor who
must remove the kai t'ou

425
01:04:42,176 --> 01:04:46,432
I also had a tutor...like Mr Johnston

426
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:50,304
Miss Windsor

427
01:04:52,992 --> 01:04:55,008
She's American

428
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,480
Miss Windsor taught me how to
do the dance of the quickstep

429
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:29,088
Does the Emperor know how to do the quickstep?

430
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,736
Will you teach me?

431
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,440
"Leave us, leave us"

432
01:06:42,848 --> 01:06:46,848
If Your Majesty thinks...
it is old fashioned...

433
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,176
to make the rain and
the wind with a stranger...

434
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:52,960
we can be like a modern
couple...to begin with

435
01:06:53,568 --> 01:06:55,680
A modern couple?

436
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:00,544
Goodnight! Goodnight!

437
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:12,384
You must come to Oxford with me

438
01:07:18,016 --> 01:07:19,616
I like him

439
01:07:20,192 --> 01:07:23,552
I am sure I am going to like him

440
01:07:23,584 --> 01:07:25,408
And he will grow up

441
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:30,624
Eyes down

442
01:07:36,608 --> 01:07:38,304
Report your arrival

443
01:07:38,624 --> 01:07:40,768
Prisoner 981 reporting

444
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,760
Louder!

445
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:43,936
Prisoner 981 reporting!

446
01:07:44,256 --> 01:07:45,632
Open the door

447
01:07:51,552 --> 01:07:53,696
Close the door

448
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,056
Sit down

449
01:08:03,232 --> 01:08:04,288
Name?

450
01:08:04,512 --> 01:08:06,240
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi

451
01:08:06,272 --> 01:08:07,680
Write it

452
01:08:27,072 --> 01:08:31,648
Now then...there are two types of confession

453
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:34,720
We call them toothpaste...

454
01:08:34,752 --> 01:08:36,192
and water tap

455
01:08:36,576 --> 01:08:40,960
The toothpaste prisoner needs to
be squeezed every now and then...

456
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,168
or else he forgets to keep confessing

457
01:08:44,576 --> 01:08:49,440
The water tap man...needs one good
hard twist before he starts...

458
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:51,776
but then everything comes out

459
01:08:52,096 --> 01:08:55,904
Now...you're an intelligent person

460
01:08:55,936 --> 01:08:58,304
I'm sure you understand me?

461
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,400
Good. Then we'll begin

462
01:09:03,808 --> 01:09:06,592
Why do you think you're in here 981?

463
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,928
I am accused of being a traitor...

464
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,936
a collaborator and a counter revolutionary

465
01:09:12,352 --> 01:09:14,784
It is not an accusation! You are a traitor!

466
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:19,392
You are a collaborator and you
are a counter revolutionary

467
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,560
Did you write this?

468
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,152
And you call it a confession?

469
01:09:29,536 --> 01:09:31,616
This is nothing but a list of dates

470
01:09:31,648 --> 01:09:33,344
A child's fairy tale

471
01:09:44,256 --> 01:09:45,600
What do you want me to confess?

472
01:09:45,632 --> 01:09:47,104
You know what you did...

473
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,896
and what others did

474
01:09:48,928 --> 01:09:51,168
So why don't you volunteer the information?

475
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,736
I do not understand

476
01:09:53,056 --> 01:09:55,744
We don't tell people what to confess

477
01:09:55,776 --> 01:09:57,952
We already know everything about you

478
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,640
I...

479
01:10:10,848 --> 01:10:12,960
I wanted reforms

480
01:10:13,248 --> 01:10:16,256
What did you want to...reform?

481
01:10:16,544 --> 01:10:18,528
Everything

482
01:10:20,192 --> 01:10:21,696
Cut off my queue

483
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:25,472
"Your Majesty, please"

484
01:10:58,752 --> 01:11:00,192
It is heavy

485
01:11:00,512 --> 01:11:02,464
The Emperor before me was murdered...

486
01:11:02,496 --> 01:11:05,632
because he wanted to reform the Empire

487
01:11:05,664 --> 01:11:07,552
"Is that no so, Mr Johnston?"

488
01:11:07,584 --> 01:11:10,368
"Yes, Your Majesty...probably"

489
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:17,376
Well...let's see if they will kill me
for reforming the Forbidden City

490
01:11:18,752 --> 01:11:21,440
I am appointing Mr Johnston's friend...

491
01:11:21,472 --> 01:11:25,344
the poet and scholar Chen Hsiao-Hsiu
...to be the new Lord Chamberlain

492
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,336
I want him to supervise a detailed
inventory...of the lmperial storerooms

493
01:11:30,336 --> 01:11:34,848
So that we can learn exactly
how much has been stolen

494
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:34,880
29.970

495
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,536
The Forbidden City had become
a theatre without an audience

496
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:52,184
So why did the actors remain on the stage?

497
01:11:53,592 --> 01:11:59,128
It was only to steal the
scenery...piece by piece

498
01:12:10,552 --> 01:12:14,552
Can I sleep here? I am frightened

499
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:31,384
You're brave

500
01:12:31,576 --> 01:12:33,080
Are you not frightened?

501
01:12:34,328 --> 01:12:35,480
I am excited

502
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,688
I do not want to escape anymore

503
01:12:38,712 --> 01:12:41,144
I want to rule

504
01:12:43,512 --> 01:12:45,784
Kiss me

505
01:13:15,736 --> 01:13:18,872
Can I stay with you as well?

506
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,680
Get in. Get in

507
01:13:42,072 --> 01:13:45,848
I used to play a game with the Eunuchs...

508
01:13:47,864 --> 01:13:52,408
trying to guess who is who

509
01:13:52,856 --> 01:13:55,640
Now I cannot see you

510
01:15:52,664 --> 01:15:56,504
"The storerooms are on fire, Your Majesty"

511
01:16:11,224 --> 01:16:13,272
The fire was a terrible disaster

512
01:16:13,304 --> 01:16:15,768
And I knew that Eunuchs had started it...

513
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,912
to stop me from knowing what they had stolen

514
01:16:18,168 --> 01:16:21,912
There has been Eunuchs in the
Forbidden City...for eight hundred years

515
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:24,632
There were still more
than a thousand of them

516
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:26,584
I decided to expel them all

517
01:16:26,904 --> 01:16:30,264
I had to ask for
Republican troops to help me

518
01:17:31,384 --> 01:17:32,760
What are they carrying?

519
01:17:34,104 --> 01:17:36,024
Their organs

520
01:17:36,312 --> 01:17:38,040
Whatever their crimes...

521
01:17:38,072 --> 01:17:42,712
they cannot be deprived of the
right...to be buried as whole men

522
01:18:42,424 --> 01:18:44,120
I...I forgot what I was saying

523
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,976
You're wasting our time

524
01:18:46,008 --> 01:18:48,760
We want to know about the Japanese

525
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,120
How did your friendship
with the Japanese begin?

526
01:18:52,152 --> 01:18:54,168
Who introduced you? When?

527
01:18:56,664 --> 01:19:01,400
I think it was...it was 1924

528
01:19:01,432 --> 01:19:03,576
Parliament had been dissolved again

529
01:19:03,608 --> 01:19:04,824
The President had fled

530
01:19:05,144 --> 01:19:12,472
At first I thought it was just another
...coup d'etat by just another warlord

531
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:16,024
Only this time it was different

532
01:19:16,696 --> 01:19:19,480
This time it was my turn

533
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,712
Fifteen love

534
01:19:42,648 --> 01:19:45,016
Play

535
01:19:51,608 --> 01:19:54,744
Thirty-fifteen

536
01:20:23,544 --> 01:20:26,296
The rotten Government of
the Republic is in flight

537
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,016
Now we shall remove the foreign stench...

538
01:20:29,048 --> 01:20:32,856
of the Manchurian rats who still
hide in the Forbidden City

539
01:20:42,552 --> 01:20:45,176
Mr Pu Yi and his family...

540
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:48,952
have been given one hour
to leave the Forbidden City

541
01:20:50,488 --> 01:20:54,680
They will be escorted...to the
home of his Father and remain...

542
01:20:54,712 --> 01:20:57,912
there under guard as state prisoners...

543
01:20:57,944 --> 01:21:00,120
until further notice

544
01:21:06,008 --> 01:21:07,864
What are you all looking at?

545
01:21:08,184 --> 01:21:10,104
What are you standing there for?

546
01:21:10,136 --> 01:21:12,024
You always wanted to
leave the Forbidden City

547
01:21:12,344 --> 01:21:13,912
Now you have got an hour to pack

548
01:21:13,944 --> 01:21:17,784
So go

549
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:33,176
I always thought I hated it here

550
01:21:33,624 --> 01:21:35,928
But now I am afraid to leave

551
01:21:36,216 --> 01:21:37,432
Do you think they will kill me?

552
01:21:37,496 --> 01:21:39,800
"You must do as they say, Your Majesty..."

553
01:21:39,832 --> 01:21:41,912
while I try to reach the British Embassy

554
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:43,864
They will give you asylum there

555
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,616
I'm sure they will

556
01:21:47,992 --> 01:21:51,896
Chang...take my car to the South gate.
I want you to drive His Majesty

557
01:22:50,168 --> 01:22:52,024
Your Majesty

558
01:23:37,752 --> 01:23:38,840
"Please, Your Majesty"

559
01:23:38,872 --> 01:23:40,504
What?

560
01:24:25,528 --> 01:24:28,760
"But you didn't go to the
British Embassy, did you?"

561
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,936
You ended up at the Japanese Embassy

562
01:24:30,968 --> 01:24:33,752
The Japanese were the only people
prepared to help me

563
01:24:33,784 --> 01:24:35,352
Help you for nothing?

564
01:24:37,368 --> 01:24:40,856
Japan has an Emperor.
We are almost the same age

565
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:43,384
I thought it was kindness

566
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:47,192
The same time I relised that
for many Chinese...

567
01:24:47,224 --> 01:24:48,792
I was an alien

568
01:24:48,824 --> 01:24:51,352
Simply because I am Manchurian

569
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,856
There was even an Anti-Manchurian
League who wanted to assassinate me

570
01:24:57,048 --> 01:25:00,440
So I went to live in Tientsin

571
01:25:01,528 --> 01:25:06,392
It was a nice...provincial town
...with a big port

572
01:25:06,424 --> 01:25:10,424
In those days it had a large
International Settlement

573
01:25:10,424 --> 01:25:12,728
The Japanese thought it
would be safer for me there

574
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,352
Were the Japanese paying
for you in Tientsin?

575
01:25:15,384 --> 01:25:19,224
"Oh, no. I had to rent a villa"

576
01:25:19,224 --> 01:25:23,384
The villa Chang...and it was very expensive

577
01:25:23,416 --> 01:25:26,232
"So, were the bodyguards"

578
01:25:26,264 --> 01:25:28,280
I spent a lot of money in Tientsin

579
01:25:28,312 --> 01:25:32,312
Did you still believe in the
restoration of the lmperial system

580
01:25:32,344 --> 01:25:33,560
Others did

581
01:25:33,592 --> 01:25:35,896
The little court-in-exile

582
01:25:36,792 --> 01:25:40,600
I cannot remember how much
jade and jewellery...

583
01:25:40,632 --> 01:25:42,680
they made me spend to buy the
friendship of some warlord...

584
01:25:42,712 --> 01:25:45,208
or some...white Russian general

585
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:46,968
And what else did you spend your money on?

586
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,528
"Oh, I was never tired of buying pianos..."

587
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,768
"watches, radios"

588
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,784
As long as they were foreign

589
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:57,848
Of course. Anything Western was good

590
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,824
"Especially Wrigley's chewing gum,
Bayer aspirin..."

591
01:26:00,856 --> 01:26:01,912
and cars

592
01:26:01,944 --> 01:26:03,800
While you were in Tientsin...

593
01:26:04,248 --> 01:26:07,992
most of China came under the control
of General Chiang Kai Shek...

594
01:26:08,024 --> 01:26:11,928
the so-called Nationalists...the Kuomintang

595
01:26:12,248 --> 01:26:14,360
What were your relations with them?

596
01:26:14,392 --> 01:26:16,696
None

597
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,408
I felt useless in Tientsin

598
01:26:20,664 --> 01:26:22,264
I was twenty-one

599
01:26:23,192 --> 01:26:26,072
I dreamt of going to the West

600
01:26:27,096 --> 01:26:28,824
I became a playboy

601
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,360
"Tientsin, 1927"

602
01:27:58,104 --> 01:27:59,704
BRITISH INDIA STEAM NAVIGATION COMPAN

603
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,992
That's a great ship...
if you're going first class

604
01:28:14,104 --> 01:28:16,312
I'm not going anywhere

605
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,392
Would you like to dance?

606
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:32,184
You are a brave man

607
01:28:32,216 --> 01:28:33,880
Nobody here would have danced with me

608
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,448
Why's that?

609
01:28:37,272 --> 01:28:38,776
Because I am Chinese

610
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,112
Well...l'm American

611
01:28:51,704 --> 01:28:52,952
You say California.

612
01:28:53,272 --> 01:28:54,840
I say French Riviera

613
01:28:54,872 --> 01:28:56,152
San Fransisco

614
01:28:56,568 --> 01:28:57,752
Monte Carlo

615
01:28:59,032 --> 01:29:01,912
Are we really going this time?

616
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:11,704
Who's that couple?

617
01:29:12,376 --> 01:29:13,880
"Oh, Henry and Elizabeth"

618
01:29:15,352 --> 01:29:16,536
The Emperor of China?

619
01:29:16,888 --> 01:29:18,776
The ex-Emperor and his wife

620
01:29:21,016 --> 01:29:22,328
She's beautiful

621
01:29:22,552 --> 01:29:24,056
"Yes, very"

622
01:29:24,376 --> 01:29:25,432
And who are you?

623
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,120
I am His Highness' other wife

624
01:29:28,408 --> 01:29:29,496
His other wife?

625
01:29:29,528 --> 01:29:31,160
Number two wife

626
01:29:32,792 --> 01:29:34,776
"Well, some people have all the luck"

627
01:29:50,104 --> 01:29:52,408
Ladies and Gentlemen

628
01:29:54,872 --> 01:29:59,064
General Chiang Kai Shek...has taken Shanghai

629
01:29:59,224 --> 01:30:02,840
The Kuomintang have broken with the Reds

630
01:30:02,872 --> 01:30:04,056
and they've knocked them for six

631
01:30:04,088 --> 01:30:07,544
The Reds are finished!

632
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,200
Sorry about the reception everyone.
We'll have it fixed in a minute

633
01:30:15,096 --> 01:30:18,904
"It would be wiser to return to the
Japanese Legation now, Your Majesty"

634
01:30:19,096 --> 01:30:20,216
Your car is waiting

635
01:30:20,216 --> 01:30:22,168
"Thank you, Mr Amakasu"

636
01:30:35,224 --> 01:30:38,456
The General strike in Shanghai has collapsed

637
01:30:39,448 --> 01:30:42,488
The International Settlement is safe

638
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:47,640
Troops of the Kuomintang are now
in fall control of the city

639
01:30:47,672 --> 01:30:52,760
And firm steps are being taken to
restore order...in the native areas

640
01:31:01,688 --> 01:31:04,728
Wen Hsiu. You want some gum?

641
01:31:08,152 --> 01:31:10,616
I want a divorce

642
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:19,288
I do not want to be your mistress any longer

643
01:31:19,608 --> 01:31:21,688
I thought you were my Secondary Consort

644
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,928
In the Forbidden City you were the Emperor...

645
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,072
and I was a Secondary Consort

646
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:29,528
But now your are Henry Pu Yi...

647
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:32,536
"Wan Jung is your wife, Elizabeth"

648
01:31:34,232 --> 01:31:36,696
And who am I?

649
01:31:37,464 --> 01:31:40,312
I'm nobody

650
01:31:48,632 --> 01:31:51,384
I did not know you were so unhappy

651
01:31:56,024 --> 01:31:59,448
You can only have one wife in the West

652
01:32:04,248 --> 01:32:06,200
I want a divorce

653
01:32:06,488 --> 01:32:09,368
No one can divorce me

654
01:32:31,896 --> 01:32:33,944
I want a divorce

655
01:33:07,768 --> 01:33:14,776
Your Ladyship

656
01:33:34,264 --> 01:33:36,024
I do not need it

657
01:33:40,312 --> 01:33:43,064
I do not need it

658
01:34:22,776 --> 01:34:24,952
Can I come in?

659
01:34:25,688 --> 01:34:27,448
Don't you remember me?

660
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,104
"I'm dressed like a pilot,
but I still can't fly"

661
01:34:30,424 --> 01:34:31,544
Not yet

662
01:34:31,576 --> 01:34:34,136
Eastern Jewel. We had dancing classes together

663
01:34:34,456 --> 01:34:36,312
"Yes, just before your marriage"

664
01:34:36,856 --> 01:34:39,704
You silly girl.
Why do people want to get married?

665
01:34:40,088 --> 01:34:41,496
Wen Hsiu has gone

666
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,504
She will never come back

667
01:34:44,856 --> 01:34:46,680
Is that so bad?

668
01:34:47,512 --> 01:34:49,368
She was my only friend

669
01:34:50,968 --> 01:34:54,264
"Well, at least now you've got
a husband all to yourself'

670
01:34:55,864 --> 01:34:57,528
And you've got me

671
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,464
I'll be your friend

672
01:35:01,688 --> 01:35:02,776
You smoke opium?

673
01:35:02,808 --> 01:35:05,496
Be wicked. It's the best in Shanghai

674
01:35:07,064 --> 01:35:08,856
Why are you going to Europe?

675
01:35:08,888 --> 01:35:10,488
The place to go is Japan

676
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,376
It's more fun than anywhere

677
01:35:13,496 --> 01:35:15,192
It's modern

678
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,392
How do you know we are going to Europe?

679
01:35:18,424 --> 01:35:19,736
It is a secret

680
01:35:20,024 --> 01:35:21,816
"Oh, I know everything"

681
01:35:22,168 --> 01:35:25,976
I know Chiang Kai Shek has got false teeth

682
01:35:26,264 --> 01:35:28,984
"I even know his nickname, "Cash-my-check"

683
01:35:32,696 --> 01:35:35,192
I'm a spy

684
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,144
And I don't care who knows it

685
01:35:37,464 --> 01:35:38,648
A spy?

686
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,824
I work for the Japanese
Special Service Bureau...

687
01:35:41,176 --> 01:35:43,224
and I've come to protect you

688
01:35:44,408 --> 01:35:46,168
The Japanese?

689
01:35:47,128 --> 01:35:49,848
They are getting closer to him every day

690
01:35:51,032 --> 01:35:55,128
He is sending his brother...
to the Military Academy in Tokyo

691
01:35:55,288 --> 01:35:58,168
They talk to him about
Manchuria all the time

692
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:03,096
And Mr Amakasu never says hello to me

693
01:36:03,128 --> 01:36:04,888
I do not trust the Japanese

694
01:36:15,576 --> 01:36:18,264
"Of course, I'd love to be the
Emperor's new Secondary Consort"

695
01:36:18,296 --> 01:36:19,768
Eastern Jewel

696
01:36:19,928 --> 01:36:22,296
If the past available

697
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:42,104
"The post is vacant, my dear cousin..."

698
01:36:44,152 --> 01:36:47,032
but you do not fit the part

699
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:51,704
Wen Hsiu left her dog behind.
Do you want it?

700
01:36:54,296 --> 01:36:58,776
It is my fault. It is all my fault

701
01:37:29,592 --> 01:37:31,992
"I came to see you, Your Majesty..."

702
01:37:32,664 --> 01:37:35,128
to give you bad news

703
01:37:35,448 --> 01:37:37,464
Something terrible has happened

704
01:37:43,096 --> 01:37:49,240
The lmperial tombs of our Manchurian
ancestors have been attacked...

705
01:37:49,368 --> 01:37:51,384
and robbed...by troops of the Kuomintang

706
01:37:51,672 --> 01:37:53,272
Chinese soldiers

707
01:37:53,816 --> 01:37:57,304
A warlord working for Chiang Kai Shek

708
01:37:59,704 --> 01:38:05,816
The body of the Empress Dowager...
was hacked to pieces

709
01:38:06,808 --> 01:38:09,560
Her pearl necklace has
became a wedding present

710
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:14,104
from Chiang Kai Shek...to his new wife

711
01:38:33,976 --> 01:38:35,384
Tell me 981 ...

712
01:38:35,416 --> 01:38:37,048
do you consider yourself to be Chinese?

713
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,008
Of course

714
01:38:38,328 --> 01:38:39,160
What is this?

715
01:38:39,192 --> 01:38:40,408
Japan

716
01:38:40,536 --> 01:38:42,168
And what do you call this part of China

717
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,288
The North East

718
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:44,728
And what did you call it as a child?

719
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,296
Manchuria

720
01:38:46,488 --> 01:38:49,144
Japan invaded Manchuria

721
01:38:49,176 --> 01:38:50,488
"on September 18th, 1931"

722
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,304
And began to set up a puppet
state called Manchukuo

723
01:38:53,336 --> 01:38:56,248
"Shorty afterwards, a Japanese Delegation..."

724
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,784
paid you a secret visit in Tientsin...

725
01:38:57,816 --> 01:38:59,128
to request your collaboration

726
01:38:59,448 --> 01:39:00,824
Which you say you refused?

727
01:39:00,824 --> 01:39:02,424
Speak up

728
01:39:02,648 --> 01:39:05,112
I already told you.
I have told you a hundred times

729
01:39:05,144 --> 01:39:07,000
Tell us again. Tell us two hundred times

730
01:39:07,032 --> 01:39:08,792
I refused to collaborate

731
01:39:09,112 --> 01:39:11,384
"You say you refused, but a month later..."

732
01:39:11,672 --> 01:39:13,848
"on November 10th, 1931 ..."

733
01:39:14,168 --> 01:39:16,664
there you are arriving in Manchuria...

734
01:39:16,696 --> 01:39:18,712
or shall I call it Manchukuo?

735
01:39:19,032 --> 01:39:21,432
"Now, according to this
so-called confession of yours..."

736
01:39:21,464 --> 01:39:23,160
you didn't go of your own free will

737
01:39:23,192 --> 01:39:25,528
You insisted you were
kidnapped...by the Japanese

738
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:26,680
Yes

739
01:39:26,712 --> 01:39:27,864
And taken to Manchuria by force?

740
01:39:27,896 --> 01:39:29,048
Yes

741
01:39:29,432 --> 01:39:30,776
Sit down

742
01:39:33,336 --> 01:39:37,336
Do you remember a man called
Reginald Fleming Johnston?

743
01:39:38,328 --> 01:39:39,672
He was your tutor

744
01:39:40,728 --> 01:39:41,784
Yes

745
01:39:42,712 --> 01:39:45,304
And a good friend...I believe

746
01:39:46,872 --> 01:39:49,944
After twenty-eight years in China...

747
01:39:49,976 --> 01:39:51,928
Mr Johnston returned to England

748
01:39:52,536 --> 01:39:58,424
He became a Professor of Oriental
Studies...at London University

749
01:39:58,968 --> 01:40:00,696
And he wrote a book

750
01:40:00,728 --> 01:40:04,504
"It is called "Twilight
in the Forbidden City"

751
01:40:04,536 --> 01:40:07,128
And it is dedicated to you

752
01:40:10,968 --> 01:40:14,328
"Tientsin, 1931"

753
01:40:33,432 --> 01:40:35,544
"I am going to miss you, Johnston"

754
01:40:35,576 --> 01:40:37,560
"I shall miss you, Your Majesty"

755
01:40:41,528 --> 01:40:45,944
Do you think a man...
can become Emperor again?

756
01:40:46,584 --> 01:40:48,696
Yes

757
01:41:05,272 --> 01:41:07,960
"Thank you, Your Majesty"

758
01:41:13,144 --> 01:41:15,160
How can we say goodbye?

759
01:41:16,664 --> 01:41:20,344
As we said hello

760
01:41:30,392 --> 01:41:32,472
"Farewell, Mr Johnston"

761
01:41:32,792 --> 01:41:35,672
"Farewell, Your Majesty"

762
01:42:20,344 --> 01:42:22,200
"Goodbye, Mr Johnston"

763
01:42:22,232 --> 01:42:24,696
"We'll never forget you, Mr Johnston"

764
01:42:25,176 --> 01:42:30,424
"Mr Johnston, goodbye, goodbye"

765
01:42:33,944 --> 01:42:38,584
On page 449...

766
01:42:38,616 --> 01:42:40,888
Mr Johnston writes...

767
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:46,040
the endeavour to make out that
the Emperor had been kidnapped...

768
01:42:46,072 --> 01:42:48,184
by the Japanese...is wholly untrue

769
01:42:49,048 --> 01:42:52,952
He left Tientsin...he went to
Manchuria of his own free will...

770
01:42:52,984 --> 01:42:55,032
Johnston was a liar

771
01:42:55,384 --> 01:42:56,600
What did you say?

772
01:42:56,632 --> 01:43:00,952
Mr Johnston had left before
I was taken to Manchuria

773
01:43:01,336 --> 01:43:04,600
He could not have known what happened

774
01:43:19,064 --> 01:43:21,016
Sit down

775
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,664
According to this account...

776
01:43:28,696 --> 01:43:31,864
you prepared the man's things
on the morning of November 9th

777
01:43:31,896 --> 01:43:35,128
Isn't it unusual for a man who is
kidnapped to have his luggage packed...

778
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,272
by his valet the day before he's kidnapped

779
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:38,840
This is what you've written isn't it?

780
01:43:38,872 --> 01:43:41,656
Who told you to pack this man's luggage?

781
01:43:44,376 --> 01:43:46,360
These two stories don't fit

782
01:43:46,392 --> 01:43:48,280
Do they?

783
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:50,872
It was a long time ago

784
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:53,624
Perhaps I made a mistake

785
01:43:53,656 --> 01:43:54,744
You are lying

786
01:43:55,032 --> 01:43:56,920
You are both lying

787
01:43:56,952 --> 01:43:58,872
Control yourself

788
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:06,776
You can still change your mind

789
01:44:11,992 --> 01:44:16,504
I am the hereditary ruler
of the Manchukuo people

790
01:44:18,776 --> 01:44:22,552
There can be no Manchukuo without me

791
01:44:22,968 --> 01:44:26,680
Do you not see? The Japanese are using you

792
01:44:27,352 --> 01:44:29,752
I must try to use them

793
01:44:29,784 --> 01:44:32,056
The Japanese invasion of Manchuria...

794
01:44:32,088 --> 01:44:34,040
will be condemned by
the League of Nations...

795
01:44:34,072 --> 01:44:35,992
and by every civilised country on Earth

796
01:44:36,024 --> 01:44:39,416
The Chinese Republic has broken
every promise it ever made to me

797
01:44:39,544 --> 01:44:42,712
Chinese troops desecrated
the tombs of my ancestors

798
01:44:42,936 --> 01:44:46,232
And Chinese troops did not
defend Manchuria from the Japanese

799
01:44:46,264 --> 01:44:48,504
But Manchuria is still China

800
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,744
China has turned its back on me

801
01:44:50,776 --> 01:44:52,344
Please do not go

802
01:44:52,696 --> 01:44:55,544
Manchuria is the richest frontier in Asia

803
01:44:55,704 --> 01:44:58,104
"Coal, oil, railways"

804
01:44:58,264 --> 01:45:01,656
Millions of Chinese emigrants
are going there every year

805
01:45:01,944 --> 01:45:03,512
I'm going to build my country

806
01:45:03,832 --> 01:45:06,040
Johnston was wrong but he wasn't a liar

807
01:45:06,616 --> 01:45:08,504
There was no kidnapping

808
01:45:08,856 --> 01:45:11,128
You went to Manchuria by your own choice

809
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:13,080
because you wanted to be Emperor again

810
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:32,920
These might help you to remember the truth

811
01:45:47,576 --> 01:45:51,064
Manchuria 1934

812
01:47:06,872 --> 01:47:08,888
To Heaven

813
01:47:15,544 --> 01:47:17,656
To Earth

814
01:47:18,328 --> 01:47:20,088
To the Moon

815
01:47:22,552 --> 01:47:25,112
To the Sun

816
01:47:40,984 --> 01:47:43,000
You're an Empress again

817
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:46,456
What I'm going to be is a pilot

818
01:47:46,776 --> 01:47:48,760
I'm going to train at
a secret base near Yokohama

819
01:47:48,792 --> 01:47:50,520
To learn precision bombing

820
01:47:52,152 --> 01:47:54,872
I want to bomb Shanghai

821
01:47:55,544 --> 01:47:57,336
Bomb Shanghai?

822
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:59,480
I hate China

823
01:48:05,528 --> 01:48:07,928
I hate you

824
01:49:24,312 --> 01:49:26,040
The Japanese Army High Command

825
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:28,280
Very impressive

826
01:49:59,928 --> 01:50:04,344
On behalf of the Emperor of Japan...
the Commander of the Kwangtung Army...

827
01:50:04,376 --> 01:50:10,744
extends his warmest congratulations on
the occasion of His Majesty's coronation

828
01:52:01,336 --> 01:52:06,520
"Ah, may I introduce you...
my wife, the Princess Hiro Saga"

829
01:52:06,744 --> 01:52:10,328
Prime Minister Hsiao-Hsiu

830
01:52:14,392 --> 01:52:17,560
The Honourable Chang Ching-Hui...
Minister of Defense

831
01:52:18,232 --> 01:52:21,432
"The Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Colonna"

832
01:52:35,704 --> 01:52:39,448
The Empress and I accept with great pleasure

833
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,576
"Excuse me, Gentlemen"

834
01:53:09,752 --> 01:53:13,304
"Ah, and our Mr Amakasu..."

835
01:53:13,336 --> 01:53:18,040
is the new chief of the
Manchurian Motion Picture Studios

836
01:53:26,392 --> 01:53:29,336
Do you have to spoil this day?

837
01:53:29,368 --> 01:53:30,680
Why?

838
01:53:32,536 --> 01:53:37,720
Mr Amakasu is the most
powerful man in Manchukuo

839
01:53:37,752 --> 01:53:39,320
What are you talking about?

840
01:53:40,728 --> 01:53:44,600
You did not believe I could
be Emperor again. But I am

841
01:53:44,952 --> 01:53:47,192
You are blind

842
01:53:56,440 --> 01:54:00,184
Do you know what it means to be
an Empress? You are an Empress

843
01:54:03,992 --> 01:54:06,296
Why do you not make love to me anymore?

844
01:54:06,328 --> 01:54:08,792
Because you have become an opium addict

845
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,872
Opium killed my Mother

846
01:54:11,576 --> 01:54:13,080
Opium destroyed China

847
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:15,448
You can buy opium anywhere in Manchukuo

848
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:16,440
Shut up

849
01:54:16,472 --> 01:54:17,240
In any shop

850
01:54:17,272 --> 01:54:18,520
Shut up

851
01:54:22,072 --> 01:54:25,144
Your brother is going to have a child

852
01:54:27,128 --> 01:54:29,816
We must have a child

853
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:33,336
You must have an heir

854
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:38,520
Emperor Hirohito has officially
invited us to Japan

855
01:54:38,808 --> 01:54:40,568
I am going alone

856
01:54:41,016 --> 01:54:43,000
You are staying here

857
01:54:43,672 --> 01:54:45,304
I would never go to Japan

858
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:47,480
Then go to your room

859
01:54:54,328 --> 01:54:57,752
Ten thousand years to His Majesty the Emperor

860
01:54:58,904 --> 01:55:24,504
Ten thousand years

861
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:10,840
I told you I hate you

862
01:56:13,144 --> 01:56:17,144
Only because I give you what you need

863
01:56:49,304 --> 01:56:51,736
Now we're engaged

864
01:57:44,728 --> 01:57:46,712
You forgot my toothpowder

865
01:57:47,448 --> 01:57:49,752
"Yes, sir"

866
01:58:07,832 --> 01:58:08,824
Move him

867
01:58:13,656 --> 01:58:16,120
981 . Collect your things

868
01:58:25,496 --> 01:58:27,096
Up stairs

869
01:58:31,192 --> 01:58:32,472
Stop

870
01:58:40,664 --> 01:58:43,448
Your laces are undone. Do them up

871
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:44,856
Thursday you serve lunch

872
01:58:44,888 --> 01:58:46,616
Friday you clean the toilet

873
01:58:46,648 --> 01:58:49,176
Saturday you sweep the floor

874
01:59:15,608 --> 01:59:18,264
I have never been separated from my family

875
01:59:18,296 --> 01:59:20,312
You'd better get use to it

876
01:59:25,784 --> 01:59:27,640
"You do not remember me, do you?"

877
01:59:28,312 --> 01:59:32,696
I was the Minister of Trade -- in Manchukuo

878
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:37,656
You were all in Manchukuo

879
01:59:38,776 --> 01:59:41,048
Now I am the Cell Leader

880
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:43,224
It is important to follow the rules here

881
01:59:43,512 --> 01:59:46,520
No talking during study sessions

882
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:11,064
MANCHURIA 1935

883
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:38,200
"Where is your gun, Captain?"

884
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:39,832
Where are their swords?

885
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,584
"Our weapons have been removed, Your Majesty"

886
02:00:42,616 --> 02:00:45,048
On the orders of Colonel Yoshioka?

887
02:00:45,336 --> 02:00:47,608
Colonel Yoshioka?

888
02:00:48,696 --> 02:00:50,776
Colonel Yoshioka

889
02:00:50,808 --> 02:00:52,024
What has happened here?

890
02:00:52,344 --> 02:00:54,264
Why has my Guard been disarmed?

891
02:00:54,296 --> 02:01:00,280
There have been many changes
while you were in Tokyo

892
02:01:00,312 --> 02:01:03,480
"Your Majesty, may I present
Masaomi Kobayakawa..."

893
02:01:03,512 --> 02:01:06,968
the new Japanese Ambassador...to Manchukuo

894
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:34,968
Why is Prime Minister Hsiao-Hsiu
not here to receive me?

895
02:01:34,968 --> 02:01:37,784
"The Prime Minister has
resigned, Your Majesty"

896
02:01:38,168 --> 02:01:40,440
His son his been assassinated

897
02:01:40,792 --> 02:01:42,488
Assassinated?

898
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:46,264
"By Communist bandits, Your Majesty"

899
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:54,040
I must see him at once

900
02:01:54,072 --> 02:01:56,856
"He refuses to see anyone, Your Majesty"

901
02:01:56,888 --> 02:02:01,944
He has gone to a monastery... far away

902
02:02:08,504 --> 02:02:10,136
Who are you?

903
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:13,336
"Chang Ching Hui, Your Majesty"

904
02:02:13,336 --> 02:02:15,896
Minister of Defence

905
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:27,448
"The Council Meeting will be at
four o'clock, Your Majesty..."

906
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:29,624
before the State dinner

907
02:02:39,832 --> 02:02:43,832
The Emperor has been asked
to sign the following

908
02:02:44,376 --> 02:02:50,040
After careful consideration
we have decided...

909
02:02:50,072 --> 02:02:53,528
to nominate the honourable Chang Ching Hui
as the new Prime Minister of Manchukuo

910
02:02:59,256 --> 02:03:02,392
"Today, on the our return from Japan..."

911
02:03:02,424 --> 02:03:05,816
we wish to speak of
something more important...

912
02:03:06,072 --> 02:03:09,208
the future of our friendship with Japan

913
02:03:10,168 --> 02:03:13,368
This is based on mutual respect...

914
02:03:13,656 --> 02:03:17,688
and respect means equality and independence

915
02:03:17,976 --> 02:03:20,152
When the two Emperors stood together...

916
02:03:20,184 --> 02:03:22,520
and saluted the two national flags

917
02:03:22,552 --> 02:03:25,752
they recognised that
Manchukuo had come of age

918
02:03:25,784 --> 02:03:29,752
"Manchukuo is not a colony,
Manchukuo is Manchuria"

919
02:03:32,888 --> 02:03:35,416
The relationship between
our two countries...

920
02:03:35,448 --> 02:03:38,296
is like the relationship
between its two Emperors

921
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:43,512
It is rooted in fraternal
trust...in...in the desire

922
02:03:43,544 --> 02:03:46,200
to preserve our ancient traditions...

923
02:03:46,552 --> 02:03:50,232
and in a mutual respect
for national identities

924
02:03:51,416 --> 02:03:55,224
Already we have welcomed the
Ambassadors...of E I Salvador

925
02:03:55,256 --> 02:03:57,336
"Costa Rica, the Vatican"

926
02:04:00,024 --> 02:04:04,216
"Soon, I'm...l'm sure the
other countries will follow"

927
02:04:21,656 --> 02:04:24,312
I am going to have a child

928
02:04:28,024 --> 02:04:31,288
The Father is Manchurian

929
02:04:37,688 --> 02:04:40,600
I did it for you

930
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:02,328
His Majesty forgot to
sign the appointment of

931
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:05,880
the new Prime Minister...Mr Chang Ching Hui

932
02:05:08,152 --> 02:05:09,880
I did not forget

933
02:05:15,832 --> 02:05:19,928
"When an Englishman robs someone,
Your Majesty, he becomes a gentleman"

934
02:05:20,248 --> 02:05:23,192
If he robs a lot he becomes a knight

935
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:27,864
Do you imagine the British run
their empire as a charity?

936
02:05:28,184 --> 02:05:32,600
If India has payed for the
cost of its own occupation...

937
02:05:32,632 --> 02:05:35,672
so must Manchukuo

938
02:05:48,216 --> 02:05:52,472
We hope Manchukuo will have an heir

939
02:05:53,784 --> 02:05:55,928
The Empress is expecting a child

940
02:05:56,216 --> 02:05:59,288
"Yes, Your Majesty...we are
aware of the situation"

941
02:06:05,304 --> 02:06:07,640
This is the name of the
Father. His name is Chang

942
02:06:16,664 --> 02:06:21,112
He is your driver

943
02:06:38,904 --> 02:06:41,560
All the necessary facts have been recorded

944
02:06:41,592 --> 02:06:43,704
The man will be punished

945
02:06:44,152 --> 02:06:47,736
The Emperor cannot allow
his honour to be stained

946
02:07:03,768 --> 02:07:07,928
The Japanese are the only
divine race on our earth

947
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:14,840
"We will take China, Hong Kong...
Indo-China, Siam, Malaya"

948
02:07:14,872 --> 02:07:17,880
Singapore and India

949
02:07:17,912 --> 02:07:20,920
Asia belongs to us

950
02:07:50,488 --> 02:07:53,432
There have been complaints
from your cell mates

951
02:07:53,464 --> 02:07:57,688
You must learn how to urinate at night
without walking them all up

952
02:07:59,448 --> 02:08:01,400
The way to do it...

953
02:08:01,432 --> 02:08:04,312
is to urinate against
the side of the bucket...

954
02:08:04,344 --> 02:08:06,552
not into the middle

955
02:08:06,584 --> 02:08:08,376
"Yes, comrade"

956
02:08:21,816 --> 02:08:25,080
"You still think I'm your servant, don't you?"

957
02:08:46,648 --> 02:08:49,048
You are all pretending

958
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:51,096
You are just pretending you have changed

959
02:08:51,128 --> 02:08:53,816
The party it teach us to be new men

960
02:08:53,848 --> 02:08:55,800
We are working for a new China

961
02:08:56,024 --> 02:08:58,136
You worked in Amakasu's private office

962
02:08:58,168 --> 02:08:59,768
You are still the same people

963
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:01,816
People do not change

964
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:05,720
Guard!

965
02:09:12,024 --> 02:09:18,520
I let it happen

966
02:09:52,504 --> 02:09:54,520
"The second edict, Your Majesty"

967
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:59,672
Japanese will be the official
language in Manchukuo schools

968
02:10:11,224 --> 02:10:12,760
Your Majesty...

969
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:19,480
"The baby was born dead, Your Majesty"

970
02:10:19,672 --> 02:10:20,952
How is the Empress?

971
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:25,304
It would be better if she goes
to a clinic...somewhere warm

972
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:30,072
"She's already left, Your Majesty"

973
02:11:20,024 --> 02:11:24,792
Open the door

974
02:12:19,352 --> 02:12:22,328
With Manchukuo now firmly in their grasp...

975
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:25,560
the Japanese soon controlled
most of North China

976
02:12:25,912 --> 02:12:29,240
By 1937 they were ready to strike
South at the heart of the country

977
02:12:29,272 --> 02:12:31,064
The attack on Shanghai
was one of the first...

978
02:12:31,768 --> 02:12:36,728
civilian bombing raids in history

979
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:39,448
It left thousands homeless

980
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:41,240
Thousands dead

981
02:12:46,264 --> 02:12:48,280
Three months later Japanese armies...

982
02:12:48,312 --> 02:12:51,512
were besieging the provisional
capital...at Nanking...

983
02:12:51,864 --> 02:12:56,120
and when the city fell
...the atrocities began

984
02:12:56,664 --> 02:13:00,856
Trying to terrorise the rest
of China into surrender

985
02:13:00,888 --> 02:13:03,736
The Japanese high command ordered a massacre

986
02:13:03,768 --> 02:13:09,048
More than two hundred thousand civilians
were systematically executed

987
02:13:09,208 --> 02:13:11,576
The world watched in horror...

988
02:13:11,608 --> 02:13:13,912
but no help was given

989
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:16,600
On December 7th 1941 ...

990
02:13:16,952 --> 02:13:19,704
Japan attacked the American fleet...

991
02:13:19,704 --> 02:13:21,112
at Pearl Harbour

992
02:13:21,144 --> 02:13:23,544
There was no warning

993
02:13:23,768 --> 02:13:27,544
Manchukuo...the Japanese bustion in North China...

994
02:13:27,576 --> 02:13:32,216
was still ruled by the puppet Emperor Pu Yi

995
02:13:32,568 --> 02:13:35,512
But behind the facade of triumph...

996
02:13:35,544 --> 02:13:38,072
was a country enslaved

997
02:13:38,712 --> 02:13:42,456
A country where Japanese experiments
in biological warfare...

998
02:13:42,488 --> 02:13:46,456
were carried out on live human beings

999
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:52,760
A country where opium production became
the easiest way to finance the war

1000
02:13:52,984 --> 02:13:57,688
Millions of people...were deliberately
turned into drug addicts

1001
02:14:22,072 --> 02:14:26,584
Nine days after the bomb...

1002
02:14:26,616 --> 02:14:28,888
at Hiroshima on August 15th 1945...

1003
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:33,304
Emperor Hirohito...announced
the surrender of Japan

1004
02:14:33,432 --> 02:14:37,784
It was the first time...his voice
had ever been heard...on radio

1005
02:15:20,536 --> 02:15:22,840
"You must get to Tokoy, Your Majesty"

1006
02:15:22,872 --> 02:15:24,952
You must surrender to the Americans
not the Russians

1007
02:15:25,304 --> 02:15:27,704
The Communists will kill everyone

1008
02:16:11,096 --> 02:16:13,880
The Empress has returned

1009
02:16:21,688 --> 02:16:23,800
"Your Majesty, please"

1010
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,560
Your Majesty

1011
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:26,488
The women are not in danger. We must hurry

1012
02:18:20,792 --> 02:18:26,328
"Your Majesty, your Majesty is leaving now"

1013
02:18:59,992 --> 02:19:02,200
The Russians

1014
02:19:38,712 --> 02:19:42,520
Perhaps you think we are here
to teach men to lie in a new way?

1015
02:19:42,936 --> 02:19:46,520
Why did you sign every
accusation made against you?

1016
02:19:46,552 --> 02:19:49,912
I didn't stop you from killing
yourself to see you like this

1017
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:53,080
Someone who signs anything

1018
02:19:53,112 --> 02:19:56,056
to please his enemies...to please me

1019
02:19:56,088 --> 02:19:58,552
You knew about a lot of
things in Manchukuo...

1020
02:19:58,584 --> 02:20:00,568
even the secret agreements

1021
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:03,576
But you couldn't possibly have known
about the Japanese biological warfare

1022
02:20:03,608 --> 02:20:08,280
experiments in Harbin. Could you?

1023
02:20:09,400 --> 02:20:12,504
So why did you sign these papers?

1024
02:20:16,728 --> 02:20:19,160
I was responsible for everything

1025
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:22,488
You are responsible for what you do

1026
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:26,168
All your life you thought you
were better than everyone else

1027
02:20:26,456 --> 02:20:29,048
Now you think you are the worse of all

1028
02:20:34,296 --> 02:20:37,336
Why can you not leave me alone?

1029
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:41,560
You saved my life...to make me
a puppet in your own play

1030
02:20:43,576 --> 02:20:46,360
You saved me because I am useful to you

1031
02:20:46,552 --> 02:20:51,256
Is that so terrible?

1032
02:21:22,168 --> 02:21:25,048
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi

1033
02:21:29,208 --> 02:21:33,592
By order of the Supreme People's Court...

1034
02:21:33,624 --> 02:21:37,240
the War Criminal Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi...

1035
02:21:37,272 --> 02:21:40,920
"male, fifty-three years old..."

1036
02:21:40,952 --> 02:21:45,496
of the Manchu nationality and from Peking...

1037
02:21:45,528 --> 02:21:48,856
has now served the years detention

1038
02:21:49,368 --> 02:21:53,208
As a result of remoulding through labour...

1039
02:21:53,432 --> 02:21:57,720
and ideological education...

1040
02:21:57,752 --> 02:22:01,560
during his captivity he has shown
that he has genuinely reformed

1041
02:22:01,592 --> 02:22:06,616
In accordance with Clause One
of the Special Pardon Order...

1042
02:22:06,648 --> 02:22:10,392
he is therefore to be released

1043
02:22:21,464 --> 02:22:22,712
You see?

1044
02:22:22,936 --> 02:22:27,384
I will end up living in
prison longer than you

1045
02:25:01,848 --> 02:25:04,376
They are so young

1046
02:25:04,888 --> 02:25:07,000
It is dangerous

1047
02:25:13,912 --> 02:25:16,312
"Pu Chieh, look"

1048
02:25:21,048 --> 02:25:23,096
It is the Governor of our prison

1049
02:25:23,832 --> 02:25:24,952
It cannot be

1050
02:25:24,984 --> 02:25:27,192
"It is, I'm sure it is"

1051
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:31,000
Be careful

1052
02:25:32,664 --> 02:25:34,040
Come back

1053
02:26:17,272 --> 02:26:21,080
"Comrade. This must be a mistake,
I know this man"

1054
02:26:21,112 --> 02:26:22,392
He is a good man

1055
02:26:22,424 --> 02:26:23,288
Who are you?

1056
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:25,016
I am a gardener

1057
02:26:25,432 --> 02:26:28,024
"Join us comrade, or fuck off'

1058
02:26:38,104 --> 02:26:39,416
But what has he done?

1059
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:40,376
He's been accused

1060
02:26:40,408 --> 02:26:41,336
Accused of what?

1061
02:26:41,368 --> 02:26:42,168
Emperor's lackey

1062
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:43,384
Revisionist element

1063
02:26:43,416 --> 02:26:44,632
Rotten rightest

1064
02:26:45,496 --> 02:26:46,808
Confess your crimes

1065
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:48,024
I have nothing to confess

1066
02:26:48,408 --> 02:26:50,296
Kowtow to Chairman Mao

1067
02:26:54,264 --> 02:26:55,544
Confess your crimes

1068
02:26:55,576 --> 02:26:56,632
I have nothing to confess

1069
02:26:56,920 --> 02:26:58,008
Kowtow

1070
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:03,160
Confess your crimes

1071
02:27:03,192 --> 02:27:04,408
Wait

1072
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:06,744
He is a teacher. He is a good teacher

1073
02:27:07,928 --> 02:27:09,272
You cannot do this to him

1074
02:30:07,512 --> 02:30:13,656
Stop. You are not allowed in there

1075
02:30:17,176 --> 02:30:18,008
Who are you?

1076
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:18,936
I live here

1077
02:30:18,968 --> 02:30:20,408
I am the son of the Guardian

1078
02:30:21,304 --> 02:30:23,544
"Ah. Well, I used to live here too"

1079
02:30:23,608 --> 02:30:25,368
That is where I sat

1080
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:26,488
Who are you?

1081
02:30:27,352 --> 02:30:29,976
I was the Emperor of China

1082
02:30:30,008 --> 02:30:31,768
Prove it

1083
02:32:07,288 --> 02:32:09,368
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony...

1084
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:11,160
where the Emperors were crowned

1085
02:32:11,352 --> 02:32:13,720
The last Emperor to be crowned here
was Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi

1086
02:32:13,752 --> 02:32:17,208
He was three years old

1087
02:32:17,464 --> 02:32:20,568
He died in 1967
