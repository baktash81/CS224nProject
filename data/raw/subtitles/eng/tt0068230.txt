00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,676
("Night on Bald Mountain"
by Modest Mussorgsky)

2
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:41,000
(can engine rumbling)

3
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:28,982
(ominous music)

4
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:44,740
- In here.

5
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,158
The doctor's expecting you.

6
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,246
- Thank you.

7
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,385
- Ah, Dr. Martin.

8
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:01,298
- Yes.

9
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:05,640
- You'll forgive me for not rising.

10
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:06,645
- An accident?

11
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:08,556
- Might call it that.

12
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:11,225
Carelessness, actually.

13
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:13,895
Never turn your back on a patient.

14
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:15,688
They teach you that at school, don't they?

15
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,697
- Yes they do, Dr. Starr.

16
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:19,608
- Dr. Rutherford.

17
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,197
Lionel Rutherford.

18
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:22,869
- Ah.

19
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:28,076
I understood that Dr. Starr
was head of this institution.

20
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:30,244
- I'm Dr. Starr's associate.

21
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:31,879
Sit down. Sit down.

22
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:35,754
- You advertised for a senior houseman.

23
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,088
I sent along my credentials

24
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:39,219
and Dr. Starr asked me to
come along for an interview.

25
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,722
- I've read your report.

26
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:45,179
It doesn't tell me what I need to know.

27
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:47,811
Your background qualifies you to set up

28
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,723
a fashionable psychiatric practice

29
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,485
to hold wealthy old ladies by the hand

30
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:58,898
while they tell you about
their horrible husbands.

31
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:02,989
But we're along way from
Harley Street out here.

32
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,533
This is a...

33
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,915
an asylum

34
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:10,075
for the incurably insane.

35
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:17,254
You want to know the
most useful thing here?

36
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,588
This.

37
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:20,378
Controls to the door upstairs.

38
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:21,215
No keys.

39
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:23,471
Just an electrical device.

40
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,310
The door can't be opened from either side

41
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:30,642
unless I press that button.

42
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:32,397
- If you're trying to warn
me that some of the inmates

43
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:34,934
are potentially dangerous,
you needn't worry.

44
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:37,853
I've dealt with disturbed
patients during my training.

45
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,818
- By what methods?

46
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,948
- Kindness, understanding,

47
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:42,778
insight.

48
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:45,535
- Exactly my ways, 20 years ago.

49
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:49,331
Now I'm not so sure.

50
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,492
Those poor devils up there can't be cured,

51
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:53,205
they can only be confined

52
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,167
and kept from being dangerous.

53
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:58,082
- Is that Dr. Starr's outlook too?

54
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,711
- Dr. Starr is upstairs now.

55
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,838
- What? With a patient?

56
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,973
- Dr. Starr is a patient.

57
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:12,221
Dr. Starr attacked me a few days ago,

58
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,811
suddenly, without warning.

59
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,226
That's how I injured my leg.

60
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:19,478
- Yes.

61
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,907
Working with the mentally disturbed

62
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,989
can lead to a breakdown.

63
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,452
- The nurse and orderly
managed to transfer Dr. Starr

64
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,867
upstairs with the other patients.

65
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:34,455
I can't go there.

66
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:37,496
The orderly gives me reports.

67
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:41,634
He says the doctor is
perfectly rational now.

68
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,464
Except for one thing.

69
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:48,507
A new personality seems
to have taken over.

70
00:05:49,758 --> 00:05:52,762
With its own name and its own life story.

71
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,976
- These terrible feud.

72
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:57,767
- Meaningless labor, don't you think?

73
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,686
- It describes something that exists.

74
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:03,356
From time to time, a man disappears

75
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:06,491
and his discovered much later
living in a different town,

76
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:09,198
under a different name,
following a different occupation

77
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,454
because something happened
in his earlier life

78
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,706
that made it completely intolerable.

79
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:18,087
- You believe you could
recognize such a case?

80
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,371
- I'm certain of it.

81
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:21,006
- Very well.

82
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,338
We'll call it a test.

83
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,627
There are several patients upstairs

84
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,014
with the sort of condition you describe.

85
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,599
Go up there.

86
00:06:31,883 --> 00:06:33,135
Talk to them.

87
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:36,897
If you can recognize
who is or was Dr. Starr

88
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:42,983
then I'll consider you
qualified for the position.

89
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,147
- I will recognize him.

90
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,065
- Him?

91
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,323
How do you know the doc is a man?

92
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,129
Reynolds?

93
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:06,669
- [Reynolds] Yes, doctor?

94
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,303
- Reynolds,

95
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:11,215
I'm sending a young man upstairs.

96
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:12,177
Martin.

97
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,183
Dr. Martin.

98
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:16,686
Now listen to me carefully.

99
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,519
(menacing music)

100
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:25,349
(door buzzing)

101
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:29,361
- Dr. Martin'?

102
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:31,396
I'm Max Reynolds, the orderly.

103
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:32,689
- I'm pleased to meet you.

104
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:34,107
- Come this way.

105
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:39,408
It keeps out the draft,

106
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:41,744
<i>as</i> Dr. Starr used to say.

107
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:43,500
- You know why I'm here?

108
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,082
- Dr. Rutherford gave
me full instructions.

109
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,212
- What can you tell me about the doctor?

110
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:49,794
- Who? Rutherford?

111
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:52,209
- Starr.

112
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,673
- Nothing.

113
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,931
You are to be given full
cooperation but no clues.

114
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,885
- [Martin] Are all these rooms occupied?

115
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,302
- Yes.

116
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:04,096
We keep them locked, of course.

117
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:06,014
A security measure.

118
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,310
- This one isn't.
- [Reynolds] It's my office.

119
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:11,820
- Are the patients free
to move around at all?

120
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:13,104
- They're not to badly off.

121
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:14,522
You'll see for yourself.

122
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:15,566
- First patient.

123
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:16,403
- Mhmm.

124
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:17,943
- Name'?

125
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:20,283
- She calls herself Bonnie.

126
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:22,706
- B. Starr.

127
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,206
- That's a question for you to decide.

128
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,869
(keys clanking)

129
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,503
J1 We're having

130
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:32,712
J1 Tea in the afternoon J1

131
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,215
(knocking)

132
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,301
(door opening)

133
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:39,714
- Hello, Bonnie.

134
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:41,633
Bonnie?

135
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:43,639
Come along.

136
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:46,146
Here's Dr. Martin to see you.

137
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,561
- Leave me alone.

138
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,480
- I was hoping I could talk to you.

139
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:55,613
- Talk?

140
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:56,944
(giggling)

141
00:10:57,232 --> 00:11:00,202
That's all you people ever do is talk.

142
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:01,532
Nobody listens.

143
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:03,993
- I listen too.

144
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:08,164
- You wouldn't believe me.

145
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:11,751
- Perhaps not, but I am willing to listen.

146
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:14,962
(birds chirping)

147
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,126
- Well,

148
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:18,887
if it makes any difference.

149
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,719
(birds chirping)

150
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:27,062
- [Man] I hope to God we
get to the airport on time.

151
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:28,437
- For the last time Walter,

152
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,144
there's nothing to worry about.

153
00:11:30,432 --> 00:11:31,399
Did it arrive?

154
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:32,354
- Yes it did.

155
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:34,440
They finished installing
it about an hour ago.

156
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,105
- [Bonnie] There's nothing to worry about.

157
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,613
- It's easy enough for you to say, Bonnie,

158
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,491
but supposing something goes wrong?

159
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:41,868
- It can't go wrong, not
if you follow the plan.

160
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,745
- I'll follow it.

161
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,202
If only I could see you first.

162
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:48,912
- You'll see me soon enough.

163
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,202
I'll be waiting for you once it's over.

164
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:53,371
- [Walter] I'll ring you.

165
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,385
(door thudding)

166
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:43,422
- Walter?

167
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:46,883
You're home early.

168
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:49,849
- I didn't get into town today.

169
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,604
- But you did get into the brandy.

170
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:53,686
- This happens to be my first drink.

171
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,692
- Not your last, I'm sure.

172
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,193
- May I fix you one?

173
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,444
- Yes, please.

174
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,948
- How did your class go?

175
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,279
- It's not a class.

176
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:06,069
Professor Kalanga is a spiritual leader.

177
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:07,487
- Professor.

178
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,497
Back in Africa he'd be
just another witch doctor.

179
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:11,158
- What do you know about it?

180
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:13,918
Don't forget, I lived there for years.

181
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:15,078
- After all, my father was--

182
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,919
- Governor General of the colony.

183
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:20,758
It's a good thing he can't
see his daughter now.

184
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,136
The poor old boy would turn in his grave.

185
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,469
Taking voodoo <i>lessons</i>
from a black charlatan.

186
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:28,133
- It is not voodoo.

187
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:32,930
There are natural forces
which are stronger

188
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,598
than life or death.

189
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:38,276
Forces which modern,
civilized man has forgotten.

190
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,235
- I wish you'd forget
all of this mumbo-jumbo.

191
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,318
What's that?

192
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:46,860
- It's called a wanga.

193
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,571
- I think it's revolting.

194
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,331
- It's not supposed to be pretty.

195
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:55,414
The serpent is a symbol of the life force

196
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:59,707
and the teeth are to
protect one from evil.

197
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:02,046
- There's no evil in your life.

198
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,710
- Oh, but there is.

199
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:06,926
- What do you mean?

200
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:07,839
- Bonnie.

201
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:15,602
- That's all over and
done with, I swear it.

202
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,564
- Only last month you came
and asked me for a divorce.

203
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:21,068
- I haven't seen her since.

204
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:23,104
You have my word on that.

205
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,943
- I'm glad you haven't

206
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,030
because I told you then
and I'm telling you now,

207
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:30,366
there won't be any divorce.

208
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,372
Oh, I know you, Walter.

209
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:39,879
You're a weak, vein, selfish opportunist.

210
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,379
You're content to live off my money,

211
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,792
but you are mine

212
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,597
and I will never let you go.

213
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:50,507
Never.

214
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,769
Now you do understand that, don't you?

215
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:55,849
- Perfectly.

216
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,692
(Ruth chuckling)

217
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,606
Darling,

218
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:10,569
I've got a present for you.

219
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,486
" Oh?

220
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,488
What is it?

221
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,656
- You'll see.

222
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:19,369
Come along with me.

223
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,374
- I don't see anything.

224
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,918
- Downstairs.

225
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,086
- In the basement?

226
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:29,174
- After you.

227
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:32,800
Careful now, mind the steps.

228
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,645
- Well?

229
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:38,600
What is it?

230
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:41,103
Oh, darling.

231
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:44,565
It's a freezer.

232
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,486
- Do you like it?

233
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:50,650
- Oh, you know I've always wanted one.

234
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:52,785
What a lovely surprise.

235
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,446
- I have another one for you.

236
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:55,283
- What is it?

237
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:56,198
- This.

238
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:00,160
(screaming)

239
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:03,079
(freezer buzzing)

240
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:07,550
(ominous music)

241
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:19,058
(thudding)

242
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,885
(paper rustling)

243
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:32,381
(water sloshing)

244
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:49,310
(bucket clunking)

245
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:17,551
(doorbell ringing)

246
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:22,640
(doorknob jiggling)

247
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:58,596
(paper rustling)

248
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:16,481
(freezer buzzing)

249
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:34,211
(bracelet jingling)

250
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:47,307
Rest in pieces.

251
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,570
(phone ringing)

252
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:04,616
" Yes?

253
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,622
- [Walter] It's finished.

254
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:07,873
- Good.

255
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:08,874
Are you all right?

256
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:11,752
- Yeah. How soon can you get here?

257
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:12,707
- I'm just packing.

258
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,793
I should be there within the hour.

259
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,207
- I'll be ready.

260
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,090
- One more thing, Walter.

261
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:21,925
We'll have to take her along.

262
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:23,715
- Why? There's no need for that.

263
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:25,633
No one's gonna check up while we're away.

264
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,848
- I'll be safer if there's
nothing left behind.

265
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:30,639
They may still suspect,
but they'll have no proof.

266
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,774
We'll dispose of the evidence
on the way to the airport.

267
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,150
- We can't talk about it on the phone.

268
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,607
We'll talk when you're here.

269
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:39,192
For God sake, don't let anyone see you.

270
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,697
- I'll bring my car around to the back

271
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:42,029
and I'll keep the kitchen door unlocked

272
00:20:42,316 --> 00:20:43,693
so I won't have to knock.

273
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:45,032
- All right but hurry.

274
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,662
The sooner we're out of here, the better.

275
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:47,663
- [Bonnie] Be right there.

276
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,244
- I'll be waiting.

277
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:11,100
(locks clicking)

278
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,666
(thudding)

279
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,594
(paper rustling)

280
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:08,069
(glass shattering)

281
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,910
(water dripping)

282
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,962
(ominous music)

283
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,853
(door squeaking)

284
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,659
(freezer buzzing)

285
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:32,786
(intense music)

286
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,038
(gagging)

287
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,636
(car engine rumbling)

288
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,264
(car door slamming)

289
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,561
- Walter?

290
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:16,906
Walter'?

291
00:24:17,948 --> 00:24:19,291
(door clicking)

292
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:21,498
(door squealing)

293
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:24,084
(eerie music)

294
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:34,219
(door squealing)

295
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:46,978
Walter'?

296
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:52,908
(ominous music)

297
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:12,128
Walter'?

298
00:25:41,782 --> 00:25:43,329
(eerie music)

299
00:25:43,617 --> 00:25:45,585
(gasping)

300
00:25:46,996 --> 00:25:49,590
(ominous music)

301
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:56,347
(door squealing)

302
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,758
(screaming)

303
00:26:02,553 --> 00:26:04,806
(breathing)

304
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:14,486
(rustling)

305
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:18,910
(unsettling music)

306
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:35,136
(gasping)

307
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:37,888
(ominous music)

308
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,739
(jiggling)

309
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:04,998
(intense music)

310
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:08,957
(thudding)

311
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,222
(thudding)

312
00:27:37,106 --> 00:27:39,700
(intense music)

313
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:13,942
(ominous music)

314
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,815
(screaming)

315
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:29,034
They found me lying
there the next morning.

316
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:32,124
They said I'd strangled Walter.

317
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,789
I tried to tell them about Ruth

318
00:28:36,123 --> 00:28:37,124
and the hand.

319
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:39,919
But it was gone.

320
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:43,889
Everything was gone.

321
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:50,305
But the hand was on my face.

322
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,184
I chopped

323
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,570
and chopped

324
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,028
and chopped at it.

325
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:09,156
(giggling)

326
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,951
(eerie music)

327
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:14,461
Now do you believe me?

328
00:29:14,745 --> 00:29:15,371
No?

329
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:20,293
(giggling)

330
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:24,881
(humming tune)

331
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:29,430
- Paranoid psychosis.

332
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:32,312
How did she come to the asylum?

333
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:33,939
- She could have come as a doctor.

334
00:29:34,223 --> 00:29:35,315
- And the wife?

335
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,649
- You'll learn the real cases
when you've made your choice.

336
00:29:39,937 --> 00:29:43,862
That's the service lift from the kitchen.

337
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,071
- The next patient?

338
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,827
- His name is Bruno.

339
00:29:49,113 --> 00:29:49,864
Bruno?

340
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:53,117
This is Dr. Martin.

341
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,843
- What are you making?

342
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:08,599
- Whatever you like.

343
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:12,477
- Could it be a surgical gown?

344
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:15,139
- I can make whatever you wish.

345
00:30:16,974 --> 00:30:17,816
It could be

346
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:20,189
a surgical gown...

347
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:24,194
or a shroud.

348
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,571
I'm a tailor.

349
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:34,541
- Doctors can sew.

350
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:35,451
Stitch.

351
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,713
- Always been a tailor.

352
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:44,881
Always.

353
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:47,638
(steam hissing)

354
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:53,139
(thudding)

355
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,855
(entry bell ringing)

356
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:05,773
- Oh, Mr. Stebbins.

357
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:06,941
Good evening.

358
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:11,866
- It's the first of the month.

359
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:13,246
The rent is due.

360
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:18,536
Mr. Stebbins, I've got a wonderful idea.

361
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:19,578
- Have you got the rent?

362
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,417
- Every month you come here

363
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:25,084
and always you are wearing the same suit.

364
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:26,547
- Nothing wrong with my suit.

365
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:27,381
Gives me good wear.

366
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:28,841
- Wear, yes.

367
00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:30,096
But style, no.

368
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,225
Now listen.

369
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:38,060
For one month's rent, I could
make for you such a suit.

370
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:39,599
- I don't need a suit.

371
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,110
And if I did, I wouldn't get it from you.

372
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,321
- I haven't got it.

373
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:51,326
- Now see here--

374
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,236
- No, no, no.

375
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:53,404
You see here.

376
00:31:55,072 --> 00:31:56,494
You see this shop.

377
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:00,953
Fine people used to come here

378
00:32:01,245 --> 00:32:03,293
for fine tailoring.

379
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,175
Now a little dressing, a little mending.

380
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,426
It's all I get.

381
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,257
I will pay the rent,

382
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:13,800
but you must give me a little more time.

383
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:15,308
- I'll tell you what,

384
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:17,686
today's Monday, right?

385
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,893
I'll be back here on Saturday morning.

386
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,477
- Saturday morning?

387
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:22,812
- Bright and early.

388
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,852
And if you haven't got the rent,

389
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,771
you can start packing.

390
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:31,991
(bell ringing)

391
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:33,243
No tricks now.

392
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,992
- No tricks.

393
00:32:37,573 --> 00:32:40,326
(bell ringing)

394
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:41,743
- [Woman] Your supper, it's ready.

395
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:43,252
- I'm not hungry.

396
00:32:44,872 --> 00:32:46,499
- Something is wrong?

397
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,508
- Not something, Anna,

398
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:53,513
everything.

399
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:56,550
Mr. Stebbins was here.

400
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,428
He's giving us one week.

401
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,643
A man works hard all his life

402
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,728
and then, in one week...

403
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:07,186
Where can we go?

404
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:10,230
(entry bell ringing)

405
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,991
(ominous music)

406
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,034
- Good evening.

407
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,866
Is the proprietor in?

408
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,119
- I am the proprietor.

409
00:33:28,415 --> 00:33:30,918
(bell ringing)

410
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,560
Go have your supper.

411
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:45,557
Now,

412
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:48,318
what can I do for you, Mister...

413
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,145
- Smith.

414
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,982
Am I correct in assuming

415
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:55,776
that you can tailor a
garment from any material

416
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,536
of my own selection?

417
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,743
- You want I should make you a suit?

418
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:01,623
(chuckling)

419
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:02,533
- Exactly.

420
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,419
- I have a fine stock of woolens here.

421
00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:08,296
- That will not be necessary.

422
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,082
(clicking)

423
00:34:10,374 --> 00:34:13,093
I brought my own material.

424
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:14,003
- I see.

425
00:34:15,003 --> 00:34:18,633
You will be wanting something special.

426
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:19,550
- Correct.

427
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:23,099
Something very special.

428
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:28,939
There's enough here for a suit, I believe.

429
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:29,852
- Unusual.

430
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:34,903
- Special.

431
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:39,240
- It will be difficult to
work from such a fabric,

432
00:34:39,528 --> 00:34:41,747
but I can promise you a suit.

433
00:34:42,823 --> 00:34:45,042
Now if you will just slip off your coat

434
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:46,827
so I can make measure.

435
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,871
- The suit is not for me.

436
00:34:49,162 --> 00:34:50,254
It is for my son.

437
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:51,586
- Oh.

438
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:55,093
When will he come in for a fitting?

439
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:56,879
- It's to be a surprise.

440
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,013
- Oh, a present.

441
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:01,471
- You might call it that.

442
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:05,479
I've written down all the measurements.

443
00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:08,481
Made various diagrams of the style.

444
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:11,484
(foreboding music)

445
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,781
- Expensive.

446
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:17,691
- Then you'll have to
charge me accordingly.

447
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,860
Shall we say, 200 pounds?

448
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:22,454
- 200?

449
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,417
I will begin immediately.

450
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:28,623
- No.

451
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,412
This schedule.

452
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:32,502
It is of the greatest importance

453
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:34,132
that you work on the suit

454
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:37,044
only during the hours listed here.

455
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,172
(clock chiming)

456
00:35:40,464 --> 00:35:42,182
- But these times,

457
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:45,060
they're all past midnight.

458
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,597
- I happen to believe in astrology.

459
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:48,935
- The stars?

460
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:51,645
- I take it you are not a believer?

461
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:52,525
No matter.

462
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:54,152
All that concerns you

463
00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:58,157
is following these
instructions to the letter.

464
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,657
There must be no mistake.

465
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:00,863
Is that clear?

466
00:36:01,151 --> 00:36:02,494
No mistake.

467
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:05,327
- Everything will be as you wish.

468
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:07,074
I swear.

469
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:09,497
- You'll find my address written

470
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:11,662
on the top of the first sheet.

471
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:13,580
When may I have delivery?

472
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,089
- Um.

473
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,842
Today is Monday.

474
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,844
If I start tonight I'll...

475
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:21,050
Yeah.

476
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:24,057
I can bring you the suit on Friday.

477
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:26,643
- Excellent.

478
00:36:26,927 --> 00:36:30,477
I shall expect you the
moment it is finished.

479
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:34,310
(bell ringing)

480
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:36,812
Remember,

481
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:38,901
my instructions.

482
00:36:39,189 --> 00:36:40,315
- Oh, I promise.

483
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:42,405
- Goodnight.

484
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:49,875
(bell ringing)

485
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,635
- Who was that man?

486
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:01,920
- Customer.

487
00:37:02,212 --> 00:37:03,930
He ordered a suit.

488
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:05,887
200 pounds he will pay.

489
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,222
- Now I'm afraid.

490
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:11,180
There is something not
right in all of this.

491
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:13,974
Something that will make you trouble.

492
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:15,813
- I must do it.

493
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,195
(ominous music)

494
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:20,947
(clock chiming)

495
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,924
(clock ticking)

496
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,353
(clock chiming)

497
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:04,408
(sighing)

498
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,167
(groaning)

499
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,714
- What is it?

500
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:23,627
- Ugh.

501
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:28,974
The instructions said
to work to five o'clock.

502
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:33,353
I tried to work a little longer.

503
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:38,646
(eerie music)

504
00:38:56,493 --> 00:38:59,087
(clock ticking)

505
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:15,562
- It is finished?

506
00:39:15,845 --> 00:39:18,064
- I'm the one who's finished.

507
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:20,938
Four nights.

508
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,944
Nothing but work.

509
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,447
Midnight to just before dawn.

510
00:39:28,108 --> 00:39:29,325
Now it's done.

511
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:30,656
- May I see it?

512
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:36,787
(gasping)

513
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,201
- It is strange.

514
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:41,125
You're going to press it'?

515
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:41,959
- No, no.

516
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,170
Mr. Smith doesn't want it pressed.

517
00:39:44,457 --> 00:39:45,549
- Then what will you do?

518
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:46,380
- Deliver it,

519
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:47,590
just as he said.

520
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:48,969
Right now.

521
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,723
(ominous music)

522
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,644
(car engine puttering)

523
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:23,876
(eerie music)

524
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:45,727
(bell ringing)

525
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:53,322
(door locks jiggling)

526
00:40:58,406 --> 00:40:59,783
- At last.

527
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:01,918
Did you bring it?

528
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:03,169
Ah, good!

529
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:04,670
Come in! Come in!

530
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,758
(eerie music)

531
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:17,717
This way.

532
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,191
Another two steps down.

533
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:32,607
In here.

534
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:36,278
My study.

535
00:41:47,122 --> 00:41:48,669
The suit is completed?

536
00:41:48,957 --> 00:41:50,254
- Oh yes.

537
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:54,513
It was difficult working
with such material

538
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:56,343
and at night, no less.

539
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:58,224
- But you followed the instructions?

540
00:41:58,508 --> 00:42:00,806
- Just as you ordered.

541
00:42:01,094 --> 00:42:01,811
- Splendid.

542
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,724
You have no idea how much this means to me

543
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:07,232
and to my son.

544
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:08,234
- Your son.

545
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:10,441
Where is he?

546
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:13,022
- Nevermind.

547
00:42:13,314 --> 00:42:14,987
Now if I may see the suit.

548
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:15,901
- Um.

549
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,078
- Yes, of course, your fee.

550
00:42:19,362 --> 00:42:21,865
Just send me your account
and I'll take care of it.

551
00:42:22,157 --> 00:42:24,706
- I must have the money first.

552
00:42:24,993 --> 00:42:26,461
I have bills to pay.

553
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,919
You wouldn't understand.

554
00:42:30,206 --> 00:42:31,708
You're rich.

555
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,252
- On the contrary.

556
00:42:33,543 --> 00:42:36,137
I understand the situation only too well.

557
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:38,423
It so happens, at the moment,

558
00:42:38,715 --> 00:42:41,514
I'm in the same financial
position <i>as</i> yourself.

559
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:43,144
" You?

560
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,271
- Don't misunderstand.

561
00:42:45,555 --> 00:42:48,855
In a very short while, I
shall be in funds again.

562
00:42:49,142 --> 00:42:51,520
Just as soon as my son returns.

563
00:42:52,812 --> 00:42:53,984
- Your diamond.

564
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:56,149
- This?

565
00:42:58,067 --> 00:42:58,989
It's a fake.

566
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,906
It was real once,

567
00:43:03,198 --> 00:43:04,745
but I had to dispose of it

568
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:07,832
in order to continue my work.

569
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:08,836
My <i>studies.</i>

570
00:43:09,913 --> 00:43:10,664
This book.

571
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:16,920
It's very old.

572
00:43:17,212 --> 00:43:17,838
Very rare.

573
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:23,101
The only one of its
kind left in the world.

574
00:43:23,384 --> 00:43:25,307
Cost me my fortune.

575
00:43:25,595 --> 00:43:28,599
- You gave all your money for a book?

576
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:29,857
<i>_</i> Every penny.

577
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,523
I needed it because of my son.

578
00:43:34,604 --> 00:43:36,857
I sold everything to buy it.

579
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,490
- You're lying.

580
00:43:40,777 --> 00:43:42,199
- See for yourself.

581
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:44,160
There is nothing left.

582
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:48,202
- What is in that room?

583
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:50,370
- That room is empty too.

584
00:43:51,538 --> 00:43:53,040
There is nothing in there, I tell you!

585
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,583
Please!

586
00:43:54,874 --> 00:43:57,593
(foreboding music)

587
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,021
- So that's it.

588
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,562
You're a murderer.

589
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:18,398
- No.

590
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:20,818
I'm no murderer.

591
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:24,492
He died a natural death.

592
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,449
I knew a long time ago

593
00:44:28,408 --> 00:44:30,251
that it was inevitable.

594
00:44:32,912 --> 00:44:34,004
Can't you see?

595
00:44:35,123 --> 00:44:36,295
This is my son.

596
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:42,972
- Your son?

597
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:45,884
- He was the one I was working for,

598
00:44:46,175 --> 00:44:47,552
planning for.

599
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:49,642
The book told me what to do.

600
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:51,806
That's why I had you make the suit.

601
00:44:52,098 --> 00:44:53,065
It is for him.

602
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:55,439
Give it to me.

603
00:44:57,437 --> 00:44:58,233
- No.

604
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:00,816
First, the money.

605
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:08,994
(gasping)

606
00:45:09,282 --> 00:45:11,080
- You can't stop me now.

607
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:14,336
No one can stop me now.

608
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,088
Give me that suit.

609
00:45:23,046 --> 00:45:24,844
(intense music)

610
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:27,179
(thudding)

611
00:45:52,492 --> 00:45:55,245
(gunshot booming)

612
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,613
(entry bell ringing)

613
00:46:30,905 --> 00:46:33,374
(door slamming)

614
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,756
- You sold the suit?

615
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:42,834
- No.

616
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:46,380
- Mr. Stebbins phoned just after you left.

617
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,218
He said to remind you
he's coming for his rent

618
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:49,598
in the morning.

619
00:46:49,882 --> 00:46:50,758
I told him is was all right.

620
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,052
You were collecting money
from a customer tonight.

621
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:54,391
- You told him!

622
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:59,185
Anna, I asked you not to say
a word about this to anyone!

623
00:46:59,475 --> 00:47:01,068
Burn! Burn! Burn it!

624
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:04,196
Put it in the stew and burn it!

625
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,107
Forget about the suit.

626
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:08,026
Forget I ever made the suit.

627
00:47:08,317 --> 00:47:09,534
Forget about Mr. Smith.

628
00:47:09,819 --> 00:47:10,741
Forget everything!

629
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:11,575
- But--

630
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:12,489
- Burn it!

631
00:47:14,907 --> 00:47:18,207
(ominous music)

632
00:47:18,494 --> 00:47:19,871
A fortune, he said.

633
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:38,310
(metal clinking)

634
00:47:44,604 --> 00:47:47,027
(eerie music)

635
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:57,583
(foreboding music)

636
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:03,081
No fire.

637
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:12,264
- I don't know what we will do now.

638
00:48:12,548 --> 00:48:14,095
Once they see how you look

639
00:48:14,383 --> 00:48:16,477
perhaps they will come in.

640
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:19,230
(ominous music)

641
00:48:25,228 --> 00:48:27,731
- I told you to burn the suit.

642
00:48:28,022 --> 00:48:29,490
- I put it on Otto.

643
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:30,570
- Otto?

644
00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:33,156
- I made a name for him.

645
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:35,742
I talk to him often, when I am alone.

646
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,077
- Anna, please,

647
00:48:37,365 --> 00:48:38,912
burn the suit.

648
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,167
- I thought--

649
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:43,705
- No one must ever know it existed.

650
00:48:43,996 --> 00:48:45,168
- Mr. Smith knows.

651
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:47,458
- Mr. Smith is dead.

652
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,376
- Dead?

653
00:48:50,878 --> 00:48:52,050
- I killed him.

654
00:48:53,548 --> 00:48:57,598
It was an accident, but
no one will believe that.

655
00:48:57,885 --> 00:48:59,979
- What is that book?

656
00:49:00,263 --> 00:49:01,731
- Mr. Smith had it.

657
00:49:02,014 --> 00:49:04,233
It is a book of magic.

658
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:07,020
There's a spell for making the suit.

659
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,609
The book, too, must be burned.

660
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:12,526
- No.

661
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:13,864
- What do you mean?

662
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:15,028
- Don't you see?

663
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:17,367
If you have the book you
can show it to the police.

664
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:18,827
Tell them what happened.

665
00:49:19,115 --> 00:49:20,662
Then they will believe
you speak the truth.

666
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,873
- What do you know from the police?

667
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:25,584
- Bruno, please, for my sake,
tell them what happened.

668
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:26,919
<i>"</i> No!

669
00:49:27,206 --> 00:49:28,128
- Then I'll tell them!

670
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:29,918
We can not live with murder on our souls!

671
00:49:30,209 --> 00:49:31,631
- Anna! No!

672
00:49:31,919 --> 00:49:32,590
No!

673
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:33,425
No, Anna!

674
00:49:33,713 --> 00:49:35,841
(Anna screaming)

675
00:49:36,132 --> 00:49:38,681
(menacing music)

676
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:46,942
- Let go of me, Bruno!

677
00:49:47,226 --> 00:49:49,649
(intense music)

678
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:00,494
- No, Anna!

679
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:01,873
<i>"</i> No!

680
00:50:02,158 --> 00:50:03,250
(screaming)

681
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:04,330
Otto!

682
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:05,245
- Oh God!

683
00:50:06,996 --> 00:50:09,090
(gagging)

684
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:15,592
You must find him.

685
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,599
Somewhere in the city, he is alive.

686
00:50:21,177 --> 00:50:23,100
I tell you, he is alive!

687
00:50:25,932 --> 00:50:28,606
(keys jingling)

688
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:31,442
(Bruno sobbing)

689
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:34,198
(lock clicking)

690
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:36,985
- How did it happen?

691
00:50:37,276 --> 00:50:38,368
- You know I can't tell you.

692
00:50:38,653 --> 00:50:39,495
Not yet.

693
00:50:39,779 --> 00:50:41,907
- Not until I've made my choice.

694
00:50:42,198 --> 00:50:44,826
- Dr. Rutherford's orders.

695
00:50:45,117 --> 00:50:46,414
- All right.

696
00:50:46,702 --> 00:50:48,124
Who's next?

697
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:49,959
- A strange case.

698
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:51,716
A very strange case.

699
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:55,636
Her name is Barbara.

700
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,514
(knocking)

701
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:00,266
- How good of you to come.

702
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:02,643
You're the lawyer, aren't you?

703
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:05,430
- No, I'm sorry. I'm afraid not.

704
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:07,143
- But I asked to see a lawyer.

705
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,648
I told you to send for one.

706
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,480
- This is Dr. Martin.

707
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:13,446
- Another doctor?

708
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,824
But I'm not ill, you can see that.

709
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:18,860
A lawyer would know it wasn't my fault.

710
00:51:19,151 --> 00:51:21,279
- I haven't accused you of anything.

711
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:23,197
- All doctors are alike.

712
00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:26,288
- How can you be so sure about that?

713
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:28,289
- I happen to know a great deal

714
00:51:28,577 --> 00:51:31,046
about the medical profession.

715
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,877
- That's interesting.

716
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:37,177
Did you study medicine yourself?

717
00:51:38,212 --> 00:51:40,180
- You ask too many questions.

718
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,966
- It's only because I want to help you.

719
00:51:42,258 --> 00:51:44,010
- Then get me out of here.

720
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:44,928
It wasn't my fault.

721
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:47,347
You've got to understand that.

722
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,766
I had nothing to do with it.

723
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:52,439
It was Lucy.

724
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,979
- Tell me about it.

725
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:01,152
- All right.

726
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:07,333
All right.

727
00:52:07,616 --> 00:52:10,085
(ominous music)

728
00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:14,878
(pleasant music)

729
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:23,432
- How do you feel, Barbara?

730
00:52:23,716 --> 00:52:24,808
You look marvelous.

731
00:52:25,092 --> 00:52:26,719
- I feel fine.

732
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:28,388
George, if you only
know how wonderful it is

733
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:30,397
to be coming home again.

734
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,275
- Listen, I hope you are
going to be very, very happy.

735
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:34,685
- Of course I will.

736
00:52:34,977 --> 00:52:36,979
Don't worry, it's not going
to be like the last time.

737
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:39,114
That's all over with now.

738
00:52:39,398 --> 00:52:40,445
I'm sure of it.

739
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:42,318
- Good.

740
00:52:43,986 --> 00:52:45,738
Nearly there now.

741
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,408
(somber music)

742
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,215
(birds chirping)

743
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,029
(ominous music)

744
00:53:19,313 --> 00:53:20,189
What's the matter?

745
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:21,027
- I don't know.

746
00:53:21,315 --> 00:53:23,909
I could swear I saw someone
looking out of the window.

747
00:53:24,193 --> 00:53:25,695
I thought for a moment it might be Lucy.

748
00:53:25,986 --> 00:53:27,533
- Now remember what you
promised at the hospital.

749
00:53:27,822 --> 00:53:29,244
You are not to mention her name again.

750
00:53:29,532 --> 00:53:30,408
- Yes, I know, I'm sorry.

751
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:31,746
But there is someone inside, isn't there?

752
00:53:32,034 --> 00:53:32,830
- Yes.

753
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:33,665
- Who is it?

754
00:53:33,953 --> 00:53:35,330
- You'll soon see.

755
00:53:35,621 --> 00:53:36,417
- Who is it?

756
00:53:36,705 --> 00:53:37,831
- Ah, Nurse Higgins.

757
00:53:38,124 --> 00:53:39,626
This is my sister, Barbara.

758
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:40,463
- Hello.

759
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:42,970
I've heard so much about you.

760
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,514
- Nurse? I don't need a nurse.

761
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:48,221
- Now it's only temporary
until you get settled in again.

762
00:53:48,509 --> 00:53:49,260
The doctor suggested--

763
00:53:49,552 --> 00:53:50,519
- Here, I'll take that, sir.

764
00:53:50,803 --> 00:53:52,771
Shall we go upstairs now'?

765
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:54,432
- Upstairs?

766
00:53:54,723 --> 00:53:56,100
- You can pop right into bed.

767
00:53:56,392 --> 00:53:57,735
- Bed?

768
00:53:58,018 --> 00:53:59,235
In the middle of the afternoon?

769
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,817
- Well, you've had quite a long trip.

770
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:02,732
You must rest.

771
00:54:03,023 --> 00:54:04,616
- But I'm not in the least bit tired.

772
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,073
- Now, Barbara, you promised me, remember?

773
00:54:07,361 --> 00:54:11,537
You are to follow the
doctor's instructions.

774
00:54:11,824 --> 00:54:13,041
- This is my home.

775
00:54:13,325 --> 00:54:14,042
- Our home!

776
00:54:15,244 --> 00:54:18,498
And I hope that we'll be
together here, always.

777
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:21,633
You don't want to go back
into hospital, do you?

778
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:22,634
- No.

779
00:54:22,918 --> 00:54:24,295
You wouldn't.

780
00:54:24,587 --> 00:54:27,807
- I sincerely hope it won't be necessary.

781
00:54:28,757 --> 00:54:30,259
- Come along, dear.

782
00:54:32,595 --> 00:54:35,439
- Aren't you going to come up?

783
00:54:35,723 --> 00:54:36,349
- Later.

784
00:54:53,908 --> 00:54:56,411
- I still think it's ridiculous
going to bed at this hour.

785
00:54:56,702 --> 00:54:58,670
- Doctor says you need a
nap every day before tea

786
00:54:58,954 --> 00:54:59,796
to keep your strength up.

787
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,252
- But I'll never sleep.

788
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,918
- Here, you're to drink this.

789
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:04,881
- What is it?

790
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:06,967
- Only a sedative, dear,
to calm your nerves.

791
00:55:07,254 --> 00:55:08,597
- I am calm.

792
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:10,633
Perfectly calm.

793
00:55:10,925 --> 00:55:12,177
If I could just have one of my pills.

794
00:55:12,468 --> 00:55:16,348
- Now we're not to have
any more of those things.

795
00:55:19,642 --> 00:55:20,859
That's better.

796
00:55:21,143 --> 00:55:22,110
Now, in we go.

797
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,111
All comfy.

798
00:55:40,788 --> 00:55:41,914
Try to sleep now

799
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:44,504
and I'll look in on you a little later on.

800
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:48,137
Tonight, after dinner,
we'll have a nice chat.

801
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,548
- You'll be staying here
in the evenings too?

802
00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:51,886
- Of course I will.

803
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:56,145
And your brother's given me
the room right next to yours.

804
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:04,695
(phone ringing)

805
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,114
- Hello?

806
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:10,117
Yes, would you hold on a minute please?

807
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:12,529
Nurse Higgins, it's for you.

808
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:17,450
- Thank you.

809
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:18,788
Hello, yes?

810
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:20,043
Yes, speaking.

811
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:22,330
Oh no.

812
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:25,504
Where did you say?

813
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:27,919
Train Cross Hospital?

814
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:28,836
No danger?

815
00:56:30,504 --> 00:56:31,255
She's 78.

816
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:35,393
I'll come at once, <i>as</i> soon as I can.

817
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:37,223
- Nurse Higgins, is anything the matter?

818
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:38,558
- It's my mother.

819
00:56:38,846 --> 00:56:40,063
I'm afraid she's had an accident.

820
00:56:40,347 --> 00:56:41,564
I must go to her.

821
00:56:42,516 --> 00:56:44,143
- What about my sister?

822
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:45,732
- I put her to bed under sedation.

823
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,613
She'll sleep for hours.

824
00:56:47,896 --> 00:56:49,523
- Look, there's a train in 20 minutes.

825
00:56:49,815 --> 00:56:50,907
I'll run you to the station.

826
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:51,737
- Thank you.

827
00:56:52,026 --> 00:56:53,152
<i>I'll</i> get my b39-

828
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:57,873
(ominous music)

829
00:57:05,873 --> 00:57:09,047
(care engine starting)

830
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,729
(somber music)

831
00:57:56,465 --> 00:57:59,059
(ominous music)

832
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,323
(eerie music)

833
00:58:30,582 --> 00:58:31,674
- Hello, love.

834
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,711
<i>. Lucy-</i>

835
00:58:35,587 --> 00:58:37,260
How did you get in here?

836
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:39,266
- It wasn't easy.

837
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,518
I've been waiting ever
since you came home.

838
00:58:41,802 --> 00:58:42,519
- Where?

839
00:58:42,803 --> 00:58:43,725
- In the garage.

840
00:58:44,012 --> 00:58:45,605
That's where I phoned in from.

841
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:46,685
- Phoned'?

842
00:58:46,974 --> 00:58:49,068
- To get them out of the house.

843
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:53,322
I knew he'd be gentlemen enough
to drive her to the station.

844
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:56,533
Well?

845
00:58:56,817 --> 00:58:58,114
Aren't you glad to see me?

846
00:58:58,402 --> 00:58:59,654
- Of course I am.

847
00:58:59,945 --> 00:59:01,447
What if he finds you here?

848
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:02,410
- I know.

849
00:59:02,698 --> 00:59:05,668
That's why we have to work quickly.

850
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:07,123
- I don't understand.

851
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:08,207
- Obviously.

852
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:10,835
What's the matter?

853
00:59:11,123 --> 00:59:13,626
- Nothing, I just feel a little faint.

854
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,760
- Have you been taking those pills again?

855
00:59:16,044 --> 00:59:17,341
<i>"</i> No!

856
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:19,506
No, that's all over with.

857
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:21,141
- He doesn't trust you, does he?

858
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:23,393
Shutting you up like
this in a darkened room.

859
00:59:23,677 --> 00:59:25,145
Bringing in a nurse.

860
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:29,142
She's not your nurse, you know.

861
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:31,106
She's your guard.

862
00:59:31,393 --> 00:59:32,189
Your keeper.

863
00:59:33,562 --> 00:59:36,065
- But George wouldn't
do a thing like that.

864
00:59:36,356 --> 00:59:37,573
- Oh wouldn't he?

865
00:59:40,027 --> 00:59:41,620
Who owns this house?

866
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,077
- Why, I do.

867
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:46,958
When father died he let everything to me.

868
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:50,416
- And if something happened to you?

869
00:59:50,704 --> 00:59:52,832
Suppose George has you put away for good?

870
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:54,090
- He wouldn't.

871
00:59:57,252 --> 00:59:58,174
He couldn't.

872
00:59:59,213 --> 01:00:01,762
- All he has to do is to tell the doctors

873
01:00:02,049 --> 01:00:03,972
that you are too difficult
to control at home.

874
01:00:04,259 --> 01:00:05,602
That nurse will back him up.

875
01:00:05,886 --> 01:00:07,513
- But you know that's not true.

876
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:09,682
- And what good does that do?

877
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:12,146
George won't listen to me.

878
01:00:12,434 --> 01:00:13,981
He doesn't even like you to see me.

879
01:00:14,269 --> 01:00:15,771
That's so, isn't it?

880
01:00:16,063 --> 01:00:16,689
Isn't it'?!

881
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:28,538
- What're we going to do?

882
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:30,419
- I've got to get you away from here

883
01:00:30,702 --> 01:00:32,875
and we haven't got much time.

884
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:34,380
- But if I stay with you,

885
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:35,917
he'll find me.

886
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:37,801
Where could we go?

887
01:00:38,085 --> 01:00:39,257
- I've thought of that.

888
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:41,843
We could take a room somewhere.

889
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,347
- Do you have any money?

890
01:00:43,632 --> 01:00:45,305
- No, but you do.

891
01:00:45,592 --> 01:00:46,809
A hundred pounds.

892
01:00:47,094 --> 01:00:49,813
You put away for a new dress.

893
01:00:50,097 --> 01:00:52,270
- How did you know that?

894
01:00:52,558 --> 01:00:53,855
- You told me.

895
01:00:54,142 --> 01:00:55,485
Don't you remember?

896
01:00:55,769 --> 01:00:57,817
(ominous music)

897
01:00:58,105 --> 01:00:58,651
- I'll get it.

898
01:00:58,939 --> 01:00:59,656
- No hurry.

899
01:01:00,816 --> 01:01:02,113
You can't go now.

900
01:01:02,401 --> 01:01:04,028
Not in broad daylight.

901
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:05,946
Somebody's bound to notice.

902
01:01:06,238 --> 01:01:08,411
Besides, we'll need a car.

903
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:09,450
Tonight,

904
01:01:09,741 --> 01:01:11,334
when George is asleep.

905
01:01:16,123 --> 01:01:18,717
(ominous music)

906
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:20,173
Don't you worry.

907
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,588
Just leave everything to me.

908
01:01:25,465 --> 01:01:27,968
(somber music)

909
01:01:36,768 --> 01:01:39,362
(ominous music)

910
01:02:39,081 --> 01:02:41,254
(knocking)

911
01:02:45,504 --> 01:02:46,255
- Barbara?

912
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:50,593
(somber music)

913
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:07,909
(phone ringing)

914
01:03:14,366 --> 01:03:15,117
Hello'?

915
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:18,078
Yes, Nurse Higgins.

916
01:03:19,913 --> 01:03:20,755
<i>She wasn't'?</i>

917
01:03:21,873 --> 01:03:23,466
That's very strange.

918
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:27,046
But you will be back tonight.

919
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:27,883
Good.

920
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:30,094
Now there's a late train
getting in at 10 o'clock.

921
01:03:30,382 --> 01:03:32,680
Take a taxi from the station.

922
01:03:32,968 --> 01:03:33,514
Splendid.

923
01:03:33,802 --> 01:03:35,770
I'll expect you then.

924
01:03:36,054 --> 01:03:37,306
Good bye.

925
01:03:37,597 --> 01:03:40,066
(ominous music)

926
01:04:09,755 --> 01:04:12,599
(foreboding music)

927
01:04:13,842 --> 01:04:14,718
- Come on, love.

928
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:16,307
Wake up.

929
01:04:16,595 --> 01:04:17,562
Hurry up. Get dressed.

930
01:04:17,846 --> 01:04:18,972
It's time to go.

931
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:21,562
- Quiet, not so loud.

932
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:22,646
He'll hear you.

933
01:04:22,934 --> 01:04:23,651
<i>- George?</i>

934
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:26,108
I got some of that
sedative they had for you.

935
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:28,194
Put it in his tea.

936
01:04:28,482 --> 01:04:29,574
- Will he sleep?

937
01:04:29,858 --> 01:04:33,829
- He didn't even feel it
when I took his car keys.

938
01:04:36,448 --> 01:04:37,449
- And Miss Higgins?

939
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:39,493
- By the time she gets here we'll be gone.

940
01:04:39,785 --> 01:04:41,128
Come on now.

941
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:42,583
There.

942
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:44,589
You go and get dressed.

943
01:04:44,873 --> 01:04:46,295
Are you okay, love?

944
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:47,550
- Yes.

945
01:04:47,834 --> 01:04:50,007
Yes, just a touch of nerves.

946
01:04:50,295 --> 01:04:51,922
I guess I'm not used
to so much excitement.

947
01:04:52,214 --> 01:04:54,012
- Oh, I love excitement.

948
01:04:59,387 --> 01:05:00,980
Here we are.

949
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,311
Just the thing.

950
01:05:03,892 --> 01:05:05,610
- What do you want with those?

951
01:05:05,894 --> 01:05:07,737
- To cut the phone cord, silly.

952
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:10,615
We don't want old Miss
Higgins giving alarm,

953
01:05:10,899 --> 01:05:11,525
now do we?

954
01:05:12,526 --> 01:05:13,823
- You do think of everything.

955
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:14,657
(Lucy giggling)

956
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:16,322
- I try to.

957
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:18,160
Now you hurry and get dressed

958
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:20,542
and I'll go down the hall and...

959
01:05:20,826 --> 01:05:22,669
(scissors snipping)

960
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:26,878
Remember, I expect to find
you dressed when I get back.

961
01:05:31,169 --> 01:05:31,920
<i>L</i> s8)

962
01:05:33,255 --> 01:05:34,006
- What?

963
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:37,968
- It is a laugh, isn't it'?

964
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,728
Just like old times.

965
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:44,065
(ominous music)

966
01:05:55,986 --> 01:05:58,660
(dramatic music)

967
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:28,985
(foreboding music)

968
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:49,627
What are you doing?

969
01:06:49,915 --> 01:06:51,258
Give them to me.

970
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:52,337
- I can't.

971
01:06:52,626 --> 01:06:53,923
I need them.

972
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:55,633
- Give them to me!

973
01:06:55,921 --> 01:06:57,594
- Please Lucy, one more.

974
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:00,634
- I am not going to
watch you ruin yourself.

975
01:07:00,926 --> 01:07:03,099
- Just one more, Lucy, then I promise.

976
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:05,639
- I thought you said
you weren't taking them.

977
01:07:05,931 --> 01:07:07,228
- I can't help it.

978
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:10,985
- You mean you don't want to help it.

979
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:12,521
You always had a choice.

980
01:07:12,812 --> 01:07:14,064
George or the pills.

981
01:07:14,356 --> 01:07:16,905
Me or the pills and the pills always win.

982
01:07:17,192 --> 01:07:19,695
Deep down inside you hate George.

983
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:22,326
You hate me.

984
01:07:22,614 --> 01:07:23,581
- No.

985
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:26,243
No Lucy, you're my best friend!

986
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:29,371
- These are your friends.

987
01:07:30,705 --> 01:07:32,707
Your only friends.

988
01:07:32,999 --> 01:07:35,593
Oh, I'm goo enough for you
when you're in trouble,

989
01:07:35,877 --> 01:07:37,550
but I've never been good enough for George

990
01:07:37,837 --> 01:07:40,135
or anyone else you know.

991
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,768
Now I can't even win over
a hand full of these.

992
01:07:44,052 --> 01:07:44,678
- No.

993
01:07:49,182 --> 01:07:51,401
- What I have done for you today

994
01:07:51,685 --> 01:07:53,437
you'll never know

995
01:07:53,728 --> 01:07:55,196
and it isn't enough.

996
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:57,616
I'm getting out.

997
01:07:57,899 --> 01:07:58,775
NOW!

998
01:07:59,067 --> 01:07:59,738
- No, Lucy!

999
01:08:04,906 --> 01:08:06,249
- You want these?

1000
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,497
Here.

1001
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:09,456
Take them!

1002
01:08:09,744 --> 01:08:12,293

1003
01:08:14,374 --> 01:08:15,125
<i>. Lucy-</i>

1004
01:08:20,213 --> 01:08:20,964
Lucy?

1005
01:08:23,258 --> 01:08:24,555
Lucy?

1007
01:08:30,181 --> 01:08:30,932
Lucy!

1008

(car engine starting)

1009
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:39,774
Lucy, come back!

1010
01:08:43,111 --> 01:08:44,112
- Barbara, what are you doing out of--

1011
01:08:44,404 --> 01:08:45,246
- I've got to go out.

1012
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:46,281
- At this time of night?

1013
01:08:46,573 --> 01:08:47,415
- Yes! You don't understand.

1014
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:48,245
It's Lucy.

1015
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:49,125
- Lucy?

1016
01:08:49,409 --> 01:08:50,126
- Yes, she just left.

1017
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,502
I heard the car pull away.

1018
01:08:51,786 --> 01:08:53,333
- That was the car I came in.

1019
01:08:53,621 --> 01:08:55,544
There's no one out here.

1020
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:56,458
No one.

1021
01:08:59,252 --> 01:09:01,175
- Then she's still here.

1022
01:09:06,593 --> 01:09:07,970
- Where's your brother?

1023
01:09:08,261 --> 01:09:10,138
- In the study I suppose.

1024
01:09:12,432 --> 01:09:13,183
George?

1025
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:15,102
George?

1026
01:09:16,936 --> 01:09:18,904
(ominous music)

1027
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:21,317
(screaming)

1028
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:25,283
(menacing music)

1029
01:09:50,345 --> 01:09:51,096
- Barbara?

1030
01:09:53,348 --> 01:09:54,099
Barbara?

1031
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:03,567
(intense music)

1032
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,828
(gasping)

1033
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:22,635
- There, Barbara.

1034
01:10:23,962 --> 01:10:25,214
Now you're free.

1035
01:10:26,131 --> 01:10:27,724
Free of all of them.

1036
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:41,480
- Now do you understand
why I must see a lawyer?

1037
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:44,194
They said I killed them.

1038
01:10:44,482 --> 01:10:47,736
They say my fingerprints
are on the shears.

1039
01:10:48,027 --> 01:10:49,244
But it was Lucy.

1040
01:10:49,529 --> 01:10:50,655
Lucy who did it.

1041
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:55,202
- What does Lucy have to say about that?

1042
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:58,793
- Why don't you ask her yourself?

1043
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:01,921
She's here with us now.

1044
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:03,710
- Where?

1045
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:09,762
- There she is.

1046
01:11:11,217 --> 01:11:12,639
Don't you see her?

1047
01:11:14,846 --> 01:11:16,268
Don't you see her?

1048
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:20,064
Don't you see her?

1049
01:11:20,351 --> 01:11:22,399
(laughing)

1050
01:11:30,862 --> 01:11:33,581
- Was there a George and
a Miss Higgins murdered?

1051
01:11:33,865 --> 01:11:36,118
- There may have been.

1052
01:11:36,409 --> 01:11:37,376
- But no Lucy?

1053
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:41,673
- There may not have even been a Barbara.

1054
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:46,011
- Meaning she might be Dr. Starr?

1055
01:11:46,294 --> 01:11:48,137
No, I don't think so.

1056
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:51,300
I don't think I've met Dr. Starr yet.

1057
01:11:52,217 --> 01:11:55,016
Maybe there is no such person.

1058
01:11:55,303 --> 01:11:57,681
Perhaps your Dr. Rutherford
is just playing a game.

1059
01:11:57,972 --> 01:12:01,351
- Dr. Rutherford never plays games.

1060
01:12:01,643 --> 01:12:03,441
- How many more are there for me to see?

1061
01:12:03,728 --> 01:12:04,695
- Just one.

1062
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:05,901
- And then my choice?

1063
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:07,862
- Then the choice.

1064
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:10,527
- Tell me about this one.

1065
01:12:10,818 --> 01:12:13,196
- He calls himself Byron.

1066
01:12:13,488 --> 01:12:14,114
Dr. Byron.

1067
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,121
BWOn?

1068
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,172
- Gentlemen.

1069
01:12:28,419 --> 01:12:31,218
- I brought Dr. Martin to see you.

1070
01:12:31,506 --> 01:12:34,555
- It's always a pleasure
to meet a colleague.

1071
01:12:34,842 --> 01:12:36,139
- You're a doctor?

1072
01:12:37,845 --> 01:12:39,643
- Indeed I am, sir.

1073
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:40,807
Physician,

1074
01:12:41,099 --> 01:12:44,399
neurosurgeon and orthopedic specialist.

1075
01:12:44,686 --> 01:12:48,065
And, lately I found
still another vocation.

1076
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:52,861
Even more fascinating.

1077
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,039
Do you care to see some of my recent work?

1078
01:12:56,322 --> 01:12:57,665
- Yes, I'd be happy to.

1079
01:12:57,949 --> 01:13:01,419
- If you'd be good
enough to step over here.

1080
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:07,675
- Hmm.

1081
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:10,257
Who are the subjects?

1082
01:13:10,545 --> 01:13:12,639
- Former colleagues of mine.

1083
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:15,846
Of course, I had to model
their faces from memory.

1084
01:13:16,134 --> 01:13:16,930
- Quite a hobby.

1085
01:13:17,218 --> 01:13:18,936
- Oh, it's more than a hobby.

1086
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,563
Much more.

1087
01:13:20,847 --> 01:13:23,350
These are not ordinary figures.

1088
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:25,609
The eyes were made to see.

1089
01:13:27,562 --> 01:13:30,281
Inside each skull is a
perfectly proportioned brain,

1090
01:13:30,565 --> 01:13:32,863
perfectly capable of functioning.

1091
01:13:33,151 --> 01:13:34,744
- You talk about them as
though they were alive.

1092
01:13:35,028 --> 01:13:35,654
- Hmm.

1093
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:37,572
That's the final step.

1094
01:13:39,532 --> 01:13:41,955
From play things to creations.

1095
01:13:43,244 --> 01:13:45,121
Living creations.

1096
01:13:45,413 --> 01:13:46,881
I know it sounds a bit...

1097
01:13:47,165 --> 01:13:48,291
(chuckling)

1098
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:51,427
But you see, the bible
tells us that the Lord God

1099
01:13:51,711 --> 01:13:54,260
formed the man from the dust of the ground

1100
01:13:54,547 --> 01:13:56,720
and he breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life.

1101
01:13:57,008 --> 01:13:59,010
Thus, the man became the living creature.

1102
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:01,145
Do you believe that, doctor?

1103
01:14:01,429 --> 01:14:02,931
- I'm afraid I put my belief in science.

1104
01:14:03,222 --> 01:14:03,848
- So do I.

1105
01:14:04,891 --> 01:14:07,189
If I could breathe my...

1106
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:10,276
consciousness into one of these figures,

1107
01:14:10,563 --> 01:14:12,657
that figure will come alive.

1108
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:17,283
Want to see what I'm working on now?

1109
01:14:21,949 --> 01:14:24,043
Call it my final creation.

1110
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,337
- [Martin] That's your face.

1111
01:14:27,622 --> 01:14:28,168
- Mhmm.

1112
01:14:28,456 --> 01:14:29,457
My face and inside, my body,

1113
01:14:29,749 --> 01:14:31,797
correct to the smallest detail.

1114
01:14:32,085 --> 01:14:34,133
I can turn it in and you can say,

1115
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,798
"Oh yes, it operates on batteries."

1116
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:40,060
But how do you know what it is inside?

1117
01:14:41,719 --> 01:14:43,062
- What is it?

1118
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:44,438
- It's me.

1119
01:14:44,722 --> 01:14:45,848
I mean, not yet.

1120
01:14:47,684 --> 01:14:48,856
But it will be.

1121
01:14:49,769 --> 01:14:51,316
Through the power of concentration

1122
01:14:51,604 --> 01:14:54,824
I'll shall will my mind to enter its body

1123
01:14:56,109 --> 01:14:58,237
and it will be me.

1124
01:14:58,528 --> 01:14:59,996
Rutherford wouldn't believe I could do it.

1125
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:01,075
He locked me up,

1126
01:15:01,364 --> 01:15:03,492
but he let me keep my dolls.

1127
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,328
Occupational therapy he called it.

1128
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:10,248
He'll soon find out what they are.

1129
01:15:13,459 --> 01:15:15,427
That's right, go.

1130
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:19,808
Run away and hide from the truth
like that idiot downstairs.

1131
01:15:20,091 --> 01:15:21,138
But it won't do any good you know.

1132
01:15:21,426 --> 01:15:22,678
You can tell Rutherford for me.

1133
01:15:22,969 --> 01:15:26,064
Tell him the truth will find him out!

1134
01:15:26,347 --> 01:15:26,973
Tell him!

1135
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:35,069
(lock clicking)

1136
01:15:35,356 --> 01:15:35,902
- Well?

1137
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:36,986
Which is it?

1138
01:15:38,609 --> 01:15:39,826
- Would you mind stepping into your office

1139
01:15:40,111 --> 01:15:42,739
and telling the doctor that
I'm ready to come down?

1140
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,122
- No need.

1141
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:46,034
I'll use the intercom.

1142
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:50,334
What do you want me to tell him?

1143
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:53,716
- Just tell him I'm coming to see him.

1144
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,595
- Dr. Martin is ready to come down, sir.

1145
01:15:57,879 --> 01:16:00,132
(door lock buzzing)

1146
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:01,265
- Thank you for your help.

1147
01:16:01,549 --> 01:16:02,391
- Don't mention it.

1148
01:16:02,675 --> 01:16:04,143
It was a pleasure.

1149
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:05,053
Doctor?

1150
01:16:07,221 --> 01:16:07,972
Good luck.

1151
01:16:18,065 --> 01:16:18,816
- So?

1152
01:16:20,485 --> 01:16:22,487
You've seen the patients.

1153
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,533
Well, what do you think?

1154
01:16:26,824 --> 01:16:28,792
- I think it's a disgrace.

1155
01:16:29,702 --> 01:16:32,546
This institution, the way it's run,

1156
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:34,878
everything about it.

1157
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:38,420
Those patients, locked away by themselves,

1158
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:39,837
lost in their own fantasies

1159
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:42,348
and no attempt made to
bring them back to reality.

1160
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:45,806
- You forget, they're incurable.

1161
01:16:46,093 --> 01:16:47,720
Take a man like Byron.

1162
01:16:49,263 --> 01:16:52,142
You think you could rid
him of his delusions?

1163
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:53,650
- I'd be willing to try!

1164
01:16:53,935 --> 01:16:55,687
- And you'd fail.

1165
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:58,527
Byron is hopelessly insane.

1166
01:16:58,815 --> 01:17:01,284
(ominous music)

1167
01:17:47,947 --> 01:17:52,043
There's only one way to
remove Byron's hallucinations.

1168
01:17:56,289 --> 01:17:57,131
With this.

1169
01:17:57,415 --> 01:17:58,667
- Prefrontal lobotomy?

1170
01:17:58,958 --> 01:17:59,959
- Exactly.

1171
01:18:00,251 --> 01:18:01,252
- Do you believe that surgery

1172
01:18:01,544 --> 01:18:04,172
is a substitute for psychiatry?

1173
01:18:04,463 --> 01:18:05,680
- It's affective.

1174
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:07,763
- Yes, it's affective,

1175
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:12,601
in turning intelligent human
beings into vegetables.

1176
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:15,438
(menacing music)

1177
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:25,132
(menacing music)

1178
01:20:37,408 --> 01:20:40,662
(elevator lift buzzing)

1179
01:20:54,508 --> 01:20:57,182
(menacing music)

1180
01:21:00,347 --> 01:21:01,098
And now,

1181
01:21:02,767 --> 01:21:04,394
your choice.

1182
01:21:04,685 --> 01:21:06,858
- You'd still give me the job
in spite of our differences?

1183
01:21:07,146 --> 01:21:09,114
- If you choose correctly.

1184
01:21:10,733 --> 01:21:12,656
Might do some good here.

1185
01:21:15,613 --> 01:21:16,535
Your choice?

1186
01:21:25,498 --> 01:21:26,215
- Your tea, doctor.

1187
01:21:26,499 --> 01:21:27,876
- Thank you, nurse.

1188
01:21:32,922 --> 01:21:33,673
Sugar?

1189
01:21:35,049 --> 01:21:35,800
- Nothing.

1190
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:39,019
I'm going back to London.

1191
01:21:40,971 --> 01:21:42,973
- You won't choose'?

1192
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:43,811
- No

1193
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,443
(ominous music)

1194
01:21:45,726 --> 01:21:48,696
- [Rutherford] I'm
disappointed in you, Martin.

1195
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:49,480
- [Martin] Why?

1196
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:51,240
Because I refuse to play games with you?

1197
01:21:51,524 --> 01:21:53,276
- Because you admit defeat.

1198
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:54,238
- Defeat?

1199
01:21:54,527 --> 01:21:56,404
- You can't identify Dr. Starr,

1200
01:21:56,695 --> 01:21:58,493
that's why you're leaving, isn't it?

1201
01:21:58,781 --> 01:22:00,249
Because you failed the test.

1202
01:22:00,533 --> 01:22:02,001
- [Martin] Test?

1203
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:03,001
I'm not a school boy.

1204
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:04,457
I'm a qualified doctor.

1205
01:22:04,745 --> 01:22:06,964
- Obviously you're not
qualified to practice here.

1206
01:22:07,248 --> 01:22:08,420
- [Martin] These patients
are badly in need

1207
01:22:08,707 --> 01:22:09,924
of proper therapy.

1208
01:22:10,209 --> 01:22:10,801
You won't help them.

1209
01:22:11,085 --> 01:22:12,632
You won't even let them help themselves.

1210
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,137
- On the contrary.

1211
01:22:14,421 --> 01:22:17,140
I give them every opportunity
to work out their fantasies.

1212
01:22:17,424 --> 01:22:18,346
That's wrongly.

1213
01:22:18,634 --> 01:22:19,977
Take Byron, for example.

1214
01:22:20,261 --> 01:22:21,808
- His work is remarkable.

1215
01:22:22,096 --> 01:22:23,313
- Also dangerous.

1216
01:22:24,348 --> 01:22:25,144
- Dangerous?

1217
01:22:25,432 --> 01:22:26,479
- [Rutherford] To himself.

1218
01:22:26,767 --> 01:22:29,190
Perhaps it's time I put an end to it

1219
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:30,570
and destroy his figures.

1220
01:22:30,855 --> 01:22:32,107
- That may make him even worse.

1221
01:22:32,398 --> 01:22:33,900
- Or cure him.

1222
01:22:34,191 --> 01:22:36,990
(ominous music)

1223
01:22:37,278 --> 01:22:38,746
Yes, I think the time has come

1224
01:22:39,029 --> 01:22:41,282
to take Byron's toys away from him.

1225
01:22:41,574 --> 01:22:42,621
(gasping)

1226
01:22:42,908 --> 01:22:44,535
(yelling)

1227
01:22:44,827 --> 01:22:47,080
(glass shattering)

1228
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:49,840
(ominous music)

1229
01:23:12,938 --> 01:23:15,487
(intense music)

1230
01:23:23,282 --> 01:23:24,454
(thudding)

1231
01:23:24,742 --> 01:23:26,289
(yelling)

1232
01:23:26,577 --> 01:23:29,296
(foreboding music)

1233
01:23:36,754 --> 01:23:39,348
(intense music)

1234
01:23:54,021 --> 01:23:54,772
<i>_</i> Byron!

1235
01:23:57,775 --> 01:24:00,119
- I was in my office

1236
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:01,904
when he cried out.

1237
01:24:02,196 --> 01:24:04,790
By the time I go to his room

1238
01:24:05,074 --> 01:24:05,996
it was too late.

1239
01:24:06,283 --> 01:24:07,034
- He's dead.

1240
01:24:07,326 --> 01:24:08,543
- His body was...

1241
01:24:09,703 --> 01:24:10,454
crushed.

1242
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:15,422
- So let's see our good Byron Starr.

1243
01:24:15,709 --> 01:24:18,588
- You recognized him then, sir?

1244
01:24:18,879 --> 01:24:20,005
- It was obvious.

1245
01:24:20,297 --> 01:24:21,139
- Where are you going?

1246
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:22,800
- To call the police.

1247
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:24,469
Is there a phone in your office?

1248
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,558
- Don't go in there sir!

1249
01:24:36,355 --> 01:24:37,106
No.

1250
01:24:38,649 --> 01:24:41,323
(menacing music)

1251
01:24:48,909 --> 01:24:50,661
- He's been strangled.

1252
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:53,251
- Two days ago.

1253
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:56,254
There was no opportunity to dispose of it.

1254
01:24:56,542 --> 01:24:57,088
- Dispose of it?

1255
01:24:57,376 --> 01:24:58,673
Who is he?

1256
01:24:58,961 --> 01:25:00,554
- His name was Max...

1257
01:25:00,838 --> 01:25:01,555
Reynolds.

1258
01:25:01,839 --> 01:25:03,512
- The orderly?

1259
01:25:03,799 --> 01:25:06,268
(ominous music)

1260
01:25:08,554 --> 01:25:10,022
- Yes.

1261
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:12,980
I'm afraid your guess was wrong.

1262
01:25:13,267 --> 01:25:14,314
I am Dr. Starr.

1263
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:19,941
(intense music)

1264
01:25:20,232 --> 01:25:22,200
(gagging)

1265
01:25:53,474 --> 01:25:55,647
(giggling)

1266
01:26:05,652 --> 01:26:08,576
(maniacal laughing)

1267
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:28,221
(dramatic music)

1268
01:26:57,204 --> 01:26:59,798
(ominous music)

1269
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,636
- Good afternoon.

1270
01:27:12,928 --> 01:27:13,724
- Good afternoon.

1271
01:27:14,012 --> 01:27:15,639
I've come about the appointment.

1272
01:27:15,931 --> 01:27:17,558
- Yes, I was expecting you.

1273
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:18,897
Do come in.

1274
01:27:19,184 --> 01:27:19,980
- Thank you.

1275
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:25,658
- Better keep the door closed
and keep out the drafts,

1276
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:27,818
<i>as</i> Dr. Starr used to say.
