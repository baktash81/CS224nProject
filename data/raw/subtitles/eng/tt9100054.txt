00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,041
- Ms. Caruso?
- Leda. Yes.

3
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,916
Hi. Welcome.

4
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,500
Thank you.

5
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,875
- Was the drive all right?
- Yeah.

6
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,333
Must've been backed up
on the National Road after Corinth.

7
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,041
Have you been waiting a long time?

8
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,458
- Uh…
- Oh!

9
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,000
It's all right.

10
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,166
- Sorry, I had a late start.
- No, let me. I got it.

11
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,041
- Sorry, they're half-filled with books.
- Yeah.

12
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,041
Is this your place?

13
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,458
No, I take care of it. For 30 years now.

14
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,666
Oh, wow.

15
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,541
And a few other places
on the island.

16
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,291
The real big ones.

17
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,916
- Here. Here's your key.
- Oh.

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,666
Uh, make yourself at home
and I'll be back with the other ones.

19
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,583
Thanks.

20
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,416
Here you go. That about does it.

21
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,791
I'll turn the air on in the…
in the bedroom.

22
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,375
Oh, no, I prefer the fresh air.

23
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,916
Well, you know, let me just
cool it down for you a little bit.

24
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,333
If you wanna…

25
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,083
…turn it off later, be my guest.

26
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,958
Your breakfast, uh, is covered
at the bar downstairs.

27
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,458
Oh, breakfast in a bar.

28
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,833
The lighthouse.

29
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,375
- It's not all the time.
- Okay.

30
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,000
Are you…

31
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,833
You write books?

32
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,416
Or, what are you, a teacher?

33
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,166
I'm a professor.

34
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,791
Okay. I see.

35
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,500
- Um, can I get you a tip?
- No, no. Please.

36
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,666
Well, welcome to Kyopeli.

37
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,333
Thank you.

38
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,250
Let me know
if I can do anything for you.

39
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,166
Thank you.

40
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,333
Excuse me, do you need some help?

41
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,541
It's just, you're in the sun.
I could move your chair if you'd like.

42
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,458
Oh, yeah, I am in the sun.

43
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,083
Can I move your chair
under the umbrella?

44
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

45
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,958
I work at the beach house, so…

46
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,791
No, please. Let me.

47
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,833
There we are.

48
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,750
- Thanks.
- Very welcome.

49
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,500
Uh, just let me know if you need anything.

50
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,083
I'm Will.

51
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,875
There's, uh, Nespresso
and ice pops and things.

52
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,416
- Great. Thanks, Will.
- All right.

53
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,958
- Will?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah?

54
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,208
What ice pops have you got?

55
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,416
Hey, hey, hey.

56
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,708
Watch out!

57
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,083
Can you take it easy? Hey!

58
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,291
Guys, there's a fucking person here.

59
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,541
- Sorry.
- Can you get me ice cream?

60
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,250
- It's way over there.
- Not my problem.

61
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,166
My God!

62
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,291
Yeah, it is
your fucking problem, man!

63
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,916
- Okay, so…
- Want some ice cream?

64
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,625
I told the kids today.
You didn't have them the other day.

65
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,916
- You see that ice cream? That ice cream.
- That ice cream. Okay. Great.

66
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,041
No, but also like the rainbow colored.
You have that?

67
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,583
- Yeah.
- I told you.

68
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,916
You need anything? Great.

69
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,291
You didn't even go.
He didn't even…

70
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,750
Why did dinosaurs die before us?

71
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,458
Do they go and dry up?

72
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,583
They do?

73
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,583
Nina.

74
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,625
Nina, you gotta put something on her
'cause it's cold now.

75
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,125
That robe.

76
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,125
You gotta put something on her.

77
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,000
See? That's all better.

78
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:46,916
Do you think
that I'm ever gonna get my doll?

79
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,458
Mmm.

80
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,541
Ugh.

81
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,083
Oh, my God.

82
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,000
Hey, motherfucker!

83
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,666
Fuck you! Motherfucker.

84
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,250
Mama, want more?

85
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,333
Yeah. I want more.

86
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,833
Neni, you want more?

87
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:46,375
- I think Neni wants more.
- Yes. Yes, please.

88
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,750
Will?

89
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,541
Yeah?

90
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,125
Yeah?

91
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,458
- Can I have a glass of water, please?
- Yes. One second.

92
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,708
Don't let it break.
Peel it like a snake.

93
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,416
This one is a round one.

94
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,833
I think it's raining…

95
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,541
- Should we keep it in a cage?
- Isn't that nice?

96
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,208
- That's really good.
- No?

97
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,791
- Know what we should do?
- What?

98
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,833
We should stick
googly eyes on his face,

99
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,041
and we should put him in a cage
and decorate the cage.

100
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,291
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

101
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,625
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

102
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,416
- You all right? Okay.
- Mmm. Yes.

103
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,583
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thank you.

104
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,250
Martha, baby.

105
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,416
I was just thinking of calling you.
Just got in from the beach.

106
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,041
What's ruined?

107
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,500
Why did you go to someone you don't know?

108
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,125
It's not ruined.

109
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,708
It just gets really dry
when you dye it so much.

110
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,833
I sometimes put a teaspoon of olive oil…

111
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,375
Oh.

112
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,791
Does your dad know someone?

113
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,958
I'm on holiday.
I'm looking out over the most--

114
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,416
Okay.

115
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,375
I love you too.

116
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:44,708
Bye.

117
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,458
Whoo!

118
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,583
You guys just move down
to the last umbrella, okay? Thank you.

119
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,166
And he'll get you a couple of sodas.
Thank you very much.

120
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,708
This should've been done before.
So this lady also has to move.

121
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,500
- You don't mind moving, right?
- No, I'm fine here.

122
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,458
It's just switching umbrellas
so my family can be together.

123
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,875
I understand that,
but I have no desire to move.

124
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,958
Hey, what's the big deal?

125
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,083
You do us this favor today,
we'll do a favor for you tomorrow.

126
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,500
No, thank you.

127
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,000
Cunt!

128
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,833
Honestly, I don't even know
what to say to you.

129
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,250
It's just moving
down the beach a few feet.

130
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,791
- This fucking…
- That's enough.

131
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,625
I'm sorry.

132
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,250
We put you on a diet
and you're eating all this cake.

133
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,625
- You want a piece of cake?
- Oh, thank you. No.

134
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,458
I'm sorry about earlier.
All right?

135
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,000
It's my birthday.

136
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,791
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

137
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,208
- How old are you?
- I'm 42.

138
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,458
You got a lovely big belly.

139
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,208
Well, it's a girl. So, you know.

140
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,291
- And how much longer have you got?
- Two months.

141
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,000
My sister-in-law had hers right away.

142
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,916
Took me eight years.

143
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,333
These things happen
when they're supposed to happen.

144
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,125
- Have a great birthday.
- Where you from?

145
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,166
I'm from Cambridge, near Boston.

146
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,375
No, I mean, where are your people from?

147
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,333
- My people?
- Yeah.

148
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,083
Are from Leeds. Well, Shipley, really.

149
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,625
- Fancy.
- No, it's not fancy.

150
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,875
I thought you were from Queens. I swear.

151
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,500
Not 'cause you talk like it,
but just, like… something.

152
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,041
That's where we're mostly from,

153
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,125
but we have family
in this town for, like, 300 years.

154
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,375
Oh.

155
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,375
Uh…

156
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,166
You don't have kids?

157
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,458
Yes, I have two daughters.

158
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,625
Where are they?

159
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,541
How old are they?

160
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,791
Uh, Bianca is 25 and Martha is 23.

161
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:40,875
No!

162
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,500
I mean, you're too young.
You must've started really early.

163
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,208
I'm 48.

164
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,625
Shit. No.

165
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,500
You look amazing.

166
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,916
We were saying before,
you couldn't be more than 40.

167
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,208
Damn, you're lucky.

168
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,250
- What's your name?
- Leda.

169
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,666
- Neda?
- Leda.

170
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,083
Leda. Leda what?

171
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,625
Caruso.

172
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,375
Oh! Caruso from Queens.

173
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,416
I'm Callie.

174
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,875
Callisto.

175
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,666
It means the most beautiful.

176
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,750
You're not gonna have a bite?
Not even one bite?

177
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,916
- Oh.
- How can you hold cake and not eat it?

178
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,125
Mmm.

179
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,708
- It's good, right?
- It's really good.

180
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,666
Yeah.

181
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,083
Um…

182
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,750
Look, I'm sorry about earlier as well.
I was feeling a bit anxious.

183
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,375
Yeah, well, you know, the sun can do that.

184
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:40,208
And, well, maybe your girls.
Being away from your girls, you know?

185
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,208
Yeah, well, you'll see.

186
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:49,416
Children are a crushing responsibility.

187
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,416
Happy birthday.

188
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,500
Oh.

189
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,875
- Hi. Hello.
- Lyle. From upstairs.

190
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,416
- Yeah, of course.
- I'm glad you made it down here.

191
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,708
- It's not so bad, right?
- No.

192
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,791
- I hope we didn't disturb you.
- Oh, no, no.

193
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,916
What are you drinking?

194
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,833
Oh, I'm fine. I'm still half full.

195
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,750
Nice to have a place like this,
just down the stairs.

196
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,208
You know, especially when you're alone.

197
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:59,416
- Keeps you from eating canned beans.
- Or rotten fruit.

198
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,375
- Uh, I forget to eat entirely sometimes.
- Oh, that's not good.

199
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,625
I saw you at the beach today.
Callie's birthday party.

200
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,750
Oh, well, I wasn't exactly at the party.
I didn't see you.

201
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:17,875
I saw you.

202
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,416
- You know, you're settling in upstairs?
- Yeah. It's great. Thanks.

203
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,333
- Yeah? Everything's okay in the apartment?
- Yeah, it's great. Thank you.

204
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,416
Did you find that remote?
You know, for the fan?

205
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,166
No, I prefer
to pull the string to turn it on.

206
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,166
- The fan.
- Pull.

207
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,666
Pulling the ol' string, eh?

208
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,708
- The apartment's great.
- It's a good one.

209
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,000
Bright and white.

210
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,416
- Feels like you're on a boat almost.
- Yes.

211
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,625
- No, no, I got it.
- Oh, no, really.

212
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,375
- I insist.
- Oh, thank you.

213
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,666
Just let me know
if I can do anything for you.

214
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,750
I will. Thank you.

215
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,958
Do you mind
if I finish my dinner now, Lyle?

216
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:12,958
Oh, sure.

217
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,208
- Yeah.
- Okay.

218
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,041
A beautiful game.

219
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:06,833
Sorry.

220
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,583
Damn it!

221
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
You do whatever the fuck you want.
You wanna take care of your baby girl?

222
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,458
You say you miss us.

223
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,958
You wanna come back and you want me.
You want this ass?

224
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,541
What? You're such a piece of shit.

225
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,125
I'm a piece of shit?

226
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,041
Fuck you! Hey!

227
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,083
Elena?

228
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,416
Elena!

229
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:37,875
Elena?

230
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,250
Lena.

231
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:03,583
Elena!

232
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,000
Elena!

233
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,750
<i>Bianca?</i>

234
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,541
Bianca!

235
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,458
Bianca!

236
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,208
Bianca!

237
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:19,208
Bianca!

238
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,000
Bianca!

239
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,458
Bianca!

240
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,625
<i>Bianca!</i>

241
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,416
Elena!

242
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,083
Further that way, okay?

243
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,000
Elena!

244
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:36,416
Elena!

245
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:41,375
Lena!

246
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,333
That's our… That's… That's our water gun.

247
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,500
It's okay, she's wearing your big hat.
We'll find her, okay?

248
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:58,750
Lena!

249
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,458
<i>Bianca!</i>

250
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,208
- Bianca!
- Bianca, come here!

251
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,291
Bianca!

252
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,291
Bia…

253
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:15,541
Bianca!

254
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,208
Bianca!

255
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:21,875
<i>Bianca!</i>

256
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:34,458
Hey.

257
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,833
I lost my mama.

258
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:42,416
Oh. I'll help you find her.
Come on.

259
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,250
Elena!

260
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,375
Oh, my God!

261
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,041
God!

262
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:51,750
Give her to me.

263
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:57,083
Mama!

264
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,500
Mama!

265
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,083
I just wanted to come say thank you.

266
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,083
Yeah, it was scary.

267
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:21,166
I thought I was gonna die.

268
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:22,791
Yeah.

269
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:26,041
Thank God you were here. Thank God.

270
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,625
Sometimes it's easier for strangers
in these situations.

271
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:32,333
Yeah, I was so crazy,
I couldn't see right.

272
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,083
You know, so many awful things can happen.

273
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,250
People are so fucked up.

274
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,875
Oh, my God.

275
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,250
What happened to your back?

276
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:44,958
- It was a pine cone from the beach path.
- A pine cone?

277
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,083
That looks so awful.
Did you put something on it?

278
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:49,291
No, I haven't.

279
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,625
Oh, no. No. Oh, I have something for you.

280
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,125
It's so good. Hold on.

281
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,125
- I like your bathing suit.
- Oh, thank you.

282
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,333
Mm-hmm.

283
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:02,750
So she's not calming down?

284
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,500
Yeah.

285
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,250
Mommy!

286
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,916
- Stop.
- Weird day.

287
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,166
Hmm.

288
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,208
We found her and then she lost

289
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,250
<i>her</i> doll.

290
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:20,625
I used to have a doll like that.
Called Mina.

291
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,625
- Nina?
- Mina.

292
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,416
Or Mini-Mama, as my mother called her.

293
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:27,750
You'll find it.

294
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,625
- Yeah.
- Do you want a toy?

295
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,375
- How's that?
- Good, thank you. It's cold.

296
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:50,083
Yes. It's really amazing.
It's gonna make you feel so much better.

297
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,666
Okay, by tonight,
you're gonna feel amazing.

298
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,750
- All right? All right.
- Thank you. Yeah.

299
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,291
And let's go.
Let's find the doll.

300
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,500
I… I can't hear her scream anymore.

301
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:04,583
See you tomorrow.

302
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,666
Mama!

303
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,083
- Bye.
- Bye.

304
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,333
<i>I've got a special gift for you.</i>

305
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,125
Open your eyes.

306
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,041
Hmm?

307
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,583
This was Mama's doll
when she was a little girl.

308
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:03,541
- What's her name?
- Her name's Mina.

309
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,166
- Mummy?
- Mm-hmm.

310
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,708
- Can I have a cuddle?
- You can have a cuddle.

311
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,375
Aw.

312
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,666
Give you some medicine

313
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:31,250
because then you'll have nice nails.

314
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,458
Yeah.

315
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,125
Very messy.
And you won't get better.

316
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,291
Mm-hmm.

317
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:41,666
I'm just gonna close my eyes
for a few seconds, baby. Okay?

318
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,625
Okay.

319
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,583
Can you see what my eye color is?

320
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:48,208
- Hmm. Brown?
- No.

321
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:49,916
They're red.

322
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,166
- Do you see?
- Yeah.

323
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:59,750
Uh, I'll just
have to brush your hair.

324
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,416
Ow! Fuck! Ouch!

325
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,291
Bianca, no!

326
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:14,541
Ouch.

327
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:22,208
- You said we would have a date.
- I can't just let her cry.

328
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:26,666
You've got to… I'll give you
a few more seconds to come back.

329
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,375
Three, two, one.

330
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:51,166
Here. Why don't you play with Mini-Mama?

331
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,958
You can brush her hair, yeah?

332
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,041
- Oh, Mama, come!
- I'll be back in two seconds.

333
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,500
<i>Bianca?</i>

334
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,375
<i>Bianca!</i>

335
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,791
Bianca! Come on! Dinner.

336
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,625
That seems fine.

337
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,375
Are you ignoring me?

338
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,416
I've called you so many times for dinner.

339
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,833
Bianca?

340
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,583
What are you sitting on? Bianca!

341
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,083
Get up.

342
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,708
Get up. Get up.

343
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:39,916
You don't like her?

344
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,000
I gave Mina to you
because I trusted you to take care of her.

345
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,166
You know, you can be very thoughtless.

346
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,458
This is <i>my</i> doll.
You can't treat her like shit.

347
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:50,375
No. She's mine.

348
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,750
Yeah, well, she's ruined.

349
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,875
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

350
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,083
- You look like you stayed dry.
- Yeah, was it really bad?

351
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,458
Yeah. No, it was crazy.

352
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,791
Everybody ran into the cafe,
and then it got too crowded.

353
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,916
Umbrellas started blowing away,
people's books, towels, yeah.

354
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,083
- Everyone was freaking out.
- Oh, dear.

355
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:02,083
Yeah, and the little girl, Elena,
she just… she wouldn't stop crying.

356
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:04,458
Yeah, she lost her doll or something.

357
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,583
- I like storms.
- Mmm.

358
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah, well, your books
woulda gotten ruined.

359
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,916
- Oh, did yours get wet?
- Yeah.

360
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,791
What are you studying?

361
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,625
- Business.
- In Greek?

362
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,541
No, no, I'm studying in Dublin,

363
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:19,041
and I just work here
for the summers, but, uh…

364
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:22,833
Yeah, I'm a bit behind at college.

365
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,833
You know, I wasted a lot of time.

366
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,125
- Yeah.
- How old are you?

367
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,916
- Twenty-four.
- Oh, right between my daughters.

368
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,041
I heard you're a professor.

369
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,541
I think the correct response
is, "Sounds like fun."

370
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:38,125
- What?
- It's a rude joke.

371
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:41,166
Will sandwich. Yeah.

372
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,166
Uh, I teach, yeah.

373
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,125
Yeah. Comp lit.
Italian literature, really.

374
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,666
- All right.
- But I'm skiving off.

375
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,250
Right, right, ahem, yeah,
comparative literature.

376
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,833
Mmm. Yeah.

377
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:55,916
- I saw you know a lot of languages?
- I don't know anything very well.

378
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,125
I also wasted a lot of time.

379
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,833
Do you wanna have dinner with me?

380
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,458
Yeah, I should go shower and change and--

381
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,583
No, you're fine as you are.

382
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:09,333
- I don't have my wallet.
- Uh, I'm inviting you. Come on.

383
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:10,583
Okay.

384
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,500
That was so funny.

385
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,583
Vassili is Callie's husband.

386
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:23,500
Oh, I thought he was married
to the older, heavyset woman.

387
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,541
- Oh, come on.
- What?

388
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,666
She's fat.

389
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,875
No, but that's Callie's aunt, I think.

390
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:33,250
- And Lyle, who looks after my place.
- He works for them.

391
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,041
- Oh…
- Mmm.

392
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,291
- And Nina's husband is…
- Toni.

393
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,458
- Toni?
- Yeah.

394
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,666
Yeah, he, um, comes up the weekends.

395
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:46,916
He has investments in Kalamata.

396
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,208
- Sounds dodgy.
- Yeah. Mmm.

397
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:52,541
And then they all rent
one of these huge villas by the cliffs.

398
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:54,916
It's pink.

399
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,458
- It's pink?
- Yeah.

400
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:58,958
They rent the same one every year.

401
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:03,583
Wow, it's like talking about a film I saw
in a language I didn't quite understand.

402
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,541
You watch movies
in languages you don't know?

403
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,458
- Yeah.
- Without subtitles?

404
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,416
Yeah.

405
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,125
And you were saying that,
um, your kids are my age?

406
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,708
Yeah, 25 and 23. Bianca and Martha.

407
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:20,958
Hmm. And do they look like you?

408
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:23,833
I don't know. It's hard to say,
if I'm honest. They probably do.

409
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:24,916
Oh.

410
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,250
Because you're beautiful.

411
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,958
You're a very smart boy.

412
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,791
My mother was very beautiful.

413
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:38,625
And, um, when I was about Martha's age,
I felt like she hadn't shared it.

414
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:41,083
Like, in creating me
she'd separated herself,

415
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:44,291
like pushing a plate away
if the food's repulsive.

416
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,500
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

417
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,291
But Bianca and Martha, it's funny.

418
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:52,625
What I find most interesting
are the secret resemblances.

419
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:53,791
- Hmm.
- You know?

420
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,500
So what makes Bianca seductive
and Martha not, and vice versa.

421
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:58,708
Well, they blame me.

422
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,208
Like, when I was younger,
I had small breasts.

423
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,583
And then as soon as I gave birth,
big breasts.

424
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:11,541
And Bianca has big breasts,
and Martha has almost none, like a boy.

425
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,375
And she doesn't realize
how beautiful she is.

426
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:18,500
And she wears a padded bra
and it sort of humiliates her.

427
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,208
And she thinks
I've given the best of myself to Bianca.

428
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:23,541
She feels deprived.

429
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:27,833
And, um, I do understand. And, like…

430
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,791
Long time ago,
at some point, I considered,

431
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,625
only half seriously,
considered having implants.

432
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:39,125
But, um, they come from nowhere,
so what are they worth?

433
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:40,916
You know?

434
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:44,041
But Bianca is completely different,

435
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,500
and she would never
let herself feel deprived.

436
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:50,333
She sucks everything out of me.
All my secret skills.

437
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:54,083
She pointed out
I'm finicky about peeling fruit.

438
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,000
Hmm.

439
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,583
I don't like it when the peel breaks.

440
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:59,833
I like when it comes off
in one long whatsit?

441
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,166
- String…
- String.

442
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,250
- Yeah, very, very uptight.
- Yeah.

443
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,208
Didn't even know that about myself.

444
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,041
Yeah, of course I understand.

445
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:15,708
The problem for me is why did they
schedule them so close together?

446
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,041
Baby… Babe…

447
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,166
Huh?

448
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,750
It's Sunday. You're on.

449
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,750
It's Columbia.

450
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,041
I'm working.

451
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,625
I'm suffocating.

452
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:49,541
- Please, can you kiss it?
- Yeah, sit down.

453
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:54,041
- Mama, please, can you kiss it?
- Sit down.

454
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:56,708
What did you do that for?

455
00:41:56,791 --> 00:42:02,083
I wanted to peel it
like a snake like you do.

456
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:06,458
Please. Please, can you kiss it?

457
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,416
It really hurts.

458
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:13,791
Mama!

459
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,833
Kiss it.

460
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:22,791
Please.

461
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,958
Please.

462
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,583
I can't leave you alone
for one minute.

463
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:47,583
There's this great poem by María Guerra.

464
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,625
<i>"Haciendo serpentinas"?</i>

465
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,333
No.

466
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:54,375
Have you ever read "Leda and the Swan"?

467
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:55,750
No.

468
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,541
Okay. That's in English.

469
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:00,041
- Okay.
- Plus, it's my namesake.

470
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,166
"The center cannot hold…"

471
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,958
Oh, that's a different…
that's a different Yeats.

472
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:07,583
Um…

473
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,041
My mum used to get quite dizzy.

474
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:19,000
She, um… Every time she stood up,
happened all the time.

475
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,125
She said it's 'cause
she stood up too fast.

476
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:27,291
Oh, poor creatures
that came out of my belly.

477
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:31,125
The bits I find most beautiful about them
are the bits that are alien to me.

478
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:34,083
So I don't have
to take responsibility for that.

479
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:39,583
- Have I bored you?
- No.

480
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:41,333
Nina's very beautiful.

481
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:44,958
Yes.

482
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,416
I hope they find the doll.

483
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,250
They're all freaking out and…

484
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,583
I had to rake
the entire beach looking for it.

485
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:57,916
- They will.
- Hmm.

486
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,708
What you did yesterday was amazing.

487
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:04,750
When you wouldn't move from the umbrella.

488
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:09,750
- But don't do things like that anymore.
- Why?

489
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:13,166
Because they're bad people.

490
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:51,750
Ugh!

491
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,708
<i>Sometimes I get scared
I can't take care of them.</i>

492
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:55,000
What if I passed out,
alone with them when you're in Arizona?

493
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,458
Baby, you're okay.

494
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:00,333
I promise.

495
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,625
Of course you can take care of them.

496
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:25,625
I'm just gonna take the dress
and the shoes and the socks.

497
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:27,666
And leave the… Oh, no.

498
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,083
Actually, I'm gonna
take the jacket too. Thank you.

499
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,666
Leda.

500
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:39,541
- Hi.
- Hi.

501
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:43,083
- How are you?
- Good.

502
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:46,083
Do you have grandkids already?

503
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:47,916
No.

504
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,541
Did you use the ointment I gave you?

505
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,666
Oh, for my back.
Yeah, it feels much better.

506
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,875
- Thank you.
- Oh, good.

507
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,375
Hey. Hey, sweetie,
did you ever find your doll?

508
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,041
- Oh, my God.
- Elena, do not do that.

509
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,291
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

510
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,500
She's super tired.

511
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:10,000
Why don't you tell the lady
how we're gonna go

512
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:13,708
and find Neni tomorrow
when it's not raining, right, honey?

513
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:16,791
And then today
we're gonna get a doll for a big girl.

514
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:20,041
'Cause you're Mommy's big girl.
You're my big girl.

515
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,000
Whoever took her should get brain cancer.

516
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,583
Oh, come on.
It's kids' stuff, you understand?

517
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,375
They like a toy, they take it. That's it.

518
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,291
No, Arruno's children
aren't like kids.

519
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:30,416
Yeah, it's their mom. She's a cunt.

520
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,458
I spoke to Toni
and the kids didn't take anything.

521
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,541
- He's lying.
- Don't say that.

522
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:38,000
- Well, it's true.
- Don't say it.

523
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,333
She's been through
a lot, you know?

524
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:43,541
She's, like, had a fever,
she can't breathe at night.

525
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:46,166
She needs a Kleenex. We're furious.

526
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,875
- Do you have a Kleenex, actually?
- No, I don't. Sorry.

527
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,083
How high was the temperature?

528
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:57,916
Barely 100. She's… She's okay.

529
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,833
She's okay.

530
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,916
Okay, you wanna let Mama
put you down for a second?

531
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,000
Come on.
Elena, let Mama put you down. Come on.

532
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:15,958
Stop. Stop it.

533
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:19,833
Enough. Stop. Enough!
Stop acting like this. Let me…

534
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:21,750
Fuck!

535
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:31,750
She's driving me crazy.

536
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,333
'Cause Daddy's away, right?

537
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:37,541
Daddy's away,
and you're taking it out on me.

538
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,458
All right. Come to Auntie, baby.
Come on. Come to Auntie.

539
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:45,708
There we go, my big girl. Oh!

540
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:48,583
- My big girl!
- Go. So I can have a minute.

541
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,250
Sometimes I just can't handle it.

542
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:55,666
- I know.
- Okay?

543
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,833
Yes, anything you want. Show Mama.

544
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:03,291
Show Mama and the lady
what a good girl you are, okay?

545
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:04,250
Here you go.

546
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,625
You're okay. You're okay.

547
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:14,125
They really put us through it, huh?

548
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:18,083
I thought you said
you're pregnant with your first.

549
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,291
I am.

550
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:22,166
What were your daughters like
when they were little?

551
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:24,958
Were they like
this willful little creature?

552
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,750
I honestly can't remember much, actually.

553
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,083
Oh, no, you can't forget
anything about your own children.

554
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,083
Is that your experience?

555
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,333
I just mean, did your daughters give you
a hard time when they were little?

556
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,333
I just don't remember.

557
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:48,333
- You okay?
- She doesn't remember.

558
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:50,375
I was very tired.

559
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,000
Sorry, excuse me.

560
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:58,541
Sorry.

561
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:01,625
Don't bother buying her another doll.
It won't make any difference.

562
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,083
You'll find it.

563
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,333
<i>Stiamo disturbando…</i>

564
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,791

565
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,541

567
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:38,000
Mama, how do you write "volcano"?

568
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:45,416
Mama. Is this how you write "volcano"?
Is this how you write "volcano"?

569
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:48,750
<i>Su te…</i>

570
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,583
- How do you--
- Don't do that!

571
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:55,666
Don't you dare, ever again, Bianca.

572
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,833
Listen to me. Don't you dare, ever again.

573
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,208
You don't hit Mama.

574
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,291
You can never, ever do that.
Do you understand?

575
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:08,833
- Can--
- Out!

576
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,750
- No! No!
- Out!

577
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:16,208
<i>- Get off me!
- Give me 15 more minutes.</i>

578
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:18,916
Down.

579
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:21,541
I don't…

580
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:28,500
I don't want to see you right now.
I don't want to see you right now!

581
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:31,541
Oh!

582
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,166
Mama! Mama! Mama!

583
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,625
Oh, my God. Oh, my…

584
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:30,083
- I love fucking your wet pussy.
- Oh, yeah.

585
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:34,500
- Fuck, you're good.
- Your cock is pushing me open.

586
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,375
Fuck.

587
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:53,833
Are you not hard?

588
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:57,791
No, I… I am. I sort of am.

589
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:01,416
Oh, baby.

590
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:03,666
It's okay.

591
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:08,500
I'm sorry.
I'm just going to go to the bathroom.

592
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:11,583
Yeah.

593
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,666
When you get back,
I'm gonna make you come.

594
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,000
Mm-hmm.

595
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:27,791
Nina!

596
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,208
Nina!

597
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,416
Judy Garland was a fucking genius.

598
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,916
Where the fuck
does Dr. Williams keep her coffee?

599
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:53,041
Or does she just drink green tea?

600
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:55,083
Didn't you just have one
in Great Barrington?

601
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:57,625
- Fuck you.
- Baby, have one of these.

602
00:53:57,708 --> 00:54:00,208
- Have one of these. Baby.
- I don't want one.

603
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:02,708
- Have one of these. Have one.
- I don't want one of them.

604
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:03,833
Oh!

605
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,666
Mummy! Finally I found you!

606
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,875
Oh, my God, you're soaking wet!

607
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,625
We saw sparrows and robins!

608
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,750
Martha, this is Daddy's teacher's house.
Take your shoes off, now.

609
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:16,333
Your shoes off. You've got to be
very, very careful in this house.

610
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:18,833
- I'm hungry.
- Daddy's eaten your snack.

611
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:21,833
Daddy, you said we'd
make Blitzes so the sun would come out.

612
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:22,833
Why did you eat them?

613
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,583
Baby, we will. I promise you.

614
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:26,791
What are you watching? Snoggies?

615
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:28,125
Oh, my God.

616
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,041
Hikers.

617
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:38,000
- Hikers!
- Hikers. Stay there.

618
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:39,833
They must be doing the Catamount Trail.

619
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,375
Hey, what are hikers?

620
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:42,833
Are you kidding me?

621
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:45,833
- To Quebec. They don't have food.
- Joe, it's not 1985.

622
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:49,541
- What's wrong with you? They're wet.
- Joe, don't bring them in here!

623
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,875
You guys, uh, look like
you've been going a while.

624
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:54,250
Yes. Since April.

625
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,416
- Amazing.
<i>- Grazie.</i>

626
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:59,208
- Can I ask how old you are?
- Forty-two.

627
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:02,000
Oh, my God.

628
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:04,208
Life is so different without kids.

629
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:06,625
I have kids.

630
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:08,166
I have three kids.

631
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,583
Twelve, nine and seven.

632
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:13,250
They are in London, with their mother.

633
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,500
So you ran away together?

634
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:20,791
- I guess we did.
- Yes, we did.

635
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:22,875
Hmm.

636
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:25,791
We are obliged
to do so many stupid things.

637
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:27,333
From childhood, even.

638
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,708
- Obliged?
- Yes.

639
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,625
What happened to us
is the only thing that's happened to me

640
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:35,250

00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:23,583
And comparative literature.

- No.
- In Italian? That's…

657
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:37,541

- I didn't mean to disturb you.
- It's okay.

690

Yeah.

694
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:44,916

01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:14,458
I think I would find that disgusting.
Or was that a dirty joke?

702
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:17,333
Sorry.

703
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:21,166
- How about fried?
- Uh, I don't know how to clean it.

704
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,833
I've cleaned it.
It'll just take two minutes.

705
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,416
Oh. Okay.

706
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,333
I remember when I first got here,

707
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:30,750
you could pick octopus
off the rocks with your hands.

708
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:35,416
We used to hang them on the clotheslines,
like the old ladies do.

709
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:37,375
Cheers.

710
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:42,500
My father-in-law used to say there was
a time when you could have walked

711
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:46,708
from Martha's Vineyard to Nantucket
on the backs of whales.

712
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:47,625
Are you married?

713
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:50,458
Mmm. Not since the '80s.

714
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:53,458
Uh, do you have a lemon?

715
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:56,666
<i>Your kids must have loved it
with the octopus.</i>

716
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,208
Sounds like a nice way to grow up.

717
01:00:58,291 --> 01:01:00,750
They grew up with their mom, in Philly.

718
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:05,083
<i>My oldest son is older than you.</i>

719
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:07,333
<i>I don't think so. I'm old.</i>

720
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:12,541
What do you mean, old?
At the most you're, what, forty?

721
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:14,875
Forty-two?

722
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:16,916
Forty-three?

723
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:19,583
Forty-four?

724
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:21,125
Forty-five?

725
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,250
<i>Forty-six?</i>

726
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:25,750
<i>Forty-seven?</i>

727
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:27,458
<i>Forty-eight, Lyle.</i>

728
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,083
Two grown-up children.

729
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,541
Daughters. 25 and 23.

730
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,625
Martha grew up worrying about me.

731
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:37,041
Poor little thing. Checking that I ate,
didn't die at night, like a little mama.

732
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:38,500
Bianca's like her father.

733
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,833
She made me feel
like she wanted to remake me.

734
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:43,750
Like her viciousness was for my own good.

735
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,500
Well, my oldest is 50.

736
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,291
Actually 51.

737
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,375
So, I win.

738
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,333
- Three times a grandfather.
- Oh.

739
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:56,333
They're so soft when they're young.
Their little bodies.

740
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,833
- Are your kids on the island?
- No.

741
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:09,416
You know, Leonard Cohen
used to come over here from Hydra.

742
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:13,375
We'd write songs together.
They liked that, when I told them.

743
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:18,000
Not real songs.
Just messing around. They liked that.

744
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,250
And you know those uni shells?

745
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:24,916
No? Sea urchins, you know…

746
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,208
- Oh, yeah.
- Purple, beautiful shells.

747
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,666
I used to fill them with cotton balls

748
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,875
and send 'em out to Philly
for their birthdays.

749
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,625
I'll look out for some for your girls.

750
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,875
You sound like a real family man.

751
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,500
Yeah.

752
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:48,541
Yeah, I taught…

753
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:50,833
I taught them all how to swim.

754
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,250
Except the littlest.

755
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:05,458
I'm so sorry. That was… I'm so mean.

756
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:09,083
No. Fuck that, lady.

757
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,375
I'm mean too.

758
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:18,791
Well, you're in good company.

759
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:26,000
Sounds like the loveliest thing.
What am I toasting?

760
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:27,291
It means "mean."

761
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:28,833
"Cruel."

762
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,166
Must've been lonely here.

763
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,416
Phew.

764
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,916
It was a real party.

765
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:06,458
- Do you feel sick?
- No, I'm fine.

766
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,916
Why don't you lay down for a minute?

767
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,250
Now, now, it'll pass.

768
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:28,458
Nothing needs to pass, Lyle. I feel fine.

769
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:31,750
- Do you want some coffee?
- No, thank you. Stay there. Don't move.

770
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:54,416
There you go. You got your color back.

771
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:57,125
You went totally pale.

772
01:04:57,666 --> 01:04:58,541
Yeah.

773
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:03,125
Would you mind if I had a smoke?

774
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:53,791
There's water in there.

Pink villa.

783
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:24,875
I have to take a call.

784
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:30,166
Let me answer, Will.

785
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:32,541
Hello.

786
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:40,875
Hello?

787
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:29,708
Mama!

788
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:32,500
- Mama, Professor Cole is on the phone.
- What?

789
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:34,916
Professor Cole is on the phone.

790
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:38,500
- Is on the phone.
- Professor Cole…

791
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:43,166
Um, I'm just not really sure I'll be able
to afford a ticket on such short notice.

792
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:50,250
Oh, my goodness. Um, that's… Uh…

793
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:53,125
Um, should I prepare
a paper to present, or…

794
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:56,083
No, no, no, that's fine. That's fine.

795
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:58,375
Um…

796
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:02,291
Well, thank you
for the opportunity.

797
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:03,541
That's okay.

798
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:05,000
Okay.

799
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:07,208
Okay, thank you.

800
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:10,458
Will we be seeing Daddy?

801
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:19,041
<i>I have left
my number and Joe's number,</i>

802
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:21,083
and Bianca's school and Martha's daycare.

803
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:25,583
And, oh, also the pediatrician's…

804
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,708
Ah!

805
01:09:27,791 --> 01:09:29,250
Martha's got a little cold.

806
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:33,333
It's nothing really, but she should have
a teaspoon of elderberry in the morning.

807
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:35,208
- She can have one of these afterwards.
- Mm-hmm.

808
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:38,041
'Cause, you know,
just for being good.

809
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,375
Um, I also left
a humidifier beside her bed,

810
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:43,666
so you can just plug that in at night.
And she loves Cheetah.

811
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,916
Um, so if she's a bit upset at nighttime,
you can give her Cheetah.

812
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,458
Oh! Yeah,
I left Joe's mum's number,

813
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:56,583
and, um-- I mean, I'll call every night
at dinner, so… Thank you, thank you! Ah!

814
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:58,708
I'll call every-- I left my mum's number.

815
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:00,875
Only call her
if you can't get through to anyone else.

816
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,833
I made dinner
for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

817
01:10:02,916 --> 01:10:05,125
and I labeled which is for which days…

818
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:08,791
I did soak some black beans,
but didn't get a chance to… Do you cook?

819
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:11,125
- Mm-hmm.
- I've left the recipe on the fridge. Easy.

820
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,208
Just don't want them to go bad.

821
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,333
<i>Hi, um…</i>

822
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:28,166
Could I order up some wine, please?

823
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:30,833
Oh, no, just a-- just a glass.

824
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:34,000
Thank you.
Actually, have you got any Champagne?

825
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:38,791
Oh, right. No, that's fine, uh…

826
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:42,291
How much is a bottle, actually?
I'm celebrating.

827
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,625
- Hi.
- Hi, Leda.

828
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:56,875
This is the paper I'm giving.

829
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,750
I'm not sure it's persuasive.

830
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:04,875
<i>Camus posits
that the ontological emptiness</i>

831
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:06,833
of the universe

832
01:11:06,916 --> 01:11:11,125
chafes against
the intrinsically human desire

833
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:13,041
for metaphysical meaning.

834
01:11:13,666 --> 01:11:17,458
Consequently, it is jarring

835
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:20,041
that Esslin's <i>Theatre of the Absurd…</i>

836
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,333
Bourdieu…

837
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:05,666
Bourdieu's mistake is that he often forgot
the first part of his own name.

838
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:11,125
I'm sorry, Walter.
Walter is sensitive. Where is he?

839
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:13,416
That's terrible.

840
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,541
But what I really want to consider,

841
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:19,250
and I promise
I'm gonna bring this back to Auden,

842
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:23,250
is that which is
not only ineffable

843
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:24,541
but unthought.

844
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:31,083
I've been really turned on
by Ricœur's recent thinking

845
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:33,625
on linguistic hospitality and…

846
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:39,083
How about his name, Ricœur…

847
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:42,166
Gosh, I should really
lean into that second syllable,

848
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,250
because, God, he comes from the heart.

849
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:46,583
Um…

850
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:48,333
The apple…

851
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:52,416
<i>An object…</i>

852
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:09,583
Oh, I'm reading the most astounding piece
on Auden's "The Crisis" by Leda Caruso,

853
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:13,333
and it seems to me
that she has anticipated

854
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:16,750
Ricœur's recent thinking
on linguistic hospitality.

855
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:17,708
For her…

856
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:25,916
hospitality comes
in holding one's attention,

857
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:27,750
even in crisis.

858
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,708
As Simone Weil says,

859
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:36,041
"Attention is the rarest
and purest form of generosity."

860
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,250
Suddenly he was
just saying my name. And it was…

861
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,000
It was crazy.

862
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:46,666
He was… No, he was talking
about the Auden publication.

863
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:48,833
He was saying that, um…

864
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:54,500
He was saying that I had anticipated
Ricœur's work on translation and…

865
01:13:57,375 --> 01:14:01,041
That, yeah. That I had anticipated
Ricœur's work on translation,

866
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:03,916
and it was just…
I mean, it was…

867
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:05,833
…wild.

868
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:08,208
And Cole looked like

869
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:09,416
<i>his eyes were going to…</i>

870
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,458
<i>He turned around in slow motion.
He was absolutely raging.</i>

871
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:17,416
Leda Caruso is inside
Auden's private mythology.

872
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:23,291
Thank God, because whenever
one tries to suppress doubt,

873
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:25,875
there is tyranny.

874
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:37,000
She's got chicken pox?

875
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:42,041
That's crazy, she just had a little cold.
Does she have a fever?

876
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,125
Oh.

877
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:46,250
That's not really a fever.

878
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:47,375
No.

879
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:51,958
I haven't… I haven't even…
I haven't even read his recent work.

880
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:54,500
It was all my own thinking.

881
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:59,708
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put her on the phone.

882
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,125
Hi, sweetheart.

883
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:12,208
Hi. Is it itchy?

884
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:15,791
Aw, I know.
It's not very nice.

885
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,291
Did Daddy give you a DVD?

886
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:23,708
Yeah, well, just don't forget
it gets a little bit scary when the…

887
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:26,333
Um, can you just hang on
one minute, sweetheart?

888
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:27,916
Yeah. Coming. One--

889
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:34,625
Oh.

890
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:37,291
- Sorry to disturb you.
- No, no, no. Not at all.

891
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:40,375
I came by to congratulate you
on your success tonight.

892
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,708
Oh, thank you.

893
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:44,458
You'll have to get
the Yeats piece finished now.

894
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:47,166
- Another publication is important.
- Yeah. For sure.

895
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:50,041
Yes. I'll tell Hardy how we're working.

896
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:53,916
Dinner is in 20 minutes
in the dining room.

897
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,875
I've arranged a seat for you.

898
01:15:56,958 --> 01:15:59,750
Oh, my goodness.
Um… Thank you.

899
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:21,541
Hello. Sorry, I think this is my car.

900
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:28,708
- You think it's your car?
- Yeah. It's a rental.

901
01:16:32,875 --> 01:16:33,958
Excuse us.

902
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:39,000
- Lyle tells me you're renting his place.
- Did he?

903
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,000
Mmm.

904
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:43,625
I mean, teachers get to take
the whole summer off. That's nice.

905
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:45,916
Well, it's a working holiday.

906
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:50,625
I like it. Yeah.

907
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:51,708
Me too.

908
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:57,250
You know, thanks for helping
with Elena the other day.

909
01:16:57,333 --> 01:17:00,583
And with Nina. She can get spacey.

910
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:03,291
Sure. Excuse me.

911
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:08,583
- Oh. Not my car. It's…
- No.

912
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,000
Bye.

913
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:17,208
Bye.

914
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:43,083
I didn't realize you were here.

915
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:47,625
- It's really great to meet you.
- It's great to meet you too.

916
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:50,166
Your work is thrilling.

917
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:52,666
Thank you.

918
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:54,666
Thrilling.

919
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,458
Thank you.

920
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:12,916
He is a serious scholar, but--

921
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:16,083
It's amazing to see. Amazing.

922
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,958
- What is?
- Well…

923
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:24,000
It would be interesting to see his tactics
as he renews his pursuit this evening.

924
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:38,458
Excuse me.

925
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,625
Where is the waiter?

926
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:54,208
Some Champagne, please.

927
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:57,916
Don't cry! No, no, no!

928
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,708
I loved…
I loved the jokes about their names.

929
01:19:02,916 --> 01:19:05,416
- It made you seem more human.
- Human?

930
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,583
- As opposed to what?
- As opposed to a god.

931
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,416
Ah. Mmm.

932
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:15,708
Your name. Leda. It's very provocative.

933
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:18,458
You're thinking
about the Yeats.

934
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:23,625
Very high-minded.
It always brings rape to mind.

935
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:24,666
Jesus.

936
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,166
I bet you know it by heart.

937
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:30,500
- In Italian.
- Ah.

938
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:37,583

Uh, mm…

943
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,416
Staggering girl.

944
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:58,125
<i>Sconcertante.</i>

945
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:00,125
<i>Si, ragazza.</i>

946
01:20:01,416 --> 01:20:04,083
<i>Sconcertante.</i>

947
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:05,958
Mmm.

948
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:12,708
I want to go to bed with you.

949
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:18,333
But it looks like you're married, so…

950
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:24,541
you'll have to start this.

951
01:21:30,291 --> 01:21:33,000
Hi!

952
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:34,291
Hello!

953
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,500
Hello, little hug monkeys.

954
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:46,958
I missed you.

955
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,125
- Did you miss me?
- Yeah.

956
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,708
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

957
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:07,208
<i>- </i><i>Hiya, fatso.</i>

958
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:11,250
<i>Fatso is right.
Look at me, bulging out of my own clothes.</i>

959
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:34,791
I'd fuck that hole.

960
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:36,750
Nah, she's too old, yo.

961
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:41,208
I'd let her suck my cock
if I didn't have to look at her face.

962
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:52,166
Excuse me, please,
we're trying to watch this film.

963
01:22:56,375 --> 01:22:57,708
Okay.

964
01:22:57,791 --> 01:23:01,291
Hey! If you can't control yourselves,
we're gonna have to call the usher.

965
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:04,125
The usher! The usher!
She's gonna call the usher, yo.

966
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:08,250
Yeah, bitch.
Call the usher! Call that cocksucker!

967
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:19,208
Hello?

968
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:24,833
Hello?

969
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:28,708
Is anyone there?

970
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:31,791
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Hi.

971
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:36,291
Hi. There's a group of boys
being extremely disruptive in theater two.

972
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:40,208
- Disruptive?
- Throwing popcorn, shouting at the screen.

973
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:42,208
Shouting at other people. Disruptive.

974
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:45,250
Okay. Do you want your money back?

975
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:47,083
No. I want you to do something about it.

976
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:50,875
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry. I can take care of it.

977
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:52,875
Just give me a minute here, okay?

978
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:54,208
- Thank you.
- Okay.

979
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:06,958
<i>What happened to her hand?</i>

980
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:08,625
Fuck you!

981
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:18,916
<i>You better be beautiful.
A genius, and terribly rich.</i>

982
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:23,208
<i>The beauty she got from my daughter.
The genius she inherited from me.</i>

983
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:25,916
<i>You better get busy
with your contribution, my boy.</i>

984
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,625
<i>The last nine months
I devoted to you.</i>

985
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:34,125
<i>Now I'm gonna have fun.
What do you say, sweetheart?</i>

986
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:36,083
<i>Whee!</i>

987
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,166
No! I'm gonna cut
your tiny, little dicks off

988
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,000
and feed them to you like peanuts.

989
01:24:57,958 --> 01:25:00,416
This is unacceptable!
I'm calling the police!

990
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,625
Call the police, bitch. Call the police.

991
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:06,208
Blue Lives Matter! Blue Lives Matter!
Blue Lives Matter!

992
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:07,250
Enough!

993
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:09,291
<i>Not much of a story, is it?</i>

994
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:13,416
<i>You know how Americans in Paris
love to read about Americans in Paris.</i>

995
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,333
<i>All right. What's your name?</i>

996
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:16,333
Fuck you!

997
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,458
<i>That's my girl.</i>

998
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:41,208
- Mama, do you have a snack?
- Mm-hmm.

999
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:42,541
Did you bring a snack?

1000
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:44,500
Uh… Oh, shit.

1001
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:47,958
Um, we'll get something later.
Why don't you go up there and play?

1002
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:51,541
Mama, the balloon man's here.

1003
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:53,541
I want a whale one.

1004
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:56,750
I know he can make whales.

1005
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:01,791
<i>Il fulmine!</i>

La loro vera madre era mia moglie.</i>

01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,250
<i>E il loro vero padre era Zeus.</i>

1008
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,458
Fucking brilliant.
You're so fucking brilliant.

1009

<i>Mama.</i>

1010
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:20,250
Mmm.

1011
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:23,375
I don't want
to come in your mouth.

1012
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:27,583
I want to wait until you're inside me.

1013
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,958
Well, maybe it's good for you
not to get exactly what you want.

1014
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:41,541
Please, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama. Please.

1015
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:47,458
Oh, fuck, yeah.

1016
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:52,166
Yes, baby. I'm gonna
get you sweets from London. Mm-hmm.

1017
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,083
What?

1018
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:55,500
I can't…

1019
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:58,416
Bia… I can't…

1020
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:02,208
Bianca, can you turn the phone around?
I can't… I can't hear Martha.

1021
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:03,833
Hmm?

1022
01:27:04,416 --> 01:27:08,375
Aw! Okay, babies.
I can't wait to see you too. I love you.

1023
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:11,791
No, you hang up first.
It's better that way.

1024
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:17,041
Okay. Love you. Bye. Bye-bye.

1025
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:19,666
I love you.

1026
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,833
Okay.

1027
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:27,791
I hate talking to my kids on the phone.

1028
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:29,625
What?

1029
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,500
I hate talking
to my kids on the phone.

1030
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,541
- They don't like it either.
- Don't say that.

1031
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:39,583
They don't.

1032
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:42,375
Don't say that.

1033
01:27:47,875 --> 01:27:48,833
Okay.

1034
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:08,458
Hello?

1035
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:13,541
Hello?

1036
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:40,000
Shit.

1037
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:51,250
Hello?

1038
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:53,583
Yeah, this is she.

1039
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:57,750
Oh, is everything okay?

1040
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:05,041
Uh, yeah, I'm at the last store
by the boats. It sells vintage jewelry.

1041
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:07,750
I won't move from here.

1042
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:19,291
I've been following you
for, like, ten minutes.

1043
01:29:19,375 --> 01:29:22,458
- Yeah, you said, is everything okay?
- What? Yeah?

1044
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:29,250
Your number came up on my phone yesterday.

1045
01:29:30,541 --> 01:29:33,333
- You called me?
- I did. Yeah.

1046
01:29:33,416 --> 01:29:34,416
Lady.

1047
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:37,000
Hey, little one. Are you feeling better?

1048
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:38,875
She needs her medicine.

1049
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:41,208
- Your doll, is she sick?
- She's not getting over it.

1050
01:29:42,375 --> 01:29:44,875
She wants her doll. Shit.

1051
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,208
- It won't stay on.
- Oh, hey.

1052
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:55,166
Can I?

1053
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:59,625
My grandma used to use hat pins.
It won't fall off now.

1054
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,750
Okay. Hat.

1055
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:06,625
All right?

1056
01:30:08,541 --> 01:30:10,333
Do it where it's comfy.

1057
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:26,125
Since the doll went missing,
she's been, like, actually

1058
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:28,458
driving me fucking crazy.

1059
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:30,125
I…

1060
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,333
There's something wrong with her.
She's not sleeping.

1061
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:37,041
At all. She won't sleep
unless I'm in the bed with her.

1062
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:38,666
And if I move…

1063
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:41,750
I'm really tired. I'm, like, scary tired.

1064
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:43,166
Mm, I remember.

1065
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:53,291
I know you saw me with Will.

1066
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,458
Um…

1067
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:00,916
I don't want you to think badly of me.

1068
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,291
I don't think badly of anyone.

1069
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:05,333
Yeah.

1070
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:09,250
Yeah, uh, see, I knew that.
As soon as I saw you, I just…

1071
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:12,791
I was like, "I wanna be like that lady."

1072
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:18,416
<i>It didn't mean anything,
what you saw.</i>

1073
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,750
<i>Didn't it?</i>

1074
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,166
No.

1075
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:26,291
<i>I don't let it go anywhere. I just…</i>

1076
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:30,041
But I'm happy.

1077
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:33,666
I'm happy with Elena,
with-- with everything.

1078
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:34,666
I'm…

1079
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:38,666
I met my husband so young.

1080
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,458
And he's fucking crazy about me.

1081
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:44,333
And her.

1082
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:48,458
He says my breasts
are exactly the size of his hand.

1083
01:31:50,416 --> 01:31:52,333
What would he do
if he saw you with Will?

1084
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:54,708
Oh, he'd cut my throat.

1085
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:56,833
I don't want to talk about him.

1086
01:31:56,916 --> 01:32:00,125
I only have, like, five minutes
before Callie finishes shopping.

1087
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:01,583
She doesn't want you to talk to me?

1088
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:03,666
She doesn't want me
to do fucking anything.

1089
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:05,000
Who gives a fuck?

1090
01:32:10,666 --> 01:32:12,041
Can I ask you something?

1091
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,958
Sure.

1092
01:32:16,708 --> 01:32:18,375
What happened in the toy store?

1093
01:32:23,416 --> 01:32:25,708
You were talking
about your daughters and then

1094
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,666
something happened.

1095
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:31,875
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1096
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:33,708
Yeah.

1097
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,458
I left.

1098
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:46,250
Oh.

1099
01:32:48,541 --> 01:32:51,708
When the oldest was seven
and the youngest was five, I left.

1100
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:57,291
I abandoned them
and I didn't see them for three years.

1101
01:32:57,375 --> 01:32:59,916
You didn't see your children
for three years?

1102
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,958
No.

1103
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:06,541
Who took care of them?

1104
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:10,333
Their father and my mum,
and then I came back for them.

1105
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,666
What did it feel like without them?

1106
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:24,125
It felt amazing.

1107
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:31,541
Felt like I'd been trying not to explode
and then I exploded.

1108
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:38,541
That doesn't sound amazing.

1109
01:33:39,541 --> 01:33:40,541
Okay.

1110
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:49,625
- There's Callie and your husband.
- My husband?

1111
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:52,833
What the fuck is he doing here?

1112
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:55,083
He's not supposed to be here
until tomorrow.

1113
01:33:56,666 --> 01:33:58,375
Fuck. I have to go.

1114
01:34:34,291 --> 01:34:37,166
Hi, guys.

1115
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:41,833
- Hey.
- Hi.

1116
01:34:41,916 --> 01:34:43,416
Hmm.

1117
01:34:45,166 --> 01:34:49,083
What are you doing?
Say hello to Mummy.

1118
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:52,250
Martha. Go on. Go say hello.

1119
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:55,625
It's okay.

1120
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,500
- Can I get a hug?
- Go on.

1121
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:02,500
Oh!

1122
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:06,541
Mmm.

1123
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:09,166
Are you home now, Mummy?

1124
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:10,500
I'm home today.

1125
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:14,958
Can you wash my hair after dinner?

1126
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:20,666
Mm-mmm. I can't stay for dinner, baby.
I've got to get on an airplane.

1127
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:22,041
Oh, okay.

1128
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:27,583
But I brought you presents. Hmm?

1129
01:35:28,416 --> 01:35:30,166
And fancy dresses.

1130
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:36,125
These.

1131
01:35:37,291 --> 01:35:38,166
Hi.

1132
01:35:40,791 --> 01:35:42,125
Yours!

1133
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:53,375
You awoke the tickle monster.
There's a tickle monster in town.

1134
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:58,458
Bianca? Do you want me to help you
do your buttons up in the back?

1135
01:35:58,541 --> 01:35:59,625
No.

1136
01:36:00,125 --> 01:36:01,125
Okay.

1137
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:04,541
Show me your dress.

1138
01:36:05,041 --> 01:36:07,708
Oh! So pretty.

1139
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,500
Mwah.

1140
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:15,583
- Leda, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

1141
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:25,958
Please. Please don't this.

1142
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:29,541
Come on, what do you fucking need?
Do need me on my knees?

1143
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:32,708
Do you need me to cut my balls off?
What do you need? Tell me.

1144
01:36:34,291 --> 01:36:36,833
Have you got his cock in your mouth,
you can't answer me?

1145
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,708
Joe, this has nothing to do with that.

1146
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:40,500
Oh, fuck me? Fuck me?

1147
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:42,000
- I left him.
- You left him?

1148
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:44,250
Congratulations, baby,
you're an expert. Huh?

1149
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:46,958
Do you think I'm a fucking idiot? Huh?

1150
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,875
Am I an arsehole?

1151
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:52,583
Please. Please. Please. Please. Come on.

1152
01:36:54,166 --> 01:36:57,666
They're little fucking girls.
How am I supposed to do this?

1153
01:36:58,916 --> 01:37:00,750
Joe, I'm feeling dizzy.

1154
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:06,250
I'm taking them to your mum's.
I can't handle this.

1155
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:08,166
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

1156
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:10,458
You're threatening me?

1157
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:13,458
That is revenge.

1158
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:17,000
That's fuck… Lazy.

1159
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:20,750
You bring them back there, and they're
going to sink into that black shithole.

1160
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:25,250
All the fucking <i>shit…</i> that I came from.

1161
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:28,041
I do think you're an arsehole.

1162
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:29,666
My mother didn't even finish school.

1163
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,083
Oh, fucking so what?

1164
01:37:35,833 --> 01:37:37,083
Mm-hmm.

1165
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:01,541
- Mama.
- Yeah?

1166
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:05,916

like a snake?

1167
01:38:06,583 --> 01:38:07,666

01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:01,041
Okay.

1222
01:44:01,708 --> 01:44:04,416
I have, uh, something to ask you.

1223
01:44:05,333 --> 01:44:07,416
- What?
- Do you mind if I come up?

1224
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:10,125
I do, actually.

1225
01:44:11,583 --> 01:44:12,583
Okay.

1226
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:14,375
Um…

1227
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:19,958
Nina was wondering if you would be willing
to lend us your place for a few hours.

1228
01:44:23,208 --> 01:44:26,083
Would you tell Nina
I'd like to talk to her?

1229
01:44:27,583 --> 01:44:29,291
- When?
- Whenever she wants.

1230
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:32,375
Her husband doesn't leave till Sunday,
so before that, it's impossible.

1231
01:44:32,458 --> 01:44:33,625
Monday's fine.

1232
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:36,333
Are you angry?

1233
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,250
- No.
- You seem angry.

1234
01:44:40,125 --> 01:44:44,333
No, Will, the caretaker knows Nina
and has business with her husband.

1235
01:44:44,416 --> 01:44:47,041
Lyle? You give him €20
and he's not gonna say anything.

1236
01:44:48,291 --> 01:44:50,500
Why are you asking this
of <i>me</i> in particular?

1237
01:44:53,833 --> 01:44:55,125
Uh…

1238
01:44:55,208 --> 01:44:56,541
Nina asked me to.

1239
01:45:06,125 --> 01:45:07,166
All right.

1240
01:45:17,666 --> 01:45:18,750
Get up!

1241
01:45:20,708 --> 01:45:24,083
- Get up!
- Elena.

1242
01:45:25,791 --> 01:45:27,291
Get up.

1243
01:45:31,166 --> 01:45:32,208
Up.

1244
01:45:37,916 --> 01:45:38,875
Get up!

1245
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:41,541
Get… Mmm.

1246
01:45:42,208 --> 01:45:43,916
Get up!

1247
01:45:47,416 --> 01:45:50,625
Mommy, get up!

1248
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:52,333
Mommy, get up!

1249
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,125
Come to the sea, Mommy.

1250
01:45:56,708 --> 01:45:59,333
- Come to the sea, Mommy.
- I'll take her.

1251
01:45:59,416 --> 01:46:00,666
I'm going.

1252
01:46:03,708 --> 01:46:04,875
Lay off.

1253
01:46:10,916 --> 01:46:11,916
Come on.

1254
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:23,458
Do you need
a hand with your bags?

1255
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:25,958
- What?
- Do you need a hand?

1256
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:28,375
My aunt asked me to ask you.

1257
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:31,666
No, thank you.

1258
01:47:19,958 --> 01:47:20,833
Yes?

1259
01:47:21,666 --> 01:47:22,875
<i>It's Nina.</i>

1260
01:47:41,875 --> 01:47:43,583
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

1261
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,500
I thought you couldn't come till Monday.

1262
01:47:46,083 --> 01:47:47,125
No.

1263
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,125
Well, give me a second to get dressed.

1264
01:47:50,208 --> 01:47:53,250
Um, no, I-- I have, like,
literally a minute. I just…

1265
01:47:54,041 --> 01:47:58,458
Uh, I told Callie that I was gonna go
and get some nose drops for Elena

1266
01:47:58,541 --> 01:48:00,416
because she is always in the water.

1267
01:48:01,583 --> 01:48:03,708
And she can't get rid of her cold, so…

1268
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:05,958
Have a seat.

1269
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:19,958
It's lovely here.

1270
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:23,333
Yeah. So, do you want the keys?

1271
01:48:24,958 --> 01:48:26,375
If it's all right with you.

1272
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:28,166
Doesn't have much to do with me.

1273
01:48:29,083 --> 01:48:30,250
It doesn't?

1274
01:48:32,708 --> 01:48:34,916
You told me you were happy
with your husband.

1275
01:48:35,416 --> 01:48:36,666
I did.

1276
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:39,000
Yeah, you told me
you were happy with everything.

1277
01:48:40,416 --> 01:48:41,541
I am.

1278
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:45,291
I don't know.

1279
01:48:51,666 --> 01:48:53,166
What do you think?

1280
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:55,208
I think you should do what you want.

1281
01:48:57,708 --> 01:48:58,958
Where do you live?

1282
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:02,166
Cambridge, near Boston.

1283
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,916
- I'll come see you.
- Well, I will leave you my address.

1284
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:09,708
Okay.

1285
01:49:12,416 --> 01:49:15,250
- Is this gonna pass?
- What?

1286
01:49:20,625 --> 01:49:22,208
I don't know what to call it.

1287
01:49:25,375 --> 01:49:29,791
I have depression, or something…

1288
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,416
But it passes.

1289
01:49:36,125 --> 01:49:38,125
Thought you said you were in a hurry.

1290
01:49:38,208 --> 01:49:39,208
I am.

1291
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:45,875
If it felt amazing, then why did you
go back to your daughters?

1292
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:52,083
I'm their mother.
I went back 'cause I missed them.

1293
01:49:52,625 --> 01:49:54,416
I'm a very selfish person.

1294
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:05,125
I need to give you something else too.

1295
01:50:07,875 --> 01:50:08,958
Are you okay?

1296
01:50:09,041 --> 01:50:11,750
Yeah, it just, um, happens
when I stand up too quickly.

1297
01:50:27,916 --> 01:50:29,041
What?

1298
01:50:30,375 --> 01:50:31,750
You found her?

1299
01:50:35,833 --> 01:50:38,541
- Where did you find her?
- No, I took her.

1300
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:41,166
Why?

1301
01:50:42,208 --> 01:50:44,416
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1302
01:50:46,791 --> 01:50:47,791
No.

1303
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:49,958
But I don't understand.

1304
01:50:50,625 --> 01:50:54,541
Did you think that the doll--
that the doll wasn't good for us?

1305
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:58,750
- I was just playing.
- Playing?

1306
01:51:00,166 --> 01:51:03,291
We were all… messed up.

1307
01:51:05,208 --> 01:51:06,416
You saw us.

1308
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,416
I'm an unnatural mother.

1309
01:51:14,375 --> 01:51:16,458
- Oh, fuck.
- I'm sorry.

1310
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:19,708
Fuck! This is fucked!

1311
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:24,291
Oh, Nina, take the keys!

1312
01:51:24,375 --> 01:51:27,666
I'm leaving tonight. The apartment's
gonna be empty till the end of the month.

1313
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:30,208
- Nina, I'm so sorry.
- I don't want anything from you.

1314
01:51:30,291 --> 01:51:32,125
You're so young and it doesn't pass.

1315
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:35,166
- None of this pass--
- You fucking sick cunt.

1316
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:38,375
Better watch
your fucking back, bitch!

1317
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:29,291
<i>- What is that?
- It's called a navel.</i>

1318
01:54:29,375 --> 01:54:31,375
<i>Why's it called a navel?</i>

1319
01:54:31,458 --> 01:54:33,125
<i>It's called a navel because…</i>

1320
01:54:33,208 --> 01:54:35,250
- You know another word for navel?
- No.

1321
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:38,375
- Belly button!
- Belly button, yeah, that's right.

1322
01:54:39,125 --> 01:54:41,375
- Fart button!
- It looks like a belly button.

1323
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:43,416
<i>- It looks like a belly button.</i>

1324
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,583
<i>That one looks like an outie.</i>

1325
01:54:47,041 --> 01:54:49,208
<i>And the other one
looks like an innie.</i>

1326
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:51,875
<i>- Hello?
- Bianca, it's Mum.</i>

1327
01:54:51,958 --> 01:54:54,208
<i>Mama! Martha!</i>

1328
01:54:54,291 --> 01:54:55,666
You're both there.

1329
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:58,375
- <i>Hi, Mama.</i>
- Martha, little one.

1330
01:54:58,458 --> 01:55:01,541
<i>I left you so many messages.
I thought you were dead.</i>

1331
01:55:01,625 --> 01:55:02,708
- Dead?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1332
01:55:04,833 --> 01:55:06,208
<i>Are you all right, Mama?</i>

1333
01:55:06,291 --> 01:55:07,625
No, I'm alive actually.

1334
01:55:25,708 --> 01:55:28,333
Go on.

1335
01:55:29,583 --> 01:55:31,416
Tell me all about it.

1336
01:55:43,875 --> 01:55:48,083
Peel it like a snake.
Don't let it break.

1337
01:55:48,166 --> 01:55:50,250
Peel it like a snake…
