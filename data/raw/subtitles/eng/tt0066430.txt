May I ask Maestro Haydn
what this is?

4
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:49,559
The symphony you ordered,
Your Excellency. In F sharp minor.

5
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:52,361
Called the Farewell Symphony.

6
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,000
It was my idea.

7
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:56,518
That was a good joke, dear Liszt.

8
00:01:56,607 --> 00:02:00,395
Just as well you didn't say
the idea was mine.

9
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:03,917
Otherwise it would have been
the end of me.

10
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:10,442
Twice he has set me to the farm.

11
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:13,843
Once I'm a musician,
another time a shepherd.

12
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,724
One day I'll go any stay out there
for good.

13
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,883
- Good night, Maestro.
- Good night.

28
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:18,681
Good, Putzi...

29
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:21,601
A little quick, however...

30
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:25,119
Haydn should be played more softly.

31
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:29,759
You know how he saved
your grandfather

32
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:31,883
from the prince's wrath...

33
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,004
Then the old prince died,
his son didn't like music,

34
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,079
so Haydn went to London.

35
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,925
Your grandfather stayed put,
and me, too.

36
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:44,885
Well, perhaps you...

37
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:47,275
Play it again.

38
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:00,675
Soon he'll know more than I do.

39
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:03,438
We must find him a teacher.

40
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,717
He should go to Pressbourg.

41
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:10,444
No, to Vienna.
To Hummel or Czerny.

42
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:14,436
Excellent!
Once more.

43
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,956
Why are you doing this
to me, sir?

44
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:01,035
What?

45
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:04,005
Making me play it again and again,
if it's excellent?

46
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,044
So that it can be
even more excellent.

47
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:10,236
Once more.

48
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,243
That was beautiful.

49
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:49,842
What do you think of Thalberg?

50
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,157
His concerts have caused
a great stir.

51
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:55,438
Paris always bows to great names.

52
00:08:56,287 --> 00:09:00,166
It is said that he is
the best pianist today.

53
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:02,439
But you are unique.

54
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,764
I am enraptured by your playing.

55
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:08,807
Playing... Nothing but playing...

56
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,403
I want something else
from Marie d'Agoult.

57
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:17,439
One word... to give me happiness.

58
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:22,204
Be serious, Francois.

59
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,562
Enter the lists against Thalberg.

60
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:34,805
A brilliant tourney
of troubadours.

61
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:39,680
Yes, but troubadours
were not criticized in papers.

62
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:44,360
For weeks now I've been reading
silly articles

63
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,520
about the race we'll run
for precedence.

64
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:52,840
In our prosaic age
things lose their glamour.

65
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,798
What does Berlioz think
of this competition?

66
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,845
He hates anything tasteless.

67
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,356
He is certain
I shall win.

68
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:04,239
He calls me the pianist of the century.

69
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,366
But we know Berlioz.

70
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:08,603
He often exaggerates.

71
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:11,115
Exaggerations are based on truth.

72
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,325
I hope so.

73
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:19,037
Francois, compete with Thalberg.

74
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:24,156
I'll take along my friends.
George Sandm Hugo, Rossini, Berlioz...

75
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:26,565
Do, please, for my sake.

76
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:37,358
All right.
Just for your sake, Marie.

77
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:44,077
Thalberg! Thalberg!

78
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:46,362
Oh, Berlioz!
What do you think of Thalberg?

79
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,200
He is a virtuoso.

80
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,960
But his virtuosity is closer
to mannerism.

81
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:53,003
And why is he playing
his own work?

82
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,403
I won't play Beethoven, either,

83
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:57,324
but a piece of my own:
Mazeppa.

84
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:58,846
How about that?

85
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,845
You are a real composer,
while Thalberg...

86
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:04,276
he can hardly be called that.

87
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,682
And as to Beethoven,

88
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:11,158
he'd like to hear you play
the Moonlight Sonata.

89
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,124
Thalberg could not cope
with it,

90
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,596
though he is deemed
the best in Austria.

91
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,319
Do not exaggerate, Hector.

92
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:20,717
He is equally successful in Paris.

93
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:24,925
So are you,
especially with the ladies.

94
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:28,643
I'm not complaining.
It wouldn't be fair.

95
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,366
And not worthy of a real artist, either.

96
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:33,643
Prepare for the contest,
Maestro.

97
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,235
I'll go and keep
my fingers crossed for you.

98
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:39,561
Good luck.

99
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:44,445
Silence!
Throw them out!

100
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,725
This is virtuosity,
my friend.

101
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:26,719
- We are lucky, aren't we?
- Where is Thalberg?

102
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:35,279
With a heavy heart,
I must admit,

103
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,158
you have vanquished me,
Liszt.

104
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:41,718
Wishing you well,
your obedient servant: Thalberg.

105
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:45,083
I knew it was worth trying.
This is victory!

106
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:47,597
Victory?
Really?

107
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,479
Mr. Liszt, madam.

108
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:54,922
Show him in.

109
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:12,685
I've just heard what happened.

110
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,596
I know how you must feel.

111
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,320
How could you know?

112
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:25,521
You're lucky.
Work, travel, success...

113
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:28,725
I buried my daughter!

114
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:31,125
I've left my husband.

115
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,721
Each day I grow lonelier.

116
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:37,677
Do you think, I'm not lonely, too?

117
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,036
I'm always lonely,
away from you.

118
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:46,358
You are praised.

119
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:50,603
Your art gives people happiness.

120
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:52,396
And me?

121
00:19:56,367 --> 00:20:00,201
Only you can make me happy
by sharing my solitude.

122
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:01,601
Come to me.

123
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:05,405
- No!
- Come!

124
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:06,926
No, that's impossible.

125
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:58,683
This singing tears lovers
from their embrace.

126
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:01,679
What a sad and lovely tune!

127
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:04,165
Do you know it?

128
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,602
I is about Torquato Tasso,
the poet.

129
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,402
Venetians sing many songs about him.

130
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:11,324
Tasso. When did he live?

131
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,365
In the 16th century.

132
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:17,562
He was an unhappy genius.

133
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:19,923
Goethe wrote a drama
about him.

134
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:21,197
Listen!

135
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:26,718
"With every day
your glories pass away,

136
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:28,320
Oh, mortal life!

137
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:30,284
We fade as do the flowers,

138
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:33,683
And though the month of May
we see return,

139
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,799
The spring will not be ours.

140
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:40,006
Gather roses till the eye of day
shines bright.

141
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:43,517
After that there come
the darkest hours.

142
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:47,322
Gather the roses of love
while it is requited.

143
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:49,802
Pluck them while you may. "

144
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:56,879
"Gather the roses of love
while it is requited.

145
00:22:57,687 --> 00:22:59,757
Pluck them while you may. "

146
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:05,845
Darling, how blind I was
without you!

147
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,844
Shall we go for a stroll?

148
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:09,838
Why, you have already seen
everything.

149
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:11,758
I have and I haven't.

150
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:17,717
Before I met you, towns
were only concert halls for me.

151
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:24,396
Come in.

152
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:32,201
Concerts... concerts...

153
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:34,486
This is for you.

154
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:43,120
Floods in Pest!

155
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:47,676
CHARITY CONCERT
FOR FLOOD VICTIMS

156
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:42,723
Well, superintendent?

157
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:48,359
Information on Liszt
is pretty bad.

158
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:51,804
He's a dangerous revolutionary,

159
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:53,599
and anti-church...

160
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:57,203
He's having an affair with
Count d'Agoult's wife.

161
00:24:57,487 --> 00:25:01,036
He doesn't hide
his subversive ideas,

162
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:04,124
not even here in Vienna...

163
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,877
Since he heard about the floods
in Pest,

164
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,599
he's discovered he is Hungarian.

165
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:11,801
He is wanton, conceited,

166
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:15,797
and though a good artist,
wholly insignificant.

167
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:13,325
Bravo! Vivat!

168
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:29,037
I've given the proceeds of the concert
to the Hungarian gentlemen.

169
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:34,679
25,000 Forints as an aid
to the flood victims.

170
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:36,445
Thank you, dear friend.

171
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:56,125
- Is this Hungary yet?
- Yes. Maestro.

172
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:55,998
Welcome home!

173
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:09,887
My wild and distant country,
I'm here. I greet you.

174
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:55,359
Take this sword,
Prince Bathory's sword,

175
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:57,684
in token of our affection.

176
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:01,356
May it remind you of our country
forever!

177
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:11,756
This sword, which once
defended Hungary,

178
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:15,000
has come into weak
and peaceful hands.

179
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,762
Is this not symbolic?

180
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:21,682
Does it not mean
that arts should now

181
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:26,084
bring new glory to Hungary?

182
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:30,960
But if need be, let us unsheathe
this sword,

183
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:36,886
and shed our blood for our truth
and our country.

184
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:46,636
Silence!

185
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,082
Silence!

186
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,877
And now, our great poet,
Vorosmarty.

187
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:06,078
Musician famed in every land,
Your country's loyal son,

188
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:10,043
Is the magic in your hand
To heal this country near undone?

189
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:15,965
Have you notes, rouser of the heart,
Notes that comfort with their art?

190
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:22,241
When one hears your rousing notes
awake a nation from her sleep,

191
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:26,280
And people join your song as one,

192
00:35:26,687 --> 00:35:31,158
Return and say with us,
Thanks be to God

193
00:35:31,807 --> 00:35:34,605
This nation has the will to live.

194
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,282
Silence!

195
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,279
Good bye, Princess.

196
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:49,278
I'm much honoured, Mr. Liszt.

197
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:51,875
- You'll have our best room, of course.
- Thank you.

198
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:56,244
I am your servant, Maestro.

199
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,757
Oh, are you, have we met?

200
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:00,957
But I really am your servant.

201
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:02,839
- Doing what, pray?
- Everything.

202
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:06,436
- That's too much.
- Please, listen to me.

203
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:11,995
I'm listening.

204
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:13,999
Let me introduce myself.

205
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:17,443
I'm Gaetano Belloni,
an impresario from Bologna.

206
00:38:17,727 --> 00:38:22,801
I devote my life to easing the burden
of the great. The greatest!

207
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:26,840
Organising concerts,
making propaganda...

208
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:29,646
It is not true that good wine
needs no bush.

209
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,246
It does, indeed.

210
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:34,757
Up to the solemn moment
when you begin to play,

211
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:37,236
every burden weighs
heavily on me,

212
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:39,682
on your humble servant, alone.

213
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:41,445
Mine is a lofty way of life!

214
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,599
And my task is sublime!

215
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:47,361
Thank you, dear Belloni,

216
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:50,564
but I can't avail myself
of your services.

217
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:52,439
I manage my affairs myself.

218
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:55,360
That's hurting!

219
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:59,799
The organ called pocket
by professors of anatomy

220
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:02,117
plays no role whatever
in my offer.

221
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,402
I'm just a minute part
of the crowd

222
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:08,036
thronging in the corridor
after your concerts

223
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:11,005
gasping and gaping.

224
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:14,124
Allow me to be your
number one fan,

225
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:17,717
and your indispensable servant.

226
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:29,959
You have my admiration,
Mr. Belloni.

227
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:34,205
Your soaring and businesslike
diction

228
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:37,438
equals my virtuosity
on the piano,

229
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:39,046
or even surpasses it.

230
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,761
But enough of these niceties.

231
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,439
I know I shan't get rid of you.

232
00:39:43,527 --> 00:39:45,119
I need a secretary, well?

233
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:58,162
My childhood dreams
have now come true.

234
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:08,366
Without my permission?
Oh, no!

235
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,846
Which is the lady's room?

236
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:12,879
No. 2, first floor.

237
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:14,923
Maestro! This is my duty!

238
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:16,520
No, leave it to me.

239
00:40:23,727 --> 00:40:26,241
Are you here already?

240
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:30,639
May I know by what right
you are using my name?

241
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:32,758
Oh, how cross you are!
Do you mind so much?

242
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,156
It was my impresario's idea.

243
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:36,839
Actually, I didn't like it.

244
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:39,606
It is unworthy of my art.

245
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:42,275
Unworthy.
To use my presence for...

246
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:43,999
I protested, sir.

247
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:48,599
The name of Lola Montez
can fill a theatre.

248
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:51,918
- But my impressario...
- You protested! Charming.

249
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:56,324
So don't... Promise?

250
00:40:57,127 --> 00:41:01,518
No, I shall abide by my word.

251
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:05,605
But it wasn't your word.

252
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:06,716
Never mind.

253
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:10,323
What if I have you expulsed?

254
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:13,999
I can, you know.
It is my concert.

255
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:21,518
You'll do nothing of the kind.

256
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:06,076
In Miss Montez's honor
I'll improvise a piece.

257
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:10,196
She'll honour me with a dance.

258
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:24,440
My sweet bird of passage!

259
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,800
My only love!

260
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:30,084
You lovely bird of passage.

261
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:33,326
You are no couch potato, are you?

262
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,318
You follow the flight
of your mate

263
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:37,199
and are fearless.

264
00:44:37,647 --> 00:44:40,480
We shall fly along together.

265
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:42,805
Together, yes.

266
00:44:43,207 --> 00:44:44,959
And you'll never leave me,
will you?

267
00:44:45,007 --> 00:44:46,804
Never.

268
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:50,523
But sir!

269
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:53,077
Your concert!
You can't leave!

270
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:54,520
Give the lady this ring.

271
00:44:54,647 --> 00:44:56,683
And follow me on the next stage.

272
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:59,964
Do you mean that we're parting
with the lady?

273
00:45:00,127 --> 00:45:01,765
It's better if I fly alone.

274
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,682
Stop!

275
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:50,563
You fairhaired Gypsy!
What do you take me for?

276
00:45:55,647 --> 00:46:00,038
Darling, I cannot live
without you.

277
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,682
My lovely bird of passage!

278
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:36,206
Where are you?

279
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:48,163
Open it.
You miserable wretch.

280
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,079
Strange.
She always met me...

281
00:47:25,527 --> 00:47:27,245
Maybe she didn't get the letter.

282
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:28,646
Impossible.

283
00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:37,276
Our little Cosima!
How you've grow.

284
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:40,796
Doesn't she recognize me?

285
00:47:41,847 --> 00:47:45,556
Don't you recognize
your daddy?

286
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:50,759
Why should she?

287
00:47:51,447 --> 00:47:55,281
She's lucky to see you
twice a year.

288
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:08,321
What's wrong?

289
00:48:09,207 --> 00:48:10,276
Nothing.

290
00:48:12,207 --> 00:48:13,356
Nothing?

291
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:18,637
Well, tell me about Germany.

292
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:20,759
Tell you what?

293
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:23,966
Oh, Dresden is a lovely town.

294
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:27,005
My Mozart transcription
was a fantastic success.

295
00:48:27,127 --> 00:48:29,561
There was a funny fellow there,
a conductor.

296
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:32,485
I can't remember his name.

297
00:48:32,527 --> 00:48:34,119
He exclaimed:

298
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:35,879
But for music like this,

299
00:48:36,007 --> 00:48:38,157
theatres should be burnt
to the ground.

300
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:40,078
He meant my paraphrasis
of Don Juan.

301
00:48:40,527 --> 00:48:42,916
Wagner! That's it!
Wagner's his name.

302
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:46,363
A crazy fellow.
To burn theatres down!

303
00:48:47,847 --> 00:48:49,724
What is it, Marie?

304
00:48:51,007 --> 00:48:52,201
Don Juan?

305
00:48:52,647 --> 00:48:54,877
Was it a great success?

306
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:58,437
A great success?
Just the usual thing.

307
00:48:58,487 --> 00:49:03,686
You should have earned special
success with your Don Juan.

308
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:08,000
I don't understand.

309
00:49:09,807 --> 00:49:12,446
Have a look at this, my friend.

310
00:49:19,687 --> 00:49:22,155
I met her in Dresden.
What cheek!

311
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:25,603
She had my name
printed on her poster.

312
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:27,839
And you obliged her.

313
00:49:28,207 --> 00:49:31,358
That's natural.
I couldn't let her down.

314
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:34,601
And you continued
to oblige her

315
00:49:34,687 --> 00:49:38,919
after her performance,
didn't you, Don Juan?

316
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:43,045
And what if I did?
I'm sorry.

317
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:47,245
Whose fault is it?

318
00:49:47,447 --> 00:49:51,281
Who wanted me to chase glory
like a fool?

319
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:53,881
Not I, nor the world.
You!

320
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,802
Yes, you!

321
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:02,276
When all I wished was to live
with you and work.

322
00:50:02,687 --> 00:50:05,997
With me?
In a small attic?

323
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:14,557
You know only too well that
you can't go on living as you do.

324
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:17,844
If you don't give up
this way of life...

325
00:50:18,847 --> 00:50:21,441
An attic may be attractive,
but what if I don't like it?

326
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:25,242
Or would you like me to support you
in the shadow of a glorious future?

327
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:27,837
But you know what I want!

328
00:50:28,327 --> 00:50:30,477
You don't want anything.

329
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,802
You are carried away by events,
by chance,

330
00:50:32,847 --> 00:50:36,681
by Belloni, by little Lola
and her kind.

331
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:38,602
Don Juan!

332
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,919
The irresistible Don Juan,

333
00:50:40,967 --> 00:50:45,836
who now knows all
about Tasso and Goethe.

334
00:50:50,207 --> 00:50:53,563
Poor Don Juan!

335
00:50:55,287 --> 00:50:57,755
Unloading, loading all the time...

336
00:50:57,807 --> 00:51:00,037
We've only just arrived.

337
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:02,362
You know, I was
a wholly ignorant fellow

338
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:04,921
when Marie took me
by the hand.

339
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:07,044
It was in her Paris salon
that I met

340
00:51:07,087 --> 00:51:10,602
Hugo, Georges Sand,
Dumas, Berlioz...

341
00:51:11,687 --> 00:51:16,078
Shouldn't you make it up?

342
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:19,725
This has become a prison to me.

343
00:51:20,887 --> 00:51:23,242
I must go my own way.

344
00:51:24,887 --> 00:51:25,956
Let's go.

345
00:51:48,047 --> 00:51:49,685
Here you are.

346
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:56,761
All right.

347
00:51:58,207 --> 00:51:59,640
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

348
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:01,518
Is it a long way to St. Petersburg?

349
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:04,637
About 300 versts.

350
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:07,205
When shall we get there?

351
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:10,725
If the weather holds out,
in 3 days.

352
00:52:11,247 --> 00:52:14,080
This is a big country, sir,
very big.

353
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:17,237
Then let us make haste.

354
00:53:10,927 --> 00:53:13,077
Where is our first concert to be?

355
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:15,004
In St. Petersburg.

356
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:36,637
- We must say good-bye, Carolyne.
- You're in a hurry, Nicky.

357
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:41,197
I told you Prince Galitzin
invited me to a shoot

358
00:53:41,327 --> 00:53:42,919
I could not refuse.

359
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:45,835
Though I'd prefer
to stay with you.

360
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:47,963
Will you be back by Christmas?

361
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:50,677
Why, I'll be back
in a few days.

362
00:53:51,047 --> 00:53:53,959
Is that why you sent
your entire wardrobe ahead?

363
00:53:55,687 --> 00:53:57,803
You know in what circles
I shall move.

364
00:53:58,007 --> 00:53:59,486
I won't be outdressed!

365
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:02,365
I wasn't reproaching you.

366
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:09,204
Carolyne, dear...

367
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:14,399
Prince Radziwill's man
will call on you.

368
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,560
How much?

369
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:21,445
Fifty. Sixty thousand roubles.

370
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:26,123
But never again.
You have my word.

371
00:54:27,407 --> 00:54:29,443
I know, Nicky.
Good bye.

372
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:06,520
"Through me you will come
to the land of torment... "

373
00:58:51,066 --> 00:58:53,587
He is a marvelous pianist,
and a great composer.

374
00:58:53,687 --> 00:58:55,687
Unparalleled in both.

375
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:19,514
What a day!
What a night!

376
01:01:19,614 --> 01:01:22,013
We've conquered St. Petersburg!

377
01:01:22,113 --> 01:01:24,625
The Maestro will be happy
to meet you.

378
01:01:28,941 --> 01:01:31,213
I'm lost for words.

379
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:33,498
I'm simply nonplussed.

380
01:01:33,598 --> 01:01:35,152
Thank you.

381
01:01:35,415 --> 01:01:38,368
We'll never forget this day.

382
01:01:38,468 --> 01:01:41,094
Let me introduce our Glinka to you.

383
01:01:41,194 --> 01:01:44,729
My dear Glinka!
I am much honoured!

384
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:59,153
Mr. Franz Liszt, Your Majesty.

385
01:02:26,072 --> 01:02:27,321
Your Majesty.

386
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,523
We are glad to make
your acquaintance.

387
01:02:32,205 --> 01:02:35,499
and regret not having been
to your concert.

388
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:44,699
Perhaps Your Majesty
will honour me another time.

389
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:48,901
My wife hear you in Weimar.
She was enraptured.

390
01:02:49,242 --> 01:02:52,535
I'd like to share her rapture.

391
01:02:53,558 --> 01:02:56,852
I hear you are Austrian.

392
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,237
No, Sire. I'm Hungarian.

393
01:02:59,805 --> 01:03:03,666
That is, a subject
of the Austrian Emperor.

394
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:07,528
Hungarians are a gallant people,
they say.

395
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:09,459
Indeed, Sire.

396
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:12,185
They are gallant
and freedom loving.

397
01:03:12,753 --> 01:03:14,570
So, it's true.

398
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:21,612
I've been informed, Mr. Liszt,
that you cherish certain ideas

399
01:03:22,066 --> 01:03:25,587
which are fashionable
in Europe.

400
01:03:25,687 --> 01:03:27,972
Yes, I cherish all noble ideas.

401
01:03:28,427 --> 01:03:32,856
But my army consists
but of these ten soldiers.

402
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:36,150
And my battlefield is the piano.

403
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:39,784
I hope they do not
alarm Your Majesty.

404
01:03:40,012 --> 01:03:46,031
I would not underrate
the role of your army.

405
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:47,131
Thank you, Sire.

406
01:03:47,735 --> 01:03:51,370
Is there anything else
that disturbs Your Majesty?

407
01:03:56,708 --> 01:04:02,500
Your hair and your politics.

408
01:04:03,182 --> 01:04:05,808
I am sorry, Sire,
my hair grew long in Paris.

409
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,520
condone this to an artist.

410
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:12,722
And to make politics
I'd need 300.000 soldiers.

411
01:04:19,878 --> 01:04:24,308
I'm sorry I'm late,
your Tsar kept me.

412
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:26,920
Our life for the Tsar!

413
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:29,532
They didn't mean him.

414
01:07:59,922 --> 01:08:05,183
If I'm not mistaken
you heard Russlan last night.

415
01:08:05,526 --> 01:08:07,927
I want your opinion.

416
01:08:08,027 --> 01:08:09,643
Yes, Your Highness?

417
01:08:09,743 --> 01:08:15,589
Morals have become loose
in the army lately.

418
01:08:15,689 --> 01:08:18,677
I've to render
more severe punishment.

419
01:08:18,777 --> 01:08:22,451
Do you think
it would solve the problem

420
01:08:22,551 --> 01:08:26,911
if I punished my officers
by sending them to this opera?

421
01:08:27,597 --> 01:08:30,799
That would be a wise step,
Your Highness.

422
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:32,972
Is that a compliment?

423
01:08:33,072 --> 01:08:34,458
By no means.

424
01:08:34,558 --> 01:08:37,317
Culture would profit
your officers.

425
01:08:38,003 --> 01:08:43,950
I would extend these measures to those
who are not being punished, too.

426
01:08:46,809 --> 01:08:50,811
Tell me, sir, have you
ever been in battle?

427
01:08:50,911 --> 01:08:53,327
I am the pianist Franz Liszt.

428
01:08:53,427 --> 01:08:55,157
- Who are you?
- A prince.

429
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,673
Nicholas Sayn-Wittgenstein.

430
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:00,189
Let me repeat the question.

431
01:09:00,289 --> 01:09:02,361
Have you ever been in a battle?

432
01:09:02,704 --> 01:09:06,478
Never.
Have you ever given a concert?

433
01:09:09,108 --> 01:09:14,254
Without us, soldiers,
who would defend your lives?

434
01:09:14,712 --> 01:09:20,430
If life had no sublime moments,
what would be worth defending?

435
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:36,020
<i>What do you think of his hair?</i>

436
01:11:09,069 --> 01:11:13,072
Your Majesty, he looks like a clown.

437
01:11:31,941 --> 01:11:33,427
Why don't you go on playing?

438
01:11:40,403 --> 01:11:43,491
When His Majesty,
the Tsar is talking,

439
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:46,007
even music has to be silent.

440
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:55,041
Go on, we are listening.

441
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,302
I want my carriage
and things packed.

442
01:12:47,402 --> 01:12:48,789
I'm going to Kiev.

443
01:15:28,889 --> 01:15:33,120
Mr. Liszt has offered
the proceeds of his concert

444
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,735
to aid the poor of Kiev.

445
01:15:34,835 --> 01:15:37,122
And no one leaves
without a donation!

446
01:15:57,707 --> 01:16:01,824
Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein
100 roubles...

447
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:06,855
The only one
who did not applaud.

448
01:16:15,661 --> 01:16:20,121
Allow me to introduce myself.

449
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:25,953
There is no need for that.
The whole world knows you.

450
01:16:26,053 --> 01:16:28,812
I'd like to thank you
for your lavish gift.

451
01:16:31,442 --> 01:16:35,216
We ought to thank you.

452
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:52,484
I've a letter for Mr. Liszt.

453
01:16:53,627 --> 01:16:55,686
Read it.

454
01:16:59,117 --> 01:17:02,776
I shall be pleased
to see you at Woronince.

455
01:17:03,462 --> 01:17:07,579
Carolyne Seyn-Wittgenstein.

456
01:18:28,658 --> 01:18:31,060
Welcome to Woronince.

457
01:18:34,262 --> 01:18:35,977
This is the gallery.

458
01:18:37,807 --> 01:18:42,839
My uncle.
He was banished to Siberia.

459
01:18:42,939 --> 01:18:47,277
Our family is Polish
and the Tsar doesn't like Poles.

460
01:18:48,231 --> 01:18:53,240
I was born here.
I'm an only child.

461
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:57,911
Father wanted a son to manage
the estate after his death.

462
01:18:58,011 --> 01:19:00,396
He brought me up
like a boy.

463
01:19:00,992 --> 01:19:04,331
We even drank wine together,
much wine...

464
01:19:04,431 --> 01:19:06,239
Do you like wine?

465
01:19:06,339 --> 01:19:08,147
Only champagne.

466
01:19:08,247 --> 01:19:10,771
Just one glass before the concert.

467
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:14,230
My parents divorced.

468
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:18,881
When I reached the age
of fifteen,

469
01:19:18,981 --> 01:19:22,101
they married me to
Prince Sayn-Wittgenstein.

470
01:19:24,128 --> 01:19:28,421
My openness might seem
strange to you,

471
01:19:29,256 --> 01:19:31,880
but I want you
to understand me.

472
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:35,100
To understand why I...

473
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,412
I do understand.

474
01:19:36,512 --> 01:19:39,751
I met your husband
in St. Petersburg.

475
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:44,998
He hasn't lived here for years.

476
01:19:45,098 --> 01:19:47,860
My estate
is the only link between us.

477
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,961
So, I live in complete
isolation,

478
01:19:51,061 --> 01:19:54,300
cut off from the world
by a sea of mud,

479
01:19:55,851 --> 01:20:00,263
or by endless snowfields.

480
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:03,722
Hardly anyone comes here.

481
01:20:05,272 --> 01:20:11,235
Our marriage was just as much
a burden to my husband as to me.

482
01:20:11,951 --> 01:20:15,886
He preferred visiting the music halls
in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

483
01:20:15,986 --> 01:20:19,702
So, I shut myself up.
Books, piano...

484
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,088
But I'm a very poor pianist...

485
01:20:23,042 --> 01:20:28,051
If I want to hear good music
I go to Kiev, or to the chapel.

486
01:20:28,766 --> 01:20:30,455
Are you religious?

487
01:20:30,555 --> 01:20:31,655
I believe in God.

488
01:20:31,755 --> 01:20:35,206
I even wanted to become
a priest.

489
01:20:35,306 --> 01:20:38,068
Religion is my only consolation.

490
01:20:43,554 --> 01:20:45,939
My daughter, Masha.

491
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:52,021
My only companion
in this large, empty manor.

492
01:20:58,819 --> 01:21:02,755
A manor? No, dear Liszt.

493
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:07,664
A prison. With bars everywhere.

494
01:21:07,764 --> 01:21:10,533
With bars I forged myself.

495
01:21:11,938 --> 01:21:18,855
If i have to be a captive, why not
forge the bars myself?

496
01:21:19,689 --> 01:21:24,937
The bars, Princess, can be torn down
and one can flee too, if...

497
01:21:26,368 --> 01:21:28,276
Have you done it?

498
01:21:28,376 --> 01:21:31,854
Yes, I had to.

499
01:22:29,217 --> 01:22:30,409
Don't!

500
01:22:30,509 --> 01:22:33,629
Let her!
This is a special day.

501
01:22:38,519 --> 01:22:41,620
You think I'm happy, don't you?

502
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:44,840
I have everything.

503
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,583
I freed myself
from an attachment,

504
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:52,592
I felt I could take to wings
like a bird.

505
01:22:53,188 --> 01:22:57,839
But a I stayed a captive.
A captive of success.

506
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:01,059
My life is bleak
and cheerless.

507
01:23:01,297 --> 01:23:04,517
I no longer find true joy
in my playing.

508
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:08,453
It wrings my heart
to hear about my success.

509
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,361
Success...

510
01:23:10,838 --> 01:23:14,416
The audience wants
showy spectacles.

511
01:23:14,516 --> 01:23:16,682
My art does not make them happier.

512
01:23:18,948 --> 01:23:22,287
But now I realize
that maybe I could give them more.

513
01:23:24,195 --> 01:23:26,699
Maybe there is a way out
for me.

514
01:24:15,715 --> 01:24:18,219
When I first hear you
in Vienna.

515
01:24:19,769 --> 01:24:24,063
I wanted to run away
from your music, from you.

516
01:24:26,925 --> 01:24:31,814
Then I saw you enter a hotel
in Dresden...

517
01:24:33,723 --> 01:24:40,878
Then one night, I was reading Dante,
the piano was open,

518
01:24:40,978 --> 01:24:43,979
and I fancied I heard
your music.

519
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,502
I banged the lid
on the keys.

520
01:24:46,602 --> 01:24:49,584
but the piano
went on resounding.

521
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:53,281
Like now,
while you're playing.

522
01:24:55,785 --> 01:25:00,556
In Kiev, I could not applaud you...

523
01:25:00,656 --> 01:25:04,253
I prayed for you.
For your music.

524
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:26,315
I love you Carolyne.

525
01:25:26,415 --> 01:25:29,297
I love you, too.

526
01:25:29,397 --> 01:25:36,214
Since that day in Vienna
when I first heard you play,

527
01:25:36,572 --> 01:25:39,434
since I first spoke to you...

528
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:47,424
I should have fought
against it, against myself.

529
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,286
Do not fight, Carolyne.

530
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:55,176
I love you, I love you.

531
01:26:34,531 --> 01:26:36,797
I wrote this for you.

532
01:26:36,897 --> 01:26:40,256
Really.
Is it mine? Only mine?

533
01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:04,346
Do you like it?

534
01:27:07,685 --> 01:27:09,474
Is the tune familiar?

535
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:13,052
My peasants sing it.

536
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:16,749
I learnt it from them.
How many are there?

537
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:19,014
Lots.

538
01:27:20,684 --> 01:27:22,592
It's yours.

539
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:26,051
When I leave,
it'll stay here.

540
01:27:32,014 --> 01:27:34,280
You're not going to leave me,
are you?

541
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,619
I came for three days,
and stayed three months.

542
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:40,481
I came in winter,
and now spring is here.

543
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:43,105
You must not leave me.

544
01:27:43,205 --> 01:27:44,205
And your husband?

545
01:27:44,305 --> 01:27:45,728
Are you afraid of him?

546
01:27:45,828 --> 01:27:48,113
No, but you often talk
about the family, the child...

547
01:27:48,213 --> 01:27:50,618
Yes, I do...

548
01:27:50,718 --> 01:27:53,242
But I make my own decisions.

549
01:27:54,911 --> 01:27:57,177
You just have to answer

550
01:27:58,966 --> 01:28:01,232
do you love me?

551
01:28:03,617 --> 01:28:05,525
Yes, I love you.

552
01:28:06,241 --> 01:28:08,387
And will you accept me, too?

553
01:28:09,938 --> 01:28:12,800
Because I'm not
Marie D'Agoult.

554
01:28:13,277 --> 01:28:16,139
I shall go with you
where you go.

555
01:28:16,378 --> 01:28:19,121
And I have decided
to go with you.

556
01:28:19,955 --> 01:28:21,625
If you accept me.

557
01:28:25,413 --> 01:28:28,776
Welcome!
What have you brought?

558
01:28:28,876 --> 01:28:31,419
- This new contract.
- Put it away!

559
01:28:31,519 --> 01:28:34,061
- And your mail.
- Leave me alone.

560
01:28:34,161 --> 01:28:36,824
Don't worry, I've sorted it out.

561
01:28:36,924 --> 01:28:37,924
All right then.

562
01:28:38,024 --> 01:28:41,509
That's all that's left.

563
01:28:41,609 --> 01:28:46,794
Belloni is a useful fellow,
isn't he?

564
01:28:48,836 --> 01:28:52,920
Weimar, Saxony... The court marshal
of the Grand Duke Karl Friedrich...

565
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:54,020
Read it.

566
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:59,766
If Mr. Liszt would accept a post
as guest conductor at this court,

567
01:28:59,866 --> 01:29:03,250
the permanent conductor of which
is Mr. Chelard,

568
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:05,912
Mr. Liszt would be obliged to spend
four months a year in our midst,

569
01:29:06,012 --> 01:29:08,415
with no other obligations.

570
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:12,018
This means, I've found a haven!
And in Weimar!

571
01:29:12,118 --> 01:29:13,459
In Weimar of all places!

572
01:29:13,559 --> 01:29:15,161
Maria Pavlovna,
the Tsar's sister lives there.

573
01:29:15,261 --> 01:29:16,582
Have you met her?

574
01:29:16,682 --> 01:29:19,125
Yes, and she was
exceedingly kind to me.

575
01:29:19,225 --> 01:29:21,267
Is that so?
That's marvellous!

576
01:29:21,367 --> 01:29:23,189
I'm sure I won her confidence.

577
01:29:23,289 --> 01:29:27,873
Would she assist you
in a private matter?

578
01:29:27,973 --> 01:29:29,315
In ours?

579
01:29:29,675 --> 01:29:31,357
She is the Tsar's sister.

580
01:29:32,438 --> 01:29:36,282
And the Tsar must consent
to my divorce.

581
01:29:37,723 --> 01:29:41,927
Accept the post in Weimar!

582
01:29:43,489 --> 01:29:45,170
How lucky, it's Weimar.

583
01:29:45,531 --> 01:29:48,533
Not luck... happiness!

584
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,215
Of course, I'll accept it.

585
01:29:50,335 --> 01:29:52,737
Marvellous!

586
01:29:54,659 --> 01:29:58,143
I'll go with you.
Let me come.

587
01:29:58,503 --> 01:30:00,905
Don't worry,
I won't run away.

588
01:30:01,866 --> 01:30:05,950
You are the only woman
who could leave me.

589
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:07,872
And if you do not join me
in Weimar,

590
01:30:07,972 --> 01:30:09,914
I'll come to fetch you.

591
01:30:10,635 --> 01:30:14,719
You're the only woman
who could leave me.

592
01:30:14,819 --> 01:30:17,602
Never, never!

593
01:33:02,401 --> 01:33:06,605
What? A hundred roubles
to a beggar?

594
01:33:06,705 --> 01:33:10,809
To a colleague.
They should be helped.

595
01:33:10,909 --> 01:33:13,812
A colleague!
There is a slight difference.

596
01:33:13,912 --> 01:33:15,854
A very slight one.

597
01:33:15,954 --> 01:33:19,217
In that today it is me
who gives him money.

598
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:23,902
By the way,
I'm giving up playing.

599
01:33:24,262 --> 01:33:27,866
Tonight's concert was my last.

600
01:33:30,869 --> 01:33:33,511
I'll live in Weimar,
and compose music.

601
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:37,835
To scrawl notes
instead of playing?

602
01:33:38,556 --> 01:33:41,078
Beethoven wrote
the Hammerklavier Sonata

603
01:33:41,178 --> 01:33:43,961
but Liszt had to be born
so that someone could play it.

604
01:33:44,061 --> 01:33:46,484
Perhaps Liszt, too,
will compose music.

605
01:33:46,584 --> 01:33:49,126
for the artists of the future
to cope with.

606
01:33:49,487 --> 01:33:52,730
I'll leave you for three months,
and you upset our lives!

607
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:54,892
On the contrary.

608
01:33:54,992 --> 01:33:57,534
Carolyne is a wonderful woman,

609
01:33:57,634 --> 01:34:01,138
who can strengthen me
for a difficult task.

610
01:34:01,238 --> 01:34:02,940
I can't believe it.

611
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,222
Liszt without the stage!

612
01:34:05,322 --> 01:34:06,663
The stage without Liszt!

613
01:34:06,763 --> 01:34:09,186
The stage will see
Liszt, the composer!

614
01:34:09,286 --> 01:34:12,329
All music has been composed!

615
01:34:12,429 --> 01:34:16,533
Ours is a great age, the century
of industry, of democracy.

616
01:34:16,633 --> 01:34:19,756
It wants more than
the reproduction of fugues.

617
01:34:19,856 --> 01:34:22,278
Should no one
give voice to this century?

618
01:34:22,378 --> 01:34:25,281
Oh, yes.
But not Franz Liszt.

619
01:34:25,381 --> 01:34:27,684
Why not Liszt, the composer?

620
01:34:27,784 --> 01:34:30,446
Because he has no need
for a secretary.

621
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:37,533
But he has a need for a friend.

622
01:34:37,633 --> 01:34:39,935
Won't you accept the role?

623
01:34:42,097 --> 01:34:47,262
I was better as a secretary
than as a friend, I am afraid.

624
01:35:08,643 --> 01:35:11,646
<i>"Yes, dear Carolyine,
the viruoso has died.</i>

625
01:35:11,746 --> 01:35:14,289
<i>on the pinnacle of his glory.</i>

626
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:19,694
<i>And he chose to die quickly.</i>

627
01:35:19,794 --> 01:35:22,577
<i>rather than to live
in the echo of past success.</i>

628
01:35:24,018 --> 01:35:26,420
<i>For me life means music.</i>

629
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:32,306
<i>And it will be like this
as long as I live.</i>

630
01:35:32,406 --> 01:35:38,672
<i>I am happy in Weimar because
the grace of the Grand Duke</i>

631
01:35:38,772 --> 01:35:42,876
<i>enables me to serve
the music of the future.</i>

632
01:35:42,976 --> 01:35:45,399
<i>This is not easy, Carolyne.</i>

633
01:35:45,499 --> 01:35:50,203
<i>If you were here,
I'd be happier.</i>

634
01:35:50,303 --> 01:35:55,969
<i>I'm devoting myself
to the new music.</i>

635
01:35:56,069 --> 01:35:59,693
<i>Making way for a great man,
Richard Wagner,</i>

636
01:35:59,793 --> 01:36:01,975
<i>heedless of failures
and criticism.</i>

637
01:36:02,075 --> 01:36:04,137
<i>This music must win.</i>

638
01:36:05,338 --> 01:36:09,302
<i>We must wait, dear,
if impatiently.</i>

639
01:36:09,402 --> 01:36:12,665
<i>After the premiere
I'll talk to the Duchess.</i>

640
01:36:12,765 --> 01:36:15,188
<i>Her kindness and wisdom
will help us.</i>

641
01:36:15,288 --> 01:36:19,632
<i>And then come. Let us not
care about the world.</i>

642
01:36:19,992 --> 01:36:22,274
<i>only about ourselves. "</i>

643
01:36:35,607 --> 01:36:36,607
<i>"Dear Franz,</i>

644
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:38,370
<i>I can't wait.</i>

645
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:41,493
<i>I'll divorce my husband
upon the grounds,</i>

646
01:36:41,593 --> 01:36:43,655
<i>that I was forced
into marrying him.</i>

647
01:36:43,755 --> 01:36:48,340
<i>I will sell my estate
and live with you.</i>

648
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,544
<i>sharing your fate
till eternity. "</i>

649
01:36:58,429 --> 01:37:00,231
Sixty thousand!

650
01:37:03,955 --> 01:37:05,276
This is only half of it.

651
01:37:05,636 --> 01:37:12,003
Don't worry, Galitzin,
send to my wife for the rest.

652
01:37:12,103 --> 01:37:15,486
Well, thirty thousand...

653
01:37:15,586 --> 01:37:17,648
One rouble
for each of your serfs.

654
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:20,411
Within 24 hours,
is that right?

655
01:37:23,173 --> 01:37:25,095
On with it!

656
01:37:53,923 --> 01:37:56,566
Give this letter to the Prince.

657
01:37:56,926 --> 01:37:58,487
Good bye.

658
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:34,042
Europe is ablaze, Sire.

659
01:38:34,142 --> 01:38:37,165
And revolutions do not stop
at frontiers.

660
01:38:38,366 --> 01:38:40,528
You are right,
Nesselrode.

661
01:38:41,369 --> 01:38:44,852
We must close
our European frontiers.

662
01:38:44,952 --> 01:38:48,336
We'll mobilize
part of our forces

663
01:38:49,897 --> 01:38:53,020
and strengthen
the frontier garrisons.

664
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:56,263
So we need to take precautions.

665
01:38:56,864 --> 01:38:59,026
Don't delay, Nesselrode.

666
01:38:59,987 --> 01:39:02,870
See that no one
crosses the frontier.

667
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:07,915
Neither in or out.
Not a soul.

668
01:39:09,236 --> 01:39:12,119
Yes, your Majesty.

669
01:39:30,578 --> 01:39:31,578
My wife?

670
01:39:33,139 --> 01:39:35,181
Where's she gone?

671
01:40:11,937 --> 01:40:13,858
Is anything wrong?

672
01:40:17,342 --> 01:40:20,825
My wife! My daughter!

673
01:40:20,925 --> 01:40:21,925
What happened to them?

674
01:40:23,107 --> 01:40:26,831
They're gone.

675
01:40:29,714 --> 01:40:31,876
She's on her way
to Weimar.

676
01:40:34,398 --> 01:40:36,560
To that clown.

677
01:40:38,843 --> 01:40:43,767
She'll sell the estate
and then

678
01:40:45,329 --> 01:40:48,692
there's nothing else for me
but to shoot myself.

679
01:40:49,773 --> 01:40:53,377
The frontier is sealed.

680
01:40:54,698 --> 01:40:56,400
We may overtake her.

681
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:59,262
Let's go.

682
01:41:03,346 --> 01:41:07,070
You've been secretive lately.

683
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:09,833
I'm feeling quite superfluous.

684
01:41:09,933 --> 01:41:11,394
You wouldn't understand.

685
01:41:11,494 --> 01:41:19,082
But I would. I just can't see
the point of this rush for a lady.

686
01:41:19,182 --> 01:41:20,883
You do not understand.

687
01:41:21,724 --> 01:41:24,487
She's the first woman
I've run after.

688
01:41:40,904 --> 01:41:42,744
Faster!

689
01:41:42,844 --> 01:41:45,267
Oh, to be there!

690
01:41:45,627 --> 01:41:48,030
We can't be far.

691
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:49,471
What if the border's closed?

692
01:42:30,671 --> 01:42:32,593
All right.

693
01:43:12,351 --> 01:43:15,354
His Majesty ordered
the frontier to be sealed.

694
01:43:15,454 --> 01:43:17,276
Not a soul can cross over.

695
01:43:30,969 --> 01:43:32,531
The Princess?

696
01:43:32,631 --> 01:43:35,894
Her highness
has crossed on foot.

697
01:43:38,056 --> 01:43:40,699
The border is closed,
Your Excellency.

698
01:43:40,799 --> 01:43:42,500
We can't make exceptions.

699
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,503
Can't you?
We shall see.

700
01:43:58,596 --> 01:44:02,800
END OF PART 1.
