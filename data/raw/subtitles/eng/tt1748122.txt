In order to show you how

00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,207
a big symphony
orchestra is put together,

5
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,374
Benjamin Britten
has written a big piece of music,

6
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,207
which is made up
of smaller pieces

7
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,290
that show you all
the separate parts of the orchestra.

8
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,165
These smaller pieces
are called variations,

9
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,749
which means different ways
of playing the same tune.

10
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,082
First of all,
he lets us hear the tune or the theme,

11
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,290
which is a beautiful melody

12
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,749
by the much older
British composer Henry Purcell.

13
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:55,290
Here is Purcell's theme
played by the whole orchestra together.

playing the same Purcell theme
in different ways.

18
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,415
First, we hear
the woodwind family.

It is possible, Counselor.

202
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,290
I disagree, Counselor.
It would take him three days, at least.

203

Hello, this is
Captain Sharp.

695
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:13,040
Hello, Captain Sharp.
This is Social Services.

696
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:15,707
I'm calling in
reference to Sam Shakusky, ward of the state.

697
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:16,957
I understand he's
in your custody.

698
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,165
That's correct.

699
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,082
What's his condition?
Has he suffered

700
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,415
any injury or
trauma of any kind?

701
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,249
-He's fine.
-Very good.

702
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:25,665
How do I get to you?

703
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,290
The fastest way
would be sea plane.

704
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:28,957
Jed can bring you
in with the mail.

705
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:30,957
I'll come tomorrow morning,
if that's acceptable to you.

706
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:32,832
Is someone able to
provide reasonable care

707
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:34,540
and nourishment for
the boy until that time?

708
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:36,249
Uh-huh.

709
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:37,790
Is that a yes?

710
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:39,249
Uh-huh.

711
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,832
Very good, I'll contact you
again before the end of the day.

712
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:44,999
Wait a second.

713
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,290
Yes?

714
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,540

Captain Sharp?

716
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:51,790
What's going to
happen to him?

717
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,582
Well, normally,
we try to place him in another foster home,

718
00:50:57,666 --> 00:50:59,790
but that option's no
longer available to us,

719
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:02,082
in my opinion,
due to his case history.

720
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,415
Which means he'll go
to Juvenile Refuge.

721
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:07,332
Wait. What does that mean?
Is that an orphanage?

722
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,040
Who's speaking?

723
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:11,207
This is Scout Master
Randy Ward.

724
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,249
Right, an orphanage.

725
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:22,165
But the first step is
the admissions panel

726
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,915
requires
a psychological evaluation

727
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,415
to determine
whether or not the boy

728
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,457
is a candidate for
institutional treatment

729
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:31,082
or electroshock therapy.

730
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,165
Excuse me.
Shock therapy?

731
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,415
Why would that
be called for? He's not violent.

732
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:38,415
The report describes
an assault with scissors.

733
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,665
That was the girl.

734
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,915
That was the girl
that did that.

735
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:46,499
Well, maybe she needs help,
too, but that's not our job. Okay?

736
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:51,332
Okay.

737
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:29,374

I do know what
you're feeling, Suzy-bean.

740
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:45,499

myself where I say, "What am I doing here?

to do something so stupid?

still happening?"

more emotional...

746
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:00,957
Don't say "hate."

747
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:02,499
Why not? I mean it.

748
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:06,540

in this moment. You're trying to hurt me.

He's not dumb.

752
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:24,165
But I guess
he is kind of sad.

753
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:27,540
Anyway,
we shouldn't discuss that.

754
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,540

for me to even acknowledge

worried, and we still ran away, anyway.

which we didn't do on purpose.

765

When we first met each other,
something happened to us.

That's very eloquent.
