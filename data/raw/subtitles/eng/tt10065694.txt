So, sending over
a vodka-cran, yeah,

for our situation
tonight, so...

Well, what you should
have done is

925
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:04,381
you should have
asked our waiter,

926
01:06:04,414 --> 01:06:07,150
which, again,
champagne we're drinking,

927
01:06:07,184 --> 01:06:10,587
and sent over a second bottle
of it for all of us.

with me from across the room.
