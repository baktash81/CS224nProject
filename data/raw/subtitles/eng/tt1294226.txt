1
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,534
Interior to command.

2
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:42,905
We've finished our sweep and we've got
one victim outside being treated by EMS.

3
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,768
Do you got anyone else
in there?

4
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:27,544
What a shame, huh? It was one
of the oldest buildings in Georgia.

5
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,452
Ronnie, promise me
you'll make an effort, OK?

6
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,159
- Does Dad know she was arrested?
- Jonah!

7
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:42,633
I didn't do it, OK?
Stay out of it.

8
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,828
Just in time.

9
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,412
Wow!

10
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,585
- Dad!
- Hi, Joe-boy. How are you, man?

11
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,681
I'm great. How are you?

12
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,716
Here we go!

13
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,724
- I missed you. Look how big you are.
- Me too.

14
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,392
You're like six-three now.

15
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,836
- You live on the beach?
- You bet.

16
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,202
That is awesome!

17
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,174
- Don't go in the water.
- Be carefuI if you go in the water.

18
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,474
- How are you?
- I'm good.

19
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,119
That's right, we have two children.

20
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,714
Hi, Ronnie. How are you, sweetheart?

21
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,254
Wow.

22
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,027
You have no idea.

23
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:38,448
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Strawberry shake.

24
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,122
Here you go.

25
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,490
That's you, Will!

26
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,135
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,644
- You OK?
- I would rather drink my milkshake...

28
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,650
- than wear it, but I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

29
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,013
You look it.

30
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,816
Forget it.

31
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,188
Hey, look. I really am sorry.

32
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,161
- Didn't we just do this?
- I'm Will, by the way.

33
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,495
- Let me buy you another shirt.
- No, thanks. I'm good.

34
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,557
Come on. I'm practicing
Southern hospitality.

35
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:31,102
Is that what they call
hitting on strangers now?

36
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,435
You know what? I have no interest
in buying you a shirt.

37
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,532
- Is that so?
- I'm just over here...

38
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,476
so the other team can catch a breath.

39
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,510
- Pushy and conceited.
- Why don't you come watch.

40
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,046
I'll pass.

41
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,715
Thank you.

42
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,026
I'm glad you were able to fix it.

43
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:04,230
Yeah. Ronnie did a pretty good job
with that.

44
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,037
Now I know what a piano looks like when
somebody takes a baseball bat to it.

45
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:14,613
- You rehearsed that so many times.
- Is she still not playing?

46
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,807
Not since the day you left.

47
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:20,011
Brian even bought her an electric piano.
She won't go near it.

48
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:23,078
- An electric piano from Brian?
- Steve.

49
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,887
- How is she otherwise?
- Well, let's see.

50
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,656
Grades were in the toilet.

51
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,095
It's a miracle she graduated
from high schooI.

52
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:36,227
And she doesn't have one friend
without a pierced something.

53
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,329
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

54
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,771
She told you she got
into Juilliard, right?

55
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,708
No. Without playing?

56
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,941
They said they've been
watching her since she was five.

57
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,482
Not that it matters.
She says she's not going.

58
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,350
Well, she'll make the right decision.

59
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,549
I'm glad you're so sure.

60
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:04,158
- Kim...
- We hurt them, Steve.

61
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,562
Especially Ronnie.

62
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,558
- We can try and pretend...
- I'm not gonna do this. OK?

63
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,300
Things happen. Nobody's perfect.

64
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,740
And Ronnie...

65
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,471
Ronnie will be fine.

66
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,142
A unicorn. How mythicaI.

67
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:30,484
I'd stick with the stained one
if I were you. Those suck.

68
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,353
Pretty much.

69
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,791
OK. Come with me.
There are some cooler places.

70
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,156
Let's go!

71
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,923
Call, write, text, but communicate.

72
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,298
- OK!
- OK? I love you.

73
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,496
Got lipstick.
Tell your sister I love her.

74
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,869
- All right.
- Bye!

75
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,643
Bye!

76
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,770
- Ready?
- Come on!

77
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,311
Bye, Mom!

78
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,641
Thanks.

79
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,548
What is all this stuff?

80
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:07,423
Well, I am building a stained-glass
window for the church up the road.

81
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,723
I saw it. How did it happen?

82
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,228
Nobody's certain.

83
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,323
They think it was some sort of accident.

84
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,529
- This is so cooI.
- Yeah?

85
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,405
Unfortunately,
I'm not really looking...

86
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,704
for an assistant right now, so...

87
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,438
Why not? No, Dad, I'd do it!

88
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,672
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

89
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,204
- You want it?
- I'd do it for free!

90
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,217
- OK. You're hired.
- Really?

91
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,310
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

92
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,718
What kind of name is Blaze?

93
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,915
A nickname my boyfriend,
Marcus, gave me.

94
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,050
My reaI name's GaladrieI.
It's from Lord of the Rings.

95
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,462
My mom's weird like that.

96
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,055
Hey, I'm lucky it wasn't Frodo.

97
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,528
How much?

98
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,502
- Twenty.
- Too much.

99
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,334
Oh, wait.

100
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,636
I'm sorry. Today, it's free.

101
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,370
- No, no. Stop.
- It's OK. I do it all the time.

102
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,437
No. I can't. I already got busted once.

103
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,778
A woman with a record.

104
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,977
- Please.
- I like that.

105
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,918
Stop it.

106
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,882
- Dad's looking for you.
- Tell him you didn't see me, brat.

107
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:18,124
- Five bucks. And two for "brat".
- No way.

108
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,226
He's getting closer.
Don't make me raise it to ten.

109
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,429
Shut up.

110
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,463
I promise to make him take me on the
Twister three times so you can get away.

111
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,642
- Nice doing business with you.
- Yeah, yeah.

112
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,071
CooI. So you live in New York?

113
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,983
Yeah, I do now. I'm from Atlanta.

114
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,215
I moved up north when I was 11.

115
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,015
My dad moved here just a few years ago.

116
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,824
- Without you all?
- Irreconcilable differences.

117
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,456
Think that's the phrase.

118
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,166
- He bailed.
- Families suck.

119
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,069
I don't even live with mine.
I stay at Marcus' usually.

120
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,075
You have to meet Marcus. Let's go.

121
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:18,122
- Hook me up!
- Yeah!

122
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,594
That's him.

123
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,470
Thank you, everyone.
Donations are accepted.

124
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,707
In fact, they're encouraged.

125
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,580
This is good, huh?

126
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:49,847
Good to have a little man time.

127
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,484
Ronnie never opens any of your letters.

128
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,928
Really?

129
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,524
Mom says it's because she has PMS.

130
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,195
Do you know what that is?

131
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,398
Dad, I'm not a little kid anymore.

132
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,067
Means "pissed at men syndrome".

133
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,001
Yeah.

134
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,511
So, Will, you want to get out of here?

135
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,780
My parents are at some lame-o
award thing with the governor.

136
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,082
They won't be home for hours.

137
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,851
- They must trust you.
- Imagine that.

138
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,755
My man! She tell you the good news?

139
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,163
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

140
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,364
Cassie wants us to pick up some beer
on the way home, so we gotta do that.

141
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,032
You know what, man?
I'm gonna skip it.

142
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,975
No, no. Hello, hello.
Eyes right here, buddy. No.

143
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,740
No skipping it tonight.
Look. Listen to me. OK.

144
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,610
Will yes. Ashley yes.

145
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,513
Ashley yes. Cassie yes.

146
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,075
Cassie yes. Scott yes!

147
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:57,987
- Come on. Take one for team Scott.
- Where you been, buddy?

148
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,958
- You guys don't hang out with us.
- Get off him!

149
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,058
Get off him. I love you, Will.
You're so butch.

150
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,793
Always looking out for your friend.

151
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,742
Come on. Dude, come on.

152
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,924
Hey, Ronnie?

153
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,363
Get me a drink?

154
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:43,162
Is there something wrong
with your legs?

155
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,765
I'll get it for you.

156
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,183
I'm sorry. Are we boring you?

157
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,485
I just don't drink.

158
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,635
It's like a...
"just say no thing"?

159
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,619
Because you could just say yes.

160
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,349
Stop it.

161
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,333
Don't ever touch me, ever again.

162
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,200
Sorry.

163
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,675
Jeez.

164
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,191
I'm going to bed.

165
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,119
Before I get completely grossed out,
you should know I'm in here.

166
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,627
- Get out of my room!
- This is our room.

167
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,186
OK? If you want to sleep in Dad's room,
that's fine.

168
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,737
- Hey, Ron?
- What?

169
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,104
Don't get mad, OK?

170
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:40,302
Can you just be a little nicer to Dad?

171
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,146
I just really don't
want to lose him again.

172
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,687
Did you see his face
when he saw you here?

173
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,229
He was so excited.

174
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,198
Jonah, you never lost Dad, OK?

175
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:04,895
You never lost him,
and you never will. I promise.

176
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,926
- Ronnie, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

177
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,895
- Where were you?
- Out.

178
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,835
Well, it's almost 1:00, so...

179
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,842
You don't have to wait up for me.
I'm not 12.

180
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,242
I wasn't worried about you
when you were 12.

181
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,006
And now you are?

182
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,618
If you're gonna be here,
you have to...

183
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,846
I don't want to be here, Dad.

184
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,423
That's just it.

185
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,392
I don't want to be here.

186
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,362
Is that not obvious?
Do you not get that?

187
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,662
Yeah. Let's make the best of it, OK?

188
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,427
Are you gonna play?

189
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,906
Are you going to play? Because
if you are, I'm sleeping outside.

190
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,953
- Hey, congratulations on Juilliard.
- Why? I'm not going.

191
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,051
- That would be a mistake.
- Well,

192
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,289
you and Mom would know about those.

193
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:40,729
- I've learned from the best.
- That's enough!

194
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,131
Damn it, that's enough!

195
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:47,267
- It's OK, Jonah.
- I'm sorry, Jonah. Go back to sleep.

196
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,969
I'll be there in a minute.

197
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:56,637
If you're pissed at me and...
you wanna hurt me, fine, hurt me.

198
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,344
Be mad, be angry,
but don't stop playing.

199
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,148
It's stupid, Ronnie.

200
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,981
It really is, and you're too talented.

201
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:08,450
Are we done?

202
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,339
Let's go, Ronnie!

203
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,344
- Thanks.
- How about that?

204
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:29,504
Ronnie, hey.

205
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,605
It's a new day.

206
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,917
Look, let's start over.
I got bacon here, got breakfast.

207
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,686
Vegetarian, Dad.

208
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,355
- Since when?
- A year and a half.

209
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:14,684
Must have found a turtle's nest.

210
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:19,228
I'm not going near it. Must be sick
or something if it's out in the daytime.

211
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:22,327
Sure is enjoying those eggs.

212
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,596
What? No, no, no, no!

213
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,159
No!

214
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:31,972
Oh, my God.

215
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:56,932
She's losing it, Dad.

216
00:18:57,702 --> 00:18:58,896
Big time.

217
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,646
A sea turtle laid eggs.

218
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:15,311
The raccoons will eat them
if I don't keep them away.

219
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:17,311
Really?

220
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:21,051
When a female lays her eggs,
the raccoons smell them and...

221
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:22,992
They'll eat every one if they can.

222
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:27,889
This Web site told me
to call the aquarium...

223
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:31,129
and see if I could get someone
to come here and protect them,

224
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:34,103
- but my battery's dead.
- There's a number to the aquarium...

225
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:39,074
on the wall by the phone. Honestly,
I don't know how they'll improve on...

226
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,975
On that.

227
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:46,147
Hey! Veronica!

228
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,811
No, Ronnie, it's fantastic. I like it.

229
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:50,979
You're overreacting!

230
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:58,889
- Hey, Dad, can we fly a kite today?
- Absolutely not.

231
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:01,921
We're flying three kites today.
All of us.

232
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,831
You're dreaming, Dad.

233
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:08,704
Yeah. I'd like to report some
sea turtle eggs outside of my house.

234
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,569
Sure.

235
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:17,781
- What?
- You said "outside my house".

236
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:18,975
I like that.

237
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:22,679
Did you go to, like,
a nice guy schooI or something?

238
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:25,517
What's with all your smiling lately?

239
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:27,454
Seriously, it's creepy.

240
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,997
Is my...? Is my smile creepy?

241
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:40,765
Well, I don't know. Let's see it.

242
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm doing it.

243
00:20:46,343 --> 00:20:50,006
Kind of, but I think
you need to show teeth.

244
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:10,633
My grandmother used
to drive one of those.

245
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:13,432
- She did?
- Yeah.

246
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:14,994
Barely.

247
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:20,107
Is that milkshake girI?
You should go spill that soda on her.

248
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,270
Hey.

249
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:29,274
Hi. Nice look.

250
00:21:29,353 --> 00:21:31,446
I almost didn't recognize you
with your shirt on.

251
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:36,887
I'm sorry. I was stupid.

252
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:39,122
- Yeah.
- It must have been the game.

253
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:42,427
I get a little... jacked up.

254
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:48,098
You know, I laid awake that night,
just remembering it.

255
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:49,730
Felt like a jerk for hours.

256
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:54,673
I seriously doubt that happened.

257
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:57,038
You're wrong.

258
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:01,943
I'll see you around.

259
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:05,116
I hope so.

260
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:14,494
What should I call you
when that happens?

261
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:16,658
- Ronnie.
- Ronnie.

262
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:18,933
Bye, Ronnie.

263
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:22,630
Bye.

264
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,877
You know who her father is, right?

265
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:38,454
Yeah. So?

266
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:41,449
Just checking.

267
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:45,923
Hey, what's up? Did the aquarium call?

268
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:48,864
- I don't know.
- Oh, crap.

269
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:51,265
Hey! Hey!

270
00:22:52,136 --> 00:22:54,001
Hey!

271
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:42,213
Hey.

272
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:49,285
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

273
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:52,818
- I asked you first.
- I'm here to mark a turtle nest.

274
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:58,061
You work for the aquarium?
I thought you were a mechanic.

275
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:01,229
- I don't work there. I volunteer there.
- I called yesterday.

276
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:05,632
- Is everything OK?
- No, everything's not OK.

277
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:09,305
- There were raccoons here all night.
- Really?

278
00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:12,574
- Where are they now?
- I scared them away.

279
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,710
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
I'm a little scared.

280
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:19,149
That's really funny.

281
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:21,783
You know, I'd like to see
you sleep out here all night...

282
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:26,023
while it's freezing with a baseball bat
in your hand and raccoons terrorize you.

283
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:30,559
- You really slept out here all night?
- No.

284
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:33,593
My hair looks like this all by itself.

285
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:36,003
I wasn't gonna mention
the hair, but...

286
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:43,306
This all your creation?

287
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,043
- Do you have a problem with it?
- Not really.

288
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:49,746
Other than the fact
that when the eggs hatch,

289
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,022
turtles won't be able
to get back to the sea, so...

290
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:53,823
they'll starve and die.

291
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:22,410
Hey.

292
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:26,485
Blaze.

293
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:29,825
Blaze, what's wrong?

294
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:33,755
I saw how you looked at him.
At Marcus? I saw you.

295
00:25:33,797 --> 00:25:36,664
- What are you talking about?
- I love him, OK?

296
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:39,703
- So stay away.
- I am not interested...

297
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,000
You're Iying!
I watched you flirt with him.

298
00:25:42,072 --> 00:25:44,472
The guy's a creep.
He was the one coming on to me.

299
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:47,306
Why would you wanna be
with someone like that anyways?

300
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:49,641
Excuse me.

301
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,444
- What?
- I'm sorry. I have to check your purse.

302
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:54,041
Fine.

303
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,519
I did not take that.

304
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:02,957
I didn't take...

305
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:09,122
You're gonna have to come with me.

306
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:18,906
- Mom's gonna flip out.
- Shut up. OK, Jonah?

307
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:21,638
Ronnie, don't talk
to your brother like that.

308
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,690
- Where you going?
- Home. Where do you think I'm going?

309
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:41,663
I'm calling Mom.

310
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:44,667
Let her go! Just let her go!

311
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:49,571
We had a really nice day,
and you had to ruin it!

312
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,701
Let her go! Let her.
Make her leave us alone!

313
00:26:57,648 --> 00:27:00,515
How do you want me to respond, Ronnie?

314
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:04,009
- You want me to tell you it's OK...?
- I want you to believe me.

315
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:07,719
But obviously, you can't do that.

316
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:19,529
I did it in New York.

317
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:24,370
I stole something.

318
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:28,878
And I don't need you to tell me
that it's wrong, because I know that.

319
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:33,881
But I didn't do it here.

320
00:27:37,254 --> 00:27:39,586
The store owner is a friend of mine.

321
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:42,682
I'll talk to him.

322
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,522
OK?

323
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:15,955
Evening.

324
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,566
Anna Karenina.

325
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:33,007
"Happy families are all alike.

326
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:36,375
Every unhappy family
is unhappy in its own way".

327
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,785
Is quoting Tolstoy
supposed to impress me?

328
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:46,277
I wasn't quoting Tolstoy.
I was quoting his translator.

329
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:48,917
But since you asked...

330
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:09,236
Are you moving in?

331
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:10,711
Hey, If I wanna get some sleep,

332
00:29:10,712 --> 00:29:14,012
I may need something
to scare off the raccoons.

333
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:16,382
They don't like bright lights
or music.

334
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:20,449
You're planning to sleep here?

335
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:24,757
Well, the truth is the town
sort of got together...

336
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:27,991
and decided we couldn't take
another one of your bad hair days.

337
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:30,522
Oh, really.

338
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,535
So the word is
you're from New York.

339
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:36,900
It's a small town, people talk.

340
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:42,342
I got accepted to Columbia in the fall.
Who knows? We might be neighbors.

341
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:47,513
So, what are you doing down here?

342
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:51,578
My mom shipped me and my brother
to my dad's for the summer.

343
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:53,079
Guess so I could baby-sit
turtle eggs...

344
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:57,421
while a volleyball player slash aquarium
volunteer hits on me every five seconds.

345
00:29:57,494 --> 00:29:59,257
Now, who's conceited?

346
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,858
Since we're on the subject,

347
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,925
I'm not hitting on you.

348
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:07,937
Seriously, I'm engaged to be married.

349
00:30:14,344 --> 00:30:16,642
What's the matter with you?!

350
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:18,408
I'm sorry.

351
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,277
This doesn't look good.

352
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:27,816
You're not OK with this, are you?

353
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:34,355
Then we'd better
maintain visuaI contact.

354
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,113
Good evening.

355
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:28,147
Hello, sir.

356
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:30,286
Hey.

357
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,859
You mind?

358
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:38,326
No.

359
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,614
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.

360
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:34,979
- Hello.
- Don't "hello" me.

361
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:37,543
I need your name, soldier.

362
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:41,747
I'm Will.

363
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:44,453
- You are?
- I'm her roommate.

364
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:47,827
The commanding officer
sent me out with rations.

365
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:50,526
But unfortunately, it's vegetarian.

366
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:53,536
So, personally, I'd rather eat sand.

367
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:57,301
Thanks for the tip, bro.

368
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,980
Hey.

369
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:07,983
I'd better get going.
I'm supposed to be at the aquarium.

370
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:09,609
Me too.

371
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:14,514
Not hard-to-get again.

372
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:19,390
Seriously, Ronnie.
You read Tolstoy.

373
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:23,559
You take up arms
to defend innocent sea turtles.

374
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,500
The ice-cube act's not working.

375
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,575
Let's try it again.

376
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:38,309
Last night was fun.

377
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:43,483
- Best first date of my life.
- It was not a date.

378
00:33:43,553 --> 00:33:47,580
We could make it one, if you
don't mind coming to work with me.

379
00:34:33,937 --> 00:34:36,235
- It's kind of cooI, huh?
- It's incredible.

380
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:38,501
- So big.
- Try cleaning it.

381
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:41,408
It must be pretty cooI,
swimming with all the fish.

382
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:44,675
- You should see it from in here.
- Maybe I will someday.

383
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:47,148
Yeah.

384
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:48,275
Give me a hand up?

385
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:54,585
I'm gonna kill you!

386
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,070
Dude!

387
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:12,737
- Where you been?
- I'm sorry, man. She's such a klutz.

388
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:15,369
- She fell in the tank five times.
- That is not true!

389
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:16,776
- Ronnie, Scott.
- Hi.

390
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:19,041
We got the tournament coming up.
Let's go.

391
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:23,074
- Want to grab me a water?
- Fine. I'll be back in a minute.

392
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:27,118
Wet hair?

393
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,215
Let me guess. He took you
to the aquarium...

394
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:32,558
and did his whole
underwater fish-man show for you.

395
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:34,426
Were you impressed?

396
00:35:34,497 --> 00:35:37,591
- Do I know you?
- I'm a friend of Will's.

397
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:40,795
But, you know, Will has lots of friends.

398
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,328
He makes us all feeI speciaI.
For a little while.

399
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:57,610
Bitch.

400
00:35:58,288 --> 00:36:00,051
There you go.

401
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,854
OK. Spread it out a little.
Good job! Excellent.

402
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:06,419
- I didn't burn a hole through it.
- No, you didn't.

403
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:08,293
Hey, Dad.

404
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:12,961
Do you and Mom ever talk
about getting back together?

405
00:36:13,036 --> 00:36:16,096
Jonah, your mom's about to get married.

406
00:36:16,172 --> 00:36:19,608
So? You have dibs.
You married her first.

407
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:23,305
Yes, I did. And it was a good marriage.

408
00:36:24,714 --> 00:36:26,739
It was. It lasted a long, long time.

409
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:28,910
We have two great kids out of it.

410
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:32,979
It's just...
You know, love's not always...

411
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:38,526
That's not always enough.
It's probably...

412
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:40,995
hard to understand.

413
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:44,966
What has one eye, speaks French
and really loves cookies?

414
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,265
Are you talking...
Are you talking about love?

415
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:52,672
OK, OK. Cookies. Very good.

416
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:57,372
I changed the subject to cookies.
Is that cooI?

417
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:59,347
Yeah. I'll get them.

418
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,014
Is everything OK?

419
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,364
Hey. You never came back for me.

420
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,294
Ronnie?

421
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:21,201
- Just go away! OK?
- What's wrong?

422
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:23,330
Go away!

423
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:28,468
Ronnie, what happened? Ronnie!

424
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:36,250
I'm sorry, sir.
Could you tell me what's going on?

425
00:37:38,455 --> 00:37:42,585
That would require my understanding
how the female brain works,

426
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:46,220
which I don't, but if you'd like
to come in and be clueless together,

427
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:47,888
you're more than welcome.

428
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:54,333
- That's OK. I'll just wait out here.
- Yeah.

429
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:13,279
How long you think he'll stay?

430
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:17,690
- Why don't you go ask him?
- He's not my boyfriend, he's hers.

431
00:38:17,727 --> 00:38:20,389
He's not my boyfriend, either.

432
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,999
Do you think he'll
stay out there all night?

433
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:28,765
That's hard to say.

434
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:32,171
- A dollar says he is.
- A dollar?

435
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:36,535
OK, you're on.
Let's make it interesting. 2 dollars.

436
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:39,241
Two bucks. He's not staying there.

437
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,409
What if he stays out there forever?
What if he never leaves and then dies?

438
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:48,116
Yeah, and his corpse
is eaten by a bunch of raccoons.

439
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:53,119
And then he still doesn't leave,
'cause that's how powerfuI his love is.

440
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:55,391
What is wrong with you two?

441
00:38:55,431 --> 00:38:58,298
Turtles. Turtles eat his corpse.

442
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:05,136
You need to leave.
You're freaking out my little brother.

443
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:08,336
Not untiI you tell me what happened.
Was it Ashley?

444
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:10,504
I saw you talking to her.
What did she say?

445
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,481
- Just leave, all right?
- Tell me what she said to you.

446
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,452
Will, I did not come here for some
stupid summer romance...

447
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:19,512
with some stupid locaI boy...

448
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:22,683
that has done this
with a thousand other girls.

449
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,920
- What?
- Ashley told me about...

450
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:27,828
all the girls you've been with.

451
00:39:27,897 --> 00:39:30,593
So I don't want to be
just the next girl...

452
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:32,931
in your little parade of girls, Will.

453
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:37,099
Going on the same date,
doing the exact same thing.

454
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:41,810
I think that's why it would
just be better if we just end it.

455
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:43,470
End it?

456
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:45,173
End what?

457
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:48,843
Ronnie, yes, OK, I went out
with other girls before I met you.

458
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:52,149
That's the point. It was before I
met you! How can you be mad about that?

459
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:57,181
Don't you dare make this about me. You
and I both know this is not my fault...

460
00:40:19,515 --> 00:40:21,745
You're not like the other girls.

461
00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:56,112
What just happened?

462
00:41:00,657 --> 00:41:04,024
- Your sister just got kissed.
- Dad!

463
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,392
- Well, you did. Look at her.
- No!

464
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:08,727
- Jonah! Look at that face.
- Dad!

465
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:11,359
Your sister... Hey!
Let's write a song about being kissed!

466
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:13,699
- I'm going to be sick.
- Ronnie got kissed...

467
00:41:13,736 --> 00:41:15,897
- Stop it!
- OK, OK.

468
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:18,031
- Are you OK?
- Yes, yes, but...

469
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:20,201
What?

470
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:22,008
Wow.

471
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:24,070
- I'm going to sleep.
- It's still there.

472
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:26,308
- I hate you.
- Wow.

473
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,416
Stop!

474
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:35,253
Stop!

475
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,225
Put me down!

476
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:48,154
I can't believe you're
carving our name into the tree.

477
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:52,825
- What's your middle initiaI?
- I'm not telling you.

478
00:42:52,902 --> 00:42:55,166
This is really lame.

479
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:58,471
- "L"...
- "L"...

480
00:42:58,508 --> 00:43:00,499
And make it look nice.

481
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:13,151
- I like this song.
- OK.

482
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:30,498
Man, wow.

483
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:35,010
You can really sing.

484
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:38,343
Is there anything else
I don't know about you?

485
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:48,253
No!

486
00:43:48,324 --> 00:43:49,848
Just go with it. We got it.

487
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:53,555
No!

488
00:43:58,067 --> 00:43:59,591
No!

489
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:10,539
- Where are we going?
- Just a little shortcut. Trust me.

490
00:44:12,615 --> 00:44:15,584
- How's it going out there?
- Oh, yeah.

491
00:44:17,787 --> 00:44:19,948
You know, it's getting kind of dark.

492
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:22,081
This is usually the part where the guy
with the chainsaw...

493
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:25,855
comes out from behind the trees
and hacks us to pieces.

494
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:28,557
Could you just give it some gas, please?

495
00:44:31,901 --> 00:44:33,664
OK, a little harder.

496
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:38,799
OK, OK!

497
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,511
- No, please! No, no.
- Where are you going? Come here.

498
00:44:51,387 --> 00:44:53,252
I'm gonna get you.

499
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:01,026
Come back over here!

500
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,595
Where did you go?

501
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:16,843
Will, I'm serious.

502
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:20,679
Will, I am not meeting your family
for the first time looking like this.

503
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,275
It's fine. They're not home.

504
00:45:24,253 --> 00:45:27,222
Besides, I'm not taking you
to the movies like that.

505
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,723
Got a reputation to maintain.

506
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:30,123
Wow.

507
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:37,727
- Hello?
- Hey, George.

508
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,132
- Hello, Will.
- What are we doing?

509
00:45:43,272 --> 00:45:45,069
Who's George?

510
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:01,589
Will, where are we? Graceland?

511
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:05,184
Wait. Do you work here too?

512
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,865
This is your house? You live here?

513
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:25,244
You're rich?

514
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:28,539
Will, you told me that your dad
owned a brake shop!

515
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:31,417
He does. He just happens
to own 300 more just like it.

516
00:46:31,487 --> 00:46:34,047
- No, no, I am not going in there.
- Yes, you are.

517
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:36,114
Not looking like this!
What if somebody sees me?

518
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:37,523
- Let go.
- Nope.

519
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,551
- Let go.
- You let go!

520
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:44,363
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What difference does it make?

521
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,300
Hello.

522
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:48,860
Mom. I thought you
and Dad were going out.

523
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:52,805
We decided to come back early.

524
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:57,710
This is Ronnie.

525
00:47:00,116 --> 00:47:01,743
Hi.

526
00:47:03,753 --> 00:47:06,449
Perhaps you should hose off in back.

527
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:09,582
It's cold.

528
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,159
Here, do my hair.

529
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,060
Go.

530
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:26,037
These are Will's sister's.

531
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:29,400
They should fit you.

532
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:31,106
Thank you, ma'am.

533
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:39,480
Here, turn around.

534
00:47:39,555 --> 00:47:40,613
Cold!

535
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:45,650
It's a family tradition. Both my parents
went to college at Vanderbilt.

536
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:48,094
Tom and I actually met there.
Didn't we, Tom?

537
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:53,300
And now, our William
will go there as well.

538
00:47:53,335 --> 00:47:56,168
- Where will you be going, Ronnie?
- I'm not...

539
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,101
going anywhere.

540
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:05,706
I mean, I don't really have
anywhere planned for me, or...

541
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:11,143
I just haven't figured out
the whole college thing yet.

542
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:16,819
But...

543
00:48:16,892 --> 00:48:20,328
Will, pass Ronnie some roast beef.

544
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:23,126
- No, thank you.
- I told you, Ronnie's a vegetarian.

545
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:26,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

546
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:32,297
- Why?
- Just reasons.

547
00:48:35,811 --> 00:48:38,609
I mean, it's not that I don't
like people that like meat.

548
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:41,639
I mean, they're fine. Just that...

549
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:45,313
- How you been, Dad?
- Oh, I been good. Good.

550
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:49,848
You know, I was going through
some of Mikey's stuff the other day.

551
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:54,386
- And if you have time...
- That's enough, Tom.

552
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:08,441
Well, she's a lot prettier
than you described her, Will.

553
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:11,378
Thank you, Dad.

554
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:13,881
You bringing her to the wedding?

555
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,085
He didn't tell you? His sister's
getting married in a couple of weeks.

556
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:25,150
No, I don't think you
did mention that, Will.

557
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,623
- Would you like to come?
- Will?

558
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:33,930
Your sister told me
that you were bringing Ashley.

559
00:49:34,003 --> 00:49:36,904
I sent out her invitation
just yesterday.

560
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:42,801
- Ronnie, this is silly.
- Drop it, Will.

561
00:49:42,878 --> 00:49:44,436
I can't drop it. You're mad.

562
00:49:44,513 --> 00:49:46,037
- I'm not mad.
- You're mad.

563
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:49,414
I'm not! You want to go to your sister's
wedding with your ex-girlfriend,

564
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:50,918
- it's not a big deaI.
- Not as a date.

565
00:49:50,953 --> 00:49:53,888
She's a friend of my sister's.
I said it was OK if she came.

566
00:49:53,923 --> 00:49:56,653
Honestly, it's not a big deal
because I don't wanna go...

567
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:59,193
to some wedding
where I don't know anybody.

568
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:01,423
- Ronnie...
- And you just forgot to mention...

569
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:04,432
you're going to Vanderbilt.
You told me you're going to Columbia.

570
00:50:04,466 --> 00:50:07,697
No, I didn't.
I told you I was accepted to Columbia.

571
00:50:07,736 --> 00:50:10,796
Ronnie, it's complicated, OK?
My parents are...

572
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:15,232
- Not a good time to disappoint them.
- What's complicated? It's your life.

573
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:18,212
- Go to the college that you want to.
- It's not that simple.

574
00:50:18,814 --> 00:50:20,805
Look, we don't have to do this.

575
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,981
- What do you mean?
- Maybe you should find someone...

576
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:30,822
that's more suited to your lifestyle.
You know, with her own rich parents,

577
00:50:30,893 --> 00:50:32,918
- her own perfect mansion...
- Ronnie,

578
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:35,931
there is nothing perfect
about that house.

579
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:40,129
Can you not see that? My parents
are holding on by a thread.

580
00:50:40,169 --> 00:50:44,629
Perfect? Nothing's been perfect
in my family for a long time.

581
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:56,043
I had a brother. Mikey.

582
00:50:57,186 --> 00:50:59,177
He died last year.

583
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:02,787
How?

584
00:51:02,825 --> 00:51:05,055
Car accident.

585
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,664
My mom was driving.

586
00:51:09,698 --> 00:51:12,962
Mikey and I were in the back seat,
goofing off, playing Mercy.

587
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:15,235
We were being idiots.

588
00:51:15,303 --> 00:51:17,828
She turned around to tell us to stop,

589
00:51:17,872 --> 00:51:20,340
and she lost controI of the car.

590
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:28,576
He was killed instantly.

591
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,656
It's just so hard
to feeI happy in that house.

592
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,295
It's the only reason
I didn't invite you to the wedding.

593
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:46,558
I went out with those girls
because I was...

594
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:49,068
trying to feeI something again.

595
00:51:56,844 --> 00:51:59,608
No one has made me feeI
like you do, Ronnie.

596
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:05,218
I don't want to lose you.

597
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:26,330
I love you, Will.

598
00:52:28,176 --> 00:52:30,201
I love you too.

599
00:52:39,954 --> 00:52:43,481
And, since you asked...

600
00:52:45,693 --> 00:52:48,389
...there is something
that you don't know about me.

601
00:52:49,964 --> 00:52:51,625
Come here.

602
00:53:06,214 --> 00:53:08,444
What are we doing here?

603
00:55:01,028 --> 00:55:04,464
Hey. Did you have a good time?

604
00:55:12,673 --> 00:55:13,731
What?

605
00:55:14,842 --> 00:55:16,537
I played today.

606
00:55:19,514 --> 00:55:21,880
That's...

607
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:23,975
That's good. How did it feeI?

608
00:55:29,223 --> 00:55:31,418
Like I never stopped.

609
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:39,964
Dad...

610
00:55:43,237 --> 00:55:47,469
I'd probably talk about this with
a girlfriend if I had one here, but...

611
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:51,103
I don't, so...

612
00:55:55,082 --> 00:55:58,813
So you wanna talk?
You wanna talk?

613
00:55:58,886 --> 00:56:00,513
Here we go.
Let's talk.

614
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:03,079
Yeah?

615
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:13,999
So you... you like this guy?

616
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,300
You like him...
You like him a lot?

617
00:56:24,045 --> 00:56:25,603
I like him more than a lot.

618
00:56:28,082 --> 00:56:31,017
- Really?
- Is that crazy?

619
00:56:34,455 --> 00:56:37,424
Well, a little, but...

620
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:42,356
love is, Ronnie.

621
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,491
Crazy... a little.

622
00:56:48,703 --> 00:56:50,568
Thank you.

623
00:57:03,484 --> 00:57:04,883
Good night, Dad.

624
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,031
Dad!

625
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:21,694
- Hey!
- There she is.

626
00:57:21,736 --> 00:57:25,172
Look, a shoplifter and an arsonist.

627
00:57:26,507 --> 00:57:30,204
I'm sorry. Did you not know
about your dad and the church?

628
00:57:31,979 --> 00:57:34,539
- Hey! Hi.
- Hey, Jonah.

629
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:38,714
- This is so cooI.
- It is cooI.

630
00:57:38,753 --> 00:57:40,880
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Dad.

631
00:57:40,955 --> 00:57:42,718
OK.

632
00:57:43,424 --> 00:57:45,358
What's up?

633
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:52,898
Keep your head in the game, brother.
Got it?

634
00:58:28,035 --> 00:58:29,127
Yeah!

635
00:58:48,222 --> 00:58:49,883
Good game, man.

636
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:55,251
Yeah!

637
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:00,058
Here you go.

638
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:06,238
Come on. Open it!

639
00:59:12,913 --> 00:59:14,938
Dad!

640
00:59:14,982 --> 00:59:18,179
Dad, you're right.
I got invited to the wedding.

641
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:25,656
- That's great, and...
- Thank you.

642
00:59:25,726 --> 00:59:28,422
Since I know
you have nothing to wear...

643
00:59:28,462 --> 00:59:31,295
to a fancy Blakelee mansion to-do...

644
00:59:31,332 --> 00:59:33,630
- I wasn't gonna ask you.
- Forget it.

645
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:36,295
Besides, I never got a chance
to get you a prom dress.

646
00:59:36,337 --> 00:59:39,738
- Not that you went.
- No.

647
00:59:50,384 --> 00:59:52,682
Why do you come here so much?

648
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,348
I spent half my childhood
in this building.

649
00:59:55,389 --> 00:59:57,653
I loved it here. I still do.

650
00:59:57,691 --> 01:00:00,785
Then why do people
say you burned it down?

651
01:00:02,396 --> 01:00:05,854
- You heard that?
- Is it true?

652
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:10,830
Yes.

653
01:00:10,871 --> 01:00:14,102
I was the last one in here that night.

654
01:00:14,175 --> 01:00:17,406
I'd come in here to play the piano.

655
01:00:17,478 --> 01:00:20,311
The next thing I remember is waking up
across the street...

656
01:00:20,347 --> 01:00:23,578
after the firemen had carried me out.

657
01:00:23,651 --> 01:00:26,814
- How did it start?
- I...

658
01:00:26,854 --> 01:00:31,621
Just stupid. There were some candles
burning, I had fallen asleep, and...

659
01:00:31,692 --> 01:00:34,559
- Dad.
- I might have been a little confused.

660
01:00:34,628 --> 01:00:37,426
I was taking medicine
that my doctor had given me...

661
01:00:37,498 --> 01:00:41,457
- Medicine? What doctor?
- Ronnie, it's OK.

662
01:00:41,535 --> 01:00:44,902
It's OK now. I'm fine.

663
01:00:45,906 --> 01:00:48,136
This was last year. I'm fine.

664
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:50,200
- You're OK?
- Yes.

665
01:00:53,948 --> 01:00:55,074
OK.

666
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,658
He thinks that he did it.

667
01:01:16,971 --> 01:01:20,429
My dad thinks that he's the one
that burned down the church.

668
01:01:24,578 --> 01:01:26,603
I'm sure he didn't do it.

669
01:01:28,048 --> 01:01:32,280
It's just...
just people talking.

670
01:01:44,164 --> 01:01:46,098
Can we talk?

671
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:56,339
What's up?

672
01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:02,279
- What's up, Will?
- You got to come clean about the fire.

673
01:02:02,983 --> 01:02:04,314
You didn't just say that.

674
01:02:04,351 --> 01:02:09,288
Her father thinks he did it. People in
town think he did it. You know that.

675
01:02:11,659 --> 01:02:13,650
How long you known this girI?

676
01:02:14,962 --> 01:02:17,294
You've known me your entire life.

677
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:20,129
And you know that,
if you say anything...

678
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:23,364
to anybody about that night,
my life is over.

679
01:02:27,408 --> 01:02:30,138
They'll say it was arson, Will,
and you know that.

680
01:02:31,812 --> 01:02:34,042
I'm going back to work.

681
01:02:38,152 --> 01:02:40,086
Just let it go, all right?

682
01:02:42,957 --> 01:02:45,551
I just want my money, OK?

683
01:02:45,592 --> 01:02:48,652
I don't have it, Marcus,
and you know that.

684
01:02:48,696 --> 01:02:51,392
- Just get it. Just get it. OK?
- Please.

685
01:02:51,465 --> 01:02:52,557
- Hey!
- I'll get it.

686
01:02:52,633 --> 01:02:56,091
Excuse me! Excuse me.
We're talking over here, OK?

687
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:59,367
- Blaze, are you OK?
- I said get the hell out of here!

688
01:02:59,406 --> 01:03:01,704
- Blaze!
- Just go away!

689
01:03:01,742 --> 01:03:03,539
Marcus! Stop!

690
01:03:03,577 --> 01:03:05,670
I'm not running
a damn homeless shelter!

691
01:03:05,713 --> 01:03:07,237
- Don't go!
- I want my money.

692
01:03:07,314 --> 01:03:10,875
- Don't go. Stop!
- Get off the car!

693
01:03:10,918 --> 01:03:12,783
- Off the car!
- Don't leave me!

694
01:03:12,853 --> 01:03:16,084
- I have nowhere else to live!
- Shut up!

695
01:03:17,825 --> 01:03:19,884
Don't go!

696
01:03:22,863 --> 01:03:25,525
Great! Great! Do you see what you did?

697
01:03:25,566 --> 01:03:28,228
Are you happy now? God!

698
01:03:31,772 --> 01:03:34,639
- You don't deserve that, Blaze.
- You don't know me, OK?

699
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:38,337
You don't know anything.
You just don't get it.

700
01:04:12,579 --> 01:04:13,910
Dad says lunch is ready.

701
01:04:13,947 --> 01:04:16,074
I can't eat. I got to find something
to wear to the wedding.

702
01:04:16,116 --> 01:04:18,812
What happened
to the money Dad gave you?

703
01:04:20,587 --> 01:04:23,351
If you tell him, I kill you, OK?

704
01:04:23,424 --> 01:04:27,224
I was on my way to buy the dress and...
I gave the money away.

705
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:28,285
What?!

706
01:04:30,731 --> 01:04:32,358
Don't worry about it.

707
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:36,597
Wow, you may be older,
but I am so much smarter than you.

708
01:04:46,747 --> 01:04:50,114
- Where did you get all that?
- Where to begin...

709
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:53,813
This is for when I told Dad
I didn't see you at the festivaI.

710
01:04:53,854 --> 01:04:56,948
This is what I won playing liar's poker.

711
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:00,619
Remember when you snuck
in past curfew in New York?

712
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:03,528
That's for that.
This is for the guy with the tattoo...

713
01:05:03,597 --> 01:05:05,724
OK, that's enough. I get it.

714
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:11,699
I can't take your life savings.

715
01:05:11,772 --> 01:05:15,367
Knowing you, there's a lot more
where that came from.

716
01:05:15,442 --> 01:05:17,535
And besides, I like Will.

717
01:05:17,611 --> 01:05:20,808
I don't want him breaking up with you
'cause you look crappy at a wedding.

718
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,111
Thank you.

719
01:05:39,566 --> 01:05:41,693
- I don't think he'll like it.
- I like it.

720
01:05:41,735 --> 01:05:44,829
- You can't wear that to a wedding!
- I like it!

721
01:06:39,526 --> 01:06:41,255
- Save me some cake, man.
- Yeah.

722
01:06:41,295 --> 01:06:42,387
Yo.

723
01:06:44,264 --> 01:06:46,425
Hey, no funny business.

724
01:06:46,466 --> 01:06:50,095
I don't think you can actually
try funny business at a wedding, sir.

725
01:06:50,137 --> 01:06:53,971
You can definitely
try funny business at a wedding.

726
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:56,839
- I've done it.
- I see.

727
01:06:59,513 --> 01:07:01,640
Kind of makes this
a mixed message, then.

728
01:07:02,616 --> 01:07:05,244
- Hands off, OK?
- Yes, sir.

729
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,822
Ronnie.

730
01:07:23,337 --> 01:07:25,498
Do I look all right?

731
01:07:25,572 --> 01:07:27,335
Yeah.

732
01:07:38,952 --> 01:07:43,184
Do you, Philip Louis,
take this woman, Megan Blakelee,

733
01:07:43,257 --> 01:07:47,853
to be your lawfully wedded wife
as long as you both shall live?

734
01:07:47,894 --> 01:07:50,886
- I do.
- You may now kiss the bride.

735
01:08:10,951 --> 01:08:14,079
- Hey, Blaze.
- Hey.

736
01:08:15,555 --> 01:08:18,149
Look, I...

737
01:08:18,191 --> 01:08:22,560
I didn't deserve it, what you did
the other day, but... thank you.

738
01:08:22,629 --> 01:08:25,723
- It's OK.
- I broke up with him.

739
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:29,428
Marcus. You're right,
he's totally a jerk.

740
01:08:29,503 --> 01:08:32,734
- And I moved out.
- Good for you.

741
01:08:32,806 --> 01:08:34,433
Yeah.

742
01:08:36,376 --> 01:08:39,004
OK, well, I should get back to work.

743
01:08:39,046 --> 01:08:41,571
I'll see you around then, OK?

744
01:08:41,648 --> 01:08:43,513
Thank you.

745
01:08:59,066 --> 01:09:01,694
- You're a good dancer.
- And you're a liar.

746
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:05,068
- You're also the prettiest one here.
- And now I know you're Iying.

747
01:09:10,277 --> 01:09:12,541
Get away from me, Marcus! I mean it!

748
01:09:12,579 --> 01:09:15,275
- You think you can just leave?
- Yes! We're done!

749
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:19,376
Look, I got your note. I didn't like it.

750
01:09:19,419 --> 01:09:22,217
We're done when I say we're done.

751
01:09:22,255 --> 01:09:25,156
Marcus, what are you doing here?

752
01:09:25,225 --> 01:09:28,388
- Hey, just stay out of this, rich boy.
- I want you to leave.

753
01:09:28,428 --> 01:09:32,125
- Will? Who are these people?
- I got it.

754
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:34,565
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- You people.

755
01:09:34,601 --> 01:09:37,229
You people just think you're
so much better than me.

756
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:40,239
- Blaze, walk away from him.
- No, no, no. You stay.

757
01:09:40,273 --> 01:09:42,298
This is his sister's wedding,
for God's sake.

758
01:09:42,376 --> 01:09:44,401
You're leaving. Get out of here.

759
01:09:46,413 --> 01:09:47,744
Suit yourself then.

760
01:09:48,382 --> 01:09:50,680
- Hey! Get in your truck!
- What?

761
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:55,313
- How about now?
- All right, man, all right.

762
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:58,452
I changed my mind.

763
01:09:58,492 --> 01:10:00,517
I don't want her. I want her.

764
01:10:02,662 --> 01:10:06,758
She seems like she'd be pretty fun
to have around for the summer.

765
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,200
- Huh, William?
- Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?!

766
01:10:11,905 --> 01:10:14,169
- Will!
- Ronnie!

767
01:10:18,278 --> 01:10:20,109
Will! Will!

768
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:22,445
That's enough! Get up!

769
01:10:38,765 --> 01:10:39,857
Will...

770
01:10:40,834 --> 01:10:43,064
Just take the girI home.

771
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:46,867
Both of them. Just clear out.

772
01:11:05,058 --> 01:11:08,425
- Well, that was fun.
- Yeah.

773
01:11:08,495 --> 01:11:11,589
Think I finally won your mom over!

774
01:11:11,665 --> 01:11:15,863
Hey, guys! Dad thinks the turtles
are gonna hatch tonight. Come on!

775
01:11:15,902 --> 01:11:18,370
- All right, let's go.
- We don't want to miss it!

776
01:11:18,405 --> 01:11:19,838
- Get out here!
- We're coming!

777
01:11:19,873 --> 01:11:22,899
- Jeez, you guys are a mess!
- Thanks.

778
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:25,410
- What did he say?
- Come on!

779
01:11:30,217 --> 01:11:32,378
- Oh, my God.
- Look at them.

780
01:11:32,419 --> 01:11:35,855
- BeautifuI.
- So cooI.

781
01:11:35,889 --> 01:11:38,517
- They're amazing.
- They're awesome!

782
01:11:54,374 --> 01:11:57,275
- Why are you doing that?
- To help them get to the sea.

783
01:12:10,223 --> 01:12:12,487
- I'm gonna get another light.
- OK.

784
01:12:12,559 --> 01:12:14,993
- I want one.
- I can't believe that we saved them.

785
01:12:35,048 --> 01:12:36,982
Daddy!

786
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:47,315
Call 911. Daddy!

787
01:13:25,632 --> 01:13:28,066
I'm gonna need a rush on this.

788
01:13:30,103 --> 01:13:31,832
Hey.

789
01:13:31,871 --> 01:13:35,637
You should go home and change.
You'll scare the nurses.

790
01:13:38,111 --> 01:13:41,376
What you said before... are you sure?

791
01:13:55,028 --> 01:13:57,895
We'll make him as comfortable as we can,

792
01:13:57,964 --> 01:14:00,592
but the cancer has spread to his lungs.

793
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:07,230
- How long?
- It's hard to know.

794
01:14:07,307 --> 01:14:10,504
But we're not gonna quit, OK?

795
01:14:15,982 --> 01:14:18,280
I want to tell you something.

796
01:14:21,321 --> 01:14:24,757
When your father realized
how serious his condition was...

797
01:14:24,824 --> 01:14:26,621
a couple months ago,

798
01:14:26,693 --> 01:14:31,255
he asked that we cut back
on his medication.

799
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:33,356
Why?

800
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,925
Because he wanted to be here.

801
01:14:36,002 --> 01:14:39,870
Really be here
with you and your brother.

802
01:14:39,906 --> 01:14:41,897
That's what he said.

803
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:08,567
Well, this wasn't on the calendar.

804
01:15:28,054 --> 01:15:29,954
- Ronnie...
- You lied to me, Dad.

805
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:32,150
- I didn't lie.
- Yes, you did, Dad.

806
01:15:32,225 --> 01:15:35,661
You said you were fine.
You're not fine! That was a lie!

807
01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:38,027
I hoped.

808
01:15:38,098 --> 01:15:40,692
I didn't lie.
It's not the same thing.

809
01:15:46,406 --> 01:15:48,465
- It's all right to be angry.
- Good.

810
01:15:49,609 --> 01:15:52,476
Is this why you
brought me here this summer?

811
01:15:54,748 --> 01:15:57,808
Is it? So you wouldn't
have to be alone while...

812
01:16:01,988 --> 01:16:03,649
Why didn't you tell us?

813
01:16:05,525 --> 01:16:08,358
It's not what
I wanted this time to be about.

814
01:16:08,428 --> 01:16:12,228
- Well, it is now, Daddy!
- No, it's not.

815
01:16:12,298 --> 01:16:14,198
It's just another...

816
01:16:15,635 --> 01:16:18,832
...part of a terrific summer.

817
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,331
Not one of the better parts, I admit.

818
01:16:27,614 --> 01:16:31,675
- Love you.
- Sweetie, I love you too.

819
01:16:33,286 --> 01:16:35,550
Come here.

820
01:16:37,023 --> 01:16:39,287
I love you, Daddy.

821
01:16:53,006 --> 01:16:55,600
You want some cookies, bro?

822
01:16:55,675 --> 01:16:58,940
Why won't anyone
tell me what's going on?

823
01:17:01,614 --> 01:17:05,846
Jonah, I think Ronnie and your dad
will talk to you as soon as they can.

824
01:17:07,987 --> 01:17:10,353
Why don't you tell me now?

825
01:17:12,392 --> 01:17:15,122
Well, it's complicated.

826
01:17:19,566 --> 01:17:21,056
Can I come and see him yet?

827
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,432
Yeah. He's waiting for you.

828
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:25,601
Come on.

829
01:17:47,293 --> 01:17:50,228
He's never gonna
get to see him grow up.

830
01:18:16,422 --> 01:18:18,014
Jonah!

831
01:18:18,725 --> 01:18:20,693
- Dang it!
- What are you doing?

832
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,092
- I can't reach it!
- Get down from there!

833
01:18:23,129 --> 01:18:24,994
- Get away!
- What happened to you?

834
01:18:25,064 --> 01:18:26,827
- Just get away!
- Get down!

835
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,595
- Hey, hey!
- Get away!

836
01:18:28,635 --> 01:18:31,627
- Hey, what's going on?
- Stay away! I can do it!

837
01:18:31,704 --> 01:18:34,298
Me and Dad have been working
on this all summer!

838
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,604
Me and Dad. Not you.

839
01:18:36,643 --> 01:18:40,238
All you cared about
was the stupid turtles...

840
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:44,546
and your stupid boyfriend!
I was with him every day!

841
01:18:44,617 --> 01:18:47,017
And now... Dang it!

842
01:18:47,086 --> 01:18:49,111
Now I can't reach things,

843
01:18:49,155 --> 01:18:52,818
and I need to finish this
so Dad will get better!

844
01:18:54,527 --> 01:18:57,462
- We'll help you.
- You don't know how!

845
01:18:57,497 --> 01:18:59,124
Will you show us?

846
01:19:08,341 --> 01:19:09,808
Yeah.

847
01:19:38,371 --> 01:19:41,101
- That's good, right?
- Yeah.

848
01:21:00,753 --> 01:21:03,119
What?

849
01:21:03,156 --> 01:21:06,990
Ronnie, I need you to take me home.

850
01:21:10,963 --> 01:21:12,897
OK.

851
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:16,692
We just have to stop here for a second.

852
01:21:34,887 --> 01:21:36,445
We finished it.

853
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:40,653
Of course, I had to train an assistant,
but we did it.

854
01:21:41,928 --> 01:21:44,829
You did good, Joe-boy. Really.

855
01:22:12,358 --> 01:22:13,518
Please.

856
01:22:18,331 --> 01:22:20,424
OK.

857
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,333
We were behind the church, sir.

858
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:34,210
We were just goofing around
and drinking... and stuff.

859
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:37,511
And then Marcus
and his guys showed up.

860
01:22:38,151 --> 01:22:42,019
And that's when Will left.

861
01:22:42,054 --> 01:22:46,388
And... then we started...

862
01:22:46,425 --> 01:22:48,757
We started playing around with...

863
01:22:48,828 --> 01:22:51,524
- Fire?
- Yeah.

864
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:00,732
We should have told you sooner, sir.

865
01:23:00,806 --> 01:23:02,603
That's my fault.

866
01:23:03,843 --> 01:23:07,711
Will wanted to tell the police
right away, and I begged him not to.

867
01:23:07,747 --> 01:23:10,181
But we're gonna go
right after we're done here.

868
01:23:10,216 --> 01:23:12,275
No, don't do that.

869
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:15,277
People think it was you, sir.

870
01:23:15,354 --> 01:23:19,017
Yeah... they do.

871
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:20,582
They will. So what?

872
01:23:21,294 --> 01:23:23,421
It's... It's fine. Really.

873
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:26,898
I don't want you to do that, OK?
This stays between us.

874
01:23:26,933 --> 01:23:28,992
Thank you, sir.

875
01:23:29,068 --> 01:23:31,628
- OK?
- Thank you.

876
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:39,441
Wait.

877
01:23:42,148 --> 01:23:44,207
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

878
01:23:45,751 --> 01:23:47,116
- Ronnie!
- You were there?

879
01:23:47,186 --> 01:23:49,654
- I wanted to tell you.
- You saw what it did to him.

880
01:23:49,722 --> 01:23:51,917
I know! I tried to get Scott to fess up.

881
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:53,585
Why didn't you say something?

882
01:23:53,626 --> 01:23:56,493
It's not that simple.
It wasn't about me! Scott's a good guy.

883
01:23:56,562 --> 01:23:59,861
I don't care, Will!
You knew how guilty my dad felt,

884
01:23:59,932 --> 01:24:02,594
and you let him feeI that way!

885
01:24:02,635 --> 01:24:06,571
Just go off to that college that your
parents have picked out for you.

886
01:24:06,606 --> 01:24:09,973
Go find some other girI that makes
you feeI alive for five minutes!

887
01:24:10,009 --> 01:24:12,000
- One that can stand to be near you.
- Stop.

888
01:24:12,078 --> 01:24:14,911
Don't touch me. Will!

889
01:24:14,947 --> 01:24:17,381
Don't touch me!

890
01:24:19,485 --> 01:24:21,680
You're a coward, Will.

891
01:24:21,754 --> 01:24:23,813
You're a coward, and you're a liar.

892
01:24:25,524 --> 01:24:27,321
And I don't trust you.

893
01:24:28,594 --> 01:24:30,027
I don't want you near me.

894
01:24:30,096 --> 01:24:32,792
And I don't want you near my dad.

895
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:35,391
Go.

896
01:24:37,103 --> 01:24:38,900
Go.

897
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:18,666
- I love you.
- I love you too.

898
01:25:21,446 --> 01:25:23,471
I love you too.

899
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:31,245
Are you packed?

900
01:25:31,323 --> 01:25:33,518
I'm not going with you, Mom.

901
01:25:34,693 --> 01:25:36,752
I'm gonna stay here with Dad.

902
01:25:37,495 --> 01:25:39,190
He's gonna get worse.

903
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:42,222
A lot worse.
And in a few weeks, he...

904
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:43,757
- I don't care.
- Honey.

905
01:25:43,835 --> 01:25:46,998
Your dad doesn't want you guys
to see him like this.

906
01:25:49,174 --> 01:25:52,974
AII I did all summer was fight with him.

907
01:25:54,946 --> 01:25:59,110
- I was so mean to him.
- No, no, baby.

908
01:25:59,184 --> 01:26:01,243
I promise you,

909
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:04,618
it meant the world
to him to have you here.

910
01:26:05,357 --> 01:26:08,258
Look, Mom. I'm gonna stay.

911
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:35,112
Hey, buddy. You OK?

912
01:26:36,921 --> 01:26:40,288
Are you gonna say goodbye?
I really don't want to hear it.

913
01:26:40,358 --> 01:26:42,656
Good, 'cause I'm not gonna say it.

914
01:26:44,162 --> 01:26:48,360
I'm not gonna say goodbye,
because I'm not going anywhere.

915
01:26:48,433 --> 01:26:50,628
OK?

916
01:26:50,702 --> 01:26:52,294
Come here.

917
01:27:01,146 --> 01:27:04,445
Every time a light shines
through that window we built...

918
01:27:06,217 --> 01:27:08,447
or any window at all...

919
01:27:10,155 --> 01:27:12,316
that's me, OK?

920
01:27:13,591 --> 01:27:15,718
I'm not going away.

921
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:33,896
Dear Ronnie, I miss the hours
we spent together at the piano.

922
01:28:33,938 --> 01:28:35,599
I miss being your teacher.

923
01:28:35,673 --> 01:28:38,540
<i>I know you see me as having left you,</i>

924
01:28:38,576 --> 01:28:41,670
but when your mother and I split up,
I was in a lot of pain.

925
01:28:41,713 --> 01:28:44,443
I just needed to come home.

926
01:28:44,516 --> 01:28:48,612
<i>I regret moving away from you
and Jonah more than anything.</i>

927
01:28:48,686 --> 01:28:50,119
I hope you'll forgive me.

928
01:28:50,188 --> 01:28:53,749
Your mom tells me you
completely failed your SATs,

929
01:28:53,825 --> 01:28:57,955
but I know how smart you have to be
to get every single question wrong.

930
01:28:58,029 --> 01:29:00,122
Congratulations, Ronnie.

931
01:29:00,198 --> 01:29:03,929
<i>I've told you before that none of what
happened between your mother and me...</i>

932
01:29:04,002 --> 01:29:06,562
<i>had anything to do with you or Jonah.</i>

933
01:29:06,604 --> 01:29:08,663
Love is fragile, Ronnie.

934
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:11,004
And we're not always
its best caretakers.

935
01:29:11,075 --> 01:29:13,805
We just muddle through
and do the best we can...

936
01:29:13,878 --> 01:29:16,904
and hope this fragile thing survives,

937
01:29:16,948 --> 01:29:19,473
against all odds.

938
01:29:38,269 --> 01:29:41,466
He's probably started college by now.

939
01:29:41,506 --> 01:29:43,770
Do you miss him?

940
01:29:45,643 --> 01:29:47,770
What he did was wrong, Dad.

941
01:29:49,948 --> 01:29:52,678
Yeah.

942
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,581
It was.

943
01:29:56,955 --> 01:29:59,185
I can tell you this:

944
01:30:01,326 --> 01:30:05,490
- He misses you.
- I doubt it.

945
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,630
You don't even know who you are, Ronnie.

946
01:30:13,538 --> 01:30:15,733
Who am I?

947
01:30:17,942 --> 01:30:21,207
You are the kindest, sweetest...

948
01:30:23,147 --> 01:30:25,672
most beautifuI daughter
in the whole world.

949
01:30:25,717 --> 01:30:29,653
Thank you, but you're
kind of obligated to say that, Dad.

950
01:30:29,687 --> 01:30:31,086
Yeah, it is in the handbook.

951
01:30:35,126 --> 01:30:37,890
I don't have too many lectures
left on my timecard,

952
01:30:37,962 --> 01:30:40,487
so I really want you to hear this, OK?

953
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:47,400
Someday, you are
gonna open your heart,

954
01:30:47,472 --> 01:30:49,963
and you're gonna play again.

955
01:30:53,277 --> 01:30:56,007
And it's not gonna be
to make your mother happy.

956
01:30:58,116 --> 01:31:00,744
And it's not gonna be to make me happy.

957
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:04,212
It'll be for you.

958
01:31:05,657 --> 01:31:09,184
Because... music and...

959
01:31:10,528 --> 01:31:12,120
love...

960
01:31:15,266 --> 01:31:16,961
they're gonna bring you joy.

961
01:31:18,469 --> 01:31:20,369
Thank you.

962
01:31:43,227 --> 01:31:45,661
How's that song coming, lazy bones?

963
01:31:48,332 --> 01:31:50,800
Well, I'm not sure...

964
01:31:51,669 --> 01:31:53,000
I can finish it.

965
01:31:57,041 --> 01:31:59,271
My hands.

966
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:01,107
Do they hurt, Dad?

967
01:32:03,114 --> 01:32:05,776
Yeah.

968
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:07,613
They do.

969
01:34:58,389 --> 01:35:00,550
You OK?

970
01:35:00,591 --> 01:35:03,458
I can't do it, Mom.

971
01:35:03,527 --> 01:35:07,657
Look, you have a right to shut down.

972
01:35:07,732 --> 01:35:11,259
Just, please, don't push me away.

973
01:35:11,302 --> 01:35:13,964
It's what I do, Mom.

974
01:35:14,005 --> 01:35:15,996
I push people away.

975
01:35:18,976 --> 01:35:21,604
I pushed Will away too.

976
01:35:22,914 --> 01:35:25,849
We're not perfect. Any of us.

977
01:35:25,917 --> 01:35:28,681
We make mistakes, we screw up,

978
01:35:28,753 --> 01:35:31,688
but then we forgive and we move forward.

979
01:35:31,756 --> 01:35:36,716
Honey, at least
you have the courage to feeI.

980
01:35:36,794 --> 01:35:39,422
You feeI everything so deeply.

981
01:35:40,865 --> 01:35:43,459
You're your father's daughter.

982
01:36:01,152 --> 01:36:03,120
OK.

983
01:36:14,966 --> 01:36:17,730
Thank you all for coming.

984
01:36:17,802 --> 01:36:20,737
A lot of you have known my dad
since he was a kid.

985
01:36:24,909 --> 01:36:26,740
I wrote a speech.

986
01:36:26,777 --> 01:36:29,075
A few, actually.

987
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:35,342
Me and my dad,
we had a different language.

988
01:36:35,386 --> 01:36:38,048
A love that we always shared.

989
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,390
And I know that...

990
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:50,457
That's the one that he'd want me
to share with all of you guys today.

991
01:37:34,078 --> 01:37:36,137
Hi, Daddy.

992
01:38:52,289 --> 01:38:56,055
Ronnie, I'm really sorry for your loss.

993
01:38:58,863 --> 01:39:00,421
Hey.

994
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:04,361
Look, thank you for everything.

995
01:39:04,401 --> 01:39:07,495
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

996
01:39:07,538 --> 01:39:09,802
I really appreciate
everything you did, though.

997
01:39:10,574 --> 01:39:12,269
Thank you.

998
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:21,408
Hey.

999
01:39:23,053 --> 01:39:24,850
It was beautifuI, what you played.

1000
01:39:25,389 --> 01:39:27,653
It was Dad's.

1001
01:39:27,691 --> 01:39:31,252
- I finished it for him.
- I know he liked it.

1002
01:39:32,863 --> 01:39:35,855
Thank you for coming, Will.
It meant so much to me.

1003
01:39:37,902 --> 01:39:40,928
Ronnie, I have someone
I'd like for you to meet.

1004
01:39:43,574 --> 01:39:45,633
I want to introduce you
to Tommy Hampton.

1005
01:39:45,709 --> 01:39:48,610
He taught your father...

1006
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:01,784
Ronnie, I'm so sorry about everything.

1007
01:41:01,819 --> 01:41:03,810
I'm sorry, too.

1008
01:41:05,789 --> 01:41:07,950
People make mistakes, Will.

1009
01:41:07,992 --> 01:41:10,483
Even the people that we love.

1010
01:41:18,402 --> 01:41:20,165
I've decided to go to Juilliard.

1011
01:41:20,237 --> 01:41:22,535
Yeah, I heard. That's great news.

1012
01:41:22,606 --> 01:41:25,234
How's Vanderbilt?

1013
01:41:26,744 --> 01:41:28,211
It's a really good school.

1014
01:41:29,446 --> 01:41:33,382
Yeah. I'm not sure it's for me, though.

1015
01:41:35,653 --> 01:41:38,884
- What do you mean?
- I'm thinking of maybe transferring...

1016
01:41:38,956 --> 01:41:40,821
to Columbia next semester.

1017
01:41:41,558 --> 01:41:44,994
So the girl I love can watch me
make a few more mistakes.

1018
01:41:46,297 --> 01:41:48,663
What do you think about that?
