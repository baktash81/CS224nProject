00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,878
# <i>Risin' up</i>

2
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,956
# <i>Back on the street</i>

3
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,552
# <i>Did my time, took my chances</i>

4
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,637
# <i>Went the distance,</i>
<i>now I'm back on my feet</i>

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,913
# <i>Just a man and his will to survive</i>

6
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,430
# <i>So many times, it happens too fast</i>

7
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,958
# <i>You change your passion for glory</i>

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,949
# <i>Don't lose your grip</i>
<i>on the dreams of the past</i>

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,709
# <i>You must fight just to keep them alive</i>

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,992
# <i>It's the eye of the tiger,</i>
<i>it's the thrill of the fight</i>

11
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,318
# <i>Risin' up to the challenge of our rival</i>

12
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,479
# <i>And the last known survivor</i>
<i>stalks his prey in the night</i>

13
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,312
# <i>And he's watchin' us all</i>
<i>in the eye of the tiger</i>

14
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,350
- Come on! We made a deal.
- I know, but it's extremely crazy.

15
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,790
It's mentally irregular, but
it makes all the sense in the world.

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,514
- You owe me a favour.
- I know, but...

17
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,791
- When did you think of this?
- About three years ago.

18
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,516
- This is very crazy, Apollo.
- Stallion, when you won that last fight,

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,074
you won by one second.
You beat me by one second.

20
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,953
That's very hard for a man
of my intelligence to handle.

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,753
Didn't you say you learned
how to live with it?

22
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,836
- I lied.
- Oh, you lied?

23
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,077
Oh! So now you just gotta
prove it to yourself, right?

24
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,158
Just for myself. No TV,
no newspapers - just you and me.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,794
Nothin' - just you and me.
Age before beauty.

26
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,310
- Anything you say.
- I do all the work. OK.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,558
I tell you, Apollo, you'd better go slow.
You ain't as young as springtime no more.

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,719
- I'm still young enough to whip <i>your</i> butt.
- Oh, yeah? How you gonna do that?

29
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,196
- You taught me everything you know.
- <i>Almost</i> everything.

30
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,677
You gotta remember: You fight great,
but <i>I'm</i> a great fighter. You ready?

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,716
- Absolutely.
- You know, Stallion,

32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,393
it's too bad we gotta get old, huh?

33
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,035
Oh, just keep punchin', Apollo.

34
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,157
- Wanna ring the bell?
- All right.

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,669
Ding, ding.

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,236
Come on, Stallion.

37
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,911
Come on, come on.

38
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,316
Boy, you really move
good for an older guy.

39
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,396
- Look at him fly.
- Look out now.

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,676
No, you don't want any of this.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,475
- Come on.
- Maybe I'm in here with the wrong guy.

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,798
Dad, you're late. Mom's gonna yell at you.

43
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,836
- So how you doin'?
- Fine.

44
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,679
You know, don't you think
that's a little bright?

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,394
- A little bit?
- Where'd you get that hat?

46
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,149
- A friend gave it to me. Like it?
- Who punched you in the eye?

47
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,748
- Same friend.
- That's weird. Better hurry, Dad.

48
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,952
You know, you're developin'
a very, very loud personality.

49
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,390
Don't go too fast,
or you're gonna get out of focus.

50
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,476
Oh, really?

51
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,596
- Yo!
- Yo. It's about time.

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,472
I'm sorry I'm late.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,070
- Why don't you go and get ready to eat?
- Great. You're here.

54
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,749
- Now you can stop calling him names.
- You been callin' me names?

55
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,348
We wait any longer,
it'll be my next birthday.

56
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,233
- Where have you been?
- Oh, gettin' punched.

57
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,397
Bring the cake in and we can
get this celebration under way.

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,557
- Boy, am I hungry.
- Baby, why don't you get the cake?

59
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,194
We got a great surprise.
You're gonna love this cake.

60
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,550
- And your present.
- Where is it?

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,195
Let me set the mood. I gotta turn
the lights down and everythin'.

62
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,550
- Watch this.
- Is it parked outside?

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
Just be patient, would ya?

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,113
I'm so excited, I'm startin' to sweat.

65
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,870
I feel like I'm gettin' ready to go into
a big fight or somethin'. Watch this.

66
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,195
<i>Happy birthday, Paulie.</i>

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,760
- What the hell is this?
- Your present.

68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,316
I wanted a sports car for my birthday,
not no walkin' trash can!

69
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,398
- Come on! He looks great.
- This is extremely psycho.

70
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,909
You have no friends,
so we thought you'd like it.

71
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,838
Pretend you're happy.
It'll keep you company.

72
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,474
- That's a great-lookin' guy.
<i>- Please make a wish.</i>

73
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,397
It's creepy! It talks!

74
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,478
Creepy? I wish I had one of these
when I was growin' up.

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,115
- Go on, make a wish, like he says.
- I wish I wasn't in this nightmare.

76
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,754
Very classy wish. What do you think?

77
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,312
Very good, huh?

78
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,670
You wanna help me
put out this forest fire?

79
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,997
- Sure.
- OK. On the count of three. One...

80
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,076
two... three!

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,752
- Well, they're out.
- You "drownded" me!

82
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,950
<i>Oh, don't worry.</i>
<i>I'll clean it up for you, Paulie.</i>

83
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,390
- Rocky!
- Yeah, you noticed.

84
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,875
What are you doing with that cake?

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,278
The party ain't over yet, you know.
We still gotta celebrate some more.

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,472
- It's a special night.
- Yeah, it's Wednesday.

87
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
It's Wednesday, but in case you forgot,

88
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,319
it's almost been nine years since
you've been married to me, so...

89
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,396
here's your prize.

90
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,230
- But our anniversary's a week away.
- That's true, but... why wait?

91
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,750
- Has it been that rough?
- No, no.

92
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,430
I tell you, it's been excellent.
Open your prize. Go on.

93
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,279
- Go on, open your prize.
- OK.

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,230
- Do you like it?
- It's beautiful.

95
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,555
All right!

96
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,877
I was so nervous. I didn't know.
I... I hope you like it.

97
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,597
The guy I bought it from says even if
it looks like a snake, don't worry,

98
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,995
cos it won't bite you.

99
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,750
It's beautiful.

100
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,270
You know what's amazing?

101
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,552
That after all these years,
everything still seems kinda new.

102
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,996
You remember a long time ago
I told you that...

103
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,352
I said that you ain't never
gettin' rid of me. Remember that?

104
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,589
Well, you're not.

105
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,075
You're never gettin' rid of me.

106
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,476
Happy "almost anniversary".

107
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,513
- A few questions, please.
- How long are you here for?

108
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,154
- We talk later.
- When are you gonna fight, Drago?

109
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,793
We talk later.

110
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,152
Is it definite that the Soviet Union
will enter professional boxing?

111
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,716
No more talk now.
We will talk at press conference.

112
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,231
# <i>Oh, golden dishes</i>
<i>from Church's and catfish at Church's</i>

113
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,716
# <i>Have some catfish from</i>
<i>Church's Fried Chicken</i>

114
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,195
# <i>Catfish from Church's!</i>

115
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,514
<i>Today may be a landmark</i>
<i>in sports history.</i>

116
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,679
<i>After unravelling years of red tape,</i>
<i>Russia will throw its hat into the ring -</i>

117
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,873
<i>the prize ring. The introductions were</i>
<i>made by his wife, Ludmilla Vobet Drago -</i>

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,831
<i>gold medallist in swimming.</i>

119
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,839
<i>Today the Soviet Union has officially</i>
<i>entered professional boxing.</i>

120
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,033
<i>My husband and great undefeated</i>
<i>heavyweight world amateur champion,</i>

121
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,994
<i>Captain lvan Drago, has come here</i>
<i>with his trainers to America</i>

122
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,352
<i>to compete as an international</i>
<i>sportsman and ambassador of goodwill.</i>

123
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,789
<i>Has he boxed against a professional?</i>

124
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,516
<i>From having been trained in Russia</i>
<i>by great boxing coach Manuel Vega,</i>

125
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,599
<i>and now by Sergei Rimsky,</i>
<i>we hope he's qualified to do so.</i>

126
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,790
<i>- Hope?</i>
<i>- Well, I know he is,</i>

127
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,878
<i>but I don't want to sound too confident.</i>

128
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,790
<i>We would like an exhibition bout with</i>
<i>your famous champion, Rocky Balboa.</i>

129
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,151
<i>You think he can fight</i>
<i>someone as seasoned as Balboa?</i>

130
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,319
<i>There is no one who can match his</i>
<i>strength, endurance or aggressiveness.</i>

131
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,590
<i>You make him sound indestructible.</i>

132
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,438
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

133
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,519
<i>Can this mammoth Russian,</i>
<i>nicknamed the Siberian Express,</i>

134
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,598
<i>wreak havoc among</i>
<i>the professional heavyweight ranks?</i>

135
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,757
<i>Whoever he fights first,</i>
<i>it'll be one hot ticket.</i>

136
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,509
<i>We'll be right back with a check on</i>
<i>today's pro football sports scoreboard.</i>

137
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,676
Dad, when can I learn to fight?

138
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,951
- I can't hear you. What?
- I wanna learn to fight.

139
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,840
Yo. Could you turn your robot down?

140
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,712
You see, I fight so you don't have to fight.

141
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,277
I want you to use your head for somethin'
instead of a punchin' bag, like I do.

142
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,517
Your head doesn't look
like a punching bag.

143
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,393
No? That's nice. Thanks a lot.

144
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,670
It looks like a catcher's mitt!

145
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,598
Oh! A wise guy, huh?

146
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,190
Mr Balboa! Mr Creed's on the phone.

147
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,717
- Yeah? I'll be right there.
<i>- You can get it right here.</i>

148
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,799
- I hope it's not another rematch.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

149
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,673
Hello? Yeah, Apollo... Turn that down.

150
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,510
Apollo, how ya doin'? Yeah?
You're comin' out? That's great.

151
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,598
What am <i>I</i> doin'? I'm just gettin' dizzy.

152
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,478
My husband and I thank you for
coming to our training quarter today.

153
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,673
As you can see, it is highly advanced,
and we wish to show the American press

154
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,110
a small portion of the advances
our country has made

155
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,390
in the technology of human performance.

156
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,751
Coach Rimsky, what does this do
to enhance performance?

157
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,836
- Well...
- If I may answer.

158
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,517
It makes a man a better man,

159
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,031
a great athlete a superathlete,
by harnessing all his strength.

160
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,118
Though most of the world is
ignorant in body chemistry,

161
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,791
- we wish to... educate your country.
- There have been rumours of doping,

162
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,833
and widespread distribution of
anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union.

163
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,636
- Has Drago partaken in any experiments?
- No! Lvan is naturally trained.

164
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,718
Then how do you explain
his... freakish strength?

165
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,037
Like your Popeye,
he ate his spinach every day.

166
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,112
- Shall we have a demonstration?
- Please do.

167
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,958
A normal heavyweight averages
700 pounds of pressure per square inch.

168
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:53,116
As you can see,
Drago averages 1850 pounds.

169
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,910
- So the result's quite obvious.
- And what results are those?

170
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,838
Whatever he hits, he destroys.

171
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,670
I've seen Drago fight when he was an
amateur. He's big and strong, but clumsy.

172
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,155
I know I can beat him.

173
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,637
- Why do you wanna fight again?
- Let's just say it's somethin' <i>I</i> believe in.

174
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,830
- You can do your homework.
- OK. Later, Dad. Later, Uncle Paulie.

175
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,916
- Later, Apollo.
- Later, big man.

176
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,157
See you later, kiddo.
Don't you think people are expectin'

177
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,513
- to see Rocky whack this bum out first?
- Yeah. And he will, when it's for real.

178
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,950
- This is an exhibition bout. Kids' stuff.
- What's the purpose?

179
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,119
What at this point in your life
is worth getting hurt for?

180
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,676
# <i>Double or nothin',</i>
<i>you've gotta have a partner...</i>

181
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,360
- What the hell is that?
- That's my girl.

182
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,431
# <i>Takin' and givin',</i>
<i>it's time we started livin'...</i>

183
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,274
- Thanks, honey.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

184
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,029
- That's a nice song.
<i>- It's my favourite. You're the greatest.</i>

185
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,675
<i>See you, sport.</i>

186
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,031
- See you.
- Paulie, who taught it to talk like that?

187
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,876
She loves me.

188
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,117
# <i>You stepped out of the night...</i>

189
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,514
Like I was sayin', I don't want this chump
to come over here with all that hype,

190
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,518
tryin' to make us look bad.
They try every other way.

191
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,111
With Rock's help, we can get great
media coverage. We make <i>them</i> look bad.

192
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,357
- I think it's wrong.
- No. It's never been more right.

193
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,517
You're a great fighter,
but you've been retired five years.

194
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,234
Isn't it time to start
thinking about something else?

195
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,272
How much can you take? Either of you?

196
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,556
I'll... get the coffee.

197
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,598
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

198
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,075
I just care about you both. I...

199
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,035
You ever try these comics?

200
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,073
- No, no.
- Keeps your fertility.

201
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,599
Hey, Paulie.

202
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,032
<i>In the ring now... Rocky's holding that</i>
<i>right hand. He's fighting right-handed!</i>

203
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,390
Oh, now this was a great fight.

204
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,193
Great! I'm gettin' punchy just watchin' it!

205
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,756
<i>Mamma mia!</i> What you usin'
for a chin there, Stallion?

206
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,355
- I should've slipped that one.
- You definitely should've slipped that.

207
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,349
It's crazy how people just care about you
in that ring and when you're bleedin',

208
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,119
but once you step out,
you're ancient history.

209
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,117
It ain't ancient history.

210
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,789
I don't see anybody askin'
for autographs, do you?

211
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,959
Hey, Apollo... Can I... ask you somethin'?

212
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,159
What?

213
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,671
Well, this fight you're havin' against
the Russian. Do you think maybe...

214
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,756
it ain't against him?

215
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,955
If it's not him, Stallion,
then who's it against?

216
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,995
Well, do you think maybe it's, like...
you against you? What do you think?

217
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,396
You know, I think you really
<i>are</i> gettin' brain-damaged.

218
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,308
Maybe, but... really.
I'm speakin' the truth here, Apollo.

219
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,000
- Are you?
- Yeah.

220
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,753
- I don't think I wanna hear this, Stallion.
- Hey, Apollo, you were a great fighter,

221
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,633
but, look, we gotta face the facts too.

222
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,399
You don't wanna believe it,
but maybe the show is over.

223
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,512
That's easy for you to say.
You're still on top.

224
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,234
What happens when
you're not on top? Then what?

225
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,955
Where do we go, Stallion?
Cos we sure as hell can't be born again.

226
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,915
I know we can't be born again, but, let's
face it, we... we gotta change sometime.

227
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,474
I don't wanna change! I like who I am!

228
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,353
I like who you are, too, but look at that.

229
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,153
That ain't us up there no more, Apollo.

230
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,033
We can't do that the way we did it before.

231
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,709
We're changin'. We're, like,
turnin' into regular people.

232
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,912
No, Stallion!
Maybe you <i>think</i> you're changin'.

233
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,068
But you can't change what you really are.
You can forget all this money and stuff.

234
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,156
Cos it don't change a thing.

235
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,114
You and me, we don't even have a choice.

236
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,553
We're born with a killer instinct that you
can't just turn off and on like some radio.

237
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,355
We <i>have</i> to be right in the middle of
the action, cos we're the warriors.

238
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,153
Without some challenge,
some damn war to fight,

239
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,636
then the warrior may
as well be dead, Stallion.

240
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,636
So I'm askin' you,

241
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,796
as a friend,

242
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,152
stand by my side this one last time.

243
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,355
You're a great talker, Apollo.

244
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,952
All right, but... when this is over...?

245
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,070
You know me, Stallion.

246
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,555
I always think of somethin' else.

247
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,919
That's what I'm afraid of.
All right. You got a deal there.

248
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,634
I feel sorry for that guy, you know?

249
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,790
What made you decide to put on
an exhibition fight with Drago?

250
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,593
Let's call it a sense of responsibility.

251
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,676
Responsibility, how?

252
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,156
I had to teach this young fella
to box - American style!

253
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,192
Isn't Drago a little inexperienced
to be in the same ring?

254
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,790
Well, you know, some folks
got to learn the hard way!

255
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,470
- No quick knockout predictions?
- No. I'm not angry with him.

256
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,230
I just wanna show the whole world that
Russia doesn't have all the best athletes.

257
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,557
Rocky, how do you think
Apollo should fight Drago?

258
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,879
Well, personally, I think the first thing
you'd better get Apollo is a ladder.

259
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,237
Drago, how does it feel to spar
with the great former champion?

260
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,275
The man's tongue didn't
come through customs.

261
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,160
My husband is very happy
to have this opportunity.

262
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,953
- It's his dream.
- Dream? How do you mean?

263
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,959
In our country, Apollo Creed is
well known and very respected.

264
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,471
- It could be a good victory.
- Whoa! Wait a minute, now. Hold it.

265
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,355
When? Now you don't really think
you're gonna whip me, do ya?

266
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,189
- Well, he didn't come here to lose.
- You hold on, little lady.

267
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,756
- Lose, and lose royally, he's gonna do.
- How can you be so sure?

268
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,954
I've been with the best. I beat the best.
I retired more men than Social Security!

269
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,755
Excuse, please. You are not
very realistic, are you, Mr Creed?

270
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,791
What are <i>you</i> talkin' about?

271
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,629
You can box, yes, but you are far too
old to think you can win over Drago.

272
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,957
- Is that a fact?
- Yes! And it could be a painful one!

273
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,516
Put that heavy bag with eyeballs
in the ring with me and <i>you'll</i> see pain!

274
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,552
- Why do you insult us?
- Now you just hold on here.

275
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,195
I'm not the bad guy. I came to talk
about a friendly exhibition bout

276
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,154
- till Comrade Bigmouth started up!
- It is <i>you</i> who are the aggressor.

277
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,999
I wish to say to the press, in all fairness,

278
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,590
Drago should not even fight this man,
because he is a has-been.

279
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,871
You get that big chump
in the ring right now...

280
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,637
- Stop this before you get hurt.
- I don't wanna hear! Let that chump go!

281
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,995
All right, all right. I've said what I feel.

282
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,714
- We'll finish this in the ring!
- Wherever you like.

283
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,470
You shut up, and all these puppets you
brought with you! You're history, chump!

284
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,750
- How did I do?
- A little loud for me.

285
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,950
- But good?
- Oh, yeah. Very good.

286
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,717
<i>Welcome to the City of Lights -</i>
<i>Las Vegas -</i>

287
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,719
<i>and to one of the most unusual</i>
<i>events in years: East meets West.</i>

288
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,476
<i>Age versus youth in</i>
<i>a goodwill exhibition match,</i>

289
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,229
<i>as the former champion Apollo Creed</i>
<i>takes on a mountain of muscle</i>

290
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,318
<i>from the Soviet Union: Lvan Drago.</i>

291
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,271
- Come on.
- Patience is a virtue.

292
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,076
- I'm ready to rock 'n' roll.
- You gotta get your equipment.

293
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,794
- Now you look like a mummy.
- I feel like a mummy.

294
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,117
- How does it feel? OK?
- Feels great. I feel like I could eat nails.

295
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,471
- I never tried them snails.
- What are you talkin' about?

296
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,388
Snails. I never had 'em. I see 'em in
the garden, but I never want to eat 'em.

297
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,833
I didn't say anythin' about snails.
I said nails. N-N-Nails, Stallion!

298
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,679
You look pretty good, but, you know,

299
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,268
just do me a favour when you go up there.

300
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,871
- Try not to wear yourself out, OK?
- Yeah, wear myself out. Sure.

301
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,117
Well, it's just that you ain't
been in the ring for five years.

302
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,950
- I just want you to... maintain a little bit.
- I'm in the best shape of my life.

303
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,232
- I'm stronger, I'm quicker...
- Hey, I'm not sayin' you're not ready,

304
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,874
but personally, if it were me,

305
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,231
I wouldn't mind postponin'
a couple of weeks.

306
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,237
Postpone?

307
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,831
Come on, Apollo. We don't know anythin'
about this guy you're fightin', really.

308
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,273
Let's say I postpone. I pull out, somebody
else steps in and whips this chump.

309
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,154
- Then where does that leave me?
- This is just some kind of exhibition fight.

310
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,909
- This thing don't mean nothin'.
- No, man. That's where you're wrong.

311
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,191
This is <i>not</i> just an exhibition fight
that doesn't mean anything.

312
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,871
This is us against them.
What are you talkin' about? Come on!

313
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,956
Stallion...

314
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,757
Maybe you don't know what I'm talkin'
about now, but you will when it's over.

315
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,837
Believe me, you will when it's over.

316
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,031
Ivan!

317
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,357
Good luck. I hope after we can be friends.

318
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,593
- I hope so.
- Of course. They're sportsmen,

319
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,551
not soldiers.

320
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,396
Enjoy the fight.

321
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,475
# Ow! Get up!

322
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,630
# Knock it out! Dig!

323
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,272
# Hit it!

324
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,432
# Hit it!

325
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,276
# Superhighways

326
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,436
# Coast to coast

327
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,994
# Easy to get anywhere

328
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,475
# On the transcontinental overload

329
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,316
# Just slide behind the wheel

330
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,234
- # How does it feel?
- # When there's no destination

331
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,316
# That's too far

332
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,718
# And somewhere on the way
you might find out who you are, wow!

333
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,035
# Livin' in America

334
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,551
# Eye to eye

335
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,671
# Station to station

336
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,995
# Livin' in America

337
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,877
# Hand to hand, across the nation

338
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,355
# Livin' in America

339
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,916
# Got to have a celebration

340
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,835
# You may not be lookin'
for the Promised Land

341
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,474
# But you might find it anyway

342
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,551
# Under one of those old familiar names

343
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,910
- # Like New Orleans
- # New Orleans!

344
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,156
- # Detroit City
- # Detroit City!

345
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,191
- # Dallas
- # Dallas!

346
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,276
- # Pittsburgh PA
- # Pittsburgh PA!

347
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,231
- # New York City
- # New York City!

348
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,032
- # Kansas City
- # Kansas City!

349
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,752
- # Atlanta, yeah!
- # Atlanta!

350
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,030
# Chicago and LA

351
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,755
# I live in America

352
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,311
# Head to head

353
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,431
# Toe to toe

354
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,711
# I live in America

355
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,032
# Say it loud

356
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,310
# lt'll make you proud

357
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,194
# I live in America

358
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,279
# Hey, I know what it means

359
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,551
# Livin' in America

360
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,309
# Got it made! I said now,
eye to eye, tooth to tooth

361
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,510
# This is undisputed truth

362
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,473
- # Livin' in America
- # Yeah!

363
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,476
# All the way with your bad self

364
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,797
- # Livin' in America
- # Yeah!

365
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,715
# I feel good!

366
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,158
Good evening. Along with
Warner Wolf, I am Stu Nahan.

367
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,352
We welcome you to an unusual
event: For the first time ever,

368
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,948
West against East in professional sports.

369
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,389
Thanks for gettin' me here. I owe you one.

370
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,398
- Oh, no, no. We're even.
- God, I feel born again.

371
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,717
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!

372
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,072
I would like to announce the presence
of a true fighting champion

373
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,350
that defines the word "courage".

374
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,916
The Italian Stallion: Rocky Balboa!

375
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,034
- Excuse me, would you?
- Certainly.

376
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,596
Rocky!

377
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,314
Tonight's special event
features two great athletes.

378
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,989
In the blue corner, weighing 221 pounds,

379
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,351
a former heavyweight
champion of the world,

380
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,914
the Dancing Destroyer,

381
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,110
the King of Sting,

382
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,708
the Count of Monte Fisto...

383
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,991
- Think you got enough names?
- Be patient. Almost done.

384
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,797
The Master of Disaster,
the one and only Apollo Creed!

385
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,150
The crowd anticipating a great fight now
as Apollo plays to the crowd.

386
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,160
In the red corner,
weighing an even 261 pounds,

387
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,432
gold medallist and undefeated
world amateur champion

388
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,074
from the Soviet Union,

389
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,156
the Siberian Bull,

390
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,390
lvan Drago!

391
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,152
I want you! I want <i>you!</i> I want <i>you!</i>

392
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,876
The two fighters come to the centre
for instructions from referee Lou Filippo.

393
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,357
You know the rules. Watch the low blows,
kidney punches and rabbit punches.

394
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,871
In case of a knockdown, go to the corner
and stay there until I tell you to come out.

395
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,391
- Shake hands. Let's have a good fight.
- It's time to go to school, son.

396
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,548
Get your hands up! Do you need an
interpreter? It's time to go to school!

397
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,035
You will lose.

398
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,711
All right!

399
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,196
The bad blood between these two
can be felt all over this arena.

400
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,198
I can't get over the size of this Russian!

401
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,557
- Apollo! Apollo!
- Get ready, cos it's showtime! Showtime!

402
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,800
- It's showtime!
- Excuse me. Didn't you forget somethin'?

403
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,036
Apollo seems to be in great spirits.

404
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,073
He's really putting on a show
for this capacity crowd.

405
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,553
Be back in a minute, all right?

406
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,711
Round one.

407
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,432
Creed's dancing around.

408
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,075
Creed back-pedalling now.
He's been away five years.

409
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,713
Neither fighter ready to throw a punch.
A left jab there... and once again.

410
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,800
- A slip by Creed.
- This is bizarre.

411
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,311
Creed is over the hill, and...
the Russian hasn't fought anybody.

412
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,838
- Keep movin'. Stick him!
- Drago's moving in again.

413
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,272
A left hand by Creed. Another left hand
by Creed, and Drago moves away.

414
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,830
Another left hand by Creed. Drago
waiting, waiting, cocking that right hand.

415
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,149
A punishing right by the Russian.

416
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,033
Get outta there! Get outta there!

417
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,199
A left. He's taking some punishment now.
Drago moves him against the ropes.

418
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,469
Tie him up now!

419
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,229
The Russian ties him up
and throws Creed across the ring!

420
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,351
Move!

421
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,637
It is Drago with the upper hand now.

422
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,591
Get outta that corner!

423
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,188
Another right! Another right!

424
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,113
Creed is against the ropes!
I think they may stop it.

425
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,837
What are you guys doin'?!
This is supposed to be an exhibition!

426
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,910
Tremendous end to the first round by the
Russian, and a very bloody Apollo Creed.

427
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,470
The Soviet's strength is incredible!

428
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,798
Champ, look. I gotta stop ya.
This fight's finished. I gotta call it.

429
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,673
- You can't do no more.
- I'm here to fight him.

430
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,510
- He's killin' ya! I gotta stop this thing.
- Promise me you're not gonna stop it.

431
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,030
That was a pulverising round
for the ex-champion.

432
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,039
Hey, folks. Ivan Drago is definitely for real.

433
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,312
You don't stop this fight, no matter what.

434
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,396
Apollo! Apollo!

435
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,316
No matter what.

436
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,913
Creed now comes out
for round two dancing around.

437
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,838
The legs appear to be still a little rubbery.

438
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,349
Get your hands up.

439
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,796
And now it is the Russian just standing
there, trying to intimidate Creed.

440
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,634
And the Russian throws a right hand
to the jaw! Another right to the head!

441
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,239
Creed's being pounded without mercy!

442
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,476
Stop the fight!

443
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,196
- The referee is thrown across the ring!
- Throw the towel! Throw the towel!

444
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,350
- I've never seen Apollo take so much.
- Throw the damn towel!

445
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,394
No!

446
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,873
- My God!
- Creed is down!

447
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,632
Apollo is down,
and he could be badly hurt.

448
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,351
- Get these guys outta here.
- The winner, lvan Drago.

449
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,155
- Let me through! Apollo!
- I cannot be defeated.

450
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,589
- Is he OK?
- Somebody get a doctor in here!

451
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,952
- There is no movement by Creed.
- I defeat old man.

452
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,911
- Is he dead?
- Get outta here!

453
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,031
It's absolute pandemonium!

454
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,349
Will ya let him breathe?

455
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,597
Soon... I defeat real champion.

456
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,156
Where's the stretcher?
Let him breathe, for God's sake!

457
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,670
What started out as a joke
has turned out to be a disaster.

458
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,950
Creed is in a very serious condition.

459
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,310
- Is the man alive?
- You can make it, Apollo.

460
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,635
If he dies... he dies.

461
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,150
There's a lot I could say... about this man.

462
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,754
But I don't know if it matters now.

463
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,949
I guess what matters is...

464
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,435
what he stood for,

465
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,835
what he lived for, and...

466
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,469
what he died for.

467
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,675
You always did everything...

468
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,635
the way <i>you</i> wanted it.

469
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,438
I know I didn't understand that, but...

470
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,118
now I understand.

471
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,435
I'll never forget you, Apollo.

472
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,597
You're the best.

473
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,511
- Rocky, is the decision final?
- Yes.

474
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,110
Is this the first time
the champion has given up his crown?

475
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,596
- I don't know about that.
- Doesn't the title matter?

476
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,870
Not until this is over.

477
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,118
Considering Rocky's punching power,
do you still expect an easy fight?

478
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,357
- Yes, of course.
- It's a matter of size...

479
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,554
and evolution. Isn't it, gentlemen? Drago
is the most perfectly trained athlete ever.

480
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,515
This other man has not the size,
or the endurance, or the genetics to win.

481
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,155
It's physically impossible
for this little man to win.

482
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,397
Drago is a look at the future.

483
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,672
Champ, how much
are you making for this fight?

484
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,713
- No money. It's not about money.
- Has the fight date been set yet?

485
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,400
- December 25th.
- Why Christmas?

486
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,829
- That's what I was told.
- Where?

487
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,996
- It's in Russia.
- Are you nuts?

488
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,475
Rocky, what's going on?

489
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,910
We fight in Soviet Union,
or we fight nowhere.

490
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,199
Why don't you ask Drago's wife
why she is afraid? Tell them, please.

491
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,314
I'm afraid for my husband's life.
We have threats of violence everywhere.

492
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,037
We are not in politics. All I want is for my
husband to be safe, to be treated fairly.

493
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,438
You call him a killer.
He's a professional fighter, not a killer.

494
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,836
You have this belief that
you are better than us,

495
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,794
that this country is so very good,
and we are so very bad.

496
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,749
You have this belief that you are so fair,
and we are so very cruel.

497
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,871
It is lies and false propaganda

498
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,039
to support this antagonistic
and violent government!

499
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,076
Violent? We don't keep our people
behind a wall with machine guns!

500
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,395
- Who are you?
- Who am <i>I?</i>

501
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,832
- I'm... the unsilent majority, bigmouth!
- Good! Yes, good!

502
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,988
Insult us! Is more typical rude behaviour
towards visiting foreigners!

503
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,432
But perhaps this simple defeat
of this little so-called champion

504
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,389
will be a perfect example
of how pathetically weak

505
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,478
your society has become. We go!

506
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,799
Mrs Balboa!

507
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,151
- How do you feel about Russia?
- Is your husband going to Moscow?

508
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,035
How does it feel to be part of
such a controversial decision?

509
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,674
Did Creed's death
make up your husband's mind?

510
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,476
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Why is he going at Christmas?

511
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,670
When will you be going to Russia?

512
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,713
I'm not going to Russia. I don't know
what you're talking about!

513
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,752
I don't know what you
people are doing here!

514
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,756
- Rocky?
- Yeah?

515
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,994
- You all right?
- Yeah.

516
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,872
Fine.

517
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,956
Why'd you do it?

518
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,157
- I just gotta do what I gotta do.
- You don't have to do anything.

519
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,431
No, Adrian, I do, and...
I gotta leave this place, too.

520
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,915
So where are you... going?

521
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,430
They said they were gonna
let me train in Russia.

522
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,588
I just wanna go someplace where I ain't
gonna think about nothin' except him.

523
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,508
Rocky, give it some time. Don't do this.

524
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,710
A lot of people live with hurt.

525
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,559
A lot of people don't have a choice. I do.

526
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,831
And for that you're willing
to lose everything?

527
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,315
Adrian, this ain't everything.

528
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,116
This house, and the cars, and all
the stuff we got... that ain't everything.

529
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,154
There's a lot more than this, Adrian.

530
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,159
Before, there were reasons to fight I
understood, but I don't understand this.

531
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,829
Even if you win, what have you won?
Apollo's still gone.

532
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,432
Why can't you change your thinking?
Everybody else does!

533
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,235
Cos I'm a fighter!
That's the way I'm made, Adrian.

534
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,109
That's what you married.
We can't change what we are.

535
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,198
- Yes, you can.
- You can't change anythin'.

536
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,233
- All we can do is go with what we are.
- You can't go with what you are!

537
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,670
Have you read the papers?
Do you know what everybody says?

538
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,952
It's suicide! You've seen him.
You know how strong he is.

539
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,516
You can't win!

540
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,996
Oh, Adrian.

541
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,235
Adrian always tells the truth.

542
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,956
No, maybe I can't win.

543
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,395
Maybe the only thing I can do...

544
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,278
is just take everythin' he's got.

545
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,029
But to beat me...
he's gonna have to kill me.

546
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,519
And to kill me, he's gonna have to
have the heart to stand in front of me.

547
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,471
And to do that, he's gotta
be willin' to die himself.

548
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,872
And I don't know if he's ready to do that.

549
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,956
I don't know.

550
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,313
# <i>We're not indestructible</i>

551
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,158

552
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,717

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,231

554
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,508

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,356

557
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,036

558
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,549
# <i>There's no easy way out</i>

559
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,394

00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,113

565
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,950

566
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,757

00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,958

00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,557

569
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,237

00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,556

# <i>We can know how we feel inside</i>

576
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,550

00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,310

<i>Be careful with those plaid ones.</i>
<i>They belong to the boss.</i>

598
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,437
<i>Paulie, did you pack your toothbrush?</i>
<i>You know how tobacco stains your teeth.</i>

599
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,870
<i>- If I've told you once, I've told you...</i>
- Hey! Hey!

600
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,470
- Stop bustin' my chops.
<i>- Paulie!</i>

601
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,354
I'm gonna have her wires
tied when I get back.

602
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,828
When will you be back?

603
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,315
- Oh, pretty soon.
- Are you scared?

604
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,917
- Nah.
- Yes, you are. A little, maybe?

605
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,836
Well, wouldn't you be?

606
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,238
If a big giant man wanted to
beat <i>me</i> up, I'd be real scared.

607
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,918
Well, the truth is, you know, sometimes...

608
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,998
I do get a little scared, you know.

609
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,396
When I'm in that ring
and I'm really gettin' hit on,

610
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,274
and my arms hurt so much I can't
even lift them, and I'm thinkin',

611
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,077
"God! I wish this guy would hit me on
the chin so I don't feel nothin' any more."

612
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,791
Then there's another side that
comes out that isn't so scared.

613
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,435
There's another side that, like,

614
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,952
wants to take more, that wants
to go that one more round,

615
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,029
because by goin' that one more round
when you don't think you can,

616
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,399
that's what makes all the difference
in your life. You know what I mean?

617
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,033
And will you remember one more thing?

618
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,548
Will you remember that... Daddy thinks
you're the best boy in the world, hm?

619
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,638
And that Daddy loves you...
no matter what?

620
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,716
Will you?

621
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,315
I gotta go now.

622
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,238
- You gonna take care of everythin'?
- OK.

623
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,876
And don't forget to feed your robot.

624
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,076
Bye, baby.

625
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,796
Good luck.

626
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,470
Thanks.

627
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,319
Come on! The meter's runnin'!

628
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,993
# <i>Two worlds collide, rival nations</i>

629
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:39,434

<i>venting years of frustration</i>

630
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,950
# <i>Bravely we hope against all hope</i>

631
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,916

00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,749
# <i>Seems our freedom's</i>

633
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,235
# <i>Does the crowd understand?</i>

634
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,510
# <i>Is it East versus West</i>

635
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,870
# <i>Or man against man?</i>

636
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,232
# <i>Can any nation stand alone?</i>

637
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,435
# <i>In the burning heart</i>

638
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,676
# <i>Just about to burst</i>

639
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,396
# <i>There's a quest for answers,</i>

640

# <i>In the darkest night...</i>

641
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,636
What a horrendous flight.

642
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,877
This is Russia?
It don't look so tough, Rock.

643
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,750
Mr Balboa.

644
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,113
We take you to quarters now.

645
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,358
Hey, when does the sun come up?
This is detrimental to my sinuses.

646
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,151
Weather changes, hour to hour.
Get used to it.

647
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,229
Get in car now. We have very long trip.

648
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,715
He sounds like Dracula's cousin.

649
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,035
# <i>In the warrior's code</i>
<i>there's no surrender</i>

650
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:19,114
# <i>Though his body says "Stop",</i>
<i>his spirit cries "Never!"</i>

651
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,596
# <i>Deep in our soul a quiet ember</i>

652
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,196
# <i>Knows it's you against you</i>

653
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,389
# <i>It's the paradox that drives us on</i>

654
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,750
# <i>It's a battle of wills</i>

655
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,510
# <i>In the heat of attack,</i>
<i>it's the passion that kills</i>

656
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,952
# <i>That victory is yours alone</i>

657
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,189
# <i>In the burning heart</i>

658
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,436
# <i>Just about to burst</i>

659
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,076
# <i>There's a quest for answers,</i>
<i>an unquenchable thirst</i>

660
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,751
# <i>In the darkest night, rising like a spire</i>

661
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,556
# <i>In the burning heart,</i>
<i>the unmistakable fire</i>

662
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,789
Like you requested, yes?

663
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,593
- You requested this dumb location?
- Yeah.

664
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,357
Why? You plannin' to grow
reindeer or somethin'?

665
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,438
- I just wanted to get away from things.
- The equipment you requested is in barn.

666
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,193
- Who are they?
- They?

667
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,993
They are assigned to you.

668
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,680
Official chaperons, yes?

669
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,995
Where you go, they go.

670
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,150
Oh, I have a bad dream here.

671
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,272
- Paul, it's OK.
- OK? This is below human standards.

672
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,632
There's no antennas. You gotta
complain. We'll crack out here!

673
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,957
You have everything
I have been instructed to provide.

674
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,153
We are finished, yes? <i>Da svidaniya.</i>

675
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,676
No sparrin'?

676
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,352
I don't think I need it any more, Paulie.

677
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,789
No sparrin', no TV, nothin'?

678
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,192
How the heck is he supposed
to train around here?

679
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,433
No TV. What about the Rose Bowl game?

680
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,719
No room service, I bet.
I hope they got my comics here.

681
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,229
What a depressing vacation.

682
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,316
Goddamn!

683
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,396
<i>All right, you Chipmunks.</i>
<i>Ready to sing your song?</i>

684
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,308
# <i>Christmas, Christmastime is here</i>

685
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,152
# <i>Time for toys and time for cheer</i>

686
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,478
# <i>We've been good, but we can't last...</i>

687
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,160
Checkmate, friend.

688
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,078
- Yeah?
- Hey, champ. Can I come up?

689
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,156
Yeah, sure.

690
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,590
- How you doin'?
- Pretty good.

691
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,793
- Some kinda weather we're havin', huh?
- Yeah, it's pretty rough.

692
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,480
But for what you gotta do, it's good.

693
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,793
- Toughen you up.
- I guess so.

694
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,311
I know you're gonna have to do almost
everything alone, but I'll be with you.

695
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,396
Yeah, I know.

696
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,398
Apollo was like my son.

697
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,954
I raised him.

698
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,548
And when he died... a part of me died.

699
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,279
But now... <i>you're</i> the one.

700
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,552
You're the one that's gonna keep
his spirit alive. You're the one...

701
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,639
that's gonna make sure
that he didn't die for nothing.

702
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,638
Now you're gonna have
to go through hell,

703
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,797
worse than any nightmare
that you ever dreamed.

704
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,835
But in the end...
I know you'll be the one standin'.

705
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,516
I'll try.

706
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,396
I'll try.

707
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,276
You know what you gotta do.

708
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,635
Do it.

709
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,996
Do it!

710
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,076
Thanks, Duke.

711
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,675
I couldn't stay away any more.

712
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,395
I missed you.

713
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,080
I missed <i>you.</i>

714
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,513
I'm with you, no matter what.

715
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,756
No matter what?

716
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,430
No matter what.

717
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,318
# <i>Silent darkness creeps into your soul</i>

718
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,117
# <i>And removes the light of self-control</i>

719
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,951
# <i>The cage that holds</i>
<i>you captive has no doors</i>

720
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,512
# <i>Burnin' with determination</i>

721
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,200
# <i>To even out the score</i>

722
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,435
# <i>Heart's on fire</i>

723
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,950
# <i>Strong desire</i>

724
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,039
# <i>Rages deep within</i>

725
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,677
# <i>Heart's on fire</i>

726
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,715
# <i>Fever's risin' high</i>

727
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,835
# <i>The moment of truth is here</i>

728
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,316
# <i>Oh!</i>

729
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,879
No pain. No pain.

730
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,757
# <i>Heart's on fire</i>

731
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,589

# <i>Energisin'</i>

735
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,714
# <i>Fight until the end</i>

736
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,792
# <i>Heart's on fire</i>

737
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,435
# <i>Strong desire</i>

# <i>Rages deep within</i>

739
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,595
Drago!

740
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,677
Drago!

741
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,837
Drago!

742
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,478
Hello, and merry Christmas
from a very unusual place.

743
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,639
We're in Moscow. I'm Barry Tompkins,
along with Al Bandiero,

744
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,548
and this promises to be the most
watched event in boxing history.

745
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,629
The Iron Horse from America, Rocky
Balboa, comes here to the Soviet Union...

746
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:56,750
Ivan Drago: Since that tragedy in Las
Vegas and the death of Apollo Creed,

747
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,872
he's been re-nicknamed
"Death from Above".

748
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,120
Drago! Drago!

749
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,553
The general secretary of the Soviet
and other members of the Politburo

750
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,435
have now made their way to their seats
high above the ring here in Moscow.

751
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:49,036
I know you're kinda busy, but I wanna
tell you some things I never told you.

752
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:54,029
I know sometimes I act stupid and I say
stupid things, but you kept me around

753
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,119
when other people would've said
"Drop that bum." You give me respect.

754
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,949
It's hard for me to say these kinda
things because that ain't my way,

755
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:07,234
but if I could unzip myself and step out
and be someone else, I'd wanna be you.

756
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,316
You're all heart, Rock.

757
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,876
Thanks, Paulie.

758
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,070
Now blast this guy's teeth out!

759
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,708
I'll try.

760
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,437
One of the fighters is starting to make his
way through this crowd toward the ring.

761
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,712
- Listen to this crowd!
- This borders on pure hatred.

762
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:47,516
Rocky's face: Absolutely like stone,
a picture of concentration,

763
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,677
and the booing crowd here does
not seem to bother him one bit.

764
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,360
The champ has a look that
could burn through lead.

765
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,109
It seems the booing crowd has
absolutely no effect on the man.

766
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,231
His concentration is like stone.

767
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,635
- That's my dad.
- We know.

768
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,035
What do you think we are - nerds?

769
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,993
Listen to this crowd. It sounds insane.

770
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,034
And now the entrance
of the Russian national champion.

771
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,472
Ivan Drago, a man with
an entire country in his corner.

772
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,838
Look at the expression
on the face of lvan Drago.

773
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,997
He seems impervious
to this madness of the crowd.

774
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,873
He's like a volcano just waiting to erupt.

775
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,516
The Russian is cool
as he acknowledges his premier.

776
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:32,073
I would like to point out again,
this is a non-sanctioned fight.

777
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:37,479
This is not for the title. The American
Boxing Commission has not sanctioned it.

778
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,796
Ladies and gentlemen...

779
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,078
Rocky Balboa!

780
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:29,389
It's unbelievable.
I have never seen such a hostile crowd.

781
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,557
Ivan Drago!

782
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:54,720
Roaring for their champion!
The two men are walking to the centre.

783
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,752
It's an unbelievable sight to see.

784
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,836
They're toe to toe.

785
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,750
The Russian towers above the American.
It's a true case of David and Goliath here.

786
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,589
It's unbelievable, the...
the condition of both men.

787
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,990
I must break you.

788
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,436
Remember what I said
about wanting to be you?

789
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,516
Forget it.

790
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,396
Thanks, Paul.

791
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,755
Take it straight to him, and be
a rock for me, you understand?

792
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,555
Be a rock for me! Be strong!
All right? Take it to him! No pain.

793
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,990
- No pain. No pain.
- No pain. No pain. All right, Rock. Do it!

794
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,831
There's the bell.
Rocky comes to the centre of the ring,

795
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,748
like the Russian, way back
into Balboa's corner now.

796
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:02,277
- Get outta there!
- Let's go, Rocky!

797
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,355
Balboa gets out of the corner, and it is
Drago backing Rocky up with a jab.

798
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,759
And Balboa is not staying on balance
because of the long jab of the Russian.

799
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,075
Brace yourself! Brace yourself!

800
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,315
Hands up!

801
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,872
- Charge him!
- Now!

802
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,798
He can't seem to touch the Russian.

803
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,550
Rocky pounding away, and he's just hit
him with everything he's got.

804
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,194
And Drago just smiled at him.

805
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:43,077
- Keep choppin' away!
- Chop him down! Chop him down!

806
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,240
Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble!

807
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,352
They might have to stop this one
before somebody gets killed.

808
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,517
Reach and grab him! Reach and grab him!

809
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,349
Rocky woke the sleeping giant,
and now he's paying the price!

810
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:07,598
A right hand from Drago sends Rocky
Balboa 15 feet across the ring,

811
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,075
and the champ is down!

812
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,635
Come on! Get up!

813
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,956
Hands up! Hands up!

814
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:33,519
Drago continuing to punish Rocky.
He will not let him out of that corner,

815
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,031
and Rocky Balboa is just trying to
get through this first round.

816
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:46,831
The Russian just threw Rocky Balboa
into his own corner like a rag doll.

817
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,394
What a tough three minutes
for Rocky Balboa.

818
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,432
He's not only fighting
an invincible opponent,

819
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,915
he's also fighting a hostile crowd,

820
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,238
and the Russian premier and
most of the Politburo looking on.

821
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,670
- What's happenin' out there?
- He's winnin'.

822
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,718
- I see three of him out there.
- Hit the one in the middle.

823
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,798
- Right! Hit the one in the middle!
- Yeah.

824
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,229
You're not doing as you're told.

825
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,353
The American is small and weak...

826
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,999
Weak.

827
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:22,035
Take his heart. If you hurt him, you'll
take his heart. No pain! Keep workin'!

828
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,079
Round two.
It's been a one-sided fight so far.

829
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,909
It'll take more than luck
for Rocky to survive this round.

830
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,276
Slip him a hook, Rock! Slip him a hook!

831
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:38,269
Balboa trying to stay in the middle
of the ring against the big Russian.

832
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,314
Do what you gotta do! Stay with him!

833
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,990
For all intent,
Balboa should be all finished,

834
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,714
but he's fighting back ferociously.

835
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,676
Rocky!

836
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:06,674
Balboa goes down again from
a right hand! Bounces right back up.

837
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,750
He's gettin' killed out there!

838
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,469
Rocky Balboa has taken
lvan Drago's best punches so far.

839
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:21,196
He's cut and he's bleeding,
but he's on his feet and he's on the run!

840
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,593
- He's cut! He's cut!
- The Russian's cut!

841
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:34,669
And it's a bad cut! And now it's
Rocky Balboa coming after lvan Drago!

842
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,838
Incredible! Get him!

843
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,836
Drago wants to go on!
He grabs Balboa by the throat!

844
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:58,078
Balboa picking up the Russian and throws
him to the ground like a wrestler.

845
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:02,034
It's a gutter war!
No holds barred in Moscow!

846
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,516
Rocky may be on the receiving end
so far, but he's here to fight.

847
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,552
This is shaping up to be
a personal war, and right now

848
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,319
it's anybody's boxing match.

849
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,468
You're doin' good, Rocko.
I couldn't do better myself.

850
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,949
How can you do this?

851
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,911
He's nothing... soft!!

852
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,759
You got him hurt bad. Now he's worried.

853
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,633
You cut him! You hurt him! You see?

854
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,149
You see? He's not a machine. He's a man!

855
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,277
He's not human...

856
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,599
He's like a piece of iron.

857
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,990
- You want it more than he does! No pain!
- No pain.

858
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,953
- No pain.
- No pain. OK! Take it to him!

859
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,718
Take it to him! Take it to him!

860
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,593
Get up!

861
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,477
And a big right hand by Rocky Balboa!

862
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,713
You're doin' fine. You're doin' great.

863
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,956
Come on!

864
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,080
A few cheers now for Rocky Balboa!

865
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,998
Suddenly Moscow is pro-Rocky!

866
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,756
No pain. No pain.

867
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,756
Al, this place is ready to explode.

868
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,634
Lethal punch after punch.
Amazing willpower!

869
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:19,073
And Rocky's determination is beginning
to win over what was a hostile crowd.

870
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,428
This is incredible.

871
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,079
- What round is it?
- 15. One more round.

872
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,078
There's no stoppin' us now.
This is our round.

873
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,760
Rocky! Rocky!

874
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,549
No stoppin' now!
You start and you don't stop!

875
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:38,753
All your strength! All your power!
All your love! Everythin' you've got!

876
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:43,078
You trained this fool. He's a disgrace.

877
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,030
Listen to them...

878
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,277
Our people cheer for HIM! You idiot.

879
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,510
WIN!

880
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,756
<i>Nyet!</i>

881
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,517
I fight to win!

882
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,469
For me!

883
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,758
For me!

884
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,756
To win you gotta knock him out! Punch
and punch till you can't punch no more!

885
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,272
- This is your whole life here!
- Yeah, knock him out, Rocko.

886
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,356
Do it now! Now!

887
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,554
- There's the bell. The war is on.
- This is the last round.

888
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,717
To the end.

889
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:34,512
Which of these magnificent fighters
will be standing at the end?

890
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,474
Drago snaps out a stiff jab. And another.

891
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:45,555
Rocky taking punishment. Trying to get
inside. He's completely exhausted.

892
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:49,318
Come on, Rock! What are you waitin' for?!

893
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,471
Rocky! Rocky!

894
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,276
Hit him!

895
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,029
Come on! Fight!

896
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,153
Balboa is chopping the Russian down!

897
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,755
Rocky Balboa throwing
punches at the Russian.

898
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:34,078
And Drago throws a hard right hand
that stuns Rocky Balboa!

899
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,714
Don't go down! Don't go down!

900
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:50,272
Forget technique, forget strategy.
This is a street fight. Who wants it most?

901
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,278
- What is he doin'?!
- He's winnin'!

902
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,835
To the body! To the body!

903
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,760
Rocko, knock his head off!

904
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,110
You're gonna do it!

905
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,955
Lvan!

906
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,109
Four!

907
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:47,398
Rocky Balboa has done the impossible!
And these people love him!

908
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,829
It is absolute pandemonium!

909
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:53,873
More than ever, Rocky has
proven himself a true champion!

910
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,071
Rocky! Rocky!

911
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,036
Thank you.

912
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:35,358
I came here tonight,
and I didn't know what to expect.

913
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,111
I seen... a lot of people hatin' me,

914
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,152
and... I didn't know

915
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:49,673
what to feel about that, so... I guess
I didn't like you much none either.

916
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:59,679
Durin' this... fight...
I seen a lot of changin'.

917
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,277
The way... youse felt about me,

918
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,274
and the way I felt... about you.

919
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:16,312
In here, there were two guys...

920
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:23,795
killin' each other, but I guess...
that's better than 20 million.

921
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,629
What I'm tryin' to say is...

922
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,796
that if I can change...

923
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,956
and <i>you</i> can change,

924
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,031
everybody can change!

925
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,235
Excuse me!

926
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:05,115
I just wanna say one thing to my kid,
who should be home sleepin'.

927
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,800
Merry Christmas, kid!

928
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,750
I love you!
