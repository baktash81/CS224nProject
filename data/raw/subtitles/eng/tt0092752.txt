You're wearing it, Dave.

Don't forget your mittens, Dave.

Please, Dave.

I need a little culture in my life.

I don't even know
where the Louvre is.

Please,
take me with you, Dave!

Alvin, for the last time,

00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,414
this is strictly a business trip.

28
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,000
It's just not practical.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,003

I've hired someone very good

Each of you will be taking
a different route.

And to make sure you travel
completely around the world,

301
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:41,673
both teams must deposit one doll
at twelve different locations.
