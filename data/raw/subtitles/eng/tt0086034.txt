1
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,392
- You didn't say there'd be such security.
- They moved the flight forward.

2
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,227
We'll have to go ahead
as planned anyway.

3
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,648
Toro? Sounds like a load of bull.

4
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,900
James.

5
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,321
Be careful.

6
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,272
Well, small world. You're a Toro, too.

7
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,444
I'll see you in Miami.

8
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,324
Fill her up.

9
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,617
Your guests have arrived, Ambassador.

10
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,536
We should go, my dear.

11
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,896
Well...

12
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,064
You become more beautiful every day.

13
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,401
- I'm over here.
- Of course you are.

14
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,863
This is Miss Penelope Smallbone,
my new assistant.

15
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:44,990
Miss Smallbone.

16
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:50,996
What can I say, Moneypenny? Except that
she is as attractive and as charming...

17
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,499
- As I used to be?
- I didn't say that.

18
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,709
You're such a flatterer, James.

19
00:13:55,793 --> 00:14:00,506
Moneypenny, you know there never has
been and never will be anybody but you.

20
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,633
So you've told me.

21
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,679
- Welcome to Universal Exports.
- Take it, dear.

22
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,475
- That's all you'll ever get from him.
- Thank you, Commander Bond.

23
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,395
- Do you know me?
- Miss Moneypenny described you.

24
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,148
In nauseating detail.

25
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,816
Really?

26
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,779
I can see you're going
to fit in here very nicely.

27
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,327
- Good morning, 007.
- Morning, sir.

28
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,788
- Minister.
- Commander.

29
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,041
I think you know Jim Fanning,
our art expert.

30
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,126
- Yes. Hello, Jim.
- James.

31
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,214
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a Fabergé egg, sir.

32
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,385
One of the jewelled eggs by Carl Fabergé
as a gift for the Russian royal family.

33
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,556
They're priceless and very rare.

34
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,142
This one contains a model
of the imperial state coach.

35
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,103
- Top marks, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

36
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,146
Except it's a fake.

37
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,442
There's the real thing. It's being
auctioned at Sotheby's this afternoon.

38
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,362
This is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year.

39
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:10,659
It's from none of the usual sources.
Anonymous seller, Swiss bank account.

40
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:14,621
I'd say that the vendor was a Russian.

41
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:19,167
And now this turns up.
A near-perfect forgery.

42
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,212
I think Commander Bond
should accompany you to the sale.

43
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,465
Splendid. I could use
an extra pair of eyes.

44
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,926
We could try and spot the seller.

45
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,806
They usually turn up out of interest
or perhaps just to bump up the price.

46
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,182
Thank you, Fanning.

47
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,351
Not at all.

48
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,608
If it is the Russians,
it may be an effort to raise currency

49
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,611
for covert operations abroad
or for payoffs.

50
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,197
Either way,
we'd better find out what they're up to.

51
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,618
- Yes, Minister.
- Eyes only, 007.

52
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,745
Operation Trove.

53
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,955
You'll be replacing 009.

54
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,960
He turned up dead in East Germany
with that egg in his hand.

55
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,920
There's not much to go on.

56
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,214
Well, we do have one lead, Minister.

57
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,718
"Property of a Lady."

58
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:15,599
Next on the agenda is the continuing
mutual disarmament talks with NATO.

59
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,269
I assume you've all read
General Gogol's report.

60
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,023
It seems very thorough.

61
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,984
Thank you, Comrade Chairman.

62
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,863
I believe I express the opinion
of everyone present

63
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:36,495
that adoption of NATO proposals does
not compromise our defensive position.

64
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,749
- Comrade Chairman.
- General Orlov.

65
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,836
General Gogol is presumptuous.

66
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,173
He speaks for himself and others

67
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:55,180
who cling to timid, outdated
and unrealistic policies.

68
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,684
Must I remind you, the committee,

69
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:03,814
of our overwhelming superiority
over NATO forces

70
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,774
before we give it away?

71
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,995
In East Germany
under my direct command,

72
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:24,835
I have 31 divisions,
including 1 1 tank divisions

73
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,713
and another five in Czechoslovakia.

74
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:32,801
In support, on the Russian western
border are 60 divisions,

75
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,304
including 22 tank divisions.

76
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,516
In all, a 1 0-1 advantage.

77
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:48,400
American and West German forces
can field at most ten armoured divisions.

78
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:52,529
The British maintain only a token force.

79
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,910
We have played out a variety of attack
strategies on the new Kutuzov computer

80
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:05,000
and find that a lightning thrust by
ten armoured divisions from the north,

81
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:12,924
and by five more through Czechoslovakia,
lead to total victory in five days

82
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:17,179
against any possible defence scenario.

83
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,599
This is absolute madness.

84
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,642
We know where it will end.

85
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:26,521
NATO will counterattack
with nuclear weapons.

86
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,064
Never.

87
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,693
The West is decadent and divided.

88
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,405
It has no stomach
to risk our atomic reprisals.

89
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:41,787
Throughout Europe, daily demonstrations
demand unilateral nuclear disarmament.

90
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,414
I see no reason to risk war

91
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:49,085
to satisfy your personal paranoia
and thirst for conquest.

92
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,799
We must turn our energies
to pressing domestic problems.

93
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,803
- General Gogol, let me remind you...
- Comrades, sit down.

94
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,514
- I wish to tell you...
- Both of you.

95
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,435
World socialism
will be achieved peaceably.

96
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,396
Our military role is strictly defensive.

97
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,483
Is that understood, General Orlov?

98
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,740
General Gogol, would you continue?

99
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:25,413
Thank you, Comrade Chairman. I will
now turn to the specifics of my report...

100
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,042
Tell him I will be there
as quickly as possible.

101
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,854
Please. Please.

102
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,439
- I am trying to concentrate.
- Lenkin.

103
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,487
- What is it?
- It's terrible news, Comrade General.

104
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:01,032
The reproduction
has been stolen in transit.

105
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,828
The thief was dealt with,
but the egg was lost in the river.

106
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,791
Your incompetence will destroy us all.

107
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,545
- We'll have a replacement made.
- There is no time, Comrade General.

108
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,757
I have just been informed of
an unscheduled inventory in two days.

109
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,593
Control yourself.

110
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:24,264
I'll tell our London people
we must have the genuine egg back.

111
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,978
I hope we can reach them in time.

112
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,813
Sold to Busoni.

113
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,029
The next lot is number 48.

114
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,824
A superb green-gold
Imperial Easter egg by Carl Fabergé.

115
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,579
Enamelled in translucent green,
enclosed by gold laurel-leaf trellis.

116
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,750
Set with blue sapphires and
four petalled gold flowers with diamonds.

117
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:57,088
- How much should it fetch?
- £250-300,000. Anything more'd be crazy.

118
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,634
...used by Tsar Nicholas
in 1 897 in Moscow.

119
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,511
Property of a Lady.

120
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:07,140
Well, there are quite a few ladies here.

121
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:11,144
She wouldn't have to be here in person.
She could be represented by proxy.

122
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,481
I'll start it at £1 50,000.

123
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,401
1 50, 60.

124
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,321
1 70. 1 70.

125
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,575
1 80, 1 90.

126
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,536
200. Against you, madam.

127
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,290
- Any more?
- Now there is a lady.

128
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,209
£220,000.

129
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,710
240.

130
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,089
James, stick to the business in hand.

131
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,883
£260,000.

132
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,093
280.

133
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,804
£300,000.

134
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,847
And 20?

135
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,356
Are you bidding, sir?

136
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,903
£320,000. New bidder.

137
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,240
- That's interesting.
- You know him?

138
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,743
Kamal Khan. Usually a seller.

139
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,539
Marginal quality from dubious sources.

140
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,417
£380,000.

141
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,586
- 400 in the centre.
- Well, that should do it.

142
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,215
- Kamal has gone over the top.
- Your bid, sir. 400,000.

143
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,468
400,000. Any more?

144
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,929
425. New bidder.

145
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,932
Thank you, sir.

146
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,937
- 425.
- Have you gone mad?

147
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,274
Let's see how badly he wants it.

148
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:40,442
450?

149
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,447
450. 475?

150
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,868
The bid is 450. 475?

151
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:00,295
Against you, sir. No more than 450.

152
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:05,008
- Jim?
- The bid is £450,000.

153
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,137
I have 475.

154
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,977
£500,000.

155
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,981
I have half a million pounds. All done?

156
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,026
Any more?

157
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,615
Yours, sir, for £500,000.

158
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,994
- The next lot is...
- We could have been stuck with it.

159
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,414
- I doubt it. He had to buy it.
- But why?

160
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,292
That's what I intend to find out.

161
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:17,497
You had no business bidding for that egg.

162
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,958
What would you have done if you'd got it?

163
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:23,795
I would have claimed it was a fake, sir,
and not paid.

164
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,213
Not paid?

165
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:30,051
Here's the original. I switched it
with the fake during the auction.

166
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,803
Good God.

167
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,142
And what happens
when the buyer discovers that?

168
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:41,146
Well, he complains. If he's legitimate.

169
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,523
- Well?
- I don't think he will complain.

170
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,777
According to Fanning,
this Kamal usually sells. Now he buys.

171
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,655
I believe that the fake will smoke him out.

172
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,075
Our tail followed him to Heathrow
where he caught a plane to Delhi.

173
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,203
You must go there, too.

174
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:01,666
I'll alert Sadruddin, our man in Station I,
to keep him under surveillance.

175
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,254
- Book yourself on the next flight out.
- Well, I've 55 minutes to catch it, sir.

176
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,924
- Oh, Bond?
- Sir?

177
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:15,180
Sign a chit for that egg before you go.
It's government property now.

178
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,432
Of course, sir.

179
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,420
Charming tune.
You do take English money?

180
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,005
Only gold sovereigns.

181
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:33,174
Please.

182
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,762
I'm Vijay.
Special expediter, Universal Exports.

183
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,515
- Welcome to India, Commander Bond.
- Call me James.

184
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,685
- Where's Sadruddin?
- Waiting in the taxi.

185
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,604
This was the wrong cover. I hate snakes.

186
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:50,108
Taxi. Please be comfortable.

187
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:56,197
- I am Sadruddin, Head of Section.
- How do you do?

188
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,242
- I booked you in at the Shivnivas Hotel.
- Good. My luggage?

189
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,702
Gone ahead.

190
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,210
What can you tell me about Kamal Khan?

191
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:13,840
Exiled Afghan prince.
Sportsman - polo, cricket, tennis.

192
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,466
- I play a bit myself.
- Really?

193
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:20,138
As a matter of fact, I've got
a part-time job as a pro at Kamal's club.

194
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,808
- What have you learned so far?
- My backhand's improved.

195
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,399
Kamal lives there on the hill.

196
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,485
The Monsoon Palace.
It's heavily guarded.

197
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:40,742
- How do I get to him?
- He plays backgammon at the hotel.

198
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,578
As a guest,
you're automatically a member.

199
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:48,833
- Let's meet there later.
- I'll change into something less casual.

200
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,878
Here, you may need this
to play with your asp.

201
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,563
Good morning. Name's Bond.
I believe you have a reservation.

202
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,774
- We've been expecting you.
- Good.

203
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,193
I hope you have a pleasant stay.

204
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,236
I'm sure I will.

205
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,867
Thank you.

206
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,705
Your luggage has been unpacked, sir.

207
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,960
- Oh, thank you.
- If I can be of further assistance...

208
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,672
- Anything at all?
- Maybe later.

209
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,062
- How's he doing?
- The Major's no novice.

210
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:36,899
- But Kamal has won 200,000 rupees.
- You'll have a job beating this.

211
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,530
I feel lucky. Shall we double?

212
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:44,907
Of course.

213
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,202
20,000 rupees.

214
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,377
- Always a double six when you need it.
- Always.

215
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,963
- How do you do it.
- It's all in the wrist.

216
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,800
- It's hopeless.
- Shall we have another game, Major?

217
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,428
- Same stake?
- Yes, I'll have another go.

218
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,139
Your luck's got to run out some time.

219
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,523
May I join you?

220
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,234
Sotheby's. Half a million pounds?

221
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,405
- The man at the auction.
- Precisely.

222
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,617
You have a good memory for faces.

223
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,784
And figures.

224
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,706
- This can't be a coincidence.
- No.

225
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,293
- What will you have?
- Nothing, thank you.

226
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,296
Some other time, perhaps?

227
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,882
Thank you.

228
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,598
Six and one.

229
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,518
- Well?
- Looks like the Major has got him.

230
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:03,236
Why don't we make it interesting, Major?
Double to 1 00,000 rupees.

231
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,950
I can't accept. Not with your luck.

232
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,203
You win.

233
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,956
I would have taken that double, myself.

234
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:21,295
Then why don't you take over
the Major's position? Mr...?

235
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,463
Bond.

236
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,259
James Bond. Thank you, I'd be delighted.

237
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,887
1 00,000 rupees, then.

238
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,725
Double six.

239
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,145
Not such a good double to accept,
after all, was it?

240
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,241
- Double.
- Of course.

241
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,327
You can only win with a double six.

242
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:59,041
The stake is 200,000 rupees.
Do you have the cash?

243
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,966
Well, I think that this
should be ample security.

244
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,428
Don't you?

245
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,312
Play, Mr Bond.

246
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,524
You'll need a great deal of luck
to get out of this.

247
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,610
Oh, luck?

248
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:29,155
Well, then I shall use player's privilege,

249
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,116
and use your lucky dice.

250
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,202
It's all in the wrist.

251
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:39,749
Double sixes.

252
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,585
Fancy that.

253
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,546
200,000 rupees.

254
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,015
I prefer cash.

255
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,272
- Get it cashed for him.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:10,446
Spend the money quickly, Mr Bond.

257
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,574
I intend to, Kamal Khan.

258
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,619
My security.

259
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,081
And yours?

260
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,977
It's not really in the wrist, you know.

261
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:53,698
- Should I be following them?
- Yes, but I think they'll be following this.

262
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:54,990
Thank you.

263
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:59,870
Vijay will take you from here. I'll see
if I can find out more about Kamal.

264
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,331
Good. Hold on to these, will you?

265
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,627
Keep you in curry
for a few weeks, won't it?

266
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:10,297
Thank you.
It's a wonderful racket, this.

267
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:46,333
- Vijay, we have company.
- No problem. This is a company car.

268
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,473
Step on it.

269
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,893
This should shake 'em off.

270
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,265
Thank God for hard currency.

271
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,654
Game, set and match. Hang on, James.

272
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,177
Keep your head down.

273
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,605
Thank you.

274
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,651
Here. Catch.

275
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:22,990
Excuse me.

276
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,756
Thank you.
You'd better stick this back yourself.

277
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,804
James, over here. Come on.

278
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,655
Vijay. The money I gave you.

279
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,744
Here. Rupees!

280
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,374
Easy come, easy go.

281
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,234
It pays to advertise.

282
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,403
This way, James.

283
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,791
Q.

284
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:00,838
- How are you?
- Most unhappy, 007, thanks to you.

285
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,841
How can I be expected
to maintain the quality of my work?

286
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,719
Sent out here at a moment's notice.

287
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:11,348
Have you any smaller thread?
Someone stuck a knife in my wallet.

288
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,809
Pity they missed you.

289
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,562
Karen, see to that, will you?

290
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:20,024
I've also mislaid my PPK.

291
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,151
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

292
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:31,618
Blast.

293
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,664
Having problems keeping it up, Q?

294
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,458
Experimental model.

295
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,714
- Hello, Smithers.
- Commander.

296
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,474
- Smashing, Q.
- Come on. I have a few things for you.

297
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,933
Very nice, Smithers.

298
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,979
Is the homing device ready yet?

299
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:04,318
Not only a homing device, but an
extremely delicate microphone as well.

300
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,696
It goes in there like that.

301
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,240
Now, take a fountain pen.

302
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,950
Twist the top,

303
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:17,456
and a highly concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochloric acid.

304
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,710
- Dissolves all metals.
- Wonderful for poison-pen letters.

305
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,880
Pay attention, 007.

306
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,840
Pull the top off the pen.

307
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:31,261
With this ultrasensitive earpiece,
you can listen in on the bug.

308
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:36,975
The homing device is compatible with
the radio directional finder in your watch.

309
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,394
If you haven't lost it.

310
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,487
That's amazing, Q. It does work.

311
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,531
What's that?

312
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,201
That's the latest liquid-crystal TV.

313
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,331
Very handy.

314
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,347
Perfect image, Q.

315
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,058
Really, 007.

316
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,895
Look, I haven't time
for these adolescent antics.

317
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,233
- It's the best we can do.
- It's beautiful. Thank you.

318
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,945
Go on, get along. I've got my work to do.

319
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,989
- I'll give you a hand, Q.
- Thank you.

320
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,782
Don't forget this.

321
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,869
Don't let him teach you
any of his bad habits.

322
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,637
Mr Bond, your table is ready.

323
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,308
- I didn't reserve one.
- Your guest is waiting, sir.

324
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,059
This way, please.

325
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,148
Thank you.

326
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,234
You changed your mind.

327
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:12,863
- I'm glad.
- Are you?

328
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,866
Well, let's put it this way.

329
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:21,288
So far, you are the least lethal and
by far the prettiest of Kamal's friends.

330
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,998
Thank you.

331
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,461
So does he have
a proposition for me, or do you?

332
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,465
He suggests a trade.

333
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,635
The egg for your life.

334
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:40,766
I'd heard the price of eggs
was going up, but isn't that a little high?

335
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,977
Charge it to Room...

336
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:49,349
Oh, 27. Along with the champagne, I suppose?
I'll leave it at the desk.

337
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,403
You don't mind?

338
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:57,115
Why? Has Kamal forgotten
what I look like already?

339
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,617
It's for me.

340
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,537
So that if I depart this world suddenly,

341
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:05,290
you'll have something
to remember me by?

342
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,669
Something like that.

343
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:14,091
It's for my scrapbook. I collect memories.

344
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,681
Well, let's get on with making a few.

345
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,959
I need refilling.

346
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:52,879
Of course you do.

347
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,721
I'll get some more.

348
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:04,224
Don't bother.
We'll make yours a loving cup.

349
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,185
What a good idea.

350
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:15,610
Forgive my curiosity, but what is that?

351
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,323
That's my little octopussy.

352
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:23,011
Good morning.

353
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,304
Morning.

354
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,517
I didn't want to wake you.
But since you're up,

355
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,644
I can say a proper goodbye.

356
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,527
What is the time?

357
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,954
Beautiful view, isn't it?

358
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:58,004
- I don't know how to say goodbye.
- Actions speak louder than words.

359
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,756
So right.

360
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:39,546
In. Out. In. Out.

361
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,799
Come on, girls. In. Out.

362
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,056
Check oars.

363
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,800
The egg has been recovered.

364
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,845
You should be pleased.

365
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,599
I'm not pleased
it was stolen in the first place.

366
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:17,477
Nor that the thief
knows enough to bring it here.

367
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:22,107
He's obviously an adventurer
with possible blackmail on his mind.

368
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:26,403
Anyway, I have him as my guest
at the Monsoon Palace.

369
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:29,489
And he will tell us
all he knows very quickly.

370
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,034
- Who is he?
- Englishman.

371
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:37,455
Likes eggs. Preferably Fabergé.

372
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,250
And dice. Preferably loaded.

373
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,294
His name is James Bond.

374
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,298
Bring him here.

375
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:50,969
He's dangerous. After he's talked,
we must get rid of him immediately.

376
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,972
No.

377
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:59,519
A "no" from you
has little chance of becoming a "yes".

378
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:02,439
I assume, therefore,
that the meeting is over.

379
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,025
But you're making a serious mistake.

380
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:33,113
Well, so far I can't complain
about the valet service.

381
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,074
Dinner. 8 o'clock.

382
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,733
- Good evening, Mr Bond.
- Good evening.

383
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,526
Well rested?

384
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,821
I believe you and Miss Magda have met.

385
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,910
- It was a pleasure.
- You're too kind.

386
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:25,999
You don't mind if we start?
The soufflé can't wait.

387
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,257
At the risk of appearing
to be making light dinner conversation,

388
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,051
may I ask exactly why I am here?

389
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:40,096
I mean, after all, you do have the egg.

390
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,725
True. But we don't have all the answers.

391
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:49,522
Well, supposing, for argument's sake,
I don't feel like talking?

392
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,899
Don't worry, you will.

393
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:55,528
Let me guess.

394
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,115
Thumbscrews and hot coals.

395
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,786
Hardly. We're much more
sophisticated than that.

396
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:10,460
- Sodium Pentothal?
- A bit crude. Very unreliable.

397
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:15,882
We prefer curare with
an effective psychedelic compound.

398
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,801
Guaranteed results.

399
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:22,138
- But with permanent brain damage.
- An unfortunate side effect.

400
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,392
One of our specialities.

401
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,397
Stuffed sheep's head.

402
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:42,951
It's odd, but when I'm stared at
I seem to lose my appetite.

403
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,177
Oh, thank you for dinner.

404
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,597
Until tomorrow, then.

405
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:15,608
- Well, I'll say good night.
- I could come in for a nightcap.

406
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,279
Some other time, perhaps.

407
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,789
I don't suppose you'd care
for a nightcap? No.

408
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,894
I trust you had a pleasant flight.

409
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:04,235
If you step this way, I think you
will find everything is in order.

410
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:43,775
Congratulations on the quality of
your workmanship, Kamal Khan.

411
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,318
Thank you, General Orlov.

412
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:49,655
As you can see, each piece
has been meticulously duplicated

413
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,159
according to Lenkin's specifications.

414
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:57,163
Good. Have it put aboard the helicopter.

415
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:06,255
<i>- Can they be trusted?</i>
<i>- l assure you of their silence.</i>

416
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,222
<i>We are both playing for enormous stakes.</i>

417
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:20,144
I get what I want,
then you get the genuine jewellery.

418
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:21,646
<i>Exactly...</i>

419
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,379
The precise timing will be essential.

420
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,716
Remember: nothing must be changed.

421
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:59,600
<i>One week from today, in Karl-Marx-Stadt.</i>

422
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,271
- Karl-Marx-Stadt.
- Correct.

423
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:25,334
- Everything taken care of?
- As you ordered, Excellence.

424
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:31,507
- So, you recovered it?
- From an accomplice of the thief.

425
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:34,802
He must be eliminated at once.

426
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:39,557
There must be no further security breach.

427
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,894
This fake has caused enough trouble.

428
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:48,608
I must go.

429
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,746
Everything has been most satisfactory.

430
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,081
Most kind, General Orlov.

431
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,544
Get Bond.

432
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,356
The Englishman has escaped.

433
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:15,152
He won't go very far. We'll track him.

434
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,157
Good.

435
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,451
Let the sport commence.

436
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,744
Head him off.

437
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,675
Sit!

438
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,019
We have him.

439
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,981
Go round. He's in there.

440
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,267
Hiss off.

441
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:01,188
Don't let him get away.

442
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:39,184
C'mom, buddy, c'mon.

443
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,106
- Hey, you all right, buddy?
- I'm fine.

444
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:48,527
- Are you with our group?
- No, ma'am. I'm with the economy tour.

445
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:56,452
Mr Bond is indeed a very rare breed.

446
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:59,121
Soon to be made extinct.

447
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:11,258
Genus Hapalochlaena. Produces a venom
that's invariably fatal in seconds.

448
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:13,218
The barge had that sign.

449
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:17,931
It belongs to a wealthy woman
who lives on the floating palace.

450
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:19,516
Who?

451
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:23,187
No one knows her real name,
but she's known as Octopussy.

452
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:26,565
That's the name I heard at Kamal's.

453
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:31,028
I hear that island's full of
beautiful women. No men allowed.

454
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:34,114
Really? Sexual discrimination.

455
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,493
I'll definitely have to pay it a visit.

456
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,501
Good evening.

457
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:13,839
I wondered when you might arrive.

458
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,508
So you are the mysterious Octopussy.

459
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,761
And you are James Bond.

460
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,180
007, licensed to kill.

461
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,725
Am I to be your target for tonight?

462
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,019
Not necessarily.

463
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,649
Depends how much you tell me
about jewellery smuggling.

464
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:35,861
And why one of our agents
was killed in East Berlin.

465
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,988
I know nothing about that.

466
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,574
You remember Major Dexter Smythe?

467
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,703
You were sent out to arrest him,
weren't you?

468
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:47,331
You seem to have done your homework.

469
01:08:48,008 --> 01:08:50,529
Thank you. Yes. Smythe,
after a brilliant

470
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:53,170
military career, joined
our secret service.

471
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:57,758
His mission was to recover a cache
of Chinese gold, seized in North Korea.

472
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:01,178
Both he and his native guide disappeared.

473
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,263
The gold was never found.

474
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,810
And 20 years later
you were sent after him.

475
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:11,953
The guide's body turned
up with a bullet

476
01:09:11,954 --> 01:09:14,958
still in his skull from
Smythe's revolver.

477
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,986
I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,

478
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:21,281
and gave him 24 hours to clear up
his affairs before I took him back.

479
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:26,453
He committed suicide rather than
face the disgrace of a court martial.

480
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:28,413
What's the connection?

481
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:35,754
He was my father. I'd hoped
fate would bring us together one day.

482
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:37,840
To avenge him?

483
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:41,009
To thank you for giving him
an honourable alternative.

484
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,350
Come in.

485
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:51,854
Kamal Khan to see you.

486
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,734
Bond has escaped.

487
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,321
- How careless of you.
- I apologise.

488
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,909
By the way, I'd like you
to meet my new house guest.

489
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:09,705
An old friend of the family, you might say.

490
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:10,956
How lovely.

491
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,669
You have a nasty habit of surviving.

492
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:18,297
You know what they say about the fittest.

493
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:25,053
Octopussy, I'd enjoy another opportunity
to take care of Mr Bond personally.

494
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,639
I will take care of Mr Bond myself.

495
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:31,435
Good night.

496
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:36,148
And enjoy yourselves.

497
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,358
Mr Bond.

498
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,661
My father became
a leading authority on octopi.

499
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:53,081
He loved them.
His pet name for me was Octopussy.

500
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:02,215
Mr Bond, smuggling is
no concern of the secret service.

501
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,509
I've violated no British law.

502
01:11:04,811 --> 01:11:07,262
You are free to leave,
but I'd much prefer

503
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,656
if you stayed as my
guest for a few days.

504
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:11,934
I'd like that.

505
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,521
Gwendoline, show Mr Bond to his room.

506
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,108
Good night, Mr Bond.

507
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:23,362
Till the morning, then.

508
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,534
Midge.

509
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:34,456
Extend Mr Bond every courtesy,
but double the guard on his quarters.

510
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,732
He says the island is heavily guarded.

511
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,822
We don't want to
make enemies with the woman.

512
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,305
The woman must not be harmed.

513
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:57,873
When Father's gold ran out, the people in
Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him

514
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:01,126
offered me a commission
to smuggle some diamonds.

515
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:03,545
I discovered I had a talent for it.

516
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,672
You went into business for yourself?

517
01:13:05,757 --> 01:13:09,968
Yes, but I needed an organisation,
so I revived the old Octopus cult.

518
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:14,723
Well, then.
Where did you recruit all these lovelies?

519
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,894
There are many of them
all over Southeast Asia,

520
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:22,564
looking for a guru,
spiritual discipline, who knows what.

521
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:28,028
I train them. Give them a purpose,
a sisterhood and a way of life.

522
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,739
- In crime?
- In business.

523
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:34,826
I have diversified into
shipping, hotels, carnivals and circuses.

524
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,376
- Is he still there?
- You must be joking.

525
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:47,380
007 on an island
populated exclusively by women?

526
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:50,008
We won't see him till dawn.

527
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,846
- I'll relieve you at midnight.
- No problem.

528
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:17,911
Are we going somewhere?

529
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:20,789
I have to go to Europe tomorrow
on a business trip.

530
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:25,460
Oh, that's a pity.
I was just beginning to enjoy myself.

531
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:29,297
I think you should stay.
I'll only be gone a week.

532
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:32,509
When I come back
we'll discuss the future.

533
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:36,596
Well, I can't guarantee
that I'll be here when you return.

534
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:40,142
Oh, James. We're two of a kind.

535
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:45,105
There are vast rewards for a man
of your talents willing to take risks.

536
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,694
- I'm not for hire.
- A man of principle.

537
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:52,696
With a price on his head.

538
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,323
Naturally, you would do it
for Queen and country.

539
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,912
I have no country,
I have no price on my head.

540
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:04,749
I don't have to apologise to you,
a paid assassin, for what I am.

541
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,768
No.

542
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,146
You're right.

543
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,023
We are two of a kind.

544
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:39,451
James.

545
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,153
Q?

546
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,626
Is something wrong?

547
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,504
Not really.

548
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:58,798
Just a feeling.

549
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,926
Why don't you come back to bed?

550
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,366
Move!

551
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,097
James.

552
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,067
Watch it!

553
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:05,949
Come on.

554
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:31,808
Careful.

555
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,355
The gun!

556
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,256
What happened to Vijay?

557
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,346
He was alive when I found him.

558
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:55,767
- Did he say anything?
- Only "It was Kamal's men."

559
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,731
No more problems.

560
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:10,156
- Better signal M to meet me in Berlin.
- Why?

561
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:13,451
Well, I have to go to a circus
in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

562
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:26,631
We verified the Octopussy Circus
was in East Berlin when we lost 009.

563
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,468
Karl-Marx-Stadt is further east.

564
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:35,807
Why would General Orlov
participate in a jewellery caper?

565
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:40,144
Well, the jewellery, sir,
I think is, if you'll forgive the analogy,

566
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,730
only the tip of the tentacle.

567
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:46,109
Here's the ID you'll need.

568
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:50,363
Charles Moreton, manufacturer's
representative from Leeds

569
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:53,366
visiting furniture factories
in East Germany.

570
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:56,536
- Karl will take you in.
- No problem.

571
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:08,006
Remember, 007, you're on your own.

572
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,842
Thank you, sir. That's a great comfort.

573
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:50,817
Mischka.

574
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:13,918
Of course you know Comrade Borchoi,
the curator of the Hermitage.

575
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:18,214
He just arrived from Leningrad.

576
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:20,898
The Romanov Star.

577
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:11,392
Stay here with the jewellery while
they switch the car to the main track.

578
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,811
You stay, also.

579
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,102
1 00 kiloton yield.

580
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:40,189
The effects are indistinguishable
from the American medium-yield bomb.

581
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:48,406
The detonator, now listen carefully.
It is pre-set for a four-hour delay.

582
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:51,158
Set time for the explosion here.

583
01:28:55,205 --> 01:29:02,420
To activate, insert and twist
the lever a quarter-turn clockwise.

584
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:06,298
Be at least 20 miles away
when it goes off.

585
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:12,573
The jewellery should net us
300 million in Zürich.

586
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:15,076
We still have to cross the border.

587
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,666
I must go.

588
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:26,170
Au revoir, dear lady.

589
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,546
Good luck.

590
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,651
Bring the canister.

591
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:25,414
Put it in the car.

592
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:34,757
Leave that. Let's go.

593
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:38,886
Let's stay. Sit on that box.
Hands on your knees. Come on, move.

594
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:41,639
Why is that bomb on the train?

595
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:47,102
- Who are you?
- British secret service.

596
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:55,110
You should be more concerned
about getting out of here alive.

597
01:32:55,528 --> 01:33:00,241
I am more concerned about an atomic
bomb exploding on a US Air Force base.

598
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:04,662
You can't be inviting a nuclear war.
What happens when the US retaliates?

599
01:33:04,955 --> 01:33:06,830
Against whom?

600
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:11,001
My God. Of course.

601
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:16,131
Our early-warning system will rule out
the bomb having come from Russia

602
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:18,259
or anywhere else.

603
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:23,347
Everyone will assume incorrectly that
it was a US bomb triggered accidentally.

604
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:27,893
That would be
the most plausible explanation.

605
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:30,980
Europe will insist on disarmament,

606
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:34,483
leaving every border undefended
for you to walk across at will.

607
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,944
It doesn't matter a damn to you

608
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:40,656
that thousands of innocent people
will die in your accident.

609
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:43,993
Better than letting
a handful of old men in Moscow

610
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:48,330
bargain away our advantage
in disarmament talks.

611
01:33:48,415 --> 01:33:51,375
On your feet, General.
You're going to stop that train.

612
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:58,340
- Too late.
- You can stop it at the border.

613
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:08,017
Kill him!

614
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,971
Get to the station!

615
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:55,981
Stop that car!

616
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:29,807
Stop.

617
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:34,812
Follow that car.

618
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:23,545
Kamal Khan says we are to stay here
until we cross the border.

619
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:35,682
The licence plate is General Orlov's.

620
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:38,769
We have discovered this.

621
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:45,817
- Where is General Orlov now?
- Last reported heading for the border.

622
01:39:14,324 --> 01:39:16,325
I must get to that train.

623
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,082
Stop!

624
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:39,723
A common thief.

625
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:43,894
A disgrace to the uniform.

626
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:46,897
Yes. But tomorrow,

627
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:50,400
I shall be a hero

628
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:53,695
of the Soviet Union.

629
01:40:23,768 --> 01:40:26,353
It is now 1 1 .45.

630
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,522
The performance begins at 3.

631
01:40:28,606 --> 01:40:33,318
Allowing for delays,
set the bomb to detonate at 3.45.

632
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:53,588
We must leave the base by 3. 1 5.

633
01:40:54,716 --> 01:40:57,718
I take it none of you will be late.

634
01:43:13,062 --> 01:43:14,229
The jewellery.

635
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:16,857
- Did you recognise him?
- No.

636
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:18,692
Stay here with her.

637
01:44:06,824 --> 01:44:08,325
On the roof. Trouble.

638
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:35,352
Mischka.

639
01:45:11,681 --> 01:45:12,722
And this,

640
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:15,850
for my brother.

641
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:24,234
And that's for 009.

642
01:47:04,794 --> 01:47:07,378
Gobinda will stay with the jewellery.

643
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:57,197
General, excuse me. I have some travel
arrangements to make. Enjoy the show.

644
01:48:57,281 --> 01:49:00,366
- Thank you.
- I'm sure he'll get a big blast out of this.

645
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:02,869
I know he won't be disappointed.

646
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:30,832
- That was Bond.
- Good. Let him keep going.

647
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:33,126
He'll be late and we'll be rid of him too.

648
01:50:38,299 --> 01:50:39,340
Great, isn't it?

649
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:48,725
Fantastic.

650
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:55,982
- Marvellous.
- General,

651
01:50:56,066 --> 01:50:58,985
How long would I get
in the brig if I stole your wallet?

652
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:01,321
- About two years.
- That long?

653
01:51:01,405 --> 01:51:04,490
Well, in that case, I'd better return it.

654
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:06,075
Son of a gun.

655
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:19,422
- Where's the Base Commander?
- Let's see your circus pass.

656
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:21,174
Damn it, man, it's urgent.

657
01:51:22,718 --> 01:51:24,093
Get out. Hands up!

658
01:51:33,187 --> 01:51:38,816
Some nut in a red shirt went through in
a stolen car. Wants the Base Commander.

659
01:51:41,737 --> 01:51:42,820
There he is.

660
01:51:46,492 --> 01:51:48,951
Go after that guy in the red shirt.

661
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:52,622
<i>Behind the trailers.</i>

662
01:52:11,433 --> 01:52:15,311
Keep searching, you guys.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

663
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:20,733
Look under the trailer, you guys.

664
01:52:51,557 --> 01:52:55,476
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
- Hey. Is anyone else in there?

665
01:52:55,561 --> 01:53:02,525
<i>For the first time in this country,</i>
<i>the death-defying human cannonball.</i>

666
01:53:03,026 --> 01:53:08,281
<i>l have the pleasure in presenting to you</i>
<i>Francisco the Fearless.</i>

667
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:17,039
The suspect's wearing a clown suit. Over.

668
01:53:25,549 --> 01:53:26,924
That's him.

669
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:34,515
Hold it, buddy. You're coming with us.

670
01:53:50,532 --> 01:53:54,869
- General, there's a bomb in that cannon.
- Sure. Where else would a bomb be?

671
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:59,373
- Great clown.
- I'm deadly serious. I'm a British agent.

672
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:02,210
- What?
- For God's sake, tell him who I am.

673
01:54:02,294 --> 01:54:05,880
Kamal and Orlov double-crossed you. I saw
them take the jewellery off the train.

674
01:54:08,383 --> 01:54:09,425
Does that convince you?

675
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:15,181
Sir, that bomb is set to explode at 3.45.
That's 90 seconds from now.

676
01:54:15,265 --> 01:54:17,725
General, this man's either drunk or crazy.

677
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:27,652
He'll destroy the entire operation.

678
01:54:46,463 --> 01:54:48,965
You two, grab that man. Hold him.

679
01:54:49,967 --> 01:54:51,551
Damn it. Let go.

680
01:54:52,469 --> 01:54:54,679
Let me go, there's a bomb in there.

681
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:08,568
Let him go.

682
01:55:10,612 --> 01:55:12,446
Quiet, everyone.

683
01:55:28,547 --> 01:55:29,630
Now?

684
01:55:31,216 --> 01:55:33,509
Thank you. Great job, sir.

685
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:36,345
Where was Kamal going?

686
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:37,930
Back to India.

687
01:55:43,312 --> 01:55:47,940
<i>Folks, we've had an emergency,</i>
<i>but everything is all right now.</i>

688
01:55:48,025 --> 01:55:51,152
<i>You and your families are safe.</i>

689
01:55:51,236 --> 01:55:56,198
<i>Now, please leave the tent</i>
<i>in an orderly manner. Thank you.</i>

690
01:55:59,953 --> 01:56:03,247
- The plane is refuelled.
- We'll take off at sunrise.

691
01:56:03,332 --> 01:56:06,667
- Are the gold certificates on board?
- Yes, Excellence.

692
01:56:08,295 --> 01:56:12,214
We'll take these also.
Dollars, pounds, francs, marks.

693
01:56:12,299 --> 01:56:13,924
I can always print my own.

694
01:56:17,638 --> 01:56:21,599
- What is that?
- Girls selling themselves.

695
01:56:21,683 --> 01:56:25,019
Good. It will keep the men occupied.

696
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:27,146
I don't want them to see me leave.

697
01:56:36,073 --> 01:56:37,114
Now.

698
01:56:47,876 --> 01:56:49,418
Give us a hand.

699
01:57:27,624 --> 01:57:28,833
Come on.

700
01:57:52,733 --> 01:57:54,400
Let's go. All set?

701
01:58:05,370 --> 01:58:06,579
Lift.

702
01:58:12,794 --> 01:58:14,462
That's it. Steady.

703
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:28,267
- Make sure the horses are saddled.
- Yes, Excellence.

704
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:30,811
I'll join you in a few minutes.

705
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:49,205
- Do you really think you can escape me?
- Orlov betrayed us.

706
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:52,249
I swear I knew nothing about the bomb.

707
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:58,714
We're partners, we're friends. Octopussy,
I would never do anything to hurt you.

708
01:59:11,353 --> 01:59:15,606
You left me to be killed
along with thousands of innocent people.

709
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:19,068
Octopussy.

710
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:25,574
Look. I was bringing you this.
We can make millions.

711
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:32,873
Take her. She's our ticket out of here.

712
01:59:55,689 --> 01:59:59,692
- I trust you can handle this contraption.
- It goes by hot air.

713
01:59:59,776 --> 02:00:01,443
Oh, then you can.

714
02:00:10,996 --> 02:00:14,582
- They're doing fine.
- But I don't see Octopussy.

715
02:00:31,516 --> 02:00:34,643
- There she is. She's in trouble.
- Get your hands off me.

716
02:00:35,145 --> 02:00:36,604
- I'll take her down.
- No. Up!

717
02:00:38,189 --> 02:00:42,443
Where are you going?
Look, don't be an idiot, 007. Come back.

718
02:00:51,786 --> 02:00:52,953
Kill him.

719
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:21,166
Come on.

720
02:02:22,961 --> 02:02:28,382
What are you doing? Cut it out.
We haven't time for that. Later perhaps.

721
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:55,367
Come on. Giddap.

722
02:03:10,925 --> 02:03:12,134
Come on.

723
02:04:39,639 --> 02:04:43,267
He'll kill us all. Go out and get him.

724
02:04:43,351 --> 02:04:45,978
- Out there?
- Go.

725
02:04:46,062 --> 02:04:47,437
Yes, Excellence.

726
02:06:08,102 --> 02:06:09,311
Jump!

727
02:06:34,462 --> 02:06:39,633
My government categorically denies
the incident ever occurred.

728
02:06:41,302 --> 02:06:45,806
However, we request Bond to return
one of our most historic treasures,

729
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:47,432
the Romanov Star.

730
02:06:47,517 --> 02:06:52,521
In the interests of our Anglo-Soviet
relationships, that can be arranged.

731
02:06:53,189 --> 02:06:54,940
Where is Commander Bond?

732
02:06:55,024 --> 02:07:00,862
Owing to the serious nature of his injuries,
he's still not fit enough to travel.

733
02:07:00,947 --> 02:07:05,033
In. Out. In. Out.

734
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:21,633
- I wish...
- What?

735
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:26,930
I wish you weren't
in such a weakened condition.

736
02:07:36,649 --> 02:07:37,899
James!

02:07:47,924 --> 02:07:48,209
