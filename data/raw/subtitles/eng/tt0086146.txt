00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,883
"TO THEMSELVES
AND TO THE COMPANY."

533
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,719
I'LL BE ABOUT
TEN MINUTES.

534
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,354
YES, SIR.

535
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,523
HERE WE ARE.

536
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:35,627
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

537
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,298
THE INTERIOR'S FINE.

538
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,234
WHAT'S UNDER THAT HOOD, RAY?

539
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,669
NOW, YOU WOULDN'T SELL ME
A RINGER, WOULD YA?

540
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,639
NO, SAM O'BRIEN'S
METICULOUS.

541
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,808
HE ISN'T OUT ON THE ROAD
ALL THAT MUCH.

542
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:52,444
I'LL MENTION IT TO GREG.

543
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,212
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

544
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:57,115
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS,
 RAY.

545
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,054
DIDN'T I READ THAT YOU'RE INTO
AN EXPANSION PROGRAM

546
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,856
AT GRACE COVENANT?

547
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,591
YEAH, WE'RE IN
THE PLANNING STAGES.

548
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,927
I CHAIR THE BUILDING COMMITTEE.

549
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,697
I COULDN'T SEE MYSELF
IN THAT POSITION.

550
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:17,836
WELL, MOST OF
THE ATTENTION'S

551
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,337
ON THE GRAHAM CRUSADE
RIGHT NOW.

552
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,306
SO, THE HASSLE'S
MINIMIZED.

553
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,042
YOU HAVE PEOPLE INVOLVED
IN THAT?

554
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:25,276
OH, YEAH.

555
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,911
WE HAVE CLASSES
TWICE A WEEK.

556
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,314
COUNSELOR, CHOIR,
USHER...

557
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,119
YOU KNOW, 32 YEARS AGO,
GRAHAM WAS IN PORTLAND,

558
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,387
ONE OF HIS FIRST CRUSADES.

559
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,023
THEY PUT UP
THIS TEMPORARY BUILDING

560
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,227
BECAUSE NO PLACE IN TOWN
COULD HANDLE THE PEOPLE.

561
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:46,931
AND MY FATHER
POUNDED NAILS FOR THEM.

562
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,834
I WENT ALONG JUST TO SEE
WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT,

563
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,505
JESUS BECAME REAL TO ME
DURING THOSE MEETINGS.

564
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:56,908
SUMMER OF 1950.

565
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,711
I WAS JUST HEADING
TO COLLEGE.

566
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,916
I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT THAT, RAY.

567
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,020
[laughter]

568
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,742
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR
I MIGHT HELP YOU FIND?

569
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,877
NO, THANK YOU, JUST...

570
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,815
OH, EXCUSE ME,
IS THIS YOUR BOOK?

571
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,517
YES, IT IS, MY FIRST.

572
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,719
HOPE IT ISN'T MY LAST.

573
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,923
"IN GLASS HOUSES,"
I LIKE THAT TITLE.

574
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,558
THANK YOU.

575
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:51,563
IT'S NOT DOING
TOO BADLY, SO FAR,

576
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,131
KNOCK WOOD.

577
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,766
SOME FAVORABLE REVIEWS.

578
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,935
WELL, THE SYNOPSIS
 IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

579
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,604
ONE REVIEWER REFERRED TO IT
AS A KIND OF LEWIS

580
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,640
AND CLARK EXPEDITION
THROUGH THE MODERN SOUL.

581
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,677
YOU KNOW, HOW ONE BREAKS OUT
IN ONE'S OWN WAY.

582
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,980
WHO COULD RESIST THAT?

583
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,215
I'LL TAKE A COPY.

584
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,683
THANK YOU.

585
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:15,887
HAVE YOU SEEN THE NOTICE
FOR OUR LITERATURE SEMINAR?

586
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:17,689
NO.

587
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,557
IF YOU'D LIKE TO,

588
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,594
WE MEET HERE ONCE A WEEK.

589
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,598
JUST A FEW LOCAL PEOPLE,
THE ODD LITERATI.

590
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,300
I GIVE A SHORT TALK
AND THEN WE DISCUSS

591
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,401
OUR FEELINGS.

592
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,502
I WAS A LIT. MAJOR.

593
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:32,837
GREAT FUN.

594
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,239
'COURSE,
IT WAS SOME TIME AGO.

595
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,508
I THINK YOU'D FIND IT
QUITE STIMULATING.

596
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,811
MAY I AUTOGRAPH YOUR BOOK?

597
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,279
OH, YES, PLEASE DO.

598
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,714
MAY I HAVE YOUR NAME?

599
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,383
ANNE, ANNE STUART.

600
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,851
AHH, GOOD SCOTTISH NAME.

601
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,587
(Laura)
I CAN'T STAND
THE SIGHT OF BLOOD.

602
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:50,922
I KNOW IT'S SO STUPID.

603
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:53,291
I'M SQUEAMISH,
BUT HE'S GOT THIS AWFUL CUT.

604
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:54,492
WERE YOU STUDYING?

605
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,994
OF COURSE YOU WERE.

606
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:10,241
WELL, THAT'S GOT IT STOPPED,

607
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:16,180
BUT WE REALLY OUGHTA GET YOU
TO A CLINIC, MR. THORNHILL.

608
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,883
NO WAY!
NO CLINIC!

609
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,919
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET ME
OUT OF HERE FOR MONTHS!

610
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,756
IF THEY SEE I'M GONE,
THEY'LL LOCK ME OUT!

611
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,358
WHO'D LOCK YOU OUT?

612
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,527
THE SWINE WHO OWNS
THIS PLACE,

613
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,162
OR ONE OF HIS STOOGES.

614
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:34,966
SINCE HIS LAST INCREASE,
I'M, I'M SHORT EACH MONTH.

615
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,535
NOW, YOU PAY
OR YOU GET OUT.

616
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,670
YOU UNDERSTAND, HUH?

617
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,737
COMPRENDO?

618
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,639
TELL YOUR GARLIC BREATH
HUSBAND

619
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,708
HE BETTER STEAL YOU
SOME MORE MONEY, HUH?

620
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,642
(woman)
 NO COMPRENDO...

621
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:45,843
[door slams]

622
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,578
THAT'S REAL NICE,

623
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,013
ATTACKING PEOPLE AT NIGHT.

624
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,114
YOU DO THAT OFTEN?

625
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,716
WELL, I GOTTA DO IT

626
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,451
WHEN THE FOOD STAMP
AND THE WELFARE
OFFICES ARE CLOSED.

627
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,986
WHAT'S IT TO YOU, HUH?

628
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:04,862
NICE GUY.

629
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:05,863
VERY.

630
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:08,499
YOU HUNGRY?

631
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,400
YES.

632
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,335
COME ON,

633
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,469
WE'LL HAVE DINNER,

634
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:13,004
UP TO MY FABULOUS
PENTHOUSE.

635
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,138
[laughing]

636
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,244
HOW'D YOUR FOLKS
EVER LET YOU
COME DOWN HERE?

637
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:23,081
THEY DON'T KNOW I'M HERE.

638
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:27,752
THEY THINK I'M TUCKED AWAY
IN A NICE LITTLE CONDO.

639
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,021
I RENTED IT TO
THREE UNIVERSITY GUYS

640
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,556
FOR SEVEN HUNDRED A MONTH.

641
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,291
YOU'RE KIDDING!

642
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,559
NOPE!

643
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,394
I'M MAKING MONEY!

644
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,996
THEY'LL SKIN YOU ALIVE!

645
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,898
PROBABLY.

646
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,868
BUT AT LEAST THEY'LL ADMIRE
MY SAVINGS PLAN.

647
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,237
[chuckling]

648
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,241
WHY DO YOU DO IT?

649
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,946
I WANTED TO SEE IF
I COULD MANAGE.

650
00:41:56,681 --> 00:42:00,618
I REALLY NEEDED TO KNOW
FOR ME

651
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,121
WHAT MY COMMITMENT WAS
TO CHRIST.

652
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,693
BUT I HAVE THIS
RECURRING DREAM...

653
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:16,834
YEAH, KIND OF
A SELF-RIGHTEOUS
POSTURING BEING HERE.

654
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:20,738
YOU, TOO?

655
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,841
UH-HUH.

656
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,040
AH, MERCI.

657
00:42:56,107 --> 00:43:03,381
[speaking French]

658
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:03,915
MERCI.

659
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,550
THANK YOU.

660
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:13,758
I DON'T SEE ANY CHILI.

661
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:18,663
I, UH, WAS IN THE CITY TODAY,
HAD LUNCH WITH DADDY.

662
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,865
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
HE REALIZES YET

663
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,433
HOW REALLY GOOD YOU ARE.

664
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,504
WELL, YOU'LL CONVINCE HIM.

665
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,372
WHAT I NEED TO DO
IS ARRANGE A MATCH FOR YOU

666
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,874
WITH SOME BUILT-IN P.R.,

667
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,209
THEN I CAN NUDGE DADDY.

668
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,044
UNTIL YOU BEAT
A RANKED PLAYER,

669
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,445
YOU CAN'T BE
ON THE COMPUTER.

670
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:38,783
AH, THAT THING IS A VIDEO GAME
FOR THE BUREAUCRATS.

671
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,751
IT'S JUST TENNIS
REDUCED TO NUMBERS.

672
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:44,121
SERIOUS PLAYERS CAN'T MOVE UP
WITHOUT THE COMPUTER.

673
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:49,460
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU DON'T DO WELL?

674
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,333
NOT THAT I WANNA DO.

675
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,936
HOW ARE YOU AT CONTACT SPORTS?

676
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:04,008
THAT USUALLY MEANT
PLAYING WITH THE BIG KIDS.

677
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:06,143
I TEND TO DROP BACK AND

678
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,378
PUNT.

679
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,592
ANNE?

680
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:22,793
HMM?

681
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:29,367
HONEY, IT'S ONE-TWENTY-THREE.

682
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:34,038
SORRY, HONEY,

683
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:34,438
DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS SO LATE.

684
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,752
[voice over loudspeaker]
 THE LINESMAN HAS CORRECTLY
 RULED THE BALL OUT.

685
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,687
THE SCORE IS THIRTY-ALL.

686
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,701
[applause]

687
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:06,504
ADVANTAGE, MR. STUART--

688
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:07,505

689
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:45,076
[applause]

690
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:47,411
GAME, SET AND MATCH

691
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,380
TO MR. STUART,

692
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:53,084
SIX-FOUR, FIVE-SEVEN,
 SIX-FOUR.

693
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:55,953
CONGRATULATIONS!

694
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,254
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT!

695
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:00,925
CONGRATULATIONS,

696
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,159
THANK YOU.

697
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,767
DADDY, I'D LIKE YOU

698
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,002
HOW DO YOU DO?

699
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,703
A STRONG GAME REALLY
WHETS MY APPETITE.

700
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,506
YOUR STRATEGY OUT THERE
WAS MOST IMPRESSIVE.

701
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:16,774
THANK YOU, SIR.

702
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:19,143
I UNDERSTAND MY DAUGHTER
IS YOUR REPRESENTATIVE,

703
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,245
SO WE'LL BE

704
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,313
MEETING AGAIN.

705
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:23,848
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

706
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,950
GREG, LEMME GET ONE MORE SHOT
OF ALL THREE OF YOU, PLEASE.

707
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:28,786
[camera clicks repeatedly]

708
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,589

883
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,699
[car accelerates]

884
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,706
AH!

885
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:59,396
[breathing heavily]

886
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,605
[phone rings]

887
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:14,578
HELLO?

888
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:16,313
ANNE?

889
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:19,283
DARLING, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING OVER MY SCHEDULE.

890
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,153
THIS WEEK IS GOING TO BE
ABSOLUTELY CHAOTIC.

891
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,455
I, I'M GOING TO BE
LATE IN TOWN

892
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:28,425
TUESDAY AND THURSDAY.

893
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,060
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

894
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:32,696
ANNE?

895
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,031
[phone disconnects]

896
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:35,933
ANNE?

897
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,212
(Riley)
THE THING THAT IS
SO REMARKABLE

898
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:51,315
ABOUT KOSINSKY'S WRITING
IS THAT ENGLISH

899
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:53,483
IS NOT HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE.

900
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:56,019
OH, EXCUSE ME.

901
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,654
UH, PLEASE SIT DOWN.

902
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,359
ANY OTHER POLYGLOT AUTHORS
COME TO MIND?

903
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,962
(woman)
 UH, WHO WROTE LORD JIM?

904
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,065
UH, CONRAD, JOSEPH CONRAD,
 ANOTHER POLE.

905
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,199
(Riley)
 WELL...

906
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,567
IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHERE

907
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:11,668
ALL THE POLISH JOKES
 COME FROM, DOESN'T IT?

908
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,070
[laughter]

909
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:15,672
NOW, HOW ABOUT, UH,

910
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,108
HOW ABOUT MODERNITY
IN LITERATURE?

911
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,978
SOME PEOPLE THINK
 THAT EVERYTHING NOW

912
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,946
IS TRASH
AND OTHER CRITICS CONTEND

913
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,214
THAT WE'RE IN
 A "GOLDEN AGE."

914
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:25,515
ANY OPINIONS?

915
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:27,718
HMM?

916
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,186
ANNE STUART?

917
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,993
WELL, I THINK THAT HAS TO
BE LEFT TO POSTERITY.

918
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,762
SURVIVAL IS A BIG TEST
IN LITERATURE.

919
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:41,398
THAT'S A GOOD POINT,
GOOD POINT.

920
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:45,235
YES, THE GOLDEN AGE COULD BE
AN ADVERTISING GIMMICK.

921
00:56:45,302 --> 00:56:47,404
[chuckling]

922
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:49,306
LOOK AT, UM, C.S. LEWIS.

923
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:51,875
EVERYTHING HE WROTE,
OR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING,

924
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,076
IS STILL IN PRINT,

925
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:54,478
AND, AND SELLING.

926
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:57,547
MY SON EVEN USED
 ONE OF HIS TEXTS IN COLLEGE.

927
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:01,251
CAN ANY OF YOU IMAGINE
OUR GRANDCHILDREN

928
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:05,255
DOING POST GRADUATE WORK ON
VALLEY OF THE DOLLS?

929
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:09,626
[laughter and applause]

930
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,837
[thud]

931
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,108
EL?

932
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,878
DID I DREAM,
OR DID I HEAR SOMETHING?

933
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:42,826
GREG?

934
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:46,663
[Greg sighs]

935
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,432
WHAT'S THE TROUBLE?

936
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,933
[slurring] HI, DAD.

937
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,234
YOU WANNA TALK?

938
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,303
YOU WANNA UPDATE MY FILE?

939
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,738
YOUR MOTHER AND I WERE ASLEEP!

940
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,173
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING,

941
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,176
OR SMOKING?

942
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:03,347
(Greg)
YOU FORGOT THE SNORTING
AND SHOOTING, DIDN'T YA?

943
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:04,681
(Elton)
 DOES THE IVY GATE CLUB

944
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:06,116
KNOW THAT ITS HOT-SHOT PRO
IS AN UP AND COMING

945
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:07,050
WINO?

946
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,920
THAT'S GOOD, DAD.

947
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,355
THAT'S A REAL ZINGER.

948
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,090
(Elton)
I DON'T KNOW, GREG.

949
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:16,727
YOU HAVE A REAL TALENT
FOR UPSETTING PEOPLE.

950
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,364
I DON'T KNOW, DAD.

951
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,200
IF YOU WANNA BE UPSET
ABOUT MY BEING AN ADULT,

952
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:26,636
I MEAN, THERE'S NOT MUCH
I CAN DO ABOUT THAT,

953
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,105
IS THERE, NOW?

954
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,807
YOU CAN ACKNOWLEDGE 20 YEARS
OF EVERY POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE!

955
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,910
PRIVILEGES THAT WERE BOTH
COSTLY AND PAID FOR!

956
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:36,346
YOU CAN ACKNOWLEDGE
YOUR CHRISTIAN BACKGROUND

957
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:38,782
AND THE FACT THAT YOUR FAMILY
DESERVES MORE FROM YOU

958
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,118
THAN JUST BOOZE AND DOPE!

959
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,756
LOOK, THIS FAMILY HAS
ONLY PRODUCED ONE
FOR-SURE CHRISTIAN

960
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,257
AND IT'S NOT YOU!

961
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:49,159
WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS
MORE ON THE

962
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:50,594
ORNAMENTAL SIDE

963
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,662
WITH JUST A TINGE
OF HYPOCRISY.

964
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,565
[slap]

965
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:18,455
[door slams]

966
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:31,635
EL?

967
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:33,670
HUH?

968
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:35,505
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

969
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,808
THE TRUTH?

970
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,443
YEAH.

971
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:44,648
AN INTERESTING
STATISTIC CAME ACROSS
MY DESK LAST WEEK.

972
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,219
MUTUAL LIFE ESTIMATES
THAT THE COST OF REPLACING

973
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:50,921
A BURNED-OUT EXECUTIVE

974
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:54,691
RANGES BETWEEN
TWO-HUNDRED-AND-FIFTY

975
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,426
TO FIVE-HUNDRED-THOUSAND
DOLLARS.

976
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,432
I WAS JUST WONDERING
HOW MUCH I'M STILL WORTH.

977
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,948
GREG? YOU UP HONEY,
IT'S ALMOST NINE.

978
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:12,736
(Anne voiceover)
 OH, GOD, LISTEN TO ME.

979
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,909
WHEN MY HEART IS FAINT
 AND OVERWHELMED,

980
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,245
LEAD ME TO THE MIGHTY
 TOWERING ROCK OF SAFETY

981
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,115
WHERE YOU ARE MY REFUGE.

982
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:45,769
ANNE!

983
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:46,970
ANNE!

984
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,573
HOW GOOD TO SEE YOU!

985
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,875
I WAS JUST SLIPPING OUT
FOR LUNCH.

986
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:54,578
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME?

987
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:57,047
NO, I WAS JUST PASSING BY,
SHOPPING.

988
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:58,214
OH, PLEASE.

989
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,283
I'M IN NEED
OF SOME GOOD CONVERSATION.

990
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:04,187
[laughing]

991
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,790
YOU READ MORE THAN
SOME WRITERS I KNOW.

992
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,259
YOU'RE BLUSHING.

993
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,031
YOU REALLY LIFTED
MY DAY, ANNE.

994
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:21,504
AND, UH, YOU SEE THIS
AS PART OF YOUR MINISTRY.

995
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,907
WELL, PEOPLE SHOULD
HAVE SHELTER.

996
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:25,976
IT'S A BASIC HUMAN NEED.

997
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,411
THE NUMBERS FOR THE CITY
ORDINANCES ARE HERE,

998
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:29,713
AND SOME PHONE NUMBERS
TO CALL.

999
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,949
WHAT GETS ME IS DUMPS
LIKE THIS BECOMING CONDOS!

1000
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:35,986
THEY'LL FIX 'EM UP
FOR SURE.

1001
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,455
UH...ENGLISH?

1002
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:39,889
NO ENGLISH.

1003
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:42,359
[miscellaneous chattering]

1004
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,627
CHINESE?

1005
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,565
WELL, GOD BLESS YOU.

1006
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,345
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1007
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:04,247
HI! I JUST WANTED
TO INFORM YOU OF YOUR RIGHTS

1008
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:05,949
AS A TENANT
UNDER THE CITY ORDINANCES.

1009
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:07,584
NO PEDDLERS!

1010
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:09,252
CAN'T YA READ?

1011
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:11,421
I ASKED THIS GUY
THIS MORNING

1012
01:03:11,488 --> 01:03:13,890
WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT
ALL THIS APATHY DOWN HERE.

1013
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,825
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?

1014
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:17,494
"I DON'T CARE."

1015
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,162
[laughter]

1016
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:21,264
(man)
 I GOT SOME QUESTIONS
 ABOUT THIS.

1017
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:32,175
COME IN.

1018
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:34,778
OH...GREAT.

1019
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,113
WELL, THAT ANSWERS
MY QUESTION
RIGHT AWAY.

1020
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:39,282
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

1021
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:42,686
HEY, YOU HAVE SOME OBJECTION
TO, UH, PROPERTY OWNERS

1022
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:44,421
DOIN' AS THEY PLEASE
WITH THEIR OWN PROPERTY?

1023
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,057
WELL, SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT THEY HAVE RIGHTS, TOO.

1024
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:48,391
WHAT DO YOU CARE FOR, HUH?

1025
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:49,793
WHAT ARE YOU, PART GOOK?

1026
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:51,194
YOU SURE DON'T
LOOK LIKE A NIGGER.

1027
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,696
MAN, WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' HERE?

1028
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,330
LOOK, THERE ARE LAWS.

1029
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,166
I MEAN, LANDLORDS
CAN'T JUST COME WALKIN'...

1030
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,133
HEY!

1031
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,803
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE CAN DO.

1032
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:04,274
AND LET IT LAY
RIGHT THERE.

1033
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:09,612
[sighs]

1034
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,147
KID, I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GONNA BE
TALKIN' AGAIN.

1035
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,654
GOOD.

1036
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:25,495
THAT'S IT, STEP IN...

1037
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:28,865
GET IT BACK,
COME THROUGH...

1038
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,174
SHE'S NEW.

1039
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:39,576
JANIS RITCHIE.

1040
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,478
SHE BOOKED INSTRUCTION
FROM THREE TO FIVE,

1041
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,246
FOR TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT.

1042
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:44,981
OKAY!

1043
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:46,549
OKAY!

1044
01:04:47,784 --> 01:04:51,254
HMM, MAYBE SHE'LL
STRAIN SOMETHING.

1045
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:54,624
OKAY! GOOD!
THAT'S IT.

1046
01:04:58,161 --> 01:04:59,829
TOMORROW AT THREE, OKAY?

1047
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,298
YEAH, UH, DON'T YOU
WANT SOME TIME

1048
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,600
TO PRACTICE ON YOUR OWN?

1049
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,034
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD
ONLY SCHEDULE

1050
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,069
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK.

1051
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:07,237
WHY?

1052
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:08,705
WELL, WITH ALL
THESE LESSONS

1053
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:10,807
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
THINK YOU'RE IN
SERIOUS COMPETITION.

1054
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:12,942
MAYBE I AM.

1055
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:14,310
SEE YA LATER.

1056
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:20,183
GREG?

1057
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:21,417
YEAH?

1058
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,520
I'M THINKING OF TAKING YOU
OFF INSTRUCTION.

1059
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,522

01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:38,259
BY THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE
AND THEIR OWN WISDOM.

1409
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:41,296
BY WISDOM
MAN CANNOT KNOW GOD.

1410
01:31:41,363 --> 01:31:45,066
GOD IS BEYOND
OUR HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.

1411
01:31:45,133 --> 01:31:47,635
BUT GOD HAS REVEALED HIMSELF
TO US,

1412
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:51,573
IN NATURE,
IN YOUR CONSCIENCE WITHIN,

1413
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:53,675
AND IN THIS BOOK,
AND MORE PERFECTLY,

1414
01:31:53,742 --> 01:31:56,444
IN THE PERSON
OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.

1415
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,749
I WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD
ONE DAY WITH ONE OF MY SONS

1416
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:01,983
WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE

1417
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:03,385
AND WE STEPPED ON
AN ANT HILL,

1418
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:07,322
AND A LOT OF ANTS DIED AND
A LOT OF THEM WERE WOUNDED,

1419
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:10,425
AND I WANTED TO TEACH HIM
A LESSON AND I SAID,

1420
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,360
WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL
IF WE COULD GO DOWN THER

1421
01:32:12,427 --> 01:32:14,329
AND CRAWL AROUND AMONG THEM
 AND TELL THEM

1422
01:32:14,396 --> 01:32:15,964
THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY
 MEAN TO DO THIS

1423
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,966
AND HELP THEM
 REBUILD THEIR HOUSE

1424
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:19,334
AND BURY THEIR DEAD
 AND SO FORTH.

1425
01:32:19,401 --> 01:32:21,469
AND HE SAID THAT
 IT SURE WOULD

1426
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,605
BUT HE SAID, WE'RE TOO BIG
AND THEY'RE TOO LITTLE.

1427
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:25,974
AND I SAID,
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

1428
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,609
GOD LOOKED UPON
THIS LITTLE PLANET,

1429
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:29,778
THIS LITTLE SPECK OF DUST,

1430
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:32,013
AND SAW THESE
LITTLE CREATURES

1431
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,182
CALLED MEN AND WOMEN,

1432
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:38,086
WALKING AROUND, LOST,
AWAY FROM HIM.

1433
01:32:38,153 --> 01:32:40,355
HOW COULD HE COMMUNICATE
WITH THEM?

1434
01:32:40,522 --> 01:32:41,856
THE MIGHTY GOD OF HEAVEN?

1435
01:32:44,426 --> 01:32:45,393
I SAID, WOULDN'T IT BE
WONDERFUL

1436
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,528
IF WE COULD BECOME AN ANT

1437
01:32:49,164 --> 01:32:50,665
FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES
AND HELP THEM?

1438
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:52,867
HE SAID, YES,
I THINK IT WOULD.

1439
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:55,603
I SAID,
THAT'S WHAT GOD DID.

1440
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,872
GOD BECAME A MAN!

1441
01:32:59,707 --> 01:33:00,942
GOD BECAME A MAN,

1442
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:02,477
AND THAT'S WHO
JESUS CHRIST WAS,

1443
01:33:02,544 --> 01:33:03,678
THE GOD-MAN.

1444
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:08,082
HE CAME FOR THE PURPOSE
 OF DYING.

1445
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:11,986
HE CAME TO PERFORM
 THE GREATEST WORK THAT ANYONE

1446
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:13,955
HAD EVER DONE
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

1447
01:33:14,022 --> 01:33:15,089
HE CAME TO

1448
01:33:15,156 --> 01:33:16,558
TAKE OUR SINS
 ON THE CROSS,

1449
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:19,594
TO TAKE OUR JUDGMENT
 AND OUR HELL ON THAT CROSS.

1450
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:21,896
AND THAT'S WHY
 ALL OVER THE WORLD

1451
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:23,865
YOU SEE A CROSS
 ON EVERY CHRISTIAN CHURCH

1452
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:26,334
BECAUSE THE CROSS
 IS THE HEART

1453
01:33:26,401 --> 01:33:28,102
OF WHAT THIS BIBLE TEACHES.

1454
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:30,071
AND IN THAT MOMENT,

1455
01:33:30,138 --> 01:33:32,273
WHEN HE SAID, "MY GOD,
 MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU

1456
01:33:32,407 --> 01:33:33,708
"FORSAKEN ME?"--

1457
01:33:33,775 --> 01:33:36,110
IN THAT SUPREME MOMENT
THAT NONE OF US

1458
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:37,545
CAN PENETRATE,

1459
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,681
NO THEOLOGIAN IN THE WORLD
 HAS EVER BEEN ABLE

1460
01:33:39,747 --> 01:33:41,316
TO COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND--

1461
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:44,352
GOD TOOK ALL THE SINS
OF THE WHOLE WORLD

1462
01:33:44,419 --> 01:33:46,254
AND LAID THEM
UPON CHRIST.

1463
01:33:46,321 --> 01:33:51,192
HE LITERALLY WENT TO HELL
IN YOUR PLACE.

1464
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:54,329
NO WONDER THE BIBLE SAYS

1465
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:56,364
GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD!

1466
01:33:56,431 --> 01:33:59,634
THINK OF SUCH LOVE.

1467
01:33:59,701 --> 01:34:02,604
AND THEY PUT NAILS
IN HIS HANDS,

1468
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:04,138
AND A CROWN OF THORNS
ON HIS BROW

1469
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:06,808
AND A SPIKE THROUGH HIS FEET
AND HE HUNG THERE.

1470
01:34:09,077 --> 01:34:10,411
THEY LAUGHED AT HIM AND SAID,

1471
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:12,680
HE SAVED OTHERS,
WHY DOESN'T HE SAVE HIMSELF?

1472
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,048
WHY DOESN'T HE COME DOWN
FROM THE CROSS?

1473
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:15,283
IF HE'D COME DOWN
FROM THE CROSS,

1474
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,551
YOU AND I'D NEVER MADE IT
TO HEAVEN.

1475
01:34:16,618 --> 01:34:18,486
HE STAYED ON THE CROSS

1476
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:20,121
SO YOU AND I
CAN BE IN HEAVEN.

1477
01:34:20,188 --> 01:34:21,990
AND SO WE CAN HAVE
ETERNAL LIFE

1478
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:23,525
AND HAVE OUR SINS FORGIVEN.

1479
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,460
YES, THERE'S A MYSTERY
ABOUT IT.

1480
01:34:25,527 --> 01:34:28,863
IT'S A SUPERNATURAL WORK
OF GOD IN OUR HEARTS.

1481
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:32,133
WHEN WE REPENT OF OUR SINS
AND RECEIVE CHRIST AS SAVIOR,

1482
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,335
THE BIBLE CALLS IT,
AS I SAID

1483
01:34:34,402 --> 01:34:36,037
YESTERDAY,
 BEING BORN AGAIN.

1484
01:34:36,104 --> 01:34:37,805
YOU CAN'T INHERIT IT.

1485
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:40,708
YOU CAN BE BORN
 IN A CHRISTIAN HOME,

1486
01:34:40,775 --> 01:34:42,310
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
 A CHRISTIAN.

1487
01:34:42,377 --> 01:34:45,380
YOU CAN GO TO CHURCH,
 BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

1488
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:47,282
YOU CAN BE BAPTIZED,
 THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

1489
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,584
JESUS SAID,
 YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN.

1490
01:34:53,154 --> 01:34:54,956
MANY TIMES IT'S LIKE
 NATURAL BIRTH.

1491
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:56,424
THERE'S A MOMENT
 OF CONCEPTION.

1492
01:34:56,491 --> 01:34:57,525
THERE'S THE MOMENT--

1493
01:34:57,592 --> 01:34:58,693
THERE ARE MONTHS
 OF GESTATION,

1494
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,929
AND THEN THERE'S
 ACTUAL BIRTH.

1495
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:03,898
TONIGHT IT MAY BE FOR YOU
 A MOMENT OF CONCEPTION.

1496
01:35:03,965 --> 01:35:06,534
IT MAY BE ANOTHER STEP
 IN GESTATION,

1497
01:35:06,601 --> 01:35:10,271
OR IT MAY BE ACTUAL BIRTH.

1498
01:35:10,338 --> 01:35:12,340
IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO REMEMBER

1499
01:35:12,407 --> 01:35:15,209
FROM THIS NIGHT ON,
IT'S THIS...

1500
01:35:15,276 --> 01:35:18,546
THAT WHATEVER YOU'VE DONE,
WHATEVER YOU'VE THOUGHT,

1501
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:21,416
GOD LOVES YOU.

1502
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,785
WHATEVER YOUR CONDITION,

1503
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:26,020
WHOEVER YOU ARE,

1504
01:35:26,087 --> 01:35:28,923
WHATEVER FEELINGS YOU HAVE
 IN YOUR HEART RIGHT NOW,

1505
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:30,959
GOD LOVES YOU.

1506
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,997
SOME OF YOU THAT FEEL
 THE MOST TURNED OFF

1507
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:41,603
ARE THE ONES THAT GOD
MAY LOVE THE MOST HERE TONIGHT.

1508
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:43,571
AND BECAUSE HE'S GOD

1509
01:35:43,638 --> 01:35:46,374
HE CAN CONCENTRATE ON YOU
 AND YOUR NEEDS

1510
01:35:46,441 --> 01:35:47,942
AND YOUR PROBLEMS

1511
01:35:48,009 --> 01:35:50,845
AS THOUGH YOU WERE THE ONLY
 PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

1512
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:54,249
YOU'RE NOT JUST SITTING
 OR STANDING HERE TONIGHT

1513
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:56,317
IN THIS GREAT THRONG
 OF PEOPLE--

1514
01:35:56,384 --> 01:35:57,819
YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL.

1515
01:35:57,885 --> 01:36:00,121
YOU'RE HERE BY YOURSELF
BEFORE CHRIST.

1516
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:04,058
YOU'RE ALONE BEFORE HIM.

1517
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:08,162
THIS IS SOMETHING YOUR PARENTS
 CAN'T ENTER INTO WITH YOU.

1518
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:09,664
THIS IS SOMETHING
 YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND BOYFRIEND

1519
01:36:09,731 --> 01:36:11,065
CAN'T ENTER WITH YOU.

1520
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:12,467
IT'S ALONE,

1521
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:14,035
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO DIE,
 YOU DIE ALONE.

1522
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:15,303
WHEN YOU COME TO CHRIST,

1523
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:17,038
THAT'S A DECISION
 YOU HAVE TO MAKE.

1524
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,541
YOU MAY BE IN THE CHOIR,

1525
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,810
YOU MAY BE A LEADER
IN YOUR CHURCH,

1526
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:25,380
BUT DEEP IN YOUR HEART
 YOU'RE NOT SURE

1527
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:27,015
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH CHRIST,

1528
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:28,683
AND YOU WANT TO
MAKE SURE TONIGHT.

1529
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:29,951
YOU GET UP AND COME.

1530
01:36:29,984 --> 01:36:33,855
COMING FORWARD IS
AN OUTWARD ACT TO GOD AND MAN

1531
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:36,324
THAT YOU'RE MAKING
AN INWARD COMMITMENT

1532
01:36:36,391 --> 01:36:37,625
TONIGHT.

1533
01:36:40,328 --> 01:36:42,063
LET'S JUST COME IN
THE QUIETNESS AND THE SILENCE.

1534
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:43,931
I BELIEVE GOD IS HERE.

1535
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:55,243
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT
 AND YOUR HOUR WITH GOD,

1536
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:56,344
AND YOU KNOW IT.

1537
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:13,261
JESUS SAID, BEHOLD, I STAND
 AT THE DOOR OF YOUR HEART

1538
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:14,996
AND KNOCK.

1539
01:37:15,063 --> 01:37:18,599
IF ANYONE HEARS MY VOICE
 AND OPENS THE DOOR,

1540
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:20,401
I'LL COME IN.

1541
01:37:20,468 --> 01:37:23,871
THE HANDLE OF THAT DOOR
 IS ON THE INSIDE.

1542
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:26,374
YOU MUST TURN IT YOURSELF.

1543
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:28,142
NOW YOU'LL NEVER
 BE ABLE TO

1544
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:30,178
FIGURE ALL THAT OUT MAYBE
WITH YOUR MIND.

1545
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:31,579
IF COMING TO CHRIST
HAD ANYTHING

1546
01:37:31,646 --> 01:37:33,347
WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH I.Q.,

1547
01:37:33,414 --> 01:37:35,817
IT WOULD MEAN THAT GOD
 IS A RESPECTER OF PERSONS.

1548
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:51,499
SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING
 IT THE WORLD'S WAY FOR YEARS.

1549
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,235
YOU'VE TRIED IT ALL---

1550
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:57,939
YOU'VE COME UP EMPTY.

1551
01:37:58,005 --> 01:38:00,541
LET JESUS CHRIST FILL
ALL THOSE EMPTY PLACES TONIGHT.

1552
01:38:00,608 --> 01:38:02,877
WHATEVER YOUR BACKGROUND.

1553
01:38:02,944 --> 01:38:05,713
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO JOIN
A SPECIAL CHURCH TONIGHT.

1554
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:08,516
I'M ASKING YOU TO MAKE SURE
THAT CHRIST LIVES IN YOUR HEART.

1555
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:10,685
IF THERE'S A DOUBT
IN YOUR HEART,

1556
01:38:10,752 --> 01:38:12,120
YOU COME AND
MAKE SURE TONIGHT.

1557
01:38:22,764 --> 01:38:31,272
[choir hums softly]

1558
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:46,854
I WANT TO GIVE MYSELF
TO HIM...

1559
01:38:51,192 --> 01:38:53,261

GIVE MYSELF TO YOU.

 WE'VE ALL LIVED SO MANY LIVES.

1574
01:41:35,589 --> 01:41:37,491
THE GLORY OF CHRIST IS THAT

1575

HE OFFERS ABSOLUTE FREEDOM
 FROM GUILT TONIGHT.

1576
