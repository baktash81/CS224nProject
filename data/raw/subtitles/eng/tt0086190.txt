1
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:32,164
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:35,211
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:38,045
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:40,463
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,756
Stand by.

6
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,137
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,554
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:17,669
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:18,877
Sir.

10
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:58,753
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honoured.

11
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,169
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:03,790
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:06,963
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:10,513
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.

15
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,805
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:20,896
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,353
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:27,607
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:32,366
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:37,240
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.

21
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,834
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:43,246
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:47,248
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.

24
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:07,650
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,564
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:15,987
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:19,408
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,416
you'd probably short-circuit.

29
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:35,971
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

30
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:43,228
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:48,982
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:54,484
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:20,134
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,889
We'd better go.

35
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,573
R2, wait.

36
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:38,451
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:41,865
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:44,957
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:46,664
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:57,379
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:59,472
Oh, my!

42
00:07:03,438 --> 00:07:04,552
Oh, no.

43
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:11,111
Oh, my.

44
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:18,952
We bring a message
to your master, Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:24,872
And a gift.

46
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,329
What gift?

47
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:48,059
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,651
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:07,497
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:44,155
Good morning.

51
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,667
The message, R2.
The message.

52
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:03,389
<i>Greetings, Exalted One.</i>

53
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:05,805
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

54
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:09,802
<i>I am Luke Skywalker,</i>
<i>Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.</i>

55
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:13,276
<i>I know that you are powerful,</i>
<i>mighty Jabba...</i>

56
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:17,066
<i>and that your anger with Solo</i>
<i>must be equally powerful.</i>

57
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:20,980
<i>I seek an audience with Your Greatness</i>
<i>to bargain for Solo's life.</i>

58
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:27,409
<i>With your wisdom, I'm sure</i>
<i>we can work out an arrangement...</i>

59
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,248
<i>which will be mutually beneficial...</i>

60
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,045
<i>and enable us to avoid</i>
<i>any unpleasant confrontation.</i>

61
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:37,338
<i>As a token of my goodwill,</i>
<i>I present to you a gift...</i>

62
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,210
<i>these two droids.</i>

63
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:41,217
What did he say?

64
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:44,880
<i>Both are hard-working</i>
<i>and will serve you well.</i>

65
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:48,764
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,151
He's no Jedi.

67
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:03,613
There will be no bargain.

68
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:05,949
We're doomed.

69
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:13,042
I will not give up
my favourite decoration.

70
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:17,961
I like Captain Solo where he is.

71
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:21,752
R2, look. Captain Solo.

72
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:24,424
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

73
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:40,024
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

74
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:45,022
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

75
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:47,701
How horrid!

76
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,937
Good. New acquisitions.

77
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:21,690
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

78
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:23,730
I am C-3PO...

79
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:25,608
Yes or no will do.

80
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:27,236
Well, yes.

81
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:29,859
How many languages do you speak?

82
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:33,614
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily...

83
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,371
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

84
00:11:36,502 --> 00:11:39,836
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

85
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:41,755
and disintegrated him.

86
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,460
Disintegrated?

87
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:52,179
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

88
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,468
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

89
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:57,937
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

90
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,521
R2, don't leave me!

91
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,816
You're a feisty little one...

92
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,406
but you'll soon learn some respect.

93
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:13,822
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

94
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:16,661
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

95
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,648
Ah! Do that again!

96
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:46,233
I have come for the bounty
on this Wookiee.

97
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,605
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

98
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:56,908
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

99
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,496
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

100
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:07,951
Yes?

101
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:19,180
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

102
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:21,882
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

103
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,977
I want 50,000. No less.

104
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:27,766
"50,000. No less."

105
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,408
What did I say?

106
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:51,418
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

107
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,711
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

108
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:13,563
This bounty hunter
is my kind of scum...

109
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,318
fearless and inventive.

110
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:29,586
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

111
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:31,871
and I do suggest you take it.

112
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:39,053
He agrees!

113
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:31,633
Just relax for a moment.

114
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:34,391
You're free of the carbonite.

115
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:39,934
You have hibernation sickness.

116
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:44,530
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

117
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:47,943
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

118
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:52,872
Who are you?

119
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:00,334
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

120
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:05,836
I gotta get you out of here.

121
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:10,299
What's that?

122
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:14,934
I know that laugh.

123
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:22,182
Hey, Jabba.

124
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,155
Look, Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

125
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:28,152
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

126
00:20:28,284 --> 00:20:31,985
It's too late for that, Solo.

127
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:36,830
You may have been a good smuggler...

128
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:40,411
but now you're Bantha fodder.

129
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:46,093
Look...

130
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,384
Take him away.

131
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,257
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

132
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:53,882
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

133
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,971
Bring her to me.

134
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:05,067
We have powerful friends.

135
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:07,438
You're gonna regret this.

136
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:11,199
I'm sure.

137
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:17,075
I can't bear to watch.

138
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:33,140
Chewie?

139
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:36,891
Chewie, is that you?

140
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:41,428
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

141
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:44,434
What's going on?

142
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:48,565
Luke? Luke's crazy.

143
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:52,233
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

144
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,994
A Jedi knight?

145
00:21:56,873 --> 00:22:00,657
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

146
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,004
I'm all right, pal.

147
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,425
I'm all right.

148
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:05,390
I must speak with Jabba.

149
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,564
No bargain.

150
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:15,154
You will take me to Jabba now.

151
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:21,413
You serve your master well.

152
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:25,285
And you will be rewarded.

153
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:37,428
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

154
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:38,967
Master.

155
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,145
Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight.

156
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:48,519
I told you not to admit him.

157
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:50,443
I must be allowed to speak.

158
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,321
He must be allowed to speak.

159
00:23:54,157 --> 00:23:57,111
You weak-minded fool!

160
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:03,491
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

161
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:07,076
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

162
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:18,211
Your mind powers
will not work on me, boy.

163
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:20,506
Nevertheless...

164
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:23,595
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

165
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:27,560
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

166
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,644
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

167
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,980
Master Luke, you're standing on...

168
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:39,693
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

169
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:44,447
I shall enjoy watching you die.

170
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,103
Oh, no! The rancor!

171
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,115
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

172
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:13,457
They will all suffer for this outrage.

173
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:29,347
Han.

174
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:36,097
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

175
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,638
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'

176
00:28:38,775 --> 00:28:41,444
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

177
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:44,060
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

178
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,159
Oh, dear.

179
00:28:50,036 --> 00:28:53,120
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

180
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:56,284
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

181
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,042
Good. I hate long waits.

182
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:03,036
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

183
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,499
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

184
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:07,924
nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

185
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:09,252
Doesn't sound so bad.

186
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:13,256
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

187
00:29:13,393 --> 00:29:16,477
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

188
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,103
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

189
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:21,857
You should have bargained, Jabba.

190
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,152
That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.

191
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:21,417
I think my eyes are getting better.

192
00:30:21,544 --> 00:30:24,664
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

193
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:28,715
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

194
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:31,678
You're gonna die here,
you know. Convenient.

195
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:34,093
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

196
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:36,549
I've taken care of everything.

197
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,715
Great.

198
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:49,191
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

199
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,396
I'm terribly sorry.

200
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:55,451
R2, what are you doing here?

201
00:30:55,578 --> 00:30:58,614
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

202
00:30:58,748 --> 00:31:01,702
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

203
00:31:04,587 --> 00:31:06,496
I wish I had your confidence.

204
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,027
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

205
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,276
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

206
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,735
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

207
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:43,870
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

208
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:53,428
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

209
00:31:53,553 --> 00:31:56,174
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

210
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:58,097
Right?

211
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:03,470
This is your last chance.

212
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:06,105
Free us or die.

213
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:12,940
Move him into position.

214
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,380
Put him in.

215
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,290
Easy, Chewie.

216
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,718
Help!

217
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:25,682
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

218
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,235
Han, Chewie!

219
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:34,392
Lando.

220
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:43,823
Boba Fett?

221
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:47,284
Boba Fett? Where?

222
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,484
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

223
00:34:22,618 --> 00:34:23,994
I'm trying!

224
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:48,550
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

225
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:03,524
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

226
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:14,247
Gently, now.

227
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,418
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

228
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:29,726
Chewie, give me the gun.

229
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:32,853
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

230
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,973
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

231
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:36,650
A little higher!

232
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:41,813
Chewie, pull us up.

233
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:44,491
Up, Chewie. Up.

234
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:47,905
We gotta get out of here.

235
00:35:48,621 --> 00:35:50,412
Not my eyes! R2, help!

236
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,541
Quickly, R2!

237
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,033
Beast!

238
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,251
Get the gun!

239
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:03,630
Point it at the deck.

240
00:36:09,183 --> 00:36:10,725
Point it at the deck!

241
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:17,060
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly...

242
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,739
Come on.

243
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,245
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

244
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,533
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

245
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,288
<i>Hurry. The Alliance</i>
<i>should be assembled by now.</i>

246
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:21,089
- I will.
- <i>Luke, thanks.</i>

247
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:24,464
<i>Thanks for coming after me.</i>
<i>Now I owe you one.</i>

248
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,589
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

249
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,265
I have a promise to keep...

250
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:43,358
to an old friend.

251
00:38:34,537 --> 00:38:35,996
Rise, my friend.

252
00:38:42,712 --> 00:38:45,962
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

253
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,249
You've done well, Lord Vader.

254
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:55,221
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

255
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:59,096
Yes, my master.

256
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:02,517
Patience, my friend.

257
00:39:02,648 --> 00:39:05,982
In time, he will seek you out.

258
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:10,523
When he does,
you must bring him before me.

259
00:39:10,656 --> 00:39:12,945
He has grown strong.

260
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:18,746
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

261
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:20,616
As you wish.

262
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:26,249
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

263
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:54,525
That face you make...

264
00:39:55,618 --> 00:39:58,156
Look I so old to young eyes?

265
00:39:58,287 --> 00:40:00,031
No, of course not.

266
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:03,082
I do.

267
00:40:06,212 --> 00:40:08,169
Yes, I do.

268
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,832
Sick have I become.

269
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:14,926
Old and weak.

270
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,510
When 900 years old you reach...

271
00:40:21,644 --> 00:40:23,471
look as good you will not.

272
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,484
Soon will I rest.

273
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:35,733
Yes. Forever sleep.

274
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,993
Earned it I have.

275
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,789
Master Yoda, you can't die.

276
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,044
Strong am I with the Force...

277
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:48,126
but not that strong.

278
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,965
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

279
00:40:59,932 --> 00:41:01,557
That is the way of things...

280
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,893
the way of the Force.

281
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:09,689
But I need your help.

282
00:41:09,817 --> 00:41:12,984
I've come back
to complete the training.

283
00:41:13,112 --> 00:41:15,235
No more training do you require.

284
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:18,484
Already know you
that which you need.

285
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:23,863
Then I am a Jedi.

286
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,360
Not yet.

287
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,486
One thing remains...

288
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:39,951
Vader. You must confront Vader.

289
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:44,879
Then... only then...
a Jedi will you be.

290
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:48,755
And confront him you will.

291
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:54,889
Master Yoda...

292
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:01,052
is Darth Vader my father?

293
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,682
Rest I need.

294
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:08,230
Yes.

295
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:09,987
Rest.

296
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:13,864
Yoda, I must know.

297
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:20,364
Your father he is.

298
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:29,210
Told you, did he?

299
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:32,344
Yes.

300
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,469
Unexpected this is.

301
00:42:38,476 --> 00:42:39,887
And unfortunate.

302
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:43,727
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

303
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,137
No.

304
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:52,275
Unfortunate that
you rushed to face him...

305
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:54,944
that incomplete
was your training...

306
00:42:56,035 --> 00:42:59,534
that not ready
for the burden were you.

307
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,165
I'm sorry.

308
00:43:04,377 --> 00:43:09,881
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

309
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:16,672
But beware.

310
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:20,340
Anger, fear, aggression...

311
00:43:20,476 --> 00:43:23,097
the dark side are they.

312
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:27,555
Once you start down the dark path...

313
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:31,440
forever will it dominate your destiny.

314
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:40,446
Do not...

315
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:48,037
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

316
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,581
or suffer your father's fate you will.

317
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:59,094
When gone am I...

318
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:03,058
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:44:07,565 --> 00:44:11,645
The Force runs strong in your family.

320
00:44:14,155 --> 00:44:17,737
Pass on what you have learned.

321
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:29,376
There is...

322
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:32,206
another...

323
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:40,715
Skywalker.

324
00:45:41,534 --> 00:45:43,408
I can't do it, R2.

325
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,697
I can't go on alone.

326
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,992
<i>Yoda will always be with you.</i>

327
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:54,285
Obi-Wan.

328
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:03,971
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:07,965
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

330
00:46:08,102 --> 00:46:13,606
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

331
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:17,647
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

332
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:19,273
When that happened...

333
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:22,572
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.

334
00:46:23,618 --> 00:46:26,025
So what I told you was true...

335
00:46:26,162 --> 00:46:27,989
from a certain point of view.

336
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:30,578
A certain point of view?

337
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:34,575
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

338
00:46:34,712 --> 00:46:37,629
depend greatly
on our own point of view.

339
00:46:38,424 --> 00:46:41,129
Anakin was a good friend.

340
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:43,672
When I first knew him...

341
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:45,963
your father was already a great pilot...

342
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:49,717
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

343
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:53,802
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

344
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,854
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

345
00:46:57,985 --> 00:46:59,266
I was wrong.

346
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:02,111
There is still good in him.

347
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,991
He's more machine now than man...

348
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:07,075
twisted and evil.

349
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:11,036
I can't do it, Ben.

350
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:13,074
You cannot escape your destiny.

351
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:16,459
You must face Darth Vader again.

352
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:19,374
I can't kill my own father.

353
00:47:22,635 --> 00:47:25,719
Then the emperor has already won.

354
00:47:26,764 --> 00:47:29,006
You were our only hope.

355
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:32,432
Yoda spoke of another.

356
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,053
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

357
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:39,941
But I have no sister.

358
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,979
To protect you both
from the emperor...

359
00:47:43,114 --> 00:47:46,696
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

360
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:49,281
The emperor knew, as I did...

361
00:47:49,412 --> 00:47:53,112
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

362
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:55,787
they would be a threat to him.

363
00:47:55,918 --> 00:48:01,209
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

364
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:07,709
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

365
00:48:09,015 --> 00:48:11,885
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

366
00:48:12,018 --> 00:48:14,390
They do you credit...

367
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,604
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

368
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:42,757
Look at you. A general, huh?

369
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:45,966
Someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.

370
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:48,964
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

371
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:52,050
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

372
00:48:52,183 --> 00:48:54,306
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

373
00:48:55,186 --> 00:48:57,143
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

374
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:59,063
You're the respectable one, remember?

375
00:49:07,406 --> 00:49:10,460
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

376
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,027
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

377
00:49:15,164 --> 00:49:17,287
of the emperor's new battle station.

378
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:19,208
We also know
that the weapon systems...

379
00:49:19,335 --> 00:49:21,577
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

380
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:24,666
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

381
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:26,293
in a vain effort to engage us...

382
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:28,299
it is relatively unprotected.

383
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:30,467
But most important of all...

384
00:49:31,389 --> 00:49:33,298
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

385
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:35,555
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

386
00:49:35,685 --> 00:49:38,140
of the construction
of this Death Star.

387
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:43,482
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

388
00:49:45,638 --> 00:49:47,247
Admiral Ackbar, please.

389
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:52,613
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

390
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:58,200
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

391
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:01,832
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

392
00:50:03,129 --> 00:50:05,417
It is protected by an energy shield...

393
00:50:05,548 --> 00:50:09,166
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

394
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:18,556
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

395
00:50:19,979 --> 00:50:23,893
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

396
00:50:24,025 --> 00:50:26,942
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

397
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:30,023
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

398
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:35,909
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

399
00:50:36,037 --> 00:50:37,317
Good luck.

400
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,913
You're gonna need it.

401
00:50:41,174 --> 00:50:42,750
General Madine.

402
00:50:43,794 --> 00:50:46,712
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

403
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:51,051
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

404
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:55,969
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

405
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,343
Sounds dangerous.

406
00:50:57,475 --> 00:50:59,763
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

407
00:50:59,894 --> 00:51:02,895
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

408
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:06,939
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

409
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:10,186
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

410
00:51:12,657 --> 00:51:16,606
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

411
00:51:16,744 --> 00:51:18,653
I'm with you too.

412
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,295
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

413
00:51:28,339 --> 00:51:31,044
Hi, Han, Chewie.

414
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:34,632
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

415
00:51:50,236 --> 00:51:53,272
Look, I want you to take her.

416
00:51:53,406 --> 00:51:54,948
I mean it. Take her.

417
00:51:55,074 --> 00:51:58,490
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

418
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,944
All right, old buddy.

419
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,073
I know what she means to you.

420
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:06,908
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

421
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,623
All right?

422
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:11,036
Right.

423
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:20,504
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

424
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:22,800
Would you get going, you pirate?

425
00:52:24,562 --> 00:52:25,724
Good luck.

426
00:52:25,855 --> 00:52:27,349
You too.

427
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,448
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

428
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,738
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

429
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:57,008
Hey, you awake?

430
00:52:57,136 --> 00:53:00,587
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

431
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:05,097
Come on, General. Let's move.

432
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:08,561
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

433
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,896
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

434
00:53:13,444 --> 00:53:15,235
Here we go again.

435
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,158
All right, hang on.

436
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:46,966
What is thy bidding, my master?

437
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:51,389
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

438
00:53:54,402 --> 00:53:58,980
There it will stay until called for.

439
00:54:00,366 --> 00:54:04,411
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

440
00:54:04,537 --> 00:54:06,529
It is of no concern.

441
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:11,578
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

442
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,502
Your work here is finished, my friend.

443
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:16,299
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

444
00:54:16,424 --> 00:54:18,333
Yes, my master.

445
00:54:34,066 --> 00:54:37,103
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

446
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:42,033
<i>We have you on our screen now.</i>
<i>Please identify.</i>

447
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:47,402
Shuttle <i>Tydirium</i> requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.

448
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:57,130
Shuttle <i>Tydirium,</i> transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.

449
00:54:58,549 --> 00:54:59,960
Transmission commencing.

450
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:03,093
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

451
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:06,380
It'll work. It'll work.

452
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,925
Vader's on that ship.

453
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:11,887
Don't get jittery, Luke.

454
00:55:12,021 --> 00:55:14,227
There are a lot of command ships.

455
00:55:15,316 --> 00:55:18,899
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

456
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:22,610
I don't know. Fly casual.

457
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,744
Where is that shuttle going?

458
00:55:30,623 --> 00:55:32,912
Shuttle <i>Tydirium,</i>
what is your cargo and destination?

459
00:55:34,919 --> 00:55:36,958
<i>Parts and technical crew</i>
<i>for the forest moon.</i>

460
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:41,794
Do they have a code clearance?

461
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:44,835
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

462
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:46,928
I was about to clear them.

463
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:54,011
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

464
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:56,435
It's your imagination, kid.

465
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:59,317
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

466
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:08,910
Shall I hold them?

467
00:56:09,996 --> 00:56:12,866
No. Leave them to me.

468
00:56:12,999 --> 00:56:15,287
I will deal with them myself.

469
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:18,375
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

470
00:56:20,256 --> 00:56:22,130
They're not going for it, Chewie.

471
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:28,053
<i>Shuttle</i> Tydirium...

472
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,553
<i>deactivation of the shield</i>
<i>will commence immediately.</i>

473
00:56:30,683 --> 00:56:32,972
<i>Follow your present course.</i>

474
00:56:33,102 --> 00:56:35,593
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

475
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,892
No problem.

476
00:57:10,306 --> 00:57:12,345
I told you it was dangerous here.

477
00:57:27,782 --> 00:57:31,233
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

478
00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:34,370
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

479
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,497
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

480
00:57:39,627 --> 00:57:42,296
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

481
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:43,797
Hey...

482
00:57:43,923 --> 00:57:45,203
it's me.

483
00:58:10,825 --> 00:58:12,817
Go for help! Go!

484
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:14,446
Great. Come on!

485
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:31,968
Over there! Two more of them.

486
00:58:33,014 --> 00:58:35,302
I see them. Wait. Leia!

487
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:40,645
Hey, wait!

488
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:49,400
Quick, jam their comlink.
Centre switch.

489
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:02,619
Move closer.

490
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,546
Get alongside that one.

491
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:50,086
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

492
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:05,760
General Solo, somebody's coming.

493
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:20,229
Where's Leia?

494
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:23,524
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

495
01:02:23,661 --> 01:02:26,152
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

496
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:29,325
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

497
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:31,498
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

498
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:35,375
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

499
01:02:36,882 --> 01:02:39,005
And you said it was pretty here.

500
01:03:01,724 --> 01:03:03,597
Cut it out.

501
01:03:20,451 --> 01:03:22,527
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
01:03:30,586 --> 01:03:33,255
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

503
01:03:35,257 --> 01:03:37,546
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

504
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:40,551
Maybe you can help me.

505
01:03:41,805 --> 01:03:43,513
Come on. Sit down.

506
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:47,599
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

507
01:03:49,355 --> 01:03:51,846
All right.
You want something to eat?

508
01:03:58,614 --> 01:04:00,073
That's right.

509
01:04:04,995 --> 01:04:06,703
Come on.

510
01:04:26,934 --> 01:04:28,309
Look. It's a hat.

511
01:04:28,435 --> 01:04:30,393
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

512
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:39,484
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

513
01:04:44,785 --> 01:04:46,327
What is it?

514
01:05:25,951 --> 01:05:27,232
Freeze!

515
01:05:27,369 --> 01:05:29,576
Come on. Get up.

516
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:36,788
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

517
01:05:41,592 --> 01:05:42,754
What the...

518
01:05:59,818 --> 01:06:02,392
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

519
01:06:44,405 --> 01:06:47,275
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

520
01:06:48,993 --> 01:06:53,738
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

521
01:06:55,332 --> 01:06:57,040
Yes, I know.

522
01:06:58,586 --> 01:07:00,792
My son is with them.

523
01:07:02,464 --> 01:07:07,091
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

524
01:07:08,554 --> 01:07:11,045
Strange that I have not.

525
01:07:12,641 --> 01:07:17,849
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

526
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,732
They are clear, my master.

527
01:07:20,858 --> 01:07:25,105
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

528
01:07:25,237 --> 01:07:28,238
He will come to me?

529
01:07:30,492 --> 01:07:32,818
I have foreseen it.

530
01:07:32,953 --> 01:07:36,998
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

531
01:07:37,124 --> 01:07:41,038
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

532
01:07:41,837 --> 01:07:43,379
As you wish.

533
01:08:04,944 --> 01:08:06,354
Master Luke.

534
01:08:10,074 --> 01:08:12,825
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

535
01:08:12,952 --> 01:08:14,861
And I found this.

536
01:08:16,372 --> 01:08:20,749
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

537
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,795
I hope she's all right.

538
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:30,875
What, Chewie?

539
01:08:33,555 --> 01:08:35,382
What, Chewie?

540
01:08:49,029 --> 01:08:52,398
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

541
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:55,116
Chewie, wait! Don't!

542
01:08:59,665 --> 01:09:01,124
Nice work.

543
01:09:02,918 --> 01:09:04,745
Great, Chewie.

544
01:09:04,878 --> 01:09:06,955
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

545
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:10,256
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

546
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:12,092
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?

547
01:09:12,219 --> 01:09:13,678
Yeah. Sure.

548
01:09:20,728 --> 01:09:23,266
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

549
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:25,390
It's a very long drop!

550
01:10:08,317 --> 01:10:11,234
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

551
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:16,897
Hey!

552
01:10:17,034 --> 01:10:19,490
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

553
01:10:25,751 --> 01:10:28,207
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

554
01:10:30,297 --> 01:10:31,922
Oh, my head.

555
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:37,969
Oh, my goodness.

556
01:11:09,795 --> 01:11:11,704
Do you understand
anything they're saying?

557
01:11:11,839 --> 01:11:13,250
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

558
01:11:13,382 --> 01:11:16,169
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms...

559
01:11:16,302 --> 01:11:17,926
What are you telling them?

560
01:11:19,138 --> 01:11:21,214
"Hello," I think.

561
01:11:21,348 --> 01:11:24,385
I could be mistaken...
they're using a very primitive dialect...

562
01:11:24,518 --> 01:11:28,053
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

563
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:36,855
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

564
01:11:36,989 --> 01:11:39,860
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

565
01:11:40,868 --> 01:11:42,243
Proper?

566
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:44,991
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

567
01:11:45,122 --> 01:11:46,367
Why, you...

568
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:56,084
My mistake.

569
01:11:57,801 --> 01:11:59,759
He's an old friend of mine.

570
01:12:26,914 --> 01:12:28,289
Hey.

571
01:12:45,474 --> 01:12:47,930
I have a really bad feeling about this.

572
01:13:08,956 --> 01:13:10,534
What did he say?

573
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,991
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

574
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:16,626
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour.

575
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:36,520
Your Royal Highness.

576
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:38,394
These are my friends.

577
01:13:41,488 --> 01:13:45,700
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.

578
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:06,677
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

579
01:14:06,805 --> 01:14:10,720
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

580
01:14:10,851 --> 01:14:12,808
you'll become angry
and use your magic.

581
01:14:12,937 --> 01:14:15,309
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly...

582
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:16,981
Tell them.

583
01:14:32,915 --> 01:14:34,991
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

584
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:36,703
just as I said they wouldn't.

585
01:14:36,835 --> 01:14:38,116
Wait.

586
01:14:46,762 --> 01:14:48,636
What's happening?

587
01:14:54,061 --> 01:14:55,769
Put me down!
Help!

588
01:14:55,896 --> 01:14:57,438
Somebody!

589
01:14:57,565 --> 01:14:58,893
Somebody help!

590
01:14:59,024 --> 01:15:01,729
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

591
01:15:33,475 --> 01:15:34,851
Thank goodness.

592
01:15:47,197 --> 01:15:48,857
Thanks, 3PO.

593
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:52,074
I never knew I had it in me.

594
01:15:59,668 --> 01:16:01,127
...Tatooine...

595
01:16:02,546 --> 01:16:04,954
Princess Leia... R2.

596
01:16:07,134 --> 01:16:08,593
...Darth Vader!

597
01:16:11,722 --> 01:16:13,465
...Death Star.

598
01:16:16,477 --> 01:16:18,719
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

599
01:16:24,318 --> 01:16:26,192
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

600
01:16:29,657 --> 01:16:30,657
Master Luke...

601
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:40,949
<i>...Millennium Falcon...</i> Cloud City.

602
01:16:43,629 --> 01:16:44,708
...Vader!

603
01:16:45,756 --> 01:16:47,001
Han Solo...

604
01:16:49,176 --> 01:16:50,635
...carbon.

605
01:16:52,221 --> 01:16:53,466
...Sarlacc.

606
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:17,954
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

607
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:34,388
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

608
01:17:35,806 --> 01:17:37,680
Just what I always wanted.

609
01:17:49,486 --> 01:17:51,775
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

610
01:17:57,411 --> 01:18:00,614
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

611
01:18:00,748 --> 01:18:02,705
Good. How far is it?

612
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:04,458
Ask him.

613
01:18:05,669 --> 01:18:07,792
We need some fresh supplies too.

614
01:18:07,922 --> 01:18:09,831
Try and get our weapons back.

615
01:18:11,342 --> 01:18:13,548
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

616
01:18:16,055 --> 01:18:17,928
Luke, what's wrong?

617
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:23,301
Leia, do you remember
your mother...

618
01:18:23,437 --> 01:18:25,477
your real mother?

619
01:18:25,606 --> 01:18:29,105
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

620
01:18:29,235 --> 01:18:31,144
What do you remember?

621
01:18:31,278 --> 01:18:33,852
Just images really. Feelings.

622
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:35,567
Tell me.

623
01:18:37,284 --> 01:18:40,321
She was... very beautiful.

624
01:18:40,454 --> 01:18:43,075
Kind... but sad.

625
01:18:45,251 --> 01:18:48,038
Why are you asking me this?

626
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:50,626
I have no memory of my mother.

627
01:18:51,674 --> 01:18:53,666
I never knew her.

628
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:57,627
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

629
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,343
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

630
01:19:07,982 --> 01:19:09,690
How do you know?

631
01:19:09,817 --> 01:19:11,726
I felt his presence.

632
01:19:12,778 --> 01:19:16,028
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

633
01:19:16,156 --> 01:19:18,030
That's why I have to go.

634
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:21,610
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

635
01:19:22,663 --> 01:19:25,617
- I have to face him.
- Why?

636
01:19:30,629 --> 01:19:32,503
He's my father.

637
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,242
Your father?

638
01:19:39,536 --> 01:19:43,534
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

639
01:19:43,665 --> 01:19:46,500
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

640
01:19:46,626 --> 01:19:48,121
Don't talk that way.

641
01:19:48,253 --> 01:19:52,749
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

642
01:19:52,883 --> 01:19:54,875
You're wrong, Leia.

643
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:56,837
You have that power too.

644
01:19:56,970 --> 01:20:00,304
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

645
01:20:04,936 --> 01:20:07,178
The Force is strong in my family.

646
01:20:08,732 --> 01:20:10,641
My father has it.

647
01:20:12,069 --> 01:20:13,942
I have it.

648
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:15,399
And...

649
01:20:16,698 --> 01:20:19,070
my sister has it.

650
01:20:25,374 --> 01:20:28,493
Yes. It's you, Leia.

651
01:20:33,757 --> 01:20:35,381
I know.

652
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:39,844
Somehow...

653
01:20:41,556 --> 01:20:43,134
I've always known.

654
01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:45,224
Then you know
why I have to face him.

655
01:20:47,354 --> 01:20:49,761
Luke, run away.
Far away.

656
01:20:49,898 --> 01:20:53,232
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

657
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,610
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

658
01:20:56,738 --> 01:20:58,695
You've always been strong.

659
01:20:59,991 --> 01:21:02,280
But why must you confront him?

660
01:21:02,411 --> 01:21:06,111
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

661
01:21:06,248 --> 01:21:08,240
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

662
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:11,495
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

663
01:21:12,921 --> 01:21:14,712
I have to try.

664
01:21:33,133 --> 01:21:35,042
Hey, what's going on?

665
01:21:36,845 --> 01:21:40,131
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

666
01:21:41,516 --> 01:21:43,141
Nothing?

667
01:21:44,936 --> 01:21:46,846
Tell me.
What's going on?

668
01:21:52,027 --> 01:21:54,185
I can't tell you.

669
01:21:55,822 --> 01:21:58,444
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

670
01:22:16,301 --> 01:22:17,926
I'm sorry.

671
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,348
Hold me.

672
01:23:16,653 --> 01:23:18,527
This is the rebel that surrendered.

673
01:23:18,655 --> 01:23:21,573
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

674
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:24,405
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

675
01:23:25,495 --> 01:23:28,200
He was armed only with this.

676
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:31,916
Good work, Commander.

677
01:23:32,044 --> 01:23:33,953
Leave us.

678
01:23:34,087 --> 01:23:37,752
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

679
01:23:39,217 --> 01:23:40,961
Yes, my lord.

680
01:23:42,804 --> 01:23:44,927
The emperor has been expecting you.

681
01:23:46,308 --> 01:23:47,719
I know, Father.

682
01:23:49,227 --> 01:23:51,553
So, you have accepted the truth.

683
01:23:52,731 --> 01:23:56,230
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

684
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,563
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

685
01:24:00,364 --> 01:24:03,115
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

686
01:24:03,909 --> 01:24:05,533
I know there is good in you.

687
01:24:05,661 --> 01:24:08,282
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

688
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,457
That was why
you couldn't destroy me.

689
01:24:15,504 --> 01:24:18,042
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

690
01:24:25,305 --> 01:24:28,342
I see you have constructed
a new lightsabre.

691
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:34,933
Your skills are complete.

692
01:24:40,153 --> 01:24:44,732
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

693
01:24:49,705 --> 01:24:51,448
Come with me.

694
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:56,412
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

695
01:24:57,713 --> 01:25:02,505
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

696
01:25:02,634 --> 01:25:05,386
I must obey my master.

697
01:25:06,471 --> 01:25:09,887
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

698
01:25:11,268 --> 01:25:13,841
If that is your destiny.

699
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:17,763
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

700
01:25:17,899 --> 01:25:20,521
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

701
01:25:21,778 --> 01:25:25,194
It is too late for me, son.

702
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:32,739
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

703
01:25:32,873 --> 01:25:36,491
He is your master now.

704
01:25:40,547 --> 01:25:42,955
Then my father is truly dead.

705
01:26:25,968 --> 01:26:27,877
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

706
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:30,004
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

707
01:26:30,889 --> 01:26:34,507
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

708
01:26:34,768 --> 01:26:38,500
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

709
01:26:46,113 --> 01:26:47,737
What's he saying?

710
01:26:47,864 --> 01:26:51,198
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

711
01:27:10,429 --> 01:27:13,798
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

712
01:27:14,683 --> 01:27:16,640
Proceed with the countdown.

713
01:27:17,853 --> 01:27:20,308
All groups assume attack coordinates.

714
01:27:23,692 --> 01:27:25,649
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

715
01:27:25,777 --> 01:27:28,315
He'll have that shield down on time.

716
01:27:31,283 --> 01:27:33,774
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

717
01:27:35,746 --> 01:27:39,446
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

718
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:41,540
All right. Stand by.

719
01:28:01,146 --> 01:28:03,269
Back door, huh? Good idea.

720
01:28:11,657 --> 01:28:14,611
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

721
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:22,625
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

722
01:28:22,751 --> 01:28:25,242
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

723
01:28:25,379 --> 01:28:27,870
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

724
01:28:29,216 --> 01:28:31,007
I'm afraid our furry companion...

725
01:28:31,134 --> 01:28:33,257
has gone and done something
rather rash.

726
01:28:38,767 --> 01:28:40,724
There goes our surprise attack.

727
01:28:48,026 --> 01:28:50,268
Look, over there! Stop him!

728
01:29:02,165 --> 01:29:05,202
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

729
01:29:05,335 --> 01:29:07,791
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

730
01:29:09,923 --> 01:29:12,130
I have decided that we shall stay here.

731
01:29:41,997 --> 01:29:42,997
Hey!

732
01:30:47,145 --> 01:30:49,933
Welcome, young Skywalker.

733
01:30:50,065 --> 01:30:52,390
I have been expecting you.

734
01:30:53,443 --> 01:30:55,401
You'll no longer need those.

735
01:31:00,867 --> 01:31:02,741
Guards, leave us.

736
01:31:10,168 --> 01:31:13,620
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

737
01:31:13,755 --> 01:31:18,832
In time, you will call me master.

738
01:31:18,969 --> 01:31:21,424
You're gravely mistaken.

739
01:31:21,555 --> 01:31:23,678
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

740
01:31:24,558 --> 01:31:28,306
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

741
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:34,519
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

742
01:31:35,944 --> 01:31:40,072
about a great many things.

743
01:31:41,783 --> 01:31:43,408
His lightsabre.

744
01:31:43,535 --> 01:31:47,200
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.

745
01:31:47,998 --> 01:31:50,406
Much like your father's.

746
01:31:50,542 --> 01:31:55,334
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

747
01:31:55,464 --> 01:31:58,299
So will it be with you.

748
01:31:58,425 --> 01:32:00,465
You're wrong.

749
01:32:00,594 --> 01:32:03,678
Soon I'll be dead...
and you with me.

750
01:32:07,142 --> 01:32:11,436
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

751
01:32:12,272 --> 01:32:13,683
Yes.

752
01:32:13,815 --> 01:32:18,940
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

753
01:32:20,113 --> 01:32:22,984
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

754
01:32:23,116 --> 01:32:26,236
Your faith in your friends is yours.

755
01:32:28,789 --> 01:32:32,371
It is pointless to resist, my son.

756
01:32:36,421 --> 01:32:41,878
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

757
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:45,213
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

758
01:32:45,347 --> 01:32:49,676
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

759
01:32:51,603 --> 01:32:54,094
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

760
01:32:54,231 --> 01:32:57,647
to know the location
of the shield generator.

761
01:32:57,776 --> 01:33:01,821
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

762
01:33:01,947 --> 01:33:06,194
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

763
01:33:08,704 --> 01:33:12,452
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

764
01:33:12,582 --> 01:33:17,790
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

765
01:33:21,341 --> 01:33:22,670
All right!

766
01:33:22,801 --> 01:33:24,295
Up! Move!

767
01:33:24,428 --> 01:33:25,886
Quickly. Quickly.

768
01:33:30,392 --> 01:33:32,016
Han, hurry.

769
01:33:32,144 --> 01:33:34,017
The fleet will be here any moment.

770
01:33:35,731 --> 01:33:37,972
Charges. Come on. Come on!

771
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:41,937
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

772
01:33:44,823 --> 01:33:46,531
Wait! Come back!

773
01:33:49,036 --> 01:33:50,827
R2, stay with me.

774
01:33:51,872 --> 01:33:53,496
Freeze!

775
01:33:56,877 --> 01:33:58,834
You rebel scum.

776
01:34:18,523 --> 01:34:21,892
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

777
01:34:22,027 --> 01:34:25,194
- Grey Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

778
01:34:26,073 --> 01:34:28,196
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

779
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:33,993
May the Force be with us.

780
01:34:37,584 --> 01:34:40,585
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield... up or down.

781
01:34:42,255 --> 01:34:44,925
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know...

782
01:34:45,968 --> 01:34:47,545
if we're coming.

783
01:34:47,678 --> 01:34:51,177
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

784
01:34:51,306 --> 01:34:53,382
I get no reading. You sure?

785
01:34:53,517 --> 01:34:55,675
<i>Pull up! All craft pull up!</i>

786
01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:04,140
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

787
01:35:05,988 --> 01:35:08,739
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

788
01:35:08,865 --> 01:35:10,360
It's a trap.

789
01:35:13,954 --> 01:35:15,911
Fighters coming in.

790
01:35:19,376 --> 01:35:20,704
There's too many.

791
01:35:24,047 --> 01:35:27,416
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

792
01:35:27,551 --> 01:35:28,582
Copy, Gold Leader.

793
01:35:32,014 --> 01:35:33,508
Come, boy.

794
01:35:34,391 --> 01:35:36,348
See for yourself.

795
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:44,228
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

796
01:35:44,359 --> 01:35:48,191
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

797
01:35:53,452 --> 01:35:55,777
You want this...

798
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:58,454
don't you?

799
01:35:58,582 --> 01:36:03,078
The hate is swelling in you now.

800
01:36:03,879 --> 01:36:06,037
Take your Jedi weapon.

801
01:36:06,173 --> 01:36:07,916
Use it.

802
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:10,007
I am unarmed.

803
01:36:10,135 --> 01:36:12,009
Strike me down with it.

804
01:36:12,137 --> 01:36:14,675
Give in to your anger.

805
01:36:15,724 --> 01:36:20,849
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.

806
01:36:27,444 --> 01:36:29,484
It is unavoidable.

807
01:36:30,572 --> 01:36:32,695
It is your destiny.

808
01:36:33,742 --> 01:36:36,862
You, like your father...

809
01:36:36,995 --> 01:36:38,620
are now...

810
01:36:39,539 --> 01:36:41,164
mine.

811
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:00,824
All right, move it.

812
01:37:09,653 --> 01:37:11,752
Hello. I say, over there.

813
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,397
Were you looking for me?

814
01:37:15,942 --> 01:37:17,982
Bring those two down here.

815
01:37:25,619 --> 01:37:29,913
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

816
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,368
Freeze.

817
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,614
Don't move.

818
01:37:32,751 --> 01:37:34,660
We surrender.

819
01:39:40,337 --> 01:39:42,210
The code's changed.

820
01:39:42,339 --> 01:39:44,711
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

821
01:39:44,841 --> 01:39:46,834
R2, where are you?

822
01:39:46,968 --> 01:39:48,925
We need you at the bunker
right away.

823
01:39:51,014 --> 01:39:52,508
Going? What do you mean?

824
01:39:54,426 --> 01:39:56,050
Going where, R2?

825
01:39:56,177 --> 01:40:00,389
Wait. R2, this is
no time for heroics.

826
01:40:00,515 --> 01:40:02,175
Come back!

827
01:40:28,418 --> 01:40:30,209
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

828
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:33,254
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

829
01:40:36,509 --> 01:40:38,253
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

830
01:40:38,386 --> 01:40:40,094
Cut left.
I'll take the leader.

831
01:40:48,438 --> 01:40:50,181
They're heading
for the medical frigate.

832
01:40:55,195 --> 01:40:56,393
Pressure's steady.

833
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:08,866
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

834
01:41:13,305 --> 01:41:15,013
We're in attack position, sir.

835
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:18,307
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

836
01:41:18,435 --> 01:41:21,720
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

837
01:41:21,855 --> 01:41:23,764
We only need to
keep them from escaping.

838
01:41:25,484 --> 01:41:29,564
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

839
01:41:29,696 --> 01:41:32,946
your friends have failed.

840
01:41:33,742 --> 01:41:36,114
Now witness the firepower...

841
01:41:36,244 --> 01:41:41,583
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

842
01:41:42,751 --> 01:41:45,289
Fire at will, Commander.

843
01:41:52,302 --> 01:41:54,010
Fire.

844
01:42:00,644 --> 01:42:03,182
That blast came from the Death Star.

845
01:42:04,147 --> 01:42:06,472
That thing's operational.

846
01:42:06,608 --> 01:42:08,435
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

847
01:42:08,568 --> 01:42:10,644
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

848
01:42:10,779 --> 01:42:12,985
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.

849
01:42:13,114 --> 01:42:15,866
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

850
01:42:15,992 --> 01:42:19,278
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

851
01:42:19,412 --> 01:42:23,113
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

852
01:42:41,935 --> 01:42:43,346
We're coming.

853
01:42:49,234 --> 01:42:50,562
Come on.

854
01:42:54,364 --> 01:42:55,739
R2, hurry!

855
01:43:01,788 --> 01:43:02,788
My goodness!

856
01:43:08,837 --> 01:43:10,829
Why did you have to be so brave?

857
01:43:14,009 --> 01:43:16,547
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

858
01:43:16,678 --> 01:43:18,137
I'll cover you.

859
01:43:59,721 --> 01:44:02,177
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

860
01:44:02,307 --> 01:44:05,012
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

861
01:44:05,143 --> 01:44:08,559
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

862
01:44:08,688 --> 01:44:11,310
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

863
01:44:11,441 --> 01:44:13,683
and we might
take a few of them with us.

864
01:44:16,613 --> 01:44:17,941
She's gonna blow!

865
01:44:22,035 --> 01:44:23,613
I'm hit!

866
01:44:28,792 --> 01:44:30,950
Your fleet is lost...

867
01:44:31,086 --> 01:44:35,130
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

868
01:44:37,425 --> 01:44:39,833
There is no escape...

869
01:44:39,970 --> 01:44:42,591
my young apprentice.

870
01:44:44,808 --> 01:44:47,263
The Alliance will die...

871
01:44:49,146 --> 01:44:51,981
as will your friends.

872
01:44:55,610 --> 01:44:56,891
Good.

873
01:44:57,904 --> 01:45:01,154
I can feel your anger.

874
01:45:02,909 --> 01:45:06,409
I am defenceless.
Take your weapon.

875
01:45:06,538 --> 01:45:09,658
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...

876
01:45:09,791 --> 01:45:14,287
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

877
01:45:53,585 --> 01:45:55,624
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

878
01:47:48,783 --> 01:47:50,776
I think I got it.

879
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:52,156
I got it!

880
01:47:59,461 --> 01:48:00,741
Are you all right?

881
01:48:00,879 --> 01:48:02,753
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

882
01:48:02,881 --> 01:48:04,161
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

883
01:48:04,515 --> 01:48:05,793
Don't move.

884
01:48:10,263 --> 01:48:12,968
- I love you.
- I know.

885
01:48:13,499 --> 01:48:14,617
Hands up.

886
01:48:16,069 --> 01:48:17,187
Stand up.

887
01:48:26,613 --> 01:48:28,072
Stay back.

888
01:48:35,997 --> 01:48:38,702
Get down here.
She's wounded.

889
01:48:38,834 --> 01:48:40,660
No, wait.

890
01:48:40,794 --> 01:48:42,371
I got an idea.

891
01:48:53,682 --> 01:48:55,176
Good.

892
01:48:55,308 --> 01:48:59,092
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

893
01:48:59,229 --> 01:49:01,934
Let the hate flow through you.

894
01:49:07,612 --> 01:49:11,195
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

895
01:49:14,661 --> 01:49:17,033
I will not fight you, Father.

896
01:49:31,136 --> 01:49:33,923
You are unwise
to lower your defences.

897
01:49:58,872 --> 01:50:01,280
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

898
01:50:01,416 --> 01:50:04,536
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

899
01:50:04,669 --> 01:50:07,125
There is no conflict.

900
01:50:09,508 --> 01:50:11,493
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

901
01:50:11,593 --> 01:50:13,550
and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.

902
01:50:13,678 --> 01:50:18,221
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

903
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:20,177
If you will not fight...

904
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:22,883
then you will meet your destiny.

905
01:50:34,366 --> 01:50:35,564
Good.

906
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:37,111
Good.

907
01:50:45,794 --> 01:50:49,412
- Watch out. Squad at.06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

908
01:50:51,341 --> 01:50:52,752
Good shot, Red Two.

909
01:50:56,388 --> 01:50:59,472
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

910
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:01,259
Don't let me down.

911
01:51:05,814 --> 01:51:07,273
<i>It's over, Commander.</i>

912
01:51:07,399 --> 01:51:09,724
<i>The rebels have been routed.</i>
<i>They're fleeing.</i>

913
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:12,398
<i>We need reinforcements</i>
<i>to continue the pursuit.</i>

914
01:51:13,488 --> 01:51:15,445
Send three squads to help.

915
01:51:15,574 --> 01:51:17,531
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

916
01:51:31,715 --> 01:51:33,126
Throw me another charge.

917
01:51:50,692 --> 01:51:53,479
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

918
01:51:54,738 --> 01:51:56,647
I will not fight you.

919
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:03,196
Give yourself to the dark side.

920
01:52:04,789 --> 01:52:08,834
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

921
01:52:09,878 --> 01:52:11,586
Yes.

922
01:52:11,713 --> 01:52:13,670
Your thoughts betray you.

923
01:52:13,798 --> 01:52:16,336
Your feelings for them are strong...

924
01:52:16,468 --> 01:52:18,342
especially for...

925
01:52:20,514 --> 01:52:22,174
sister.

926
01:52:23,433 --> 01:52:27,762
So you have a twin sister.

927
01:52:27,896 --> 01:52:31,596
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

928
01:52:31,733 --> 01:52:35,813
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.

929
01:52:35,946 --> 01:52:40,323
Now his failure is complete.

930
01:52:41,827 --> 01:52:45,611
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

931
01:52:45,747 --> 01:52:48,534
then perhaps she will.

932
01:52:48,667 --> 01:52:49,976
Never!

933
01:53:35,213 --> 01:53:36,921
Good!

934
01:53:41,261 --> 01:53:43,966
Your hate has made you powerful.

935
01:53:45,265 --> 01:53:50,141
Now, fulfil your destiny...

936
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:54,350
and take your father's place at my side.

937
01:54:09,414 --> 01:54:10,743
Never.

938
01:54:13,793 --> 01:54:15,952
I'll never turn to the dark side.

939
01:54:19,169 --> 01:54:21,759
You've failed, Your Highness.

940
01:54:21,885 --> 01:54:23,842
I am a Jedi...

941
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:26,010
like my father before me.

942
01:54:33,605 --> 01:54:37,056
So be it, Jedi.

943
01:54:37,275 --> 01:54:39,149
Move! Move!

944
01:54:51,790 --> 01:54:55,657
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

945
01:54:55,794 --> 01:54:59,542
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

946
01:54:59,673 --> 01:55:01,582
I told you they'd do it.

947
01:55:08,723 --> 01:55:11,345
If you will not be turned...

948
01:55:11,476 --> 01:55:14,810
you will be destroyed.

949
01:55:21,987 --> 01:55:23,564
Young fool.

950
01:55:24,656 --> 01:55:27,361
Only now, at the end...

951
01:55:27,492 --> 01:55:29,366
do you understand.

952
01:55:42,591 --> 01:55:48,344
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

953
01:55:52,184 --> 01:55:56,016
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

954
01:56:01,610 --> 01:56:03,436
Father, please!

955
01:56:18,752 --> 01:56:20,910
Now, young Skywalker...

956
01:56:23,048 --> 01:56:24,875
you will die.

957
01:57:47,632 --> 01:57:49,091
I'm going in.

958
01:57:52,262 --> 01:57:53,460
Here goes nothing.

959
01:58:00,562 --> 01:58:04,429
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

960
01:58:06,651 --> 01:58:10,103
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

961
01:58:25,795 --> 01:58:27,788
Split up and head back to the surface.

962
01:58:27,923 --> 01:58:31,089
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

963
01:58:31,218 --> 01:58:32,218
Copy, Gold Leader.

964
01:58:42,479 --> 01:58:44,056
That was too close.

965
01:58:48,068 --> 01:58:50,226
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

966
01:58:50,362 --> 01:58:53,398
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Stardestroyer.

967
01:58:59,538 --> 01:59:01,661
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

968
01:59:01,790 --> 01:59:04,791
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

969
01:59:07,295 --> 01:59:09,039
Intensify forward firepower!

970
01:59:10,882 --> 01:59:12,080
Too late!

971
01:59:57,179 --> 02:00:01,046
Help me take this mask off.

972
02:00:01,183 --> 02:00:03,056
But you'll die.

973
02:00:03,935 --> 02:00:07,435
Nothing can stop that now.

974
02:00:08,523 --> 02:00:10,148
Just for once...

975
02:00:11,109 --> 02:00:12,734
let me...

976
02:00:12,861 --> 02:00:16,312
look on you with my own eyes.

977
02:00:52,567 --> 02:00:56,945
Now go, my son.

978
02:00:58,657 --> 02:01:00,067
Leave me.

979
02:01:01,159 --> 02:01:03,615
No. You're coming with me.

980
02:01:03,745 --> 02:01:06,070
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

981
02:01:06,957 --> 02:01:10,657
You already have, Luke.

982
02:01:11,837 --> 02:01:13,710
You were right.

983
02:01:14,506 --> 02:01:16,831
You were right about me.

984
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,551
Tell your sister...

985
02:01:21,596 --> 02:01:23,803
you were right.

986
02:01:30,897 --> 02:01:31,976
Father.

987
02:01:36,319 --> 02:01:37,648
I won't leave you.

988
02:02:03,096 --> 02:02:04,096
There it is.

989
02:02:07,058 --> 02:02:09,431
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

990
02:02:09,561 --> 02:02:12,846
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

991
02:02:32,083 --> 02:02:35,203
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.

992
02:03:22,691 --> 02:03:24,085
They did it!

993
02:03:32,561 --> 02:03:34,968
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

994
02:03:36,631 --> 02:03:38,458
He wasn't.

995
02:03:38,592 --> 02:03:40,252
I can feel it.

996
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:46,678
You love him.

997
02:03:50,105 --> 02:03:51,516
Don't you?

998
02:03:51,649 --> 02:03:53,107
Yes.

999
02:03:53,234 --> 02:03:55,938
All right. I understand.

1000
02:03:56,070 --> 02:03:57,445
Fine.

1001
02:03:58,489 --> 02:04:00,280
When he comes back...

1002
02:04:01,367 --> 02:04:03,110
I won't get in the way.

1003
02:04:05,829 --> 02:04:07,787
It's not like that at all.

1004
02:04:11,357 --> 02:04:13,122
He's my brother.

1005
02:05:54,954 --> 02:05:57,064
Wesa free!
