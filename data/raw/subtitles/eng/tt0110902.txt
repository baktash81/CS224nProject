185
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:28,548
It's also the only jump

186
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,467
in which you take offgoing forward.

187
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,427
That can bevery frightening.

188
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:34,429
Let's watch Katya.

189
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:39,351

190
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:46,775
Watch.

191
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:55,700
Someday,you'll do that.

192
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:14,551
What do you think?

193
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:17,513

196
00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:27,064
Are you sick?

197
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,485
You don't have a fever.

198
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:33,612

If you fall,then you'll just

206
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:55,007
get right back upand skate again.

207
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,968
Just like in the story.

208
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:58,886
What story, Babushka?

209
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:00,722

No, you haven'theard everything.

296
00:24:21,316 --> 00:24:23,235
I've heardthese storiesI was 15 years old.

297
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:24,819
I had studiedfor five years.

298
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:27,822
I was good,I was very good.

299
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:30,658
That winter, the directorof the school picked me

300
00:24:30,658 --> 00:24:33,035
to dance the leadin "The Nutcracker."

301
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:35,496
It was a dreamcome true.

302
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,124
How did you do?

303
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:42,587
During rehearsals,

304
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:45,131
a new girl joinedthe school.

305
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:46,924
Tamara Itkina.

306
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:50,052
Right away, everyone wastalking about her,

307
00:24:50,094 --> 00:24:51,679
how wonderful she was,

308
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:53,764
how graceful,how talented.

309
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,644
The director tookthe lead from me

310
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:00,270
and gave it to Tamara.

311
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:04,691
And she was wonderful,just as everyone expected.

312
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:06,568
She got three ovations.

313
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:08,528
But I didn't evensee the performance

314
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,697
because I'd left,She goI'd walked out.s.

315
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,824
I hated that schooland that director,

316
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:15,452
and most of all,I hated Tamara Itkina.

317
00:25:15,493 --> 00:25:18,163
I was so full of hate

318
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:21,124
that I'd forgottenhow much I loved ballet.

319
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:25,587
And when I realized it...

320
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:27,839
I was too embarrassedto go back.

321
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:35,012
Tamara because a dancerwith the Kirov.

322
00:25:36,597 --> 00:25:38,807
I saw her perform once.

323
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:42,311
I might never havegone that far,

324
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:45,689
but what hurts the most isthat I will never know.ce.

325
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:49,777
I won't let you makethe same mistake, Oksana,

326
00:25:49,818 --> 00:25:51,237
I won't...

327
00:25:51,237 --> 00:25:54,156

How did you get in?

331
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,292
The window in the girl'sdressing room was jammed open.

332
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:52,129
(sighing)

333
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,298
I did some thinking.

334
00:26:57,134 --> 00:26:59,136
You saidmy attitude was bad,

335
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,722
and you're right.

336
00:27:01,763 --> 00:27:03,890
You saidIt's because... bad,

337
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:07,436
skating was so much funin the beginning and so easy,

338
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:08,979
but now it's harder,

339
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:11,982
the competition,the jumps, everything.

340
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:15,569
You have to give up a lotto be a skater.

341
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:17,446
You have to want it a lot.

342
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:20,073
That's what I think, too.

343
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:22,283
And I do want it.

344
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:24,493
I want to bethe best I can.

345
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:26,579
Oksana...

346
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:30,791
I waDo you remember when I firstthe started coaching you?

347
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,168
I told you thatI thought you were better

348
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:33,836
than the restof the class?

349
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:35,463
Yes.

350
00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:37,548
That's whyI'm so hard on you.

351
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:42,261
Because you have somethingthat every skater dreams about.

352
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:45,931
You have greatness in you.

353
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:49,727
Have I scared you?

354
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,857
Good.

355
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:56,275
A little fear can bea healthy thing.

356

Yes, all right.

360

Stas?

361
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:22,801
The thing I wasmost afraid of...

362
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,720
was not beinglike other girls.

363
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:30,141
Not going to partiesor not having a best friend.

364
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:35,312
But last night,I realized something.

365
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,108
I do have a best friend.

366
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:42,361
It's you.

367
