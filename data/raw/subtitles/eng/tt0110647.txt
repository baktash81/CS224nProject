1
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,798
The Mountains of Destiny

2
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:03,149
mark the highest point
in the whole of Fantasia.

3
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:06,356
It is here,
in the Hidden Crystal Cave,

4
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:09,530
that the Old Man
of Wandering Mountain

5
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,395
records 'The Neverending Story'.

6
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:15,876
Now what?

7
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,550
Now what?
What now?

8
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:22,863
Hold your horses!
I'm finding out!

9
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:25,504
There will be a day

10
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:29,668
when the writing stylus
will start to act strangely,

11
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:35,279
making it increasingly difficult
to record 'The Neverending Story'.

12
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:40,327
This is a sign
that the Nasty is on the way -

13
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:45,594
an evil force that first takes hold
in young humans

14
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:49,572
when they turn away
from books and reading.

15
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:55,910
To stop the Nasty, even temporarily,
would require a special young human -

16
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:59,845
a voracious reader
of great imagination

17
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,818
and extraordinary courage.

18
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:11,383
Nicole?

19
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,458
Books listed according
to the Dewey decimal system.

20
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:36,445
Check the card catalogue...
Shhh!

21
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:38,967
"Shhh"?

22
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:43,480
I'll do the shushing
around here, young man!

23
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:47,983
Shushing is the job of the librarian
and not some snotty little kid

24
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:51,651
with hair that looks like
the rear end of a porcupine.

25
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:53,451
Mr Coreander?

26
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,502
Mr Coreander, don't you remember me?

27
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,521
Bastian - Bastian Balthazar Bucks.

28
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,015
Bastian?

29
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:03,303
W- w-what in the world
happened to you?

30
00:04:03,337 --> 00:04:05,939
It's sort of hard to explain.

31
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:07,434
I see.

32
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:09,612
Why so far from home?

33
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,701
Not playing hooky
from school, are we?

34
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:14,311
No. We moved.

35
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:15,987
This is my new school...

36
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,439
...unfortunately.

37
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:20,400
I see.

38
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:22,062
Well...

39
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:26,264
Stay here till the bell rings,
but no longer.

40
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:28,981
Don't want to be late
on your first day.

41
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:32,759
'Treasure Island'.
I remember this from your store.

42
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,975
Are the rest from there too?

43
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,617
Uh-huh.

44
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,272
'The Neverending Story'.

45
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:49,154
That is strictly
a reference book from now on.

46
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:55,376
It must not be taken from
the library under any circumstances.

47
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,330
It keeps going.

48
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,240
Well, of course it keeps going.

49
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:02,868
Every move you make
is part of your story.

50
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:06,456
Remember that the next time
you pick your nose.

51
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:13,733
Have to get
more inventory from the car.

52
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:17,611
Remember, 'late first day,
pay, pay, pay! '

53
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:24,526
"The Nasties"?

54
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,540
"One year after
his second visit to Fantasia,

55
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:37,860
"Bastian's father finally found
a woman he wanted to marry -

56
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,846
"a divorcee named Jane Baxter.

57
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:46,116
"Jane's house was more suited
for a family of four

58
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,544
"which, for Bastian, meant
a new room, a new neighbourhood,

59
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:53,715
"and worst of all, a new school."

60
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,166
Honey...

61
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:57,654
...where's Nicole?

62
00:05:57,688 --> 00:06:00,362
Oh, she'll be right down.

63
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:07,774
"But maybe his dad was right
and it would all be worth it.

64
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:10,694
"All his life
Bastian wanted a sister or brother

65
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:13,581
"to share his dreams
and confide in his secrets.

66
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,857
"Now, at last, he'd have one."

67
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,418
Hey, kiddo!

68
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:24,818
This is a family effort.
Do you want to help?

69
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:28,786
They're not my family
and this is not their house.

70
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,353
Nicole.

71
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:36,007
Dr Dumont said this would take time,
but you've got to meet them halfway.

72
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,611
Why bother?

73
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,534
You'll only get divorced again.

74
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:48,042
Nicole, this is going
to be different.

75
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,537
I promise you.

76
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,626
And just think
what a cool new brother you have.

77
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,847
Yeah. Real cool.

78
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,895
This is my mom's
sewing room, you know?

79
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,538
She loves sewing so much.

80
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:15,206
I'm really surprised
she's letting you use it.

81
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:18,376
I know I wouldn't.

82
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,521
You can have one if you want.

83
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,164
I got plenty of them.

84
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,116
What for?

85
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,797
Crystals are so stupid.

86
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,779
Like crystals can really
grant wishes!

87
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:35,840
Please...

88
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:38,171
...spare me this New Age garbage.

89
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:40,497
Crystals aren't supposed
to grant wishes.

90
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:45,005
Only the Oran can do that.

91
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:46,690
Oran?

92
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:49,823
You can't tell this to anybody.
OK.

93
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:52,837
The Oran is the necklace
of the Childlike Empress,

94
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:54,747
the ruler of all Fantasia.

95
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:56,203
Please!

96
00:07:56,237 --> 00:07:58,911
I'm not making it up.
It's all written.

97
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,552
In what - a book?
'The Neverending Story'.

98
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:05,177
And I'm listening to you
like this is real?

99
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,584
You are completely weird!

100
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:13,983
So, you two getting
into trouble yet?

101
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:16,180
See? They're bonding already!

102
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:17,899
Oh.

You look... handsome.
Thank you.

OK, kids, let's get
this show on the road!

113
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,657
That was forceful.

114
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,677
I'm being too harsh, aren't I?

115
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,133
He needs more time.

116
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,197
Take your time, Bastian.

117
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:42,809
I can always write you a late note.

118
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:45,354
Jane, you had it right
the first time.

119
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:48,521
I don't want him thinking
I'm a drill sergeant.

120
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,927
Downstairs! Look alive!

121
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,609
Let's go! Yee-hah!

122
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,104

You know, when you're ready.

127
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:18,015
You are not going
to school like that.

128
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:20,579
Like what?

129
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:23,139
That is so un.
'Un'?

130
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:25,809
Uncool, unsophisticated,

Just... un.

Nicole, wait for Bastian.

143
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:21,935
Jane, would you happen
to have a comb or a brush?

144
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:25,255
Honey, I think you should have
thought of that before.

145
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:27,946
No, I don't, but don't worry.

146
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,227
You look perfectly... impressive.

147
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:32,475
Really.
lmpressive.

148
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:34,619
Impressive.

149
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,981
Oh, my God, the new brother!

150
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:41,186
Is he for real?
I hope not.

151
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,051
Hey, Nicole.
Let's go!

152
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,726
Nicole!

153
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:50,966
NICOLE! Wait!

154
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:56,315
Where's the bathroom?
I gotta fix up my hair.

155
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,073
I can't show you right now.

156
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:01,592
Oh, my God!

157
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:03,574
Let's get out of here.

158
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:05,331
Nicole!

159
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:08,541
Nicole, come on!
Run!

160
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:10,260
Why? Who are they?

161
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:11,767
The Nasties!

162
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,240
The Nasties?

163
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,866
What's up, little homey?

164
00:12:34,062 --> 00:12:36,053
Uh... yo, what is it?

165
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:39,907
Uh, I mean... yo, what it is?

166
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:45,447
Can you guys show me
where the men's room is?

167
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,171
Ah... or at least tell me?

168
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:50,150
Dog, should we tell him or show him?

169
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:53,488
Ah, you know I hate
those two-part questions, Slip.

170
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,794
Yeah. That's 'cause
you've got a no-part brain.

171
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:58,742
Oh, OK.
Yeah.

172
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:02,983
This your first day here, squirt?
Yeah.

173
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,470
Hmm.
Hmm.

174
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:05,891
Ha.
Ha.

175
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:07,877
I think it'd only be right

176
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,547
we personally escort you
to the men's room.

177
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,565
Um, I can find it. I mean I really...

178
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:16,894
Ah...

179
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,072
So... you got a name?

180
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:22,887
Bastian Balthazar... Bucks.

181
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:24,535
Balthazar.

182
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:27,892
What kind of name's that?
You a Viking or something?

183
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,965
Don't forget to flush, Balthazar.

184
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:50,438
Yo, Mr John. What's up?

185
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:54,176
How many times are you dweezils
going to repeat 12th grade?

186
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,359
Till we break the record.

187
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:58,689
Well, you ain't going to make it.

188
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:02,352
Principal said the next time he
catches you here, you're expelled.

189
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:05,910
Yo, chill. We're only down here
on a field trip.

190
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:09,841
We're checking the pipes
for ecological violations...

191
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:11,641
Yeah.
And... stuff.

192
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:14,698
Let me out!

193
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:16,221
Open it.

194
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:18,781
Let me out!

195
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:22,529
Balthazar! Pal! Yeah!

196
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:27,037
Um... No, no!
We didn't lock him in there!

197
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,700
Mr John, we were sent down here
to look for him.

198
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,233
Just ask him.
Ask him.

199
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,750
Can you really have them expelled?

200
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,814
Oh, yeah.

201
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:42,315
They kidnapped me
and locked me in there to die!

202
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:45,715
Hey, Mr John, can't we discuss this?

203
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,834
I'm going to get you, Balthazar.

204
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:02,831
Nicole!

205
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:18,647
The story really is still happening.

206
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:27,588
Gotcha!

207
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,805
Help! Take me back to Fantasia!

208
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:48,332
Come on! Hurry up!

209
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:49,751
Come on!

210
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:52,803
It's my story! Return to Fantasia!
Escape the Nasties!

211
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:00,711
Where is he?

212
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,952
Where'd he go?

213
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:06,442
Find him!

214
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,294
Wash up first!

215
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:26,461
There's a terrible
root rot going around.

216
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:29,712
Come and get it, sweetskins!

217
00:16:29,746 --> 00:16:34,178
It's your favourite -
frog and lizard puree.

218
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:36,628
Don't bother me now, wench.

219
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,832
Can't you see
I'm observing the night sky?

220
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:46,977
Same as yesterday
and the day before that.

221
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:48,505
OH!

222
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,809
Aaaagh!

223
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:02,831
Two months of root rot - I finally
get to sleep and now this!

224
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:06,767
Ow! Aaaagh!

225
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:18,610
It serves you right for sticking
your foot in other people's potions!

226
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:23,958
If I was five feet taller I'd
show you a thing or two, young man!

227
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,977
Bastian?

228
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:28,586
Engywook?

229
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,524
Welcome back, me boy!

230
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:33,280
Ha! Engywook!

231
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:36,150
Sorry I wrecked your house.

232
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:38,443
I must've taken
a wrong turn... somewhere.

233
00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:43,634
Ah, yes, well, inter-world travel
is a very imprecise science.

234
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:46,920
I wrote a paper
on that very subject, didn't I?

235
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:48,605
Yes, yes!
Alright!

236
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:51,428
It doesn't look so bad.
I can fix it.

237
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:58,496
When I get my hands on that slippery
weasel, I'm going to rock his world.

238
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:05,144
Ah... Yo! Maybe he's hiding
in one of these books!

239
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:07,092
Yo, Balthazar!

240
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,969
Did anybody check in there?
Yeah, just a pile of junk.

241
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:35,249
'The Neverending Story'.

242
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,781
Hmm.
Hmm.

243
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,303
Ah!
I don't believe I've read that.

244
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:42,283
I must put it
on my preferred reading list.

245
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:46,022
Why don't you put 'Learning to Read'
on your preferred list first?

246
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:48,014
Why you always dissing me, man?

247
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:51,295
Why don't you look
into the mirror and find out?

248
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:53,663
Shhhh!

249
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,751
"In order to escape the Nasties..."

250
00:18:57,785 --> 00:18:59,437
The Nasties?

251
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,214
"...Bastian rushed inside the nearest
door of the school library."

252
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:06,581
The Nasties - that's us!

253
00:19:06,615 --> 00:19:10,893
Now how can something
that's happening right now...

254
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,384
...be in this book?

255
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:17,579
It ain't possible!

256
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:22,742
"Slip, the leader of the Nasties,
exclaimed to the others,

257
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:27,054
"'How can something that's happening
right now be in this book?"'

258
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:29,461
Yo! I just said that.

259
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:31,529
Yeah.

260
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:34,657
"'Yo! I just said that."'

261
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,751
That is so cool! Let me try.

262
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,203
OK!

263
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:43,716
Um... the-the print's too small.

264
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,035
You know what it is?
Your brain is too small.

265
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:48,449
The print is fine.

266
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,656
"Safe at last
among his tiny little friends,

267
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,090
"Bastian settled in front
of the patched-up gnome hovel,

268
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:59,491
"chewing on the last tiny morsels
of a gnome-cooked meal.

269
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:01,214
"When he finished his account

270
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:04,079
"of what brought him
back to Fantasia,

271
00:20:04,113 --> 00:20:09,079
"Engywook popped a fresh toothpick
in his nearly toothless mouth,

272
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:14,046
"shook his onion-sized bald head
and sighed to his human friend..."

273
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,916
That's quite a story, young man.

274
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,348
These Nasties
sound downright... nasty!

275
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:24,323
Are you finished
with your snake patties, dearie?

276
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,988
Snake patties?

277
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:32,308
Snake! Yeah, I'm finished.

278
00:20:33,722 --> 00:20:37,122
Where exactly
is the book now, Bastian?

279
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,515
It is in a safe place, isn't it?

280
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:44,768
Well, uh...

281
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,635
"It's safe alright."

282
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,614
I smell wood burning!

283
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:57,676
Well, if Balthazar could make up anything he wanted
to happen in Fantasia while he read this book,

284
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,306
maybe we could make
a few things happen to him...

285
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,812
...while he's there.

286
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,285
What are we waiting for?

287
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,775
Let's get NASTY!

288
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,701
What's this?
They said it'd be sunny today.

289
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:19,640
Oooh! I think I'll take
a raincheck here.

290
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:22,547
Whoa! Careful!
Watch the leaves, will ya?!

291
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,151
Ooooh!

292
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,449
Hey, something's burning back here.

293
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:33,512
Oh, no, it's me!

294
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:36,993
Quick! Call the fire department!

295
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,701
Call anybody!
Get me some baking soda.

296
00:21:39,735 --> 00:21:41,152
I'm kindling!

297
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:45,322
Get up, you old fool!

298
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:47,762
Get inside! Get inside now!

299
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:49,995
Come on, you daft old bat!

300
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:52,194
I knew this would happen! I...

301
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:56,206
Yeeny macaroni!

302
00:21:58,536 --> 00:22:01,554
Oh, my sainted aunt!

303
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:04,763
Me frogs!

304
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:06,411
Me lizards!

305
00:22:06,444 --> 00:22:09,161
Me food processor!

306
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:12,481
And me scientific experiments.

307
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,274
My life's work ruined!

308
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:18,402
Oh, my leaves!
My lovely leaves!

309
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:20,011
Get away! Leave me alone!

310
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:22,452
Autumn's just beginning
and I'm prematurely bald.

311
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:25,203
Help me, kid! I need a wig!

312
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:27,206
What about us?!

313
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,142
Um... ah...

314
00:22:29,176 --> 00:22:31,201
Nest! Get in his nest!

315
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:34,467
No way!

316
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:36,397
Man...

317
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:38,919
...what can I do?

318
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:41,521
Ain't nothing you can do!

319
00:22:41,555 --> 00:22:43,355
I'm the king. You're my slave!

320
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:45,719
The Nasties must have
'The Neverending Story'!

321
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:48,015
They're the ones
making this stuff happen.

322
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:51,678
Well, go back and stop them
before they destroy everything!

323
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:53,938
I can't get back without the book.

324
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:57,944
There is one other means
of inter-world transportation.

325
00:22:57,978 --> 00:22:59,782
The Oran.

326
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:02,873
The Empress has the Oran
in the lvory Tower.

327
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:05,509
Onward to Silver City!

328
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:14,105
This is positively and
absolutely the last time I'm flying!

329
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:15,637
Falkor!

330
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:19,301
Huh? Bastian, is that you?

331
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:20,943
Falkor, land!

332
00:23:20,977 --> 00:23:22,400
Land?!

333
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:26,679
I can't land down there.
I need a runway.

334
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:29,922
Come on, you can land anywhere.
You're a luck dragon!

335
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:31,416
A luck dragon, huh?

336
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:35,136
If I was a luck dragon
I'd be halfway to Vegas.

337
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,824
It's not a dragon.
It's an overgrown pink poodle.

338
00:23:38,857 --> 00:23:42,567
Oh, no! I'm losing altitude!

339
00:23:42,644 --> 00:23:45,165
Look out below!

340
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,538
Aaaaaaagh!

341
00:23:47,572 --> 00:23:49,525
Look out!

342
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,577
Oh, I hate this part of the story!

343
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:56,741
Aaaaaaaaagh!

344
00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:01,211
Wee!

345
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:04,421
Falkor!

346
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:10,361
Ow! I think I've skinned my snout.

347
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:12,983
Falkor, you did great!
Ohh...

348
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:15,810
Am I still in one piece?

349
00:24:15,843 --> 00:24:19,129
We need a ride to Silver City
to see the Empress.

350
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:21,323
Not with me. I just came from there.

351
00:24:21,356 --> 00:24:23,484
Everyone's acting crazy there too.

352
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:25,132
What about the lvory Tower?

353
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:28,566
Did the Nasty reach there too?
Yes, they did.

354
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,022
And the Empress?

355
00:24:30,056 --> 00:24:32,806
I heard she escaped
to the Wandering Mountains.

356
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,378
That's where we must go!

357
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:38,307
Wait, that's just what I heard.
It could be just a rumour.

358
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:40,846
This is no weather
for mountain flying.

359
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,317
We'll have to chance it,
you pink wimp!

360
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:48,203
Bastian needs the power of the Oran
to get him back to the human world

361
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,718
so he can stop this thing
before it ruins us all!

362
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:54,657
Hurry up, let's go. Come on!

363
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:57,563
With my root rot, I'm walking!

364
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:02,114
Come on, Barky!

365
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:04,559
Alright, alright!
I'm sitting in the middle.

366
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:08,948
You are not getting me up in the air
in that thing!

367
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:11,508
Not a chance!

368
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:20,414
Hang on, Barky, hang on.
Hang on to what?

369
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:23,466
There's no handles, no seat belts,
no in-flight catering.

370
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:25,988
I'm getting a stiff neck
from the draught.

371
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:28,067
We should have walked!

372
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,080
I... want to get down!

373
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:33,246
Oh, be quiet. Enjoy the view.

374
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:41,350
Well... you wanna know
what's next, Bastian?

375
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:43,790
First we're gonna take over
the Wandering Mountains

376
00:25:43,824 --> 00:25:45,744
and then the Hidden Crystal Cave.

377
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:50,285
Then there'll be no place for you and
your little freaky friends to hide!

378
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:53,309
Someone's coming!

379
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:55,715
Ooh! Shouldn't we clean up first?

380
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:58,576
No. Leave it
for that numbskull janitor.

381
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,842
Bastian, were we?

382
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:10,305
Bastian Balth!

383
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,497
Shush, will you?!

384
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:25,548
Oh, I hate birds!

385
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,673
Mmm!

386
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:32,277

Hurry, open the door!

435
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:36,648
Empress! Oh-oh,
I- I-I... alright.

436
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:37,990
Come in.

437
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:41,959
Empress, what an honour!
What an honour!

438
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,950
It's so nice to have company.

439
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,472
This isn't a social call, Old Man.

440
00:29:46,505 --> 00:29:49,180
A terrible plague
has overrun the Silver City.

441
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:53,840
I was driven from the lvory Tower
by a force so powerful...

442
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:56,973
...even the Oran couldn't stop it.

443
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,997
Fortunately, I was able to, hmm,

444
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,851
butt us through to the secret tunnel
for our escape.

445
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:07,479
Well... that's using your head.
Mmm...

446
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:12,981
It's no time for cheap head jokes.
We must do something.

447
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:14,934
What does the Great Book say?

448
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:17,490
This evil force
is known as the Nasty

449
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:19,475
and comes from the human world.

450
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:20,970
The human world?

451
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:24,289
So that's why
Oran has no effect on it!

452
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,166
But how's it controlling Fantasia?

453
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,396
Alas, I'm afraid the Nasty humans
now possess 'The Neverending Story'.

454
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:36,095
Well, then, get out of here! It's $5!

455
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:38,922
Yeah, alright!

456
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:44,085
You must go there.

457
00:30:44,118 --> 00:30:47,327
I'll use the Oran's powers
to wish you there immediately.

458
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,734
No. Hold it, hold it.

459
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,381
Mmm?

460
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:56,802
My dear Royal Empress of all that is
wonderful and imaginative...

461
00:30:56,836 --> 00:30:59,799
...what you need
is a special young human,

462
00:30:59,832 --> 00:31:02,762
a voracious reader
of great imagination

463
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:05,746
and extraordinary courage.

464
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,377
That's what it says
in the Great Book.

465
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:13,020
Here.

466
00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:14,839
Hmm...

467
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:17,624
I shall call on the Oran.

468
00:31:17,657 --> 00:31:19,080
Oh, great Oran,

469
00:31:19,114 --> 00:31:23,354
bring me the human hero who will
save Fantasia from the Nasty.

470
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,566
Bastian!

471
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,815
Oh, show some respect, will ya?!

472
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:37,219
It's freezing in here.

473
00:31:37,253 --> 00:31:39,557
But it's a lot safer!

474
00:31:39,591 --> 00:31:43,220
Oh, yeah! I hope those stalactites
are screwed in tight!

475
00:31:43,254 --> 00:31:44,677
Uh? Yeah.

476
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:46,396
Ooh, ooh! My beloved Empress!

477
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,409
I was so worried
I caught the first flight...

478
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:50,828
Shh! Quiet!

479
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:52,967
Empress, how are you?
Not well.

480
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:56,630
But the Oran has brought me a hero
to save Fantasia.

481
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,119
Excuse me, your Royal Highness.

482
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:02,628
May I make a humble
little interjection here?

483
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:04,555
Quiet, gnome! There's no time!

484
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:06,415
The Nasty's on its way here!

485
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:09,352
Soon, we could be
at each other's throats.

486
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,917
Good! Why not start now?

487
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,064
Stop! We must not
give in to the Nasty!

488
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:18,178
Let the gnome speak.
This better be good!

489
00:32:18,211 --> 00:32:20,742
Bastian's heart is strong.

490
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:23,374
But he's not exactly
Arnold Schwarzenegger

491
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,360
in the muscle department, is he?

492
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:26,855
No!
Shut up!

493
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:29,262
The Oran can provide the transport.

494
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:32,241
But when he gets back
to the human world

495
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:35,752
how's he going to
get the book away from these thugs?

496
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:37,471
The gnome is right.

497
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:38,962
Told ya.

498
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:45,002
You will take the Oran with you.

499
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:48,058
You shall wish yourself
back to the human world,

500
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:52,601
then use the Oran's power to return
the book to the Keeper's safe hands.

501
00:32:52,634 --> 00:32:55,886
But... you must only use it
to stop the Nasty.

502
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,178
Then you must return it to me.

503
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:01,291
Back, back, back. Get back!

504
00:33:01,325 --> 00:33:02,992
Give the boy wishing room.

505
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,424
Here goes.

506
00:33:19,343 --> 00:33:21,029
Oh, kid!

507
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:24,348
If you want to travel
back to another world, Bastian,

508
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:26,641
you'll have to wish harder than that!

509
00:33:26,675 --> 00:33:28,097
I can't.

510
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,142
If the kid wishes any harder
he'll break his wishbone!

511
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,253
Hey, don't go too far, Junior.

512
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:38,298
Come on! What's the big deal?

513
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:41,125
Time for me to lend him
a helping branch.

514
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:44,520
Here, grab a twig.
Come on, grab his ear, Bastian.

515
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:50,366
Ohh, Bastian! Hi, Dadda.

516
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,510
Junior, come back!

517
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:56,135
Oh! It's Junior.
Me play too.

518
00:33:57,128 --> 00:33:59,081
Hold tight! Hold the branch.

519
00:33:59,114 --> 00:34:00,915
Be careful!

520
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:03,055
Dadda!
Oh, me toes!

521
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:05,767
Dadda, help me!

522
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,295
But they've all gone!

523
00:34:07,329 --> 00:34:10,619
Ah! There's been
a wish overload, you see.

524
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:14,287
Don't worry, my tasty
little toadstool, we're safe.

525
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,026
You see, we and the others
weren't making physical contact.

526
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:20,048
Aaaagh!

527
00:34:20,082 --> 00:34:22,038
Ah! Oooh!

528
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:27,085
Your body's gone!

529
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:29,831
Well, your body went years ago!

530
00:34:29,865 --> 00:34:32,544
What the?!

531
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:42,744
No. This must not happen.

532
00:34:45,189 --> 00:34:47,291
Fantasians, come back.

533
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:55,548
They're lost, Old Man.
Help me. What do I do?

534
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:58,867
Oh, Empress, I'm a mere chronicler.
What can I do?

535
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,508
Bastian, can you hear me?

536
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:04,483
I have something
of great importance to tell you!

537
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:09,033
The book!

538
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,964
I wish 'The Neverending Story' would
leave the Nasties and return here...

539
00:35:12,998 --> 00:35:14,382
No, Bastian, stop!

540
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,025
Empress?

541
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:19,841
The Fantasians who helped you
got caught in a wish overload

542
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:22,635
and are there with you
in the human world.

543
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:25,992
You mustn't use the Oran's powers
to stop the Nasty.

544
00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:27,486
Why not?

545
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,385
Because the new Fantasia
that follows will be different.

546
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,842
It won't include them.

547
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:36,346
It's my imagination. I'll just... make
sure they're in the new Fantasia.

548
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,445
No, Bastian. You must find them.

549
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:42,726
Bring them all together
and bring them back to Fantasia

550
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:45,264
before you return the book
to the Keeper.

551
00:35:45,298 --> 00:35:47,769
Or they will be lost forever.

552
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:52,697
OK.

553
00:35:57,243 --> 00:36:00,954
I'm really gonna miss
the old school!

554
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:03,853
What's new? You've been
missing school for five years!

555
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:05,310
Yo, check this out.

556
00:36:05,343 --> 00:36:07,558
"Bastian always wanted
a sister or brother

557
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:09,677
"to share his dreams and secrets.

558
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,728
"Now, at last, he would have one."

559
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:14,130
Only problem is,
he's stuck in Fantasia.

560
00:36:14,164 --> 00:36:16,499
Maybe we'll let him
send her a postcard!

561
00:36:18,103 --> 00:36:20,128
Balthazar!
He's back!

562
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:21,580
Let's split.

563
00:36:23,604 --> 00:36:25,591
Hey!

564
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:41,446
What if he tells the cops?!
Let him.

565
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,903
We didn't do nothin'.

566
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:46,757
He stole the book. It says so
right in 'The Neverending Story'.

567
00:36:50,883 --> 00:36:54,053
Aaaaaagh...

568
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:02,994
Wow! Something tells me
I'm not in Fantasia anymore!

569
00:37:03,027 --> 00:37:06,131
Doesn't seem to be
anybody else around up here.

570
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:10,272
I hope I'm not the only
flying creature in these parts.

571
00:37:10,306 --> 00:37:14,379
Oh, pardon me, ma'am!
May I talk to you for a second?

572
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:15,797
I'm a little lost.

573
00:37:15,831 --> 00:37:17,975
Ay, where am I?

574
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:20,071
Last time I'm making any wishes.

575
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,578
Where is that kid?

576
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:23,018
Uh, pardon me, ladies.

577
00:37:23,052 --> 00:37:26,414
Any of you seen a human
about 1.5 roots tall,

578
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:29,202
goes by the name
of Bastian Bucks, hmm?

579
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:35,085
Ahh! Don't worry, lady,
I'm not gonna steal your pine cones.

580
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,695
Huh, what is this place?

581
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:41,695
Hey, uh, balsam, hemlock, fir,
oak, aspen, maple even!

582
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:44,566
Ooh! Look at the bark formation
on that one!

583
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,037
I've never seen anything like it!
Is this a Greenpeace convention?

584
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:57,283
Oh, no, chainsaw massacre!

585
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,771
Oh!

586
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:08,820
Ugh! Yuck!

587
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,578
Uncle Rocky?

588
00:38:12,985 --> 00:38:15,659
Help, help!
There's a murderer back there!

589
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:19,441
Oh, no!

590
00:38:23,224 --> 00:38:26,433
Oh, God, I've gotta get out
of this awful place!

591
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:32,512
Oh, wait a minute!

592
00:38:32,546 --> 00:38:34,761
They're going over
to second grade.

593
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:36,405
OK, let's move it out.

594
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:41,065
That gives me... an idea.

595
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,978
Mmm!

596
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:51,762
Ooh! Yum-meeeeeee!

597
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:57,001
I no like it!

598
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,555
Hang on, kid, I'll save ya!

599
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:02,077
Er... with a little luck.

600
00:39:05,173 --> 00:39:08,038
Hang in there, kid!
Oh, oh, oh...

601
00:39:08,072 --> 00:39:09,800
Ow!

602
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:12,322
Dadda!

603
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:15,187
Here I come!

604
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:17,665
Oh, Dadda!

605
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:20,459
Gotcha!

606
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:24,504
Ow! This won't help my back problem.

607
00:39:24,538 --> 00:39:26,832
I hungry.

608
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:29,094
Huh? OK, OK.

609
00:39:29,127 --> 00:39:32,489
We'll stop at the next rock pile.
Ooh, goody!

610
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,620
♪  Hear the formality

611
00:39:53,654 --> 00:39:55,684
♪  Get on the front seat... ♪

612
00:39:55,718 --> 00:39:58,200
♪  Show your personality
Be who you wanna be... ♪

613
00:39:58,234 --> 00:40:00,650
Honey, I'm home!

614
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:05,039
It is so cool to have
a nice family to come home to!

615
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:06,567
Barney...
Sis watching TV.

616
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:08,399
How was your day?

617
00:40:08,432 --> 00:40:10,163
Fine.
Great!

618
00:40:10,197 --> 00:40:11,692
Barney...
And Bastian...

619
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:14,246
I'll bet he's upstairs
studying already.

620
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,505
Barney, the school called today.

621
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,481
It seems Bastian
cut his first three classes.

622
00:40:19,515 --> 00:40:22,809
And he... well, he stole a book -

623
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:25,822
something called 'The Neverending
Story' - from the school library.

624
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,955
Barney...

625
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:34,648
What are you looking for?

626
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:36,138
Nothing.

627
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:39,309
You wanna talk?

628
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,327
I can't. I'm busy right now.

629
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:48,325
Any, um... problems
with the new school?

630
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:52,227
Making any friends?

631
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,011
I'm fine, OK?!
OK.

632
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,595
It's just that, um...

633
00:41:02,385 --> 00:41:06,128
...sometimes it... helps
to get things off your chest.

634
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,159
This is all new to you.

635
00:41:10,192 --> 00:41:12,279
It'll be tough for a while.

636
00:41:17,857 --> 00:41:19,883
So, there's nothing you wanna?
No.

637
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:29,395
Dad?
Yeah?

638
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:32,108
Everything sucks.

639
00:41:32,142 --> 00:41:33,636
OK?

640
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:36,807
OK.

641
00:41:57,093 --> 00:41:59,963
Guys, you've gotta find me.
I'll never find you.

642
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:03,512
The world's too big
for a kid without a driver's licence.

643
00:42:03,546 --> 00:42:06,038
Who were you talking to?
Uh, no-one.

644
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:09,128
I was... singing a song.
It's country and western.

645
00:42:11,344 --> 00:42:14,863
My mom and your dad
think you have gone bonkers.

646
00:42:14,897 --> 00:42:18,182
They're talking about having you
committed to a mental institution.

647
00:42:19,443 --> 00:42:22,882
Oh, well. At least Mom
will get her sewing room back.

648
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,372
Oh, very funny!

649
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:32,471
Oh, where did you get this -
the Empress?

650
00:42:35,146 --> 00:42:39,348
Can't believe you actually expect
people to believe all this stuff.

651
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:41,449
I don't care what they believe.

652
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:43,971
I don't get it.

653
00:42:44,964 --> 00:42:47,715
Why don't you...
just show us something

654
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:50,427
from this Fantasia place of yours?

655
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:52,533
I- I... I can't.

656
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,783
I wish I could, bu...

657
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:57,916
But... I can't!

658
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,188
Fine. Have it your way.

659
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:09,076
"Bastian sadly clutched the Oran...

660
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:13,311
"...unable to make the one wish that
would set things right in Fantasia

661
00:43:13,345 --> 00:43:16,483
"and allow him
to get on with his own life...

662
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:18,125
"...in the human world."

663
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,422
"Bastian returned to his telescope

664
00:43:43,456 --> 00:43:47,352
"hoping against hope for some sign
of his Fantasian friends.

665
00:43:47,385 --> 00:43:51,249
"As the night wore on,
his eyes grew heavier and heavier

666
00:43:51,283 --> 00:43:53,465
"until he fell gently off to sleep."

667
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:04,545
Because now I'm gonna rock his life
in the human world.

668
00:44:05,996 --> 00:44:08,556
I'll make sure
he never gets a sister.

669
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:11,388
I like that.
Um, chief?

670
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:15,929
You think maybe we should get
our hands on that Koran thing first?

671
00:44:15,963 --> 00:44:17,532
It's Oran...

672
00:44:17,565 --> 00:44:19,100
...YOU MORON!

673
00:44:21,011 --> 00:44:22,997
But maybe you have a point.

674
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:27,294
If those Fantasians
can show up any minute now...

675
00:44:27,328 --> 00:44:30,523
...before we even get a chance
to read about it,

676
00:44:30,557 --> 00:44:33,558
this book could go flying
from our hands.

677
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:36,336
Wait, Slip...
Let's steal the necklace.

678
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:39,082
And then we get the book... forever.

679
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:44,622
Permanent control
over Balthazar's story.

680
00:44:52,912 --> 00:44:54,363
Falkor!

681
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,769
Falky, look.

682
00:44:59,802 --> 00:45:01,436
Fantasia!

683
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,652
Oh, I don't think so.

684
00:45:03,685 --> 00:45:06,818
But let's go check it out.
Ah!

685
00:45:26,455 --> 00:45:28,484
Oh, pretty! Fantasia?

686
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:33,561
It may not be Fantasia but there's
some cute dragons here.

687
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:38,070
Excuse me. Sorry.

688
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,927
Heeeeey! You're nice!

689
00:45:50,868 --> 00:45:52,324
Falkor!

690
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:54,154
Look over there.
Where? Oh, yeah!

691
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:57,019
Oh, boy! It's Bastion.

692
00:45:57,053 --> 00:45:59,003
There!

693
00:45:59,037 --> 00:46:00,798
Junior!

694
00:46:00,831 --> 00:46:02,526
Bastian.

695
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,507
Oh, great. You two OK?

696
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,422
Dog! Sic the necklace!

697
00:46:06,455 --> 00:46:09,894
I mean it! Just go! Go!
OK.

698
00:46:09,928 --> 00:46:11,351
Get it, Dog!

699
00:46:11,384 --> 00:46:13,524
Go!
Don't be a wimp!

700
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,762
Hungry, Bastion!
Let's get out of here.

701
00:46:25,252 --> 00:46:26,895
Ha, ha, ha! Bye-bye!

702
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:29,111
Bye-bye!

703
00:46:32,091 --> 00:46:34,159
Yeah!

704
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:37,630
So long,
my little fortune cookies!

705
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:40,195
I'll be back!

706
00:46:40,228 --> 00:46:42,292
No Fantasia, Bastian.

707
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:12,110
Well, genius, got any ideas
where we are?

708
00:47:12,144 --> 00:47:15,645
Oh, yes.
It's definitely the human world.

709
00:47:15,678 --> 00:47:17,215
The weather's so unpredictable.

710
00:47:17,249 --> 00:47:19,470
You see,
there's this gigantic hole...

711
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,941
Yes. And it's right in the middle
of your face.

712
00:47:22,975 --> 00:47:25,386
Now, why don't you shut it?

713
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,915
Shush!

714
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,281
Oh, it's slippery.

715
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,000
Come on.

716
00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:33,944
You're breathing rather heavily.

717
00:47:35,587 --> 00:47:37,808
Federal Express.

718
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:40,902
There is one problem,
my little squashed cumquat.

719
00:47:40,936 --> 00:47:44,833
We appear to be several thousand
miles from Bastian's house.

720
00:47:44,866 --> 00:47:47,474
Oh, you nit-sized nitwit!

721
00:47:47,507 --> 00:47:50,373
No, no, I can invent
a small flying machine,

722
00:47:50,406 --> 00:47:52,664
but it may take me some time.

723
00:47:52,698 --> 00:47:54,613
Ohhh!

724
00:47:57,823 --> 00:47:59,618
Good evening.
Evening, Mr McKenzie.

725
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:01,812
When will it arrive?

726
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:03,788
Ah, tomorrow afternoon.

727
00:48:03,822 --> 00:48:05,697
Come on. Get inside.

728
00:48:05,731 --> 00:48:08,099
I'll change the label
to Bastian's address

729
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:09,670
when the coast is clear.

730
00:48:09,704 --> 00:48:12,798
I hope we get
some advantage miles for this.

731
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:17,020
The Nasty could be at
Wandering Mountain already.

732
00:48:17,053 --> 00:48:20,210
If it gets to the Empress
it's all over for Fantasia.

733
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:22,508
Fly faster, Falkor!

734
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:25,521
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say!

735
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:27,359
My back is killing me.

736
00:48:27,392 --> 00:48:29,078
Alright, let's head to my house.

737
00:48:29,112 --> 00:48:32,283
I'll stay there with Junior
and you keep searching.

738
00:48:32,317 --> 00:48:34,002
Oh, alright.

739
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:48,906
Oh! Mm-mm.

740
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,696
Oh! You are home!

741
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:54,747
I was beginning to worry
about you and Junior

742
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:56,276
with all this nasty weather.

743
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:58,833
Ah... where is Junior?

744
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:01,357
Well, he's... Ohhhh.

745
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,463
Where's Junior?

746
00:49:05,497 --> 00:49:07,508
Well, he, er...

747
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,677
Where's the rest of him?

748
00:49:13,711 --> 00:49:15,874
He's in the human world.

749
00:49:15,908 --> 00:49:18,281
Ohhhhh!

750
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:21,567
Oh, no.

751
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:25,999
Oh, that's better.

752
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:28,291
Bye-bye.

753
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:31,614
With luck he'll find them
by morning.

754
00:49:31,648 --> 00:49:33,415
Come on.

755
00:49:33,449 --> 00:49:34,939
Sleepy sleep.

756
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:39,599
Oh, why is it always me?

757
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:45,445
You'll sleep in here.
Nobody will notice you.

758
00:49:45,479 --> 00:49:47,394
I'm tired now.

759
00:49:47,427 --> 00:49:49,194
Ah. Mmm.

760
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:50,836
OK. Right here.

761
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:54,003
Don't come out
for any reason whatsoever.

762
00:49:54,036 --> 00:49:56,295
Kissy kiss?

763
00:49:57,861 --> 00:49:59,432
Mmm.

764
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:01,128
Goodnight.

765
00:50:01,161 --> 00:50:02,789
Mmmm.

766
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:09,132
Mama.

767
00:50:16,543 --> 00:50:18,148
Junior.

768
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,753
My baby.

769
00:50:23,726 --> 00:50:25,254
A- choo!

770
00:50:33,124 --> 00:50:35,684
I hungry, Bastian.

771
00:50:35,717 --> 00:50:37,174
Shhh!
Ooh!

772
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:39,275
Stop it! Come on, Junior. No!

773
00:50:40,613 --> 00:50:42,528
Stop it! No!
Slippy!

774
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:44,858
I think it's coming
from the kitchen.

775
00:50:44,892 --> 00:50:48,750
Shh. We've got the element
of surprise on our side.

776
00:50:48,784 --> 00:50:50,507
No. It's for humans only!

777
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:54,824
Aaagh!
Me hungry!

778
00:50:54,858 --> 00:50:56,391
Barney!

779
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:02,122
Ooh, I like these!
No! Junior, no!

780
00:51:02,155 --> 00:51:05,025
No! No!

781
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:10,833
Uh-oh.

782
00:51:15,647 --> 00:51:18,741
Haiiiii-ya!

783
00:51:19,772 --> 00:51:21,687
Uh, hiya... Bastion.

784
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:25,656
You mind telling me why you're
running all those machines?

785
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,941
I just... came down
for a late-night snack

786
00:51:28,975 --> 00:51:31,315
and then I decided to sorta...

787
00:51:31,348 --> 00:51:35,475
...test to make sure everything
in the kitchen was in working order.

788
00:51:35,508 --> 00:51:37,728
At one o'clock in the morning?

789
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,414
Good work, Bastian.

790
00:51:39,447 --> 00:51:43,955
Yes. Always good to do that sort
of thing during low-usage hours.

791
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:45,561
Very cost conscious of you.

792
00:51:45,594 --> 00:51:48,158
Gee. Neat necklace.

793
00:51:48,197 --> 00:51:49,806
Thanks.

794
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,112
Where did you get that?

795
00:51:52,146 --> 00:51:54,488
Ahhh... a pawn shop.

796
00:51:54,522 --> 00:51:56,669
A pawn shop?
Barney.

797
00:51:56,703 --> 00:51:58,783
Come on. Let him be.

798
00:51:58,817 --> 00:52:01,110
Don't stay up too late, Bastian, OK?

799
00:52:04,052 --> 00:52:06,840
Sleepy sleep with Bastian?

800
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:10,547
No, you can't sleepy sleep
with Bastian.

801
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,533
Ohhhh.

802
00:52:14,634 --> 00:52:16,473
Please.

803
00:52:16,507 --> 00:52:18,531
OK, but keep it quiet.
Oh!

804
00:52:18,564 --> 00:52:20,289
If that's possible.

805
00:52:20,322 --> 00:52:22,276
I happy!

806
00:52:27,585 --> 00:52:29,572
Come on, Junior. Tippy-toes.

807
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:31,330
I'm not tired.

808
00:52:31,363 --> 00:52:32,786
Shhh!

809
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,768
But I'm not tired.

810
00:52:55,169 --> 00:52:59,066
Another great idea bites the dust!

811
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,707
Where am I now?

812
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,281
Everything hurts.

813
00:53:02,314 --> 00:53:04,128
Just what I need!

814
00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:05,909
Get away from me!

815
00:53:05,943 --> 00:53:09,038
I'm warning you!
I've seen that look before.

816
00:53:09,072 --> 00:53:12,684
Shoo! You're barking up
the wrong tree.

817
00:53:12,718 --> 00:53:16,296
Hmm. Me like red one.
Me like blue one.

818
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,815
Mmm!

819
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:21,267
Oh! Oh!

820
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:22,758
Can I come in?

821
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:25,160
Come in!
No, you can't.

822
00:53:26,153 --> 00:53:27,648
Can I come in?

823
00:53:27,682 --> 00:53:29,214
No! I'm getting dressed.

Ow!

So am I.

891
00:57:31,809 --> 00:57:34,030
But that's why I carry plastique.

892
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:37,578
You'll find this at
the Principal's office, young lady.

893
00:57:37,612 --> 00:57:39,531
But that's my mom's gold...

894
00:57:39,565 --> 00:57:42,588
And if we don't get
to our home room,

895
00:57:42,621 --> 00:57:45,066
we'll find ourselves
at the Principal's office.

896
00:57:47,283 --> 00:57:49,040
Nicole. What have we there?

897
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:50,611
Nothing.

898
00:57:50,645 --> 00:57:52,406
Hand it over.

899
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,928
I can't.
It doesn't belong to me.

900
00:57:54,962 --> 00:57:57,904
That's all the more reason.
Let's see it.

901
00:57:57,937 --> 00:57:59,890
I wish you would just...

902
00:58:00,922 --> 00:58:02,454
Yes?

903
00:58:02,488 --> 00:58:04,245
We were saying?

904
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:06,364
We wish...

905
00:58:06,397 --> 00:58:08,448
I wish...

906
00:58:09,479 --> 00:58:12,956
We... wish... what?

907
00:58:14,446 --> 00:58:19,833
I wish... you would just
leave me alone,

908
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:24,494
leave all of us alone and stop
breathing your camel breath on us

909
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:28,925
and go back to your cage
where you belong.

910
00:58:40,196 --> 00:58:42,149
Class...

911
00:58:42,183 --> 00:58:44,666
I must leave you all now.

912
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,059
My cage needs tidying.

913
00:58:56,854 --> 00:58:58,649
No way.

914
00:58:59,642 --> 00:59:01,094
Way.

915
00:59:10,454 --> 00:59:12,326
Nicole!

916
00:59:13,396 --> 00:59:15,039
Nicole, wait!

917
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,662
Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

918
00:59:24,016 --> 00:59:25,435
Gotcha!

919
00:59:25,468 --> 00:59:27,002
Ow! Ow! Come on!

920
00:59:27,035 --> 00:59:28,950
Hello, Mother.
Hello, dear.

921
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:31,887
Can I come to the mall with you guys?

922
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:33,726
I thought you were broke.

923
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,011
Well... I don't need any money.

924
00:59:37,045 --> 00:59:40,903
Oh, how nice. Your mother
finally got you a charge card?

925
00:59:40,937 --> 00:59:43,349
Which one?
All of them.

926
00:59:47,895 --> 00:59:49,881
OK. Balthazar.

927
00:59:49,914 --> 00:59:51,712
Lay it on me.

928
00:59:51,746 --> 00:59:53,477
Lay what on you?

929
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,917
No games, Balthazar.
Let's see the gold.

930
00:59:55,951 --> 00:59:58,249
I don't have it.
Frisk him.

931
00:59:59,279 --> 01:00:01,725
Oh! Ugh!

932
01:00:04,093 --> 01:00:07,112
Where did you hide it?
I didn't hide it.

933
01:00:08,755 --> 01:00:11,357
You wanna make things
harder on us? OK.

934
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,261
We're gonna make things
A lot harder for you.

935
01:00:14,294 --> 01:00:17,867
We'll check the book,
find out where the necklace is

936
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,439
and when we get it you can
kiss your new family goodbye.

937
01:00:38,975 --> 01:00:41,267
Bastian!

938
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,559
I hungry!

939
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,157
I...
Shhh.

940
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,229
You got it?

941
01:00:53,263 --> 01:00:55,231
Yeah, I got it.
OK.

942
01:00:55,264 --> 01:00:57,198
Stay here. Bark Troll.

943
01:00:57,232 --> 01:00:58,884
Oh. Me come too.

944
01:00:58,918 --> 01:01:00,603
This your order?
Ah, yeah.

945
01:01:00,636 --> 01:01:03,272
Sign here.
Where do you want it?

946
01:01:03,306 --> 01:01:06,405
I'll take care of him.
Him?

947
01:01:07,934 --> 01:01:09,772
Ah, yeah. Um...

948
01:01:09,805 --> 01:01:13,893
Haven't you read... you know,
'The Secret Life of Plants'?

949
01:01:13,927 --> 01:01:15,847
Trees are people too.
Oh, yeah?

950
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,701
This one looks like he'd be
better off in a woodchipper.

951
01:01:21,382 --> 01:01:23,215
Whoa!
Hey, Tom!

952
01:01:25,087 --> 01:01:26,697
Oh!

953
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:28,645
Have a nice trip?

954
01:01:28,678 --> 01:01:31,391
What are you looking at?
Let's go.

955
01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:34,104
Oooh. Have they gone?

956
01:01:38,574 --> 01:01:40,107
You made it.

957
01:01:40,141 --> 01:01:43,120
Some place you got here,
this human world.

958
01:01:44,343 --> 01:01:45,876
How did you find me?

959
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:48,015
I let my branches do the walking.

960
01:01:48,049 --> 01:01:51,143
Luckily there's only one Bucks
in the phone book

961
01:01:51,177 --> 01:01:52,982
else I'd be walking all day.

962
01:01:53,015 --> 01:01:55,288
Oooh!
Not that pile of rocks again.

963
01:01:55,321 --> 01:01:57,528
Just what I need.
Now we go home?

964
01:01:57,562 --> 01:02:00,541
Oh! Oh! Ah! Oh! Ow!
Get off the roots!

965
01:02:00,575 --> 01:02:02,028
Stay here with Junior.

966
01:02:02,062 --> 01:02:03,449
Shhh!
Me go home!

967
01:02:03,483 --> 01:02:05,432
Junior, take it easy.
Shut up!

968
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:11,545
Me go home!

969
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,447
Bastion Bucks lives here?

970
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,935
Yes.
Right.

971
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:17,356
Thank you.

972
01:02:17,389 --> 01:02:18,841

Sure.

973
01:02:20,102 --> 01:02:21,521

974
01:02:21,554 --> 01:02:23,197

01:02:26,687 --> 01:02:28,817
Let us out!

977
01:02:28,851 --> 01:02:31,525
Oh, no!
There's no floor!

978
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:34,200
There's no bathroom here!

979
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:35,690
I've got to go!

980
01:02:35,723 --> 01:02:37,490
Ohhhhhhh!

981
01:02:37,523 --> 01:02:42,070
Bastion... there's a package
here for you.

982
01:02:43,598 --> 01:02:47,571
And there seems to be something -
I don't know how to say this -

983
01:02:47,605 --> 01:02:49,290
speaking inside.

984
01:02:49,324 --> 01:02:50,976
Help us!

985
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:53,574
Oh, um...

986
01:02:53,608 --> 01:02:57,772
...this must be... er...
the parrot... I sent for.

987
01:02:59,186 --> 01:03:03,732
Um... by the way,
have you... seen Nicole?

988
01:03:03,766 --> 01:03:08,046
Er... she called to say
she went to the mall.

989
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:12,328
The mall. OK. 'Bye.

990
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,337
Shhhh!

991
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:20,007
Stop!
Let us out!

992
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:22,660
Ohhhhhh! Candy?

993
01:03:22,693 --> 01:03:25,246
Let us out!

994
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:27,552
There's no time.
We gotta go.

995
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:29,826
No! We've got to go!

996
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:31,927
Ugh!

997
01:03:41,134 --> 01:03:42,930
Do you see what I see?

998
01:03:42,963 --> 01:03:44,463
Hey, that's it!

999
01:03:44,497 --> 01:03:47,743
If anybody says anything to you,
just say, "Trick or treat?"

1000
01:03:47,777 --> 01:03:50,461
Twick or tweat?

1001
01:03:50,495 --> 01:03:56,073
Don't put words in my knothole.
I'm 300 years older than you.

1002
01:03:56,106 --> 01:03:58,556
You wanna end up
in a botanical garden?

1003
01:03:59,511 --> 01:04:03,293
Twick or tweat!
OK, trick or treat.

1004
01:04:03,326 --> 01:04:05,238
This is so embarrassing.

1005
01:04:05,272 --> 01:04:07,118

1006
01:04:07,151 --> 01:04:10,093

Where'd you get yours - K-Mart?

1007
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:11,925
Ooh, pretty!
Yeah, yeah.

1008
01:04:11,959 --> 01:04:13,689
She looks like leaf mould.

1009
01:04:13,723 --> 01:04:16,627

you humans amuse yourselves,

take me back to Fantasia!

1066
01:07:18,977 --> 01:07:20,735
...the Nasties do!

1067
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:25,171
♪  Don't believe an illusion

01:07:25,205 --> 01:07:27,306

gonna change the world... ♪

1069
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:28,762

♪  Livin' in a nasty world... ♪

1071
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:32,698
Whoo-hoo-hoooo!

1072
01:07:32,731 --> 01:07:34,259
Hey! Come back here!

1073
01:07:36,895 --> 01:07:38,730
Nicole, where's the Oran?

1074
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,220
He just took it!

1075
01:07:47,249 --> 01:07:49,546
Ohhh! I've got the Oran!

1076
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:52,407
<i>I've got the Oran!
Had the Oran!</i>

1077
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,864
Ooh! Aaagh!

1078
01:07:53,897 --> 01:07:55,506
Nicole, hurry! She's got the Oran!

1079
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,787
She's got it! She's got it!
She has got it!

1080
01:08:02,493 --> 01:08:05,549
Come and get it, Balthazar!

1081
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,075
She's getting away!

1082
01:08:07,108 --> 01:08:08,567
Hey! Wait for me!

1083
01:08:10,095 --> 01:08:13,993
Ahhh, I'm going back
to the garden department.

1084
01:08:22,435 --> 01:08:24,121
Where'd they go?
I don't know.

1085
01:08:24,154 --> 01:08:26,447
They must've used
the Oran to disappear.

1086
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:30,191
What'll happen if you
don't get the Oran back?

1087
01:08:30,225 --> 01:08:31,991
Don't you realise what you've caused?

1088
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:35,272
The entire civilisation of Fantasia
will go down the toilet!

1089
01:08:35,306 --> 01:08:37,832
And maybe ours will go down with it.

1090
01:08:39,971 --> 01:08:42,952
I really hope you enjoyed
your little shopping spree.

1091
01:08:49,141 --> 01:08:51,433
Oh, Nicole!

1092
01:08:52,388 --> 01:08:55,445
Now I'll be telling
the story forever, Balthazar.

1093
01:08:58,424 --> 01:09:00,187
Yo, Empress!

1094
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,058
Check it out, Wilma -

1095
01:09:02,092 --> 01:09:04,499
I'm the new keeper of the book.

1096
01:09:04,532 --> 01:09:07,025
My name is not Wilma.

1097
01:09:07,058 --> 01:09:10,688
Oh!
Yo, Large Head! What's up?

1098
01:09:12,255 --> 01:09:15,425
And, um... Old Man,
you've got more company coming.

1099
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,907
Then Bastian has failed

1100
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:22,761
and the Fantasia that we know
will be a thing of the past.

1101
01:09:38,578 --> 01:09:40,029
Let's get outta here!

1102
01:09:40,063 --> 01:09:42,246
Barky! Let's go!

1103
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:43,701
Bastian!

1104
01:09:43,735 --> 01:09:45,798
Come on, Barky!
Wait! I'm not validated.

1105
01:09:45,832 --> 01:09:47,904
Oh! Ow!

1106
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:52,407
Stop shaking us around,
you great lump of lumber!

1107
01:09:52,441 --> 01:09:54,132
Ah! It's gridlock out here!

1108
01:09:54,165 --> 01:09:59,437
Hundreds of humans are testing out
their air bags at the same time!

1109
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:01,237
These creatures are crazy!

1110
01:10:01,271 --> 01:10:05,206
(ANGRY SHOUTING,
BANGING AND SMASHING

1111
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:08,988
Why are they all being so nasty?

1112
01:10:12,886 --> 01:10:14,757
Mr Coreander?!

1113
01:10:19,342 --> 01:10:22,097
Yo! Chief!
What about the luck dragon?

1114
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:27,212
This is not
my favourite part of the story.

1115
01:10:27,246 --> 01:10:29,467
Looks like he's out of luck.

1116
01:10:31,223 --> 01:10:33,133
Stay with me, Jane!

1117
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:35,010
Where is... Oh, God!

1118
01:10:35,044 --> 01:10:37,355
There they are! There they are!
Bastian!

1119
01:10:37,388 --> 01:10:39,667
Why didn't you say
you were coming here?

1120
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,237
It's like Armageddon out there.

1121
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:44,022
I keep telling you,
let me know where you're going.

1122
01:10:44,056 --> 01:10:45,631
Nicole, look at you.

1123
01:10:45,665 --> 01:10:48,759
Nicole, would you
take your stuff now, please?

1124
01:10:48,793 --> 01:10:51,395
Where'd you get the money
for all this?

1125
01:10:51,429 --> 01:10:53,150
They gave it to me.

1126
01:10:53,184 --> 01:10:54,839
They gave this to you?!

1127
01:10:54,873 --> 01:10:57,017
Nicole, sweetie,
I don't quite understand.

1128
01:10:57,050 --> 01:11:01,176
The stores just decide to give
Nicole half their inventory?!

1129
01:11:01,209 --> 01:11:04,805
I want the truth, young lady,
and I want it now!

1130
01:11:04,839 --> 01:11:06,300
I wished for it.
What?!

1131
01:11:06,334 --> 01:11:08,435
Barney, give her
a chance to explain.

1132
01:11:08,468 --> 01:11:11,145
Don't tell me what to do, Jane!

1133
01:11:11,178 --> 01:11:13,822
See? I knew this would happen!

1134
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:17,184
Nicole!
You come back here this second!

1135
01:11:17,218 --> 01:11:18,712
Dad!

1136
01:11:19,705 --> 01:11:21,405
The Nasty is controlling you!

1137
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:23,106
Don't give in to the darkness.

1138
01:11:24,519 --> 01:11:25,933
Come on!

1139
01:11:29,065 --> 01:11:30,689
This is so cool!
No, no!

1140
01:11:30,722 --> 01:11:32,279
Vile creatures, stay out!

1141
01:11:32,312 --> 01:11:34,227
Let them in, you globe-domed geek!

1142
01:11:34,261 --> 01:11:36,515
Empress, you said
no cheap head jokes.

1143
01:11:36,549 --> 01:11:38,506
So sue me! Huh!

1144
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:42,094
Honeykins, can you come in here?
What is it now?

1145
01:11:42,127 --> 01:11:43,512
Yaaaaa!

1146
01:11:43,545 --> 01:11:46,372
Is that the best you can do?

1147
01:11:46,406 --> 01:11:48,664
Ugh!
Eeeeeow!

1148
01:11:51,912 --> 01:11:53,406
Nicole!

1149
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,274
Nicole! Wait!

1150
01:11:55,308 --> 01:11:57,260
Nicole!

1151
01:11:59,476 --> 01:12:00,966
Nicole!

1152
01:12:01,998 --> 01:12:03,378
Hey!
Let me go!

1153
01:12:03,412 --> 01:12:06,468
Your mom and my dad
are at each other's throats.

1154
01:12:06,501 --> 01:12:08,000
I don't care!
You must!

1155
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,040
They're our parents! We're a family!

1156
01:12:10,073 --> 01:12:12,046
No, we're not! It's better this way.

1157
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,578
Better to do it now.

1158
01:12:13,612 --> 01:12:16,439
Do what now?
Let them fight and get divorced.

1159
01:12:16,472 --> 01:12:19,004
My parents used to fight
all the time.

1160
01:12:19,038 --> 01:12:23,278
First my dad would yell at me,
then they'd yell at each other!

1161
01:12:23,312 --> 01:12:26,389
It's all happening again!
It's not! It's the Nasty!

1162
01:12:26,422 --> 01:12:29,467
We have to stop it!
You can't stop it. I tried.

1163
01:12:29,501 --> 01:12:31,874
No matter what I did
it didn't stop.

1164
01:12:31,908 --> 01:12:33,674
They still got divorced.

1165
01:12:33,707 --> 01:12:37,375
This is my story
and I'm not gonna let it happen.

1166
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:38,755
Bastian!

1167
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:40,393
Bastian!

1168
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,226
Are you OK?

1169
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,926
What happened?

1170
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:50,174
I thought you were electrocuted.

1171
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:51,702
It scared me.

1172
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:57,203
Bastian, I'm gonna help you
get the Oran back.

1173
01:12:57,237 --> 01:12:58,660
Why should you help?

1174
01:12:58,694 --> 01:13:02,781
At least this way your mom will get
her stupid sewing room back.

1175
01:13:04,272 --> 01:13:06,798
Bastian. Bastian.

1176
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:09,123
What? I look too 'un' for you?
Stop it!

1177
01:13:09,157 --> 01:13:11,416
Unsophisticated? Uncool?
I'm sick of it!

1178
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:13,326
You're a spoilt little brat!

1179
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,783
Stop it!

1180
01:13:14,816 --> 01:13:17,376
It's the Nasty
that's doing this, not you.

1181
01:13:17,409 --> 01:13:19,138
You would never act this way.

1182
01:13:19,172 --> 01:13:21,999
Don't you understand?
You're too nice.

1183
01:13:22,032 --> 01:13:23,417
Oh, yeah!

1184
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,595
I want it to be your room.

1185
01:13:25,628 --> 01:13:29,869
I'm sorry for all the mean things
I ever said to you.

1186
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:34,038
I want you to be my brother.

1187
01:13:34,072 --> 01:13:37,089
You really do want me for a brother?

1188
01:13:37,123 --> 01:13:38,580
Yes.

1189
01:13:39,687 --> 01:13:42,323
I just didn't want
to get hurt again.

1190
01:13:43,317 --> 01:13:44,921
What are we waiting for?

1191
01:13:46,373 --> 01:13:49,009
Let's go!
Let's jam!

1192
01:13:49,043 --> 01:13:50,542
Want to go home!

1193
01:13:50,576 --> 01:13:54,167
Yeah, yeah. I miss Fantasia too.

1194
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:56,540
So do we!

1195
01:13:56,574 --> 01:13:58,832
Alright! Alright already!

1196
01:13:58,866 --> 01:14:01,292
We'll go back to the toy department.

1197
01:14:01,326 --> 01:14:03,685
Hold your boulders, will ya...
Whoa!

1198
01:14:03,718 --> 01:14:07,042
"Bark Troll's branch
pushes the dumpster aside

1199
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:10,366
"and then they step inside
the Nasties' hide-out.

1200
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:12,484
"And Bark Troll exclaimed..."

1201
01:14:12,517 --> 01:14:14,535
"Oh, no! It's an ambush!"

1202
01:14:14,569 --> 01:14:17,300
Hands off.
Hey, don't touch the bark.

1203
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:20,032
I'm 300 years old.
Show some respect.

1204
01:14:20,065 --> 01:14:21,564
Kissy kiss?

1205
01:14:21,598 --> 01:14:25,232
Barky!

1206
01:14:25,265 --> 01:14:26,679
Come on!

1207
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,472
Vile crustacean!

1208
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:32,906
My Empress,
don't give in to the Nasty!

1209
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,817
Empress! Help me!

1210
01:14:36,307 --> 01:14:39,062
This is where we lost them.
They're not here now.

1211
01:14:39,095 --> 01:14:42,954
If I were
six feet taller I'd pulverise you!

1212
01:14:42,988 --> 01:14:44,597
You hear that?
I did.

1213
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:46,125
Go!

1214
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:51,550
Come down to my size
and I'll have you, my lad!

1215
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:58,126
Balthazar!

1216
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,949
What took you so long?

1217
01:15:02,324 --> 01:15:06,469
You know, I've been reading
all about your mommy and your daddy.

1218
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:10,615
Things are getting a little nasty
over at the Bucks residence.

1219
01:15:10,648 --> 01:15:12,219
You made it that way!

1220
01:15:12,252 --> 01:15:14,089
No. You did!

1221
01:15:14,122 --> 01:15:15,892
And you too.

1222
01:15:15,925 --> 01:15:17,725
Don't go blaming it on me.

1223
01:15:17,759 --> 01:15:20,739
I didn't put those words
into your parents' mouths.

1224
01:15:21,732 --> 01:15:23,342
They said it themselves.

1225
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:25,018
Don't you care about anything?!

1226
01:15:26,202 --> 01:15:29,793
You have to live in the human world
after all this too.

1227
01:15:29,827 --> 01:15:32,582
If you destroy everything
it'll be bad for you!

1228
01:15:32,616 --> 01:15:34,000
And you and everybody!

1229
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:36,937
He's right, chief!
Give him the necklace back.

1230
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:39,808
I don't want anything bad
happening to my mother.

1231
01:15:39,841 --> 01:15:43,088
Wanna know something? Something bad
already happened to your mother.

1232
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,502
What?

1233
01:15:45,763 --> 01:15:47,253
You!

1234
01:15:47,286 --> 01:15:48,709
Oh!

1235
01:15:48,743 --> 01:15:51,360
I've got the Oran!
I've got the Oran!

1236
01:15:51,393 --> 01:15:53,977
You've lost the Oran!
Ooh, yeah!

1237
01:15:55,696 --> 01:15:58,600
What are you doing?
I wish...

1238
01:16:02,114 --> 01:16:03,643
Nicole, the book!

1239
01:16:05,935 --> 01:16:08,074
Big man, Balthazar...

1240
01:16:10,978 --> 01:16:13,079
...when you got the necklace.

1241
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,677
Put it down.

1242
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:17,210
Put it down!

1243
01:16:17,244 --> 01:16:19,994
Then we'll see
what a big man you are.

1244
01:16:21,026 --> 01:16:22,902
In front of your sister!

1245
01:16:22,936 --> 01:16:25,037
Don't do it!
You've got the Oran!

1246
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,403
You can turn him into a duck.

1247
01:16:27,437 --> 01:16:29,737
I frightened, Bastian.

1248
01:16:32,716 --> 01:16:35,276
"Bastian placed
the necklace down...

1249
01:16:42,268 --> 01:16:46,202
"...then put into practice all
those years of... karate lessons."

1250
01:16:46,236 --> 01:16:48,728
Karate lessons?!

1251
01:16:48,762 --> 01:16:52,201
"'Ha-ha! Karate lessons! ' yelled
Slip, bursting with laughter."

1252
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:54,880
What are you doing?
I only took two lessons!

1253
01:16:54,913 --> 01:16:58,600
"Bastian starts circling,
waiting for his moment to attack."

1254
01:16:58,633 --> 01:17:01,453
Go home, Bastian!

1255
01:17:01,487 --> 01:17:04,240
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

1256
01:17:04,274 --> 01:17:06,298
I'm sorry! That's what it says.

1257
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:09,245
To heck with what the book says.

1258
01:17:09,278 --> 01:17:11,762
Careful, Bastian.
Take it easy.

1259
01:17:11,796 --> 01:17:13,256
"All at once,

1260
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:16,823
"it was if Bastian was transformed
into a deadly combination

1261
01:17:16,857 --> 01:17:20,358
"of Bruce Lee, Steven Seagal
and Jean-Claude Van Damme."

1262
01:17:20,392 --> 01:17:23,223
Don't worry, chief.
It's just a bluff.

1263
01:17:24,789 --> 01:17:28,800
"Bastian blocks Slip's attack
and counters with a karate chop

1264
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:31,666
"and then... kicks him away."

1265
01:17:31,699 --> 01:17:34,383
I'll kill him! Come on!

1266
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:37,053
Go on! Go on!
Give him a left!

1267
01:17:37,087 --> 01:17:38,510
"Bastian turns from Slip

1268
01:17:38,543 --> 01:17:41,561
"and performs a miraculous
flying kick to Dog."

1269
01:17:41,595 --> 01:17:43,285
Yes! Come on, lad!

1270
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:45,229
Careful, Bastian.

1271
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,228
I'm back!

1272
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:50,162
Falkor!

1273
01:17:50,195 --> 01:17:53,405
"They see Falkor and...
run for their lives!"

1274
01:17:53,438 --> 01:17:55,773
Get off! Get off!

1275
01:17:57,187 --> 01:17:59,899
We go home now.

1276
01:17:59,932 --> 01:18:02,578
Hooray! Ha-hah!

1277
01:18:02,612 --> 01:18:05,363
Get the...
Ah... perhaps not.

1278
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:12,698
Oh, my God!
What?

1279
01:18:12,731 --> 01:18:15,339
Oh, no! What now, huh?

1280
01:18:15,372 --> 01:18:17,096
"Meanwhile,
back at Jane's house,

1281
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:22,173
"Barney and Jane's short honeymoon
had turned into a living nightmare.

1282
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:27,216
"After only one week of marriage,
Barney decided to call it quits."

1283
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:29,699
Let me see that.

1284
01:18:31,304 --> 01:18:35,468
"And over in the Rockchewers'
dwelling, things were just as bad."

1285
01:18:35,501 --> 01:18:36,810
Dadda?

1286
01:18:36,844 --> 01:18:38,983
From now on, woman...

1287
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:42,765
...l'm going to be a rolling stone!

1288
01:18:42,799 --> 01:18:45,215
Fine with me! Hmmph! Fool.

1289
01:18:45,249 --> 01:18:48,076
Oh, no! They've taken my story
to the future!

1290
01:18:48,109 --> 01:18:50,254
All this stuff's already happened.

1291
01:18:50,287 --> 01:18:51,709
Don't come back!

1292
01:18:51,743 --> 01:18:53,850
Don't worry, I won't!

1293
01:18:53,883 --> 01:18:58,085
No, Dadda!
No leave Mama!

1294
01:18:59,728 --> 01:19:03,591
Hmm... no. Must be dreaming.

1295
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:06,452
No, Daddy! Don't go!

1296
01:19:07,636 --> 01:19:09,126
Nicole?

1297
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:16,046
Nicole, Falkor's here now.

1298
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,664
We have to wish the Fantasians back
before we get rid of the Nasties.

1299
01:19:20,698 --> 01:19:23,584
Ah... l'm gonna miss you, kid.

1300
01:19:23,618 --> 01:19:26,401
Bye-bye, Barky. I'll miss you.

1301
01:19:26,434 --> 01:19:28,726
You too, Falkor.
'Bye, Bastian.

1302
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,018
Ooooh!
Yes, you too, Junior.

1303
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:35,698
'Bye, Bastian.

1304
01:19:35,731 --> 01:19:37,326
I go home now.

1305
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:40,989
Alright, everybody,
get in wish position.

1306
01:19:41,023 --> 01:19:42,364
Good luck, lad.

1307
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:52,985
Dadda!

1308
01:19:53,635 --> 01:19:57,035
We wish that Fantasia
would go back to how it was

1309
01:19:57,069 --> 01:19:59,862
before this Nasty business started.

1310
01:20:11,286 --> 01:20:13,043
Oooooh!

1311
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:14,800
It worked!

1312
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,013
Barney!

1313
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:34,365
Barney!

1314
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:36,118
No! Please, don't go, Dad!

1315
01:20:36,152 --> 01:20:37,537
Don't go!

1316
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:39,060
Nicole!
I'm home!

1317
01:20:39,094 --> 01:20:40,554
Are you OK?

1318
01:20:40,588 --> 01:20:42,461
Hi, Mom!
Bastian!

1319
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:46,740
I was worried sick about you,
you crazy kid!

1320
01:20:46,773 --> 01:20:48,234
Are you sure you're OK?

1321
01:20:48,267 --> 01:20:50,846
You'll never believe
what happened, Dad!

1322
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:53,425
Oh, I think I might believe
what happened.

1323
01:20:53,459 --> 01:20:55,030
Welcome home, Nicole!

1324
01:20:56,596 --> 01:20:58,850
Dr Dumont said it would work out!

1325
01:21:06,912 --> 01:21:08,903
I hope you learned something, kid.

1326
01:21:08,936 --> 01:21:13,215
Be careful what you wish - you might
wind up trapped in a shopping mall!

1327
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:14,710
Me - I wish small.

1328
01:21:14,743 --> 01:21:18,335
I got new leaves.
I got a new lease of life!

1329
01:21:18,368 --> 01:21:19,863
Bye-bye, Barky!

1330
01:21:21,773 --> 01:21:24,371
Oh, ah... look! There's your daddy!

1331
01:21:24,405 --> 01:21:25,828
Go kiss him.

1332
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:27,867
Mama! Dadda!

1333
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,839
I'm home!

1334
01:21:29,873 --> 01:21:32,336
My baby!
Junior!

1335
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:34,767
Oh!
He's home!

1336
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:40,226
If I can just get the root rot
to clear up, everything will be fine.

1337
01:21:57,341 --> 01:21:58,832
Hi.

1338
01:22:03,264 --> 01:22:06,439
Bastian and Nicole! Hi!

1339
01:22:06,472 --> 01:22:08,650
Nicole, you know
my girlfriend Marcia.

1340
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,241
I do?
Sure you do.

1341
01:22:16,826 --> 01:22:20,456
You kids better run along.
We mustn't be late for our classes.

1342
01:22:20,489 --> 01:22:21,946
Heavens, no.
Gosh, no.

1343
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:23,643
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

1344
01:22:23,677 --> 01:22:25,274
'Bye.
'Bye.

1345
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:27,069
See you later.
'Bye.

1346
01:22:27,103 --> 01:22:29,128
Well, sis, how'd you like the ending?

1347
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,878
You did that?

1348
01:22:31,912 --> 01:22:33,598
Yeah!

1349
01:22:46,282 --> 01:22:49,644
The story's not over yet, young man.

1350
01:22:49,677 --> 01:22:51,669
Run along.

1351
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:07,180
Yeah!

1352
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:14,247
