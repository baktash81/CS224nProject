00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,900
They were physicists
and mathematicians,
astronomers.

172
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,820
They were concerned with
the Church's inaccurate teaching

173
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,860
and they were dedicated
to scientific truth.

174
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,500
But the Vatican
didn't like that.

175
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,580
So the Church began to...
How did you say it?

176
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,660
Oh, " hunt them down
and kill them."

177
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,340
Drove them underground.

178
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,780
Into a secret society.

LANGDON: Yes.

181
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,860
Welcome to
Vatican City.

182
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,860
Ernesto Olivetti,
inspector general
of the Vatican police force.

183
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,940
My pleasure.
- This way, please.

184
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,620
We'll meet in the headquarters
of the Swiss Guard.

185
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,860
I thought you were
Swiss Guard.

186
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,660
<i>No, la Gendarmeria.</i>

187
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,220
We are responsible for everything
inside the Vatican walls

188
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,660
with the exception
of the security of His Holiness

189
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,380
Yeah.
- and the Apostolic Palace.

190
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,060
That is Swiss Guard.

191
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,700
The Roman carabinieri are here
as well in an advisory capacity.

192
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,460
So jurisdictionally,
this is...

193
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,420
A goddamn nightmare.

194
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,860
LANGDON:
Oh, yes, Pope Pius IX's
great castration.

195
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,860
OLIVETTI: I beg your pardon?
LANGDON: 1857, Pope Pius IX

196
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,420
felt the male form
would inspire lust.

197
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,020
So he took
a hammer and chisel

198
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,740
and unmanned hundreds
of these statues.

199
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,660
The plaster fig leaves
were added later.

200
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,100
Are you anti-Catholic,
Professor Langdon?

201
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,540
No. I'm anti-vandalism.

202
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,420
I urge you to
guard your tone here.

203
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,500
The Swiss Guard is a calling,
not a profession,

204
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,260
and it encourages
a certain zealotry.

205
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,300
Commander Richter,
the head of the Guard,

206
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,060
is a deeply spiritual man,

207
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,660
and he was close
to the late pope.
Understood?

208
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,820
Look, I don't study symbols
because I consider them
unimportant.

209
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,220
Ceremony, traditions,
it's how we mark our lives.

210
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,180
I just... I just hope I can help.

211
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,900
So do I.

212
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,380
You were my idea.

Well, we have
bigger problems
than that now.

Dr. Vetra?

<i>I'm Commander Richter,

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,060
Hello.

223
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,460
Professor Langdon.
- Yes.

224
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,020
What a relief,
the symbologist is here.

225
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,100
This way,
please, Miss Vetra.

226
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,700
The situation
has changed.

227
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,020
We received another threat
from the kidnapper.

228
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,860
VITTORIA:
The canister was stolen from our lab
around noon yesterday.

229
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,420
The intruder killed
my research partner,
Silvano Bentivoglio,

230
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,740
and mutilated him
in order to bypass security.

231
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,620
We use
retinal scanners.

232
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,180
They cut out his eye.

233
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,580
RICHTER:
Is that your stolen canister,
Miss Vetra?

234
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,260
Where is that camera,
Number 86?

235
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,980
It's wireless.
It, too, was stolen.

236
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,900
It could be anywhere
inside the Vatican walls.

237
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,180
That canister
contains an extremely
combustible substance

238
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,340
called antimatter.

239
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,940
We need to locate it
immediately or
evacuate Vatican City.

240
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm quite familiar
with incendiaries, Miss Vetra.

241
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,860
I've never heard of antimatter
being used as such.

242
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,900
Well, it's never been generated
in significant quantities before.

243
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,660
It's a way of
studying the origins
of the universe,

244
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,580
to try to isolate
what some people call
"the God particle."

245
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,860
But there are implications
for energy research...

246
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,820
"The God particle"?

247
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,540
What we call it isn't important.

248
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,300
It's what gives
all matter mass.

249
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,340
The thing without which
we could not exist.

250
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,100
You're talking about
the moment of creation.

251
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,820
Yes. In a way, I am.

252
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,820
The antimatter is suspended there

253
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,420
in an airtight nanocomposite shell
with electromagnets in each end.

254
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,740
But if it were to fall out of suspension
and come in contact with matter,

255
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,660
say, the bottom of the canister,
the two opposing forces

256
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,820
would annihilate one another
violently.

257
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,180
And what might cause it
to fall out of suspension?

258
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,700
The battery going dead.

259
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,220
Which it will,
just before midnight.

260
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,980
What kind of annihilation?
How violent?

261
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,820
A cataclysmic event.

262
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,300
A blinding explosion equivalent
to about five kilotons.

263
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,300
Vatican City
will be consumed by light.

264
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,580
Those are the exact words
the kidnapper used.

273
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,580

"Brand" them.

281
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,220
That's another Illuminati legend.

282
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,540
This one says that
there are a set of five brands,

283
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,860
each one an ambigram.

284
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,460
The first four are the fundamental
elements of science:

285
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,620
Earth, air, fire and water.

286
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,180
The fifth, it's a mystery.

287
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,180
Maybe it's this.

288
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,380
He said they'd be killed publicly.

289
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020

don't even read

293
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,380
1668, the Church kidnapped
four Illuminati scientists

294
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,580
and branded
each one of them
on the chest

295
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,580
with the symbol
of the cross

296
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,220
to purge them of their sins,
and they executed them.

297
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,540
Threw their bodies
out into the street
as a warning

298
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,180
to others to stop questioning
Church rulings on scientific matters.

299
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,340

more violent Illuminati,</i>

Look how they intend
to finally get it:

303
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,860
Using antimatter, technology,
to destroy the Church.

304
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,220
Science obliterates religion.

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,100

Professor, I don't think
this is the appropriate moment...

314
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,100
Your petition has been denied
seven times.

315
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,620
No, no. This has nothing to do with
my work. The Path of Illumination

316
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,500
is a hidden trail
through Rome itself that leads
to the Church of the Illumination,

317
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,620
the place where the Illuminati
would meet in secret.

<i>If I can find the segno, the sign,</i>

319

Then the device
explodes at midnight.

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,620
If we can figure out the first church
and get there before he does,

324
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,780
maybe we can stop it.
But I can't find the start of the path

Even if I wanted to help you,

327

access to the archives
is only by written decree

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,580

Comandante, have you begun
the search for this explosive device?

342
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,300
Of course, but it could
be anywhere.

My primary concern
at the moment is
the safety of the cardinals.

are in conclave,
your security concerns

though I am not His Holiness,
when you are addressing me,

350
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,900
you are addressing this office.

No one but the research team.
This project was strictly confidential.

361
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,900
But Silvano kept detailed journals.

If he told anyone else

363
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,300

we were doing, he would
have made a note of it.

1366

deeply conflicted about
the implications of his work

Like Galileo.

1369
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:05,020
About a month ago, he requested
an audience with the pope,

1370
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:06,820
but you know that.

1371
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:10,100
Because you granted
the audience, and you were
also present during it.

1372
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:13,140
The God particle.
To actually claim
an act of creation.

1373
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:15,060
The blasphemy. The arrogance.

1374
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:17,700
The Holy Father didn't see it
like that.

1375
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:19,700
He urged him to go public.

1376
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,700
His Holiness
thought that the discovery

1377
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:25,740
could actually scientifically
prove the existence
of a divine power

1378
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:28,780
and begin to bridge the gap
between science and religion.

1379
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:31,540
His work was not religious,
it was sacrilegious.

1380
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:36,380
But you... You saw
the pope's position as
a softening of Church law.

1381
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:40,620
As an old man's weakness.
Your father's weakness.

1382
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:42,860
You murdered the Vicar of Christ.

1383
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:46,740
He raised me
to protect this Church,
even from within.

1384
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:50,740
And then you conjured up
an old enemy from the past.

1385
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:52,660
The Illuminati.

1386
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:56,780
You found the ancient
brands in the papal vaults,
and put them to use.

1387
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:57,940
To spread fear.

1388
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:00,420
The cardinals
are men of belief.

1389
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:03,940
Right now, their belief in evil
is uniting them.

1390
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:07,140
The entire Catholic world
will be united by this attack.

There is no attack.

1392
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:12,780
You're trying to
convince the cardinals
they're in a war

1393
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:14,940
so they will choose a warrior
to lead them.

1394
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:16,180
