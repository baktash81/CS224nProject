2
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:23,838
I'm voting for Dukakis.

3
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:28,565
Hm ...

4
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,526
Well ...

5
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:35,833
Maybe when you have children
who need braces ...

6
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:41,241
and half of your husband's pay
cheque goes to the federal government,

7
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:44,324
- you'll regret that.
- My husband's pay cheque?

8
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:50,087
I'm not squeezing
one out till I'm 30.

9
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,650
Will you still be at the Yarn Barn?

10
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:54,843
That's a great place
to raise children.

11
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:59,487
- That's really funny.
- I think a year of partyings enough.

12
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:03,447
- She's going to Harvard next fall.
- I haven't gotten in yet.

13
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:07,607
You think Dukakis will provide for
America till you squeeze one out?

14
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:08,967
Yeah, I do.

15
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:12,007
- When can I squeeze one out?
- Eighth grade.

16
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:16,167
Excuse me.

17
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,367
Donnie, you're such a dick.

18
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:22,647
Whoa, Elizabeth!
A little hostile there.

19
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:24,967
Maybe you should be in therapy,

20
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:28,327
then Mom and Dad can pay someone
to listen to your thoughts ...

21
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,167
so we don't have to.

22
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:34,607
Ok. Tell us why you stopped
taking your medication.

23
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:37,757
You're such a fuck-ass!

24
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:41,287
- Please.
- Did you just call me a fuck-ass?

25
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:44,167
- That's enough.
- Go suck a fuck!

26
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:48,647
- How does one suck a fuck?
- Shall I tell you?

27
00:05:48,737 --> 00:05:51,847
- Please.
- Not at the dinner table.

28
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,047
- Stop.
- Fuck ...

29
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,367
What's a fuck-ass?

30
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:15,847
I took a year off to be with you.

31
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:21,567
- What?
- How did you know?

32
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:26,367
- I didn't know it was a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

33
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,887
I'm reading. Get out.

34
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:43,207
Where do you go at night?

35
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:47,687
- just get out.
- Did you toilet-paper the Johnson's house?

36
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:50,537
- Is that why you're here?
- No.

37
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:54,407
I stopped rolling houses
in the sixth grade.

38
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:58,167
Where's my son?
I don't recognise you.

39
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:00,567
Then you take the goddamn pills.

40
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:12,887
Bitch.

41
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:34,127
Our son just called me a bitch.

42
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:39,127
You're not a bitch.

43
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:43,727
You're bitching,
but you're not a bitch.

44
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:25,327
I want to be a president
who makes sure that we ...

45
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:29,277
never again do business with a
drug-running Panamanian dictator ...

46
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:32,527
or funnel aid to the Contras
through drug dealers,

47
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,327
Values begin at the top,

48
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:38,567
Dukakis ... Son of a bitch.

49
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:42,167
Those are the values I want
to bring to the presidency ...

50
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:44,287
and to the White House,

51
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:46,807
- Panama is a friendly country.
- Tell him, George.

52
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:52,407
I talked to the president of Panama
about their money laundering,

53
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:55,927
Mr. Noriega was there,
but there was no evidence,

54
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:58,927
When the evidence was there,
we indicted him,

55
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:12,197
I've been watching you,

56
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:59,007
Come closer,

57
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:10,887
closer,

58
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:36,487
28 days,

59
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,887
six hours,

60
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:42,487
42 minutes,

61
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,887
12 seconds,

62
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:55,037
That is when the world will end.

63
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:58,317
Why?

64
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:03,287
Son? Donnie Darko?

65
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:08,837
Donnie Darko?
What the heck's going on here?

66
00:13:09,177 --> 00:13:11,207
- Who is it?
- It's Eddie Darko's kid.

67
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:13,677
He's just a neighbourhood kid.

68
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:17,847
Guess he was sleep-golfing?

69
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:20,527
Watch out for that drool spot!

70
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:27,487
Are you all right, son?

71
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:35,597
So let's stay off
the links at night, Ok?

72
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:40,127
I'm sorry, Dr Fisher.
It ... It won't happen again.

73
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:43,887
- Kids ...
- Let's golf.

74
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:01,407
- No one's allowed.
- This is my house.

75
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:03,847
- I said ...
- This is my house!

76
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:33,127
Wait a minute.

77
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:37,087
- Here's your brother.
- It fell in your room.

78
00:14:57,617 --> 00:15:01,047
Ms Darko? I'm Bob Garland.
I'm with the FAA.

79
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:07,647
- The what?
- I'm with the FAA. May we speak privately?

80
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:10,207
- In private?
- Please.

81
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,007
- And here ...
- Ok.

82
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:35,967
All right, we have arranged a hotel.

83
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:38,927
Get some sleep
and we'll take care of this.

84
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:40,887
- Great.
- Thank you.

85
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:43,607
Kids, come on.
We're going to a hotel.

86
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,277
They don't know where it came from.

87
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:07,367
- Where's Pop?
- He's still at work,

88
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:11,287
If it fell from the plane ...
what happened to the plane?

89
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:15,487
They don't know, Samantha.

90
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:21,737
Can't we make money from this?
Can't we sue the airline?

91
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,647
Shut up, Sam.

92
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,167
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie?
He stinks.

93
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,257
When you fall asleep tonight,

94
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:36,127
- I'm gonna fart in your face.
- I'm telling Mom!

95
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:39,317
Samantha, don't go over there.

96
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,637
Frankie Feedler.

97
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:53,447
You remember. From high school.

98
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:05,047
He died. Remember?

99
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:13,167
On his way to the prom.

100
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,367
They said he was doomed.

101
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:24,607
Jesus.

102
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:31,927
They could be saying
the same thing about Donnie.

103
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,287
Our Donnie.

104
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:42,807
But he dodged it.

105
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,047
He dodged his photograph.

106
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,727
Somebody was watching over him.

107
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:22,287
Mrs Farmer will bring you home
after practice. Bye, honey.

108
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:24,527
Donnie ... good luck.

109
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:28,927
- Oh, my God! Tell me everything.
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.

110
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:31,687
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, Cherita.

111
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:35,837
- Shut up!
- Darko cheats death! Huh?

112
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:40,847
You're a celebrity! I called you
a jillion times. Where you been?

113
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:44,557
- At a hotel.
- Dad saw you at the golf course.

114
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:48,327
- You sleep-walking again, buddy?
- I don't want to talk about it.

115
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:51,847
Now that you're famous,
have a smoke.

116
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:58,647
What happens
if you tell Mom and Dad, Sam?

117
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:03,287
- You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
- Goddamn right, I will.

118
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:07,767
- So grody.
- Hey, Cherita, you want a cigarette?

119
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:10,807
- Shut up!
- "Shut up!"

120
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:13,247
Go back to China, bitch!

121
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:16,647
Just leave her alone.

122
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:21,957
- That's some good shit, huh?
- It's a fucking cigarette.

123
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:58,927
"There would be headlines
in the papers.

124
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,927
The grown-up gangs who ran
the betting at the wrestling ...

125
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:03,687
and the barrow-boys
would hear with respect ...

126
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:07,317
of how Old Misery's house
had been destroyed.

127
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:11,807
It was as though this plan had
been with him all his life,

128
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,247
pondered through the seasons,
now, in his 15th year,

129
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:18,247
crystallised with the
pain of puberty."

130
00:22:21,377 --> 00:22:25,367
What is Graham Greene trying
to communicate with this passage?

131
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:29,167
Why did the children
break into Old Misery's house?

132
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:32,807
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.

133
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:36,567
If you had actually
read the short story,

134
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:41,207
which was a whopping 13 pages,
you'd know that the children ...

135
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:44,887
find a great deal of money
in the mattress, but burn it.

136
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:53,487
Donnie Darko, perhaps with your
recent brush with mass destruction,

137
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:55,647
you can give us your opinion.

138
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:01,967
They say it when they flood the
house, when they tear it to shreds,

139
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:04,287
that destruction
is a form of creation,

140
00:23:04,377 --> 00:23:06,727
so burning the money is ironic.

141
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:11,367
They just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.

142
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,407
They want to change things.

143
00:23:19,737 --> 00:23:23,247
- May we help you?
- Yeah, I just registered.

144
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:27,407
- They put me in the wrong class.
- You look like you belong here.

145
00:23:29,297 --> 00:23:31,367
Um ... Where do I sit?

146
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:37,807
Sit next to the boy
you think is the cutest.

147
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:39,477
Quiet!

148
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:42,967
Let her choose.

149
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,407
Joanie, get up.

150
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:35,487
What people don't understand
is that Dukakis ...

151
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:39,007
does not have
the financial infrastructure,

152
00:24:46,537 --> 00:24:49,207
Well, the construction guys ...

153
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:52,407
say it will take about a week
to fix the roof.

154
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:55,647
Airline better not fuck us
on the shingle match.

155
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:59,297
- They still don't know?
- Know what?

156
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:05,237
- Where it came from?
- Oh, no. They can't tell us.

157
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:09,847
Something about a matching
serial number that got burned.

158
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:14,607
I had to sign a form saying I
wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

159
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:18,847
So we can't tell anyone
what nobody knows?

160
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:24,887
Yeah. But you tell ...
What's your doctor's name?

161
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:30,527
- Dr. Thurman, Dad.
- Yes. Tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.

162
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:32,837
- Dad.
- What?

163
00:25:32,937 --> 00:25:34,727
- Dad!
- Oh ...!

164
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:42,847
What's that woman doing
in the middle of the damn road?!

165
00:25:58,017 --> 00:26:00,447
No mail today. Maybe tomorrow.

166
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:18,847
What did she say to you?

167
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,487
- I made a new friend.
- Real or imaginary?

168
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:33,727
- Imaginary.
- Would you like to talk about this friend?

169
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,287
- Frank.
- Frank.

170
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:39,927
- What did he say?
- He said to follow him.

171
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,847
- Follow him? Where?
- Into the future.

172
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:45,487
And then what happens?

173
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:50,207
And then he said ...

174
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:54,367
then he said that the world
was coming to an end.

175
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:57,287
Do you think
the world is coming to an end?

176
00:27:01,777 --> 00:27:02,887
No.

177
00:27:05,577 --> 00:27:07,247
That's stupid.

178
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:12,957
For my entire life
I was a victim of my own fear.

179
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:15,927
Love,

180
00:27:17,337 --> 00:27:20,287
I was feeding fear with food.

181
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:25,487
Fear,

182
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:35,287
Finally, I looked in the mirror.

183
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:39,807
Not just in the mirror,
I looked THROUGH the mirror,

184
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:44,127
In that image,
I saw my ego reflection,

185
00:27:48,177 --> 00:27:50,637
For two years,
I thought it was normal ...

186
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:53,037
for a 10-year-old to wet the bed,

187
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:55,207
Shh! Quiet!

188
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:01,247
But the solution
was there all the time,

189
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:03,927
I'm not afraid any more!

190
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:09,967
All over America, people have
come together to join hands,

191
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:16,927
People who believe that human life
is absolutely too important,

192
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:22,957
too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear.

193
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:26,807
Pay close attention,
You could miss something.

194
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:31,567
Hello, My name is Jim Cunningham
And welcome to "Controlling Fear".

195
00:29:35,737 --> 00:29:38,037
"... and the prince
was led into a world ...

196
00:29:38,137 --> 00:29:40,437
of strange and beautiful magic."

197
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:41,677
Wow.

198
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:46,927
"The Last Unicorn"
by Samantha Darko.

199
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:50,407
- Give it back!
- "There was once a unicorn named Ariel ..."

200
00:29:52,377 --> 00:29:56,527
- You wrinkled it.
- It's not wrinkled, Sam.

201
00:29:56,617 --> 00:30:00,047
It's 7:45. The bus should've
been here 20 minutes ago.

202
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:03,087
Maybe Martha finally went nuts
and hijacked it.

203
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:06,647
There's this rule ―
at 7:45, we get to go home.

204
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:08,487
There's no rule.

205
00:30:08,577 --> 00:30:12,847
Cherita, you should ... go home.

206
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:16,767
Yeah, if you're here when the bus
comes, we'll get in trouble.

207
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,007
- Shut up!
- "Shut up!"

208
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:23,527
Hey, Porky Pig ...
I hope you get molested.

209
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:27,527
Hey! Hey! I can't believe this!

210
00:30:29,737 --> 00:30:32,607
School's closed
today because it's flooded.

211
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,967
- No way!
- Yeah.

212
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:37,647
Holy shit!
That's the best news ever!

213
00:30:44,897 --> 00:30:47,607
My God, is this ever going to stop?

214
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:52,717
Eventually, yes. But right now,
I got 12 classrooms full of water.

215
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,277
All coming
from a busted water main.

216
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,317
- What else?
- What else?

217
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:01,047
Principal Cole,
I'll show you what else.

218
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:08,007
That's unbelievable.
That's solid bronze, isn't it?

219
00:31:08,097 --> 00:31:10,007
- Yep.
- How did this happen?

220
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:12,687
I heard a cat burglar
trashed everything ...

221
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:15,127
and the Mongrel
got his head cut off.

222
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:16,967
- Hah!
- True!

223
00:31:24,537 --> 00:31:26,207
Beth's mom said the boys' locker
room flooded ...

224
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:28,567
and they found faeces everywhere.

225
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:30,887
- What are faeces?
- Baby mice.

226
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:44,917
Hey.

227
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:49,287
Has anyone ever told you
that you're sexy?

228
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:51,807
I like your boobs.

229
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:53,807
Hey.

230
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,607
Hey.

231
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,727
School's cancelled.

232
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:03,927
Do you want to walk me home?

233
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:05,757
Sure.

234
00:32:15,377 --> 00:32:17,447
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.

235
00:32:17,537 --> 00:32:20,727
Check your backpack.
Those guys steal shit.

236
00:32:20,817 --> 00:32:22,647
Fuck 'em!

237
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:28,767
- So, why'd you move here?
- My parents got a divorce.

238
00:32:28,857 --> 00:32:32,207
My mom got a restraining order
against my stepdad.

239
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:34,207
He has emotional problems.

240
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:37,247
I have those, too.
What kind does he have?

241
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:40,887
He stabbed my mom
four times in the chest.

242
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:44,927
Oh. Did he go to jail?

243
00:32:45,537 --> 00:32:48,287
No, he fled.
They still can't find him.

244
00:32:49,137 --> 00:32:51,407
Mom and I had to change our names.

245
00:32:51,497 --> 00:32:54,207
I thought Gretchen Ross
was pretty cool.

246
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:59,367
I was in jail once. I mean ...
I burned down this house.

247
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:02,487
It was abandoned,
but I got held back in school ...

248
00:33:02,577 --> 00:33:05,247
and I can't drive till I'm 21.

249
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:08,007
But I'm over all of that.

250
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:11,127
I'm ... painting and stuff.

251
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:15,567
Writing. I want to be a writer.
Maybe a painter. Maybe both ...

252
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:18,927
I'll write a book
and draw the pictures.

253
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:23,167
Then maybe people will understand
me. I don't know, change things.

254
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:26,247
Donnie Darko ― what the hell kind
of name is that?

255
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,967
It's like a superhero or something.

256
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:33,117
What makes you think I'm not?

257
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:42,077
I should go. For physics, Monnitoff
is having me write this essay ―

258
00:33:42,177 --> 00:33:45,087
the greatest invention
ever to benefit mankind.

259
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:50,717
It's Monnitoff.
But that's easy. Anti-septics.

260
00:33:51,577 --> 00:33:55,407
Like, the whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1895.

261
00:33:56,057 --> 00:34:00,447
Before anti-septics, there was no
sanitation, especially in medicine.

262
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:02,207
You mean soap?

263
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:11,727
Well, I'm really glad
school was flooded today.

264
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,407
Why is that?

265
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:17,287
We'd never have had
this conversation.

266
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,367
You're weird.

267
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:22,677
Sorry.

268
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:25,597
No, that was a compliment.

269
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,407
Well, look, uh ...

270
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:36,327
You want to go with me?

271
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:43,047
- Where do you want to go?
- No, I mean, like, "go" with me.

272
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,807
- You know, like "going together".
- Sure.

273
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:52,647
Ok. Where are you going?

274
00:34:55,337 --> 00:34:57,247
I'm going home.

275
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:05,167
Stupid ... "Where are you going?"

276
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:16,767
I'd like to try something new.

277
00:35:19,057 --> 00:35:21,437
Have you ever been hypnotised?

278
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:24,037
No.

279
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:37,327
When I clap twice, you will
wake up. Do you understand?

280
00:35:38,577 --> 00:35:43,407
- Yes.
- So, tell me about your week.

281
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:45,967
I met a girl.

282
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:50,607
What is her name?

283
00:35:51,057 --> 00:35:52,647
Gretchen.

284
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:56,287
We're going together now.

285
00:35:58,377 --> 00:36:00,967
Do you still think
about girls a lot?

286
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:03,247
Yeah.

287
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:12,527
- How are things going at school?
- I think about girls a lot.

288
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,317
I asked you about school, Donnie.

289
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:18,487
I think about fucking
a lot during school.

290
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:23,127
What else do you think about
during school?

291
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:25,927
"Married With Children".

292
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,767
- You think about your family?
- I just turn down the volume ...

293
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:32,287
and think about fucking
Christina Applegate.

294
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:34,937
I asked you about your family.

295
00:36:35,337 --> 00:36:36,647
No.

296
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:41,687
I don't think about fucking
my family. That's gross.

297
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:45,367
I'd like to hear
about your friend Frank.

298
00:37:02,777 --> 00:37:04,167
Sam Bylan.

299
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:15,527
Cherita Chen.

300
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:36,287
Donald Darko.

301
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,047
Daye Dennis.

302
00:38:06,897 --> 00:38:08,207
Hey, you fuck!

303
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:12,357
Did you say I flooded the school?

304
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:18,487
- I didn't say shit.
- Yeah, well, they think I did it.

305
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:22,607
If you're innocent, then you have
nothing to worry about, right?

306
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:25,437
Fuck you! You know what I think?

307
00:38:27,457 --> 00:38:29,207
I think you did it.

308
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:47,367
Beer and pussy ― that's all I need.

309
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:51,647
- We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
- Smurfette?

310
00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:55,517
Mm-hm.
Not some tight-ass Middlesex chick.

311
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:57,327
Like, this cute little blonde ...

312
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:00,487
that'll get down with the guys
like Smurfette does.

313
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:03,367
Smurfette doesn't fuck.

314
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:09,287
That's bullshit. Why do you think
Papa Smurf made her?

315
00:39:09,737 --> 00:39:12,567
Because the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

316
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:15,037
Not vanity.
I heard he was a homosexual.

317
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:18,887
Then she fucks them
while vanity watches.

318
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:22,727
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get some action?

319
00:39:22,817 --> 00:39:25,647
What he does,
he films the gang-bang.

320
00:39:25,737 --> 00:39:28,447
Later on, he beats off to the tape.

321
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:34,727
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't
create Smurfette. Gargamel did.

322
00:39:34,817 --> 00:39:39,367
She was sent as Gargamel's evil spy
to destroy the Smurf village,

323
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:43,077
but the overwhelming goodness
of the Smurfs transformed her.

324
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:49,327
And as for the whole gang-bang
scenario, it just couldn't happen!

325
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:52,607
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have ...

326
00:39:52,697 --> 00:39:56,007
reproductive organs
under those little white pants.

327
00:39:57,577 --> 00:40:01,047
That's what's so illogical
about being a Smurf.

328
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:05,687
What's the point of living
if you don't have a dick?

329
00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:12,767
Donnie, why you gotta get
smart on us?

330
00:40:14,937 --> 00:40:16,287
Grandma Death.

331
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:18,837
Excuse me! Excuse me!

332
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:24,767
Stay off the road, Miss Sparrow,
or I will call Social Services.

333
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:29,087
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch!

334
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:30,887
Yeah.

335
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:35,447
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.

336
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:39,287
She does the same thing every day.

337
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:43,287
Just walks back and forth
and back and forth to the mailbox.

338
00:40:46,617 --> 00:40:49,047
Nothing ever in there.

339
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,247
Oh, wait, wait, wait ...

340
00:40:55,097 --> 00:40:59,127
She's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.

341
00:40:59,977 --> 00:41:02,487
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.

342
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:04,807
This could be it. Oh ...?

343
00:41:05,457 --> 00:41:08,207
Oh, no dice, Grandma. Sorry.

344
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:10,407
Someone ought to write that bitch.

345
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:13,247
Authorities continued
their search ...

346
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:17,087
for a suspect in the Middlesex
Ridge School vandalism.

347
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:19,847
The private school
has asked for donations ...

348
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:23,287
to restore its beloved mascot,
known only as the Mongrel ...

349
00:41:31,257 --> 00:41:34,957
It's very helpful.
There's a good turnout tonight.

350
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:39,057
What are you trying
to accomplish here?

351
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:42,807
There was urine and faeces
flooded in my office.

352
00:41:44,537 --> 00:41:46,327
Whatever fits.

353
00:41:48,377 --> 00:41:50,007
"Whatever fits"?

354
00:41:51,097 --> 00:41:53,727
In cooperation
with the county police,

355
00:41:53,817 --> 00:41:56,007
we have begun
an active investigation ...

356
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,127
into the cause of the flooding.

357
00:41:58,217 --> 00:42:02,367
And our suspects include
several of our own students ...

358
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:06,447
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

359
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:19,967
Kitty, I would appreciate
if you would wait ...

360
00:42:20,057 --> 00:42:23,647
Dr Cole, not only am I a teacher,

361
00:42:23,737 --> 00:42:26,927
but I am also a parent
of a Middlesex child.

362
00:42:27,017 --> 00:42:29,607
Therefore I am the
only person here ...

363
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:32,887
who transcends
the parent-teacher bridge.

364
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:41,127
Don't worry, you got away with it.

365
00:42:41,217 --> 00:42:44,807
I have in my hand Graham Greene's
"The Destructors".

366
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:49,727
This short story is part of my
daughter's English assignment.

367
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,047
In this story,
several children destroy ...

368
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:56,247
an elderly man's house
from inside out.

369
00:43:09,977 --> 00:43:11,887
How can you do that?

370
00:43:18,777 --> 00:43:21,007
And how do they do this?

371
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:25,687
They flood the house
by breaking through a water main.

372
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:29,757
I can do anything I want.

373
00:43:31,657 --> 00:43:33,247
And so can you.

374
00:43:36,737 --> 00:43:40,487
And I think that this garbage
should be removed!

375
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:43,037
Excuse me.
What is the real issue here?

376
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:45,697
The PTA doesn't ban books.

377
00:43:45,777 --> 00:43:49,047
The PTA must acknowledge
that pornography ...

378
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:51,517
is being taught in our curriculum!

379
00:43:51,617 --> 00:43:56,737
- It's meant to be ironic.
- Excuse me. Go back to grad school.

380
00:43:57,497 --> 00:44:00,647
Why did you make me
flood the school?

381
00:44:04,577 --> 00:44:07,087
They are in great danger.

382
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,167
Do you even know
who Graham Greene is?

383
00:44:10,577 --> 00:44:13,767
I think we have all seen "Bonanza".

384
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:20,967
Well, um ... while we are
on other topics ...

385
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:23,687
Where do you come from?

386
00:44:25,057 --> 00:44:27,247
Do you believe in time travel?

387
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:32,487
Who are you talking to?

388
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:39,157
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

389
00:44:49,977 --> 00:44:52,437
A storm is coming, Frank says.

390
00:44:53,017 --> 00:44:56,367
A storm that will swallow
the children,

391
00:44:56,937 --> 00:45:00,557
and I will deliver them
from the kingdom of pain.

392
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:03,967
I'll deliver them
back to their doorsteps,

393
00:45:04,057 --> 00:45:07,367
send the monsters
back to the underground.

394
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:11,567
I'll send them back to a place
where no one else can see them.

395
00:45:11,657 --> 00:45:13,167
Except for me.

396
00:45:14,937 --> 00:45:17,767
Because I am Donnie Darko.

397
00:45:26,217 --> 00:45:27,687
Who is Frank?

398
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:36,647
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.

399
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:44,807
In these modern times,

400
00:45:44,897 --> 00:45:49,527
our attitude and beliefs
are so delicate, so fragile.

401
00:45:49,617 --> 00:45:54,807
I have had a "Cunning Vision",
This vision has released me.

402
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:57,807
It's important that
our lifeline be rejuvenated,

403
00:45:57,897 --> 00:46:00,527
so that we can breathe again.

404
00:46:00,617 --> 00:46:02,687
It's time to breathe.

405
00:46:03,617 --> 00:46:05,847
It is time to breathe.

406
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,607
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

407
00:46:09,337 --> 00:46:11,447
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

408
00:46:13,017 --> 00:46:16,287
So now let us begin Lifeline
Exercise Number One,

409
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:18,447
Please press stop now.

410
00:46:25,977 --> 00:46:30,917
As you can see, the lifeline is
divided into two polar extremes.

411
00:46:31,377 --> 00:46:33,367
Fear and love.

412
00:46:33,777 --> 00:46:37,287
Fear is in the negative
energy spectrum.

413
00:46:37,937 --> 00:46:42,567
- Love is in the positive energy spectrum.
- No, duh (!)

414
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:47,407
Excuse me?
"No, duh" is a product of fear.

415
00:46:49,497 --> 00:46:53,807
Now, on each card
is a character dilemma ...

416
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:56,457
which applies to the lifeline.

417
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:01,967
Please ... Take this. Thank you.

418
00:47:03,137 --> 00:47:05,847
Please read each character
dilemma aloud ...

419
00:47:05,937 --> 00:47:10,207
and place an "X" on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

420
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:12,487
Cherita?

421
00:47:21,177 --> 00:47:24,567
"Juanita has an important
math test today.

422
00:47:24,657 --> 00:47:28,687
She's known about the test for
several weeks, but has not studied.

423
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:32,047
In order to keep from failing,

424
00:47:32,137 --> 00:47:35,367
Juanita decides
to cheat on the math test."

425
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:41,247
Good. Good. Very good.

426
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:43,117
Mr. Darko.

427
00:47:52,057 --> 00:47:54,517
"Ling-Ling finds a wallet
filled with money.

428
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:56,247
"She takes it to the address
on the driver's licence ...

429
00:47:56,337 --> 00:47:58,287
but keeps the money."

430
00:48:00,657 --> 00:48:03,217
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer.
I don't get this.

431
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:07,327
Just place an "X"
in the appropriate place.

432
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:12,807
I know what to do, but you can't
lump things into two categories.

433
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:15,767
The lifeline is divided that way.

434
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,687
Well, life isn't that simple.
I mean ...

435
00:48:19,777 --> 00:48:23,317
Who cares if Ling-Ling
keeps the money?

436
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:25,287
It has nothing to do
with fear or love.

437
00:48:25,377 --> 00:48:28,207
They are the deepest
human emotions.

438
00:48:28,297 --> 00:48:31,247
Ok. But you're not listening to me.

439
00:48:31,337 --> 00:48:33,687
There are other things
to take into account,

440
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,727
the whole spectrum
of human emotion.

441
00:48:36,817 --> 00:48:38,887
You can't just lump everything ...

442
00:48:38,977 --> 00:48:41,087
into two categories
and deny everything else!

443
00:48:41,177 --> 00:48:45,127
If you don't complete the
assignment, you'll get a zero.

444
00:48:50,137 --> 00:48:54,007
Donald, let me preface
this by saying ...

445
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:59,217
that your Iowa Test scores
are ... intimidating.

446
00:49:01,977 --> 00:49:03,087
So ...

447
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:06,367
Let's go over this again.

448
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:09,287
What exactly
did you say to Miss Farmer?

449
00:49:11,457 --> 00:49:14,087
I'll tell you. He asked me ...

450
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:17,717
to forcibly insert the lifeline
exercise card into my anus!

451
00:49:34,337 --> 00:49:38,807
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values ...

452
00:49:43,097 --> 00:49:46,447
Kitty ... Excuse us, please.

453
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:55,927
They've suspended him from
"after school" activities for 6 months.

454
00:49:58,697 --> 00:50:02,317
Since this jet engine fiasco,
I don't know what's gotten into ...

455
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:06,767
I'll say this because our daughters
are on the dance team together ...

456
00:50:06,857 --> 00:50:08,687
and I respect you,

457
00:50:08,777 --> 00:50:11,337
but after witnessing
your son's behaviour,

458
00:50:11,417 --> 00:50:14,367
I have significant doubts
about your ...

459
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:20,167
Our paths through life
must be righteous.

460
00:50:20,257 --> 00:50:22,607
Go home and look in the mirror ...

461
00:50:22,697 --> 00:50:26,607
and pray that your son doesn't
succumb to the path of fear.

462
00:50:33,457 --> 00:50:37,077
Do you remember
that weird gym teacher, Mrs. Farmer?

463
00:50:38,337 --> 00:50:42,847
Yeah. Ok, well, my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today.

464
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,767
And then my parents
just bought him all this new shit.

465
00:50:47,697 --> 00:50:51,397
Yeah, I know. I wish a jet engine
would fall on my room.

466
00:51:09,857 --> 00:51:12,087
- Dr Monnitoff.
- Donnie.

467
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,807
I know this is gonna
sound kind of weird,

468
00:51:16,897 --> 00:51:19,927
but do you know anything
about ... time travel?

469
00:51:25,017 --> 00:51:28,717
A wormhole with an
Einstein-Rosen bridge,

470
00:51:28,817 --> 00:51:33,757
which is theoretically a wormhole
in space controlled by man.

471
00:51:36,337 --> 00:51:38,637
So, according to Hawking,

472
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:42,087
a wormhole may be able
to provide a short cut ...

473
00:51:42,177 --> 00:51:45,607
for jumping between two distant
regions of space-time.

474
00:51:45,697 --> 00:51:48,767
So to travel back in time,
you have to have a spaceship ...

475
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:51,007
faster than the speed of light.

476
00:51:51,097 --> 00:51:54,247
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.

477
00:51:54,337 --> 00:51:56,637
The basic principles of
time travel are there.

478
00:51:56,737 --> 00:52:00,847
Your vessel and portal.
Your vessel can be anything.

479
00:52:00,937 --> 00:52:03,967
- Like a DeLorean?
- Metal craft of any kind.

480
00:52:04,057 --> 00:52:09,727
You know, I love that movie. It's
so ... like, futuristic, you know?

481
00:52:11,497 --> 00:52:15,197
Listen, um ... don't tell anybody
that I gave you this.

482
00:52:15,817 --> 00:52:18,327
Woman who wrote this
used to teach here.

483
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:20,767
She was a nun long before that.

484
00:52:20,857 --> 00:52:26,927
Then overnight she became
this entirely different person.

485
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:30,207
She up and left the church,
wrote this book ...

486
00:52:30,737 --> 00:52:34,247
She started teaching science,
right here at Middlesex.

487
00:52:35,457 --> 00:52:38,047
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".

488
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:41,407
Roberta Sparrow?

489
00:52:41,977 --> 00:52:43,327
That's right.

490
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:48,847
Roberta Sparrow?

491
00:53:08,737 --> 00:53:10,447
Roberta Sparrow.

492
00:53:12,177 --> 00:53:14,047
Grandma Death.

493
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,927
It's called
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".

494
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:41,767
- What does philosophy have to do with it?
- Guess who wrote it.

495
00:53:41,857 --> 00:53:42,967
Who?

496
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,527
Roberta Sparrow.
Huh! She wrote a book.

497
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:52,407
- Grandma Death wrote a book.
- That's a terrible nickname.

498
00:53:53,977 --> 00:53:56,567
We almost ran her down
the other day.

499
00:53:57,657 --> 00:54:01,807
She lives in that piece of crap
house, and you know she's loaded.

500
00:54:02,497 --> 00:54:06,607
- You're right.
- She was known for her gem collection.

501
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,647
Kids used to go up there
all the time ...

502
00:54:10,737 --> 00:54:13,087
and try to steal stuff from her.

503
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:15,887
She became a total recluse.

504
00:54:16,737 --> 00:54:20,767
I didn't know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down.

505
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:28,167
She was just standing
in the road, frozen.

506
00:54:28,257 --> 00:54:31,287
I walked over to see if she was OK.

507
00:54:33,217 --> 00:54:35,887
And she whispered in my ear.

508
00:54:35,977 --> 00:54:38,647
- What did she say?
- I think Frank wants me to talk to her.

509
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:43,207
He asked if I knew
about time travel.

510
00:54:43,297 --> 00:54:44,687
She wrote a book about it,

511
00:54:44,777 --> 00:54:47,447
so that can't be
a coincidence, right?

512
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,567
What did she say to you?

513
00:54:55,097 --> 00:54:58,877
She said that every living creature
on earth dies alone.

514
00:55:02,657 --> 00:55:04,957
How did that make you feel?

515
00:55:08,937 --> 00:55:11,367
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

516
00:55:12,897 --> 00:55:18,047
She died when I was eight and she
crawled underneath the ... the porch.

517
00:55:22,137 --> 00:55:23,277
To die.

518
00:55:26,737 --> 00:55:28,687
To be alone.

519
00:55:29,897 --> 00:55:32,047
Do you feel alone right now?

520
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,127
I don't know ...

521
00:55:41,537 --> 00:55:44,447
I'd like to believe I'm not,
but I just ...

522
00:55:45,697 --> 00:55:50,607
I've just never seen any proof,
so I just don't debate it any more.

523
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:54,927
I could spend my whole life
debating it over and over ...

524
00:55:55,017 --> 00:55:57,247
and still wouldn't have proof,

525
00:55:57,337 --> 00:56:00,127
so I just don't debate it any more.

526
00:56:01,617 --> 00:56:03,127
It's absurd.

527
00:56:06,657 --> 00:56:08,807
The search for God is absurd?

528
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:13,927
It is if everyone dies alone.

529
00:56:14,857 --> 00:56:17,087
Does that scare you?

530
00:56:20,137 --> 00:56:22,327
I don't want to be alone.

531
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:38,217
And his tapes have
made me realise ...

532
00:56:38,297 --> 00:56:42,807
that for the last 39 years, I have
been a prisoner of my own fear.

533
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:44,847
Fear.

534
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:49,607
You have got to meet
this Jim Cunningham.

535
00:56:50,337 --> 00:56:52,447
I can't believe he's single.

536
00:56:53,537 --> 00:56:57,047
It has been a disappointing night
for these Super Bowl champions.

537
00:56:57,137 --> 00:57:00,837
You're right, Dan, Coach Joe Gibbs
is on the sidelines.

538
00:57:00,937 --> 00:57:05,047
He's gotta be thinking, "What
happened? What went wrong tonight?"

539
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:09,367
- And here's the kick,
- Oh!

540
00:57:09,897 --> 00:57:11,967
It's no good ...

541
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:15,687
- Shit, we need a quarterback.
- We need a miracle.

542
00:57:15,777 --> 00:57:18,047
We need to go for a safety.

543
00:57:19,657 --> 00:57:24,647
What the future holds for this MVP,
we'll have to wait and see.

544
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:34,207
You guys want anything?

545
00:57:34,297 --> 00:57:38,807
This week on "Who's The Boss?"
Samantha borrows Tony's van ...

546
00:57:39,137 --> 00:57:42,047
and gets caught without a licence.

547
00:57:42,657 --> 00:57:45,087
Better make sure
we don't miss that one.

548
00:57:47,337 --> 00:57:50,407
Here we are again,
Fourth down now ...

549
00:59:32,017 --> 00:59:35,367
Tomorrow, we meet our partners ...

550
00:59:35,457 --> 00:59:37,917
for the Young Inventors' Fair.

551
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:55,607
What if you could go back in time
and take those hours of pain ...

552
00:59:55,697 --> 00:59:58,127
and replace them
with something better?

553
00:59:58,217 --> 01:00:01,997
- Like images?
- Yeah, a Hawaiian sunset ...

554
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:03,767
or the Grand Canyon.

555
01:00:03,857 --> 01:00:06,287
Things that remind you
how beautiful ...

556
01:00:06,377 --> 01:00:09,887
We've been going together
for two weeks.

557
01:00:09,977 --> 01:00:11,117
Yeah?

558
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:15,167
Well, I er ... I ...

559
01:00:17,857 --> 01:00:20,007
You want to kiss me?

560
01:00:27,297 --> 01:00:30,487
- I'm sorry, I ...
- Look, Donnie, wait. I just ...

561
01:00:30,577 --> 01:00:33,007
- Well, I like you a lot.
- I just want it to be ...

562
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:35,727
at a time when ... it ...

563
01:00:36,697 --> 01:00:40,397
- When what?
- When it reminds me just ...

564
01:00:42,057 --> 01:00:45,447
When it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be?

565
01:00:45,817 --> 01:00:47,247
Yeah.

566
01:00:48,737 --> 01:00:51,367
And there's some fat guy
staring at us.

567
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,687
I don't think telling any woman ...

568
01:01:23,777 --> 01:01:26,647
to forcibly insert
an object up her anus ...

569
01:01:26,737 --> 01:01:29,927
is something that should
go without consequence.

570
01:01:34,137 --> 01:01:36,807
I think we should buy him a moped.

571
01:01:39,337 --> 01:01:42,247
I think we should get a divorce.

572
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:57,087
- You won't tell Mom, will you?
- Why would I?

573
01:01:57,177 --> 01:02:00,087
- You tell Mom everything.
- No, I don't.

574
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:08,087
- Let me see it.
- No, it's not finished. It's ...

575
01:02:08,177 --> 01:02:09,967
Ok. It's cool.

576
01:02:15,617 --> 01:02:17,167
That's scary.

577
01:02:20,617 --> 01:02:21,837
You think?

578
01:02:24,257 --> 01:02:27,327
Thank you for seeing us
at such late notice.

579
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:31,327
We both felt
we should come and discuss ...

580
01:02:31,977 --> 01:02:34,687
What I think is going on
with your son.

581
01:02:34,777 --> 01:02:36,247
Yes.

582
01:02:36,617 --> 01:02:40,207
Um ... Well, he's er ...

583
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:46,287
You know about his past, and he
was suspended from school ...

584
01:02:46,377 --> 01:02:47,807
for insulting his gym teacher.

585
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:52,727
I'm not sure that's a good example.
I think he had just cause.

586
01:02:52,817 --> 01:02:56,807
Rose, let me lay out
what I believe is happening here.

587
01:03:00,177 --> 01:03:02,527
Donnie's aggressive behaviour ...

588
01:03:03,497 --> 01:03:07,247
his increased detachment
from reality,

589
01:03:08,537 --> 01:03:13,287
seem to stem from his inability to
cope with the forces in the world ...

590
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:16,207
that he perceives
to be threatening.

591
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:24,057
Has he ever told you about Frank?

592
01:03:28,897 --> 01:03:30,007
Frank?

593
01:03:30,417 --> 01:03:32,567
Yes, the giant bunny rabbit.

594
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:35,757
The what?

595
01:03:40,257 --> 01:03:45,047
I don't recall
him ever having mentioned a rabbit.

596
01:03:45,137 --> 01:03:46,607
Donnie is experiencing ...

597
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:49,687
what is commonly called
a daylight hallucination.

598
01:04:04,017 --> 01:04:07,607
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

599
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:15,407
- What can we do?
- I would like to do more hypnotherapy ...

600
01:04:17,617 --> 01:04:20,127
... and increase his medication.

601
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:32,327
Whatever will help him, really,
is ... That's why we're here.

602
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:37,207
We just would like him
to experience some relief.

603
01:04:38,777 --> 01:04:42,447
So if you think that more
medication will do that,

604
01:04:43,897 --> 01:04:47,087
then I think
we should give it a try.

605
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:57,327
It's complicated.

606
01:04:58,257 --> 01:04:59,287
Yeah?

607
01:04:59,857 --> 01:05:04,287
There's like a force in your brain
that just sends you someplace.

608
01:05:04,377 --> 01:05:06,967
Do you go someplace familiar?

609
01:05:07,057 --> 01:05:12,567
No, but each time I keep waking up
farther from my house.

610
01:05:14,897 --> 01:05:16,247
Scary.

611
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:30,447
Donnie Darko.

612
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:35,687
I know.

613
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:47,767
- Good morning, you mongrels!
- Good morning.

614
01:05:47,857 --> 01:05:50,847
Is that all you can muster?
Good morning!

615
01:05:50,937 --> 01:05:55,247
- Good morning!
- Now, that's a tiny, tiny bit better.

616
01:05:55,817 --> 01:05:58,197
But I still sense some students ...

617
01:05:58,297 --> 01:06:01,207
who are actually afraid
to say "good morning".

618
01:06:01,297 --> 01:06:02,967
Good morning!

619
01:06:03,057 --> 01:06:07,607
Yeah, that's what I like to hear!
Too many young men and women today ...

620
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:11,087
are completely paralysed
by their fears.

621
01:06:12,657 --> 01:06:16,887
They surrender their bodies to the
temptation and destruction ...

622
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:19,767
of drugs, alcohol
and premarital sex.

623
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:24,687
Now, I'm going to tell you
a little story today.

624
01:06:25,057 --> 01:06:28,807
It's a heartbreakingly sad story
about a young man ...

625
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:33,127
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear,

626
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:38,367
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.

627
01:06:39,817 --> 01:06:41,647
His name was Frank.

628
01:06:52,257 --> 01:06:55,207
- We're moving through time.
- What?

629
01:06:58,217 --> 01:07:00,487
Hi. My stepsister, like,

630
01:07:00,577 --> 01:07:02,927
I sometimes worry
that she eats too much.

631
01:07:03,017 --> 01:07:05,577
- Shut up, Kim!
- I'm just trying to help.

632
01:07:05,657 --> 01:07:07,087
Oh, sweetheart, please!

633
01:07:07,177 --> 01:07:09,887
There's no reason
to be embarrassed here.

634
01:07:10,217 --> 01:07:14,727
Many times we eat because we are
afraid to face our ego reflection.

635
01:07:15,977 --> 01:07:18,487
We find ourselves
looking at the mirror,

636
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:22,197
rather than into
and through the mirror.

637
01:07:22,297 --> 01:07:26,647
When we do that, we can finally
see how beautiful we are.

638
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:31,607
- Thanks!
- Sure. Come up here. Don't be afraid.

639
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:40,527
Er, how can I find out what
I wanna be when I grow up?

640
01:07:40,617 --> 01:07:43,207
Oh! That's a hard one.

641
01:07:43,297 --> 01:07:48,047
Well, look deep inside of yourself,
deep within your heart,

642
01:07:48,137 --> 01:07:54,807
and find what makes you feel love,
pure, unconditional love ...

643
01:07:54,897 --> 01:07:57,197
and go to that. In your studies,
in your athletics,

644
01:07:57,297 --> 01:07:59,927
in your relationships,
go towards love.

645
01:08:00,257 --> 01:08:02,447
- Thank you.
- Come on up.

646
01:08:05,817 --> 01:08:06,877
Next.

647
01:08:11,857 --> 01:08:16,247
- How do I learn how to fight?
- "How do I learn how to fight?"

648
01:08:16,777 --> 01:08:22,487
Son, violence is a product of fear.
Learn to truly love yourself ―

649
01:08:23,457 --> 01:08:26,967
TRULY love yourself ―
and the world will be yours.

650
01:08:27,657 --> 01:08:29,887
- Ok.
- Get yourself up here!

651
01:08:29,977 --> 01:08:31,247
All right!

652
01:08:36,097 --> 01:08:38,557
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

653
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:41,687
Um ... How much are they
paying you to be here?

654
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:45,087
Er ... Excuse me?

655
01:08:47,257 --> 01:08:50,047
- What's your name, son?
- Gerald.

656
01:08:50,817 --> 01:08:53,447
Well, Gerald,
I think you're afraid.

657
01:08:53,537 --> 01:08:55,767
Do you want us to buy your book?

658
01:08:55,857 --> 01:08:59,007
Because that was
the worst advice ever.

659
01:08:59,497 --> 01:09:02,807
See how sad this is?
Want your sister to lose weight?

660
01:09:02,897 --> 01:09:06,487
Tell her to stop eating Twinkies
and play field hockey.

661
01:09:06,937 --> 01:09:09,727
No one knows what they want to be.

662
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:13,247
It takes time to find that out.
Right, Jim?

663
01:09:14,177 --> 01:09:15,487
And you ...

664
01:09:16,337 --> 01:09:18,047
Yeah, you.

665
01:09:18,697 --> 01:09:21,567
Sick of some jerk shoving
your head down the toilet?

666
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,687
Well, lift some weights ...

667
01:09:23,777 --> 01:09:27,727
or take a karate lesson, and next
time kick him in the balls.

668
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:34,937
Son ... See this? This is an anger
prisoner, a textbook example.

669
01:09:35,017 --> 01:09:38,167
- Prisoner.
- Do you see the fear, people?

670
01:09:38,577 --> 01:09:40,957
This boy is scared to death.

671
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:44,647
Son, it breaks my heart
to say this,

672
01:09:44,737 --> 01:09:48,647
but I believe you're a very
troubled and confused young man.

673
01:09:48,737 --> 01:09:51,567
You are searching
in all the wrong places.

674
01:09:51,657 --> 01:09:54,117
You're right, actually.

675
01:09:54,217 --> 01:09:56,847
I am pretty troubled
and pretty confused.

676
01:09:56,937 --> 01:10:00,687
And I'm afraid, really, really
afraid. Really afraid, but I ... I ...

677
01:10:01,137 --> 01:10:03,847
I think you're
the fucking Antichrist.

678
01:10:16,737 --> 01:10:19,647
It's amazing.
He thinks he's telling the truth.

679
01:10:19,737 --> 01:10:22,487
Everything he says
is a fucking lie.

680
01:10:22,577 --> 01:10:24,487
Everything he says!

681
01:10:25,057 --> 01:10:29,047
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a fucking chud ...

682
01:10:29,137 --> 01:10:31,167
Are you ok?

683
01:10:35,057 --> 01:10:37,287
Sit down. Calm down.

684
01:10:43,497 --> 01:10:45,767
You ever hear of Grandma Death?

685
01:10:46,697 --> 01:10:47,757
Who?

686
01:10:53,257 --> 01:10:56,767
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".
What is this?

687
01:10:58,137 --> 01:10:59,807
She wrote it.

688
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:12,087
I'm ... I'm seeing stuff ...

689
01:11:13,497 --> 01:11:15,797
Like really messed-up stuff.

690
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:19,407
That book describes
stuff I've been seeing,

691
01:11:19,497 --> 01:11:22,087
and it can't just be a coincidence.

692
01:11:33,737 --> 01:11:36,567
She must be in.
She never leaves this house.

693
01:11:36,657 --> 01:11:38,447
Maybe she's asleep.

694
01:11:58,937 --> 01:12:00,447
Donnie, look.

695
01:12:10,977 --> 01:12:12,847
Send her a letter.

696
01:12:41,017 --> 01:12:44,367
Each vessel travel along a
vector through space-time ...

697
01:12:44,457 --> 01:12:46,727
along its centre of gravity.

698
01:12:47,137 --> 01:12:48,447
Like a spear.

699
01:12:50,457 --> 01:12:54,567
- Pardon?
- Like a spear coming out of your chest.

700
01:12:55,057 --> 01:12:57,357
Um ... Sure. Yeah.

701
01:12:57,777 --> 01:13:00,447
In order for the vessel
to travel through time,

702
01:13:00,537 --> 01:13:03,487
it's got to find a portal,
a wormhole or ...

703
01:13:03,577 --> 01:13:05,447
Could these portals ...?

704
01:13:05,897 --> 01:13:09,517
Could these portals
just appear anywhere, any time?

705
01:13:09,617 --> 01:13:11,807
I think that's highly unlikely.

706
01:13:11,897 --> 01:13:15,847
No, you're talking about
an act of God.

707
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:18,527
If God controls time,
time is pre-decided.

708
01:13:19,977 --> 01:13:21,567
I'm not following you.

709
01:13:21,657 --> 01:13:24,767
Every living thing
follows a set path.

710
01:13:24,857 --> 01:13:29,327
And if you could see your path,
then you could see the future?

711
01:13:30,337 --> 01:13:32,797
That's a form of time travel.

712
01:13:32,897 --> 01:13:35,607
Well, you're contradicting
yourself.

713
01:13:35,697 --> 01:13:38,047
If we were able
to see our destinies ...

714
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:40,437
manifest themselves visually,

715
01:13:40,537 --> 01:13:44,207
then we would be given a choice
to betray our destinies.

716
01:13:44,297 --> 01:13:46,727
The mere fact
that this choice exists ...

717
01:13:46,817 --> 01:13:50,127
would make all preformed destiny
come to an end.

718
01:13:50,537 --> 01:13:53,727
Not if you travel
within God's channel.

719
01:13:57,617 --> 01:14:01,767
I'm not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

720
01:14:04,177 --> 01:14:06,557
- Why?
- I could lose my job.

721
01:14:08,937 --> 01:14:10,157
Ok.

722
01:14:18,697 --> 01:14:20,687
It gives me no pleasure
to deny you ...

723
01:14:20,777 --> 01:14:24,317
one of the great writers
of the 20th century.

724
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:29,087
Alas, I have not yet been elected
queen of the universe,

725
01:14:29,177 --> 01:14:33,047
so I must obey the rules.

726
01:14:33,537 --> 01:14:37,317
So, anyone seen in this school
reading this book ...

727
01:14:37,857 --> 01:14:39,567
will be suspended.

728
01:14:39,657 --> 01:14:40,927
Not to worry.

729
01:14:41,017 --> 01:14:45,607
Someone pre-ordered a dozen copies
at the Sarasota Mall bookstore.

730
01:14:48,097 --> 01:14:49,887
In Mr. Greene's absence,

731
01:14:49,977 --> 01:14:53,927
we will now be reading another
classic ― "Watership Down".

732
01:14:58,817 --> 01:15:00,327
Here, Donnie.

733
01:15:00,657 --> 01:15:02,207
Pass these back.

734
01:15:04,017 --> 01:15:07,527
Maybe you and Frank
can read this one together.

735
01:16:20,537 --> 01:16:23,127
Now you know where he lives.

736
01:16:24,697 --> 01:16:28,767
And they grow
out of our ... chest, solar plexus?

737
01:16:29,057 --> 01:16:33,167
Just like she described, the way
they moved and they smelled.

738
01:16:33,457 --> 01:16:35,367
It's like they're workers.

739
01:16:36,537 --> 01:16:40,807
Assigned to each one of us.
They just ... They're like liquid.

740
01:16:42,737 --> 01:16:46,927
I followed it
into my parents' bedroom.

741
01:16:47,777 --> 01:16:49,687
What did you find?

742
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:56,967
Nothing.

743
01:16:59,297 --> 01:17:05,397
- So we call them IMGs.
- Infant Memory Generators.

744
01:17:05,737 --> 01:17:08,887
You buy these glasses
for your infant,

745
01:17:08,977 --> 01:17:12,127
and they wear them
at night when they sleep.

746
01:17:12,217 --> 01:17:15,527
But inside the glasses
are these slide photographs.

747
01:17:15,617 --> 01:17:19,487
Each photograph is of something
peaceful or beautiful,

748
01:17:19,577 --> 01:17:21,607
whatever the parents want.

749
01:17:21,697 --> 01:17:24,447
What effect would it have
on an infant?

750
01:17:25,217 --> 01:17:28,207
Well, nobody remembers
their infancy.

751
01:17:28,297 --> 01:17:30,367
Anybody who says they do is lying.

752
01:17:30,457 --> 01:17:33,527
So, this will help develop
memory earlier in life.

753
01:17:33,617 --> 01:17:34,597
Yeah.

754
01:17:34,697 --> 01:17:37,687
Did you consider
that infants need darkness ...

755
01:17:37,777 --> 01:17:40,367
as part of their natural
development?

756
01:17:44,977 --> 01:17:46,037
No.

757
01:17:48,977 --> 01:17:49,957
Yeah.

758
01:17:50,777 --> 01:17:55,207
What if the parents put in pictures
of Satan or dead people?

759
01:17:55,897 --> 01:17:58,247
Is that what you'd show your kids?

760
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:04,367
Er, well, I mean, didn't your dad,
like, stab your mom?

761
01:18:14,217 --> 01:18:15,407
Get out.

762
01:18:17,577 --> 01:18:18,767
Gretchen!

763
01:18:19,177 --> 01:18:22,957
Gretchen! Gretchen.
I'm sorry about those guys.

764
01:18:50,977 --> 01:18:54,087
- Two for "Evil Dead", please.
- That'll be $2.

765
01:19:41,737 --> 01:19:44,527
Why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit?

766
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:53,487
Why are you wearing
that stupid man suit?

767
01:20:03,017 --> 01:20:04,927
Take it off.

768
01:20:25,177 --> 01:20:27,407
What happened to your eye?

769
01:20:43,377 --> 01:20:45,607
Why do they call you Frank?

770
01:20:46,577 --> 01:20:49,037
It is the name of my father.

771
01:20:51,617 --> 01:20:53,887
And his father before me.

772
01:20:57,977 --> 01:20:59,367
Frank ...

773
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:05,847
where's this going to stop?

774
01:21:06,257 --> 01:21:08,927
You should already know that.

775
01:21:11,537 --> 01:21:13,837
Watch the movie screen.

776
01:21:16,057 --> 01:21:18,847
There's something
I want to show you.

777
01:21:26,857 --> 01:21:29,207
Have you ever seen a portal?

778
01:21:50,177 --> 01:21:52,167
Burn it to the ground.

779
01:23:06,497 --> 01:23:09,967
Ok. Now, girls,
I want you to concentrate.

780
01:23:10,337 --> 01:23:12,847
Failure is not an option.

781
01:23:12,937 --> 01:23:18,127
And, Bethany, if you feel the need
to vomit up there, just swallow it.

782
01:23:18,657 --> 01:23:22,247
- Ok, Mom.
- Hey, you guys, good luck out there.

783
01:24:02,147 --> 01:24:04,457
Now, that was really something.

784
01:24:04,547 --> 01:24:07,747
Thank you, Cherita Chen,
with "Autumn Angel".

785
01:24:07,827 --> 01:24:10,827
Now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

786
01:24:10,907 --> 01:24:15,667
It is my pleasure to introduce
to you Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey,

787
01:24:15,747 --> 01:24:19,787
Samantha Darko, Beth Farmer
and Joanie James.

788
01:24:20,107 --> 01:24:22,257
They are Sparkle Motion.

789
01:27:15,387 --> 01:27:17,537
How long was I asleep for?

790
01:27:18,427 --> 01:27:20,107
Whole movie.

791
01:28:02,747 --> 01:28:05,547
Well, look what the cat dragged in!

792
01:28:08,587 --> 01:28:10,787
How you doing, Donnie?

793
01:28:17,027 --> 01:28:19,747
Your little sister
was broken-hearted ...

794
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:22,747
that you missed
her big show last night.

795
01:28:24,387 --> 01:28:25,907
- Dad?
- Hm?

796
01:28:27,027 --> 01:28:28,547
I'm crazy.

797
01:28:29,747 --> 01:28:32,027
You're not crazy.

798
01:28:33,467 --> 01:28:35,507
I used to be crazy.

799
01:28:38,707 --> 01:28:40,587
But you're not crazy.

800
01:28:44,347 --> 01:28:45,947
- Look, you're my only son ...
- I know ...

801
01:28:46,027 --> 01:28:52,107
No, hold it. I know I'm not
the best communicator, but ...

802
01:28:55,067 --> 01:29:00,347
whatever happens to you,
be honest, tell the truth,

803
01:29:01,747 --> 01:29:05,377
even if they do look at you
funny ― they will.

804
01:29:05,467 --> 01:29:08,347
But what you gotta understand, son,

805
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:11,817
is that almost all of those
people are full of shit.

806
01:29:18,187 --> 01:29:22,267
They're all part of this great
big conspiracy of bullshit.

807
01:29:24,787 --> 01:29:27,507
And they're scared
of people like you.

808
01:29:28,907 --> 01:29:30,787
Because those bullshitters know ...

809
01:29:30,867 --> 01:29:33,747
that you're smarter
than all of them.

810
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:38,587
You know what you say
to people like that? Hm?

811
01:29:41,747 --> 01:29:43,507
"Fuck you."

812
01:29:47,947 --> 01:29:51,737
The blaze was extinguished
sometime after 8:00 last night.

813
01:29:51,827 --> 01:29:54,507
Firefighters discovered
what has been referred to ...

814
01:29:54,587 --> 01:29:56,817
as a kiddie porn dungeon,

815
01:29:57,307 --> 01:30:03,177
Cunningham, who has become a recent
celebrity, was arrested ...

816
01:30:03,267 --> 01:30:06,817
- Oh, my God! ...
while at Sarasota Heights Country Club.

817
01:30:07,187 --> 01:30:10,977
Arson has not been ruled out
as the cause of the fire,

818
01:30:11,427 --> 01:30:15,027
Now a group of
Cunning Vision employees ...

819
01:30:15,107 --> 01:30:16,667
Dad played golf with that guy.

820
01:30:16,747 --> 01:30:18,947
... vehemently denied
the alleged link ...

821
01:30:19,027 --> 01:30:22,067
to a child pornography
publishing circuit.

822
01:30:22,147 --> 01:30:26,147
In a vicious statement, Connie
attacked fire department officials,

823
01:30:26,227 --> 01:30:28,427
claiming a mass conspiracy.

824
01:30:32,987 --> 01:30:36,347
I'm sorry, Karen.
This is a progressive school,

825
01:30:37,067 --> 01:30:40,617
but we don't feel
your methods are appropriate.

826
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:44,707
What exactly about my methods
are inappropriate?

827
01:30:51,427 --> 01:30:54,787
I am sorry that you have failed.

828
01:30:58,947 --> 01:31:02,467
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have another appointment.

829
01:31:03,707 --> 01:31:06,387
You can finish out the week.

830
01:31:12,107 --> 01:31:14,667
Fuck!

831
01:31:37,707 --> 01:31:40,547
Good afternoon. It's a great
pleasure to announce ...

832
01:31:40,627 --> 01:31:43,507
that the Middlesex Ridge School
dance team ...

833
01:31:43,587 --> 01:31:48,427
has been invited to perform on
"Star Search '88" in Los Angeles.

834
01:32:16,427 --> 01:32:21,057
- I know now a terrible thing is coming.
- What do you mean?

835
01:32:21,147 --> 01:32:27,707
The field, the field,
it's covered with blood,

836
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:31,427
Blood? Don't be silly.

837
01:32:44,307 --> 01:32:49,067
All right, it's getting dark,
We should get back to the burrow.

838
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:53,907
Back to the burrow? It'll come
there, it's all around us!

839
01:32:53,987 --> 01:32:57,347
- Stop it, Fiver,
- We've got to leave here.

840
01:33:05,507 --> 01:33:08,867
When the other rabbits
hear of Fiver's vision,

841
01:33:08,947 --> 01:33:10,307
do they believe him?

842
01:33:10,387 --> 01:33:12,347
Why should we care?

843
01:33:13,707 --> 01:33:16,227
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

844
01:33:17,067 --> 01:33:19,137
Why should I mourn for a rabbit?

845
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:23,307
Is the death of one species
less tragic than another?

846
01:33:23,547 --> 01:33:26,547
Of course. A rabbit's not like us.

847
01:33:26,787 --> 01:33:29,257
It has no history books,
no photographs,

848
01:33:29,347 --> 01:33:31,657
no knowledge of sorrow or regret.

849
01:33:31,747 --> 01:33:36,107
I'm sorry. Don't get me wrong,
I like rabbits.

850
01:33:36,187 --> 01:33:37,907
They're cute and horny.

851
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:40,377
If you're cute and horny,
you're happy.

852
01:33:40,467 --> 01:33:42,697
You don't know why you're alive.

853
01:33:42,787 --> 01:33:46,827
You just want to have sex as many
times as possible before you die.

854
01:33:47,707 --> 01:33:51,307
I just don't see the point
in crying over a dead rabbit ...

855
01:33:52,107 --> 01:33:55,897
who never even feared death
to begin with.

856
01:33:56,867 --> 01:33:58,017
You're wrong.

857
01:33:58,107 --> 01:34:02,067
These rabbits are the product
of the author's imagination.

858
01:34:02,147 --> 01:34:04,747
He cares for them,
so we care for them,

859
01:34:04,827 --> 01:34:07,507
otherwise we've just
missed the point.

860
01:34:10,547 --> 01:34:14,067
Aren't we forgetting
about the miracle of storytelling?

861
01:34:15,627 --> 01:34:19,177
The deus ex machina?
The god machine?

862
01:34:21,147 --> 01:34:23,427
That's what saved the rabbits.

863
01:34:30,347 --> 01:34:33,187
No, it was ridiculous.
I'll call you back.

864
01:34:35,387 --> 01:34:37,377
- Rose.
- Kitty.

865
01:34:39,307 --> 01:34:43,777
I'm sure you've heard the horrible
allegations against Jim Cunningham.

866
01:34:43,867 --> 01:34:47,097
I know. Something about
a kiddie porn dungeon ...

867
01:34:47,187 --> 01:34:49,947
Oh, please, please!
Don't use those words!

868
01:34:51,307 --> 01:34:55,387
It's obviously a conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man.

869
01:34:55,907 --> 01:35:00,227
I'm spearheading the Jim Cunningham
defence campaign.

870
01:35:02,427 --> 01:35:06,787
Rose, I have to appear at his
arraignment tomorrow morning.

871
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:11,147
The girls have to leave
for Los Angeles.

872
01:35:11,227 --> 01:35:15,587
As their coach, I was the obvious
choice to chaperone them.

873
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:18,897
- But now you can't go.
- Yes.

874
01:35:20,227 --> 01:35:23,067
Now, believe me,
of all the other mothers,

875
01:35:23,147 --> 01:35:25,427
I would never dream of asking you.

876
01:35:25,507 --> 01:35:28,387
But none of the others
are available.

877
01:35:30,787 --> 01:35:35,107
I don't know, Kitty. It's a bad
weekend. Eddie's in New York.

878
01:35:36,307 --> 01:35:39,267
Rose, I don't know
if you realise ...

879
01:35:39,347 --> 01:35:43,267
what an opportunity
this is for our daughters!

880
01:35:43,987 --> 01:35:49,427
This has been a dream of Samantha's
and all of ours for a long time.

881
01:35:49,507 --> 01:35:52,107
I made her lead dancer!

882
01:35:53,307 --> 01:35:57,267
Sometimes I doubt your commitment
to Sparkle Motion!

883
01:36:27,947 --> 01:36:30,547
Elizabeth will be in charge.

884
01:36:30,987 --> 01:36:33,457
She'll drive you to therapy.

885
01:36:34,107 --> 01:36:35,747
And if you need anything,

886
01:36:35,827 --> 01:36:38,867
you promise me
that you will call Dr. Thurman?

887
01:36:49,067 --> 01:36:52,667
How does it feel
to have a wacko for a son?

888
01:36:57,827 --> 01:36:59,657
It feels wonderful.

889
01:37:32,147 --> 01:37:34,377
Here ... Sorry! Here you are!

890
01:37:36,987 --> 01:37:40,137
- You guys are gonna win. I know it.
- So do I.

891
01:37:40,667 --> 01:37:45,347
Here's the keys. There's food
in the fridge and do not ...

892
01:37:45,427 --> 01:37:48,267
Mom, go.
You're gonna miss your plane.

893
01:37:48,347 --> 01:37:50,947
Mom, I need ...

894
01:37:52,507 --> 01:37:55,267
There's nothing broken in my brain.

895
01:37:55,947 --> 01:37:58,507
- I know.
- Bye, Donnie.

896
01:38:03,587 --> 01:38:06,507
Ok, go. Go!

897
01:38:29,387 --> 01:38:30,947
Hello, Donnie.

898
01:38:31,707 --> 01:38:32,777
It's Friday.

899
01:38:32,867 --> 01:38:36,627
Shouldn't you be off with
your friends, scaring old people?

900
01:38:41,587 --> 01:38:45,587
- What's going on?
- I don't know. That's a good question.

901
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:52,377
I'm no longer your English teacher.
They fired me.

902
01:38:52,947 --> 01:38:56,737
That's bullshit!
You're the only good teacher here.

903
01:38:59,947 --> 01:39:01,147
Thank you.

904
01:39:03,667 --> 01:39:05,427
What's "cellar door"?

905
01:39:07,187 --> 01:39:09,497
This famous linguist once said ...

906
01:39:09,587 --> 01:39:13,217
that of all the phrases
in the English language,

907
01:39:13,307 --> 01:39:17,427
of all the endless combinations
of words in all of history,

908
01:39:17,507 --> 01:39:20,547
"cellar door"
is the most beautiful.

909
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:22,507
"Cellar door."

910
01:39:56,707 --> 01:40:00,667
I promise that one day everything's
gonna be better for you.

911
01:40:02,987 --> 01:40:04,267
Shut up!

912
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:22,067
- I want to talk about your past.
- No ―

913
01:40:22,947 --> 01:40:25,947
I want to talk
about you and your parents.

914
01:40:27,467 --> 01:40:31,067
They didn't buy me
what I wanted for Christmas.

915
01:40:31,787 --> 01:40:34,587
What did you want for Christmas
that year?

916
01:40:35,547 --> 01:40:37,987
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

917
01:40:39,947 --> 01:40:44,067
How did you feel, being denied
these Hungry Hungry Hippos?

918
01:40:45,267 --> 01:40:48,787
- Regret.
- What else makes you feel regret?

919
01:40:52,027 --> 01:40:55,987
- That I did it again.
- You did it again?

920
01:40:57,867 --> 01:41:01,867
I flooded my school and I burned
down that pervert's house.

921
01:41:04,867 --> 01:41:08,337
I only have a few days left
before they catch me.

922
01:41:08,427 --> 01:41:10,387
Did Frank tell you
to do these things?

923
01:41:10,467 --> 01:41:14,307
I have to obey him.
He saved my life.

924
01:41:15,187 --> 01:41:18,227
I have to obey him
or I'll be left all alone.

925
01:41:18,307 --> 01:41:20,137
And then ...

926
01:41:21,227 --> 01:41:25,107
And then I won't be able to figure
out what this is all about.

927
01:41:25,587 --> 01:41:28,267
I won't know his master plan.

928
01:41:29,467 --> 01:41:33,467
Do you mean God's master plan?

929
01:41:33,547 --> 01:41:35,617
Do you now believe in God?

930
01:41:35,707 --> 01:41:38,707
I have the power
to build a time machine.

931
01:41:39,707 --> 01:41:41,617
How is that possible?

932
01:41:44,347 --> 01:41:47,307
How is time travel possible,
Donnie?

933
01:41:47,907 --> 01:41:50,137
Time's up, Frank said.

934
01:41:50,507 --> 01:41:53,787
- When is this going to happen?
- Soon.

935
01:42:15,027 --> 01:42:17,227
What is going to happen?

936
01:42:21,227 --> 01:42:24,457
- Frank is gonna kill.
- Who is he going to kill?

937
01:42:29,347 --> 01:42:32,467
- Who is he going to kill?
- I can see him!

938
01:42:37,667 --> 01:42:39,947
The sky's gonna open up.

939
01:42:46,467 --> 01:42:52,337
If the sky suddenly opened up,
there would be no law, no rule.

940
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:56,627
There would only be you
and your memories,

941
01:42:57,107 --> 01:43:01,027
the choices you've made
and the people you've touched.

942
01:43:02,227 --> 01:43:07,227
If this world were to end,
there would only be you and him ...

943
01:43:09,147 --> 01:43:11,057
and no one else.

944
01:43:41,107 --> 01:43:43,747
You can stop
taking your medication.

945
01:43:43,827 --> 01:43:48,187
They're placebos.
Just pills made out of water.

946
01:43:50,027 --> 01:43:51,347
Thank you.

947
01:43:52,347 --> 01:43:53,827
Donnie ...

948
01:43:55,947 --> 01:44:00,867
An atheist is someone who denies
altogether the existence of God.

949
01:44:01,227 --> 01:44:03,027
You're an agnostic.

950
01:44:03,827 --> 01:44:06,347
An agnostic is someone ...

951
01:44:07,347 --> 01:44:10,977
who believes that there is
no proof of the existence of God,

952
01:44:11,067 --> 01:44:16,067
but does not deny
a possibility that God exists.

953
01:44:23,787 --> 01:44:26,017
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.

954
01:44:49,107 --> 01:44:50,177
Hey.

955
01:44:51,747 --> 01:44:53,027
I got in.

956
01:44:57,667 --> 01:44:59,347
I'm going to Harvard.

957
01:45:01,507 --> 01:45:05,057
Hey, we should totally throw
a party. Mom and Dad are gone.

958
01:45:05,147 --> 01:45:08,427
It's Halloween.
We could get away with it.

959
01:45:08,507 --> 01:45:12,027
Ok. But it has to be small.

960
01:45:44,747 --> 01:45:48,267
We got eggs, water balloons
and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.

961
01:45:48,347 --> 01:45:50,547
I stole four beers from my dad.

962
01:45:50,627 --> 01:45:54,017
- We got a keg.
- Keg beer is for pussies.

963
01:46:17,307 --> 01:46:19,947
Rose, this is Lilian Thurman.

964
01:46:20,587 --> 01:46:24,217
It is important that you call me
as soon as you get this message.

965
01:46:24,307 --> 01:46:25,507
Thank you.

966
01:46:50,627 --> 01:46:51,667
You ok?

967
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:55,867
Yeah. My mom's gone.

968
01:46:58,067 --> 01:46:59,587
You want to come in?

969
01:47:23,547 --> 01:47:25,457
I don't know.

970
01:47:25,547 --> 01:47:29,707
She didn't leave a note
and the house was all messed up.

971
01:47:31,147 --> 01:47:33,057
But you're ok.

972
01:47:36,187 --> 01:47:37,907
Did you call the cops?

973
01:47:38,947 --> 01:47:40,707
Yeah, they said
I should leave the house ...

974
01:47:40,787 --> 01:47:44,577
and that I should go
to a safe place.

975
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:51,017
I'm just so scared. I keep thinking
something awful is happening and ...

976
01:47:53,227 --> 01:47:55,787
It's my fucking stepdad, I know it.

977
01:48:05,747 --> 01:48:09,747
I guess some people are just born
with tragedy in their blood.

978
01:48:14,667 --> 01:48:18,507
- Hey, have you seen Frank?
- No, they went on a beer run.

979
01:48:22,507 --> 01:48:26,267
If you're there, please pick up.
Oh, well, Good news,

980
01:48:26,347 --> 01:48:28,817
The girls got
three and a half stars ...

981
01:48:28,907 --> 01:48:31,427
and are in the quarter-finals.

982
01:48:31,507 --> 01:48:34,547
Samantha was amazing, Anyway ...

983
01:48:34,627 --> 01:48:37,187
We're taking the red-eye back
tonight and ...

984
01:48:37,267 --> 01:48:40,147
- Mom, we've got to leave.
- Yeah. Ok.

985
01:48:40,227 --> 01:48:43,187
We should arrive
8:30 in the morning.

986
01:48:44,067 --> 01:48:48,067
Um ... I hope everything's ...
I hope everything's all right.

987
01:48:48,587 --> 01:48:50,227
I love you. Bye.

988
01:50:53,147 --> 01:50:55,537
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

989
01:50:55,867 --> 01:50:58,627
- Donnie?
- Look, we gotta go.

990
01:50:59,787 --> 01:51:03,147
- We've got to see Grandma Death.
- Why? About the book?

991
01:51:03,227 --> 01:51:04,907
- No, it's Frank.
- Donnie ...

992
01:51:04,987 --> 01:51:07,187
Time is running out! We gotta go.

993
01:51:53,467 --> 01:51:56,617
Donnie, nobody's here.
Let's just forget about it.

994
01:51:58,507 --> 01:52:00,417
"Cellar door."

995
01:52:00,507 --> 01:52:01,787
What?

996
01:53:04,347 --> 01:53:05,987
Donnie! Donnie!

997
01:53:09,947 --> 01:53:11,147
Donnie!

998
01:53:12,187 --> 01:53:15,547
- Why the fuck are you here?
- Oh, my God!

999
01:53:19,707 --> 01:53:21,537
- You're dead!
- What do we do?

1000
01:53:21,627 --> 01:53:23,697
- Shit!
- Leave them alone!

1001
01:53:27,787 --> 01:53:30,387
Don't fucking move!
Don't fucking move!

1002
01:53:39,147 --> 01:53:40,667
There's a car!

1003
01:53:42,347 --> 01:53:44,867
- Get the hell out of here!
- Come on!

1004
01:53:45,867 --> 01:53:48,177
Seth, a car's coming. Let's go!

1005
01:53:48,267 --> 01:53:50,707
I have a bigger knife now.

1006
01:53:51,947 --> 01:53:52,987
Fuck!

1007
01:54:00,347 --> 01:54:02,657
Did you call the fucking cops?

1008
01:54:02,747 --> 01:54:05,427
- Deus ex machina.
- What did you just say?

1009
01:54:07,507 --> 01:54:10,787
- What the fuck did you say?
- Our saviour.

1010
01:54:15,347 --> 01:54:16,177
Donnie!

1011
01:54:47,267 --> 01:54:48,587
Frank ...

1012
01:55:14,307 --> 01:55:15,747
Is she dead?

1013
01:55:24,827 --> 01:55:28,377
What were you guys doing
in the middle of the road?!

1014
01:55:36,107 --> 01:55:37,227
Go home!

1015
01:55:38,507 --> 01:55:41,307
Go and tell your parents
everything will be ok.

1016
01:55:42,867 --> 01:55:44,187
Go!

1017
01:56:11,907 --> 01:56:17,427
The storm is coming.
You must hurry.

1018
01:58:51,067 --> 01:58:53,297
I'm going home.

1019
02:00:59,747 --> 02:01:03,787
Dear Roberta Sparrow, I've reached
the end of your book ...

1020
02:01:04,267 --> 02:01:07,347
and there's so many things
I need to ask you.

1021
02:01:08,187 --> 02:01:11,387
Sometimes I'm afraid
of what you might tell me.

1022
02:01:15,307 --> 02:01:17,347
Sometimes I'm afraid
that you'll tell me ...

1023
02:01:17,427 --> 02:01:19,817
this is not a work of fiction.

1024
02:01:20,587 --> 02:01:25,027
I can only hope that the answer
will come to me in my sleep.

1025
02:01:26,267 --> 02:01:28,947
I hope that when
the world ends ...

1026
02:01:29,027 --> 02:01:32,107
I can breathe a sigh of relief ...

1027
02:01:32,187 --> 02:01:35,867
because there will be
so much to look forward to.

1028
02:06:21,947 --> 02:06:24,467
Hey. What's going on?

1029
02:06:26,347 --> 02:06:30,707
Horrible accident.
My neighbour ... got killed.

1030
02:06:32,347 --> 02:06:35,867
- What happened?
- Got smushed by a jet engine.

1031
02:06:42,427 --> 02:06:44,107
What was his name?

1032
02:06:44,627 --> 02:06:46,857
Donnie. Donnie Darko.

1033
02:06:49,787 --> 02:06:52,147
I feel bad for his family.

1034
02:06:52,867 --> 02:06:54,307
Yeah.

1035
02:07:01,707 --> 02:07:03,667
Did you know him?

1036
02:07:06,867 --> 02:07:08,697
No.
