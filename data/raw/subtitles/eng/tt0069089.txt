00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,680
Hello, moviegoers.
This is Mr. Jag...

2
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,350
speaking to you
for Dreamland Studios.

3
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,260
This beautiful mobile home
you see before you...

4
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,750
is the current hideout of
the notorious beauty Divine...

5
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,730
the filthiest person alive.

6
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,590
Because of this cover story...

7
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,160
in one of your sleazier
national tabloids...

8
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,790
she has been forced
to go underground...

9
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,240
disguising her appearance...

10
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,170
and adopting the alias
of Babs Johnson.

11
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,400
With her live her trusted
traveling companion Cotton...

12
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,310
her delinquent son Crackers...

13
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,440
and her mentally ill mother
Miss Edie.

14
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,680
Let's take a peek inside.

15
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,580
lt's 10:30.

16
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,950
Babs, Babs.
Why isn't the eggman here?

17
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,550
l'm starving to death
for some eggs.

18
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,080
Please, Babs,
come in and give me some eggs.

19
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,720
l'm coming, Mama. l'm coming.

20
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,530
You can hold on.

21
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,330
Cotton, Cotton.

22
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,460
Babs won't give me my eggs.

23
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,500
Cotton, please come in here
and give me my eggs.

24
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,340
Be in in a minute, Edie.
Don't you worry.

25
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,680
l'll fry you up some, honey.

26
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,940
Eggs!

27
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,280
Good morning, Mama.

28
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,260
l bet you're hungry.

29
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,920
Oh, Babs, l'm starving to death.

30
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,190
Hasn't that eggman come yet?

31
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,720
l love that eggman so much.

32
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,290
No, he hasn't come yet, Mama,
but we still have some eggs.

33
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,900
l'll put some on for you.

34
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,460
Did you sleep well?

35
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,570
Oh, Babs, l slept so well.

36
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,640
Where did you get this train?

37
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,580
Did you sleep
in the caboose last night?

38
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,810
How did you know l love trains?

39
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,980
lt's not a train, Mama.

40
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,820
lt's our new mobile home,
and l sleep in the other room.

41
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,520
We all have our own rooms
this time...

42
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,720
me, you, and Cotton.

43
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,820
And Crackers has that nice
little shed right out back...

44
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,060
so he can have his friends in
whenever he likes...

45
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,760
without waking us up.

46
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,290
lsn't it wonderful?

47
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,670
Now, you just sit tight...

48
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,700
and l'll fry you up

49
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,080
Over light today, Mama?

50
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,240
Oh, no, Babs, no.

51
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,310
lt's sunny out today.

52
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,510
l want them sunny-side up.

53
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,350
You know how l like them, Babs.

54
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,520
l know how
you like them, Mama.

55
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,150
l'll be right back.

56
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,020
Across town, located in
the teeming metropolis...

57
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,030
known as downtown Baltimore...

58
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,660
live Connie and Raymond Marble,
two jealous perverts...

59
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,030
that hate Divine's
fame and notoriety...

60
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,540
more than anything
in the whole world.

61
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,770
For Connie and Raymond Marble,
it was the beginning of the end.

62
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,270
Well, Miss Sandstone...

63
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,250
after looking over
your qualifications...

64
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,410
my husband and l have decided
that you're not exactly...

65
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,290
what we had in mind
for the job.

66
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,590
Not only have you
never heard of Divine...

67
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,290
which is one
of the key elements...

68
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,950
for this particular job...

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,020
but you also seem to show
a lack of general experience.

70
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,430
And to be honest, we feel
you are sort of a dullard.

71
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,230
Why do you say that?
l did everything you asked.

72
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,240
l even found out
who this Divine was.

73
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,070
Too late, too late...

74
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,440
and, naturally, you did
everything l asked, my dear.

75
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,740
You would never have
gotten to this plateau...

76
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,340
of the job placement test.

77
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,820
l mean, surely,
you can see our point.

78
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,150
We're not in a position
to just take anyone.

79
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,750
This is a high-security job,
as you can well imagine...

80
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,160
and we personally just don't
feel that you meet our...

81
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,320
oh, how should l say...

82
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
our admittedly sometimes
stringent screening process.

83
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,690
Well, why did you
hold me up for so long?

84
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,830
Why did you keep
asking me to come back?

85
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,140
l had another job
l could've taken.

86
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,640
How could l have gotten
information...

87
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,580
about this Divine you talk of?

88
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,640
l don't know her.

89
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,040
You could've given me
some lead as to how...

90
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,980
l could've gathered this data
you wanted about her.

91
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,180
You led me to believe
l had this job.

92
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,710
Well, Miss Sandstone...

93
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,690
Miss, uh, Sandy Sandstone...

94
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,660
you just must've been wrong in
your assumptions, weren't you?

95
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,100
l mean, surely,
you've heard the expression...

96
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,720
'"Don't count your chickens.""

97
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,390
Well, apply it.

98
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,630
l never gave you a final answer
on this whole thing...

99
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,040
and, as far as you believing
that you had the job...

100
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,730
well, l've never even
considered...

101
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,840
that you would be the applicant
that we would choose.

102
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,940
You don't know enough.

103
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,280
l mean, l wish everyone
was like you...

104
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,150
and had never heard of Divine...

105
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,590
but, unfortunately,
it just isn't like that.

106
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,750
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

107
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,590
l do have a busy day
ahead of me.

108
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,390
There's really nothing
left to discuss.

109
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,890
Well, what am l
supposed to do now?

110
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,690
That's what l'd like to know.

111
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,260
You can eat shit for all
l care, Miss Sandstone...

112
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,700
or eat anything that you like
or do anything that you like.

113
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,260
Just don't assume that l want
to know your troubles.

114
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,070
Now, if you wouldn't mind,
l'm a busy woman...

115
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,540
with a full day's work
ahead of me.

116
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,410
Please remove yourself
from my office.

117
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,240
You're a real cunt,
do you know that?

118
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,080
A real fucking cunt!

119
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,280
How can you be
so shitty to people?

120
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,190
How can you stand yourself?

121
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,990
l guess there's just two kinds
of people, Miss Sandstone...

122
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,190
my kind of people and assholes.

123
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,560
lt's rather obvious
which category you fit into.

124
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,030
Have a nice day.

125
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,860
Eat the bird, bitch!

126
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,960
You ready, Ma?

127
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,500
You ready yet?

128
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,540
l'm ready, darling.

129
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,510
Just let me say good-bye
to Mama and Cotton.

130
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,840
l'll be out in a minute, honey.

131
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,540
OK, Ma, but get the lead
out of your ass...

132
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,880
or l'll be late for my date.

133
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,980
All right.

134
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,610
Yes, won't l be late
for my date?

135
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,710
You are gonna love my date.

136
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,590
You'll like her as much as l do.

137
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,320
l'm going to bring her
back real soon...

138
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,760
for you all to enjoy.

139
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,360
What do you mean,
Humpty Dumpty was an egg?

140
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,660
How could a person
be an egg, Cotton?

141
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,900
How could a person
be an egg?

142
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,410
Well, he had little legs
and little arms...

143
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,530
and he could walk
and talk and all...

144
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,940
just like a person.

145
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,380
Only he was an egg--

146
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,810
a little egg, all dressed up.

147
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,280
Tell it to me again, Cotton.

148
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,220
You should be learning it
by now, Edie.

149
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,950
Now, listen carefully.

150
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,510
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

151
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,320
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

152
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,990
All the king's horses
and all the king's men...

153
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,590
couldn't put Humpty
together again.

154
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,310
Do you get it, Edie?
Do you understand?

155
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,470
Tell me some more
egg stories, Cotton.

156
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,170
Please tell me
some more stories.

157
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,650
l'm on my way.

158
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,170
You sure are dressed up, Babs.

159
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,780
You look real pretty.

160
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,380
Oh, thank you, Cotton.

161
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,750
Why, a girl can never tell...

162
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,220
who she might run into
when she's downtown.

163
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,890
Why, l'm all dressed up
and ready to fall in love.

164
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,790
l kind of wish
l was going out, too...

165
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,300
but l think Crackers...

166
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,920
is bringing
his lady friend out here...

167
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,130
and l don't want to miss that.

168
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,100
lt's usually a pretty good show.

169
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,230
Oh, l know.

170
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,040
You can go into town
the next time l go.

171
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,600
lt's just those errands
l have to run.

172
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,630
Besides,
you and Crackers will have...

173
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,740
a pretty good time right here.

174
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,640
That little shed's just perfect.

175
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,840
l know it, Babs.

176
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,710
lt'll be the first time
we've had anyone out here...

177
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,020
and l can't wait to see
how it works.

178
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,920
l hope she doesn't
give us any trouble.

179
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,750
Oh, l wouldn't worry about that.

180
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,450
Crackers has a pretty good eye
for what he likes.

181
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,260
Just say a little prayer
that l find a little something.

182
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,270
Why, l haven't fallen in love
for three whole days.

183
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,290
l'm just itching
to find somebody...

184
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,500
with a little imagination.

185
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,330
Bye-bye, Babs.

186
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,840
Mother, you do not have
to raise your voice...

187
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,070
and you don't have to yell.

188
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,480
We're all right here.
We can all hear you.

189
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,410
l do have to yell.

190
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,680
l'm starving to death...

191
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,450
and that eggman
ain't going to come...

192
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,120
and l know it.

193
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,820
You know he never comes
until later, Mother.

194
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,030
She'll be all right.

195
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,550
Go on, Babs.

196
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,900
She'll be all right.

197
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,400
Won't you, Mama?

198
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,460
You want some hard-boiled
eggs to nibble on...

199
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,060
while you're waiting?

200
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,040
Yes, l bet you do.

201
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,100
Bye, Babs.
Don't forget the party food.

202
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,180
Crackers, l'm ready!

203
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,980
Let's go, Mama.
l'm late for my date.

204
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,220
But, honey, how will you ever
get back out here from downtown?

205
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,280
We'll hitch probably, Ma.
lt ain't hard.

206
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,760
Just let me off
at the Edda Gown Shop.

207
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,460
That's where l'm supposed
to meet the little lady.

208
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,790
We'll get back somehow.

209
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,700
l just hope she's ready
for a little action.

210
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,630
Oh, honey, l know what you mean.

211
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,970
Why, l wouldn't mind
finding a little action myself.

212
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,300
But then, you shouldn't
have too much trouble...

213
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,470
with your date--

214
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,840
that is, if she has
anything on the ball.

215
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,840
Just hope she likes
to experiment...

216
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,970
you know what l mean?

217
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,610
A little sweet talking
goes a long, long way.

218
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,640
Give me your hand, honey.

219
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,550
Channing!

220
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,090
Jesus Christ.

221
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,130
Are they here yet?

222
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,160
Yes, they've been waiting.

223
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,430
Well, show them in.

224
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,640
Mrs. Marble will see you now.

225
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,340
Come on, Merle,
she's ready to see us.

226
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,610
l'm coming, l'm coming.

227
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,580
Hi, Miss Marble.

228
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,250
We've been so excited
about this all week...

229
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,250
me and Merle.

230
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,480
We can hardly sleep at night...

231
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,420
just waiting to see
little Noodle's face.

232
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,760
And, shit, we usually
sleep pretty good.

233
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,420
Me and Annette is really gonna
have to settle down...

234
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,690
once we get Noodles home.

235
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,100
lt's going to be a lot different
with a baby around.

236
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,530
Yes, well, as l said...

237
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,160
Mr. Marble and l

238
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,030
that you will get Noodles...

239
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,200
but, first, have a seat...

240
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,800
so l can just briefly
recheck your application.

241
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,240
Don't say anything, all right?

242
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,570
Just don't say a word.

243
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,910
When are you going
to get her out of here?

244
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,380
Come on, little Noodles,
you just found a new home.

245
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,780
That's real nice!

246
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,450
Poor fucking Alice
dies giving birth...

247
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,720
you can't even bother
to move the body...

248
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,160
and now the bitch
has sold the kid!

249
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,220
Poor baby!

250
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,280
And you, you little suckling...

251
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,490
can't even get me
my tranquilizers!

252
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,120
You shithead,
where are my pills?

253
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,860
That bitch can afford it.

254
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,700
She's got another couple grand
coming for this one.

255
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,610
Can't she at least
give me my fucking pills?

256
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,540
l said don't talk to me
when l come down here.

257
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,570
l don't give a fuck
what you said, you fucking pig!

258
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,450
Get this body out of here!
lt's making me sick!

259
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,140
When are they gonna
get another one?

260
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,410
What poor girl
will they get next?

261
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,010
l know they're gonna
get another one.

262
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,250
Just like when l came here,
l replaced somebody, didn't l?

263
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,260
You fucking little dingleberry!

264
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,920
That's what you're like,
you fucking ball of shit!

265
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,190
l said shut up!

266
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,960
Just shut up and don't talk
to me when l come down here!

267
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
Oh, look how pretty she is.

268
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,330
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

269
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,500
Connie, do they get this?

270
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,480
Yes, they do, Chan.

271
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,410
Look how pretty she is.

272
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,780
Oh, Merle, l'm so happy.

273
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,780
And, baby,
if you're happy, l'm happy...

274
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,650
'cause that's what
l'm living for--

275
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,280
you, me, and now,
little Noodles.

276
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,450
Thank you, Miss Marble.

277
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,520
Without you, we never
would've been this happy.

278
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,080
You are a wonderful,
wonderful person.

279
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,100
Thank you.

280
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,430
Well, thank you, ladies.

281
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,230
lf it wasn't for you, l wouldn't
be in this business...

282
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,790
and that's all l care about
is satisfying my customers...

283
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,200
and making sure
that the babies...

284
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,570
are placed in good homes.

285
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,700
Thank you.

286
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,400
Bye-bye, now.

287
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,670
We'll see who's
the filthiest person alive.

288
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,930
We'll just see!

289
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,510
And where is that Raymond?

290
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,370
Where is he?

291
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,840
How could he leave me alone...

292
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,310
when there's so much
to be taken care of?

293
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,310
Please come home, Raymond.

294
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,840
l need you so badly.

295
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,630
Can you hurry, driver?
l'll be late for my appointment.

296
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,730
l'm going as fast as l can,
lady, without breaking the law.

297
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,140
3800 Greymeadow, right?

298
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,670
That's what l said, wasn't it?

299
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,810
2.30.

300
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,970
You can shove 2.30, hack!

301
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,380
Why, hello, Cookie.

302
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,860
l do hope you're hungry.

303
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,090
l could go for a sandwich.

304
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,390
Bologna.

305
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,060
Well...

306
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,930
l'll get right to the point.

307
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,900
l can get you information
about Divine.

308
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,910
Lots of information, l think,
if things go well today.

309
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,470
l have a date
with her son Crackers.

310
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,670
Well, this is, of course,
an encouraging development.

311
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,200
This is an important
assignment, Cookie.

312
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,380
We could all benefit--

313
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,040
you, financially...

314
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,520
and, Raymond and l...

315
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,080
well, our social standing
is involved to a great degree.

316
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,590
l may have to degrade myself
in front of Divine's son.

317
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,720
He's into a very strange
sex scene.

318
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,820
l'm going to have to put up
with unheard of atrocities...

319
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,500
in order to pump the information
you need out of him.

320
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,560
But, first, l have to know
exactly what you want to know...

321
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,470
because my so-called date
is this afternoon.

322
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,030
Well, Cookie, as you know...

323
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,940
Divine has achieved
a sort of fame lately...

324
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,950
both locally
and on the national level.

325
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,010
You may have heard the term,
""the filthiest person alive.""

326
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,680
l have heard the term, yes.

327
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,020
The papers call her that...

328
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,080
and she is known as that
to a limited extent...

329
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,990
in your more crime-conscious
sections of the city.

330
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,960
Well, we feel this to be
an untrue statement.

331
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,290
We feel that Raymond
and l far surpass her...

332
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,930
in every aspect
of the term ""filth.""

333
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,200
As you know, we run a baby ring.

334
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,330
Oh, it's really
a very simple process.

335
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,400
We keep two girls
at all times...

336
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,270
who are impregnated
by Channing...

337
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,610
our rather fertile servant.

338
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,770
We sell the babies
to lesbian couples...

339
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,340
and then we invest the money...

340
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,280
in various businesses
around town.

341
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,840
We own a few
pornography shops...

342
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,910
plus, we front money
to a chain of heroin pushers...

343
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,120
in the inner city
elementary schools.

344
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,210
We feel that the attention...

345
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,780
that's been focused
on Divine lately...

346
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,660
is most unfair.

347
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,530
She is merely a common thief
and murderer.

348
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,900
Unfortunately, for us,
our line of work...

349
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,200
limits our chances
for publicity and travel...

350
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,070
but this does not mean
that we wish to go unnoticed.

351
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,500
After all, we've not
worked all these years...

352
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,100
in order to be upstaged
by this fat hog...

353
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,730
that calls herself Divine.

354
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,240
So we must catch her
off guard, you see...

355
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,370
before she realizes
she is being attacked.

356
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,250
We need information
as to how they live...

357
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,620
where they live,
how many people, their names...

358
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,020
their daily schedules
for the week.

359
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,180
ln other words...

360
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,880
we want to know how
we can plague her the most...

361
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,150
how we can make her life
as miserable as possible...

362
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,420
how we can prove to her...

363
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,930
that she is shit
compared to us--

364
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,230
shit compared to the filth
that we have in our minds...

365
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,860
shit compared to what we know
to be the filthiest delight.

366
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,570
Well, does Crackers know
that his so-called date...

367
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,400
is actually a spy
sent by the Marbles?

368
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,640
This is my grandma Edie.

369
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,120
What's the matter with her?

370
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,210
What's the matter with her?

371
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,240
There ain't nothing
the matter with her.

372
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,690
She's just my grandma,
that's all.

373
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,190
Why are those eggs
all over her face?

374
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,060
l guess she was just hungry,
that's all.

375
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,760
You see, she sort of
has some problems.

376
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,290
Nothing serious, but, you know--

377
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,930
l mean, she just loves eggs...

378
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,130
always has.

379
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,000
Sit tight. l'll go see
if Miss Cotton's up yet.

380
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,270
She's here, Miss Cotton,
she's here.

381
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,330
lt shouldn't be long now
before l get it going.

382
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,440
That is, if she cooperates,
and she will.

383
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,280
Oh, Crackers, l'm so excited.

384
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,810
l've just been
sitting right here...

385
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,320
ever since you left.

386
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,940
What's she like?
Does she have a nice body?

387
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,350
What are you going to do
for me today, honey?

388
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,860
lt's something
l haven't seen, l hope.

389
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,760
Miss Cotton, l got
something in mind today...

390
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,780
l never, ever tried before,
something very exciting for me.

391
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,020
My little chicken's going to be
in the show today, Cotton--

392
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,660
me and some nice
juicy plump chickens.

393
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,600
l need this so bad, Crackers.

394
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,160
Make it better
than you did last time.

395
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,100
What was the matter with that?
You said you liked that show.

396
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,000
Oh, l did, l did.

397
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,100
lt's just that you were so
fucking beautiful in that one...

398
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,400
that now l want more.

399
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,840
l got to see more, Crackers--

400
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,670
more than what l've
already seen.

401
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,010
Can we have some blood
in this one?

402
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,070
Just a little bit?

403
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,280
And take your clothes off
slower, slower...

404
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,810
and don't let her ruin it!

405
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,620
Miss Cotton,
you're gonna dig this one.

406
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,520
lt's going to be better
than anything l ever did before.

407
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,320
l can feel my blood,
all through my body.

408
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,790
You know l only do it for you.

409
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,160
lt's only you watching
that gets me off, you know that.

410
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,670
l'll make it special today,
l promise.

411
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,000
Please be careful
not to touch me.

412
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,630
-Please be careful.
-l ain't touching you!

413
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,670
Oh, hi, pretty little face.

414
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,180
Pretty little face
you got there.

415
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,910
Hello, l'm Cookie.

416
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,510
l understand you're Edie...

417
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,950
Crackers' grandmother.

418
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,050
Edie, sweetie Edie.

419
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,290
ls Babs back from shopping
for the birthday party?

420
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,390
l'm gonna go.

421
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,060
l got a party dress, you know.

422
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,230
When is the party?

423
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,570
Oh, Babs' birthday.

424
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,800
Are you the eggman?

425
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,900
Well, no.

426
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,380
No, l'm not.

427
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,710
Where's Crackers' mother?

428
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,340
Oh, she's calling
all the people...

429
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,470
to invite them to the party...

430
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,540
and l'm gonna go.

431
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,410
Well, l see you're up, Granny.

432
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,290
Miss Cookie,
this is Miss Cotton.

433
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,190
She's one of my roommates here.

434
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,920
Charmed, l'm sure.

435
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,330
Hello, Cookie.

436
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,400
You sure are
a fine-looking young woman.

437
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,420
Crackers has told me about you.

438
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,700
Why don't you show her the shed?

439
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,900
You'll like it out there.
lt's so private.

440
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,370
Oh, l'd love to see it.

441
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,600
Do you sleep in here, Cotton?

442
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,010
Of course l do, next to Babs.

443
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,130
l couldn't sleep anywhere else.

444
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,150
Come on, Cookie,
l'll go show you my chickens.

445
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,770
Oh, you have chickens?

446
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,010
l love little chickies.

447
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,310
Hold it!

448
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,660
Chicken.

449
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,810
Hold it! Right there!

450
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,310
Hold it!

451
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,310
Hold these

452
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,180
Chickens! God!

453
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,020
Don't!

454
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,150
Chickens!
All these chickens!

455
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,320
Fuckin' chickens!

456
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,690
These fuckin' things hurt!

457
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,010
These--

458
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,740
Oh, God! You're crazy.

459
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,420
Eggman! Eggman!

460
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,690

461
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,700

00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,540
The eggman! The eggman!

470
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,050
Hello, Edie.
How's my little princess today?

471
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,380
Mr. Eggman!

472
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,880
Mr. Eggman, we're havin'
a party for Babs on Thursday.

473
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,390
We'd like you to come
as Edie's date.

474
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,120
Well, l would be
honored to attend...

475
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,390
especially with such
a beautiful date.

476
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,900
And now, Edie,
what will it be today?

477
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,400
l have grade ""A"" extra large.

478
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,900
l have grade ""A"" large.

479
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,900
l have medium. l have small.

480
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,840
l have brown, and l have white.

481
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,400
Why, look. Just look at these.

482
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,840
So fresh,
you could hardly believe it.

483
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,840
Why, they're just beggin'
to be scrambled or fried...

484
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,710
or poached or hard-boiled...

485
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,840
or all around ready to be thrown
into a big, fat, juicy omelet.

486
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,350
How 'bout it, Edie?

487
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,840
What'll it be for the lady
that the eggs like the most?

488
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:23,820
l want them all!

489
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,360
l'll have the brown ones...

490
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,860
and those
great big white ones...

491
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,360
and l'll have those over there.

492
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,860
And l want some for frying
and for scrambling...

493
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,870
and for hard-boiled for snacks.

494
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,370
Oh, God, and l'll have
those over there.

495
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,880
All right, Edie,
we'll buy 'em all for you.

496
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,880
How's that? We'll buy 'em all.

497
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,880
Oh, Cotton,
you make me so happy...

498
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,380
you and the eggman.

499
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,880
Please, Mr. Eggman...

500
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,380
please don't ever quit your job.

501
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,380
l'll always need--want eggs,
always and always and always.

502
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,020
Miss Edie, as long
as there are chicken layin'...

503
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,890
and truck drivin',
and my feet walkin'...

504
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,390
you can be sure...

505
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,830
that l will bring you
the finest of the fine...

506
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,830
the largest of the large,
and the whitest of the white.

507
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,960
ln other words...

508
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,330
that thin-shelled ovum
of the domestic fowl...

509
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,840
will never be safe...

510
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,840
as long as there
are chicken layin'...

511
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,340
and l'm alive
because l am your eggman...

512
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,850
and there ain't
a better one in town.

513
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,310
Oh, Mr. Eggman.

514
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,650
Nothing but these fucking
jerk-off hippies...

515
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,310
on the road today.

516
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,320
Where are their
little pig girlfriends?

517
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,190
God, l get so tired
of just driving around...

518
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,700
driving around.

519
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,530
Here's one up ahead.

520
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,030
Pull over!

521
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,040
She looks real good.

522
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,730
She'll do just fine.

523
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,800
Thanks.

524
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,640
Have a seat.

525
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,770
Thank you.

526
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,110
Hi. Wow, where'd you
get this beautiful car?

527
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,050
At a car dealer.
Where did you think?

528
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,210
Where you going?

529
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,720
Just downtown.
Anywhere near Howard Street.

530
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,220
Oh, meeting someone?

531
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,190
Who?!

532
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,660
My boyfriend and
a couple other guys. Why?

533
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,520
Going to a gang-bang
or something?

534
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,390
What?
Hey, what's with you two?

535
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,790
We just wondered
where you were planning...

536
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,820
to spread your V.D. today,
that's all, hussy.

537
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,490
Hey, l don't think
that's necessary.

538
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,000
You don't?

539
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,010
Well, how would you like
to fuck my chauffeur?

540
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,010
He's got a real
horse dick on him.

541
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,240
Hey, Connie!

542
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,670
Hey, come on!
Just let me out here!

543
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,010
This is fine right up here!

544
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,740
Why do you want to get out here?
This isn't downtown.

545
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,250
We're nowhere near downtown.

546
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,840
What's the matter, you afraid
it ain't big enough for ya?

547
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,350
Cut it out!
Just let me out here, please!

548
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,350
You'd better sit back.
Give me the rag.

549
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,290
Get the fuck off of me!
Please!

550
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,760
There. She's out now.

551
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,370
l have a new friend for you.

552
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,870
Already?
You got one already?

553
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,380
Why is she asleep?
Or is she dead?

554
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,380
Did you just kill her?
Where did they get her?

555
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,880
Where'd they get this one?

556
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,820
Hitchhiking, just like you were.

557
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,820
Doesn't pay to hitchhike
these days, does it?

558
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,320
And l guess you're gonna
fuck her now, is that it?

559
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,980
Right in front of me!

560
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,120
The poor girl.

561
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,990
The poor girl has to fuck you.

562
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,990
Thank God l don't remember it!

563
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,500
Thank God you spared me
at least that!

564
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,500
l have a surprise
for you this time.

565
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,500
l don't even have to touch her.

566
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,500
How'd you get out of
that part of the job?

567
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,170
Did your boss finally decide
someone else would do it?

568
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,830
Who? Her slimy boyfriend?

569
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:31,240
ls she going to let that fag
do it in front of me?

570
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,840
That whore.

571
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,540
Oh, no. This is a surprise
for Connie and Raymond, too.

572
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,350
l have it all figured out
this time.

573
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,410
l don't even have to touch her.

574
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,890
Why'd you have to touch me?

575
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,750
How could l have a child by you?

576
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,190
What a repulsive thought!

577
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,350
You pig, you animal!

578
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,860
How could you keep doing this?

579
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,870
Oh, my God! What are you doing?!

580
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,870
Why are you doing that
in front of me?

581
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,370
Stop it, you asshole!

582
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,860
Oh, how vile can you be?!

583
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,310
Shut up! Shut up!

584
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,170
You'll see. Just shut up.

585
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,310
l swear l'm gonna
throw up on you, Chan.

586
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,410
l swear l'm gonna puke
if you don't stop doing that!

587
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,320
Turn your head
if it makes you sick!

588
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,480
Don't watch!

589
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,190
Think of how sick
it made me to touch you!

590
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,890
And now...this one...

591
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,010
You repulsive pig!

592
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,500
You hate her so much
you get her pregnant this way?

593
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,510
Oh, my God! Stop it!

594
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,380
Stop it, you filthy animal!

595
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,400
Stop it!

596
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,750
Shit. l'll get it.

597
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,680
Just let me finish you off.

598
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,210
lt may be Cookie.

599
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,360
Come on, you're almost there!

600
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,860
But it's probably Cookie
with the information.

601
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,200
Answer it, then.
Answer it!

602
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,330
Marbles' residence.

603
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,340
Mr. Marble? This is Cookie.

604
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,810
No, no. l'm all right.

605
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,330
l'm back at my mother's.

606
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,340
l was afraid to come
directly there.

607
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,350
l thought maybe
they'd be following me.

608
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,350
Look, l have to have
my money immediately.

609
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,350
Of course you'll get
your stool-pigeon money.

610
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,150
Why on earth
are you so suspicious?

611
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,840
Well, naturally l'm going
to question you about the money.

612
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,450
You've no idea of what l
went through today...

613
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,920
to get you that information.

614
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,830
And you did call yourselves
""the filthiest people alive.""

615
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,490
Well, what kind of credit rating
do you think that is?

616
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,160
We need that information
immediately...

617
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,320
so that we can prepare...

618
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,730
our little surprise
for that slut.

619
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,500
Hold on a minute, Cookie.

620
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,400
She's afraid we won't pay her
if she tells us now.

621
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,670
Why? lsn't she coming here
like she said she would?

622
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,000
Let me talk to her.

623
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,840
Cookie, this is Mrs. Marble.

624
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,470
What is this nonsense
about the money?

625
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,140
Of course we will pay you.

626
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,550
Look, l'll tell you
everything...

627
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,240
but you have to meet me
right away with the money...

628
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,810
all 2,000 of it in $20 bills.

629
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,020
We'll meet you at Harry's
Little Sub Shop on 25th Street.

630
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,520
You name the time.

631
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,250
All right, Cookie now give us
the information immediately.

632
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,920
How do we even know
you were there?

633
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,690
Oh, l was there
all right, Mr. Marble.

634
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,790
Divine is living under the name
of Babs Johnson.

635
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,200
Babs Johnson.

636
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,140
Babs Johnson.
Oh, what a stupid, fucking name.

637
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,300
She sounds like a chimpanzee
on a tire swing.

638
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,810
She's living in a trailer
in Phoenix, Maryland.

639
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,640
Who does she live with?

640
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,650
Her mother.

641
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,210
She lives with her mother...

642
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,150
and her mother
sleeps in a playpen.

643
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,160
Like a baby?
Oh, God, how heartwarming.

644
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,220
And her son
and her traveling companion.

645
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,820
Birthday? A party? When?

646
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,490
Oh, how perfect.

647
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,500
Oh, that pig will never
get away with it.

648
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,000
Never, never, never!

649
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,530
lt'll be her most
embarrassing birthday.

650
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,040
Mr. Marble, l should be there
in about twenty minutes.

651
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,540
You'd better be there...

652
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,550
or l'm gonna tell Crackers
everything about you two.

653
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,670
Thank you, Cookie.

654
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,740
At last our plan can begin.

655
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,190
Are you ready
for phase one, Raymond?

656
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,620
Oh, God.
At last we can show her.

657
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,630
At last we can put our plan into
effect.

658
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,030
l only wish
l could see her face--

659
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,620
her fat little face--
when she realizes...

660
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,120
that there is indeed
someone filthier than her.

661
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,640
She can eat
the cover of ""Midnight.""

662
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,160
She can eat all her publicity...

663
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,640
in front of her rotten
little party guests.

664
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,040
ls her present ready?

665
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,980
Yes. l've had it
for several months now, Connie.

666
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,310
Look. Here it is.

667
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,810
l've had it for almost
a year now, all ready.

668
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,980
Special delivery.

669
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,480
Phase one--the filthiest gesture
in the world.

670
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,490
Her little surprise package.

671
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,330
Do you think she'll like
our little gesture, Connie?

672
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,830
Do you think she'll appreciate
our little gift?

673
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,830
For over a year now
this has been only a dream...

674
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,430
only a prayer...

675
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,840
but we have her address now.

676
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,340
lt is a reality.

677
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,170
She will realize soon.
She will know soon.

678
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,680
Connie...at last!

679
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,680
The battle of filth shall begin!

680
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,150
l love you, Raymond!

681
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,630
l love you more than anything
in this whole world.

682
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,790
l love you even more
than my own filthiness...

683
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,960
more than my hair color.

684
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,300
Oh, God.

685
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,960
l love you more than the sound
of bones breaking...

686
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,970
the sounds of death rattle!

687
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,970
Even...even more
than my own shit...

688
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,310
do l love you, Raymond!

689
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,310
And...and l, Connie,
also love you...

690
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,870
more than anything that
l could ever imagine.

691
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,890
More than my hair color!

692
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,380
More than the sound
of babies crying...

693
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,220
of dogs dying.

694
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,320
Even more than the thought
of original sin itself.

695
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,820
Oh, l am yours, Connie,
eternally united to you...

696
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:58,130
through an invisible cord
of finely woven filth...

697
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:03,600
that even God himself
could never, ever break.

698
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,710
That old black magic
got me in its spell

699
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,890
Old black magic
that you weave so well

700
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,260
lcy fingers
up and down my spine

701
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,200
Theme of witchcraft
that once was mine

702
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,790
Way to thaw

703
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,840
Round, round, round l go

704
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,670
Down, down, down l go

705
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,680
ln that spin,
that fabulous spin that l'm in

706
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,170
Under that old black magic
called love

707
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,210
Cotton, dinner's on!

708
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,360
Crackers, dinner's ready!

709
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,020
Well! You're looking
pretty chipper, Mama.

710
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,030
How was that eggman today?

711
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,520
Oh, Babs, he's gonna come
to the party as my date.

712
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,840
And Cotton bought me
so many eggs today.

713
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,030
Look at these.

714
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,700
So many little eggies.
And l'm still starving.

715
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,110
And l'm going to eat them all
before l go to sleepy.

716
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,050
Good.

717
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,380
Smells delicious, Babs!

718
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,390
Thank you, Cotton. lt should.

719
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,390
l warmed it up
when l was downtown today...

720
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,720
in my own little oven.

721
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,490
Babs, where do eggs come from?

722
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,330
From little chickens, Mama.

723
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,840
They lay them, and we eat them.

724
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,340
But suppose someday
there weren't any chickens.

725
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,840
Would that mean
there wouldn't be any eggs?

726
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,000
Oh, l don't think you have
to worry about that, Mama.

727
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,140
But...but is it true, Babs?

728
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,670
lf there weren't any chickens,
there wouldn't be any eggs?

729
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,120
ls that true?

730
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,310
l suppose so, Mama...

731
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,880
but there will
always be chickens.

732
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,510
You can be sure of that.

733
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,020
But suppose someday it happens.

734
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,530
Suppose someday
there weren't any chickens.

735
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,030
Oh, Babs,
what could l possibly do?

736
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,030
And then the eggman
wouldn't have--

737
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,190
he wouldn't have a job.

738
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,030
lt might happen, Babs.

739
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,540
What could l do?

740
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,540
Now, Mama,
that's just egg paranoia.

741
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,540
l think you're being very silly.

742
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,540
There will always be chickens.

743
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,880
Why, there are
so many chickens now...

744
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:57,540
that we can eat some
and let some of them live...

745
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,050
in order
to supply us with eggs.

746
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:02,210
Chickens are plentiful, Mama.

747
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,160
The world will never
be without chickens.

748
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,590
You can be sure of that.

749
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,830
Afternoon, Ma.

750
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,090
Hi, honey.

751
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,430
Aren't they good?

752
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,400
Who could that be?

753
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,070
l'll be right behind you, Ma.

754
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,080
Answer it.
lt might not be nothin'.

755
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,540
lt's a fucking mailman.

756
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,840
A mailman?
What kind of shit is that?

757
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,180
There ain't no address here.

758
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,680
l'll take care of it.
Mother, shut up.

759
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,050
Crackers, cover me.

760
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,310
Cotton, take that gun.

761
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,480
You know how to use it
if you have to.

762
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,350
Right between the eyes.

763
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,860
Miss Babs Johnson?

764
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,360
Yes, l'm Babs Johnson.

765
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,860
Special delivery package, ma'am.

766
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,360
Sign here, please.

767
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,300
What do you mean,
special delivery package?

768
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,360
There's no address here.

769
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,490
Says right here...

770
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,870
'"Babs Johnson, a trailer,
Phoenix, Maryland.""

771
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,870
And you are Babs Johnson,
aren't you?

772
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,270
Of course l'm Babs Johnson.
l just told you that.

773
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,370
But there is no address here.

774
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,880
This is not on any road,
route, or street...

775
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,810
and l don't want
people on my property...

776
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,820
so don't ever
bring mail here again.

777
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,320
Do you understand?

778
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,320
And the next package
you bring me...

779
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,320
is gettin' shoved right
up your little ass.

780
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,820
Can you comprehend that?

781
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,830
l understand.

782
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,330
l comprehend. l understand.

783
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,830
Now you've received
some new training...

784
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,330
as you call it...

785
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,460
and you'd better remember it.

786
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,560
So you have exactly
fifteen seconds...

787
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,230
to get off of my property,
motherfucker...

788
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,000
before l break
your goddamn neck.

789
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,340
1--1,000...

790
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,840
2--1,000...

791
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,170
3--1,000...

792
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,510
4--1,000.

793
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,570
Run, you bastard, run!

794
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,140
Good work, Babs.

795
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,510
He ran just like a jackrabbit.

796
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,520
That was a person, Ma,
l'm sure of that.

797
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,180
Least it wasn't no porker.

798
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,520
l thought for sure
it was the cops.

799
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,780
Who could've sent me
this package?

800
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,880
Who would dare send me
a package like this?

801
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,700
The return address is
'"The Filthiest People Alive.""

802
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,300
Who would dare use that title?
Who would dare?!

803
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,200
Wrapped all fancy.

804
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,500
lt's just a birthday present,
Babs.

805
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,810
No, it's no birthday present,
Cotton.

806
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,110
l smell deep, dark trouble.

807
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,640
Oh, my God Almighty!

808
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:16,150
Someone has sent me
a bowel movement!

809
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,160
Oh, Babs!

810
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,990
A turd, Mama, a turd!

811
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,190
Who could've sent this?

812
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,250
A turd?

813
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,730
Oh, a turd! Oh, Babs!

814
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,930
This is a direct attack
on my divinity...

815
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,130
a direct attack
on the peace and harmony...

816
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,640
of our last few weeks here...

817
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,930
an outrageous attempt...

818
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,600
to humiliate and disgrace
my private life!

819
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,440
Someone will pay for this.

820
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,740
Someone will pay with their life
for this grossly offensive act!

821
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,720
Mama, nobody sends you a turd
and expects to live. Nobody!

822
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,220
Why would anybody
do this to us? Why?

823
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,220
Look. Look, here's a card.

824
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,750
Read it, Cotton.

825
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,760
lt's a birthday card,
a fucking birthday card!

826
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,360
Well, what does it say?!

827
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,030
Oh, God, Babs.

828
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,090
'"Happy birthday, fatso.""

829
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,630
""You are no longer
the filthiest person alive.

830
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:08,300
'"We are.""

831
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,610
Signed, ""The Filthiest
People Alive.""

832
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,980
Just as l thought--

833
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,180
a deliberate attempt
to seize my title!

834
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,180
Eggman didn't do it, Babs.

835
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,690
l know the eggman didn't do it.

836
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,910
l don't think he did,
either, Mother.

837
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,820
Now, shut up
and let me think, will you?

838
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,520
That Cookie was asking
questions, Crackers.

839
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,680
l heard her.

840
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,320
She's right, Ma. She's right.

841
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,490
But why would she
send us a turd?

842
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,690
Who knows? Who knows?

843
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,530
These are obviously
jealous people--

844
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,930
jealous of our careers,
of all of our press.

845
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,840
Why else would they sign that
""The Filthiest People Alive""?

846
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,670
Everyone knows that that title
has become my trademark.

847
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,000
Why, to use it in this way...

848
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,510
is only to insinuate that
they are filthier than l.

849
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,170
How could anyone
seriously believe that?

850
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,680
How could anyone
be filthier than Divine?

851
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,180
l'm afraid
our little vacation...

852
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,680
must come to an end.

853
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,350
This must be nipped in the bud.

854
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,510
lt's already out of hand.

855
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,180
Now we must outfilth...

856
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,690
the asshole or assholes
that sent this.

857
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,420
And then they must die!

858
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,290
Connie and Raymond Marble...

859
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:08,560
while you are away,
the servants will play.

860
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,260
Well, Miss Sandstone...

861
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,140
after going over
your qualifications...

862
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,640
Mr. Marble and l feel
that you are not exactly...

863
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,640
what we had in mind
for the job.

864
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,650
Not only have you never
heard of Divine...

865
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,150
which is one
of the key elements...

866
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,650
for this particular job...

867
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,650
but you also seem to show
a lack of general experience.

868
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:27,310
And to be perfectly honest...

869
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,820
we feel that you are
sort of a dullard.

870
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,820
Why isn't Channing here
to take off my coat?

871
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,830
He's getting lazier and lazier
as each day ends, Raymond.

872
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,330
l'll speak to him.

873
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,530
We must remember that Channing
isn't as intelligent as us.

874
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:46,000
This is a high security job,
as you can well imagine...

875
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,670
and we personally
just don't feel...

876
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:50,680
that you meet our--
oh, how should l say--

877
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,840
our admittedly sometimes
stringent screening process.

878
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,850
Who on earth is that?

879
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,350
Sounds like Channing.

880
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,180
Well, doing what,
l'd like to know.

881
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,130
l love you, Raymond.

882
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,130
l love you more than
anything in this world.

883
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,790
l love you
more than my own filthiness...

884
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,300
even more
than my own hair color.

885
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,240
More than the sound
of bones breaking...

886
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,710
the sound of the death rattle.

887
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,710
Oh, my.

888
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,650
And l, Connie...

889
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,620
l, Connie, also love you...

890
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,320
more than anything
l could ever imagine...

891
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,330
more than
my own hair color...

892
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,590
more than the sound
of babies screaming...

893
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,190
the sound of dogs dying.

894
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,500
What do you think
you're doing?!

895
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,500
What is the meaning
of this outrage?!

896
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,000
Let me at him !

897
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,010
l've been waiting
to do this for a lifetime!

898
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,510
No, Connie, no!

899
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,010
How do you dare to be
dressed as you are?

900
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:02,450
How do you dare to be saying
the things we heard you say?

901
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,850
No! Please, listen!

902
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,150
l didn't mean any harm !
Let me go, Connie!

903
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,650
You little asshole.
You'd better start explaining.

904
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,660
How dare you go into
my personal clothes closet...

905
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,160
and get my suit!

906
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,160
And that's my makeup
you have on, isn't it?!

907
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,160
You sneaky little drag queen!

908
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,670
You've been spying on us,
haven't you?

909
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,670
Haven't you, aerial-ears?!

910
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,160
Mimicking my wife's hard work
and her beautiful appearance.

911
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,170
And having the gall
to repeat words...

912
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:30,180
that Connie and l
spoke confidentially...

913
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,180
words that are guarded
by the holy seal of matrimony!

914
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:35,040
l can't help it!

915
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,670
l didn't mean any harm !

916
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,010
lt was just playing!

917
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,020
'"Playing""?

918
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,520
ls that what you
call it, Channing?

919
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:43,020
Or should l start
calling you ""Connie"" now?

920
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,020
ls that what you'd like?!

921
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,030
No, Connie! Stop hitting me!

922
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,030
l didn't do anything to you!

923
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,690
l was just here by myself...

924
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,700
and l get feeling funny
when l'm alone!

925
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,700
Those girls are down there,
don't forget!

926
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,700
And l can't stand being
in the same house with them !

927
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,710
lf l sit downstairs,
l can hear them screaming...

928
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,340
screaming and crying,
and then l get all nervous.

929
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,210
Then l get these spells!
l don't plan it!

930
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,650
lt just happens.

931
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,050
Then l think about my position,
my social standing...

932
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,080
just like you two do,
and l just play!

933
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,710
l just make believe
that l am you!

934
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,190
l know it isn't reality!
l know that l'm really me!

935
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:24,200
Haven't l been a faithful
servant for two years now?

936
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,360
Haven't l given you
my all in this job?

937
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,370
Oh, you've been faithful,
all right...

938
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,200
faithful in your stupidity,
faithful in your laziness...

939
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,540
faithful in your incompetent
lame-brained attitude!

940
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:40,200
And now this shockingly
flagrant breach of contract!

941
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:44,210
We can no longer employ you
here at 3,900, Channing.

942
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,220
That is obvious.

943
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,880
There will be
a complete inspection...

944
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,890
of all your bags, Channing...

945
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,390
so do not attempt...

946
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,890
to take any of
my clothing with you.

947
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,890
l will also take
a complete inventory...

948
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,400
of all my belongings,
from makeup--

949
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,460
Oh, God!
Right on down to panties!

950
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,900
And, of course,
have everything...

951
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,840
sent to the cleaners
immediately.

952
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:08,330
God knows what you could've
gotten on my clothes.

953
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,340
Now, go to your room,
Channing...

954
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,840
and stay there
until we summon you!

955
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,350
Please change your minds!

956
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,850
lt was only playing!

957
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,970
l won't ever--

958
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,180
Stop that yammering and move.

959
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,510
And don't try anything funny...

960
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,750
or you'll be right down there
with Suzie and Linda.

961
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,690
How would you like that?

962
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,850
Had we known...

963
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,590
we would've given you
a maid's uniform to wear...

964
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,960
instead of a butler's!

965
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,300
Just playing.

966
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,870
l know l'm not you, Connie.

967
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,380
lt was just playing.

968
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,380
l didn't mean any harm.

969
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,380
Raymond, l wasn't really spying.

970
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,880
lt was just playing.

971
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,390
What will they do with me?

972
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,890
Oh, God,
please make them let me stay.

973
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,890
l'm afraid.
Oh, God, have mercy on me.

974
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,550
Now what are you saying?!

975
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,650
Nothing, Raymond!

976
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,490
Oh, God, nothing!
l wasn't saying anything!

977
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,020
Connie and l
have to go out for a while.

978
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,730
We want to be sure
you stay in your room...

979
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,100
so we're going to lock you in.

980
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,300
Lock me in?

981
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,310
l won't go anywhere, Raymond.
Please.

982
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,170
You shouldn't mind staying
in here, Channing.

983
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,000
lt's rather obvious
that you are...

984
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,510
to use vulgar slang...

985
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,010
a closet queen, as they call it.

986
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,510
Raymond, please!

987
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,010
Don't lock me in!

988
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,350
Please! l won't go anywhere!

989
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,850
l'll just stay here
and be me when you're gone!

990
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,620
l won't even think about
being you! Please!

991
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,850
With the shock
of the obscene parcel...

992
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,620
still fresh in their minds...

993
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,720
the trailer residents
bravely go ahead...

994
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,630
with their
birthday celebration...

995
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,560
and the eggman
lets his true feelings...

996
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,120
be known to Edie.

997
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:42,660
Oh, happy day!

998
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,070
Edie has accepted the eggman's
offer of marriage.

999
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:53,040
And you mean you'll bring me
fifty eggs a day?

1000
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:57,880
And l can come and visit Babs
and Cotton and Crackers?

1001
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,890
And you'll buy me
a new girdle and bra...

1002
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,350
and pretty underthings?

1003
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,330
l'll make you
the happiest egglady ever.

1004
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,660
Don't you worry about that.

1005
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:09,820
l love you.

1006
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,830
l love you more than anything
in this whole world.

1007
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:14,490
And right after
the party's over...

1008
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,830
you and l are gonna take
our first little trip together.

1009
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:21,400
l'm gonna take you to
the largest poultry factory...

1010
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,910
on the East Coast.

1011
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,840
And then you can eat
and eat and eat...

1012
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,850
all the eggs you ever want.

1013
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,850
A hundred eggs a day?

1014
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,350
You mean l can eat
a hundred eggs?

1015
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,350
A thousand if you want 'em.

1016
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:37,360
Oh, l do love you, Mr. Eggman...

1017
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:40,360
even though l do love
my little eggies...

1018
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:41,860
just a little bit better.

1019
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:44,390
But l do love you, Mr. Eggman...

1020
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,370
more than any man
l have ever known.

1021
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,770
And l, Edie, love you
more than any woman...

1022
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,860
l have ever laid eyes on.

1023
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,530
And if you love me...

1024
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,370
just half as much
as you love them eggs...

1025
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,700
then our marriage...

1026
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,400
will be just as good
as sealed in heaven.

1027
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:03,080
Operator, give me
the police office, please.

1028
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,480
County headquarters.

1029
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,750
Phase Three, Raymond.
Phase Three.

1030
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:11,820
Hello. l'd like to report
a lewd and disorderly party.

1031
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,420
No. l'm a neighbor,
and it's making me sick.

1032
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,720
The sight of such perverts...

1033
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,920
guzzling wine and taking dope
right out in the open.

1034
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,430
Tell them where it is.

1035
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,490
lt's on Fillpot Road,
first driveway on the left.

1036
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,000
Walk up into the woods...

1037
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,100
and it's taking place
in a trailer.

1038
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,000
Yes, l believe a woman
does live there...

1039
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,100
if you can call her a woman.

1040
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,300
She is a whore, Officer.

1041
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,900
Well, l feel, when l see
these things going on...

1042
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,440
that it's my duty
to report them.

1043
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,330
Even with the hectic events
of the day...

1044
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:08,200
Raymond Marble still finds time
to satisfy his perverted urges.

1045
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,900
Watch as he
not only commits another act...

1046
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,490
of indecent exposure...

1047
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:15,340
but adds
to this social horror...

1048
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:17,570
by making his wife
wait in the car.

1049
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,980
ls there no shame?!

1050
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,020
That is not the only shock...

1051
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:19,470
you have before you,
Raymond Marble...

1052
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,730
because at this exact moment...

1053
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:24,400
Divine has learned
of your jealous scheme...

1054
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,640
from the local town gossip.

1055
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:31,450
She also has your address,
asshole!

1056
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,750
Connie! Raymond!

1057
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:38,980
They're probably
hiding their asses.

1058
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:42,020
lt'd be a prudent move
on their part if they were...

1059
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,290
but l could smell them
if they were here.

1060
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,460
Come on, let's go upstairs.

1061
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:50,760
Connie, you have company.

1062
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,240
We got something here for you.

1063
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:56,900
Their bedroom.

1064
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,770
Their fuck chamber itself.

1065
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:00,710
This is where
they mate, Crackers...

1066
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,710
right here on this very bed.

1067
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,150
This is where they touch...

1068
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,710
their uninspired
little organs together...

1069
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,220
vainly trying to recharge...

1070
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,450
their worn-out battery
of filthiness...

1071
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:12,720
thrashing and moaning
in the still of the night.

1072
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,920
What kind of shit
turns them on, Mama?

1073
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,790
What do they do in here?

1074
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:19,560
All sorts of
disgusting positions...

1075
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,860
l would imagine, Crackers.

1076
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,700
Connie probably takes Raymond's
little peanut of a cock...

1077
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,230
between her brittle,
chapped lips...

1078
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:27,300
and then scrapes
her ugly, decayed teeth...

1079
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:28,400
up and down on it...

1080
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,740
while asshole Raymond
thinks he's getting...

1081
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,540
the best head
on the East Coast.

1082
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,740
Then they probably sit here...

1083
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,750
and stare at each other's
blue and red hair...

1084
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,750
while they goose each other
and say dirty words.

1085
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:40,620
Get everything real good, honey.

1086
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:15,910
Get this couch real good.

1087
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,520
They probably sit here
and say all sorts...

1088
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,990
of banal things to one another.

1089
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:22,720
Why, they may have
even decided...

1090
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,130
to send us that turd
on this very sofa.

1091
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,650
l'm getting it on, Mama.
Don't you worry.

1092
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,670
They think they're filthy.

1093
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,930
We'll just see what
the furniture thinks.

1094
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,370
Right, Mama? Am l right?

1095
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:34,770
Yes, Crackers, yes.

1096
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,270
Don't miss anything.

1097
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:37,970
Should l shit
on the floor, Mama?

1098
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:39,140
Right here in the living room?

1099
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,640
No, Crackers, no.

1100
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,150
Don't do anything yet.

1101
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,310
Just get your saliva glands
going.

1102
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:47,440
Real good.

1103
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,750
Juicy.

1104
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,750
But is it enough, Mama?

1105
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,260
Will it be enough?

1106
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,390
Shouldn't we do something
a little filthier...

1107
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:03,700
a little heavier?

1108
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,200
Just to be sure.

1109
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,200
Oh, we still have
other rooms to go.

1110
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,900
The dining room !

1111
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,010
This is where they eat,
Crackers.

1112
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,210
This is where they shove dirty
little portions of bacteria...

1113
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,720
down their weasely
little throats.

1114
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,720
This is where they spread
germs, disease, and infection...

1115
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,060
gobbling obscene fruits
and vegetables...

1116
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,220
all in the name of health.

1117
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:33,060
How disgusting!

1118
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,160
Get this table soaking wet.

1119
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:42,310
Oh, Mama, Mama,
this is gonna work.

1120
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,860
Our divinity will show through.

1121
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:46,430
lt'll show through
all the bullshit...

1122
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,810
crammed in this little dwelling.

1123
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:52,940
The house will react, Mama.
lt's gonna react real good.

1124
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:58,080
Oh, Crackers.
Oh, Crackers, my baby Crackers.

1125
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,820
No house can stand
the two of our venom.

1126
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:00,980
My saliva--

1127
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,650
Oh, Crackers, it will work.

1128
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,250
Without you,
it wouldn't have been enough.

1129
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,560
Oh, my only son, Crackers.

1130
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,710
Oh, Mama, Mama.

1131
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:16,900
l just thank God above...

1132
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,640
l was lucky enough
to be the soul...

1133
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,170
that was placed in my body...

1134
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,240
the body of Divine's son...

1135
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,410
the body and blood...

1136
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:25,510
of another generation
of divinity.

1137
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:28,850
Oh, Crackers!
My only baby, Crackers...

1138
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,860
my own flesh and blood...

1139
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:33,690
my own heritage, my own genes.

1140
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:36,960
Oh, Crackers, let Mama
receive you like communion.

1141
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,860
Let Mama make a gift to you...

1142
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,520
a gift that only
a mother can make...

1143
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:42,030
a gift so special...

1144
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:44,560
it will curse this house
for years after we're gone.

1145
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,900
Oh, Crackers, a gift
of supreme motherhood...

1146
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,000
a gift of divinity!

1147
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:56,240
Oh, Mama,
l want to accept your gift.

1148
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:00,240
Oh, Mama, accept it
as a loving son should, Mama.

1149
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:04,310
Oh, Mama,
a son that would kill for you...

1150
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,720
steal for you...

1151
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,380
even die for you, Mama.

1152
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:10,020
l accept your gift.

1153
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:12,090
l accept it as a loving son
should, Mama.

1154
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,900
Yes, Mama, l'm yours,
completely yours.

1155
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:18,460
Oh, Crackers,
prepare to receive...

1156
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,100
the most divine gift
a mother can give.

1157
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,370
This will clinch it.

1158
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:30,250
This will ruin
this house forever.

1159
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,180
That's it. That's it.

1160
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:35,310
Do my balls, Mama!

1161
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:36,750
That's it!

1162
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:39,380
Farther, farther down!

1163
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:43,590
You're the best, the best ever!

1164
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:46,650
l should have known
you'd be better than anyone.

1165
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,130
Oh, Crackers!
Somebody else is in here.

1166
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,640
But, Mama! Mama!

1167
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,080
-Oh, quit that!
-God damn it, Mama!

1168
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,740
Zip your pants up!
Somebody else is in the house!

1169
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,040
God damn it!

1170
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,420
This place ought to
go up like a tinderbox.

1171
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,620
Let's spread it everywhere.

1172
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:17,320
God, l love the smell
of gasoline, Raymond.

1173
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,020
We are the filthiest
people alive.

1174
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,190
As we have always been, Connie.

1175
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:25,030
Oh, revenge, sweet revenge.

1176
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:27,500
l wonder how that
fat cow likes prison.

1177
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,700
Probably couldn't fit the sow
into a cell with anybody else.

1178
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:33,140
l wonder how her
party guests like her now.

1179
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:37,310
l wonder how--
if she had a happy birthday.

1180
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,680
Let's hurry up
and get out of here.

1181
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,210
You know how fire
makes me nervous.

1182
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,150
Nonsense, Raymond.
Fire is beautiful...

1183
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:46,780
licking and scorching
everything it touches.

1184
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:48,790
Get some more on here.

1185
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,760
Get their bedrooms good.

1186
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,260
Who else is in this house?

1187
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,890
Where is everyone else hiding?

1188
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:56,560
Just the girls.
Please don't hurt me.

1189
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,590
l won't call the police.

1190
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,230
You're goddamn right you won't.

1191
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:00,860
Now where are Connie
and Raymond Marble?

1192
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,400
They're out.
l swear they went out.

1193
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,870
Just the girls are here.
Just the girls in the cellar.

1194
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,040
What girls?

1195
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,380
The girls they keep
locked up in the cellar.

1196
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:10,880
Please let me go.
Just let me out of this house.

1197
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,250
You can do anything you like.

1198
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,550
Just please let me out
of this house.

1199
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,110
When will the Marbles be back?
Tell us!

1200
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:18,450
l don't know.
l swear l don't know.

1201
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,510
They locked me in here
this morning.

1202
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,030
They fired me.

1203
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:23,530
Just let me out of this house.

1204
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,390
Please, just let me
out of this house.

1205
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,730
Come on. We'll go see
about these girls...

1206
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,100
you keep talking about.

1207
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,100
Oh, please help us.

1208
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,230
Oh, please.

1209
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:38,640
What is this?

1210
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,110
Oh, please, please help us.

1211
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:42,410
Call the police.

1212
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:43,570
Contact my parents.

1213
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:46,410
Please take this note.
The address is on the back.

1214
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,420
What's happened?
Please, tell us what's happened.

1215
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,550
Where are Connie
and Raymond Marble?

1216
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:51,710
What is this shit?

1217
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,880
How could l know?

1218
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,690
l've been locked up here.

1219
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:56,920
l never saw them except
for the day they kidnapped me.

1220
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,990
We never see them,
only Channing.

1221
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:01,760
Please help us to escape.

1222
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,200
l'll repay you, whoever you are.

1223
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:07,070
l beg of you to free
Linda and l from here.

1224
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:09,230
Please, so l can
have an abortion...

1225
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:10,800
before it's too late.

1226
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,710
lf you free us,
we will do anything.

1227
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,740
Did the Marbles
lock you down here?

1228
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,040
Did they do this to you?

1229
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,380
Yes. l've been
down here for months...

1230
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:22,480
endless, horror-filled
months in this damn pit...

1231
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,080
chained like
a starving animal...

1232
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,520
only hoping
that l would be killed...

1233
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,550
rather than continue
living like this.

1234
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:32,030
You never see the Marbles?
Never?

1235
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,760
No. Only Chan...

1236
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,930
this repulsive pervert
you have tied up.

1237
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:40,730
Please, he raped us both
so we'd become pregnant.

1238
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:43,240
The Marbles just sit up there...

1239
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:45,300
waiting for us
to die in childbirth...

1240
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:47,330
and then they sell
the poor babies.

1241
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,740
lt's been a nightmare.

1242
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:52,440
lf you don't free us,
we will die and rot in this pit.

1243
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,210
They have no mercy.

1244
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,340
Free them, Crackers.

1245
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:56,850
l'll hold him.

1246
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:58,580
Chan's got the key
in his pocket.

1247
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,920
No! Let me go!
l didn't do anything.

1248
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,430
Shut up, you filthy bastard.

1249
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:06,230
Miss Lady, whoever you are,
don't let him go. Please.

1250
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,730
He is our keeper.

1251
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:11,460
He has beaten me many times
and caused me untold misery.

1252
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,800
He's one of them !
Don't let him go!

1253
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,860
He works for the Marbles.

1254
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,700
No. l was only doing my job.

1255
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,730
l have no malice
toward either of you.

1256
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,240
There you go, honey.

1257
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,540
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1258
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,240
Oh, God, l can go home again.

1259
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,270
Keep him tied.

1260
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,050
There you go, missy,
free as a bird.

1261
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:32,390
Thank you so very much.

1262
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,150
Could we chain him?

1263
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:36,160
Do whatever you like.

1264
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,790
You can even kill him
if you want to.

1265
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:41,390
Either you do it, or we will,
whichever you prefer.

1266
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:43,420
Oh, let us!

1267
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:49,800
Well, Chan,
the tables turn, don't they?

1268
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,540
No, please, Suzie,
l couldn't free you.

1269
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:54,980
l was only doing my job.
Have mercy on me!

1270
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:56,740
Bullshit, Chan!

1271
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,310
You could've freed us.

1272
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:59,750
Why didn't you help us escape...

1273
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,650
if you felt
no malice towards us?

1274
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:02,810
Bullshit!

1275
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:05,050
You kept us locked up
like slaves, bastard...

1276
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,610
and you're gonna pay for it.

1277
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:10,120
l'm gonna cut that big
fat worm right off you.

1278
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,750
God, not that!

1279
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,660
Hey, jerk off
just one more time, stud...

1280
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,190
just one more time.

1281
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,230
Hold him.

1282
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,760
There. l've got it.

1283
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:21,930
Cut it!

1284
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:34,680
Light it, my darling.

1285
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,820
We are the filthiest people
alive.

1286
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:41,790
Fire, fire, burn it down.

1287
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:44,260
Fire, fire, to the ground.

1288
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:49,930
Burn, you fucker!

1289
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:51,630
Burn!

1290
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:52,760
Let's hurry up
and get out of here...

1291
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,200
before someone sees the smoke.

1292
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,570
The smoke, Connie. lt's done.

1293
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:58,700
The battle of filth
has been won.

1294
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:01,210
We are the filthiest people
alive!

1295
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:03,210
Run, Connie, run!

1296
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:09,220
The filthiest!

1297
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:06,330
Those goddamn Marbles.

1298
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,470
We'll take care of 'em, Mama.

1299
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:08,500
We'll get those assholes later.

1300
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,010
Mama, look, there's smoke!

1301
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:11,170
Oh, my God!

1302
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,340
Oh, the trailer!

1303
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,110
Oh, no!

1304
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:20,590
My gorgeous hideaway!

1305
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,360
Oh, my God!

1306
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,190
And Franklin's
theatrical wardrobe!

1307
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:30,700
They did it.
Them fucking Marbles did it.

1308
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:34,800
Bag the Marbles!

1309
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,360
A press conference!

1310
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,880
Back to the Marbles
and seize those fuckers.

1311
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:40,470
l'll kill them !

1312
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:42,540
At last it is over, Raymond.

1313
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:45,630
The battle of filth
has been won.

1314
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,940
This calls for a celebration.

1315
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,380
lt certainly does,
a victory celebration.

1316
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:53,140
Oh, Jesus!
God, l love you, Raymond.

1317
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,950
Are you happy with
our filthiness, my darling?

1318
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:58,850
Are you glad that your wife
is here beside you...

1319
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:01,950
sharing with you
this bond of filth?

1320
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:04,480
This has been the most important
day of my life, Connie.

1321
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,000
Filthiness is a reality.

1322
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:08,290
After all these years
of nagging uncertainty...

1323
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:12,000
l know now that we are indeed
the filthiest couple alive.

1324
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:21,700
Come to me, my darling.

1325
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,240
Come receive
what was promised you...

1326
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,310
in the holy vows of matrimony.

1327
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:31,750
l am yours, Raymond, all yours,
my beautiful darling.

1328
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,680
Connie, are you all right?

1329
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:37,350
What happened, Raymond?
What happened?

1330
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,690
The couch, it rejected you.

1331
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:41,860
Something's wrong, Raymond.
Something's terribly wrong.

1332
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,030
Well, it's just out of order.

1333
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:44,190
You're all right, honey.
Get up.

1334
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,530
l'm afraid to, honey.

1335
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,800
How can a couch be out of order?

1336
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,400
Something just went wrong
with it, honey.

1337
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,740
You're all right.
See, this chair is OK.

1338
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,140
lt's all right.

1339
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,940
But that couch threw me,
Raymond.

1340
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,040
Nothing can be the matter
with that couch.

1341
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,240
We just got it.

1342
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:03,650
l'm all right, honey.
l'm not hurt.

1343
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:06,160
Something is the matter
with this house.

1344
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:07,750
Channing must have
done something.

1345
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:08,760
He ought to know something.

1346
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:10,560
We'll beat it out of him.

1347
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,960
He's gone, honey.
Channing has escaped.

1348
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,940
How could he have escaped?

1349
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:21,440
Raymond, check the pit.

1350
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:22,910
He may have let the girls go.

1351
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,070
They'll call the police,
Connie! The police!

1352
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:28,610
Oh, my God! The police!

1353
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:37,590
He's been castrated!

1354
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,920
His penis is gone!

1355
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,760
The girls have escaped!
The girls have escaped!

1356
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,260
They'll call the police!

1357
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,560
Hurry. Let's get out of here.

1358
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:49,600
Raymond, l'm afraid!

1359
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:51,430
Hurry, Connie. Hurry.

1360
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,840
Connie and Raymond Marble.

1361
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,240
Stop it!

1362
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,140
You're gonna get it good, bitch!

1363
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:10,820
Well, well, well.

1364
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,690
Connie and Raymond Marble.

1365
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,160
l've been looking forward
to meeting you.

1366
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:17,060
lt's a real pleasure.

1367
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:19,790
And you're even bigger assholes
than l imagined.

1368
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:21,800
You burned my house down.

1369
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:25,290
No, please. Who are you?
We don't know you.

1370
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,170
You know who l am, bitch!

1371
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,830
l'm the filthiest person alive.
That's who l am.

1372
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:31,360
No, please,
you must be mistaken.

1373
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:34,000
Our name is Waldo,
Harry and Jean Waldo.

1374
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,010
Shut up! Just shut up!

1375
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,380
Gag him before l kill him !

1376
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:42,120
Wait for the newsmen, Ma.
Wait for the newsmen.

1377
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,780
Wait till they get here.

1378
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,120
That ought to shut him up.

1379
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,560
Hey, Raymond, you must think
we're awful fucking stupid, huh?

1380
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:51,430
Well, here's a little
something for you.

1381
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,050
Burn down our house, will you?

1382
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,560
Who are you?

1383
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:55,860
You have the wrong people.

1384
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,270
Shut up, Connie. Shut up!

1385
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,700
You know who we are.

1386
01:19:58,740 --> 01:19:59,930
Cut the hogwash.

1387
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:01,130
Save it for the papers.

1388
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,300
You're Connie Marble...

1389
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,860
and you're gonna pay
for being Connie Marble.

1390
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:11,780
And you're going
to pay royally, bitch.

1391
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,280
Let this be a lesson to you...

1392
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,620
just in case
there is reincarnation.

1393
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:18,090
lt's virtually impossible
to be filthier than Divine.

1394
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,560
l didn't get my reputation
for nothing, you know.

1395
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:22,490
But you found out too late,
Connie.

1396
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:23,490
Yeah, it's too late.

1397
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:24,490
'Cause you and shithead here...

1398
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:25,760
aren't going to be
around tomorrow.

1399
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,200
No, you're not
going to be around...

1400
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:29,170
to put your newfound knowledge
to use.

1401
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,960
'Cause you're going
to be dead, Connie.

1402
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,940
Dead! Dead! Dead!

1403
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,440
That's tight, Crackers...

1404
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:36,100
it's so tight
it makes their blood hurt.

1405
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:38,670
Just make sure
they don't make another sound...

1406
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:39,900
because l don't think
l'd be able...

1407
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,910
to control myself
if they made any more noise.

1408
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:44,140
l'd just have to
kill them right now!

1409
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,170
l just won't be able to wait!

1410
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:47,240
l know what you mean, Babs.

1411
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,450
l feel like ripping them apart
myself.

1412
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:51,280
They ain't gonna be doing
much talking, are you?

1413
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,450
Come on, children...

1414
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:54,550
we can't keep
the photographers waiting.

1415
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:55,920
And we're going
to give them a story...

1416
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:56,930
that will knock the ""Newsday""...

1417
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,950
right off its fucking
boring little ass!

1418
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,860
Come on, Connie and Raymond.

1419
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,230
You have a personal appearance
to make.

1420
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,130
John Vader
of the ""Midnight"" here...

1421
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:13,410
looking for Divine
somewhere in Phoenix, Maryland.

1422
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,070
Divine,
you're looking fantastic.

1423
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:18,580
Why, thank you, Mr. Vader.
l'm so glad you could come.

1424
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:20,640
Nat Curzan here
from ""The Tattler.""

1425
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,280
Well, good afternoon,
Mr. Curzan.

1426
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,690
Gentlemen, get ready...

1427
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,380
'cause you're about
to witness the trial...

1428
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:27,910
of these two unfortunates...

1429
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,980
commonly known as Connie
and Raymond Marble.

1430
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:33,900
Their trial will take place
in front of your very eyes...

1431
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,630
and their execution will follow.

1432
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:37,030
We're going to witness
an actual murder?

1433
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,060
A live homicide?

1434
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,370
That is right, gentlemen.

1435
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,300
Goldstein, Larry Goldstein.

1436
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:43,900
Very tempting.

1437
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,710
l have a question for you,
Miss...Cotton.

1438
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,140
ls that correct, Cotton?

1439
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:49,370
Yes, it is.

1440
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:51,140
Are you a willing accomplice...

1441
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,210
to these murders
that are about to take place?

1442
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:56,410
This is not exactly a murder,
Mr. Goldstein.

1443
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:57,920
This is a court,
a kangaroo court...

1444
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,220
as the headlines could scream.

1445
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:03,090
Not a mere murder
as you would call it.

1446
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:05,860
lf we were involved
in merely another murder...

1447
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,120
it could hardly be headlines.

1448
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,360
lt's not just the publicity.

1449
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,270
My mama couldn't go on
with her everyday life...

1450
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,860
with this kind of shit going on.

1451
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:17,070
My mama was not the aggressor
in this little war we had.

1452
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:18,970
She only did
what had to be done.

1453
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:20,910
lt was suicide on their part.

1454
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,040
And, Cotton...

1455
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,980
l notice a smile on your lips.

1456
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:25,040
Does murder make you happy?

1457
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:28,180
Murder merely relieves tension,
Mr. Curzan.

1458
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:31,550
For murder to bring happiness,
one must already be happy...

1459
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:34,890
and l am completely
at peace with myself...

1460
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:36,260
totally happy.

1461
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:39,130
Give me more questions.

1462
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,530
Divine, are you a lesbian?

1463
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,500
Yes. l have done everything.

1464
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:43,830
Does blood turn you on?

1465
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:45,430
lt does more than turn me on,
Mr. Vader.

1466
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:47,230
lt makes me come.

1467
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:50,140
And more than the sight of it,
l love the taste of it.

1468
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:52,870
The taste of hot,
freshly killed blood.

1469
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:55,470
Could you give us some
of your political beliefs?

1470
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:57,210
Kill everyone now.

1471
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,440
Condone first-degree murder.

1472
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,250
Advocate cannibalism, eat shit.

1473
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:03,750
Filth are my politics.

1474
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:04,880
Filth is my life.

1475
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,580
Take whatever you like.

1476
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:11,220
How's this for a center spread?

1477
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,820
-Jesus.
-Christ Almighty!

1478
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:17,030
OK, Divine,
where will you go now?

1479
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:18,930
l'm sure you're aware
that after the execution...

1480
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:21,130
you will be the subject
of an extensive search.

1481
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:22,260
To another city...

1482
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:24,210
to set up headquarters
once again.

1483
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,370
Of course...

1484
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:27,270
l cannot reveal to you
the exact location.

1485
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:29,970
Patience, Mr. Vader, patience.

1486
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,710
Another time, another story.

1487
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,940
And now for the trial.

1488
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:34,950
You sit here.

1489
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:35,950
Back here?

1490
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:37,150
Sit down.

1491
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:39,920
No pictures during the trial,
please.

1492
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,120
This is a court of law.

1493
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:44,360
l call to the stand
Miss Cotton.

1494
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:51,460
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth...

1495
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,370
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

1496
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,370
l do.

1497
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,400
Who burned down our trailer?

1498
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,170
Connie and Raymond Marble.

1499
01:23:58,210 --> 01:23:59,800
Can you point them out
in this court?

1500
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,070
There they are right there.
The ones that are tied up.

1501
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:05,080
Who sent me a turd in the mail?

1502
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,110
Connie and Raymond Marble.

1503
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:08,350
That is all.

1504
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:09,980
ls there any cross-examination?

1505
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,490
No cross-examination?
Very well.

1506
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:15,820
You may step down.

1507
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:18,560
l call to the stand Crackers.

1508
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,860
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth...

1509
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,530
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

1510
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,330
Sure, Mama. l wouldn't shit you.

1511
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:27,060
How did Connie and Raymond
find out where we live?

1512
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,200
They hired a spy.

1513
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,970
How did this spy
get her information?

1514
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:31,980
By nosing around,
asking a lot of questions...

1515
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:33,700
and by fucking me.
That's how she got it.

1516
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:37,040
That dirty little scag.

1517
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,210
Thank you.

1518
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:40,580
ls there any cross-examination?

1519
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:46,650
No? A very strange defense,
l must say.

1520
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:48,520
You may step down.

1521
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,390
Gentlemen,
the verdict is guilty...

1522
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:55,400
on all ten counts
of first-degree stupidity.

1523
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,700
The penalty phase
will now begin.

1524
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:59,930
l call Cotton to the stand.

1525
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:05,710
Your oath still remains.

1526
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,140
l presume you understand this?

1527
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:08,140
Naturally.

1528
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:09,300
ln your opinion...

1529
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:11,680
what should the penalty
in this case be?

1530
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,680
Death.

1531
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,340
That is all.

1532
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,940
You may step down.

1533
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:18,420
l call Crackers to the stand.

1534
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:24,950
You realize
you are still under oath?

1535
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,360
Of course.

1536
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,490
ln your opinion...

1537
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:28,900
should these people
be allowed to live?

1538
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:29,960
No.

1539
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:31,630
Thank you.

1540
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:35,100
Gentlemen of the press,
the verdict is death.

1541
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:38,300
But first, due to the magnitude
of these capital crimes...

1542
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,070
these two people
must be humiliated...

1543
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:41,480
in front of the media.

1544
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:44,570
Use these pictures, gentlemen,
and use them wisely.

1545
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,110
We have an example to set.

1546
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:48,120
Let the good people
of this country know...

1547
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:50,680
that they cannot fuck with
Divine and get away with it.

1548
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,160
Let them know that we are indeed
the filthiest people alive.

1549
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,160
Mr. Vader.

1550
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:56,960
Yes, Divine, do you think...

1551
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,830
that there are other
filthy people in the world?

1552
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,490
l mean, is it now a cult?

1553
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:03,430
lt is a very minor cult
right now, Mr. Vader...

1554
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:05,460
but one that is
growing and growing.

1555
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,470
Growing faster
than you could imagine.

1556
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,670
l will be queen one day...

1557
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:10,800
and my coronation...

1558
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,040
will be celebrated
all over the world.

1559
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:17,340
Do not forget--l am Divine.

1560
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,680
What a day for an execution.

1561
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,280
Off the record, Mama,
do we stab them or shoot them?

1562
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,950
Shoot, Crackers, shoot.

1563
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:25,320
No mess for the ""Midnight.""

1564
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,450
Don't forget ""The Tattler.""

1565
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:28,080
And ""The Tattler,"" honey.

1566
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:29,590
And ""The Confidential.""

1567
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,920
How could l ever forget
""The Confidential""?

1568
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:38,000
Come on, gentlemen.
Come this way.

1569
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,000
Come on.

1570
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,440
Help me with this tar.

1571
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:41,800
OK, Miss Cotton.

1572
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,400
Here, hold this.

1573
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:53,670
Burn my mama's house down,
will you?

1574
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,680
You goddamn worm.

1575
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,120
Fucking piece of lousy shit!

1576
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:01,390
And now for the feathers.

1577
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:03,830
Only we're not going
to run you out of town.

1578
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,730
We're going to kill you.

1579
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,630
Kill, kill, kill.

1580
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,930
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

1581
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:11,090
Questions and answers!

1582
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,290
Do you believe in God?

1583
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:14,460
l am God.

1584
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,970
You are God.

1585
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,000
You are God.

1586
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,740
ls there no wrong?

1587
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:23,040
There is right,
and there is wrong.

1588
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:26,240
l have never been wrong,
Mr. Goldstein.

1589
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,150
Do you expect to get new
followers with this publicity?

1590
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:31,650
l certainly hope so, Mr. Curzan.

1591
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:34,020
l didn't invite you here
to jerk off, you know.

1592
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:37,150
Get this all down.
Don't miss one single word.

1593
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:38,290
Suppose we decide...

1594
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:40,590
not to print this story,
Miss Divine. What then?

1595
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:44,260
Mr. Vader, see them?

1596
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,860
Does that answer your question?

1597
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:50,130
l have your address, and l know
you have a wife and child.

1598
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:52,200
ls that correct?

1599
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:53,710
Well, if nothing is printed...

1600
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,740
we might be in the mood
for a barbecue.

1601
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:59,870
Get what l mean?
A human barbecue.

1602
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,580
End of
question-and-answer period.

1603
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,520
Proceed with the execution.

1604
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:09,020
They are finished,
and a lovely couple they are.

1605
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,360
Aren't they?

1606
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:12,560
Gentlemen of the press,
get ready...

1607
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,830
'cause you are
about to witness...

1608
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:16,330
the biggest news event
of the year.

1609
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:18,600
Live homicide.

1610
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,860
Connie and Raymond Marble...

1611
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:24,270
you have breathed
your last breath.

1612
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:27,570
You have sighed your last sigh.

1613
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:30,580
You are no longer alive.

1614
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,120
Connie Marble...

1615
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,180
you stand convicted
of asshole-ism.

1616
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:44,660
The proper punishment
will now take place.

1617
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:47,750
Look pretty for the picture,
Connie.

1618
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,430
That's it.

1619
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:56,560
No further questions.
No further pictures.

1620
01:28:56,610 --> 01:28:58,370
l have spoken.

1621
01:28:58,410 --> 01:28:59,380
Thanks for the scoop, Divine.

1622
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:00,970
Next month's sales
should be booming.

1623
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:02,440
Thank you for coming.

1624
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,380
Do keep in touch.

1625
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:04,680
l will, Mr. Vader.

1626
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:05,770
Always know where l am.

1627
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:07,780
Thank you for coming.

1628
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:10,080
Always count on her for a story,
l'll tell you that.

1629
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,550
She always was
a news-conscious woman.

1630
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:12,950
The only problem is,
l don't know...

1631
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:15,420
we've been trying to get
'"Midnight"" in supermarkets...

1632
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:18,160
and it is a hot story,
all right, but it's so squalid.

1633
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,750
Well, ""The Tattler""
will be in the supermarkets.

1634
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,350
You can bet on that.

1635
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:25,060
The time has come
for flight, my children.

1636
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,730
Where to, Mama? Where to?

1637
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:28,430
Let's move to Boise.

1638
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:30,370
l always wanted to go there.

1639
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:31,370
Boise, Cotton?

1640
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:33,840
Why, that might not
be a bad place.

1641
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,040
Were you ever there, Cotton?

1642
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,140
Only once.

1643
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:37,980
We robbed a transit bus there.
Remember?

1644
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:40,920
l remember. The number 42.

1645
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:44,250
Let's sleep in gas station
lavatories this time, Mama.

1646
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:45,750
Fuck permanent residences.

1647
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:47,420
lt'll strengthen our filthiness.

1648
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,520
Oh, Crackers,
that's a wonderful idea.

1649
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,390
Gas station lavatories.

1650
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:54,330
What do you say, Babs?
Let's move to Boise.

1651
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,830
lf that's what you want,
my children...

1652
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:58,200
then that's what you'll get.

1653
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:01,500
Boise, ldaho, here we come.

1654
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:04,370
l hope Boise's ready
for some star residents.

1655
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:07,140
Why, l'll have to change
my appearance.

1656
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:08,910
l think l'll dye my hair
another color...

1657
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:10,340
and start dressing like a dyke.

1658
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,970
Me, too. l'll get a crewcut.

1659
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,710
Maybe it's about time
l started dying my hair, too.

1660
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,380
What color do you want, honey?

1661
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:18,110
l'm going to make mine
hot pink...

1662
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:20,920
with a D.A.
with Elvis Presley sideburns.

1663
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,290
Maybe blond, Mama.

1664
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:23,690
Do you think
l'd look good as a blond?

1665
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:26,360
Do you think
it would enhance my filthiness?

1666
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,560
Oh, Crackers,
you should dye your hair.

1667
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,530
lt would make you look
much filthier.

1668
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:32,630
Won't it be fun?

1669
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:35,730
l'll have a crewcut,
you'll have a pink D.A...

1670
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:37,760
and Crackers
will have blond hair...

1671
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:40,110
all in Boise, ldaho.

1672
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:41,670
Then it's settled.

1673
01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:44,270
Boise, ldaho, get ready.

1674
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:46,510
You are about to receive
some migrants...

1675
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:48,180
of a very special nature...

1676
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:50,910
a nature
that defies description.

1677
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:53,550
You are about to receive
into your community...

1678
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:56,390
the filthiest people alive.

1679
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:59,030
The filthiest people alive?

1680
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:02,550
Well, you think
you know somebody filthier?

1681
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:06,500
Watch as Divine proves
that not only is she...

1682
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:07,940
the filthiest person
in the world...

1683
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:12,070
she is also the filthiest
actress in the world.

1684
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:17,010
What you are about to see
is a real thing.

1685
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:18,600
Hello. l'm John Waters.

1686
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,740
l hope you enjoyed my film,
""Pink Flamingos.""

1687
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:22,010
l'd like to show you
some scenes...

1688
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:23,310
that were cut from the movie...

1689
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:25,580
footage l recently
discovered in my attic.

1690
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:28,350
Good morning, Cotton.

1691
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:30,440
Good morning, Babs.

1692
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:31,920
Did you sleep well?

1693
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,420
lt was chilly last night.

1694
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:36,120
Oh, Cotton,
l slept unbelievably well.

1695
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:39,390
This country air really does
something to you, doesn't it?

1696
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:43,020
Why, l had dreams last night
that made me feel young again.

1697
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,530
ln the original script...

1698
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:46,690
Divine was supposed to be
writing her memoirs...

1699
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:48,430
as she hid out in her trailer.

1700
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:53,140
""Being Divine.""
Chapter three, June, 1965.

1701
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:55,270
lt was about this time
in my career...

1702
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:57,840
that l realized l was
capable of being perfect...

1703
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,680
perfect in every aspect
of human development.

1704
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:04,240
Of course, Connie Marble
was also hard at work...

1705
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:05,550
and in the first cut
of the film...

1706
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:08,650
life was even worse
for poor Channing the butler.

1707
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:10,320
You know l hate fucking them.

1708
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,350
l have to deliver the babies,
bury the bodies...

1709
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,260
help kidnap them.

1710
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,320
Why do l have to
get them pregnant, too?

1711
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:18,530
Why? You said
you'd get somebody else...

1712
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:20,330
to do it this time.

1713
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:21,500
l changed my mind.

1714
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:23,010
So just go get ready.

1715
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,510
Give Susan some pills...

1716
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:26,270
get the body
out of the basement...

1717
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:29,210
and mentally prepare yourself
for this evening.

1718
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:31,580
What's a little fuck, Chan?

1719
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:32,580
lf it doesn't turn you on...

1720
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:34,640
just jerk off
and then stick it in her.

1721
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,410
That way, you only have to be
connected for a few seconds.

1722
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:39,350
l don't really care
if either of you...

1723
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:40,410
get any pleasure out of it.

1724
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:42,050
Just get her pregnant, Chan.

1725
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:43,530
That's all that matters.

1726
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,360
A little baby
beginning to grow...

1727
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:50,830
from one little fuck
to $5,000 in nine months.

1728
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:51,130
Maybe it was Connie's
marital problems...

1729
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,700
that made her so irritable.

1730
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:57,830
Where's Raymond? Where is he?

1731
01:33:57,870 --> 01:34:00,640
How could he leave me alone
with these servants...

1732
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:03,110
these stupid asshole servants?

1733
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,910
Animal rights activists
always say to me...

1734
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:08,080
""How could you kill
a chicken for a movie?""

1735
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:09,590
Well, l eat chicken...

1736
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:10,640
and l know the chicken
didn't land on my plate...

1737
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:11,810
from a heart attack.

1738
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,020
We bought the chicken...

1739
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:15,720
from a farmer who advertised
freshly killed chicken.

1740
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,850
l think we made
the chicken's life better.

1741
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:20,120
Got to be in a movie,
got fucked.

1742
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,720
And then right after filming
the next take...

1743
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:23,060
the cast ate the chicken.

1744
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:27,000
Oh, good morning, honey.

1745
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,940
lsn't it a beauty today?

1746
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:30,910
Shit, yeah.
You cooking eggs for Edie?

1747
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:33,840
l want to fry me up this chicken
when you're through.

1748
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,470
Sure, honey.
lt'll only take me a minute.

1749
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:37,450
Why don't you sit down there
and keep mother company?

1750
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,510
Did you have a good time
last night?

1751
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:41,920
Yeah. lt's weird
being back in Baltimore.

1752
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:45,010
Went down Broadway last night
and saw a lot of old friends.

1753
01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:48,680
You remember Patty Hitler?
l saw her.

1754
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:51,190
She almost shit
when she heard you were in town.

1755
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:52,350
She gave me this to show you.

1756
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,520
What is it, honey?

1757
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,860
The ""Midnight,"" Mama.

1758
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:56,130
You made the cover
of the ""Midnight.""

1759
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:57,630
'"Filthiest Person Alive,""
they call you.

1760
01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:59,230
Ain't that a gas?

1761
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:02,640
My original ad copy
for ""Pink Flamingos"" read...

1762
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:05,730
'"The filthiest people alive--
their loves, their hates...

1763
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:08,370
'"and their unquenchable
thirst for notoriety.""

1764
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:11,810
Oh, Crackers,
this copy's hysterical.

1765
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:13,320
lt's mostly from
the press releases...

1766
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:14,610
l sent the wire services.

1767
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:16,680
More fame, Mama, more fame.

1768
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:19,810
Once the film was released,
some people in the audience...

1769
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:21,880
actually believed Divine
was wanted for murder.

1770
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:25,490
Oh, my God!
What a horrible photograph.

1771
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:29,590
My first ""Wanted"" poster,
and l have to look just awful.

1772
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:32,000
l can't imagine l had Divine
say his real name...

1773
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,470
in the following take.

1774
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:37,000
Luckily, my hair isn't this
harsh black color anymore.

1775
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,800
And look at some of my aliases
they have down there.

1776
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,940
Glen Milstead?

1777
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:45,440
Why, l only used that one
on one day of hanging paper.

1778
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:49,280
And look. They've even got
The Hog Princess down here.

1779
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:51,150
Edith Massey
sometimes had trouble...

1780
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:53,160
remembering long monologues...

1781
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:55,710
but she had a screen presence
all her own.

1782
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:58,020
Freddy, l want you
to meet Joanne.

1783
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:00,190
Joanne, this is Freddy.

1784
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:02,530
l know you'll like each other.

1785
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:05,330
And l don't care
what people say.

1786
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:08,700
And, Joanne,
l know you're hard-boiled...

1787
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:11,710
but Freddy doesn't think
you're tough or cheap.

1788
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:14,010
He respects you.
Don't you, Freddy?

1789
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,570
We didn't have any money
in the budget for catering...

1790
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:18,170
so Edie was quite happy
to get to eat...

1791
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:19,180
in the following take.

1792
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:22,150
Be careful.
l'm going to eat you.

1793
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:24,120
Edie's getting mighty hungry.

1794
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:29,460
Oh, don't worry, Freddy.
l have some more for you.

1795
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:37,330
l have Rhonda, Donna,
Sherry, and Little Yeller.

1796
01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:40,370
ln the original script,
Raymond and Connie Marble...

1797
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:43,500
also raided Divine's trailer
much earlier in the story.

1798
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:46,130
Does Divine really
live like this...

1799
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:48,670
out here in the country
like a hillbilly?

1800
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:51,740
God, with all these
disgusting trees...

1801
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:53,110
and shrubbery and wildlife...

1802
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:55,170
l'd be scared
to sleep at night...

1803
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:57,780
knowing possums
and raccoon and deer...

1804
01:36:57,820 --> 01:36:59,690
and God knows
what other creatures...

1805
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,810
would be lurking outside...

1806
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,690
fucking and shitting
right out in the open.

1807
01:37:02,730 --> 01:37:05,250
l do love their nature dialog.

1808
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:07,630
Ooh, God! Did you hear that?

1809
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,290
Horrid little bird.

1810
01:37:09,330 --> 01:37:11,660
Just asking for it, l guess.

1811
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:14,360
Humans never realize
the dirty little lives...

1812
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,960
these animals lead
out in the country.

1813
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:17,500
Makes me sick, that's all.

1814
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,200
lt was freezing cold...

1815
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:22,180
the day we filmed
poor Edie's egg humiliation.

1816
01:37:22,210 --> 01:37:24,480
Look at her!

1817
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:27,420
Well, Miss Egg Baby...

1818
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:30,080
we've got some eggs
here for you.

1819
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,090
How do you like them this way?

1820
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,820
Oh, and l've got another
little surprise for you.

1821
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:49,330
There. Little baby doll.
All grown up.

1822
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:50,770
Charles Baker would shit.

1823
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:52,170
Shut up!

1824
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:55,410
The real way Divine discovered
the Marbles did it?

1825
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:59,510
A character cut from the film--
vicious gossip Patty Hitler.

1826
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:02,610
Remember Big Jimmy
from down Pratt Street?

1827
01:38:02,650 --> 01:38:04,180
Big asshole
finally turned queer.

1828
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:06,880
And that wife of his, all she
does is sit around, drink...

1829
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,450
neglect those awful kids.

1830
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:09,620
Terrible.

1831
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:11,460
One of them's retarded.
Such a shame.

1832
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:13,660
And you remember Karen
what's-her-name from the bar?

1833
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:14,890
She's dead, honey.

1834
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:18,460
Life-affirming characters,
that's my specialty.

1835
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,300
l saw her once.
She's an ugly bitch.

1836
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,300
Wears glasses.

1837
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:25,470
And him--what a lulu!
Blue hair.

1838
01:38:25,510 --> 01:38:28,840
You can see the bad continuity
coming up in this scene.

1839
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,680
We forgot to put Edie's
baby bonnet back on her head.

1840
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,250
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

1841
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,550
What's happened to Edie?

1842
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:38,250
l'm afraid
we've had more trouble.

1843
01:38:38,290 --> 01:38:40,150
Some people broke in
while we were gone...

1844
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:41,520
and did this to Mama.

1845
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,320
Broke raw eggs all over her
and dressed her mockingly...

1846
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,880
but l know who did it.

1847
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:48,830
Patty Hitler gave me
all the information we need...

1848
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:50,160
to solve this case.

1849
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:53,000
Two would-be filth balls named
Connie and Raymond Marble...

1850
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,160
are responsible for this deed.

1851
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:57,840
And now for the strangest nudity
l ever filmed.

1852
01:38:57,870 --> 01:39:01,370
l've got to take
a little rest myself.

1853
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:14,320
What's the matter, Cotton?
What's the matter?

1854
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:15,480
They must have done it.

1855
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:17,390
There's boll weevils in my bed.

1856
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:19,760
A big subplot
that was cut from the film...

1857
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,290
was the revenge murder
of Cookie the spy.

1858
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:25,390
Sharpen your blades, Cotton.
We got some cutting to do.

1859
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,960
l'm using a gun on this one.

1860
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,870
l'm not breaking my nails
this time.

1861
01:39:28,910 --> 01:39:30,400
l might need them
for scratching.

1862
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:32,470
Upstairs. That's her room.

1863
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:33,500
She better be awake.

1864
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:35,140
lt's so dull
when they're sleeping.

1865
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:45,950
Where's Cookie?

1866
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:47,820
Cookie? Who are you?

1867
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:49,420
We know she's here.
Where is she?

1868
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:50,860
She's not here. What is it?

1869
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:51,920
Die, bitch!

1870
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:04,860
Rivers of gore!

1871
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:18,110
Oh, God,
you're beautiful, Crackers.

1872
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:20,050
lt's not just Babs
l love anymore.

1873
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:22,110
lt used to be,
but now it's you, too.

1874
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,350
Both of you l love so much.

1875
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:27,290
lt's your mind,
your imagination...

1876
01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:29,200
that filthy mind
with rotten ideas.

1877
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:32,500
And your face--
that beautiful, beautiful face.

1878
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:34,970
You like it, baby?

1879
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,560
My face is yours
to look at...

1880
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:38,300
as long
as you keep looking back.

1881
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:40,140
A lot of people like cunt,
you know.

1882
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:41,580
Men, women.

1883
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,810
But your eyes are like
a cunt to me, honey.

1884
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:45,510
You can look and look
and look...

1885
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:47,450
and still l wake up
wishing you were there...

1886
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:49,420
watching me twenty-four hours
a day.

1887
01:40:49,450 --> 01:40:50,580
Them cunt eyes.

1888
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:53,520
Cunt eyes?
What was l thinking about?

1889
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:56,860
Was your cutting and hacking
successful, my children?

1890
01:40:56,890 --> 01:41:00,160
Oh, Babs, it was a ball
and a half doing it again...

1891
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:02,530
a real feeling
of true liberation.

1892
01:41:02,570 --> 01:41:05,500
Why, Cookie won't be doing
any more spying on anybody else.

1893
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:06,930
You can be sure of that.

1894
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:08,990
She looked like
a piece of raw ham...

1895
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,270
when we got through with her.

1896
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:12,330
And, Babs, here's her ear.

1897
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:14,970
l got the left one.
l hope that's all right.

1898
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:17,540
Either one would have been
quite satisfactory, darling.

1899
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:18,910
Thank you.

1900
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,120
The original curse
on the Marbles...

1901
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:25,020
by Divine and Crackers
was even more complicated.

1902
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,890
What's this pitiful room
supposed to be?

1903
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:30,890
Looks like some kind
of fucking office.

1904
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:33,260
Look. That must be
a picture of her.

1905
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:36,160
That dog has an office.
What the fuck for?

1906
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,060
So she can sit in here
with that ugly red hair...

1907
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,690
and asshole off all day?

1908
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:41,570
Touch everything, Crackers.

1909
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:45,170
Let our divinity and fame
be felt on everything...

1910
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:47,070
in this middle-class dump.

1911
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:49,810
Look how pissy
these turds must be.

1912
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:53,370
Central heating! How repellent!

1913
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:56,280
l'm not even sure
l understand this part.

1914
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,790
Leave your fingerprints
on everything, darling.

1915
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:01,880
Touch and feel.
Rub, touch, and feel.

1916
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,790
Take your shoes off!

1917
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:07,130
Let the rugs know
we're here, too.

1918
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,530
Let the rugs know.

1919
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:09,790
Touch and feel.

1920
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:11,930
But Connie didn't have a clue.

1921
01:42:11,970 --> 01:42:13,700
She was still
ranting and raving...

1922
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:15,730
about catching her butler
in drag.

1923
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:18,640
Oh, God, the thought
of his hairy body...

1924
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:20,670
in some of my fine dresses
and gowns...

1925
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:22,740
will never leave me, Raymond.

1926
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:25,940
To think of the value
of my wardrobe...

1927
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:28,280
and then to think
of his person...

1928
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:32,380
actually defiling all those fine
silks and hand-woven garments.

1929
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:34,980
And my underwear!

1930
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:37,620
His nipples
have actually touched...

1931
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:40,190
where l have rested mine.

1932
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:41,820
But that ain't nothing,
Connie...

1933
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:44,200
not compared to what
you got coming.

1934
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:45,220
Oh, Connie.

1935
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:49,300
Connie, Connie,
with hair, oh, so red.

1936
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:54,610
How do these scissors feel
so near your head?

1937
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:59,300
Watch one of
my favorite scenes...

1938
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:01,080
that ended up
on the cutting room floor.

1939
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,850
Divine, Crackers,
and Cotton sing...

1940
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:05,790
""We Are the Filthiest
People Alive"" in pig Latin.

1941
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:10,880
E-way are-ay e-they
ilthiest-fay

1942
01:43:10,930 --> 01:43:17,330
Eople-pay in-ay e-they
ole-hay ide-way orld-way

1943
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:21,370
l'd like to close
with the original trailer...

1944
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,530
New Line Cinema used
to sell ""Pink Flamingos.""

1945
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:27,630
Notice no footage from
the actual movie is ever shown.

1946
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:33,650
How did you happen
to hear about it?

1947
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:35,210
From some friends who saw it...

1948
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:37,150
and thought it was
absolutely marvelous.

1949
01:43:37,190 --> 01:43:38,850
l'll be very insulted.

1950
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:42,920
Rex Reed told us
that it's fabulous.

1951
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,790
Why'd you come out
at midnight to see it?

1952
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:46,350
Why go home at midnight?

1953
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,730
What are you going to see there?

1954
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:51,060
l guess there are just two kinds
of people, Miss Sandstone...

1955
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:53,860
my kind of people and assholes.

1956
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:58,030
Fantastic.
Third time l've been to it.

1957
01:43:58,070 --> 01:44:00,570
lt's an incredible
head thing for people.

1958
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:01,910
Oh, it's marvelous. Absolutely.

1959
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:04,810
The most disgusting thing
l've ever seen in my whole life.

1960
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:06,210
Not to be believed.

1961
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,650
Absolutely outrageous.

1962
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,880
lt was divine. lt was fabulous.

1963
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,850
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

1964
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,190
lt's absolutely better
than ""Cries and Whispers.""

1965
01:44:22,230 --> 01:44:26,170
l think it's the future
of city living.

1966
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,570
-Out...
-...rageous.

1967
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,230
Fantastic. lt was really fun.

1968
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:34,210
Excellent. Loved it.
Really good.

1969
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:35,370
Really good, right?

1970
01:44:35,410 --> 01:44:36,670
lt was great.

1971
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:37,770
Piece of garbage.

1972
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,750
The only part l didn't like
was the snakes.

1973
01:44:48,790 --> 01:44:50,320
l have an aversion to snakes.

1974
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:51,380
lt was divine.

1975
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:53,020
l love religious movies.

1976
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:55,220
lt was a little gross,
but l liked it.

1977
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:59,460
lt was really the grossest film
l've seen.

1978
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,330
l think John Waters
has got his finger...

1979
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:02,560
on the pulse of America.

1980
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:05,470
l think he's got his thumb
securely up America's ass.

1981
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:07,670
l enjoy dirty things as much
as everyone else does...

1982
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:09,180
but this isn't even dirty.

1983
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:10,700
lt's just disgusting.
