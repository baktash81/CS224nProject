# <i>Now they're planning</i>

2
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,006
# <i>Well what will it be?</i> #

00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:52,910
# <i>Read all about their schemes</i>

00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:58,150
# <i>It's well worth a fee</i> ##

5
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,226
We are living
in a glorious time,

6
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,129
a time of great conflict
to be sure.

7
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,862
<i>Today, a nationwide crackdown</i>
<i>was underway...</i>

8
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,062
<i>... eight men were arrested</i>
<i>from...</i>

9
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,834
<i>... hardcore</i>
<i>pornographic pictures.</i>

10
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,644
On one side of the coin
are those in favor

11
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,338
of absolutely no censorship.

12
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,582
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>there are those who advocate</i>

13
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:29,144
<i>the government dictating to us</i>
<i>what we should see,</i>

14
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,446
<i>read, and hear.</i>

15
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,618
<i>... they say it all started</i>
<i>with the sex film</i> Deep Throat.

16
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,304
I saw <i>Deep Throat</i> in New York

17
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,367
when it first came out.

18
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,752
<i>People were lined up</i>

19
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,946
for at least three blocks.

20
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:07,652
# <i>I was once out strolling</i>
<i>one very hot summer's day</i> #

21
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:11,288
Oh, yeah, there was
a screening in some
psychoanalyst's apartment

22
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,958
and everybody
watched and smoked dope.
Oh, yeah.

23
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,968
# <i>I dreamed I was</i>
<i>in a Hollywood movie</i> #

24
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,996
# <i>That I was the star</i>
<i>of the movie</i> #

25
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,009
# <i>This really blew my mind</i> #

26
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,977
<i>I thought, "Fantastic.</i>

27
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,707
<i>"This is going to change</i>
<i>the climate</i>

28
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:32,343
"of talking about
issues of sexuality

29
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,849
in these United States."

30
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,721
# <i>Spill the wine</i>
<i>and take that pearl</i> ##

31
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,626
<i>I'm one of the handful</i>
<i>of people who never saw it.</i>

32
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,589
I didn't intend to not see it.

33
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,099
Perhaps you could
arrange for me to see it.

34
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,660
Now.

35
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,315
Deep Throat <i>was</i>
<i>an epochal moment</i>

36
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,181
in the history
of modern sexuality.

37
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,483
It is the first time
that respectable
middle-class women

38
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,387
<i>went to porn theaters.</i>

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,284
<i>It really broke down,</i>

40
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,761
<i>uh, traditional codes</i>
<i>of... of decorum.</i>

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,233
<i>Linda Lovelace,</i>

42
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,930
<i>and conversations,</i>
<i>and jokes about</i> Deep Throat,

43
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,869
<i>appeared</i>
<i>on network television.</i>

44
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,941
If the film
became mainstream,

45
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,533
conversation about it
became truly mainstream.

46
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,339
It's kind of
a strange country, isn't it?

47
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,075
Judges can see <i>Deep Throat,</i>
but they can't listen
to those tapes.

48
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,244
<i>I think the major thing</i>
<i>that set, uh,</i>

49
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,947
Deep Throat <i>apart was,</i>

50
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,352
it had a gimmick.

51
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,651
Ah! Ah... ah!

52
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,825
Well, there it is,
you little bugger,
there it is.

53
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,123
What?

54
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,628
Your clitoris, it's deep down
in the bottom of your throat.

55
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,935
The clitoris
hidden in the throat

56
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,028
was something
you could talk about
and laugh about.

57
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,129
It's better than having
no clitoris at all.

58
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,335
That's easy
for you to say.

59
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,303
Suppose your balls
were in your ear.

60
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,907
<i>I was 19 when I saw it.</i>

61
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,886
<i>I don't think I had found</i>
<i>where the clitoris really was.</i>

62
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,478
So I think the idea

63
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,080
that it was misplaced

64
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,125
on the human body
was lost on me.

65
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,889
L... I was looking for
the original site.

66
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,161
It was a giggle.

67
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,893
And the worst thing
to be said about us,
as Americans,

68
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,798
is that we'll sell
our souls for a giggle.

69
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,837
Listen, uh, we have
the problem solved.

70
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,065
All we have to do now
is find the solution.

71
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,731
Like what?

72
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,968
Like deep throat.

73
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,477
Deep what?

74
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,478
Throat.

75
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,811
Have you ever taken
a penis all the way down

76
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,111
to the bottom
of your throat?

77
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,259
It was a badge of
the new freedom.

78
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,659
<i>Have you been</i>
<i>to the experience</i>

79
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,131
<i>of paying to go</i>
<i>in a porno theater</i>

80
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,735
<i>And see a woman</i>
<i>give a blowjob</i>

81
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,895
<i>in a movie theater</i>
<i>in your community?</i>

82
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,734
<i>That was very, very new.</i>

83
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,609
Something that's hard
for people today to imagine,

84
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,337
how liberating that was.

85
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,438
Or... or terrible, depending on
what you believe in.

86
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,442
It's a floodtide of
filth that's engulfed

87
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,009
the minds and
hearts and souls

88
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,078
of America like
nothing else ever has.

89
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,691
<i>We have smut all over the face</i>
<i>of this country now</i>

90
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,560
<i>because we are letting</i>
<i>those immoral people</i>

91
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,464
<i>have their way</i>
<i>in our country.</i>

92
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,035
<i>Deep Throat</i> succeeded
commercially at least in part

93
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,665
because the government
went after it.

94
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,574
<i>The government became</i>
<i>the driving force</i>

95
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,443
<i>behind the public relations.</i>

96
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,952
<i>I just saw it and I liked it.</i>

97
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,422
<i>I liked it. I wanted to see</i>
<i>a dirty picture</i>
<i>and that's what I saw.</i>

98
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,460
<i>But I want the right</i>
<i>to see that picture.</i>

99
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,293
<i>I don't want somebody</i>
<i>telling me that I can't</i>
<i>see a dirty picture.</i>

100
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,801
<i>Deep Throat</i> attacks
the very core of our being.

101
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,534
<i>Every time someone</i>
<i>watches that movie,</i>

102
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,538
they're watching me
being raped.

103
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,909
Do I belong in jail
for five years
for acting in <i>Deep Throat?</i>

104
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,376
<i>Deep Throat</i> now
has had a phenomenal success

105
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,615
going on
for two-and-a-half years,

106
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,589
and it's only
because it's being hassled.

107
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,751
Do you think
it's a good movie?

108
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,421
No, I don't think
it's a good movie.

109
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,881
I'm takin' a walk,
Mrs. Brown.

110
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,556
I am doing fine, dear,
thank you.

111
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,670
# <i>I rode my bicycle</i>
<i>past your window last night</i> #

112
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:04,813
# <i>I roller-skated</i>
<i>to your door at daylight</i> #

113
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:10,250
# <i>It almost seems</i>
<i>like you're avoiding me</i> #

114
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,814
These are some pictures

115
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,520
or posters from some
of the films I've done.

116
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:20,196
# <i>Well, I got a brand new pair</i>
<i>of roller-skates</i> #

117
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,665
# <i>You got a brand new key</i> #

118
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,725
Aren't they kind of cute?

119
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,428
# <i>I think that we should</i>
<i>get together</i> #

120
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:30,134
A picture of Gerard, my son,
when he was a lot younger,

121
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,907
and my daughter
when she was younger.

122
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,879
# <i>You got something for me</i> #

123
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,781
<i>Long before</i> Deep Throat,
<i>Damiano was a family man.</i>

124
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,343
<i>He and his wife</i>
<i>ran a beauty salon</i>
<i>in Queens, New York.</i>

125
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,646
# <i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah</i> ##

126
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,989
<i>I enjoyed being a hairdresser</i>

127
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,223
<i>because I always</i>
<i>could relate to women.</i>

128
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,560
<i>After you got to know</i>
<i>the woman,</i>

129
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,296
<i>especially when you</i>
<i>worked on them weekly,</i>

130
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,634
you start to get into history

131
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,264
about "we went to the movies"
and "he did this and I did..."

132
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,240
And realize that most...

133
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,301
most of the women
were very unhappy

134
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,539
in their relationship

135
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,447
with the person that
they were married to

136
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,348
and supposedly
in love with.

137
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,317
<i>After 40 years of marriage,</i>
<i>you know, you can get</i>

138
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,422
<i>tired of the good old</i>
<i>in and out.</i>

139
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,124
You... you got to be intimate.
It was almost like a priest.

140
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,460
I mean, I... I don't wanna say
I was a priest,

141
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,057
but it was almost like...
it was almost like
a confessor.

142
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,494
<i>The confessions Damiano heard</i>
<i>in his salon,</i>

143
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:36,405
<i>made him realize he</i>
<i>was on the frontlines</i>
<i>of a sexual revolution.</i>

144
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,805
<i>We grew up in a time</i>

145
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,078
in which sex itself
was largely taboo.

146
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,276
<i>When I was a kid,</i>
<i>young people didn't even know</i>
<i>where babies came from.</i>

147
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,413
<i>I'd love to know.</i>

148
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,424
If I watch
the rest of this program,
will I know the answer?

149
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,688
Gore Vidal would be very good
on the subject.

150
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,223
You must take into account
how ignorant people are.

151
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,824
<i>Particularly our countrymen,</i>

152
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,995
who have never taken
a course in biology,

153
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,332
never read a book.

154
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,771
Do you know anything
about the facts of life?

155
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,810
Not very much,
I'm afraid.

156
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,344
<i>The facts of life</i>
<i>and sexual morality in general</i>

157
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,905
<i>were forbidden topics.</i>

158
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,646
<i>But as all that changed,</i>
<i>issues about sexuality</i>

159
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,779
<i>began to divide society.</i>

160
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,188
<i>Artificial contraception</i>
<i>is wrong.</i>

161
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,685
<i>Evil.</i>

162
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,623
<i>People were experimenting.</i>

163
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,424
<i>They were looking</i>
<i>for new kinds of lives.</i>

164
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,830
They were looking to break out
of all the old molds.

165
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,770
<i>And we knew</i>
<i>the American public were tired</i>

166
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,035
<i>of words like "coitus."</i>

167
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,042
They wanted words,
like "fuck,"

168
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,011
and "suck," and "eat my cunt."

169
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,345
I think the more that
filth is thrown at Americans

170
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,112
the less favored it becomes.

171
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,618
They're depicting sex
in a very filthy way.

172
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,858
<i>Jackie Kennedy</i>
<i>went to see that.</i>

173
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,655
The next week,
the gross doubled.

174
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,726
L... I don't mind
seeing sex in a... in a movie
just for its own sake

175
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,791
because I think that's one
of the, you know,

176
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,803
more interesting
human emotions.

177
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,896
<i>Sex was in movies.</i>
<i>Sex was on TV.</i>

178
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,434
Sex came out of the closet.

179
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,540
<i>You had to be there.</i>
<i>You had to be there.</i>

180
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,643
<i>I'm thrilled</i>
<i>that I was there.</i>

181
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,711
And thank God
I had a camera with me.

182
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,485
<i>As the sexual revolution</i>
<i>swept through society,</i>

183
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,686
<i>people took sides</i>
<i>in a culture war</i>
<i>that was gathering steam.</i>

184
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,229
<i>Gerry Damiano</i>
<i>Joined the fray by swapping</i>

185
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,265
<i>his blow dryer</i>
<i>for a movie camera.</i>

186
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,233
<i>I loved film.</i>
<i>L... I always did.</i>

187
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,271
<i>The only thing you could make</i>
<i>was sex films.</i>

188
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,829
Uh, that was the only thing
you were allowed to make

189
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,909
and you made them
at a low budget.

190
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:55,514
Doing hardcore films
in those days, the early '70s,

191
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,007
<i>was very much</i>
<i>like summer stock.</i>

192
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,281
It was like,

193
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,878
"Daddy has a barn,
let's do a show."

194
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,650
Oh, my!

195
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,715
Oh!

196
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,695
Lt... it was the only choice
we had.

197
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,496
Till 24 years old
without,

198
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,568
you know, uh, uh,

199
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,300
what do you call it, uh,
a track record, you know.

200
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,111
And these things
were so inexpensive.

201
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,875
Okay, what I want now is
some of your ass,

202
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,075
all right?

203
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,112
<i>I meant business.</i>

204
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,483
<i>I approached those films as if</i>

205
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,189
I was Luc Godard
or somebody, you know.

206
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,983
And just wiggle it
towards us.

207
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,258
I want to fill up
40 feet of screen
with your ass.

208
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,226
You're always
after my ass.

209
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,437
Keep wigglin'.

210
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,767
That's where I met
half of the people

211
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,343
that I became
acquainted with.

212
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,245
We were all working
for nothing.

213
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,906
Well, one of
Gerry's motivations

214
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,215
was to get laid.

215
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,787
Really. And he did.

216
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,453
<i>You could make a living</i>

217
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,324
<i>if you were a filmmaker,</i>
<i>making these films.</i>

218
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,523
Quite a number of people
became legitimate
Hollywood directors

219
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,724
out of the porn industry.

220
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,394
I mean, for a while there,
it was kinda like
the entry level job

221
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,766
that you would do.

222
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,134
<i>Uh, you would</i>
<i>work on... on porn.</i>

223
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,799
I'm... I... I certainly
worked on them.

224
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,401
I'm not gonna say
which ones,
but I... I was around it.

225
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,446
<i>All of sudden, there was</i>
<i>a new word.</i>

226
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,505
<i>It was called "filmmaker."</i>

227
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,684
<i>You became</i>
<i>an independent filmmaker.</i>

228
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,049
We were actually doing it

229
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,852
And we couldn't believe it.

230
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,325
We couldn't believe it,
and thank God there was,

231
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,157
there was such
a thing as sex.

232
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,558
<i>There was sex,</i>
<i>but at the time,</i>

233
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,567
<i>the only way to put</i>
<i>hardcore sex</i>
<i>on the screen legally,</i>

234
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,466
<i>was in sex education films.</i>

235
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,139
My name is
Dr. Morris Rosengarden.

236
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,110
<i>They would show sexual scenes,</i>

237
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,009
but they couldn't be accused
of pornography

238
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,707
because it had
an educational value.

239
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,325
<i>Some men</i>
<i>find their wives' buttocks</i>

240
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,451
<i>very stimulating visually.</i>

241
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,256
We needed a father figure
for almost everything.

242
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,792
<i>This may be uncomfortable</i>

243
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,599
<i>for the obese</i>
<i>or older couples.</i>

244
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,772
<i>Why did you need a doctor</i>
<i>to tell you it was okay?</i>

245
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,277
<i>And I said,</i>

246
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,974
"Hey, instead of
discussing not doing it,

247
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,676
let's do it
and don't even discuss it."

248
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,285
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>to be ashamed of.</i>

249
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,248
<i>But there was plenty</i>
<i>to be afraid of.</i>

250
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,816
<i>In addition to</i>
<i>running the risk of arrest</i>
<i>and incarceration,</i>

251
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,920
<i>the criminal underworid</i>
<i>virtually controlled</i>

252
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,897
<i>the production of pornography.</i>

253
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,366
<i>There was something exciting</i>
<i>about it.</i>

254
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,742
It... it lived in some,
uh, mid-worid

255
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,246
between crime and art

256
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,980
<i>and it was adventurous.</i>

257
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,785
Young people today
would be in it for the money

258
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,955
whereas in the old days,
it was for the rebellion.

259
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,926
<i>Frankly, everybody</i>
<i>in one way or another</i>

260
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,401
<i>was connected to that business</i>

261
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,905
because psychologically,
socially, it was happening.

262
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,302
<i>You know, it was part</i>
<i>of a social movement</i>

263
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,342
<i>at the time.</i>

264
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,379
Anybody who took chances

265
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,812
in breaking the social mores
of the time,

266
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,850
was considered a hero.

267
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,716
<i>I believed in it.</i>

268
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,415
I believed that it was
about time to say

269
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,184
that sex
is a beautiful thing,

270
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,816
the human body is
a beautiful thing,

271
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,622
and you really
shouldn't be ashamed of it.

272
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,223
<i>Securing financial backing</i>
<i>from partners</i>

273
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,594
<i>with underworid connections,</i>

274
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:10,101
<i>Damiano raised</i>
<i>enough money to shoot</i>
<i>a hardcore sex feature.</i>

275
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,229
<i>It was going to be called</i>
The Doctor Makes a House Call.

276
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,034
<i>Then Damiano met his muse,</i>

277
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,904
<i>Linda Lovelace,</i>
<i>and everything changed.</i>

278
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:29,078
To me, I always looked at her
as the girl next door.

279
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,526
<i>Before she became worid-famous</i>
<i>as Linda Lovelace,</i>

280
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,863
<i>Linda Boreman</i>
<i>dreamt of opening</i>
<i>a clothing boutique</i>

281
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,335
<i>until she met Chuck Traynor.</i>

282
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,635
<i>I guess he was an escape</i>
<i>for her.</i>

283
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,342
She was not comfortable
living in her parents' home.

284
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,244
And he took her away
from that.

285
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,579
<i>But things</i>
<i>started getting strange.</i>

286
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,753
<i>Linda told me</i>
<i>that she had quit smoking,</i>

287
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,687
and I said,
"Well, how did you do it,
how did you quit?"

288
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,630
She said that
Chuck had hypnotized her.

289
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,325
<i>She said every time</i>
<i>she tried to have a cigarette,</i>

290
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,563
<i>that she would hiccup.</i>

291
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,662
I'm like, "Oh, well, okay."

292
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,241
<i>Within a year,</i>
<i>they were married.</i>

293
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,603
I curse the day that
she ever met

294
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,305
Chuck Traynor.

295
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,815
Unfortunately, he died
before I could kill him,

296
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,082
so lucky for him.

297
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,163
Then I lost contact
and her mother told me that

298
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,132
uh, they're living in New York
and he's doing

299
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,725
documentary films,

300
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,530
and I thought,
"How nice, how exciting."

301
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,242
<i>Chuck had come to my office</i>

302
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,311
<i>and I needed a scene</i>
<i>for another film.</i>

303
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,983
He says, "Well,
Linda can do something."

304
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,253
You know, she...
There was no name for it.

305
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,989
He says,
"She gives head very well."

306
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,029
I said,
"Well, that's wonderful."

307
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,624
So we set up with her
and an actor

308
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,199
to do a... a bit
for another film.

309
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,504
And when I saw
what she could do,

310
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,602
I says, "Stop the cameras."

311
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,888
All I could think about was
what she was doing

312
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,088
was so unique

313
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,961
that I could build
a whole film around it.

314
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,437
Making a motion picture
specifically about
that sexual act,

315
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,838
l... I found very daring
and very courageous.

316
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,476
<i>The first thing that came</i>
<i>to my mind was... was the title</i>

317
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,482
of <i>Deep, Deep Throat.</i>

318
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,247
Because something happened
deep down in... in her throat.

319
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,486
What? The clitoris
is in her throat?

320
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,555
Gerry, you can't do this.

321
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,432
You can't do this.
It's absurd, it's silly.

322
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,437
Nobody will believe it.

323
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,572
I thought it was,

324
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,175
You know,

325
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,375
absurd. I did.

326
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,510
Believe it or not,
some people said,
"What is this, a medical film?

327
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,181
What are you gonna do?
With doctors?"

328
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,523
I said, "No. No."

329
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,990
Somebody said it should be
<i>The Sword Swallower.</i>

330
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,224
I said, "No, no. <i>Deep Throat,</i>
believe me, it'll work.
It'll work."

331
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,295
And, uh,

332
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,935
I'm glad I didn't change it
to <i>The Sword Swallower.</i>

333
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,670
<i>I, kind of,</i>
<i>had the whole thing</i>

334
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,644
<i>in... in my head driving over</i>
<i>the 59th Street Bridge.</i>

335
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,079
<i>That weekend,</i>
<i>I wrote the script</i>

336
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,946
<i>and we... we were ready</i>
<i>to do it.</i>

337
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,617
<i>And I spoke to</i>
<i>my production manager,</i>

338
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,885
<i>Ronnie Wertheim.</i>

339
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,292
The phone rang.
It was Gerry. All excited.

340
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,768
And I told him to bring
all our cast and crew

341
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,862
down to Florida.
We're going to make the film.

342
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,002
<i>I just called, uh,</i>
<i>Harry Reems.</i>

343
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,306
He came as
a production assistant.

344
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,507
He wasn't even supposed
to be in the film.

345
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,613
<i>When we got to Florida,</i>
<i>we all checked into</i>

346
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,624
<i>this, uh, motel,</i>
<i>I think it was called</i>
<i>The Voyager.</i>

347
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:04,492
<i>As we pulled in,</i>
<i>we saw Linda Lovelace</i>

348
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,190
lying on the lawn with her...

349
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,292
You know what her
pussycat's name was?

350
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,172
Adolf Hitler.
He had a mustache like that.

351
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,104
We came from New York

352
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,048
with the promise of
having locations.

353
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,689
<i>To me, it was nothing.</i>

354
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,488
I thought nothing of it.
I thought it was just
a... a piece of shit film.

355
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,129
Probably one of
the worst porno movies
ever made.

356
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:43,028
He's nuts.
Lenny Camp was nuts.

357
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,093
He was one of
the guys that were lining up
everything for us.

358
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,139
<i>And, uh, we got nothing.</i>

359
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,867
If it wasn't for us,

360
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,911
this guy would look like
a piece of shit,

361
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,241
which he really is.

362
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,441
The only thing that saved us,
I said, "Wait a minute,

363
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,419
"we're at The Voyager Motel,
let's go back and shoot

364
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,853
<i>what we were supposed to do</i>
<i>here in the pool. "</i>

365
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,517
From that moment on,
everybody was
location hunting.

366
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:10,493
One of the locations
that we shot at
down in Florida,

367
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,929
was at this, uh,
home in Coconut Grove

368
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,797
that was owned by a guy
who called himself a count.

369
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,099
He's not a count.
He's a horseshit count.

370
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,799
He is no count,
he's fucking Sepy Dobronyi.

371
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,502
And God knows
if that's his real name.

372
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,483
When we came,
they had this elaborate,

373
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,488
elaborate, elaborate
wine cellar.

374
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,519
Should we go
to the wine cellar?

375
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,751
Yes.

376
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,597
# <i>Yeah, Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i> #

377
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:53,593
# <i>Yeah, Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i> #

378
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,000
# <i>Yeah, Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i> ##

379
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,684
If it was planned,
it would not have
been as exciting,

380
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,161
'cause we were just rushing
from one place to another.

381
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,295
You all right?

382
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,094
Yeah, I'm fine,
what makes you say that?

383
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,998
You,
the way you're acting.

384
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,094
<i>In the very beginning,</i>
<i>there were no</i>

385
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,331
<i>porno actors and actresses.</i>

386
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,534
So everybody
had to be taught.

387
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,543
The actors are all shit.

388
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,807
Not... not taught
in the sense of taught.

389
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,712
Taught how to be natural.

390
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,143
Sex,

391
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,347
it makes me feel sort of
tingly all over.

392
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,445
And then...

393
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,580
And then what?

394
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:45,714
Nothing.

395
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,954
I mean, there should be
more to sex
than a lot of little tingles.

396
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,824
There should be
bells ringing,

397
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,558
dams bursting,
bombs going off, something.

398
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,998
Do you want to get off
or do you want
to wreck a city?

399
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,830
Helen, please, be serious.

400
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,768
Gerry knew nothing about it.

401
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:03,807
He knew nothing about acting,
he knew nothing about, um...

402
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,311
He knew nothing.
He knew nothing.

403
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,711
But as a swinger himself,

404
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,249
he had a feel
for how to get people

405
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,477
in a sexual mood.

406
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,444
# <i>Do you wanna touch me?</i> #

407
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:21,322
# <i>Do you wanna touch me?</i>
<i>Do you wanna touch me? Yeah</i> ##

408
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,056
The really important thing
was Harry Reems.

409
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,098
<i>I couldn't find</i>
<i>anybody in Florida</i>

410
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,726
<i>that could even come close</i>
<i>to doing the role.</i>

411
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,828
So at one point,
I fired him off the crew,

412
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,835
And hired him as the lead,
and thank God he was there,

413
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,411
because I... I don't know
of anybody

414
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,603
that could have even
come close to doing

415
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,411
the job that he did,

416
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,283
as... as the wacky doctor.

417
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,979
I want to hear bells.

418
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,214
Bells?

419
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,516
Bombs.
Bombs?

420
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,080
And dams bursting.

421
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,420
The rockets' red glare.

422
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,689
No, he's not an actor,
he knows that.

423
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,521
Bombs bursting
in air.

424
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,263
# Gave proof through the night
that our flag
was still there ##

425
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,004
He... he would get an erection

426
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,440
at the sound
of the camera motor.

427
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,279
That explains a lot.

428
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,284
You know, I... I, uh,
I never had a problem

429
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,114
um, getting an erection.

430
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:28,381
# <i>Oh, yeah, Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i> ##

431
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,318
<i>Linda had the hots</i>
<i>for Harry Reems.</i>

432
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,864
<i>And the morning</i>
<i>we were gonna do</i>

433
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,230
<i>the deep throat scene,</i>

434
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,097
<i>she came to me</i>
<i>and she was very upset,</i>

435
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,261
and she says,

436
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,398
"Chuck is... is... is so jealous
of Harry Reems

437
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,107
<i>that I don't think</i>
<i>I can do a good job. "</i>

438
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,611
<i>Chuck was a member</i>
<i>of our crew.</i>

439
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,012
Production manager
sent him to...

440
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,710
Uh, we said
we're running out of film.

441
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,078
<i>So he went to Miami</i>
<i>to buy film</i>

442
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,746
<i>when we shot the scene,</i>

443
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:01,883
Linda was completely relaxed,
and she did a marvelous job.

444
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:26,509
Uh, when I saw her do that,
yes, it is kind of amazing.

445
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,514
Kind of amazing.
It really is.

446
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,982
Surprised?
I was flabbergasted.

447
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,355
I had no idea.

448
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,624
<i>This was the moment</i>
<i>that heterosexual film</i>

449
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,068
<i>became interested in blowjobs.</i>

450
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,605
<i>I mean, it's not that</i>
<i>fellatio didn't exist.</i>

451
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,665
Certainly, you see
fellatio in stag films.

452
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:56,176
Um, but you don't
get this fellatio

453
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,044
as figured as

454
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,482
the be-all and end-all,

455
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,543
as the absolute pleasure.

456
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,452
<i>The thing that</i>
<i>you have to remember</i>

457
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,456
<i>about fellatio is,</i>

458
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,425
<i>historically, it had</i>
<i>been considered illegal</i>

459
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,054
<i>and referred to</i>
<i>as the abominable,</i>

460
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,223
detestable crimes
against nature.

461
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,494
Deep throat was not a term

462
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:20,026
that my girlfriends and I
really knew anything about.

463
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,472
Most of us had never
even heard of oral sex
or how to perform it.

464
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,065
And people
who wouldn't have dreamed

465
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,371
of going near
that sort of matter

466
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,743
in the '40s and '50s,
and certainly in the '30s,

467
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,374
because that was dirty,
that was low sex,
that was dreadful,

468
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,782
began to see it
as an enrichment.

469
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,219
And I'll just mention
that ejaculate,

470
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,823
I've always known,
was good for the complexion.

471
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,190
It's full of babies,
its... it's full of protein,

472
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,695
it's full of, uh, plasma.

473
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,756
And to rub it
all over your face
and neck and chest,

474
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,892
a lot of women know that
that's a good thing to do,

475
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,960
not for him but for you.

476
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,871
<i>Gerry returned to New York</i>
<i>to edit his film.</i>

477
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,877
<i>But there was still</i>
<i>one thing he needed.</i>

478
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,676
<i>A mind-blowing</i>
<i>cinematic female orgasm:</i>

479
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,416
<i>Proof of the success</i>
<i>of Linda's quest</i>

480
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,214
<i>for sexual satisfaction.</i>

481
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,921
People didn't
understand that women,

482
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,596
uh, could have as much...

483
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,356
feel as much pleasure
as men did.

484
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,994
Somehow, nobody ever
acknowledged

485
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,333
there was such a thing
as an orgasm for a woman.

486
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,373
That was all male stuff.

487
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,137
<i>It is harder to show</i>
<i>female pleasure.</i>

488
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,306
It's harder to show
female pleasure,

489
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,374
and to believe
that it's actually happening.

490
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,149
That's why I wanted
to show it.

491
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,090
<i>I went to the film archives</i>

492
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,352
<i>in... in Washington</i>

493
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,951
<i>and got footage of a rocket</i>

494
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,523
and then did
subliminal cutting
with... with the rocket

495
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,499
and... and Linda,
back and forth.

496
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,540
<i>This is a male fantasy</i>
<i>that says:</i>

497
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,908
"I like to have
my cock sucked.

498
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:08,935
I really get off on it,
therefore she must, too."

499
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,452
I think that was
a hell of a shot.

500
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,423
Look, men want to believe

501
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,588
that the clitoris
is in a woman's throat.

502
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,496
Because if they believe
that the clitoris
is in a woman's throat,

503
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,625
then they can believe
that by thrusting

504
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,636
their penis
into a woman's mouth,

505
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,262
she gets as much pleasure
as they do.

506
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,841
Guess what? It's not true.

507
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,403
Uh, you know,
l... I guess, uh,

508
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,143
<i>Deep Throat</i> opened up
a... a, uh, a can of worms.

509
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:53,783
# <i>Get down, get down,</i>
<i>get down, get down</i> #

510
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,886
<i>When hardcore pornography</i>
<i>is permitted</i>

511
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,519
<i>to corrupt the minds</i>
<i>of children,</i>

512
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,497
<i>then the time has come</i>
<i>for new moral leadership</i>

513
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,295
<i>to make itself felt</i>
<i>in America.</i>

514
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,572
<i>Before</i> Deep Throat
<i>was even shot,</i>

515
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,077
<i>politics and pornography</i>
<i>were on a collision course.</i>

516
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,505
<i>In 1968,</i>
<i>the government launched</i>
<i>a scientific commission</i>

517
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:21,382
<i>to determine if pornography</i>
<i>really was harmful.</i>

518
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,078
# <i>Jungle Boogie</i> #

519
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,987
# <i>Jungle Boogie,</i>
<i>Get it on</i> #

520
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,727
# <i>Get it on</i> ##

521
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,662
<i>Well, today, the final results</i>
<i>were published.</i>

522
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,858
<i>The presidential commission</i>
<i>recommended doing away</i>

523
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,129
<i>with most of the laws</i>
<i>that cover pornography,</i>

524
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,603
<i>because they don't</i>
<i>seem to be doing much good,</i>

525
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:44,368
<i>and because pornography</i>
<i>doesn't seem to do much harm</i>
<i>to the adult mind.</i>

526
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:49,013
<i>For one brief shining moment,</i>
<i>it did look like</i>

527
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,141
society was going to become

528
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,413
a little more adult
about their sexuality.

529
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,013
<i>But committee member</i>
<i>Charles Keating,</i>

530
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,716
<i>appointed by President Nixon,</i>

531
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,486
<i>fought to dismiss</i>
<i>the findings.</i>

532
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,255
<i>Obscenity does indeed effect.</i>

533
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,423
<i>The effect it has</i>
<i>is detrimental to society.</i>

534
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:11,394
Charles Keating was
a notorious censorship bug.

535
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:14,233
Later on, of course,
we discovered he was
a good deal more.

536
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,775
He was a swindler
and went to prison.

537
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:21,073
<i>The president said today,</i>
<i>"So long as I am</i>
<i>in the White House,</i>

538
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,340
<i>"there will be no relaxation</i>
<i>of the national effort</i>

539
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,644
<i>to control</i>
<i>and eliminate smut. "</i>

540
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,751
<i>Then Nixon persuaded</i>
<i>the Senate</i>

541
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:31,016
<i>to reject the report,</i>
<i>suppressing its findings.</i>

542
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:32,980
Everybody forgot about

543
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,026
the President's commission
on pornography,

544
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,789
because they... they
didn't come out

545
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,092
with the answer
they were looking for.

546
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,531
Instead, Nixon got reelected,

547
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,229
after being declared
politically dead,

548
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,805
and the forces of repression
came in,

549
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,967
in a huge, huge way.

550
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,738
<i>He knew all the buttons</i>
<i>to press.</i>

551
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,780
Sodomy...

552
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,613
I mean, everybody starts
to vibrate like a gong.

553
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,991
We lie about human sexuality,
because we're taught
to lie about everything.

554
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,363
<i>When you have a nation</i>
<i>that totally lies,</i>

555
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,260
then you have
no reality.

556
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,338
<i>The message was clear:</i>

557
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,204
<i>Cleaning up porn</i>
<i>was good politics.</i>

558
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,073
<i>And what better place to start</i>
<i>than Times Square,</i>

559
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,113
<i>the nation's capital of sleaze</i>

560
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,238
<i>and the site</i>
<i>of</i> Deep Throat's <i>premiere</i>

561
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,944
<i>in June 1972.</i>

562
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,686
<i>A good many</i>
<i>of the so-called perverts</i>

563
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,320
<i>are attracted to 42nd Street</i>

564
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,864
and we've had complaints.

565
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,730
# <i>Superfly</i> ##

566
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,365
<i>Suddenly, I see a movie</i>
<i>that knocks my socks off.</i>

567
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,842
And here's
the wonderful thing:

568
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,642
This film, <i>Deep Throat,</i>
is funny.

569
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,979
And Linda's a wonderful,
wonderful cocksucker.

570
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,086
God, I wish my wives
could suck dick like that.

571
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,455
<i>And I give it 100 points</i>
<i>on the Peter-Meter.</i>

572
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,221
<i>"Peter" means</i>
<i>how many hard-ons do I get.</i>

573
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,024
Now it would take
5,000 Viagra

574
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,190
to get me hard,

575
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:25,167
but then I'm virile and young
and I get many hard-ons.

576
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,028
<i>New Yorkers greet it</i>
<i>with the same</i>
<i>enthusiasm as I did.</i>

577
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,073
It was a joy.

578
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,872
As we say in Israel,
it was a mitzvah.

579
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,641
<i>I have the privilege</i>
<i>of announcing</i>

580
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,844
<i>the formation of</i>
<i>the Times Square</i>
<i>Development Council.</i>

581
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,878
Deep Throat
<i>was the perfect target</i>

582
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,481
<i>for New York's campaign</i>
<i>to clean up porn</i>

583
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,526
<i>and the police moved in.</i>

584
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,525
<i>I first became aware</i>
<i>of</i> Deep Throat

585
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,036
when it was, uh,
it was advertised
in the papers.

586
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,299
It was the talk of the office,
you know, "Look at this."

587
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,008
<i>Being in the industry,</i>
<i>so to speak,</i>

588
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,547
<i>we all ran out to see it.</i>

589
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,541
It was stunning.

590
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,545
<i>The cinematography,</i>
<i>for a porno movie,</i>
<i>was very good.</i>

591
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,681
The movie was funny.

592
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,851
It had the kind of lines
in it, uh, that were amusing.

593
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,625
Mind if I smoke
while you're eating?

594
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,255
No, not at all.

595
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,504
It was definitely
a change of pace,

596
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,062
definitely
a change of pace.

597
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,345
We knew that this was, uh,
this was something different.

598
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:46,145
# <i>Love, love is strange</i> ##

599
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,686
<i>I think they picked</i>
<i>on</i> Deep Throat

600
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,188
<i>because it was</i>
<i>the highest profile.</i>

601
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,555
If they could, uh,
successfully prosecute
<i>Deep Throat,</i>

602
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,526
uh, then they felt that

603
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,426
the other prosecutions
would be easier.

604
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,735
<i>Not once, not twice,</i>
<i>but three times</i>

605
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,464
<i>the police raided</i> Deep Throat,

606
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,336
<i>staging their final raid</i>
<i>for the cameras.</i>

607
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,203
<i>This was political.</i>

608
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,407
<i>If nobody records the arrest,</i>

609
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,577
<i>then nobody will know</i>

610
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,814
that they are doing their job
in fighting sin.

611
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,488
Do you... you consider
what you're running
pornographic, sir?

612
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,192
If it was pornographic,

613
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,888
they could prosecute
in a diligent, proper manner.

614
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,023
They wouldn't have to
come around in hoards of 50

615
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,358
and take signs
out of windows

616
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:40,193
and act like
the Gestapo of old.

617
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:46,009
This theater that had not done
$5,000 a week in 20 years,

618
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,872
was running
virtually 20 hours a day.

619
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,049
<i>It never stopped running.</i>

620
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,509
The owners really couldn't
afford to shut it down.

621
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,951
They didn't want
to shut it down.

622
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:00,218
And so, uh, there... there was
going to be a trial.

623
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,161
Deep Throat's <i>defense</i>
<i>produced expert witnesses</i>

624
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:14,193
<i>to argue that the film was</i>
<i>more enlightening</i>
<i>than merely obscene.</i>

625
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,977
<i>But the prosecution countered</i>

626
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,216
<i>that this sexual satisfaction</i>
<i>was dangerous to women</i>

627
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,885
<i>because</i> Deep Throat <i>emphasized</i>
<i>the wrong kind of orgasm:</i>

628
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,191
<i>The clitoral orgasm.</i>

629
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,132
<i>I remember that the judge</i>
<i>hadn't heard the term.</i>

630
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,765
And, uh,
so he expressed surprise

631
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,598
and asked the question,
"What's that?"

632
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:53,368
<i>Here, just outside and above</i>
<i>the vaginal opening</i>

633
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,410
<i>Is the clitoris.</i>

634
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,696
<i>The clitoris.</i>

635
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,199
He should have been
sitting in my classes

636
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,431
because he would have
heard me say loud and clear

637
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,333
that let's get away
from that idea,

638
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,238
which still
some people have,

639
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,278
that, uh,
a vaginal orgasm

640
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,246
is, um, more satisfying
for a woman

641
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,510
than a clitoral orgasm.
No such thing.

642
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,715
<i>At that time, a real orgasm</i>
<i>could only happen</i>

643
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,153
<i>if you were with a man</i>

644
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,555
<i>and his penis</i>
<i>was inside of you</i>

645
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:45,528
and that was total,
utter nonsense, of course.

646
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,458
Sex is not only for penises.

647
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,526
Uh, sex is something
for women.

648
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,299
<i>The clitoris.</i>

649
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,067
<i>This tiny organ,</i>

650
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,768
<i>about the size and shape</i>
<i>of a garden pea,</i>

651
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,974
<i>is the seat</i>
<i>of sexuality in women.</i>

652
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:07,515
I think the judge
learned a lot during the trial

653
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,887
as I... Look,
l... I certainly did myself.

654
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,752
<i>As the judge retired</i>
<i>to consider his verdict,</i>

655
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,726
<i>ticket sales almost doubled,</i>

656
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,322
<i>prompting a young reporter</i>
<i>from the</i> New York Times
<i>to write an article</i>

657
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,493
<i>that would give the film</i>
<i>mainstream legitimacy.</i>

658
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,061
<i>I remember</i>
<i>writing the article.</i>

659
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,264
<i>Uh, the... the headline</i>
<i>was "Porno chic."</i>

660
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,364
I wrote it on a typewriter.

write about <i>Deep Throat,</i>

663
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,478
well, then it must be safe
in some way.

664

00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,661
Approximately
1,700 people a day
have been in to see the film.

669
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,707
Are you looking forward
to this movie?

670
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:04,866
Yes, I am.

671
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,069
People from Central Park West
and Fifth Avenue
and Park Avenue

672
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,579
wanted to go down and see it
and go slumming.

673
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,981
<i>There was a private showing.</i>
<i>Before I knew what happened,</i>

674
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:18,021
there was, like,
group sex happening,
left, right, and center.

675
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,557
<i>Since this is supposed to be</i>
<i>it of its genre,</i>

676
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,326
and since it's had this piece
in the <i>New York Times,</i>

677
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,527
I might as well see it
if it's going.

678
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,067
What are you expecting to see?

679
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,264
Well, uh,

680
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,605
you might close me down if I
said what I was going to say.

681
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:44,904
It took porn out of the realm
of the forbidden.

682
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,950
Why, there's nothing wrong
with a normal man

683
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,780
going to
a pornographic movie.

684
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,083
Normal, all right,
but why were you there?

685
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,782
You would see
movie stars there.

686
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,449
<i>You would see</i>
<i>society people there.</i>

687
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:00,326
I went to see <i>Deep Throat</i>
because I'm fond
of animal pictures.

688
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,196
I thought it was
about giraffes.

689
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,369
90 percent
of the people there
are asthmatics.

690
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,873
What do you mean,
asthmatics?

691
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,136
'Cause all I could hear
was...

692
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:16,846
People weren't jerking off

693
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,813
when, you know, I don't know
who's sitting next
to Angela Lansbury.

694
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,910
Oh, I'm just picking her out,
but... but basically,

695
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,921
because she'd just
put a damper on things.

696
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,116
What did you say the name of
that movie was?

697
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,419
Uh, <i>Deep Threat.</i>

698
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,892
You'd better hurry up
before you miss the opening

699
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,690
'cause you don't
wanna miss the opening.

700
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,321
In the opening, Linda...

701
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,398
Deep Throat <i>was so successful</i>

702
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,598
<i>that it turned Linda Lovelace</i>
<i>from an unknown</i>

703
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:47,268
<i>into a celebrity</i>
<i>and poster-child</i>
<i>for the new porn chic.</i>

704
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,748
I made $1,200
for <i>Deep Throat.</i>

705
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,377
And that's all?

706
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,852
Yeah.

707
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:57,979
What about...

708
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,547
I'm, you know, now I'm known,
so it's okay.

709
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,230
<i>It was about 11:00 at night</i>

710
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,664
<i>and we were</i>
<i>watching television.</i>

711
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,992
And we saw this
theater and it said,

712
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,969
you know, Linda Lovelace,
<i>Deep Throat</i>
or whatever it was.

713
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,869
And, uh, I said,
"Oh, disgusting.

714
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,778
Absolutely disgusting."

715
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,744
<i>A girlfriend of mine</i>
<i>called and said,</i>

716
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,842
<i>"Pick up</i> Playboy Magazine.

717
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,854
If that's not Linda,
I'll eat the magazine."

718
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,791
So I stopped, I picked it up,

719
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,554
'cause it wasn't allowed
in my house.

720
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,025
<i>And I opened it up</i>
<i>and I read it</i>

721
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,000
and I said, "Oh, my God."

722
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,770
And I knew then, it was...
it was our Linda.

723
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,918
That was difficult for me,
to see the movie.

724
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:09,255
When we got home,
I threw myself across the bed
and started bawling.

725
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,226
I was crying like, I'd, um,

726
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,923
like I just found out
someone I loved had died.

727
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,191
<i>And, uh,</i>

728
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,167
and it wasn't, um...

729
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,375
It wasn't just, uh, you know,

730
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:30,243
a sleazy little film on a...
on a small screen

731
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,942
with a bunch of guys
in trench coats there.

732
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:37,078
I mean, there were,
society was there.

733
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,756
I didn't know how
Linda was going to be
able to deal with that.

734
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:49,231
<i>The next time I spoke to her,</i>
<i>she said, "I'm sorry,</i>

735
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,894
"I didn't want you to know,

736
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,266
'cause I knew you'd be upset
or you'd be angry."

737
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:57,966
I said, "I'm not angry
'cause I don't know
who Linda Lovelace is.

738
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,804
I only know who you are."

739
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,111
The pornographic film
Deep Throat

740
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,882
has become
one of the most popular

741
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,322
and profitable blue movies
of all time.

742
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,690
Today, a Manhattan
criminal court judge
ruled the film obscene,

743
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,491
and ordered it removed
from theaters
in New York City.

744
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,865
<i>A Sodom and Gomorrah</i>
<i>gone wild before the fire.</i>

745
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:34,468
<i>He believed he was writing</i>
<i>for posterity.</i>

746
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,513
<i>Now you and I know,</i>
<i>in retrospect,</i>

747
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,114
that he accomplished
absolutely nothing.

748
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,218
<i>I readily perform</i>
<i>the operation</i>

749
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,126
<i>by finding</i>
<i>the defendant guilty</i>
<i>as charged.</i>

750
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,629
I still think
what the Worid Theatre did
on its marquee

751
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,002
was better than what he wrote
in his opinion.

752
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,268
<i>"Throat cut, worid mourns."</i>

753
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,743
<i>It's a picture</i>
<i>that'll never die.</i>

754
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:12,876
I mean, we'll all die,
but <i>Deep Throat</i> won't die.

755
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,413
<i>Shutting</i> Deep Throat <i>down</i>
<i>in New York</i>

756
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,390
<i>only spurred</i>
<i>audiences' interest</i>
<i>across the country.</i>

757
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:25,050
<i>Wherever it opened,</i>
<i>authorities scrambled</i>
<i>to shut it down.</i>

758
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,325
<i>This trash that's being shown</i>
<i>on our movie screens</i>

759
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,525
<i>across the country.</i>

760
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,501
There isn't any question
in my mind that it's obscene.

761
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,839
<i>By the mid '70s,</i> Deep Throat
<i>had been tried</i>

762
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,375
<i>in more than 32 cities...</i>

763
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,280
<i>... and was ultimately banned</i>
<i>in 23 states.</i>

764
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,748
Violation of the law.
It's a simple thing.

765
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,086
It's obscene as hell to me.

766
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,116
Hmm.

767
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,992
<i>Ordered to stop the spread</i>
<i>of</i> Deep Throat,

768
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,829
<i>the FBI stepped in.</i>

769
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,902
<i>They began with the arrest</i>
<i>of Gerry Damiano.</i>

770
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,138
The first question
the prosecutor asked me:

771
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,641
Did I know what...

772
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,372
what affiliation
m- my partners had?

773
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,415
<i>And I said as far as I know,</i>
<i>he's a Roman Catholic.</i>

774
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,523
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>I'm... I'm part of the mob.</i>

775
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:32,151
No. I was...
I was never a mob.

776
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,431
<i>There were originally</i>
<i>three partners</i>

777
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,228
<i>who made the movie.</i>

778
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:41,599
<i>His two partners came to him,</i>
<i>Damiano told me,</i>

779
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,570
and told him
they were buying him out.

780
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,599
And I said to him
that didn't sound
like a very good, uh, deal,

781
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,804
uh, when you're
a one-third partner
of a project

782
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,747
that is just, you know,
bringing in
bucket-loads of money

783
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,579
and you're suddenly
cut out of the deal.

784
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:55,982
Uh, why didn't he object?

785
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,613
And he rolled his eyes
and he wouldn't say anymore.

786
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,987
And the... the only thing
he told me was he didn't want
his legs broken.

787
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,786
No, it was easier for me
to... to say:

788
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,794
"L... I don't,
I don't want to have
anything to do with it."

789
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,302
It was easier.
It was a lot easier.

790
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,236
It was, kind of a...
it was, kind of a...

791
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,275
a thing I could not
have won.

792
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,714
That's about as far as
I could go with it.

793
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,877
<i>Damiano wasn't alone.</i>

794
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,514
<i>Across the country,</i>
<i>theater owners discovered</i>

795
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,251
<i>exhibiting</i> Deep Throat
<i>also meant</i>

796
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,054
<i>running with the mob.</i>

797
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,525
One day,
I pick up the <i>New York Times,</i>

798
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,269
and in it,
it says it is very chic

799
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,794
<i>to see</i> Deep Throat.

800
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:51,033
So that gave me an idea

801
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,940
to see if I can get
the picture for Florida.

802
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,713
<i>Luckily,</i>
<i>I knew one of the men</i>

803
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,976
<i>that was connected</i>
<i>with the picture.</i>

804
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,417
<i>And I didn't think</i>
<i>it could run in Florida.</i>

805
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:06,252
And so,
I was given the picture
for a very reasonable amount.

806
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:11,293
I never would have
dreamt of opening
that picture anywheres

807
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,823
if it wasn't for that article.

808
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,365
If we don't get sued,
it will be a miracle.

809
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,367
Terry, please, Terry.
It's almost over.

810
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,925
I think it's enough.
Cut. Finished.

811
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:21,265
It's almost over.
It's enough.

812
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,497
It's almost over.

813
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,164
L... I think
it's enough already.

814
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,868
You don't realize
how people pick up
on things.

815
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,535
What are they
picking up on, Terry?

816
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,579
They're picking up on things
in Miami Beach.

817
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,808
You... you just said
they do bad things.

818
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,373
They could
call you up on this.

819
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,146
Come on, Artie,
don't be stupid.

820
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,585
You're a grown man.

821
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:38,780
Cut.

822
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,050
Terry.

823
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,424
# <i>Making a living</i>
<i>the old, hard way</i> #

824
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:49,022
# <i>Taking and giving</i>
<i>my day by day</i> #

825
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,535
# <i>I dig the snow and rain</i>

# <i>Draggin' the line</i> ##

828
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,800
The reason there were
so many more

obscenity cases

830
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,574
after 1972

831
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,550
<i>was because I went out</i>
<i>and looked for 'em.</i>

832
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,252
I knew it was a gamble

833
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,853
because of New York
having problems with the city,

834
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,257
that it was on trial.

835
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,719
<i>I opened the picture</i>
<i>and the next thing I knew</i>

836
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:22,287
<i>we had lines</i>
<i>around the corner.</i>

837
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,729
There must have been,

838
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,429
I'm guessing 100 or 150 people
in line when they opened.

839
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:31,640
Every fucking FBI agent
in the country
was sitting in the audience.

840
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,233
Kelly was there
and everything else.

841
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,943
<i>You walked into the theater.</i>

842
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,845
There's just a,
sort of a bent-nosed,

843
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,612
middle-aged guy
with a very rough voice.

844
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,175
<i>He says, "$5."</i>

845
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,152
So I gave him $5 and said:
"Where is the ticket?"

846
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,986
He said,
"No tickets, just go on in."

847
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,854
The movie started

848
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,619
and about 50 of them
got up and said:

849
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:56,063
"It's a sex picture,
get me out! Get me out!

850
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,067
It's a sex picture,
I can't stand it."

851
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,326
<i>Not only was it a violation</i>

852
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,462
<i>of the obscenity law</i>
<i>of the United States,</i>

853
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:05,632
<i>it was also</i>
<i>a highly organized</i>
<i>crime enterprise.</i>

854
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,610
<i>I didn't know</i>

855
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,308
<i>who the Peraino gang was</i>
<i>at that time.</i>

856
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,907
<i>But I soon found out</i>
<i>when I started investigating</i>

857
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:17,818
<i>that they were heavyweights</i>
<i>out of New York.</i>

858
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,448
<i>They were part of</i>
<i>the Colombo family operation</i>

859
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,220
<i>who had moved</i>
<i>to Fort Lauderdale area.</i>

860
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,890
I haven't seen them
since I... I left.

861
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,103
And I want to make sure
l... I don't get a phone call

862
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:39,904
or get a knock on the door
that they want to talk to me.

863
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,969
Because I've been
away from them for 30 years.

864
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,248
And I... I... I'd like it
to be that way.

865
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,251
This is... this is shit
as far as I'm concerned.

866
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,049
Excuse my language
but I can't stand it.

867
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:55,023
He can tell you things,
your hair would
stand up on your heads.

868
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,356
I didn't mention
any of those things,
Terry.

869
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,054
What?
I didn't mention any of them.

870
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,391
I don't... I don't
want you to.

871
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:01,658
I didn't.

872
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,597
We haven't heard
in 32 years.

873
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,032
Thank God.

874
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,160
So, how do you know?

875
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,567
I don't know
if they're living.

876
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,698
They could be dead,
Terry.

877
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,442
<i>In its second year of release,</i>

878
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,415
Deep Throat <i>was still</i>
<i>number 11 on the charts.</i>

879
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,213
<i>It's a dirty movie.</i>

880
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:26,152
<i>Look, try to look at it</i>
<i>as a satire of</i>
<i>contemporary sexual mores</i>

881
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,191
<i>with lots of</i>
<i>redeeming social values.</i>

882
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,193
<i>Porn chic was all the rage.</i>

883
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,856
<i>Films like Damiano's</i>
The Devil in Miss Jones

884
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,398
<i>and</i> Behind the Green Door

885
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:40,300
<i>followed on the heels</i>
<i>of</i> Deep Throat's
<i>unprecedented success,</i>

886
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,698
<i>giving Hollywood films</i>
<i>a run for their money.</i>

887
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,241
<i>The studios were in shambles</i>
<i>in the early '70s.</i>

888
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,642
There's this movie out there,
everyone's going to see it.

889
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,705
How does that affect you
and the pictures
you should be making?

890
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,841
<i>I've been the first one</i>
<i>to go down the path.</i>

891
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,251
<i>I'd like to see, uh,</i>
<i>legitimate films</i>

892
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:01,984
<i>and so-called</i>
<i>pornographic films</i>
<i>merge together.</i>

893
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,687
<i>I think the two industries</i>
<i>have got to merge together.</i>

894
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,385
<i>Thank you for making me</i>

895
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,193
<i>the first woman president</i>
<i>to go down in history.</i>

896
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:13,532
<i>They were shooting porn films</i>
<i>on the lot at Paramount.</i>

897
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,934
This is a little known fact.

898
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:18,667
So Paramount became sort of
confiscated by
the porn industry.

899
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,640
<i>Do you see yourself</i>
<i>as a pioneer?</i>

900
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,734
<i>No.</i>

901
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,813
<i>If it's left alone,</i>
<i>within a year,</i>

902
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,144
<i>sex will just blend itself</i>
<i>into film.</i>

903
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,240
It's inevitable.

904
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:30,616
The only thing
that's uncertain
is... is the time it will take.

905
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:34,255
<i>But the merger of hardcore</i>
<i>and movies never happened.</i>

906
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:38,021
<i>Instead, the Supreme Court,</i>
<i>packed with</i>
<i>4 Nixon appointees,</i>

907
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,723
<i>made a radical change</i>
<i>to the obscenity law</i>

908
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,992
<i>in June 1973.</i>

909
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,203
Yesterday, the Supreme Court
authorized wider restrictions

910
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,398
on the exhibition
and sale of obscenity.

911
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,800
<i>The recent Supreme Court</i>
<i>decision</i>

912
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,471
<i>gave local officials the right</i>
<i>to decide for themselves</i>
<i>what is pornographic</i>

913
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:00,846
<i>without having to be guided</i>
<i>by a national standard.</i>

914
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:05,878
<i>Here in New York City today,</i>

915
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,050
vice squad police
began cracking down
on pornography.

916
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:17,599
<i>Linda, as you may know,</i>
<i>the Supreme Court recently,</i>

917
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:20,795
uh, handed down
a, uh,
decision on pornography.

918
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,304
I don't think
anybody should
regulate anything.

919
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:25,466
I think it should be, uh,

920
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:29,011
I don't believe in censorship.
I don't believe in
anything that they are doing.

921
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,047
But how far can you extend
individual rights

922
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,844
before you hit, uh,
the state of anarchy?

923
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,714
Uh, I really... I don't know.

924
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:37,275
Have you ever
thought about that?

925
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,982
No. I don't know what's
the state of ana-anarchy.

926
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:43,321
Well, it's...
That's when everyone does
precisely what he pleases

927
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,657
and, uh,
society has no rules.

928
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:48,391
At that point,
you've reached anarchy.

929
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,691
Uh, I don't know
about that,
to be honest with you.

930
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,234
I just don't believe
in censorship.

931
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,133
I don't...
That's taking away
your freedom.

932
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,966
That's taking away
your individual right

933
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,596
to make up your own mind
for things.

934
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:00,403
The last person
that started censorship
was Adolf Hitler.

935
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,240
And look
what happened there.

936
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,840
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>the FBI was closing in</i>

937
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,045
<i>on</i> Deep Throat
<i>and its distribution.</i>

938
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,988
<i>They pinpointed</i>
<i>the Perainos' headquarters</i>
<i>in Fort Lauderdale</i>

939
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:16,149
<i>and placed them</i>
<i>under surveillance.</i>

940
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,457
<i>One day,</i>
<i>I get a telephone call</i>

941
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,364
<i>from a confidential source</i>

942
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,697
who will remain anonymous.

943
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,302
<i>And he says to me, uh:</i>

944
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:36,470
<i>"We've got so much cash</i>
<i>that we are having trouble</i>

945
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,337
<i>"physically moving about</i>
<i>the office</i>

946
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,383
<i>because the money</i>
<i>is gettin' in the way. "</i>

947
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,884
I said, "How much you got?"
He said, "I don't know.

948
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,185
We don't even
count it anymore."

949
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,225
I said, "You don't count it?"
He said, "No."

950
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,557
I said, "What do you do?"
He said, "We weigh it."

951
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,831
<i>To get around the law</i>

952
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,094
<i>the mob set up</i>
<i>its own distribution system</i>

953
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,658
<i>of checkers and sweepers</i>

954
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,000
<i>who traveled the country</i>
<i>delivering prints</i>

955
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,164
<i>and collecting the money</i>
<i>from theaters.</i>

956
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:07,903
At a certain time every day,
the checker or the sweeper

957
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:11,243
would go to the manager
of the particular theater,

958
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:15,314
<i>and he would say,</i>
<i>"Our take is 50 percent.</i>

959
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:18,013
<i>"And we want it now, in cash.</i>

960
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,855
Give us the money now,
or else."

961
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,052
<i>I was on my way</i>
<i>down to Nashville.</i>

962
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:26,595
And the reason
I went to Nashville

963
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,756
was I wanted to buy
these Goo Goo candy bars.

964
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,429
# <i>Goo Goo, chew it,</i>
<i>taste it, sweet milk</i> #

965
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,264
<i>I was gonna buy</i>
<i>a bunch of them</i>

966
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,632
<i>and just, you know,</i>
<i>market them</i>

967
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,035
<i>and see if</i>
<i>I could get it going.</i>

968
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,164
<i>Well, on Saturday night,</i>
<i>I decided I'd just go out.</i>

969
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,243
<i>And I met a couple of guys</i>
<i>from New Jersey.</i>

970
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,800
They were a couple of
Italian guys.

971
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:42,900
I happen to be a Greek,

972
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,776
so Italians and Greeks
are like cousins.

973
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:48,579
# <i>I gotta have a Goo Goo,</i>
<i>how 'bout you?</i>
<i>Goo Goo</i> ##

974
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,517
They wanted me
to go to work for 'em

975
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:53,522
uh, baby-sitting
<i>Deep Throat.</i>

976
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:57,115
<i>And they sent me over to</i>
<i>the Lamar Theater in Memphis.</i>

977
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,892
<i>And that's where it all began.</i>

978
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,392
<i>And as people walked in,</i>
<i>I would count 'em in.</i>

979
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,592
<i>Then I would go down</i>
<i>through the theater crowd</i>

980
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,934
<i>and I would count the number</i>
<i>of people in the theater</i>
<i>with a little clicker.</i>

981
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,940
<i>You know,</i>
<i>those little things.</i>

982
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:17,075
A checker. That's what I was.

983
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,773
<i>L... I was just a</i>
<i>simple checker. I had no power</i>

984
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,148
I had no rank, nothing.
I was just an employee.

985
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,816
Nobody was hurt.

986
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,085
And, uh,
the only ones that got hurt

987
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,686
was, uh, one of our checkers
in New Orleans.

988
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,356
Uh, he had $60,000
and he disappeared.

989
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:38,731
The money disappeared
and they found his body in
the back of a pickup truck.

990
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,905
<i>A theater manager</i>
<i>refused to pay.</i>

991
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:49,138
<i>And the next thing I know,</i>
<i>I heard</i>
<i>the theater burned down.</i>

992
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,042
<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>they would do somethin'.</i>

993
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,948
But I did have a Colt.45
with the hammer back

994
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,042
in my belt.

995
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,551
<i>They had people</i>
<i>that... that would do things.</i>

996
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,518
Was it any kind of, uh,
an organized crime?

997
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,525
Well,
is every Italian

998
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,521
A criminal?

999
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:11,260
Is every Italian a gangster?
I don't think so.

1000
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:14,201
You know, some Italians
have actually opened up
Italian restaurants

1001
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,034
And done very well with them.

1002
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,370
<i>I've met</i>
<i>some mafia men in my life.</i>

1003
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,435
They won't threaten you
in any way.

1004
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,946
But if you do
something dishonest,

1005
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:27,810
most of the times,

1006
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,409
they don't give you
a second chance.

1007
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,655
So why did you walk away
from it yourself?

1008
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,886
Because I was told to.

1009
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:42,059
Rather, my wife was told
that I should

1010
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,292
leave.

1011
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,138
And no money in the worid
is worth

1012
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,504
just worrying about something.

1013
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,543
That's my wife.

1014
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:58,774
Artie, again?

1015
00:56:58,848 --> 00:56:59,906
Now, Terry.

1016
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,075
Are you enjoying this?

1017
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,279
Damn it.
You're some kind of nut.

1018
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:09,453
Okay. They're finished,
Terry, all right?

1019
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,828
<i>Finally, after three years</i>
<i>of FBI investigation,</i>

1020
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:25,374
<i>the government launched one of</i>
<i>the most ambitious</i>
<i>obscenity trials ever mounted.</i>

1021
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:28,774
<i>Designed to nail</i> Deep Throat
<i>and all pornographic films</i>

1022
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,312
<i>once and for all.</i>

1023
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:36,148
<i>I think this case was</i>
<i>a case of prosecution</i>

1024
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:39,253
<i>that was directed,</i>
<i>orchestrated,</i>

1025
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,586
uh, from Washington, D.C.

1026
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,122
<i>All told, 117 people</i>
<i>were charged with conspiracy:</i>

1027
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:51,159
<i>From the distributor</i>
<i>to the projectionist.</i>

1028
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,724
<i>And one man,</i>

1029
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,862
<i>the government intended to</i>
<i>make an example of.</i>

1030
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,838
<i>The director had immunity.</i>

1031
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,569
<i>The star had immunity,</i>

1032
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,508
<i>but the actor did not.</i>

1033
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,646
The theory was,
if you prosecuted the star

1034
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:14,417
then nobody would ever
wanna make a film like this.

1035
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,857
And you could drive
the industry out of business.

1036
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,060
Harry Reems was paid $250
to appear in <i>Deep Throat.</i>

1037
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,262
He had no control,

1038
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,831
no say, no input

1039
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:30,804
with what the final version
of this film was gonna be

1040
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,434
or whether it was gonna be
distributed interstate,

1041
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,738
intrastate, intergalactic.

1042
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:37,211
<i>It's impressive,</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

1043
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,713
<i>in the history</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

1044
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:41,113
<i>an artist has ever been</i>
<i>brought to trial</i>
<i>by the government.</i>

1045
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,844
<i>All of the trials</i>
<i>have been prosecuted</i>

1046
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:47,583
<i>by a young assistant</i>
<i>US attorney</i>
<i>named Larry Parrish,</i>

1047
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:50,490
<i>a lay Protestant preacher</i>
<i>who has been quoted as saying</i>

1048
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,961
<i>he'd rather get smut off</i>
<i>the streets of Memphis</i>
<i>than dope.</i>

1049
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,397
Larry Parrish is the...
About one of the finest people

1050
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,367
I've ever known
in my entire life.

1051
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:01,727
<i>Fine guy.</i>

1052
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,103
<i>And on top of that</i>
<i>he's, uh,</i>
<i>he's movie star quality.</i>

1053
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:07,404
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>he was very tall.</i>

1054
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:09,445
And I hate tall people.

1055
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:11,410
Uh...

1056
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,506
But he was also
very arrogant.

1057
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,508
If you're gonna dance,
you need to pay the piper.

1058
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,451
And, uh, I'm the piper.

1059
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:21,086
You've got to be accountable
under the law.

1060
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:23,316
It was like
when some people know

1061
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,123
that they have
the answer to everything

1062
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,959
and everybody else
is... is... is... is totally wrong.

1063
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,431
It was purely and simply
a matter of law enforcement.

1064
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,199
And I guess if there was
any passion in it for me,

1065
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,173
it was that, um,

1066
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:44,543
these are laws
that had not been enforced.

1067
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:46,813
And I knew of no reason

1068
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:49,010
why they should
not be enforced.

1069
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,483
<i>To make his case,</i>

1070
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:53,386
<i>Larry Parrish invoked</i>
<i>a highly unusual use</i>

1071
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:55,014
<i>of the conspiracy laws.</i>

1072
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:58,193
The government explained
their conspiracy theory

1073
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,229
in the terms of a train.

1074
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,265
<i>That if the train starts</i>
<i>in Los Ángeles</i>

1075
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,599
<i>and you get on in Los Ángeles,</i>

1076
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,996
<i>and you ride to Denver</i>
<i>and get off,</i>

1077
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,574
<i>but the train continues</i>
<i>on to Memphis,</i>

1078
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:16,076
<i>you are legally responsible</i>
<i>for the entire journey.</i>

1079
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:19,910
And if you're responsible
for everything
that takes place,

1080
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,814
you have unlimited liability.

1081
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:25,650
This was a very creative use
of the law of conspiracy

1082
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,953
and prosecutors
should never be creative.

1083
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,884
That's not their job.

1084
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,187
If my mother
had been involved,

1085
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:34,524
she would
have been indicted.

1086
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,498
I will promise you that.
Uh, she wasn't.

1087
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:41,232
When you tell artists,
bad artists or good artists,

1088
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:43,771
that they cannot experiment
in certain avenues,

1089
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,400
you are taking away
the basic freedoms
of every American.

1090
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:49,176
For some reason, though,

1091
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,681
it was as if
he is involved in art.

1092
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,946
And so art is protected.

1093
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:59,221
Well, not by the definition
of the Supreme Court.

1094
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,518
<i>Maybe I'm disgusting</i>
<i>in some peoples' eyes.</i>

1095
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,456
Maybe others are bored by me.

1096
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,086
But there are no laws against
acting in these films.

1097
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:09,225
<i>And the actors</i>
<i>and the actresses,</i>

1098
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:11,556
<i>I really hesitate</i>
<i>to call them that.</i>

1099
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:15,867
They are prostitutes
and whoremongers

1100
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,139
On the screen.

1101
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,675
I'm sorry,
that's just all they are.

1102
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,610
And, uh...

1103
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,574
Uh, they...

1104
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:30,744
They don't even believe
that there is any law.

1105
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,813
How do you communicate
to those persons

1106
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,288
that this is against the law?

1107
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,020
I face five years in jail.

1108
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:42,656
Do I belong in jail
for five years
for acting in <i>Deep Throat,</i>

1109
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,495
which is not
in violation of the law?

1110
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,501
<i>If seeing this motion picture</i>

1111
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,543
<i>as many times as</i>
<i>Larry Parrish has seen it</i>

1112
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:58,478
<i>has not corrupted him,</i>
<i>or made him into a sex addict,</i>

1113
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,948
than I think
that's, uh, proof positive

1114
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:05,215
that these films do not have
a deleterious effect
on the human being.

1115
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,082
I'm sitting here right now

1116
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,454
trying to draw some images up
from <i>Deep Throat.</i>

1117
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:11,652
To be honest about it, uh,

1118
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:15,296
do I feel that I'm worse off
because of it?

1119
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:16,831
Yes, I do.

1120
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,493
Uh, I can't get images
out of my mind

1121
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,333
that I have seen.

1122
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,673
I have told people
I'm not a eunuch.

1123
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:32,340
I- I'm a regular
red-blooded American male.

1124
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,849
And, uh,

1125
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,113
and those images
I wish were not there.

1126
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:42,115
<i>We had a lot of eye contact</i>
<i>with the jury.</i>

1127
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:45,354
<i>I think the jury</i>
<i>was very sympathetic</i>
<i>to Harry.</i>

1128
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,329
And there was
a palpable change

1129
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,497
in the jury's reaction

1130
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:55,099
to Harry
after seeing him in the film.

1131
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,598
<i>That was one of the amusing</i>
<i>times in the trial.</i>

1132
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,266
He sat over in a, uh,

1133
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,742
in a corner by himself,
sort of hoverin'

1134
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,043
and wouldn't look at
the jurors,

1135
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,877
and they were all
staring at him.

1136
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,856
I felt as though
my life was being
taken away from me.

1137
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,893
And that I was
being depicted, characterized

1138
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,358
as something evil,
a demon.

1139
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,597
<i>After a two-month trial,</i>

1140
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,832
<i>the jury took just five hours</i>

1141
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,705
<i>to return</i>
<i>a unanimously guilty verdict.</i>

1142
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,676
The substance of what you say,

1143
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:39,374
in effect,
is you were the little man
who wasn't there.

1144
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:40,847
But the fact
of the matter is,

1145
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,010
you deliberately
and knowingly

1146
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,712
committed a long series

1147
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:47,517
of immoral, revolting,
obscene acts.

1148
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,581
You might have found it
obscene, and immoral,

1149
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,149
and distasteful,
and disgusting.

1150
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,216
Others don't.

1151
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:55,560
The acts you performed on film
are acts that would be crimes

1152
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,122
if they were performed
on the street
or someplace else.

1153
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,567
No. They are wonderful
celebrations of life.

1154
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:01,898
They're called sex,
Mr. Cohn.

1155
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,199
You just can't cloak yourself
with the American flag

1156
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:05,706
because you don't fit
the image.

1157
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:09,211
You talk as though
the <i>Bill of Rights</i>
was created just for you.

1158
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:20,019
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in US history,</i>

1159
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:23,547
<i>an actor had been convicted</i>
<i>for merely playing a part.</i>

1160
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,691
<i>And Harry Reems</i>
<i>faced five years in jail.</i>

1161
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,691
<i>It did not bode well</i>
<i>for the future</i>

1162
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,233
of any kind of aesthetic
or artistic expression

1163
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,269
in this country,
in any of the arts,

1164
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,338
much less this poor guy

1165
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:40,271
<i>who, you know,</i>
<i>suddenly finds himself</i>
<i>being made a scapegoat.</i>

1166
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,134
<i>All in the interest of</i>

1167
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,112
a basically moral crusade.

1168
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,278
<i>What was behind</i>
<i>the case in Memphis</i>

1169
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:53,549
<i>was the religious right.</i>

1170
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,524
<i>This is the first</i>
<i>real incarnation</i>

1171
01:04:56,592 --> 01:05:00,688
<i>of trying to apply</i>
<i>their conception of morality</i>

1172
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:02,931
to all of America.

1173
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:07,827
<i>In response,</i>

1174
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:11,065
<i>Hollywood was quick</i>
<i>to mobilize and defend</i>
<i>Harry Reems,</i>

1175
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:14,574
<i>positioning itself as</i>
<i>an opposing cultural force.</i>

1176
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,636
<i>Professionals in the arts</i>

1177
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,011
<i>may not find</i> Deep Throat,
<i>as such,</i>

1178
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,414
<i>a piece of art</i>
<i>worth defending.</i>

1179
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:24,051
<i>But they are worried about</i>

1180
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,145
<i>the threat of</i>
<i>being arrested later on</i>

1181
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,884
<i>for what</i>
<i>they write or act in today.</i>

1182
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,585
<i>It's a censorship issue.</i>

1183
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,596
<i>My overall concern</i>
<i>is the basic, uh, infringement</i>

1184
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:36,359
<i>on the rights</i>
<i>of the First Amendment.</i>

1185
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,696
That's probably why
I came to his defense,

1186
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,396
knowing that
Beatty and Nicholson did.

1187
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:45,663
That's how
I make all my decisions.

1188
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:50,074
I said,
"Alan, am... am... am I
gonna be convicted?

1189
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:51,578
"Am I going to do
prison time?"

1190
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,547
And his response was:

1191
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,745
"If the Republicans
are reelected,

1192
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,617
you're going to jail.

1193
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:03,718
If the Democrats are elected,
you're going to be set free."

1194
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,293
<i>While Harry fought for</i>
<i>his freedom,</i>

1195
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,061
<i>the architect of</i>
<i>the moral crusade</i>
<i>in the first place</i>

1196
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:15,126
<i>was no longer in office</i>
<i>to savor his triumph.</i>

1197
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:19,066
<i>I shall resign the Presidency</i>
<i>effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

1198
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:25,275
<i>And his undoing</i>
<i>had also been Deep Throat,</i>

1199
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:28,440
<i>the nickname for</i>
<i>the secret Watergate source.</i>

1200
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,982
<i>There's an expression</i>
<i>in journalism</i>

1201
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,112
<i>called "deep background"</i>
<i>which means that</i>

1202
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:36,352
<i>the information cannot be used</i>
<i>in the newspaper</i>

1203
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:39,622
<i>with any kind of</i>
<i>hint of attribution.</i>

1204
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:43,591
<i>Deep Throat,</i> deep background.
You know, it's sort of a...

1205
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,725
# <i>But if you want to know</i>
<i>how I really feel</i> #

1206
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:49,532

<i>How do you like it?</i> #

1209
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,277
The time was right
for a porno star
to be a pop star.

1210
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,474
Who would have
ever thought?

1211
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,050
# <i>How do you like it?</i> #

1212
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,779

That's it. That's all of it.

1216
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,692
It gets repeated
and repeated and repeated.

1217
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:14,656
It means nothing.

1227
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,551
<i>A year ago,</i>

1228
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,254
a Memphis federal court
convicted actor Harry Reems

1229
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,796
on obscenity charges
in connection with his role

1230
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:50,525
in the film <i>Deep Throat.</i>

1231
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:53,898
Today, a US District Judge
in Memphis overturned
that conviction,

1232
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:56,563
saying that
the actor's activities
took place before

1233
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:59,573
the 1973 Supreme Court
obscenity ruling.

1234
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,707
<i>Now that my name</i>
<i>was... was pretty recognizable,</i>

1235
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:06,242
<i>I moved to LA,</i>

1236
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:09,079
thinking that
certainly somebody
would come along and say:

1237
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:11,142
"Well,
there's a sellable name."

1238
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,222
<i>Allan Carr had produced</i>
<i>and directed films,</i>

1239
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:15,882
<i>uh, for Paramount.</i>

1240
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,425
And he called me one day
and said,

1241
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,552
"I'd like you
to play the role

1242
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:22,722
of the high school coach
in the movie <i>Grease. "</i>

1243
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:25,590
<i>I was excited that</i>
<i>I was given an opportunity.</i>

1244
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:27,033
<i>Then about two</i>
<i>or three weeks</i>

1245
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,627
<i>before principal</i>
<i>photography began,</i>

1246
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:32,366
<i>Paramount Pictures</i>
<i>removed me from the cast.</i>

1247
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,376
<i>That they didn't feel</i>
<i>as though I belonged</i>

1248
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:38,706
<i>in a mainstream</i>
<i>motion picture.</i>

1249
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:41,278
<i>And the lights went on</i>
<i>for me.</i>

1250
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:43,215
I had branded myself

1251
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:46,014
and, uh, given myself
a certain stigma.

1252
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,250
<i>I just started</i>
<i>to drink every night,</i>

1253
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:50,991
looking for an escape,

1254
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:54,154
looking for a little bit
of lightheartedness.

1255
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:55,629
And, you know,

1256
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:59,691
it just led me into
a terrible, terrible disease

1257
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,895
of alcoholism
and drug addiction.

1258
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,202
What are you doin'?

1259
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:07,102
An antidote.
I'm mixing an antidote.

1260
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,210
<i>I remember</i>
<i>the last movies I was on,</i>

1261
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:10,768
<i>I couldn't even walk.</i>

1262
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,246
<i>I mean, literally,</i>
<i>they had to carry me to a seat</i>

1263
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,341
and I'd shoot
the whole motion picture
sitting in a seat,

1264
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:18,443
delivering lines, drunk.

1265
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,983
<i>I was so drunk</i>
<i>and so drugged up at the time</i>

1266
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:26,892
<i>that I couldn't do</i>
<i>sex scenes.</i>

1267
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,024
Oh, my head.

1268
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,157
<i>They'd carry me off the set</i>

1269
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:34,725
and somebody would get me home
and I'd drink some more

1270
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,601
and they'd pick me up
and take me back the next day.

1271
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,731
It's all a blur.
It's all a blur.

1272
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,213
<i>I lost my home.</i>

1273
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,010
<i>I lost my career.</i>

1274
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,515
<i>I lost my friends,</i>

1275
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:52,781
<i>and ended up, literally,</i>

1276
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,018
<i>panhandling in the streets</i>
<i>on Sunset Boulevard.</i>

1277
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:59,485
<i>Harry's personal defeat</i>

<i>Freedom! Freedom!</i>

1282
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,709
<i>Culture took</i>
<i>a reactionary turn</i>

1283
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,937
<i>after what seemed like</i>
<i>we were on, uh, heading</i>

1284
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:19,776
toward a climax of
the sexual revolution

1285
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:22,442
that we never
actually, uh, attained.

1286
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,746
<i>In the 1970s,</i>

1287
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:30,019
the worst censors
in the country

1288
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:32,792
suddenly became the feminists.

1289
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:36,594
<i>The so-called</i>
<i>sexual revolution</i>

1290
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:40,123
<i>in this country</i>
<i>has not been liberating</i>
<i>for women.</i>

1291
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:43,194
<i>It's the way that pornography</i>
<i>invades the popular culture...</i>

1292
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:46,105
<i>It's becoming increasingly</i>
<i>socially acceptable.</i>

1293
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,670
<i>The role that</i>
<i>you have selected for women</i>

1294
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:50,803
is degrading to women

1295
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,904
because you choose to see
women as sex objects

1296
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,279
not as full human beings.

1297
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,079
Well, obviously...
Hold on. The day that...

1298
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,251
Obviously...
I haven't finished.

1299
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:01,255
The day that you are willing
to come out here

1300
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:03,689
with a cottontail
attached to your rear end...

1301
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:09,295
When the women's movement
began to attack sex in general

1302
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:10,423
and men in general,

1303
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:11,557
I was...

1304
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:12,999
I was at a loss for words

1305
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,696
because these were
our partners

1306
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:18,170
in a revolution
to really change

1307
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,231
uh, sexual values.

1308
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:21,670
I'm more in sympathy

1309
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,735
than perhaps, uh, you know,
the giris realize...

1310
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:24,870
Women.

1311
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,005
I'm sorry.

1312
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:27,105
Yes. I'm 35.

1313
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:28,581
Than the ladies realize.

1314
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,676
I use "giris" referring to
women of all ages.

1315
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,277
You should stop.

1316
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,379
If you want to
be called a boy.

1317
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,481
I see. Okay. Um...

1318
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:42,462
The idea was
to convince people

1319
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:47,294
that there were good, sound,
feminist, humanitarian reasons

1320
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,428
to be against pornography.

1321
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,771
<i>Women Against Pornography</i>
<i>found a surprising ally</i>

1322
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:57,300
<i>in America's most famous</i>
<i>porn star: Linda Lovelace,</i>

1323
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,937
<i>who had retired</i>
<i>from the spotlight</i>

1324
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:00,447
<i>and was now</i>
<i>a mother and housewife.</i>

1325
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:05,950
<i>Linda Lovelace is, uh, here.</i>

1326
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:07,921
The book is titled,
uh, <i>Ordeal.</i>

1327
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,151
And I'll tell you,
this book is a very, uh,

1328
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:12,523
explicit recounting
of what happened to you.

1329
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:14,892
I felt it was important to let

1330
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,590
everything out
that happened to me.

1331
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,167
I literally became a prisoner
of Mr. Traynor's.

1332
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,634
<i>I wasn't permitted to go to</i>
<i>the bathroom by myself.</i>

1333
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:23,728
<i>I was never allowed</i>
<i>out of his eyesight.</i>

1334
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,205
<i>If he took a shower,</i>
<i>I had to take a shower</i>
<i>with him.</i>

1335
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:29,676
If I did have
any kind of communication
with my friends or my family,

1336
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:31,542
he was on the extension
with a.45

1337
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:34,343
or an M-16
semi-automatic machine gun
pointed at me.

1338
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:38,244
And there are those who say
you can see the bruises
on her in the film.

1339
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,454
You tell me if the bruises
are visible in the film.

1340
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,426
How did Linda Lovelace and
Gloria Steinem join forces?

1341
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:48,053
How did the two of you
get together?

1342
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,963
I saw Linda
on the <i>Phil Donahue Show.</i>

1343
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:54,833
And she was
being questioned by Phil,

1344
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,633
who I think is usually
a more sensitive questioner

1345
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,401
than he was this time,

1346
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:02,807
uh, and by the audience,
with enormous disbelief.

1347
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:04,842
And I still find it
very hard to believe

1348
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:06,904
that you have become
a changed person.

1349
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,542
I had always heard
that to be hypnotized,
you had to be willing.

1350
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:12,143
Is there something about
the way you were raised,
in your view,

1351
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,688
that made you
vulnerable to this?

1352
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,223
And yet
she was still being asked,

1353
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,122
uh, what in her background

1354
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,821
had led her to become
essentially a hostage.

1355
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,121
What did lead you
to become a hostage,

1356
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,063
if we can... if we can now
ask the question?

1357
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,227
Does it go back beyond that
to your childhood,

1358
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:28,735
that you were
a susceptible person?

1359
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:29,861
No.

1360
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:33,032
See now what you're doing,
you're doing what... what
made me so angry.

1361
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:36,202
You know,
because we don't say
to the hostages in Iran:

1362
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:39,109
"What in your... what in
your background led you

1363
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:40,808
to... to be in that embassy?"
Yeah.

1364
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,874
The situations are not
nearly comparable.

1365
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:45,249
They are. It's force.

1366
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:49,446
<i>Linda needed somebody</i>
<i>to tell her what to do.</i>

1367
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,493
And as long as
she had somebody
telling her what to do,

1368
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:55,120
she... she was happy.

1369
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,459
So when she
made the movie,

1370
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:57,999
she was happy
making the movie.

1371
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:59,499
After the movie,
somebody said,

1372
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,297
"Hey, you shouldn't have
made that movie."

1373
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,496
So she became unhappy
about making the movie,

1374
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,232
which wasn't true.

1375
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:08,307
She was very happy
about making the movie.

1376
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:16,578
<i>Linda's new fame as</i>
<i>a crusader against pornography</i>

1377
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:20,679
<i>culminated with her testimony</i>
<i>before the Meese Commission</i>
<i>in 1986.</i>

1378
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:23,216
<i>My ordeal still goes on.</i>

1379
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,021
The film <i>Deep Throat</i>
still shows

1380
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:27,561
and virtually every time
someone watches that movie,

1381
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:29,995
they're watching me
being raped.

1382
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,191
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>the government had set out</i>

1383
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,201
<i>to determine</i>
<i>the effect of pornography.</i>

1384
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:37,238
<i>This time,</i>
<i>instead of relying on</i>
<i>scientific data,</i>

1385
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,137
<i>they relied on</i>
<i>personal testimony</i>

1386
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:42,143
<i>to prove that pornography</i>
<i>was a social evil.</i>

1387
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,145
Well, the other day
my 8-year-old son said to me:

1388
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,547
"Mommy,
if this country is so great,

1389
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,551
how come people
are still hurting you?"

1390
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,484
<i>It's sort of like</i>
<i>the</i> Oprah Show.

1391
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:55,489
It's, um, much more anecdotal.
Much less professional.

1392
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:58,819
<i>So what Nixon starts</i>
<i>in the '60s and '70s</i>

1393
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:00,361
<i>by stacking the court,</i>

1394
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:02,397
<i>Reagan finishes</i>
<i>with the Meese report.</i>

1395
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,398
<i>In its most controversial</i>
<i>finding,</i>

1396
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:05,660
<i>the commission concludes</i>

1397
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:08,362
<i>there is a relationship</i>
<i>between violence</i>
<i>and pornography.</i>

1398
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:11,132
<i>The commission conducted</i>
<i>no scientific studies.</i>

1399
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,277
<i>Finally,</i>
<i>after decades of struggle,</i>

1400
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,644
<i>politics triumphed over</i>
<i>pornography.</i>

1401
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,478
<i>But the victory was hollow.</i>

1402
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,983
<i>The success of</i> Deep Throat

1403
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,611
<i>created enormous demand</i>
<i>for hardcore,</i>

1404
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,746
<i>that new technology</i>
<i>could now satisfy</i>

1405
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,950
<i>and avoid all regulation.</i>

1406
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:33,589
The phenomenal sales of
home videocassette machines

1407
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:36,460
have opened up a new market
for erotic films.

1408
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,592
<i>It's a market</i>
<i>that barely existed</i>
<i>a couple of years ago.</i>

1409
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,569
But today,
30 to 50 percent of the tapes

1410
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:44,832
available for play
in these machines

1411
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,840
are hardcore pornography.

1412
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:59,921
Gerry Damiano,
I think, really thought

1413
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:03,986
that porn was going to
merge into, kind of,
Hollywood films.

1414
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,592
<i>That porn movies</i>

1415
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:13,066
<i>were gonna just get</i>
<i>bigger and bigger budgets</i>

1416
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:15,968
and become more like
feature films
with hardcore sex.

1417
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:20,106
Looked like it was going to
burst itself into something,
into an art form.

1418
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,300
That didn't happen.

1419
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,173
In fact,
just the opposite happened.

1420
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,473
Instead, it dwindled in-into
a mediocre commodity.

1421
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:33,054
<i>With the advent of</i>
<i>the video camera,</i>

1422
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:37,056
<i>it got to be so easy</i>
<i>to... to shoot X-rated video</i>

1423
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:39,284
that ev-everybody could do it.

1424
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,692
And then, the only ones
that did it

1425
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:44,459
were the ones that could do it
cheaper and cheaper,

1426
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,433
for less and less
and less money.

1427
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:53,169
<i>They were...</i>
<i>they were nothing.</i>

1428
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:56,039
<i>It was just</i>
<i>one sex scene after another.</i>

1429
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:58,510
<i>And it... it sort of</i>
<i>killed itself.</i>

1430
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:05,019
<i>I couldn't make</i>
<i>that kind of film.</i>

1431
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:08,020
Because there was...
there was no reason to.

1432
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,282
<i>It became a...</i>
<i>it became a factory.</i>

1433
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:15,120
<i>It was over.</i>

1434
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:17,791
<i>You didn't need</i>
<i>filmmakers anymore.</i>

1435
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,999
<i>As the adult industry grew,</i>

1436
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:27,132
<i>it neither needed</i>
<i>the rebel filmmaker</i>

1437
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:28,607
<i>who had pioneered it</i>

1438
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:31,544
<i>nor heeded</i>
<i>the feminist protest</i>
<i>against it.</i>

1439
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,808
<i>So finding herself redundant,</i>

1440
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:36,908
<i>Linda Lovelace</i>
<i>moved with her family</i>
<i>to Denver</i>

1441
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,215
<i>to try and start a new life.</i>

1442
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,548
Um, that's Mom at her desk.

1443
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,057
Uh, she was the manager
of the mailroom.

1444
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:48,392
She was proud of her new desk.

1445
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:49,957
Um...

1446
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,732
They fired her
when they found out about LL.

1447
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:54,462
<i>It happened a lot.</i>

1448
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,299
<i>You know, I've lost two jobs</i>

1449
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,571
<i>because of the name</i>
<i>Linda Lovelace.</i>

1450
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:06,375
<i>And, uh,</i>
<i>that-that's kind of...</i>

1451
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:07,574
<i>That hurts.</i>

1452
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:10,015
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I was always defending myself</i>

1453
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:12,883
<i>after, what, 25 years.</i>

1454
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:15,881
<i>I don't have to do that</i>
<i>too much anymore.</i>

1455
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:18,653
So I've decided
it's time for me
to do what I can

1456
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,627
to earn an income

1457
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:24,755
from, uh, the abuse that
I went through from the name.

1458
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,393
<i>Broke and out of work,</i>

1459
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:30,836
<i>Linda returned to the worid</i>
<i>she had once condemned.</i>

1460
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:37,545
<i>You know, I think it's kind of</i>
<i>nice looking sexy</i>

1461
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:39,341
and... and still
looking attractive at 51.

1462
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:43,009
So, I didn't feel
there was anything wrong
with doing it.

1463
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,114
<i>Many feminists</i>
<i>who have written,</i>

1464
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:46,484
<i>you know, books...</i>

1465
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:50,321
<i>And they're always using</i>
<i>the name Linda Lovelace,</i>
<i>and what happened to me.</i>

1466
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,917
I don't get
any royalties from that.

1467
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:56,293
And it doesn't take much
to keep me happy.

1468
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:58,525
You know?
I get to be with
my grandchildren,

1469
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,160
around my children,
and that's my joy.

1470
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:16,947
She died penniless.
Didn't have a dime.

1471
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,545
Didn't have a dime.

1472
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,288
And they all got rich.

1473
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,020
They all got
their hands in the pocket.

1474
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:34,427
<i>Fuck me harder,</i>
<i>harder, harder.</i>

1475
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:37,671
<i>Sex is a force,</i>
<i>it's a force like lava.</i>

1476
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,833
And there haven't been
too many successful
engineering projects

1477
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,739
about diverting
the flow of lava.

1478
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:48,339
Did I ever see
the movie <i>Deep Throat?</i>
No.

1479
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:49,609
Should I?

1480
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:52,585
No. That's with, um,
that lady who died.

1481
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:53,746
What's her name?

1482
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,090
No, I have not seen it.

1483
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:05,322
<i>Deep Throat</i> forged
the sexual revolution

1484
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:08,100
<i>for good or bad.</i>

1485
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,797
<i>It led to the porno business.</i>

1486
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:14,205
<i>Linda Lovelace turned it,</i>
<i>and</i> Deep Throat <i>turned it,</i>
<i>into an industry.</i>

1487
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:15,569
And like it or hate it,

1488
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:17,838
that's what she's gonna be
remembered for, forever.

1489
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:23,851
<i>Porn really does have</i>
<i>a yucky feel to it today.</i>

1490
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,478
<i>Part of it, I think,</i>
<i>that was lost is this,</i>
<i>a certain innocence.</i>

1491
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:31,150
For that brief moment,
porn was part of

1492
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:33,387
discovery, curiosity,

1493
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:35,590
change.

1494
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:38,295
Today it's different.

1495
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:40,393
<i>What happened</i>

1496
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:43,403
<i>was that a very cynical</i>
<i>pornography industry</i>

1497
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:46,406
came in on the heels
of the First Amendment

1498
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:49,671
and began coining money
hand over fist.

1499
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:54,148
<i>So, it changed the nature</i>
<i>of... of pornographic sex,</i>

1500
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:55,945
<i>from art to money.</i>

1501
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,412
<i>Money is not interested in</i>
<i>the little alleys</i>

1502
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:03,917
of endeavor...
of artistic endeavor.

1503
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,252
<i>It wants the main highway.</i>

1504
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,727
<i>It's a really dramatic fact</i>

1505
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:17,601
<i>that we have gone</i>
<i>from people staring up</i>
<i>at a marquee</i>

1506
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,469
<i>and thinking</i>
<i>"What can deep throat mean?</i>

1507
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:21,439
<i>Surely not</i>
<i>what I'm thinking"</i>

1508
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:24,808
to kids who don't
consider it sex.

1509
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:37,121
<i>They perverted it</i>
<i>instead of improving it.</i>

1510
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:40,825
<i>They took a beautiful thing</i>
<i>that God gave mankind,</i>

1511
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,831
and they perverted it.
And the results are obvious.

1512
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,389
All you have to do
is look around.

1513
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:53,964
Deep Throat's
<i>legacy goes beyond</i>

1514
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:57,340
<i>the sexually saturated culture</i>
<i>that surrounds us today</i>

1515
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,279
<i>and reaches back to</i>
<i>the beginnings</i>
<i>of a culture war</i>

1516
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:02,748
<i>that divides us</i>
<i>as never before.</i>

1517
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:19,030
Deep Throat <i>was less about</i>
<i>the joys of oral sex</i>

1518
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,297
<i>than it was about the freedom</i>
<i>to speak out against shame</i>

1519
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:23,735
<i>and hypocrisy.</i>

1520
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:27,503
<i>The FCC has fined</i>
<i>169 stations to pay...</i>

1521
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:29,668
<i>Congress is also</i>
<i>cracking down...</i>

1522
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,609
<i>Three Supreme Court justices</i>

1523
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,547
<i>are expected to retire</i>
<i>over the next four years.</i>

1524
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,777
<i>Each of these 169...</i>

1525
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:44,820
<i>Today, there are people</i>
<i>in the Department of Justice</i>

1526
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:48,590
<i>in high places,</i>
<i>sympathetic with</i>
<i>obscenity laws.</i>

1527
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:51,059
I think today

1528
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:54,458
the climate is
even more ripe

1529
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,567
for vigorous enforcement
of obscenity laws.

1530
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,806
<i>Now if we could get</i>
<i>these terrorists to go away</i>

1531
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,342
<i>And quit taking up</i>
<i>so much time of the,</i>

1532
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:07,904
<i>uh, of</i>
<i>the Department of Justice...</i>

1533
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,212
All right?

1534
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:14,414
Thank you.

1535
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:15,786
You're welcome.

Deep Throat.

1556

And they all, you know...

1557
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,742
When they refer to Artie,
you know,

1558
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:20,747
he has a deep throat, so.

1559
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:23,947
They say,
"You know the guy with
the deep throat, you know?

1560
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:26,350
"He's the one that did
<i>Deep Throat. "</i>

1561
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:30,422
We always have to emphasize
that we didn't do it,
you know.

1562
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:33,552
We just distributed it.
Because, he wouldn't...

1563
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:35,926
I don't think he would...
Would you ever do that?

1564
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:37,794
I wouldn't know how.
I knew it!

1565
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:40,664
But if you did know how,
would you do it?

1566
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:43,569
You have to think
about that?

1567
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:44,797

1588
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:26,430
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>there should be more to sex</i>

1589
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:29,231
<i>Than a lot of little tingles.</i>

1590
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:33,840
<i>There should be bells ringing,</i>

1591
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:37,275

<i>bombs going off, something.</i>

1592
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:46,649
<i>Find the solution.</i>

01:28:46,721 --> 01:28:47,745
<i>Like what?</i>

01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:49,050
<i>Like deep throat.</i>

<i>Deep throat.</i>

1602

<i>Oh, Dr. Young.</i>
