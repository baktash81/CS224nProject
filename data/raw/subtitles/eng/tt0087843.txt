Where is he? Where is he hiding?

23
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:54,543
I don't know. I've been looking
for him since yesterday.

24
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,713
Oh.

25
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,927
I'm gonna ask you for the
last time. Where is he?

26
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,930
I don't know.

27
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,851
What are you gonna do to him?

28
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,455
You stay here in case
that rat shows up.

29
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,374
Okay.

30
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,602
Who you protecting,
you dumb asshole?

31
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,314
A stoolie who rats
on his own friends?

32
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,487
They were your friends too.

33
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,622
I got it. You wanna end
up like that bitch, huh?

34
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,974
At Chun Lao's. Chinese theatre.

35
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,318
You stay here with
this barrel of shit.

36
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:10,197
Noodles. Noodles. Noodles.

37
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,293
Easy, easy...

38
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,629
This way. Hurry.

39
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,216
There down. Mott
Street. Go. Go. Go.

40
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,900
Noodles.

41
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,783
Noodles.

42
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,913
Noodles.

43
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,124
Untie me.

44
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:08,670
Stay that way. No, stay. I
want them to know I did it.

45
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,968
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go get Eve.

46
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,179
Don't.

47
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,355
Why?

48
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,530
They... They already been there.

49
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,725
Do you need anything?

50
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,269
Money?

51
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:15,445
- I got more than I need.
- Yeah, it's all yours now.

52
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,320
Where to?

53
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,121
Sir, where do you want to go?

54
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,711
Anywhere. First bus.

55
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,884
Buffalo?

56
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,555
One way.

57
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,560
That'll be $1.20.

58
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,195
I wanna rent a car.

59
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,864
Would you fill this out, please?

60
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:15,555
- Go, go.
- Go ahead, shoot the dice, man.

61
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,267
Shoot the dice. Shoot the
dice. Shoot the dice.

62
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:24,063
That's right. That's
right, man. That's right.

63
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,669
Noodles.

64
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,297
I brought back the
key to your clock.

65
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,350
Lock the door.

66
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,324
When did you get back?

67
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:50,371
- Today.
- Why?

68
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:56,210
- They got in touch with me.
- Who?

69
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,504
I thought you might know.

70
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,256
Me?

71
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:04,010
I don't know nothing
about nobody no more.

72
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,201
You gonna offer me a drink?

73
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,704
Yeah, forgive me. Sure. Of course.

74
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,915
Please sit down.

75
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,527
Who's Robert Williams?

76
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,113
I am.

77
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,325
"We wish to inform you
that following the

78
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:17,708
sale of the Beth
Israel Cemetery..."

79
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,243
Yeah, the synagogue
sent these out if

80
00:31:20,244 --> 00:31:22,296
you wanted to relocate
your loved ones.

81
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,257
I got the same letter on
account of my father.

82
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,805
Only the synagogue didn't send
that. I got that last week.

83
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,766
The rabbi told me he sent those
out about eight months ago.

84
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,395
Yeah, that's right. That's
just about when I got mine.

85
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,858
So, what else did
he say, the rabbi?

86
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,654
He said that I was lucky. The
bodies of Philip Stein...

87
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:51,617
Maximilian Bercovicz, Patrick
Goldberg were already spoken for.

88
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:56,122
And they were up in a very
fancy cemetery in Riverdale.

89
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,544
What's this all mean?

90
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,546
It means...

91
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,165
"Noodles, though
you've been hiding in

92
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:10,720
the asshole of the
world, we found you.

93
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,805
We know where you are."

94
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,391
It means...

95
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,560
"Get ready."

96
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,480
For what?

97
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,778
That's the one thing
it didn't say.

98
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,768
What do you think?

99
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:03,064
I think the answer's here.
That's why I came back.

100
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:25,044
I moved everything in here.

101
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,927
I had to sell the
house, the backroom.

102
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,751
You know, I always
thought you might have

103
00:33:36,752 --> 00:33:39,100
helped yourself to
that million bucks.

104
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,435
But now I know.

105
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,355
No.

106
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,567
You're on your ass
worse than ever.

107
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,446
But I thought it was you who...

108
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,990
No, you thought wrong.

109
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,829
The suitcase was empty.

110
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,375
Then who took it?

111
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,508
That's what I've been
asking myself for 35 years.

112
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:27,022
If it bothers you,
I can sleep here.

113
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,318
- You can have my room.
- No. It's okay.

114
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:54,842
- How's your sister?
- I ain't seen her for years.

115
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,012
She's a big star now.

116
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,725
We should have known, huh?

117
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,062
You can always tell the
winners at the starting gate.

118
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,734
You can always tell the winners,
and you can tell the losers.

119
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,738
Who would've put a penny on you?

120
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,659
I'd have put everything
I ever had on you.

121
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,998
Yeah, and you would've lost.

122
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:42,348
Well, you're beat. Good night.

123
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:45,226
Good night, Moe. Thanks.

124
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,609
What have you been
doing all these years?

125
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,615
Been going to bed early.

126
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,907
Deborah, Papa says
you should help.

127
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,700
No.

128
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,246
We've got customers all over.
We can't do everything.

129
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:01,083
Try. I've got my
elocution lessons.

130
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:56,430
Fat, you better spray the toilet.
I saw a cockroach in there.

131
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:13,947
Sorry.

132
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,249
Sorry, I can't make it
today. See you tomorrow.

133
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,418
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

134
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,428
Sorry, Fats.

135
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,146
- Noodles.
- Bugsy's got a job for us.

136
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,315
Hurry up. He don't wait.

137
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,017
Who you calling a cockroach?

138
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,354
So, what are you? You're
filthy, you make me sick.

139
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:31,692
You crawl up toilet walls just
like a roach. So, what are you?

140
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,402
Let go.

141
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:37,322
I make you sick, huh? Then how
come you showed me your tush?

142
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,075
To a roach.

143
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:47,040
Go look at yourself,
David Aaronson.

144
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,987
She don't leave me
alone, I'm gonna

145
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:05,851
give her what she's asking for.

146
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:08,562
- What's Bugsy want?
- We gotta wake up a deadbeat.

147
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,857
That schmuck at the
news stand didn't pay.

148
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,075
Here's your money, sir.

149
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,347
It's beautiful.

150
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:32,687
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Look at it, it looks great. Wow.

151
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,739
Come on, guys.

152
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:53,125
Come on, come on.

153
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,086
Now make up your mind.

154
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,881
- Noodles, let's take the dollar.
- Yeah.

155
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,592
Skip, here you go.

156
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,221
That one.

157
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,473
Him.

158
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,226
Hey, Sam, I'll see
you next Thursday.

159
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:15,313
- That one.
- Hey, and bring your wife along.

160
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:17,691
Are you nuts?

161
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:22,279
Bugsy said we could take the
dollar or we could roll the drunk.

162
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,531
Yeah, but he ain't even drunk yet.

163
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,741
We'll wait.

164
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,342
Well, you roll that
one over there.

165
00:46:32,343 --> 00:46:34,541
What's to roll? He drunk it all.

166
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,506
Bounce that little shikker.

167
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,973
Jacket.

168
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,194
It's Fartface.

169
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,115
Shit.

170
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,911
We should've took the dollar.

171
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,957
Could've had 10 hot corned-beef
sandwiches on poppy-seed rolls.

172
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:14,474
Look, the wagon will hide us
from Fartface. Get ready.

173
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,880
Now. Throw your jacket over him.

174
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,605
Hey, mister, you
sick? Aw, poor guy,

175
00:48:50,606 --> 00:48:53,096
you'll be okay. Come
on, I'll help you.

176
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,890
Come on, up you go.

177
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,727
Now, you're worse
than my Uncle Nathan.

178
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,528
Why do you want to get soused? You

179
00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:02,355
can't even walk.
I'll take you home.

180
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,357
Go, Mama.

181
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,578
Stop right there. Hey, you.
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

182
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,332
What the hell are you
kids doing here? Huh?

183
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:24,127
- What are we kids doing here?
- We're getting it up the ass.

184
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,881
Yeah, getting screwed. Is
there a law against it?

185
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,243
Can you spare a
dime for pisherkehs

186
00:49:30,244 --> 00:49:32,010
that just got it up the ass?

187
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,929
Come on, get out of here.
Come on, get off the street.

188
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,515
Go on, get out of here.
Get off the street.

189
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,143
Go ahead. And don't come back.

190
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,897
I don't want to ever see
you here again. All right?

191
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,349
Hey, stop by for you later.

192
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,104
Yeah, but knock here
on the John first.

193
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:28,575
My old man's praying,
and my old lady's

194
00:50:28,576 --> 00:50:30,985
crying. And the
light's turned off.

195
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:35,782
What the hell should I go home
for? At least in here I can read.

196
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,765
- Where are you going?
- Mama, don't get worked up.

197
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,850
You got pots to clean.

198
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,148
Peggeleh?

199
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,734
I'll be right back, Ma.
I gotta go to the can.

200
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,410
Hi, Peggy.

201
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,205
At least you could lock the door.

202
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,084
Don't you like it?

203
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:18,968
I've seen better.

204
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,055
- You seen lots?
- How many you seen?

205
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:25,391
I'll tell you how many. None.

206
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,731
Let me see yours.

207
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,915
Looksies, no feelsies.

208
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:55,880
Peggy. Peggy, I...

209
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,758
I want...

210
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:02,095
- You like it, don't you?
- Not for free, I don't.

211
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,561
You bring me a Charlotte
russe with whipped

212
00:53:04,562 --> 00:53:06,516
cream, then you can
do anything you like.

213
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,477
Tomorrow. I'll bring
it to you tomorrow.

214
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:12,647
- I'll bring it tomorrow.
- Look, I don't give credit.

215
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,315
I promise. I promise.

216
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:18,778
You better stop squeezing me,
or I'm gonna poop in my pants.

217
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,494
Well, are you getting out?

218
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,462
Come on, come on.

219
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,866
Give me six copies.

220
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,537
Drop your pants and I'll
stick it to you again.

221
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:59,253
- What do you mean, "again"?
- That's a long story.

222
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,714
And look what time it is.

223
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:06,427
It's already 6:34. And I gotta go.

224
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,806
Boy, I got a lot of work to do.

225
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,517
Hold it a minute.

226
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:17,480
Now it's 6:35. And I ain't
got a damn thing to do.

227
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:21,275
Just you wait, asshole. I'll
do something with your time.

228
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,777
Wait. Hey.

229
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,238
Since we're talking about time...

230
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:29,158
it looks like you're gonna
break that lamp at 6:36.

231
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,078
- Where'd you pinch this?
- It's mine.

232
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,872
- Prove it.
- I gave it to him.

233
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,375
Oh, yeah?

234
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:39,961
Who the hell are you?

235
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,714
- Where you from?
- The Bronx.

236
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,633
And you give away watches?

237
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,761
He's my uncle.

238
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,973
- And who gave it to you?
- My Uncle Nathan.

239
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,767
My little brother.

240
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,020
Tell your uncle to
stop by the precinct.

241
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,273
- He's dead.
- Alcoholic.

242
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,275
In Kishnev, Poland.

243
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,283
Then he don't need it no more.
It's been requisitioned.

244
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:16,289
- Requi... What's that mean?
- Pinched, by him. At 6:37.

245
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,834
Just remember, I got
my eye on you two.

246
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,003
I got my eye on you too.

247
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,841
Take it. Take it. Take the
lamp off. I can't hold it.

248
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,886
Max.

249
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:34,807
Who's this?

250
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,270
My uncle.

251
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:02,877
- That one. With the cream.
- The 5-cent one?

252
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,712
Yeah.

253
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,329
For the twopenny
one she only gives

254
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,342
you a hand job. I
can do that myself.

255
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:11,928
Not that one.

256
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,055
That one.

257
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,516
You sure?

258
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,560
Wrap it up pretty.

259
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,228
Good morning. Peggy home?

260
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,355
She's taking a bath.

261
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,899
That's great. Would you
tell her I'm here?

262
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:10,528
Hey, Ma. Another bucket of water.

263
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,698
Wait.

264
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:46,058
- What do you want?
- Me?

265
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,975
Mama said you were looking for me.

266
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:51,605
Oh, ye... No. The
guys told me that...

267
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:55,985
- What?
- I'll come back some other time.

268
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,897
Noodles.

269
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,651
Noodles. Noodles. Noodles.

270
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,367
What?

271
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,951
Did you get it?

272
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,413
His asshole blinked,
but we got him.

273
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:50,831
Nice going, Fartface.
And on duty too.

274
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,530
Heh. Ha-ha. You
boys caught me with

275
01:01:53,531 --> 01:01:55,669
my pants down that time. Heheh.

276
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,923
No, we caught you with your
schmuck up the tuchus of a minor.

277
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:00,825
Scram. Put this some place safe.

278
01:02:00,826 --> 01:02:02,968
That's all right.
Ha-ha. Hey, hold it.

279
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,429
Where you going? Stop.
Hold it. Wait a minute.

280
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:07,348
Hey, you, stop. Hold it.

281
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,307
What are you gonna
do with that plate?

282
01:02:10,308 --> 01:02:12,520
Depends. What time is it, Max?

283
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,523
I think it's time we
got our watch back.

284
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,610
- Okay, boys, we're even.
- The hell we are.

285
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:22,196
You'll be collecting your
pension before we're even.

286
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:23,989
Hiya, fellas.

287
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,659
What do you boys want?

288
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:29,412
First off...

289
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,497
- you're paying Peggy for us.
- Ha.

290
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,791
Okay. That's it?

291
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,626
Go ahead while I tell him.

292
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,817
Ha-ha-ha. I can't
believe it. My first

293
01:02:37,818 --> 01:02:39,839
time, and a lousy
cop's paying for it.

294
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,637
Look, what else do you kids
want for that plate? Huh?

295
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:49,723
Noodles was telling me
about a guy called Bugsy.

296
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,935
Seems he's boss of this
neighbourhood, thanks to you.

297
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:56,230
- Meaning what?
- Meaning he pays you off.

298
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:59,942
Will you slow down? What is
your hurry? Take it easy.

299
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,195
If you keep this up, you're
gonna come too fast.

300
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:08,993
Do you see what I mean? You're
so stupid. I can't believe it.

301
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:14,415
So why does Bugsy pay you?
What do you do for him?

302
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,855
I close an eye once in a while.

303
01:03:17,856 --> 01:03:20,087
Well, now you close an eye for us.

304
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:23,299
Why? What are you kids up to?

305
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,804
He'll tell you.

306
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:32,349
Me, him, Cockeye and Patsy,
we're working together.

307
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,478
Bugsy'll flatten you.

308
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,564
Besides, I don't put up
with no trouble on my beat.

309
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:41,017
You'll put up, and
you'll shut up. You

310
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:43,068
hear nothing, and you see nothing.

311
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,904
Just like you did for Bugsy.

312
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,489
Shit.

313
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,081
Aw, don't get upset. That makes it

314
01:03:49,082 --> 01:03:51,744
worse. It can happen
the first time.

315
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,908
It's them two talking out there.

316
01:03:53,909 --> 01:03:56,373
Can't you see you're
ruining the mood?

317
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,876
We made our deal.

318
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,172
- So take a walk.
- Come here, honey.

319
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:08,969
- Feel good, bubeleh?
- Ha. He'll never get it up.

320
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:14,725
Relax. Okay. Calm down, calm down.

321
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:24,944
Okay. Okay, come here.

322
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,525
I'm glad the baby's better.

323
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:50,613
- Happy Pesach, Deborah.
- Happy Pesach, Becky.

324
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,955
Hurry. We're gonna be late.

325
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,040
Oh, there's Deborah.

326
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,583
Sorry I'm late. Mama needed help.

327
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:06,003
Good girl. I just locked up,
and I'm giving you the keys.

328
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,742
I thought I'd just
practise my dance

329
01:06:22,743 --> 01:06:24,688
routines. That's all. All right?

330
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:28,108
Deborah, make sure you
don't let the goyim in.

331
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:32,738
- Okay, bye.
- See you later, Debbie. Bye.

332
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,688
Get down off there, roach.

333
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,648
That record's just like Ex-Lax.

334
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:53,527
Every time I put it on, you
have to go to the bathroom.

335
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,671
What are you doing?

336
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,674
- Give me a drink.
- We're closed.

337
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:20,637
Nice people don't drink on Pesach.
They go to the synagogue.

338
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,139
So, what are you doing here?

339
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:25,517
Somebody's gotta keep
an eye on the place.

340
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,941
There are a lot of little
thieves out there.

341
01:08:27,942 --> 01:08:29,897
One of them could get
into your house.

342
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,525
Especially if you
leave the door open.

343
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,393
You can pray here too.

344
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:13,482
Here or in the synagogue, to
God it's the same difference.

345
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,277
Come over here and sit down.

346
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:53,272
"My beloved is white and ruddy.

347
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:57,067
His skin is as the most fine gold.

348
01:09:57,235 --> 01:10:01,280
His cheeks are as
a bed of spices."

349
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,827
Even though he hasn't
washed since last December.

350
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:15,085
"His eyes are as
the eyes of doves.

351
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,379
His body is as bright ivory.

352
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:22,050
His legs are as
pillars of marble."

353
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:26,805
In pants so dirty they
stand by themselves.

354
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,935
"He is altogether lovable."

355
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,939
But he'll always be
a two-bit punk...

356
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:40,986
so he'll never be my
beloved. What a shame.

357
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,186
Somebody's there.

358
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,408
There ain't nobody.

359
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:36,375
It's Max.

360
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,753
Ah. So that's who it was.

361
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,047
Noodles.

362
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:49,054
Go on, run. Your
mother's calling you.

363
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,561
Noodles.

364
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,232
Just gonna go see what he wants.

365
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,222
- Hey.
- Yo.

366
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:38,311
- You been here long?
- No.

367
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:41,690
Were you in there?

368
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,278
You're one lousy kisser.

369
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:49,614
I seen you go in there
after that ball-buster.

370
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,313
Here's the stuff from
last night. We got 4

371
01:12:52,314 --> 01:12:54,786
for the silverware, 6
for the typewriter.

372
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,246
Shitsy Lipschitz
wouldn't cough up any

373
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:59,207
more. We gotta get somebody else.

374
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,628
I came to divvy up.

375
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:09,259
- Tomorrow, with the others.
- I also came to pick you up.

376
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,252
I can't come right now.

377
01:13:12,253 --> 01:13:14,765
The houses, the
stores are all empty.

378
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:18,143
We got our pick. You pick that.

379
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,187
Yeah.

380
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:27,194
Some partner I got. Have fun.

381
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,745
How's it going, boys?

382
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:39,081
Who's that?

383
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,166
Bugsy.

384
01:13:58,476 --> 01:14:01,895
I hear you guys are in business
for yourselves now, huh?

385
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,022
I hear youse are doing real good.

386
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,115
Ain't you gonna introduce
me to your friend here?

387
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:19,496
I'll introduce myself.

388
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,294
Excuse the glove.

389
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:35,887
Ow.

390
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,597
Son of a bitch.

391
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,980
That's my cut.

392
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,566
You don't work for me, you
don't work for no one.

393
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,278
- I don't like bosses.
- Ha-ha.

394
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:36,156
You was better off you
stayed in the Bronx.

395
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:43,496
It would have been
better for you too.

396
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,854
I'm gonna kill him
one of these days.

397
01:16:27,855 --> 01:16:28,855
Yeah?

398
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:34,047
Meantime it looks
like he's killed us.

399
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,736
Deborah, open up the door.

400
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:00,949
Deborah, open up the door.

401
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,035
Deborah.

402
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,635
That stuff, is it
ready for the club?

403
01:17:48,636 --> 01:17:49,914
We're loading it.

404
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:26,660
Che cazzo succede down here?

405
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:29,287
Al, we got the big
boys with us today.

406
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,840
They wanna work for us.

407
01:18:30,841 --> 01:18:33,166
Doing what Bugsy did.
We want his job.

408
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:34,501
Do you get that? Ha-ha.

409
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:40,048
We the best escorts
you ever gonna get.

410
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:43,760
A fangulo a ma, escort your
mother's ass out of here.

411
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,836
Okay. Let's go,
Noodles. We'll peddle

412
01:18:47,837 --> 01:18:50,392
your invention
somewhere else, huh?

413
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,187
Hey, wait a minute.

414
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:57,440
What invention?

415
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:59,447
You ship your stuff
by the river, right?

416
01:18:59,448 --> 01:19:00,460
Sometimes.

417
01:19:00,461 --> 01:19:02,041
And when you get
caught by the Coast

418
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:03,947
Guard, you throw all
the cases overboard.

419
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:06,825
- You lose the whole shipment.
- So?

420
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,119
For 10 percent, we'll
save it all for you.

421
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,664
- What do you got, a submarine?
- We got salt.

422
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:15,667
You got what?

423
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:18,199
Salt. Me and the boys
are rolling salts.

424
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,672
Yeah. We need 3 tons
of salt per shipment.

425
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,384
Get the fuck out of here. Go
back to school where you belong.

426
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:27,345
What is it with all this salt?

427
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:32,016
Hey, hey, we got salt on
our noodles. Show them.

428
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,698
This is full of salt.

429
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,329
All right, come here.

430
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:11,097
- So?
- Keep your shirt on.

431
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,892
We gotta wait for the
salt to dissolve.

432
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:49,052
- Well?
- Hey, what's wrong?

433
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,267
Hey, look.

434
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,603
Hey. Wow.

435
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,605
We're rich.

436
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:02,106
Great.

437
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:06,110
- Look at that.
- It's great.

438
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:07,695
- Noodles.
- Look at it.

439
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:12,242
- I see them. What did I tell you?
- Yeah.

440
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:17,622
Yeah.

441
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:31,135
- Hey, Noodles.
- Hooray. Hooray for us.

442
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:36,140
We did it.

443
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:38,768
Come here, Max.

444
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:43,523
- We did it.
- No, Max, no.

445
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,528
Max.

446
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,656
Max.

447
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,919
Max.

448
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:08,506
Max.

449
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:25,315
What would you do without me?

450
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:32,131
There.

451
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:38,763
From here on, we establish the
shared funds of the gang.

452
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:41,933
They belong to all of us together
and to none of us alone.

453
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:44,553
And we solemnly swear to put in 50

454
01:23:44,554 --> 01:23:47,438
percent of everything
we make. Agreed?

455
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:48,856
Agreed.

456
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:50,942
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

457
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:55,738
Agreed.

458
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,784
I wanna take another peek.

459
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,097
Announcing the
immediate departure...

460
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:26,144
of the Lackawanna Railroad, Hudson
Valley Express, Poughkeepsie...

461
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:31,274
Albany, Utica, Syracuse,
Rochester and Buffalo.

462
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,777
All aboard.

463
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:41,993
This goes to Fat Moe. We don't
tell him what it's for.

464
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:45,496
And he gives it back only
when we're all together.

465
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:46,914
Agreed?

466
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,001
Agreed.

467
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,505
Agreed.

468
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:54,106
Bugsy's coming. Run.

469
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:47,869
Noodles.

470
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:50,830
I slipped.

471
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,888
Bastard.

472
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:34,684
Schmuck.

473
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,278
Wanna go in?

474
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,575
Yeah.

475
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:58,994
You a relative?

476
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,541
An uncle.

477
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,721
It's open.

478
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,176
"Erected to their
everlasting memory

479
01:34:31,177 --> 01:34:32,583
by their friend and brother...

480
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:35,502
David Aaronson, 1967."

481
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:01,070
Hello. May I help you?

482
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:02,696
I was just looking around.

483
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:05,449
- I'm the director of Riverdale.
- Huh.

484
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:07,242
I've never seen a tomb like this.

485
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:11,914
We like to call them "havens,"
we find it's more comforting.

486
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,337
"Erected to their
everlasting memory...

487
01:35:18,505 --> 01:35:22,341
by their friend and brother
David Aaronson, Noodles, 1967."

488
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:24,676
This was just built?

489
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:30,974
Yes. You know Mr.
Aaronson, Mr? Sorry.

490
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:34,186
Mr. Williams.

491
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:36,730
Mr. Williams.

492
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:39,700
Well, interest like
yours is a compliment

493
01:35:39,701 --> 01:35:41,902
to our architects, Mr. Williams.

494
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:43,946
After you.

495
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:15,769
I think the beauty of the interior
equals that of the exterior.

496
01:36:15,937 --> 01:36:18,188
Don't you agree, Mr. Williams?

497
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:21,859
We wanted to do it in
the style of the 30s...

498
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:25,904
which is when our young
friends said farewell.

499
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:36,832
Was this Mr. Aaronson's idea?

500
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,210
Actually, he left the
whole thing up to us.

501
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:43,839
I had... We had carte Blanche.

502
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,134
All he suggested was
the inscription.

503
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:51,805
"Your youngest and strongest
will fall by the sword."

504
01:36:54,184 --> 01:36:57,102
- What about the music?
- And the music.

505
01:36:57,270 --> 01:37:00,063
- That was his idea too?
- Yes.

506
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:02,316
We received a tape.

507
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:05,986
You seem to know him so well.

508
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:08,614
I'd like to ask you
to, tell him...

509
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,742
how much you like the
haven when you see him.

510
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:14,077
- Could you do that?
- Certainly.

511
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:17,706
I've been away for
quite a long time...

512
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:20,959
and I lost the address, so
I was wondering maybe...

513
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:23,754
You must have sent him
a bill or something.

514
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:27,382
The bank handled it...

515
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,927
through a foreign bank.

516
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:34,348
I wish I could be of more
assistance to you, Mr. Williams.

517
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:40,395
Did you ever think of
building your own haven?

518
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:16,598
Think about it.

519
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:49,126
Can I take that for you, sir?

520
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:53,630
Your limousine is waiting.

521
01:41:04,016 --> 01:41:05,726
Maxie.

522
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:20,323
How are you, uncle?
You're looking good.

523
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:23,535
You're looking a little better.

524
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:31,042
Come on. Better get
you off the streets.

525
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:35,347
Some limousine.

526
01:41:35,348 --> 01:41:37,632
Ha-ha. What are you talking, huh?

527
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:40,330
We own the company now.
It's a good cover.

528
01:41:40,331 --> 01:41:42,471
You'd be surprised.
It pays off too.

529
01:41:42,638 --> 01:41:46,516
My mother wrote me you was in
the body-snatching business.

530
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:52,063
By the way, I appreciate
everything you did for my family.

531
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:54,524
Forget it. It's your dough.

532
01:41:55,193 --> 01:41:58,528
It's all down in black and
white in the company books.

533
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:01,423
You're the company.
You and Patsy and

534
01:42:01,424 --> 01:42:03,700
Cockeye. Gravediggers
and equal partners.

535
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:08,079
Heh. Hey, enough of this, huh?
Business before pleasure.

536
01:42:08,915 --> 01:42:11,041
We got a rush job. Here.

537
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,922
Come here. Look at
this. Come here.

538
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:22,302
Sudden death. Fucking
tragedy, huh?

539
01:42:23,596 --> 01:42:26,932
- Twenty-six years old.
- Twenty-six?

540
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:29,976
What a shame.

541
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:32,938
Great stiff. She
died of an overdose.

542
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:35,106
And I'm ready for
another. Ha-ha-ha.

543
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:37,089
Come on, Noodles. Pump
the life into her.

544
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:38,819
You didn't turn pansy
in there, did you?

545
01:42:42,532 --> 01:42:43,615
There you go.

546
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:50,956
Turning over in the grave.
They do it every time.

547
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:34,791
Ha-ha. Don't worry.
A pansy he ain't.

548
01:43:37,795 --> 01:43:40,297
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Noodles.

549
01:43:40,965 --> 01:43:42,757
Whoops. Sorry.

550
01:43:43,092 --> 01:43:45,260
Thanks. Good night.

551
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:48,615
Hey, you want a little pick-me-up?

552
01:43:48,616 --> 01:43:50,974
Oh, no, thanks. I've had mine.

553
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:55,020
- Did you give her your all?
- What do you think?

554
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:56,771
Bet your life I did.

555
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:24,299
Wait till you see this
place. Got the best...

556
01:44:24,467 --> 01:44:25,926
It's over here.

557
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:31,848
- Where we going?
- To a place that never closes.

558
01:44:32,725 --> 01:44:34,726
Whoops. Watch yourself.

559
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:47,822
- How's he doing?
- He's doing great.

560
01:44:52,203 --> 01:44:53,244
What's this?

561
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:55,872
Our place. We got the
hottest spot in town.

562
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:06,549
This is the real Fat Moe's.

563
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:09,886
Get rid of that rag, will you?

564
01:45:11,222 --> 01:45:13,431
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

565
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:16,101
- You like it?
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

566
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:33,368
Hey, give me that.

567
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:41,793
- Noodles. Look who's here.
- Patsy, look.

568
01:45:42,003 --> 01:45:44,629
Come here, son of a bitch.
Come here. Come here.

569
01:45:44,797 --> 01:45:46,756
- Patsy.
- Oh.

570
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,259
- You look fantastic.
- Wait a minute.

571
01:45:49,427 --> 01:45:50,760
How you doing?

572
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:55,890
- Look how big you got.
- Me?

573
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:58,101
Noodles. Oh. Oh, God.

574
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:01,104
- Noodles.
- Freight train, coming through.

575
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:09,621
Hey. Hey, come on. Hey, let's
have a toast, for Christ sakes.

576
01:46:09,622 --> 01:46:10,633
You look like shit.

577
01:46:10,634 --> 01:46:12,215
What do you want? I
just got out of prison.

578
01:46:12,216 --> 01:46:13,237
Nice guy.

579
01:46:13,238 --> 01:46:14,701
Hey. Hey, Noodles,
get a load of this.

580
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:15,910
Look.

581
01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:20,915
Hey, Scotch heating.

582
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:23,126
- Yeah, a buck a cup.
- Whoo.

583
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:25,670
- A buck a cup?
- Yeah.

584
01:46:25,838 --> 01:46:27,630
- How much it cost us?
- Costing us?

585
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:30,633
- Yeah.
- A dime, including overhead.

586
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:34,137
- Hey, Noodles. Fat Moe.
- Oh. Heh.

587
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:41,686
You look terrific.

588
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,566
Look like you lost
an ounce or two.

589
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:48,276
You think I would
lose haemorrhoids.

590
01:46:49,945 --> 01:46:52,280
Can't recognise him
without an apron.

591
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:54,574
- L'chaim.
- L'chaim.

592
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,452
Welcome home.

593
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:02,415
What the fuck kind of
maître d' are you?

594
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:05,001
New guy rolls into the joint,
you don't even show him around.

595
01:47:05,169 --> 01:47:06,878
- Yeah.
- What's the matter with you?

596
01:47:07,046 --> 01:47:09,017
I didn't know. Noodles, I'm sorry.

597
01:47:09,018 --> 01:47:10,882
Youse are some bunch of shtunks.

598
01:47:11,092 --> 01:47:13,426
- You don't come up and get me?
- He's the shtunk.

599
01:47:13,594 --> 01:47:14,677
- Shtunk?
- Yeah, shtunk.

600
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:16,394
He said you weren't
out till Monday.

601
01:47:16,395 --> 01:47:18,181
You can get him the
next time he gets out.

602
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:22,393
- Ha-ha-ha.
- God forbid. God forbid.

603
01:47:26,982 --> 01:47:31,194
Whoa. Whoa. Ha-ha-ha.

604
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:43,665
Come on, let's see if you
can guess who it is.

605
01:47:48,754 --> 01:47:52,173
Charlotte russe. With a little
too much whipped cream.

606
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:55,885
Peggy.

607
01:48:00,141 --> 01:48:04,394
Hey, you watch it, now. And
my prices, they've gone up.

608
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:09,357
I work in a high-class joint now.
And I get paid by the pound.

609
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:10,567
Whoa.

610
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:14,571
My Peggy, she's worth every penny
of it too, my red-hot mama.

611
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:18,408
Come on, come on..

612
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:20,577
You fuck.

613
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,203
Timber.

614
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:25,730
You've seen your old
pals, now I want

615
01:48:25,731 --> 01:48:27,292
you to meet some
new ones. Come on.

616
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:29,165
Peggeleh, I'll see you later.

617
01:48:29,166 --> 01:48:31,421
You gonna lay here
all night or what?

618
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:44,976
Cockeye wanted to play with
the band. I'm serious.

619
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:54,152
Come on.

620
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:24,432
- Aren't you going to say hello?
- Hello.

621
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:48,289
- Your brother's a real friend.
- He's a romantic.

622
01:49:59,677 --> 01:50:02,554
Max tell you I was
getting out today?

623
01:50:02,555 --> 01:50:03,555
Max? No.

624
01:50:04,306 --> 01:50:08,851
- You remembered yourself?
- No, Moe. It's always Moe.

625
01:50:13,691 --> 01:50:15,483
Yeah.

626
01:50:24,076 --> 01:50:26,202
You mean you weren't
counting the days?

627
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:31,874
Of course I was. 4344, 4343.

628
01:50:32,293 --> 01:50:34,377
I lost track at 3000.

629
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:37,714
- That wasn't my choice.
- Yes, it was. It still is.

630
01:50:41,218 --> 01:50:44,345
Well, anyway, did you come here
to welcome me back at least?

631
01:50:44,513 --> 01:50:46,673
I still live here. I
was on my way out.

632
01:50:46,674 --> 01:50:48,725
Moe said I should
at least say hello.

633
01:50:50,227 --> 01:50:54,188
I hope Moe didn't have to bend
your arm or anything like that.

634
01:50:56,442 --> 01:50:57,734
No.

635
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:01,571
Welcome back, Noodles.

636
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:05,950
Hey, Noodles.

637
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:14,751
You dancing?

638
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:17,920
Every night at the Palace Theatre.

639
01:51:19,048 --> 01:51:21,571
I've made some progress
since I danced

640
01:51:21,572 --> 01:51:24,093
here among the brooms
and the empties.

641
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:29,599
You can come spy on me if
you like. If you have time.

642
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:32,435
Every night.

643
01:51:48,786 --> 01:51:50,286
Noodles.

644
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:57,460
Go on, Noodles, your
mother's calling you.

645
01:52:05,803 --> 01:52:08,429
It's good to see you
again, Noodles.

646
01:52:21,318 --> 01:52:23,319
My pleasure.

647
01:52:31,703 --> 01:52:35,164
- Did you get the wine?
- Dago Red. The best.

648
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,298
How you doing?

649
01:52:51,557 --> 01:52:55,017
There they are. The four
horsemen of the apocalypse.

650
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:00,857
Did you see that movie,
Joe? It was a good movie.

651
01:53:01,024 --> 01:53:02,650
- Hey, Max, how are you?
- Good to see you.

652
01:53:02,818 --> 01:53:04,444
Nice to see you.

653
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:06,882
This must be your friend Noodles.

654
01:53:06,883 --> 01:53:08,573
Noodles, say hello to Mr. Monaldi.

655
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:10,867
- Hi, Noodles, how are you?
- I'm all right.

656
01:53:11,034 --> 01:53:13,203
It's very nice to meet
you. But you don't

657
01:53:13,204 --> 01:53:15,371
have to call me Mr.
Monaldi like he says.

658
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:20,001
I like my friends and people I
respect to call me Frankie.

659
01:53:20,836 --> 01:53:24,547
Come on, sit down. Get some
chairs and some glasses.

660
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:31,888
Sit down, relax. You're home now.

661
01:53:41,773 --> 01:53:44,567
This is my very dear friend Joe.

662
01:53:44,735 --> 01:53:48,029
He came all the way from Detroit
to ask me to do him a favour.

663
01:53:48,697 --> 01:53:50,573
And I wanna do it for him.

664
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,937
I don't have to tell
you who Joe is, how

665
01:53:54,938 --> 01:53:57,580
far he got, or how
far he's gonna get.

666
01:53:58,332 --> 01:54:01,709
He's not only my dear
friend, he's my brother.

667
01:54:01,877 --> 01:54:05,046
Frankie, I'll tell you the truth.
Even a Jew can't eat this shit.

668
01:54:06,715 --> 01:54:09,425
I mean, the mustard
doesn't even help.

669
01:54:19,394 --> 01:54:21,938
These guys with you?

670
01:54:22,523 --> 01:54:25,233
I told you these
fellas are with me.

671
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:28,611
You could trust them.
You're in very good hands.

672
01:54:29,029 --> 01:54:31,906
Just tell them exactly
what you want them to do.

673
01:54:33,825 --> 01:54:37,286
Move some diamonds from
Detroit. Kid stuff.

674
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:45,169
Why us then?

675
01:54:45,963 --> 01:54:49,799
If it's kid stuff, why don't you
have the kids from Detroit do it?

676
01:54:52,469 --> 01:54:55,484
Excuse me, Noodles.
What he means is that

677
01:54:55,485 --> 01:54:58,140
it's something that's
very simple...

678
01:54:58,308 --> 01:55:01,769
but for now, he needs kids
from outside to handle it.

679
01:55:01,937 --> 01:55:03,836
He just found out
they're gonna move

680
01:55:03,837 --> 01:55:05,940
these diamonds to
Holland in a few days.

681
01:55:06,692 --> 01:55:08,651
So it's something
came up right away.

682
01:55:10,112 --> 01:55:11,821
You understand?

683
01:55:18,495 --> 01:55:20,204
Hey, Joe.

684
01:55:21,123 --> 01:55:24,319
Tell these guys the
story about, the

685
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:27,169
pussy being insured. What is it?

686
01:55:29,506 --> 01:55:31,112
Tell these guys how
you stumbled on

687
01:55:31,113 --> 01:55:32,717
this whole thing
with the jewels...

688
01:55:32,884 --> 01:55:35,177
- Oh. Come on.
- Tell them the story.

689
01:55:35,345 --> 01:55:36,999
The pussy insurance. The insurance

690
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,140
pussies. What is it?
Tell them that story.

691
01:55:39,308 --> 01:55:45,187
Life is stranger than shit, that's
all. It's a pisser. No big story.

692
01:55:45,355 --> 01:55:48,858
I got this insurance agent,
this Jew kid named David.

693
01:55:49,026 --> 01:55:51,361
This kid conned me
into every policy

694
01:55:51,362 --> 01:55:53,696
in the world. Every
policy, name it.

695
01:55:53,864 --> 01:55:57,658
Dogs, house, wife, life, anything.

696
01:55:57,826 --> 01:55:59,562
I'm drinking with the boys one

697
01:55:59,563 --> 01:56:01,704
night, he comes in
with his wife...

698
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:05,207
a pretty brunette with a nice
ass who works for a jeweller.

699
01:56:05,375 --> 01:56:08,210
And he's still on the
hustle, this guy.

700
01:56:09,379 --> 01:56:12,131
So I wink at the guys,
I say, "Look...

701
01:56:13,842 --> 01:56:15,969
the most serious
policy that should

702
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:18,095
be, you don't have
me covered for."

703
01:56:18,263 --> 01:56:21,098
He goes, "What's that,
Joe?" "Cock insurance."

704
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:27,188
"You make me a policy that when
it don't work, I get a payment...

705
01:56:27,356 --> 01:56:29,523
I'll write out a check now."

706
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:34,491
He thinks, he says,
"Oh, I don't know

707
01:56:34,492 --> 01:56:37,448
if the actuality
gauges govern this...

708
01:56:37,658 --> 01:56:39,784
but we can make a policy.

709
01:56:39,951 --> 01:56:43,204
But you gotta guarantee
you're in good health now."

710
01:56:43,372 --> 01:56:45,787
"Oh, that's simple.
Look, leave her with

711
01:56:45,788 --> 01:56:48,084
me. Come back and see
if it stands up.

712
01:56:48,251 --> 01:56:51,212
If it stands up, then you know I'm
in good health to begin with."

713
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:53,631
The jerk leaves her. I screw her.

714
01:56:53,799 --> 01:56:56,325
Not only that, she likes
it. And she tells

715
01:56:56,326 --> 01:56:58,969
me, she blabs when her
boss, the jeweller...

716
01:56:59,137 --> 01:57:01,222
is shipping stones to Holland...

717
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:03,672
where he keeps his stash
in a little drawer

718
01:57:03,673 --> 01:57:05,643
in the safe. Everything
in the world.

719
01:57:05,811 --> 01:57:09,146
Can't ask for more, right?
Except, one better.

720
01:57:09,314 --> 01:57:13,317
I never paid the first premium
on the new cock policy.

721
01:57:26,915 --> 01:57:28,416
Cock insurance.

722
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:38,426
Life is funnier than shit.

723
01:57:38,969 --> 01:57:40,010
But...

724
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:46,475
be easy with the girl.

725
01:57:50,021 --> 01:57:52,231
I mean that. Be
easy with the girl.

726
01:58:00,323 --> 01:58:01,824
Oh, my God.

727
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:09,498
Open it.

728
01:58:09,666 --> 01:58:11,959
Who's gotten in?

729
01:58:20,302 --> 01:58:22,011
Had to go and be a hero, huh?

730
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:30,102
- Open it.
- No.

731
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:33,230
- Open it.
- Don't... No, don't hurt him.

732
01:58:33,398 --> 01:58:36,192
- Don't hurt him.
- Get this cunt out of here.

733
01:58:36,359 --> 01:58:39,320
You animal. You asshole.

734
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:42,698
- Come on. Come on, hit me.
- What do you mean?

735
01:58:42,866 --> 01:58:44,867
- Hit me.
- What, are you crazy?

736
01:58:45,035 --> 01:58:48,037
- Straighten up and fly right.
- I'm all right.

737
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:51,248
Let me make it look real.
Make it look real.

738
01:58:51,416 --> 01:58:54,084
- Come on, knock it off.
- I'm all right. Let go.

739
01:58:54,252 --> 01:58:56,545
- Come on, cut the act.
- Hit me.

740
01:58:57,088 --> 01:59:00,508
She said hit her. Go ahead,
rap her in the mouth.

741
01:59:00,675 --> 01:59:03,552
- Hit me.
- I'll hit you. You bitch.

742
01:59:06,389 --> 01:59:08,808
- You animal.
- Put a cork in her.

743
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:13,729
No. Oh.

744
01:59:13,897 --> 01:59:15,147
No.

745
01:59:15,315 --> 01:59:17,233
No. Don't.

746
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:20,277
Don't. No.

747
01:59:20,445 --> 01:59:26,200
No. You dirty bastards. You're...

748
01:59:30,539 --> 01:59:32,414
Bastards.

749
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:40,923
Try the secret compartment.

750
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:49,265
Attaboy.

751
01:59:58,942 --> 02:00:00,276
Thanks.

752
02:00:22,382 --> 02:00:25,467
- Wow. Nice matzo balls.
- Huh?

753
02:00:30,307 --> 02:00:32,725
Whoa.

754
02:00:32,893 --> 02:00:35,603
Those are beautiful.
Look at that.?

755
02:00:37,355 --> 02:00:39,481
Okay, better wrap them up.

756
02:00:48,617 --> 02:00:49,950
We're going. You coming?

757
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:55,331
Coming.

758
02:01:42,712 --> 02:01:46,048
- Morning.
- You get the stones?

759
02:02:04,985 --> 02:02:08,612
Oh... Pay him.

760
02:02:33,638 --> 02:02:37,933
- Any problem?
- No trouble. Kid stuff.

761
02:04:53,111 --> 02:04:54,736
You okay?

762
02:05:32,734 --> 02:05:36,987
- How come you didn't tell me?
- Being inside can change you.

763
02:05:37,155 --> 02:05:39,698
I'd already made the deal with
Frankie to get rid of Joe.

764
02:05:39,866 --> 02:05:41,992
With Frankie Monaldi, you
don't say "yes," then "no."

765
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:44,161
Couldn't take the chance
you'd change your mind.

766
02:05:44,329 --> 02:05:45,871
You're right. I
would have said no.

767
02:05:46,456 --> 02:05:48,790
Frankie Monaldi is
as big as they come.

768
02:05:48,958 --> 02:05:50,876
He's got the combination
in the palm of his hand.

769
02:05:51,044 --> 02:05:53,670
If we're not careful, he'll have
us in the palm of his hand.

770
02:05:53,838 --> 02:05:56,089
You don't get nowhere alone.

771
02:05:56,591 --> 02:05:58,967
I thought you were the guy that
said you didn't like bosses.

772
02:05:59,135 --> 02:06:02,262
It sounded like a good
idea then. It still is.

773
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:03,639
Let's just think about it.

774
02:06:03,806 --> 02:06:05,370
They're gonna ask
us to come in with

775
02:06:05,371 --> 02:06:06,808
them. There's a lot in it for us.

776
02:06:10,772 --> 02:06:12,816
Today they ask us
to get rid of Joe.

777
02:06:12,817 --> 02:06:15,025
Tomorrow they ask me
to get rid of you.

778
02:06:15,193 --> 02:06:18,820
Is that okay with you? Because
it's not okay with me.

779
02:06:21,824 --> 02:06:23,659
All right.

780
02:06:24,827 --> 02:06:26,912
Let's just forget about it.

781
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:41,802
Wanna go for a swim?

782
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:46,598
Yeah, let's go for a swim.

783
02:06:57,735 --> 02:06:59,736
All right, what are you doing?

784
02:06:59,904 --> 02:07:03,323
Hey, Noodles. Don't
fuck around, Noodles.

785
02:07:06,411 --> 02:07:08,829
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

786
02:07:08,997 --> 02:07:11,248
Are you crazy?

787
02:07:14,043 --> 02:07:15,961
Shit.

788
02:07:22,552 --> 02:07:26,221
That asshole. I can't
believe you did this.

789
02:10:50,009 --> 02:10:53,470
District Attorney James Lister was
killed in an explosion of a car...

790
02:10:53,638 --> 02:10:56,556
belonging to Secretary of
Commerce Christopher Bailey...

791
02:10:56,724 --> 02:11:00,018
as he was leaving the
secretary's Long Island estate.

792
02:11:00,186 --> 02:11:01,917
Mr. Lister, who was
killed instantly in

793
02:11:01,918 --> 02:11:03,605
the blast, was scheduled
to testify...

794
02:11:03,773 --> 02:11:06,942
in Washington on Thursday
before a Senate committee.

795
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:08,973
A committee investigating what has

796
02:11:08,974 --> 02:11:11,112
come to be called
the Bailey scandal.

797
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:14,282
A special team of detectives
has been assigned to the case.

798
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:16,856
As for Secretary
Bailey, he was not

799
02:11:16,857 --> 02:11:19,663
available for any
statement at this time.

800
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:21,665
Did you know those guys?

801
02:11:21,832 --> 02:11:25,168
Offices of his long-time legal
advisor, Irving Gold...

802
02:11:25,336 --> 02:11:27,879
in hopes of getting some comment.

803
02:11:28,047 --> 02:11:32,467
Mr. Gold, you're aware that
District Attorney Lister...

804
02:11:32,635 --> 02:11:34,328
is the second witness
in the Bailey

805
02:11:34,329 --> 02:11:36,304
scandal to meet a
sudden and violent end.

806
02:11:36,722 --> 02:11:40,225
The first was Thomas Finney,
undersecretary of commerce...

807
02:11:40,393 --> 02:11:42,279
who fell to his death from his

808
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:44,604
15th-floor office
just a month ago.

809
02:11:44,772 --> 02:11:46,398
Do you think there's a connection?

810
02:11:46,566 --> 02:11:50,569
Take the money and run, Noodles.
What the hell's keeping you here?

811
02:11:51,529 --> 02:11:54,364
The only remaining witness
is the man who...

812
02:11:54,532 --> 02:11:57,031
rightly or wrongly
has given his name

813
02:11:57,032 --> 02:11:59,661
to this whole affair,
Secretary Bailey.

814
02:11:59,829 --> 02:12:02,581
- I'm curious.
- What does the secretary think?

815
02:12:02,748 --> 02:12:04,749
The secretary has no worries.

816
02:12:04,917 --> 02:12:07,277
Sir, if he has no
worries, why then has

817
02:12:07,278 --> 02:12:09,754
he retreated to his
place on Long Island?

818
02:12:09,922 --> 02:12:12,059
Far from retreating,
he's busy preparing

819
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:13,675
his attack on the questions...

820
02:12:13,843 --> 02:12:15,677
he will be asked by the committee.

821
02:12:15,845 --> 02:12:18,388
I'd call them accusations
more than questions, sir.

822
02:12:18,556 --> 02:12:21,224
- The secretary has no worries.
- But the public does.

823
02:12:21,392 --> 02:12:23,697
Particularly in
view of the rumours

824
02:12:23,698 --> 02:12:25,937
about rigged contracts, bribery...

825
02:12:26,105 --> 02:12:28,276
the international
Mafia. Especially

826
02:12:28,277 --> 02:12:30,567
those dealing with
the illegal use...

827
02:12:30,735 --> 02:12:33,612
of the Transport
union pension funds.

828
02:12:33,779 --> 02:12:36,114
Could you tell us
anything about that?

829
02:12:36,282 --> 02:12:39,128
Gentlemen, I deny all
of these rumours

830
02:12:39,129 --> 02:12:42,120
and allegations against
my organisation.

831
02:12:42,288 --> 02:12:46,750
Our hands have always been and
will continue to remain clean.

832
02:12:46,917 --> 02:12:49,727
In my entire life,
I've fought to keep

833
02:12:49,728 --> 02:12:52,464
the American labour
movement clear...

834
02:12:52,632 --> 02:12:53,840
Him, I know.

835
02:12:54,008 --> 02:12:56,760
Forced speculation,
criminal elements...

836
02:12:56,927 --> 02:13:01,473
or corrupt politicians. If any
mistakes have been made...

837
02:13:01,641 --> 02:13:04,934
He's still giving out
the same old bullshit.

838
02:13:05,102 --> 02:13:11,441
If any guilt at all exists in this
situation, it lies elsewhere.

839
02:13:50,606 --> 02:13:55,193
What's this I've been reading
about you in the newspapers?

840
02:13:57,238 --> 02:14:01,783
Inflammatory words
from a union boss?

841
02:14:06,163 --> 02:14:11,418
You still aren't gonna stop the
workers or the social movement.

842
02:14:11,961 --> 02:14:15,213
Listen to me, you
socialist asshole.

843
02:14:15,381 --> 02:14:17,943
We don't give a
good fart about the

844
02:14:17,944 --> 02:14:20,719
socialist workers and
their movements.

845
02:14:20,886 --> 02:14:23,388
We just want you out
of the factory so

846
02:14:23,389 --> 02:14:25,890
we can get the furnaces
working again.

847
02:14:26,058 --> 02:14:29,060
This is the last offer
you're gonna get.

848
02:14:29,228 --> 02:14:32,272
You want to sign it or what?

849
02:14:38,154 --> 02:14:41,448
Tell your bosses they can
wipe their ass with it.

850
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:49,164
Fill her up.

851
02:15:14,482 --> 02:15:15,565
This is my last...

852
02:15:23,157 --> 02:15:26,284
Hold it, boys. Don't shoot.

853
02:15:27,495 --> 02:15:29,788
It's me, Crowning.

854
02:15:42,718 --> 02:15:45,470
- Crowning.
- Yeah.

855
02:15:45,638 --> 02:15:47,305
That'll do, boys.

856
02:15:47,473 --> 02:15:49,307
What'll do?

857
02:15:49,475 --> 02:15:52,769
We almost got the kid
where we want him.

858
02:15:56,607 --> 02:15:59,692
And we got the boss
where we want him.

859
02:15:59,860 --> 02:16:01,444
Easy.

860
02:16:02,655 --> 02:16:04,489
Easy.

861
02:16:07,827 --> 02:16:10,161
Put them down.

862
02:16:10,913 --> 02:16:13,498
Put your guns away, boys.

863
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:25,385
Just swapping prisoners.

864
02:16:26,011 --> 02:16:28,638
Fair trade, huh, chickenhead?

865
02:16:36,021 --> 02:16:39,190
Union boy over here
for Mr. Boss Man.

866
02:16:39,358 --> 02:16:42,277
Well, look who's here. Ha-ha.

867
02:16:42,653 --> 02:16:45,029
Fat Moe's boneyard boys.

868
02:16:45,573 --> 02:16:47,657
Which reminds me.

869
02:16:48,075 --> 02:16:51,828
How's that cancer in your gut
coming along, Chicken Joe?

870
02:16:54,248 --> 02:16:57,792
- Untie him.
- I don't take orders from you.

871
02:16:57,960 --> 02:17:01,129
We're not asking you to take
orders, Joe. We're telling you.

872
02:17:01,297 --> 02:17:03,464
Now go ahead, untie him.

873
02:17:03,632 --> 02:17:05,633
Untie him.

874
02:17:10,514 --> 02:17:11,639
Untie him.

875
02:17:42,922 --> 02:17:44,923
Who are you?

876
02:17:45,883 --> 02:17:46,925
Who's paying you?

877
02:17:48,302 --> 02:17:51,054
I think this is really gonna
piss you off there, Mac.

878
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:54,140
I think it's those dirty, dirty
politician friends of yours.

879
02:17:54,934 --> 02:17:57,281
Yeah? Well, you
crawl back and tell

880
02:17:57,282 --> 02:17:59,562
them we don't want you in with us.

881
02:17:59,730 --> 02:18:03,483
Our fight's got nothing to do with
liquor and prostitution and dope.

882
02:18:03,651 --> 02:18:06,527
Youse better get used
to the idea, pal.

883
02:18:07,237 --> 02:18:09,113
This country is still growing up.

884
02:18:09,281 --> 02:18:13,201
Certain diseases it's better to
have when you're still young.

885
02:18:14,995 --> 02:18:19,791
You boys ain't a mild case of
the measles. You're the plague.

886
02:18:19,959 --> 02:18:22,001
And bastards like him are immune.

887
02:18:22,169 --> 02:18:25,630
That's the difference
between us and them.

888
02:18:27,299 --> 02:18:29,133
Take it easy.

889
02:18:29,301 --> 02:18:31,302
The difference is that
they're always gonna win...

890
02:18:31,470 --> 02:18:34,055
and you're gonna keep
getting it up the ass.

891
02:18:34,223 --> 02:18:36,182
Sooner than you think.

892
02:18:53,492 --> 02:18:55,598
Chief Aiello, moving
policemen into the

893
02:18:55,599 --> 02:18:57,704
factory came as a
surprise to everyone:

894
02:18:57,871 --> 02:19:00,581
The press, the unions,
especially the strikers.

895
02:19:00,749 --> 02:19:03,543
Well, what did you want,
sweetheart, a declaration of war?

896
02:19:03,711 --> 02:19:05,253
Ours was a peaceable operation.

897
02:19:05,421 --> 02:19:07,797
Wasn't that contrary
to new union laws?

898
02:19:07,965 --> 02:19:10,174
I'm chief of police, not
chief of the people.

899
02:19:10,342 --> 02:19:12,385
Was there any violence by
the strikers to justify...?

900
02:19:12,553 --> 02:19:16,514
My motto is: "Prevention,
not repression."

901
02:19:16,682 --> 02:19:18,766
But you let scabs move
in and start working.

902
02:19:18,934 --> 02:19:22,311
Young lady, you wanna talk to me,
call them "unemployed workers."

903
02:19:23,689 --> 02:19:25,829
With your permission,
I'll take these

904
02:19:25,830 --> 02:19:28,026
flowers to my missus
before they wilt.

905
02:19:28,694 --> 02:19:32,655
Or maybe you heard. I'm
the father of a baby boy.

906
02:19:34,867 --> 02:19:37,368
Chief, one more question.

907
02:19:37,536 --> 02:19:40,058
We heard he's the
youngest stockholder

908
02:19:40,059 --> 02:19:41,998
in that factory you occupied.

909
02:19:46,712 --> 02:19:48,671
What'd you mean by that?

910
02:19:48,839 --> 02:19:50,521
They say management
expressed their thanks

911
02:19:50,522 --> 02:19:52,008
with a birthday
present for the baby.

912
02:19:56,430 --> 02:19:59,057
You know, slander is
a serious offence.

913
02:19:59,224 --> 02:20:01,476
Especially when it comes
from a hack reporter.

914
02:20:01,977 --> 02:20:04,729
You wanna find out how serious?

915
02:20:06,857 --> 02:20:11,861
But since this is my first
boy after four girls...

916
02:20:12,029 --> 02:20:14,572
I'll declare amnesty.

917
02:20:15,365 --> 02:20:18,576
Ha-ha-ha. Behave yourself.

918
02:20:19,953 --> 02:20:21,871
Go.

919
02:22:33,086 --> 02:22:36,088
Thank you. Oh.

920
02:22:36,256 --> 02:22:37,840
He's eating?

921
02:22:38,008 --> 02:22:41,427
- For five.
- For five? Well, why not?

922
02:22:41,595 --> 02:22:44,388
You could feed an army with these
two milk plants. Ha-ha-ha.

923
02:22:44,556 --> 02:22:45,848
We could open up a dairy.

924
02:22:49,269 --> 02:22:50,728
Oh, hey.

925
02:22:52,606 --> 02:22:58,402
Who loves you? Who
loves you? I love you.

926
02:22:58,570 --> 02:23:02,406
And I love you. And I love you.

927
02:23:02,574 --> 02:23:04,200
Lucy.

928
02:23:04,368 --> 02:23:05,900
Don't you have to
feed him at 6:00?

929
02:23:05,901 --> 02:23:06,901
Huh.

930
02:23:07,788 --> 02:23:09,205
Come in.

931
02:23:10,916 --> 02:23:14,502
- Oh, here he is now.
- That's my son.

932
02:23:14,670 --> 02:23:18,631
That's my son. Oh, oh.

933
02:23:20,801 --> 02:23:26,430
That's my son. That's
my son. Ha-ha-ha.

934
02:23:26,598 --> 02:23:28,140
Jesus Christ, they change fast.

935
02:23:29,935 --> 02:23:32,561
Yeah, but he looks
like my old man.

936
02:23:32,729 --> 02:23:34,605
Yeah, yeah, look, same eyes.

937
02:23:34,773 --> 02:23:37,149
And look at that, the
same devilish pride, huh?

938
02:23:37,317 --> 02:23:40,194
Hey. Hey, hey.

939
02:23:40,362 --> 02:23:41,904
Did you see his dickey?

940
02:23:42,072 --> 02:23:43,948
- Vincent.
- What?

941
02:23:44,116 --> 02:23:46,450
- The girls.
- The girls.

942
02:23:46,618 --> 02:23:49,542
Sooner or later you
have to learn that

943
02:23:49,543 --> 02:23:52,540
after me, the boss
in the house is him.

944
02:23:52,708 --> 02:23:54,500
He's got balls just like his papa.

945
02:23:54,668 --> 02:23:55,918
- Whoa. Hey.
- Let me have him.

946
02:23:56,086 --> 02:23:59,714
No, no, no. I'll do this.

947
02:23:59,881 --> 02:24:01,757
I'll do this, huh? Yeah.

948
02:24:05,095 --> 02:24:07,096
Look. Hey, hey.

949
02:24:08,849 --> 02:24:11,267
Ooh. Ha-ha-ha.

950
02:24:11,768 --> 02:24:13,102
Let Papa change you, huh?

951
02:24:13,270 --> 02:24:15,479
Come on, look. Give me
your little-bitty smile.

952
02:24:15,647 --> 02:24:20,526
Come on, come on, come on.

953
02:24:21,903 --> 02:24:22,945
What the fuck is this?

954
02:24:24,281 --> 02:24:29,452
- What is this? Huh? What's that?
- No. No. Oh, no.

955
02:24:29,995 --> 02:24:32,246
- Look.
- It's the right number.

956
02:24:32,414 --> 02:24:35,750
The right number? I'll
break your goddamn neck.

957
02:24:35,917 --> 02:24:38,294
Find my son, or I'll burn
down this goddamn building.

958
02:24:39,671 --> 02:24:42,256
Hello. Hello.

959
02:24:42,424 --> 02:24:43,674
- Would you shut up?
- Oh.

960
02:24:43,842 --> 02:24:48,179
No, hey, no. Wait, wait.
I'm not talking to you.

961
02:24:48,347 --> 02:24:50,556
Well, who's this?

962
02:24:50,724 --> 02:24:53,142
Never mind... To who am I talking?

963
02:24:53,310 --> 02:24:56,020
Who the hell are you?
My son, where is he?

964
02:24:56,188 --> 02:24:58,305
Where the hell do you
think he is? He's

965
02:24:58,306 --> 02:25:00,316
in the maternity
ward. He never left.

966
02:25:00,484 --> 02:25:03,819
He just got a little restless
so he wanted to change his bed.

967
02:25:03,987 --> 02:25:05,803
And the other kids
got the same idea so

968
02:25:05,804 --> 02:25:07,573
they also wanted to
change their beds.

969
02:25:07,741 --> 02:25:09,855
So there you got 30,
40 screaming babies

970
02:25:09,856 --> 02:25:11,660
jumping from one bed to another...

971
02:25:11,828 --> 02:25:15,081
switching tags, so now we
do have a real problem.

972
02:25:15,248 --> 02:25:18,501
Piece of shit whoever you are.
What the fuck are you saying?

973
02:25:18,668 --> 02:25:20,002
- Huh?
- You can't find my son.

974
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:21,212
Oh, no, no, no.

975
02:25:21,380 --> 02:25:24,298
Luckily we were there to see that
everything was under control.

976
02:25:24,466 --> 02:25:26,884
If you want, we can put
everything back where it was.

977
02:25:27,052 --> 02:25:28,427
Except there's one problem.

978
02:25:28,595 --> 02:25:31,055
- You gotta meet us halfway.
- Halfway. Tell me.

979
02:25:31,223 --> 02:25:33,307
What do you give a fuck
about who wins the strike?

980
02:25:33,475 --> 02:25:35,768
That's got nothing to do
with me. What did I do?

981
02:25:35,936 --> 02:25:38,521
What did you do? First of
all, you let the scabs in.

982
02:25:38,688 --> 02:25:41,315
Second of all, you got the
cops in there protecting them.

983
02:25:41,483 --> 02:25:44,860
- That's my right. I'm a cop.
- All right, shut the fuck up.

984
02:25:45,028 --> 02:25:47,029
Now, listen to me very carefully.

985
02:25:47,197 --> 02:25:49,150
You're gonna call off
your dogs and let

986
02:25:49,151 --> 02:25:51,200
the strikers work it
out with the bosses.

987
02:25:51,368 --> 02:25:52,410
I want my son back now.

988
02:25:52,577 --> 02:25:55,121
Do that, we'll give you
your kid's new number.

989
02:25:55,288 --> 02:25:58,082
You don't do that, look for your
kid yourself, and good luck.

990
02:25:59,459 --> 02:26:01,001
- So, what is it gonna be?
- Okay.

991
02:26:01,169 --> 02:26:04,171
- I'll call my men off today.
- Attaboy.

992
02:26:04,339 --> 02:26:07,508
You know, Aiello, for a rotten,
rat-bastard son of a bitch...

993
02:26:07,676 --> 02:26:09,468
you're not as stupid as I thought.

994
02:26:11,263 --> 02:26:13,431
- We'll be in touch.
- When will you call?

995
02:26:13,598 --> 02:26:16,809
Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll be in touch with you.

996
02:26:16,977 --> 02:26:18,269
- Bye.
- I gotta know...

997
02:26:22,315 --> 02:26:23,899
- So?
- We got a deal.

998
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:31,282
- To a very smooth talker.
- Yeah.

999
02:26:31,450 --> 02:26:34,076
- Mazel.
- At least.

1000
02:26:34,244 --> 02:26:36,871
- Peggeleh.
- Noodles.

1001
02:26:41,918 --> 02:26:43,961
Where's that switch list?

1002
02:26:44,129 --> 02:26:46,547
- The switch list?
- Yeah.

1003
02:26:47,883 --> 02:26:49,592
- I can't find it.
- What?

1004
02:26:49,759 --> 02:26:51,844
I can't find it.

1005
02:26:52,804 --> 02:26:53,928
What'd you do with it?

1006
02:26:53,929 --> 02:26:55,848
I think I dumped it
with that jacket.

1007
02:26:56,183 --> 02:26:57,600
What a yutz.

1008
02:26:57,767 --> 02:26:59,935
- Oh, Pat.
- Wait a minute, listen.

1009
02:27:00,103 --> 02:27:02,938
Listen, Noodles, Noodles,
wait. I remember.

1010
02:27:03,106 --> 02:27:05,259
The boys' numbers was
odd... Was even,

1011
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:07,026
and the girls' numbers was odd.

1012
02:27:07,194 --> 02:27:09,195
- That's very simple.
- You took good stock.

1013
02:27:09,362 --> 02:27:11,489
Hey, know what? Let's
give him an even number.

1014
02:27:11,656 --> 02:27:14,241
Eight. Let's pick an eight.

1015
02:27:14,493 --> 02:27:15,618
Eight.

1016
02:27:18,497 --> 02:27:20,039
Yeah, it's a good number.

1017
02:27:20,207 --> 02:27:23,083
Wait a minute. What about
the other little pischers?

1018
02:27:24,044 --> 02:27:26,003
We're better than fate.

1019
02:27:26,171 --> 02:27:29,173
We give some the good life,
give it to others up the ass.

1020
02:27:32,344 --> 02:27:35,804
All right, boys, let's
settle up. It's Saturday.

1021
02:27:35,972 --> 02:27:39,266
Settle-shmettle, Peggy, I'm
gonna take mine out in trade.

1022
02:27:39,434 --> 02:27:40,809
Oh, you're such a nudge.

1023
02:27:42,312 --> 02:27:45,689
Hey, you know what? I wish I
was switched when I was a kid.

1024
02:27:46,691 --> 02:27:48,150
What makes you think you weren't?

1025
02:28:04,584 --> 02:28:06,710
I don't believe it.

1026
02:28:07,379 --> 02:28:11,257
Hey, you guys, come here. Take
a look at who's over here.

1027
02:28:11,424 --> 02:28:13,551
- That suit you, Peg?
- Okay, fine, Max.

1028
02:28:13,718 --> 02:28:16,428
- What do you got?
- Over there.

1029
02:28:18,974 --> 02:28:20,808
Well, what...?

1030
02:28:26,064 --> 02:28:30,067
Holy shit. Noodles, Noodles.
Come here, come here.

1031
02:28:30,235 --> 02:28:32,069
Look.

1032
02:28:34,072 --> 02:28:36,490
The blond by the piano.

1033
02:28:39,995 --> 02:28:42,121
- Yeah, who's that? Yeah.
- Who's that?

1034
02:28:42,289 --> 02:28:44,331
You and this broad were
practically engaged.

1035
02:28:44,499 --> 02:28:45,666
Ooh.

1036
02:28:45,834 --> 02:28:50,713
Beat me. Ooh, beat me.
Ooh, I love it. Ha-ha.

1037
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:52,882
Who was it? The Detroit
cock-squasher?

1038
02:28:52,883 --> 02:28:54,311
- Yeah.
- Peggy.

1039
02:28:54,312 --> 02:28:56,093
That's not her, she
looks different.

1040
02:28:56,261 --> 02:28:57,891
You know that
platinum blond in the

1041
02:28:57,892 --> 02:28:59,430
flower dress? She's by the table.

1042
02:28:59,598 --> 02:29:01,682
See her? Call her in, will you?

1043
02:29:08,815 --> 02:29:10,274
- Carol.
- Carol, whatever.

1044
02:29:10,442 --> 02:29:12,329
Just tell her there's
a bunch of her old

1045
02:29:12,330 --> 02:29:13,986
friends here, you
know what I mean?

1046
02:29:16,156 --> 02:29:17,740
Carol.

1047
02:29:17,907 --> 02:29:19,783
Carol.

1048
02:29:24,789 --> 02:29:27,166
Noodles, pfft, come here.

1049
02:29:30,378 --> 02:29:33,797
- Somebody here wants to see you.
- Who?

1050
02:29:34,549 --> 02:29:36,258
You know these guys?

1051
02:29:38,678 --> 02:29:40,554
No.

1052
02:29:42,182 --> 02:29:44,433
I don't think so.

1053
02:29:48,271 --> 02:29:49,772
No. Ha-ha.

1054
02:29:49,939 --> 02:29:53,734
No. I'd remember a bunch of
good-lookers like these.

1055
02:30:11,252 --> 02:30:14,922
Oh, well, how could I forget?

1056
02:30:21,179 --> 02:30:23,430
There was...

1057
02:30:23,598 --> 02:30:29,353
There was only one of you I got
to know personally, though.

1058
02:30:30,939 --> 02:30:32,815
Which one?

1059
02:30:32,982 --> 02:30:36,235
Let's see how good a memory
you've got for faces.

1060
02:30:56,548 --> 02:30:58,257
You.

1061
02:30:59,134 --> 02:31:01,051
No.

1062
02:31:01,302 --> 02:31:02,553
Him.

1063
02:31:02,721 --> 02:31:04,791
We've been hanging out
so long together,

1064
02:31:04,792 --> 02:31:06,306
we're starting to look alike.

1065
02:31:06,474 --> 02:31:08,475
"Hanging out"?

1066
02:31:18,486 --> 02:31:20,904
Charmed.

1067
02:31:38,548 --> 02:31:40,549
You can call me Carol.

1068
02:31:41,468 --> 02:31:43,260
Okay?

1069
02:31:52,061 --> 02:31:54,313
We've already met.

1070
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:14,625
Pleasure.

1071
02:32:15,668 --> 02:32:17,669
The pleasure...

1072
02:32:17,837 --> 02:32:20,214
is all mine.

1073
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:50,077
So you left Detroit, huh?

1074
02:32:50,453 --> 02:32:52,746
No, her and her husband just
come in on the weekends.

1075
02:32:52,914 --> 02:32:55,165
Yeah, it beats the seashore.

1076
02:32:56,125 --> 02:32:58,301
Well, she takes on
maybe 10 guys and her

1077
02:32:58,302 --> 02:33:00,212
hubby watches through
the peephole.

1078
02:33:00,380 --> 02:33:02,506
Beats the hell out of the movies.

1079
02:33:02,674 --> 02:33:05,300
I wonder what that jerk is
up to in his cubbyhole now.

1080
02:33:05,468 --> 02:33:07,761
He must be wondering, where
is his fucking wife?

1081
02:33:15,812 --> 02:33:18,814
Why don't we make it
a threesome, huh?

1082
02:33:19,607 --> 02:33:22,734
Can't you see he's got
other plans for tonight?

1083
02:33:22,902 --> 02:33:26,572
Well, bring her along.
We'll make it a foursome.

1084
02:33:31,452 --> 02:33:34,621
I'm not that kind of guy.

1085
02:33:34,789 --> 02:33:37,122
Besides, I'm afraid
if I give you a good

1086
02:33:37,123 --> 02:33:39,626
crack in the mouth,
you'd probably like it.

1087
02:33:52,932 --> 02:33:55,142
Have a good night, fellas.

1088
02:33:56,019 --> 02:33:58,061
See you later.

1089
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:06,477
They make you dress like those

1090
02:34:06,478 --> 02:34:07,905
lunatics that run
around Germany...

1091
02:34:08,072 --> 02:34:10,282
burning down all
those Jewish stores.

1092
02:34:10,450 --> 02:34:15,120
These lunatics burned our home,
sir, and made us go to America.

1093
02:34:16,122 --> 02:34:18,790
- I'm Jewish too.
- I know, sir.

1094
02:34:18,958 --> 02:34:21,001
Everybody knows.

1095
02:34:21,169 --> 02:34:22,461
Knows what?

1096
02:34:24,005 --> 02:34:26,465
Everybody knows who you are, sir.

1097
02:34:30,553 --> 02:34:31,970
And what do you think?

1098
02:34:32,138 --> 02:34:34,640
I don't think. It's
your business, sir.

1099
02:34:34,807 --> 02:34:36,516
No, you think.

1100
02:34:38,061 --> 02:34:40,479
You think it's a
disgrace, don't you?

1101
02:34:41,105 --> 02:34:43,398
We Jews, sir, don't have
to be like the Italians...

1102
02:34:43,566 --> 02:34:46,234
who look up to the lawbreakers.

1103
02:34:46,402 --> 02:34:49,988
We have enough enemies without
becoming gangsters, sir.

1104
02:34:50,782 --> 02:34:52,866
How much money do you make a week?

1105
02:34:53,576 --> 02:34:55,577
Well, not everybody
tips like you, sir.

1106
02:34:55,745 --> 02:34:58,789
I make enough to go to school
and learn for my degree.

1107
02:34:58,957 --> 02:35:02,125
Good for you. So maybe by the time
you're 60, you'll make enough...

1108
02:35:02,293 --> 02:35:04,795
but then you won't be able
to get it up any more.

1109
02:35:20,770 --> 02:35:23,855
- Been waiting long?
- All my life.

1110
02:35:44,127 --> 02:35:46,379
You wanted a place by
the ocean so I had

1111
02:35:46,380 --> 02:35:48,630
it opened. It was
closed for the season.

1112
02:35:48,798 --> 02:35:51,591
All these tables are
for two people.

1113
02:35:51,926 --> 02:35:54,386
Pick whatever one you want.

1114
02:36:25,918 --> 02:36:27,544
I like this one.

1115
02:36:27,712 --> 02:36:29,838
Here, sit down.

1116
02:36:39,265 --> 02:36:40,919
Oh, I'll have the asperges sauce

1117
02:36:40,920 --> 02:36:42,934
vinaigrette and then
a Châteaubriand.

1118
02:36:46,397 --> 02:36:48,273
I'll decide later.

1119
02:36:48,441 --> 02:36:51,026
- Monsieur?
- I'll have the same.

1120
02:36:52,111 --> 02:36:53,945
For the wine?

1121
02:36:54,113 --> 02:36:56,364
You decide. I'll just have water.

1122
02:36:56,532 --> 02:37:00,494
- You decide.
- Thank you.

1123
02:37:07,794 --> 02:37:09,252
You've been around.

1124
02:37:10,421 --> 02:37:13,548
Where'd you learn all them
"parlez-vous français" dishes?

1125
02:37:13,716 --> 02:37:15,425
Who's teaching you that stuff?

1126
02:37:16,803 --> 02:37:20,055
You mean a sugar daddy who
tries to teach me how to act?

1127
02:37:22,475 --> 02:37:24,017
I read books. I learn everything.

1128
02:37:24,185 --> 02:37:27,854
I want to know everything. Doesn't
it make sense to have plans?

1129
02:37:29,190 --> 02:37:31,441
Yeah, it does.

1130
02:37:31,943 --> 02:37:35,153
What about me? Am
I in these plans?

1131
02:37:37,281 --> 02:37:38,990
Noodles...

1132
02:37:40,409 --> 02:37:43,954
You're the only person
that I have ever...

1133
02:37:44,122 --> 02:37:47,290
Ever what? Go ahead.

1134
02:37:48,709 --> 02:37:50,710
Ever what?

1135
02:37:51,295 --> 02:37:53,839
That I ever cared about.

1136
02:37:54,215 --> 02:37:57,884
But you'd lock me up and you'd
throw away the key, wouldn't you?

1137
02:38:02,390 --> 02:38:04,224
Yeah.

1138
02:38:04,892 --> 02:38:06,977
Yeah, I guess so.

1139
02:38:07,145 --> 02:38:09,271
Yeah.

1140
02:38:09,438 --> 02:38:12,732
And the thing is, I probably
wouldn't even mind.

1141
02:38:15,069 --> 02:38:16,278
So?

1142
02:38:16,279 --> 02:38:19,906
So I got to get to
where I'm going.

1143
02:38:20,074 --> 02:38:22,868
- And where's that?
- To the top.

1144
02:38:26,581 --> 02:38:29,332
Now you sound just like Maxie.

1145
02:38:29,876 --> 02:38:33,253
Youse are both alike, that's why
you hate each other so much.

1146
02:38:33,421 --> 02:38:35,630
Do you want me to leave?

1147
02:38:40,678 --> 02:38:43,221
No, I don't want you to leave.

1148
02:39:05,953 --> 02:39:07,829
You dancing?

1149
02:39:08,706 --> 02:39:10,332
- You asking?
- I'm asking.

1150
02:39:10,499 --> 02:39:12,584
I'm dancing.

1151
02:40:25,366 --> 02:40:27,587
To keep from going crazy, you had

1152
02:40:27,588 --> 02:40:30,078
to cut yourself off
from the world.

1153
02:40:30,246 --> 02:40:32,872
Just not think about
it. You had to...

1154
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:36,334
You know, years that went
by, it seemed like...

1155
02:40:36,502 --> 02:40:39,796
no time at all, because
you're not doing anything.

1156
02:40:39,964 --> 02:40:41,736
But there were two
things I couldn't

1157
02:40:41,737 --> 02:40:43,508
get out of my mind.
One was Dominic.

1158
02:40:43,676 --> 02:40:47,220
The way he said "I slipped"
just before he died.

1159
02:40:48,514 --> 02:40:50,765
The other was you.

1160
02:40:56,981 --> 02:41:01,192
How you used to read me your
Song of Songs, remember?

1161
02:41:02,987 --> 02:41:07,449
How beautiful are your feet in
sandals, O prince's daughter.

1162
02:41:11,078 --> 02:41:13,630
I used to read the
Bible every night.

1163
02:41:13,631 --> 02:41:16,249
Every night I used
to think about you.

1164
02:41:18,502 --> 02:41:23,214
Your navel is a bowl, well-rounded
with no lack of wine.

1165
02:41:23,382 --> 02:41:27,260
Your belly, a heap of wheat
surrounded with lilies.

1166
02:41:27,428 --> 02:41:30,055
Your breasts...

1167
02:41:31,390 --> 02:41:33,850
clusters of grapes.

1168
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:38,897
Your breath,
sweet-scented as apples.

1169
02:41:46,489 --> 02:41:49,949
Nobody's gonna love you
the way I loved you.

1170
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:55,855
There were times I
couldn't stand it

1171
02:41:55,856 --> 02:41:57,582
any more. I used to
think about you.

1172
02:41:57,750 --> 02:42:01,836
I'd think, "Deborah lives.
She's out there. She exists."

1173
02:42:02,004 --> 02:42:04,506
And that would get
me through it all.

1174
02:42:07,051 --> 02:42:09,594
You know how important
that was to me?

1175
02:42:15,851 --> 02:42:18,645
Noodles, I'm leaving
tomorrow to go to Hollywood.

1176
02:42:18,813 --> 02:42:21,439
I wanted to see you
tonight to tell you.

1177
02:44:15,554 --> 02:44:17,222
No.

1178
02:44:17,681 --> 02:44:19,265
No. I...

1179
02:44:19,892 --> 02:44:22,685
No. No. Ah.

1180
02:44:26,315 --> 02:44:31,402
No. Please, no. No, please. No.

1181
02:44:31,570 --> 02:44:36,866
No. Oh, no. No, please.

1182
02:44:37,034 --> 02:44:42,205
No, no. Please, no, no. No.

1183
02:44:45,501 --> 02:44:47,252
No.

1184
02:46:22,139 --> 02:46:23,806
Deborah. Deborah.

1185
02:46:23,974 --> 02:46:26,351
Get away. Get away.

1186
02:46:43,285 --> 02:46:45,244
I'll be right back.

1187
02:47:16,985 --> 02:47:18,778
Take her home.

1188
02:47:19,697 --> 02:47:21,531
Take her home.

1189
02:48:58,712 --> 02:49:00,338
Hi.

1190
02:49:06,345 --> 02:49:07,845
Hi.

1191
02:49:10,766 --> 02:49:12,099
You alone?

1192
02:49:12,267 --> 02:49:15,186
No, I'm with you. I hope.

1193
02:49:17,606 --> 02:49:18,856
Wanna dance?

1194
02:49:19,316 --> 02:49:21,984
No, I'm not up to that.

1195
02:49:22,152 --> 02:49:23,986
You know what I want?

1196
02:49:25,072 --> 02:49:26,364
I wanna get laid.

1197
02:49:28,742 --> 02:49:32,578
- That you're up to?
- Mm. Mm.

1198
02:49:42,965 --> 02:49:45,216
Do you drink like
this every night...

1199
02:49:45,384 --> 02:49:47,593
or is this just a bad night?

1200
02:49:59,690 --> 02:50:01,440
Who are you?

1201
02:50:01,608 --> 02:50:04,318
- Mr. Rockefeller?
- No. No.

1202
02:50:04,486 --> 02:50:06,737
Why, how much did I give you?

1203
02:50:06,905 --> 02:50:09,365
- Fifty.
- Fifty?

1204
02:50:10,534 --> 02:50:12,952
- What's your name?
- Eve.

1205
02:50:21,336 --> 02:50:23,838
I'll call you Deborah.

1206
02:50:24,590 --> 02:50:27,300
I've done more complicated
things for less.

1207
02:50:28,302 --> 02:50:30,219
Deborah.

1208
02:50:30,387 --> 02:50:33,264
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

1209
02:50:41,231 --> 02:50:44,400
You're so beautiful.

1210
02:50:44,943 --> 02:50:47,987
Heh. Thanks.

1211
02:51:17,809 --> 02:51:23,439
Your feet are so
beautiful in sandals.

1212
02:51:24,191 --> 02:51:27,068
Prince's daughter...

1213
02:51:28,195 --> 02:51:30,529
Deborah...

1214
02:51:53,011 --> 02:51:54,720
Deborah.

1215
02:51:57,015 --> 02:51:59,016
Now I'm gonna fuck you.

1216
02:52:00,811 --> 02:52:03,062
Take your time.

1217
02:54:42,055 --> 02:54:44,682
All aboard.

1218
02:57:05,365 --> 02:57:06,907
Well...

1219
02:57:07,575 --> 02:57:09,785
look who's back.

1220
02:57:11,079 --> 02:57:12,830
What's this?

1221
02:57:16,334 --> 02:57:18,085
It's a throne.

1222
02:57:20,255 --> 02:57:22,631
It was a gift to a pope.

1223
02:57:23,508 --> 02:57:27,886
- Cost me 800 bucks.
- It's from the 17th century.

1224
02:57:37,147 --> 02:57:39,606
So, what are you doing with it?

1225
02:57:42,444 --> 02:57:44,320
I'm sitting on it.

1226
02:57:52,620 --> 02:57:55,789
- You got any coffee around?
- Yeah, sure.

1227
02:58:07,635 --> 02:58:09,303
Thanks.

1228
02:59:27,215 --> 02:59:31,969
While you were on vacation,
we were working overtime.

1229
02:59:39,144 --> 02:59:41,270
The union paid off.

1230
02:59:44,149 --> 02:59:46,191
That's your share.

1231
02:59:47,318 --> 02:59:51,613
Yeah. Even that geek. You
know, Jimmy "Clean Hands"...

1232
02:59:51,781 --> 02:59:56,994
respects us. I shed a
little blood for the cause.

1233
02:59:57,745 --> 03:00:00,164
Yeah, it's all in the papers.

1234
03:00:00,331 --> 03:00:04,460
Morning Telegraph,
they didn't like it.

1235
03:00:04,627 --> 03:00:09,465
It says, "Underworld joins
strikers in brutal battle."

1236
03:00:09,632 --> 03:00:13,427
But The Post, they liked it.

1237
03:00:13,595 --> 03:00:17,306
"Ends justify means in
decisive gangland encounter."

1238
03:00:17,724 --> 03:00:20,642
And they're the ones that kvetched
about the Atlantic City job.

1239
03:00:20,810 --> 03:00:24,813
Heh. Newspaper guys never
know what the fuck they want.

1240
03:00:31,738 --> 03:00:34,396
Well, you could
have looked for me.

1241
03:00:34,397 --> 03:00:35,397
We did.

1242
03:00:36,451 --> 03:00:38,911
Cockeye found you at the Chink's.

1243
03:00:39,078 --> 03:00:41,830
So fucking doped up you
didn't even recognise him.

1244
03:00:42,040 --> 03:00:47,211
Yeah, you, Heh. You called
me "Deborah." Ha-ha-ha.

1245
03:00:48,963 --> 03:00:51,298
Hey, go fuck yourself.
Mind your own business.

1246
03:00:51,466 --> 03:00:53,852
We do our business
together and fucking

1247
03:00:53,853 --> 03:00:55,761
broads do not get in the way...

1248
03:00:55,929 --> 03:00:57,221
- and you know it.
- Yeah?

1249
03:00:57,388 --> 03:00:59,640
- Yeah.
- Then what's she doing here?

1250
03:01:00,934 --> 03:01:02,869
Today ain't Saturday.
She should be in

1251
03:01:02,870 --> 03:01:04,853
Detroit, screwing on
the assembly line.

1252
03:01:05,021 --> 03:01:07,648
Well, she's screwing here now.

1253
03:01:07,815 --> 03:01:10,651
And only with Max.

1254
03:01:12,153 --> 03:01:14,112
Oh, yeah?

1255
03:01:14,280 --> 03:01:17,338
With her husband peeping through?

1256
03:01:17,339 --> 03:01:18,867
No, I left him.

1257
03:01:22,914 --> 03:01:24,840
You live with her,
bring her here, and

1258
03:01:24,841 --> 03:01:26,667
you tell me not to
mess with broads.

1259
03:01:26,834 --> 03:01:28,585
- You forget one thing.
- What?

1260
03:01:28,753 --> 03:01:30,921
- I don't give a fuck about her.
- Max...

1261
03:01:31,089 --> 03:01:34,341
- Shut up. Shut up. Shh.
- Maxie, tell me something.

1262
03:01:34,509 --> 03:01:36,343
What you gonna spend
your honeymoon on?

1263
03:01:36,511 --> 03:01:40,556
- Maxie...
- Shut the fuck up. Shut up.

1264
03:01:41,849 --> 03:01:43,934
Just shut up.

1265
03:01:48,398 --> 03:01:50,399
You want me to dump her?

1266
03:01:50,858 --> 03:01:52,693
You want me to kick
her out of here?

1267
03:01:55,029 --> 03:01:57,197
Want me to kick her
ass out or what?

1268
03:01:57,365 --> 03:01:59,914
You want me to
kick...? Get the fuck

1269
03:01:59,915 --> 03:02:02,119
out. Get the fuck out. Get out.

1270
03:02:09,168 --> 03:02:12,004
You gonna tell me I don't have
a way with women? Ha-ha-ha.

1271
03:02:24,809 --> 03:02:27,311
- Hello.
- This is Jimmy. Who's this, Max?

1272
03:02:27,478 --> 03:02:29,688
No, it's Noodles.

1273
03:02:31,858 --> 03:02:35,861
Okay, listen. We're gonna
need you guys today.

1274
03:02:36,029 --> 03:02:39,281
I'm gonna be making a tough
speech, and I think you...

1275
03:02:49,917 --> 03:02:51,960
Go, go.

1276
03:03:13,232 --> 03:03:16,485
Start the engine. I'll
be right with you.

1277
03:03:16,653 --> 03:03:18,840
Mr. Gallagher wants
you to know how

1278
03:03:18,841 --> 03:03:20,906
much he appreciates what you did.

1279
03:03:21,074 --> 03:03:23,492
To show his appreciation...

1280
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:37,047
Here's an envelope for
the both of youse.

1281
03:03:37,215 --> 03:03:41,927
If we gotta complete the
job, I'll let you know.

1282
03:04:18,047 --> 03:04:19,214
Whoa. Whoa.

1283
03:04:19,632 --> 03:04:21,758
Wiped out by a blast
of Cordon Rouge.

1284
03:04:21,926 --> 03:04:24,553
What would Crowning and his
bosses say after that?

1285
03:04:24,721 --> 03:04:27,639
Never be afraid of
you, then, would they?

1286
03:04:27,807 --> 03:04:32,561
They're still not afraid of me. It
was you boys that scared them off.

1287
03:04:32,895 --> 03:04:35,159
And you didn't want
these guys. Aren't

1288
03:04:35,160 --> 03:04:37,190
you lucky you got party leaders...

1289
03:04:37,358 --> 03:04:39,651
like myself who care
about the union?

1290
03:04:39,819 --> 03:04:41,958
Hey, the strike is
settled. We won.

1291
03:04:41,959 --> 03:04:44,156
That's what counts.
Am I right, Jim?

1292
03:04:44,323 --> 03:04:46,221
It was tough for Jimmy
not to be there

1293
03:04:46,222 --> 03:04:48,118
to sign the contract
though, huh, Jim?

1294
03:04:48,286 --> 03:04:49,828
No.

1295
03:04:51,497 --> 03:04:53,758
What's tough is, you
boys did more in one

1296
03:04:53,759 --> 03:04:56,126
night than I could in
two years of talking.

1297
03:04:56,294 --> 03:04:58,712
- Forget it.
- To the hottest newcomer...

1298
03:04:58,880 --> 03:05:00,881
- in American unions.
- There you go.

1299
03:05:01,048 --> 03:05:02,883
- Jimmy Conway.
- Now you're talking.

1300
03:05:03,050 --> 03:05:04,718
Roll out the barrel.

1301
03:05:04,886 --> 03:05:09,181
- May God bless.
- Drink up. Suck it right down.

1302
03:05:09,348 --> 03:05:12,768
You must be crazy giving him
drinks. We're going to operate.

1303
03:05:12,935 --> 03:05:15,703
Oh, what's the rush?
They already told me

1304
03:05:15,704 --> 03:05:18,273
I'd be a gimp for the
rest of my life.

1305
03:05:18,441 --> 03:05:21,225
Don't worry, Jimmy,
with one leg a little

1306
03:05:21,226 --> 03:05:23,612
shy, you're gonna
take giant steps.

1307
03:05:23,780 --> 03:05:27,908
Yeah. And always one step
right behind you, Sharkey?

1308
03:05:28,075 --> 03:05:30,786
Make sure they work on
the right leg, Jim.

1309
03:05:30,953 --> 03:05:33,246
- It's only blood, huh?
- Mazel.

1310
03:05:41,130 --> 03:05:43,632
You boys got yourself
a real martyr

1311
03:05:43,633 --> 03:05:46,134
for a friend. Make
it work for you.

1312
03:05:46,302 --> 03:05:49,513
Yeah, but what the hell are
we gonna do with a martyr?

1313
03:05:49,680 --> 03:05:51,814
Times change.
Prohibition ain't gonna

1314
03:05:51,815 --> 03:05:53,892
last much longer.
Take it from me...

1315
03:05:54,060 --> 03:05:57,268
a lot of you guys
will be out of work.

1316
03:05:57,269 --> 03:06:00,398
Go on, Mr. Sharkey.
We're interested.

1317
03:06:01,818 --> 03:06:05,362
You ever think of setting
yourselves up in business?

1318
03:06:05,738 --> 03:06:08,027
All those trucks
they're using to haul

1319
03:06:08,028 --> 03:06:10,492
liquor, soon be selling
them for nothing.

1320
03:06:10,660 --> 03:06:13,221
I'm talking about
hundreds of vehicles

1321
03:06:13,222 --> 03:06:15,914
controlled by a national
organisation...

1322
03:06:16,082 --> 03:06:19,668
and supported by a powerful
union headed by Jimmy Conway.

1323
03:06:19,836 --> 03:06:23,922
Whatever you ask, there's no
way he can turn you down.

1324
03:06:24,590 --> 03:06:26,633
You gotta be kidding, Sharkey.

1325
03:06:28,845 --> 03:06:32,305
Jimmy "Clean Hands"
in business with us?

1326
03:06:32,807 --> 03:06:36,309
They won't be clean for long,
with the hands he's gonna shake.

1327
03:06:36,477 --> 03:06:39,104
Everything in good time.

1328
03:06:53,953 --> 03:06:55,392
We're not interested.

1329
03:06:55,393 --> 03:06:57,956
What's the matter,
you got a problem?

1330
03:06:58,124 --> 03:07:00,055
We got plenty of money
tucked away. Why

1331
03:07:00,056 --> 03:07:01,793
not invest it? What
is the problem?

1332
03:07:01,961 --> 03:07:06,256
I'll put the party behind you. And
I got friends in high places.

1333
03:07:07,800 --> 03:07:09,547
I'm not interested
in your friends,

1334
03:07:09,548 --> 03:07:11,052
and I don't trust politicians.

1335
03:07:11,220 --> 03:07:13,805
You still think like some
schmuck from the streets.

1336
03:07:13,973 --> 03:07:16,474
If we'd listened to you, we'd
still be rolling drunks.

1337
03:07:17,101 --> 03:07:19,436
- Are you broke?
- Don't bust my balls.

1338
03:07:19,604 --> 03:07:22,647
I am talking about real money.

1339
03:07:23,149 --> 03:07:28,820
This is real money to me. It's a
lot of money. You want any of it?

1340
03:07:29,280 --> 03:07:31,382
You carry that stink
of the streets.

1341
03:07:31,383 --> 03:07:33,700
I like the stink. It
makes me feel good.

1342
03:07:33,868 --> 03:07:37,370
I like the smell of it.
It opens up my lungs.

1343
03:07:38,080 --> 03:07:40,165
And it gives me a hard-on.

1344
03:07:40,333 --> 03:07:42,667
You're carrying
dead weight, Maxie.

1345
03:07:42,835 --> 03:07:46,087
One of these days, you're
gonna have to dump it.

1346
03:07:49,717 --> 03:07:52,510
Maxie. Let me know when
you're gonna dump me.

1347
03:07:52,678 --> 03:07:54,326
Meanwhile, I'll take a vacation in

1348
03:07:54,327 --> 03:07:56,264
Florida. I got a yen
for the seashore.

1349
03:08:19,246 --> 03:08:20,956
Hey.

1350
03:08:22,833 --> 03:08:25,669
Listen, I was thinking
it over and...

1351
03:08:27,046 --> 03:08:31,091
I guess I kind of got a yen
for the seashore myself.

1352
03:08:36,722 --> 03:08:38,306
You wanna go swimming?

1353
03:08:39,183 --> 03:08:43,353
Yeah. Yeah, let's go for a swim.

1354
03:09:00,329 --> 03:09:03,790
Read all about it.
Read all about it.

1355
03:09:05,751 --> 03:09:08,253
Read all about it.

1356
03:09:13,426 --> 03:09:15,719
Read all about it.

1357
03:10:22,828 --> 03:10:24,788
Hey, Maxie.

1358
03:10:25,372 --> 03:10:27,749
- Max.
- Huh?

1359
03:10:27,917 --> 03:10:30,668
How much money we got put away?

1360
03:10:30,920 --> 03:10:32,337
Why?

1361
03:10:35,174 --> 03:10:37,592
Because we're unemployed.

1362
03:10:52,650 --> 03:10:55,151
About a million bucks.

1363
03:10:55,653 --> 03:11:00,365
- Oh, yeah? Where'd you put it?
- In my underwear.

1364
03:11:02,493 --> 03:11:06,204
- I'd have found it there.
- Hey.

1365
03:11:06,455 --> 03:11:08,123
Huh?

1366
03:11:33,399 --> 03:11:37,944
We gotta reorganise, Max. And
I got a couple of good ideas.

1367
03:11:39,321 --> 03:11:41,030
Me too.

1368
03:11:41,323 --> 03:11:44,367
If I had a million
bucks, I'd take it easy.

1369
03:11:44,535 --> 03:11:46,911
We'll take it easy when we got 20.

1370
03:11:48,289 --> 03:11:51,624
- Fifty.
- Where you gonna get that?

1371
03:11:54,962 --> 03:11:56,629
Right here.

1372
03:12:05,973 --> 03:12:07,724
What's that?

1373
03:12:11,145 --> 03:12:13,062
It's a dream.

1374
03:12:15,482 --> 03:12:18,234
A dream I've been
dreaming all my life.

1375
03:12:18,402 --> 03:12:20,466
I swear to God,
Noodles, you and me

1376
03:12:20,467 --> 03:12:22,530
together, we can
make it come true.

1377
03:12:26,452 --> 03:12:27,660
What is it?

1378
03:12:32,958 --> 03:12:34,792
The Federal Reserve Bank.

1379
03:12:38,505 --> 03:12:40,840
It's the biggest step
we can take, Noodles.

1380
03:13:05,032 --> 03:13:06,866
You're really crazy.

1381
03:13:08,077 --> 03:13:10,618
Don't you ever say
that to me. Don't

1382
03:13:10,619 --> 03:13:12,747
you ever say that to me again.

1383
03:14:38,500 --> 03:14:43,379
What chance is there that a crazy
thing like this might succeed?

1384
03:14:44,590 --> 03:14:46,507
Don't ask me, ask Max.

1385
03:14:46,925 --> 03:14:49,770
You know as well as
I do that this is

1386
03:14:49,771 --> 03:14:52,764
suicide, pure and
simple, for everyone.

1387
03:14:53,515 --> 03:14:58,936
Yeah, well, don't tell me, tell
him. You got your own methods.

1388
03:14:59,563 --> 03:15:01,731
Yeah, I tried.

1389
03:15:02,191 --> 03:15:05,276
He doesn't want to screw any more.

1390
03:15:08,238 --> 03:15:11,574
All he thinks about is this job.

1391
03:15:14,078 --> 03:15:17,163
Tear gas, hostages, now
he's gonna do this.

1392
03:15:17,331 --> 03:15:20,750
He's gonna do it
with or without you.

1393
03:15:26,006 --> 03:15:28,299
Noodles, we've never
liked each other.

1394
03:15:33,722 --> 03:15:36,537
We put up with each
other for Max's sake.

1395
03:15:36,538 --> 03:15:39,352
So why don't we just
get together once...

1396
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:42,271
and do something for him?

1397
03:15:51,990 --> 03:15:53,950
And after that...

1398
03:15:54,993 --> 03:15:58,162
we can go back to being enemies.

1399
03:16:06,672 --> 03:16:11,717
You know, if you were
all in jail first...

1400
03:16:11,885 --> 03:16:14,971
there wouldn't be any bank job.

1401
03:16:26,525 --> 03:16:29,193
I got the idea from
your friend Max.

1402
03:16:31,029 --> 03:16:32,238
What do you mean?

1403
03:16:35,325 --> 03:16:38,661
He laughs at you. He
makes fun of you.

1404
03:16:40,497 --> 03:16:43,791
He says Eve has got
you by the balls.

1405
03:16:43,959 --> 03:16:47,879
Every time you walk past this
place, you shit in your pants.

1406
03:16:48,046 --> 03:16:49,947
You'd do anything for
the cops to pick you

1407
03:16:49,948 --> 03:16:51,716
up so you wouldn't
have to do this job.

1408
03:16:51,884 --> 03:16:54,093
Is that true, huh?

1409
03:17:06,815 --> 03:17:08,399
Well, then do it.

1410
03:17:08,567 --> 03:17:11,861
Do it. Put him in jail. Put
him in jail. Not long.

1411
03:17:12,029 --> 03:17:15,907
Just long enough so he can get
the idea out of his mind.

1412
03:17:17,701 --> 03:17:22,830
If you can't stand being away
from him, put yourself there too.

1413
03:17:24,416 --> 03:17:27,335
Better off than being dead.

1414
03:17:31,757 --> 03:17:34,050
You know what to do.

1415
03:17:37,679 --> 03:17:40,515
And if you don't, I will.

1416
03:17:44,353 --> 03:17:46,562
Get out. Take a cab.

1417
03:17:46,730 --> 03:17:49,607
I'm busy. I got things
to do. Get out.

1418
03:17:55,155 --> 03:17:56,280
Noodles?

1419
03:17:57,491 --> 03:18:00,243
Make up your mind fast, huh?

1420
03:19:24,953 --> 03:19:27,038
What's the matter?

1421
03:19:27,539 --> 03:19:30,041
Aren't you having a good time?

1422
03:19:36,840 --> 03:19:39,425
Why are you going out tonight?

1423
03:19:39,968 --> 03:19:43,220
Why bother now that
Prohibition is almost over?

1424
03:19:45,265 --> 03:19:47,340
Everybody's selling. We
got friends who have

1425
03:19:47,341 --> 03:19:49,185
a lot of booze they
wanna get rid of...

1426
03:19:49,353 --> 03:19:53,814
for practically nothing.
So we figure, why not?

1427
03:19:59,988 --> 03:20:01,822
I'm gonna be gone for a while.

1428
03:20:03,075 --> 03:20:05,993
I'll be waiting at the hotel.

1429
03:20:06,828 --> 03:20:10,956
I like it when you come
home late and wake me up.

1430
03:20:16,546 --> 03:20:18,756
I'm not gonna be home tonight.

1431
03:20:25,764 --> 03:20:28,349
I'm not gonna be home
tomorrow either.

1432
03:20:28,767 --> 03:20:32,728
I thought these things only
take a couple of hours.

1433
03:20:39,111 --> 03:20:45,032
Ladies and gents, I drink to the
demise of Fat Moe's speakeasy.

1434
03:20:45,325 --> 03:20:47,827
Who the hell wants to drink
here legally anyway?

1435
03:20:50,330 --> 03:20:53,624
Okay. Come on, Moe, set them
up. Go on, get in there.

1436
03:21:06,722 --> 03:21:08,597
- Here's another one.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1437
03:21:08,765 --> 03:21:10,891
Here's mud in your eye.

1438
03:21:17,566 --> 03:21:19,066
Boys.

1439
03:21:22,612 --> 03:21:24,572
Let's drink to our last shipment.

1440
03:21:24,740 --> 03:21:27,575
Because there's more on board
tonight than just booze.

1441
03:21:27,743 --> 03:21:30,728
It's 10 years of our
lives. Ten years

1442
03:21:30,729 --> 03:21:33,164
that were really worth living.

1443
03:21:33,331 --> 03:21:34,707
Yeah.

1444
03:21:53,310 --> 03:21:55,019
Noodles.

1445
03:21:56,396 --> 03:21:57,980
Noodles.

1446
03:21:59,900 --> 03:22:02,276
- L'chaim.
- L'chaim.

1447
03:22:05,280 --> 03:22:06,864
How long will I have to wait?

1448
03:22:11,536 --> 03:22:15,039
A year and a half, more or less.

1449
03:22:16,708 --> 03:22:18,584
Six months off for good behaviour.

1450
03:22:19,044 --> 03:22:21,212
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't ask.

1451
03:23:56,641 --> 03:23:58,475
Operator.

1452
03:23:59,811 --> 03:24:00,978
Police, please.

1453
03:24:06,985 --> 03:24:09,236
Fifth Precinct. Sergeant Halloran.

1454
03:24:11,990 --> 03:24:13,532
Hello.

1455
03:24:14,492 --> 03:24:17,578
Who's speaking? Can I help you?

1456
03:24:17,746 --> 03:24:19,747
- Hello?
- Yeah.

1457
03:24:22,334 --> 03:24:24,084
I got a good tip for you.

1458
03:24:50,570 --> 03:24:54,365
- Yeah, who is it?
- Yeah, it's Max. Open the door.

1459
03:25:00,246 --> 03:25:03,135
What's the matter
with you? You sick?

1460
03:25:03,136 --> 03:25:04,291
No, I'm fine.

1461
03:25:04,459 --> 03:25:06,126
You don't look it.

1462
03:25:08,171 --> 03:25:10,506
Maybe you'd better stay
home tonight, huh?

1463
03:25:11,591 --> 03:25:14,510
- Why?
- Heh.

1464
03:25:16,972 --> 03:25:19,890
You know, I've been
watching you all night.

1465
03:25:21,393 --> 03:25:23,644
And you've been
drinking like a fish.

1466
03:25:24,980 --> 03:25:27,064
Trying to get your courage up?

1467
03:25:31,027 --> 03:25:34,321
We're only bringing in
a shipment of booze.

1468
03:25:35,824 --> 03:25:37,741
It's got so you're even
scared to do that.

1469
03:25:40,829 --> 03:25:43,580
Maybe you just better
stay home tonight.

1470
03:25:44,624 --> 03:25:46,166
With Eve. Heheheh.

1471
03:25:56,511 --> 03:26:00,931
Hey, Maxie, everywhere you
go, I go too. Remember that.

1472
03:26:10,775 --> 03:26:13,235
Maybe Sharkey was right.

1473
03:26:13,403 --> 03:26:16,196
Maybe I ought to just dump you.

1474
03:26:25,331 --> 03:26:26,915
You're really crazy.

1475
03:26:27,083 --> 03:26:29,001
Never say that.

1476
03:26:29,461 --> 03:26:31,795
Don't say it.

1477
03:26:39,304 --> 03:26:43,599
Max made fools of us,
Noodles. He wanted to die.

1478
03:26:43,767 --> 03:26:46,810
Did you know his old man
died in the nut house?

1479
03:26:46,978 --> 03:26:49,813
Max didn't want to
end up the same way.

1480
03:26:50,023 --> 03:26:54,026
So he put the idea in our
heads to tip off the cops.

1481
03:26:54,194 --> 03:26:59,198
And when they stopped the truck,
Max started shooting first...

1482
03:26:59,365 --> 03:27:02,743
just to get himself killed.

1483
03:27:19,719 --> 03:27:22,179
What is this?

1484
03:27:25,225 --> 03:27:26,391
Opening night.

1485
03:27:27,894 --> 03:27:30,145
Fifteen years ago.

1486
03:27:30,772 --> 03:27:31,980
Who's this?

1487
03:27:34,901 --> 03:27:36,568
Patron saint of the place.

1488
03:27:37,904 --> 03:27:41,532
And some actress.

1489
03:27:42,325 --> 03:27:43,700
Do you know her?

1490
03:27:45,703 --> 03:27:47,246
No.

1491
03:28:15,775 --> 03:28:18,443
This proves me base:

1492
03:28:19,112 --> 03:28:20,904
If she first meet the
curled Antony...

1493
03:28:21,072 --> 03:28:23,073
he'll make demand of her,
and spend that kiss...

1494
03:28:23,241 --> 03:28:25,659
which is my heaven to have.

1495
03:28:48,850 --> 03:28:51,476
Come, thou mortal wretch.

1496
03:28:53,813 --> 03:28:56,128
With thy sharp teeth this knot

1497
03:28:56,129 --> 03:28:58,984
intrinsicate of
life at once untie:

1498
03:29:01,196 --> 03:29:03,572
Poor venomous fool.

1499
03:29:05,783 --> 03:29:09,077
Be angry, and dispatch.

1500
03:29:11,497 --> 03:29:15,042
O, couldst thou speak...

1501
03:29:15,210 --> 03:29:19,379
that I might hear thee call
great Caesar ass unpolicied.

1502
03:29:19,547 --> 03:29:22,341
- O eastern star.
- Peace, peace.

1503
03:29:22,508 --> 03:29:24,718
Dost thou not see my
baby at my breast...

1504
03:29:24,886 --> 03:29:28,305
that sucks the nurse asleep?
O, break. O, break.

1505
03:29:28,473 --> 03:29:31,225
As sweet as balm...

1506
03:29:31,392 --> 03:29:35,604
as soft as air, as gentle...

1507
03:29:37,106 --> 03:29:39,441
O Antony.

1508
03:29:47,200 --> 03:29:49,660
Nay, I will take thee too.

1509
03:29:57,126 --> 03:29:58,794
What should I stay...?

1510
03:29:58,962 --> 03:30:01,296
In this vile world?

1511
03:30:01,464 --> 03:30:03,799
So, fare thee well.

1512
03:30:03,967 --> 03:30:06,061
Now boast thee, death, in thy

1513
03:30:06,062 --> 03:30:08,804
possession lies a
lass unparallel'd.

1514
03:30:08,972 --> 03:30:10,889
Downy windows, close...

1515
03:30:11,057 --> 03:30:15,352
and golden Phoebus never be
beheld of eyes again so royal.

1516
03:30:15,520 --> 03:30:19,523
Your crown's awry. I'll
mend it, and then play.

1517
03:30:56,644 --> 03:30:58,937
Hello, Deborah.

1518
03:31:06,529 --> 03:31:09,197
Aren't you gonna say anything?

1519
03:31:15,955 --> 03:31:19,291
What is someone supposed
to say after...

1520
03:31:19,917 --> 03:31:22,961
more than 30 years.

1521
03:31:28,092 --> 03:31:34,056
Well, how about, "How you
doing? You're looking good."

1522
03:31:36,059 --> 03:31:39,227
Or, "I was hoping I'd
never see you again."

1523
03:31:41,647 --> 03:31:44,649
I never thought I would.

1524
03:31:45,735 --> 03:31:48,070
There's a difference.

1525
03:31:48,237 --> 03:31:51,323
Yeah. At least you recognise
me, that's something.

1526
03:31:51,991 --> 03:31:54,701
Actresses have good memories.

1527
03:32:04,837 --> 03:32:07,172
You want a drink?

1528
03:32:11,386 --> 03:32:13,804
I'm having one.

1529
03:32:24,232 --> 03:32:25,273
Margo?

1530
03:32:27,026 --> 03:32:29,736
- Yes, miss?
- That's all for now. You can go.

1531
03:32:29,904 --> 03:32:32,280
All right, miss.

1532
03:32:36,994 --> 03:32:39,871
She called you "miss."

1533
03:32:40,206 --> 03:32:42,624
You never got married?

1534
03:32:43,459 --> 03:32:45,085
No.

1535
03:32:48,673 --> 03:32:50,215
You live alone?

1536
03:32:58,349 --> 03:32:59,975
No.

1537
03:33:06,691 --> 03:33:09,025
Where were you?

1538
03:33:11,946 --> 03:33:14,364
I was out of town.

1539
03:33:17,201 --> 03:33:19,995
Have you been back long?

1540
03:33:20,955 --> 03:33:23,373
A couple of days.

1541
03:33:23,541 --> 03:33:25,792
Are you staying?

1542
03:33:37,430 --> 03:33:38,847
That depends.

1543
03:33:41,767 --> 03:33:43,852
Why do you want to see me?

1544
03:33:45,688 --> 03:33:48,023
Two reasons.

1545
03:33:48,191 --> 03:33:51,443
First, I wanted to see if
you did the right thing...

1546
03:33:51,611 --> 03:33:53,695
turning me down to
become an actress.

1547
03:33:57,867 --> 03:33:59,451
Well?

1548
03:34:02,246 --> 03:34:04,664
You did. You're terrific.

1549
03:34:20,264 --> 03:34:23,350
"Age cannot wither her."

1550
03:34:23,559 --> 03:34:26,561
It's like the play
was written for you.

1551
03:34:30,024 --> 03:34:31,566
What was the other reason?

1552
03:34:32,693 --> 03:34:34,986
The other reason...

1553
03:34:38,199 --> 03:34:42,536
is to decide whether I should
go to a party tomorrow night.

1554
03:34:49,252 --> 03:34:50,794
A party?

1555
03:34:54,090 --> 03:34:55,298
Yeah, on Long Island.

1556
03:34:58,094 --> 03:35:01,263
A Secretary Bailey.

1557
03:35:04,892 --> 03:35:07,269
Do you know Secretary Bailey?

1558
03:35:09,230 --> 03:35:10,313
No.

1559
03:35:12,483 --> 03:35:15,068
But I was invited anyway.

1560
03:35:23,411 --> 03:35:26,329
But if you don't know each
other, why were you invited?

1561
03:35:26,497 --> 03:35:28,164
I don't know.

1562
03:35:29,792 --> 03:35:31,835
I thought you might know why.

1563
03:35:32,753 --> 03:35:34,254
Me?

1564
03:35:34,463 --> 03:35:36,089
Why me?

1565
03:35:41,387 --> 03:35:43,430
Because you know him.

1566
03:35:44,890 --> 03:35:46,349
- Who is it?
- David.

1567
03:35:46,517 --> 03:35:49,185
- No, David.
- Can I come in?

1568
03:35:49,395 --> 03:35:52,230
No, no, no. Just wait outside,
David, I'll call you.

1569
03:35:52,440 --> 03:35:54,816
Okay, I'll be right here.

1570
03:35:57,612 --> 03:35:59,787
What does Secretary
Bailey want from me?

1571
03:35:59,788 --> 03:36:01,406
You came here to ask me that?

1572
03:36:01,616 --> 03:36:03,231
Why did he send me an invitation?

1573
03:36:03,232 --> 03:36:04,576
I don't know. I don't know.

1574
03:36:04,785 --> 03:36:07,030
Why should...? Why
should I know about your

1575
03:36:07,031 --> 03:36:09,122
invitations? I don't
know anything. I...

1576
03:36:09,332 --> 03:36:11,388
What do you want
from me? Why did you

1577
03:36:11,389 --> 03:36:13,335
come here? I know
nothing, nothing.

1578
03:36:13,502 --> 03:36:16,171
Now you're a lousy actress.

1579
03:36:19,175 --> 03:36:21,843
Who is Secretary Bailey?

1580
03:36:30,603 --> 03:36:34,230
Secretary Bailey is
a rich businessman.

1581
03:36:39,945 --> 03:36:42,411
He came to the United
States as a starving

1582
03:36:42,412 --> 03:36:44,532
immigrant and made
a lot of money...

1583
03:36:44,742 --> 03:36:48,620
in San Francisco and Los Angeles,
where he's lived for 30 years.

1584
03:36:48,788 --> 03:36:52,874
I know all that. It's all in the
papers. What else is there?

1585
03:36:59,382 --> 03:37:02,384
He married a very wealthy woman.

1586
03:37:03,678 --> 03:37:06,012
They had a child.

1587
03:37:06,389 --> 03:37:08,098
She died when the child was born.

1588
03:37:10,017 --> 03:37:14,562
A few years ago, he went
into politics. Moved here.

1589
03:37:14,730 --> 03:37:17,227
That's all past history.
I'm not talking

1590
03:37:17,228 --> 03:37:19,359
about that. I'm talking about now.

1591
03:37:19,944 --> 03:37:22,904
Right now he's in trouble.

1592
03:37:24,073 --> 03:37:25,941
Why can't you just
tell me you've been

1593
03:37:25,942 --> 03:37:27,617
living with him all these years...

1594
03:37:27,785 --> 03:37:29,744
and that you're his lover?

1595
03:37:38,587 --> 03:37:41,589
Age can wither me, Noodles.

1596
03:37:45,302 --> 03:37:47,929
We're both getting old.

1597
03:37:53,269 --> 03:37:56,563
All that we have left
now are our memories.

1598
03:37:59,483 --> 03:38:01,745
If you go to that
party on Saturday

1599
03:38:01,746 --> 03:38:04,070
night, you won't
have those any more.

1600
03:38:06,741 --> 03:38:09,284
Tear up that invitation.

1601
03:38:11,454 --> 03:38:14,289
There's an exit back this way.

1602
03:38:15,082 --> 03:38:18,126
Noodles, go through it.

1603
03:38:20,713 --> 03:38:22,547
Keep walking.

1604
03:38:22,715 --> 03:38:25,133
Don't turn around.

1605
03:38:26,260 --> 03:38:28,511
Please, Noodles.

1606
03:38:28,679 --> 03:38:31,806
I'm begging you. Please.

1607
03:38:38,272 --> 03:38:40,982
Are you afraid that I'll
turn into a pillar of salt?

1608
03:38:45,279 --> 03:38:49,073
If you go out that door, yes.

1609
03:39:47,299 --> 03:39:50,260
This is Secretary Bailey's son.

1610
03:39:50,469 --> 03:39:53,972
His name's David, just like yours.

1611
03:42:26,458 --> 03:42:31,879
I must admit, this party was a
wonderful idea, Mr. Secretary.

1612
03:42:32,047 --> 03:42:33,927
It's a bit like
saying, "I'm going up

1613
03:42:33,928 --> 03:42:35,758
before the committee
in five days...

1614
03:42:35,926 --> 03:42:38,302
but my conscience is clear.

1615
03:42:38,470 --> 03:42:42,348
The most important people
in New York are my guests."

1616
03:42:42,516 --> 03:42:44,225
It's going to be a
night to remember.

1617
03:42:46,061 --> 03:42:48,021
Especially if the house blows up.

1618
03:42:48,814 --> 03:42:51,024
Where are you putting
the next bomb?

1619
03:42:52,526 --> 03:42:54,610
In the freezer...

1620
03:42:55,237 --> 03:42:57,530
or in the toilet?

1621
03:43:05,247 --> 03:43:07,957
You can't even think
straight any more.

1622
03:43:09,251 --> 03:43:11,502
I'll tell you something.

1623
03:43:11,670 --> 03:43:13,571
There's a waiting
list of people who'd

1624
03:43:13,572 --> 03:43:15,423
like to send flowers
to your funeral.

1625
03:43:18,594 --> 03:43:20,970
I can point out 10 of them right
now, if you'd like me to.

1626
03:43:21,138 --> 03:43:22,680
Yes.

1627
03:43:22,848 --> 03:43:25,273
But none of them wants
to read my obituary

1628
03:43:25,274 --> 03:43:27,810
in front of the committee
as much as you do.

1629
03:43:27,978 --> 03:43:29,562
You and your union.

1630
03:43:33,025 --> 03:43:35,693
We just wanna resolve this
situation, clean and legal.

1631
03:43:35,861 --> 03:43:39,405
I've heard that same song from
you for 35 fucking years.

1632
03:43:39,573 --> 03:43:42,366
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1633
03:43:43,660 --> 03:43:45,640
I helped you to
make a fortune, you

1634
03:43:45,641 --> 03:43:47,455
and the rest of those parasites.

1635
03:43:47,623 --> 03:43:49,582
It was a reasonable arrangement...

1636
03:43:49,750 --> 03:43:53,294
between labour and management.

1637
03:43:53,462 --> 03:43:57,256
Two percent for them and
40 percent for you.

1638
03:43:57,424 --> 03:44:00,384
You defend them and you
screw them. Come on.

1639
03:44:00,928 --> 03:44:03,304
It's been the story of your life.

1640
03:44:04,181 --> 03:44:06,745
Think anybody believes
you any more?

1641
03:44:06,746 --> 03:44:07,746
Some.

1642
03:44:08,435 --> 03:44:11,020
But no one believes
in you any more...

1643
03:44:11,188 --> 03:44:14,315
because you've made
mistakes and I haven't.

1644
03:44:15,567 --> 03:44:18,820
But that's beside the point.

1645
03:44:20,155 --> 03:44:22,865
The important thing
right now is that...

1646
03:44:23,033 --> 03:44:26,869
you and I straighten out these
transfers of authority.

1647
03:44:28,831 --> 03:44:31,916
Now, it's all as we've agreed.

1648
03:44:34,378 --> 03:44:37,880
I've had our lawyers draw it up.

1649
03:44:39,007 --> 03:44:41,300
All you have to do is sign.

1650
03:44:49,685 --> 03:44:52,145
My last will?

1651
03:44:53,480 --> 03:44:55,982
You're in no position
to exercise your will.

1652
03:44:58,527 --> 03:44:59,944
I give up everything.

1653
03:45:02,656 --> 03:45:04,657
Twelve percent will be
set aside for your boy.

1654
03:45:05,492 --> 03:45:07,952
That way he can be assured...

1655
03:45:08,120 --> 03:45:10,705
of living to a ripe old age.

1656
03:45:10,873 --> 03:45:15,209
Or not, if I don't sign.?

1657
03:46:24,529 --> 03:46:27,406
Why don't you take care
of this yourself, Max?

1658
03:46:28,867 --> 03:46:30,576
I'd be very happy for
you tonight if...

1659
03:46:30,744 --> 03:46:33,246
during all the noise of the
party, I heard a shot.

1660
03:46:33,413 --> 03:46:35,706
Maybe you will.

1661
03:47:47,904 --> 03:47:49,739
Please go in.

1662
03:48:04,129 --> 03:48:06,297
What are you waiting for?

1663
03:48:10,135 --> 03:48:12,595
I don't understand, Mr. Bailey.

1664
03:48:39,289 --> 03:48:41,374
Sit down, Noodles.

1665
03:48:45,629 --> 03:48:47,421
Make yourself comfortable.

1666
03:49:05,816 --> 03:49:08,526
I'm glad you accepted
my invitation.

1667
03:49:08,693 --> 03:49:10,694
Well, I was curious.

1668
03:49:13,657 --> 03:49:16,784
So many important
people in one place.

1669
03:49:16,993 --> 03:49:20,871
Yes. Well, the rats usually
desert a sinking ship.

1670
03:49:21,331 --> 03:49:25,501
But in my case, they appear
to be flocking on board.

1671
03:49:36,888 --> 03:49:40,724
Yeah, well, I read about your
troubles in the newspapers.

1672
03:49:42,102 --> 03:49:44,406
But a man in your
position, with all

1673
03:49:44,407 --> 03:49:46,772
your power and all
your privileges...

1674
03:49:46,982 --> 03:49:51,235
has to assume a certain
amount of responsibility...

1675
03:49:51,903 --> 03:49:54,363
a certain amount of risk.

1676
03:50:01,830 --> 03:50:04,582
Why'd you ask me to
come here, Mr. Bailey?

1677
03:50:07,919 --> 03:50:12,423
That invitation doesn't mean a
goddamn thing, and you know it.

1678
03:50:12,799 --> 03:50:16,343
All that counts is what
was in that suitcase.

1679
03:50:18,013 --> 03:50:20,806
The money and the contract.

1680
03:50:23,560 --> 03:50:26,061
It didn't say who the
contract was on, though.

1681
03:50:28,106 --> 03:50:30,524
Haven't you figured that out yet?

1682
03:50:32,152 --> 03:50:33,777
You, Mr. Bailey?

1683
03:50:47,584 --> 03:50:51,295
I haven't had a gun in my
hand for many, many years.

1684
03:50:52,923 --> 03:50:58,469
My eyes aren't too good, even
with my glasses. My hands shake.

1685
03:51:01,348 --> 03:51:03,693
And I wouldn't wanna
miss, Mr. Bailey.

1686
03:51:03,694 --> 03:51:05,351
Cut the bullshit, Noodles.

1687
03:51:06,895 --> 03:51:09,647
I'm already a dead man.

1688
03:51:10,565 --> 03:51:14,985
At least give me the chance to
settle the debt that I owe to you.

1689
03:51:15,654 --> 03:51:18,948
I'll never make it before the
investigating committee.

1690
03:51:19,115 --> 03:51:23,285
They're scared to death I'll
implicate the whole bunch of them.

1691
03:51:23,662 --> 03:51:25,871
They gotta get rid of me.

1692
03:51:28,542 --> 03:51:31,502
Today is as good a day as any.

1693
03:51:33,672 --> 03:51:36,048
You do it, Noodles.

1694
03:51:37,008 --> 03:51:40,386
You're the only person
I can accept it from.

1695
03:51:47,102 --> 03:51:49,853
You see, I found out
where you were.

1696
03:51:50,021 --> 03:51:53,107
I brought you back here for this.

1697
03:51:54,442 --> 03:51:57,653
To even the score
between you and me.

1698
03:52:00,031 --> 03:52:02,491
You can get out through there.

1699
03:52:09,749 --> 03:52:14,295
It leads right down to the
street. Nobody will see you.

1700
03:52:21,052 --> 03:52:23,298
I don't know what
you're talking about,

1701
03:52:23,299 --> 03:52:25,431
Mr. Bailey. You don't
owe me a thing.

1702
03:52:33,398 --> 03:52:36,502
Your eyes were too
full of tears to see

1703
03:52:36,503 --> 03:52:39,528
it wasn't me burned
up on that street.

1704
03:52:40,363 --> 03:52:42,239
It was somebody else.

1705
03:52:43,825 --> 03:52:48,746
You were too shocked to realise
that the cops were in on it too.

1706
03:52:49,372 --> 03:52:52,583
That was a syndicate
operation, Noodles.

1707
03:53:02,886 --> 03:53:05,012
You're crazy.

1708
03:53:07,349 --> 03:53:11,602
You said that to me once
before, a long time ago.

1709
03:53:11,895 --> 03:53:15,356
But my mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment.

1710
03:53:16,107 --> 03:53:19,610
I took away your
whole life from you.

1711
03:53:19,819 --> 03:53:22,655
I've been living in your place.

1712
03:53:23,698 --> 03:53:26,492
I took everything.

1713
03:53:27,786 --> 03:53:30,079
I took your money.

1714
03:53:30,705 --> 03:53:32,915
I took your girl.

1715
03:53:33,625 --> 03:53:38,420
All I left for you was 35 years
of grief over having killed me.

1716
03:53:40,006 --> 03:53:42,007
Now, why don't you shoot?

1717
03:55:16,686 --> 03:55:19,605
It's true, I have killed
people, Mr. Bailey.

1718
03:55:19,814 --> 03:55:24,568
Sometimes to defend myself,
sometimes for money.

1719
03:55:24,736 --> 03:55:27,404
And many people
used to come to us.

1720
03:55:27,614 --> 03:55:30,532
Business partners, rivals...

1721
03:55:30,909 --> 03:55:33,076
lovers.

1722
03:55:33,453 --> 03:55:37,581
Some of the jobs we took
and some we didn't.

1723
03:55:50,970 --> 03:55:53,931
Yours is one we would
never touch, Mr. Bailey.

1724
03:55:54,808 --> 03:55:56,850
Is this your way of
getting revenge?

1725
03:56:01,606 --> 03:56:03,315
No.

1726
03:56:06,653 --> 03:56:09,780
It's just the way I see things.

1727
03:57:12,468 --> 03:57:14,386
It's 10:25...

1728
03:57:16,431 --> 03:57:19,433
and I've got nothing left to lose.

1729
03:57:21,728 --> 03:57:25,814
When you've been betrayed
by a friend, you hit back.

1730
03:57:30,862 --> 03:57:32,696
Do it.

1731
03:57:54,677 --> 03:57:57,471
You see, Mr. Secretary...

1732
03:57:59,474 --> 03:58:01,558
I have a story also.

1733
03:58:02,352 --> 03:58:04,561
A little simpler than yours.

1734
03:58:06,189 --> 03:58:10,901
Many years ago I had a
friend, a dear friend.

1735
03:58:12,528 --> 03:58:15,781
I turned him in to
save his life...

1736
03:58:15,990 --> 03:58:18,283
but he was killed.

1737
03:58:19,577 --> 03:58:22,412
But he wanted it that way.

1738
03:58:23,331 --> 03:58:25,666
It was a great friendship.

1739
03:58:28,753 --> 03:58:32,798
It went bad for him and
it went bad for me too.

1740
03:58:37,637 --> 03:58:39,930
Good night, Mr. Bailey.

1741
03:58:49,107 --> 03:58:52,818
I hope the investigation
turns out to be nothing.

1742
03:58:54,737 --> 03:58:58,782
It'd be a shame to see a
lifetime of work go to waste.
