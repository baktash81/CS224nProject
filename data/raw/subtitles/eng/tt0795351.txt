1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,545
I can see you.

3
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,300
...pull into this gas station,
the guy was like,

4
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,760
"Yo, man, you got problems."

5
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,471
Like, "What the hell do you think
I pulled in here for?"

6
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:58,641
So your car broke down
on the way to your blood check.

7
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,019
Yeah, smoke, everything.

8
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,982
I'm willing to give you the benefit
of the doubt, Javier, but a judge won't.

9
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,235
I missed a couple of meetings?
What's the problem?

10
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,112
I mean,
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

11
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,157
You're here because your son has
gotten into fights every day at school,

12
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,077
and the last one sent one of his
classmates to the hospital.

13
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,787
Juanita came here for help voluntarily

14
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,247
before the court stepped in
and made it mandatory,

15
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,583
that's what you're doing here.

16
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,835
He's on a dangerous road.

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,589
Your history, all the violence,
all the anger,

18
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,634
that's his future
unless you break the cycle.

19
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,178
- I heard you, Mrs Lynch.
- You're trying to steal my boy!

20
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,514
No one is trying to steal your child.

21
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,516
- Then what are you trying...
- They found bruises

22
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,059
- and cigarette burns...
- I told you,

23
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,936
he was playing with some sparklers.

24
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,729
Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report.

25
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,648
I wanna talk to my own doctor.
I want a lawyer.

26
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,566
If you feel
that you need legal representation

27
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,610
- that's perfectly within your rights...
- I don't need your help, in no case.

28
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,489
- You've already interfered enough.
- You... Hello?

29
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,537
- How many active cases you got?
- Thirty-eight.

30
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,749
- Okay.
- Wayne, come on!

31
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:08,169
- Look, I'm buried here.
- I'm sorry, Em, we all are.

32
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,078
- You have three new voice messages.
- Hi.

33
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,624
Hey, it's Suze, missed you at yoga
the other day, give me a call.

34
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:13,128
Hey, Em, it's Jackie. Just checking in,
hope you're good.

35
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,590
Exhausted,
her career path questionable,

36
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,093
her faith in mankind shaken,

37
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,137
she resisted her tendency
toward introspection

38
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,807
and decides to go have a drink
with her charming friend Doug.

39
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,686
- I am so in your head.
- Be honest.

40
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,148
The whole psychology thing,
it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it?

41
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,859
Regrettably, yes. Two.

42
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,154
Well, what are we gonna
drink to tonight?

43
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,114
The never-ending fun
of a career in public service?

44
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,282
Yeah.

45
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,453
You know,
I sit there talking to these families,

46
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,246
the authority on everything.

47
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,709
And I have these moments
where I think I might be totally full of it.

48
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,045
Everybody's full of it.

49
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,965
In the end you're a number to call
for people who don't have anyone else.

50
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,967
There's no way that's bad.

51
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:07,849
Anyway, I've done some soul searching

52
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,143
and I just want to say

53
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,355
that if a full-on relationship
feels like too much right now,

54
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,524
I'd be willing to consider
a purely physical one.

55
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,737
- What?
- Nothing.

56
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,658
- What, you might actually enjoy yourself.
- Yeah, yeah, I probably would.

57
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:30,455
- It's just...
- I know, I know, the job,

58
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,833
you get home, no time for anybody else.
Whatever.

59
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,169
Listen, I'm giving you a month. Okay?
One month.

60
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,630
- And then?
- I don't know.

61
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,383
Probably give you another month,
but that is it.

62
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,219
Except for two more, then, it's over.

63
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,688
If it were anyone...

64
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,749
What are they doing to you?

65
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,016
- What?
- Emily Jenkins. Child Services?

66
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,642
We spoke on the phone?

67
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,687
- You said the 17th.
- It's the 17th.

68
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,732
- Is not.
- I'm sorry, but it is.

69
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,321
Monday the 17th.
The day of our appointment.

70
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,182
Hi.

71
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,478
Come down, I'd like to meet you.

72
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,120
My name's Emily. What's yours?

73
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,083
- Lily.
- That's a pretty name.

74
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,921
Is there somewhere we can talk?

75
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,384
So, when are you
expecting your husband back?

76
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:35,098
Because we've found that it's better
when the whole family participates.

77
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,934
Well, he's not here, so...

78
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,769
Do you have some way
of contacting him?

79
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,105
Not if I don't know where he is.

80
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,358
Is that...

81
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,612
Would you mind asking him
to join us, please?

82
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,533
- He doesn't have anything to say.
- Will you ask him, please?

83
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,416
Edward.

84
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,252
That lady is here from the state.
She wants to talk to you.

85
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,421
I don't have anything to say, tell her that!

86
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,174
I told her already, she wants to anyway.

87
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,179
It'll be okay.

88
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,649
Hi, I'm Emily.

89
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,945
Okay.

90
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm here because we received a call

91
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,494
that Lilith
is showing serious signs of neglect.

92
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:42,540
Now at this point we can only assume
it's the result of family problems.

93
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,473
Eddie says
we don't have family problems.

94
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,226
Well, many families won't realise
that they're having problems

95
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,229
until it's too late.
And that's where we come in.

96
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,106
We help families communicate

97
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,275
and learn healthier ways
of resolving conflict.

98
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,660
Eddie says we don't need your help.

99
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,581
Mr Sullivan, is there a reason
why you won't speak to me directly?

100
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,630
Is there a reason why your husband
won't speak to me directly?

101
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,348
Eddie doesn't like speaking out of anger.

102
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,700
There's no laws
against being weird, Em.

103
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,827
I didn't say weird, I said scary.

104
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,329
That man sat there
staring at me the whole time,

105
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,999
and the mother is his emotional slave.

106
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,585
Wait, you didn't just fly to New York
and meet with my parents, did you?

107
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,253
Wayne?

108
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,048
All right. All right.
Are there any cuts, any bruises,

109
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,632
any signs she's being abused?

110
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:18,345
No, not physically.
But this girl's in trouble, I can feel it.

111
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,763
You wanna know what I can feel?

112
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,265
The lawsuit we're gonna get hit with
if we violate her parents' rights

113
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,434
without any evidence
they've done something wrong.

114
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,062
All right, Wayne.
You put these files on my desk

115
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,772
and you ask me to tell you
what's going on.

116
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,525
I've told you, I've done my job,
what you do with it is yours.

117
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,256
We're not perfect parents,
we know that,

118
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,050
but we figure if they know
how much you love them

119
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,053
a lot of the other stuff
takes care of itself.

120
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,018
She knows how we feel about her.

121
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,313
So, tell me, Mr Sullivan,

122
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,358
since you've suddenly acquired
the ability to speak,

123
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,859
doesn't it concern you a little

124
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,488
that Lily's grades have dropped
from A's to D's in three months?

125
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,824
Of course it does, she's our daughter.

126
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,536
So you have no idea why your daughter
falls asleep in class every day?

127
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,163
Why she can't sleep at home? No idea?

128
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,544
Bad dreams maybe?

129
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,507
Don't tell me you're buying
this whole "daddy's little girl" routine?

130
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,884
Look, they're not my favourite people
either, okay?

131
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,679
But we can't guarantee every kid
a happy childhood. I wish we could.

132
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,015
Let me talk to her.
She wants to talk. Alone.

133
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,560
- Em, we do not have a case.
- Just five minutes, okay?

134
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,396
Talk to them
about how much they love kids.

135
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,781
Hey, girls, slow down!

136
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,870
I used to wish I had a sister
when I was growing up.

137
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,413
To play with and to talk to

138
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,208
about all those things that you
just can't tell anybody else, you know?

139
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:15,170
Did you ever wish that?
That you had a sister?

144
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,684
Well, that was a silly thing to do,
wasn't it?

145
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,064
What's happening with you?

146
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,281
You know I can help. Let me help you.

147
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,993
What is it, sweetheart?

148
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,499
They hate me.

149
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,585
I'm sure they don't hate you.

150
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,546
They do. I hear them.

151
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,136
They go into the cellar and talk.

152
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,014
What do they talk about?

153
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,978
Sending me to hell.

154
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,982
You heard them say that?

155
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,617
You can tell him. He's on your side.
It's okay.

156
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,708
Lily, did you hear your parents say
they were gonna hurt you?

157
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:23,673
I was just thinking about you,
got a nice letter from Sandy Hutchinson.

158
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,720
Well, well, well.

159
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,306
It's sitting right in front of me,
which means our good friend Wayne

160
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,392
has decided it fails to meet the criteria
for child endangerment

161
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,062
and has told you in no uncertain terms
to leave it alone.

162
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,231
- Surprise, surprise.
- I'm sorry, Emily. I can't.

163
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,942
Please, Mike, I'm really desperate here.

164
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,743
Emily.

165
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,706
Now, you know how dear to my heart
the work you do is,

166
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,377
but the department doesn't pay me
to stake out potential child abusers.

167
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,462
Last time almost cost me my job.

168
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:07,008
This little girl heard her parents say
they're going to send her to hell.

169
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,427
Sickening as that is,

170
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,515
you're a part of the system that
deals with those situations, I'm not.

171
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,767
But sometimes the system doesn't work.

172
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,144
Well, maybe you should just let it.

173
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,980
Wow. Feel like
I'm talking to Wayne here.

174
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,359
All right. You don't want to get involved,
that's fine,

175
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,320
but don't bullshit me, Mike,
I'm running out of people I respect.

176
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,783
Okay. No bullshit. Bring me evidence
of a crime, I'm all over it. Till then...

177
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,732
Let's go, hurry up!

178
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,817
Lily! Lily!

179
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,076
Hi. I came to tell you
I hadn't forgotten about you.

180
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,996
I'm doing everything I can.

181
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,960
If I disappear will you come look for me?

182
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,590
- You're not going to disappear.
- If I do?

183
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,805
I have to go. They get mad at me
when I miss the bus.

184
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,518
Lily, wait. Wait.

185
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,441
Here. It's my home number.

186
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:52,113
If you get scared,
I want you to call me, okay?

187
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,076
I'm gonna get you out of there,
I promise.

188
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,037
Okay.

189
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,099
Hey, this is Doug, here it comes.

190
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:24,104
Hey, it's me,
thought you might be awake.

191
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,440
Just calling 'cause...

192
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,277
Well, I don't really know why I'm calling.

193
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,239
Call me if you get this, okay?

194
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,575
...proposal in Morton Township
has some residents...

195
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,828
Here we go golfers and shoppers...

196
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,289
Let's look at the crepe batter.
In order to make the crepe batter...

197
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,841
- Too late, I met someone else.
- Emily.

198
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,637
Lily? Are you okay?

199
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,224
- I'm scared.
- Why, honey? Why are you scared?

200
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,311
They're waiting to get me,
I can hear them.

201
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,064
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you sorry?

202
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,609
- I'm falling asleep.
- Okay, listen.

203
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,529
Go over and open the window.
Can you do that?

204
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,949
- I'm sorry.
- Lily? Lily?

205
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,292
- Yeah, Barron.
- Mike, it's Emily.

206
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,628
That girl that I told you about,
I think she's in a lot of trouble.

207
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,963
- Emily, you're going...
- No, I know what you said.

208
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,132
Mike, you're not listening! Help me!

209
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,648
- What are we doing here, Emily?
- Saving her life!

210
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,651
- They're asleep like we should be.
- They're not asleep.

211
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,571
- Did you hear that?
- I didn't hear anything.

212
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,948
Leave her alone!

213
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,200
No!

214
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,039
Let me out!

215
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,253
- Did you hear that?
- Police, open up!

216
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,423
Stop!

217
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,678
Break, break it down. Break it down!

218
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,573
Help me. Help me.

219
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,203
- Police!
- Lily!

220
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,378
Lily!

221
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,257
God! Oh, my God!

222
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,677
No! Help me!

223
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,889
Please, help me.

224
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,896
I got you, I got you, I got...

225
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,464
Okay. I got you.

226
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,842
What the hell's the matter
with you people?

227
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,260
I got you.

228
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:13,435
It's okay, honey. I got you.

229
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,354
It's okay. I got you.

230
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:21,526
The egregiousness of the crime makes

231
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,320
the competency question
all the more relevant.

232
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:28,116
I hereby order the defendants to
undergo psychiatric evaluation

233
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,785
to determine their fitness for trial.

234
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,538
Steal a pizza, San Quentin.

235
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,957
Try to kill your kid,
Freudian dream analysis.

236
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,585
You're gonna hate me for saying this
but my money's on crazy.

237
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,378
What kind of people
put their kid in an oven?

238
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,256
Bad people. Remember that
when people were just bad?

239
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,593
Before everything had a diagnosis
and a justification?

240
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,136
It's human nature.

241
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,102
What's the most important thing

242
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,980
that we talked about
that you have to remember?

243
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,318
It's not my fault what happened.

244
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,696
That's right. You know what? It's not.

245
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:13,119
Good. I'll see you soon.

246
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,623
- Hey.
- Hi.

247
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:20,627
That is some seriously proactive
social work happening there.

248
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,380
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

249
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,548
- How's she doing?
- Typical reaction.

250
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,886
But she blames herself. We'll get there.

251
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:34,933
I'm gonna put her in a group setting,
see if I can get her to open up.

252
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:38,978
Group therapy for kids,
when am I going to get used to that?

253
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,815
- See you later. Okay.
- See you.

254
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:43,775
Hi.

255
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:51,116
Good news. They say you can
get out of here tomorrow.

256
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,453
Doug said I might have to go
to a state home.

257
00:24:55,995 --> 00:25:00,917
Yeah, but it's only temporary,
till we find you a nice family.

258
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:05,005
Why can't I live with you?

259
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:08,174
Sweetheart, that would
never be allowed.

260
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,509
Why?

261
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,888
Well, it's complicated, I mean,
there's this whole process,

262
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,975
and I'm not even a foster parent. So...

263
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,439
It'll be fine.

264
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:35,535
- Hi, Barb.
- Hi, Em. Right this way, little lady.

265
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,875
I'll check in, in a couple of days, okay?

266
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:49,924
I don't want to stay here,
I want to live with you.

267
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,721
Please. I'll be good.

268
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,849
Lily, it's impossible, I told you.

269
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,854
Will you try?

270
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:08,610
Honey, listen, even if they said yes,
it would never work.

271
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:12,322
I work all day and
I'm hardly ever home and...

272
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,786
I'm sorry, I'm just not mom material.

273
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,581
How do you know if you've never tried?

274
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,517
So, it's just until we can find
the right family for her,

275
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:42,769
just until we can place her
in a really good home.

276
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:46,439
You know you'd have to give up
the case, conflict of interests and all.

277
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:47,899
Yeah.

278
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:52,529
Can I ask you a question?
Why are you doing this?

279
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:56,491
What Lily needs right now is
a safe, supportive environment

280
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,284
with someone she trusts.

281
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,496
The system can't provide that for her,
I think that I can.

282
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,332
Better than anyone, given my training.

283
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,210
We spend so much of our time
negotiating red tape,

284
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:11,297
I think if we look at this situation,
this one situation,

285
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:15,218
this one child,
it's clear what's best for her.

286
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,976
How long till Foster Services can
place her in a permanent home?

287
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,354
Three weeks, three months,
it's hard to predict.

288
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,618
No more visits.

289
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,039
- What?
- They said yes.

290
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,128
It's your new beginning.

291
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:57,594
Okay. It's what I like to think of as
a glass-half-full situation.

292
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,515
Bathroom. Kitchen. Fish.

293
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,852
And this is your room.

294
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,982
Be okay?

295
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,659
- You live alone?
- Just me.

296
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:24,245
Just us.

297
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,754
- What's this?
- It's chamomile.

298
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,339
Helps me sleep.

299
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,888
You know none of this
should ever have happened.

300
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:44,140
If I could make it go away, I would.

301
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:46,726
You did.

302
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:56,444
Here. Climb in.

303
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,034
Night night.

304
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,864
- Okay. All right.
- Here we go.

305
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:44,284
- Just got to grab some of her things.
- Okay.

306
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:47,287
- So, here's the key.
- You're not coming?

307
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,330
I got 15 other places I got to be.

308
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,834
So make sure you lock it on the way out.
Okay? Bye.

309
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,313
The kids at school are
saying all this stuff like saying

310
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:21,274
my mother is a puta

311
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:26,154
and I mean, I know
we can't go back home

312
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:29,532
but I miss it.

313
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:32,994
Sometimes when our parents
aren't getting along,

314
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,705
it's better if they spend some time apart.

315
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,458
That's what a restraining order does.

316
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,502
She's starting to come out of her shell.

317
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,754
It's good,
but you got to expect some hiccups.

318
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,090
And you can't undo
10 years of trauma in six weeks.

319
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:46,591
School? Too soon?

320
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,593
No, I don't have a problem
with her going back,

321
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:51,638
just as long as she's comfortable with it.

322
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:56,059
I went by the house.
I think her mom and dad were

323
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,228
barricading themselves
in their room at night.

324
00:32:58,353 --> 00:32:59,729
How sick is that?

325
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:01,815
Well, fear and hatred are
part of the same pathology.

326
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,566
- See you. Bye, Diego.
- You too, Lily.

327
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,193
- But I forgot.
- Bye.

328
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:07,362
- Bye.
- You don't think they're crazy.

329
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,489
Well, I'm coming around.

330
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,206
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

331
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:26,923
- Wayne's looking for you.
- Okay.

332
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:33,054
- Wayne wants to see you.
- Yeah, I got it.

333
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,105
What's up with Diego?

334
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,359
Oh, hey.
Look, why don't we go talk in my office.

335
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,611
No, tell me what's going on.

336
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:56,077
Well, we don't... We don't know why yet
but he killed both his parents last night.

337
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,253
- Excuse me... Go ahead.
- Officer, let her through.

338
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,716
What happened?

339
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:13,011
Gets a tyre iron from the garage,
comes back inside,

340
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:20,518
locks all the doors and windows,
and kills them in their sleep.

341
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,818
"Slaughters" would be a better word.

342
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:36,409
Oh, my God!

343
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:54,678
A 10-year-old did this? There's no way.

344
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:58,056
I was there when they brought him in.
Took three guys to subdue him.

345
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:00,183
And the kid was climbing the walls.

346
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,395
Man's best friend, huh?

347
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,582
What happened?
Tell me what happened.

348
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,626
I killed my mom and dad.

349
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,428
Every family you sit down with,

350
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:39,723
every day of every week,
it's a family in crisis.

351
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,935
Those are your odds. Well,
that's your job, trying to beat them.

352
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,525
You're one person, Em.

353
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:53,278
You can't save the world.

354
00:35:57,365 --> 00:35:59,409
I know somebody you did save.

355
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:03,913
Yeah.

356
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,419
- You okay?
- Yeah.

357
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:12,130
It's just work. Don't worry.

358
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:16,968
- I think you have a hard job.
- So do I.

359
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:22,098
People have kids and then they decide
they don't want to be parents.

360
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:25,769
And then the kids grow up
thinking it's their fault.

361
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,606
Is that what your parents did?

362
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,026
You said you were alone.

363
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:35,904
Yeah.

364
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,866
I never met my dad.

365
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:44,662
And my mom... My mom had problems.

366
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,124
- She must have scared you.
- Why do you say that?

367
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,544
You don't like to talk about it.

368
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:56,216
You're a clever little girl.

369
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:10,438
Sweetheart. Breakfast.

370
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,401
What you got?

371
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,703
Let me see.

372
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,628
You went through my things?

373
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,551
I'm sorry. I wanted to know about you.

374
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,644
Is that your mother?

375
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,065
What happened to her?

376
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,611
She died when I was about your age.

377
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:03,366
- How?
- An accident.

378
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:13,001
It was raining
and she was driving too fast.

379
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,172
We had an accident.

380
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:21,926
Are you mad at me?

381
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,972
No, I'm not mad at you.

382
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,850
But I need you
not to do that again, okay?

383
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:31,686
Go through my private things
without asking.

384
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:35,357
Okay? All right.

385
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:39,152
Omelette's getting cold. Better hurry.

386
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:57,420
You watch, six months,
their lawyer will hire an expert

387
00:38:57,545 --> 00:39:01,049
to say they're rehabbed and they'll sue
for custody when they get out.

388
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:02,676
She's not going back there.

389
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:05,470
I'll take her out of the state
before I let them near her again.

390
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:07,472
Didn't hear you say that.

391
00:39:09,182 --> 00:39:10,600
You guys okay?

392
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:16,815
We're great. She's sweet,
very intuitive about everything.

393
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:23,571
You wanted to talk about something?

394
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,074
We pulled the Ramirezes'
phone records.

395
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,410
There was a call that night
before the murder.

396
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:31,538
- From who?
- The call came from your house, Emily.

397
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:33,373
What?

398
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:36,543
I'm not accusing you of anything,
I just want to know what was said.

399
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,378
But that's impossible.

400
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,755
I mean, I might have called them
the week before or something, but I...

401
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,883
I'm talking to you as a friend,
you know that, right?

402
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:45,969
Mike, did you not hear me?

403
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:49,639
As a friend, I'm telling you
that I didn't call that family.

404
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:59,858
He's in my group.
Why, did something happen?

405
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,571
We're trying to figure out why.

406
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:07,532
Diego got a call from here,
last Thursday night.

407
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,617
I'm just wondering
if he might have said something.

408
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:12,245
- That wasn't me.
- You didn't call him?

409
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:17,459
Lily, it's difficult sometimes
to tell the truth,

410
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,753
but I know you will
because you're a good kid.

411
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,629
I am telling the truth.

412
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:25,800
My backup files are in the cabinet.
Diego's is in there.

413
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:30,930
Maybe you got curious and went
through some, dialled a number?

414
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:33,350
It wasn't me, I swear.

415
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,729
The call came at 2:00 a.m.
You ever up that late?

416
00:40:37,854 --> 00:40:40,523
- I didn't call him.
- You ever up that late?

417
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:43,568
Mike, she said no.
Maybe somebody made a mistake.

418
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,363
Yeah, maybe so.

419
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:56,790
Why would Diego do this?
He loved his mom and dad.

420
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:01,795
You never want to think anyone you
know is capable of that kind of thing.

421
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,423
In your mind, it's always some
nameless, faceless creature.

422
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,678
Sometimes, the city seems full of them.

423
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:13,181
But they're just people,
like you and me.

424
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:17,268
She's lying.

425
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,235
Do you believe me?

426
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:27,946
I believe you.

427
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:35,704
I need to ask you something
about the night it happened.

428
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,707
Did you get a call? Really late?

429
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,420
You didn't.

430
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:47,173
Diego, I know that you did.

431
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:51,261
The call came from my house.

432
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,225
What's the matter?

433
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:00,520
What's scaring you? Diego.

434
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:05,400
It's okay, it's all right. Deep breaths,
deep breaths, you'll be all right.

435
00:42:05,525 --> 00:42:07,986
Can we get some help in here, please?

436
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:24,544
Who called you? Was it Lily?

437
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:31,176
Did she say something to you?
Something that scared you?

438
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,847
- El dijo.
- "El dijo"?

439
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:39,225
What do you mean, "He said"?

440
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:44,230
- Era un hombre.
- It was a man?

00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:22,644
Do you

446
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:27,190
like working here?

447
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:30,735
Well, photocopying isn't much fun.

448
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:36,032
- What?
- Knock, knock. Sorry I'm late, guys.

449
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:38,076
You ready to go, kiddo?

450
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:41,413
- So, how's school?
- Fine.

451
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,624
Any of your classmates
giving you a hard time?

452
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:47,210
No, they've been nice.

453
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:50,380
You sleeping okay?

454
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:54,801
That's not really what
you want to talk about, is it, Doug?

455
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:56,136
You got me.

456
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:02,809
Question 16, am I afraid of the dark?
You answered no.

457
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:07,355
Question 23, am I afraid of being alone?
You answered no.

458
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:10,233
26, am I afraid of my parents? No.

459
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:13,278
You answered no
to everything in that section.

460
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,740
I think that some of those
should have been yeses.

461
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:18,366
Everybody is scared of something.

462
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:20,410
Working through our fears,
conquering them,

463
00:44:20,535 --> 00:44:22,203
is how we get better.

464
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:26,541
So, I want you to tell me,
what scares you?

465
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:34,049
I'll tell you what scares me
if you tell me what scares you.

466
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,345
Fair enough.

467
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:43,141
When I was a kid, I was climbing a tree,

468
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,935
and I accidentally put my hand
through a giant hornets' nest.

469
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:48,938
And they didn't like it.
I was stung over a hundred times.

470
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,524
They had to rush me to the hospital.

471
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,694
Been afraid of hornets ever since.

472
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:58,073
I don't climb many trees either.

473
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:01,534
Everybody has fears.
Now, what scares you?

474
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:05,413
- Me.
- You scare yourself?

475
00:45:05,872 --> 00:45:09,918
- Sometimes.
- Why? What about yourself scares you?

476
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:13,713
I have bad thoughts.

477
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:16,007
- About what?
- People.

478
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:21,054
- People in general or certain people?
- Certain people.

479
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:22,889
- Like who?
- You.

480
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:27,018
You have bad thoughts about me?

481
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:30,480
- Why?
- I just do.

482
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:35,819
Did I do something or say something
that upset you?

483
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,698
It's just the way you are.

484
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,200
How am I?

485
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,371
- Facile.
- Facile?

486
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:50,333
Do you even know what that means?

487
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:54,462
Easily comprehended.
Often lacking sincerity or depth.

488
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:56,631
You're smug, too.

489
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:00,802
Want me to tell you what that means?

490
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:05,181
- If I seemed smug or facile I want to...
- Don't apologise.

491
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:06,433
Why not?

492
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:11,146
You're a grown-up. It's embarrassing.

493
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:24,159
Number 12,
I worry about what's going to happen.

494
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:27,871
- Yes or no?
- You want me to answer that?

495
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:31,249
- Yes or no?
- No.

496
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:35,503
That should be a yes.

497
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:42,135
Should we talk about school now?

498
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:45,055
My grades are getting a lot better.

499
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:55,857
I talked to a lot of kids, I don't think
I've ever felt like that before.

500
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:57,233
Like what?

501
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:00,070
Threatened.

502
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,454
I know a specialist,
I'm gonna call him in the morning.

503
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:51,830
Are you mad at me?

504
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:54,582
No. No, I'm just tired.

505
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:58,545
- Want me to brush your hair?
- No, thanks.

506
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:02,549
- Are you sure?
- Some other time.

507
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:06,511
It will make you feel better.
I'll get the brush.

508
00:48:06,636 --> 00:48:08,304
I said no, thank you.

509
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:17,605
Doug said something, didn't he?

510
00:48:19,899 --> 00:48:24,404
Doug? No.
Doug says you're doing great.

511
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,991
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing.

512
00:48:59,856 --> 00:49:00,940
Hello.

513
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,160
Try again, sorry.
