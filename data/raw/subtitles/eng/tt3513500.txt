00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,500
TEACHER: Hello, hello. Good morning.
Come along now.

3
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:52,375
Simon, no headphones.
You'll get these back after school.

4
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,791
Betty, you're not Donald Duck!
Put some pants on, please!

5
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,101
- DALE: Okay. What's the first thing...
- Okay, kids. Have fun at school!

6
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,309
- ...that pops into your head...
- Bye, Dad!

7
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,059
- ...when I say Chip 'n Dale?
- Hey, stop bumping me!

8
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,291
I'm willing to bet
it's Thomas Chippendale,

9
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,500
the London-based
cabinet maker from the 1700s.

10
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,416
Sick cabinet, Thomas!

11
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:12,083
But I bet the second thing
that pops into your head are these guys.

12
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,958
But certainly, third would be
those rascally cartoon chipmunks,

13
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:19,250
Chip 'n Dale,
or should I say Chip and me?

14
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,125
And it all started the day we met,

15
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:24,625
when I had to join a new school
in the middle of third grade.

16
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:28,000
Hello, potential new friends!

17
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:33,375
We have a new student today.
Everyone, say hello to Dale.

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,041
Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you!

Uh...

21
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,916
(GASPS) I know.

22
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:49,083
- (SCREAMS) My eye! It's in my eye!

(RETCHES)

24
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:53,208
- No, no, no, no. (SCREAMS)
- DALE: Get it out!

25
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,500
Uh... (CHUCKLES)

26
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,583
- It's a joke. See? I'm fine.
- (KIDS SCREAMING)

27
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,083

31
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,458
DALE: By lunchtime,
no one wanted anything to do with me.

32
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,250
So, I had to sit alone.

33
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,416
- (SIGHS)
- Hey. Mind if I sit?

34
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:28,125
That pencil thing you did was hilarious!
It was excellent comic timing.

35
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:32,041
- Really? I kind of wish I hadn't done it.
- No way, man.

36
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,708
The biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all.

37
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,125
You just didn't set up the joke right.
I can help you if you want.

38
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,833
- The name's Chip.
- I'm Dale.

39
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,791
So, do you watch Crispy Cow?

40
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,718

- about everything.
- So good!

43
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,833
DALE: And I never thought about anything.
We were perfect together.

44
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,458
Friendship is rare
Do you know what...

45
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,625
- CHIP: Come on!
- DALE: And even though,

46
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,017
- we were in the same grade...
- Follow me!

47
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,458
...Chip was like the older brother
I never had.

48
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:03,000
He introduced me to cheesy crust pizza
and funny, old movies.

- (BOTH GRUNT)

DALE: By high school we were headlining
the talent show.

51
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,833
And for our grand finale,
The Amazing Dale will juggle everything!

52
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,291
Hey!

53
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:17,125
- Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ah!
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

54
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:22,125
DALE: We knew we had something special.
So, after graduation, we packed our bags

55
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,625
- and headed to California.
- You're late! Come on!

56
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,791
Move, move, move! Here, catch!

Hello, potential new friends!

Goodbye, eclectic group of bus passengers.

61
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,500
Oh, what if I did something like,
"I'm into nuts."

(CHUCKLES) Good, good.
I love it. Great stuff.

DALE: Those first few months,
we were flat broke,

64
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,458
but they were some
of the best times of my life.

66
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,666
...when you're off, everyone knows.
So be on, with Fresh-On Deodorant...

67
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,208

- We look great.

68
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,708
DALE: And after landing a few small parts,

69
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,958
we finally got the call
that would change everything.

70
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,333
MALE VOICE: (OVER TELEPHONE) Chip, Dale,
how would you like your own show?

74
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,351
- DALE: Our own TV show.
- Through the cracks

75
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,934
DALE: It was about a group
of little detectives...

76
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,809
-But these two, Gumshoes
-...who would solve big crimes.

77

and he couldn't speak,

81
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,392
- a double threat.
- When there's danger

82

Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!

DALE: And then there was Chip and I,

84
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,416
we were a classic odd couple
with Chip as the logical straight man...

85
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,684
- Pass me that pipe. I've got an idea.
- ...and me as the fun-loving goof.

86

- Right, what are you gonna do with it?
- You're mine now. (SNICKERS)

Nice work, everyone!
Great job!

92
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:25,458
And so, I just wanna thank all of you
for the greatest three years of my life.

93
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,000
When I think back
to where this all started,

94
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:32,791
me finding Dale sitting all alone
in the cafeteria, so sad.

95
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,416
- Well, I wasn't that sad.
- (ALL LAUGH)

96
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,625
That's funny.

97
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,875
But never in my wildest dreams
did I think we'd be here now.

98
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,375
So, to you, Dale, my best friend,
and to all of you.

To many more seasons
of the Rescue Rangers. Cheers!

Now, that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

118
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,291
Hey, where'd you run off to, buddy?
I saved you a piece of cake.

119
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,500
- What's that?
- Okay.

120
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:49,083
I wasn't gonna show you this right now,
but it just got delivered. So... Ta-da!

121
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,875
(CHUCKLES) "Double-0 Dale"?
That's hilarious. What is that?

122
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:57,041
It's wild, right? It's my new show.
I'm gonna be a super spy.

123
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,000
Wh... what are you talking about?

124
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,916
Yeah, I'm really going for it.
And just like you always say,

125
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,458
"The biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all." (LAUGHS)

126
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,375
- Wait, you really have a new show?
- DALE: Yep!

127
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,000
Wh... why didn't you
talk to me about it first?

128
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,325
We tell each other everything.

129
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,041
You've told me what you had
for lunch the last 42 days.

130
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,291
Pineapple pizza and a diet Slice.

131
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,208
- Exactly.
- DALE: I don't know.

132
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,833
I just wanted to make sure
the show was gonna happen first,

133
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,833
- before I got your hopes up.
- My hopes up? What?

134
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,791
Yeah! It's good news for everyone.
Check this out.

135
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,958
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

- (LAUGHS)
- I just...

137
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,708
If you do this,
they might cancel the show.

138
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,833
No, they won't do that. I mean,
everyone knows you're the favorite.

139
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,676
And I'm just the guy
who gets hit in the head

140
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,208
with a pipe each week. It's fine.

141
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,458
Okay, so, you're gonna risk
all of Rescue Rangers

142
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,541
because I'm a little
more popular than you?

143
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,291
Do you know how dumb that is?
(SCOFFS)

144
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,541
Well, I am the dumb one.

145
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:57,125
- (SIGHS) I didn't mean it like that.
- (SIGHS) I know. You never mean it.

146
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,583
Look, you're always acting
like you saved me or something.

147
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,500
But when we were kids,
we were in it together.

148
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,291
What are you talking about?
We're still in it together.

149
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,625
I'm sorry, Chip.
I'm just done being second banana.

150
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,666
But you're not second banana.

151
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,625
I'm a banana
and you're just another banana.

152

- Two bananas.

- But it could be my agent, Dave Bolinari.

154
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,666
After everything I've done for you,
do not pick up that phone.

- Dale, stop.

- I have to.

157
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,125
Do not. Do not do it.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,541
I'm so sorry. Go for Dale.

159
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,125
(LAUGHING) Hey! Dave Bolinari.

160
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,083
DALE: Rescue Rangers
was canceled that summer,

161
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,833
and Double-0 Dale

00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,125
- Quick! Get in!
- Okay. (LAUGHS)

322
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,083
Oh.

323
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,833
- Dale...
- Chip.

324
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,291
- Hey.
- Yep, it's me.

325
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,583
- Cool.
- Yeah, I called Dale for help also.

326
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,958
- I hope that's okay.
- Yeah, why wouldn't it be okay?

- "Artichokie"? For real?
- Yes. "Artichokie."

329
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,335
So, you're not still mad
about all the stuff with,

330
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,791
you know, Double-0 Dale
and Rescue Rangers getting canceled?

331
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,375
Mad? No. I'd be pretty pathetic
to care about something

332
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,708
from that long ago.

333
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,500
Oh. Okay. I mean, you can care a little
if you want to. I mean, I care, but...

334
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,083
- So, what's been up with you?
- Oh, you know this, that,

335
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,166
other vague things
to fill the space of this conversation.

336
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:22,166
- Okay, well, you look the same.
- Yeah. Thanks. And you look... different.

337
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,333
Ah! Hey, it's no secret
I had the CGI surgery done

338
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,583
and it's done wonders
rejuvenating my career.

339
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,791
I'm actually starring in a play tonight...

340
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:36,083
But, man, I tell you
the real hot ticket is Rescue Rangers.

341
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,291
There's even some buzz about a reboot.
Someone started a Facebook fan page

342
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,750
- for it and everything.
- Crikey! A Facebook fan page?

343
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,000
- They don't just give those away.
- Oh, he's full of it, Monty.

344
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,375
No one's talking about
a Rescue Rangers reboot except for him.

345
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,500
What? The fans are hungry for it.

346
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,708
Look, I came here to help Monty,
not get caught up

347
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,083
in some Hollywood nonsense.

348
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,750
So, great to take this skip
down memory lane,

349
00:18:58,833 --> 00:18:59,833
but I've gotta go.

350
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,416
Monty, if you're really in trouble,
you know how to find me.

351
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,250

out of essentially nothing.

in the first place.

I've been fine without it.

357
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,333
It's garbage. Total garbage.

358
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,875
That's why it's better
to not even have friends.

359

after the show tonight?

Yeah, actually, Monty told me
he was in debt to the Valley Gang?

392
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,333
He was afraid of being bootlegged
since he was somewhat of a star

- This is my fault. I shouldn't have left.

Well, it eats me up inside
to have to tell you this,

400

but if he's been taken by the Valley Gang,
I doubt we can help you.

that cops were supposed

not give up and move on.

- Really?

427
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,000
I actually became a detective
because as a little girl

428
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,916
growing up in Albany,
I wanted to help people.

429
00:22:57,166 --> 00:23:02,375
- Just like you guys.
- No way. We are so honored. Namaste.

430

You know that was just
a TV show, right? Not real.

00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,583
Chip, inspiration is inspiration.

432
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,333
Look, I heard
what Putty was saying to you guys.

433
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,416
But I don't think it's hopeless.
I'm breaking some rules telling you this,

434
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,666
but from everything
that we know about bootlegging,

435
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,916
the whole process takes about two days.

436
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,500
- That's 48 hours.
- Yeah.

437
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:21,583
ELLIE: The problem is,

438
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,666
we don't know where
Sweet Pete's bootlegging facility is.

439
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,333
And every time we try to get a warrant,
we get so bogged down in red tape

440
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,708
that nothing happens.

441
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,958

that bootlegging facility,

there's only one crime-fighting team

going to help,

00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:22,083
Star of stage and screen,
but you can call me Sweet Pete.

645
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,166
- Oh, you look...
- Old? Bald? Sad like a zoo gorilla?

646
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:30,583
- What? No. Not like a zoo gorilla.
- Don't worry.

647
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:33,625
You can't say nothing to me
I haven't heard already. Jimmy, please.

648
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:34,958
Untie our guests.

649
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,750
(GRUNTS)

650
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,666
Chip and Dale! Wow!
You mind if I walk while we talk?

651
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,458
Not fitting into the old costume
like I used to. Need to get my steps in.

652
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,375
Hey! I've got one of those.

653
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,666
We should link accounts
and help motivate each other.

654
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:53,375
Right. So, I'm guessing you two are here
to talk about Monterey Jack.

655
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,583
- Oh. Yeah, actually we are.
- You know, I always liked Monty.

656
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:01,625
It's a shame what happened.
Too much cheese. Not enough bread.

657
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:04,000
Listen, Mr. Sweet Pete... Mr. Pete.

658
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,625
We'd be willing to pay
whatever Monty owes you

659
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:09,208
if you could give him a break?
Just this once?

660
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:13,041
Hmm. "Give him a break"?
You know, I got my big break

661
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:17,333
when I was just a kid. I got cast
in the biggest movie in the world,

662
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,500
as the boy who wouldn't grow up,
Peter Pan.

663
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:23,541
I'd never been so happy in my entire life.

664
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:28,000
Then I got older,
and they threw me away like I was nothing.

665
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,125
This business can be so tough

666
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,750
(SCOFFS) You said it.

667
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:35,500
I was scared, desperate, and all alone.

668
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:41,875
So, I decided to take the power back
and make my own bootleg movie!

669
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,916
I called it "Flying Bedroom Boy."

670
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,083
And guess what? It worked!
I made lots of money.

671
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:52,125
So, I recruited other toons,
to star in more movies

672
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:56,208
and bang-a-rang, now I run
my own bootleg movie studio,

673
00:35:56,333 --> 00:36:00,916
where I get to decide who's a star,
and who gets thrown in the trash!

674
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:04,583
And now, you two come
poking around where you don't belong,

675
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,041
asking questions
about your missing friend.

676
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,583
And I can't have that.
So, how's this for a break?

677
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:14,208
I'm thinking it's time
for a Chip 'n Dale reboot.

678
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:16,833
- Jimmy...
- You, come with me.

679
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,166
- Yup, we're dead.
- Run!

680
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,500
(JIMMY GROWLS)

681
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,500
Go, go, go, go, go! (GRUNTS)

682
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:25,625
- SWEET PETE: Just grab them already!
- JIMMY: I'm trying! (GROWLS)

683
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,750

Ah! (GRUNTS)

686
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,426
SWEET PETE: Hey!
That's my personal bathroom.

687
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,708
Look for a way out of here!

688
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,250
- JIMMY: Hey!
- Uh... No.

689
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,541
- JIMMY: Come out here!
- No.

690
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:43,458
- Aha! There's only one way, Chip.
- No! That's disgusting.

691
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:44,833
BOB: Jimmy, I got them! (GRUNTS)

692
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,958
It's our only chance. Live a little!

693
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,958
Live a little?
You seem excited about this!

694
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,375
- Don't... No... Aw...
- Come on, Chip, the water's fine!

695
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,416
- Aw. Dang it!
- BOB: Come on! No!

696
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,541
O... okay.

697
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:00,017
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

698
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,666
- Happy birth...
- (SCREAMS)

699
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:05,166
(GRUNTS) No, no! I'm done.

700
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:07,833
You better pray
they don't make it out of there alive.

- What?

708
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:33,541
- It could be my agent, Dave Bolinari!
- Oh, cool! Let me know what he says!

709
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,875
Hello! What? Oh, yeah, spaghetti's fine!

710
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:40,750
Love you too, Mom!
(LAUGHS) My agent is so weird.

Oh, no. Dale?

don't prank me like this.

- What's up?

Not now, Dale.

(SOBS) Dale! You're alive! But how?

732
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:00,250
The name's Munk. Dale Munk.

733
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:03,750
- (CHUCKLES)
- Ugh. Double-0 Dale, of course.

734
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:07,750
Chip, you were crying.
You really do love me!

735
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:10,375
- What? No! I... You were crying!
- Aw!

736
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,333
- Can we...
- Chippy, Chippy, I love you too!

737
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,791
Don't make it about you.
I was traumatized!

738
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:16,059
- Aw.
- Just leave it alone, okay?

739
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:20,458
Okay, fine. Well, that whole day
was a big waste!

740
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,583
We didn't learn anything
of value except for that

741
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:24,916
Sweet Pete wears
the same step tracker that I do.

742
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:28,791
Wait, those step trackers,
do they keep track of everywhere you go?

743
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,875
Yeah, I know because I like
to map my runs in the shape of a butt.

744
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,642
- (CHUCKLES)
- I can't believe I'm saying this,

745
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,291
but we need to go talk to Ellie.

746
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,833
And then, I'm going home!

747
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,666
DALE: Okay, but please just don't tell her
about the butt thing.

748
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,041
- CHIP: I can't promise that.
- (DALE GROANS)

749
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,885
Do you think she'll think
it's funny, though?

750
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:49,875
Thanks!

751
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:54,000
So, if we could get a hold
of Sweet Pete's step tracker,

752
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:57,250
we could cross reference where he's been,
with where we know he goes!

753
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,958
Right! And whatever doesn't overlap
has got to be his secret facility!

754
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:04,708
Exactly! We get the step tracker,
and we can trace it to find Monty.

755
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:08,083
- Chip, you're a genius!
- So, what's the plan?

756
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,226
How are you guys gonna get
Sweet Pete's step tracker?

757
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,875
"You guys"? Hold on.
We got you the info you needed.

758
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:17,125
Now, it's up to you, the professional,
to actually, you know, get the bad guy,

759
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,875
- and save our friend Monty?
- It's not as simple as that.

760
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:23,875
We need warrants, we need probable cause,
and I don't know if you guys noticed,

761
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,791
but the captain doesn't really
value my opinion too much.

762
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:31,625
- What? He's crazy!
- No, I really screwed up.

763
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:35,000
Last year, when Peppa Pig went missing,

764
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:38,541
I fell for a bogus tip,
and made the whole squad

765
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,541
raid Nickelodeon Junior Studios.

766
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,583
And the toons fought back.

767
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,625
Paw Patrol attacked Sergeant Henderson.

768
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,916
The doctors say he'll never have kids.

769
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:55,833
Huh, thank you for sharing
that absolutely bonkers story.

770
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:59,125
(GASPS) I think I have exactly
what we need! Don't move.

771
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:04,250
Ladies and gentlemen.
Behold! The crime lab!

772
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:07,416
(GARAGE DOOR OPENS)

773
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:27,833
What? (LAUGHS) This is crazy.

774
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:31,916
Pretty sweet, right? All the disguises
and gadgets we could ever need.

775
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:37,291
Wait, is this like every episode
of Rescue Rangers ever?

776
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:40,166
- Yes, it is.
- (SIGHS) You've got them all.

777
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,625
"Catteries Not Included."

778
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,416
"Throw Mummy from the Train,"
"Dirty Rotten Diapers."

779
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Okay, so what's your favorite episode?

780
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,041
Ooh, I... I can't pick one.
That's too hard!

781
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,166
(CHUCKLES) Same. So good. (LAUGHS)

782
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,500
I'm honestly surprised
you kept all this stuff.

783
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,208
I didn't think you cared
about the show back then.

784
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,916
What? Of course I did.

785
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,250
No. Yeah, of course.

786
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,541
What's this huge map
with all the pins in it?

787
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,625
Oh, that? It's actually very cool.

788
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,416
Oh, no. Is this where
all the victims are buried?

789
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:14,708
(CHUCKLES) You're messing with me again!

790
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:18,666
It actually shows Rescue Rangers' ratings
in every US market in 1991

791
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,541
which, as you may recall,
was our most successful year.

792
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,958
Hey, Ellie, didn't you say
you were from Albany?

793
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,166
Born and raised.

794
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:28,750
Well, according to this map
Rescue Rangers never aired in Albany.

795
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:32,875
Yeah! My grandma, she used to tape
all the episodes and send them to me.

796
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,583
- Hmm.
- Grandmas rule! (CHUCKLES)

797
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:37,548
Oh, come on, Chip!
Look at all this cool stuff!

798
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:41,250
Like this is the limited edition
Rescue Rangers pog set!

799
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,059
You know, this turned
into a real collectible,

800
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:44,851
because someone noticed
that one of the clouds

801
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:47,875
behind Monterey Jack
looked exactly like... Oprah.

802
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:49,875
Wow. So cool.

803
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:53,791
I know, right?
Unfortunately, I only have 11 of the 12.

804
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:56,041
I'm missing the main one
of all of us together.

805
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,083

sneak you guys in there

by all those goons?

809
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:09,958
- Wait. What if we did episode 45?
- Forty-five?

810
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:13,541
- That's a good idea.
- No idea what you're referring to.

811
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,375
And do you have any original ideas?

812
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,791
Or are you just
constantly recycling old scripts?

You dressed up like a rat to fool me.

You said, "Rats what I'm talking about."

we could really use your help.

we have much of a choice!

You should have protected him.
