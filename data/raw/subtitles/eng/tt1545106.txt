<i> Hello. I called Goody, and in 1841 </ i>
<i> I was bitten by a master vampire. </ i>

00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:44,804
<i> They can awaken the sacrifices they choose </ i>

3
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:48,516
<i> Normally it would be </ i>
<i> a bloody history, - </ i>

4
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:52,770
<i> - but I have a bright mind, </ i>
<i> so I learned to live on animal blood. </ i>

5
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:56,858
<i> immortality gave me </ i>

00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:01,738
<i> night was once dull and dark, </ i>
<i> but it was better in the 80s. </ i>

7
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:07,118
<i> So 1880s. Industrial </ i>
<i> revolution gave us electricity. </ i>

8
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:12,248
<i> Suddenly the night was just as light </ i>
<i> days. Phones replaced letters. </ I>

9
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:17,211
<i> I took the subway around town </ i>
<i> and could get back in the coffin. </ i>

10
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:22,133
<i> In the 1920s, everything really </ i>
<i> modern. The dresses were shorter. </ I>

12
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,476

<i> And then came my favorite invention. </ i>

13
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:34,646
<i> Film. Chaplin, Keaton, Cagney. </ I>

14
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:39,067
<i> people on the film were aged not. </ i>
<i> I could relate to me. </ i>

15
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:45,365
<i> In 1960 clocked me in it. </ i>
<i> I was so stupid to fall in love. </ i>

16
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:51,454
<i> From there it went downhill. </ i>
<i> In the 70s I'd not men. </ i>

17
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:56,709
<i> But in the 90s made my ancestress </ i>
<i> Stacy. I took care of her. </ I>

18
00:01:56,876 --> 00:02:00,296
<i> I taught her </ i>
<i> to acquire land for the coffin, - </ i>

19
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:05,093
<i> - to hypnotize </ i>
<i> and find the artery on a rodent. </ i>

20
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,307
<i> She taught me about mails, Napster </ i>
<i> and this cool band Green Day. </ i>

21
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:13,977
<i> We partied with the usual - </ i>

22
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:17,772
<i> - and went to college. </ i>
I'd been over 300 man-years. </ i>

23
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,150
<i> But graduation is the day. </ i>

24
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:25,989
<i> I love to have a friend, or a </ i>
<i> best friend, as she puts it. </ i>

25
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:28,700
<i> Just look how cute she is. </ i>

26
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:34,247
Goody. Goody, wake up.
It is sunset.

27
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:39,961
<i> The only annoying by Stacy </ i>
<i> is her bad practical jokes. </ i>

28
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:44,841
What? It made you just do not.
Let me out.

29
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:51,931
- You got me.
- Again!

30
00:02:56,394 --> 00:03:00,064
Hurry.
I have a lecture at. eight.

31
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:04,819
Stacy, your friend from Boston
sent you home soil.

32
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:09,532
Thank God. I was nearly run out.
I have had so much pain in the back.

33
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:16,372
"Sorry, but your package
has been damaged. "

34
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:21,002
The postal service scans all packages
and it has probably seen suspicious.

35
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:24,839
- But it's just land.
- You know the terror law.

36
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:28,301
The terrorists have destroyed it all.

37
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:33,890
"Visit us at www ..."
Why do they call it "visit"?

38
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:37,727
Is it not rather
to write a letter on your computer?

39
00:03:37,894 --> 00:03:40,772
Visit is when you go somewhere.

40
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:45,318
- Takes up on a website.
- It makes no sense.

41
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:49,781
If you turn the pages of a book,
visit you then the new page?

42
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:54,369
Think that you still can not find
your mouth without a mirror.

43
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:04,462
- The sun rises at. 6.40.
- Use your app in your mobile.

44
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:09,342
- I like my almanac.
- What happens to the wife pants?

45
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:14,055
- It is quite common pants.
- No. They reveal your age.

46
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:19,769
We swap shoes. It makes you
into the right millennium.

47
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:22,063
Who comes first?

48
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:32,699
- It took a while.
- This is a result of the shoes.

49
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:37,829
When does your teaching?
See you at work afterwards, right?

50
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:41,165
<i> Where are you going? </ i>

51
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:44,961
Come here.

52
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:50,174
Goody. "Cradle of Filth,
Ozzy Osbourne and The Cure. "

53
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:54,721
Where? Oh no, it's a day.

54
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:59,058
Who was the spade,
who invented rock concerts a day?

55
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:11,029
- Let's check the traps.
- Rats eat anything.

56
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:19,579
- A dead rat.
- Was the trap?

57
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:23,416
I think it was cancer
of the artificial sweetener.

58
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,419
- <i> 53rd Street. </ I>
- 53rd Street.

59
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:28,963
<i> 6th Avenue. </ i>

60
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:33,885
53rd Street and 6th Avenue.
Penthouse suite.

61
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:36,846
- We will be summoned.
- Quiz time.

62
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:40,850
- Who is the stupidest thing on TV?
- The one from "Paradise Hotel".

63
00:05:41,017 --> 00:05:45,188
53rd Street.
Who is the most intelligent?

64
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:48,274
- House or Frylock.
- Who?

65
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:52,528
The limping doctor
or the flying box of fries.

66
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:55,114
Okay then. 53rd Street.

67
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,579
Do not you love Times Square?
It feels like the world's center.

68
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:07,377
- No, a thousand television vomiting.
- <i> Take however a taxi! Going In? </ I>

69
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,631
- How sour is she?
- I've seen worse.

70
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:16,469
- We do not want to see her suck blood.
- Where are my offspring?

71
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:20,807
There are of course.
See the new autumn collections.

72
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:25,353
Gaultier, Prada, Dries.

73
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:29,691
And I can not see,
how I look at it.

74
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:34,445
What is the meaning of that look like this,
if I can not enjoy it?

75
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:38,032
It is bummer.

76
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,286
Take your clothes on,
and so, I imagine, -

77
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:44,372
- How much better it looks on me.

78
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:49,711
- Call the pizza man.
- Should not we out to eat?

79
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,505
I feel like pizza man.

80
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:56,009
The dress comes with you.
Before you forward.

81
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:59,262
- I do not know about this.
- Why not?

82
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:03,600
- It is not appropriate for young people.
- What?

83
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:07,020
Should you tell me about
to be young?

84
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:11,065
Do you know
how long I have been young?

85
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:15,945
The crisis means that young people
can not afford the kind of clothes.

86
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:20,033
- And it's fur. Dead animals.
- Here is the hole in your argument.

87
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,370
Why would a mink life
be worth more than a dove?

88
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:28,249
- In two drink pigeons every day.
- We let them go free.

89
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,919
Stacy was happy for them.

90
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:35,798
- It was a mistake to give them names.
- You can not kill a Snoopy.

91
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:39,385
- Or Zeros bass.
- I is a pity.

92
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,931
Then there is the pizza man.

93
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:47,060
Pizza Man.

94
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:51,940
Who ordered extra cheese and sausage?

95
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:58,196
They said "under 20 minutes".
You've kept me waiting, bad boy.

96
00:07:58,363 --> 00:08:02,450
- I'm sorry.
- Bad boys should be punished.

97
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:10,583
I hate when she is in New York.
It's too obnoxious.

98
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,254
Yes, but let's enjoy ourselves a little.
We have earned.

99
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,633
And it's goth night. Day shift
are cute in their costumes.

100
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,316
- We are the oldest here.
- Except leather fool here.

101
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:39,571
- Can I buy you a drink?
- We never drink ... mojitoer.

102
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:42,991
Find someone your own age.

103
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:48,663
- Hello, Renfield.
- Adam Ant wants his look back.

104
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,585
- Wake me. I would like to live forever.
- So eat more broccoli.

105
00:08:53,751 --> 00:09:00,300
- No, I will be udød.
- You are udød. You are alive.

106
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,600
- Oh no. Snobbe McSelvglad is here.
- So what?

107
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:13,479
Ignore him. Show him
how much fun you have it.

108
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:16,232
Not taking pictures.

109
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,611
- So take one of me.
- Let's just dance.

110
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:26,492
Is this place not
a little silly?

111
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:34,042
- There are Donor Club in China Town.
- I do not know what you're talking about.

112
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:40,548
- I can sense another vampire.
- Vampire? Do not be kålhøgen.

113
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:45,053
People who say "kålhøgen"
is at least 80 years old.

114
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:50,266
Okay. I just want
preferably not be called V-word.

115
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:54,604
- Do you prefer ALF?
- Aging Free Life story, yes.

116
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:57,690
- How svanset.
- Hello.

117
00:09:57,857 --> 00:10:00,568
- Hello, Ivan.
- So you've met Vadim.

118
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:04,656
- He is my father.
- Well, the Soviet ancestor?

119
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:07,200
Ukrainian.

120
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:12,413
- Let's go to the blood bank.
- We do not drink human blood.

121
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,502
Fair enough. As long as Cisserus
take good care of themselves.

122
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:21,631
If there is her something
so will your years running up.

123
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:26,052
You do not
look like your age?

124
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:28,346
Sorry.

125
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:32,684
Juicy!

126
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:41,109
- My name is Vadim, and it is Ivan.
- I'll get my coat.

127
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:46,781
- Juicy.
- She asks himself about it.

128
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:54,038
Listen.
Vadim and Ivan are bad guys.

129
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:57,834
I like the bad guys.

130
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:02,171
No, you like cute guys.

131
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:05,383
You must not
talk to them.

132
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,429
- Not talk to them.
- And remember: cute guys.

133
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:11,431
Sweet guys.

134
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,025
Guys who are listening to.
Guys who gives compliments.

135
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:24,777
Where are you going, juicy?

136
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:06,569
- We go.
- J.E.S.T.

137
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:11,282
It says you only if you
even beyond. I Am Back Immediately.

138
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:14,244
- Well. S.S.
- What?

139
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,080
- Ses Later.
- A little better.

140
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:28,049
I wanted to play in New York. It was
okay with the old, I just read.

141
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:31,928
- Would you like some?
- No, I'm already in shock.

142
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:38,184
So they said, "What about the law?"
"I had to go to play music."

143
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:42,814
"Why did we have money at uni?"
"I could have bought ProTools to me."

144
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:47,360
"Law is your dream." They think
it's about record contracts.

145
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:49,696
They are so old-fashioned.

146
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:54,576
- My parents believed in witches.
- I need to play something for you.

147
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:11,467
- You have something ...
- Do you have a stroke?

148
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:22,729
A little bit will not hurt.

149
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,044
I need to run.

150
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:55,470
- People can see you.
- Nobody cares.

151
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:58,973
The pavement is wet,
and I have suede shoes on.

152
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,352
- I've done something bad.
- What?

153
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:06,564
Ham drummer was on coke,
and then he got nosebleeds.

154
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:10,610
- I was just a drop.
- Do you have withdrawal symptoms? Or famine?

155
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:16,157
No! I just took what was.
I knew it would be better -

156
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:19,702
- Than once to go out
and finding a fuck.

157
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:24,165
Once the guys would sing,
be painters or writers.

158
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:29,128
Now it is about iPod hits
and webisodes. I do not get it.

159
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:33,216
We must be in group therapy tomorrow.
It always helps.

160
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:37,178
Was not here
a frozen yogurt place again?

161
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:40,223
In the 70s it was a methadone clinic.

162
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,227
<i> hippies sat on the stairs </ i>
<i> waiting for their medicine. </ i>

163
00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:50,775
In the 50s it was a dance school. All
would be beatniks in the Village.

164
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:53,903
And before that it was a German newspaper.

165
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,033
- How do you know all this?
- History Channel.

166
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:03,162
Birds singing!

167
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:19,137
It is Van Helsing.
Let him pass.

168
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:24,559
This has nothing to do with
Ministry of Security to do.

169
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:28,897
- Have you found your neck?
- It's just a dead, unknown man.

170
00:15:29,063 --> 00:15:32,984
Killed and exsanguinated another location,
dismembered and thrown here.

171
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:37,113
- Empty? The body's bone dry.
- Detective?

172
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:43,369
Was he Pizza Delivery?

173
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:47,332
Are you satisfied?

174
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:50,877
If we find a bomb,
we will call you.

175
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,012
Good evening. My name is Erik.
Welcome to Anonymous Sangvinikere.

176
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:06,184
Tepes, you are the father, right?

177
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:10,563
There was one that said that if
a parent parent dies, die offspring.

178
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,651
But you're probably okay,
as long as you avoid the sun?

179
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:17,987
If one parent master die,
age you just.

180
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:21,074
Not the same as the day shift.

181
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:24,244
It is assumed his chronological age.

182
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:27,705
- When did you wake up?
- In the 1841st

183
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:32,919
Vårhare!
In addition, the new 80th 200

184
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:38,007
- Stacy was created in 1992.
- Does she know how old you are?

185
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:42,303
No. She found solace in,
we had the same age.

186
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,600
- The stems of Cisserus, right?
- Do you know her?

187
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,062
We had a brief affair.

188
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:54,023
It shaved 100 years of my life.

189
00:16:57,652 --> 00:17:00,238
Tepes, you put out?

190
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:06,911
Thank you, Eric.

191
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,582
Hello, everyone.
My name is Vlad Tepes.

192
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:13,459
- Spidderen Vlad.
- Hey, Vlad Tepes!

193
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:21,134
I abstained from
Homo sapiens' liquids in 362 years.

194
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:29,475
You've probably heard
what I did to the Turkish army.

195
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:33,938
The young must learn to replace it,
I can not, -

196
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:36,858
- With things
not harm others.

197
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:40,194
I like to knit.

198
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:42,989
Especially ...

199
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:45,199
... It here.

200
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:48,036
Thank you. Thank you.

201
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:55,710
- Hello, my name is Stacy.
- Hey, Stacy.

202
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:58,796
I have been in the 20s for two decades.

203
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:02,634
When I was on the day shift,
I took a lot E.

204
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,679
Ecstasy.

205
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:11,392
One night, I must have been high,
for I can not remember what -

206
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,395
- But I know
Cisserus drank from me -

207
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:18,524
- And Goody said she wanted me
as clothing mannequin.

208
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:23,446
If it were not for Goody,
I would have died. Completely dead.

209
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:28,284
But she says,
I saved her from loneliness -

210
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:31,663
- And gave her desire to
continues to exist.

211
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:36,251
I've never tasted human blood,
but still I am tempted.

212
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:40,547
But it's like with drugs.
We do not need to rush.

213
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:45,468
It is better not to do any evil
and have fun with his friends.

214
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:50,348
Thank you.

215
00:18:50,682 --> 00:18:52,517
Shall we?

216
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:58,106
When you drink human blood,
is one drop too much -

217
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:01,484
- And a whole family never enough.

218
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:06,739
Support your fellow ALF'er.
Udød is not equal to insensitive.

219
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:29,053
What are you doing?

220
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,642
Do not you hate when the tooth is klammo,
and hugtandsdelen is nice white?

221
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,688
- It's Renfield.
- Hello, Renfield.

222
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:42,775
- Let's take at Soho House.
- I'm so tired of clubs.

223
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:46,863
Go there, and if it is
amazing, please write to us.

224
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,407
- J.E.U.
- JE U?

225
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:51,451
I'm out.

226
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:56,039
Why can young people do not say
whole words? This nonsense does not save time.

227
00:19:56,205 --> 00:20:00,501
We agreed to move with the times,
although it does not turn 80.

228
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:05,632
I do not complain about the new hits
and says, Devo is much better.

229
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:08,635
- You have a blob there.
- Here?

230
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:11,721
The other side. A little higher.

231
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:16,976
Are not you tired of
not being able to see yourself?

232
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:19,729
You must have pictures from back then.

233
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:23,566
- No.
- Have you no youth images?

234
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:28,404
Him in the park signed on here.
Looks like it me?

235
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:33,159
Yes, he has really
captured the essence of you. Wait a minute.

236
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:45,421
She has your face shape.
You have rounder eyes. Shorter chin.

237
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:49,634
We make the hair on.
Green eyes.

238
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:54,889
Right nose ... and print.

239
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:01,896
You mild.

240
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,942
- It's me.
- Yes.

241
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:08,528
It's so long ago.

242
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:12,699
I regret everything ugly,
I have said on computers.

243
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:15,285
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

244
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,669
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

245
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:40,768
Laser surgery has evolved greatly.

246
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:45,982
- Hello. My name is Joey.
- Hello. Stacy.

247
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:23,061
- Will you have lunch with me?
- No.

248
00:22:24,437 --> 00:22:29,817
No, I work during the day, but we
can meet for coffee or drinks.

249
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:32,612
Fat.

250
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:40,411
- Any questions?
- Yes.

251
00:22:40,578 --> 00:22:44,582
How many surrealists
does it take to change a light bulb?

252
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:49,712
- A bike.
- Thank you for the wise words, Van Helsing.

253
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:57,262
It was not "Talladega Nights".
What would Dali with this film?

254
00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:03,935
Stacy, you should not take a nap now.
So you can not sleep all day.

255
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:07,605
I'm so tired.
I chatted throughout the day.

256
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:13,278
I've hardly slept.
I met a guy at uni.

257
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:17,907
- What is he?
- He's silly, but delicious.

258
00:23:18,074 --> 00:23:22,245
- What's his name?
- His name is Joey.

259
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:24,831
- Van Helsing.
- What?

260
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:30,420
- It's probably a coincidence.
- Could not you score Timmy Hitler?

261
00:23:31,296 --> 00:23:34,799
- Fun.
- I do not like it here.

262
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:37,385
I can take care of myself.

263
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:44,851
- You know what Joey will this weekend?
- Cover your head off?

264
00:23:47,353 --> 00:23:51,733
I want to see my wife's journal.
I have asked for it four times.

265
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,903
Show me her journal!

266
00:23:58,406 --> 00:24:02,368
Otherwise, the plaintiff thee
for dereliction of duty!

267
00:24:02,535 --> 00:24:06,956
Oh no! We go eh our way!
Oh no! We go eh our way!

268
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,710
Now that's enough!

269
00:24:27,894 --> 00:24:31,314
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.
I love you.

270
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:35,276
I said they should not ...
Do not eat that.

271
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:39,280
See! They use it here
to breast implants.

272
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:43,409
Guess where I went.
A cappuccino. See here.

273
00:24:43,576 --> 00:24:46,412
How high we love cannoli?

274
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,085
Maybe later.

275
00:24:53,503 --> 00:24:56,005
How are you doing in there?

276
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:01,052
- I'm tired.
- Shit!

277
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:08,851
You've been selected for a jury.
At eight o'clock in the morning!

278
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:13,731
How can this happen? We get
pay cash. We do not pay taxes.

279
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:18,736
- We got credit cards through another.
- I voted once.

280
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:21,656
- I voted for Dukakis.
- Dukakis?!

281
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:25,910
That was before I became a vampire.
I wanted my country the best.

282
00:25:26,077 --> 00:25:31,374
It's strictly business. From Dutch-
West India Company to the slave trade.

283
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:36,087
- How do you know all this?
- From the History Channel.

284
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:43,720
You're both in town,
why are you talking not just with him?

285
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:47,390
No one speaks more.
Does he think I'm 40 years?

286
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:53,688
If the city has too much waste,
and rats eat waste -

287
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:57,191
- Why not
let the rats do the job?

288
00:25:57,358 --> 00:26:00,778
- They multiply too quickly.
- What about birth control?

289
00:26:00,945 --> 00:26:05,116
- Must rats to use a condom?
- Yes. Tiny condoms.

290
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:09,037
Who's the old hippie,
who speaks with Fred?

291
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:12,498
I was dating him,
before we met.

292
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:15,376
He expects you are 40th

293
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:23,051
- How is it possible?
- How is what possible?

294
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:28,973
- Goody, you look not a day older.
- My name is Susan.

295
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,060
But my mother was called Goody.
Did you know her?

296
00:26:32,227 --> 00:26:37,607
- Goody Rutherford? Is this your mother?
- Yes. But she has passed away.

297
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:42,946
Sorry. My name is Danny Horowitz.

298
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:47,116
Has she ever mentioned me?

299
00:26:48,326 --> 00:26:51,663
I think
but we must get to work.

300
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:57,460
I need to talk to you.
Will you call me tomorrow?

301
00:26:57,627 --> 00:27:03,299
- Okay. Tomorrow night.
- Yes, your mother was also natmenneske.

302
00:27:12,225 --> 00:27:15,395
- Is this your apartment?
- My parents.

303
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:20,733
My ex and I broke up. I
not found an apartment yet.

304
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,821
- What does your father?
- He is in the Ministry of Security.

305
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:28,157
But he has worked long
for Ml6 in London.

306
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:32,662
- Is he a spy?
- Yes. Just like James Bond.

307
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:35,456
Just below.

308
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:40,503
Stacy, there is something I must tell
you. I'm older than you think.

309
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:46,759
I helped my father a few years. And
when I read, do you think enough, I'm 20th

310
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:50,889
But I'm almost 25,
and since you're 17 ..

311
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:57,270
I am also a little older than the others.

312
00:27:58,146 --> 00:27:59,981
Are you?

313
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:04,068
- Cool. How old are you?
- It asks not a lady on.

314
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:08,907
- Why not?
- It's rude.

315
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:14,829
- It was awful.
- The clown was when ...

316
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:19,584
Joey. I did not know
you had to visit.

317
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:23,171
It is Stacy.
Stacy, it's my parents.

318
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:27,050
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Good evening.

319
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:31,679
- I go to work.
- Do you work at night?

320
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:36,184
It's depressing, but it is
Only until I have finished reading.

321
00:28:36,351 --> 00:28:39,479
- I gotta go.
- I follow you out.

322
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:46,236
- Marked you her hands?
- Icy.

323
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,370
Whatever happens, there is always
someone who protest against it -

324
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:58,915
- And it is always
Union Square.

325
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:03,044
In the 1840s protested people
against slavery.

326
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:08,841
Traffickers!
Slavery will share our nation in two.

327
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:14,013
Abolition of slavery now!
Would you like a pamphlet?

328
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:23,064
<i> In the 1950s demonstrated, for </ i>
<i> to stop Rosenberg execution. </ i>

329
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:29,153
<i> In the 60s there were always </ i>
<i> demonstrations against the Vietnam War. </ i>

330
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,659
Oh no! We go eh our way!
Oh no! We go eh our way!

331
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:40,373
It must have been crazy to see
your ex How long were you together?

332
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,711
Over a year. We did not live together,
but we saw each other every night.

333
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:49,424
I had completely forgotten how nice it
is all the time to see someone you love.

334
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:52,677
I wonder what Joey's parents think of me?

335
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:56,139
- What do you think about Stacy?
- She's a little bleach in it.

336
00:29:56,306 --> 00:29:59,601
- What do you think?
- Your mother think ...

337
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:06,190
- She is extraordinarily white.
- So you do not like her skin color?

338
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:09,569
- You're dramatizing.
- She's not like us.

339
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:14,073
Wealthy, of trained
and paranoid monster hunters?

340
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,205
- She is udød, damn it!
- You think all vampires.

341
00:30:20,371 --> 00:30:25,043
Just because you're up late,
has not necessarily fangs!

342
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,047
Beings without warm blood in his veins ...

343
00:30:29,214 --> 00:30:34,093
Just because you're skinny,
drink not blood.

344
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,932
- You are so intolerant!
- Stop that! Both of them.

345
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:43,811
Let's invite her to dinner.
Is she one of them, as we see it.

346
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:45,688
Okay.

347
00:30:47,565 --> 00:30:51,069
Tonight we meet the
sad circumstances.

348
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:55,573
You've probably all heard of David
tragic accident summer.

349
00:30:57,158 --> 00:31:01,079
A century you are here,
and the next you're gone.

350
00:31:01,996 --> 00:31:06,501
- Can you feel something obnoxious?
- Yes.

351
00:31:07,627 --> 00:31:11,673
- We have a new participant.
- Yes. Hey. My name is Rita.

352
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,050
I psi-vampire.

353
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:19,806
- What is it?
- A psyche-vampire.

354
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:25,353
I live off other people's auras.
I absorb their energies.

355
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,065
How do you know
you do not just annoy them?

356
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:34,237
Psi-vampires are real vampires.
We do not shed blood for ...

357
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:44,205
Okay, calm down.

358
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:49,669
We must be more careful,
when we announce our meetings.

359
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:54,257
Stacy is invited as a jury member.
She has not voted since the 80s.

360
00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:57,427
It was I off.

361
00:31:57,594 --> 00:32:00,638
Consult stamvampyrer and cannibals.

362
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:04,392
- How do we Cisserus?
- Do you not know where she rests?

363
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,354
She summons us.
We'll never get to her.

364
00:32:09,314 --> 00:32:13,443
- Now we must work together.
- Our species are being persecuted.

365
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:19,324
I've seen it before. Instead
for torches have computers now.

366
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:23,953
By mr. Davidoff you are here?

367
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,751
Mr. Davidoff is informed
we are between 7 and 12

368
00:32:29,918 --> 00:32:35,882
- Should I not have a warrant?
- They will think we are from the police.

369
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:41,512
I'm from Time Warner, and you will
see "Jon Stewart" again, then lock up.

370
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:46,476
Let's get some light in here.

371
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:53,691
Good morning, my friend.

372
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:20,385
Buenas noches <i>, chicas. </ i>
Have you seen Ivan?

373
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:24,681
- He did not come as summoned.
- We saw him last week.

374
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:27,976
He is not strong enough
to ignore you.

375
00:33:28,142 --> 00:33:30,645
So should I just replace him.

376
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:34,607
But we are only good for
to endure and light office work.

377
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:39,737
Fold this gently together,
and you pack the soil.

378
00:33:39,904 --> 00:33:43,616
Are not you just love
these TV-shop bags?

379
00:33:48,997 --> 00:33:51,958
See how much land there is room for.

380
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:56,212
There will be a meeting for
all stamvampyrer and ALF'er.

381
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:59,591
- Many have been persecuted.
- So what?

382
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:03,177
If you continue in this way,
they find you.

383
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:05,763
No one takes my stay.

384
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,475
It is the only place
no New Yorker will.

385
00:34:09,642 --> 00:34:12,520
Your behavior hurts everyone else.

386
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:17,275
Vlad Tepes and his åndsboller?
Spidderen Vlad?

387
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:22,947
You know what it spidderi went out on?
He compensated.

388
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:26,784
In addition, I am going away.

389
00:34:28,244 --> 00:34:32,123
Check out this cool travel coffin,
he was doing to me.

390
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,459
Here is my itinerary.

391
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:38,630
Get me checked in as cargo
before dawn. It is a private.

392
00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:42,967
- What's in Spain?
- There is not just snails on the road.

393
00:34:43,134 --> 00:34:48,973
Look at him. Diego Bardem. The
beautiful and talented man in the world.

394
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,853
- Do you know him?
- No, but I am so down with him.

395
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:57,023
And listen here.

396
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,902
I will not hypnotize him.

397
00:35:02,195 --> 00:35:04,530
It must be true.

398
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:10,036
I have not felt that way for some
since Al Jolson.

399
00:35:10,203 --> 00:35:14,123
- Ham from "Mammy"?
- Yes, the guy from "Mammy".

400
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:20,171
He was fantastic. You understand the
not because you have not seen him live.

401
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,218
No, no, no.

402
00:35:34,394 --> 00:35:37,814
Hey. What did
your parents about me?

403
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:42,360
<i> Are you at your computer? </ i>
<i> Come on iChat. I want to see you. </ I>

404
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:48,491
- I do not have iChat.
- Yes, it is built.

405
00:35:48,658 --> 00:35:53,580
Yes, but my flatmate
came to paint the webcam above.

406
00:35:54,873 --> 00:35:59,043
- What did your parents?
- They thought you were a little pale.

407
00:36:00,712 --> 00:36:06,426
- What do you think?
- Bleaching. Light-skinned. Maybe a little sick.

408
00:36:06,593 --> 00:36:10,555
It is sparepærernes fault.
Everyone looks ugly out in the light.

409
00:36:10,722 --> 00:36:14,058
They will hear
Whether you come for dinner on Friday.

410
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:16,227
I'm coming.

411
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:51,179
Tanning Salon

412
00:37:13,493 --> 00:37:15,245
Stand still.

413
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:25,296
- Beautiful, is not it?
- It works. I will be mega brown.

414
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,677
Hey.

415
00:37:31,928 --> 00:37:34,430
- You look ...
- Tough out?

416
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:40,311
Yes. Come on.
Let me be your guide.

417
00:37:46,317 --> 00:37:50,697
- What's the deal?
- My grandfather and great-grandfather's things.

418
00:37:50,863 --> 00:37:56,160
My dad is an expert on vampires.
My family is crazy.

419
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:58,246
What is it?

420
00:37:58,413 --> 00:38:03,877
If someone you think is the vampire dies, so
puts you on here over the corpse's neck.

421
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:08,631
If they wake up and will crawl out
of the coffin, they beheaded.

422
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:11,968
Then there is the food.

423
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,607
- I know him!
- Do you know him?

424
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:31,446
- I know who he is. Vlad Tepes.
- It's pronounced "Teepeece".

425
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:35,783
He was
one of history's greatest sadists.

426
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,579
It may well be discussed.

427
00:38:39,746 --> 00:38:46,377
Well? Is it for discussion whether
should impale people and drink their blood?

428
00:38:46,544 --> 00:38:51,466
His illness prevented number
Ottomans to conquer Europe.

429
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:56,054
His armor is exhibited
in Bucharest. They see him as a hero.

430
00:38:56,221 --> 00:38:59,933
Were it not for him,
we would all talk Ottoman.

431
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,603
You did not like fish?
Do you want anything else?

432
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:08,524
No thanks, mrs. Van Helsing.
I really enjoy the food.

433
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:15,281
You should taste the soup.
It's an old family recipe.

434
00:39:21,955 --> 00:39:26,960
- Not the big fond of garlic?
- No, it's salt.

435
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:30,922
Just a little salt,
and I rise like a balloon.

436
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:35,051
My dad thinks we do not kiss,
if we get garlic breath.

437
00:39:35,218 --> 00:39:37,053
It did not.

438
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,933
Mom, we eat dessert later.
The film begins at 21.30.

439
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:04,831
They have a strong will.

440
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:08,543
- What do you want with my son?
- What do you think?

441
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,504
You will suck the life out of him.

442
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:15,508
Not more than other lovers will.

443
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:19,804
- Are you ready?
- Thanks for dinner.

444
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:22,724
We'll see.

445
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:30,106
- Did you see her? Is she one of them?
- I was not so aware.

446
00:40:30,273 --> 00:40:34,235
She was quite dark skin,
but we look at the footage.

447
00:40:34,402 --> 00:40:39,657
I can not remember, there were empty
chairs. What have I done wrong?

448
00:40:39,824 --> 00:40:42,410
Nothing.

449
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:55,590
Why do people out if they just want to
looking at the little glowing boxes?

450
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:59,510
You sound like my grandmother.
There is Renfield course.

451
00:41:00,136 --> 00:41:05,433
Listen. We can only sit here, if we
order a bottle for $ 400.

452
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,061
Bottle seating.

453
00:41:09,187 --> 00:41:12,774
They were observed for ten minutes ago.
It must be good sex.

454
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:16,819
- We have not done it yet.
- So it's pure text?

455
00:41:17,946 --> 00:41:21,032
I've been looking for you,
your lifeless bitch.

456
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,662
- What happens to you?
- What have you done to Ivan?

457
00:41:27,956 --> 00:41:31,125
First you destroy it
with the daftige girl.

458
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:34,837
- And now Ivan ford won.
- You mild dineser!

459
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:40,927
Hello!
Not in the eyes of day shift.

460
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:45,306
You remember nothing
the last few minutes.

461
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:49,102
- I know nothing. I saw nothing.
- Stop that.

462
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:54,023
And why should we do anything Ivan?
So put Cisserus us in work.

463
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,820
You must come to
a Anonymous Sangvinikere meeting.

464
00:41:58,987 --> 00:42:03,950
You do not become a member. We
fear that they will force us out in the sun.

465
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:07,203
Is that why
Ivan disappeared?

466
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:12,834
- Maybe. So his neighbors something?
- They said cable-TV people were there.

467
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:17,797
Can Time Warner well just barge in
and kill people?

468
00:42:19,257 --> 00:42:22,010
Come to the meeting. We must do something.

469
00:42:22,176 --> 00:42:26,306
- All smoking for reckoning.
- You do not show up.

470
00:42:26,472 --> 00:42:31,936
IRS believes you have to pay
more in taxes. It can do.

471
00:42:32,103 --> 00:42:35,565
You need only attend,
If you have objections.

472
00:42:35,732 --> 00:42:39,694
- How do you know that?
- I am a certified public accountant.

473
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:44,198
- You just got new customers.
- Not me. I have one.

474
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,423
What are you wearing?
The entire fashion history?

475
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,468
I will meet with Danny.

476
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:08,473
Belle Epoque-shirts are beautiful.
60s skirts long legs.

477
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,060
70s shoes make you high
and is comfortable to wear.

478
00:43:12,227 --> 00:43:14,812
But what happens with the hat?

479
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:21,402
- People say I look smart in it.
- People from your barbershop quartet?

480
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:30,328
Welcome to Bo Better-home.
Do not you want something to drink?

481
00:43:30,495 --> 00:43:34,249
- No thanks.
- I must certainly have coffee.

482
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:40,046
- This is from last week, so ...
- Do you work for the state?

483
00:43:40,213 --> 00:43:43,967
Do I look like?
I am civil rights lawyer.

484
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:49,889
I'm in the middle of a deportation,
where they have listened to people illegally.

485
00:43:50,348 --> 00:43:55,395
I thought they would stop if the
not heard anything terror-related?

486
00:43:55,562 --> 00:43:57,730
No.

487
00:43:57,897 --> 00:44:01,526
See here. I've been looking
after pictures of your mother.

488
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:10,368
See here. She slipped always,
just before the picture was taken.

489
00:44:11,578 --> 00:44:16,332
- She was superstitious.
- It's a little crazy. Godfather!

490
00:44:16,499 --> 00:44:20,086
- This newspaper I have.
- Have you? Saved she on?

491
00:44:20,253 --> 00:44:24,465
- Add the rather in a folder.
- Did she like this picture?

492
00:44:24,632 --> 00:44:29,929
I then also okay then.
What a great time it was.

493
00:44:30,096 --> 00:44:35,351
Being young and in love and feel
as part of something important.

494
00:44:37,145 --> 00:44:40,231
Does your mother said,
why she disappeared?

495
00:44:40,398 --> 00:44:42,859
Not really.

496
00:44:43,026 --> 00:44:47,864
You know what? I'll pick up some
film to my wife before they close.

497
00:44:48,031 --> 00:44:50,867
- How wacky.
- Huh

498
00:44:51,034 --> 00:44:53,453
That we going the same way.

499
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:56,372
Cool.

500
00:44:56,539 --> 00:45:01,085
Angela easily fall asleep,
so it must be movies she loves.

501
00:45:01,252 --> 00:45:04,672
So she can keep up with,
although she dozes off.

502
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:08,509
- Can I help?
- No. I know what I'm looking for.

503
00:45:08,676 --> 00:45:11,721
So I see me around.

504
00:45:14,265 --> 00:45:17,477
Do you have any
James Cagney-posters?

505
00:45:17,644 --> 00:45:20,063
James Cameron?

506
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:24,984
No, James Cagney.
From the movie "Incandescent".

507
00:45:25,151 --> 00:45:26,653
No.

508
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:30,198
- What about Fred Astaire?
- No.

509
00:45:30,365 --> 00:45:32,909
Jack Lemmon? Paul Newman?

510
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:35,828
Ham with salad dressing?

511
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:39,832
- Yes.
- No.

512
00:45:45,797 --> 00:45:50,134
All present mobiles.
Add mobiles now. Throw them!

513
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:53,846
- Hands up! Give me money!
- He has a bad heart.

514
00:45:54,013 --> 00:45:57,559
Shut the fuck up!
Come on!

515
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:02,105
No, no. Ladies, get up,
and give me money.

516
00:46:05,775 --> 00:46:08,528
Stop it.
Relax.

517
00:46:20,498 --> 00:46:23,251
- Feeling better now?
- Yes.

518
00:46:24,627 --> 00:46:28,464
Run them to the hospital.
And stop stealing.

519
00:46:28,631 --> 00:46:32,594
You were bitten by your cat.
I had to learn first aid.

520
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,054
You hate junk food.

521
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:38,725
And get "Society enemy"
with Cagney.

522
00:46:40,476 --> 00:46:44,355
Are you okay? I could have
hypnotized you -

523
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:49,319
- But I would still
tell you now.

524
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:53,489
So you broke up with me,
because you would not drink my blood?

525
00:46:53,656 --> 00:46:58,995
- I do not drink human blood!
- What did you do to him man?

526
00:46:59,162 --> 00:47:02,916
Oh no.
Have you never seen a vampire bat?

527
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:08,338
A small rodent can suck all the blood
out of a cow in a few minutes -

528
00:47:08,504 --> 00:47:12,634
- As a result of an enzyme in their saliva,
a harmless blood thinner.

529
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,346
I have too.
I did not drink the man's blood.

530
00:47:16,512 --> 00:47:20,141
I spat at him
in order to stop the stroke.

531
00:47:20,308 --> 00:47:24,479
Well, you just spit on him?
It's something completely different.

532
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:28,900
- Otherwise he would have been brain damaged.
- How old are you?

533
00:47:30,985 --> 00:47:36,366
- A little older than you.
- So you only socialize with people in a year's time?

534
00:47:36,533 --> 00:47:40,161
It takes seven years
before people aback about it.

535
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:43,831
I would have been with you
as long as possible.

536
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:48,378
But when you became politically active,
were you recognized by people on the street.

537
00:47:48,545 --> 00:47:51,839
I thought:
"It is his glory."

538
00:47:52,006 --> 00:47:55,468
You could get just the woman
you would have.

539
00:47:55,635 --> 00:48:00,932
It seemed wrong to rob you
the chance to meet a beautiful woman.

540
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:03,935
And you met the one.
Did not you?

541
00:48:04,561 --> 00:48:06,854
Yes, I did.

542
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:10,233
And I'd better see
how she feels.

543
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,196
But I must say that I have it,
as if it's the wildest trip.

544
00:48:15,363 --> 00:48:17,866
I see you again?

545
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:21,744
Yes, of course.

546
00:49:18,635 --> 00:49:21,679
It is Germany
before World War II.

547
00:49:21,846 --> 00:49:27,268
Because of rascality curse
søvngængeren, murdering his people.

548
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:33,149
- I'm not.
- Germany. A curse.

549
00:49:33,316 --> 00:49:36,236
- Adolf.
- Your eyes remind me of someone.

550
00:49:36,402 --> 00:49:39,948
- Adolf Hitler.
- No, not him.

551
00:49:40,114 --> 00:49:43,117
Audrey Hepburn. Same initials.

552
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:46,454
Concentrate now on symbolism.

553
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:53,378
Do you not curse me? Or I
could cast a spell on you.

554
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:57,340
- What would you have me do?
- To laugh hysterically.

555
00:50:18,361 --> 00:50:20,613
Holy shit.

556
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,449
Have you tried it that way before?

557
00:50:23,616 --> 00:50:26,077
Not since the 80s.

558
00:50:35,962 --> 00:50:39,048
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting early.

559
00:50:39,215 --> 00:50:42,760
- Truancy.
- It does not. I'll call you later.

560
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:45,889
My parents come first in the morning.

561
00:50:46,055 --> 00:50:49,559
It is too early to talk about it.
I have to go.

562
00:50:57,942 --> 00:50:59,861
Call me.

563
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,741
What the ..?!

564
00:51:10,663 --> 00:51:13,416
- Is there something wrong?
- What?

565
00:51:17,086 --> 00:51:21,507
If you want to talk about it,
if there are problems with Stacy ...

566
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:27,889
Would not you like!

567
00:51:28,056 --> 00:51:32,727
He answers neither of my text messages
tweets, emails, phone messages ...

568
00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:35,521
- Gossip to his father?
- No.

569
00:51:35,688 --> 00:51:39,484
- Gossip Danny to the authorities?
- No.

570
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:44,113
- He hates authorities.
- I confront Joey.

571
00:51:45,573 --> 00:51:47,867
Are you mad at me?

572
00:51:48,535 --> 00:51:50,954
Do not just go.

573
00:51:54,457 --> 00:51:56,960
- Honestly?
- Yes.

574
00:51:57,126 --> 00:52:00,547
So every night there ...
garlic vines.

575
00:52:00,713 --> 00:52:04,551
- You were afraid of them yesterday.
- I've always hated garlic.

576
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:10,473
- We need to talk about it.
- My father warned me.

577
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,811
I've never done
a human or animal matter.

578
00:52:14,978 --> 00:52:19,732
- You just wanted a Van Helsing.
- No, it kept me as rather away.

579
00:52:19,899 --> 00:52:24,362
If I wanted to drink your blood,
I would have written ten pages -

580
00:52:24,529 --> 00:52:28,366
- On Freud's influence
the surrealists?

581
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:34,539
How do I know
you wrote it for me?

582
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:39,794
I also wrote about surrealism
formation about the First World War.

583
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:42,881
- The I better like.
- Can you do it?

584
00:52:43,047 --> 00:52:47,135
- Do you trust me now?
- You will have the best character.

585
00:52:56,978 --> 00:53:00,690
You know,
I would never hurt you.

586
00:53:01,399 --> 00:53:06,613
Is it all dagproblematikken? Do you
could walk on the beach with your boyfriend?

587
00:53:06,779 --> 00:53:09,490
No, I'm natmenneske.

588
00:53:09,657 --> 00:53:12,702
Is it blood?
Will you at the restaurant?

589
00:53:12,869 --> 00:53:16,539
- I'm not gourmet.
- What is it?

590
00:53:18,499 --> 00:53:21,878
I hate,
when my parents are right.

591
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:45,109
Now, you see.

592
00:53:47,987 --> 00:53:49,489
Thank you!

593
00:54:02,126 --> 00:54:04,462
Write now under.

594
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:45,795
Hey. Come on.

595
00:54:48,298 --> 00:54:50,300
Hello, Renfield.

596
00:54:50,466 --> 00:54:53,177
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Yes.

597
00:54:53,344 --> 00:54:57,557
- It can not generate you.
- Yes, you hurt yourself.

598
00:54:57,724 --> 00:55:01,311
- So wake me.
- How it works not.

599
00:55:01,477 --> 00:55:06,816
You are accountant. Clear it out. If
all vampires drank the blood of others -

600
00:55:06,983 --> 00:55:12,614
- Would people eating
each other before the birth of Christ.

601
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,450
Only a master vampire can wake you up.

602
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:19,871
- Is it the Tepes have knitted?
- Yes, he should see, I use it.

603
00:55:20,038 --> 00:55:22,582
He also knit one for you.

604
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:28,171
I will tell you, folks.
This is fantastic.

605
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:32,675
Apart from Cisserus we have collected
all the area's ancestors.

606
00:55:32,842 --> 00:55:35,595
- Vadim from Russia.
- Ukraine.

607
00:55:35,762 --> 00:55:38,181
Aswan from Kush.

608
00:55:38,348 --> 00:55:42,602
- Ghuri, the Turkish ancestor.
- Hello, Ghuri.

609
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:47,023
First let me hear how many
which has been summoned to court?

610
00:55:49,734 --> 00:55:54,322
Excuse me, but why
we eat not just lawyers?

611
00:55:55,323 --> 00:55:58,826
Are you mad? We can not
eat all the lawyers.

612
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:02,288
- Why not?
- It is excluded.

613
00:56:02,455 --> 00:56:05,833
I can probably mark
here are people from the day shift.

614
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,254
- This is my granddaughter, Sarah.
- Hi, Sarah.

615
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,716
It is our friend Renfield. He is
accountant and expert in tax matters.

616
00:56:13,883 --> 00:56:17,637
And there was also
have a lawyer present?

617
00:56:17,804 --> 00:56:22,767
Hi there. My name is Danny.
I am civil rights lawyer.

618
00:56:22,934 --> 00:56:25,979
I will not be forced out during the day.

619
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:29,857
And I do not want
your resting places desecrated.

620
00:56:30,024 --> 00:56:34,112
But according to the law, the state must
break into with you anytime.

621
00:56:34,279 --> 00:56:37,782
All your mobiles -

622
00:56:37,949 --> 00:56:41,953
- IPhones and computers
makes you easier to find.

623
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,124
I must warn you against
using electronic equipment.

624
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:50,503
How should we contact each other?

625
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:55,258
- I used to write things down.
- Well, in such a calendar.

626
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:59,137
But the PC tells me,
when the sun goes up and down.

627
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:02,348
It can be seen in my almanac.

628
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:10,356
Here, moon phases, tides,
sunrise and-drop and ...

629
00:57:10,523 --> 00:57:12,817
- Oh, my goodness!
- What?

630
00:57:12,984 --> 00:57:15,987
Total solar eclipse in two weeks!

631
00:57:16,154 --> 00:57:18,698
Wait a minute.
14.10 to 15.40.

632
00:57:18,865 --> 00:57:23,745
A shame it's not there, we are
summoned. So we could use hypnosis.

633
00:57:23,912 --> 00:57:28,666
It is no obstacle.
Can not we just move the agreements?

634
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:34,005
We may delete you from the system.
We may change depending on their PCs.

635
00:57:34,172 --> 00:57:38,343
Now I understand better,
why you do not drink human blood.

636
00:57:38,509 --> 00:57:42,972
- Cool! If you go over on our side?
- Will the ladies be my wives?

637
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:45,016
Bite your teeth.

638
00:57:45,183 --> 00:57:47,477
Not literally!

639
00:57:58,363 --> 00:58:02,534
Are you okay?
You also threw up yesterday.

640
00:58:04,202 --> 00:58:08,373
Look what I got for you.
Cleanest, pharmaceutical quality.

641
00:58:08,957 --> 00:58:13,670
But they're cute. Not pests.
They could be a pet.

642
00:58:13,836 --> 00:58:16,965
- They do not give nausea.
- I'm fine.

643
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:21,970
- It is only when I get up.
- Not the nøleri. We gotta go.

644
00:58:24,013 --> 00:58:27,475
I do not want to hear it.
It's in again with low waist.

645
00:58:27,642 --> 00:58:31,062
- According to whom?
- I saw Keira Knightley in it.

646
00:58:31,229 --> 00:58:34,566
That is,
because she plays in a movie.

647
00:58:34,732 --> 00:58:39,737
- You would not want to talk!
- It's from my college time.

648
00:58:39,904 --> 00:58:42,532
Would you football team?

649
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:45,743
I have nothing more modestly.

650
00:58:56,087 --> 00:58:59,173
I had completely forgotten,
how it is.

651
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,801
It's a completely different world.

652
00:59:01,968 --> 00:59:05,221
- How many women.
- Have a nice day.

653
00:59:05,388 --> 00:59:09,267
Come on, everybody.
We only have two hours.

654
00:59:09,976 --> 00:59:13,688
- You do what my accountant says.
- Accountant.

655
00:59:18,234 --> 00:59:22,655
It is Ghuri.
Case number 3-18.

656
00:59:22,822 --> 00:59:26,326
It is Vlad Tepes.
He was granted asylum in. ..

657
00:59:26,492 --> 00:59:29,037
The 1583rd

658
00:59:29,204 --> 00:59:32,624
He is now married to
a U.S. citizen.

659
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:35,752
Four.

660
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:39,547
The mother is engaged
with an American.

661
00:59:39,714 --> 00:59:44,385
... Study visa so he can be
enrolled at UCLA.

662
00:59:46,596 --> 00:59:47,972
DELETE

663
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:49,724
Recycle

664
00:59:49,891 --> 00:59:53,686
Stacy Daimer is unable to
to appear as a juror.

665
00:59:53,853 --> 00:59:56,981
... Unable
to appear as a juror.

666
00:59:57,148 --> 01:00:01,653
- Delete the call.
- Add deleted names in the trash.

667
01:00:01,819 --> 01:00:06,199
Empty the trash. Ask the IT guy on
remove the hard drive.

668
01:00:07,659 --> 01:00:09,619
Sorry!

669
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:18,795
THE HAPPY NIGHTS ARE BACK

670
01:00:58,877 --> 01:01:01,045
Close it up now.

671
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:06,384
Keep it up.
Beautiful colors for you!

672
01:01:07,385 --> 01:01:11,973
There are bogreception
right now on the tenth floor. What do you say?

673
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,851
It's not worth it.

674
01:01:15,018 --> 01:01:19,188
All New York's famous there.
I can get just who it should be.

675
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:21,900
It gets tired of.

676
01:01:23,026 --> 01:01:26,863
- I love that song.
- Shall we dance?

677
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:37,832
- Do not you dance?
- I'm not good at dancing.

678
01:01:37,999 --> 01:01:41,920
- Yes, you are. I can remember.
- I can not.

679
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:23,086
SPANISH IDOL GONE

680
01:02:23,253 --> 01:02:28,216
- Joey went because his dad freaked.
- There are enough problems in the office.

681
01:02:28,383 --> 01:02:31,636
- Who can it be?
- Is not that wild?

682
01:02:31,803 --> 01:02:36,474
I have been dating for 25 years, but I
've never had it like this.

683
01:02:36,641 --> 01:02:40,603
- What about you and Danny?
- I still love him.

684
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:43,398
But his wife's illness.

685
01:02:43,565 --> 01:02:47,277
I just enjoy
to be with him.

686
01:02:47,443 --> 01:02:51,614
Would not it be cool
If we both had a girlfriend?

687
01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:56,828
- <i> Mott Street </ i>
- Why is she already back?

688
01:02:56,995 --> 01:03:02,500
- It was probably not with Diego.
- Now it otherwise as well.

689
01:03:10,425 --> 01:03:14,220
- I've never seen really dead.
- What have you done?

690
01:03:14,387 --> 01:03:18,308
I know how it is,
when you eat Chinese.

691
01:03:18,474 --> 01:03:21,519
Half an hour later
you are hungry again.

692
01:03:21,686 --> 01:03:26,399
- How could you do this?
- I eat constantly.

693
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:30,361
I am so depressed.
Why could he not like me?

694
01:03:30,528 --> 01:03:33,698
I'm as wild hotter
than his girlfriend.

695
01:03:33,865 --> 01:03:37,577
Maybe she was not
a murderous psychopath.

696
01:03:38,161 --> 01:03:40,997
- It's really disgusting!
- Yes.

697
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:46,169
I could easily hate myself,
but one day with fråderen -

698
01:03:46,336 --> 01:03:49,631
- Makes me's not bad
throughout the weekend.

699
01:03:49,797 --> 01:03:52,091
What's with him?

700
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,054
Make him not just done?

701
01:03:57,972 --> 01:04:00,475
I said, "Beat him to death."

702
01:04:12,654 --> 01:04:18,535
I really can not kill.
In're totally inept.

703
01:04:19,118 --> 01:04:20,912
Forget it.

704
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:24,249
Is it not even a fortune cookie?

705
01:04:38,137 --> 01:04:44,102
- It was at the last minute.
- Now I kistehår tomorrow.

706
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:48,898
- Goody, I can not do again.
- I can not.

707
01:04:54,404 --> 01:04:56,865
VAMPIRES!

708
01:04:57,031 --> 01:04:59,492
We must of course adapt.

709
01:04:59,659 --> 01:05:03,121
It no longer makes sense
to be violent.

710
01:05:03,288 --> 01:05:07,000
She does not belong to us.
She is insane.

711
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,960
Surely!

712
01:05:11,045 --> 01:05:16,426
Is there some sort of doctor for us?
Stacy is sick.

713
01:05:16,593 --> 01:05:18,720
We can not be sick.

714
01:05:18,887 --> 01:05:22,265
No, but she throws up every night,
when we stand up.

715
01:05:22,432 --> 01:05:25,643
How old was she,
when she was awakened?

716
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:29,188
- 20th
- I suppose she has a boyfriend?

717
01:05:29,355 --> 01:05:32,317
- Why?
- She is pregnant.

718
01:05:32,483 --> 01:05:37,405
- Can she have children?
- No, she miscarry naturally.

719
01:05:37,572 --> 01:05:42,160
- Unless she becomes vice versa.
- So if Cisserus door?

720
01:05:42,327 --> 01:05:46,122
Cisserus ...
Just take it easy.

721
01:05:47,165 --> 01:05:50,210
Stacy is fine again
a week's time.

722
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:54,797
We were told about a patient
a bidesår.

723
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:57,926
They found surveillance tape.

724
01:05:58,092 --> 01:06:02,055
- Where's the body?
- At Mount Sinai Hospital.

725
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:06,476
Sit down,
and listen carefully.

726
01:06:08,102 --> 01:06:12,273
You think I'm crazy,
but you must do something for me.

727
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:16,778
You must have it here for you
day and night.

728
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:20,865
See how you let it.
You may only use silver bullets.

729
01:06:21,032 --> 01:06:25,828
- Against whom? Stacy?
- Keep it on you! Not bullshit.

730
01:06:26,955 --> 01:06:31,042
If there is famine,
so grab a cup nøddemysli.

731
01:06:31,209 --> 01:06:35,588
Comedian? He's not the least bit funny.
I've never seen him in anything.

732
01:06:36,339 --> 01:06:40,051
- What do you see?
- An insult to those with talent.

733
01:06:40,218 --> 01:06:43,012
The great 80s cavalcade.

734
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:45,431
Show it to Goody.

735
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:49,269
My father has taken on
give me this.

736
01:06:50,311 --> 01:06:54,315
- Strange ...
- Beware, there are silver bullets in.

737
01:06:54,482 --> 01:06:56,568
What's he doing?

738
01:06:56,734 --> 01:07:01,364
He was paranoid,
since he saw the tape from the hospital.

739
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:04,701
A guy who flew
to the main entrance.

740
01:07:04,868 --> 01:07:09,122
Where am I stupid! I forgot
everything about cameras.

741
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:12,250
- Have you?
- We have not done anything.

742
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:16,129
- It was our ancestress Cisserus.
- She's a monster.

743
01:07:16,296 --> 01:07:21,301
- She spoils it for all of us.
- Take it easy. We speak with Tepes.

744
01:07:21,467 --> 01:07:23,887
I just talked to him.

745
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:27,849
He said, you soon feel better.
You're just pregnant.

746
01:07:28,016 --> 01:07:32,604
- What? Am I Pregnant?
- We must have a child!

747
01:07:33,563 --> 01:07:36,691
Whoa!
Am I really pregnant?

748
01:07:36,858 --> 01:07:40,069
Would you like to have a child?

749
01:07:40,236 --> 01:07:45,033
Yes! I am over 40 years.
It is the last chance.

750
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,911
And I will be a great, babe father.

751
01:07:48,077 --> 01:07:52,916
Forget about cell phones, iPhones,
PowerBooks and iPads.

752
01:07:53,082 --> 01:07:54,834
Hooray.

753
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:59,589
Now I can clear all my needs
with my new mini-iPad.

754
01:07:59,756 --> 01:08:03,009
- It looks like your mobile.
- But can not call.

755
01:08:03,176 --> 01:08:07,096
I can tweet, email, be
Facebook, get reminders ...

756
01:08:07,263 --> 01:08:11,851
So you can read thousands of
unimportant messages and advertisements -

757
01:08:12,018 --> 01:08:14,896
- And your acquaintances brain vomit?

758
01:08:15,063 --> 01:08:18,942
You sound as nicely hormonal.
Maybe you are also pregnant.

759
01:08:19,108 --> 01:08:22,570
So now you learn something new shit
to know -

760
01:08:22,737 --> 01:08:27,200
- There is no better than the old one,
which is not compatible with the new one.

761
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:31,454
Just to blogging
and look stupid docu-soaps.

762
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:36,626
It all goes too fast!
And I'm tired.

763
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:40,380
I am sick of it all!

764
01:08:41,923 --> 01:08:45,385
We do not get mini-iPads.

765
01:08:49,889 --> 01:08:53,810
See. They had only a few channels.
But they had Groucho Marx.

766
01:08:53,977 --> 01:08:56,980
It is not Groucho.
He had a mustache.

767
01:08:57,146 --> 01:09:00,733
And glasses and cigar.

768
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:06,406
- <i> Who was buried in Grant's tomb? </ I>
- Were people really that stupid?

769
01:09:06,573 --> 01:09:11,286
- He just wanted to make sure they won.
- Located Grant's Tomb in New York?

770
01:09:11,452 --> 01:09:13,454
- No.
- Yes.

771
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:16,332
- Have you been there?
- No.

772
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:19,002
There it is!

773
01:09:19,836 --> 01:09:23,506
It is the place
no New Yorker will.

774
01:09:23,673 --> 01:09:27,677
Cisserus choose as a monument
and so even a grave!

775
01:09:27,844 --> 01:09:30,763
- You got a right.
- Come on.

776
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,435
Can I see?

777
01:09:35,602 --> 01:09:40,106
I can feel it, but I
thought you would have a child before me.

778
01:09:40,273 --> 01:09:42,775
Is it strange? Now that ...

779
01:09:42,942 --> 01:09:46,654
You must make a decision
independent of me or Joey.

780
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:51,701
The child survives only
If you are reversed.

781
01:09:51,868 --> 01:09:56,539
- But then the Cisserus the die.
- That's right.

782
01:09:56,706 --> 01:10:01,294
I would be in their 40s.
But I wanted to be a mother.

783
01:10:03,087 --> 01:10:06,299
- You would also be older.
- Yes.

784
01:10:06,466 --> 01:10:11,638
It also affects my you. How has
you feel about not being young anymore?

785
01:10:11,804 --> 01:10:16,017
Should I miss going to clubs
and date all the idiots?

786
01:10:16,184 --> 01:10:22,398
It would be nice not to have to
fake nostalgia for the 90s series.

787
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:27,111
- And all the stupid abbreviations.
- And the clothes and the music.

788
01:10:27,278 --> 01:10:30,865
There is no longer anything new to
To stay young.

789
01:10:31,032 --> 01:10:33,618
And then we get a child.

790
01:10:35,453 --> 01:10:39,791
But we can not kill Cisserus.
She has endured for centuries.

791
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:42,544
Because no one knew her stay.

792
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:46,130
But she is very strong,
and we have some cake arms.

793
01:10:46,297 --> 01:10:51,094
Yes, but she is sloppy and pretentious.
We call in the big boys.

794
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:54,347
- Who?
- Your future father in law.

795
01:10:56,849 --> 01:10:59,352
I just need to achieve one thing before.

796
01:10:59,519 --> 01:11:04,232
Did you know that you will do everything
to win a little more time?

797
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:08,820
Will you be natmenneske and love me
only let her eat animals?

798
01:11:08,987 --> 01:11:11,406
Can you keep her alive?

799
01:11:11,573 --> 01:11:14,993
- Not really alive ...
- But not even death?

800
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:18,371
I can not, but he can.

801
01:11:18,538 --> 01:11:21,416
Yes! I do not want to lose her.

802
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:28,423
I will not be disturbed.

803
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:48,753
That's enough.
As long as it does not take.

804
01:12:59,222 --> 01:13:01,641
You have a sweet wife.

805
01:13:03,476 --> 01:13:08,857
So I just want to hear
how you two have together?

806
01:13:09,023 --> 01:13:12,735
Is there any chance,
In that split?

807
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:19,033
Danny.

808
01:13:26,207 --> 01:13:29,127
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

809
01:13:38,261 --> 01:13:40,847
- Now close up!
- Who is it?

810
01:13:41,014 --> 01:13:44,225
One of your son's friends.
I will help you.

811
01:13:44,392 --> 01:13:48,688
- Will you help me?
- I have good news grandfather.

812
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:56,738
Did you grandpa?

813
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,661
I thought all the victims were vampires
or dead.

814
01:14:03,828 --> 01:14:06,664
I've never heard of inversions.

815
01:14:06,831 --> 01:14:11,002
I have not seen it for myself,
but if you are young enough ...

816
01:14:11,169 --> 01:14:14,297
They can not be used for anything.

817
01:14:16,132 --> 01:14:19,761
And it's not just Joey's rebellion?

818
01:14:21,346 --> 01:14:25,600
- Is it serious between them?
- I've never seen Stacy so happy.

819
01:14:25,767 --> 01:14:30,563
He welcomes such to
to become a father. It is true love.

820
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:33,775
- When did you wake up?
- In the 1841st

821
01:14:33,942 --> 01:14:36,986
I survived
and asked her to create me.

822
01:14:37,153 --> 01:14:41,658
- Would you like to be a vampire?
- It was the lesser of two evils.

823
01:14:41,824 --> 01:14:45,161
In 1840 hit a cholera epidemic
Manhattan.

824
01:14:45,328 --> 01:14:48,456
It was a painful and undignified death.

825
01:14:48,623 --> 01:14:51,543
My husband and my sisters
had passed away.

826
01:14:51,709 --> 01:14:54,462
But my kids had done it.

827
01:14:54,629 --> 01:15:00,009
I had digestive problems.
It is one of the first symptoms.

828
01:15:00,176 --> 01:15:03,513
Orphaned had a hard time.

829
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:09,143
- Survived your children then?
- My son was less than 63 years old.

830
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:13,940
And my daughter married
Peter Meester and was 99 years.

831
01:15:14,107 --> 01:15:16,401
It was unheard of back then.

832
01:15:16,568 --> 01:15:21,656
Most older've not
a young, strong mother for help.

833
01:15:21,823 --> 01:15:27,078
I disappeared when the grandkids
came to. I would have scared them.

834
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:31,374
- Did you get it?
- <i> Yes. </ I>

835
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:35,086
The only way out is
to behead her.

836
01:15:35,253 --> 01:15:38,631
Everything else makes her just mad.

837
01:15:38,798 --> 01:15:43,511
And when Cisserus is dead
Stacy will be a normal girl.

838
01:15:44,596 --> 01:15:47,515
Yes, of her being.

839
01:15:48,766 --> 01:15:53,438
- What happens to you?
- I saved my family.

840
01:15:53,605 --> 01:15:56,733
Now we need to save your.

841
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,027
Here is your family tree.

842
01:16:01,529 --> 01:16:03,781
Your descendants.

843
01:16:03,948 --> 01:16:06,701
Your great-great-great-great-grandson ...

844
01:16:06,868 --> 01:16:10,538
...'m An addict.
He is in prison.

845
01:16:10,705 --> 01:16:14,751
Four doctors.
One of them in Doctors Without Borders.

846
01:16:14,918 --> 01:16:19,130
Two professors, four teachers
and in the House of Representatives -

847
01:16:19,297 --> 01:16:22,717
- Jane Rutherford,
Chairman of several committees.

848
01:16:22,884 --> 01:16:27,263
- She looks like you.
- Thank you.

849
01:16:28,139 --> 01:16:33,686
Good. Let rifles lie.
Take axes, scythes, all with blades.

850
01:16:33,853 --> 01:16:37,815
Well so. Now necks we
the dried bitch.

851
01:16:40,026 --> 01:16:44,864
I'll also rare
but you meet nice people there.

852
01:16:45,031 --> 01:16:49,285
I'll never there.
I can not believe I met you.

853
01:16:49,452 --> 01:16:52,247
- You are beautiful.
- Where are you sweet.

854
01:16:53,873 --> 01:16:56,793
- Shall we sit?
- Certainly.

855
01:16:58,545 --> 01:17:01,506
- Here is nice.
- Yes, is not there?

856
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:08,054
Is your wife not worried
where you are so late at night?

857
01:17:08,221 --> 01:17:12,559
She is traveling. What she
do not know, she has not hurt.

858
01:17:13,893 --> 01:17:18,398
- You are surely a bad boy.
- I can be very bad.

859
01:17:18,565 --> 01:17:21,943
What does a bad boy like you?

860
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,487
I am a dentist.

861
01:17:24,654 --> 01:17:28,324
Are you dentist?
There I was probably lucky.

862
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:32,579
I have a problem,
What worries me very much. See here.

863
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:39,544
I've never seen anything so ...

864
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:43,006
No! No!

865
01:17:47,385 --> 01:17:49,178
Run!

866
01:17:52,724 --> 01:17:55,351
- Your asshole.
- Come on.

867
01:18:05,028 --> 01:18:09,157
Naughty girls!
I am very disappointed in you.

868
01:18:09,324 --> 01:18:14,829
I have done so much for you.
And this is the thanks?

869
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:21,794
How to care for
his ancestress.

870
01:18:25,798 --> 01:18:28,259
There is no powder in the!

871
01:18:38,019 --> 01:18:40,021
Duk you!

872
01:18:45,109 --> 01:18:50,240
- We did it!
- No. She must be into the grave.

873
01:18:53,368 --> 01:18:56,162
Have I got such a flat ass?

874
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:02,043
Can I just say ...

875
01:19:06,339 --> 01:19:09,717
- What do we do to the body?
- The door in a moment.

876
01:19:09,884 --> 01:19:13,054
- Where were you?
- You asked me to take a chainsaw.

877
01:19:13,221 --> 01:19:18,351
- But it lacked gasoline.
- You should have thought of before!

878
01:19:18,518 --> 01:19:23,690
- I thought it ran on electricity.
- Are there electrical outlets in the woods?!

879
01:19:23,857 --> 01:19:26,818
- Like a hairdryer ...
- Joey!

880
01:19:26,985 --> 01:19:31,489
<i> I will praise the Lord come </ i>
<i> I have seen His glory </ i>

881
01:19:31,656 --> 01:19:36,244
<i> He squashing grapes of wrath </ i>
<i> world he subject </ i>

882
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:39,497
- Come on!
- It's just too much.

883
01:19:45,879 --> 01:19:47,672
Hurry up!

884
01:19:51,968 --> 01:19:53,928
Throw it in!

885
01:20:04,355 --> 01:20:07,066
- Can you feel anything?
- No.

886
01:20:08,568 --> 01:20:10,445
Wait a minute.

887
01:20:26,085 --> 01:20:29,047
Was that it?
You were just 20 years old?

888
01:20:29,214 --> 01:20:33,801
I have not drunk, smoked,
taken drugs or sunbathe.

889
01:20:39,224 --> 01:20:44,812
You may not have as good genes
but with a little laser surgery ...

890
01:20:48,733 --> 01:20:51,277
You did not lie about your age, do you?

891
01:20:51,444 --> 01:20:55,740
No call their children
Goody for longer.

892
01:20:57,534 --> 01:21:01,412
- You will not be even older, right?
- It's okay.

893
01:21:01,579 --> 01:21:05,083
I've been here long enough.
I'm tired.

894
01:21:06,501 --> 01:21:11,965
I should have guessed it. History
Channel only shows films about Hitler.

895
01:21:13,383 --> 01:21:17,220
Before I met you,
I was ready to go out in the sun.

896
01:21:17,387 --> 01:21:20,223
You taught me to have fun.

897
01:21:27,105 --> 01:21:31,818
- Is there anything we can do for you?
- Yes. I would not be standing here.

898
01:21:31,985 --> 01:21:35,530
- I will stand in the midst of chaos.
- Come on.

899
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,752
Are you okay?

900
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:06,477
- Are you okay? How are you?
- I'm hungry.

901
01:22:06,644 --> 01:22:12,734
- I could eat a pretzel.
- Loading you not just one, Joey?

902
01:22:55,401 --> 01:22:57,904
Goody? Goody?

903
01:23:12,877 --> 01:23:15,004
You mild.

904
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:17,961
- I saw good.
- She was the one who checked me out.

905
01:25:18,127 --> 01:25:21,214
Now remember,
I gave you my life's best years.

906
01:25:21,381 --> 01:25:24,634
Not five or ten years, right?
Eternity you.

907
01:25:24,801 --> 01:25:29,681
- Do you realize how long it is?
- I'm starting to feel it.

908
01:25:31,975 --> 01:25:34,435
Now you just see Goody.

909
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:42,402
- For scary.
- Is it scary?

910
01:25:50,118 --> 01:25:53,496
There did you grandfather.

911
