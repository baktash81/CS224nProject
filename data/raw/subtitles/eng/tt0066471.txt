1
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,769
Yes, sir, I'll give Capt. Nolan your message
soon as he returns.

2
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,064
<i>Get him now.</i>

3
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:26,604
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Do you hear me?</i>

4
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:28,071
<i>Get him now!</i>

5
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:32,573
Oh, boy.

6
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:35,847
He's pretty burned up, isn't he?

7
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:38,440
The old man wants to see you, right away.

8
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:40,542
Oh, God, that's all I need.

9
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,780
Good luck.

10
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:44,517
Come in.

11
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:50,987
- Excuse me, sir.
- What's happened?

12
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:53,293
That was Admiral Dawes on the radio, sir.

13
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:56,301
- I mean, it was Admiral Dawes personally.
- So?

14
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:58,530
I told him what you told me, sir...

15
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:01,903
that you weren't in,
and we were still looking for Lt. Lawson.

16
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,341
- And?
- And that didn't seem to satisfy him, sir.

17
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:08,009
It doesn't satisfy me, either.
What about Lawson?

18
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,913
- He's nowhere on the base, sir.
- Look off the base.

19
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,248
Send out the Shore Patrol.
Bring him in, I don't care where he is.

20
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,220
Yes, sir. We've done that, sir.

21
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:19,189
If you've done that,
there's nothing else to tell me, is there?

22
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:20,623
No, sir, nothing else.

23
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:23,389
I just thought you'd like to know
what was going on.

24
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:40,305
Lt. Lawson!

25
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:50,989
If you're heading for the P.X.,
get us some more beer.

26
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:01,426
Anybody seen Lt. Lawson?

27
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:29,221
- Sam, where you going?
- I thought I'd have me a little grub.

28
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:31,854
- Wanna come?
- No, I ate already.

29
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,733
There he is!

30
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:39,929
Lt. Lawson!

31
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:46,073
Capt. Nolan wants to see you right away, sir.

32
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:48,238
- Who, me?
- That's right, Lieutenant.

33
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:50,179
Please, sir. Get in.

34
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,876
Yeah, I'll get in.

35
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:55,318
- What does he wanna see me about?
- I don't know, sir.

36
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,142
See you tonight, girls.
First come, first served.

37
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:25,615
You can draw straws.

38
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:32,281
Here we are, sir.

39
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:36,490
- Keep the meter running, boys.
- Yes, sir.

40
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:47,328
- The old man wanna see me?
- Boy, does he wanna see you.

41
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:54,075
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, John.

42
00:05:54,246 --> 00:05:56,214
What's all the excitement?

43
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:59,115
They said you were looking for me.
Is that right?

44
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:00,652
By the way...

45
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,813
how'd you make out with that funny broad
at the club last night?

46
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:08,356
I was under the impression
that the funny broad was with you.

47
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:12,454
Hell, I brought her, but she really liked you.
That's why I left.

48
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,860
I wouldn't wanna appear ungallant...

49
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:18,870
but I think I'd just as soon
do without your assistance in that direction.

50
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:22,032
That's nice.
I thought I was doing you a favor.

51
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:27,573
Anyway, what's all the panic?
I was just getting ready to eat.

52
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:29,443
I have a job for you.

53
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,644
What, before I go on leave?

54
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:33,708
Yes, before you go on leave.

55
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:36,414
All right, as long as
I'm on that midday plane tomorrow.

56
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:39,457
Very gracious of you,
but it'll take a little longer than that.

57
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,358
Can't, John.
I got a four-weeks' leave coming.

58
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,523
- Later.
- Later nothing.

59
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:48,226
High noon tomorrow, I'm on that plane.
I'm gonna be in Frisco Sunday night.

60
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,700
We're flying you out of here this afternoon.

61
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:53,670
You'll be in the New Hebrides Sunday night.

62
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:56,865
The New Hebrides?

63
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,068
I've your orders here.

64
00:06:58,143 --> 00:07:01,271
You'll report to a British Combat Unit
on one of the islands.

65
00:07:01,347 --> 00:07:03,975
They need someone who speaks Japanese.

66
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:05,716
Combat Unit? What's that?

67
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,288
What the hell is that?

68
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:16,454
First you talk about postponing my leave,
now you're talking about combat?

69
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,691
There are three other officers
in the radio section.

70
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:22,791
Two of them speak better Japanese than me.

71
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:26,099
- They are all a lot older than you.
- That's good, they're mature.

72
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:27,661
But who picked on me?

73
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,937
I did. And it's not a question
of picking on you.

74
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,337
The British are organizing this for us...

75
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,779
and it's gonna involve
a certain amount of physical hardship.

76
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:40,080
We have to supply the man.
In my opinion, you're the man for the job.

77
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:42,279
No, John, negative.

78
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:45,915
Pick Antonelli, he likes all that military crap.
Not me, no.

79
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:47,788
I'm sending you, Lieutenant.

80
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,021
"Lieutenant"?
I'm Sam, don't you remember?

81
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:51,659
Sit down.

82
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,062
- Don't be...
- Sit down, Lieutenant.

83
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:03,102
I have to comply with an instruction
from higher authority.

84
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:04,642
A lot higher.

85
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,647
In order to do that, I'm obliged to make do
with the best possible personnel I have.

86
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:12,309
I know you're a long way
from being right for the job...

87
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:15,353
but only you begin to meet
the physical requirements.

88
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:18,652
Fortunately, they don't appear
to be concerned about much else.

89
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:22,285
So pack your things and report
to the Transportation Officer in 25 minutes.

90
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,488
You mentioned a Combat Unit.

91
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,655
I guess that means a bunch of limeys
running around...

92
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,497
playing soldier, getting shot at, right?

93
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,032
You may not remember this
or you may not be aware of it...

94
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:38,133
but I volunteered for the service
because as a language specialist...

95
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,509
I was gonna get a bar on my shoulder
and be able to sit by a radio...

96
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,413
and eavesdrop on those fiendish Orientals.

97
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:48,785
If they're gonna change those rules...

98
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:51,923
I just might have to resign that commission.

99
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:59,021
That's your privilege.

100
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:00,588
And if I do...

101
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,192
you'll have to send another officer.

102
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:05,795
Right?

103
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:09,068
The order specifies
"Japanese-speaking personnel."

104
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,807
If you resign your commission,
the Navy would be happy to accept it...

105
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:15,244
and send you out there
as a Seaman Second Class.

106
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:18,613
Would you like me to arrange that
for you right now?

107
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:19,979
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

108
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:25,188
- I can't win, can I?
- No, you can't.

109
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:31,254
Incidentally, this operation is something
the British are mounting for our benefit...

110
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,298
so it wouldn't hurt to show them courtesy.

111
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,730
- Courtesy?
- That's right.

112
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,702
You'll get along better if you don't
call them "limeys." That kind of thing.

113
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:41,001
I don't care
whether I get along with them or not.

114
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:44,634
Listen, you miserable bastard,
I'm not interested in your problems.

115
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,339
We lost two PT boats yesterday
not 2 miles from that bay down there.

116
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:52,077
I have to spend the rest of this day
writing to folks back in the States.

117
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:56,053
"Dear Mrs. Smith, a funny thing happened
to your boy last night. He got burnt up."

118
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:59,386
What shall I tell them?
"Too bad your kid couldn't be a bit smarter.

119
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,916
"If he spoke Japanese, we could've
gotten him a job sitting on his ass.

120
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:06,192
"When this mission comes along,
he'd say, 'Not me, buddy.'"

121
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:08,529
Go on, get out of here.
I don't have time for you.

122
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,694
From what I hear, the British
won't have time for your selfish...

123
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,035
I hope they get your goddamn head
shot off for you.

124
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,008
I'm sure we'll get along just fine, sir.

125
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:27,380
They're gonna love him.

126
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,262
Come on, scram!

127
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:53,703
- Toss it up, sir.
- You guys aren't in a hurry, are you?

128
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,055
You know something? I don't think
that clown's happy in the service.

129
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:12,120
Ain't it the living truth.
That bum wouldn't be happy anywhere.

130
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:20,099
Let's go.

131
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:36,080
Okay, back it in.

132
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:40,522
That's it.

133
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,257
A little to the left.

134
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:44,987
Hi.

135
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,898
- Boat's waiting, sir.
- What boat?

136
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,470
There's your boat, Lieutenant.

137
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,143
Thanks a whole lot.

138
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,879
Have a nice trip, Lieutenant.

139
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:27,533
Left, left, left, right, left!

140
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:38,439
Makes me a bloody foolish sight.
That's what.

141
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,148
Right, left! Keep those arms up.

142
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,618
Water's hard enough to come by.

143
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:48,152
Wash out those water barrels!
Get them off my square!

144
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:59,094
Keep those arms free, keep those heads up!

145
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:02,368
Go and get that man in the rear
or I'll keep dragging you all day!

146
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:05,137
Get those water barrels off my square!

147
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:15,110
Okay, bookie's off the course. No more bets.

148
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:19,248
Ready, set, go!

149
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,093
Connolly.

150
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:26,255
Your bleeding horse
is being left at the post.

151
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:29,789
That's not fair, Tosh!

152
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:31,199
Why not?

153
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,704
My jockey's only using his whip, ain't he?

154
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,138
If your bloke
doesn't wake his bloody ideas up...

155
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,369
you're gonna owe me two packets of fags.

156
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,808
He's right, Connolly.

157
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:42,369
Even you can run faster than that pig.

158
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,381
All the same, it isn't fair.

159
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,646
Away and pick your nose,
you mooning Mary!

160
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,187
But it isn't fair, Campbell. Look at that!

161
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:52,917
Objection! Steward's inquiry!

162
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,922
Gentlemen, objection sustained!
This bloody horse has been doped.

163
00:13:57,996 --> 00:14:00,226
What the hell do you think
you're playing at?

164
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,599
Don't argue with the steward, laddie.
I've a mind to report you to the Jockey Club.

165
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,230
Leave him be.
I think his brains have come loose.

166
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,967
Yeah, you better watch it, Thornton.

167
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,009
All right, let's have you!

168
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:12,634
Cpl. McLean, get those men fell in.

169
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:14,542
Scott, right marker here.

170
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:16,911
One straight line, come on.

171
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,808
- Corporal.
- Sir.

172
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:23,612
Away and find Pvts. Rogers,
Currie, Rafferty, and Pvt. Riddle.

173
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,554
What's up then, Sarge?

174
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,686
Nothing to worry you.

175
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,659
- Good morning, sir!
- Howdy.

176
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:35,130
Commanding Officer apologizes.
He would have greeted you personally.

177
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,658
- It's okay.
- He's just come back from a reconnaissance.

178
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:42,398
Col. Thompson is waiting, sir.
If you'll come with me.

179
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,703
- Lf you'll come with me, sir.
- Right.

180
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:51,506
I'm excused duties, Sergeant.

181
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,073
Is that right?

182
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,686
Listen, laddie, we've had your stripes.

183
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,522
You make it necessary,
and I will personally crucify you.

184
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:10,460
You're on that list
because I put you there myself.

185
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,129
If you want a personal interview,
you can have it.

186
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:16,766
And you'll likely find yourself
facing a court-martial...

187
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:19,333
for self-inflicted wounds.

188
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:22,670
Do you hear me all right, laddie?

189
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:26,006
Yes, Sergeant.

190
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:32,556
Tosh, what's that then?

191
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,993
It's a bleeding Yank, isn't it?

192
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,393
No, Connolly, that's not a Yank.

193
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,291
That's Snow White.

194
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,859
And very pretty she is, too.

195
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:44,896
All right!

196
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,228
You've got bugger all to laugh about.

197
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:48,966
- You there, Hearne!
- Sir.

198
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,167
You're supposed to be
standing to attention!

199
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,068
This way, sir!

200
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,589
Col. Thompson will join you
in a moment, sir.

201
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,485
All right, attention!

202
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:11,656
Fall in!

203
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:15,356
One, two, three, four...

204
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,096
Good afternoon, Lieutenant.

205
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,898
Welcome to the New Hebrides.

206
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,339
Lt. J.G. Sam Lawson reporting...

207
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:26,475
as ordered.

208
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:32,683
I think we can let the Sergeant Major
deal with those.

209
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:41,317
Yes, rather an imaginative location
for a military headquarters, don't you think?

210
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:42,485
Yeah.

211
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:46,726
I sometimes wonder what kind of an artist
Gauguin would've become...

212
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:50,859
if he'd had the misfortune
to choose this place instead of Tahiti.

213
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,533
Yes, I think there would have been
a certain lack of inspiration.

214
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:58,269
Mind you, I don't know
what the natives were like here...

215
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:00,334
but there are none anymore.

216
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:04,576
I'm sure he would've found the current crop
of inhabitants singularly unappealing.

217
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,218
This part up here is all Japanese.
Not at all jolly.

218
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,755
And down here, we have our own group...

219
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:17,625
which I imagine he would've found
only marginally more agreeable.

220
00:17:17,696 --> 00:17:22,156
Now, what we really have is the remainder
of a Brigade HQ Company...

221
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:24,532
consisting largely
of chaps from my regiment...

222
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:28,767
brought up to strength by
a rather bizarre variety of odds and sods...

223
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,241
who joined us
when we scrambled out of Singapore.

224
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:37,779
A lot of them were just as anxious to escape
the Army as they were the Japanese.

225
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:42,449
But I've no doubt
your chaps have told you about all this.

226
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:46,388
No, sir, my chaps didn't tell me anything.

227
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:51,861
Recently, though, the casualty rates
have been alarmingly high.

228
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:56,063
However, I'm afraid this little jaunt
we've organized now...

229
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:58,932
is going to change all that
because, amongst other things...

230
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:03,236
it's going to make it necessary for us
to penetrate all the way to their main base.

231
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:05,606
Sounds great. When do you leave?

232
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:07,440
As soon as we've briefed the men.

233
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:10,504
You'll be leaving
in about half an hour or so.

234
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:12,378
I'll be leaving in half an hour?

235
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,443
It doesn't do to let the men
brood about these things, you know.

236
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:18,483
Come in.

237
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:22,459
I believe you sent for me, sir.

238
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:25,963
Yes, Freddie. I wanted to have a chat
with you before I talk to the men.

239
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:28,261
- How are you feeling?
- First rate.

240
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,530
Good. Freddie's been on the sick list
the last few days.

241
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:33,798
I'm so sorry, I don't think you have met yet.

242
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:36,898
This is Lt. Lawson
of the United States Navy.

243
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:40,502
Lt. Lawson, this is Capt. Hornsby,
who'll be leading this patrol.

244
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,479
How do you do?
Glad you'll be coming along.

245
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,344
That makes one of us.

246
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,748
I guess this trip's unavoidable.

247
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,877
I shall be briefing the men in a few minutes.
Perhaps you'd like to get changed?

248
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:53,720
I take it you did bring some other gear?

249
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:57,253
This is all I got. What kind of gear?

250
00:18:57,362 --> 00:19:00,229
It doesn't have to be
anything terribly formal.

251
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:02,129
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!

252
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,236
Take the Lieutenant down to the stores...

253
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:11,867
and help him sort out something
appropriate for the occasion, would you?

254
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:12,967
Sir.

255
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:15,877
I'm afraid our laundry service
is a little bit primitive.

256
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,348
We've been reduced to using seawater
for everything but drinking...

257
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:23,148
so don't be alarmed if the kit you get
is a little bit manky.

258
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:24,410
"Manky"?

259
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,714
How's the grub?

260
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:29,322
It's a little bit manky, too.

261
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:31,384
See you later.

262
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:34,290
If you'll come with me, sir?

263
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,804
- You did say half an hour?
- Yes.

264
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:48,141
Yeah, I thought you said that.

265
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:54,308
What an extraordinary fellow.

266
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:56,914
He is an American.

267
00:19:57,522 --> 00:20:01,390
Yes, but he does actually speak Japanese,
does he?

268
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:05,122
He says so, and I certainly
don't feel qualified to put him to the test.

269
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,830
You wanted to talk to me, sir?

270
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:15,263
- You said...
- Yes, of course. It's nothing really.

271
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,501
I wanted to be sure you feel up to it.

272
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:18,599
Good heavens, yes.

273
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:22,704
I mean, if you don't feel entirely fit yet,
I can equally send O'Neill.

274
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:25,215
No, sir, I'm fine.

275
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:29,085
Anyway, it seems to me
to be a marvelous opportunity...

276
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:31,247
to really hurt them, for a change.

277
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:34,814
Yes. Let's hope
they're not entertaining similar ambitions.

278
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:37,055
Stand to!

279
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:39,957
What the hell's that?

280
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,896
All guns and crews!

281
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:49,700
All guns stand to!

282
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:12,559
All guns commence fire!

283
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:18,093
Keep the men out of range
of the enemy, Captain.

284
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:21,237
You men, keep back. Stay in the safety zone.

285
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,901
Keep back in the safety zone.

286
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:27,569
Trevor's patrol?

287
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:33,640
Make sure they don't hit our lads!

288
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:49,261
They'll never make it.

289
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,932
Fire!

290
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:08,546
They'll be out of enemy rifle range soon, sir.

291
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,177
Are they out of range yet, sir?

292
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,250
They're out of range now, sir.

293
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:47,957
Keep your guns at ready.

294
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:50,256
Keep your eyes on that jungle.

295
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:56,896
Bloody mess.

296
00:22:57,902 --> 00:22:59,699
Terrible bloody mess.

297
00:23:02,807 --> 00:23:04,434
Medical Orderly!

298
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:06,370
Stretcher bearers!

299
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:08,973
<i>A week from today...</i>

300
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:13,279
the American Navy proposes
sending a convoy up through these straits.

301
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:17,185
We know that the Japanese
have no air reconnaissance in this area...

302
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:20,952
so barring any unfortunate encounters
with surface craft...

303
00:23:21,593 --> 00:23:25,393
the Americans' presence in these waters
should remain undetected.

304
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,160
Undetected, that is, until...

305
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,833
early on Thursday morning...

306
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:33,803
when they will come within sight
of the Japanese coast up here.

307
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:36,669
In the normal course of events...

308
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:39,039
the Japanese
would communicate this information...

309
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,635
to their air and naval forces up here.

310
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:45,979
And within 24 hours, this convoy
would be pretty much at their mercy.

311
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,014
Is that clear so far?

312
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:49,178
Yes, sir.

313
00:23:49,254 --> 00:23:50,448
Hearne!

314
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,482
Tosh.

315
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,090
- What?
- Him.

316
00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:03,096
The movements and major policy decisions
of the United States Navy...

317
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,759
may be of limited interest to you...

318
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:07,669
but if you will bear with me
for just a moment or two...

319
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:12,005
I think you will find that it may be
worth your while to pay some attention.

320
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,067
- I am, sir.
- Good.

321
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,615
The object of our own operation
is simply to prevent news...

322
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:27,021
of the Americans' presence in these waters
from reaching the enemy's main base.

323
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:31,461
The Japanese transmit situation reports...

324
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:35,863
to their bases at Rabaul and Truk
on Wednesdays and Sundays.

325
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:40,033
If we were to destroy their radio...

326
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:43,403
before the transmission
on Wednesday night...

327
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:46,238
that is to say
before the convoy comes within sight...

328
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:47,972
of their coast here...

329
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:52,280
we should know that at least that part
of the mission had been successful.

330
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,116
This is where Lt. Lawson
of the United States Navy comes in.

331
00:24:57,488 --> 00:25:00,616
Immediately prior
to Wednesday night's transmission...

332
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:03,752
you will destroy the Japanese radio.

333
00:25:06,164 --> 00:25:09,133
Lt. Lawson will use
our own radio equipment...

334
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,466
to transmit the normal,
routine situation report in Japanese.

335
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,304
- Sir?
- Yes, Hearne, what is it?

336
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,371
Would the mission have to be abandoned...

337
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:25,348
if Lt. Lawson met with...

338
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,648
an unfortunate mishap?

339
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:32,947
Mishap?

340
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:35,783
Yes, I take your point...

341
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,796
but I think it's a little premature
to talk about abandoning the operation...

342
00:25:39,864 --> 00:25:43,095
or of any mishap to the Lieutenant,
for that matter.

343
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,068
- Yes, sir.
- I hope your enthusiasm isn't catching.

344
00:25:46,137 --> 00:25:47,604
I hope so, too, sir.

345
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,435
However, if it answers your question...

346
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:52,840
Lt. Lawson's part in this operation
is not, in fact, essential.

347
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,970
It is merely a way of gaining additional time.

348
00:25:56,347 --> 00:26:00,181
Lf, for any reason, he should be unable
to transmit the message...

349
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:04,915
we shall still be doing a very considerable
service by destroying the Japanese radio.

350
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:06,281
Yes, sir.

351
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:11,090
We've never attempted to penetrate
this far into Japanese territory...

352
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:13,062
Bloody suicide mission.

353
00:26:13,498 --> 00:26:14,795
Campbell.

354
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:17,591
Now's the time to shoot your other arm.

355
00:26:17,668 --> 00:26:19,158
Knock it off.

356
00:26:27,011 --> 00:26:30,640
Captain, I was wondering how come
Trevor didn't come that way or that way...

357
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,342
instead of down the middle like that?

358
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,317
- Mines, old boy.
- Mines?

359
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:37,650
Yeah. If the Japs ever sent
a sizeable force against us...

360
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:41,055
that bit of jungle over there
would be too close for comfort.

361
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,423
So we laid a mine field there...

362
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:46,691
and it worked a treat for a while
because it kept them out...

363
00:26:46,764 --> 00:26:49,892
and our patrols could come and go
as they pleased.

364
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:53,425
Then one night
the Japs laid a few mine fields of their own.

365
00:26:53,504 --> 00:26:56,439
It cost us seven men
before we discovered it.

366
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:59,869
Isn't there any other way out
of this target range?

367
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:02,777
Not if you're traveling north, Lieutenant.

368
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:07,008
I don't like to seem unduly cautious,
but wouldn't it be better if we left at night?

369
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,576
I'm sure the men
would be the first to agree with you.

370
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:11,417
- Wouldn't that make more sense?
- Indeed.

371
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:14,151
But if we're to reach the enemy camp
by Wednesday night...

372
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:16,785
we have what you might call
a rather tight schedule.

373
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:18,795
We had intended leaving last night...

374
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:23,095
but unfortunately, your people
were somewhat late in delivering the body.

375
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,635
You mean the whole operation's
been hanging on me?

376
00:27:25,703 --> 00:27:27,170
I'm afraid so.

377
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:30,765
I'm sorry about being late, Captain,
but I wasn't driving that damn boat.

378
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:32,833
Patrol, attention!

379
00:27:34,378 --> 00:27:36,278
- Carry on, please.
- Sir.

380
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,610
Sgt. Johnstone, stand the men at ease.

381
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:40,207
Stand at ease!

382
00:27:41,185 --> 00:27:42,277
Easy.

383
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,944
Pay attention.

384
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:47,616
If we can get across that open ground
without attracting the enemy fire...

385
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:51,287
we can take it that the patrol encountered
by Trevor's men has withdrawn...

386
00:27:51,362 --> 00:27:55,321
and we should be reasonably safe
until we've penetrated into the jungle.

387
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:57,333
Sgt. Johnstone and I will lead off.

388
00:27:57,401 --> 00:28:00,063
The rest of you
will break up into three groups of four...

389
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:03,232
which Lt. Lawson here will dispatch
at intervals of 25 seconds.

390
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,002
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

391
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:06,168
Cpl. McLean...

392
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:09,805
you and Signalman Scott will remain
in the rear group with the Lieutenant.

393
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:12,179
Hearne, the same applies to you.

394
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,741
As Medical Orderly,
you will be in the last group.

395
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,980
If there are any casualties on the way over...

396
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:19,045
you will not stop to render aid to anyone...

397
00:28:19,123 --> 00:28:21,819
unless they are injured
within 200 yards of cover.

398
00:28:21,893 --> 00:28:24,418
- Is that clear, Hearne?
- That's clear, sir.

399
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,622
Sgt. Johnstone,
prepare to move the men off.

400
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:27,755
Sir!

401
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,561
All right, get moving.
Over to the weapon pits.

402
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:36,372
- You hear that, Connolly?
- Move along.

403
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,102
Don't get yourself shot
till you get to the other side.

404
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:40,439
Why not?

405
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:47,183
Because Uncle Tosh won't be able
to look after you, that's why not.

406
00:28:47,418 --> 00:28:48,851
All gun pits, stand to.

407
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,888
Come on, let's hurry up.

408
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:52,784
Give me three ranks!

409
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,119
Front rank:

410
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,922
Riddle, Thornton, Griffiths, Currie!

411
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,257
Center rank:

412
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,958
Rafferty, Rogers, Connolly, Campbell!

413
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,031
Rear rank:

414
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:08,094
Lt. Lawson, Hearne, Cpl. McLean, Scott!

415
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:12,665
Captain, what about the four guys
they left out there?

416
00:29:14,312 --> 00:29:16,337
If we get across safely...

417
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:19,138
I imagine they'll pick them up now.

418
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:21,276
And if we don't?

419
00:29:24,855 --> 00:29:27,653
I suppose they'll pick us all up tonight.

420
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,716
- Sergeant.
- Sir?

421
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,623
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

422
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:32,856
Right.

423
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:35,162
Off we go.

424
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,427
Twenty-five, twenty-four...

425
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:40,962
twenty-three, twenty-two...

426
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:43,165
Get yourself out of here...

427
00:29:43,441 --> 00:29:45,841
before you go, I've news for you,
you're on a charge.

428
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,040
A charge for appearing on guard duty
with your boot laces undone.

429
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:53,208
...seven, six, five...

430
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:55,518
You'll be on the Hebrides line-up.

431
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:56,746
...one, all right, go.

432
00:29:56,821 --> 00:30:00,587
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You better go in disguise</i>

433
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:04,150
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You're in for a big surprise</i>

434
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:05,490
Shut up!

435
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:09,093
Stupid idiot.

436
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:11,066
Thornton, what's the matter with you?

437
00:30:11,135 --> 00:30:13,729
My head's sore. I'm fair daffy.

438
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:18,434
I don't think that guy's playing
with a full deck.

439
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:20,101
What do you say, sir?

440
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:22,839
I think he's lost some of his marbles.

441
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:25,848
- What marbles are they, sir?
- Cuckoo.

442
00:30:27,018 --> 00:30:30,283
- Cuckoo?
...twenty-four, twenty-three...

443
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:34,621
They wouldn't let him in the army
if he was cuckoo, would they, sir?

444
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:38,427
No, he's all right, old Thornton.

445
00:30:38,863 --> 00:30:42,299
He's seen more soldiering
than you've had hot dinners.

446
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,157
He's all right.

447
00:30:45,603 --> 00:30:48,697
Unless, of course,
he goes right off his rocker.

448
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:52,235
...seven, six...

449
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:54,574
Doesn't happen often.

450
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:58,743
...five, four...
- He's all right.

451
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,314
...three, two, one. Let's go.

452
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,046
Twenty-five, twenty-four...

453
00:31:06,924 --> 00:31:08,516
twenty-three...

454
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:13,552
Don't walk in a straight line, you clowns.
Scatter, move to the left.

455
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:16,156
Come on, spread out. Use your heads.

456
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:18,796
That's great, sir.

457
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,432
The Lieutenant's obviously
done this before.

458
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:27,170
You don't have to be the Duke of Wellington
to know you don't walk in a straight line.

459
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:29,474
That's absolutely right, sir.

460
00:31:29,547 --> 00:31:30,912
He's right.

461
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:34,484
...seven, six, five...

462
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:37,516
four, three, two...

463
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:39,419
He's right, you know.

464
00:31:39,757 --> 00:31:41,588
...one. Come on.

465
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:49,552
All right, you men, back to work.

466
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:06,909
Spotted a relative, Campbell?

467
00:33:06,977 --> 00:33:09,571
Up your pipe, you Cockney ponce.

468
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:10,909
Be quiet!

469
00:33:26,096 --> 00:33:28,257
It's marvelous, this country living.

470
00:33:28,332 --> 00:33:29,594
For pigs.

471
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:35,995
Look at my hands.
They look like chopped beef.

472
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:40,402
Excuse me, sir, is there something wrong
with your teeth?

473
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:42,972
We call it personal hygiene.

474
00:33:43,447 --> 00:33:45,642
You ought to try it sometime.

475
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:48,581
You hear that, lads?

476
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,849
He reckons you're all a bunch of pigs.
Cheeky bastard.

477
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:54,618
May I have a light, please, Lieutenant?

478
00:33:54,892 --> 00:33:56,018
Here.

479
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,786
Those two are getting pretty matey,
aren't they?

480
00:33:59,864 --> 00:34:01,092
Why not?

481
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:04,224
Like you're always saying,
it's a matter of class.

482
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:05,666
I don't know about Snow White...

483
00:34:05,736 --> 00:34:09,570
but old Hornsby's got about as much class
as a syphilitic road sweeper.

484
00:34:11,308 --> 00:34:13,606
I really love this time of day.

485
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:17,545
- It always reminds me...
- It doesn't do much for me, I'll tell you.

486
00:34:17,615 --> 00:34:20,311
I can see you're a confirmed city dweller.

487
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:22,318
My people farm, you know.

488
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:26,186
- We have this little estate in the Cotswolds.
- Is that right?

489
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:33,488
- Sgt. Johnstone.
- Sir?

490
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:35,498
- It's about time we moved off.
- Yes, sir.

491
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:38,626
Let's have Riddle out in front.

492
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,067
All right, Riddle, up front.

493
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:42,833
Why me again? I was back marker yesterday.

494
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:44,431
Keep it down, you chaps.

495
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:48,308
Because you're so bloody lovely, that's why.
Now don't argue! Get up front!

496
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:51,542
- Connolly, you kick off as back marker.
- Who, me, sir?

497
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:53,139
All right, sir.

498
00:34:53,984 --> 00:34:56,885
Hang on here
until we've been gone a full minute.

499
00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:59,616
Jap patrol, sir. Coming right down the path.

500
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,681
- Five of them, this way.
- Did they see you?

501
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:02,817
I don't think so.

502
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:06,056
Off the path, both sides.
Don't fire unless I do!

503
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,257
Captain, your field pack!

504
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:21,735
We did it!

505
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:25,002
Rogers, get your bloody head down!

506
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:27,602
Keep down, you bloody fool.

507
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,921
Rafferty! Rogers! Kill all those men!

508
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:48,691
Griffiths! Thornton! Pick up the rifles!

509
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:51,064
Come on, don't leave a trace.

510
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:55,828
You heard the orders. Get a move on.

511
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:57,806
Don't leave a trace. I said off the trail.

512
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,502
Tosh, over here.

513
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,640
Come on, clean it up.

514
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:04,872
That's right. Get it out of the way.

515
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:07,410
- Take him up that way.
- Tosh, hurry up!

516
00:37:07,484 --> 00:37:10,180
Over in the undergrowth. That's right.

517
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:19,724
You'll be all right, Connolly.

518
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:24,257
Riddle, get off down the trail
and keep cover.

519
00:37:25,836 --> 00:37:28,304
- Come on, Riddle, double up!
- Get them off the trail.

520
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:31,205
- I think Riddle's bought it.
- Damn.

521
00:37:31,742 --> 00:37:34,540
Campbell, you get on up there.
If you see any more coming...

522
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:37,079
fire a warning shot
and get back here on the double.

523
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:39,342
- Yes, sir.
- Move it, Campbell!

524
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,952
Trying to work his ticket.

525
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:45,784
It's what you're doing, ain't you?

526
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:48,688
Trying to work your ticket, son?

527
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:51,284
- Hearne.
- What do you want, sir?

528
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:54,226
What about these two?

529
00:37:54,498 --> 00:37:58,491
Bloody idiot. Put your hand on there
and keep the pressure, all right?

530
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:08,110
This one's got about five minutes.

531
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:20,248
This one will be all right
if we get him back to camp.

532
00:38:20,324 --> 00:38:23,350
But we're not going in that direction,
are we?

533
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:30,995
No, sir.

534
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:59,493
All right, Sergeant...

535
00:38:59,997 --> 00:39:02,329
do we have any other casualties?

536
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,327
The Yank says Pvt. Riddle's dead, sir.

537
00:39:05,402 --> 00:39:07,700
- Is that all?
- No, it's not all.

538
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:09,634
Currie and Connolly.

539
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,140
- Both dead?
- No.

540
00:39:12,376 --> 00:39:15,243
What the hell do you mean, idiot?
Can't you speak plainly?

541
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:16,836
Currie's dead!

542
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:19,677
Connolly's wounded.

543
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:24,310
Right, Sergeant, get these Japanese bodies
off the trail, please.

544
00:39:24,454 --> 00:39:27,617
You heard. Get these bodies off the trail.
Come on, move!

545
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:29,818
And erase those bloodstains.

546
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,286
Never you mind.
Hearne's taking good care of you.

547
00:39:33,363 --> 00:39:34,887
Come on, Rogers, get a move on.

548
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:37,798
I hear you're something
of a footballer, Connolly.

549
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:39,768
Before you know it, you'll be back home...

550
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:42,271
playing for the regiment, perhaps.

551
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,804
I don't know whether I ever...

552
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:48,941
You shouldn't have given up
smoking, Connolly.

553
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:51,173
You could've had a drag now.

554
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:55,945
Get those helmets.

555
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:09,097
I got his leg.
Take him up that way, towards the right.

556
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:11,724
Scott, give us a hand.

557
00:40:12,936 --> 00:40:15,769
- Don't take all day, man.
- Yes, sir.

558
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,398
The helmet, you damn fool!

559
00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:23,709
That pretty well cleans it up, sir.

560
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,613
It's been a great day at Hampden Park, folks.

561
00:40:26,683 --> 00:40:28,651
Hornsby's Hotspurs: 5...

562
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,051
Japanese United: 3.

563
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:34,421
All eight of them scored by Hornsby.

564
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,492
What's he mean, all eight of them?

565
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:39,524
He means that Fairy Feet Hornsby...

566
00:40:39,596 --> 00:40:43,032
deployed his forces
with such a masterly grasp of tactics...

567
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,001
half of us got ourselves shot
by the other bloody half.

568
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,696
No, it can't be.

569
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:50,296
Can't be? Go and dig the bullets out.

570
00:40:50,507 --> 00:40:53,169
You won't find "Made in Japan"
written on them.

571
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,905
All right, Sergeant, let's be on our way.

572
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:57,310
Come on, men.

573
00:40:58,282 --> 00:40:59,579
Rafferty.

574
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,074
Back marker.

575
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:03,415
<i>Let's have a bloody good cry
And always remember</i>

576
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:04,647
Come on, move it.

577
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:06,348
<i>The longer you live</i>

578
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:09,859
<i>The sooner you'll bloody well die</i>

579
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:12,492
<i>Look at the mourners</i>

580
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,030
<i>Bloody great hypocrites</i>

581
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,834
<i>Isn't it grand, boys</i>

582
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,601
Don't you know any other songs?

583
00:41:21,672 --> 00:41:23,139
Aye, a few...

584
00:41:23,206 --> 00:41:26,733
but at the moment, I happen
to be particularly fond of this one.

585
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,801
I wish you'd sing us one you hate.

586
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:32,610
Campbell, has it ever occurred to you
that if you had the other arm broken...

587
00:41:32,683 --> 00:41:35,618
you'd be needing a friend
to button your fly?

588
00:42:12,422 --> 00:42:15,687
Capt. Hornsby! Over here! Japs!

589
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:17,084
Where are you?

590
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,924
We're coming after you,
you bloody little ape!

591
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:22,932
Come on, Captain,
the bastard's getting away!

592
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,201
Get your blinking face here,
or we'll all be done for!

593
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:27,429
Hearne!

594
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:31,039
Come on, show yourself!

595
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:35,734
Two of them coming down there,
a lieutenant and a corporal.

596
00:42:35,812 --> 00:42:39,009
I got the corporal. I winged
the other one, too. Could be dead now.

597
00:42:39,082 --> 00:42:40,913
- Where did he go?
- Disappeared in there.

598
00:42:40,984 --> 00:42:42,611
Hearne, see what you can do for him.

599
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:45,018
Corporal, take some men
and start combing the area.

600
00:42:45,088 --> 00:42:48,785
- Four of you on the double.
- He's got to be in the jungle somewhere.

601
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:52,254
Campbell, you and Scott
take a look from this tower.

602
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:54,422
See if you can spot anything from up there.

603
00:42:54,498 --> 00:42:56,830
Lieutenant, you better come with me.

604
00:42:59,002 --> 00:43:01,493
- Come on.
- I can't go up there.

605
00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:04,864
- You and your bloody arm.
- Go on, get on with it.

606
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,169
It's a bloody mile high.

607
00:43:44,147 --> 00:43:46,012
What's up there, then?

608
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,246
Just some things
for measuring the weather or something.

609
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,310
It's like the stuff we've got back at camp.

610
00:43:51,388 --> 00:43:52,616
Damn you, Hearne!

611
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:54,657
Shall I bring them down?

612
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:56,349
No, leave them.

613
00:43:56,927 --> 00:44:00,624
If Hornsby sees them, he'll have us
lugging them all the way back to base.

614
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:03,862
Don't worry, Thorny.

615
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,228
Snakes love Japs.

616
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,895
You'll have to go to Woolworth's
and buy one, I think.

617
00:44:12,175 --> 00:44:14,405
We're never gonna find him in this.

618
00:44:14,478 --> 00:44:16,002
Let's get back.

619
00:44:19,649 --> 00:44:22,812
It seems your friend
is on his way back to Tokyo.

620
00:44:24,387 --> 00:44:25,877
- Hearne.
- What?

621
00:44:26,256 --> 00:44:27,723
How about it?

622
00:44:28,725 --> 00:44:30,590
- Can he walk?
- No, sir.

623
00:44:30,994 --> 00:44:33,258
- But, surely...
- No.

624
00:44:40,403 --> 00:44:42,997
Right, give him a hand. Come on, now.

625
00:44:43,073 --> 00:44:44,301
What's the matter with you?

626
00:44:44,374 --> 00:44:46,842
Can't you see that I can't put my foot down?

627
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:49,912
There's hundreds of these trails.

628
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,813
How're we ever gonna find him again
on our way back?

629
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:54,077
It's easy.

630
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:57,120
We're gonna scatter little white pebbles
through the forest...

631
00:44:57,187 --> 00:44:59,678
just like bloody Hansel and Gretel.

632
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:01,687
Carry on, Gunga Din.

633
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:04,160
This thing weighs a ton.

634
00:45:06,129 --> 00:45:08,120
Ease him down over there.

635
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:11,892
Sorry we couldn't have
the Rolls Royce for you.

636
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:22,175
Just thought you might need this.

637
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:24,370
Thank you, sir.

638
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,683
Good luck, Sergeant.

639
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,880
- Corporal.
- Sir?

640
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,359
There. Okay?

641
00:45:38,929 --> 00:45:40,191
All done.

642
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,359
- Here.
- What's this, then?

643
00:45:45,602 --> 00:45:48,093
- Salt tablets.
- I'd rather have a smoke.

644
00:45:48,171 --> 00:45:49,832
- You short, then?
- Skint.

645
00:45:49,906 --> 00:45:51,874
Hearne, we've got to go.

646
00:45:52,742 --> 00:45:54,869
I'll see you Saturday, okay?

647
00:45:56,179 --> 00:45:58,306
Yeah. Thanks.

648
00:45:58,682 --> 00:46:00,582
Not for the cigarettes though.

649
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,084
You owe me them.
Don't you bloody forget it.

650
00:46:03,153 --> 00:46:04,381
I won't.

651
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:10,225
And don't forget to loosen the tourniquet,
otherwise your bloody leg will drop off.

652
00:46:11,027 --> 00:46:12,255
See you.

653
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:19,158
Enjoy your rest, Sergeant.

654
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:15,019
I reckon that makes you a Sergeant, Jock.

655
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:22,992
- Down there?
- Yes, sir.

656
00:47:23,066 --> 00:47:25,933
All right. Hearne, Campbell, come with me.

657
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,268
Well, move yourself, Campbell.

658
00:47:34,044 --> 00:47:36,444
I knew that little Nip had to be in there.

659
00:49:43,973 --> 00:49:45,133
What?

660
00:49:45,642 --> 00:49:47,542
- Cover me.
- All right.

661
00:50:06,362 --> 00:50:08,796
<i>They've gone. Let's move on.</i>

662
00:50:11,267 --> 00:50:14,668
<i>Did you hear me? There's no one here.
Let's move on.</i>

663
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,404
Look out!

664
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:46,761
It's not every day you get a chance
to kill an officer, is it, Lieutenant?

665
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,196
All he had was this knife.

666
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:53,173
What did you want me to do?
Wait till he threw it at you?

667
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:54,267
No.

668
00:50:54,944 --> 00:50:57,208
No! It's me, Campbell!

669
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,539
What the hell do you want?

670
00:50:59,782 --> 00:51:01,807
You asked for these, sir.

671
00:51:01,918 --> 00:51:05,513
You idiot. You could've got yourself killed,
running up like that.

672
00:51:05,588 --> 00:51:07,749
Come on, let's get moving.

673
00:51:08,057 --> 00:51:09,319
Let's go.

674
00:51:11,895 --> 00:51:15,626
Where are you off to?
You're still back marker, remember?

675
00:52:46,356 --> 00:52:49,519
Bugger off, you Yank bastard.
I hope you bloody crash!

676
00:52:49,592 --> 00:52:52,561
- How do you know it's a Yank, kid?
- You can smell them.

677
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:55,564
I thought all you limeys could smell
was our money.

678
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:05,536
Hearne, Lieutenant, Cpl. McLean,
come with me.

679
00:53:07,076 --> 00:53:09,067
Keep them here a moment.

680
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:11,507
Rogers.

681
00:53:17,754 --> 00:53:19,051
Can you see him?

682
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,387
Where the hell is he?

683
00:53:23,092 --> 00:53:25,720
You might say he's all around here.

684
00:53:28,464 --> 00:53:32,366
As a matter of fact,
you might even say he's got us surrounded.

685
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:38,331
That's right, Lieutenant. The bloody Yanks
are bombing us with old Army boots.

686
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:40,272
Land mine.

687
00:53:41,944 --> 00:53:44,071
The damn fool should've known better.

688
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:10,802
Here, look at this.

689
00:54:12,308 --> 00:54:15,368
It's a Chinese railway station, crabs and all.

690
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,072
Thornton, away in and find out
what time is the next train to Glasgow.

691
00:54:22,452 --> 00:54:24,010
"Next train to Glasgow."

692
00:54:24,087 --> 00:54:26,078
What's going on up there?

693
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:31,322
For God's sake, keep quiet. Keep moving!

694
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:34,295
Corporal, send in two men
to see if there's anyone in there.

695
00:54:34,363 --> 00:54:36,558
Thornton, over there on the left.

696
00:54:36,632 --> 00:54:39,066
Rafferty, over there on the right.

697
00:54:39,135 --> 00:54:42,866
They kind of move sideways.
Must be Oriental crabs.

698
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:45,470
Lieutenant, will you join me?

699
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:47,771
They'll ruin your married life, won't they?

700
00:54:47,844 --> 00:54:51,974
Here, give them a peck, Campbell.
A man ought to be close to his family.

701
00:54:52,048 --> 00:54:53,106
Shut your trap.

702
00:54:53,182 --> 00:54:56,618
All clear on the ground floor, sir.
Rafferty's up top.

703
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,049
Keep them things away from me.

704
00:54:59,122 --> 00:55:01,556
Campbell, get rid of the crabs.

705
00:55:06,362 --> 00:55:08,592
Why me, you dafty queer?

706
00:55:11,634 --> 00:55:14,569
- That kid that got it back there...
- Rogers?

707
00:55:15,805 --> 00:55:17,272
Yeah, Rogers.

708
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:21,738
Do you think he ever had time
to get himself laid?

709
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:25,977
Couldn't tell you.
Not my department really, is it?

710
00:55:26,816 --> 00:55:29,808
I may be screwed up in a lot of ways...

711
00:55:32,522 --> 00:55:36,049
but getting killed like one of these poor kids
isn't gonna be one of them.

712
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:38,093
That's what you say now.

713
00:55:38,161 --> 00:55:42,393
But I'm sure when it comes to the point,
you'll be one of the first over the top.

714
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,258
Over the top?

715
00:55:46,335 --> 00:55:49,304
I mean, you'll turn out to be a real fire-eater.

716
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:51,162
You wanna bet?

717
00:55:51,808 --> 00:55:53,969
I'll give you 8-to-5.

718
00:55:56,279 --> 00:55:58,144
And loan you the money.

719
00:56:04,053 --> 00:56:06,544
You never get rid of those
with blue ointment, kids?

720
00:56:09,258 --> 00:56:11,590
Time to relieve Griffiths, mate.

721
00:56:14,363 --> 00:56:17,355
It's your sentry go. Griffiths, back there.

722
00:56:30,446 --> 00:56:32,744
Takes a bloody bomb to wake him up.

723
00:56:32,815 --> 00:56:34,680
An earthquake's more like it.

724
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,809
Here, Tosh, give us a light.

725
00:56:49,565 --> 00:56:51,692
What the hell are you doing?

726
00:56:51,767 --> 00:56:54,395
- Where'd you get these cigarettes?
- What's that to you?

727
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,439
- You stole them from Johnno, didn't you?
- Don't be bloody daft!

728
00:56:57,506 --> 00:56:59,531
Where'd the blood come from then?

729
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:01,406
You did, you bastard, you stole them!

730
00:57:01,477 --> 00:57:03,741
He's got no use for them now.
What's the matter?

731
00:57:03,813 --> 00:57:06,145
- They're mine, that's what!
- Piss off!

732
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:08,649
- Don't "piss off!" me!
- Campbell, stop it.

733
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:10,948
Get out, Tosh! That's it. Out!

734
00:57:16,092 --> 00:57:18,060
Cut it out, Tosh.

735
00:57:18,127 --> 00:57:20,322
What's the meaning
of this disgusting exhibition?

736
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:21,886
I'll kill him!

737
00:57:29,772 --> 00:57:34,436
He kicked me, sir. It's my arm, sir.
He kicked my arm.

738
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:38,109
Kick his arm?
I'll jam it down his bloody throat!

739
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,341
I gave Sgt. Johnstone these cigarettes.

740
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:43,214
Shut up, Hearne. Nobody's talking to you.

741
00:57:46,455 --> 00:57:49,788
- I'm bloody well talking to you, aren't I?
- What did you say?

742
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:52,123
I said that he stole these cigarettes...

743
00:57:52,194 --> 00:57:54,628
I'm not interested
in your grubby little cigarettes.

744
00:57:54,697 --> 00:57:56,324
You bloody well should be!

745
00:57:56,399 --> 00:57:59,960
Cpl. McLean, put this man on a charge.
Let's have no more of this nonsense.

746
00:58:02,905 --> 00:58:05,840
Where does he think he is,
bloody Aldershot?

747
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:17,252
Hearne, it seems
you're not going to be satisfied...

748
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:20,266
until you've talked yourself
into some really serious trouble.

749
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:22,996
- Is that what you want?
- All I want is to get out of here.

750
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:26,528
If you had any sense, you'd know
we should've turned back a long time ago.

751
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:28,870
Thank you.
Have you anything to add to that?

752
00:58:28,942 --> 00:58:30,432
Yes, I have, sir.

753
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,740
Your last patrol was a bloody shambles.

754
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:36,010
Getting this one shot up the ass
isn't gonna win you any medals.

755
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:39,883
So why don't you go home like a good boy
before you get the lot of us killed?

756
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:42,421
I don't know about you,
but I have better things to do!

757
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:44,821
Thank you. I shall cherish that bit of advice.

758
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:47,416
Corporal, this man is under open arrest.

759
00:58:47,494 --> 00:58:52,022
When you get back to camp, you will
prepare charges for a field courts-martial.

760
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:54,124
Are you satisfied, Hearne?

761
00:58:55,102 --> 00:58:58,367
Easy. Watch yourself, laddie.

762
00:58:58,438 --> 00:59:01,601
That wee man's near daft enough
to have you shot.

763
00:59:02,776 --> 00:59:05,506
All right, Corporal,
prepare to move off in five minutes.

764
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:06,637
Sir.

765
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,512
Rafferty, go and get Griffiths.

766
00:59:14,788 --> 00:59:17,188
All right, front marker, move out.

767
00:59:19,826 --> 00:59:24,160
It seems some of the men have just as little
enthusiasm for their duties as you do.

768
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:27,325
Maybe they didn't
volunteer for the assignment either.

769
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:28,527
No, they didn't.

770
00:59:28,602 --> 00:59:32,231
Since this entire operation was
for the benefit of the United States Navy...

771
00:59:32,305 --> 00:59:35,331
they probably find the object
of the exercise extremely remote.

772
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:38,469
Furthermore, they're just as anxious
to get home as you are.

773
00:59:38,545 --> 00:59:40,604
Is that what you're gonna do now?
Go home?

774
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,343
Fact is, it doesn't matter how you feel
about something before the event.

775
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:46,716
You may very well feel it's a waste of time.

776
00:59:46,787 --> 00:59:49,915
For all I care, you could be
a long-haired conscientious objector.

777
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:53,892
In that case, you should have had the guts
to say so in the first place.

778
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,450
Is that right?

779
00:59:55,595 --> 00:59:57,654
The fact remains,
that once you're involved...

780
00:59:57,731 --> 01:00:00,461
you have a certain responsibility
to the people around you.

781
01:00:00,534 --> 01:00:01,831
They depend on you.

782
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:05,838
And that's something that none of your
sophisticated arguments can get around.

783
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,498
Do you understand what I mean?

784
01:00:07,574 --> 01:00:09,439
Yeah, I hear you talking.

785
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:11,636
But you still haven't answered my question.

786
01:00:11,711 --> 01:00:12,871
Scott!

787
01:00:18,418 --> 01:00:19,680
Yes, sir.

788
01:00:22,422 --> 01:00:25,050
All right, Corporal, move the men out.

789
01:01:10,504 --> 01:01:13,598
...otherwise you'll wake up
Snow White and the Fairy Prince.

790
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:16,237
Don't talk so daft.

791
01:01:16,376 --> 01:01:19,311
I just wanna get home like the rest of you.

792
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:28,784
Why don't we do that?

793
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:33,259
Why don't we all just bugger off home?

794
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:39,255
We could always say...

795
01:01:39,332 --> 01:01:43,063
that old Fairy Feet and Snow White got lost.

796
01:01:46,439 --> 01:01:48,634
Think. In six months' time...

797
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:53,741
the Japs will still be sitting
in this part of the jungle...

798
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:58,678
and we will still be sitting
in our part of the jungle...

799
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:03,049
and none of this
will have made a blind bit of difference.

800
01:02:08,595 --> 01:02:10,586
You're joking, ain't you?

801
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,565
That's right, Scottie.

802
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:18,260
I'm always joking.

803
01:02:41,995 --> 01:02:43,394
All right, this is it.

804
01:02:43,463 --> 01:02:45,226
Who gets to stay up?

805
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:51,802
And we'll separate at this fork
in the trail here.

806
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:55,534
I shall take Lt. Lawson, Hearne
and Scott to deal with the radio shack.

807
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:57,338
Cpl. McLean will lead the rest of you...

808
01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:00,208
to the southern section
where the barracks are concentrated.

809
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,805
Your job will be purely a diversionary one.

810
01:03:02,882 --> 01:03:05,942
As far as we can see,
there's only one radio operator.

811
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:09,853
Ideally, we would put him
out of commission just before midnight...

812
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:11,948
and then keep quiet until the Lieutenant...

813
01:03:12,025 --> 01:03:14,550
has sent his message
on our own transmitter.

814
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:19,327
If all goes well, we'll destroy their
transmitter immediately after midnight...

815
01:03:19,399 --> 01:03:22,732
and pull back without calling
for any help from your people.

816
01:03:22,802 --> 01:03:25,134
All right, let's be on our way.

817
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:28,770
Remember, any disturbance you hear
before midnight...

818
01:03:28,842 --> 01:03:31,310
will require diversionary action from you.

819
01:03:31,378 --> 01:03:33,972
If you hear nothing
after the one big explosion...

820
01:03:34,047 --> 01:03:37,244
you can pull back
without revealing your position.

821
01:03:37,684 --> 01:03:39,311
- Right?
- Right, sir.

822
01:03:39,386 --> 01:03:42,014
Lieutenant, will you lead off, please?

823
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,118
Let's go, Scott.

824
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:55,632
Good luck.

825
01:03:56,403 --> 01:03:57,768
Let us have you.

826
01:03:58,405 --> 01:04:01,772
Come on, we've just got 15 minutes.
Get your fingers out!

827
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:03,240
I'm coming.

828
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,210
And remember, be quiet.

829
01:04:31,404 --> 01:04:32,462
Sir.

830
01:04:51,024 --> 01:04:52,116
Tosh!

831
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,751
Hearne, you stupid idiot!

832
01:05:01,601 --> 01:05:04,035
- How is it?
- I'm just looking, sir.

833
01:05:06,172 --> 01:05:07,332
Come on.

834
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:09,875
Oh, God, please. No.

835
01:05:11,177 --> 01:05:12,644
How about it?

836
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:18,749
It's useless, sir.
There's at least three valves smashed.

837
01:05:18,818 --> 01:05:20,843
- Valves?
- "Tubes" to you.

838
01:05:21,988 --> 01:05:24,149
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

839
01:05:26,993 --> 01:05:29,757
Hearne, you bastard!
You did that deliberately.

840
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:31,854
No, I didn't, Mr. Hornsby.

841
01:05:32,999 --> 01:05:35,729
You'll address me properly, do you hear?

842
01:05:36,202 --> 01:05:37,601
Do you hear?

843
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:45,877
Yes, I hear you, sir...

844
01:05:45,945 --> 01:05:49,847
and so will the Japs,
if you don't keep your bloody voice down.

845
01:05:51,217 --> 01:05:53,742
I'm very sorry, sir,
but there was nothing I could do.

846
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:57,813
Dump that thing in the bushes!
We're late already. Out of my way.

847
01:05:59,225 --> 01:06:01,659
- Any spares?
- No.

848
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:43,662
Go on.

849
01:06:49,576 --> 01:06:52,272
Down there, under the hut.

850
01:06:57,484 --> 01:06:58,644
Hurry.

851
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:21,272
They got a bleeding generator
grinding away.

852
01:07:21,441 --> 01:07:23,636
Lights on all over the place.

853
01:07:26,446 --> 01:07:28,471
Not expecting visitors, are they?

854
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:39,958
Spread out. Take cover.

855
01:07:53,707 --> 01:07:55,607
Let's not wake them up.

856
01:08:04,684 --> 01:08:07,016
You gonna use grenades, Captain?

857
01:08:07,621 --> 01:08:11,113
May not be too easy.
Might bounce against those screens.

858
01:08:12,692 --> 01:08:15,388
Yeah. I suppose they might.

859
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:18,825
- Scott.
- Sir?

860
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,296
Do you think, I mean, given a chance...

861
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:27,431
that you could operate
the kind of transmitter they've got in there?

862
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:32,936
I'll have to have a look at it,
but it's probably basically the same thing.

863
01:08:33,013 --> 01:08:35,607
Good. I think we might give it a try.

864
01:08:36,683 --> 01:08:38,275
Give what a try?

865
01:08:38,485 --> 01:08:41,010
If the three of us
could get in there unnoticed...

866
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,520
I could dispose of him...

867
01:08:42,589 --> 01:08:46,423
and you two could send back
our fake message on their transmitter.

868
01:08:46,493 --> 01:08:48,825
Rather a nice touch of irony,
don't you think?

869
01:08:48,895 --> 01:08:52,763
What're you trying to pull, Captain?
That wasn't in our orders.

870
01:08:52,832 --> 01:08:56,563
No, Lieutenant. It's evident that one of us
has to get in there in any case...

871
01:08:56,636 --> 01:08:58,900
to make sure of destroying their transmitter.

872
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:00,371
So why not go the whole hog?

873
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:46,363
Our orders were damn plain, Captain.

874
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:48,558
We were to send
the message on our transmitter.

875
01:09:48,634 --> 01:09:50,932
If that didn't work out,
we were to destroy theirs.

876
01:09:51,003 --> 01:09:52,265
But nobody said a damn thing...

877
01:09:52,337 --> 01:09:56,068
Do be quiet. I'm going over there
to deal with the operator.

878
01:09:56,341 --> 01:10:00,141
When you see me come back to the window,
you and Scott will join me.

879
01:10:00,212 --> 01:10:03,773
We'll send our message,
destroy their transmitter, and leave.

880
01:10:03,849 --> 01:10:05,441
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

881
01:10:05,517 --> 01:10:08,418
No, sir. I'm having no part of it, Captain.

882
01:10:08,487 --> 01:10:11,149
You're disobeying orders
and going beyond your authority.

883
01:10:11,223 --> 01:10:13,123
You'll do as you're told.

884
01:10:13,191 --> 01:10:14,681
What about that sentry, sir?

885
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,194
Keep him covered,
but don't shoot unless he does.

886
01:10:17,262 --> 01:10:20,254
- Not even if he sees me.
- Even if he sees you?

887
01:10:20,732 --> 01:10:22,825
I'm going to walk straight across there.

888
01:10:22,901 --> 01:10:26,359
Even if he does see me, he's quite likely
to assume I'm one of his chaps.

889
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:28,065
- Sir.
- What is it?

890
01:10:28,707 --> 01:10:31,938
You'd look a lot less English
without that hat on.

891
01:10:37,549 --> 01:10:41,315
Captain! I'm telling you now.

892
01:10:42,387 --> 01:10:45,322
You're going against
Col. Thompson's orders.

893
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:48,453
If you go in there, I'm not going with you.

894
01:10:48,927 --> 01:10:50,360
You hear me?

895
01:10:50,662 --> 01:10:53,062
I haven't got time to argue, Lieutenant.

896
01:10:53,131 --> 01:10:55,326
You know what you have to do.

897
01:12:43,475 --> 01:12:44,874
There he is.

898
01:13:04,196 --> 01:13:05,857
What's the matter?

899
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:08,596
You heard me tell him
I'm not going in there.

900
01:13:17,008 --> 01:13:19,033
We're running out of time.

901
01:13:19,444 --> 01:13:21,002
What's the matter with you?

902
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:22,444
I told him.

903
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:32,346
Come on, Scott. Let's go!

904
01:13:52,043 --> 01:13:54,443
- Are you ready to transmit yet?
- I think so, sir.

905
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:57,949
- Where the devil's the Lieutenant?
- I don't know, sir.

906
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:07,649
Lawson!

907
01:14:13,732 --> 01:14:15,097
I told him.

908
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,824
I know you did.

909
01:14:17,269 --> 01:14:20,136
But they're in there now, waiting for you.

910
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,501
Go on, get moving!

911
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:33,960
Come on, move!

912
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,185
Where's the Lieutenant?

913
01:17:28,259 --> 01:17:31,023
How the hell should I know?
I haven't seen him. Have you?

914
01:17:31,096 --> 01:17:32,723
Of course I haven't.

915
01:17:32,797 --> 01:17:34,287
Then let's go.

916
01:17:34,532 --> 01:17:36,625
I don't know.

917
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:39,329
You can please yourself, what you do.
I'm off.

918
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,929
I'm not waiting around for that rubbish sack.

919
01:17:42,006 --> 01:17:43,667
Coming in, Hearne.

920
01:17:47,378 --> 01:17:50,370
What're you doing? You're supposed
to be gone three minutes ago.

921
01:17:50,448 --> 01:17:53,576
Yes, sir. I was only waiting for you
because I thought you...

922
01:19:02,353 --> 01:19:03,547
Blimey.

923
01:19:04,956 --> 01:19:06,890
This is a turn-up for the book.

924
01:19:07,592 --> 01:19:11,323
Oh, God, looks like
the whole Japanese Air Force out there.

925
01:19:18,703 --> 01:19:19,965
Look at that.

926
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:23,239
Like the swing shift at Lockheed.

927
01:19:25,276 --> 01:19:26,675
I don't believe it.

928
01:19:26,744 --> 01:19:30,475
Three rousing, great cheers
for American Air Reconnaissance.

929
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:38,346
Let's get the hell out of here. Come on.

930
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,627
Get me out of here!

931
01:20:45,123 --> 01:20:47,023
What're you stopping for?

932
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,752
- Which way?
- To the right, go around.

933
01:20:49,827 --> 01:20:51,556
- Come on.
- Go around.

934
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,057
To the right, come on!

935
01:20:54,132 --> 01:20:56,464
Give us covering fire, Thornton.

936
01:22:24,756 --> 01:22:26,690
- What's that?
- Scatter.

937
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:40,727
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.</i>

938
01:22:43,341 --> 01:22:45,502
<i>This is Major Yamaguchi...</i>

939
01:22:45,576 --> 01:22:48,443
<i>who has the pleasure of addressing you.</i>

940
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:53,783
<i>No doubt you are quite amazed
to hear my voice.</i>

941
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:57,885
<i>In order to be sure...</i>

942
01:22:58,489 --> 01:23:00,354
that you are hearing me...

943
01:23:00,425 --> 01:23:05,158
I was obliged to make this speech
five times today.

944
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,031
<i>But tomorrow, as we close in on you...</i>

945
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,433
<i>you will hear only four such speeches.</i>

946
01:23:13,137 --> 01:23:14,661
On Saturday...

947
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:19,176
if you have not already
been killed or captured...

948
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:21,340
<i>only two.</i>

949
01:23:22,547 --> 01:23:23,809
Captured?

950
01:23:23,881 --> 01:23:26,679
<i>If you look at your map, you will see...</i>

951
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:29,045
that as you travel south...

952
01:23:30,421 --> 01:23:32,184
towards your base...

953
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:37,090
your situation is like that of water...

954
01:23:37,462 --> 01:23:38,724
<i>in a funnel.</i>

955
01:23:38,796 --> 01:23:40,161
What's he on about?

956
01:23:40,231 --> 01:23:41,892
<i>Do you understand?</i>

957
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,625
<i>Like water in a funnel.</i>

958
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:50,502
No matter where you may now be,
or which route you take...

959
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:55,602
you will eventually wish
to emerge at your base.

960
01:23:57,849 --> 01:23:59,942
<i>As the funnel narrows...</i>

961
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:02,779
<i>as you get closer to home...</i>

962
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:07,548
<i>we will have less and less area to cover...</i>

963
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,217
<i>in our search for you.</i>

964
01:24:10,161 --> 01:24:13,892
We have found
your abandoned radio transmitter.

965
01:24:14,765 --> 01:24:18,394
<i>We know our air power in this area...</i>

966
01:24:19,036 --> 01:24:21,163
<i>came as a surprise to you...</i>

967
01:24:21,472 --> 01:24:25,033
<i>and you must communicate
this information to your base.</i>

968
01:24:25,977 --> 01:24:29,105
But this will not happen.

969
01:24:30,348 --> 01:24:32,111
Within three days...

970
01:24:32,717 --> 01:24:36,448
you will all be killed or captured.

971
01:24:37,855 --> 01:24:41,723
<i>There is, however, an alternative.</i>

972
01:24:42,326 --> 01:24:44,726
<i>You should consider it carefully.</i>

973
01:24:44,795 --> 01:24:47,389
<i>If you will all surrender now...</i>

974
01:24:47,865 --> 01:24:51,096
<i>just one week from today, by which time...</i>

975
01:24:51,435 --> 01:24:55,269
<i>your plans and ours will be an open secret...</i>

976
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,008
<i>you will be released...</i>

977
01:24:58,075 --> 01:25:00,771
<i>and allowed to return to your own base.</i>

978
01:25:01,779 --> 01:25:04,111
This offer is a reasonable one.

979
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:07,985
Certainly you should consider it carefully.

980
01:25:10,087 --> 01:25:14,183
But, remember, it must be all of you.

981
01:25:14,959 --> 01:25:17,189
There can be no exceptions.

982
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:22,056
<i>I shall speak to you again tomorrow,
by which time...</i>

983
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,901
I hope that good sense will have prevailed.

984
01:25:27,738 --> 01:25:30,764
If you wish to take advantage of our offer...

985
01:25:31,342 --> 01:25:34,243
you will fire a single shot as a signal.

986
01:25:34,845 --> 01:25:36,312
Up your khyber.

987
01:25:37,348 --> 01:25:39,748
<i>That is all. Good day, gentlemen.</i>

988
01:25:40,184 --> 01:25:43,585
And good day to you,
you malignant yellow dwarf.

989
01:25:45,523 --> 01:25:47,718
They must be right behind us.

990
01:25:48,192 --> 01:25:52,026
If that amplification's strong enough,
they could be a helluva long way.

991
01:25:52,096 --> 01:25:53,961
What do you think, sir?

992
01:25:54,031 --> 01:25:55,055
About what?

993
01:25:55,132 --> 01:25:57,157
It seems like they're on to us.

994
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,396
Do you think they mean
what they're saying?

995
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:01,301
Don't be bloody stupid.

996
01:26:01,372 --> 01:26:03,306
He did say they'd treat us all right.

997
01:26:03,374 --> 01:26:05,774
They'll chop your bloody head off.

998
01:26:05,977 --> 01:26:08,241
Since when have you been an expert?

999
01:26:08,312 --> 01:26:10,473
What do you know about it, bigmouth?

1000
01:26:10,548 --> 01:26:12,846
A sight more than you do, pig face.

1001
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,613
I saw what they did
in the hospital in Singapore.

1002
01:26:15,686 --> 01:26:18,052
You were so busy running
you never even saw a Jap...

1003
01:26:18,122 --> 01:26:19,851
let alone what they did to our lads.

1004
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:23,416
They won't take us to a rest camp
now that we know where that airstrip is.

1005
01:26:23,494 --> 01:26:24,518
He's right.

1006
01:26:24,595 --> 01:26:27,530
- Damn right. Now let's get out of here.
- Okay, come on.

1007
01:26:27,598 --> 01:26:28,997
All right, move out.

1008
01:27:53,284 --> 01:27:55,309
All right, get some sleep.

1009
01:28:02,827 --> 01:28:04,761
God, I'm tired.

1010
01:28:05,796 --> 01:28:07,354
Got to sleep.

1011
01:28:08,466 --> 01:28:09,524
Got to.

1012
01:28:38,796 --> 01:28:40,764
<i>Good morning, gentlemen.</i>

1013
01:28:40,831 --> 01:28:42,492
<i>This is Saturday.</i>

1014
01:28:43,167 --> 01:28:47,467
<i>And the funnel in which you are trapped
is rapidly narrowing.</i>

1015
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:52,304
I anticipated that you'd accept my terms.

1016
01:28:54,211 --> 01:28:57,408
<i>Instead, you evidently marched...</i>

1017
01:28:57,982 --> 01:29:01,474
throughout the day,
and, perhaps, most of the night.

1018
01:29:03,254 --> 01:29:05,017
<i>A remarkable effort.</i>

1019
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:09,853
<i>Your leader must be
a man of great determination.</i>

1020
01:29:11,395 --> 01:29:14,922
You have very little reason
to be pleased with him...

1021
01:29:16,367 --> 01:29:19,359
because his stubborn determination...

1022
01:29:19,703 --> 01:29:20,863
<i>has inspired me...</i>

1023
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:23,600
to alter the terms of our offer.

1024
01:29:25,075 --> 01:29:28,476
This offer now has a time limit.

1025
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:33,008
You have until sundown to surrender.

1026
01:29:33,417 --> 01:29:36,978
After that, you will be killed on sight.

1027
01:29:37,321 --> 01:29:41,121
<i>In war, one must take harsh measures.</i>

1028
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:44,920
I'm sorry if you do not like these new rules...

1029
01:29:46,163 --> 01:29:49,428
but the responsibility rests with your leader.

1030
01:29:50,901 --> 01:29:55,361
Remember, you have only
to fire a single shot.

1031
01:29:56,373 --> 01:29:58,466
<i>But please remember also...</i>

1032
01:29:58,876 --> 01:30:01,777
that any surrender must include all of you.

1033
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:05,273
<i>You understand? All of you.</i>

1034
01:30:07,084 --> 01:30:10,611
I will give you a few minutes
to consider your decision.

1035
01:30:11,922 --> 01:30:14,117
How about it now, Lieutenant?

1036
01:30:14,725 --> 01:30:16,215
What? Quit?

1037
01:30:18,128 --> 01:30:19,322
No way.

1038
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:21,726
They're not getting their hands on me.

1039
01:30:21,799 --> 01:30:23,960
This time tomorrow,
I'll be back at that camp.

1040
01:30:24,034 --> 01:30:26,525
I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

1041
01:30:26,604 --> 01:30:29,334
Even the Jap said it was all your fault.

1042
01:30:29,874 --> 01:30:31,899
I think we should turn in.

1043
01:30:32,376 --> 01:30:34,936
- What do you say, Thornton?
- Look, mate...

1044
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:38,641
I couldn't give a bugger about
the Yank's reasons for wanting to carry on...

1045
01:30:38,716 --> 01:30:41,651
because I happen to know
they're half-baked anyway.

1046
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:45,553
And if you want to believe that Jap, you can,
but they're not gonna get me.

1047
01:30:45,623 --> 01:30:48,217
I'd sooner shoot you than trust them.

1048
01:30:48,459 --> 01:30:50,359
As a matter of fact...

1049
01:30:51,462 --> 01:30:52,895
much sooner.

1050
01:30:53,397 --> 01:30:56,366
How do you know the Japs are lying?

1051
01:30:57,134 --> 01:30:59,694
What makes you think
they're all that different from us?

1052
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:01,965
That's right, kid, they're not.

1053
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:04,872
That's why that Jap Major could be lying,
just like I would.

1054
01:31:09,613 --> 01:31:11,513
You remain indecisive.

1055
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:14,215
I am sorry.

1056
01:31:15,019 --> 01:31:17,112
Perhaps when you have rested...

1057
01:31:17,288 --> 01:31:19,279
<i>you will feel different.</i>

1058
01:31:20,457 --> 01:31:22,982
But the conditions remain the same.

1059
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:26,327
You have until dusk to give yourselves up.

1060
01:31:27,531 --> 01:31:28,930
That is all.

1061
01:31:46,116 --> 01:31:48,846
I knew it. He wants to draw our fire
and kill us all.

1062
01:31:48,919 --> 01:31:50,477
How do you know that's what he said?

1063
01:31:50,554 --> 01:31:52,749
Wanna wait a couple of minutes?
They'll be here.

1064
01:31:52,823 --> 01:31:55,815
- In that case, now's the time to pack it in.
- Watch it, darling.

1065
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:00,154
They're coming.

1066
01:32:01,298 --> 01:32:03,766
- Clear that place.
- Get down!

1067
01:32:07,905 --> 01:32:09,065
Knife.

1068
01:33:30,788 --> 01:33:33,120
Come on, let's get out of here.

1069
01:33:36,193 --> 01:33:39,424
Get him out of there. Quick, damn it.

1070
01:33:41,131 --> 01:33:44,123
- Come on, you guys, give us a hand.
- Get him out of there.

1071
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:49,170
- Griffiths, get my pack.
- Yes, sir.

1072
01:33:49,239 --> 01:33:50,934
- McLean!
- Yes, sir?

1073
01:33:51,108 --> 01:33:53,633
Get behind him.
Pick him up and get him up the hill.

1074
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,042
Come on.

1075
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:01,715
Move down.

1076
01:34:02,352 --> 01:34:04,786
- He can't move.
- Come on.

1077
01:34:05,089 --> 01:34:06,750
Quick, hurry up.

1078
01:34:07,357 --> 01:34:08,984
Come on, damn it.

1079
01:34:09,059 --> 01:34:11,425
Move your ass! Come on!

1080
01:34:12,763 --> 01:34:15,664
- Move!
- That's the way.

1081
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:16,893
I'll lead them off up here.

1082
01:34:16,967 --> 01:34:18,161
That's the way.

1083
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:20,703
Day and night, service is on hand, sir.

1084
01:34:25,476 --> 01:34:27,103
Come on, boys.

1085
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:22,493
Don't drop him now.

1086
01:35:22,566 --> 01:35:25,160
Watch out for those man-eating trout.

1087
01:35:27,604 --> 01:35:28,730
Easy.

1088
01:35:33,677 --> 01:35:35,770
You weigh a bleeding ton.

1089
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,477
That's it.

1090
01:35:41,218 --> 01:35:42,708
Easy, Thorny.

1091
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:46,483
Tosh, my old buddy,
how does it look back there?

1092
01:35:46,557 --> 01:35:48,184
It's not so bad.

1093
01:35:50,093 --> 01:35:51,685
You'll be all right.

1094
01:35:51,762 --> 01:35:54,162
What kind of nonsense is that, man?

1095
01:35:54,231 --> 01:35:58,600
I can feel where the scorching thing went in,
and I can't feel where it came out.

1096
01:35:58,669 --> 01:36:00,830
Yeah, you are leaking a bit.

1097
01:36:01,305 --> 01:36:02,567
Hold up!

1098
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:05,901
That makes your eyes water, doesn't it?

1099
01:36:08,745 --> 01:36:10,178
- Is that tight enough?
- Yeah.

1100
01:36:10,247 --> 01:36:13,216
Right, now put your little pinkie
on the knot. That's right.

1101
01:36:13,283 --> 01:36:15,717
Very pretty.
I'm ready for my coming-out ball.

1102
01:36:15,786 --> 01:36:19,517
You'll get "coming out" in a minute.
Take your finger away when I say, "Go."

1103
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:21,285
Ready, steady, go.

1104
01:36:22,459 --> 01:36:24,324
There we are. I shouldn't worry about it.

1105
01:36:24,394 --> 01:36:26,385
No, you shouldn't, but maybe I should?

1106
01:36:27,497 --> 01:36:30,523
That bloody Yankee poonagger's
not coming back.

1107
01:36:30,834 --> 01:36:32,358
That's all right.

1108
01:36:32,436 --> 01:36:34,427
Thornton's not going anywhere,
are you, Jock?

1109
01:36:34,504 --> 01:36:36,938
No, I'm having my change of life.

1110
01:36:37,307 --> 01:36:39,571
- Can he walk?
- Only on the water.

1111
01:36:40,677 --> 01:36:41,803
Yeah.

1112
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:45,338
That's it then.

1113
01:36:48,418 --> 01:36:51,148
Do you hear that, lads?
If anyone's going mad...

1114
01:36:51,355 --> 01:36:54,381
We've either got to leave him here
or turn ourselves in, right?

1115
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:57,393
I already told you, nobody's turning it in.

1116
01:36:58,061 --> 01:37:00,222
What are you gonna do with him?

1117
01:37:00,297 --> 01:37:03,095
You can't bloody carry him back, can you?

1118
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,963
You're so bloody clever, Hearne.
What are you gonna do with him?

1119
01:37:07,037 --> 01:37:10,996
Listen, you poxed-up Glaswegian queer!

1120
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:14,476
It's bad enough sitting here
full of bloody holes...

1121
01:37:14,544 --> 01:37:18,275
without listening to you
open your ugly face!

1122
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:20,239
Knock it off.

1123
01:37:22,586 --> 01:37:24,611
I can hear you halfway down the trail.

1124
01:37:24,688 --> 01:37:28,647
- What's the matter with you guys, anyway?
- It's Thornton, sir.

1125
01:37:28,792 --> 01:37:30,316
He can't walk.

1126
01:37:30,661 --> 01:37:34,893
I was just saying we've either
gotta leave him here or turn ourselves in.

1127
01:37:35,499 --> 01:37:37,524
Now, suppose you let me worry about that?

1128
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:41,469
Meanwhile, you just rest your toes
because we're leaving before dark.

1129
01:37:43,573 --> 01:37:46,371
- Back in a minute, Thorny.
- Thanks, Tosh.

1130
01:37:46,877 --> 01:37:48,811
That blood's worth bottling.

1131
01:37:49,146 --> 01:37:50,636
Look at that pair.

1132
01:37:50,714 --> 01:37:53,512
I see Snow White's found his first dwarf.

1133
01:37:54,484 --> 01:37:57,920
A right teddy bear's picnic
this has turned out to be.

1134
01:37:59,656 --> 01:38:01,954
- How long has Thornton got?
- I don't know.

1135
01:38:02,025 --> 01:38:04,755
But he won't be here next week,
that's for certain.

1136
01:38:45,969 --> 01:38:47,766
Where are you going?

1137
01:38:52,676 --> 01:38:54,337
Where are you off?

1138
01:39:06,123 --> 01:39:08,421
You know what that Yank's gonna do,
don't you?

1139
01:39:08,492 --> 01:39:10,517
- What?
- He's not leaving you here alive.

1140
01:39:10,594 --> 01:39:12,289
He'd sooner kill you himself.

1141
01:39:12,362 --> 01:39:14,455
- Kill me?
- Why shouldn't he?

1142
01:39:14,664 --> 01:39:16,791
All he cares about
is getting back to the camp.

1143
01:39:16,867 --> 01:39:20,132
He doesn't give a bugger about you.
I heard him say so.

1144
01:39:20,203 --> 01:39:21,864
Go to hell.

1145
01:39:21,938 --> 01:39:24,736
The only thing to do
to get you out of here safely...

1146
01:39:24,808 --> 01:39:28,141
to see you're looked after,
is to turn ourselves in.

1147
01:39:28,745 --> 01:39:31,976
I'll go with McLean and Griffiths
and talk to the Japs.

1148
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:35,212
You try that and I'll shoot you myself.

1149
01:39:38,355 --> 01:39:40,118
Don't be daft, man.

1150
01:39:40,257 --> 01:39:42,919
- What else is there?
- You cowardly pig.

1151
01:39:43,193 --> 01:39:45,661
You just want to save your own skin,
you hear me?

1152
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:47,492
Now look here, Thornton.

1153
01:39:47,564 --> 01:39:49,464
For God's sake, man...

1154
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:54,694
can't you even leave a fellow in peace?

1155
01:40:01,812 --> 01:40:03,177
I'm sorry.

1156
01:40:04,114 --> 01:40:05,547
I really am.

1157
01:40:06,383 --> 01:40:08,510
I was only thinking of you.

1158
01:40:08,819 --> 01:40:11,287
Come on, take a wee drop of water.

1159
01:40:12,022 --> 01:40:13,489
Come on, now.

1160
01:40:18,061 --> 01:40:21,588
I'll hold it up for you. Come on, drink it now.

1161
01:40:39,816 --> 01:40:41,841
McLean! Quickly! Wake up!

1162
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:49,952
Wake up! Thornton's had it!

1163
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:52,028
There's no telling
what the Yank will do now.

1164
01:40:52,095 --> 01:40:53,119
What is it?

1165
01:40:53,196 --> 01:40:55,096
Come on, wake up.

1166
01:40:55,165 --> 01:40:57,531
- What's the matter?
- Thornton's dead. Come on!

1167
01:40:57,601 --> 01:40:59,466
- What about Tosh?
- Leave him.

1168
01:40:59,536 --> 01:41:00,594
You can't leave Tosh.

1169
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:04,504
Once we get to the Japs,
we'll all be all right. Him as well.

1170
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:51,682
Wake up!

1171
01:41:52,422 --> 01:41:55,585
Wake up, you stupid bastard!
Where the hell are they?

1172
01:41:56,927 --> 01:41:59,020
How the bloody hell do I know?

1173
01:41:59,095 --> 01:42:01,655
You're the one
who's supposed to be on guard.

1174
01:42:11,942 --> 01:42:13,876
Stupid, dirty bastards!

1175
01:42:14,678 --> 01:42:17,511
- You going after them?
- No, it's too late.

1176
01:42:17,581 --> 01:42:20,414
They're probably closer to the Japs
than we are.

1177
01:42:20,483 --> 01:42:24,544
The only way they'll stay alive
is by telling that Jap Major where we are.

1178
01:42:26,423 --> 01:42:28,084
Come on, let's go.

1179
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:50,205
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1180
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:54,605
<i>From what your comrades have told me...</i>

1181
01:43:55,879 --> 01:43:58,677
I may assume that you are now hearing me.

1182
01:44:00,183 --> 01:44:01,946
As you must know...

1183
01:44:02,419 --> 01:44:05,411
your comrades decided
to try and save their lives...

1184
01:44:05,488 --> 01:44:08,753
by surrendering and informing us
of your position.

1185
01:44:11,194 --> 01:44:12,889
But you escaped...

1186
01:44:13,963 --> 01:44:16,523
and so their fate is still in doubt.

1187
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:21,561
Their surrender is of little value
unless you choose to join them.

1188
01:44:23,473 --> 01:44:25,941
If you will surrender before dark...

1189
01:44:26,509 --> 01:44:28,306
<i>I shall keep my word.</i>

1190
01:44:29,312 --> 01:44:31,439
<i>You will be well treated...</i>

1191
01:44:31,815 --> 01:44:34,841
<i>and released in only a few days.</i>

1192
01:44:35,919 --> 01:44:39,320
The man, Campbell,
did not merit such good treatment.

1193
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:45,290
He was found to be carrying
the personal effects of one of our officers...

1194
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:49,362
our Communications Lieutenant...

1195
01:44:49,699 --> 01:44:52,463
who has been missing since last Tuesday.

1196
01:44:53,136 --> 01:44:55,570
His body was discovered yesterday.

1197
01:44:57,774 --> 01:45:01,175
<i>Our Lieutenant
was very popular with his men.</i>

1198
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:06,543
You would understand that
there was little I could do to restrain them...

1199
01:45:09,619 --> 01:45:11,610
even if I had wanted to.

1200
01:45:13,323 --> 01:45:17,020
It has been an incident
in which none of us can take pride.

1201
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:20,395
<i>However, the real problem still remains.</i>

1202
01:45:22,365 --> 01:45:25,562
<i>You must decide what you want done
with the two comrades...</i>

1203
01:45:25,635 --> 01:45:27,762
<i>who are still our prisoners.</i>

1204
01:45:29,839 --> 01:45:32,603
<i>It is for you to say if they shall live.</i>

1205
01:45:53,496 --> 01:45:55,293
If you wish to stay alive...

1206
01:45:55,365 --> 01:45:58,960
you must persuade your two friends
to surrender. Do you understand?

1207
01:45:59,035 --> 01:46:00,332
Yes, sir.

1208
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:05,070
You may talk to them.

1209
01:46:06,409 --> 01:46:08,468
Lieutenant? Tosh?

1210
01:46:09,078 --> 01:46:10,670
It's me, McLean.

1211
01:46:11,114 --> 01:46:14,982
It's right, what the Major was saying.
About Campbell, I mean.

1212
01:46:15,185 --> 01:46:17,813
They showed us the stuff
he stole from the officer...

1213
01:46:17,887 --> 01:46:21,084
and how he chopped his finger off
to get the ring.

1214
01:46:21,691 --> 01:46:25,024
There wasn't anything
anyone could've done to stop them.

1215
01:46:25,094 --> 01:46:26,891
But we're all right.

1216
01:46:28,097 --> 01:46:30,895
It is necessary for you to persuade them.

1217
01:46:33,903 --> 01:46:37,600
I know we shouldn't have gone off
with Campbell like we did.

1218
01:46:37,674 --> 01:46:40,609
And I know we shouldn't have told them
where you were hiding...

1219
01:46:40,677 --> 01:46:44,579
but it was Campbell's idea,
and we thought it was for the best.

1220
01:46:45,415 --> 01:46:48,248
Listen, if you don't
give yourselves up now...

1221
01:46:48,318 --> 01:46:51,219
we'll be the ones who end up paying for it.

1222
01:46:52,555 --> 01:46:55,524
Your Corporal
is giving you excellent advice.

1223
01:46:56,759 --> 01:46:59,694
<i>There is no longer a choice for any of you.</i>

1224
01:46:59,929 --> 01:47:02,261
<i>Either you surrender and live...</i>

1225
01:47:02,332 --> 01:47:05,631
<i>or if you attempt
to postpone the inevitable...</i>

1226
01:47:06,302 --> 01:47:08,736
then I shall withdraw my offer...

1227
01:47:09,038 --> 01:47:11,768
and your two comrades will die tonight.

1228
01:47:13,076 --> 01:47:16,273
The decision is yours.
You have until nightfall to decide.

1229
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:17,370
<i>Please, Lieutenant...</i>

1230
01:47:17,447 --> 01:47:19,278
do like he says.

1231
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:22,582
Tosh, please!

1232
01:47:31,227 --> 01:47:34,663
I couldn't care less
what they do to those two.

1233
01:47:36,633 --> 01:47:39,602
Whatever that Jap's gonna do,
he's gonna do.

1234
01:47:40,837 --> 01:47:43,829
It's got nothing to do with
what we're gonna do.

1235
01:47:44,574 --> 01:47:48,305
If you mean
it ain't gonna make us surrender...

1236
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:50,769
I'm with you.

1237
01:47:51,581 --> 01:47:56,075
But if you think we're gonna
try and get back to camp by tomorrow...

1238
01:47:58,454 --> 01:48:00,354
you must be bloody mad.

1239
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:06,351
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

1240
01:48:06,829 --> 01:48:10,458
We hit that clearing
on the edge of that camp...

1241
01:48:11,534 --> 01:48:13,525
if there are two of us...

1242
01:48:13,603 --> 01:48:17,300
we're gonna have twice as much a chance
of getting through.

1243
01:48:17,373 --> 01:48:18,965
And, buddy boy...

1244
01:48:19,742 --> 01:48:22,677
you're going with me every step of the way.

1245
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,917
Listen, Lieutenant...

1246
01:48:33,923 --> 01:48:36,721
neither of us wants to get killed, right?

1247
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:41,921
I've never believed any of the guff
that Jap's been giving us, either.

1248
01:48:41,998 --> 01:48:44,660
I know once he lays his hands on us...

1249
01:48:44,867 --> 01:48:47,836
he'll finish us off, no matter what he says.

1250
01:48:48,137 --> 01:48:50,264
So, up until now...

1251
01:48:50,974 --> 01:48:54,341
the only way of staying alive
was getting back to camp.

1252
01:48:55,345 --> 01:48:57,677
But now there's another way.

1253
01:48:58,648 --> 01:49:01,310
Something that nobody else thought of.

1254
01:49:02,318 --> 01:49:04,411
Nobody except me, that is.

1255
01:49:05,655 --> 01:49:07,646
- What?
- It's very simple.

1256
01:49:10,059 --> 01:49:13,392
We double back,
head north for two or three hours...

1257
01:49:15,064 --> 01:49:18,864
duck off the trail,
sleep for a couple of days...

1258
01:49:19,602 --> 01:49:21,502
and we'll be laughing.

1259
01:49:21,971 --> 01:49:24,098
- Laughing?
- Yeah, laughing.

1260
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:27,002
Because once the Jap dive bombers...

1261
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:30,341
get stuck into the Yank ships
Monday morning...

1262
01:49:31,948 --> 01:49:34,974
the Jap Major
won't be looking for us anymore.

1263
01:49:36,252 --> 01:49:37,412
Right?

1264
01:49:38,087 --> 01:49:40,817
He couldn't care less where we are then.

1265
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:46,385
We can just lie low for a couple of days...

1266
01:49:46,729 --> 01:49:48,720
stroll back into camp...

1267
01:49:48,998 --> 01:49:51,466
and nobody will say a dickie bird.

1268
01:49:57,607 --> 01:49:59,632
What's so bad about that?

1269
01:50:00,843 --> 01:50:03,903
I never asked those idiots
to send me out here.

1270
01:50:04,881 --> 01:50:07,714
But if I ever get back, it'll be:

1271
01:50:09,085 --> 01:50:10,814
"Well done, Hearne.

1272
01:50:11,554 --> 01:50:13,215
"Jolly good show.

1273
01:50:13,823 --> 01:50:16,018
"Now you can piss off home...

1274
01:50:16,826 --> 01:50:20,091
"back to whatever dirty little hole
you came from."

1275
01:50:22,532 --> 01:50:24,864
And what are they
gonna do for you, Lieutenant?

1276
01:50:24,934 --> 01:50:27,164
Make you the bloody President?

1277
01:50:27,236 --> 01:50:28,294
No.

1278
01:50:29,005 --> 01:50:31,064
Getting ourselves killed...

1279
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:34,769
isn't going to make any difference
to anybody except us.

1280
01:50:36,913 --> 01:50:38,380
Look, Yank...

1281
01:50:38,781 --> 01:50:42,182
the last thing that Jap Major
is gonna be looking for...

1282
01:50:42,251 --> 01:50:44,344
is us heading north.

1283
01:50:45,688 --> 01:50:47,417
So what do you say?

1284
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:50,550
You got any idea how many guys
will get killed on those ships...

1285
01:50:50,626 --> 01:50:52,890
if we haven't got the guts
to try and stop them?

1286
01:50:52,962 --> 01:50:56,398
Okay, so a couple of hundred Yanks
will get the chop.

1287
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:00,433
- They shouldn't have joined, should they?
- Hundreds?

1288
01:51:01,771 --> 01:51:03,102
Thousands.

1289
01:51:03,172 --> 01:51:06,972
In any case, it's not the bloody Yanks
you're worried about...

1290
01:51:07,043 --> 01:51:09,807
because if their chances
depend on us getting back...

1291
01:51:09,879 --> 01:51:12,313
they've just about had it in the first place.

1292
01:51:12,381 --> 01:51:16,317
No, what's got you jumping about
like a frog with a bullet up its ass...

1293
01:51:16,385 --> 01:51:18,512
is old Fairy Feet Hornsby...

1294
01:51:19,021 --> 01:51:21,581
because you reckon you let him down.

1295
01:51:22,625 --> 01:51:25,822
And that's the one bloody time
you've been right.

1296
01:51:25,895 --> 01:51:27,123
You did.

1297
01:51:27,663 --> 01:51:30,757
You might just as well
have killed him yourself.

1298
01:51:30,967 --> 01:51:34,266
But getting us killed
isn't gonna make up for that.

1299
01:51:35,238 --> 01:51:38,071
So Hornsby is your problem.

1300
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:41,738
And those Yank sailors are your problem.

1301
01:51:42,779 --> 01:51:45,805
And if you wanna start playing
bloody heroes...

1302
01:51:46,149 --> 01:51:48,549
I've got another problem for you.

1303
01:51:49,218 --> 01:51:51,743
I'm not bloody well coming with you.

1304
01:52:03,399 --> 01:52:05,390
You forgot your problem.

1305
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:08,428
Me.

1306
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:12,002
I told you before...

1307
01:52:12,608 --> 01:52:15,441
one of us has gotta get back there alive.

1308
01:52:15,511 --> 01:52:19,072
And if you don't go with me,
I'll have to leave you here.

1309
01:52:23,152 --> 01:52:24,244
Dead.

1310
01:52:28,791 --> 01:52:30,190
Understood?

1311
01:52:34,096 --> 01:52:35,495
Understood.

1312
01:52:55,985 --> 01:52:57,680
Just don't forget.

1313
01:53:06,395 --> 01:53:09,330
<i>Gentlemen, your time is up!</i>

1314
01:53:10,266 --> 01:53:12,427
I shall give you 30 seconds.

1315
01:53:13,769 --> 01:53:15,930
If you do not give yourselves up...

1316
01:53:16,005 --> 01:53:19,202
I shall be forced to execute
your two comrades.

1317
01:53:19,909 --> 01:53:21,308
Let me talk to him.

1318
01:53:22,912 --> 01:53:25,142
Listen to me, Lieutenant, please.

1319
01:53:25,214 --> 01:53:28,206
You've gotta listen to me.
They're gonna kill us.

1320
01:53:28,885 --> 01:53:31,217
<i>Just like they killed Campbell.</i>

1321
01:53:33,122 --> 01:53:35,955
Please, Lieutenant, don't let them do it.

1322
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:35,782
Do you really find it so easy to believe
that I would shoot you?

1323
01:55:52,461 --> 01:55:53,860
Keep going.

1324
01:56:41,243 --> 01:56:42,471
Get up.

1325
01:56:45,414 --> 01:56:47,541
There's not much further to go.

1326
01:56:48,017 --> 01:56:50,178
How the hell would you know?

1327
01:56:50,953 --> 01:56:52,352
There can't be.

1328
01:56:56,087 --> 01:56:58,055
No more, thank you, sir.

1329
01:57:00,492 --> 01:57:02,050
Thank you, sir.

1330
01:57:16,241 --> 01:57:19,176
Get up, you limey son of a bitch,
or I'll kick your head in!

1331
01:57:19,244 --> 01:57:20,438
Get up.

1332
01:57:23,648 --> 01:57:25,445
<i>Good morning, again.</i>

1333
01:57:25,617 --> 01:57:28,085
<i>You must be very tired.</i>

1334
01:57:29,254 --> 01:57:32,155
<i>You have come a long way during the night.</i>

1335
01:57:32,323 --> 01:57:34,382
<i>A truly remarkable effort.</i>

1336
01:57:34,759 --> 01:57:37,887
Remarkable, but to very little purpose.

1337
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:41,060
Shut up, you slimy yellow nob.

1338
01:57:41,966 --> 01:57:43,866
<i>You have moved fast...</i>

1339
01:57:44,302 --> 01:57:46,327
<i>but we have moved faster.</i>

1340
01:57:47,071 --> 01:57:50,529
You will find that you are now
very near the open field...

1341
01:57:50,608 --> 01:57:53,372
that serves as a perimeter to your base.

1342
01:57:53,778 --> 01:57:56,975
<i>But some of my men
are already on that perimeter.</i>

1343
01:57:58,450 --> 01:58:01,942
<i>In short, you are now totally surrounded.</i>

1344
01:58:04,289 --> 01:58:08,783
<i>You are now at the very tip of the funnel
I have talked about so often.</i>

1345
01:58:16,367 --> 01:58:19,029
<i>I can understand your determination...</i>

1346
01:58:19,971 --> 01:58:22,701
<i>but to give up your lives for an objective...</i>

1347
01:58:22,774 --> 01:58:25,675
<i>which cannot be won is a foolish waste.</i>

1348
01:58:29,848 --> 01:58:33,011
<i>You have shown yourselves
to be brave soldiers.</i>

1349
01:58:33,818 --> 01:58:36,912
<i>It shows us
that you are intelligent ones also.</i>

1350
01:58:38,056 --> 01:58:40,217
<i>Give yourselves up and live.</i>

1351
01:58:41,226 --> 01:58:46,095
<i>I assure you, the medals they give
to dead heroes are made of brass.</i>

1352
01:58:47,432 --> 01:58:50,333
<i>All they do is add weight to your coffin.</i>

1353
01:58:51,302 --> 01:58:52,894
You bloody idiot!

1354
01:58:52,971 --> 01:58:54,302
<i>Believe me...</i>

1355
01:58:54,772 --> 01:58:57,502
<i>your situation is truly hopeless.</i>

1356
01:58:58,576 --> 01:59:02,672
<i>All trails leading back into the jungle
are under guard.</i>

1357
01:59:03,748 --> 01:59:04,976
<i>This means...</i>

1358
01:59:05,049 --> 01:59:07,313
that you can no longer hide...

1359
01:59:07,585 --> 01:59:10,520
you can no longer double back
on your tracks.

1360
01:59:17,762 --> 01:59:19,627
What's that all about?

1361
01:59:21,733 --> 01:59:23,997
Better get the Sergeant Major.

1362
01:59:27,372 --> 01:59:30,603
<i>I shall give you three minutes
during which time...</i>

1363
01:59:31,409 --> 01:59:34,173
you will wish to confirm for yourselves...

1364
01:59:34,245 --> 01:59:36,509
that what I have said is true.

1365
01:59:38,583 --> 01:59:40,608
<i>At the end of that time...</i>

1366
01:59:41,019 --> 01:59:44,250
you must either surrender or die.

1367
01:59:45,924 --> 01:59:50,258
You will fire a single shot to indicate
that you have surrendered.

1368
01:59:52,764 --> 01:59:56,097
Or my men will close in and kill.

1369
01:59:58,836 --> 02:00:00,064
Stand to!

1370
02:00:00,138 --> 02:00:02,470
- What is it?
- Don't know what it is, Sergeant Major.

1371
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:04,565
Get Col. Thompson! Double!

1372
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:07,606
- Get the Color Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant Major.

1373
02:00:09,380 --> 02:00:11,177
What the hell is it?

1374
02:00:13,151 --> 02:00:15,813
- What is it, Sergeant Major?
- I don't know what it is.

1375
02:00:15,887 --> 02:00:17,479
I've sent for the old man.

1376
02:00:17,555 --> 02:00:20,285
- You better man the weapon pits.
- Right.

1377
02:00:23,962 --> 02:00:25,623
Come on, let's have you fast now!

1378
02:00:28,566 --> 02:00:31,126
What do you think this is,
Kensington Gardens? Come on!

1379
02:00:31,202 --> 02:00:33,727
- Get in with that gun!
- Get in there.

1380
02:00:36,374 --> 02:00:38,604
Make sure the men stay back, Sergeant.

1381
02:00:38,676 --> 02:00:40,337
You men know the drill!

1382
02:00:40,411 --> 02:00:41,639
Keep back!

1383
02:00:41,713 --> 02:00:43,704
Stay out of enemy range!

1384
02:00:44,382 --> 02:00:45,440
Laid on!

1385
02:00:51,489 --> 02:00:54,219
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, Sergeant Major.

1386
02:00:55,693 --> 02:00:58,025
- Everything in order?
- Yes, sir.

1387
02:00:59,130 --> 02:01:01,997
- Mortars?
- All weapon pits are manned, sir.

1388
02:01:04,369 --> 02:01:07,099
Sounds like loudspeakers of some kind.

1389
02:01:08,106 --> 02:01:09,835
Got any more bright suggestions?

1390
02:01:09,907 --> 02:01:13,206
<i>My patience is growing very short.</i>

1391
02:01:13,678 --> 02:01:16,272
He must think we've still got a chance.

1392
02:01:16,347 --> 02:01:18,611
- Who must?
- Guchi.

1393
02:01:22,153 --> 02:01:24,451
Why are they giving us three minutes?

1394
02:01:25,957 --> 02:01:28,517
Why don't they just come and get us?

1395
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:29,852
Yeah.

1396
02:01:31,396 --> 02:01:32,488
Why?

1397
02:01:33,598 --> 02:01:35,065
I don't know.

1398
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:38,030
Maybe they're spread too thin.

1399
02:01:38,770 --> 02:01:43,036
Maybe they're afraid to come in,
for fear of chasing us out in the open.

1400
02:01:43,274 --> 02:01:47,005
Yeah, and having to waste
all those bullets to shoot us?

1401
02:01:47,879 --> 02:01:49,039
Maybe.

1402
02:01:49,947 --> 02:01:52,211
But there's still two of us...

1403
02:01:52,717 --> 02:01:56,118
and one of us just might make it.

1404
02:02:00,992 --> 02:02:03,984
You now have
only two and a half more minutes.

1405
02:02:04,629 --> 02:02:07,257
We could sure use some covering fire.

1406
02:02:08,499 --> 02:02:11,593
- Think your guys will be doing anything?
- Yeah.

1407
02:02:11,869 --> 02:02:13,268
Having breakfast.

1408
02:02:13,337 --> 02:02:15,965
We could use all the help we can get.

1409
02:02:18,042 --> 02:02:19,942
Maybe if we fire that shot...

1410
02:02:20,011 --> 02:02:22,673
- Why waste a bullet?
- What do you mean?

1411
02:02:28,352 --> 02:02:32,288
Fire one shot
and maybe we'll confuse the Japs a bit.

1412
02:02:33,658 --> 02:02:36,149
But if we could kill their Major...

1413
02:02:36,994 --> 02:02:40,122
they wouldn't have anyone
to tell them what to do.

1414
02:02:40,198 --> 02:02:42,530
They'd be running about all over the place.

1415
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:44,727
Might give us a head start.

1416
02:02:45,236 --> 02:02:49,764
And that little bastard's been asking for it
for a long time, hasn't he?

1417
02:03:25,042 --> 02:03:26,304
This way.

1418
02:03:44,162 --> 02:03:45,561
<i>Two minutes.</i>

1419
02:04:47,158 --> 02:04:51,026
You now have only one and a half
more minutes, gentlemen.

1420
02:05:46,150 --> 02:05:48,641
- Stand them to, Sergeant.
- All guns stand to!

1421
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:51,711
The rest of you keep back!
Out of enemy range!

1422
02:06:21,719 --> 02:06:23,050
It worked.

1423
02:06:23,587 --> 02:06:25,248
They've gone back.

1424
02:06:27,124 --> 02:06:28,751
Don't forget to zigzag.

1425
02:06:28,826 --> 02:06:31,226
You zig, I'll zag.

1426
02:06:34,565 --> 02:06:35,964
Look there!

1427
02:06:43,307 --> 02:06:45,207
There they are!

1428
02:06:48,746 --> 02:06:50,737
Can you make out which ones they are?

1429
02:07:07,164 --> 02:07:10,497
Lay down covering fire, Sergeant! Hurry!

1430
02:07:10,634 --> 02:07:12,864
Give those men covering fire!

1431
02:07:31,088 --> 02:07:33,022
Correct right, Sergeant!

1432
02:07:34,158 --> 02:07:36,092
Three turns more right!

1433
02:07:53,010 --> 02:07:54,637
More left!

1434
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:37,848
Come on!

1435
02:09:06,517 --> 02:09:09,042
- He's all right.
- He's alive.

1436
02:09:09,954 --> 02:09:12,149
- He's getting up.
- He's alive!

1437
02:10:36,207 --> 02:10:37,538
Cease fire!

1438
02:10:39,476 --> 02:10:41,205
All guns cease fire!

1439
02:10:53,958 --> 02:10:57,485
Machine gunners,
stand by to give us covering fire!

1440
02:11:11,642 --> 02:11:14,236
Take it easy, lad.

1441
02:11:17,681 --> 02:11:20,013
Were there any other survivors?

1442
02:11:22,853 --> 02:11:24,946
Was it just the two of you?

1443
02:11:28,692 --> 02:11:31,024
Who was that with you out there?

1444
02:11:33,297 --> 02:11:34,286
I said...

1445
02:11:34,798 --> 02:11:37,858
who was that with you out there?

1446
02:11:59,890 --> 02:12:01,289
Out there...

1447
02:12:04,228 --> 02:12:06,924
he was a bloody hero.

1448
02:12:07,631 --> 02:12:09,064
He killed...

1449
02:12:10,034 --> 02:12:12,832
fifteen bleeding Japs...

1450
02:12:13,771 --> 02:12:15,329
single-handed.

1451
02:12:15,539 --> 02:12:17,166
Killed fifteen?

1452
02:12:21,445 --> 02:12:24,005
Thirty, if you like.
