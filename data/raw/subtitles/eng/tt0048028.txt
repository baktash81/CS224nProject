that you love him.

1495
01:52:19,441 --> 01:52:21,109
Let him do for you.

1496
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:29,492
Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring
to speak to you this way, but I just had to.

1497
01:52:34,873 --> 01:52:36,332
You've tired my patient...

1498
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:40,044
...and I most certainly shall report it
to the doctor in the morning.

1499
01:52:42,339 --> 01:52:46,259
You don't know that he accuses you.
You don't know what he's thinking about.

1500
01:52:46,552 --> 01:52:49,262
Stop it, Cal.
You gonna cry for the rest of your life?

1501
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:51,556
- No. No.
- Well, then stop it.

1502
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:54,809
Go in there and talk to him
before it's too late.

1503
01:52:54,977 --> 01:52:56,060
- I can't.
- Please try.

1504
01:52:56,228 --> 01:52:58,146
- I can't.
- Please try.

1505
01:52:58,522 --> 01:52:59,856
Get it straight.

1506
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:05,027
Get through to him somehow.
Please try, Cal, before it's too late.

1507
01:53:05,863 --> 01:53:08,823
Please. Please.

1508
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:15,621
NURSE: ls there any coffee around here?
ABRA: I'll get you some in a minute.

1509
01:53:19,334 --> 01:53:23,629
Cal. Try. Try.

1510
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:26,090
Is there anything to read around here?

1511
01:53:27,885 --> 01:53:29,051
ABRA:
What would you like?

1512
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:33,389
- Something to get my mind off my feet.
- There's something in there.

1513
01:53:48,322 --> 01:53:52,033
CAL:
I tried to believe it was born in me...

1514
01:53:52,201 --> 01:53:55,912
...and that I couldn't help it,
but that's not so.

1515
01:53:58,290 --> 01:54:00,166
A man has a choice.

1516
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:03,044
You used to say that was where
he was different from an animal.

1517
01:54:03,212 --> 01:54:04,712
You see, I remember.

1518
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,342
A man has a choice, and the choice
is what makes him a man, see.

1519
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:12,178
You see, I do remember.

1520
01:54:12,971 --> 01:54:14,889
- Look, I can't find any coffee.
- Shh.

1521
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,682
Get out!

1522
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:28,528
Look.

1523
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,283
Cal.

1524
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:40,122
Do something...

1525
01:54:42,334 --> 01:54:43,501
...for me.

1526
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:44,919
Yes.

1527
01:54:49,049 --> 01:54:52,093
That woman...

1528
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:57,848
...the nurse, can't stand her.

1529
01:54:59,268 --> 01:55:00,935
Get me another.

1530
01:55:16,785 --> 01:55:18,828
I can't stand her either.

1531
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:24,917
And Cal...

1533
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:12,590
What did he say?

1534
01:56:19,306 --> 01:56:22,725
He said, "Don't get anybody else."

1535
01:56:24,269 --> 01:56:26,812
He said, "You stay with me...

1536
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:30,566
- ...and you take care of me."
- Oh.
