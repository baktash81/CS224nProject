00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,959
Hi!

2
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:44,087
Yes um, I was wondering if
I could get driving directions...

3
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:47,506
to a nightclub called Bunker.

4
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:49,299
Yes, Bunker.

5
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:52,134
How exactly would I get there?

6
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:55,845
It's Amy!

7
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:58,847
Hello, sweetie!

8
00:03:59,055 --> 00:03:59,723
<i>OK.</i>

9
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:02,391
How are you?
We miss you!

10
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:05,144
Yes, we wanted you to be
here with us.

11
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:06,269
Yes.

12
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,230
And how far is it?

13
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:13,149
No we're in Germany.

14
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,484
Then we travel to Italy in a couple of days.

15
00:04:16,484 --> 00:04:17,235
Great.

16
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,321
Thanks.
Alveterzane!

17
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:22,031
<i>I know.</i>

18
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:26,075
Tell her we got her a present from Holland.

19
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:28,285
Yeah we got you a present.

20
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,537
No we can't tell you what it
is, it's a surprise.

21
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:38,751
Oh yeah, the other thing is that
we met this cute German waiter.

22
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,169
<i>Jenny thinks he's pretty cute</i>

23
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:45,797
<i>Yeah, and he invited us to a party
tonight.</i>

24
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:47,465
So we're going to go.

25
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:50,801
But we should go.

26
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,053
Maybe we can talk to you later.

27
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,470
OK.

28
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,013
<i>All right.
We miss you!</i>

29
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:57,640
Bye, Amy!
Kisses!

30
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,431
OK.

31
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,308
Bye, sweetie!

32
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:15,486
I think we were supposed to turn.

33
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:16,069
Turn!

34
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:19,530
I thought you knew exactly
where we were going!

35
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,588
Do we go left or right?

36
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,760
I'm sorry, but I just don't know
where we are.

37
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:01,726
What was that?

38
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:03,895
I have no idea.

39
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:08,565
You must have run over a pot hole or something.

40
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,109
We need to get out
and check it out.

41
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:19,281
Shit!

42
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:21,992
Shit!

43
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:24,326
Shit!

44
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:26,202
Why?
Oh God!

45
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,495
Okay, okay ...

46
00:06:29,246 --> 00:06:30,247
Okay.

47
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:34,083
We call the rental car service.
Get the papers.

48
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:35,543
Okay.

49
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:48,802
Okay.

50
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,639
219,

51
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,516
200,

52
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,350
806.

53
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:03,104
What...

54
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:04,938
There's no signal.

55
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:06,148
What?

56
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:07,857
There's no signal!

57
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:11,318
There's always a signal.

58
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:14,029
Not out here in the middle of nowhere.

59
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,572
Oh my God, Shit!

60
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,913
Oh my God,
get back in the car.

61
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:36,252
OK ... Now what?

62
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:37,545
I don't know.

63
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,713
You know how to change a tire?

64
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:43,591
- No, I don't know how to change a tire.
- Neither do I.

65
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:46,718
What are we supposed to walk
until we find a house or a person or something?

66
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:47,636
Lindsay!

67
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:51,430
Lindsay. I am not getting out and walking.

68
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,349
Okay we're just going to sit here,
until the sun comes up.

69
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,684
I have heels and shorts on!
I'm not going outside!

70
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,688
Are those headlights?

71
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,444
Okay.
Roll down your window.

72
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:14,114
Are you kidding?!
I'm not going to just roll down the window.

73
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:16,490
Roll down the window.
He can help.

74
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,541
What's going on, girls?

75
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,167
Yeah um, we need help.

76
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:34,461
We have a flat tire.

77
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:37,463
I know you girls.

78
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:40,674
I've got a horny video
of you at home.

79
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,509
No, we speak English.

80
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:46,928
Can you help us?

81
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:50,848
You're always wet
between your legs, right?

82
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,433
Do not understand what he says.

83
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:58,145
Um, can you call someone?

84
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:00,896
I'll fuck you good and hard.

85
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:02,148
Would you like that?

86
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:04,399
"Ficken".
-Look it up.

87
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,484
Hold on a second.

88
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:12,739
Fucking!

89
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:14,239
He said Fucking!

90
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,199
- Okay. Bye.
- Roll your window up.

91
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:16,992
Goodbye.

92
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,205
- I'm sorry.
- I told you!

93
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:26,290
Is your door locked?

94
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,791
Yes, my door is locked.

95
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,669
Why's he still staring at us?

96
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:36,714
- Just don't look at him, okay?
- I'm not looking at him.

97
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:44,636
I just want to get out of here.

98
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,037
Okay.

99
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,705
We need to j-just go!

100
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,748
Gotta go from here.

101
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:28,375
We need to walk and find someplace,
somebody who can help us.

102
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,002
- Okay, but ...
- We have to!

103
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:34,255
But if we don't find a place in 10 minutes,
we are running back to this car.

104
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,028
We came ...

105
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:08,321
We came from over here, I swear.

106
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,824
How do you know?
All the trees look the same.

107
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:22,581
Leaving the car
was the stupidest idea.

108
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:24,749
We would have been waiting for hours, Jenny.

109
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:27,793
Yeah we could have been waiting
and it would not be freezing cold.

110
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:31,921
We need to go find help, Jenny.

111
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:35,006
Seriously find help?
How are we going to find help out here, Lindsay?

112
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:38,718
You agreed to come along, Jenny.
This is not just my fault.

113
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:40,928
I didn't want to stay in the car by myself.

114
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:42,595
We just got a little lost, okay?

115
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:45,347
- A little lost, Lindsay?
- Yes!

116
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:46,348
We are not a little lost!

117
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:48,142
We're really lost!

118
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,685
You know what, Lindsay?
I'm no longer walking.

119
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:52,477
I'm tired of walking, okay?

120
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,604
- Jenny, I'm trying!
- Trying what?

121
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:57,606
- Lindsay, we've been down here for like an hour Okay!?
- Yeah I know!

122
00:11:57,606 --> 00:12:00,316
I'm tired and I'm cold.
I'M NOT MOVING!

123
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:01,985
- I'M NOT MOVING!
- Stop it.

124
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:02,860
No!

125
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,111
- Fine!
- Fine!

126
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:05,029
Fine.

127
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,321
- I'm staying right here.
- Good.

128
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,618
What is it?

129
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:17,454
My God is that a...

130
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:19,080
Is it a house?

131
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:20,956
Jenny!

132
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:22,124
Jenny, look!

133
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:23,875
I think it's a house!
I swear!

134
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,003
- It's a light! Let's go.
- What?

135
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:27,836
Let's go!

136
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:31,756
OH! FOR SOME REASON I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

137
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:42,847
Oh thank God!

138
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,474
Come on!

139
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:03,904
Hello!

140
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:05,447
Anybody home?

141
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,116
Let's go to the front door!

142
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:12,868
Hello!

143
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:19,165
-Hello?
-Lindsay!

144
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,290
Come here!

145
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:25,628
- God!
- What?

146
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:26,379
Look at the dog!

147
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,630
- What about him?
- I don't like dogs.

148
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,006
I know you don't like dogs.

149
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:37,928
- Hello?
- Is anybody home?

150
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:42,348
See somebody?

151
00:13:42,348 --> 00:13:42,973
No.

152
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,020
Hi.

153
00:13:58,442 --> 00:13:59,860
- Hi.
- Hi.

154
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:02,821
We got a flat tire.

155
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,072
Can we come in ?

156
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:07,157
Can we use your phone so we
can call the car company service?

157
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:09,993
Are you alone?

158
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:11,577
Yes.

159
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:12,828
We're alone.

160
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,376
Come in.

161
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:52,898
Have a seat.

162
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,748
You're tourists?

163
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:21,085
- We're on a road trip through Europe...
-It's a vacation.

164
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:22,045
We're from New York.

165
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:33,011
Can you call the emergency car service?

166
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:34,928
For us ...

167
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,474
Are you relatives?

168
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:43,101
- No.
- No, we're friends.

169
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:48,813
Very well.

170
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,442
I'll make your phone call.

171
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:55,109
Okay, thanks.

172
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:57,111
Something to drink?

173
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:01,781
- Water is fine.
- Yeah, just water.

174
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,967
Hello.

175
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:32,220
This is Dr. Heiter.

176
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:35,013
Sorry to call you so late.

177
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:40,350
But I've got two girls from New York
here with car trouble.

178
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:41,601
Well ...

179
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,895
At least he's calling the car company.

180
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:47,271
That's just great.

181
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,649
Yes, thanks a lot.

182
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:51,608
Bye.

183
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,029
Here you go.

184
00:16:57,612 --> 00:16:58,822
Water ...

185
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:00,990
Water ...

186
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,040
They will arrive in half an hour.

187
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,501
Maximum.

188
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,354
You have a a really lovely home.

189
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,647
You live here with your wife?

190
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:50,734
No.

191
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:57,155
I don't like human beings.

192
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:01,950
God damn it!

193
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:02,993
Be careful, will you?
Stupid cow.

194
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:04,535
I'm sorry.

195
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:12,541
Is there something wrong
with your eyes? Idiot.

196
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,792
I'll get you another one.

197
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,003
- No, it's okay, it's okay.
- We can share.

198
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:20,714
I'll fetch a towel.

199
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,636
What just happened?

200
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:28,761
I don't know.

201
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:36,183
We need to get out of here right now.

202
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:36,850
Yeah.

203
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:39,644
It's freaking me out.

204
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:17,088
You want to just call a taxi
so we can go back to the hotel?

205
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:18,046
Let's go back to the hotel, okay.

206
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:20,465
- We'll get the car in the morning.
- Okay. Yeah.

207
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:27,679
I am really tired.

208
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:10,875
Listen, If you could just call a taxi service,
we're just going to go back to the hotel.

209
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,545
No. I don't do another phone call.

210
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:20,049
Can I call them then?

211
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,258
No.

212
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:22,634
- I'm tired.
- What?

213
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,219
I'm tired.

214
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:26,971
What's going on?
Look at me.

215
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:28,263
It's a rape drug.

216
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:30,473
What?

217
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:32,808
Rohypnol.

218
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:33,309
Oh my God! What!?

219
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:39,813
It causes drowsiness, dizziness,
disorientation and memory loss.

220
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:42,565
Are you kidding!?
What have you done?

221
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:45,609
Jenny!
Oh God!

222
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:46,610
What is it?

223
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,908
Jenny.

224
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,328
Jenny.

225
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:00,789
Jenny!

226
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:06,126
Jenny!
Jenny, wake up!

227
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:07,252
Jenny!

228
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:10,838
Oh God!

229
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:16,050
Jenny.

230
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,301
Lindsay!

231
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:22,221
Jenny!

232
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:33,438
What's happening?

233
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,147
What are you doing?

234
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:36,857
What's this?

235
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:40,067
What the fuck are you doing to us?

236
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:42,277
What are you doing?

237
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:43,778
Jenny!

238
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:45,487
Let us out!

239
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:02,583
My friend ...

240
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,712
You don't match.

241
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:11,298
I have to kill you.

242
00:24:25,391 --> 00:24:27,351
Don't take it personally.

243
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:31,395
What's this?
What are you doing to us?

244
00:24:34,064 --> 00:24:37,566
What is this?
Stop!

245
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:41,653
Jenny!

246
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,426
Who the fuck are you?

247
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:19,432
What is this?

248
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:23,143
Untie me, God damn it!

249
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,523
What are you doing?

250
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:32,359
Untie me.

251
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:34,318
Who the fuck are you?

252
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:35,152
Please ...

253
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:39,197
What are you doing?

254
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:47,327
It's going to be okay.

255
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:49,704
The Japanese possess
unbelievable strength

256
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,956
when backed into a corner.

257
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:57,918
The Japanese possess
incredible strength

258
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,711
when backed into a corner.

259
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:30,775
I'm Dr. Joseph Heiter.

260
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:41,116
Retired but still very well known as
the leading surgeon separating siamese twins.

261
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,201
You're a crazy Nazi.

262
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:45,828
I'll get you,
you dirty German madman.

263
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:47,287
In six months...

264
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:51,707
I designed a never seen operation,
not separating anymore...

265
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:53,083
But creating.

266
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,586
I transformed my three rottweilers

267
00:28:57,586 --> 00:29:02,423
into a beautiful three hound construction.

268
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:03,840
Good news!

269
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:06,968
Your tissues match.

270
00:29:07,217 --> 00:29:08,218
So ...

271
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:15,307
I will explain this spectacular operation
only once.

272
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:18,017
We start ...

273
00:29:18,768 --> 00:29:22,687
With cutting the ligament patelar.

274
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:25,522
Also known as the ligament of the knee caps.

275
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:29,358
So knee extension...

276
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:32,486
Is no longer possible.

277
00:29:33,195 --> 00:29:35,738
Pulling from "B" and "C"...

278
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:41,076
The central incisors,
and lateral incisors and canines.

279
00:29:41,076 --> 00:29:42,576
From the upper and lower jaws...

280
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:46,079
Shut your mouth and untie me!

281
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:49,207
The lips from"B" and "C"...

282
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:53,209
and the anus of "A" and "B"...

283
00:29:53,959 --> 00:30:00,547
are cut circular along the border
between buttock and rectum.

284
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:05,551
The mucus retains so.

285
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:10,596
Two pet acellular grafts
are prepaired

286
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:16,017
and lifted from the underlining tissue.

287
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,606
The shape incisions.

288
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:26,942
Below the chins, of "B" to "C"...

289
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:30,152
Up to their cheeks.

290
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:35,948
Connecting the circular skin parts...

291
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:38,574
Of anus and mouth.

292
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:42,661
From "A" to "B"
and  "B" to "C".

293
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:44,663
Connecting...

294
00:30:44,663 --> 00:30:50,083
The pet acellular grafts
to the chin/cheek incisions  .

295
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:53,419
What are you babbling about?

296
00:30:53,544 --> 00:30:55,129
You really think
you'll get away with this?

297
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:57,046
Creating...

298
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,299
A siamese triplet...

299
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:02,759
Connected...

300
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,886
By the gastric system.

301
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:09,639
Ingestion by "A"...

302
00:31:10,472 --> 00:31:13,891
Passed through "B"...

303
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:18,812
And excretion by "C".

304
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:26,026
A human centipede.

305
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,737
First sequence.

306
00:31:41,745 --> 00:31:43,580
Here's your breakfast...

307
00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:45,539
Hey, wait a minute.

308
00:31:46,081 --> 00:31:48,459
General anesthesia.

309
00:31:57,006 --> 00:31:58,466
Please stop!

310
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,983
Lindsay!

311
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,109
Jenny...

312
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:46,208
I want my mom!

313
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:04,471
Have you gone mad?

314
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:05,597
Come here!

315
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,852
No!

316
00:33:57,092 --> 00:33:58,343
<i>Open up!</i>

317
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:00,469
Please!

318
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:04,931
Stop!
Why are you doing this?

319
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:08,142
Open!

320
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:11,936
You need help!
You're a sick man!

321
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:15,647
I am a sick man.

322
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:17,148
<i>HAHAHAHAHA!</i>

323
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:22,193
If you do not open immediately I will...

324
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:25,779
Cut your knees...

325
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:30,282
<i>And pull your teeth out
one by one!</i>

326
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:32,367
<i>... Without anesthesia.</i>

327
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,410
<i>It's your choice!</i>

328
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,622
Open the door!

329
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,375
<i>Open the door!</i>

330
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:25,405
Stop!

331
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,576
No!

332
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,489
Please!
Please!

333
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:28,784
Why are you doing this?

334
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:31,160
Let me and Jenny go!

335
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,287
Please!

336
00:36:33,996 --> 00:36:35,872
We'll give you anything!

337
00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:39,125
Anything you want,
just let us go!

338
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:43,544
Don't worry...

339
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:46,046
It's only a tranquilizer.

340
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:51,341
Keep your head very still.

341
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:56,262
I don't want to lose one of your precious eyes.

342
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:32,288
Just kill me!

343
00:37:35,248 --> 00:37:36,582
Ahh...

344
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:55,971
One of my rottweilers
tried to flee...

345
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:58,806
Just before the operation.

346
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:01,600
After I caught him...

347
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,852
He had to take the middle position.

348
00:38:05,353 --> 00:38:06,312
In this position...

349
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:08,188
The healing pains...

350
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:12,024
Are twice as intense.

351
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:16,861
Do you already regret your little escape?

352
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:20,364
In fact I'm thankful for it.

353
00:38:21,406 --> 00:38:26,743
Because now I know definitely,
you are...

354
00:38:26,743 --> 00:38:30,704
the middle piece!

355
00:38:31,747 --> 00:38:34,958
Just kill me now.
I'd rather be dead.

356
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:38,502
Game over.

357
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,206
Damn.

358
00:39:32,957 --> 00:39:35,417
Power is cut off again..

359
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:37,252
Sorry!

360
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:38,253
Damn!

361
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:17,825
I'm so sorry.

362
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,539
Help!

363
00:49:12,747 --> 00:49:16,333
My sweet centipede...

364
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:25,130
Looks good.

365
00:49:27,091 --> 00:49:29,467
Healing well...

366
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:38,057
Your suffering will be over soon.

367
00:49:38,057 --> 00:49:40,642
You're in a lot of pain, I know.

368
00:49:45,854 --> 00:49:46,938
Nice.

369
00:49:49,648 --> 00:49:51,525
Okay.

370
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:53,442
Better and better...

371
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:56,861
My Lead...

372
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,072
My Lead.

373
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,323
Hey man...

374
00:50:02,157 --> 00:50:03,491
Hey man...

375
00:50:05,243 --> 00:50:07,411
Come on up.

376
00:50:07,494 --> 00:50:08,870
Stand up.

377
00:50:08,954 --> 00:50:10,372
You can do it.

378
00:50:11,914 --> 00:50:12,790
Up...

379
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:17,835
Come on up!
Up Up Up!

380
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:21,421
Yes, come on up!

381
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:22,880
Here...

382
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,923
Up!
Yeah, like that!

383
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:30,803
Very good!
Yeah!

384
00:50:30,803 --> 00:50:32,804
I DID IT!

385
00:50:35,556 --> 00:50:38,683
Do you really think
you're God?

386
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:00,365
Make it all go away, please.

387
00:51:08,747 --> 00:51:14,792
Stop this.
Stop it now.

388
00:52:28,762 --> 00:52:32,264
How dare you lock us up here?
You crazy idiot.

389
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:41,646
You'll regret this,
you filthy asshole.

390
00:52:41,771 --> 00:52:45,774
European madman.

391
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:51,529
God damn, let us out!

392
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,200
Take the newspaper and bring it to me.

393
00:53:58,452 --> 00:54:00,453
Yeah, good boy.

394
00:54:04,748 --> 00:54:05,873
Come...

395
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:08,709
Come!

396
00:54:16,213 --> 00:54:19,425
Bring me the newspaper...

397
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,095
Good boy.

398
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,140
Come!

399
00:54:29,974 --> 00:54:31,266
Come!

400
00:54:41,315 --> 00:54:45,026
Then let's walk a little.

401
00:54:46,277 --> 00:54:47,570
Attention!

402
00:54:48,779 --> 00:54:50,864
What the hell are you doing?

403
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:55,992
One, two, three, four.

404
00:54:56,117 --> 00:54:58,369
Just die!

405
00:55:07,709 --> 00:55:09,543
Enjoy your meal.

406
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:35,187
That's what you get.

407
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:39,190
I'm not your goddamn dog.

408
00:55:39,315 --> 00:55:41,400
I'm not a dog.

409
00:56:02,832 --> 00:56:05,959
You do this once more and I guarantee...

410
00:56:06,835 --> 00:56:11,505
I'll pull your teeth out
one by one...

411
00:56:11,547 --> 00:56:15,549
you kamikaze shit hole.

412
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,578
You want to bite me?

413
00:56:58,246 --> 00:57:00,665
Now you can bite me.

414
00:57:01,665 --> 00:57:03,834
Bite my boot...

415
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:06,210
Bite my boot!

416
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:08,712
Bite my boots!

417
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:15,050
Mister kamikaze is a chicken today.

418
00:57:24,182 --> 00:57:27,601
Do you get off on this?

419
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:33,939
How dare you
turn your back to me?

420
00:57:45,405 --> 00:57:46,365
Shit...

421
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:48,699
I have to shit...

422
00:57:48,783 --> 00:57:51,993
I'm so sorry.

423
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,411
Forgive me.

424
00:57:54,954 --> 00:57:56,705
AHAHAHAHAHAH!

425
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:00,749
Feed her!
FEED HER!

426
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:07,421
Swallow it bitch!

427
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:09,256
Swallow!

428
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:18,762
Feed her!
FEED HER!

429
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:56,248
I want to sleep...

430
00:58:57,498 --> 00:59:00,209
I have to sleep.

431
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:04,753
Why didn't I cut your vocal cords?

432
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,383
If you don't shut up...

433
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:19,389
We will do a follow-up operation.

434
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:24,518
Finally! You want to move your ass.

435
01:00:24,769 --> 01:00:26,687
That's fine with me.

436
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:33,943
Maybe you can even escape.

437
01:00:46,868 --> 01:00:49,370
<i>Come!
Come!</i>

438
01:00:50,371 --> 01:00:52,373
After you, please.

439
01:01:13,346 --> 01:01:18,558
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

440
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:23,019
I'll teach you to mind me!

441
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,785
Strong...

442
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,413
Good.

443
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:58,044
Constipated...

444
01:01:58,044 --> 01:02:00,838
Laxatives.

445
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:04,549
Instant kind,
good stuff.

446
01:02:33,069 --> 01:02:36,780
End section, you are very sick.

447
01:02:38,531 --> 01:02:41,117
I think you're dying...

448
01:02:41,117 --> 01:02:43,869
I will have to replace you.

449
01:03:05,843 --> 01:03:07,344
Help!

450
01:03:07,385 --> 01:03:09,845
Shut up!

451
01:03:16,934 --> 01:03:18,268
Hello?

452
01:03:18,352 --> 01:03:21,229
Police. We want to talk to you.

453
01:03:21,354 --> 01:03:23,688
Just a second.

454
01:03:31,236 --> 01:03:32,445
Help!

455
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:34,154
Help us, please!

456
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:35,864
We're in the cellar!

457
01:04:23,648 --> 01:04:25,150
Hello...

458
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:27,818
Good day Mr. Heiter...

459
01:04:27,901 --> 01:04:28,861
Police...

460
01:04:29,027 --> 01:04:31,070
This is my colleague Voller.

461
01:04:31,237 --> 01:04:33,197
And I'm Detective Kranz.

462
01:04:33,281 --> 01:04:34,281
May we come in a moment?

463
01:04:34,447 --> 01:04:37,199
Of course.

464
01:04:39,034 --> 01:04:40,244
Come in.

465
01:04:40,327 --> 01:04:42,704
Thank you.

466
01:05:18,354 --> 01:05:21,273
Take a seat.

467
01:05:24,942 --> 01:05:27,068
How can I help you?

468
01:05:28,653 --> 01:05:31,739
Sir, people are missing.

469
01:05:31,822 --> 01:05:35,450
Their vehicles were found
in your neighborhood.

470
01:05:35,575 --> 01:05:38,535
Perhaps you could tell us more...

471
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:42,830
I'm afraid you've come
to the wrong house.

472
01:05:42,997 --> 01:05:47,625
I'm so busy at the moment
with my research and writing...

473
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:50,294
... That I hardly leave the house.

474
01:05:50,377 --> 01:05:54,505
Can I offer you something
to drink?

475
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:56,381
Do you have coffee?

476
01:05:56,465 --> 01:05:59,884
I'm afraid I don't have time
for coffee.

477
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:02,803
I have only water.

478
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,002
Mr. Kranz...

479
01:06:49,169 --> 01:06:50,962
Thank you.

480
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:00,678
Mr. Voller...

481
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:12,436
So tell me,
what do you want to know?

482
01:07:12,602 --> 01:07:17,648
Well we know you're
a first-rate surgeon...

483
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:19,607
... And we don't want
to disturb you.

484
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:23,360
But our investigation
has hit a dead end.

485
01:07:23,527 --> 01:07:25,529
We're not here to arrest you
but you are a suspect.

486
01:07:25,695 --> 01:07:30,198
I expect you have
your reasons.

487
01:07:30,365 --> 01:07:33,534
But I have neither the time,
nor the patience...

488
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:38,621
... For the banality
of missing persons.

489
01:07:38,705 --> 01:07:40,622
What is that cage
being used for?

490
01:07:40,706 --> 01:07:42,374
Could you get to the point?

491
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:47,169
A witness heard
an American woman...

492
01:07:47,252 --> 01:07:50,463
... Screaming on your property.

493
01:07:50,629 --> 01:07:54,299
Can you explain that?

494
01:07:54,382 --> 01:07:57,468
Absolutely not.

495
01:07:57,551 --> 01:08:01,137
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

496
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,639
Your silver-colored Mercedes
was seen...

497
01:08:03,806 --> 01:08:08,184
... At the place where the abandoned
Dutch truck was found.

498
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:12,228
What do you think?

499
01:08:12,395 --> 01:08:16,023
You think there's a connection?

500
01:08:16,106 --> 01:08:19,317
The nerve you guys have
to suspect me!

501
01:08:19,484 --> 01:08:24,362
Finish your drinks
and get out of my house!

502
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:28,032
I have work to do!

503
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:29,866
Drink up!

504
01:08:29,949 --> 01:08:33,577
Come on.
Drink up now!

505
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:38,247
Hurry up!

506
01:08:48,046 --> 01:08:50,047
You will regret that!

507
01:08:50,214 --> 01:08:52,132
I'll see you in court...

508
01:08:52,216 --> 01:09:00,721
... And you can count
on being fired.

509
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:08,769
My apologies, I'm sorry.

510
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,979
I'm overworked...

511
01:09:12,146 --> 01:09:14,065
I don't get enough sleep.

512
01:09:14,148 --> 01:09:17,983
I'll just get a towel.

513
01:09:37,331 --> 01:09:41,209
Help us!

514
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:44,628
We're in the cellar!

515
01:09:51,007 --> 01:09:56,845
Dear Josef,
don't stress yourself.

516
01:09:57,011 --> 01:09:58,638
Everything will be okay...

517
01:10:02,433 --> 01:10:06,602
I've got two strong and healthy replacements.

518
01:10:09,229 --> 01:10:11,480
So enjoy...

519
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:15,233
... Your last moments with the Jen tail...

520
01:10:15,942 --> 01:10:22,739
... Because when I'm back,
I'm mercy killing you.

521
01:10:23,448 --> 01:10:26,908
I'm going to prepare for a new operation...

522
01:10:26,908 --> 01:10:29,618
A quadruplet!

523
01:10:31,287 --> 01:10:33,288
See you...

524
01:11:42,587 --> 01:11:45,464
What's in that cellar?

525
01:11:45,589 --> 01:11:50,134
Now you're going too far.

526
01:11:50,301 --> 01:11:53,553
Well what's in there?

527
01:11:53,762 --> 01:12:00,100
My laboratory, a small workroom,
a torture chamber.

528
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:02,560
You're making a fool
of yourself.

529
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:04,478
Can we take a look around?

530
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:08,356
No way.

531
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:14,985
My research is off-limits
to you.

532
01:12:15,152 --> 01:12:17,278
Do you have a search warrant?

533
01:12:17,404 --> 01:12:20,198
I can have one in 15 minutes.

534
01:12:20,364 --> 01:12:23,033
I'll ask you again:
What's in the cellar?

535
01:12:23,117 --> 01:12:27,661
What you're doing is illegal,
as you should well know.

536
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:30,622
Shall I call the police?

537
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:34,749
As soon as you have a warrant,
you can look where you like.

538
01:12:43,548 --> 01:12:44,590
What's this?

539
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:47,467
That...

540
01:12:47,634 --> 01:12:48,968
That's insulin.

541
01:12:49,135 --> 01:12:53,346
I have diabetes.

542
01:12:58,183 --> 01:13:04,312
We'll be back in 20 minutes
with a search warrant.

543
01:13:04,438 --> 01:13:09,358
If you want to waste
taxpayers' money,

544
01:13:09,442 --> 01:13:11,818
that's your call.

545
01:13:25,745 --> 01:13:28,538
See you soon.

546
01:14:50,263 --> 01:14:51,806
Come on, we have
to get out of here.

547
01:14:51,931 --> 01:14:55,100
One, two.

548
01:14:55,183 --> 01:14:56,393
Okay?

549
01:14:56,559 --> 01:14:59,603
One, two.

550
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:01,647
One.
Two.

551
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:05,066
One.

552
01:15:05,149 --> 01:15:06,775
Two.

553
01:15:06,858 --> 01:15:08,110
One.

554
01:15:08,276 --> 01:15:09,610
Two.

555
01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:11,279
One.

556
01:15:11,445 --> 01:15:12,445
Two.

557
01:15:12,529 --> 01:15:13,571
Come on...

558
01:15:13,613 --> 01:15:15,282
One.

559

Goddamn!

598
01:18:09,447 --> 01:18:11,448
God!

599
01:19:17,455 --> 01:19:21,624
... Eye for an eye...

600
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:26,586
... Tooth for a tooth.

601
01:20:13,787 --> 01:20:17,956
Hey "God..."

602
01:20:17,997 --> 01:20:22,668
Are you God?

603
01:20:22,834 --> 01:20:29,047
I'm just a puny insect...

604
01:20:29,214 --> 01:20:36,761
I cast out my parents,
left my child...

605
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:40,305
Dismissed their love
and led a selfish life...

606
01:20:40,472 --> 01:20:43,724
... Just like an insect.

607
01:20:43,891 --> 01:20:47,227
No, my existence is even lower
than an insect's.

608
01:20:47,352 --> 01:20:51,355
But...

609
01:20:51,438 --> 01:20:56,150
But dear "God..."

610
01:20:56,316 --> 01:20:59,611
That's how I've lived!

611
01:21:03,321 --> 01:21:07,533
And this is my punishment!

612
01:21:09,994 --> 01:21:15,122
I want to believe...

613
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:24,712
... That I'm still a human being.

614
01:21:28,631 --> 01:21:30,508
Hey girls...

615
01:21:30,675 --> 01:21:34,886
Hey "God..."

616
01:21:34,969 --> 01:21:37,221
What a fucked up world we're living in...

617
01:23:34,513 --> 01:23:35,973
Police!

618
01:23:36,056 --> 01:23:37,141
Dr. Heiter, police!

619
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,420
Dr. Heiter...

620
01:24:55,446 --> 01:24:57,406
Well, God damn it...
