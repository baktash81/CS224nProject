1
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,680
It's hard to believe,

2
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,348
but we have come to the end
of another week

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,649
of Seattle pulse!

4
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,084
We still have a minute left,

5
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,320
and you all know
what that means.

6
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:24,423
I will answer as many questions
as you can throw at me

7
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,624
in 30 seconds.

8
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,726
Caller one, you're on.

9
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:31,663
I have two words--
"natural metallics."

10
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,132
Spring sale at shoe inc.

11
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,333
Caller two!

12
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:35,567
Best steak house
for the in-laws

13
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:36,635
coming in
from Pittsburgh?

14
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,103
Well, that's a no-brainer.

15
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,472
Make sure to ask
for a patio table.

16
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,540
Caller three!

17
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,109
Local wine to serve
with sea bass?

18
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,712
Chateau St. Michelle
chardonnay, 2006.

19
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,081
All right, that is it
for Seattle pulse,

20
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,282
the heartbeat of the city.

21
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,650
This is Emma silver,

22
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,751
reminding you
to smell the coffee,

23
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,119
drive carefully,

24
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,321
and, of course,

25
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,123
join us again on Monday.

26
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,591
Hey,
great show.

27
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,360
Thanks.

28
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:02,795
You got a sec?

29
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:03,796
For you, ed, always.

30
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,066
Well, I'll just
cut to the chase.

31
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,668
We are now part of
the worldmedia merger.

32
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,472
I'm not really sure
I like the sound of that.

33
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,707
Read my lips,
nothing's going to change.

34
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,277
Well, how can you be so sure?

35
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,511
Kbmu's been around
for 40 years.

36
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,847
They're not going to tamper
with success.

37
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:25,117
I uprooted my life in New York
to move here for this job.

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,552
I know.

39
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,253
I invested my savings
in a condo.

40
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,688
Understood.

41
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,191
I have a dentist,
I have a hairdresser,

42
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:33,325
I have a nail salon

43
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,294
that actually
understands my cuticles.

44
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,328
Are you done?

45
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,365
I have a three-year
iron-clad contract.

46
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,735
"Nothing's going to change"
did you miss?

47
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,337
Enjoy your weekend.

48
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,472
I'll do my best.

49
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:47,840
See you later.

50
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,441
Emma, you have
a call on line two.

51
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,743
He said
it's important.

52
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,846
Hello.

53
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:57,282
Yeah, this is Emma silver.

54
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,795
Ed...

55
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,430
Hey.

56
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,699
I...

57
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,800
I-I got a call,

58
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,168
and I won't be in
on Monday.

59
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,369
I have to go
to valleyville.

60
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,506
My grandfather died.

61
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,341
Aw, geez, Emma.

62
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23,509
I'm so sorry.

63
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,676
So I'm going to make

64
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,679
a... list of, encore shows

65
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,814
for you to air while I'm away--

66
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,782
okay, don't worry.

67
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,484
I'll take care of things here.

68
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,420
You just do what
you have to do?

69
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,856
I'm so sorry.

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Is it supposed to rain?

71
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:48,961
That's what
they're saying.

72
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:49,828
I don't think so.

73
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,662
Anybody know?

74
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,563
I'm not sure, though.

75
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,770
Hey there, hon,
are you lost?

76
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,305
I think I have
the wrong address.

77
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,740
I'm looking for a law office.

78
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,542
Well...

79
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,877
You must be Emma.

80
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,246
Hi.

81
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,480
My condolences.

82
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,948
I'm Bobby Ellis.
I called you.

83
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,585
I thought you said

84
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,320
that you were
an attorney?

85
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,624
But a man has to have
a lot of irons in the fire.

86
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:20,859
If you want to
follow me,

87
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,728
my office is
out back.

88
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,597
So that's Walt's
granddaughter?

89
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,698
Are you out of
your mind?

90
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,866
Walt's granddaughter
used to come up here

91
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:31,903
she had short hair
and freckles.

92
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,272
When she was
12, maybe.

93
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,439
12, wasn't that
about the time

94
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,841
you learned to read?

95
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,577
Don't make me
hurt you, Hank.

96
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,845
It's funny, we've
lived here 15 years.

97
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:43,382
Never laid eyes on her,
have we, Jeff?

98
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:44,316
Yeah, she stopped
coming by

99
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,384
after the accident.

100
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,551
What accident?

101
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,552
Her folks.

102
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,820
Real good people.

103
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,722
No, no, no,
not good people.

104
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,959
Emma was away
at college,

105
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,495
and they were coming
in from the city

106
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,930
no, no, it was
Thanksgiving.

107
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,499
Their anniversary's
in the summer, fool--

108
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,566
whatever!

109
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:02,901
Anyway,
there was a storm,

110
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,737
and their car
missed a curve...

111
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,472
It was real tragic.

112
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,408
Yeah...

113
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,809
Okay, I think this is...

114
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,778
Yup, Walt silver...

115
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,746
The file.

116
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,916
So...

117
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,585
How do I go about
making the arrangements?

118
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,455
Well, there's no need.

119
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,556
As soon as Walt
found out he was sick,

120
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,891
he took care of
everything.

121
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,794
He left a very specific
set of instructions.

122
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,462
I didn't even know
that gramps was ill.

123
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,531
For the last six months, yeah.

124
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,766
If he'd told me,
I would've been here.

125
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,668
Emma, you were
very precious to Walt.

126
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,903
He bragged about you
all the time,

127
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:41,406
about your radio show
and all your success.

128
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,474
He even
showed me albums

129
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,676
of the trips
you took together.

130
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,478
Bobby, I really appreciate you
telling me this,

131
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,479
but still--

132
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,914
well, you know
what they say...

133
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:52,551
"Nothing drags heavier
than a big old sack of regret."

134
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,853
Walt went out
on his own terms.

135
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,822
You got to
respect that.

136
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,390
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

137
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,927
Your grandfather wanted
a very simple funeral,

138
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,628
followed by a hearty lunch
back at the farm

139
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,596
for all of his friends.

140
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,798
He even specified
the menu.

141
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,867
Fried chicken,
garlic mashed potatoes,

142
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,469
corn on the cob,

143
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:11,603
and, of course,

144
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,805
pumpkin pie for dessert.

145
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,542
Yeah, that...

146
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,978
Wow, that sounds like him.

147
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,879
I'll take care of it.

148
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,647
There's no need.

149
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,982
The ladies are cooking up
a storm as we speak.

150
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,817
Services are Monday at noon.

151
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,789
Now, if you
can just sign...

152
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,657
These,

153
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,659
I can officially
hand over the keys.

154
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:36,795
The keys?

155
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,699
To the farmhouse?

156
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,568
He left me the farm?

157
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,804
You're his next of kin.

158
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:49,574
I don't actually know
what to do with a farm--

159
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,910
there's...
Something else.

160
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,845
There it is.

161
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:58,984
This...
Is for you too.

162
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,823
What are they?

163
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,925
They're pumpkin seeds.

164
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,995
Walt's
pumpkin seeds.

165
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,630
Why would he leave me these?

166
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,932
Maybe he wanted you to enter
the pumpkin growing contest,

167
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,834
keep the tradition going,
so to speak.

168
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:20,839
I-I don't know anything
about pumpkins.

169
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,040
You're
Walt's granddaughter.

170
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,609
It's in your genes.
It's part of your DNA.

171
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,844
Yeah, well,

172
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:26,878
there's a missing link
somewhere.

173
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,013
And this is
for you as well.

174
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,755
He always called me Emmy-Lou...

175
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,991
You can call me
if you have any questions.

176
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,928
<i>"Dearest Emmy-Lou...</i>

177
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,031
<i>You're probably</i>
<i>not too pleased with me</i>

178
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,899
<i>for foisting the farm on you,</i>

179
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,001
<i>but here's the thing...</i>

180
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,571
<i>This land,</i>
<i>small though it may be,</i>

181
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:53,772
<i>is my legacy,</i>

182
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,708
<i>mine and grandma Eleanor's.</i>

183
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,544
<i>Every seed</i>
<i>was planted with love.</i>

184
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,881
<i>Every tree grows with</i>
<i>a bit of our souls in it.</i>

185
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,951
<i>I just can't go to my maker</i>

186
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,119
<i>thinking it will be razed</i>
<i>to become a highway</i>

187
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,889
<i>or a parking lot.</i>

188
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,991
<i>I know you're not a farmer,</i>

189
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,027
<i>but I also know</i>
<i>how smart you are.</i>

190
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,663
<i>"...To make sure</i>

191
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,965
<i>the place goes to someone</i>

192
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,569
"I'm counting on you
to take care of the things

193
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,073
that I couldn't take care of.

194
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:32,077
I love you, my sweet girl..."

195
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,711
Hey, boys.

196
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,979
Hey.

197
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,952
Seth, it's been over a week.

198
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,787
When's my tractor
going to be ready?

199
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,689
You ready to pay me?

200
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,724
You know
the answer to that.

201
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,893
How about Betty bakes you
a couple of her delicious pies?

202
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,862
My freezer's already full
of Betty's pies.

203
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,097
I need cash, guys,
so I can open my shop.

204
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,633
So that I can earn the cash
to pay you.

205
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,801
Yeah,
right.

206
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,970
Well, you
figure it out.

207
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,205
You know, this is why
mighty muffler's

208
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,840
going to put you
out of business.

209
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:39,144
Yeah, but mighty muffler
isn't going to have

210
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,980
my flexible pay-as-you-can
schedule, are they?

211
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,749
But at least
I'd have my tractor.

212
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,850
Whatever,
it's done.

213
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:46,985
It's behind
the barn.

214
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,019
What?

215
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,956
Why didn't you just
tell me in the first place?

216
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,224
At least I can have a little fun
watching you squirm.

217
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:58,096
Seth, take a look
at this thing.

218
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,864
Seems to be missing
something under here,

219
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,067
I don't know.

220
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,005
Well, for a couple
of your pumpkin seeds,

221
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,740
I will.

222
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,843
I don't think I have any
to, spare this year.

223
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,646
I need that prize money.

224
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:15,647
Russell, how about you?

225
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,015
Well, no offense,

226
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,884
but I can't share
my winning seeds.

227
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,886
Why don't you ask your
new neighbor over there?

228
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,989
Walt's
granddaughter.

229
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,091
Now, she's got seeds.

230
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,093
Really?
Walt's seeds?

231
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,862
Yeah, and we all know
what that means.

232
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,998
Gigantic
pumpkins.

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,966
Monsters.

234
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,868
I might have to
check that out.

235
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,137
Okay, let's see,
what do we got here?

236
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,978
Okay, it's
good as new.

237
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
Obliged.

238
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,016
You know, Russell,

239
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,785
that boy's a lost ball
in tall weeds.

240
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,916
Hello, hi, there's someone
outside my house.

241
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,052
It's the silver farm.

242
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,153
Route 7.

243
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,921
Can you please hurry?

244
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,068
Stay where you are.
I have mace.

245
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,070
And I have wd40.

246
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,772
Okay...

247
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,308
Who are you,
and what are you doing?

248
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,011
I'm fixing the lock,
and I'm your neighbor.

249
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,979
I'm going to stand up now,
nice and slow.

250
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,748
Okay?

251
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,816
I'm Seth Cullen.

252
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,184
I live next door.

253
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,020
The junkyard?

254
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,021
Yeah.

255
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,390
Home sweet home.

256
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,259
Hi.

257
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,962
Emma silver.

258
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,900
So, do you always break
into people's houses?

259
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,902
Well, do you always threaten
to mace your visitors?

260
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,238
I'll have you know

261
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,874
that this is
a very sensible precaution

262
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,376
for a woman who lives alone.

263
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,811
Well, maybe
you haven't noticed,

264
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,047
but these aren't exactly
the mean streets.

265
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,915
Okay, you could have knocked.

266
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,150
I did knock.
You didn't answer,

267
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,085
and that lock's been jammed
for weeks,

268
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,020
and I fix things,
you know?

269
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,388
It's what I do.

270
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,891
Okay, um....

271
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,025
Well, I'll just
get my purse, then.

272
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,160
How much?

273
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,095
For what?

274
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,998
The lock.

275
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,969
Nothing, I'm just...
Trying to be neighborly.

276
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:54,072
Okay, well, thank you, then.

277
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,040
You're welcome, then.

278
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,144
You know what,
actually,

279
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,980
since I'm here,
um...

280
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,015
You expecting
somebody?

281
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,084
Sort of.

282
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,121
Quinn?

283
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,157
You called Quinn?

284
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,992
Everything
okay here?

285
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,927
I got a call about
a disturbance.

286
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,462
Yeah.

287
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,897
I was mistaken.

288
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,398
I believe
the technical term

289
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,066
is "paranoid."

290
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,002
And I believe
the legal term

291
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,270
is "breaking and entering."

292
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,372
I was fixing
your lock.

293
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,940
Well, who asked you to?

294
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:32,143
Your grandfather, actually.

295
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,211
We were friends.

296
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:36,014
We helped
each other out.

297
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,015
And on that note,
I think we'll just

298
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,316
call it a night,
won't we, Seth?

299
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,385
Yes, we will.

300
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:45,023
Welcome to
the neighborhood, Emma.

301
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,972
Nice service, father.

302
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,140
Just the way Walt
would have liked it.

303
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,042
Short and sweet.

304
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,361
It is so nice of you all
to do this, Mrs. Burns.

305
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,530
Mrs. Burns
is my mother-in-law, honey,

306
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,332
and we don't mention her
while we're eating.

307
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,067
You call me Marie,

308
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,168
and it is
our pleasure.

309
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,503
This whole town
loved your grandpa.

310
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,909
Kimmy, more
rolls, honey.

311
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,979
Good to see you made it
through the night.

312
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,213
Do you have
enough food?

313
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,148
Because there's
a feedbag by the barn.

314
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,918
Well, I'll keep that in mind
when I go back for seconds.

315
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,321
Did I mention
that I do auto repairs?

316
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,190
Because that little
BMW of yours

317
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,524
could probably use
a tweak.

318
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,026
German cars
are always over-tuned.

319
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:59,030
Why do I get the feeling that
you want something from me?

320
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,965
Well, as a matter of fact--

321
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,467
is Seth
bothering you?

322
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,168
He has a habit
of doing that.

323
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,236
Just like Bobby
has a tendency

324
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,071
to run off
at the mouth.

325
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,273
Can I talk to you
in private?

326
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,140
Sure, yeah.

327
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,041
Thanks.

328
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:14,913
In his letter,

329
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,281
gramps refers to

330
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,049
"things he couldn't
take care of".

331
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,385
Do you know
what he meant by that?

332
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,287
Your grandfather was in debt.

333
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,255
Serious debt.

334
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,092
Gramps was as sensible
as they come about money.

335
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,360
True,

336
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,196
and at the time,
it seemed sensible

337
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,098
to take out a small mortgage
on the farm

338
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,466
when things got tough,

339
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,567
and when they got tougher,

340
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,102
he took out
a second,

341
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,704
and then your grandma
got sick...

342
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:40,972
Well, he just
always thought

343
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,507
he'd catch up.

344
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,341
How much?

345
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,109
75,000.

346
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,279
75,000!

347
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,150
I need to get
back to Seattle.

348
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,721
Okay, how much
time do I have

349
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:58,222
to come up with
the money?

350
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,224
Well, the notes
come due in November,

351
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,160
and then if it isn't dealt with
by the end of the year,

352
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,528
the bank will foreclose.

353
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,597
I can take the equity
out of my condo,

354
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,266
but that still won't even
come close.

355
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,501
Who is the bank manager
around here?

356
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,636
Kyle finster.

357
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,971
He's also the mayor.

358
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,172
Perfect.

359
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,140
I will talk to him
first thing tomorrow.

360
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,643
He's out on the front porch
stuffing his face.

361
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,212
You don't sound
too fond of him.

362
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,313
Let's just say

363
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,382
that finster never
dipped his toes

364
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,651
in the milk
of human kindness.

365
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,253
I'm sure that
I can reason with him.

366
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,456
Well, you would be
the first.

367
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,557
So, mayor finster,

368
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,058
I'm sure you can see

369
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,527
how counter-productive
it would be to foreclose.

370
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,062
I may need
a bit of time,

371
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,697
but I'm sure I'll find
the right buyer.

372
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,467
We already found
the right buyer.

373
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:43,534
You do?
Who is it?

374
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,036
Well, I'm not
at Liberty to say,

375
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,237
but let me assure you,

376
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,605
it all comes under the umbrella

377
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,174
of the growth incentive
for our fair town.

378
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,576
I have a feeling

379
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,611
we're not talking about
a local farmer.

380
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,147
Well, I did say
"growth incentive."

381
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,649
Mighty muffler,

382
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,052
subdivision, condos,
that sort of thing?

383
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,387
Exactly.

384
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,790
Well, the bank can't
do anything

385
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,158
until November, right?

386
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,193
It'll be here
before you know it.

387
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,795
More chicken,
mayor?

388
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:14,132
Don't mind
if I do.

389
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,466
Ooh, just...

390
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,347
Hi, um...

391
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,548
Look, I know
this may not be

392
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,418
the best time
or place, but...

393
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,153
I will give you $100 each

394
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,287
for a couple
of your pumpkin seeds.

395
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,588
What?

396
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,458
But it's really
all I can spare right now.

397
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,161
I'm a little busy right now.

398
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,662
Okay, 110.
That's final offer.

399
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,768
That went well.

400
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,804
That was a great
send-off for Walt.

401
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,172
We'll be seeing
you around.

402
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,307
Thank you.

403
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,543
Bye.

404
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,511
You make sure
you call me.

405
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,448
I will.

406
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,649
Bye, thank you.

407
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,583
You're welcome.

408
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,656
<i>...what a super day!</i>

409
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,492
<i>This is Savannah grace,</i>

410
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:18,663
<i>and you're listening to</i>
<i>Savannah's super Seattle!</i>

411
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,265
<i>It's the first day</i>
<i>of my new show,</i>

412
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,834
<i>and we are going to have</i>
<i>an amazing time--</i>

413
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,169
Hello!

414
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,872
Emma...

415
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,141
Remember I told you
how nothing's going to change?

416
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,443
Ed, my show!

417
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,845
As I've just been fired,

418
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,680
I think I may have been
misinformed.

419
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,814
Wait, what?
How?

420
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,416
I-I don't understand.

421
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,884
<i>I think you'll</i>
<i>find your answers</i>

422
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,652
<i>from the new</i>
<i>station manager.</i>

423
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,388
You'll find her
in my former office.

424
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,456
Great working with you, Emma.

425
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,258
<i>Best of luck,</i>

426
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,494
<i>...come on, people,</i>
<i>black is so yesterday.</i>

427
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,561
<i>Let's talk about pink.</i>

428
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,130
<i>You cannot not love pink.</i>

429
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,333
<i>Pink is, like,</i>
<i>the best color in the world.</i>

430
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,268
You have got
to be kidding me.

431
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,603
<i>Savannah loves you!</i>

432
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:08,813
Enter!

433
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,682
Ms.
Rinaldi-Rogers, I..

434
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,584
Emma silver,
of course.

435
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,320
I'm so sorry about
your grandfather.

436
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,488
Um, thank you.

437
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,423
Actually, I'm here
just because i--

438
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,925
you must know
Savannah grace.

439
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,261
We've never met.

440
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,930
Sorry, I'm actually
late for an interview.

441
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,798
It was awesome to meet you.

442
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,302
Awesome meeting you, too.

443
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,672
Why Savannah's on the air
and you're not.

444
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,942
Well, actually,
I'm more than wondering.

445
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,945
I just thought
that all of this could wait

446
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,780
until after you returned.

447
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,449
How much I value
your contribution here.

448
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,551
Shall we walk?

449
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:47,818
So, what
is going on?

450
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,221
The new kbmu
is all about youth.

451
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,656
Savannah's been on
three magazine covers

452
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,859
she is the face
of young America.

453
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,460
Okay, but we're
on the radio.

454
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,929
I was speaking
metaphorically.

455
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,397
I'll speak
literally.

456
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,899
My show's ratings
have gone up 33%

457
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,401
in the last
six months.

458
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,269
Yes, but that 33%
doesn't consist of

459
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,671
the demographics
we're aiming for,

460
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:09,273
which is the
18 to 24 year-olds.

461
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,708
So that's why
I'm being replaced?

462
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,976
You're not
being replaced.

463
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,277
You're being
reassigned...

464
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,478
Reassigned?

465
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,348
Yeah, to "green
is the new black."

466
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,783
Okay, what is that?

467
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,685
It's the program
that was formerly titled

468
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,753
"the garden gal."

469
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:25,323
You mean that really
boring gardening show

470
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,958
that no one listens to?

471
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,461
But we're going to bring it
into the 21st century.

472
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:31,596
Our market research
indicates

473
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,599
is very popular
with the younger demo.

474
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,834
I-I don't know anything
about gardening.

475
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,402
Well, you didn't know
anything about Seattle

476
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,503
when you got here,

477
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,938
but you figured that out
for the "pulse."

478
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,273
This is ridiculous.

479
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,674
I won't do it.

480
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,376
I have an iron-clad
three-year contract.

481
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,844
Your contract
is with the station,

482
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:47,912
not the program.

483
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,014
We're
reassigning you.

484
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,383
That sounds like
a terrific plan.

485
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:55,519
Let's just force your
on-air talent to do a show.

486
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,989
I mean, I might as well
broadcast from my tractor.

487
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,958
You own a tractor?

488
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,662
Technically, yeah,
on my farm.

489
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,697
You have a farm?

490
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,766
Temporarily, yes.

491
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:09,667
That's perfect!

492
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,869
That's the angle
I've been looking for.

493
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,638
We'll broadcast from your farm!

494
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,440
It's not in the middle
of nowhere, is it?

495
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,776
Um, it's where farms tend to be,
out in the country.

496
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,311
Where exactly?

497
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,846
About three hours from here--

498
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:22,813
that's beyond perfect!

499
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,449
So that the fans can watch it
on their computer!

500
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,784
18-to-24 year olds
will love it!

501
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,320
You'll be like Rachael ray,

502
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,521
except on the radio,

503
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:31,722
and not as peppy.

504
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:35,459
Okay, let's just hold on
for a second here, all right?

505
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,728
You literally
just thought of this idea

506
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,863
two seconds ago.

507
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,298
I mean, it's not
a done deal,

508
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,365
right?

509
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,867
Of course not.
I'm not insane.

510
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,335
Thank god.

511
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:45,569
For a second there
I thought that--

512
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,071
we'll do a test
run of six months.

513
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,840
Broadcast twice in a week,

514
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,310
and syndication
all across the country.

515
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,413
Okay, you have to be joking.

516
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,881
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

517
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,349
Go, go back
to your little farm.

518
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,850
Get busy.

519
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,454
We'll do a trial run
on Wednesday,

520
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,456
and broadcast on Saturday.

521
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,590
Ta ta!

522
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,870
You're putting
a webcam in the house?

523
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,906
Nobody said anything
about inside the house.

524
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,374
Take it up
with management.

525
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,878
Okay, where are
the others?

526
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,448
Well, there's one
right there,

527
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,549
one up there,

528
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,616
and another one
over there,

529
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,884
and we've got
three outside.

530
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,653
Now, they're all
placed and activated

531
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,822
to pick up anything you do
within a hundred yards.

532
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,359
So anybody with a computer
can just tune in and watch?

533
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,860
Kind of creepy?

534
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,895
Extremely.

535
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,764
All right, well,
here's a rig

536
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,499
in case you need to do
a remote broadcast,

537
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,001
and, good luck
with your show tomorrow.

538
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,931
This just gets
better and better.

539
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:53,831
Get your Bobby's blended!

540
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:57,902
It's a magical blend
of ingredients for you, sir!

541
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,437
Well, hello.

542
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,038
Hey... Bobby.

543
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,773
So, what's going on?

544
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,909
This is
the pumpkin parade.

545
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,710
Be well, Emma!

546
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:10,948
Hey...

547
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,616
So you, 
change your mind

548
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,685
about the, 
pumpkin seeds yet?

549
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,487
What is it with you
and the seeds?

550
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,955
The mighty muffler
chain is opening,

551
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,892
so I need to open
my own shop to compete.

552
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:26,497
To open my own shop
here on main street.

553
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,832
That's your
business plan?

554
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:28,833
A pumpkin?

555
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:29,834
Seth, Seth...

556
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,869
Seth, sorry,
my lawn mower's starter--

557
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:32,937
hey, whoa, whoa,
hold on a sec.

558
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,839
Emma, I will give you $200

559
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:35,906
for one pumpkin seed.

560
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,007
Think about it.

561
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,542
Think about it,
200 bucks.

562
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:39,677
Emma!

563
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,811
Ooh!

564
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,813
Get your skinny
butt over here...

565
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,849
I just got back
from Seattle.

566
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:48,953
Any of you think you can grow
a big pumpkin this year?

567
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:55,860
Now, I mean a big,
orange, monstrous gourd!

568
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,762
A pumpkin so big

569
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,764
that when people see it,

570
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,766
they will hide their children

571
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,902
and scream for their mommas!

572
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:06,904
I've been hearing
that same speech

573
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:07,905
all my life,

574
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,840
and it still
gives me the chills.

575
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,843
And how many of you
really speak pumpkin?

576
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,579
Who is this guy?

577
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:16,714
Al, one of
the original

578
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,748
big pumpkin growers,

579
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,883
along with
your granddad.

580
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,819
During the contest,
keeping things kosher.

581
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,053
This is a great day
for your town,

582
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,789
but it's also a day

583
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:29,793
to remember someone
who was close to our hearts.

584
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,996
Walt silver.

585
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:36,934
Now, Walt was a hell
of a pumpkin grower.

586
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,004
But most of all,

587
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:43,674
he was a good friend
to all of us.

588
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:46,010
So I would like

589
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,778
to dedicate
this year's contest

590
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,080
to Walt silver!

591
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,988
And Walt must be
smiling down on us,

592
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,924
because this year's winner

593
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:02,693
will go home...

594
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,895
With this!

595
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,830
$25,000?

596
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,098
I like the sound of that.

597
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:13,904
The pumpkin almanac
will double the $25,000

598
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,674
if anyone beats the world record

599
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:20,844
of 1,878 pounds!

600
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,916
$50,000?

601
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,117
I'd like to get
my hands on that.

602
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,118
I'll say.

603
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,019
Yeah, dream on,
sweetheart.

604
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,221
Are you ready?

605
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,890
Yeah!

606
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,825
Ten...

607
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,961
Nine, eight, seven...

608
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:39,964
Six, five...

609
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,832
Four, three...

610
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,801
Two, one!

611
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,742
I can do this.
It's in my genes.

612
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,978
What is?

613
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,779
I am going to grow
a giant pumpkin

614
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,848
and collect
that prize money.

615
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,025
This is like reading Chinese,

616
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:08,859
underwater,

617
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,295
with a blindfold on...

618
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:16,800
Who is it?

619
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,902
It's your neighbor!

620
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:21,005
Seth Cullen!

621
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,940
I pre-announced myself
with a knock,

622
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:26,043
followed by a friendly exchange
of pleasantries.

623
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,113
I'll let
myself in.

624
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,949
Of course you will.

625
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,187
So,

626
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,089
if you are here about the seeds,
the answer is still no.

627
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,991
A-ha.

628
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,260
Well, I found this
by your mailbox.

629
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,728
It's got a Seattle postmark.

630
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,829
Ooh, great.

631
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,164
I've been
waiting for this.

632
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:51,802
I see you're adjusting
to the country life.

633
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,303
And I saw
the trucks outside.

634
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,905
What are you doing,
a reality show

635
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:55,906
or something
like that?

636
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,875
Survivor,
valleyville?

637
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,943
I'm broadcasting
my radio program

638
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,245
from the farm.

639
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,880
Nice.

640
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:03,914
What are you
going to talk about?

641
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,917
The earth...

642
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,118
Flowers...

643
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,154
Animals, growing things.

644
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,922
I see,

645
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,791
and do you know anything
about those things?

646
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,359
Yes.

647
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,127
You know,
it's been really lovely

648
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,796
chatting with you like this,

649
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,998
but I've got to get back to,
you know...

650
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,932
Okay.

651
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,735
Okay, 300 apiece.

652
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:25,369
What?

653
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:29,139
Like I said before,
they aren't for sale.

654
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,974
Besides, I need them.

655
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,009
For what?

656
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,877
Well, i'm
going to enter

657
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,914
the growing pumpkin
contest myself.

658
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,115
Why in the world
would <i>you</i>

659
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,917
want to do that?

660
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,919
Because I like challenges.

661
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,220
You like challenges.

662
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,356
All right, let me just make sure
I got this straight.

663
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,959
You are going to plant those
little seeds in the ground,

664
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,094
you're going to nurture
them, protect them,

665
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,795
watch them grow
to unbelievable sizes,

666
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:52,930
and then you're going to
haul them off

667
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:53,931
to the contest,
is that it?

668
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:55,132
Is that your plan?

669
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,835
Yes, and I
intend to win.

670
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,204
And you thought my
business plan was flawed.

671
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,371
Right, well,

672
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,440
it was really nice
speaking with you.

673
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,908
Hey, my pleasure.

674
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,311
To hear what you have to say
on your radio show

675
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,012
about growing things.

676
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:09,980
Should be very educational.

677
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,122
<i>This is Emma silver</i>

678
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,290
<i>coming to you from</i>
<i>the all new, eco-friendly</i>

679
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,993
<i>"green is the new black" show!</i>

680
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,162
We're going to be broadcasting
for the next six months

681
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:26,396
from valleyville, Washington,

682
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,433
<i>scenic home</i>
<i>of giant pumpkins.</i>

683
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,936
Right, now, I know that usually
on shows like this,

684
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,438
the host goes on and on,

685
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,207
<i>but I want to hear</i>
<i>from you listeners.</i>

686
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,976
<i>What do you have to say</i>
<i>about gardening,</i>

687
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,978
<i>mother earth,</i>

688
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,913
<i>and anything you like</i>
<i>that's green,</i>

689
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:43,981
<i>because as we all know...</i>

690
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,016
Green is the new black.

691
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,451
All right,
all lines are opened.

692
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,453
<i>888-555-4845.</i>

693
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,058
All right, caller one,

694
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,093
you're on.

695
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:57,227
What do you want to tell us?

696
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,063
<i>I have a question.</i>

697
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:03,433
<i>Wonderful. S</i> hoot.

698
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:06,904
<i>How do I tell if</i>
<i>a mushroom is, like, poisonous?</i>

699
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,939
<i>You know, I have, </i>

700
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:12,075
<i>often asked myself</i>
<i>that very same thing, and...</i>

701
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:15,012
Seems like
there's a lot of options.

702
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,013
<i>I know.</i>

703
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:19,283
<i>And we're going to make,</i>
<i>like, soup.</i>

704
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,051
No! No, no, no,
don't do that.

705
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:24,121
Not until you've consulted
a professional.

706
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:25,289
<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>a professional.</i>

707
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,992
<i>Right...</i>

708
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,895
<i>Okay, so,</i>
<i>in my professional opinion,</i>

709
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,231
<i>I would just throw</i>
<i>all of the mushrooms away</i>

710
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,066
<i>and go to the supermarket.</i>

711
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,101
<i>I recommend</i>
<i>mom's organic mushroom soup.</i>

712
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:42,005
Very tasty, low sodium.

713
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,040
Okay, next caller.

714
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:48,045
Wh-what would you
like to share with us?

715
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:49,079
<i>I don't know.</i>

716
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:52,049
<i>I have a question, though.</i>

717
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:52,883
Another question.

718
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:53,951
Of course, okay.

719
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,986
What is it
you would like to know?

720
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:58,922
<i>Are dragonflies dangerous?</i>

721
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,057
Just a moment...

722
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,326
<i>Are you looking it up?</i>

723
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:06,196
<i>Yes, you are.</i>
<i>I can see you!</i>

724
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,067
Busted!

725
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,035
<i>No, i-I'm just checking</i>
<i>on the nitrogen content</i>

726
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,538
<i>of a new potting mix</i>
<i>that's about to hit the stores.</i>

727
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,039
<i>I mean, come on,</i>

728
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,342
<i>don't you people know</i>
<i>how to multi-task?</i>

729
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,444
<i>Okay, next caller.</i>

730
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,349
Sorry, we'll have to deal with
organic mulch next time,

731
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,918
because our time is up.

732
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,519
All right, this is Emma silver,

733
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,321
reminding you
to smell the coffee,

734
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:32,990
drive carefully,

735
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:36,026
and, of course,
join us again on Monday.

736
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,597
Unbelievable.

737
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,370
<i>Unbelievable</i>
<i>how time flies by</i>

738
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:49,239
<i>when you're doing</i>
<i>such a fascinating show.</i>

739
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,074
<i>Bye!</i>

740
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,256
Hello.

741
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,324
Well, that was a disaster

742
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,426
to rival
the sinking of the Titanic.

743
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,596
Who forced me to do
this stupid show.

744
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,231
<i>Are you</i>
<i>going to quit?</i>

745
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,699
Not in this lifetime!

746
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:17,968
Well, then, the only other
option you have

747
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,136
is to get better.

748
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:20,437
Fast.

749
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,205
I'll be listening on Monday.

750
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,347
Go away!

751
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:31,381
We'll go away...

752
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,584
Eventually.

753
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,390
Girls...

754
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,592
Nice!

755
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:44,962
Hello...

756
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,463
Hi, hi, hi.

757
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:50,067
Aw, we heard
your broadcast.

758
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:50,968
Figured
you might need

759
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,202
a little cheering up,

760
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,470
and these are
just in case

761
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,604
our sparkling
personalities

762
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,139
don't do the job.

763
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,175
Should we
come back later?

764
00:32:58,177 --> 00:32:59,376
Are you kidding?

765
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,111
The corkscrew's
in the kitchen drawer,

766
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:02,679
and the glasses
are on the top shelf.

767
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,581
All right, girl!

768
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,417
This farming stuff
isn't that hard.

769
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,620
That's the last
of Walt's seeds.

770
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,056
Onto the growing lamps.

771
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,257
Follow me, girls.

772
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,697
There...

773
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,201
So that's what
that thing is for.

774
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,238
You want to
keep the soil

775
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,706
at 82 degrees.

776
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,441
You don't want
the seeds to dry out.

777
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,577
How do you know
all of this stuff?

778
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,045
Jeff grew
the damn things

779
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,580
till I put
my foot down.

780
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:38,281
He used to keep
the seeds in the bathtub

781
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,717
underneath
an electric blanket.

782
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,586
I couldn't even
bathe our own kid.

783
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,454
That's nothing.
Russell sold my car last year

784
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,090
so he could buy a forklift
to haul his pumpkins around.

785
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,793
Hank sleeps in the field
with his pumpkins,

786
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,094
arthritis and all.

787
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,729
Okay, that is just crazy.

788
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:57,334
The whole giant pumpkin thing
is an obsession.

789
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,069
Last year,
some maniac drilled a hole

790
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,137
into the champion
pumpkin,

791
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,304
stole the seeds.

792
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,774
Pumpkins are
like thoroughbreds.

793
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:07,310
You have to write
the parents down.

794
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:08,678
Okay, this just gets
freakier and freakier.

795
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,583
Mother nature never intended
for these puppies

796
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:14,618
to grow so big.

797
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,186
They are fragile!

798
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:20,057
They can grow 30,
40 pounds overnight.

799
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,392
One tiny little crack...

800
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,460
Blaam!

801
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,229
It's all over.

802
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,330
But the cryin'!

803
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,502
So are we done for now?

804
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,337
You'll wish we were.

805
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,173
We have to sing to them.

806
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,542
Excuse me?

807
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:40,410
It's what
your grandpa did.

808
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,213
It's pretty strange,
but it worked for him.

809
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:46,183
Any particular song?

810
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,451
Yeah, afraid so.

811
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,220
Betty?

812
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:06,636
Come on,
girl, sing!

813
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:12,642
they can't
hear you!

814
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,327
I cannot
thank you all enough.

815
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,429
I just wish
we could tell you more,

816
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,264
but, you know, our guys
are pretty tight-lipped

817
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,432
about their pumpkins.

818
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:36,600
The journal!

819
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:37,667
That's right!

820
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:38,702
What journal?

821
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:41,538
He carried it everywhere
during the season,

822
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,841
it had all of his
growing secrets in it.

823
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,376
Okay, what does it look like?

824
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:47,511
A brown book

825
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,279
with a soft
leather cover.

826
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,214
It's about, um,
this big,

827
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,884
and, honey,
it is filled with secrets.

828
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,960
Hello?

829
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:38,595
<i>Your yankee</i>
<i>doodle serenade</i>

830
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:40,897
is a YouTube sensation.

831
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:44,568
The website's had
over 100,000 hits already

832
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,835

833
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,270

<i>that freaky giant</i>
<i>growing-pumpkin thing.</i>

835
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:52,409
I totally forgot
about the webcams.

836
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:53,910
<i>I'm going to build</i>
<i>an advertising campaign</i>

837
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,445

838
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,247
You're doing what?

839
00:36:57,249 --> 00:37:00,483
Yup, "Emma silver
grows the big one!"

840
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,319
I can see it on buses,
park benches,

841
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,453
<i>magazines...</i>

842
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:04,854

let's just take a step back.

844
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,258
<i>Now, make sure</i>

845
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,859
the show focuses on the contest.

846
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:14,731
The world will be watching,

847
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,733
<i>Ciao!</i>

848
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,936
Great...

849
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,507
One more thing.

850
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,413
Oof, what?

851
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,581
It's too early for this.

852
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,550
You're going in the drawer.
That's it.

853
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,463
Yes...

854
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,639
No, this can't be right...

855
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:06,850
You found
the journal.

856
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:08,618
Yup, that's the good news.

857
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,719
The bad news is,

858
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,321
I can't understand it.

859
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:12,422
What? Why?

860
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:15,592
"She looks to the sun.

861
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,327
"Her skin is pale
those first days,

862
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,495
"but glows more strongly

863
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:20,397
with each ray."

864
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,565
It sounds
like poetry.

865
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,868
I know Walt
wrote poems.

866
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,703
"She is wind
and water.

867
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:28,905
Love her like
there is no other."

868
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,473
It's code.

869
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,375
Pumpkin
poetry code.

870
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,811
Walt did love his pumpkins.

871
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,547
He called them
his orange ladies.

872
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:40,617
Okay, how do I break
this pumpkin code?

873
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,852
I don't know.
Let me look?

874
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,355
"She is hungry for your kiss.

875
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:46,656
"Feed her

876
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,925
with the bounty
of your being."

877
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,428
I'd say that's about manure.

878
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:54,764
It's divided into months,

879
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,599
so is that the key?

880
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,869
I have no idea.

881
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:07,711
So, that's Walt's famous
pumpkin Bible?

882
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:09,646
What does it say
to do next?

883
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:13,683
She puts her bare feet
in the warm soil."

884
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,718
Sounds like
it might be time

885
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,486
to plant them
outside soon.

886
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,888
Yeah, maybe.
Thanks.

887
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,889
You're welcome,

888
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,624
but that is
the last free advice

889
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,792
you're going to get,

890
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,795
unless you would
like to partner up?

891
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,931
In case you
haven't noticed,

892
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,866
we don't exactly
get along that well.

893
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,769
Well, we don't have to,
to grow pumpkins.

894
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,970
I need to do this
on my own.

895
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,972
Okay, I hear you.

896
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,807
Although there are
certain things

897
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,642
that can be better

898
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,845
when you do them
with someone else.

899
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:42,946
We're talking
about pumpkins.

900
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,447
I'm talking
about pumpkins.

901
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,515
Unless...

902
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,917
You're not talking
about pumpkins.

903
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,824
So, folks,
thank you for your Patience

904
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,460
while we get
the kinks worked out,

905
00:39:57,462 --> 00:40:00,964
and for following along
via webcam as...

906
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:04,701
Emma grows the big one.

907
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:07,771
<i>Okay, as you can see,</i>
<i>my plants are doing great.</i>

908
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,407
<i>All right, let's go outside,</i>

909
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:15,912
where I will be transplanting
my little plants

910
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,448
<i>any day now,</i>

911
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,717
<i>somewhere right around...</i>

912
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,018
Here!

913
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,888
All right, this is Emma silver,

914
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,822
reminding you
to smell the coffee,

915
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,957
drive carefully,

916
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,893
and, of course,
join us next time.

917
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:31,895
<i>Bye!</i>

918
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,541
Hey, Seth!

919
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:45,642
Hey, Bobby.

920
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:46,776
I'm taking a load
of my special blend

921
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:47,944
over to Emma's.

922
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,979
Well, I'm sure
she'll be appreciative.

923
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:52,215
Yeah, well,
it's been forever

924
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,817
since we had
any sophistication

925
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:56,820
so I want to impress her
with the good stuff.

926
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:58,588
Right.

927
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,624
Well, if a truckload of manure
won't do it, Bobby,

928
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,892
I don't know what will.

929
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,060
Thanks, buddy!

930
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:06,996
Good luck.

931
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:27,884
Hey, Bobby,
what have you got there?

932
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:30,019
Well, I have
a surprise for you.

933
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,554
I love surprises.

934
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,723
Well, then, you are
going to love this.

935
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,558
This is
Bobby's blend supreme.

936
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,894
And I throw in a little
bit of bat guano

937
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,996
to give it
that extra kick.

938
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:40,864
That's great.

939
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:43,500
You don't have to worry
about it or anything.

940
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:45,969
I left a big old pile of it
in my living room

941
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:49,939
and there wasn't even
a trace of toxicity or stench.

942
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:53,977
Wow.

943
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:56,513
That is just
so nice of you.

944
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:57,580
Yeah...

945
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:58,882
It's all for you.

946
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,818
Thanks.

947
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:09,759
Now, that
is romantic.

948
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,095
I see Bobby brought
you his gift.

949
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,997
Yeah...

950
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,000
What am I supposed
to do with it?

951
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:18,935
I can think of
a few things.

952
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:21,604
Walt tilled it into
the ground, though.

953
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,741
How?

954
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,009
With his tiller.

955
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:29,078
It's in the shed.

956
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,857
You know...

957
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,926
It's probably
out of gas.

958
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:44,827
You knew
it was out of gas!

959
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,796
I suspected.
Big difference,

960
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:47,997
but I'll
tell you what.

961
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,566
I'll start it
for you.

962
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,801
Then all you
got to do is steer.

963
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,970
The tiller
will do the rest?

964
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:55,638
And...

965
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,040
Don't let the cameras
make you nervous.

966
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,843
Although...

967
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:02,078
My offer still stands.

968
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,880
You want to partner up,

969
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,949
I'll take care of
all the machinery,

970
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:08,985
the tiller, tractor,
all that stuff.

971
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,055
Partnering up as in
splitting the prize money?

972
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:13,890
Yeah, that sounds fair to me.

973
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,658
Not interested.

974
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,960
Besides,
I don't really need you.

975
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:19,095
I have secret
growing information.

976
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,864
Yeah,
I'm sure you do.

977
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:24,000
Okay...

978
00:43:26,972 --> 00:43:27,971
You're doing great!

979
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,140
Ooh...

980
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:35,645
You broke
the casing.

981
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:36,813
You bent the blades,

982
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:38,147
you broke
the fuel line,

983
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,983
not to mention
the fence.

984
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:43,019
No, I'm fine, it's okay,
thank you for asking.

985
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:47,023
Come on, face it,
you do need me.

986
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:47,857
So, are we going to
partner up or what?

987
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:49,926
Over my dead body.

988
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:54,097
I don't think that's
going to take very long...

989
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,200
I'll get the tiller!

990
00:43:57,202 --> 00:43:58,868
Come on, Marie.

991
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,137
No, they won't.
I'm bringing the beer.

992
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,905
You play
poker, Emma?

993
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:04,907
I know my way
around a deck.

994
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,777
Brought
some new blood.

995
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,178
Hey, everyone.

996
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,016
You know, if you play
the way you till,

997
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:14,851
this could make for

998
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:16,052
a very interesting evening.

999
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,120
No, come on in, join us.

1000
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:19,055
Please.

1001
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,931
I fold.

1002
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,800
This brie
is heaven, Emma.

1003
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:31,868
Not as good
as the gouda, though.

1004
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,071
Only thing you know
about cheese is cutting it.

1005
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:37,140
Okay, that's enough, boys.

1006
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:39,075
I'm out.

1007
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:41,010
Okay, slick,

1008
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,011
I will raise you...

1009
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,880
Two.

1010
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:45,848
I re-raise you...

1011
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,984
Two.

1012
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:51,020
Well, you know
what they say...

1013
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,188
I'm out.

1014
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:57,794
All right, call.

1015
00:44:57,796 --> 00:44:59,195
Okay,
let's see--

1016
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:01,898
She got
you, buddy!

1017
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,332
Got smoked?

1018
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:04,834
Our city girl knows
what she's doing.

1019
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:07,170
Yeah, well, I paid
most of my college tuition

1020
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,871
from playing poker.

1021
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,006
That's funny,

1022
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:11,841
'cause I spent most
of my time studying.

1023
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,009
You went to college?

1024
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:15,011
Yeah, I went
to college.

1025
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:15,878
Stanford.

1026
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,013
Engineering,
actually.

1027
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:19,015
Really?

1028
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:21,818
I would think
that a Stanford man

1029
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,219
would play smarter.

1030
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,289
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1031
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,990
Just deal,
it's not that funny.

1032
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:29,225
Wasn't that funny...

1033
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,802
All right,
you two,

1034
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:41,871
what about me?

1035
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:43,306
I know you're bluffing.

1036
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,241
You do?

1037
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,245
I'm out.

1038
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,047
You know, you should
probably fold too.

1039
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,819
I raise you four.

1040
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:58,221
Four?

1041
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,290
Tell you what,

1042
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,992
you want to make this
real interesting?

1043
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,027
What do you have in mind?

1044
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:07,096
I win this hand,

1045
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,898
you and me...

1046
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,266
Pumpkin-growing partners.

1047
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:16,973
And if I win,

1048
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:18,374
you do all of my tractor work,

1049
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:20,409
my tilling,

1050
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:21,444
and all
the heavy lifting.

1051
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:24,013
No charge, of course.

1052
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:31,454
Yeah, okay,
I'm in.

1053
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,022
Let's see what you got.

1054
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,057
Full house,

1055
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:36,459
Jacks over kings.

1056
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,964
Somebody's working.

1057
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:42,999
That...

1058
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:45,001
That's a really
good hand, yeah.

1059
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:46,068
I have...

1060
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,170
I have two pair.

1061
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,906
I have a pair
of black eights,

1062
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:51,908
and I have this pair
of red eights.

1063
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,916
Well, I guess
that does it...

1064
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:01,384
I'll see you
at sunrise, partner.

1065
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,956
Nice, nice...

1066
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,191
Emma, always a pleasure.

1067
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,231
We are back with
another broadcast

1068
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:16,999
from pumpkin central.

1069
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:21,070
Now, so far,
we have tilled the soil,

1070
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:24,006
and we have transplanted
our seedlings,

1071
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:27,376
so, the lines are open.

1072
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:30,379
Do you have
a pumpkin question for me?

1073
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,081
<i>No, I have one</i>
<i>for your partner, though.</i>

1074
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:36,118
You know what, I'm sorry,
but he's not available.

1075
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,521
<i>I can see him</i>
<i>right behind you!</i>

1076
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,459
<i>This is really important.</i>

1077
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:45,294
Seth?

1078
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,231
Someone needs to talk to you.

1079
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:51,167
Cool.

1080
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:53,135
All right.

1081
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,540
Just put these on?

1082
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:01,143
Hello?

1083
00:48:01,145 --> 00:48:03,045
How can I help you?

1084
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,314
<i>My girlfriends and I</i>
<i>think you're hot!</i>

1085
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:09,118
Well, thank you.

1086
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,320
<i>And we'd like to know</i>
<i>if you're single.</i>

1087
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,055
That is not
a pumpkin question.

1088
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,892
Why, yes, actually,
I am single.

1089
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:17,193
<i>We think you have sexy eyes.</i>

1090
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:19,028
Please.

1091
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,996
He does not.

1092
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:21,063
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1093
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,333
Because I am
sitting right here

1094
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:25,368
looking at him,

1095
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:28,004
and he is...

1096
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,141
Average.

1097
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:33,576
At best.

1098
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,045
<i>You must be blind.</i>

1099
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:38,614
Okay, do you have
a pumpkin question?

1100
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:40,082
<i>Seth, call me at 978--</i>

1101
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:43,286
Hey! That was rude.
She was nice.

1102
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:44,587
Get dates
on your own time.

1103
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:45,621
Okay.

1104
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,356
Caller two,
you're on the air.

1105
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,191
<i>Hi, Emma, it's Bobby.</i>

1106
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:50,326
Hey, Bobby.

1107
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,427
Do you have
a question?

1108
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,262
Yes, I do.

1109
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,530
Are you free for dinner?

1110
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,673
What are those?

1111
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,576
Hey...

1112
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:09,712
Greenhouses.

1113
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:13,249
Yeah, the journal says that

1114
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:14,717
"she enjoys
gentle breezes

1115
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,019
and summer days."

1116
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:21,090
Well, I put a fan
in each of the greenhouses

1117
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:24,060
and each house maintains
a constant 85 degrees--

1118
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:26,629
a nice summer day
temperature.

1119
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:30,032
I guess that makes sense.

1120
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:31,434
Okay, where are you going
in that dress?

1121
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:35,438
I'm, going to dinner
with Bobby.

1122
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,406
Okay--

1123
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:39,375
yeah...
But I actually need you

1124
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:41,143
to help me
with these.

1125
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,511
Okay, I'll help you tomorrow.

1126
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:43,546
Okay.

1127
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:44,747
Okay, no, that's great.

1128
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:46,082
I mean, if you want to
chance the coyotes

1129
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:47,683
getting at
the crop tonight.

1130
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:48,751
Coyotes?

1131
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:50,052
Yeah.

1132
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:56,025
Well, I just thought
that was you.

1133
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:58,394
Um, you know what,
you should've told me before.

1134
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,498
But, um...

1135
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,167
I will help you
first thing tomorrow. Okay?

1136
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,537
Okay.

1137
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:12,174
I mean, if there's
anything left.

1138
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,709
Have fun
at dinner!

1139
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,478
I will!

1140
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,336
Well, Emma, I had
a really good time.

1141
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:42,605
Your choice of wine
was perfect.

1142
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:45,508
My god...

1143
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,509
What?

1144
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:47,610
Coyotes...

1145
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:50,379
Coyotes, coyotes.
We have to scare them off!

1146
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,480
With what?

1147
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:52,581
What are you doing?

1148
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,283
Coyotes!
I have to...

1149
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:55,551
Get out! Scram!

1150
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,189
You maced me!

1151
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:01,457
Okay, what were you
doing there?

1152
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:02,591
I was checking
the greenhouses!

1153
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:05,227
I can't believe
you just maced me!

1154
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,495
Okay, I thought
you were a coyote.

1155
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,364
Coyotes don't eat pumpkins.

1156
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:11,400
No, he said...

1157
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:15,638
You are lucky
it was just mace.

1158
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,705
My bag?

1159
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:17,773
Sure.

1160
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:18,774
Thank you.

1161
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:19,775
I had a really
good time.

1162
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:20,810
Me too.

1163
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:22,178
- Good night.
- Good night!

1164
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:25,748
Seth, you ruined
the end

1165
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,383
of a really
lovely evening.

1166
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:29,452
Bobby, trust me,

1167
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,620
one of these days
you are going to thank me

1168
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,422
for saving you
from that lunatic.

1169
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:35,825
It takes one
to know one, my friend.

1170
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,127
You know
what I don't get?

1171
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:42,198
Why is she so gung-ho
on winning this contest?

1172
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,669
Well, you didn't
hear it from me, but...

1173
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:48,604
Walt's farm's
in big trouble,

1174
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:49,839
and she wants to
pay off the loan

1175
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:53,476
so it doesn't go
to some big developer.

1176
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,413
Good night.

1177
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,271
Hi there.

1178
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:24,673
Good morning.

1179
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:25,808
Are you...

1180
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,476
You going
somewhere, or...

1181
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,711
To your place.

1182
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:31,514
I-I was just going to
leave this on your door.

1183
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:37,686
"Seth, I shouldn't have
maced you.

1184
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,655
I'm sorry."

1185
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,190
Apology accepted.

1186
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:42,525
Actually I was,

1187
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:45,161
just coming over here
to apologize to you,

1188
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:47,796
you know, for the, 
whole coyote thing.

1189
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:51,333
Yeah, why did you
lie about that, anyway?

1190
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:54,470
You wanted to ruin
my date with Bobby.

1191
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:56,438
Why?

1192
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,240
You wouldn't
understand.

1193
00:52:58,242 --> 00:52:59,475
Try me.

1194
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,312
Okay, um...

1195
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:05,848
I was trying to keep Bobby
from getting hurt.

1196
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,451
You thought I would hurt him?

1197
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:10,486
No.

1198
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:12,888
I would.

1199
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:27,670
The sun mixes with the moisture
beading on her skin."

1200
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:29,838
I'm don't think
that means sprinklers.

1201
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,441
I'm telling you,
they need water.

1202
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,426
Finally!

1203
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:51,894
The stop I've been waiting for.

1204
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,462
How are Walt's seeds doing?

1205
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:58,767
And a couple more
back there as well.

1206
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,804
So?

1207
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:04,840
No.

1208
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:07,509
Well, y-y-you don't have
enough pumpkins here

1209
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:08,911
to make a pie.

1210
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,312
They should be
huge by now!

1211
00:54:10,314 --> 00:54:11,947
You should be up
to your knees

1212
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,716
in pumpkins!

1213
00:54:13,718 --> 00:54:14,917
I told you
those greenhouses

1214
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:17,853
well, your singing didn't
help things, did it?

1215
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,655
Okay, this isn't
"American idol"!

1216
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:21,290
Yeah, it's not
American express, either!

1217
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,291
What is that
supposed to mean?

1218
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:23,292
Not everything
can be bought

1219
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:24,260
on a credit
card, okay?

1220
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:27,730
Comes in a ups box
from Seattle or New York--

1221
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,598
quiet down,
you two!

1222
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,899
Now, look,

1223
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:32,568
I'm not supposed to
be giving out advice

1224
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,769
during
the competition,

1225
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,772
so you did not
hear this from me--

1226
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,807
Feed those babies!

1227
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:39,842
They're starving!

1228
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:41,677
More fertilizer?

1229
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:43,412
Truckloads.

1230
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,884
Don't say it.

1231
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:49,918
Told you so.

1232
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,819
Don't say it.

1233
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,821
Hey, Seth!

1234
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:55,424
Could you explain to our
listeners and webcam viewers

1235
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:58,927
<i>what exactly it is</i>
<i>that you're working on?</i>

1236
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:00,863
It's an extreme
nutrient machine.

1237
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:03,832
Okay, can you tell us
how it works?

1238
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:05,868
Thank you.

1239
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:09,838
Why, certainly, Emma.

1240
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,408
You put the raw manure
in there,

1241
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,310
and then the machine
mixes it with water

1242
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:15,811
in there,

1243
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,613
<i>and then</i>
<i>a time-release mechanism</i>

1244
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:19,581
<i>pumps it to the pumpkins.</i>

1245
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:20,949
<i>Right, and how much</i>
<i>manure does it take?</i>

1246
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:22,951
That depends.

1247
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:25,387
How much can you
come up with?

1248
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:26,388
Me?

1249
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,389
Yeah, you.

1250
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:28,557
I do the machines,
remember?

1251
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:31,860
Okay, you know what,

1252
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:32,895
after the show,
I will run down

1253
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:34,897
and get some of
Bobby's blend.

1254
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:37,599
This machine doesn't take
commercial fertilizer.

1255
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:38,967
Only the real deal.

1256
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:40,803
Raw manure.

1257
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:42,771
So, you want me
to collect--

1258
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,907
the latimer farm
just down the road?

1259
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:46,442
Lots of horses.

1260
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:50,612
Have fun.

1261
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,884
So, there you have it, folks.

1262
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:58,854
One more step towards
our march to victory.

1263
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:17,506
You done good.

1264
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:18,674
Really?

1265
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:20,576
I am so pleased.

1266
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:21,944
I mean, I would hate
to have messed up

1267
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,979
collecting horse poop!

1268
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:24,980
Come on,
you want to win, right?

1269
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:25,914
No, I want to
go home,

1270
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,616
all right? To the city.

1271
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:30,819
Where they have movies,
and concerts, and lattes,

1272
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:32,721
and where it actually
smells good!

1273
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,460
Drama queen!

1274
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:51,039
Would you like to go
to the movies with me?

1275
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,810
There aren't any theaters here.

1276
00:56:54,812 --> 00:56:57,646
There's actually
a very elegant theatre

1277
00:56:57,648 --> 00:57:02,885
is this another one
of your coyote stories?

1278
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:04,920
Movie starts
in 20 minutes.

1279
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,857
Okay, I'll go
put my clothes on.

1280
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:09,992
Not on my account.

1281
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:11,827
This better be for real.

1282
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,829
Okay.

1283
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:20,702
<i>John, go,</i>
<i>go on in there.</i>

1284
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:25,908
<i>All you have to remember</i>
<i>is to be sincere--</i>

1285
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,810
this is great.

1286
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:29,812
I told you.

1287
00:57:29,814 --> 00:57:32,581
Okay, you get up,
wander around,

1288
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:33,816
stretch your legs,
whatever.

1289
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:35,951
I got to change
the reel.

1290
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,521
You know, I love
old movies.

1291
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:40,956
Me too.

1292
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,891
Sturges,
Wilder, capra.

1293
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:45,727
Man, they just don't make 'em
like that anymore.

1294
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:47,830
Hey, there, kitty, you lost?

1295
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:50,098
Hungry's
more like it.

1296
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,035
She's yours?

1297
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:55,003
Um... yeah.

1298
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:56,505
Her and...

1299
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:58,607
A couple others.

1300
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:00,476
Okay, actually,
I got five cats,

1301
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:01,743
but don't tell anyone,
all right?

1302
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:04,713
I miss having a cat.

1303
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:05,747
Really?

1304
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:06,882
Really, seriously?

1305
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:09,785
Because a grown man
shouldn't have five cats.

1306
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:12,988
No, um, you know,
I wish I could, but...

1307
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,623
My life right now,

1308
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:15,958
it's just too much
responsibility.

1309
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,860
Right, yes, I know.

1310
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:19,828
I know, this is just
the big stopover

1311
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,197
on your way back
to your other life, right?

1312
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,934
Can I ask you something?

1313
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:27,002
Well, you can ask.

1314
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:30,939
I'm not sure
I'm going to answer.

1315
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,976
Why is a Stanford
engineering grad

1316
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:36,745
making a living
fixing cars and tractors?

1317
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:38,981
Who said
I'm making a living?

1318
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:41,850
You're serious, um...

1319
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,552
Okay, well,

1320
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:47,556
I had a cush job once
at a big firm in L.A.,

1321
00:58:47,558 --> 00:58:50,692
and I had the house
with the pool, and the car,

1322
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:51,827
and the girlfriend,

1323
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:54,830
and the whole thing.

1324
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:55,931
A lot of years flew by

1325
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:57,766
before I finally woke up
and realized

1326
00:58:57,768 --> 00:58:59,134
that I was wasting my life.

1327
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:01,703
And that's when
you came to valleyville?

1328
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,872
Well...

1329
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:07,075
It's home, you know?

1330
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:08,744
I like the honesty.

1331
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:10,078
I like the small town kindness.

1332
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,047
It just...

1333
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,116
It kind of suits me, you know?

1334
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:16,051
What about the girlfriend?

1335
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:20,923
She lasted a whole week
before she ran off screaming.

1336
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:23,191
I'm sure you can empathize.

1337
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:29,932
I seem to remember
Walt saying something

1338
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:34,870
about you having
a boyfriend in New York.

1339
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:36,638
That didn't
work out.

1340
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,839
Why, what happened?

1341
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:40,809
My job.

1342
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:44,012
I got this great offer
in Seattle.

1343
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:45,914
I went, he stayed.

1344
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:49,885
Wow, you must really
love your work.

1345
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,988
I guess what I really love
is talking to people.

1346
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,190
You know, ever since
I was little,

1347
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:57,092
I dreamed of having
my own talk show,

1348
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:01,196
and my parents used to save
the empty paper towel rolls,

1349
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:03,065
and I would use them
as microphones

1350
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:05,667
and interview my Barbies.

1351
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:07,903
I even had a name picked out--

1352
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:11,940
but that would require you
to have friends.

1353
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,943
Come on,
that's a joke.

1354
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,079
No, I know
it sounds stupid.

1355
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:19,114
No, it doesn't sound
stupid at all,

1356
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:20,882
not at all.

1357
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:24,953
I'm sure your parents
would be very proud.

1358
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,021
Thank you.

1359
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:29,925
Well, um, reel's ready.

1360
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:30,892
Let's watch some more movie.

1361
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:34,997
Okay, be prepared...

1362
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:38,133
To be entertained.

1363
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,074
<i>Now, please, John,</i>

1364
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:48,677
<i>you won't let me down,</i>
<i>will you?</i>

1365
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,946
<i>Mother says</i>
<i>good luck, too.</i>

1366
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:53,915
<i>Please, please believe</i>
<i>every word of it.</i>

1367
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:56,084
<i>He turned out to be</i>
<i>a wonderful person, John.</i>

1368
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,854
<i>John Doe,</i>
<i>the one in the speech.</i>

1369
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:02,824
<i>I've actually</i>
<i>fallen in love with him.</i>

1370
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,962
Okay, the ac is off,

1371
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:09,064
so I'm interviewing
valleyville's

1372
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:11,299
pumpkin widow support group

1373
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:13,769
here at Marie's general store.

1374
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,003
So how was
movie night?

1375
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:17,873
Marie,
this is a gardening show.

1376
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:20,042
Okay, so I'll
rephrase that.

1377
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:24,713
Um, did anything bloom
in that barn last night?

1378
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,783
So,

1379
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:28,917
can you ladies
tell me

1380
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:30,986
what you talk about
while you meet?

1381
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,187
Well, basically

1382
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,855
just complain
about our men.

1383
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:34,890
At least Jeff lets
you in the patch.

1384
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:36,792
Yeah, Hank's got his
electrified

1385
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:40,095
<i>I have to toss his lunch</i>
<i>over the fence!</i>

1386
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:42,130
This time of year,

1387
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:43,165
Russell's completely
lost interest in me.

1388
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:45,934
For the orange hotties
in the garden.

1389
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:48,003
Really?

1390
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:50,939
We haven't been on a
vacation in 10 years.

1391
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:52,140
Hank took the blanket
off our bed

1392
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:54,843
<i>and put it on his pumpkin.</i>

1393
01:01:54,845 --> 01:02:00,215
Men, do you hear
what your women are saying?

1394
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,783
Shame on you.

1395
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:02,851
Yeah.

1396
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:03,952
Yeah.

1397
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,156
So, guess what,

1398
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:09,958
Hank and Russell
have invited us

1399
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,259
on a stealth run.

1400
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:13,095
What's a stealth run?

1401
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:14,996
That's when you sneak
into a farmer's patch

1402
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:15,931
to find out
his secrets.

1403
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:17,032
Now, I said no,

1404
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:19,000
because these things
always turn out bad.

1405
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:20,869
Who were they
going to go spy on?

1406
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:22,938
Our not-so-honorable
mayor finster.

1407
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,807
Apparently his pumpkins
are already 1,000 pounds.

1408
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:28,043
1,000 pounds?
We have to go.

1409
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:30,011
Hey, I'm trying to be
the voice of reason here.

1410
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:31,279
Yeah, well, tell that
to mighty muffler.

1411
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:32,380
Let's go.

1412
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:33,949
Good point.

1413
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,820
So, what's the plan?

1414
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:39,921
All right, finster's
at a christening--

1415
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,123
no, no, no,
it's a wedding.

1416
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:42,324
He'll be back
in an hour.

1417
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:43,792
Fine.

1418
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:44,826
So, I'm going to
wait in the truck.

1419
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:45,927
I'll be the look-out--

1420
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,329
it's my truck.
I stay in the truck.

1421
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:48,997
Hank, you'll
fall asleep.

1422
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:51,833
All right, we got to
sneak around the side,

1423
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:54,102
because he's got
surveillance.

1424
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:10,252
Hit the deck!

1425
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:16,057
Now!

1426
01:03:28,005 --> 01:03:29,871
Look at you,
crawling in the dirt.

1427
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:32,174
Keep going.

1428
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:34,042
Yeah, I-I heard you
on Emma's show.

1429
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:36,344
I'm sorry, honey.

1430
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,947
Look, I'll take you
on a cruise, I promise.

1431
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:40,882
Gotta go.

1432
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:41,983
Look at that.

1433
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,052
Let's go check out his barn,

1434
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:45,020
see what he's using.

1435
01:03:45,022 --> 01:03:46,188
All right.

1436
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,322
Now!

1437
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:01,036
He's got nothing but
Bobby's blend here.

1438
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:12,113
I didn't know
finster had a Harley.

1439
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:13,248
Really?

1440
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,885
Wow...

1441
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,186
That's a '91 heritage!

1442
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:21,423
Kitty...

1443
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:22,991
Kitty?

1444
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,360
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty...

1445
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,362
Kitty?

1446
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,034
Hank!

1447
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:35,470
What are you
doing here?

1448
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:37,105
Mayor?

1449
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:38,106
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1450
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,941
Here, kitty--

1451
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:44,546
Hey! Hey!

1452
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:45,981
Nobody move!

1453
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:46,948
Go, go, go!

1454
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,417
Hey!

1455
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:51,019
Don't think I don't see you!

1456
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:55,023
Seth Cullen,
I see you running!

1457
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:56,124
You too, Russell!

1458
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,294
Wait for me!

1459
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:00,495
Ew!

1460
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:01,596
Stay away!

1461
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:03,031
I stink!

1462
01:05:03,033 --> 01:05:04,432
Yeah,
I noticed!

1463
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:09,037
Come on...

1464
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,441
Hey! Hey!

1465
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:16,544
I'm sorry!

1466
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:18,380
Come on!

1467
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:20,048
Man!

1468
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,016
How can you mistake a skunk
for a cat?

1469
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:22,150
I don't know.

1470
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:24,052
All I know is that
everything I do

1471
01:05:24,054 --> 01:05:25,186
ends up with me stinking.

1472
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,389
What are you doing?

1473
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:29,591
Moving upwind.

1474
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:30,926
Look, I told you.

1475
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:32,527
I told you this always
ends badly--

1476
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:35,130
if I had known
there were going to be skunks.

1477
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:36,131
What are you
looking for?

1478
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:37,165
My wipes.

1479
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,934
You are
way past wipes.

1480
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:40,468
And this, this is
just great.

1481
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:43,171
Better and better.

1482
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:44,239
Holy Moses!

1483
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:45,373
Who got hit?

1484
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:47,709
Arrest
these two!

1485
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:49,344
Come on, it was
just a stealth run.

1486
01:05:49,346 --> 01:05:50,545
What's the big deal?

1487
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:53,081
It was
trespassing.

1488
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,983
All right, someone needs
to take me home.

1489
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:56,217
You get in my vehicle,
and I will arrest you.

1490
01:05:56,219 --> 01:05:57,452
I want these two
prosecuted

1491
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,620
to the full extent
of the law.

1492
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:05,360
Come on, you got to be
joking me.

1493
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:08,196
I'm pulling you guys
out of pumpkin patches?

1494
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:11,099
As far as I'm concerned,
she can go free.

1495
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:13,268
She's not stinking up my jail.

1496
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:15,637
Whoa! Jeez...

1497
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:29,084
All right, Kate, it is late,

1498
01:06:29,086 --> 01:06:31,653
and I have had
a hell of a day, so--

1499
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,727
really?

1500
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:42,497
You're kidding me.

1501
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:46,001
Well, yeah, I mean,
of course I'll be there.

1502
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:50,071
Um...

1503
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:52,073
Yeah, I'll ask.

1504
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,483
Thanks for the ride.

1505
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:02,484
Well, well, well.

1506
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:06,454
Is it safe to approach?

1507
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,256
If you like
tomato juice.

1508
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:11,226
So how was
your night in jail?

1509
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:13,094
Well, other than
having to fix two CBS,

1510
01:07:13,096 --> 01:07:14,763
a scanner, and a coffee maker,

1511
01:07:14,765 --> 01:07:16,131
it was very relaxing, actually.

1512
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:17,599
Well, you won't have
to fix anything

1513
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:19,667
at the four seasons.

1514
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:21,102
What?

1515
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:22,404
The station called,

1516
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:25,473
and, we are
number 2 in the market.

1517
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:27,575
That's great!

1518
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:29,778
Congratulations,
that's awesome!

1519
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,580
So they're doing a promo shoot
tomorrow in Seattle,

1520
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:34,382
and a big party
afterwards

1521
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,450
at the hotel.

1522
01:07:35,452 --> 01:07:37,118
Congratulations again.

1523
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:41,222
My boss wants me to bring you.

1524
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,691
Good publicity,
and, well,

1525
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,393
there is a free dinner.

1526
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,328
Well, I never turn down
a free dinner.

1527
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,097
So you'll go.

1528
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:51,066
Well, that depends.

1529
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:52,200
Um....

1530
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:53,635
Who's asking?

1531
01:07:53,637 --> 01:07:56,805
Are you asking,
or is your boss?

1532
01:07:56,807 --> 01:08:00,175
Um... I'm asking.

1533
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:01,743
Then yes.

1534
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:04,646
Excellent.
So it's a date.

1535
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:05,713
Sort of.

1536
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:09,818
"Sort of" works
just fine for me.

1537
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,186
Okay, then.

1538
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:12,654
Okay.

1539
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:14,489
Bye.

1540
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:20,595
Where's the farmer?

1541
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:21,563
If you're talking about Seth,

1542
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:23,531
I'm sure
he'll be here soon.

1543
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:24,833
Don't tell me he
fell off the tractor.

1544
01:08:24,835 --> 01:08:27,502
Nope, I'm just fine.
Hi.

1545
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:29,170
Savannah grace.

1546
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,839
You're a lot
bigger in person--

1547
01:08:30,841 --> 01:08:33,274
Kate Rinaldi-Rogers,
station manager.

1548
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,742
Let's get you
into wardrobe.

1549
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:37,679
You too.

1550
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:43,118
Well, honky-tonk
showdown.

1551
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,152
Look at you two.

1552
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,787
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1553
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:48,123
Right this way.

1554
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:49,757
This should
make you feel

1555
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,893
right at home.

1556
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:54,562
Yes, ma'am,
it certainly does.

1557
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:56,598
I mean, you have
captured the lifestyle

1558
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,299
perfectly,

1559
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,568
and the cow and the pig,
very nice touch.

1560
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:02,270
Very nice touch.

1561
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:05,807
Okay, people,

1562
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,910
let's do this.

1563
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,224
Hi, this is Emma silver.

1564
01:09:23,226 --> 01:09:25,460
When I left Seattle
for a life on the farm,

1565
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:28,463
I thought that I would die
without my lattes,

1566
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:29,497
the bright lights

1567
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:31,799
and the heartbeat
of the city.

1568
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:35,904
Lattes are just
coffee with milk,

1569
01:09:35,906 --> 01:09:38,573
and the stars in the country

1570
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:40,875
outshine every light
in the city

1571
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:43,444
without even trying.

1572
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:45,346
<i>As for that heartbeat?</i>

1573
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:48,349
<i>Well, I learned that it lies</i>
<i>in people, not places.</i>

1574
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,685
The people of valleyville

1575
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:54,189
are the most sincere people
that I have ever met,

1576
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:57,625
especially my giant
pumpkin growing partner,

1577
01:09:57,627 --> 01:10:02,964
who gives all-new meaning
to "growing the big one."

1578
01:10:02,966 --> 01:10:04,732
And...cut!

1579
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,768
That's a keeper.

1580
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:07,969
Excuse me.

1581
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:09,470
Wow.

1582
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:10,538
Wow...

1583
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,508
So, what part of that
did you mean?

1584
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:15,276
Every word.

1585
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:16,511
Marcus masters,

1586
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:17,679
vice president
of worldmedia,

1587
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:18,780
and may I say,

1588
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:20,882
you have
a face for TV,

1589
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:21,950
not radio.

1590
01:10:21,952 --> 01:10:23,218
Thank you.

1591
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,485
This is Seth--

1592
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:27,355
I've been following
your career.

1593
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:30,725
New York, Seattle pulse,
the whole pumpkin thing.

1594
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:32,627
Now that I see you
in the flesh,

1595
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:34,429
I'm sold.

1596
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:35,663
On what?

1597
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:36,798
We need a new
morning co-anchor

1598
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,569
at New York morning
on wmbc-TV,

1599
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:42,837
and we want you.

1600
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:43,871
Me?

1601
01:10:43,873 --> 01:10:45,340
Yes, you.

1602
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:46,474
Are you in?

1603
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:49,577
Well...

1604
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,250
Yeah.

1605
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:57,252
I'm in.

1606
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:58,419
I've got to run.

1607
01:10:58,421 --> 01:10:59,354
I'll phone
with the details.

1608
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:01,756
Welcome back
to the city.

1609
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:07,428
Hey...

1610
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,932
So I guess your dreams
are coming true?

1611
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,270
Yeah, I guess.

1612
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:19,574
I have to say, i'm
absolutely thrilled for you,

1613
01:11:19,576 --> 01:11:21,542
but you will have to
get a two-bedroom place

1614
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:22,744
because I am
coming to stay, a lot,

1615
01:11:22,746 --> 01:11:23,978
as long as it's nice,
of course...

1616
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,495
Where did you
disappear to?

1617
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:44,465
You know,
you missed a free dinner.

1618
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,769
I chewed on some straw
on the ride home.

1619
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,574
I, wish
that you had stayed.

1620
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:54,876
You had
your hands full.

1621
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:59,047
Seth, I'm sorry
that I have to leave

1622
01:11:59,049 --> 01:12:00,448
right after the weigh-in.

1623
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,583
Nah, there's nothing
to be sorry for.

1624
01:12:02,585 --> 01:12:05,820
I mean, you've got a chance
to do your thing.

1625
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,456
If that's going to
make you happy, then...

1626
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:09,657
By all means.

1627
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:14,395
Yeah, but...

1628
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:16,331
You and I...

1629
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,598
I mean, us, I...

1630
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:20,902
Sometimes you...

1631
01:12:20,904 --> 01:12:24,605
You plant a seed
and it doesn't take.

1632
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:26,841
I...

1633
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:28,810
We better get some sleep.

1634
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:30,945
Um...

1635
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:32,647
We've got pumpkins to tend to,

1636
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,882
right?

1637
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:36,718
Right.

1638
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:42,690
Goodnight, Emma.

1639
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,860
Night.

1640
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:13,488
That is my extreme
nutrient machine.

1641
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,959
Well, show me what you got.

1642
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,731
What's wrong?

1643
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,900
Not a thing,
city girl.

1644
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:29,504
Now, that is
more like it!

1645
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:30,905
What have you two
been doing?

1646
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,840
Just been following
gramps' journal.

1647
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:34,642
You know,
singing to it,

1648
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:37,545
poetry reading,
massaging it.

1649
01:13:37,547 --> 01:13:38,646
The usual stuff.

1650
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:41,816
Yeah, well,
keep up the good work.

1651
01:13:41,818 --> 01:13:44,419
You two are definitely
contenders now!

1652
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:47,455
Thank you,
that's awesome!

1653
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:48,456
Whoo!

1654
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:49,457
Gimme a hug.

1655
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:50,858
We're contenders!
Nice!

1656
01:13:51,795 --> 01:13:53,561
Sorry.

1657
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:54,662
Yeah.

1658
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:55,897
Hello?

1659
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:58,599
Hey, Marcus.

1660
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,767
Yeah, that sounds great.

1661
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,036
I can't wait to get started.

1662
01:14:09,813 --> 01:14:11,679
What is all this?

1663
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:15,917
Things I no longer
need to survive.

1664
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:20,822
Well, goodbye,
boring coffee at home.

1665
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:22,790
Thanks, Emma.

1666
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:23,958
Well, thank you
for making me feel like

1667
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,026
I'm a part of this place.

1668
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:26,694
Well, that's what friends do.

1669
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,629
Besides, you are
a part of this place,

1670
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:29,864
but if you really
want to thank me,

1671
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:30,898
stay.

1672
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,533
The last thing
I need

1673
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:34,735
when he could be
fixing my refrigerator

1674
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:35,837
for free.

1675
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:37,705
Well, we talked.
He understands.

1676
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:39,974
You know, um,

1677
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:42,477
I had to choose between a job
and a man once.

1678
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:44,479
I chose Jeff.

1679
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:45,980
Never regretted it.

1680
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,850
Of course,
the job was at dairy queen.

1681
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:54,655
You just follow
your heart, honey.

1682
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,001
No.

1683
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,808
Okay, guys, let's have a look.
Let's see what we got here.

1684
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,711
Ooh, wow.

1685
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:17,812
It's gynormous.

1686
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:18,946
Holy moley.

1687
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:21,048
Walt would be
proud.

1688
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:23,885
You'd better cut
its thingy.

1689
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:24,952
Thingy?
You mean the stem?

1690
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:26,654
Yeah, we got to
cut the stem.

1691
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:27,822
Here, you cut
the stem.

1692
01:15:27,824 --> 01:15:28,823
Me?

1693
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:29,824
Yeah, you.

1694
01:15:29,826 --> 01:15:30,958
Okay.

1695
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:31,926
How long do I
leave it?

1696
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:32,994
About 10
or 12 inches.

1697
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:35,663
You don't want it
to dry out.

1698
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:37,698
Keep going...

1699
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,034
Okay, there you go.

1700
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,872
All right, I'll...

1701
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:45,840
I'll go 'round
and get the truck.

1702
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:46,841
Let's load this baby up!

1703
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:47,875
I got
the tractor.

1704
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,811
I'm going to leave you
in charge of the camera.

1705
01:15:50,813 --> 01:15:51,946
You know
how to work it?

1706
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:53,548
Sure. I'm a kid.

1707
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:54,849
Walt got the
trophy last year.

1708
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:56,918
So we can give it
to the engraver

1709
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,952
for this year's winner.

1710
01:15:57,954 --> 01:16:00,187
I'll go get it.

1711
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:03,958
Oof!

1712
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:24,045
Unbelievable.

1713
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,018
I have something
pretty shocking

1714
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,620
to show you.

1715
01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:33,688
What is it?

1716
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:34,855
The real
pumpkin journal.

1717
01:16:34,857 --> 01:16:36,691
The one that
I found before

1718
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:37,825
was just what it seemed...

1719
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:40,962
Poems that gramps
wrote to grandma.

1720
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:43,130
Okay...

1721
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:46,867
"After July 1st,
water three times a day,

1722
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:49,003
at least four gallons
per plant."

1723
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,041
Boy...

1724
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,912
"She opens her heart
to the sun,

1725
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:59,680
"and the light caresses

1726
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:02,249
all who look
upon her..."

1727
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:04,151
You know, it's pretty amazing

1728
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:06,787
that we managed
to grow pumpkins at all.

1729
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,923
Yeah.

1730
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:12,026
"My days, my heart,

1731
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:16,163
and my soul belong to her..."

1732
01:17:19,736 --> 01:17:21,869
I say we stick
with the poetry.

1733
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:24,805
Yeah, I had a feeling
that you would say that.

1734
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:26,340
Yup.

1735
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:31,946
Okay, I'm just going to...
Put this one away.

1736
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:42,323
Yahoo!

1737
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:50,164
People all over the country
are weighing right now,

1738
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,133
and what do we care?

1739
01:17:52,135 --> 01:17:55,036
We got the mother lode
of pumpkins

1740
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:57,004
here in valleyville!

1741
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,945
Now, our next
competitor

1742
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:08,149
is two-time champion
Hank moffat!

1743
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:13,087
Bring 'er in, boys!

1744
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:17,958
Careful, careful
with that tractor

1745
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,161
'round the corner, come on,
come on, come on.

1746
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:27,935
Lower it down, now...

1747
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,107
There we go!

1748
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:35,810
Okay, baby.

1749
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:38,045
Do me proud. Do me proud.

1750
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,992
Sorry about
the explosion, Hank,

1751
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:54,161
but now you're
disqualified.

1752
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:57,364
And now,

1753
01:18:57,366 --> 01:19:01,235
our last three top competitors
have yet to weigh in.

1754
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:05,139
First,
Russell winslow's pumpkin!

1755
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:06,941
Careful!

1756
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:11,445
Come on, baby!

1757
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:16,250
1,701 pounds!

1758
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,419
Yes! Yes!

1759
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:22,156
That's a marvelous achievement,

1760
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:25,993
but not quite
the world's record, folks.

1761
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:29,964
That's okay, baby.

1762
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:32,933
And now,

1763
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,435
our own mayor finster!

1764
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:41,142
You're going to
have to step back

1765
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:43,010
so we can
weigh it.

1766
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:44,145
Okay, okay.

1767
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,381
Whoa, doggy!

1768
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:49,183
Another great number!

1769
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:52,953
That's a winner!

1770
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:55,322
And now,
our last pumpkin,

1771
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:58,192
grown by Emma silver

1772
01:19:58,194 --> 01:20:01,295
and Seth Cullen

1773
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,063
from Walt silver's seeds!

1774
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,869
Hey, I just
want to say that,

1775
01:20:08,871 --> 01:20:10,037
no matter
what happens,

1776
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:11,105
thanks for
putting up with me.

1777
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:12,239
It seems like
just yesterday

1778
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:14,041
when you maced me.

1779
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:16,243
Now, look at that baby!

1780
01:20:16,245 --> 01:20:18,245
What do you think
of that, folks?

1781
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:22,016
That is an amazing pumpkin!

1782
01:20:22,018 --> 01:20:24,051
A wonderful gourd!

1783
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:25,920
Now, let me remind you

1784
01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:32,193
that the world record
is 1,878 pounds.

1785
01:20:32,195 --> 01:20:33,294
Now, silence,

1786
01:20:33,296 --> 01:20:39,033
so we can weigh
this magnificent beast!

1787
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,204
I'm so nervous!

1788
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:50,244
76...

1789
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:52,146
77...

1790
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:53,948
78...

1791
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,883
79...

1792
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:56,951
1,000...

1793
01:20:56,953 --> 01:20:59,453
800...

1794
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:01,922
And 80 pounds!

1795
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:11,065
We got the biggest pumpkin
ever grown!

1796
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:15,135
Way to go, Seth!

1797
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,071
Whoo!

1798
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:36,490
Well, now it's time
to award the grand prize.

1799
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:37,958
Get up here, you two!

1800
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:43,297
Well, a lot of us
were skeptical

1801
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:45,332
when you decided
to team up,

1802
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:47,234
but you should be
really proud.

1803
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,004
I know Walt is.

1804
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,607
Yay.

1805
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:56,510
Emma...

1806
01:21:56,512 --> 01:21:58,112
Thanks.

1807
01:21:58,114 --> 01:22:00,147
Here you go.
A total of $50,000.

1808
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:02,216
So, we hear
you're leaving us.

1809
01:22:02,218 --> 01:22:04,418
You have any message
for valleyville

1810
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,586
before you head out?

1811
01:22:07,957 --> 01:22:11,258
Well, for once, I don't
really know what to say,

1812
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,160
except that...

1813
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:16,597
From the moment I got here,
you've all made me feel at home.

1814
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:18,432
This place not only
grows great pumpkins,

1815
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,533
but great friends.

1816
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:22,069
I am going to miss you all
so much.

1817
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:23,137
Aw...

1818
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:25,105
We'll miss you,
too, Emma.

1819
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:33,514
Well...

1820
01:22:33,516 --> 01:22:34,615
Well...

1821
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:36,317
I guess we should
get to the bank

1822
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:37,618
so they can split up
this check.

1823
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,453
Right.

1824
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:41,255
Um, if we don't,

1825
01:22:41,257 --> 01:22:44,391
would you be able to
pay off Walt's place?

1826
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:46,293
You know about that?

1827
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,696
Emma, your grandfather
was the best man I ever knew.

1828
01:22:48,698 --> 01:22:50,264
Owing money
on his land

1829
01:22:50,266 --> 01:22:51,732
is nothing
to be ashamed of,

1830
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:54,101
and you didn't answer
my question.

1831
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:58,339
If I had the whole
prize money,

1832
01:22:58,341 --> 01:22:59,406
with the equity
from my condo,

1833
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,475
I could pay off the debt.

1834
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:04,011
Okay, do it.

1835
01:23:04,013 --> 01:23:05,379
What?

1836
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:07,381
You heard me.

1837
01:23:07,383 --> 01:23:09,683
Okay, what about your shop?

1838
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:11,185
What about mighty mufflers?

1839
01:23:12,588 --> 01:23:14,655
I have faith
in the people of this town.

1840
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:17,124
They're not going to abandon me
for some fancy chain,

1841
01:23:17,126 --> 01:23:18,425
at least, I hope not.

1842
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:22,730
Thank you.

1843
01:23:22,732 --> 01:23:23,998
I'll pay you back.

1844
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,432
I know.

1845
01:23:27,303 --> 01:23:29,069
You know,

1846
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:32,272
I think I finally realize
why you decided to stay.

1847
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,214
Let's go.

1848
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:44,318
Your limo
awaits, madam.

1849
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,621
Yup.

1850
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,330
Thank god
that is over.

1851
01:23:56,332 --> 01:23:59,333
Let's get back to
civilization, shall we?

1852
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:02,403
Three-year contract,

1853
01:24:02,405 --> 01:24:03,670
with an option
to renew.

1854
01:24:03,672 --> 01:24:05,139
Our stylist will
meet you in the A.M.

1855
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:07,574
Looks like we need to
Polish you up a bit.

1856
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:08,742
I bet you're glad

1857
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:11,111
to be leaving
these Hicks behind.

1858
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,726
Wait!

1859
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:31,598
Emma?

1860
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,233
What's going on?

1861
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:35,202
We got a plane
to catch.

1862
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,375
I've changed my mind.

1863
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:42,576
What?

1864
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,545
I want the big pumpkin,

1865
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:46,780
not the big apple.

1866
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,871
<i>Welcome back</i>
<i>to "Emma and friends."</i>

1867
01:25:10,873 --> 01:25:12,806
I have a very special guest,

1868
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:17,244
my co-world record-holder
in growing giant pumpkins,

1869
01:25:17,246 --> 01:25:18,312
Seth Cullen.

1870
01:25:18,314 --> 01:25:20,747
A pleasure
to be here, Emma.

1871
01:25:20,749 --> 01:25:22,416
All right, many of you
may be contemplating

1872
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:24,351
growing your own giant pumpkins,

1873
01:25:24,353 --> 01:25:27,488
so if you have any questions
for the experts,

1874
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:30,491
the lines are now open.

1875
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:32,192
Caller one, you're on.

1876
01:25:32,194 --> 01:25:34,595
<i>What's the secret</i>
<i>of growing giant pumpkins?</i>

1877
01:25:34,597 --> 01:25:35,829
Bobby's blend!

1878
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:39,233
It is. It really is.
It works.

1879
01:25:39,235 --> 01:25:41,401
Well, technically
speaking, yes,

1880
01:25:41,403 --> 01:25:43,303
the right manure
is important.

1881
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:46,240
Caller two.

1882
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:49,276
<i>Are going to team up</i>
<i>again this year?</i>

1883
01:25:49,278 --> 01:25:50,878
Well, actually,

1884
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,647
that is a very
good question--

1885
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,215
and one, actually,

1886
01:25:55,217 --> 01:25:56,283
that I would like
to answer,

1887
01:25:56,285 --> 01:25:58,452
if I may, um...

1888
01:25:58,454 --> 01:26:02,222
As some of you may know, 
I'm a fix-it guy.

1889
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:06,927
I like to think of myself
as a fix-it guy.

1890
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:09,296
But there's
one thing

1891
01:26:09,298 --> 01:26:11,431
that I've been working on
for a while

1892
01:26:11,433 --> 01:26:14,268
that still isn't quite right,

1893
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:17,504
and then suddenly
I realized

1894
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:20,574
what was missing.

1895
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:30,217
My god.

1896
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:34,288
Pumpkin seeds.

1897
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:37,457
Wow.

1898
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:40,694
And this...

1899
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:45,232
Come on. Give me
your hand.

1900
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,271
Emma silver...

1901
01:26:51,273 --> 01:26:52,873
Will you marry me?

1902
01:26:56,812 --> 01:26:58,845
Come on, girl,
don't keep us waiting!

1903
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:00,647
Yes, I'll marry you.

1904
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:09,323
Ooh, hey, hey...

1905
01:27:09,325 --> 01:27:10,624
No.
