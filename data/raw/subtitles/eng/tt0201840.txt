1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
25.000

2
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,695
Watch out! Geko's coming.

3
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,333
What is it, are you ill?

4
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,544
You've been packing again.

5
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,464
There's not much point.

6
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,966
Where should I put this?

7
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,122
Any news about the two boys
from Tibet?

8
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,458
None. You asked just yesterday.

9
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:17,090
They should be here by now.
I hope there's been no trouble.

10
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,395
Things are getting
worse here every day.

11
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,941
It's now a crime to possess
a photo of the Dalai Lama.

12
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,028
So, with all this in my heart,

13
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:44,325
I send my younger brother and son
to your monastery.

14
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:49,789
May the power of my devotion
and Buddha's blessings.

15
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,335
guide them safely
over the border to you.

16
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,879
I've read the letter before.

17
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,757
I hope there hasn't been a problem
at the border.

18
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,599
We're powerless.
There's nothing we can do.

19
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,980
Shall I ask for another prediction?

20
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,233
Yes, that's a good idea.

21
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:24,240
Okay, but he's a loony
and his place stinks.

22
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,336
Geko's coming.

23
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,140
I found this on the way here.

24
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,392
I thought you might like it.

25
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:45,196
Can you do another prediction?

26
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,366
We're worried about the two boys
from Tibet.

27
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,162
But we've already done that.

28
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,290
So what? Do it again.

29
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,418
You just want a good result.

30
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:58,765
We have enough... salt, tea.

31
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,768
We need butter and milk.

32
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,521
Get some vegetables, too.

33
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:15,699
And don't hang about
as you usually do.

34
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,930
Greetings.

35
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,308
Greetings. Welcome.

36
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,898
You took so long.
We were worried you'd got caught.

37
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,734
We had problems at the border.

38
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,698
So these are the two.

39
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,200
Yes.

40
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:50,752
Come and help with the luggage.

41
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,131
Let's go and see the abbot.
He's waiting.

42
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,275
Bow down.

43
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,323
Your hat.

44
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,589
I hope the trip wasn't hard.

45
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,049
Not too bad.

46
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,513
You're so small.

47
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,687
Sit.

48
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,738
I was worried about your journey.

49
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,657
It's good you've arrived.

50
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,106
And then?

51
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,360
We had to avoid
Nepalese border guards.

52
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,906
I hear they's turning back
Tibetan escapees.

53
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,659
They're even raping Tibetan women.

54
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:59,964
Please have tea and tsampa.

55
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,599
It's not as good as in Tibet,
but help yourself.

56
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,727
Is there rice in Tibet now?

57
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,020
Yes, it's Chinese rice.

58
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,022
Apart from that rotten rice,

59
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,358
they haven't brought anything decent.

60
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,761
A girl named Lhamo

61
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:52,600
died in the recent uprising in Lhasa.

62
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,688
Her parents wish the monastery
to have these earrings.

63
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,690
That's so sad.

64
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,445
And then?

65
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,618
Well, their parents really wish
for them to become monks

66
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,455
and study Buddhism.

67
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,464
Nyima's mother is very poor.

68
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:29,054
She gave me this watch to sell

69
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,097
in case he needs money.

70
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,186
Remember,

71
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:39,814
India has the densest population
on earth,

72
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,901
but they still make room
for us Tibetans.

73
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:47,989
So you should study hard now
that you're here.

74
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,784
Yes, you must study hard,

75
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,536
listen to the abbot and geko
and follow the rules.

76
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,458
Yes, that's right.

77
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,796
You keep the watch
and take good care of it.

78
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,760
It's late.
It's time for your ordination.

79
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,185
Have a safe journey.

80
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,874
Do you have to go back
to Tibet again?

81
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,379
Yes, I'm leaving next weed
to bring out two girls.

82
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,214
It's so dangerous.

83
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,719
Well, their parents' olny wish is that

84
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:58,143
they live near the Dalai Lama
and study.

85
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,690
You're in good hands now.

86
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,567
You're very lucky.

87
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:09,696
Observe the rules and study hard.

88
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,867
Wake up! Let's go!

89
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,340
Hey, come and push the taxi.

90
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:46,858
It's time for your ordination.

91
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,448
You're now taking refuge
in the Buddha.

92
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,660
You too.

93
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,610
(This is your buddhist name.)

94
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,671
(Brazil vs Argentina)

95
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:08,560
The way he kicked that ball!

96
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:12,313
It was incredible...

97
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,107
Hey, come here.

98
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,821
What are you up to now?

99
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,574
I saw you at the ceremony.

100
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,160
Go and wash the monks' robes.

101
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,830
Shave these boys' hair
and help them with their robes.

102
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:35,837
By the way,
Palden is sharing you room, Orgyen.

103
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,758
Nyima will be with the young monks.

104
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,428
Do you know why we shave our heads?

105
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,512
So girls will think we're ugly.

106
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,348
But it doesn't help.

107
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:53,855
They're so painfully beautiful.
It's not fair.

108
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:08,078
Is it true that you only bathe once
in your life in Tibet?

109
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,497
No, we wash every New Year.

110
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,459
We Tibetans in lndia wash every day.

111
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,299
You've got a lot to learn from us.

112
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,763
Lodo, are you coming tonight?

113
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:29,307
Are you nuts?

114
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,226
Geko will punish us.

115
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,396
Then you must come tomorrow.

116
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,064
Why?

117
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,941
France is playing.

118
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,360
So what?

119
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,529
France is the only country
that loyally supports Tibet.

120
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,429
How about America?

121
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,181
They're scared shitless of China.

122
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:14,519
No, I don't mean politics.
Are they playing football?

123
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:24,946
You're just asking that because your
American sponsor sends $ 3 a month.

124
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,366
Does India play?

125
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,701
They were kicked out.

126
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,120
They got caught bribing a referee.

127
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,420
Don't move.

128
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,552
I'm having a bath.

129
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,064
You'll get used to it.
It's a 2500-year-old fashion.

130
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,899
You can talk!

131
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,112
Look at you.
Your fashion is melting.

132
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,829
There, that's fine.

133
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:05,505
Let's send this back to China.
Now you're free.

134
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,104
Leave him alone. Let's go.

135
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,689
Wait.

136
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,275
Do a prediction for us, lama.

137
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,236
Can't you see I'm busy?

138
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,990
At least say prayers for France.

139
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:33,491
Are they sick?

140
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,661
They're playing football tomorrow.

141
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,288
It's waste of prayers.

142
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:43,752
Come on. Let's go.
Let's show them their rooms.

143
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,351
This is my shrine.

144
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,939
What is all this?

145
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:12,739
This one, he's Ronaldo.

146
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:17,827
His head is shaved
but he's not a monk.

147
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,291
Anyway, one night
we'll take you to a game.

148
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:27,212
This is where you sleep.

149
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,295
Your son and brother

150
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:14,467
have reached here safely.

151
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:19,556
They are both in excellent health.

152
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:27,939
They were admitted to the monastery
as soon as they arrived.

153
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:33,903
And their studies have already begun.

154
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,011
Keep on reciting.

155
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,186
Let's see the other one.

156
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,522
Be happy with that one.

157
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,232
Come on, please.

158
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:18,156
Okay, but just look
Not touching.

159
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,960
Quick! Geko!

160
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,402
Hey, Orgyen...

161
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,947
Come on, get up.

162
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,116
Did he go last night?

163
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,326
I don't know. I fell asleep.

164
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:07,080
Come on. Get up.

165
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,802
Get up.

166
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,595
How was the game last night?

167
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,848
Wow!

168
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:28,268
That Brazilian missed
by just that much.

169
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,187
It hit the post.

170
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:34,983
You should have been here.

171
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,485
You missed such a good game.

172
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:39,904
You're carrying the incense.

173
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,281
Who, me?

174
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,782
Hurry up.

175
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:27,113
Butter tea, butter tea...

176
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,866
You should have seen Ronaldo.

177
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,576
He missed by this much.

178
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:39,334
You're so unlucky
you missed that game.

179
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,252
Who was playing?

180
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,838
Brazil, you dummy!

181
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:46,800
Well, why didn't you tell me!

182
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,808
I'm definitely going tonight.

183
00:32:56,893 --> 00:33:00,647
How about you?
Are you coming tonight, Palden?

184
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,237
Who's playing tonight?

185
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,364
France and ltaly.

186
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:13,243
I'm coming. I bet ltaly will win.

187
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,744
No way.

188
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:15,954
Want to bet?

189
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:16,746
Why not?

190
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:17,914
What's the bet?

191
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,084
If you lose,
you do my cooking shift.

192
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:26,756
Okay, everyone heard that,
didn't they?

193
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:41,479
''Long live Paraguay!''
''Victory to Germany!''

194
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:56,036
Let's get a prediction.

195
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,663
Isn't that cheating?

196
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,130
What?

197
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:08,923
Can you do a prediction?

198
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,342
For what?

199
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,510
A football match.

200
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:14,763
What's that?

201
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,598
Just tell me! Who'll win?

202
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:20,060
France or ltaly?

203
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:21,770
Is there a war?

204
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:25,106
Phew! You smell.
Let's go.

205
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,443
Now what?

206
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,320
Goodness,

207
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:34,741
the things people ask these days.

208
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,452
Don't worry. She'll be okay.

209
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,998
Orgyen, Orgyen...

210
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,756
Geko's not asleep yet.
What's taking him so long?

211
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,051
When does it start?

212
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:36,886
Very soon.

213
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:42,350
We have to hurry.

214
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:46,855
We can't ride the bikes
through the short cut.

215
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:53,278
Are you sure this is a good idea?

216
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,739
What if they find out?

217
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:58,283
They won't find out.

218
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,538
What if they do?

219
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:05,457
They'll kill us.

220
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:09,252
Why not watch it during the day?

221
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:15,258
It's something to do with
the world not being flat.

222
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,177
Anyway, you're Tibetan.

223
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,888
You wouldn't understand.

224
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:25,185
You guys arrange the blankets
as a decoy.

225
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,446
Look, he's asleep.

226
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,864
Let's go.

227
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:40,158
Wait. Make sure he's asleep.

228
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,661
We must go.
We'll miss the national anthem.

229
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:47,332
Who cares?
It's not the Tibetan anthem.

230
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:50,543
Do you think that will ever happen?

231
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:55,674
Let's go.

232
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,624
Where is that ox, anyway?

233
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:34,212
We were supposed to meet
at the gate.

234
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:08,997
How did you ever escape the Chinese?

235
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:13,668
You're the experts at this.

236
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:16,254
Stop it. Let's go.

237
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:50,598
What's going on?

238
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:57,272
Someone has to be in front
of the goalkeeper

239
00:39:57,439 --> 00:40:01,359
before the opponent arrives.

240
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:04,070
It's called offside, offside.

241
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:21,588
What happened?

242
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:23,173
Come on.

243
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:27,469
Come on. That's it!

244
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,721
Hey, shut up in front.

245
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,188
Why is he holding the ball?

246
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:44,652
If the ball goes
past the white lines,

247
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:49,866
they can throw it back
with their hands.

248
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:51,451
Where's he kicking the ball?

249
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:53,286
There's no one there.

250
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:56,206
Shut up, will you?

251
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:00,001
Why? You can't speak English anyway.

252
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:01,836
We want to hear the crowd.

253
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,593
Come on, come on.

254
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,930
Come on, Maldini, come on.

255
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:14,057
Yes, that's it!

256
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:25,360
Yes, that's it!

257
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:26,403
Sit down!

258
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,531
Missed it!

259
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:46,339
Yes, that's it. That's it!

260
00:41:46,506 --> 00:41:48,341
Come on! I told you to sit down.

261
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:55,515
Leave him alone.
He's done nothing to you.

262
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:06,026
You and your friends get out.

263
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:09,029
Please don't. I'll be quiet.

264
00:42:09,654 --> 00:42:11,656
Don't be so hard on them.

265
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,996
Me? What did I do?

266
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,748
Get rid of those monks.

267
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:30,216
You can't throw us out.
We've paid.

268
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:35,680
So what? Here.

269
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:41,853
Well, I won the bet.

270
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:44,481
What? The game's not over

271
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:45,774
But my team was winning.

272
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,359
Nah, they don't even know
how to pass properly.

273
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:56,076
Orgyen, is anyone there?

274
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,342
Bad new. We're done for.

275
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:17,055
Oh no, we've had it.

276
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:19,641
Tomorrow we'll be boiled alive.

277
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:24,104
What are you doing out here?
Watching the moon?

278
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,189
What's kept you out so late?

279
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:36,282
I have no choice but to tell
the abbot tomorrow.

280
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:40,286
It didn't take long to corrupt
your new room-mate, did it?

281
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:43,206
Incredible...

282
00:43:56,511 --> 00:43:58,680
Will he really tell the abbot?

283
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,851
Don't worry.
He won't send you back to the chinese.

284
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:11,670
What is it?

285
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:53,253
What happened?

286
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:55,130
Did you all lose the bet?

287
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:58,633
Shup up! This butter is rotten.

288
00:46:07,308 --> 00:46:09,310
So what do we do?

289
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:12,981
Do they know you've told me?

290
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:17,235
I don't think so.
I just threatened to tell you.

291
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:21,448
Well, don't let them know.

292
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:23,825
Or we'll never be able to
discipline them

293
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,411
Disciplining monks is hard,

294
00:46:26,536 --> 00:46:30,832
especially now.

295
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,667
Even our newcomer, Palden,

296
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:34,836
has fallen in with them.

297
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:37,964
Why especially now?

298
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:40,091
It's the World Cup.

299
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,391
What's that?

300
00:46:48,516 --> 00:46:53,063
Two civilised nations
fighting over a ball.

301
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:56,274
You must be joking.

302
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:58,693
So there's violence?

303
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:01,321
Sometimes.

304
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:05,408
How about sex?

305
00:47:05,533 --> 00:47:08,328
Don't worry, there's no sex.

306
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:10,955
How do you know all this?

307
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:17,462
Who wrote this stuff?

308
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:21,925
And what are these?

309
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,928
Prayer flags, I suppose.

310
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:31,393
If only you put this much energy
into your studies.

311
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:34,896
Look, if you go out again at night,

312
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:37,565
you'll be expelled.

313
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:39,984
And you, you and you...

314
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:43,988
Do the cooking for a month.

315
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:47,033
As you're new,
you're excused...this time.

316
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,077
Do you understand?

317
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:50,221
Do you miss your mother?

318
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:51,806
Yes.

319
00:48:52,265 --> 00:48:54,559
Do you miss your pet rabbit?
Who do you miss more?

320
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:17,290
Hi. Daydreaming or what?

321
00:49:21,836 --> 00:49:23,380
Homesick?

322
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:37,143
Well, I have no home to miss.

323
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:42,982
This is the only thing I care about.

324
00:49:51,282 --> 00:49:52,617
Here.

325
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:54,911
What is it?

326
00:49:55,578 --> 00:49:57,122
It's rubber sweet from America.

327
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:04,170
I hear everything in America
is made of rubber,

328
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:06,881
even their faces and breasts.

329
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:13,138
See. Like these.

330
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:20,937
Is that the watch
your mother gave you?

331
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:23,940
Here, let me see.

332
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:33,783
Do you want to sell it?

333
00:50:45,253 --> 00:50:47,547
Looks like we all lost the bet.

334
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:51,009
Good timing.
We've done most of the work.

335
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:00,352
Now what?

336
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,312
Can I have some hot water?

337
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,777
Yuk! So dirty!

338
00:51:09,903 --> 00:51:13,907
You should clean it.
I'll get some washing powder.

339
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:24,793
This isn't Tibet, it's India.

340
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:28,004
If you don't wash, you'll get sick...

341
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:32,300
and your predictions won't work.

342
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,638
Here, let me do it.

343
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:54,614
Here.

344
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:05,583
Here. Now go.
We have important things to do.

345
00:52:16,052 --> 00:52:17,387
Did you go to the post office?

346
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:19,514
Any letters for me?

347
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:24,144
No, but I have good news.

348
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,438
What?

349
00:52:26,604 --> 00:52:28,857
Tonight is the final.

350
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,777
Can't you forget football
for a minute?

351
00:52:32,944 --> 00:52:34,988
But it's the final.

352
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:39,993
If we miss this,
it won't come for another four years.

353
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:43,163
What do you think?

354
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:50,920
I don't know.
But I'll tell you one thing...

355
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:54,424
I hate cooking
while you research football.

356
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:57,719
We've missed two semi-finals.

357
00:52:57,886 --> 00:52:59,387
Yes, that's true.

358
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:03,933
I'm definitely going tonight.

359
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:18,573
If you do, you'll be gone forever.

360
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:23,119
Don't you remember what geko said?

361
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,523
Very good.
That's enough for today.

362
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:31,062
Hey, I've got an idea.

363
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:36,359
Let's ask geko if we can
watch the game here.

364
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:38,153
You mean in the monastery?

365
00:54:38,987 --> 00:54:42,365
You must be crazy.
They'd never agree.

366
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:45,326
Maybe.
Their worry is us going out at night.

367
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:47,203
It's not the football.

368
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,080
Have you gone nuts?
And besides...

369
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:05,805
And besides...
we can make all sorts of promises.

370
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:13,605
Like what?

371
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:18,985
Cooking for six lifetimes?

372
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:30,789
No, like how we'll study hard,

373
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,540
we won't skip classes...

374
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:34,793
Think about it.

375
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:36,795
What do you think?

376
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:39,089
I don't know.

377
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:44,427
Instead of our picnic day,
we could have a TV night.

378
00:55:44,552 --> 00:55:45,845
That's a good idea.

379
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:50,308
Let's ask.

380
00:55:50,975 --> 00:55:52,268
Hang on. Wait.

381
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:57,065
Where will we get a TV?

382
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,401
An Indian guy rents them.

383
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:03,196
You didn't just think of this,
did you?

384
00:56:07,742 --> 00:56:09,285
Where will we get money?

385
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:10,995
We'll worry about that later.

386
00:56:12,122 --> 00:56:13,832
You stay here.

387
00:56:13,998 --> 00:56:15,792
Why me?

388
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:17,460
Do you want to ask geko instead?

389
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:28,430
You go first.

390
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:30,682
You do it. It's your idea.

391
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:43,445
Geko...

392
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:48,533
Try again.

393
00:56:50,618 --> 00:56:52,704
Yes, what do you want?

394
00:56:55,206 --> 00:56:56,583
Okay, come in.

395
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:22,650
Have you spoken to our new boys?

396
00:57:22,817 --> 00:57:25,195
Yes.

397
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:28,114
I have a request to make.

398
00:57:33,995 --> 00:57:37,165
What they're saying is...

399
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:41,795
If they could get a TV

400
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:45,340
and could just watch this one game,

401
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:51,346
the final game,

402
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:55,600
they'll promise to study harder

403
00:57:55,767 --> 00:58:00,146
and behave a lot better.

404
00:58:00,271 --> 00:58:03,650
Look how silly I am.

405
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:08,321
I thought our being exiles
wouldn't last this long.

406
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:11,199
I wanted...

407
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:19,207
to show these photos back home,

408
00:58:19,332 --> 00:58:23,753
to show them that

409
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,717
in America there are bulidings
hundreds of storeys high.

410
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:36,099
Otherwise,
they would never believe me.

411
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:41,604
Also, they would never believe me

412
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:48,486
if I were to tell them that these
came off a bird's arse.

413
00:58:57,454 --> 00:58:59,539
Look, as you can see,

414
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:04,794
I'm always packed,
ready to return to Tibet.

415
00:59:04,919 --> 00:59:07,589
I've become old now

416
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:13,219
and I don't think
I shall ever return.

417
00:59:13,386 --> 00:59:17,265
I need to give up this
attachment to my homeland.

418
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:24,522
Do you think these young monks

419
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:29,194
will ever know
what Tibet was really like?

420
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:35,200
Anyway, what were you saying?

421
00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:42,207
When's the fight?

422
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:43,917
What fight?

423
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:47,837
The two nations fighting
over this ball.

424
00:59:47,962 --> 00:59:49,339
Oh, that.

425
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:52,717
I think it's around midnight.

426
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,638
What a strange time to fight.

427
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:05,063
What do they get out of this?

428
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:07,065
A cup.

429
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:15,990
A cup... Mmm...

430
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:27,377
What's taking them so long?

431
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:29,754
The game's tonght
and we've got a lot to do.

432
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,884
We might not even get permission.

433
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:56,406
Whose idea was this?

434
01:00:58,783 --> 01:01:00,118
How about money?

435
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:07,167
Money for the TV?

436
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:09,669
We'll collect money
from the monks.

437
01:01:14,924 --> 01:01:16,176
When is the game?

438
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:17,635
Tonght.

439
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:24,017
Now, don't make a big deal
out of this.

440
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:27,562
Okay.

441
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:35,070
What did they say?

442
01:01:35,236 --> 01:01:36,613
Yes!

443
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,114
Really?

444
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:40,533
You go back to the kitchen.

445
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,659
What about you?

446
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:42,827
We're collecting money.

447
01:01:42,994 --> 01:01:44,454
Unless you want to.

448
01:01:50,168 --> 01:01:51,002
We really must hurry.

449
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:55,757
You collect from the others
and meet me in my room.

450
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:18,863
What's happening?

451
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:25,412
Do you have any money?

452
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:29,916
I guess not.

453
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:31,167
What for?

454
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:44,472
Hey, how much do you have?

455
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:46,641
How much did you get?

456
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:48,893
Here.

457
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:59,029
Wow, you're very generous.

458
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:00,905
Is this all you've got?

459
01:03:01,322 --> 01:03:02,907
How much do we have, then?

460
01:03:05,076 --> 01:03:07,162
About two hundred.

461
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:12,334
That's not enough.
Let's go and collect more.

462
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:15,295
Will you help us carry
the TV tonight?

463
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,713
Where from?

464
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:29,934
You go that way, Lodo.

465
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,269
I already did.

466
01:03:31,394 --> 01:03:33,355
Go again!

467
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:40,153
We need more money.

468
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,364
Try him. He's got lots.

469
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:45,742
Give us some money for the TV.

470
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:47,702
I'm not watching. lt's boring.

471
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:50,955
If you don't, we'll tell geko
you sleep during prayers.

472
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:58,338
Monks shouldn't steal money.

473
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:00,048
Monks aren't meant to have
so much money.

474
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:13,603
I need some money.

475
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:18,066
What have you done?

476
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:21,111
I gave you dishwashing soap!

477
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:23,738
Washing cup, head or bottom,

478
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:28,118
what's the difference?
Now what do you want?

479
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:29,619
Some money.

480
01:04:29,744 --> 01:04:33,289
You didn't return
what I gave you last time.

481
01:04:33,623 --> 01:04:35,458
Please, it's really important.

482
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,919
It's the World Cup final.

483
01:04:39,295 --> 01:04:41,256
Go away. I don't have any.

484
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,426
I know you do.

485
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:47,220
How do you know?

486
01:04:47,762 --> 01:04:51,391
People give you money
for all those predictions.

487
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:58,606
I've locked your door.

488
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:01,901
Hey! Open up!

489
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:04,821
If you don't lend me money,

490
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:07,449
I'll swallow the key.

491
01:05:07,615 --> 01:05:08,616
How much?

492
01:05:09,492 --> 01:05:10,368
A hundred.

493
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:13,038
Open up and I'll give you some.

494
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:14,914
No. Put it under the door.

495
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,584
Here, you rascal. Open up.

496
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:25,258
Here's the key, you old goat.

497
01:05:38,772 --> 01:05:40,190
It's you.

498
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:52,160
What's this?
It isn't enough.

499
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:55,330
You said 300 before.

500
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:57,916
It's the World Cup.
Prices go up.

501
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,501
How much?

502
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:03,296
It's 350 for black and white
and 400 for colour.

503
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:04,881
What?

504
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:08,468
Oh, come one, take 300.

505
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:11,221
No, that's my best price.

506
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:14,015
We only have 300.

507
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,101
Can we give you the rest tomorrow?

508
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:19,270
Please. We don't have much time.

509
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:20,772
No!

510
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:25,610
Please don't do this.
We're neighbours.

511
01:06:25,735 --> 01:06:30,073
This is our only chance
to watch the game.

512
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,741
Sorry.

513
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:34,536
Let's go back and find a way.

514
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:35,912
How?

515
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,165
We'll go and get 50 rupees

516
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:40,750
and be back soon.

517
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:44,671
Listen, my shop closes in two hours.

518
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:47,716
I can't wait any longer.

519
01:06:47,882 --> 01:06:52,262
My wife is home alone,
taking care of our sick daughter.

520
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:56,266
How will you carry the dish?
On your shoulders?

521
01:06:56,349 --> 01:06:57,350
Let's go.

522
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:29,132
I've got an idea.
Doesn't Nyima have a watch?

523
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:31,509
He might let us pawn it.

524
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:38,391
That's an excellent idea.

525
01:07:38,516 --> 01:07:41,186
You should ask him for it.

526
01:07:41,686 --> 01:07:44,898
I can't.
His mother gave it to him.

527
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,317
It's his most prized possession.

528
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:50,487
You're his uncle.
He'll do it for you.

529
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,697
Don't worry. No matter what,

530
01:07:52,864 --> 01:07:55,617
I'll get it back for him.

531
01:07:55,742 --> 01:07:57,410
You have my solemn word.

532
01:07:57,535 --> 01:08:01,331
You didn't give any money,
so do this.

533
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:04,042
Go on, go now.

534
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:08,588
Hey, Nyima, wait.

535
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:49,546
That's what friends are for.

536
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:53,174
You and Nyima get
the best seats tonight.

537
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:55,552
Let's get the tractor.

538
01:08:55,677 --> 01:08:57,929
Weren't we getting a TV?

539
01:08:58,054 --> 01:08:59,597
Let's go, let's go.

540
01:09:45,935 --> 01:09:47,395
Wait.

541
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:50,190
Ah, you guys.
Did you get the money?

542
01:09:51,274 --> 01:09:54,736
No, but we brought a watch.

543
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:56,446
A watch?

544
01:10:03,912 --> 01:10:06,331
We'll bring the money tomorrow.

545
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:09,751
Meanwhile, you can keep it.

546
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:12,962
Does it work?

547
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:15,340
Of course. It's English.

548
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:19,386
Okay, but you only have
until midday tomorrow.

549
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:22,222
Or else I'll have to sell it.

550
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:26,393
Okay, take it.

551
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:30,230
Let's get the dish.

552
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:37,445
What happened to the watch?

553
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:41,616
Don't worry.
We'll get it back tomorrow.

554
01:10:44,452 --> 01:10:46,329
Who's setting the dish up?

555
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:50,000
You, of course.

556
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:53,628
That's another 50 rupees.

557
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:56,923
Forget it.

558
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,634
Yeah. We'll do it ourselves.

559
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:01,219
All right.

560
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:11,813
What?

561
01:11:11,938 --> 01:11:14,941
Which direction do we point
the dish?

562
01:11:15,066 --> 01:11:18,111
North, north...

563
01:11:22,532 --> 01:11:25,160
Things aren't like they used to be.

564
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:32,584
These days... our young monks
are exposed to many things.

565
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:41,426
that older ones like myself
never even dreamed of.

566
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:45,013
Don't worry about your boys.

567
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:51,603
I will make sure
traditional training.

568
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:55,231
I hope they'll continue
to uphold Buddha's lineage

569
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:57,525
according to these modern times.

570
01:12:02,614 --> 01:12:07,077
TV is coming! TV is coming!

571
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:45,907
Quick, get the dish onto the roof.
Don't drop it.

572
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:52,288
I'll put the dish on the roof.

573
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:53,665
You help down here.

574
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:06,720
Have you seen my uncle?

575
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:10,056
Have you seen my uncle Palden?

576
01:13:13,309 --> 01:13:17,647
France is going to win tonight.

577
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:22,861
Never!

578
01:13:22,986 --> 01:13:25,071
They'll definitely win.

579
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:27,157
Brazil will eat them alive!

580
01:13:38,918 --> 01:13:40,754
Put it here in the middle.

581
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:54,809
Put the wires in the back.

582
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:58,855
Straighten the seats into rows,
you guys.

583
01:14:05,862 --> 01:14:08,239
Can you tie a knot, Palden?

584
01:14:08,406 --> 01:14:10,283
Sure I can.

585
01:14:15,413 --> 01:14:22,253
Tie it tightly
or this percious jewel might drop.

586
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:24,297
One, two, three...

587
01:14:24,422 --> 01:14:27,175
Gently, gently...

588
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:28,802
Watch out.

589
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:32,514
Be careful.

590
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:55,120
Hey, Palden...

591
01:14:55,245 --> 01:14:59,916
Tell Orgyen the dish is ready.
Get the cable.

592
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:02,961
We're ready.
Can we connect it?

593
01:15:03,128 --> 01:15:05,255
Yes, we'll send the cable up now.

594
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:34,617
It's connected.
Which way do we point it?

595
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:35,660
What?

596
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:38,204
Which direction?

597
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:51,176
North, I think. Yes, north.

598
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:54,137
Which way is east?

599
01:15:54,262 --> 01:15:56,723
But he said north.

600
01:15:56,848 --> 01:16:00,977
I know, but which way is east?

601
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:02,604
Where does the sun rise?

602
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:05,106
Somewhere there.

603
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:21,706
Have those dummies
worked out he direction yet?

604
01:16:21,873 --> 01:16:26,670
Palden, are you getting anything?

605
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:29,839
Getting anything yet?

606
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:33,635
No. Keep trying.
Move the dish around.

607
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:40,350
Have you got anything yet?

608
01:16:49,442 --> 01:16:51,903
Palden, tell them to keep
turning it around up there.

609
01:16:52,028 --> 01:16:55,115
North?

610
01:16:55,281 --> 01:16:56,282
That's what the Indian said.

611
01:16:56,449 --> 01:16:59,369
Never ask directions from an Indian.

612
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:08,211
Palden, go and tell Lodo
to try south.

613
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:21,266
Nyima wants his watch back.

614
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:23,518
Not now.

615
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:26,271
Anyway, Buddhists shouldn't
be so attached.

616
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:27,731
There it is!

617
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:08,456
Now what?

618
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:11,001
The electricity went off, dummy.
Are you blind?

619
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,336
We have lots of candles.

620
01:19:13,503 --> 01:19:15,547
Anybody got a torch?

621
01:19:19,509 --> 01:19:22,470
Someone check if it's only us.

622
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,564
Good news.
It's the whole village.

623
01:19:32,731 --> 01:19:34,232
Then it'll be on soon.

624
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:37,944
When will this country ever develop?

625
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:41,031
Maybe the power company wants a bribe.

626
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:44,409
So what do we do?

627
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,747
I have an idea.
Give me a torch.

628
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,752
Once upon a time

629
01:19:53,877 --> 01:19:55,879
a man was having a nightmare.

630
01:19:56,046 --> 01:20:01,301
A really scary monster
approached him.

631
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:05,805
''I'm going to eat you tonight.''

632
01:20:05,972 --> 01:20:08,808
The man was terrified.

633
01:20:08,933 --> 01:20:11,269
He didn't know what to do

634
01:20:11,436 --> 01:20:14,022
so he asked the monster,

635
01:20:14,147 --> 01:20:16,733
''What shall I do?''

636
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,318
The monster replied,

637
01:20:18,443 --> 01:20:22,947
''How should l know?
It's your dream.''

638
01:20:23,114 --> 01:20:25,075
This is boring.

639
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:29,245
I have a better story.

640
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:33,625
Once upon a time
a rabbit went to drink at a lake.

641
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:37,337
While drinking,
he saw his reflection.

642
01:20:37,462 --> 01:20:40,048
Startled, he ran off.

643
01:20:40,173 --> 01:20:41,758
He met a dog and said

644
01:20:41,883 --> 01:20:45,011
''Don't go to the lake.
There's a strange creature.''

645
01:20:45,178 --> 01:20:47,305
They met...

646
01:20:47,472 --> 01:20:50,684
a deer,

647
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:53,478
a fox,

648
01:20:53,603 --> 01:20:56,147
a goose...

649
01:20:56,314 --> 01:21:00,068
and a crane.

650
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:06,616
To hell with rabbits.
Let's watch football!

651
01:21:42,777 --> 01:21:46,156
Sit down. Sit down.

652
01:22:46,466 --> 01:22:47,967
What a great goal.

653
01:22:48,134 --> 01:22:49,803
Why so gloomy?

654
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:10,573
What are you doing up there?

655
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:12,659
You can't see from up there.

656
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:14,786
Why are you down there?

657
01:23:14,911 --> 01:23:16,663
Can you see down there?

658
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:20,834
I must get some money
or Nyima will lose his watch.

659
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:23,545
That's the sort of thing
you do all the time.

660
01:25:05,563 --> 01:25:11,611
What are you doing here
after all the chaos you've created?

661
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:15,407
If I don't find some money
by tomorrow,

662
01:25:15,573 --> 01:25:17,867
Nyima's watch will be sold
by that Indian.

663
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:22,747
Shoes for a watch?

664
01:25:22,914 --> 01:25:24,708
I have other things, too.

665
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,752
Show me.

666
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:46,104
Isn't this knife from your mother?

667
01:26:03,997 --> 01:26:05,165
You're so bad at business,

668
01:26:05,331 --> 01:26:07,000
you'll be a good monk.

669
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,336
Don't worry.
The abbot and I will pay the money.

670
01:27:06,309 --> 01:27:09,479
Can we cover the earth in leather

671
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:12,190
so it's soft wherever we go?

672
01:27:12,315 --> 01:27:14,901
No.

673
01:27:17,737 --> 01:27:19,572
So what can we do?

674
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:29,040
Cover our feet in leather?

675
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:37,507
Yes, covering our feet in leather
is equal to covering

676
01:27:37,674 --> 01:27:39,592
the earth with leather.

677
01:27:39,759 --> 01:27:41,678
Likewise,

678
01:27:41,845 --> 01:27:50,270
enemise are as limitless as space.

679
01:27:50,437 --> 01:28:00,447
All enemise cannot possibly
be overcome.

680
01:28:00,572 --> 01:28:09,706
Yet if one can just
overcome hatred,

681
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:18,298
this will be equal to overcoming
all enemies.

682
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:27,349
All that is unsatisfactory
in this world,

683
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:34,314
all the fear and suffering
that exists...

684
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:39,277
clinging to the ''I'' has created it.

685
01:28:39,402 --> 01:28:44,491
What am I to do
with this qreat demon?

686
01:28:44,616 --> 01:28:55,794
To release myself from harm

687
01:28:55,919 --> 01:29:04,052
and to free all others
from their suffering,

688
01:29:04,177 --> 01:29:09,891
let me give myself away

689
01:29:10,016 --> 01:29:15,021
and love others all I love myself.

690
01:29:15,188 --> 01:29:22,821
If a problem can be solved,

691
01:29:22,987 --> 01:29:29,619
why be unhappy?

692
01:29:29,744 --> 01:29:31,830
And if it cannot be solved

693
01:29:31,996 --> 01:29:35,917
what is the use of being unhappy?

694
01:29:44,259 --> 01:29:45,593
Here.

695
01:29:49,222 --> 01:29:51,016
Hey, wait.

696
01:29:59,315 --> 01:30:00,817
Hey, wait...

697
01:30:05,989 --> 01:30:07,449
wait...

698
01:30:21,504 --> 01:30:23,173
How does the story end?

699
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,549
Which story?

700
01:30:25,467 --> 01:30:27,010
The one about the rabbit.

701
01:30:28,053 --> 01:30:29,095
Guess.

702
01:30:30,347 --> 01:30:33,933
I don't know. Just tell me.

703
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:36,269
Who cares about the end?

704
01:30:36,436 --> 01:30:37,645
What?

705
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:40,732
What's all the fuss about ending...

706
