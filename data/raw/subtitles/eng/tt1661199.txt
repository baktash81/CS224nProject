1
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,448
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a girl called Ella.</i>

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,620
<i>And she saw the world
not always as it was,</i>

3
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,123
<i>but as perhaps it could be,
with just a little bit of magic.</i>

4
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,340
My darling!

5
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,700
<i>To her mother and father,
she was a princess.</i>

6
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,202
<i>True, she had no title,
nor crown, nor castle,</i>

7
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,740
<i>but she was the ruler
of her own little kingdom,</i>

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,740
<i>whose borders were the house
and meadow on the forest's edge</i>

9
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,810
<i>where her people
had lived for generations.</i>

10
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,801
<i>With Mr. Goose</i>

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,488
<i>and all their animal family.</i>

12
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,220
Hello, there.
What do you think you're doing?

13
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,084
Let the little ones have their share.

14
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,523
We don't want you getting
an upset stomach.

15
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,580
Gus-Gus, you're a house mouse,
not a garden mouse.

16
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,340
Isn't he, Jacqueline?

17
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,100
And you mustn't eat Mr. Goose's food.

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,340
Isn't that right, Mummy?

19
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,740
Do you still believe
that they understand you?

20
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,127
- Don't they, Mother?
- Yes.

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,620
I believe that animals listen
and speak to us

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,370
if we only have the ear for it.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,900
That's how we learn to look after them.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,206
Who looks after us?

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,780
Fairy godmothers, of course.

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,420
And do you believe in them?

27
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,900
I believe in everything.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,241
Then I believe in everything, too.

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,900
<i>Her father was a merchant</i>

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,180
<i>who went abroad</i>

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,100
<i>and brought tribute back from
all of Ella's subject lands.</i>

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,645
Ella!

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,569
Where are my girls, my beautiful girls?

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,924
Where are my darlings?

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,620
<i>Ella missed him terribly
when he was away.</i>

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,900
<i>But she knew he would always return.</i>

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,020
- There she is!
- Papa, welcome home!

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,167
How are you?

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,526
You've grown!

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,331
Haven't you, now?

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,882
- There you go, sir.
- What was that?

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,780
This?

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,780
I found it hanging on a tree.

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,010
I think there may be something inside.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,729
It's so pretty.

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,530
In French, that is <i>un papillon</i>.

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,571
You're standing on my feet.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,241
Shall we?

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,922
Look, Mummy! I'm dancing!

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,888
Little <i>papillon</i>.

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,500
<i>All was just as it should be.</i>

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,380
<i>They knew themselves to be the most
happy of families to live as they did</i>

53
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,420
<i>and to love each other so.</i>

54
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,180
<i>When I am king dilly, dilly</i>

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,806
<i>You shall be queen</i>

56
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,180
<i>Lavender's green dilly, dilly</i>

57
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,760
<i>Lavender's blue</i>

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,820
<i>You must love me dilly, dilly</i>

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,651
<i>For I love you</i>

60
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,540
<i>But sorrow can come to any kingdom,</i>

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,768
<i>no matter how happy.</i>

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,206
<i>And so it came to Ella's home.</i>

63
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,900
I'm so sorry.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,764
Thank you, Doctor.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,169
This must have been
very difficult for you.

66
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
Come.

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,526
Ella.

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,961
Ella, my darling.

69
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,842
I want to tell you a secret.

70
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,100
A great secret that will see you through

71
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,043
all the trials that life can offer.

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,727
You must always remember this.

73
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,051
Have courage and be kind.

74
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,260
You have more kindness
in your little finger

75
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,500
than most people possess
in their whole body.

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,128
And it has power, more than you know.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,860
- And magic.
- Magic?

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,961
Truly.

79
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,202
Have courage and be kind, my darling.

80
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,086
Will you promise me?

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,606
I promise.

82
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,401
Good.

83
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,287
Good.

84
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,721
And...

85
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,484
I must go very soon, my love.

86
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,963
Please forgive me.

87
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,762
Of course I forgive you.

88
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,690
I love you.

89
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,569
I love you, my darling.

90
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,605
I love you.

91
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,161
<i>Time passed, and pain turned to memory.</i>

92
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,490
<i>In her heart, Ella stayed the same.</i>

93
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,323
<i>For she remembered
her promise to her mother.</i>

94
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,604
<i>Have courage, and be kind.</i>

95
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,020
<i>Father, however, was much changed.</i>

96
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,487
<i>But he hoped for better times.</i>

97
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,283
"And thence home,

98
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,962
"and my wife and I singing,
to our great content,

99
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,380
"and if ever there were a man
happier in his fortunes,

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,289
"I know him not."

101
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,481
Thus ends Mr. Pepys for today.

102
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,928
I do love a happy ending, don't you?

103
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,841
They're quite my favorite sort.

104
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,165
As well they should be.

105
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,681
Ella,

106
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,405
I have come to the conclusion
that it's time, perhaps,

107
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,203
to begin a new chapter.

108
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,140
Indeed, Father?

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,420
You'll recall that some time ago,
in my travels,

110
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,921
I made the acquaintance
of Sir Francis Tremaine.

111
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,260
Yes.

112
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,500
The Master of the Mercer's Guild,
is he not?

113
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,620
Was.

114
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,449
The poor man has died, alas.

115
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,845
His widow,

116
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,300
an honorable woman,

117
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,780
finds herself alone,

118
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,042
though still in the prime of her life.

119
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,848
You're worried about telling me.

120
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,203
But you mustn't be.

121
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,460
Not if it will lead to your happiness.

122
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,846
Yes.

123
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,050
Happiness.

124
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,330
Do you think
I may be allowed one last chance,

125
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,247
even though I thought
such things were done with for good?

126
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,960
Of course I do, Father.

127
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,100
She'll merely be your stepmother.

128
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,488
And you'll have two lovely sisters
to keep you company.

129
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,807
Have courage, be kind.

130
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,050
Welcome, ladies. Welcome!

131
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,860
She's skinny as a broomstick!

132
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,803
And that stringy hair!

133
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,500
You're very nice.

134
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,380
Welcome. I'm so happy to meet you.

135
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,460
You have such pretty hair.

136
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,900
- Thank you.
- You should have it styled.

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,980
I'm sure you're right.

138
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,684
- Would you like a tour of the house?
- What did she say?

139
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,540
She wants to show us
around her farmhouse.

140
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,405
- She's proud of it, I think.
- Do they keep animals inside?

141
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,649
How charming. How perfectly charming.

142
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,966
Lucifer.

143
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,860
<i>Her stepmother-to-be</i>

144
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,460
<i>was a woman of keen feeling
and refined taste.</i>

145
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,620
<i>And she, too, had known grief.</i>

146
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,405
<i>But she wore it wonderfully well.</i>

147
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,123
You did not say
your daughter was so beautiful.

148
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,885
She takes after her...

149
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,005
Her mother.

150
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,080
Just so.

151
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,260
What does Mummy mean?
What's so charming about it?

152
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,780
She's lying. That's just good manners.

153
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,961
Shut up.

154
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,540
How long has your family lived here?

155
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,660
Over 200 years.

156
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,740
And in all that time,
they never thought to decorate?

157
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,923
Anastasia, hush.

158
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,967
They'll think you are in earnest.

159
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,940
<i>Ella's stepmother,
high-spirited lady that she was,</i>

160
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,647
<i>set out to restore life
and laughter to the house.</i>

161
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,806
You are awful, Baron.

162
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,967
Fortune favors me again.

163
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,340
Well, look who's having
a party of their own.

164
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,445
Jacqueline, Teddy, Matilda,
greedy Gus-Gus.

165
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,020
Just what...

166
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,300
Yes, what do you think
you're up to, Lucifer?

167
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,564
Jacqueline is my guest,
and the eating of guests is not allowed.

168
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,820
Go on, now.

169
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,241
You've plenty of cat food
to keep you happy.

170
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,202
We ladies must help one another.

171
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,100
You're missing the party.

172
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,771
I imagine it's much
like all the other ones.

173
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,940
And I'm leaving first thing, El.

174
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,500
No. But you're...

175
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,126
You're hardly back from the last trip.

176
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,700
Do you have to go?

177
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,882
It's just a few months, my darling.

178
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,020
What would you like me
to bring you home from abroad?

179
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,460
You know, your sisters...

180
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,820
Stepsisters, have asked for

181
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,400
parasols and lace.

182
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,686
What will you have?

183
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,484
Bring me the first branch
your shoulder brushes on your journey.

184
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,380
That's a curious request.

185
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,020
Well, you'll have to take it with you
on your way

186
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,646
and think of me when you look at it.

187
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,006
And when you bring it back,
it means that you'll be with it.

188
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,761
And that's what I really want.

189
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,808
For you to come back.

190
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,201
No matter what.

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,411
I will.

192
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,209
Ella, while I'm away,

193
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,900
I want you to be good to your stepmother

194
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,207
and stepsisters, even though they may be

195
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,041
trying at times.

196
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,170
- I promise.
- Thank you.

197
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,166
I always leave
a part of me behind, Ella.

198
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,851
Remember that.

199
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,367
And your mother's here, too,
though you see her not.

200
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,044
She's the very heart of this place.

201
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,740
And that's why
we must cherish this house,

202
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,444
always, for her.

203
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,330
I miss her.

204
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,245
Do you?

205
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,491
Very much.

206
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,100
Remember the lace!
I simply must have it!

207
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,740
And my parasol!

208
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,700
For my complexion!

209
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,406
That means skin, if you don't know!

210
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,891
Bye!

211
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,980
Bye, Ella!

212
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,100
I love you!

213
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,248
I love you, too!

214
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,930
Bye!

215
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,090
Ella, dear.

216
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,401
Now, now. Mustn't blub.

217
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,300
Yes, Stepmother.

218
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,368
You needn't call me that.

219
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,220
"Madam" will do.

220
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,180
There isn't room for me
and all of your clothes!

221
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,500
Well, then make yourself smaller!

222
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,444
Anastasia and Drisella
have always shared a room.

223
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,041
Such dear, affectionate girls.

224
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,700
Or... Or better yet, disappear entirely!

225
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,100
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

226
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,964
Sometimes I could scratch your eyes out!

227
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,122
I think they're finding
the sleeping quarters rather confining.

228
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,647
Well, my bedroom's the biggest
besides yours and Father's.

229
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,048
Perhaps they'd like to share it.

230
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,580
What a wonderful idea.

231
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,842
What a good girl you are.

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,060
I can stay in the...

233
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,491
The attic.

234
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,326
Quite so.

235
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,900
The attic?

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,940
Yes.

237
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,740
Only temporarily, while I have
all the other rooms redecorated.

238
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,420
The attic's so nice and airy

239
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,900
and you'll be away
from all of our fuss and bother.

240
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,220
You'd be even more cozy

241
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,723
if you kept all this bric-a-brac
up there with you.

242
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,249
Keep you amused.

243
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,721
Well,

244
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,881
no one shall disturb me here.

245
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,970
Hello, Gus-Gus.

246
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,082
Go on, Gus-Gus, you can do it.

247
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,004
So this is where you take refuge.

248
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,930
Me too, it would seem.

249
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,241
Right.

250
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,700
Who's going to help me?

251
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,780
Simpleton.

252
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,900
That is the last straw.

253
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,765
Our little sister, up there,
talking to the woodworm.

254
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,284
How very pleasant.

255
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,645
No cats,

256
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,442
and no stepsisters.

257
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,180
We have a halfwit for a sister.

258
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,500
I've got two.

259
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,060
I heard that.

260
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,128
- Who is she talking to?
- She's mad.

261
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,124
<i>Sing, sweet nightingale</i>

262
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,020
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ella.

263
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,804
Good morning, Tom!

264
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,180
<i>Sing sweet...</i>

265
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,442
Hello. Don't mind if I...

266
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,446
What a lovely Chantecler. Well done.

267
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,681
Thanks.

268
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,565
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

269
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,540
Thank you, Miss Ella.

270
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,846
You're welcome.

271
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,420
Ella!

272
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,300
Wake up, girls! It's lunch time!

273
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,041
<i>Mornings did not agree
with Ella's stepsisters.</i>

274
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,020
<i>And they lacked accomplishment</i>

275
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,487
<i>in such domestic arts as keeping house.</i>

276
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,525
<i>In fact, they lacked
accomplishment in any art.</i>

277
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,460
<i>It was a lover and his lass</i>

278
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,086
<i>With a hey, and a ho</i>

279
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,620
<i>And a hey nonino</i>

280
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,363
<i>That o'er the green corn-field did pass</i>

281
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,260
<i>Sweet lovers love</i>

282
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,522
<i>The spring</i>

283
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,401
<i>Sweet lovers love</i>

284
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,485
<i>The spring</i>

285
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,525
Do shut up.

286
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,060
<i>Ella's great comfort</i>

287
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,540
<i>were the letters that Father
would send from his travels.</i>

288
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,780
<i>The weeks away lengthened to months,</i>

289
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,248
<i>but every day would bring his
thoughts from some distant part.</i>

290
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,940
Miss Ella, it's the mail coach!

291
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,771
<i>Until late one afternoon...</i>

292
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,404
Farmer John?

293
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,051
Miss Ella.

294
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,083
It's your father, miss.

295
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,441
He took ill on the road.

296
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,129
He's passed on, miss.

297
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,045
He's gone.

298
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,129
To the end, he spoke only of you, miss.

299
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,761
And your mother.

300
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,881
I was to give you this.

301
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,860
But what about my lace?

302
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,803
My parasol?

303
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,131
Can't you see? None of that matters.

304
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,405
We're ruined.

305
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,685
How will we live?

306
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,485
Thank you.

307
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,811
It must have been
very difficult for you.

308
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,260
<i>How indeed to live.</i>

309
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,380
<i>Economies had to be taken.</i>

310
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,802
<i>Ella's stepmother
dismissed the household.</i>

311
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,845
<i>Her stepmother and stepsisters
ever misused her.</i>

312
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,087
<i>And by and by they considered Ella</i>

313
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,570
<i>less a sister than a servant.</i>

314
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,650
<i>And so Ella was left to do all the work.</i>

315
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,100
<i>This was a good thing,
for it distracted her from her grief.</i>

316
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,601
<i>At least that was what
her stepmother said.</i>

317
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,289
<i>And she and her two daughters
were more than happy</i>

318
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,405
<i>to provide Ella
with lots and lots of distraction.</i>

319
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,001
<i>In their defense,</i>

320
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,283
<i>they did share with her
the very food they ate,</i>

321
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,009
<i>or rather, the scraps from their table.</i>

322
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,405
<i>She had little in the way of friends.</i>

323
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,020
<i>Well, her friends were very little.</i>

324
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,009
There you are.

325
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,683
Have dinner with me, won't you?

326
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,700
<i>But those friends she had,
she treated with an open heart</i>

327
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,643
<i>and an open hand.</i>

328
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,411
Your table.

329
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,340
<i>Sometimes, by the end of the day,</i>

330
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,860
<i>the drafty attic was too cold
to spend the night in,</i>

331
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,980
<i>so she lay by the dying
embers of the hearth</i>

332
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,730
<i>to keep warm.</i>

333
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,780
I thought breakfast was ready.

334
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,260
It is, madam.

335
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,340
I'm only mending the fire.

336
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,260
In future, can we not be called
until the work is done?

337
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,725
As you wish.

338
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,924
Ella, what's that on your face?

339
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,361
Madam?

340
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,162
It's ash from the fireplace.

341
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,530
Do clean yourself up.

342
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,485
You'll get cinders in our tea.

343
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,820
I've got a new name for her!
Cinderwench.

344
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,260
I couldn't bear to look so dirty.

345
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,771
Dirty Ella.

346
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,249
Cinder-ella!

347
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,886
That's what we'll call you.

348
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,562
Girls, you're too clever.

349
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,490
Who's this for?

350
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,561
Is there someone we've forgotten?

351
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,260
It's my place.

352
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,140
It seems too much
to expect you to prepare breakfast,

353
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,460
serve it and still sit with us.

354
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,820
Wouldn't you prefer to eat
when all the work is done, Ella?

355
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,241
Or should I say, "Cinderella"?

356
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,740
<i>Cinderella.</i>

357
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,287
<i>Names have power, like magic spells.</i>

358
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,020
<i>And of a sudden, it seemed to her</i>

359
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,327
<i>that her stepmother and stepsisters</i>

360
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,060
<i>had indeed transformed her</i>

361
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,460
<i>into merely a creature of ash</i>

362
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,800
<i>and toil.</i>

363
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,620
Run!

364
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,165
Quickly, my friend,
or they'll catch you!

365
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,721
Go!

366
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,961
Easy!

367
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,980
<i>Perhaps it was just as well
that Ella's stepsisters were cruel.</i>

368
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,620
<i>For had she not run to the forest,</i>

369
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,404
<i>she might never have met the prince.</i>

370
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,845
Easy! Easy!

371
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,020
Easy, boy!

372
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,360
Come on, boy, slow down!

373
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,340
Miss!

374
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,980
Miss! Are you all right?

375
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,340
Hold on!

376
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,260
I'm all right, thank you!

377
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,521
That's fine.

378
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,210
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right,

379
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,780
but you've nearly frightened
the life out of him.

380
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,086
Who?

381
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,406
The stag.

382
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,690
What's he ever done to you
that you should chase him about?

383
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,620
I must confess
I've never met him before.

384
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,460
He is a friend of yours?

385
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,100
An acquaintance.

386
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,611
We met just now.

387
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,060
I looked into his eyes,

388
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,420
and he looked into mine,

389
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,460
and I just felt he had a great deal
left to do with his life.

390
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,527
That's all.

391
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,927
Miss, what do they call you?

392
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,205
Never mind what they call me.

393
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,420
You shouldn't be this deep
in the forest alone.

394
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,171
I'm not alone. I'm with you, Mister...

395
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,683
What do they call you?

396
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,860
You don't know who I am?

397
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,200
That is...

398
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,086
They call me Kit.

399
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,780
Well, my father does

400
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,325
when he's in a good mood.

401
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,767
And

402
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,060
where do you live, Mr. Kit?

403
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,161
At the palace.

404
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,806
My father's teaching me his trade.

405
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,251
You're an apprentice?

406
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,971
Of a sort.

407
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,860
That's very fine.

408
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,780
Do they treat you well?

409
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,121
Better than I deserve, most likely.

410
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,687
And you?

411
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,840
They treat me as well as they're able.

412
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,331
I'm sorry.

413
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,969
It's not your doing.

414
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,128
Nor yours either, I'll bet.

415
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,644
It's not so very bad.

416
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,201
Others have it worse, I'm sure.

417
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,721
We must

418
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,246
simply have courage
and be kind, mustn't we?

419
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,801
Yes.

420
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,365
You're right.

421
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,529
That's exactly how I feel.

422
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,300
Please don't let them hurt him.

423
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,100
But we're hunting, you see.
It's what's done.

424
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,329
Just because it's what's done
doesn't mean it's what should be done.

425
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,291
Right again.

426
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,806
Then,

427
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,887
you'll leave him alone, won't you?

428
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,886
I will.

429
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,286
Thank you very much, Mr. Kit.

430
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,820
There you are, Your High...

431
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,620
It's Kit! Kit!

432
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,848
Kit! I'm Kit. I'm on my way.

433
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,047
Well, we'd better get a move on,

434
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,844
Mr. Kit.

435
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,885
As I said.

436
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,566
On my way.

437
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,767
I hope to see you again, miss.

438
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,891
And I, you.

439
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,780
You sound as if you're the first fellow
ever to meet a pretty girl.

440
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,620
She wasn't a "pretty girl."

441
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,540
Well, she was a pretty girl,
but there was so much more to her.

442
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,860
How much more? You've only met her once.

443
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,340
How could you know anything about her?

444
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,580
You told me you knew right away
when you met Mother.

445
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,500
That's different.
Your mother was a princess.

446
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,700
You would have loved her anyway.

447
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,900
I would never have seen her, because
it wouldn't have been appropriate.

448
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,601
And my father would have told me what
I'm telling you and I would have listened.

449
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,700
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

450
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,740
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.

451
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,887
- You wouldn't.
- You're right.

452
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,724
Well, how is he?

453
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,805
Your Majesty...

454
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,325
Never mind.

455
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,965
If it takes that long to work out a way
to say it, I already know.

456
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,166
Father...

457
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,009
Way of all flesh, boy.

458
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,081
Come.

459
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,480
We shall be late.

460
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,380
And punctuality is the...

461
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,608
politeness of princes.

462
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,900
His Majesty, the King!

463
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,620
I'm sure your father spoke to you
of your behavior in the forest.

464
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,220
Is it any business of yours, Grand Duke?

465
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,220
Your business is my business,
Your Royal Highness.

466
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,220
It will not do to let the stag go free.

467
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,340
Just because it's what's done
doesn't mean it's what should be done.

468
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,441
Or something like that.

469
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,820
Master Phineus,
master of the paintbrush,

470
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,900
patiently awaits.

471
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,082
Make him look marriageable,
Master Phineus.

472
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,089
We must attract a suitable bride,

473
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,740
even if he won't listen to a word I say.

474
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,260
I shall endeavor to please,
Your Majesty.

475
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,340
But I can't work miracles.

476
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,580
A splendid canvas, Master Phineus.

477
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,620
Thank you.

478
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,500
As if he knows anything about art.

479
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,260
So, these portraits
will really be sent abroad?

480
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,940
To induce the high and mighty
to attend this ball you insist upon.

481
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,220
Which is a tradition. Which is beloved.

482
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,721
At which you will choose a bride.

483
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,980
Fascinating.

484
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,980
If I must marry, could I not wed, say,
a good, honest country girl?

485
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,100
How many divisions will this
"good, honest country girl" provide us?

486
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,300
How will she make the kingdom stronger?

487
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,300
We are a small kingdom amongst
great states, Your Royal Highness.

488
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,731
And it's a dangerous world.

489
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,620
Listen, boy.

490
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,780
- Taking you up, Master Phineus.
- Good.

491
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,680
I want to see you and the kingdom safe.

492
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,409
All right, Father,

493
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,004
on one condition.

494
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,100
Let the invitations go to everyone,
not just the nobility.

495
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,420
The wars have brought sorrow on us all.

496
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,780
What do you think?

497
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,380
Would that please the people?

498
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,660
It's beyond my wit, Your Majesty.

499
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,923
But I wouldn't mind a bit of a jolly.

500
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,641
I think we might have made a bargain.

501
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,380
A ball for the people,

502
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,164
and a princess for the prince.

503
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,180
Sounds like a step in the right direction,
if you ask...

504
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,180
We didn't ask you.

505
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,011
I'm so sorry.
Naughty paint, naughty brush.

506
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,326
Down, please, Samson.

507
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,580
Haven't even got a cushion.

508
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,180
Right, down, down. Not that...

509
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,300
Oi! I'm on the ground.

510
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,768
I am literally on the ground. Sorry.

511
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,260
Actually this is
a very good angle for you.

512
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,522
Great nostrils.
Could I have a longer brush?

513
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,122
You don't look well, miss.

514
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,845
Not at all.

515
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,371
Why do you stay there,
when they treat you so?

516
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,940
Because I made my mother
and father a promise

517
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,540
to cherish the place we were so happy.

518
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,529
They loved our house

519
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,644
and now that they're gone,
I love it for them.

520
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,260
It's my home.

521
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,409
Hear ye! Hear ye!

522
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,161
Quiet!

523
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,881
"Know,

524
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,060
"on this day, two weeks hence,

525
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,900
"there shall be held, at the palace,

526
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,968
"a Royal Ball.

527
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,420
"At said ball,

528
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,700
"in accordance with ancient custom,

529
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,771
"the prince shall choose a bride.

530
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,740
"Furthermore,

531
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,900
"at the behest of the prince,

532
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,260
"it is hereby declared
that every maiden in the kingdom,

533
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,364
"be she noble or commoner,

534
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,807
"is invited to attend.

535
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,163
"Such is the command
of our most noble king."

536
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,060
Excuse me, madam.

537
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,722
<i>Ella was enormously excited
to see Kit, the apprentice.</i>

538
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,980
<i>And her stepsisters
were mildly intrigued</i>

539
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,048
<i>by the notion of meeting the prince.</i>

540
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,860
I shall trick him into loving me.
See if I don't!

541
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,122
This is the most hugest news!

542
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,564
Calm yourselves.

543
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,460
Now listen to me.

544
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,620
One of you must win
the heart of the prince.

545
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,300
Do that, and we can unwind the debt
in which we were ensnared

546
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,845
when we came to this backwater!

547
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,060
I, a princess?

548
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,220
Or rather, I,

549
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,288
a princess?

550
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,900
Having delivered your news,
why are you still here?

551
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,700
You must return to town right away

552
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,849
and tell that seamstress
to run us up three fine ball gowns.

553
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,401
Three?

554
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,409
That's very thoughtful of you.

555
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,140
What do you mean?

556
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,820
To think of me.

557
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,020
Think of you?

558
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,500
Mummy, she believes
the other dress is for her.

559
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,762
Poor, slow, little Cinders.
How embarrassing.

560
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,580
You're too ambitious for your own good.

561
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,570
No. I only want to see my friend.

562
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,964
Let me be very clear.

563
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,820
One gown for Anastasia,

564
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,340
one for Drisella,

565
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,283
and one for me!

566
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,203
She doesn't know what that means.

567
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,700
Good. Right. That's settled then.

568
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,940
Now go!

569
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,260
Every girl in the kingdom
will be chasing the prince.

570
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,180
You must get there first before
the seamstress is drowning in work!

571
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,580
Tell me what she said, Drisella.

572
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,648
I speak French, not Italian!

573
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,260
Wake up, Your Royal Highness.
You're in a daze.

574
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,500
I'm sorry.

575
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,700
You've been off since the hunt.

576
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,724
It's that wonderful girl.
I can't stop thinking about her.

577
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,300
But there are plenty of girls.

578
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,900
But her spirit, her goodness...

579
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,380
You don't suppose
she has a sister, do you?

580
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,740
I don't know.

581
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,580
I don't know anything about her.

582
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,048
Perhaps your mystery girl
may come to the ball.

583
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,060
That is why you threw
the doors open, is it not?

584
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,500
Captain. It was for the benefit
of the people.

585
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,660
Of course. How shallow of me.

586
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,380
And if she comes, then what?

587
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,060
Then you will tell her you're a prince.

588
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,740
And a prince may take
whichever bride he wishes.

589
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,900
- Ha!
- Ha?

590
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,001
Yes, "ha."

591
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,260
You know my father and the Grand Duke
will only have me marry a princess.

592
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,887
Well, if this girl from the forest
is as charming as you say,

593
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,240
they may change their minds.

594
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,100
<i>The day of the ball arrived</i>

595
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,285
<i>and the entire kingdom
held its breath in anticipation.</i>

596
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,331
<i>You want me to be your queen?</i>

597
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,931
Who? Me?

598
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,326
Tighter.

599
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,685
Tighter!

600
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,361
Tighter.

601
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,331
That's it!

602
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,100
A vision, sister.

603
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,460
Likewise.

604
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,340
We must compete for the prince's hand.

605
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,020
But let it not mean we harbor
dark thoughts against each other.

606
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,690
Of course not, dear sister.

607
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,100
I wouldn't dream of poisoning you
before we leave for the ball.

608
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,820
Nor I of pushing you from
a moving carriage on the way there.

609
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,300
Or I of dashing your brains out
on the palace steps as we arrive.

610
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,060
We are sisters, after all.

611
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,980
And blood is so much thicker than water.

612
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,900
We shall let the prince decide.

613
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,729
What will he be like, I wonder?

614
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,300
What does it matter what he's like?

615
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,050
He's rich beyond reason.

616
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,460
Wouldn't you like to know
a bit about him before you marry him?

617
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,940
Certainly not. It might change my mind.

618
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,860
I bet you have never
ever spoken to a man.

619
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,883
Have you, moon-face?

620
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,180
I have, once.

621
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,361
To a gentleman.

622
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,730
Some menial, no doubt.

623
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,340
Some 'prentice.

624
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,820
He was an apprentice, yes.

625
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,180
All men are fools,
that's what Mama says.

626
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,884
The sooner you learn that, the better.

627
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,287
The first dance, milady?

628
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,047
Prince Charming, you're so naughty!

629
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,740
- I want to try it.
- No, I'm wearing it.

630
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,205
No! No!

631
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,020
<i>Not for the first time,</i>

632
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,380
<i>Ella actually felt pity
for these two schemers,</i>

633
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,327
<i>who could be every bit as ugly within
as they were fair without.</i>

634
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,860
My prince!

635
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,900
He will love me!

636
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,968
But I will be his queen!

637
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,260
<i>If her stepmother
would not have a fourth dress made,</i>

638
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,100
<i>it seemed to Ella
that there was no reason why</i>

639
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,806
<i>she would not try to run it up herself.</i>

640
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,850
<i>And besides, she did have a little help.</i>

641
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,047
My dear girls.

642
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,005
To see you like this,

643
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,300
it makes me believe
one of you might just snare the prince.

644
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,847
And to think
I have two horses in the race!

645
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,924
I daresay no one in the kingdom
will outshine my daughters.

646
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,780
Cinderella?

647
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,609
It cost you nothing.

648
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,380
It was my mother's old dress, you see.

649
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,925
And I took it up myself.

650
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,580
Cinderella at the ball!

651
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,620
No one wants a servant for a bride.

652
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,220
After all I've done...

653
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,100
I don't want to ruin anything.
I don't even want to meet the prince.

654
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,170
And you won't, because
there's no question of your going.

655
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,620
But, all of the maidens
of the land are invited,

656
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,500
by order of the king.

657
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,220
It is the king I am thinking of.

658
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,460
It would be an insult
to the royal personage

659
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,780
to take you to the palace
dressed in these old rags.

660
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,166
Rags?

661
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,250
This was my mother's.

662
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,643
I'm sorry to have to tell you

663
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,650
but your mother's taste
was questionable.

664
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,969
This thing is so old-fashioned

665
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,760
it's practically falling to pieces.

666
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,300
The shoulder's frayed.

667
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,767
- It's falling to bits.
- And this!

668
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,082
It's a ridiculous, old-fashioned joke!

669
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,605
How could you?

670
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,086
How could I otherwise?

671
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,340
I will not have anyone
associate my daughters with you.

672
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,660
It would ruin their prospects

673
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,491
to be seen arriving
with a ragged servant girl.

674
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,660
Because that is what you are.

675
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,940
And that is what you will always be.

676
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,940
Now mark my words!

677
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,520
You shall not go to the ball!

678
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,450
Go on, get going!

679
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,810
I'm sorry, Mother.

680
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,005
I'm sorry.

681
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,900
I said I'd have courage, but I don't.

682
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,490
Not anymore.

683
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,683
I don't believe anymore.

684
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,401
Excuse me.

685
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,700
Can you help me, miss?

686
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,089
Just a little crust of bread,
or better, a cup of milk?

687
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,521
Yes.

688
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,762
Yes, yes, yes.
I think I can find something for you.

689
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,460
Why are you crying?

690
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,050
It's nothing.

691
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,620
Nothing?

692
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,700
Nothing.

693
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,246
What is a bowl of milk? Nothing.

694
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,767
But kindness makes it everything.

695
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,685
Now, I don't mean to hurry you,
but you really haven't got long, Ella.

696
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,929
How do you know me?

697
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,761
Who are you?

698
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,160
Who am I?

699
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,408
I should think
you'd have worked that one out.

700
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,100
I'm your hairy dogfather.

701
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,089
I mean, fairy godmother!

702
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,921
You can't be.

703
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,401
Why not?

704
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,484
They don't exist.

705
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,460
They're just made up for children.

706
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,900
Didn't your own mother believe in them?

707
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,161
Don't say no, because I heard her.

708
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,921
You heard her?

709
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,123
Fiddle-faddle, fiddle-faddle.

710
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,447
Right! First things first.

711
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,640
Let me slip into something
more comfortable.

712
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,001
That's better.

713
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,648
Now, where was I?

714
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,860
How did you...

715
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,060
Yes. Let's see.

716
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,960
What we need is something
that sort of says, "coach."

717
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,641
That trough?

718
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,650
Doesn't really say "coach."

719
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,081
No, no, I'm liking fruit and veg.

720
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,580
Do you grow watermelons?

721
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,660
No.

722
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,740
Cantaloupe?

723
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,900
I don't even know what that is.

724
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,260
Artichoke?

725
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,500
Kumquat?

726
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,726
Beef tomato?

727
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,482
We do have pumpkins.

728
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,580
Pumpkins?

729
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,060
This will be a first for me.

730
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,321
Always interesting.

731
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,860
I don't usually work with squashes.

732
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,007
Too mushy.

733
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,930
Let me see. That'll do. Yes. Knife?

734
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,606
- There you are.
- Thank you, darling.

735
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,660
Hello, my strangely orange
vegetable friend.

736
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,807
A quick snip for you.

737
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,660
Lovely!

738
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,171
Heavy pumpkin!

739
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,285
Look out, mices!

740
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,740
Well. Never mind.

741
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,900
Let's do it here.

742
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,180
Do what here?

743
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,930
Turn the pumpkin into a carriage.

744
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,220
You're making me nervous, actually.

745
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,209
- Shall I shut my eyes?
- It might be better.

746
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,010
For heaven's sake. Let's just go for it.

747
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,260
Well, something's definitely happening.

748
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,725
You see, the trick is...

749
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,362
Actually, I've forgotten
what the trick is.

750
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,620
I just thought, if it...

751
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,460
If it does get much bigger...

752
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,607
Yes?

753
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,527
Hang on.

754
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,125
Is that what you meant to do?

755
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,180
Do you think that's what I meant to do?

756
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,281
Run! Run, darling!

757
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,721
Take cover!

758
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,250
There! One carriage.

759
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,645
You really are my fairy godmother.

760
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,780
Of course.

761
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,247
I don't go about transforming
pumpkins for just anybody.

762
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,043
Now, where are those mice?

763
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,924
- Mice?
- Yes.

764
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,451
Mice, mice, mice.

765
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,580
There they are.

766
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,444
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

767
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,603
Four white chargers.

768
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,882
Gus-Gus, how fine you look!

769
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,650
But how did you...

770
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,060
Now, where are we?

771
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,721
Got carriage, horses... Footmen!

772
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,561
Footmen?

773
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,380
Hello, lovely Mr. Lizard.

774
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,925
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

775
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,564
Hello!

776
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,810
You called?

777
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,060
Now, I need that coachman.

778
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,380
Coachman?

779
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,369
Did I say "coachman"? I meant "goose."

780
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,408
I can't drive. I'm a goose.

781
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,885
Now, shoo!

782
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,965
Everyone into place, no time to be lost!

783
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,045
Come on!

784
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,361
Fairy Godmother!

785
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,360
Yes, what?

786
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,491
My dress.

787
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,330
I can't go in this dress.

788
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,084
- Can you mend it?
- Mend it?

789
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,780
No, no. I'll turn it into something new.

790
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,740
No, please don't.

791
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,808
This was my mother's.

792
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,361
And I'd like to wear it
when I go to the palace.

793
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,527
It's almost like taking her with me.

794
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,211
I understand.

795
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,050
But she wouldn't mind
if I gee it up a bit?

796
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,049
Wouldn't mind a nice blue?

797
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,406
No.

798
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,241
There.

799
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,409
It's beautiful.

800
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,205
She'd love it.

801
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,447
Now, come on. Off you go. Quick!

802
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,931
You'll be late!

803
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,131
I'm very new at this!

804
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,606
Oh, boy.

805
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,928
Stop that blooming coach!

806
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,125
Thank you.

807
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,761
Just a moment!

808
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,085
Are those the best you have?

809
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,290
It's all right. No one will see them.

810
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,204
No, they'll ruin the whole look.
Quick, quick.

811
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,500
Take them off. Really quite hideous.

812
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,860
Let's have something new for a change.

813
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,041
I'm rather good at shoes.

814
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,641
But...

815
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,682
They're made of glass?

816
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,001
Yes.

817
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,443
And you'll find
they're really comfortable.

818
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,643
Ella, you really must go now.

819
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,580
Fairy Godmother?

820
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,011
What is it?

821
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,380
My stepmother and the girls?

822
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,620
Don't worry.

823
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,485
I'll make sure they don't recognize you.

824
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,561
Now, off you go.

825
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,207
For you shall go to the ball.

826
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,568
In you get. So lovely.

827
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,170
Do stop wittering on.

828
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,700
Ella!

829
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,900
I almost forgot.

830
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,420
Remember, the magic
will only last so long.

831
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,820
With the last echo of the last bell,

832
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,660
at the last stroke of midnight,

833
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,900
the spell will be broken

834
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,401
and all will return
to what it was before.

835
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,060
Midnight?

836
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,286
Midnight.

837
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,409
That's more than enough time.

838
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,884
- Off you go then.
- Thank you.

839
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,047
Thank you.

840
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,208
Goosey, go!

841
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,001
Goodbye!

842
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,206
Chandeliers, aloft!

843
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,085
Princess Mei Mei of Fujian.

844
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,060
Princess Shahrzad of the Seljuqs.

845
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,571
Your Highness!

846
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,249
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa!

847
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,487
Princess Imani of Shona!

848
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,331
Princess Hiina
of the Chrysanthemum Throne!

849
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,488
Lady Tremaine and her daughters.

850
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,047
The Lady Tremaine and her daughters.

851
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,140
I'm Drisella.

852
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,220
And I'm Anastasia.

853
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,540
- People will want to know.
- I'm the clever one.

854
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,165
I'm very beautiful.

855
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,660
The very clever Miss Drisella,

856
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,082
and the very beautiful Anastasia.

857
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,443
Do come on!

858
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,489
The Lord Veneering.

859
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,648
Who are you looking for?

860
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,241
No one.

861
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,540
It's that girl in the forest, isn't it?

862
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,620
That's why you were so generous
with the invitations.

863
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,210
Father, it was for the people.

864
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,891
I know you love the people, Kit.

865
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,300
But I also know
that your head's been turned.

866
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,100
But you've only met her once,
in the forest.

867
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,020
And you would have me
marry someone I met once, tonight.

868
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,620
A princess.

869
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,121
It's a princess or nothing.

870
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,484
Hold the doors! One more coming in.

871
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,580
May I present Her Royal Highness,

872
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,763
the Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.

873
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,643
You are as handsome as your picture.

874
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,891
And your little kingdom is enchanting.

875
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,244
I hope the princess will not find
our "little kingdom" too confining.

876
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,250
Miss Ella.

877
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,290
Thank you.

878
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,649
I'm frightened, Mr. Lizard.

879
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,003
I'm only a girl, not a princess.

880
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,410
And I'm only a lizard, not a footman.

881
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,489
Enjoy it while it lasts.

882
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,881
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness,

883
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,368
My Lords, ladies and gentlemen,

884
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,324
distinguished visitors
and people of our land,

885
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,088
the prince shall now choose his partner
for the first dance.

886
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,921
Let our ball commence!

887
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,204
Excuse me.

888
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,380
A thousand apologies,
Your Royal Highness.

889
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,005
I don't know what happened.

890
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,525
Mr. Kit.

891
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,490
It's you,

892
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,767
isn't it?

893
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,283
Just so.

894
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,003
Your Highness...

895
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,460
If I may,

896
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,925
that is,

897
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,180
it would give me the greatest pleasure,

898
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,860
if you would do me the honor
of letting me lead you through this...

899
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,200
the first...

900
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,325
Dance?

901
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,245
Yes, dance.

902
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,611
That's it.

903
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,369
They're all looking at you.

904
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,684
Believe me, they're all looking at you.

905
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,609
Who is she?

906
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,285
I have no idea.

907
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,566
Who's that, Mama?

908
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,180
I'm not exactly sure,
but this does not bode well.

909
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,700
That's a lovely dress she's got on.

910
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,540
- And how pretty she is.
- Concentrate!

911
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,540
You must turn the prince's head,
you fools! Now, get out there!

912
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,900
But no one's asked us to dance.

913
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,020
Gentlemen.

914
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,281
May I present my daughters,

915
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,380
- Anastasia, Drisella.
- <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

916
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,369
Off you go!

917
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,571
Smile.

918
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,161
Come with me.

919
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,482
Over there. Smile.

920
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,170
So, you're the prince!

921
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,460
Not "the prince," exactly.

922
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,006
There are plenty of princes
in the world. I'm only a prince.

923
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,020
But your name's not really Kit.

924
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,180
Certainly it is,
and my father still calls me that,

925
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,820
when he's especially un-peeved at me.

926
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,260
But you're no apprentice.

927
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,820
I am. An apprentice monarch.

928
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,445
Still learning my trade.

929
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,540
Oh, gosh!

930
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,420
Look, please forgive me.

931
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,580
I thought you might treat me
differently if you knew.

932
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,940
I mistook you
for a good, honest country girl,

933
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,300
and now I see you didn't want
to overawe a plain soldier.

934
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,100
Little chance of that.

935
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,884
No more surprises?

936
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,565
No more surprises.

937
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,891
Is that you?

938
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,327
I hate myself in paintings. Don't you?

939
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,940
No one's ever painted my portrait.

940
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,566
No? Well, they should.

941
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,820
Who is she?

942
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,140
She gave no name, Your Grace.

943
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,220
You didn't ask?

944
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,300
I was out of breath, Your Grace,
on account of introducing

945
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,460
Princess Blodwyn
of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll...

946
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,722
- Shut up, will you?
- "Shut up." Absolutely.

947
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,003
I don't believe this!

948
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,564
No! Not her!

949
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,323
Won't they miss you at the ball?

950
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,806
Maybe.

951
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,129
But let's not go back just yet.

952
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,251
What's wrong?

953
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,900
When I go back,

954
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,180
they will try to pair me off
with a lady of their choosing.

955
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,806
I'm expected to marry for advantage.

956
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,740
Well, whose advantage?

957
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,683
That is a good question.

958
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,500
Well, surely you have a right
to your own heart.

959
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,180
And I must weigh that
against the king's wishes.

960
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,126
He's a wise ruler and a loving father.

961
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,690
Well, perhaps he'll change his mind.

962
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,006
I fear he hasn't much time to do so.

963
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,324
Poor Kit.

964
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,860
People are saying she's a princess.

965
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,380
Our prince seems quite taken with her.

966
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,209
She went straight for him.

967
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,740
You have to appreciate her efficiency.

968
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,731
But surely, if she is a princess,
this may be good.

969
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,450
I've already promised him in marriage,
to the Princess Chelina.

970
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,326
But...

971
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,649
Forgive me, Your Grace.

972
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,081
I did not mean to intrude.

973
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,082
No, it's you who have
to forgive me, madam.

974
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,888
Your secret is safe with me.

975
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,922
I've never shown this place to anyone.

976
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,043
A secret garden.

977
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,965
I love it!

978
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,521
Please.

979
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,780
No, I shouldn't.

980
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,927
You should.

981
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,441
- I shouldn't.
- You should.

982
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,806
I will.

983
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,561
May I?

984
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,926
Please.

985
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,845
It's made of glass.

986
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,090
And why not?

987
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,601
Allow me.

988
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,609
Thank you.

989
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,081
There.

990
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,841
There.

991
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,285
Won't you tell me who you really are?

992
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,649
If I do, I think
everything might be different.

993
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,964
I don't understand.
Can you at least tell me your name?

994
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,211
My name is...

995
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,210
I have to leave.

996
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,165
It's hard to explain.

997
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,968
Lizards and pumpkins, and things.

998
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,120
Wait!

999
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,041
Where are you going?

1000
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,483
You've been awfully nice.

1001
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,688
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
I've loved it.

1002
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,006
Every second!

1003
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,845
"Lizards and pumpkins."

1004
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,566
Excuse me.

1005
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,722
Sorry! Terribly sorry.

1006
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,281
My goodness!

1007
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,404
My prince!

1008
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,684
You've got the wrong one!

1009
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,441
He needs her name!

1010
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,561
I know he needs her name.

1011
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,580
Her name, you ninny. Get her name!

1012
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,444
That really hurt!

1013
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,420
Your Majesty.

1014
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,660
Young lady.

1015
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,780
I am so sorry.

1016
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,370
Think nothing of it, my dear.

1017
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,644
I wanted to say, Your Majesty,

1018
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,280
your son Kit is the most lovely
person I ever met.

1019
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,244
So good and brave.

1020
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,127
I hope you know how much he loves you.

1021
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,725
Excuse me!

1022
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,405
Wait!

1023
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,764
Wait!

1024
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,201
Where are you going?

1025
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,606
Hurry, hurry!

1026
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,924
Come back!

1027
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,081
Hurry!

1028
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,641
Hurry, please, Mr. Goose!

1029
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,931
Wait!

1030
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,602
Watch out!

1031
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,361
Captain, my horse.

1032
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,521
No!

1033
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,604
This may be some intrigue
to lure you from the palace.

1034
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,689
Your father needs you here.

1035
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,006
Captain!

1036
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,525
I was having a fine old time.

1037
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,007
You had to go and choose that one,
didn't you?

1038
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,529
Yes, I did.

1039
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,926
Hurry, Mr. Goose!

1040
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,286
Come on!

1041
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,900
Hee-ya!

1042
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,684
Be careful, Mr. Goose!

1043
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,241
Oh, my goodness!

1044
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,047
You there! Stop in the name of the king!

1045
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,090
Such bad timing.

1046
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,260
Halt there!

1047
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,521
I know what to do!

1048
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,161
Yes!

1049
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,520
Get this thing open!

1050
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,881
Oh, dear!

1051
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,846
No, no, no.

1052
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,126
I'm sorry.

1053
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,805
You'll find it's very comfortable.

1054
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,089
Do shut up!

1055
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,481
Cinderella!

1056
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,484
Cinderella! We'll have to wake her up.

1057
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,845
Cinderella!

1058
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,809
Wake up, lazy bones!

1059
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,900
Tea and a plate of biscuits.

1060
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,220
Welcome back!

1061
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,288
- You look cheerful!
- And wet!

1062
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,060
I took a walk in the rain
to cheer myself up.

1063
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,140
Typical.

1064
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,287
Tea.

1065
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,860
We did not communicate
through mere words.

1066
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,060
Our souls met.

1067
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,766
Precisely. My soul
and the prince's soul.

1068
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,365
Your soul was over
by the banquet tables.

1069
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,204
You didn't see him dance with me.

1070
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,648
Dance with you?
He didn't even speak to you.

1071
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,121
It was not our fault, Mother.
It was that girl.

1072
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,691
The mystery princess.

1073
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,524
Mystery princess?

1074
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,684
My, what a charming notion.

1075
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,365
She was no princess.

1076
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,683
She was a preening interloper
who made a spectacle of herself.

1077
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,128
A vulgar, young hussy
marched into the ball,

1078
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,522
unaccompanied, if you will,

1079
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,007
and to the horror of everyone,
threw herself at the prince.

1080
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,482
And he actually danced
with the ugly thing.

1081
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,660
- Yes?
- Yes.

1082
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:05,780
It was pity.

1083
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,690
He was too polite to send her packing
in front of everyone, you see.

1084
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,740
But not wanting to expose us
to the presumptuous wench any further,

1085
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,460
- he took her apart.
- And told her off.

1086
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,940
But she refused to leave

1087
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:19,044
and the palace guards
chased her from the party!

1088
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,780
I pity the prince. Such bad taste.

1089
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,380
They belong with each other.

1090
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,970
Well, it's no matter, girls.

1091
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,500
The ball was a mere diversion.

1092
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,364
The prince is not free
to marry for love.

1093
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,482
He's promised to the
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.

1094
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,208
The Grand Duke told me himself.

1095
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,328
It's so very unfair.

1096
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,330
Yes.

1097
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:43,081
The way of the world.

1098
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,762
Hello again.

1099
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,445
Thank you for your help.

1100
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,283
It really was like a dream.

1101
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,762
Better than a dream.

1102
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,340
<i>Ella couldn't wait to write down
all that had happened,</i>

1103
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,683
<i>so that she might remember
every single bit of it</i>

1104
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,060
<i>just as if she were telling
her mother and father</i>

1105
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:38,529
<i>about the palace ball
and her time with the prince.</i>

1106
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,725
<i>Above all, the prince.</i>

1107
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,010
You've come.

1108
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,687
Good.

1109
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,091
Father.

1110
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,331
Don't go.

1111
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,851
I must.

1112
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,928
You needn't be alone.

1113
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,608
Take a bride.

1114
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,047
The Princess Chelina.

1115
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,763
What if I commanded you to do so?

1116
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,763
I love and respect you, but I will not.

1117
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,164
I believe that we need not
look outside of our borders

1118
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,527
for strength or guidance.

1119
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,441
What we need is right before us.

1120
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:55,525
And we need only have courage
and be kind to see it.

1121
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,205
Just so.

1122
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,247
You've become your own man.

1123
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,880
Good.

1124
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,209
And perhaps,
in the little time left to me,

1125
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,210
I can become the father you deserve.

1126
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,844
You must not marry for advantage.

1127
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,767
You must marry for love.

1128
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,763
Find that girl.

1129
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,771
Find her.

1130
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,526
The one they're all talking about.

1131
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,180
The forgetful one

1132
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,328
- who loses her shoes.
- ...loses her shoes.

1133
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,127
Be cheerful, boy.

1134
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,442
Thank you, Father.

1135
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,882
Thank you, Kit.

1136
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,728
I love you, son.

1137
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,289
I love you, Father.

1138
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,340
<i>Once the time for mourning had passed,</i>

1139
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,860
<i>a proclamation was sent out.</i>

1140
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,567
Hear ye! Hear ye!

1141
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,001
Hear ye!

1142
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,820
Know that our new king

1143
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,606
hereby declares his love for

1144
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,651
the mysterious princess

1145
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,321
as wore

1146
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,763
glass slippers to the ball.

1147
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:19,165
And requests that she present herself
at the palace,

1148
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:23,530
whereupon, if she be willing,

1149
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:29,121
he will forthwith marry her

1150
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,966
with all due ceremony.

1151
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,084
Are you looking for this?

1152
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,020
There must be quite a story
to go with it.

1153
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,610
Won't you tell me?

1154
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,081
No?

1155
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,171
All right then.

1156
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,766
I shall tell you a story.

1157
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,444
Once upon a time,

1158
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,285
there was a beautiful young girl

1159
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,882
who married for love.

1160
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:35,010
And she had two loving daughters.

1161
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,123
All was well.

1162
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,921
But, one day, her husband,

1163
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,771
the light of her life, died.

1164
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,965
The next time,

1165
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,124
she married for the sake
of her daughters.

1166
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:53,285
But that man, too, was taken from her.

1167
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:59,123
And she was doomed to look
every day upon his beloved child.

1168
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,180
She had hoped to marry off

1169
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,860
one of her beautiful,
stupid daughters to the prince.

1170
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,806
But his head was turned
by a girl with glass slippers.

1171
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,891
And so,

1172
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,920
I lived unhappily ever after.

1173
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,891
My story would appear to be ended.

1174
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,404
Now, tell me yours.

1175
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,491
Did you steal it?

1176
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:29,487
No.

1177
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,300
It was given to me.

1178
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,380
Given to you?

1179
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,460
Given to you. Nothing is ever given.

1180
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,483
For everything, we must pay and pay.

1181
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,091
That's not true.

1182
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,124
Kindness is free. Love is free.

1183
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,282
Love is not free.

1184
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:48,740
Now, here is how you will pay me,

1185
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,922
if you are to have what you desire.

1186
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:56,762
No one will believe you,
a dirty servant girl without a family,

1187
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,287
if you lay claim to the prince's heart.

1188
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,011
But with a respectable gentlewoman
to put you forward,

1189
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,690
you will not be ignored.

1190
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,420
When you are married,

1191
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,180
you will make me
the head of the royal household.

1192
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,420
Anastasia and Drisella
we will pair off with wealthy lords.

1193
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,683
And I shall manage that boy.

1194
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,049
But he's not a boy.

1195
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,370
And who are you?

1196
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,882
How would you rule a kingdom?

1197
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,166
Best to leave it to me.

1198
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,566
That way we all get what we want.

1199
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:29,887
No.

1200
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,325
No?

1201
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,129
I was not able to protect
my father from you,

1202
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,720
but I will protect the prince
and the kingdom,

1203
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,369
no matter what becomes of me.

1204
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,882
Well, that is a mistake.

1205
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,845
No!

1206
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,246
Why?

1207
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,567
Why are you so cruel?

1208
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,140
I don't understand it.

1209
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,083
I've tried to be kind to you.

1210
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,900
You? Kind to me?

1211
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,140
Yes.

1212
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,580
And though no one deserves to be treated

1213
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,409
as you have treated me.

1214
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,730
Why do you do it?

1215
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,680
Why?

1216
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:18,240
Because you are young,
and innocent, and good.

1217
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,925
And I...

1218
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,126
No!

1219
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,129
May I ask where you got this?

1220
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,931
From a ragged servant girl
in my household.

1221
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,124
The mystery princess is a commoner.

1222
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,285
You could imagine when I discovered
her subterfuge how horrified I was.

1223
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,566
You told no one else?

1224
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,361
Not even my own daughters.

1225
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,930
No one need ever know the truth.

1226
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:58,641
You've spared the kingdom
a great deal of embarrassment.

1227
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:02,450
And I should like to keep it that way.

1228
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,404
Are you threatening me?

1229
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,166
Yes.

1230
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,605
So what do you want?

1231
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,482
I should like to be a countess.

1232
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:22,245
And I require advantageous marriages
for my two daughters.

1233
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,646
Done.

1234
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,641
And the girl?

1235
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,127
Do with her what you will.

1236
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,605
She's nothing to me.

1237
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,500
- Where?
- Abandoned on the side of the road.

1238
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,980
- And have you found her?
- The girl?

1239
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,525
No, she's disappeared.

1240
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,700
There must be some reason she vanished.

1241
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,700
Perhaps she has been prevented
from speaking.

1242
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,900
Do not lose heart, Kit.

1243
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,844
On the contrary,
lose heart and gain wisdom.

1244
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,124
The people need to know
that the kingdom is secure.

1245
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,529
That the king has a queen,
and the land may have an heir.

1246
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,860
They want to face the future
with certainty!

1247
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,940
Agreed! Then let us be certain.

1248
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,500
I am king.

1249
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,260
I say we shall seek out
the mystery princess,

1250
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,100
even if she does not want to be found.

1251
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,860
I have to see her again.

1252
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,724
But if she's not found,

1253
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,210
then for the good of the kingdom,
you must marry the Princess Chelina.

1254
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,406
For the good of the kingdom.

1255
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,324
Very well, agreed.

1256
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,891
But Your Highness...

1257
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,890
But you will spare no effort.

1258
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,244
Your Majesty, of course.
You have my word.

1259
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,521
Next.

1260
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,963
<i>The slipper traveled the length
and breadth of the kingdom,</i>

1261
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,340
<i>visiting every maiden both high and low,</i>

1262
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,727
<i>and every sort in between.</i>

1263
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,121
Oh, Lord!

1264
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,340
You first, madam.

1265
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,011
Well, I'll give it a go.

1266
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,566
Right. I say. Where do you want me?

1267
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,651
Up! Up I go.

1268
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,006
Careful, my foot's a bit swollen.
I've been...

1269
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,082
It's the yeast.

1270
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,180
<i>The Grand Duke was true to his word.</i>

1271
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,980
<i>He spared no effort
to demonstrate to the prince</i>

1272
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,620
<i>that the mystery princess
was not to be found.</i>

1273
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,700
It fits!

1274
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,740
- It doesn't fit you.
- It does fit!

1275
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,001
- It doesn't fit.
- It's mine!

1276
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,500
- I am the mystery princess!
- Give back the shoe.

1277
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,540
Take the shoe away from her!

1278
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,820
Don't take the shoe away from me,
please, please!

1279
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,160
Please, it's my shoe!

1280
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,650
Make way for the slipper!

1281
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,140
Can I try the other foot?

1282
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,526
I don't think so.

1283
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,660
<i>But whatever they tried,</i>

1284
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,580
<i>the magical slipper refused to fit
even the most eligible of maidens.</i>

1285
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,331
We found the mystery princess for ya!

1286
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,284
What's wrong, Captain?

1287
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,169
We haven't found the girl.

1288
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,020
I'm disappointed for our king.

1289
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,380
Come on, now! Don't lose heart.

1290
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,130
There's one more house.

1291
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:46,206
We must leave no stone unturned.

1292
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,100
- Horses!
- Horses!

1293
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,010
Mother, it's our chance!

1294
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,249
Let them in!

1295
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,940
Gentlemen! What a wonderful surprise.

1296
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,900
A moment of your time, good lady.

1297
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,968
Of course, Your Grace.

1298
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,082
Please. This way.

1299
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,940
<i>Ella did not know who was downstairs.</i>

1300
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,405
<i>Nor did she care.</i>

1301
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,980
<i>For surely no one had come to see her.</i>

1302
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,241
Jacqueline, stop it!

1303
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,687
It shrunk.

1304
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,006
Try again.

1305
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,605
Enough!

1306
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,820
<i>You must love me...</i>

1307
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,940
<i>Though Ella was sad,
her spirit was not broken.</i>

1308
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,008
<i>She knew that the ball,</i>

1309
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,420
<i>and her time with the prince,</i>

1310
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,060
<i>would become
beautiful, distant memories,</i>

1311
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,620
<i>like those of her father and mother,</i>

1312
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,007
<i>and her golden childhood.</i>

1313
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,649
It fits me!

1314
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,761
Bad luck, miss.

1315
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,300
<i>Lavender's green dilly, dilly</i>

1316
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:27,051
<i>Lavender's blue</i>

1317
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,324
<i>You must love me dilly, dilly</i>

1318
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,482
<i>For I love you</i>

1319
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,780
<i>Very well.</i>

1320
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,325
Our task is done, Captain.

1321
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,606
But fate may yet be kind to us, girls.

1322
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,060
Indeed, madam!

1323
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,060
<i>When I am king dilly, dilly</i>

1324
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,367
<i>You shall be queen</i>

1325
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,460
<i>Lavender's green dilly, dilly</i>

1326
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,324
<i>Lavender's blue</i>

1327
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,928
<i>If you love me</i>

1328
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,100
<i>Dilly, dilly</i>

1329
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,680
<i>I will love you</i>

1330
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,684
<i>Let the birds sing dilly, dilly</i>

1331
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,451
<i>And the lambs play</i>

1332
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,845
<i>We shall be safe dilly, dilly..</i>

1333
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,884
Do you hear that, Your Grace?

1334
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:17,980
Let's be off, Captain.

1335
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,286
Just a moment.

1336
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,761
Madam,

1337
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:27,123
there is no other maiden in your house?

1338
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,725
None.

1339
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:33,928
Then has your cat learned to sing?

1340
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,140
There's been enough play-acting today,
Captain. Let's be off.

1341
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,180
But she's lying, Your Grace.

1342
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,860
Nonsense! I trust the lady.
We're leaving.

1343
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,086
Grand Duke!

1344
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,442
Your Majesty.

1345
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:01,042
What sweet singing.
Makes me want to tarry just a little.

1346
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,500
Your Majesty, I did not know...

1347
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,500
Captain, would you be so kind
as to investigate?

1348
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,286
It would be my pleasure, Your Majesty.

1349
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,726
<i>If you love me dilly, dilly</i>

1350
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,569
<i>I will love you</i>

1351
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,460
There! You see?

1352
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,820
I told you it was no one
of any importance.

1353
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,649
We'll see about that.

1354
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,681
Miss.

1355
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,251
You are requested and required
to present yourself to your king.

1356
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,140
I forbid you to do this!

1357
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,607
And I forbid you to forbid her!

1358
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,284
Who are you to stop
an officer of the king?

1359
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,370
Are you an empress?

1360
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:43,961
A saint?

1361
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:45,925
A deity?

1362
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,044
I am her mother.

1363
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,443
You have never been

1364
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:59,650
and you never will be my mother.

1365
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,485
Come now, miss.

1366
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,449
Just remember who you are, you wretch!

1367
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:32,300
<i>Would who she was,
who she really was, be enough?</i>

1368
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,260
<i>There was no magic
to help her this time.</i>

1369
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,900
<i>This is perhaps the greatest risk
that any of us will take.</i>

1370
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,561
<i>To be seen as we truly are.</i>

1371
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:47,690
<i>Have courage, and be kind.</i>

1372
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,410
Who are you?

1373
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,083
I am Cinderella.

1374
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,644
Your Majesty,

1375
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,729
I'm no princess.

1376
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,043
I have no carriage,

1377
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,730
no parents,

1378
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,409
and no dowry.

1379
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,564
I do not even know
if that beautiful slipper will fit.

1380
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,165
But

1381
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,605
if it does,

1382
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,846
will you take me as I am?

1383
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,766
An honest country girl who loves you.

1384
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,002
Of course I will.

1385
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:14,323
But only if you will take me as I am.

1386
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,522
An apprentice still learning his trade.

1387
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,767
Please.

1388
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,700
Cinderella!

1389
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,961
Ella!

1390
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,322
My dear sister! I'm sorry.

1391
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,289
So very sorry.

1392
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,006
Shall we?

1393
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,245
I forgive you.

1394
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,940
<i>Forgiven or not,</i>

1395
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:27,900
<i>Cinderella's stepmother
and her daughters</i>

1396
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,980
<i>would soon leave with the Grand Duke,</i>

1397
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,209
<i>and never set foot in the kingdom again.</i>

1398
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,540
They would have loved each other.

1399
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,020
We must have a portrait of you painted.

1400
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:48,726
No. I do hate myself in paintings.

1401
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:49,966
Be kind.

1402
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,980
And have courage.

1403
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:54,844
And all will be well.

1404
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,500
Are you ready?

1405
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,444
For anything, so long as it's with you.

1406
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,010
My queen.

1407
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,760
My Kit.

1408
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,600
<i>And so Kit and Ella were married,</i>

1409
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,620
<i>and I can tell you,
as her fairy godmother,</i>

1410
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,100
<i>that they were counted to be</i>

1411
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:46,047
<i>the fairest and kindest rulers
the kingdom had known.</i>

1412
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:50,620
<i>And Ella continued to see
the world not as it is,</i>

1413
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,820
<i>but as it could be,</i>

1414
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,780
<i>if only you believe in courage</i>

1415
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:59,180
<i>and kindness and occasionally,</i>

1416
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:03,285
<i>just a little bit of magic.</i>

1417
01:39:16,915 --> 01:39:20,519
<i>In a perfect storybook</i>

1418
01:39:20,619 --> 01:39:23,989
<i>The world is brave and good</i>

1419
01:39:24,089 --> 01:39:26,525
<i>A hero takes your hand</i>

1420
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:28,627
<i>A sweet love</i>

1421
01:39:28,727 --> 01:39:30,596
<i>Will find love</i>

1422
01:39:30,696 --> 01:39:34,366
<i>But life's a different game</i>

1423
01:39:34,466 --> 01:39:37,836
<i>The sorrow and the pain</i>

1424
01:39:38,237 --> 01:39:44,410
<i>Only you can change your world tomorrow</i>

1425
01:39:45,010 --> 01:39:51,483
<i>Let your smile light up the sky</i>

1426
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:58,657
<i>Keep your spirit soaring high</i>

1427
01:40:01,127 --> 01:40:03,434
<i>Trust in your heart</i>

1428
01:40:03,534 --> 01:40:08,033
<i>And your sun shines forever and ever</i>

1429
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:11,136
<i>Hold fast to kindness</i>

1430
01:40:11,236 --> 01:40:14,940
<i>Your light shines forever and ever</i>

1431
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:21,113
<i>I believe in you and in me</i>

1432
01:40:21,847 --> 01:40:27,253
<i>We are strong</i>

1433
01:40:30,122 --> 01:40:33,792
<i>When once upon a time</i>

1434
01:40:33,892 --> 01:40:37,196
<i>In stories and in rhyme</i>

1435
01:40:37,296 --> 01:40:40,065
<i>A moment you can shine</i>

1436
01:40:40,165 --> 01:40:44,370
<i>And wear your own crown</i>

1437
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:51,076
<i>Be the one that rescues you</i>

1438
01:40:51,176 --> 01:40:57,316
<i>Through the clouds you'll see the blue</i>

1439
01:40:59,885 --> 01:41:02,200
<i>Trust in your heart</i>

1440
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:06,658
