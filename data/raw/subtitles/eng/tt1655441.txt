1
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:05,204
On December 31st, 2014,

2
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:08,030
a taxi cab travel through San Francisco.

3
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:12,659
From Chinatown to Marin.

4
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:17,115
The car carried a single passenger.

5
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:19,417
A woman.

6
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:22,020
Her birth name:

7
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,022
Adaline Bowman.

8
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:29,266
Current alias Jennifer Larson.

9
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:32,794
This is the first... and last

10
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,220
chapter of her story.

11
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:49,257
Hum, sorry, you just got to be... quiet.

12
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:52,084
My dad... he's still sleeping.
He works nights.

13
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:53,810
Come on in.

14
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:04,860
I finished the color samps
and the digital printing last night.

15
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,387
I pulled some line art from the internet

16
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,214
and printed the imperfections

17
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:12,940
See that's... kinda my secret.

18
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:15,066
The dust marks and discoloration...

19
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,192
No one's gonna question a detail
in a million years.

20
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:21,119
So, why 29? I mean...

21
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:23,358
If I were you, I'd shave
a couple of years off.

22
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,772
You could definitely
get away with it.

23
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,984
You're very kind, Tony

24
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,127
Nice work.

25
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:36,198
It's a pleasure to be doing business with you.
And if any of your friends...

26
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:38,047
- Why are you doing this?
- Come again?

27
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:40,574
You're a smart kid.
Forgery is a felony.

28
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:43,100
$250 fine. Six years in jail.

29
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:46,227
Shiit...
You-You're a cop?

30
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,123
No, I'm about as far from
law enforcement as you can get.

31
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,506
I just hate to see wasted potential, Jeff.

32
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,032
Tony... It's Tony.

33
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:57,758
The autograph baseballs
in your bedroom.

34
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:00,384
Made out to Jeff.
Don't get sloppy.

35
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,111
It's the little things
that trip you up.

36
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:30,141
Honey, I'm home.

37
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:39,289
Reese?

38
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,034
Hi.

39
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:01,570
There we go.

40
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:04,533
You're gonna love
the new farm house.

41
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:06,175
Clean air.

42
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:08,940
Acres and acres of woods
and mountain stream.

43
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:11,379
You'll feel like a puppy again.

44
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,871
Did you know that your
great great grandmother...

45
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:16,976
was born just a few towns over?

46
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:19,399
So was mine. Not at the same time, of course.

47
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,927
Oh...
I  gotta go to work.

48
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:28,496
Civic archives, please.

49
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,582
It might take a while,
Market is jammed.

50
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,386
OK then please take California to Hyde.

51
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,480
There's construction on Hyde.

52
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,390
Why don't you stay on this.
Take this to Gough.

53
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:38,077
Gough to Bush, Bush to Polk,
Polk to Grove and then...

54
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,127
just leave me
on the corner of Market

55
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,569
You want my job?

56
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:44,210
You never know.

57
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,270
- Morning, Jenny.
- Morning.
- Morning.

58
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:08,053
- Hi Ken.
- We thought you might not be coming in today.

59
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:09,795
Being New Year's eve and all.

60
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:11,536
Well, it's still a wednesday.

61
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:14,679
The fun doesn't start
till tonight anyway.

62
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,222
Well, are you up for
a little excitement right now?

63
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:19,716
- Sure, what is it?
- Your favourite...

64
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:21,746
The newsreel archives.
It's finally being digitized.

65
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:24,632
We need a little help
getting it ready to be shifted.

66
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:26,991
I'd love to.

"A TRIP DOWN MARKET STREET
SAN FRANCISCO CA 1906"

70
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:50,129
Adaline Marie Bowman was born

71
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,295
at 12:01 AM January 1st 1908

72
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,434
at Children's Hospital, San Francisco.

73
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:03,382
The only child of Fay and Milton Bowman.

74
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:12,338
On June 16th 1929,

75
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,343
just as Adaline Bowman and her mother

76
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,642
stopped to admire the expense
with three years, hence

77
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:21,140
construction would be finish
on the Golden Gate Bridge,

78
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,183
A young engineer displayed
uncommon gallantry.

79
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:37,434
87 days later,

80
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,440
Adaline married Clarence James Prescott

81
00:07:41,342 --> 00:07:44,149
at Old St. Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco.

82
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,186
Three years later,

83
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:52,707
Adaline gave birth to a baby girl.

84
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:57,433
They named her Flemming,
after Adaline's paternal grandmother.

85
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:02,598
On February 17th 1937,

86
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,571
Eight workers and two engineers
lost their lives

87
00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:07,916
when a section of scaffolding
felt through a safety net,

88
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:10,402
during construction of the Golden Gate Bridge.

89
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:13,440
Among the deceased

90
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,421
was Adaline's husband.

91
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:25,475
Ten months after her husband's death

92
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:30,203
Adaline was driving north
to her parents beach cottage,

93
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:34,008
where 5 year old Flemming
was waiting up for her,

94
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,331
when something
highly unusual occurred.

95
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:42,575
Something... almost magical.

96
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:51,023
Snow fell in Sonoma County California.

97
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:28,799
The emerge in the frigid water

98
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:30,890
caused  Adaline's body

99
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:34,240
to go to an anoxic reflex,

100
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,827
instantly stopping her breathing

101
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:39,865
and slowing her heartbeat.

102
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:43,561
Within two minutes

103
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:45,532
Adaline Bowman's core temperature

104
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,975
had dropped to 87 Fº [30º C] degrees.

105
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:54,603
Her heart stopped beating.

106
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:01,650
At 8:25,

107
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:05,549
a bolt of lightning
struck the vehicle

108
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:09,518
discharging half a billion volts of electricity

109
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,321
and producing 60 000 amperes of current.

110
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:15,423
It's effect was three-fault.

111
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:20,928
First: the charge defribillated
Adaline Bowman's heart.

112
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:25,432
Second:

113
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,018
She was jilted of her anoxic state

114
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:32,338
causing her to draw
her first breath in two minutes.

115
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:48,454
Third:

116
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:52,417
Based on Bon Layman's principle of electron compression

117
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,021
and dioxide nucleic acid,

118
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,740
which will be discovered in the year 2035,

119
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:00,305
Adaline Bowman were, henceforth,

120
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:02,683
to be immune to the ravages of time.

121
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:06,372
She will never age another day.

122
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:36,299
As the years passed,

123
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:40,514
Adaline credited her unchanging
appearance to a combination of a healthy diet,

124
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,407
exercise, heredity and good luck.

125
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,408
Adaline?

126
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,198
Miriam, hello.

127
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:50,703
Oh, my God!
You haven't changed a bit.

128
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,458
Oh, that's very kind of you to say...

129
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:54,517
Flemming? You're all grown up...

130
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:56,858
That's what I keep telling my mom,
but she doesn't believe me.

131
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:59,638
I'm sorry, we really must leave.

132
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:01,023
But you-you look like sisters.

133
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:02,925
You better stop or it'll go
straight to my head.

134
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:04,217
How is that possible?

135
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,428
A new face-cream from... Paris!

136
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,982
Made from the royal jelly
of the queen... oui?

137
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,992
OK, darling...
Bye bye now. Great seeing you.

138
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,841
Action was required just weeks later, when,

139
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:23,363
living a quiet suburban existence,

140
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:26,747
Adaline was pulled over
for a minor traffic infraction.

141
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,852
Ma'am, it says here
you were born on January 1st 1908.

142
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:38,329
- That's right
- That would make you... 45 years old?

143
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,760
Yes.

144
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,364
Ma'am, I'm gonna hold on to this.
You come by the station house to pick it up.

145
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,767
Please bring your birth certificate.

146
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,968
I'd be happy to, officer.
Is tomorrow morning alright?

147
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,171
Sure.

148
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,777
Soon after, Adaline
moved back to San Francisco

149
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,631
and took a clerical job
at the School of Medicine.

150
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:11,089
There, she avail herself
of every opportunity

151
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,518
to research her condition.

152
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:21,459
After a year of intense study,

153
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,025
Adaline Bowman was forced
to confront the fact

154
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:29,606
that there was absolutely
no scientific explanation for her condition.

155
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:32,409
"Are you a member
of the communist party?

156
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,212
Or have you ever been
a member of the communist party?"

157
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:48,124
Adaline?

158
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:52,027
Oh, I'm sorry.
You have the wrong person.

159
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:54,730
We're from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, Miss Bowman.

160
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:58,934
We'd like to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

161
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,637
Why? I've done nothing wrong.

162
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:05,751
I'm a good American. How dare you
bother me at my place of employment.

163
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:08,843
Couldn't be helped, ma'am.
We have no record of your residence.

164
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:10,367
This way, please.

165
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:21,655
Nothing to worry about, Miss Bowman.
We're just going to run a few tests on you.

166
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,123
If anyone contacts you, tell them
that I... went to Europe on vacation.

167
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:35,425
That I never came back.

168
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:39,429
The next time we see each other,
I'll have a new identity.

169
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,331
I'll always be your mother.

170
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:44,100
You'll just have
to introduce me as your friend.

171
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:45,934
Momma, no...

172
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:48,938
It has to be this way.

173
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:51,040
Here.

174
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,653
To insure the freedom and safety
of herself and her daughter,

175
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:07,555
Adaline vow to keep moving.

176
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,782
Changing her name, residence
and appearance every decade

177
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:20,167
and never to speak
a word of her fate

178
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,393
to another living soul.

179
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,082
In seven weeks when
Jennifer Larson disappears forever

180
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:41,987
and Susan Fleischer takes up residence
in a remote farm house in Ashton, Oregon,

181
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:46,392
Adaline Bowman,

182
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:52,473
aside one moment of weakness,
will have kept her vow for the past 60 years.

183
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,713
- Hello, Regan.
- "Amanda, you're not gonna stand up on me are you?"

184
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:11,616
You asked me that last year.
Why don't you trust me?

185
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:13,745
Oh, I just can't believe
you haven't got a better offer.

186
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:16,219
"Impossible."
I'll pick you up at 8?"

187
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,823
Actually, that's the other reason I called.

188
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:22,329
The Grand Hotel of Nob Hill
is sending a car for me.

189
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:24,827
- Look at you!
- "Have you ever been there for New Year's?"

190
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:27,231
Only once.
Ages ago.

191
00:17:27,632 --> 00:17:29,087
I guess it's pretty  lavish.

192
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,535
Well, I'd better get to it.
I'll see you soon.

193
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,259
"Bye Regan."

194
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:56,558
Are you hungry?

195
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,361
No?

196
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,764
Oh, you just want to come out
with me tonight, don't you?

197
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,326
Sorry, but it's a girls night.

198
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:42,919
- If you don't remove your hands from my knees....!
- Both my hands are on the table, Adaline.
- Allyson!

199
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:28,145
- Happy New Year.
- Oh, hey, Amanda!

200
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:31,047
- That was you clapping, wasn't it?
- How did you guess?

201
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:33,850
- Who can matters?
- Oh, we're the last two.

202
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,453
Ah, take, grab glass.

203
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:40,757
- Tell me, what did I miss?
- Ah, not much, just some happy chatter.

204
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:46,062
No matter how old you get, New Year's eve
still feels like the one night where anything's possible.

205
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:48,864
- What's your resolution?
- Same as always.

206
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:51,258
True love. What about you?

207
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:54,470
To live this year
as though it were my last.

208
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:56,839
Ah, you never know...
It could be, at our age...

209
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,975
So hell, ya!
Let's live.

210
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:07,382
- Beware, bachelor at 3 o'clock getting a starve up.
- Hmm! What's he like?

211
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:09,884
Brown hair, icy blue, smithereens...

212
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:12,906
Coming in with you.
You always come hit on by babies.

213
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:13,645
Sschh... He's here.

214
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:15,690
- Good evening, ladies.
- Welcome to the cuckoo tend.

215
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,592
I know, we don't look a day over 28.
You're too kind.

216
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:20,995
- What's your name?
- Dale Davenport.

217
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:22,943
- Dale's a painter.
- Really?
- Yeah

218
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:26,341
A starving artist, though,
because he doesn't accept his family's help.

219
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,562
- I-I'm sorry...  Have we met?
- No, no, no.

220
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:32,205
Just your Cartier wrist watch.
One of the very first.

221
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:35,508
I'm assuming it was given to you
by a well to do grandfather.

222
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,511
A... A great grandfather.
But how did you know that I paint?

223
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:40,913
- Your hands are covered with paint.
- Ah!...

224
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:42,815
That one was easy.

225
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:46,619
Well, have a sit.
We're gonna buy you a drink.

226
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,000
Ah... Sure.

227
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:51,323
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!
- Thank you.

228
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:06,261
"Oh, I've got to do
the countdown now."

229
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:30,588
6...5...4...

230
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,974
3...2...1...

231
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:36,543
HAAPPY NEW YEEAAR!

232
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:43,052
Hello.
Thank you, sweetheart.

233
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,278
No, no. You don't have to sing.
No, please, please, don't sing.

234
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,061
I already had
enough birthdays.

235
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:54,854
Oh, where are you?

236
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:57,586
You didn't go out at all?

237
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:00,676
Well, I don't blame you.

238
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:04,092
Are we still on for tomorrow?
Great.

239
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:06,594
Alright, get some sleep.
I love you.

240
00:22:07,596 --> 00:22:09,212
Goodnight.

241
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,209
Whoever he is, I hope he's got
one hell of an excuse.

242
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,411
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scary you.

243
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:27,081
It's just... isn't there
some sort of tradition

244
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:30,418
if you're alone on New Year's eve
that you're supposed to kiss a stranger?

245
00:22:32,078 --> 00:22:33,780
Damn it. You've heard it before.

246
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,422
Just once from a young Bing Crosby...

247
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,926
...type.

248
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,027
Happy New Year.

249
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,037
- I am too old for this.
- Oh, no don't. Don't disappear.

250
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,139
I'll call you tomorrow and make you
tell me everything I missed.

251
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,188
- I love you.
- Bye, dear.

252
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,150
- Argh!
- Oh.

253
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,456
Oh, well... That'll teach me not
to put my hand where it doesn't belong.

254
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,858
Something tells me it won't.

255
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:19,163
You know...
That was a risky move.

256
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:23,066
- What was?
- Not introducing yourself before you leave.

257
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:25,969
I am a dare devil.

258
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,599
I'm Ellis.
Pleasure to meet you.

259
00:23:29,472 --> 00:23:31,474
- Like the Island?
- No man is.

260
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,878
- I'm Jenny.
- Like the poem?

261
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,481
No?.. Hum...

262
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:41,138
"Sam weary Sam, sad said
the health of other miss me..."

263
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,951
Sam growing old but had...

264
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:46,474
Jenny kissed me.

265
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:54,196
- Who wrote that?
- Oh... one of the romantics, I think.

266
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:55,604
Ah, you're not sure...

267
00:23:55,797 --> 00:24:00,101
Actually, I am... But I don't want
to come across like I know it all.

268
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,903
Too bad...
I adore "know-it-alls".

269
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:09,911
So... where are you off to?

270
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:13,049
Someplace with better food.
My appartment.

271
00:24:14,515 --> 00:24:16,517
Yourself?

272
00:24:16,717 --> 00:24:20,320
Back to the party.
I just wanted to spend 27 floors with you.

273
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:24,024
- That was a risky move.
- What?

274
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:27,427
Leaving your date upstairs.
I hope it was worth it.

275
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:29,229
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on...

276
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,022
A beautiful woman in blue.

277
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:33,533
Does her name happen to end in "Kova"?

278
00:24:35,395 --> 00:24:38,698
No. Her name is Agnes Bogz.

279
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:42,104
Her uncle's the chef.
I let her know you liked his food.

280
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:44,643
And she's not my date.

281
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,951
- Taxi, ma'am?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

282
00:24:58,757 --> 00:25:00,759
- Goodnight.
- Oh...

283
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,832
I'll just wait with you.

284
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,076
So you can find out where I live?

285
00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:08,666
It does make it a lot easier
to send flowers.

286
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:12,870
OK.
Thank you, but I'll manage.

287
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:18,175
Goodbye.
It's been fun meeting you.

288
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:22,980
Thank you.

289
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:26,703
- Wait!
- Oh.

290
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,887
There you go again, putting your hand
in places it doesn't belong.

291
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:34,090
How do we get in touch?

292
00:25:34,892 --> 00:25:38,273
Happy New Year, Ellis.
Thank you so much.

293
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:04,419
- Am I late?
- No more than usual.

294
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,423
- Happy birthday, mamma.
- Thank you, darling.

295
00:26:12,226 --> 00:26:14,028
I'm so happy to see you.

296
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:19,633
You know you don't have
to still get me cards.

297
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:25,038
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

298
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:29,262
- So when are you moving back up?
- Third week in February.

299
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:32,472
- Right on schedule
- Of course

300
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:40,453
I see you already forgot
our little talk about sodium.

301
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:43,118
No, I'm simply choosing to ignore it.

302
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,661
Actually, hum...

303
00:26:50,964 --> 00:26:53,504
I'm thinking of moving myself.

304
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:56,968
- But you love where you live.
- I do.

305
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,086
But you know...
there's just too many stairs.

306
00:27:00,672 --> 00:27:05,176
Last week Cae Alfonso
fell and she broke her hip.

307
00:27:06,277 --> 00:27:08,279
The doctor said she might
never leave the hospital.

308
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:13,884
And then, very next day
Molly Andrews called me

309
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,888
and she told me about this
wonderful retirement community and...

310
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,993
She moved in last spring.
She said she'd never been happier her whole life.

311
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,399
What's the matter?

312
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,803
I only bought it in Oregon
so I could be close to you.

313
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:36,729
So you could come up for long visits.

314
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:38,855
Move in with me, eventually.

315
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,113
We haven't lived together
since I was in high-school

316
00:27:44,214 --> 00:27:46,890
Yeah but... you're not
getting any younger.

317
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,118
What if you moved to Arizona
and something happened to you?

318
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,947
What if you got sick?

319
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:55,924
Then I would hope that
you'd come and take care of me.

320
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:01,830
What if I'm too late?

321
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,787
No, no. We cannot do this.

322
00:28:05,189 --> 00:28:07,400
Not on your birthday.
It's a holiday.

323
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:18,445
- I nearly fell off from my seat.
- What are you two clerking about

324
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:19,253
Major news.

325
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:24,072
Mr. Jones is donating 50.000$ worth
of first edition classics to this library.

326
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:25,577
What books, do you know?

327
00:28:25,778 --> 00:28:29,665
We're gonna find out  real soon
because his office called to say

328
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,410
that he'll be here
to deliver them himself.

329
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:36,780
- Hi, I'm Ellis  (-"Oh, no!")
- Oh, good. Welcome... Mr. Jones
- Thank you.

330
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:40,787
In behalf of the Saint Francisco
Parentage Society,

331
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:43,292
I'd like to express our sincere gratitude

332
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:45,480
for your most generous gift.

333
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:47,654
I left them in shipping and receiving
but i'm sure they'll be right up.

334
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:51,101
If you don't mind, we'd like to take
a photograph with you donating.

335
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:53,291
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

336
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:55,617
Can you give me
one second, though?

337
00:28:58,597 --> 00:29:02,075
Hey. It's me.
The "know-it-all".

338
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:04,330
What are you doing here?

339
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:06,936
I got something for you, too.

340
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,446
Some flowers.

341
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,866
Daisy Miller by Henry James.

342
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:16,001
Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury.

343
00:29:16,702 --> 00:29:18,867
White Oleander, Janet Fitch.

344
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:22,893
Very clever.

345
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:29,112
- How did you know I work here?
- I just tried at the board.

346
00:29:31,724 --> 00:29:33,528
Oh... You could have
mention that in the elevator.

347
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:41,338
If we'd met in a taller building,
I'd have time to cover that.

348
00:29:46,128 --> 00:29:49,631
I don't know about you but...
I'm ready for some donating.

349
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:53,678
- Great. I'll be here.
- No way.

350
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:56,443
I'd like you to accept the books
in behalf of the library.

351
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,869
- Oh, no, no, no. I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

352
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,384
- No, No. I don't want my photo taken.
- Don't worry, you look stunning.

353
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:05,976
It's not about vanity. I just don't like
people taking my photograph.

354
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,353
Suit yourself. If you don't accept them,
I won't donate them.

355
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:15,855
- You wouldn't do that.
- I will. I'll even have a book burning!

356
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,143
I just don't like
have my photo taken, Ellis.

357
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:27,101
OK, fine, fine.
Here's an alternative:

358
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:29,811
Let me take you out tomorrow.

359
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,333
OK, that's impossible.

360
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:44,906
Alright. Well,  I'll just pack up
the books then... It's fine. Ya.

361
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:49,027
Where?

362
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,793
Someplace you've never been.

363
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:58,127
Well, if it's in this city,
that's... unlikely.

364
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:00,767
Try me.

365
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:05,002
You can leave your boots
at the front when you're done.

366
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:06,463
- I'll be right outside.
- We will.

367
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,258
Thank you, Tom.

368
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:15,329
Alright. I give up.

369
00:31:17,814 --> 00:31:22,319
In the first year of the gold rush,
about 60.000 people came to San Francisco by ship.

370
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:26,947
And a lot of them high tailed it straight
into the hills, leaving their boats behind.

371
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:30,329
Hundreds of boats were left on shore.

372
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:34,657
Downtown San Francisco
was built right on top of it.

373
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:35,983
Oh, I didn't know that.

374
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:39,410
Now... City services
found this

375
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:42,036
when they were digging
for utility line.

376
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:45,063
Oh, my God...

377
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:46,589
Isn't it something?

378
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:50,817
- Is that...?
- Yeah! That's a boat.

379
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:53,543
Oh, wow!

380
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:56,270
This is incredible.

381
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:58,896
So, we had to digging stopped
immediately, of course.

382
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:01,523
We want this made
available to the public.

383
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:02,548
We?

384
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:05,473
San Francisco Historical
Preservation Society

385
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:07,499
Oh... Let me guess.
You're on the board.

386
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:10,827
Yeah, well... They let anyone
on the board these days.

387
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:22,161
So, how did you come
by your fortune, anyway? Inheritance?

388
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:24,487
Luck.

389
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:28,415
I was a math major in college,
and, in my spare time,

390
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:32,043
I developed an algorithm
for analyzing climate data.

391
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:36,371
But my roommate figured out that it could
also be used for economic forecasts.

392
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:39,197
Se he started a company in our dorm room.

393
00:32:39,922 --> 00:32:43,625
Sold it three years later and then
with his half he retired to Fiji.

394
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,652
And with my half I'm...
I'm doing this.

395
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:49,079
Your job is
scaring away money.

396
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:52,806
Yes, that's right. But if you wanna
make a real difference in this world it's a...

397
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,832
It's a lot harder
than it seems.

398
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,061
What about you, Jenny?

399
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:09,094
I... own a dog...

400
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:11,420
OK.

401
00:33:12,044 --> 00:33:13,546
I should be getting back.

402
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,371
But we're having lunch.

403
00:33:16,597 --> 00:33:18,298
It's too late, Ellis.

404
00:33:18,322 --> 00:33:20,324
I only got an hour.

405
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:23,613
OK.

406
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:26,540
Let me at least walk you back.

407
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,870
Thank you for all of this.

408
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,096
Just... You should know I'm moving.

409
00:33:40,425 --> 00:33:42,427
OK.
I have an idea.

410
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:45,053
I'll tell you a joke.

411
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:49,281
If you laugh you have to go out
with me one more time before you move away.

412
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:51,307
I mean, if you don't laugh...

413
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:53,433
I'll know we're incompatible
and I gladly give up.

414
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:55,459
That must be one hell of a joke.

415
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,584
It's the funniest
in human history.

416
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:59,810
But, it's subtle,
sophisticated.

417
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:01,936
So you probably
won't even get it.

418
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:03,762
Yeah, probably not.

419
00:34:04,387 --> 00:34:06,989
- You like baseball?
- Yeah. I love it..

420
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:09,270
Good. So...

421
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:11,296
One day at Fenway Park...

422
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:14,623
Ted Williams...
You know who he was?

423
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:18,851
Oh, come on... The Thumper?
Career batting average of 3.44, right?

424
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,202
What!?..
Yeah... that Ted Williams.

425
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,628
Anyway, so...
He's hanging around Fenway...

426
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:25,554
And this horse
walks up and says:

427
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:27,179
- "I wanna play for the Sox"
- Who, an actual horse?

428
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:29,806
An actual horse.
So Ted's like...

429
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,832
"OK, what can you do?"
And the horse says:

430
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:33,858
"I can hit just like you,
only a whole lot better."

431
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:36,484
So, he picks up a bat
with his teeth,

432
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,110
and Ted's like "OK"
and he throws him a few.

433
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:42,638
And sure enough...
Gooon, gooon...

434
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:45,064
Into the bleachers.

435
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,590
So Ted's like "wow!".

436
00:34:48,015 --> 00:34:49,516
"What else can you do?"
And the horse says

437
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,442
"Well, I can play shortstop."

438
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:53,368
So Ted hits him a few ground balls.

439
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,994
- And sure enough he's..
- He's a vacuum cleaner.

440
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:00,723
So, Ted's like...
"Wow, can you pitch?"

441
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:02,749
And the horse just
looks at him and says:

442
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:05,876
"Pitch? Whoever heard
of a horse pitching?"

443
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:14,238
Ya!

444
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:16,864
Yes! Ladies and gentlemen.

445
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:19,991
The lady has been conquered.

446
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:24,319
That's the worst joke
I've ever heard in my entire life

447
00:35:24,744 --> 00:35:26,745
- Thank you.
- It wasn't a compliment.

448
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,972
Dinner? Tuesday?
My place. 303 Eighteen Street.

449
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:32,699
8 o'clock.

450
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:36,138
Fine

451
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:49,611
- Good Morning, Ms. Larson.
Good to see you again.
- Good Morning.

452
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:51,437
So, what can we do for you today?

453
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:53,663
I'd like to add another
signee to my account.

454
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:57,190
- May I ask the reason?
- I'll be traveling for a while.

455
00:35:58,515 --> 00:36:00,517
Traveling...
OK.

456
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,244
I'll get the paper work
I'll be right back

457
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:19,900
All of this companies
rate very highly with us.

458
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:22,226
What's this?
The Haloid Photographic Company.

459
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,052
They've been around 50 years.
They make photo paper and equipment.

460
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:28,280
They're developing something
called Electrophotography.

461
00:36:28,304 --> 00:36:31,807
It can revolutionize the business,
but you won't see any immediate returns.

462
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:34,033
- It could be a few years away.
- That's alright.

463
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,960
I'd hate to see you
tie up your money.

464
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:39,186
I'm patient.

465
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,412
What do you know...
They’ve changed their name.

466
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:43,238
They're now called...

467
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:46,965
What the heck...
It starts with an "x".

468
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:50,593
It's Greek.
It's pronounced "Xerox"

469
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:53,419
Xerox...

470
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:57,147
So... We can start
with the signature card.

471
00:36:59,073 --> 00:37:01,675
- What is the name of the co-signer?
- Susan Fleischer.

472
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:03,000
Susan Fle...

473
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:05,026
F-l-e

474
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,052
"I" as...

475
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:11,480
Now, I've made you some salmon.

476
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:16,209
This no-eating non-sense
just won't do if you gonna be a proper farm dog.

477
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:20,737
I want you to eat every last bite.
Do understand me?

478
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:25,502
Oh... There we go.

479
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,887
Hello?

480
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:55,430
Ellis?

481
00:37:59,858 --> 00:38:01,860
- Am I interrupting?
- Hey!

482
00:38:03,886 --> 00:38:06,989
- I was afraid you got cold feet.
- No, no. Just trouble getting a cab.

483
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:10,016
- Hi
- Hi

484
00:38:12,966 --> 00:38:15,669
- Can I take you coat?
- OK.

485
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,400
- You’re place it's a...
- ...unfinished?

486
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:28,129
Yes, hum... I notice that part
as that of an artistic choice.

487
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:33,257
No. I have to paint and plaster
and do all the wiring stuff.

488
00:38:33,482 --> 00:38:35,484
But I'm doing it all myself, so...

489
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,910
It's gonna take a little while.

490
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:40,136
I think your food is... burning.

491
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:47,219
Make yourself comfortable.

492
00:38:47,843 --> 00:38:49,845
Sit down, relax.

493
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,671
OK.

494
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,869
What is it?
That you're cooking.

495
00:38:58,393 --> 00:39:02,497
Well... It's a delicacy
that to be honest is not for everyone

496
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:06,225
So...
I hope you like it.

497
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:10,753
- Are you ready?
- Would you like a drum-mo?

498
00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:14,380
Voilá!

499
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:17,407
It was between this
and stuffed quail.

500
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:19,934
Please don't tell me
you're disappointed.

501
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,760
- I-I'm truly overjoyed.
- Yes!

502
00:39:24,085 --> 00:39:26,087
- Dig in.
- OK

503
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:31,416
Well?

504
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,543
It's perfect, just the music is painful.

505
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:38,471
- You don't like jazz?
- No, I love jazz. This is something else.

506
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:45,702
My mom grew up in Maine.
She's a really new englander

507
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:48,529
Sweet but tough as nails.

508
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:52,311
My dad, on the other hand.

509
00:39:53,636 --> 00:39:55,938
Has his head at the stars.
Literally.

510
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:59,966
He's an astronomer.
Just retired form Stanford.

511
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:03,894
His claim to fame is that
he discovered an unusual comet.

512
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,220
Unusual in what way?

513
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:09,147
Well, It has a mathematical
proven perigee.

514
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:13,375
So, based on his calculations,
it would pass by Earth in the winter 1981.

515
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,802
- Did it?
- No

516
00:40:17,427 --> 00:40:19,429
God! It did not!

517
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:23,256
But that didn't stop us
from looking for it every year.

518
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:26,784
It was a kind of a ritual
we had when I was growing up.

519
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:30,111
My dad is still looking.

520
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:36,532
One more glass of wine
and I may see it.

521
00:40:38,558 --> 00:40:40,560
Oh, no, no. Thank you.
Please.

522
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:43,586
Ah, come on. You know
they have a saying in Italy...

523
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:47,114
"Anni, amori e bicchieri di vino,
nun si contano mai."

524
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:50,241
Years... lovers...

525
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,667
wine cups?

526
00:40:53,392 --> 00:40:55,394
Years, lovers and glasses of wine,

527
00:40:56,218 --> 00:40:58,621
these are things that
should never be counted.

528
00:41:00,947 --> 00:41:02,949
You have no idea.

529
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:09,679
I like your view.

530
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:13,307
Thank you.

531
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:16,920
I like the way you read.

532
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:20,247
What?

533
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:22,473
The first time I saw you
coming out of the board meeting,

534
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:25,000
you were reading.

535
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:29,628
Your hair was pulled back
and you were wearing a blue dress.

536
00:41:30,553 --> 00:41:33,756
It was a book in braille.
I slow down and watched.

537
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,782
How long did you watch for?

538
00:41:36,006 --> 00:41:38,008
Long enough to realize
you weren't blind.

539
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,035
And then I had to meet you.

540
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,762
I didn't know when or how,
but I... I knew I would.

541
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,099
I think I...

542
00:41:58,723 --> 00:42:00,725
I think I remember that day.

543
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:05,454
Yes-ah... It was a book in norwegian and...

544
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:10,082
because of all the umlauts over the vowels
it made it nearly impossible to comprehend.

545
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:12,909
- You're kidding.
- Yes.

546
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:16,236
- Oh, you were kidding?
- Yes, of course I am.

547
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:18,962
It was braille for beginners.

548
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:21,189
Nursery rhymes or something.

549
00:42:28,247 --> 00:42:30,549
You can tell me everything you want.
Now, believe it.

550
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:33,376
I know almost nothing about you.

551
00:42:35,734 --> 00:42:37,536
It's better this way.

552
00:42:41,063 --> 00:42:43,265
No. It's not.

553
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:08,065
Tell me something I can hold on to
forever and never let go.

554
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:16,333
Let go?

555
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:06,180
Hi.

556
00:44:08,206 --> 00:44:09,707
Good morning.

557
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:17,338
OK. Move your arm.
Some of us work for a living.

558
00:44:20,365 --> 00:44:22,867
OK, I get it.
You're holding me hostage.

559
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,322
Will you ever come back?

560
00:44:37,769 --> 00:44:41,673
Are you sure there's no one there
who speaks English? I mean, Spanish?

561
00:44:41,697 --> 00:44:43,699
No, no, no. We want it all.

562
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,426
- Eu quero-te comprar...
- I have to go.

563
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,752
Hold on. Hold on.
Um momento, por favor.

564
00:44:48,776 --> 00:44:52,079
Just give me a second, will you?
I'm trying to deal with this in portuguese.

565
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:54,005
I can't.

566
00:44:56,231 --> 00:45:01,236
- What are you trying to say?
- The reinforce trust-funds to buy ten thousand acres.

567
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,262
Hum! Well, you're not even close.

568
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:05,287
- Here.
- Thank you.

569
00:45:05,812 --> 00:45:12,218
Gostaríamos de comprar cinco mil acres.
Está bom? Óptimo. O cheque está no correio.

570
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,844
Muito obrigada, senhor.

571
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,172
- I'm late for work.
- Wait. That's it?

572
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:20,998
Let go.

573
00:45:55,863 --> 00:45:57,865
It's a dollar fifty, ma'am.

574
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,499
Ma'am?

575
00:46:08,823 --> 00:46:11,026
Keep driving please.

576
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,452
You got it.

577
00:47:08,027 --> 00:47:10,530
Reese?
Reese?

578
00:47:19,222 --> 00:47:21,024
Baby. You OK?

579
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,552
You OK, baby?

580
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,780
His urean creatinine levels
are way too high,

581
00:47:30,304 --> 00:47:32,306
which means his kidneys are failing

582
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:36,034
and toxins are building up
and his body can't handle it.

583
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:38,360
Is he in pain?

584
00:47:39,685 --> 00:47:41,487
It's difficult to say.

585
00:47:42,512 --> 00:47:44,514
If you were me
what would you do?

586
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,245
I'd be thinking about...

587
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,572
what a wonderful life
he's had.

588
00:47:57,298 --> 00:47:59,300
How lucky you are
to have found each other.

589
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,812
May I have a moment
alone with him, please?

590
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:15,075
Of course.

591
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:55,413
"Hey, Jenny. This is Ellis.
I tried you a couple of times."

592
00:48:55,437 --> 00:48:58,840
"Hope you got my messages
Call me back."

593
00:50:57,428 --> 00:50:59,129
Jenny.

594
00:51:00,555 --> 00:51:03,958
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I tried to call but...

595
00:51:04,182 --> 00:51:06,084
How did you get my address?

596
00:51:06,508 --> 00:51:08,710
Hum... the library.

597
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:14,240
Come on, don't be upset.
I didn't know what else to do.

598
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:21,671
My dog. I had to...

599
00:51:22,095 --> 00:51:26,499
- Had to put him down.
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry to hear that.

600
00:51:26,523 --> 00:51:28,525
You should have waited
for me to contact you.

601
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:30,851
-Jenny, I'm s...
- There's a reason I don't give out my address.

602
00:51:31,476 --> 00:51:33,478
I'm sorry, honestly.

603
00:51:33,502 --> 00:51:35,504
This not going to work.
I'm moving.

604
00:51:36,028 --> 00:51:38,030
You serious?

605
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:44,060
Hi.
For you.

606
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:06,013
Barbara hired land
before she moved to Florida.

607
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:08,739
She got rid of all
of her books.

608
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:12,867
I can no sooner get rid
of this book than I can...

609
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:21,299
It looks like I'm not the only one
getting nostalgic.

610
00:52:22,824 --> 00:52:24,826
You have had such
a wonderful life.

611
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,852
Yeah, I like to think so.

612
00:52:29,178 --> 00:52:34,183
I just which you... You know, that you
could have been there for more of it.

613
00:52:34,908 --> 00:52:36,509
So do I.

614
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:40,637
Remember that?

615
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:43,864
1954, I was a junior in College.

616
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,291
That's the last photo
I have of you.

617
00:52:47,516 --> 00:52:49,518
You've seen one,
you've seen them all.

618
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:52,116
That's true.

619
00:52:58,682 --> 00:53:01,685
What is it?
What's wrong?

620
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,812
I'm just tired of running.

621
00:53:07,038 --> 00:53:09,040
Of lying to good people.

622
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,566
Then stop.

623
00:53:12,491 --> 00:53:14,493
Nobody's chasing you anymore.

624
00:53:15,518 --> 00:53:18,821
Anyone who was ever suspicious
is long dead

625
00:53:19,346 --> 00:53:21,748
You don't have
to be alone forever.

626
00:53:23,173 --> 00:53:25,175
Don't you miss having
someone to love?

627
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,002
It's been such a long time.

628
00:53:28,026 --> 00:53:30,028
It's not the same
when there's no future.

629
00:53:30,452 --> 00:53:32,454
What are you talking about?
You got nothing but future.

630
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:36,182
I mean a future together.
Growing old together.

631
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:40,009
Without that, love is a...

632
00:53:41,335 --> 00:53:42,736
it's just heartbreak.

633
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,162
It's the same for everybody.

634
00:53:46,387 --> 00:53:48,489
How many times
has my heart been broken?

635
00:53:48,513 --> 00:53:49,915
Too many.

636
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:52,141
If I had your looks
and your energy,

637
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:54,167
I'd fall in love tomorrow.

638
00:53:54,191 --> 00:53:55,892
I really would.

639
00:53:56,617 --> 00:53:58,419
I did meet someone.

640
00:53:58,843 --> 00:54:00,845
- What?
- No, I... On New Years eve.

641
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,872
- He jumped on my elevator.
- Why didn't you tell me?

642
00:54:04,196 --> 00:54:06,198
Because I knew
you'd look at me like that.

643
00:54:08,024 --> 00:54:10,026
Don't get too excited. I...

644
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,051
I told him
to leave me alone.

645
00:54:13,477 --> 00:54:16,079
I was horrible.
Cruel.

646
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:19,507
Tell him you're sorry.
Tell him you made a mistake.

647
00:54:20,331 --> 00:54:21,833
I can't.
I'm leaving.

648
00:54:22,457 --> 00:54:25,260
You're moving to Oregon,
not Timbuktu.

649
00:54:27,987 --> 00:54:31,890
Come on. If you won't do it
for yourself, do it for me.

650
00:54:33,115 --> 00:54:34,417
Please.

651
00:54:45,723 --> 00:54:47,725
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

652
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,354
Hum... I'm here to see Ellis Jones.
He's not expecting me.

653
00:54:52,378 --> 00:54:54,580
Oh. Let's see
what we can do about that.

654
00:54:56,005 --> 00:54:58,007
And you are?

655
00:54:58,932 --> 00:55:00,633
Incredibly sorry.

656
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:04,061
Mr. Jones, you got
a guest down here.

657
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,086
I bet you got a name.

658
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:08,413
- Jennifer Larson.
- OK.

659
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:10,739
Please tell him I understand.

660
00:55:11,163 --> 00:55:14,266
If he doesn't want to see me.
I'm just here to say I'm sorry.

661
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:19,095
That my... My life has been
unbelievable.

662
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:22,022
since longer than he can imagine.

663
00:55:22,046 --> 00:55:24,748
And I just... I was
emotional the other day.

664
00:55:27,475 --> 00:55:31,078
Now I realize how incredibly
kind to me he's been and...

665
00:55:31,102 --> 00:55:33,104
I-i just been too
stupid to accept that.

666
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:35,931
I know better now and and..

667
00:55:36,856 --> 00:55:40,359
That's why I wanna tell him
how sincerely sorry I am.

668
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:45,388
- OK.
- And ask if he could come downstairs maybe...

669
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:49,114
Let me making up to him
by taking him out tonight.

670
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,141
Please.

671
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:56,069
Hum... Is a Jennifer Larson...?

672
00:55:56,093 --> 00:55:58,095
Says she understands if you don’t...

673
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,421
Oh, you heard that.

674
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:02,347
OK, good.

675
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:04,373
He wants to know
where you're taking him.

676
00:56:06,398 --> 00:56:08,400
Someplace he's never been before.

677
00:56:34,776 --> 00:56:36,778
- Hello?
- Hey, Jenny.

678
00:56:45,897 --> 00:56:49,200
Alright, you don't actually
think is my first chop-chop date.

679
00:56:49,224 --> 00:56:52,827
Oh, be quiet.
There's more here than meets the eye.

680
00:56:53,752 --> 00:56:57,756
This used to be one of those
popular picture houses in the city.

681
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:01,584
- A movie theater?
- Yes.

682
00:57:02,508 --> 00:57:05,411
In the thirties, a woman named
Mary Elizabeth Woods

683
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:08,638
red about a chemical magnat
who would create a drive-in theater

684
00:57:09,063 --> 00:57:11,064
- Hum hum
- In Camden, New Jersey.

685
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:14,692
And so naturally, she needed
one of her own, here in San Francisco.

686
00:57:15,116 --> 00:57:17,819
Everyone thought she was crazy
as a loon, which she was.

687
00:57:18,043 --> 00:57:20,545
She would sleep with anyone
who wasn't her husband.

688
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:24,073
And she used to put all this airs
like she's better than anyone else.

689
00:57:26,435 --> 00:57:27,836
Anyway...

690
00:57:28,161 --> 00:57:31,464
Because of local ordinances,
she couldn't have an open-air theater.

691
00:57:31,488 --> 00:57:33,490
So she brought all the cars in here,

692
00:57:34,014 --> 00:57:36,016
That's a spring right there.

693
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:40,144
It was spectacular...
I imagine.

694
00:57:43,972 --> 00:57:45,473
Are you ready
for the best part?

695
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:47,899
- Sure
- OK. Look up.

696
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:01,708
She had photoluminescent
filaments installed.

697
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:07,538
They took the time
to create the constellations.

698
00:58:10,064 --> 00:58:11,666
Isn't it beautiful?

699
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:17,363
Yeah.

700
00:58:27,192 --> 00:58:28,894
What are you doing?

701
00:58:29,118 --> 00:58:30,519
Come on.

702
00:58:42,747 --> 00:58:43,948
Cheers.

703
00:58:44,973 --> 00:58:47,576
The great paradox
of all this is that...

704
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,103
The better our engines get
the further we can see.

705
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:55,731
But now I see the future.
It's in the past.

706
00:58:56,156 --> 00:58:58,658
The event's line has not
even reach us yet.

707
00:58:59,182 --> 00:59:02,686
I don't think I'll ever understand
why so few people care about history.

708
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,312
The future has its charms too.

709
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:10,041
When can talk about ours.

710
00:59:12,267 --> 00:59:14,969
- Ellis...
- Not the distant future...

711
00:59:15,994 --> 00:59:19,498
-I'm talking about this weekend.
- What do you have in mind?

712
00:59:20,923 --> 00:59:24,827
My parents are having a party
to celebrate the 40th wedding anniversary.

713
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:27,653
It's just a couple
of hours from here.

714
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,981
Come with me.

715
00:59:46,447 --> 00:59:48,049
OK.

716
00:59:49,574 --> 00:59:51,176
Can I drive?

717
01:00:00,909 --> 01:00:03,912
You know you rarely see a Saab
at the Daytona 500.

718
01:00:05,037 --> 01:00:06,538
There's a reason for that

719
01:00:07,463 --> 01:00:11,066
You might wanna consider an occasional tap
on that square pedal by your foot.

720
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,692
I don't know what
you're talking about.

721
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:14,918
Gaw...wowow!

722
01:00:14,942 --> 01:00:16,944
Oh, my God!

723
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:18,970
Oh, sorry!

724
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,897
What's wrong with you?

725
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:30,769
Do me a favour.
Stop to pick her up.

726
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:33,395
I'd rather not.
It's their house.

727
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,422
- That's my sister.
- Oh!

728
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:41,251
Sorry.

729
01:00:46,544 --> 01:00:48,346
- What's up, pussycat?
- Need a ride?

730
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,572
What does it look like?

731
01:00:53,598 --> 01:00:55,801
- How are you?
- Fine.

732
01:00:58,627 --> 01:01:00,629
- Still driving a Saab, hein?
- Yeah.

733
01:01:00,653 --> 01:01:02,655
- Hello.
- Hey!

734
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:05,882
Kikki, this is Jenny.
Jenny, it's my sister.

735
01:01:06,106 --> 01:01:08,008
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

736
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:10,034
Hey, are you sure Tony
are taking the bus?

737
01:01:10,358 --> 01:01:13,661
- We would pick you up at the station.
- I stopped using telephones 2 months ago.

738
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:17,373
Any particular reason?

739
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:21,401
To protest the involvement
of telecom firms in the development
of high tech weapon systems.

740
01:01:23,727 --> 01:01:25,729
- Kikki graduated for Berkeley.
- Ah...

741
01:01:27,054 --> 01:01:29,056
So this is the new one, ah?

742
01:01:31,382 --> 01:01:33,084
Have you done him yet?

743
01:01:34,609 --> 01:01:36,611
Yes, ten minutes ago
right where you're sitting.

744
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:43,742
So, what's the story with this girl?
She... she works there?

745
01:01:44,366 --> 01:01:46,368
I've told you everything
Ellis told me.

746
01:01:49,595 --> 01:01:52,598
- Thank you.
- Beautiful girl...

747
01:01:54,724 --> 01:01:56,726
working at a public library.

748
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,954
- Maybe she likes books. And silence.
- Or maybe she googled it.

749
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:03,581
And found out about  his
generous contribution and then...

750
01:02:04,806 --> 01:02:07,809
...worked her way in there
so that she could get her hooks into him.

751
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:09,834
Yeap. I bet that's it.

752
01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:12,861
- Shouldn't they be here by now?
- You clean the table.

753
01:02:23,595 --> 01:02:25,898
- They're here.
- Yeah, yeah.

754
01:02:26,522 --> 01:02:28,724
How do I look?

755
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:31,251
Very pretty.

756
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:39,911
- Oh, there you are!
- Hey, mom.

757
01:02:40,936 --> 01:02:43,238
Oh, honey.
Oh, you look great.

758
01:02:43,662 --> 01:02:45,264
Look who we pick
up on the mountains.

759
01:02:45,288 --> 01:02:46,889
Oh, baby!

760
01:02:48,915 --> 01:02:52,118
- So, this is Jenny.
- Hello, so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

761
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:55,145
- You must be exhausted after your trip
- Oh, no. It was nothing.

762
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:59,673
- We made it in, like, 18 minutes.
- Now, I'm not amused.

763
01:02:59,697 --> 01:03:01,699
He knows I hate it
when he speeds.

764
01:03:01,723 --> 01:03:04,126
It wasn't me,
it was Jenny, I swear.

765
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,852
- She thinks she has a high life.
- Let me take your coat.
- Oh, OK.

766
01:03:07,076 --> 01:03:09,579
Where have you been?
Or do you forget where we live?

767
01:03:10,103 --> 01:03:11,505
No.

768
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,831
Hum... It's my dad, William.

769
01:03:14,255 --> 01:03:16,257
Dad, this is...

770
01:03:16,281 --> 01:03:17,883
Adaline.

771
01:03:23,932 --> 01:03:25,934
Hum.. Jenny... actually.

772
01:03:29,962 --> 01:03:31,964
Dad, you OK?

773
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:36,544
I'm sorry. It's just...

774
01:03:36,568 --> 01:03:39,871
You look exactly like
this old friend of mine... hum...

775
01:03:40,896 --> 01:03:42,898
Adaline Bowman.

776
01:03:44,872 --> 01:03:46,874
That's my mother.

777
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,501
You're joking.
You really...?

778
01:03:50,525 --> 01:03:52,527
- Yeah
- Oh, my gosh!
- Did you know her?

779
01:03:56,883 --> 01:03:59,186
Yeah! Yeah, I mean...

780
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,213
We were very close.
I-I-I....

781
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,139
I knew her in London.

782
01:04:05,163 --> 01:04:07,165
Yeah, she-she lived there in-in...

783
01:04:07,189 --> 01:04:10,492
In the sixties.
Right before she...

784
01:04:10,516 --> 01:04:12,919
moved to Paris
and met my father.

785
01:04:13,343 --> 01:04:15,345
- Incredible. What are the odds?
- What a small world.

786
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:19,873
Wow. wow.... The resemblance
is a-absolutely amazing.

787
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,899
You must hear that all the time.

788
01:04:22,223 --> 01:04:24,225
For as long as I can remember.

789
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:26,251
Wow. We were very close.

790
01:04:26,475 --> 01:04:28,177
You said that already.

791
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:30,603
I can't believe you never mentioned her.

792
01:04:30,627 --> 01:04:32,629
- Oh, yeah... I must have...
- No, no.

793
01:04:32,753 --> 01:04:35,256
No, I remember your
close, close friends.

794
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,282
How is she? How's she doing?

795
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:43,211
She passed away.
Six years ago.

796
01:04:43,936 --> 01:04:45,537
No, really?

797
01:04:46,662 --> 01:04:48,664
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

798
01:04:55,279 --> 01:04:56,980
Extraordinary woman.

799
01:04:57,605 --> 01:04:59,907
Well, it runs in the family.

800
01:05:05,909 --> 01:05:09,412
- Come on, hum. Want something to eat or...?
- Ya, ya, I made cheesecake.

801
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:13,840
We're kind of tired, actually, hum...

802
01:05:14,765 --> 01:05:16,767
I think we'll head up,
if that's OK with you.

803
01:05:17,091 --> 01:05:18,392
- Me too.
- Really?

804
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:20,418
Alright, I'll have you
in the back bedroom.

805
01:05:24,446 --> 01:05:26,448
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Yes.

806
01:05:26,772 --> 01:05:28,774
Dad?

807
01:05:29,499 --> 01:05:30,900
Hey baby.

808
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:32,983
Miss?

809
01:06:34,008 --> 01:06:35,509
Miss?

810
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,336
You know you can't do that.
You're gonna flood your engine.

811
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,562
Thank you. Thank you
for the useful tip.

812
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:43,689
Or you gonna be
one hell of a ten, at least.

813
01:06:46,844 --> 01:06:50,347
I'm sorry. I've done everything
I could to get this thing started.

814
01:06:50,671 --> 01:06:52,673
It just... It won't.

815
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:56,301
Alright, all it needs
is a push start. Hum...

816
01:06:56,825 --> 01:06:58,827
Just loose the break,
I'll give you a push.

817
01:06:59,252 --> 01:07:01,253
You pop your clutch
and he'll take off.

818
01:07:03,279 --> 01:07:04,681
OK.

819
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:07,407
Thank you.

820
01:07:09,834 --> 01:07:11,835
- Ready? - Ready.
- You're ready? - OK. - OK.

821
01:07:14,562 --> 01:07:16,564
- And now pop your clutch!
- Oh!

822
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,492
Thank you.

823
01:07:23,518 --> 01:07:25,520
You're welcome.

824
01:07:42,737 --> 01:07:44,939
They would spend the next
five weeks together.

825
01:07:45,363 --> 01:07:49,267
And Adaline did something she had
promised herself she would never do.

826
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,694
You know you...
You still haven't told me your name.

827
01:07:55,008 --> 01:07:56,810
Adaline Bowman.

828
01:07:57,234 --> 01:08:00,037
- But my friends call me Della.
- That's beautiful.

829
01:08:01,362 --> 01:08:02,864
Thank you.

830
01:08:03,488 --> 01:08:05,490
Three weeks later,
his semester completed.

831
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,217
William flew home
to the United States.

832
01:08:10,843 --> 01:08:12,845
Adaline came with him.

833
01:08:57,387 --> 01:08:58,888
Hey there.

834
01:08:59,713 --> 01:09:01,715
- How did you sleep?
- Fine.

835
01:09:02,152 --> 01:09:03,653
Good.

836
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,202
Sorry about last night.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

837
01:09:13,326 --> 01:09:15,328
It's just...

838
01:09:16,954 --> 01:09:18,955
I must be losing it.

839
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:20,481
It's OK.

840
01:09:26,434 --> 01:09:28,937
- When did you come up?
- Not too late.

841
01:09:29,161 --> 01:09:31,163
- Read for a while.
- Hum.

842
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:34,790
Hi, baby.

843
01:09:35,603 --> 01:09:37,605
- Where is Jenny?
- She'll be down in a sec.

844
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:40,232
She was up all night.
Tossing and turning.

845
01:09:40,256 --> 01:09:43,258
Oh. You know you've
never told us how you guys met.

846
01:09:44,812 --> 01:09:47,214
We met in an elevator
on New Year's eve.

847
01:09:48,339 --> 01:09:50,842
- Do you want  some coffee?
- No, thank you.

848
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:53,568
But, I had seen her
once before that.

849
01:09:55,494 --> 01:09:57,696
It was at the library.
She was reading a book in braille.

850
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:00,423
I just... I knew she was
a really gem.

851
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,949
Here you are baby.
So was her mom.

852
01:10:03,674 --> 01:10:05,676
How did you meet her mother?

853
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,302
Hum... It was outside London.

854
01:10:08,326 --> 01:10:11,329
Her car broke down.
I helped her fix it.

855
01:10:12,354 --> 01:10:15,757
- So... she was English.
- No, no. She was just there studying french.

856
01:10:16,782 --> 01:10:18,784
Spoke like what?
Four languages?

857
01:10:18,808 --> 01:10:20,810
- I think so, yeah.
- Wow.

858
01:10:21,206 --> 01:10:23,408
- Jenny's brilliant with
languages too.
- Really?

859
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:26,663
So, how old were you
when you met her?

860
01:10:26,687 --> 01:10:27,989
Oh, I was about...

861
01:10:28,313 --> 01:10:30,315
Let's see... humm.
I was at second year in med school so...

862
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:32,441
So, I was like... 26.

863
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,622
I was thinking about
quitting Medicine. Bored.

864
01:10:39,748 --> 01:10:44,052
But I was.... I was afraid,
I was too old to start over.

865
01:10:46,178 --> 01:10:48,180
I told her...

866
01:10:48,404 --> 01:10:51,407
I told Adaline about it
and she just laughed in my face.

867
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,833
She said: "Go for it".

868
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,759
Don't be silly.

869
01:10:55,883 --> 01:10:57,885
"Life's too short."

870
01:10:58,209 --> 01:11:02,213
If it wasn't for her I probably wouldn't
have found  astronomy and physics

871
01:11:02,938 --> 01:11:06,141
She was only a couple of years older
than I was but she was so wise.

872
01:11:06,365 --> 01:11:08,367
She was so...

873
01:11:08,391 --> 01:11:09,992
sophisticated.

874
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,721
She hum...

875
01:11:33,134 --> 01:11:35,536
- What? Honey?
- That's enough, William.

876
01:11:36,161 --> 01:11:38,964
What? What's-what's going on?

877
01:11:39,288 --> 01:11:41,290
What, you-you think
this is funny?

878
01:11:41,314 --> 01:11:43,316
What do you mean?
What did I do?

879
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:46,042
You were very close.
You were very close.

880
01:11:46,367 --> 01:11:48,368
You said that two twice now.

881
01:11:49,494 --> 01:11:51,696
And you should see your face
when you talk about her.

882
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,722
Are you gonna wax nostalgic
this whole weekend?

883
01:11:54,746 --> 01:11:56,748
Look, it's just that-that...

884
01:11:57,473 --> 01:12:00,476
She looks so much like
her mother that I'm remembering things

885
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,502
that I even didn't
know I remembered.

886
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:05,128
- Well, I hate feeling like second choice.
- What do you mean, secon...

887
01:12:05,152 --> 01:12:07,655
- Specially this weekend.
- Second choice?

888
01:12:07,979 --> 01:12:09,981
- Yes
- Forty years, baby.

889
01:12:10,005 --> 01:12:12,007
Come on...
Second choice?

890
01:12:13,632 --> 01:12:16,135
Honey, you're blowing
this all out of proportion.

891
01:12:16,459 --> 01:12:18,060
Am I?

892
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,886
Are you jealous?

893
01:12:21,912 --> 01:12:23,914
Yeah. As a matter of fact...

894
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:26,641
Look, look.

895
01:12:26,665 --> 01:12:28,666
It was fleeting.

896
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:31,193
Inconsequential.

897
01:12:33,519 --> 01:12:35,521
It sounded like
you were more than that.

898
01:12:38,248 --> 01:12:39,849
I love you.

899
01:12:40,674 --> 01:12:42,375
- I love you too.
- Come on.

900
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:03,980
I'm coming.

901
01:13:05,505 --> 01:13:07,707
It's not the most
romantic weekend.

902
01:13:08,532 --> 01:13:10,334
Thanks for being
such a good sport.

903
01:13:10,358 --> 01:13:13,361
- Of course.
- I promise I'll make it up to you.

904
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,164
Sorry about my dad.
It's really embarrassing.

905
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:32,691
He's lovely.

906
01:13:34,717 --> 01:13:36,719
Hey, your mom must
have really been something.

907
01:13:39,145 --> 01:13:40,747
Yeah, she was.

908
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,883
- Kikki!
- Oh!

909
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:55,012
Ho, guys. Dad is riding
a 47 game winning streak.

910
01:13:56,109 --> 01:13:59,712
All the money I spent
in your education I was
hoping for stronger competition.

911
01:14:00,037 --> 01:14:02,039
- Have you played this before?
- No, never.

912
01:14:02,263 --> 01:14:04,265
Kikki! Come on!

913
01:14:04,289 --> 01:14:06,291
- Trivial?
- YES.

914
01:14:06,815 --> 01:14:08,817
The idea is to get
enough of these little...

915
01:14:09,442 --> 01:14:12,044
- Wedges.
- Pie!
- They're cheese.

916
01:14:12,969 --> 01:14:16,973
They're wedges. You get
enough of them to fill up
your circle and you win, OK?

917
01:14:17,697 --> 01:14:20,300
Most of the questions
are about a stupid stuff.

918
01:14:20,524 --> 01:14:21,725
Hence the word "trivia".

919
01:14:22,049 --> 01:14:24,051
Yeah, like, here's
an example for you...

920
01:14:24,075 --> 01:14:27,178
Hum... On June 22nd 1938
this American boxer

921
01:14:27,703 --> 01:14:32,808
retained his heavy weight
championship when he beat
Max Schmeling in the 1st round

922
01:14:32,832 --> 01:14:34,834
- Well, that it is in top four.
- Ah, yeah.

923
01:14:35,758 --> 01:14:37,360
What do you think?

924
01:14:38,385 --> 01:14:39,786
Hum...

925
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:42,513
- Sonny Liston?
- Joe Louis.

926
01:14:42,537 --> 01:14:44,839
- Good guess, though. Really.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

927
01:14:45,163 --> 01:14:46,765
Women and boxing.

928
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:49,491
Excuse me.
You know what then?

929
01:14:50,817 --> 01:14:53,519
You know what? Finally, ladies.
We're on the team. Here.
- Roll the dice.

930
01:14:53,543 --> 01:14:55,545
- There we go. Alright.
- There we go.

931
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:57,771
Women are pink.

932
01:14:58,396 --> 01:14:59,997
Women are pink?

933
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:08,629
- Who's the first United States
President to be born in a hospital?
- Jimmy Carter

934
01:15:12,457 --> 01:15:14,159
Jimmy Carter

935
01:15:16,205 --> 01:15:19,007
- Beginner's luck
- I don't think so. Try again.

936
01:15:23,035 --> 01:15:25,537
At what event did the Hula-Hoop
make its debut?

937
01:15:27,663 --> 01:15:29,665
In 1956...

938
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:32,992
at the World's Fair
in New York.

939
01:15:36,384 --> 01:15:39,587
1956 World's Fair New York.

940
01:15:39,611 --> 01:15:41,613
Oh, my God!

941
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:43,638
- Nice one!
- Wow.

942
01:15:44,651 --> 01:15:46,053
Cheese.

943
01:15:46,277 --> 01:15:48,579
- Pie.
- Wedge.

944
01:15:51,506 --> 01:15:54,309
Alright.
Come on. Let's do this.

945
01:15:55,734 --> 01:15:58,737
Smell something like your
winning streak going up to smoke?

946
01:15:59,562 --> 01:16:01,163
Is that this family joke?

947
01:16:01,187 --> 01:16:04,490
What would happen first:
Dad loses in Trivial Pursuit

948
01:16:05,015 --> 01:16:07,017
or Della finally appears.

949
01:16:08,742 --> 01:16:10,144
Della?

950
01:16:10,168 --> 01:16:11,669
Yeah, you remember the comet
I told you about.

951
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,395
The one that my dad
my dad discovered...

952
01:16:13,419 --> 01:16:16,221
He named it Della C 1981.

953
01:16:17,647 --> 01:16:19,648
After my great aunt, Adèle.

954
01:16:20,673 --> 01:16:22,675
- OK, let's go!
- Yeah, dad, come on.

955
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,502
Here we go. Jenny!

956
01:16:27,228 --> 01:16:28,829
For the win.

957
01:16:30,154 --> 01:16:32,156
Of what country
was Albert Einstein...

958
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:35,183
offered the presidency
in 1952?

959
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:42,766
Hum... Israel.

960
01:16:45,529 --> 01:16:47,130
Israel.

961
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:56,663
- It's OK.  Still love you.
- How does it feel, dad?

962
01:16:57,788 --> 01:17:00,491
- Are you sad?
- I'm alright

963
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:07,622
... section 3, paragraph h.

964
01:17:08,647 --> 01:17:12,050
- I'm sorry.
- I'm going for a walk.
- Sure.

965
01:17:15,077 --> 01:17:17,079
huhum.

966
01:17:20,406 --> 01:17:22,007
... just look at page 10.

967
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:44,352
How many stars do you think
there are in our galaxy?

968
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:49,569
I don't know.
Five hundred million.

969
01:17:51,395 --> 01:17:53,397
A couple of hundred billion.

970
01:17:59,339 --> 01:18:01,340
Plato believe that...

971
01:18:02,065 --> 01:18:06,369
every soul has a companion star
he returns to after death.

972
01:18:06,393 --> 01:18:08,395
If you live tomorrow life.

973
01:18:08,419 --> 01:18:10,421
You believe that?

974
01:18:11,946 --> 01:18:13,948
No. No. I'm a...

975
01:18:14,072 --> 01:18:15,274
I'm a scientist.

976
01:18:15,398 --> 01:18:17,400
Plato was a philosopher.

977
01:18:18,224 --> 01:18:19,826
A poet.

978
01:18:26,004 --> 01:18:28,806
Why did you name
your comet after my mother?

979
01:18:32,734 --> 01:18:36,237
If my calculations were correct.
They turned out to be wrong....

980
01:18:37,062 --> 01:18:39,565
It would have been the...
closest approach...

981
01:18:39,589 --> 01:18:43,392
to Earth of any comet
in 200 hundred years.

982
01:18:44,617 --> 01:18:46,619
In other words...

983
01:18:47,444 --> 01:18:49,146
Like your mother.

984
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:51,672
A near miss.

985
01:18:53,698 --> 01:18:55,700
What does that mean?

986
01:19:00,228 --> 01:19:02,230
I was gonna
propose to her.

987
01:19:08,484 --> 01:19:10,686
I had an engagement ring in my pocket.

988
01:19:13,913 --> 01:19:15,915
She stood me up.

989
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:24,447
Near miss.
Goodnight.

990
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,768
William?

991
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:39,293
She loved you too.

992
01:20:00,913 --> 01:20:02,315
Wow.

993
01:20:03,139 --> 01:20:05,842
We just met, right?

994
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:07,868
I know that.

995
01:20:09,894 --> 01:20:11,896
And I should probably
shut up right now.

996
01:20:16,548 --> 01:20:18,150
I'll just shut up.

997
01:20:18,474 --> 01:20:20,276
Come on. What?

998
01:20:25,376 --> 01:20:27,278
What is it?
I-I ca...

999
01:20:27,803 --> 01:20:29,805
I just gotta tell you the truth...

1000
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:33,032
I can't imagine
my life without you.

1001
01:20:34,057 --> 01:20:37,059
I know... It's probably the last thing
you wanna hear right now.

1002
01:20:39,786 --> 01:20:41,788
But I'm falling
in love with you, Jenny.

1003
01:20:42,813 --> 01:20:44,615
I can't help it.

1004
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:51,721
I don't know
what to say.

1005
01:20:52,246 --> 01:20:53,947
I don't know.

1006
01:20:55,072 --> 01:20:58,376
- I don't know what...
- Please, don't say anything.

1007
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,802
I just wanted you
to know how I feel.

1008
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:20,508
Oh, hello.

1009
01:21:20,532 --> 01:21:22,134
Jenny

1010
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:24,560
Do you know where
everyone went?

1011
01:21:24,584 --> 01:21:26,886
Yeah, Kathy and Kikki
went to the market.

1012
01:21:27,111 --> 01:21:29,113
and Ellis went
for a... for a run.

1013
01:21:29,337 --> 01:21:31,339
- Oh, OK.
- Hold on, you got a...

1014
01:21:31,663 --> 01:21:33,264
- ... a bug in your head.
- Oh!

1015
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:36,291
- Sorry, it's a...
- What is it?
- It's a ladybug.

1016
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:38,918
Oh, they say
they're good luck.

1017
01:21:40,944 --> 01:21:42,645
Did you get it?

1018
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,571
Got it.

1019
01:21:44,996 --> 01:21:46,497
Thank you.

1020
01:21:50,725 --> 01:21:52,727
Please tell Ellis
I went for a walk.

1021
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:43,046
- Della, you OK?
- Oh, my God!

1022
01:23:12,698 --> 01:23:14,700
Don't worry.
I will fix you.

1023
01:23:47,968 --> 01:23:49,669
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

1024
01:23:49,793 --> 01:23:51,795
Do you mind
taking a photo?

1025
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:53,821
No, no. It's OK, I don't...

1026
01:23:57,417 --> 01:23:59,418
No... we're wasting film.

1027
01:24:02,445 --> 01:24:04,447
3...2...1...

1028
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,822
I know.

1029
01:24:59,847 --> 01:25:01,849
I know who you are, Adaline.

1030
01:25:04,476 --> 01:25:05,877
What?

1031
01:25:08,504 --> 01:25:10,005
The scar.

1032
01:25:10,029 --> 01:25:13,032
The same scar.
I stitched it myself.

1033
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:17,152
Please.

1034
01:25:19,378 --> 01:25:20,879
The truth.

1035
01:25:30,364 --> 01:25:31,866
William...

1036
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:41,335
I thought I was losing my mind.

1037
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:47,564
How?
How is this possible?

1038
01:25:53,394 --> 01:25:55,096
I-I don't know.

1039
01:25:58,531 --> 01:26:00,333
I was normal... I...

1040
01:26:02,358 --> 01:26:04,661
And then one day
i-i just stopped.

1041
01:26:07,687 --> 01:26:09,489
I wanted to tell you so badly.

1042
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:12,616
But I couldn't.

1043
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:15,643
You know what
they'd do to me.

1044
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:18,470
- I-I...would been a...
- Curiosity.

1045
01:26:20,796 --> 01:26:22,798
- A specimen.
- Yes.

1046
01:26:27,919 --> 01:26:29,820
That's why you left.

1047
01:26:30,345 --> 01:26:32,046
That's why you...

1048
01:26:32,671 --> 01:26:34,373
disappeared.

1049
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:42,572
You can't imagine
how much it hurt.

1050
01:26:45,795 --> 01:26:49,499
I think I...
I think I can.

1051
01:26:54,327 --> 01:26:56,229
You never told anybody?

1052
01:26:57,154 --> 01:26:58,555
No.

1053
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:02,383
If I had, it would
have been Ellis.

1054
01:27:08,137 --> 01:27:10,539
Don't. Don't run away.

1055
01:27:11,464 --> 01:27:13,165
Don't disappear again, please.

1056
01:27:13,189 --> 01:27:14,591
For Ellis.

1057
01:27:15,315 --> 01:27:17,317
- I had a life.
- Please

1058
01:27:20,344 --> 01:27:24,348
All these years...
You've lived but you never had a life.

1059
01:27:25,993 --> 01:27:27,995
Please, for yourself,
for Ellis...

1060
01:27:29,901 --> 01:27:31,603
Stay, Adaline.

1061
01:27:32,528 --> 01:27:34,329
I don't know how.

1062
01:27:34,353 --> 01:27:36,355
Don't run, Adaline.
Adaline!

1063
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:38,882
Adaline.

1064
01:28:55,778 --> 01:28:57,780
Adaline.
Don't, don't. Adaline.

1065
01:28:57,804 --> 01:28:59,305
Adaline, please.

1066
01:28:59,329 --> 01:29:01,732
Please don't do this.
Adaline.

1067
01:29:02,056 --> 01:29:04,458
Don't. Think about, Ellis.
Please!

1068
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:07,585
Adaline, please!
Adaline!!

1069
01:29:33,414 --> 01:29:36,917
"Ellis, I'm so sorry.
I can't do this. I can't explain. Jenny"

1070
01:29:46,826 --> 01:29:50,430
Dad! Dad!
Where are your keys?

1071
01:29:55,058 --> 01:29:56,660
She's gone.

1072
01:30:02,389 --> 01:30:04,391
She's not coming back, son.

1073
01:30:05,116 --> 01:30:06,917
What just happened?

1074
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:08,743
What is... what is this?

1075
01:30:09,568 --> 01:30:11,269
Dad, what the hell
did you say to her?

1076
01:30:11,794 --> 01:30:13,295
Nothing.

1077
01:30:15,521 --> 01:30:17,223
She can't explain.

1078
01:30:17,647 --> 01:30:19,649
Please, tell me
what she said.

1079
01:30:22,576 --> 01:30:24,278
That's she's not capable.

1080
01:30:25,102 --> 01:30:27,104
Of what?

1081
01:30:31,633 --> 01:30:33,134
Of change.

1082
01:31:00,176 --> 01:31:01,977
Do you lover her?

1083
01:31:02,902 --> 01:31:05,805
Son.
Listen to me.

1084
01:31:05,929 --> 01:31:08,531
- Do you lover her?
- Yes.

1085
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:13,860
How do you know?

1086
01:31:14,285 --> 01:31:16,787
- Dad, I...
- It's a simple question.

1087
01:31:17,712 --> 01:31:19,414
How do you know?

1088
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,642
Because nothing
makes sense without her.

1089
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:33,063
- "Hello?"
- Oh, Tonika, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

1090
01:32:33,588 --> 01:32:36,190
- "Is everything OK?"
- No, no. I just... I wanted to tell you.

1091
01:32:36,715 --> 01:32:38,216
"What is it?"

1092
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:40,742
You're right.
No more running.

1093
01:32:40,967 --> 01:32:43,669
- "Oh, mom"
- I'll call you tomorrow, OK?.

1094
01:32:44,194 --> 01:32:46,796
- "I'm so happy to hear that."
- I love you.

1095
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:50,123
- "I love you too, mama".
- Bye.
- "Bye, momma."

1096
01:34:03,949 --> 01:34:07,953
The moon is responsible
for much of what takes place
on the surface of the Earth.

1097
01:34:09,078 --> 01:34:12,681
A stray meteor
hit the moon in 1178.

1098
01:34:13,706 --> 01:34:15,308
The result in concussion
would cause

1099
01:34:15,332 --> 01:34:19,035
extreme tides on every lunar phase
in Tierra Del Fuego, Argentina.

1100
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:23,864
A 23 per cent rise
in the mean tide on this night

1101
01:34:24,588 --> 01:34:28,092
produced a storm 200.000 miles
of the Pacific Coast

1102
01:34:29,717 --> 01:34:33,721
causing an increase in the amount
of molecular ionization in the atmosphere.

1103
01:34:35,547 --> 01:34:37,549
For the first time
in 78 years,

1104
01:34:39,575 --> 01:34:42,577
snow fell...
in this part of Sonoma County.

1105
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:49,372
In the first stages
of hypothermia...

1106
01:34:49,796 --> 01:34:52,799
The body will try
to generate heat
through shivering.

1107
01:34:54,825 --> 01:34:57,728
When this fails,
it will decrease
the flow of blood

1108
01:34:57,952 --> 01:34:59,654
to the extremities.

1109
01:35:01,079 --> 01:35:03,381
Metabolism
slows to a crawl.

1110
01:35:05,307 --> 01:35:07,709
You're dying,
but you don't know it.

1111
01:35:09,735 --> 01:35:11,136
In the final stages....

1112
01:35:11,861 --> 01:35:14,864
The victim breathes only
once or twice a minute.

1113
01:35:15,837 --> 01:35:18,039
A state of suspended animation.

1114
01:35:45,805 --> 01:35:47,206
Jenny!

1115
01:35:47,531 --> 01:35:49,533
At 7:07 P.M.

1116
01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:54,261
Adaline Bowman's
core temperature
had dropped to 87 degrees F [30º C].

1117
01:35:56,287 --> 01:35:58,289
Her heart
stopped beating.

1118
01:36:21,158 --> 01:36:24,762
At last,
at the age 107...

1119
01:36:25,887 --> 01:36:28,890
Adaline Bowman was,
by any definition...

1120
01:36:29,815 --> 01:36:31,416
dead.

1121
01:36:40,048 --> 01:36:41,850
At precisely 2:09 P.M.

1122
01:36:42,274 --> 01:36:46,278
paramedics placed two defibrillator paddles
on Adaline Bowman's chest.

1123
01:36:48,724 --> 01:36:53,929
They counted the prescribed
five seconds before ministering
750 volts of electricity.

1124
01:38:10,942 --> 01:38:13,444
- How is she?
- We've just run a series of tests...

1125
01:38:13,468 --> 01:38:15,771
and don't see any
long term damages.

1126
01:38:16,495 --> 01:38:18,097
It's quite remarkable, in fact.

1127
01:38:18,321 --> 01:38:20,323
Is she awake?
Could I go see her?

1128
01:38:20,347 --> 01:38:23,250
She's exhausted but you might
be able get her a few words.

1129
01:38:23,474 --> 01:38:25,376
OK.
Thank you.

1130
01:38:43,273 --> 01:38:44,774
Hi.

1131
01:38:48,678 --> 01:38:50,179
Jenny?

1132
01:38:51,705 --> 01:38:53,606
- Hi.
- Hey.

1133
01:39:09,257 --> 01:39:11,259
I know why you run away.

1134
01:39:13,685 --> 01:39:15,287
You do?

1135
01:39:15,611 --> 01:39:18,214
It's because of what
I said to you last night, isn't it?

1136
01:39:19,239 --> 01:39:20,940
I told you...

1137
01:39:21,565 --> 01:39:25,569
- And you got scared, I shouldn't...
- Come here, Ellis... Come here.

1138
01:39:35,582 --> 01:39:37,584
I love you too.

1139
01:39:57,142 --> 01:39:58,944
There's something else.

1140
01:40:06,976 --> 01:40:08,477
What?

1141
01:40:08,601 --> 01:40:10,303
What is it?

1142
01:40:12,729 --> 01:40:14,431
Oh...

1143
01:40:17,982 --> 01:40:19,784
Well, first...

1144
01:40:21,309 --> 01:40:23,311
My name isn't Jenny.

1145
01:40:34,618 --> 01:40:36,620
Oh, my God.
What happened?

1146
01:40:36,844 --> 01:40:39,046
Nothing, nothing.
An accident. I'm fine.

1147
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:42,173
- Yeah, but..
- Hey, I'm better than fine, OK?.

1148
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:48,303
- This is Ellis.
- Hello.
- Hello.

1149
01:40:48,327 --> 01:40:50,329
Is the man I've been
talking you about.

1150
01:40:53,355 --> 01:40:54,857
Oh!

1151
01:40:55,181 --> 01:40:56,983
Nice to meet you.

1152
01:40:57,607 --> 01:41:00,610
Hum... I'm Jenny's
grandmother.

1153
01:41:10,191 --> 01:41:12,594
What? But I said...

1154
01:41:14,619 --> 01:41:16,121
He knows.

1155
01:41:21,162 --> 01:41:22,763
He knows.

1156
01:41:42,842 --> 01:41:44,043
Hey, everybody.

1157
01:41:44,468 --> 01:41:46,670
I don't want to ruin the party,
but I wanna say something...

1158
01:41:46,694 --> 01:41:51,698
First of all, thanks for being here.
Kathy and I are really grateful
that you could all be here.

1159
01:41:51,722 --> 01:41:53,724
It means a lot to us

1160
01:41:53,748 --> 01:41:57,752
that you would be here
to helps celebrate the first

1161
01:41:57,776 --> 01:42:01,480
the first forty years
of our marriage.

1162
01:42:02,505 --> 01:42:05,507
When I first met this
lovely lady...

1163
01:42:07,033 --> 01:42:09,035
back in the older days

1164
01:42:09,059 --> 01:42:11,061
I had a...

1165
01:42:12,086 --> 01:42:16,089
I had a pretty good idea
of I wanted to do in my job but I...

1166
01:42:17,034 --> 01:42:19,036
I didn't really...

1167
01:42:20,562 --> 01:42:22,564
know what I wanted to...

1168
01:42:23,188 --> 01:42:27,793
be as a man when I grew up
if I ever... grew up.

1169
01:42:30,819 --> 01:42:36,525
The commitment that  she made
to our marriage and family...

1170
01:42:36,549 --> 01:42:38,551
to me...

1171
01:42:40,577 --> 01:42:42,578
the quality of her love...

1172
01:42:44,805 --> 01:42:47,807
led me to understand
that I could have...

1173
01:42:47,831 --> 01:42:50,234
no greater ambition
in life

1174
01:42:50,258 --> 01:42:52,260
than to be the best

1175
01:42:53,885 --> 01:42:56,688
possible husband I could be for her.

1176
01:42:57,613 --> 01:42:59,615
And I'm still working on it.

1177
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:04,443
So, here's to Kathy,

1178
01:43:04,968 --> 01:43:06,969
Love of my life.

1179
01:43:08,395 --> 01:43:10,197
Made of my soul.

1180
01:43:10,521 --> 01:43:12,523
Mother of my lovely children.

1181
01:43:14,749 --> 01:43:16,751
To Kathy.

1182
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:40,313
There you are, honey.
Good girl.

1183
01:43:45,542 --> 01:43:46,643
Hey, you guys!

1184
01:43:46,867 --> 01:43:49,570
You better hurry up.
You're going to be late for the event.

1185
01:43:49,594 --> 01:43:52,597
- Yeah, I've been waiting for ten minutes.
- Oh, so handsome.

1186
01:43:52,921 --> 01:43:55,223
- Thank you.
- I'm ready too.

1187
01:43:55,547 --> 01:43:56,748
- Wow
- Wow

1188
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:58,374
I just need a zip.

1189
01:43:58,598 --> 01:44:00,000
Are you sure you don't want
to come with us?

1190
01:44:00,224 --> 01:44:01,725
I'm positive.

1191
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:04,652
I've got my date
right here.

1192
01:44:05,477 --> 01:44:07,278
Come here, baby.

1193
01:44:07,703 --> 01:44:10,305
- OK, and I love you.
- Love you

1194
01:44:10,329 --> 01:44:12,331
I have to grab
my clutch.

1195
01:44:12,355 --> 01:44:14,357
And my camera.

1196
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,541
Adaline? You OK?

1197
01:44:56,925 --> 01:44:58,427
Yes.

1198
01:45:01,954 --> 01:45:03,556
Perfect.

1199
01:45:05,782 --> 01:45:09,785
The instant Adaline's heart
was struck by the defibrillator paddles,

1200
01:45:11,011 --> 01:45:15,014
the telomere structures in her genes
regain their pliability,

1201
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:16,940
causing her to resume

1202
01:45:16,964 --> 01:45:18,966
the natural course of aging.

1203
01:45:19,991 --> 01:45:21,993
William was right after all.

1204
01:45:22,618 --> 01:45:26,321
The comet Della C 1981
finally did return.

1205
01:45:26,645 --> 01:45:28,447
A half century late

1206
01:45:28,471 --> 01:45:30,473
but as bright
and magnificent

1207
01:45:30,697 --> 01:45:32,699
as he had predicted.
