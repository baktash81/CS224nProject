1
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,529
Coo coo! Coo coo!

2
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,157
Time to wake up!

3
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,021
It's bedtime, off you go!

4
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,020
It's nighttime,
if you won't sleep, you won't eat.

5
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:19,361
Bruno? Albert? - It's me, Jaak the Fly!
Why are you running around like owls?

6
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,119
Off to bed now to cuddle your pillows.
Sweet dreams!

7
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,332
The day is over,
no reason to sit here.

8
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,290
Dive into your beds,
dreams are knocking on your door.

9
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,091
They are real sweet,
like marzipan.

10
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,631
Mati what are you doing here so late?

11
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,383
Enough!
The bed is crying for you.

12
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,895
An athlete has to sleep well
or he is weak as a pea.

13
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:50,601
Pigs! No more sandcakes tonight,
it's bedtime for everybody.

14
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,523
All snouts under blankets!

15
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,361
Blankets up to chin,
then it is warm.

16
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,195
Don't leave out your toes.
Off to bed, everybody!

17
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:05,332
Eduard, old lazy-bones, enough of
lazing about in the hammock, you hear!

18
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,623
Are you asleep already?
Very good, there's a good boy!

19
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,379
Put away this hammer,
you can continue in the morning.

20
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,011
Did you hear me?
Give it to me!

21
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,937
Right. Off to bed you go.
Gone crazy with all the inventing.

22
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,606
What would they do without me?

23
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,987
Well, peace and quiet at last!

24
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,997
Miss Lotte, and what do you think
you're doing here?

25
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:58,092
It's so nice to sit here.
I get all kinds of interesting ideas.

26
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,086
Nighttime is for sleeping,
not for thinking.

27
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,050
Uncle Jaak, does anyone live
on the moon? - Where?

28
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,729
No one can live there, you know.
The moon is made of chalk

29
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:16,228
and chalk is only good for scribbling
faces on blackboard in school.

30
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:20,357
You can't even eat it.
Juku, the drone fly, tried it once.

31
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,617
I asked: "So how was it?"

32
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:27,789
He squeaked like a girl:
"Jaak, it gives me the hiccups!"

33
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:32,411
Chalk made his voice shrill.
"Jaak, it gives me the hiccups!"

34
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:42,171
No more jokes, off to bed you go!
- I will, uncle Jaak.

35
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,218
Every night I shoo you to bed -
it's like threading.

36
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,388
For Bedbug's sake,
you're a troublemaker!

37
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,397
I wonder where did they
take all that chalk from?

38
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,902
Perfect fit.
- We're in the right place.

39
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,954
Let's lift him out.

40
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,733
At last.
- Hey, who are you?

41
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,577
What is it, an earthquake?
- There were some strangers here.

42
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,577
Look what I found.
- That is my bedtime stone.

43
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,669
Oh, and my old shoe!
Where did that come from?

44
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,634
When I came,
the shoe was on your foot already.

45
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,596
I don't understand anything.

46
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,192
Dad, someone wanted
to take this stone from Klaus.

47
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,936
Oh, dear shoe,
I haven't seen you for so long.

48
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:32,443
Where have you been? Still nice
of you to find your way back.

49
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,989
With one shoe you can
only stand on one leg like a stork.

50
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,240
Look! A stork is dancing!

51
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,835
Uncle Klaus,
where did you get this stone?

52
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,544
This happened on my last journey.

53
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:52,137
I have two old friends -
we went to school together -

54
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,306
and we went hiking every year.

55
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,892
This time we were at
the other end of the world,

56
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,182
where the mountains were so high

57
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,773
that it felt like standing on a cloud
and looking down.

58
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,102
One night we decided
to camp on a mountain.

59
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:14,235
We had picked some very sweet jungle
radishes and wanted to stew them,

60
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,579
so, well, I went to gather
some twigs for the fire.

61
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,393
We divided the stones
fairly among ourselves.

62
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,735
Fred got the yellow one,
Ville got the red one,

63
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,864
and my stone was grey.
But the stone has been useful too.

64
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,363
At night, when the moon is in the sky,
the stone gets warm.

65
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,375
I hug it and it's like
sleeping on a stove.

66
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,591
Ouch?

67
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,593
What does it mean?

68
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:37,646
How exciting!
- This stone is a machine.

69
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,147
I feel that there is
a secret hidden here.

70
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:44,618
And what are the other stones then?
- We have to find them quickly.

71
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,956
Where do your friends live?
- It's a week's journey.

72
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,951
A week! Too long time!

73
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,375
I know what to do.
Dad, will you help us?

74
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,168
Klaus and I will need a motorbike.
- Are you also going?

75
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,971
Of course, it's exciting!
Uncle Klaus can get in trouble.

76
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,511
And he promised to
give me traveling lessons.

77
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,728
That's what I said, yes.
- Well, it is fine then.

78
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,223
Go, have some adventures,
no use dreaming at home.

79
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:19,855
You're the best Dad in the world!
New adventures are waiting for us!

80
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,074
Go!

81
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:36,379
Uncle Klaus, we'll start at once.
- Yes, next week.

82
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:41,092
Uncle Klaus! - The weather is
not so nice, it can rain and...

83
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,597
My weather station forecasts
dry weather for the whole week.

84
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,640
All right then.

85
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,440
Did you disjoint your back?

86
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,277
I shake my breakfast into
the right intestine.

87
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:09,154
It's the thing you have to do
before a journey. - Hooray!

88
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,781
Now we have to follow them closely.

89
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,703
When your socks get wet, then
it is best to dry them over a fire,

90
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,875
and when you've got
a pebble in your shoe

91
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,045
then stand on your head for a while,
and it will fall out.

92
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,259
That's what I always did
when I was a child.

93
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:28,506
I know... Where is Dad? Dad!

94
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,853
What?

95
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,519
That's so cool!

96
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:56,208
Remember, Klaus, this bike needs
a gentle touch, not brutal strength.

97
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,579
Don't worry, I'll kiss it
good night every evening.

98
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:04,505
Don't be silly, you're an old dog!
- But my soul is young.

99
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,181
Now it starts.

100
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,219
Onward to great adventures!

101
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,536
And hop, and hop, and hop...

102
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:39,168
But I baked some pies...
- Show me. Cabbage pies!

103
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,003
Don't worry, they won't go to waste.

104
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,337
And hop, and hop, and hop...

105
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,859
Uncle Klaus, I forgot
to take my toothbrush.

106
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:09,027
Don't worry, a real traveler
finds all the necessary things.

107
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,196
So how would you find
toothbrushes in woods?

108
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,079
Lesson number one -
out of a fir tree.

109
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,874
You're joking.
- Watch and learn.

110
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:28,592
You just have to find the right tree.
If you call under the wrong tree,

111
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,883
then you'll get a soap
instead of a toothbrush.

112
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,432
Two toothbrushes, please!

113
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:21,262
That's a traveler's kit,
a toothbrush and a handkerchief.

114
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,272
How did you know?

115
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,893
A proper traveler just
has to believe these things.

116
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,739
Let's get them too.
- We've got no time for that.

117
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,231
Grandma is waiting.

118
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,916
One two three, two two three,
heels and toes.

119
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,298
Quicker, my sweet ones.

120
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,352
One two three, two two three,
one two three.

121
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,903
My dear, the back of a dancer
has to be straight as a ski-pole.

122
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,740
Sweetie, a dancer has to float.

123
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,261
Hi!

124
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,931
Sweetie, you can't be late
for a dance lesson.

125
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:29,686
I'm sorry but we came...
- All right, sweetie, you'll learn it.

126
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,777
Right foot forward,
left one to the side...

127
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,861
Very good, but now...

128
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,128
Not bad, but like this...

129
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,140
Cool! I'll dance now
instead of morning exercises.

130
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,706
Hoo, hoo, hoo!

131
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,794
Samba, rumba, slow foxtrot!

132
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,011
Hop, hop, hop, hop.

133
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:46,718
Ouch...! Who is that!?
- That's Klaus.

134
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:51,021
My darling, my sweetie,
how come you're here?

135
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,856
We must talk.
- I am Lotte.

136
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:58,438
You're wonderful, you've got
light bones like a baby bird.

137
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,606
We came because of...
- ...the green stone.

138
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,317
Have you still got the stone?
- Yes, I have.

139
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,162
And no one else is able to get it.
Come, see yourself.

140
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:14,875
Where are they? We are not gonna
make it like this. - I'll go and see.

141
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,815
Ladies' choice.

142
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,743
It's unbelievable,
I have been pushed out of my own room.

143
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,412
I grew little flowers there

144
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,209
until one full moon night
I left the green stone on my table.

145
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,921
My little flowers started
to grow so rapidly

146
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:09,049
that I can't even get into
the room anymore. Here you are.

147
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,973
Can't you do anything about it?

148
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:17,107
I tried, I challenged these
shameless plants to a duel.

149
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,691
Ho!

150
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,779
It's the stone that
makes the flowers grow quickly.

151
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,121
We must get this stone.

152
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,450
Impossible, no one can
move in this jungle.

153
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:39,876
I have been in a number of jungles
in my life, this here is nothing.

154
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,262
You see?
- I'll go, I'm smaller.

155
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,770
It's a real jungle.
- Real jungle, real jungle.

156
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:04,571
Hi, I'm looking for a green stone.
- Green stone, green stone.

157
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,609
Ah, you're parroting.
- Parroting, carroting,

158
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,991
dividing, subtracting and distracting.
I know my math.

159
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,950
So you're a good birdie.
- Good birdie.

160
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,293
But are you seedy?
- Or am I needy?

161
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,710
Or are you greedy?
- No, I'm not. I'm not greedy!

162
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,258
No, no, not greedy! Not greedy!

163
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,132
Then tell me
where I find the green stone?

164
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,430
The green stone
is under the table.

165
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,717
How can I get there?
- Take a cab!

166
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,940
How are you, old boy?
- Ah...

167
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:46,109
Don't your feet hurt from all
this hopping? - No, they don't.

168
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,904
But I tell you, dear friend,
I'll be bald soon.

169
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:54,530
Every morning when I comb my hair,
some hair falls out.

170
00:22:54,665 --> 00:23:00,662
It doesn't show at all.
- I glue new hair from my tail there.

171
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,710
Look here, I've got it!
I've got it!

172
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:23,438
Dear girl, the stones are magnificent!
May I?

173
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,982
I feel that they are meant for me.

174
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:36,614
Give them to me, they're ours!
- Don't stomp! You should float.

175
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,992
Could I get my stones now?
We are really in a hurry.

176
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:49,376
Keep it up, old boy.
- Let us leave it just between us.

177
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,421
My hair.
- Don't you worry.

178
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,639
My darlings, that's enough for today,
we'll dance again tomorrow.

179
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:11,030
After the dance you escort the lady
back to her seat! What a lout!

180
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:18,955
Aah, I love Matilda!

181
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,251
And hop, and hop, and hop...

182
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,095
But she doesn't seem to notice me.

183
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,639
But what if I take
these stones to her?

184
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,056
She liked these,
maybe she would smile at me.

185
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,521
The stones are not mine!

186
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,937
I love Matilda!

187
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,813
I know what to do.

188
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:55,943
I'll find Lotte and Klaus
and ask for the stones.

189
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,320
I want to give them to Matilda.

190
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:02,620
I'm sure that they have kind hearts
and they will give me...

191
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,834
Matilda!

192
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,387
And hop, and hop...

193
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,375
Where did they go?

194
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,165
I'll see them soon.

195
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,587
Matilda!

196
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,101
Why did you stop?

197
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,225
How would I get down?

198
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,524
Hey, would somebody help me?

199
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,659
The fires of travelers
are like stars in a dark night.

200
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:30,834
The more there are travelers,
the cozier is the world.

201
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,628
Are the stars someone's fires then?

202
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,175
Birds and butterflies and mosquitoes
and all the others who fly there.

203
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,764
They get also tired at night.

204
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:47,308
Then they make a fire on a cloud
and lie down and wriggle their toes.

205
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:52,901
That's how the stars get to the sky.
Squint your eyes to have a better look.

206
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,771
Lesson number two.

207
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,714
We've got one day left.
- We'll get the stones.

208
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:37,404
Hey, wait for me!
I can't find you if you go away!

209
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,217
Ouch!
How can we get through this?

210
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,341
Lesson number three.

211
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:12,105
A true traveler never goes out
without an umbrella.

212
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,021
At least it didn't ruin my pants.

213
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,741
You little rogue,
I've got you now!

214
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:29,285
Come here, you're
so lovely and so unruly.

215
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:42,795
Oh, who else do I see there?
You're a fatty, a real roly-poly.

216
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,217
Uncle Klaus is not fat.

217
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,511
I haven't seen such a beauty
for a long time.

218
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:52,934
Hop in, don't be afraid,
this small jump is nothing for you.

219
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,642
We'll go inside in a moment
and you'll see your new home.

220
00:28:56,777 --> 00:29:01,863
I won't hurt you.
I'll just record

221
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,701
that on such a date this
or that marvelous raindrop arrived.

222
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:12,244
Oh my darlings, I'm so busy
with them, but it is pure joy.

223
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,414
Round, with small pink patches...

224
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,763
Wider below
as if wearing a little dress.

225
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:32,226
The upper end forks,
so there seem to be two pigtails.

226
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:39,689
That's all. Now I'll take you
to rest after the long journey.

227
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,655
Have a good sleep,
nobody is going to disturb you.

228
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,197
Excuse me.
- What?

229
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,363
I'm Lotte. I'm interested in...
- In rain?

230
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,998
Then you're in the right place.
I'm a rain researcher Voldemar.

231
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,914
I collect raindrops,
and they are so brave and beautiful,

232
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,959
jumping down from the cloud
without an umbrella.

233
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:05,756
This is the king of raindrops,
the crown of my collection.

234
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,129
I hope you won't mind,
Your Royal Highness,

235
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,011
a fan of yours came
to pay her respects.

236
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,348
Ah!
- Got it!

237
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,230
No need to be afraid,
you poor raindrop.

238
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:30,201
Let me blow the pain away.

239
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,868
The backpack is so big,
it gets stuck everywhere.

240
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:38,118
I beg you, take your horrible
backpack into the hall at once.

241
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:42,418
This is not a camp site.
Those tourists!

242
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:47,086
Soon they're going
to pitch a tent here.

243
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:53,099
As we all perfectly well know,
rain usually comes down.

244
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,344
But there is a certain kind
of rubber rain,

245
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,810
the drops of which bounce back
as soon as they fall down,

246
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,894
and the rubber rain
comes down and up at the same time.

247
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:08,023
Down and up, lal la laa, trallalaa.

248
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:12,619
Right, if it rains, you'll get wet.

249
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,119
I would rather say that those
thousands beautiful raindrops

250
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,617
make nests for themselves
in your clothes.

251
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:23,417
Now, dear rain enthusiasts,
we'll go down to the cellar.

252
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:29,211
I have collected a lot of material
on the marvelous world of rain.

253
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:34,891
This rain tasted like boiled carrot.
Would you like to try? - Why not?

254
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,066
Right, carrot indeed!

255
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,942
What's in here?
- It's the silver rain.

256
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:57,744
When the drops touched the ground,
they rang like small bells.

257
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,961
Our stones.
- The red one is still missing.

258
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,820
Now I'll take the stones to Matilda
and she'll love me at once.

259
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:38,906
I had to ask for permission -
Matilda won't love a thief.

260
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,327
This guy is after our stones too.

261
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,203
I'll go and ask -
it's not that difficult.

262
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,748
We have to stop him.

263
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:51,209
But what if he won't let me?
What if he says that no way.

264
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:56,510
Matilda will never love me then.
No, no, unfortunately I cannot ask...

265
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,426
But where is the backpack?

266
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,121
Hallo, anybody here? Hallo.

267
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,490
Oh, an art enthusiast!
Welcome!

268
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,039
You haven't seen...
- You haven't seen?

269
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,504
But look then because
there's a lot to see here.

270
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,420
You're in the glorious museum
of spider webs.

271
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,801
No need to hurry, admire, enjoy,

272
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,387
you won't see spider webs like these
anywhere else,

273
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:40,891
they are so perfect that once you
start looking, you cannot stop.

274
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,762
I see that the backpack is not here.
Bye.

275
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,183
Why do you keep me here?
I'm in a hurry!

276
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:53,063
I keep wondering how on earth
can I be so talented.

277
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:58,239
We would like to get going but it is
raining so hard, we cannot get through.

278
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:03,582
You shouldn't disturb or break the rain.
- Let's lie and wait for it to stop.

279
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,075
Don't you ever say that!

280
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,625
But fortunately the rain
never stops here.

281
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,839
But we really have to go.

282
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:16,507
It's funny how people always want to
go somewhere when it's raining.

283
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,974
Actually there are narrow paths
inside the rain

284
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:30,024
and you can walk there and stay dry.
It's a labyrinth rain.

285
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:34,771
I will give you a map,
follow it and it will be fine.

286
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,238
Here you are.

287
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,860
I'll take my backpack.

288
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,167
It was fascinating.

289
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,887
Thank you... Matilda!

290
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,180
See you.

291
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,899
Tralla-lalla laa...

292
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,069
Excuse me,
I am looking for a backpack.

293
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,159
Young man,
you're not in a hikers' club.

294
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,780
But there was a backpack here,
I saw it. - Was, and now it's gone.

295
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,622
Gone where?
- There.

296
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:33,122
Wait, I'll give you a map. - I don't
need a map, I need the backpack!

297
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,837
Why does love have to be
so complicated and wet?

298
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:20,130
But I won't give up.
I love you, Matilda!

299
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:33,940
Well boys, bend and stretch,
bend and stretch.

300
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,728
Wonderful, isn't it?
The weather is fine, the air is fresh,

301
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:41,405
muscles are throbbing under the skin.

302
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:48,075
Come here, Hardi,
show me that you're a true athlete.

303
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:57,005
Pull your belly in, move your arms,
push with your bottom...!

304
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,876
What was that -
you jump like a little girl!

305
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,798
Are your thigh muscles really so weak?

306
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,391
One two, one two,
one two, one two...

307
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:20,771
Riho, you want to break records,
don't you? To fly higher and farther!

308
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:26,776
Shame on you, a baby frog
can jump better than you!

309
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,531
If you won't practice properly,
no girls will look at you twice!

310
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,918
Well, it made you sweat?
Would you like me to join you?

311
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,840
I'm looking for a backpack.
- With your gear in it?

312
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,017
There are stones in it,
one of them golden.

313
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,555
You've won a gold medal?!
I can see that.

314
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,603
I'm looking for a backpack,
have you seen it?

315
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,821
Such a long and graceful step!

316
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:38,894
Maybe he's not at home?
- Right, he's snoring.

317
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,356
Sleeps in the middle of the day?
- Ville is lazy.

318
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:46,193
When we were travelling together,
he couldn't be bothered to walk.

319
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:50,110
How could he travel then?
- We dragged him on a sledge.

320
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:55,873
Ville, old boy, wake up!
Rise and shine! Do you hear me?

321
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,381
The trumpets sound,
wake up all sleepers!

322
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:12,257
Once when we travelled we left Ville
cooking rice porridge for our lunch

323
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,800
and went to pick blackberries with Fred.

324
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:19,013
When we got back, Ville had made
a pillow out of the porridge

325
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:24,026
and slept on it. Woof! Woof!
- Miaow.

326
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:28,147
Miaow.
- So what happens now?

327
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,991
Lesson number four.

328
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,239
You, Lotte, will enter his dream
and ask about the red stone.

329
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:39,534
I'll sing you a lullaby,
you'll fall asleep

330
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:43,128
and find yourself
in the world of dreams. - Cool!

331
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:51,547
But how will I find Ville there?
- You will. You're sharp as a knife.

332
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:57,222
Just be careful not to enter
the gates of bad dreams.

333
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:03,020
Tikk, you must go to the land of dreams
and listen to what Ville tells Lotte.

334
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:10,024
Hush, little baby, don't say a word,
mama's gonna buy you a mocking bird...

335
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:38,176
Excuse me, I'm looking for Ville.
- I am so tall and you're so small!

336
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:42,188
I'm not small!
- Like a tiny fir tree needle.

337
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:45,934
I don't think that it's funny!
- But it is!

338
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:51,113
I'm a giraffe only in my dream.
I'm really a ladybird!

339
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:01,791
Excuse me, I'm looking for Ville.
Hallo?

340
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,297
Oh!
- Are you looking for somebody?

341
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,799
I'm looking for Ville.
Do you know him?

342
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:16,298
Look up. He's circling somewhere there.
He spends all his days and nights here.

343
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:21,894
Ville, ahoy!
- Who's calling me? I'm coming.

344
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:27,066
Here I am! - I'm Lotte,
uncle Klaus sent me to see you.

345
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,735
Come, let's fly together!
- But I can't.

346
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,693
Dream world is lovely!

347
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,785
In the dream world you can do
anything that you want.

348
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:50,710
I love flying, that's why
I'm sleeping all the time!

349
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:55,173
We're looking for the red stone
that you found on your journey.

350
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:59,841
I gave it to penguins!
This stone was very troublesome.

351
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:04,220
It started to glow every time
when the moon was in the sky at night.

352
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,098
I couldn't fly any more!

353
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,692
Where did the penguins go?
- To the island of penguins.

354
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,733
You have to go to the harbor
and get a boat.

355
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:19,361
Would you like some ice-cream?
- I've no time.

356
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:28,043
Come to my birthday.
- No time.

357
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,212
Purr...

358
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,836
Have you seen a wonderful bad dream?
- No. But I...

359
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,387
...have just enough time to see it.

360
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,721
This is a marvelous bad dream,
you just have to see it.

361
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:11,587
Goodbye, I have to wake up now!
- See you in some other dream!

362
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,421
Help! Help!

363
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,930
Don't cry, everything will be fine.

364
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:29,851
We'll wake up in a minute
and you won't remember this bad dream.

365
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:50,373
Do not knit the sun in my mittens,
do the moon or some stars instead.

366
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,707
Uu-uu-uuu...

367
00:43:56,384 --> 00:44:00,594
The trumpets are sounding,
get up all ye sleepers!

368
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:05,091
Yes, I hear, I hear.
- Ville told me everything.

369
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:09,345
I saved a small three-eared rabbit
from bad dreams.

370
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,730
Everything is possible in dreams.

371
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,106
Wake up.

372
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:19,029
Penguins have got the third stone.

373
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,942
We could go to a training camp
together. I know a good place.

374
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,696
Please, I can't any more.
- No problem, let's have a rest.

375
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,199
The relaxations exercises
are always good.

376
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:40,338
I can even give you a massage,
if you wish.

377
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:49,226
Your thigh muscles
are very supple like willow saplings.

378
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,582
Isn't that the island of penguins?

379
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,957
Let's take the boat
and go there at once.

380
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,507
Hallo!
- Hush.

381
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,601
Uncle Klaus and I really need a boat.

382
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:41,903
That's the best place
for catching pancakes. Try it.

383
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:46,525
But you have to make them,
you can't just go pancaking.

384
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:51,372
You're so wrong, little girl.
- Lesson number five.

385
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,126
The pancakes caught in the sea
are the sweetest. - Absolutely.

386
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,890
Uncle Klaus, look!
- A big one!

387
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:21,193
That's for you.
I'll catch another one.

388
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:52,516
I'll just catch another one,
and then we'll be off.

389
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,181
Uncle Klaus, don't you like it?

390
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,056
Why are you so red?

391
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,608
Holy Eel, I've never
seen anything like this!

392
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,036
I'll call the doctors!

393
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,702
And who are you?

394
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,127
Teacher?

395
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:27,213
Doctors, it's the harbor master
Leo speaking, do you hear me?

396
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,634
What's wrong with you?
- Nothing wrong with me

397
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:33,428
but one person here
is red all over like a perch.

398
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,309
Stands like a mast,
doesn't even bat an eye.

399
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:39,805
Calm down, the doctors
will be with you shortly.

400
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,733
Come here, quick!

401
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,073
The pulse is weak...
- Breathes quietly.

402
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,741
Won't let the pancake go.

403
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,075
Red all over
and makes strange noises.

404
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,545
It's the disease
of the red pillar of salt.

405
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,040
We must operate.
- Oh!

406
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:28,445
Teacher, why don't you move?
Say something!

407
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,866
Help us, please!

408
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,246
Jellyfish forbid, here's another one!
The doctors left him behind.

409
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:52,962
Raise the anchor, hoist the sails,
forward at full speed!

410
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,912
My finger hurts!

411
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:34,420
Uncle Klaus, don't worry,
you'll be well soon.

412
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,635
You just have to lie down for a while.

413
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:42,511
The red stone won't go anywhere.
We know that the penguins have it.

414
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,104
You rest for a couple of days,
get well

415
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,646
and then we'll sail to the island.
We are in no hurry.

416
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,144
Teacher,
the backpack with our stones is there,

417
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,114
Lotte and Klaus are there too.
They'll be there for days.

418
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:59,908
Take the backpack, go to the island
and find the third stone.

419
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,826
What about you, teacher?

420
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:06,418
If I won't make it in time,
you will leave without me. - No!

421
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,955
That's an order.
Take the compass.

422
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:14,926
The fate of all the others
is in your hands now.

423
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,512
We'll operate immediately.

424
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,732
Disgusting! Terrible!

425
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,233
Stop it!

426
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,344
Long live fir trees and birches,
the most beautiful trees in the world!

427
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:48,971
Long live bluebells!
Hooray to gingerbread and jam!

428
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,684
But that is our backpack!

429
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,422
Help!

430
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:38,737
I've seen you somewhere...
In the land of dreams!

431
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:43,032
Why do you want the stones?
- Without them we can't get home.

432
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,402
Where is home? What is your name?

433
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,162
I am Tikk.
My home is on the moon.

434
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,330
Do you think that I'm stupid? Fly
Jaak said that moon is made of chalk.

435
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,957
Not true!
The moon is not made of chalk

436
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:58,878
and many rabbits live there.
- But how did you get here?

437
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:03,344
Once a year me and my classmates,
come down here to have botany classes.

438
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,427
Then we pick all kinds
of plants and berries.

439
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,684
But last year,
just before we wanted to leave,

440
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:12,930
something completely
unexpected happened...

441
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:50,134
Children, it's time. Let's go home.
- Hooray, home, hooray, home!

442
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:53,979
I'll give these to my mother
for her birthday. She likes flowers.

443
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:40,183
Teacher Rihv and I went
to look for the owner of the shoe,

444
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,562
because without the stones
we can't get back home.

445
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,859
We need the stones tomorrow
at midnight,

446
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,529
the moon is
in the right position then.

447
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,573
Otherwise we have to
wait for another year.

448
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,121
Don't worry, I know what to do.

449
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:58,206
We'll go to the island of penguins
at once.

450
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:01,045
I only have to write
a note to Klaus.

451
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:05,884
"Me and Tikk went
to get the third stone. Lotte."

452
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:10,881
Where's the post office?
- I've no idea.

453
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:23,060
There was a letter box there.
- How did you know?

454
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:28,987
Lesson number six. A true traveler
just has to believe in these things.

455
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:33,407
Onward to the island of penguins!
- Onward!

456
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:39,705
Help! Help!
- Ten kilometers without stopping.

457
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:42,750
You are so strong, it's fantastic!

458
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,929
Wait a bit, are you a swimmer?

459
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:59,973
And I, stupid cow, was thinking all this
time that you're a runner. It's a pity.

460
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,437
Ohoo!

461
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:11,825
What a cute little athlete!
Let's start with squats.

462
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,014
Hallo, hallo...

463
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,857
Hallo, I'm Ulrika,
I make delicious jam pies.

464
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,568
We like things...

465
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:52,986
Wait a moment. Hold on.
- Please, give us things.

466
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,952
Let's see what we've got here.

467
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,537
Please.
- A fork!

468
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:02,664
A real fork! We've got a fork!

469
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:07,505
A fork, a fork,
we've got a fork now! Hooray!

470
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:11,502
Excuse me, but we're looking for
a red stone. - Has anybody seen it?

471
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,675
Yes! We received it from Ville,
from Ville!

472
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:18,891
Where is the stone now?
- The stone flew away, whoosh!

473
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,432
The things always fly away here.

474
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,022
My pacifier flew away.

475
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,813
Why do things fly
up to the mountain?

476
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:31,817
They just do. Ping, whoosh!
- And then we bring new things.

477
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:36,694
And then these fly away.
- And then we bring new things again.

478
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:47,045
We have to climb the mountain at once.
Let's go!

479
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:53,756
Whoosh!
- Ping, Lotte flew away.

480
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:43,302
Oh my! - Oh! How can we find
the red stone in this heap?

481
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,145
I've got a great idea!
Give me the stones.

482
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,692
Yes.

483
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:00,944
Lotte!

484
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,292
Stop! After them!

485
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:26,723
Haa!

486
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:28,975
Ha!

487
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,040
I look like a mop!

488
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:52,413
But my mother always said: Hannes,
a snow lion has to be nicely combed.

489
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:56,674
Let us try once more.
Where is the blasted comb?

490
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:01,718
Your comb is here!
- Thank you, penguins.

491
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:20,315
But it's static electricity.
- Static what?

492
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,284
You don't know?
Are you from the moon or what?

493
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:27,746
Yes, I am.
- Right, I forgot. Then learn.

494
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,413
Don't worry, uncle Hannes,
everything will be fine!

495
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:37,207
No, it won't. Don't even hope.
I think that I have to shave my head?

496
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,044
Ahaa!

497
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,354
Now you have been earthed.
Comb now!

498
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:54,641
No, I won't, it's no use.
I won't comb.

499
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,940
But, honestly!
- I don't believe you.

500
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,658
Goodbye, uncle Hannes!

501
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:17,960
I can comb my hair!
I can make a parting.

502
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,917
Or maybe a fringe.

503
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:28,140
Or perhaps I'll like curls.

504
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,556
Mother was right -
I am a really handsome boy!

505
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,526
We got back our things!
Your trousers are here!

506
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,612
That's my white scarf!

507
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,608
The house was full of
static electricity

508
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,943
and it pulled all things to it.

509
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:51,618
But we conducted the electricity
out of the house! - You're so smart.

510
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,618
I'm an inventor's daughter!
Where are your friends?

511
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:58,372
Teacher Rihv gave me his compass,
this should show us the way.

512
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,257
Right. We have to go there.

513
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:08,680
But we lost our boat.
- That's right.

514
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:13,019
We can take you there!
- We have got a huge boat!

515
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,603
Hooray! Hooray!

516
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:28,784
Matilda, I'll rest for a while,
then we'll go on.

517
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:58,305
Easy, easy, easy and slow.
When we're singing the slow song

518
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:07,821
Let's not hurry, folks

519
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:14,790
Easy, easy, easy and without hurry.
A piece of ice as it appears...

520
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,454
Excuse me, can't we move
a bit quicker?

521
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,578
It's the slow part of the song,
the next one is quick,

522
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,876
then we'll move quicker.

523
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:28,049
...can serve as a boat for us.

524
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:39,144
Now me, now you
Now, all together

525
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:46,647
Let the boat go ahead
Everybody has to join

526
01:03:56,291 --> 01:04:00,911
Teacher, tonight is the night.
- The moon is full.

527
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:02,253
I know.

528
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:07,250
But there are no news
of teacher Rihv and Tikk. - Yeah...

529
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:10,878
When shall we get home?
- I don't know.

530
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,222
Ohh.

531
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:20,271
Now me, now you
Now, all together

532
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:24,813
Let the boat go ahead
Everybody has to join

533
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:29,068
Now me, now, you
Nobody can stand aside

534
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:33,694
The harder we work together
The sooner will reach the destination

535
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:58,009
Hooray! Hooray!

536
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,563
Thank you, penguins!
- Thank you!

537
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:32,919
Ah! Who is that?
- Who is that?

538
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:40,260
Salute to brave moon rabbits!
- You can't!

539
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,806
Don't be afraid,
this is my friend Lotte.

540
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:50,315
Thanks to Lotte we got the stones
and can go return home!

541
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,283
But where is teacher Rihv?
- He fell ill.

542
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:59,199
Teacher Rihv said that
if he couldn't make it in time,

543
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:02,823
we should leave without him.
- What a noble rabbit!

544
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,200
Ouch!

545
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,553
Children, it is time.

546
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:34,189
How far is it?
- We can see it already.

547
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:44,282
We still have so much to tell...

548
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,374
Ah! Help!

549
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:11,234
Teacher Rihv!
- Hooray, hooray!

550
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:16,022
Salute to brave astronauts!

551
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:21,240
Rihv and I became good friends
at the hospital.

552
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,737
I told him everything.

553
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:26,411
Well, and I realized that we
had to take to our heels.

554
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:28,375
And now home!

555
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:35,291
Yellow, grey, and the red one!
The happier my Matilda will be.

556
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:38,419
Oh!
- Give me the backpack!

557
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,213
I can't, earrings look
so good on her.

558
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:45,093
I'm sorry, thank you, goodbye.
- You can't do this!

559
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,344
I know!

560
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:48,137
Follow him!

561
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:57,230
Two doors, which is the right one?

562
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,657
Let love lead me!

563
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:20,886
Hold on, hold on, don't push!
- You don't push! Ouch!

564
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:26,345
This is the sky bean,
it takes us back to the moon.

565
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,520
Cool!

566
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,196
Tikk, it's time.

567
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:33,821
Goodbye Tikk!
Have a nice trip to the moon.

568
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:38,291
Nice contraptions you've got here.
It's like an elevator.

569
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,499
And we never heard
what the moon was made of.

570
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:25,123
Dear child, there a damned
many things that we don't know.

571
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,923
Oh.

572
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:30,795
Oh, what a weird cone!

573
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:35,800
I'll take it with me -
it might take us to new adventures.

574
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:40,805
Lotte, give me a break, will you?
- Lesson number seven.

575
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:45,309
Life has to be exiting, uncle Klaus!

576
01:12:52,952 --> 01:13:00,450
We were thinking what names
to give to those colorful stones

577
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:08,292
And we found out, we found out
how we should name them

578
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:16,550
We decided to call them
The Moon Stones

579
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:23,932
And not - The Stone Moons

580
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:29,027
Well, such a colorful stones
can bring you home

581
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:33,365
Whatever, to the moon,
as far as The Long Bean grows

582
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:37,244
The Moon Rabits will wait for you
there and will ask:' How do you do?'

583
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:41,741
And maybe some of them will
become your best friends too!

584
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:23,141
THE END
