1
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,620
This does not look good.
Cap Rooney, three-time league MVP...

2
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,420
...and Coach Tony D'Amato's star
38-year-old quarterback is down.

3
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,710
Don't you see he's hurt?

4
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,800
- Did you see that?
- That hurts.

5
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,010
Every Shark fan has a sickening
feeling in his stomach.

6
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,680
Let's look at this again.

7
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,190
Cap Rooney is down and in pain.

8
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,490
Get me Vincent.

9
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,740
Riggman makes a beautiful move
over Julian Washington.

10
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,570
Which frees up Watson up the middle.
Look at Gates on the back side.

11
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,080
Who's on weak side safety?

12
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,200
Stop showing that.

13
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,660
We'll return with Cap's condition
after a word from our sponsors.

14
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,670
- They cut to a commercial.
- I think I broke my back!

15
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,880
My butt!

16
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,880
Damn it! Fuck!

17
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,090
- Where's it hurt?
- Where you're touching it!

18
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,590
Candy-ass, no-blocking bitches!

19
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,300
Suck it up, Cap.

20
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,350
Can't breathe.

21
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,100
Neither can I.
It's the humidity.

22
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,890
Should we get a stretcher?

23
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,140
Do I have to get a stretcher?
You that old?

24
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,440
Wait! Wait!

25
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,940
I should, but you just
bled on my suit.

26
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,730
There goes history.
That's the real deal there.

27
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,440
Thirty-nine-year-old Cap Rooney...

28
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,610
...two-time Pantheon Cup winner,
almost 50,000 passing yards...

29
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,900
...now to be replaced
by the second-string quarterback.

30
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,610
All right, nice and easy.
We're up. See? 21-17.

31
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,120
Just hold on. Steady.

32
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,330
Where's my helmet?

33
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,870
Get him his helmet.
You'll need that, Tyler.

34
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,870
I'm not really sure how D'Amato's
going to get over this one, Kev.

35
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,120
Way to hold that football, kid.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,210
Take it easy. Don't worry.

37
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,210
We're gonna finish this one
without you.

38
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,040
With three losses and three games
until the playoffs...

39
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,590
...this could spell the end
to an already dismal season.

40
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,970
Attendance is down,
while the Dolphins have prospered.

41
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,010
Bad-coaching-dot-com.
That's Tony's web site.

42
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,430
Horny, your zone coverage is soft.
Press it.

43
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,140
Get that out of my face. Shark! We
need more pressure on the quarterback.

44
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,850
- I'm on it, coach.
- Go fix it.

45
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,180
- I said fix it!
- I'm on it, goddamn it!

46
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,020
This'll put the Sharks' playoff hopes
on the shoulders of Julian Washington.

47
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,190
Backup quarterback Tyler Cherubini
has not seen a lot of action.

48
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,020
Cherubini has not thrown
for a first down all season.

49
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,780
Fumble!

50
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,360
Oh, my gosh! Touchdown!

51
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,990
The Americans go up, 23 to 2 1.

52
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,950
Man, oh, man!
Did they nail him!

53
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,990
It doesn't look like
Cherubini's getting up.

54
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,160
Fuck!

55
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,120
Two quarterbacks in a row.
I have not seen this since '88.

56
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,790
Or '78? When the Aztecs
and the Pharaohs lived.

57
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,420
Any given Sunday,
anything can happen.

58
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,420
They need you back.
Cherubini's down.

59
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,920
Did he fall off the bench?
What the hell's next? Stigmata?

60
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,380
Sit him out and don't touch him
till I get back.

61
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,300
Give me the names of players
in the quarterback market.

62
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,180
How about every available line coach?

63
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,010
Somebody who can teach this line
how to fucking block.

64
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,510
Malloy. Find out about him.

65
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,560
Cap's out.
Man, I can't believe it.

66
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,770
Do you know Willie Beamen?

67
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,480
No, I don't.
Who is Willie Beamen?

68
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,190
Beamen! What are you doing?

69
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,190
- I told you to warm up 5 minutes ago!
- What happened?

70
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,360
Look at your fucking play card!
It's upside down!

71
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,280
Get your head out of your ass!

72
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,910
Beamen, you're up.
Left Deuce Zig 22 Tomcat.

73
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,750
You know what that is?
Easy handoff to Julian.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,920
The Americans got no profile on you.
You surprise them.

75
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,420
Look at me!

76
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,630
You're gonna do fine.
You hold it all inside. There.

77
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,960
Stay focused.

78
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,590
Okay? Stay there.

79
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,010
Willie, can you hear me?

80
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,840
As we await word
on Cap's condition...

81
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,140
...Miami is sending in third-string
quarterback Willie Beamen.

82
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,590
I've been in too many of these.

83
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,140
Twenty-six years old, a mystery man.
7th-round pick out of Dallas.

84
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,270
In his fifth year. He went
to the University of Houston.

85
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,930
First year with the Sharks.

86
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,810
All right, listen up. We're gonna
run Left Deuce Zig 22 Tomcat.

87
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,190
What's the snap count?

88
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,440
Beamen, make the call!

89
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,860
You all right?

90
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,200
That's a first.

91
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,830
Fuck! You puked on the logo!

92
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,120
I got to get in a 3-point stance
in your vomit, nigger?

93
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,700
Set on two. On two. Ready?

94
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,120
Look at me.
I'll be the next to knock you up.

95
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,670
Buckle up! It's gonna be
a long day today.

96
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,840
Set!

97
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,760
66! Hike! Hike!

98
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,560
Get used to that! I'll be picking
peanuts out of your ass!

99
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,150
- First down!
- 378! Hut! Hike!

100
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,040
Change the play. Audible.
Change the play!

101
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,250
Check it! Check it!
Red 70 Blackstar!

102
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,380
Red 70 Blackstar!

103
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,040
Where'd you dream that up, rook?

104
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,250
- Red what?
- What the fuck is that?

105
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,170
Looks like an audible.
Looks like a broken play.

106
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,050
Goddamn it!

107
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,930
Does he know any of these plays?

108
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,180
The guy knows the basic package,
but he's only taken a few snaps.

109
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,310
What's a Red 70 Blackstar?
There is no such fucking play!

110
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
I just figured that out, J.

111
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,060
But there should be one.

112
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,150
It's the future of the team.

113
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,940
Blue 88! Blue 88!

114
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,860
Unless you gonna kiss me,
get your hand off my ass!

115
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,410
That's what your girl told me
last night!

116
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,120
Hurry! Hurry up!

117
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,620
He's letting it go!

118
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,210
Interception!

119
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,670
Intercepted by Gates!

120
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,340
This kid's been moving too fast.

121
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,220
He's way ahead of his receiver.
He's nervous.

122
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,890
And it's Minnesota 24
and Miami 21 at the half.

123
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,020
Try an enema.
What do I give a shit?

124
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,310
When this corner's coming up
I want you to drop back.

125
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,860
We got a third-string quarterback
that won't produce shit.

126
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,610
When I'm talking about defense,
you're dumb enough, we made it simple.

127
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,360
We made this shit real fucking simple.

128
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,780
101. You lightheaded?

129
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,990
I was lightheaded at kickoff. Now I'm
one-foot-in-the-fucking-coffin stage.

130
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,700
A couple quarts low.
You need an oil change, Madman.

131
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,290
Then why are my legs
one big fucking knot?

132
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,160
I need some Vicodin.
I need some cyclobenzaprine--!

133
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,370
Put that on your nose.
Harvey, could I speak to you?

134
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,670
Cap's losing ankle strength.

135
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,460
You examined him?

136
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,790
Ollie, you're one of the few
relatives I can stomach...

137
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,840
...but you're the internist.
I'm the orthopedist, remember?

138
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,010
Bone, muscle, joint, me.
Runny nose, diarrhea, pinkeye, you.

139
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,220
Got it? Thanks.

140
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,590
Bad news, Cap. You're okay.
It's just a bruise.

141
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,760
No ribs broken.
Your back film's normal.

142
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,470
Something is definitely wrong here.
My butt is killing me!

143
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,350
I'll send you over for an MRI.

144
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,930
Doc, pull the pipes, man!

145
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,480
Doc, I got to go, man!
Call of the wild!

146
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,230
- Out of my way!
- Sharks football : Whatever it takes!

147
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,240
Place-kicker, out of the way!

148
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm taking a dump, unless you want
to be in a shitstorm!

149
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,240
Don't bend your elbows.

150
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,370
Whatever. Do what you gotta do!

151
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,700
Sit down! Listen up!

152
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,080
Who are you throwing to? The receiver?
Or you got some other shit on your mind?

153
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,090
We just lost two goddamn quarterbacks...

154
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,170
...in one half of football...

155
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,920
...because our line...

156
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,340
...couldn't pick up a backside bandit
on max protection!

157
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,090
All week long we work on the calls.

158
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,510
Over, over, over again!

159
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,390
You are not fucking focused!!

160
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,260
McKenna, what are you doing?!

161
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,430
Keep your head on a swivel!
Slide out there! Pick up that robber!

162
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Roll up those outside linebackers!

163
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,980
Know your site adjustments.
Understand?

164
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,770
Sanderson and Fox
will break off their routes...

165
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,320
...but you gotta be there and deliver.
Two turnovers in one half!

166
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,660
Defense!
This is what we gotta do here.

167
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,620
I don't know.
You gotta do something out there.

168
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,700
You gotta make it happen.

169
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,660
You gotta stop flying around the ball!
Tackle somebody!

170
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,460
Don't let these guys
chew up the clock on us.

171
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,120
When we put eight in a box,
you gotta jam those receivers!

172
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,710
If you make mistakes, make them big.
I won't eat your lunch for that.

173
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,170
Here we got P.J.,
Mac, Beastman, Horny, Shark.

174
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,130
One-two yards less each time...

175
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,720
...they'll be looking at second and 8,
instead of second and 6.

176
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,260
We're only down by 3.
We can win this.

177
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,970
We got three losses in a row!

178
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm sick and tired of this.
Are you?

179
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,100
Because if you're not,
raise your hand. Come on.

180
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,860
If you're going to act like a loser,
raise your hand.

181
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,980
If you're going to act like pussy,
raise your hand!

182
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,650
What are you doing, J?

183
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,190
I didn't want you to be the only pussy
with his hand raised, coach.

184
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,450
Gentlemen!

185
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,530
This is where we live!

186
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,040
We're not gonna let them
fuck with us in our house, are we?

187
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,960
Let's go out there and kick some
second-half butt!

188
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,110
We got a dance planned for you.
Payback's a bitch!

189
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,530
Motherfucker!

190
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,320
I'll fucking kill you, son of a bitch!

191
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,200
Get this guy under control!

192
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,450
Settle him down!

193
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,320
Slot Left 90 Go Z Read.

194
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,410
Here we go.
Settle down, settle down.

195
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,580
Shit!

196
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,130
We got it back. We got it back.

197
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,090
Time-out, time-out.

198
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,840
It looks like back surgery...

199
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,180
...but I'm told he may be back
by playoffs.

200
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,640
What's wrong?

201
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,640
What's wrong?

202
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,800
It's just moving so fast.

203
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,100
Believe me when I tell you this.

204
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,180
You can only get better.

205
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,980
And you don't have to worry about
getting the hook...

206
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,020
...because I got no one left.

207
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,810
I'm playing like shit.
I ain't playing like myself.

208
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,730
You know how to play.
You played this game your whole life.

209
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,360
You know what I'm saying?

210
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,480
You grew up in Dallas, right?

211
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,490
So maybe you're back in Dallas
right now.

212
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,280
You're home, you're enjoying yourself.

213
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,320
You're back in the 'hood just before
your mama calls you in for dinner.

214
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:20,540
I say, " Go to the Buick.
Turn around, I'll throw it to you. "

215
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,000
- Remember that?
- Something like that.

216
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,500
What I'm saying is,
you gotta forget it all.

217
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,080
The crowd, the audibles,
the goddamn playbook.

218
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,040
Just focus on this next one pass.

219
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,840
Go to the Buick. Turn around.

220
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,670
Turn around.

221
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,170
Enjoy it.
That's what you're here for.

222
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,720
Slot. Throw it.

223
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,980
Forget the whole goddamn playbook.

224
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,070
Just focus on this one next pass.

225
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,620
He's got it! He's got it!

226
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,170
Touchdown, Sanderson!

227
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,550
And what a feeling it must be
for young Willie Beamen.

228
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,340
It's his first AFFA touchdown.

229
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,880
The Sharks are back in the ball game.

230
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,720
Let's kick some extra point.
Let's get off the field.

231
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,810
Where did we find this guy, Johnny?

232
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,230
I think Arnie spotted him
before he left.

233
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:36,330
D'Amato's gotta go for it. If he gets
first down, he can run out the clock.

234
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,290
- What's with these plays?
- I can't get in his face.

235
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,620
Tell him he's gotta take a chance.

236
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,960
- I'm doing my best.
- Turn up the volume!

237
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,540
Red Beats Read.

238
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,710
They're giving us the flat.

239
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,000
- Let's run smoke and throw.
- They're looking for the pick.

240
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,750
I'm not taking any chances,
not with this ballerina.

241
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,800
Third down and five.

242
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,100
They're screaming for him to dump it.

243
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,640
It's wide open.

244
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,100
I know this coach. He's a prick.

245
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,900
This is a setup. I've seen this.
We'll run it again.

246
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,230
Let's do it!

247
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Let's do Deuce Left 22....

248
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,150
Run the same play?!

249
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,200
All the Sharks have to do
is hold on to the ball.

250
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,820
It's money time! Give me five!
We home and dry and flying high.

251
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,030
Let the D win it, J-man.
We don't need no first down.

252
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,200
That's why you don't score
with the ladies!

253
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,910
Same play. Same play.

254
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,040
On two!

255
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,500
Call time-out. They're stacked up
against the run.

256
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,620
Time-out's for TV. Negative.

257
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,180
Fumble!

258
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,260
He fumbled!

259
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,390
Loose ball! Minnesota's got it.

260
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,480
How stupid! How selfish!

261
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,940
Julian Washington fumbles the ball!

262
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,440
In your face!

263
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,190
You wonder if the million-dollar
bonus when he reaches 1500 yards...

264
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,940
...didn't play into that one.

265
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,740
That's right, Kev. And now D'Amato's
lost four games in a row.

266
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,530
Two hands!

267
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,700
With two hands, you showboat!

268
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,950
Honey, please don't feel too bad.

269
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,290
We lost once.

270
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,250
All of a sudden...

271
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,790
...one of these real tall gentlemen...

272
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,790
...jumped up so high...

273
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,830
...and he just picked that thing
out of that air just like that.

274
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,920
And I thought your daddy....

275
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,590
I thought he'd have a heart attack.

276
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,050
He died because of this.

277
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,470
I don't want you to take anything
so seriously, honey.

278
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,430
- It's just a game, honey.
- Good night, Mother.

279
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,060
- Good night, darling.
- At least the dog still loves her.

280
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,430
Make sure she gets home, all right?

281
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,890
No stops.

282
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Shall I wait up?

283
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,150
No, I'd be a lousy date tonight.

284
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,190
Don't forget I'm in Boston tomorrow
for 2 or 3 days.

285
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,310
It's a complicated deposition.

286
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,980
I'm sorry. I forgot.

287
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,200
Kick their asses.

288
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,610
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

289
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,780
Make it three.

290
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,700
You want a walk-through?

291
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,790
Let it go, Willie.
You played strong.

292
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,410
I'm just sick of losing.

293
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,500
When you're my age,
you get used to it.

294
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,830
All right, everybody, listen up!

295
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,050
Played your hearts out there today.

296
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,920
No blame, nobody.

297
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,510
Let's take a knee. Father.

298
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,430
You and I have been in some tough
places together, haven't we?

299
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,520
I went to my playbook.

300
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,850
And the book says the rain falls
on the just and the unjust alike.

301
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,400
Now, we just lost four in a row.

302
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,320
That doesn't mean
that we're specially cursed.

303
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,530
Joy comes in the morning.

304
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,860
There are no atheists in foxholes.

305
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,990
Let's pray.

306
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,830
" Our Father, who art in Heaven...."

307
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,580
- How you doing, Rock?
- I felt like I was gonna die.

308
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,590
They went in and they sucked out...

309
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,710
...my L-5 disk.

310
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,760
It's no big deal.

311
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,130
- Did we win?
- They beat us by three.

312
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,510
What'd the kid throw?

313
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,300
Nine of 14 for 176.

314
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,100
TDs?

315
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,600
Two.

316
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,180
Holy moly!

317
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,890
I can beat this.

318
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,440
Cindy, will you please call that nurse?!

319
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,810
This doesn't work! I'm a football
player! They gotta pump up the volume!

320
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,940
Breathe.

321
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,570
Don't overachieve.

322
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,400
Even at 50%%% , nobody's better.

323
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,070
Playoffs...

324
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,900
...I'll be ready.

325
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:05,070
It's getting late. I'm gonna stop by
in the morning. You get some rest.

326
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,280
- Good night, Cindy.
- Good night.

327
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,950
Don't you give up on me.

328
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,460
You're like a son to me, Cap.

329
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,330
I'll fight for you till the day I die.

330
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,670
Willie Beamen, I don't believe you.

331
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,680
Your first big game on TV,
and you didn't let your own mama know!

332
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,550
Here it is right here.

333
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,100
Not that Willie didn't have some
nauseating moments of his own.

334
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,850
Poor guy!

335
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,980
Are you gonna start?
You could at least play first-string.

336
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,350
No, probably not.

337
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,310
Let's hope Willie Beamen
brings his Tums with him.

338
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,900
- You should be starting.
- Mom, I'm number three.

339
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,400
There ain't nothing
I can do about it.

340
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,280
You've been at this for 5 years!

341
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,400
Tell everybody I said I love them,
and I'll see them.

342
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,150
- I love you too, Willie.
- I love you.

343
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,490
Baby, she just wants the best for you.

344
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,990
Yeah, I know she does.

345
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,620
You did great!

346
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,220
You gotta wonder why D'Amato
would call that play...

347
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,260
...when J-man likes to pick his spot
when he runs.

348
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,930
Calling the same play twice?
What's that about?

349
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,220
There's a reason this team's
lost four games in a row.

350
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,930
Forget about the offensive line.

351
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,730
And forget about Cap Rooney.

352
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,810
Forget about the money-grubbing
Christina Pagniacci.

353
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,890
Hello, genius!

354
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,650
This guy started coaching
in the late '60s, for God's sake!

355
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm glad he's not talking about me.

356
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,520
- Here you go, coach.
- Thank you.

357
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,990
This is a team with more than 200
variations on the pass!

358
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,570
Napoleon D'Amato's playbook's
got less than 75 plays, total!

359
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,570
200 variations on a pass!
What's wrong with this picture?

360
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,120
You're that coach, right?

361
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,700
I'm Mandy. Mandy Murphy.

362
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,250
You look better in real life.
You're always yelling at people on TV.

363
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,080
At least I look better
than that old fart up there, no?

364
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,420
I think.

365
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,260
You do.

366
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,800
- How old are you?
- I don't think age matters.

367
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,680
I think older guys have a certain thing.

368
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,050
I've wanted to meet you since I was 16.

369
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,350
You were on the sidelines.
You were winning this big game.

370
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,890
The Pantheon Cup, yeah.

371
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,850
That was it.
God, that's so wild!

372
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
So you promise to keep a secret?

373
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,110
I don't know. How do you mean?
On a date?

374
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,490
I got a place.

375
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,660
It's close by. It's quiet.

376
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,450
It's a thousand.

377
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,280
Five thousand for the night.
You won't regret it.

378
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,660
I'm flattered, thank you, but....

379
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,460
I got friends.
I could do your friends too.

380
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,170
- Some other time maybe.
- Fair enough.

381
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,210
Good luck.
I'll be rooting for you.

382
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,670
- Thank you.
- Coach.

383
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,510
I know you're not gonna
pass on that, D'Amato.

384
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,340
I must be drunk.

385
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,390
--Christina Pagniacci,
who's so smart...

386
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,220
...she sold three of last year's
starters in the off-season.

387
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,850
You think you can lose
your coaching instincts?

388
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,430
You never had them.
How you gonna lose them?

389
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:15,440
All I got are my instincts.
I lose those, I got nothing.

390
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,490
Please leave your name and message
and we'll get right back to you.

391
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,160
Have a nice day. Bye-bye.

392
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,710
So, Jeanette....

393
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,370
I was hoping you'd be awake.

394
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,460
What time is it out there, anyway?

395
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,710
Never mind.

396
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,380
Could you tell Tommy that I'll be
in L.A. in a couple of weeks?

397
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,050
We got a game.

398
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,050
I'd like to get together with him...

399
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,300
...but I don't have his new number.

400
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,930
I really miss the shit out of
little Timmy and Melinda.

401
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,470
And you.

402
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,850
Grandkids.

403
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,150
We got grandkids.

404
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,730
Why did we get divorced anyway?

405
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,570
Fuck!

406
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,860
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

407
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,700
Shit!

408
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,040
We're gonna make a difference
this week!

409
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,790
Just the tip of the ball. Catch it!

410
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,460
This ain't no bullshit West Virginia.
You in the big leagues!

411
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,590
What the fuck is that? What are you,
a pussy? That ain't no damn hit.

412
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,470
- 14 years, I know how to hit.
- 14 years, you're captain.

413
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,600
Show me!

414
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,850
Break that shit up!

415
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,520
Goddamn it, baby! You did it!

416
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,730
That's my boy, my brotherfucker!

417
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,560
That's the way to hit it, Shark.
That is the way to hit it.

418
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,400
Now, come on in here.

419
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,650
Let me get this straight.

420
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,900
The California governor says there's
nothing for the public to vote on?

421
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,700
She's got the finances to build
a new stadium in Los Angeles...

422
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,030
...using lottery money.

423
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,820
Jeez, Ed!

424
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,160
L.A.'s a dream.

425
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:53,250
Certainly good enough to leverage the
city of Miami into a new stadium.

426
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,540
What about the Rosenthal bid?

427
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,370
$250 million?

428
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,130
It's so low.

429
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,500
With a new stadium and a winning team...

430
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
...this club is worth $800 million.

431
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,800
It's me!

432
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,590
You're like your dad.
You're a dreamer.

433
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
Take the money!

434
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,760
You're still young, darling.
Start over. Start a family.

435
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,890
You don't love football anyway.

436
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,930
It's none of your business, Ed.

437
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,270
Let's keep this between the three of us.

438
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,100
- Morning, Tony.
- Morning, Christina.

439
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,940
Alka-Seltzer?

440
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,940
No, thank you.
I had about four for breakfast.

441
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,990
This is a hell of a loss, Tony.

442
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:50,570
I can see how my mom could drink herself
into a stupor watching football games.

443
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:54,700
But this kind of play makes me
want to jump out of a window.

444
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,540
Well, you can run this a billion times,
but on any given Sunday--

445
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,710
" You'll either win or you'll lose.

446
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,330
The point is, can you win or lose
like a man? " Dad said lots of things.

447
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,880
Actually, I said that.

448
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,250
But he could never stand losing.

449
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,210
And Julian couldn't resist
going for his bonus yards.

450
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,050
Blame me, not Julian.
That was my call.

451
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,970
I know it was, Tony.

452
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,880
It's four in a row.

453
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,510
This season is a disaster.

454
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,300
Without the playoffs,
there's no more TV money.

455
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,890
You see this?

456
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,350
They want your head.

457
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,390
Your father would laugh at them.
This is a good team.

458
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,970
We hit, we win.

459
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,060
We put pressure, we win.

460
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:40,560
We penetrate, we win. You do it as
tough as it is possible to do!

461
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,440
And you do that in all things.

462
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,520
You die hard.

463
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,480
That's what I'm talking about.
You die hard.

464
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,230
Dad used to say:

465
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,240
" No intensity, no victory. "

466
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,860
Where the hell is your intensity,
Tony?

467
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,490
Four years ago,
we won the Pantheon Cup!

468
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,700
- I was there, remember?
- Now what are we?

469
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,040
We're a second-tier team, that's what.

470
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,160
Admit it! You're not being honest!

471
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,920
We're a solid football team.
We're just not inspired.

472
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,210
Too many free agents.
We got Julian. He's a merc.

473
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,590
End of the season, he's gone.

474
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,170
Next year, we rebuild our running game.

475
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,050
You talk about a running game, but
who cares as long as you're winning?

476
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,470
People want to see passes, touchdowns.

477
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,970
High scores. That's the game today.

478
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,140
I paid a lot of money
to get Nick Crozier here...

479
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,350
...specifically to modernize--

480
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,270
Football's played on a field,
not in the goddamn boxes.

481
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,440
You knew that when you had candy
stuck in your braces.

482
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,230
If we had gotten the linemen I wanted...

483
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,480
...our first two quarterbacks
would still be walking.

484
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,150
Think of the future.

485
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,110
Do you know what we could get for Cap?

486
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,690
Probably a second
and a third-draft choice.

487
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,950
We know that he's finished but--

488
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,740
I don't know that Cap is finished.

489
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,910
Do I have to remind you
that he helped build this franchise?

490
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,490
He's a hero to the working people
of Florida!

491
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,330
Probably one of the greatest pressure
players of all time.

492
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,710
You can't cut Cap--

493
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,500
Cap and Shark were great,
but memories--

494
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,420
Shark changed linebacking forever!

495
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,170
He made a quantum leap in the game!

496
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,550
That's why we'll say goodbye
to both of them...

497
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,880
...with dignity, with class.

498
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,300
I won't cut Cap or Shark no matter
how much class you do it with.

499
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,140
My contract's very clear on this point.

500
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,640
I coach my way.

501
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,140
We make less money
than 90%%% of the other teams!

502
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,180
- The economics--
- Fuck the economics!

503
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:51,600
Your father, you hear me? Your father
didn't interfere! He made it work!

504
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,850
That's because you were a fighter.

505
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,060
You had intensity.

506
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,520
As much as I respect...

507
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,730
...my famous Uncle Tony...

508
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,570
...the players are just not
responding to you.

509
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,660
Art, may he rest in peace,
spent money like water.

510
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,870
But in the modern game
with the marketing costs--

511
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,950
Listen, I will do anything to bring
this team back to greatness.

512
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,380
I guess I had nothing to do with that.
That was all your dad.

513
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,380
Am I excused now?

514
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,550
Jeez, who's playing the child now?

515
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,090
Everybody's got to renegotiate,
and that means you too.

516
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:52,100
Are you saying my contract's up
at the end of the season?

517
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,930
The economics aren't there,
that what you're saying?

518
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,100
You know, you're not giving me
a whole lot to work with.

519
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,650
You know how your dad and I negotiated
my contract? We had a beer.

520
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,480
We shook hands.

521
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
Well, I don't drink beer, Tony.

522
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,780
I don't imagine you do, no.

523
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,610
Fucking beer?!

524
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,790
Fourteen to three, Chicago.
Second quarter.

525
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,790
Eight minutes left.

526
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,380
Oh, man! Bad, bad pass.

527
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,340
This has been a tough start
for Tyler Cherubini...

528
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,380
...who has yet to find his rhythm.

529
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,850
Tyler, we're in Miami.

530
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,890
You're throwing the ball to Georgia.
It's not clicking.

531
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,100
The offense isn't clicking.

532
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,350
- Rest it up.
- I can get it done.

533
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,890
I know you can. Not now.

534
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,190
What's going on?
Stop these sons of bitches!

535
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,310
Suck it up!

536
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,030
B.J., I'm gonna kick your ass!

537
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,820
Then I'll kick that million-dollar
bonus baby's ass!

538
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,280
Then I'll go in the stands
and kick both your mama's asses!

539
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,160
- Fumble. We got the ball.
- It's ours.

540
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,460
Get Beamen.

541
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,300
You feel like throwing up?

542
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,670
Last time you puked,
you had a hell of a game.

543
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,090
Make a ritual out of it,
people will respect you.

544
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,180
We'll go at them.
We're going with the script.

545
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
Focus.

546
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,810
Concentration.

547
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,470
Downfield, downfield.
Every inch. Every inch.

548
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,310
You see it before you do it.
You see it, you do it.

549
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,150
Why'd you take so long?
This one's about to slip away.

550
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,900
Then go ahead. Let's go!

551
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,860
Make me a believer!

552
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,610
14-3, Chicago, second quarter,
3 minutes left.

553
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,110
Set!

554
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,990
Green 68! Hike!

555
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,330
Beamen's got the ball,
with room to run. Look at him go!

556
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,630
He's carrying it
like a loaf of bread.

557
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,340
This kid can move.
He's got some flexibility.

558
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,960
He's got genius ankles.

559
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,590
Look at him go!

560
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,090
That's what we need.

561
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,600
- A 57-yard carry by Willie Beamen.
- What the fuck is he doing?

562
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,220
Will somebody teach this kid
how to slide? He'll kill himself!

563
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,020
I don't need another Julian out there.

564
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,350
I understand.

565
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,860
There goes breakfast.

566
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,280
He seemed confused.
What's he confused about?

567
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,870
What's 60 Bravo?

568
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,240
Red Draw, Regular Group.

569
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:51,620
That was your play. Twins Right
3 Zig 88, throw ball on one. Ready?

570
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,290
Beamen walks to the line of scrimmage.
Three minutes left, 14-3 Chicago.

571
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,880
Green 68! Hike!

572
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,050
Touchdown, Miami!

573
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,140
I don't know what he's doing.
I didn't call that play.

574
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,190
- My touchdown!
- It was yours, it was yours.

575
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,070
What the hell was that?

576
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,860
- It was a bootleg.
- I know it was a goddamn bootleg!

577
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,490
I'm glad there's no microphone
down there.

578
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,660
I wouldn't want to be
on D'Amato's dark side.

579
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,410
I didn't call that play.
I called a Regular 22 Fox.

580
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,450
You know what that is, son?

581
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,750
Yeah, I know what that is.

582
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,330
You run the plays I call.

583
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,170
You with me, son?

584
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,790
Yeah, I'm with you, boss.

585
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,250
I'm with you.

586
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,220
Green 68!

587
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,320
Sharks first and goal at the 8.

588
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,030
We'll see what the offense puts
together against this Rhino defense.

589
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,490
What the hell--?

590
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:03,080
Crozier, what's he doing?

591
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,080
I don't know what he's doing.

592
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,170
Watch 55!

593
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,130
Set!

594
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,550
Black 33, hike!

595
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,710
Beamen back to pass,
the rush is on.

596
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,130
Got good protection.
He's rolling out right in a bootleg.

597
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,890
He pulls it down!
There's room to run!

598
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,060
He's got some daylight.
He's going for it!

599
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,020
It looks like they got him!

600
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,990
Yes! What the hell was that?!

601
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,650
Holy mackerel! That is football!

602
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:09,080
If I'm Tony D'Amato right now,
I'm praying to the football gods:

603
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,830
" What did I ever do to deserve this? "

604
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,580
" A new breed of athlete...

605
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,460
...and man.

606
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,590
The future.

607
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:30,170
Welcome to the 21st century. "

608
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,560
Sharks, baby!

609
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,350
- What's the name of my team?!
- Sharks!

610
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,230
Why didn't you kick?

611
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,230
You should've kicked!

612
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:04,110
Cap, you gonna be ready for playoffs?

613
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,530
I've always been a quick healer.
I'll be there.

614
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,530
- You should've kicked.
- I'll be back. I just saw somebody....

615
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,830
It gives me great pleasure
to present D.A. R. E...

616
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,080
...with this $250,000 contribution.

617
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,130
The city of Miami thanks you,
Christina Pagniacci.

618
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,260
You are a great Miamian.

619
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,920
You've done as much as anyone...

620
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,470
...to eliminate drugs and crime
from our city streets.

621
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,390
And your Sharks have provided
wonderful role models...

622
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,310
...for our inner-city youth
to look up to. And I'm all for it!

623
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,680
And now...

624
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,190
...let's get down and party!

625
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,450
Where is that bold and beautiful
quarterback of yours?

626
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,330
Say hello to His Honor.

627
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,080
- Good to see you, sir.
- Show me some love.

628
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,290
Absolutely.

629
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,620
You know my wife, Cindy?

630
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,710
- It's so nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

631
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,710
I mean the other quarterback.
You know, the black dude?

632
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,800
- Who?
- He means Willie.

633
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,630
Of course, of course.

634
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,220
Dexamethasone?

635
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,140
And extra-strength hydrocodeine.

636
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,720
That mix makes Jimmy crazy.
Can't get it up!

637
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,770
Count your blessings.

638
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,730
Is Willie managing to keep
his food down tonight?

639
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,940
Yeah, he's fine.
I'm Vanessa Struthers.

640
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,650
Jack got such a laugh off that one.

641
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,320
Jimmy had to order new shoes.

642
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,320
I'm Jamie Lasseter.

643
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,150
Heather Sanderson.

644
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,240
Are you and Willie married?

645
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,280
No, but we've been together for six--

646
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:20,320
Doesn't count until you're married...

647
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,990
...or until you get your name
in the paper as " and wife. "

648
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,500
J, did I ever tell you
what this bitch said about me?

649
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,670
Where's your handkerchief?

650
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,670
Bitch says,
" Your sausage ain't right. "

651
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,340
That shit bummed me out, man.
I went to a shrink.

652
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,550
Next time, use a handkerchief.

653
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,430
Motherfuckers might have AIDS!

654
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,430
- Woman beater!
- Let's go, let's go.

655
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,720
Asshole!

656
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,930
Let's get out
before she goes public.

657
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:02,560
Motherfucker!

658
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,890
Fuck you! Fuck you!

659
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,600
Be proud, son.
You are the future of football now.

660
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:12,690
You are a model for your people now,
Willie Beamen.

661
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,560
A black man unafraid.

662
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,190
Stand tall.

663
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,110
Give me some love!

664
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,820
- You pretty cool too, mayor.
- Thank you.

665
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,200
It's great to see you again. Welcome.

666
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
Good to see you too.

667
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,950
- Are you married?
- I'm between marriages.

668
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,870
Between marriages?
What do you do for dick?

669
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,830
Can I be honest with you?

670
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,370
This is a waste of my time.

671
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,840
I come up with the edge we need, the
stats, the probabilities, each week.

672
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,500
I won't waste another season under Tony.

673
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,460
You won't, okay?

674
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,260
I promise.

675
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,390
Your team ain't doing
what the Dolphins are doing.

676
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,930
A new stadium is the last thing
on the city council's mind.

677
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,850
I'm not asking you to vote, T.J.
I'm asking you to deliver.

678
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,100
I want the 250 million you promised me.

679
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,900
I can get the rest with the bond.

680
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,770
Schools are howling for money,
roads need redoing.

681
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,270
If you're not there for us...

682
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,940
...we'd seriously consider
leaving this town.

683
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:29,030
Your lease has two more years,
so don't set fires you can't put out.

684
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,700
There are loopholes.
The stadium's falling apart.

685
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,110
You haven't contributed one penny
to the maintenance on that relic.

686
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,080
Now that's the Pagniacci I believe.
I see your teeth. Get down, girl.

687
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,950
You are a relative babe
in this town. Go slow.

688
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,830
First you get along, then you go along.

689
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,580
Come on, darling.

690
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:53,960
We are a pro team, and we're losing
a ton of fucking money.

691
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,340
" Life begins with a kickoff "...

692
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,170
...Art used to say.

693
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,760
- That's Artie.
- He was football, Margaret.

694
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,380
I know.

695
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:10,140
Now all we have are these...

696
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,720
...know-it-all ESPN analysts.

697
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,890
I've just been knighted.

698
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,770
Come on, Mom. Let's go.

699
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,940
Why do we have to leave?
It's not late.

700
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,480
It's getting there.

701
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,570
I gotta give this back to you.

702
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,530
We gotta do this again!

703
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,530
Let's do it tomorrow night.

704
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,330
I remember when my dad
designed that ring.

705
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:57,370
Guess I'll have to wear mine
on a chain around my neck.

706
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,540
You got to win one first.

707
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:01,380
I was only trying to make--

708
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,750
No, just win one.

709
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,090
Good night!

710
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,470
See you later!

711
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,800
I saw you looking at
Heather Sanderson's ass!

712
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,680
Why didn't you introduce her
to the mayor?

713
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:24,850
You damn sure didn't introduce me.

714
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,430
After all these years!

715
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,680
I'm not worried about them!

716
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:31,900
I'm not thinking about the mayor
or them crackhead assholes!

717
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,190
I'm thinking about the game!

718
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,730
What're you saying?
I don't look so good to you anymore?

719
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,320
You know, for a college graduate,
you're plumb dumb.

720
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,820
" Heather said this, Cindy said this!
Willie this and Willie that! "

721
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,070
Fuck!

722
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,860
You come at me
when I'm dealing with this shit?

723
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,740
Get the fuck out.

724
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,410
Get your hands off me.
What's wrong with you?

725
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,410
You gonna hit me now?

726
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,580
You're turning into a shit like
everybody on that team.

727
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,580
- I'm calling your mama!
- You're calling my mama?!

728
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,040
Girl, look. Don't let my success
go to your head, bitch!

729
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,920
Why not find a college motherfucker
you can hang out with?

730
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,630
What you worried about me for?
With that educated ass.

731
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,760
You're right. I am educated!

732
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,760
And your dumb country ass
can't even read a fucking playbook.

733
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:27,640
You can take your football, since
it's the only ball you got anyway...

734
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,640
...and stick it up your ass...

735
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:32,640
...because my beautiful ass
you won't be seeing anymore.

736
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:36,600
I'll be at Darlene's house.
She might fuck better than you, bitch!

737
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,270
- Get your dyke ass out!
- I'm not a dyke!

738
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,480
You got a nasty mouth on you too!

739
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,650
I don't want you around my kids...

740
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,480
...with that goddamn cussing and shit!

741
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:49,030
Fuck you, big-ass bitch!

742
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,330
Mind if I sit down for a minute?

743
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,380
What you listening to?

744
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,090
Rap.

745
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,460
Anyone I know?

746
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,050
Trick Daddy.

747
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,220
- You know him?
- Sure.

748
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,680
You ever listen to jazz?

749
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,810
You know, Coltrane, Monk...

750
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,640
...Miles Davis, Billie Holiday?

751
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,350
I don't get into the old stuff much.

752
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,060
Well, maybe I'll put together
a tape for you.

753
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,310
- My favorites--
- CDs.

754
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,520
These. CDs.

755
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,650
Forget about it then.

756
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,780
How about your mom?
Is she ever gonna come to a game?

757
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,860
Church.

758
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:04,570
She thinks that Sundays is for church.

759
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,290
Maybe you don't know this...

760
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,870
...but I lost my dad
when I was young too.

761
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,370
World War Il.

762
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,800
If you ever want to talk
about that stuff...

763
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,050
...I'm around.

764
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,650
Deuce Right Split 25 Barrel Clear
on one.

765
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,360
I'm coming in fast.
Don't make me wait.

766
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:11,620
On one. Ready?

767
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,580
- What did he say?
- I don't speak Ebonics.

768
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,950
I don't speak Beamen.

769
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,240
- I got the outside backer?
- You got the nose.

770
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,120
Nose. Face.

771
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:27,670
They think that you are a bunch of
lowbrow Neanderthal shitheads!

772
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:33,000
They think they'll gut you and leave
you with your insides hanging out...

773
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:38,510
...so that the goddamn buzzards
can eat your no-playing asses!

774
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,170
You're gonna have a stroke!

775
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,010
I don't get strokes, motherfucker!
I give them!

776
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,800
Fumble! Oh, no!

777
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:50,680
There goes another one from J-man.
Or was it Willie Beamen?

778
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,930
Aw, come on!

779
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,060
Damn it!

780
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,430
- Snake Eyes Right, right?
- I was adjusting!

781
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,020
You didn't adjust shit!

782
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,150
I think McKenna's got a distended knee.
He's out.

783
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,610
He's out for how long?!

784
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,280
If he's lucky, Easter.

785
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,240
You didn't adjust shit!

786
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,240
Knock it off! Knock it off!

787
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:22,160
You realize that that little screwup
just cost us McKenna for the season!

788
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:26,750
Sit down, all of you!
Sit down and shut the fuck up!

789
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,500
They're leaking,
you don't know where. Fix it!

790
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,010
Don't scream, yell,
all that bullshit! Fix it!

791
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,300
What the fuck is wrong with you?

792
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,680
Where'd you find this faggot?

793
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,890
- I had to get that out of my system.
- Don't do it on my shoes.

794
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,430
- On your period, you anorexic fucker?
- Yes, I am.

795
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,520
Right Deuce Dog 90 Smoke on three.

796
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,900
Jimmy, you're one. Ice, you're two.

797
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:11,230
Champagne, you can clear out.
J-man, take the flat.

798
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,860
Don't force it if you don't got it.

799
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,400
I'm a righteous fucker.
On three.

800
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,170
Wow, look at that block!

801
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,260
Perfect throw! Touchdown!

802
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,800
Touchdown pass,
Beamen to Sanderson.

803
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,970
Touchdown, Beamen.
Touchdown, Sharks!

804
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,140
Strong right!

805
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,400
Will you get someone to block 58?

806
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,400
Turn it up!

807
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:26,320
Punting team. Jesus!

808
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,280
Right Deuce Gun, F-shoot 60 Snake Eyes
on three.

809
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:33,160
You run Snake Eyes in the red zone.

810
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,620
Get on my page or shut the fuck up.

811
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,700
On three. Ready?

812
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:10,390
Under incredible pressure,
off his back foot!

813
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,220
Sixty yards! Touchdown!

814
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,600
Playoffs!

815
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:17,770
Playoffs, New York
and home-field advantage.

816
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,390
As the Sharks go into
their bye week...

817
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,400
...the story's gotta be
Willie Beamen.

818
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:23,860
He's running. He's throwing.

819
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,860
He's rocking and rolling,
chucking and jiving.

820
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,610
He's flat-out steaming. This magic
Sunday, he's Steamin' Beamen.

821
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,090
Hell, no.
Not this Nazi rock shit again!

822
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,470
Metallica rules!

823
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,090
Hetfield is God.
We live to serve him.

824
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,220
You should bow down
to the monsters of rock!

825
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,390
That's right, bitch!

826
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:19,010
Can you feel the intensity, baby?!

827
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,100
We did something exceptional today.

828
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:23,810
We were under pressure, and we did it.

829
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:27,100
Come Wednesday,
we got one thing on our minds.

830
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,270
One thing, victory!

831
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,980
We wanna feel this way again,
don't we?

832
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,570
Hey, guys.

833
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,910
- Clark. Great game.
- Appreciate it.

834
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,450
Where's Beamen at?

835
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,240
He's down there.

836
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,950
How's it going?

837
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,500
Hey, Cap.

838
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,370
J.J., great game.
Looking really good out there.

839
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,920
Pete, don't stiffen up on me.

840
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:15,260
Congratulations. You were great.
Really exciting to watch out there.

841
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,470
Well, you know, I thrill to chill.

842
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,850
You can't dance!

843
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,810
Get off the juice,
you'll get a little loose!

844
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,680
Fuck you. Fuck you.
It's like that?

845
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:33,390
I'll be back. I'll be back.

846
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,100
I hope you don't think this is rude.

847
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,360
You know, I don't B.S., Miss Pagnicci.

848
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:42,860
You do it to me.

849
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:48,070
I was wondering if we could go out
for a drink or something, hang.

850
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,450
- I'm flattered. Really, I am.
- You should be.

851
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,280
But I've never dated players.
It gives the wrong impression.

852
01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:00,540
I guess you're saying you're
influenced by what other people think.

853
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,870
I think we all are, in business.

854
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:05,870
And it's...

855
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,040
..." Pagniacci. "

856
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,920
Eat this, you fucking pussies!

857
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,720
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry!

858
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,300
Reebok's got this ad campaign...

859
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:32,390
...ready to go the moment I hit
2000 yards. But it's ABC, man.

860
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,730
I don't get the ball, I don't get
my stats, I don't get my money.

861
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,890
This team isn't about your damn stats.

862
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,690
That's a winning attitude, J.

863
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:43,270
How much you paying that
300-pound blocker?

864
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:45,190
Let him block.

865
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,400
Because he sure can't run like I can.

866
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,980
J-man's got a point.

867
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:50,400
Beamen ain't doing his homework.

868
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:53,190
He won't read the playbook,
he won't come see the films.

869
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,740
He doesn't even know the names
of the defense he's facing.

870
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,610
He don't give
a gee-whiz about anybody.

871
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,620
He just wants
to make the plays himself.

872
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,660
He's young, Cap.
He doesn't know how to read like you.

873
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:08,540
What do you mean, he's young?
Come on! He just does what he likes.

874
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:13,250
He's changing the plays in the huddle.
Plays that you designed, that I love.

875
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:17,250
He's dissing this play and dissing
that play. " I got a better play! "

876
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:19,040
Guys, we won.

877
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:20,880
What's the point?

878
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:23,340
I'm trying to get paid!
That's the point!

879
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:26,710
The point is, if we don't win,
you can't do your commercials.

880
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,920
What do you know?
You're an offensive coordinator!

881
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,720
Jesus Christ.

882
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,890
Keep your mouth shut.

883
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:37,930
Get this shit straight, coach.
I'm with you, man.

884
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,470
It's all right, J.

885
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,520
Anything else?

886
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,640
Hey, guess what?

887
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,650
Coach suddenly invited me
over for dinner.

888
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:53,060
Or orders me, more like.

889
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,320
That means you made it, boy.

890
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,230
The coach thinks you're the real deal,
invites you to his house...

891
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,320
...makes the worst jambalaya.

892
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:03,570
Better bring some flowers.

893
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,910
Coach gets really pissed off
if you don't bring flowers.

894
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,280
Flowers?

895
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:10,660
Trust me, man.

896
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:11,870
When?

897
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,200
Saturday.

898
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,790
That's tight, man.
Got a gig over at my house.

899
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,540
Going to be a lot of trim.

900
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,420
Don't bring no sand to the beach.

901
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:25,380
Come on, I'm a born-again ladies' man.

902
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,630
I bet you were born again, baby.

903
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:34,800
With a team, hotshot, you can try
to lead them, but will anyone follow?

904
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:39,010
You go out there on your own,
you're gonna die a very lonely death.

905
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,510
You feeling me?

906
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,180
Say, Cap, how old are you again?

907
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,980
We got a problem.
There's something wrong with Shark.

908
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:54,690
Brilliant. Did you
go to medical school for that?

909
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:57,770
His eye-hand coordination's
deteriorating.

910
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:02,020
He's fucked up. The crazier they are,
the more the crowd likes it.

911
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:04,940
This isn't pro wrestling.
He needs an MRI.

912
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:09,990
You gonna order a $20,000 workup
for every nutcase on this team?

913
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,700
Could have a subdural hematoma,
intracranial bleeding.

914
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:15,410
Or he could just be
a crazy fucker, okay?

915
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,160
They walk on that field every Sunday.

916
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:21,120
They got only one thing going for them:
their confidence.

917
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,330
You chip away at that
with a bunch of unnecessary testing...

918
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,660
...and we can kiss
the playoffs goodbye.

919
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:29,210
Are you saying
I can't do the tests on Shark?

920
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,830
Jesus Christ!

921
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,750
I'll take care of it.

922
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,380
I have earned their trust.
You haven't. Good night.

923
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,260
Hey, baby.

924
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,090
- What's the matter?
- Who's Courtney?

925
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,930
I don't know who Courtney is.
Why are you starting your shit?

926
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:53,680
What's it like to be a nobody one day
and have the world know you the next?

927
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,970
I was always a star.
Y'all just didn't know about it.

928
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,520
It ain't the whole world.

929
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,390
Two billion people in China
ain't never heard of the game.

930
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,520
Sharks are in the water.

931
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,200
The busboy, Steamin' Beamen.
What you think?

932
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,990
It's all to the good.

933
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,740
Let's get out of here.
This studio time ain't cheap.

934
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,640
Take over.
I'll be doing this every day.

935
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:20,690
Gotta get to work

936
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,400
That's right

937
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,280
You know my name

938
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:28,740
My name is Willie

939
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:29,820
Willie Beamen

940
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:31,240
I keep the ladies

941
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:32,620
Creamin'

942
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:35,160
- And all my fans
- Got 'em screamin'

943
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,330
- Think you can defeat me?
- You're dreamin'

944
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,210
Get set, motherfucker.

945
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,290
Then we can get in the gym.

946
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,130
Give generously
to Child Find of America.

947
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:54,710
And let's make every kid
feel like a superstar.

948
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,510
You should have fought for
that " superstar " line.

949
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:05,100
" Giving. " " Team sport. "

950
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,810
Those are the lines.

951
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:12,180
Meanwhile, honey,
you used to do this spot alone.

952
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:15,980
Finished?

953
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,900
Take care of Julian for me?

954
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,400
I know this guy.

955
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,110
He's a top plastic surgeon.

956
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:35,240
I think I could get him
to see you tonight.

957
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,080
Oh, motherfucker!

958
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,800
Inflate your chest. Get MET-Rx.

959
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:16,220
Yo, Rocky.

960
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:19,180
Enough. You're gonna hurt yourself.

961
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,230
Kid's breathing down my neck.

962
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,440
Jack, he's not even close.

963
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,020
You're the man.

964
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:35,110
- Less on the ball, Willie.
- What?

965
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,530
You want a cool, tight spiral.
Don't pat the ball.

966
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,200
It was tight as a frog's ass.
I'm the man.

967
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:43,700
You're the man. I repeat, don't
pat the ball. What'd he say?

968
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:46,160
I said, " I'm as tight as fish pussy. "

969
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,290
I need an interpreter.

970
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,410
Okay, Cap. Sit down.

971
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:54,960
I'm fine. Fine.

972
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,500
You got the balls.

973
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,830
Come on, just get some rest.
Let's go.

974
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:04,050
Bottom line, Rooney is like
some kind of medical miracle.

975
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,420
He really could be ready for New York.

976
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:08,340
Have you told anyone?

977
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,840
I've been on for 12 years
and two rings.

978
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:14,680
Give me a break. I played hurt before.
It's no big deal.

979
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:18,600
He's so freaked about Beamen taking his
job, he'd play with a fractured neck.

980
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:21,260
Could you slow him down?

981
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,770
Tell him he's not responding
to rehab well enough.

982
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:26,350
Let's give Beamen a shot.

983
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,770
We're going with Willie
against New York.

984
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,310
Rest up till the playoffs.

985
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,150
The Emperors don't mean enough for you
to risk everything.

986
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,980
Home-field advantage.
That don't mean anything?

987
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,280
Everyone knows
herniated discs are iffy.

988
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:44,070
This is how it starts, huh?

989
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:48,570
I know what you're talking about.
I know how your mind works.

990
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:51,160
" Rest up. "
" Let the kid take a few games. "

991
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,830
" You were great, but time marches on. "

992
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:55,200
- That's not what I'm saying.
- The heck you're not.

993
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:57,120
I know the game of football.

994
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,370
- What about Shark?
- He's woozy still.

995
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:03,620
He's got bad migraines,
postconcussive syndrome.

996
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:06,540
Don't get a hard-on. Don't move.

997
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:07,830
Can you clear him?

998
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,170
He's had 3 concussions in 5 months.

999
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,590
There's no way to predict what
another head hit would do.

1000
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:19,590
I don't think anything'll happen,
but I'm not a complete prick.

1001
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,300
I do have a conscience.

1002
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,840
I'm not trying to screw him, Harvey...

1003
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:25,720
...but I'd like him in the playoffs.

1004
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,930
Long-term, what are you thinking?

1005
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,140
What am I thinking?

1006
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,060
Bottom line?

1007
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,100
We'll cut him in the off-season.

1008
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,810
The word's out.
Everyone's seen him take the hits.

1009
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:45,150
Nobody's gonna sign a
two-million-dollar concussion case.

1010
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:49,110
He'll be happy to have his job back
at 30%%% of what he makes.

1011
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:51,150
That's if we want him back.

1012
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,240
He's got four kids, Christina.

1013
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,740
You do the math, doctor.

1014
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,870
What you help save us now,
we won't forget at contract time.

1015
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,500
What do I tell Tony?

1016
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,960
Tell him what he needs to know.

1017
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,540
Shark can play. Cap can't.

1018
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:20,550
--in these high beautiful heels.

1019
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:25,260
- You know what you need?
- A pump.

1020
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:29,430
You need to be...

1021
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:31,220
...young again!

1022
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,060
You got me!

1023
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:41,140
I like going downfield.
That's my game. I open it wide open.

1024
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:45,310
The fans want it. Old-timers
don't dig it, like Coach Stone Age.

1025
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,650
I beg your pardon? " Coach Stone Age "?
Is that what you just said?

1026
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,610
It's up and it's good, baby!

1027
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:54,150
That's a name I give him.
I don't mean disrespect.

1028
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,440
Tell me about your past.
Where did you start?

1029
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:00,110
In Houston, but the coach didn't dig
having a black quarterback.

1030
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,740
I guess he felt our brains
was no bigger than the tip of his--

1031
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,740
And then I went to San Diego.

1032
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:08,620
Coach made me cornerback
because he felt I had quick feet.

1033
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:11,290
No, wait. Leave him on. He's cool.

1034
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,250
" Cool "?

1035
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:16,250
Thinks he's Joe Montana already.

1036
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,830
They didn't know what I was.

1037
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:22,920
I mean, he doesn't buy into the
bullshit, you know? I like his eyes.

1038
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,670
Life ain't fair.
And fair ain't what I'm here for.

1039
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:28,960
He's sure of himself.
It makes him sexy.

1040
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,590
I'm glad I'm old.

1041
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,050
Check all right?

1042
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:38,640
I'm not surprised. Rookie thinks he's
hot shit and all-pro all of a sudden.

1043
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,810
Did you feed the dogs?

1044
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,140
- Put the kids to bed.
- Can't we afford a maid?

1045
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:45,680
Why'd I get married?

1046
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:50,850
Are you saying black people
are being dissed in this league?

1047
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:54,480
I see what you're doing.
You're doing that media spin.

1048
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:57,980
Let's talk about the facts.
70%%% of the league is African-American.

1049
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:01,280
- How many black coaches do you have?
- Very few.

1050
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,280
- How many black owners?
- None.

1051
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:04,400
Zero.

1052
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:09,490
At what point does the " Uncle Tom "
feel come into it? Not my language--!

1053
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:12,030
It is because we didn't speak it
when we got here.

1054
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,240
But " Coach Stone Age "...?

1055
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,290
Your smack is so fresh, so on time
and truthful. Give me a pound, dog.

1056
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:22,660
- Share the love.
- I'll pass on the love.

1057
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
You get it started, okay?

1058
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:30,880
- Hope you like cream in your coffee.
- Yes, I do.

1059
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:34,670
Mandy...

1060
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,170
...I like you.

1061
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:40,010
I'm wondering,
maybe we could make this...

1062
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,840
...you know, a more regular thing.

1063
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:46,050
Yeah, I got a few clients like that.

1064
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,180
We could book a regular time.
I'll give you my number--

1065
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:52,310
No, I sort of meant--
Not like that.

1066
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,520
Without the money.

1067
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,060
- I know, but--
- No, you don't want to do this.

1068
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:05,690
I really like you.

1069
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,650
I like you too.

1070
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,940
Tony, you don't want to do this.

1071
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:17,910
Call me.

1072
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:30,330
You got pretty hair.

1073
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,600
- Got you flowers.
- These for me?

1074
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,970
- Thank you.
- Carnations.

1075
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:01,430
I'll put them in water or something.
Come on in.

1076
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:03,520
Want a beer?

1077
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:04,730
Yeah.

1078
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:07,560
Sharky motherfucker.

1079
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,360
Nice spot.

1080
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,570
Yeah, isn't it?

1081
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,320
The gladiators of their time.

1082
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,950
That's what it's all about.

1083
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,700
I don't cook so well,
but you gotta try this jambalaya.

1084
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,200
- Ready?
- I'm always ready.

1085
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,330
It was my recipe. Sort of.

1086
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,370
How do you like it?

1087
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:39,080
It's...hot.

1088
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,250
Let's talk about some basics.

1089
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,500
You getting ready to yell at me?

1090
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,590
Cap going down was tough on me.

1091
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,970
I realize you're learning the system.
Pressure must be incredible.

1092
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:56,840
- I can handle it.
- I know you can.

1093
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,510
If the playbook is too complicated,
we simplify it.

1094
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,720
Playbook's too slow.

1095
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,560
When I'm on the field,
I gotta feel it, gotta let it out.

1096
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:07,310
That why you've been changing the plays?

1097
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,930
I'm just trying to read the defense.

1098
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:12,640
I'm not talking about audibles.
Talking about in the huddle.

1099
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:16,770
When you change plays,
you show disrespect to people.

1100
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:20,320
People who have worked years
in this club.

1101
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,570
People who've sacrificed more than
you'll ever know to be in this game.

1102
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,150
I'm trying to win, coach!

1103
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:30,860
I ain't trying to disrespect nobody.
Winning is the only thing I respect.

1104
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:32,990
Listen very carefully.

1105
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:37,540
One day you'll realize this is
the truest thing you ever heard.

1106
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:39,790
This game....

1107
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:47,120
This game has got to be
about more than winning.

1108
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,000
You're part of something.

1109
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:53,500
Lombardi, Tittle, Sammy Baugh, Unitas.

1110
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,760
Those men on the wall.
You're part of that now.

1111
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,880
I want you to cherish it
because when it's gone...

1112
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:03,050
...it's gone forever.

1113
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:07,390
When I look at them pictures
and trophies, it just makes me sad.

1114
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,180
It's like a room full of ghosts.

1115
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,520
When I'm done with this game...

1116
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:17,230
...I don't want to be no ghost.
I wanna be more than that.

1117
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:26,730
Looks like Cap's gonna make it
back in time for the playoffs.

1118
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,820
- What?
- I'm gonna start him.

1119
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:35,150
I knew you were gonna sell me out.

1120
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,280
Cap's a leader. He's a team player.

1121
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:41,280
That's such bullshit!
He ain't half the athlete I am.

1122
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:45,160
You look me in the eye and tell me
that Cap is a better player.

1123
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:46,540
Cap's a better player.

1124
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:50,330
I guess somebody else
won them last two games.

1125
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,710
He lost four in a row!
I lead by doing.

1126
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,080
You kicked ass.

1127
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:56,960
But Cap Rooney has been doing it
for years.

1128
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,670
And his time is over.

1129
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,460
And yours is too,
unless you take some risk!

1130
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:03,590
Play this game the way
it's played today.

1131
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,840
It's not about
the pictures on the wall!

1132
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:08,800
I've lived this game
for three decades, kid!

1133
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:10,010
I know football.

1134
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,640
- Those men on the wall--
- They wanted to win.

1135
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,220
Just like you do.

1136
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:19,970
You can feed the press that whole
sacrifice and glory-of-the-game crap.

1137
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:21,310
But I been there.

1138
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,230
I seen a long line of coaches...

1139
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:27,150
...with that same old bullshit
halftime speech.

1140
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,150
- Bullshit?
- Yes, it's bullshit.

1141
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:32,520
You know it's bullshit
because it's about the money.

1142
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:35,730
The TV contracts,
fat-cat boosters in the skyboxes.

1143
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,360
Coaches trying to up their salaries.

1144
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:41,030
You looking for the next black stud
to take it to the top 10.

1145
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,910
Get you in a bowl game.

1146
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,570
It's the same way in the pros.

1147
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:51,700
Except in the pros,
the field hands get paid.

1148
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:54,080
Don't play that race card on me, kid.

1149
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:56,370
25 years I work with men
of your color.

1150
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:59,170
Maybe it's not racism.
Maybe it's placism.

1151
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,460
Brother has to know his place.
Right, boss?

1152
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:04,130
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1153
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:07,460
You don't trust anybody
because of what happened in college?

1154
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:10,800
You knew the rules.
You were the one that broke them.

1155
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:13,260
- How did I break them?
- How?

1156
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:16,550
I lost a million-dollar
signing bonus...

1157
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,050
...because I took a $300 suit
from a booster to go to a wedding.

1158
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:24,810
What's a brother supposed to do
in college? He ain't got money.

1159
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,520
He wants to go out on a date.
Wants to get some nice clothes.

1160
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:30,980
Everybody had their hands out...

1161
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:32,980
...but it was me they suspended.

1162
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:36,020
I dropped six rounds in the draft
because of that.

1163
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:40,230
The coaches labeled me: " He's trouble.
He don't wanna play ball. "

1164
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,690
You talk about sacrifice.

1165
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:46,070
I sacrificed $ 10 million because dumb
rednecks like the coach in San Diego...

1166
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,150
...made me a cornerback
because I got quick feet.

1167
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,360
He separated my shoulder tackling
250-pound motherfuckers.

1168
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:52,570
I don't do that!

1169
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:55,910
I was a great football player.

1170
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:00,500
But nobody let my shoulder heal,
and they traded me out of there.

1171
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:03,620
You go ahead.
Blame everybody but yourself.

1172
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:04,750
Whatever.

1173
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,750
Because that's what a leader's about.
Sacrifice.

1174
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,750
The times he's gotta sacrifice
because he's gotta lead by example.

1175
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,130
Not by fear and not by self-pity.

1176
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:18,380
Who you think you're talking to?

1177
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:21,630
Half my career is over
and you want me on the bench...

1178
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,050
...to sacrifice for the glory
of Cap Rooney? Fuck you!

1179
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:27,010
I ain't buying your brand.

1180
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:30,310
Just because you some scared old man.

1181
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,890
You feel like if I play my way,
I just might win.

1182
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,430
Then what was your life about anyway?

1183
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,690
You're not some flash-in-the-pan
corner or receiver...

1184
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:45,980
...or even Julian Washington.
You're a goddamn quarterback!

1185
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:48,980
You know what that means?!

1186
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:52,440
It's the top spot, kid.

1187
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:54,400
It's the guy takes the fall.

1188
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:58,910
It's the guy everybody's looking at
first, the leader of a team.

1189
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,570
Who will support you
when they understand you.

1190
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:05,290
Who will break their ribs and their
noses and their necks for you...

1191
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:09,700
...because they believe.
Because you make them believe.

1192
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,710
That's a quarterback.

1193
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:23,050
I'm the leader of your team...

1194
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,170
...till Cap's back up.

1195
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,090
Then I'm back on the bench.

1196
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:31,840
You ain't said two words to me
till Cherubini went down.

1197
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:35,140
Then it was, " Go out there and...

1198
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,850
...play like you're in the 'hood.
You're throwing the ball...

1199
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,890
...and your mama's
ringing the dinner bell. "

1200
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:46,190
All you do is talk at me, man.

1201
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:49,600
I'm gonna stay who I am.
Steamin' Willie Beamen.

1202
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:53,940
With the time I got left,
I'll play my way. Get my dollars up.

1203
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:58,110
So when you go to waive me, trade me
or whatever the fuck y'all do...

1204
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,070
...I'll be worth 10 times what
I was worth before I got here.

1205
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,320
You're very, very young.

1206
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,580
And you're very, very stupid.

1207
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,790
What're you doing? Get off the lawn!

1208
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,380
It's Mr. Beamen. Willie, how you doing?

1209
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:43,050
It's about winning. That's what this
country's about. Being number one.

1210
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,270
This whole country was built
on kicking immigrant ass.

1211
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,430
African ass, Chinese ass.

1212
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,930
Don't matter who ass.

1213
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:54,390
Get the fuck out!

1214
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:57,770
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

1215
01:22:58,230 --> 01:22:59,770
Every kid can grow up
to be President, right?

1216
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:02,730
Who the hell want to grow up
and be vice president?

1217
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:05,190
There ain't no number twos
in football.

1218
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,320
Homeboy! Welcome to the pit!

1219
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:11,030
You come to my house,
you bring me no flowers?

1220
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,240
You played me.

1221
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:16,070
Blowjobs upstairs. If you want
the skin, trawl the beach.

1222
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:18,910
Don't mess the sheets.
My wife's back on Tuesday.

1223
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,790
- I won't spill a drop.
- Hey, no semen, no blood.

1224
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:24,410
Goddamn!

1225
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:29,170
You tell me.
Who lost the Pantheon Cup last year?

1226
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:32,210
Who came in second
at the 100-yard dash in the Olympics?

1227
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:35,750
Where I'm from, either you're
number one, or you ain't sh--!

1228
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,250
That's a fact.

1229
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,010
Did you get
the Vince Lombardi speech?

1230
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,010
He was in my face
like we lost the game.

1231
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:47,470
I got out of Dallas because
I worked harder than anybody else.

1232
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:52,220
You make it and get the big car,
or you don't and catch the bus...

1233
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:55,470
...and you in the funeral home,
because to me, losing is dying.

1234
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:57,850
" Losing is dying ".
I am down with that!

1235
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:01,350
I think we'd be top dog
if the defense would step up.

1236
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,020
Lay off the D, man. Shark hear you
saying that, he'll kick your ass.

1237
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:08,650
Like I give a fuck.
I'm trying to win some games.

1238
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:11,150
I ain't trying to kiss
no overrated loser's ass.

1239
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:14,110
What you care about?
You playing for yourself.

1240
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,070
What you talking about, punk?

1241
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,700
You gotta earn the right
to diss somebody on this team.

1242
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:21,280
You call this a team?

1243
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:24,240
I see a bunch of super-fly
brothers running around...

1244
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:26,160
...living in the white man's world...

1245
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:28,080
...getting their dicks sucked by ho's.

1246
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:31,210
J, you were a great football player.

1247
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:33,290
Now you done turn into a joke.

1248
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,580
You're playing,
but you're dying inside.

1249
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:37,830
What the fuck you mean,
I'm dying inside?

1250
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,880
Kiss my Armani ass! Know what I did for
this team? I'll take your life, man!

1251
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:45,510
Football is a corporation.

1252
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:49,170
Black kids are raised
to be stars, individuals.

1253
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,510
They do not learn to work together.

1254
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,090
- Beamen's talking shit about you.
- What?!

1255
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:58,890
Talking about how we'd be on top
if the defense would do their job.

1256
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,720
Fucking kidding me!

1257
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:04,480
Motherfucker! I'll break a piece
off in his goddamn ass!

1258
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:34,910
What the fuck is wrong with you,
motherfucker?!

1259
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:38,370
In football, you have
the offense and the defense.

1260
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:40,410
You can't have one without the other.

1261
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:41,710
Respect will be paid!

1262
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:44,750
Somebody call you a cab.
Get out of my house!

1263
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,540
But isn't this an awesome New York
pass rush coming at you?

1264
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:50,670
When you're out there,
is the fear in the belly?

1265
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,010
The fear and the terror.
No, I don't feel none of that.

1266
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:59,010
They won't touch me. They won't
feel me. They won't even smell me.

1267
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:02,470
I don't care if it's the T-Rex
or the Terminator chasing me.

1268
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,600
I got this invisible juice.
Once I turn it on, I'm gone.

1269
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:23,860
Stay down, motherfucker.

1270
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:27,900
Beamen is sacked again.
He goes down hard.

1271
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:32,450
They won't play for him, Tony.

1272
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:36,820
Let him fucking learn, then!

1273
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:44,250
Welcome back
to the Monsoon Bowl, folks.

1274
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:47,210
The Emperors have been eating
Shark patties all night long.

1275
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:50,460
Smash-mouth football.
This is what it's all about.

1276
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,130
Halfback up the middle.
Lavay steps up to fill the gap...

1277
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,050
...misses the tackle.

1278
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,510
The Emperors block their way
into the end zone. It's a touchdown.

1279
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,090
Good job, offense! Way to play!

1280
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:14,100
Just about everything that can
go wrong has here today.

1281
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,520
Murphy's Law in effect
for Tony D'Amato.

1282
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,230
Can I get some fucking protection?!

1283
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:21,600
If you're not blocking,
get the fuck out the way!

1284
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:23,850
Loudmouth showboat motherfucker!

1285
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:26,440
Where's your steam now, Willie?

1286
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,650
You fuckers wanna make it tough?!

1287
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:31,820
I can take that shit.

1288
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:35,780
Come contract time,
there'll be a whole bunch of changes!

1289
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:37,150
Just give us the play.

1290
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,410
It'll be you or me.
And it ain't gonna be me.

1291
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:08,420
And there goes home-field advantage
for the Sharks.

1292
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:12,340
Although their season ends on a low
note, there's still life after death.

1293
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:14,430
Look for them in the playoffs...

1294
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:18,600
...in Tough Town, U. S.A. :
Dallas, Texas.

1295
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,390
There goes that black dynasty
you promised me, darling.

1296
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:33,610
What's the matter?
Forgot your invisible juice?

1297
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:49,740
Stop this now!

1298
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,750
Thirty years in football...

1299
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:08,590
...I never seen something
stinks like this!

1300
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:13,960
Today out there...

1301
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:16,670
...you embarrassed yourselves.

1302
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:18,510
Today...

1303
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,260
...I'm ashamed to be your coach.

1304
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,890
Lucky for him, some of these Sharks
still have teeth left in their head.

1305
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:37,480
Tell you the truth,
they remind me of my ex.

1306
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:40,190
I don't know what more I can do.

1307
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:44,860
Doesn't make sense,
my not having a home. A life.

1308
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,820
Game's all that matters to me.

1309
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,450
Because it's pure.

1310
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:55,820
Four quarters.
You cross a line, you score.

1311
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,250
It's sane. Life isn't.

1312
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:07,080
Life is fucked.

1313
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:10,920
It's a new world, Tony.

1314
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:15,630
In my day, we used to just be happy
to get the goddamn job.

1315
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:18,750
I used to shovel liquor
in the off-season.

1316
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,590
You know, sell used cars, insurance.

1317
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:24,670
Some of the guys used to even wrestle.

1318
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,050
But, shit, now, prima dogs.

1319
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:33,600
Bodies that are year-round great,
but crack just like china.

1320
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:35,350
It's TV.

1321
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:37,720
Changed everything.

1322
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:40,270
Changed the way we think forever.

1323
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:43,100
I mean, the first time
they stopped the game...

1324
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:46,560
...to cut away to a fucking commercial,
that was the end of it.

1325
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:49,940
Because it was our concentration
that mattered, not theirs.

1326
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:53,980
Not some fruitcake selling cereal.

1327
01:30:56,070 --> 01:31:00,780
Who wants to think about blitzes
when you're holding your grandkids?

1328
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:05,620
You gonna miss your friend
screaming in your face...

1329
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:08,830
...embarrassing you
in front of your players?

1330
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:12,620
That's why I wanna coach high school.

1331
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:15,330
Get back to the basics.

1332
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:19,080
Kids don't know nothing.
They just wanna play.

1333
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:22,170
Like you said, Tony...

1334
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:24,800
...it's pure.

1335
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:52,770
So what are the odds?

1336
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,690
Well, there's no telling.

1337
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,690
It's an odontoid fracture.

1338
01:31:57,190 --> 01:32:01,740
Basically, Luther, you broke your neck,
and it never healed correctly.

1339
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:05,450
It's hard to predict
this kind of thing...

1340
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:09,950
...but what I can say is
that the wrong kind of hit...

1341
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:13,660
...could result
in paralysis, seizures...

1342
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:16,490
...even sudden death.

1343
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:20,120
What else is new?

1344
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:21,410
In my opinion...

1345
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:23,790
...he is not medically fit to play.

1346
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,170
I need one sack
and three more tackles...

1347
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:29,590
...and I get my bonus. Then we'll talk.
Okay, motherfucker?

1348
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:32,090
Come on, Luther.

1349
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:35,550
Have you ever seen
an old punch-drunk boxer...

1350
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,050
...stumbling around drooling...

1351
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,760
...with no memory of
what he's done in his life?

1352
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:44,220
You want that life, Luther?

1353
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:50,060
You need me against Texas, don't you?

1354
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:51,270
Don't you?

1355
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:54,480
Of course I need you against Texas,
but not...

1356
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,770
...not at this price, no.

1357
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,730
For a million dollars, I will shake
like a coconut on a tree if I got to.

1358
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:06,610
Coach, I gave you 13 years.
You can give me one.

1359
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:10,530
Football's my life, coach.
It's my life.

1360
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:14,280
It's all I know how to do.

1361
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:16,320
Please, man.

1362
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:19,490
Come on, coach, please.

1363
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:30,420
You have to sign a waiver, Shark.

1364
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:34,580
Bring it on, man. Bring it on.

1365
01:33:36,170 --> 01:33:37,250
Coach.

1366
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,670
We need to have
a discussion about Harvey.

1367
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:46,090
Where the hell's D'Amato?

1368
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:53,390
Don't you ever say that
your papa didn't believe in you.

1369
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,220
Don't believe what your mom says.

1370
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,520
You evil motherfucker!
Come over here.

1371
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,180
Shark's film.

1372
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:03,890
I know what you did, asshole!

1373
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:07,520
You switched the results
so Powers wouldn't pick up on it.

1374
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:09,480
Princess, I'll call you right back.

1375
01:34:09,690 --> 01:34:12,230
Granted, it could look that way
to a layperson.

1376
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:13,570
I want you out of here!

1377
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:15,030
You're taking the high road?

1378
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:18,240
You didn't consult with him!
He could get killed out there!

1379
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:19,610
You didn't consult with him?!

1380
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,740
I'm gonna consult with a player?
I knew his answer!

1381
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:25,910
Getting killed? Maybe, maybe not.
One chance in 1000.

1382
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:27,950
But nobody blitzes
like the Shark, right?

1383
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,790
I never wanna see you near
one of my players again!

1384
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:35,120
They couldn't take a piss
in the morning without their pills!

1385
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:38,460
You're gonna play innocent?
Fuck your innocence!

1386
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:41,040
What about Beyer?
Or Nielstrom and Manzicki?

1387
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,130
Logan and Krause?

1388
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:45,670
I will not have this discussion
with you!

1389
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,880
You don't wanna hear the answer?
Don't ask the question!

1390
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:50,920
And you, you fucking snitch.

1391
01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:53,590
Did you ever think about Shark
putting food on the table?

1392
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:54,720
You lied to him.

1393
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:56,300
You didn't give him a choice.

1394
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,100
- It's a doctor's ethics.
- Since when?

1395
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:01,180
The Hippocratic oath, that's when.

1396
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:03,010
The one that starts, " Do no harm "?

1397
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:07,140
With all due respect, I didn't
have to ask because I knew the answer.

1398
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:10,350
Who am I to tell these men
they cannot live their dream?

1399
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:12,560
They will not live with shame like you.

1400
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:15,230
They are gladiators.
They are warriors!

1401
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,570
And long ago, they made that choice.

1402
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:19,520
Not you! Not you!

1403
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:24,780
Not me. I won't be responsible
for standing between them--

1404
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:31,200
Didn't you ever have...

1405
01:35:32,410 --> 01:35:33,780
...a dream, Ollie?

1406
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:35,620
I'm living it, Harv.

1407
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,250
Oh, fuck it.

1408
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,580
We did win the Pantheon though,
didn't we?

1409
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,170
See you around the old nursing homes.

1410
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:49,710
Courtney, let's go.

1411
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,380
No. I'm gonna stay here.

1412
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:55,010
- What?
- Please.

1413
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:56,260
Perfect. Stay here.

1414
01:35:56,460 --> 01:36:00,630
And get butt-fucked by
twelve Neanderthals. Bitch!

1415
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:05,510
Coach D., what do you say?

1416
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:06,600
Out of my way!

1417
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,260
Well, that's just great.

1418
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,100
That's just fucking great!

1419
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:15,310
Did you get that?

1420
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:28,030
Nobody's gonna hit your pussy-ass.

1421
01:36:28,230 --> 01:36:31,650
I know, man. I just got happy feet.
I'm getting old.

1422
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:44,700
I should just trust that you'll
do the right thing for Willie B.

1423
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:47,080
Is it true you make 10 million a year?

1424
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:48,250
That's right.

1425
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:51,290
It must be true about you
not blocking no more either.

1426
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:57,420
My dad says you won't take passes up
the middle because you might get hurt.

1427
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,300
What's that?

1428
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:25,480
You led, nigger.
But did anybody follow?

1429
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:35,320
Let me tell you something :

1430
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,900
For every sucker who makes it...

1431
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:44,490
...for every Barry Sanders,
for every Jerry Rice...

1432
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,740
...there's a hundred niggers
you never heard of.

1433
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:52,160
Sure. The game's taught you
how to strut...

1434
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:54,870
...how to talk shit, how to hit.

1435
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:56,500
But what else?

1436
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,170
Suddenly, there's no more money...

1437
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:06,210
...no more women, no more applause.

1438
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,090
No more dream.

1439
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:16,180
This is what I'm trying to say to you.

1440
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,260
When a man...

1441
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:24,560
...looks back on his life,
he should be proud of all of it.

1442
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:28,520
Not just the years he spent
in pads and cleats.

1443
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:31,850
Not just memories of...

1444
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:35,690
...when he was great.

1445
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:44,610
You gotta learn that in here.

1446
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:48,820
Or if you don't, you ain't a man,
you're just another punk.

1447
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,880
Who wants mustard on their hot dog?
Johnny?

1448
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,290
- No, just ketchup.
- Just ketchup.

1449
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,960
Ketchup, mustard, mustard....

1450
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:15,670
So doc's cleared you for Sunday?

1451
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:20,760
That's great.

1452
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:25,430
A little help?

1453
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:31,260
Paper's got us at six-point dogs.
Can you believe that?

1454
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:36,140
I can't wait to strap it on and stick
it to Dallas like we used to.

1455
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:40,100
Show them what this game's all about,
right there in the playoffs.

1456
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:42,610
You okay?

1457
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,190
Doc got it wrong about your back?

1458
01:39:46,610 --> 01:39:51,440
It hurts a lot more than I thought.
I think I pushed it too hard.

1459
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:53,950
Don't play hurt.
You just need the needle.

1460
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:56,070
Yeah, I'm sure that's it.

1461
01:39:58,030 --> 01:40:00,120
Maybe you ought to go with Willie.

1462
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,030
Are you seeing your psychiatrist?

1463
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:03,620
No.

1464
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:05,450
Well, are you depressed?

1465
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:08,200
Rock, come on!

1466
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:11,920
You wanted to play. I fought for you.

1467
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:15,670
If something was wrong, you
should've told me. I had four weeks.

1468
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,840
I could've gone another way!

1469
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:19,750
I'm sorry.

1470
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:30,550
I got blank spots in my memory.
It's weird.

1471
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:33,890
And I shake.

1472
01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:38,770
Sometimes I can't even hold a spoon.

1473
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:44,140
And I'm always on painkillers
for my elbow...

1474
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:47,020
...or my rib or my neck!

1475
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:49,940
Now I got this ruptured disc,
and I just....

1476
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:56,320
Even with all that,
I would go back in a second....

1477
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:01,530
But if I go in there, Tony...

1478
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:06,320
...I'm gonna fold.

1479
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:08,950
And I just....

1480
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:14,660
I can't do that.

1481
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:20,670
You know these things you're saying...

1482
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,460
...all in your head, Rock.

1483
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:26,000
They're not real.

1484
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,340
You understand?

1485
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:31,090
You know you got it in you...

1486
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:34,090
...because I know you do.

1487
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:39,260
It's my body, Tony.

1488
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:40,930
It's my body. It's not there.

1489
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:42,800
I wouldn't let you get hurt.

1490
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:45,010
I need you, Rock...

1491
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:48,770
...to lead this team.

1492
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:52,600
Come on.

1493
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:54,770
One more time.

1494
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:57,060
You and me.

1495
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:00,150
You and me, together.

1496
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,610
Trust me.

1497
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:11,820
You need me, Tony, I'll be there.

1498
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:13,570
Thank you.

1499
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:18,330
What I'm saying is...

1500
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:22,870
...I've got my rings,
we took care of our money...

1501
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:26,000
...and the kids are all right.

1502
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:31,130
We had a good run.
I just think that it's time for me...

1503
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:34,630
...to get out after this season.

1504
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:36,670
And do what?

1505
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:40,220
I talked to a guy
at one of the networks--

1506
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,550
You are a football player.

1507
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,800
Will you hear me out?

1508
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:47,800
You're a football player, Jack.

1509
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:52,010
And you have two or three years
left in you.

1510
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:57,060
Cindy, you are missing
the big picture here.

1511
01:42:57,270 --> 01:43:00,310
There is no big picture here, Jack!

1512
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:03,480
You're the goddamn quarterback
for the Miami Sharks!

1513
01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:06,570
You're a legend,
and you're talking about quitting?

1514
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:11,530
All my life everybody's been telling me
what to do, ever since college!

1515
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:14,360
This is not your decision!
It is my decision--!

1516
01:43:15,950 --> 01:43:19,370
I will not listen
to this bullshit from you!

1517
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:21,370
I will not!

1518
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:42,130
Wanna know why?

1519
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:45,050
Because they want you.
You know what I'm saying?

1520
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:46,840
The sky's the limit, baby.

1521
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:49,470
They'll swallow
the beer distributorship.

1522
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:52,510
The funny thing about this
whole situation is...

1523
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,050
...no one knows how good
you really are.

1524
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:58,760
You get in that playoff game,
you score...

1525
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:01,890
...you can forget about this team.
They'll lose anyway.

1526
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:03,730
- I'm bored.
- Can you give me a second?

1527
01:44:03,930 --> 01:44:07,270
You'll get five million
serious dollars from somebody.

1528
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,650
I'm gonna tell you something else.

1529
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:12,900
Christina wants to give you $2 million
to extend you for the year.

1530
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:14,860
But we're gonna wait.

1531
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:18,860
That's what you hired me for,
to watch your back.

1532
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:20,240
You follow me?

1533
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:22,450
I hope you're doing that, Wayne.

1534
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:25,740
Just in case I ain't made out of steel.

1535
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,620
I'm saying, what if
my arm starts hurting?

1536
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:30,490
Where you coming from with that?

1537
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:33,620
Baby, ain't nothing
gonna fall apart on you.

1538
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,040
Vanessa!

1539
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:37,120
" Vanessa "?

1540
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:39,920
Excuse me.

1541
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:41,750
Hey, that's Willie Beamen!

1542
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:49,420
How you been? Long time.

1543
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:51,630
Congratulations.

1544
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:55,510
- Things are cool.
- Getting what you wanted?

1545
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,430
I blew it, V.

1546
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,600
Everything was just happening so fast,
I didn't have time to think.

1547
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:05,930
I was thinking maybe we could go out,
we could just get together.

1548
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,930
I don't think so, Willie. I'm sorry.

1549
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,310
I understand. Or do I?

1550
01:45:13,810 --> 01:45:15,480
You're just too volatile for me.

1551
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:17,980
I'm a simple girl.
I like simple things.

1552
01:45:18,190 --> 01:45:21,980
Truth be told, I didn't even
like football. I liked you.

1553
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:23,480
I'm sorry.

1554
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:25,860
- I understand--
- Willie, no!

1555
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:40,950
- Get out of here!
- I need to talk to you.

1556
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:42,870
Oh, my goodness, Barbara Bush.

1557
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:45,870
- Where you been all my life?
- I'm sorry.

1558
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,420
You're looking good too!

1559
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,880
There's that smile
I've been looking for.

1560
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:55,000
Listen to me. I just need to know
that I can call you.

1561
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:59,710
Tell me that I can call you,
or I'll never talk to you again.

1562
01:46:00,010 --> 01:46:01,920
You're so full of shit.

1563
01:46:02,130 --> 01:46:04,550
No, I'm not. I'm very serious.

1564
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,180
Don't test me.

1565
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:11,010
You can call me as long as
you get out of here! Now go!

1566
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:12,470
Get out of here!

1567
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:14,850
- You too shy?
- No, I'm not shy!

1568
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:16,600
I got a date out there.

1569
01:46:16,810 --> 01:46:19,520
You're talking about
the mortician out there?

1570
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:22,440
You're just jealous because he's tall.

1571
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:24,860
But he can't ball.

1572
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:27,980
I'll holler.

1573
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:33,110
Congratulations.

1574
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:35,360
Was I the last to know?

1575
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:37,240
Cindy Rooney told me.

1576
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:40,030
What the hell are you doing
starting Cap?

1577
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:43,160
Throwing him against the best
pass rush in the league?

1578
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:44,410
Cap's my starter.

1579
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:46,910
- If we lose this game--
- I'll do you one better.

1580
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,160
In the off-season, I'm trading Willie.

1581
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:50,910
That's not your option.

1582
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:55,830
Your kid may sell a lot of T-shirts,
but he is tearing this team apart!

1583
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,250
- Then hold it together!
- I can't! Not with him.

1584
01:46:58,460 --> 01:46:59,380
Where are you going?

1585
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:02,250
You will start Willie on Sunday...

1586
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:04,880
...and you'll make the adjustment
to modern times.

1587
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:06,760
You don't tell me what to do.

1588
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:08,550
Nobody tells me what to do!

1589
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:12,510
Your father never told me what to do!
You're not gonna start!

1590
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:15,970
I'd cut my father's ass
if we were losing like this.

1591
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:19,930
You know, I'm really getting
sick and tired of you.

1592
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:22,430
Your father was no genius.

1593
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:24,890
He only acted like he was one.

1594
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:28,390
And he took credit for a lot of things
he never did!

1595
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,770
He at least respected me.

1596
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:34,110
Would you stop using my father
as a scapegoat?

1597
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:38,940
I can't even imagine what he'd think
of you right now...

1598
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:43,030
...but my hunch is, he'd be ashamed.
He'd be ashamed!

1599
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:47,110
Why do you think he put me in charge,
you bullheaded moron?

1600
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:50,660
He could've made you general manager,
but he didn't, did he?

1601
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:52,410
You know why?

1602
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:56,660
Because he knew you didn't have the guts
to do it after he was gone!

1603
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:08,710
It's true, Tony.
He couldn't trust you.

1604
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:10,920
You got old.

1605
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:45,980
I'll be in my father's office.

1606
01:48:53,410 --> 01:48:56,820
- Christina will destroy this team.
- What is it you fear?

1607
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:01,330
You've got so much fear
inside of you, Tony.

1608
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:05,790
I'm losing the team, Maggie.

1609
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,500
I'm losing control.

1610
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:12,790
Everything in my life's about control.

1611
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,210
I lead men.

1612
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:16,630
I control.

1613
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,670
Did Art think I was past it?

1614
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:24,550
I don't know.

1615
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:27,720
Do you care?

1616
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:30,930
You never understood Artie,
did you?

1617
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:34,260
He wanted a son...

1618
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,060
...more than anything else
in the world.

1619
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:42,730
And when you really think about it,
what Christina is...

1620
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:45,230
...it's just such a tragedy.

1621
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:50,400
You know, she will sell the team.

1622
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:53,780
And everything her father
stood for is gonna die.

1623
01:49:56,610 --> 01:50:00,740
And what will you do, Tony,
after football...

1624
01:50:01,530 --> 01:50:04,240
...with nobody to control?

1625
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:06,910
Stop it. What are you doing?

1626
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:10,540
Hey, I blame you for a lot of things.

1627
01:50:12,290 --> 01:50:15,120
You were like Artie.

1628
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,670
A monster.

1629
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
You've gotten older. Better.

1630
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:28,090
But for a long time I hated you.

1631
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:34,140
That game took my husband,
my daughter...

1632
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:36,010
...my youth.

1633
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:37,600
Left me with what?

1634
01:50:38,430 --> 01:50:42,100
All those Sunday afternoons
at the stadium.

1635
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:45,140
And time...

1636
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:49,520
...just kept slipping away, didn't it?

1637
01:50:59,690 --> 01:51:01,070
How's your head, Jack?

1638
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:05,910
Sandy, it's nice of you to ask.
It's still hurting, quite frankly.

1639
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,200
Like you guys, I play hurt.

1640
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:11,700
Look at the monitor, you'll see
it was more than aggression.

1641
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:14,080
Out of my way!

1642
01:51:14,870 --> 01:51:16,830
Well, that's just great.

1643
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:41,720
There goes D'Amato, his 14th
consecutive game with a touchdown!

1644
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:46,850
We regret to inform you that your
husband, Lieutenant Louis D'Amato...

1645
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:49,890
...was killed in the European
theater of operations.

1646
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:52,930
And to your son, Anthony D'Amato...

1647
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:55,600
...our deepest regrets.

1648
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:54,600
Controversy swirls around
the six-point Shark underdogs.

1649
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:59,430
Willie " Steamin' " Beamen,
the sensational quarterback...

1650
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:02,690
...who's held the Sharks together,
is not starting.

1651
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:06,190
He's said to be feuding
with his beleaguered coach...

1652
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,730
...who's being investigated
for hitting Jack Rose...

1653
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:11,940
...earlier this week at practice.

1654
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:17,450
I'd say that's
a bit of an exaggeration.

1655
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:19,450
- A mild shove.
- We'll find out later.

1656
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:22,410
I'm the best yard receiver
that's ever lived.

1657
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:24,700
I can catch anything.

1658
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:28,450
I'm the best receiver
that's ever lived.

1659
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:30,870
That's right.

1660
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:34,210
Meanwhile, Tug,
immortal but vulnerable Cap Rooney...

1661
01:53:34,410 --> 01:53:37,420
...only six weeks off
a microdiskectomy--

1662
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:42,590
--will start against
the league's toughest pass rush.

1663
01:53:42,790 --> 01:53:44,380
- " Toughest "?
- The toughest.

1664
01:53:44,590 --> 01:53:48,050
Get ready for the sparks to fly.
We'll be right back.

1665
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:53,720
" The tension of the season
got to me...

1666
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:57,640
...and I overreacted to an innocent
question from a journalist...

1667
01:53:57,890 --> 01:53:59,970
...we all know to be
of the highest caliber.

1668
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:04,470
I only hope that one day I'll truly
be able to show Jack Rose...

1669
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:07,810
...just how much I treasure
his invaluable contribution...

1670
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:09,890
...to the sport of football. "

1671
01:54:11,730 --> 01:54:13,020
Thank you.

1672
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:17,360
Where's your wheelchair?

1673
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,480
Hello, commissioner.

1674
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:23,900
God, I hate Texas.

1675
01:54:28,530 --> 01:54:30,200
How are the headaches?

1676
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:32,530
Fine, till you start doing that shit.

1677
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:34,660
Your balance?

1678
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:36,620
My check balance?

1679
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:39,450
Looking P-H-A-T, baby. Phat.

1680
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:42,160
Go on, get out of here.
You're done.

1681
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:45,290
How about another shot, doc?

1682
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:48,750
You don't need it.
It doesn't make any sense...

1683
01:54:49,170 --> 01:54:50,090
...medically.

1684
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:54,880
Don't give a shit about medical, doc.
Give me some of that cortisone shit.

1685
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,090
Please?

1686
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:17,310
The surviving team will move on
next week to Minnesota...

1687
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,810
...cold country for the
AFFA conference championship.

1688
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:24,610
In the meantime,
we're back to another dang commercial.

1689
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:31,780
I don't know what to say, really.

1690
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:35,320
Three minutes...

1691
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:39,530
...till the biggest battle
of our professional lives.

1692
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:42,410
All comes down to today.

1693
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:48,460
Either we heal as a team...

1694
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:51,420
...or we're gonna crumble.

1695
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:56,960
Inch by inch, play by play,
till we're finished.

1696
01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:59,590
We're in hell right now, gentlemen.

1697
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:01,170
Believe me.

1698
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:07,050
And we can stay here,
get the shit kicked out of us...

1699
01:56:08,930 --> 01:56:12,800
...or we can fight our way
back into the light.

1700
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:15,640
We can climb out of hell...

1701
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:19,390
...one inch at a time.

1702
01:56:21,730 --> 01:56:24,270
Now, I can't do it for you.

1703
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:25,730
I'm too old.

1704
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:32,230
I look around, I see these
young faces, and I think...

1705
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:38,280
...I made every wrong choice
a middle-aged man can make.

1706
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:45,450
I pissed away all my money,
believe it or not.

1707
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:50,240
I chased off anyone
who's ever loved me.

1708
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:57,040
And lately, I can't even stand
the face I see in the mirror.

1709
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:05,920
You know, when you get old in life,
things get taken from you.

1710
01:57:06,130 --> 01:57:08,210
I mean, that's part of life.

1711
01:57:09,130 --> 01:57:12,630
But you only learn that
when you start losing stuff.

1712
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:17,220
You find out life's this game
of inches.

1713
01:57:18,350 --> 01:57:19,890
So is football.

1714
01:57:20,810 --> 01:57:24,390
Because in either game,
life or football...

1715
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:27,600
...the margin for error is so small...

1716
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:32,850
...one-half a step too late or early,
and you don't quite make it.

1717
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:36,860
One half-second too slow, too fast,
you don't quite catch it.

1718
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:41,530
The inches we need are
everywhere around us.

1719
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:46,950
They're in every break of the game,
every minute, every second.

1720
01:57:49,570 --> 01:57:52,740
On this team, we fight for that inch.

1721
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:55,790
On this team, we tear ourselves...

1722
01:57:55,990 --> 01:58:00,620
...and everyone else around us,
to pieces for that inch.

1723
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:04,170
We claw with our fingernails
for that inch...

1724
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:08,790
...because we know when we add up
all those inches...

1725
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:14,800
...that's gonna make the fucking
difference between winning and losing!

1726
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:18,840
Between living and dying!

1727
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,890
I'll tell you this. In any fight...

1728
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:28,180
...it's the guy who's willing to die
who's gonna win that inch.

1729
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:31,470
And I know if I'm gonna have
any life anymore...

1730
01:58:31,770 --> 01:58:35,640
...it's because I'm still willing
to fight and die for that inch.

1731
01:58:37,730 --> 01:58:40,690
Because that's what living is!

1732
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:43,110
The six inches in front of your face!

1733
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,610
Now, I can't make you do it!

1734
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:49,110
You gotta look at the guy
next to you!

1735
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:51,190
Look into his eyes!

1736
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:55,160
I think you're gonna see a guy
who'll go that inch with you!

1737
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:57,530
You're gonna see a guy...

1738
01:58:57,740 --> 01:59:00,910
...who will sacrifice himself
for this team...

1739
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:04,120
...because he knows,
when it comes down to it...

1740
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:06,620
...you're gonna do the same for him!

1741
01:59:07,790 --> 01:59:09,710
That's a team, gentlemen!

1742
01:59:11,420 --> 01:59:15,250
And either we heal now, as a team...

1743
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,460
...or we will die as individuals.

1744
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:25,800
That's football, guys.

1745
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:30,840
That's all it is.

1746
01:59:32,350 --> 01:59:33,510
Now...

1747
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:37,180
...what are you gonna do?

1748
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:44,310
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

1749
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:57,980
He's in the open field.

1750
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,270
He's gonna go all the way!

1751
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,400
To the thirty. All the way!

1752
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:03,900
Touchdown!

1753
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:08,570
- Way to go!
- No big deal.

1754
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:12,200
We still block and tackle.

1755
02:01:12,450 --> 02:01:15,910
We didn't say we'd win by a shutout.
Nothing changes, right?

1756
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:17,790
Stay with the game plan.

1757
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:21,160
- Set for the first series?
- Piece of cake.

1758
02:01:21,370 --> 02:01:23,040
Bring it home, Rock.

1759
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:30,840
How about a big Texas-size welcome
for the Miami Sharks...

1760
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:33,550
...and quarterback Jack Rooney!

1761
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:40,550
My baby!

1762
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:44,180
Guys, I missed your ugly mugs.

1763
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:48,680
Just like old times.
Your disk still spinning?

1764
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:51,260
Like your favorite CD, baby.

1765
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:53,060
Listen up.

1766
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:39,130
It's a 12-point game for Dallas.

1767
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:41,000
What? It's just one touchdown.

1768
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:55,680
In your hometown.

1769
02:02:55,930 --> 02:02:57,970
A long way to go,
a lot of time to play.

1770
02:03:09,650 --> 02:03:11,520
There he goes. Sack number 12.

1771
02:03:11,730 --> 02:03:14,900
That's a personal high
for Luther Lavay.

1772
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:29,240
Man, I can't believe this.
It stinks.

1773
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:32,830
We're the better team. We'll win
if we don't make any mistakes.

1774
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:09,520
Inches, inches.

1775
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:14,940
Let me on the finance committee. I'll
make a difference with the networks.

1776
02:04:15,190 --> 02:04:18,360
I know New York.
I can be incredibly effective.

1777
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,020
Your mother looks great, by the way.

1778
02:04:21,270 --> 02:04:24,240
- She loves Dallas. Neiman Marcus.
- She's a good woman.

1779
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:27,030
And your golf?

1780
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:31,030
I'm about an 11 from the whites.

1781
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:35,280
- Think you're ready for me?
- Don't think I'm in your class.

1782
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:50,880
First down, Dallas!

1783
02:04:51,790 --> 02:04:53,250
It's a good game.

1784
02:04:58,550 --> 02:04:59,590
Good team.

1785
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:01,550
Thank you.

1786
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:08,720
I don't wanna bother you about this--

1787
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:13,810
The owners would like you to
come to New York for a meeting.

1788
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:15,230
About what?

1789
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:18,560
There's a concern
that's been voiced...

1790
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:21,350
...about some moves made
on your behalf...

1791
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:24,980
...for another Los Angeles franchise.

1792
02:05:25,190 --> 02:05:29,400
- Rules have been broken. We've heard--
- Who said this?

1793
02:05:30,650 --> 02:05:34,030
Would Wednesday this week be too soon?

1794
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:37,530
No. That'd be fine.

1795
02:05:39,820 --> 02:05:40,700
Good.

1796
02:05:40,910 --> 02:05:44,160
The best of luck to you today, then.

1797
02:05:45,450 --> 02:05:49,450
I honestly believe that woman
would eat her young.

1798
02:05:50,410 --> 02:05:52,080
What the fuck just happened?

1799
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:53,490
That's the meaning
in one sentence...

1800
02:06:53,740 --> 02:06:55,040
...of captain Jack Rooney.

1801
02:06:55,290 --> 02:06:56,540
He won't take no for an answer.

1802
02:06:58,910 --> 02:07:00,290
Good job, Cap!

1803
02:07:02,290 --> 02:07:03,580
Good job, baby!

1804
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:06,340
They can't fuck with you!

1805
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:34,690
Score at halftime:
Knights 2 1, Sharks 17.

1806
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,690
- I'm going down.
- Is that a good idea?

1807
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:45,070
- Can you play?
- I'm banged up, but I'm all right.

1808
02:07:45,530 --> 02:07:46,940
Can you play?

1809
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,700
Yeah, you bet.

1810
02:07:48,950 --> 02:07:50,240
Look at me, Rock.

1811
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:54,700
You were a warrior out there today.

1812
02:07:55,700 --> 02:07:57,660
I will never forget this.

1813
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:05,790
Go do your job, coach.

1814
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:24,720
This isn't about you and me anymore.

1815
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,640
You gotta lead this team.

1816
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:32,510
When they look in your eyes...

1817
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:34,430
...they gotta believe.

1818
02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:36,980
I know.

1819
02:08:47,730 --> 02:08:51,360
What do you think you're doing?
Cap is finished.

1820
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:06,490
Never talk that way
in front of my players!

1821
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:07,870
Get out of here!

1822
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:11,500
I don't give a shit if Willie
is out there changing the plays!

1823
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:14,250
You let your ego get in the way
of this team...

1824
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:16,460
...and you'll lose
this fucking game!

1825
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:18,460
Get out of here!!

1826
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:27,470
I'm sorry, but Coach D.
already told me I was going in.

1827
02:09:32,930 --> 02:09:35,760
Control the line of scrimmage,
you'll control this game.

1828
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:39,390
Possession of the ball,
that's all I want. Move those chains.

1829
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:44,060
Read the safety's drop.
If he backpedals, then we go downtown.

1830
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:46,140
Surprise them. Make it sudden.

1831
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:50,190
If you see their arms shaking,
that means they're coming.

1832
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:52,690
Control the line of scrimmage,
you control the game.

1833
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:54,110
You said that already.

1834
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:58,980
One more thing. Right out of the gate,
let it fly, go 999.

1835
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:01,570
Shock the shit out of them!

1836
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:08,620
Interception!

1837
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:11,080
What a way to start
this second half!

1838
02:10:11,950 --> 02:10:13,910
He's down at the 48-yard line.

1839
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:18,080
That's a tough break for this kid,
his first time in the playoffs.

1840
02:10:18,290 --> 02:10:19,910
He's gotta be feeling the pressure.

1841
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:21,960
Branco's just aching to nail you.

1842
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:25,920
Watch his knuckles.
If they go white, do a fade to Sandman.

1843
02:10:26,130 --> 02:10:27,670
You want me to check off?

1844
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:29,590
Where's the coach I knew and loved?

1845
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:31,090
If Branco bites.

1846
02:10:46,890 --> 02:10:48,140
First down.

1847
02:11:16,910 --> 02:11:19,200
Looks like he had damage to his eye.

1848
02:11:19,870 --> 02:11:20,910
On the four!

1849
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:22,790
Twist it! Twist it!

1850
02:11:26,790 --> 02:11:30,120
Here we go.
Strong Left Zig 90 Gun on three.

1851
02:11:30,330 --> 02:11:32,000
I'm serious. It's Coach D.'s call.

1852
02:11:33,710 --> 02:11:34,670
By the way...

1853
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:37,420
...I'm sorry about getting a big head.
It wasn't me.

1854
02:11:38,590 --> 02:11:40,880
It was the devil. Red 666.

1855
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:47,260
Let's get them
before they know what hit them.

1856
02:11:47,470 --> 02:11:48,550
On three. Ready?

1857
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:50,930
Watch the robber on your right.

1858
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:52,260
He'll be coming at you.

1859
02:12:11,730 --> 02:12:13,610
Touchdown, Miami.

1860
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:16,990
I'm good!

1861
02:12:19,610 --> 02:12:21,320
This one right there.

1862
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:31,660
Touchdown!

1863
02:12:34,830 --> 02:12:38,790
If you hit him for another score
in the next series, he'll fold.

1864
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,290
I know it.

1865
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:50,590
Touchdown, Miami.

1866
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:54,720
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

1867
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:01,220
Depending on how the election goes....

1868
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:04,230
We got six producing wells probably
pumping out about....

1869
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:07,020
Your home base is in Dallas?

1870
02:13:10,650 --> 02:13:12,150
The thing that bothers me most...

1871
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:15,610
...is if you don't have 30,000
in attendance....

1872
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:42,210
Coach, it's fourth and one,
we need a time-out.

1873
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:45,170
All right. Shark! Let's go.
Run the Three-man.

1874
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:49,000
Looks like Dallas is going for it.

1875
02:13:49,210 --> 02:13:51,420
He is going for the victory now,
not a tie.

1876
02:13:51,630 --> 02:13:53,010
Here we go now. One time.

1877
02:13:53,210 --> 02:13:56,010
This is the game, Tug.
If Miami can hold them here...

1878
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:58,680
...Willie Beamen will have
one last chance.

1879
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:01,180
This is where the famous rubber...

1880
02:14:01,390 --> 02:14:02,640
...meets the famous road.

1881
02:14:03,470 --> 02:14:04,890
Settle down! Be proud!

1882
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:06,720
Guys, y'all gonna make this play.

1883
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:08,560
One yard stands between us
and Minnesota!

1884
02:14:08,770 --> 02:14:09,770
They got no respect for us.

1885
02:14:09,970 --> 02:14:11,020
Shark flat on his ass!

1886
02:14:11,230 --> 02:14:13,940
Everything we ever fought for
is on the line right now.

1887
02:14:14,140 --> 02:14:15,350
Be proud!

1888
02:14:19,730 --> 02:14:21,480
Strong right! Strong right!

1889
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:54,420
Is it first?

1890
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:05,300
Sharks' ball! First down!

1891
02:15:15,430 --> 02:15:17,850
Looks like a man's down
at the line of scrimmage.

1892
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:19,770
Luther " Shark " Lavay.

1893
02:15:20,690 --> 02:15:23,600
He's been the heart
and soul of this defense.

1894
02:15:23,810 --> 02:15:25,270
Let's hope he's okay.

1895
02:15:30,690 --> 02:15:31,900
Stabilize his head.

1896
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:38,240
Can you hear me?! Check his hands.

1897
02:15:38,570 --> 02:15:39,660
We got a pulse.

1898
02:15:41,740 --> 02:15:43,120
I don't know, coach.

1899
02:15:45,370 --> 02:15:47,700
What does that mean?
Is he breathing?

1900
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:49,330
Ambulance!

1901
02:15:49,540 --> 02:15:51,870
Talk to me, Shark. Come on.

1902
02:15:54,910 --> 02:15:56,250
Let's get that board over here!

1903
02:16:00,170 --> 02:16:01,750
Is this how it starts?

1904
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,600
Coach.

1905
02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:25,810
Did I stop him?

1906
02:16:26,270 --> 02:16:28,980
You stopped him cold, goddamn it!
Look at that!

1907
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:32,770
Major bonus, baby. One million bucks!

1908
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:38,610
One, two, three, roll.

1909
02:16:46,990 --> 02:16:49,120
Don't you guys drop me.

1910
02:16:49,450 --> 02:16:51,830
I'm worth a million dollars.

1911
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:08,210
Well, 55 seconds.
You think they can pull it off?

1912
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:12,420
Look at that. Oh, boy!
Is Dallas in trouble now!

1913
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:14,420
Willie Beamen's ritual.

1914
02:17:15,710 --> 02:17:17,220
Let's put Sanderson to work.

1915
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:20,010
55 seconds. Do or die.
We throw on two.

1916
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:21,300
Ready. Break!

1917
02:17:23,050 --> 02:17:25,180
It's beautiful to watch you throw.

1918
02:17:25,430 --> 02:17:27,850
It's beautiful to hear you say that,
not-so-old man.

1919
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:34,230
Razor! Check it. Razor!

1920
02:17:44,110 --> 02:17:45,020
Do it.

1921
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:47,400
Do it! Come on!

1922
02:17:51,950 --> 02:17:53,240
Be there!

1923
02:18:18,960 --> 02:18:21,510
Flag! On the play.
It's coming back.

1924
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:23,220
Holding, 69.

1925
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:26,880
No touchdown! Holding!

1926
02:18:35,510 --> 02:18:36,600
You're out!

1927
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:38,310
Touched an official!

1928
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:42,020
Not anymore! Get off!

1929
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:46,940
Thank you.

1930
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:53,070
- That might be the backbreaker.
- Damn it!

1931
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:56,320
- We got them where we want them.
- Punk!

1932
02:18:56,530 --> 02:18:57,650
I'll take it in myself.

1933
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:59,150
I liked you when you was puking!

1934
02:18:59,360 --> 02:19:01,570
- Who are we?
- Sharks!

1935
02:19:02,610 --> 02:19:05,070
I feel like things are changing,
you know?

1936
02:19:12,410 --> 02:19:14,330
Things are out of control.

1937
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:17,870
Maybe I'm just out of control.

1938
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:23,710
Sorry for the way I've been behaving.

1939
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:26,420
It's all right.

1940
02:19:33,050 --> 02:19:34,550
Keep your wits about you.

1941
02:19:37,050 --> 02:19:38,260
Roll it! Roll it!

1942
02:20:04,610 --> 02:20:05,650
Time-out.

1943
02:20:07,910 --> 02:20:09,450
Time-out, Miami!

1944
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:12,160
That's the last one.
Something's gotta be wrong.

1945
02:20:12,370 --> 02:20:15,030
- They had it cold.
- Smart move.

1946
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:18,040
There's something I've been
really dying to ask you.

1947
02:20:18,250 --> 02:20:22,210
Remember when you came to my place?
I made dinner for you?

1948
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:25,540
Did you not like the jambalaya?

1949
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:31,880
Worst shit I ever tasted.
Why do you think I've been throwing up?

1950
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:33,460
I thought that.

1951
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:36,880
- No, you know that.
- Now go win this game!

1952
02:20:51,140 --> 02:20:52,560
Comanche.

1953
02:20:53,430 --> 02:20:55,020
Tony, we got nine seconds!

1954
02:20:55,180 --> 02:20:57,560
If he's stopped inbounds,
the game's over.

1955
02:20:57,770 --> 02:20:59,480
This is what coaching's all about.

1956
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:03,820
Hey, Nick, you up for it?

1957
02:21:04,150 --> 02:21:05,360
Spread West Hustle....

1958
02:21:05,610 --> 02:21:06,860
West Hustle 60--

1959
02:21:07,070 --> 02:21:08,440
Sixty Comanche?

1960
02:21:08,690 --> 02:21:09,820
Man has balls of iron.

1961
02:21:10,570 --> 02:21:12,530
- We in this together?
- Dynamic duo, baby!

1962
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:47,510
Don't let him out-of-bounds!

1963
02:21:49,130 --> 02:21:50,340
Out!

1964
02:21:58,140 --> 02:21:59,520
Out-of-bounds on the 3!

1965
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:02,770
Unselfish! Unselfish!
Way to go, Julian!

1966
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:15,110
You hear that? That's four seconds.

1967
02:22:21,070 --> 02:22:23,070
Time-out called by the Knights.

1968
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:25,910
Dallas 35, Miami 3 1.

1969
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:28,780
Now, remember,
see it before you do it.

1970
02:22:29,410 --> 02:22:30,950
Julian gave you the shot.

1971
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:32,950
Make them believe, Willie.

1972
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:35,120
This time, now.

1973
02:22:37,250 --> 02:22:39,460
One on one, man on man.

1974
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:41,670
We do it together, all right?

1975
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:43,590
I know y'all don't wanna go home.

1976
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:45,000
It ain't no tomorrow!

1977
02:22:57,300 --> 02:23:00,140
Three yards to go. Four seconds.
One play.

1978
02:23:00,890 --> 02:23:02,720
We've been in too many of these.

1979
02:23:03,350 --> 02:23:04,390
This one'll get it.

1980
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:05,890
Four seconds.

1981
02:23:06,980 --> 02:23:09,140
Four seconds is a lifetime!

1982
02:23:09,390 --> 02:23:11,390
We're a lifetime away here!

1983
02:23:17,230 --> 02:23:18,770
Rifle 22!

1984
02:24:11,010 --> 02:24:12,850
I think he lost it!
It didn't go!

1985
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:25,900
Watch out! Watch out!

1986
02:24:26,270 --> 02:24:27,150
Touchdown!

1987
02:24:32,070 --> 02:24:34,110
Touchdown! Touchdown!

1988
02:25:44,110 --> 02:25:45,240
Nice night.

1989
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:48,870
Can't get over Cap.

1990
02:25:50,620 --> 02:25:54,450
I learned more watching him in the
first half than I did in five seasons.

1991
02:25:55,450 --> 02:25:57,500
Next week I'll win it
just for him.

1992
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:03,920
Glad to see success hasn't
gone to your head too much, kid.

1993
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:06,500
Who, me? Steamin' Beamen?

1994
02:26:09,170 --> 02:26:10,800
This is your moment, Willie.

1995
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:13,090
Savor it.

1996
02:26:14,590 --> 02:26:19,470
But never forget. On any given Sunday,
you're either gonna win or lose.

1997
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:23,510
" But can you win or lose like a man? "
I got it, coach.

1998
02:26:34,350 --> 02:26:35,850
Next year...

1999
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:38,060
...I'm out of here.

2000
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:42,780
I figured.

2001
02:26:46,110 --> 02:26:48,860
I'm not the right guy
for this team anymore.

2002
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:50,780
I wouldn't say all that.

2003
02:26:51,530 --> 02:26:55,240
There was this great quarterback
in the '70s I knew.

2004
02:26:55,450 --> 02:26:59,120
I mean, this guy was one tough
son of a bitch.

2005
02:26:59,330 --> 02:27:02,120
He fought for every inch he ever got.

2006
02:27:02,450 --> 02:27:06,580
He didn't have your natural skills,
but he could make it happen.

2007
02:27:06,750 --> 02:27:09,920
He could win.
But the game passed him by.

2008
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:12,790
Anyway, I ran into this guy...

2009
02:27:13,750 --> 02:27:15,750
...a few weeks ago in L.A.

2010
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:20,130
We had a few beers, and we start
talking. You know what he told me?

2011
02:27:21,470 --> 02:27:23,130
He said when he looked back...

2012
02:27:23,300 --> 02:27:26,590
...he didn't really miss
the Pantheon Cups...

2013
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:28,510
...or the girls...

2014
02:27:28,930 --> 02:27:30,180
...or even the glory.

2015
02:27:30,470 --> 02:27:31,970
You know what he missed?

2016
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:37,850
What he missed were those other guys
looking back at him in the huddle.

2017
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:40,480
Those eleven guys...

2018
02:27:41,770 --> 02:27:44,690
...every one of them seeing things
the same way.

2019
02:27:45,110 --> 02:27:47,480
All of them looking downfield...

2020
02:27:47,940 --> 02:27:49,190
...together.

2021
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:51,990
That's what he missed.

2022
02:27:55,150 --> 02:27:56,990
I'm gonna miss you, amigo.

2023
02:28:13,290 --> 02:28:17,540
You know, my arm has been killing me.
I met with a specialist who said--

2024
02:28:24,590 --> 02:28:26,090
I'm scared.

2025
02:28:33,890 --> 02:28:34,890
We're all scared.

2026
02:28:35,140 --> 02:28:39,270
If you think it's easy being a coach,
I'll trade your microphone for my ulcer.

2027
02:28:39,470 --> 02:28:41,770
I'm a triple-decker
stress sandwich right now.

2028
02:28:42,020 --> 02:28:45,850
Why is that, coach?
The 32-13 loss to San Francisco?

2029
02:28:46,100 --> 02:28:49,850
You're not even close, Johnny.
Try fishing someplace else.

2030
02:28:50,060 --> 02:28:53,650
And I want to live up to what it is
my father left me.

2031
02:28:54,110 --> 02:28:55,570
A legacy.

2032
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:58,570
A feeling of a bond with this town.

2033
02:28:58,820 --> 02:29:01,110
A feeling that this is our house.

2034
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:03,490
The Pagniacci house.

2035
02:29:08,990 --> 02:29:11,370
And we have great confidence...

2036
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:15,370
...that in the final hour,
our mayor will be there for us.

2037
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:31,260
And Tony....

2038
02:29:32,090 --> 02:29:33,130
Know this.

2039
02:29:33,380 --> 02:29:35,800
Wherever you go, you will always be...

2040
02:29:37,050 --> 02:29:39,930
...loved and greatly respected.

2041
02:29:41,890 --> 02:29:42,930
Thank you.

2042
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:48,060
Thanks for helping me understand again
what I had forgotten.

2043
02:29:51,430 --> 02:29:52,980
Tony D.!

2044
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:13,780
He's been here 30 years!

2045
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:16,530
Even the dogs are sad, he said.

2046
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:23,960
It's been way too long
not to win a big one.

2047
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:28,790
San Francisco sure
took care of that for us.

2048
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:39,630
In football, as in life, things change.

2049
02:30:42,630 --> 02:30:47,340
I guess it's time for me to get the
hell out of the way, bring in the new.

2050
02:30:48,050 --> 02:30:51,430
I like Nick Crozier.
I think he'll do a great job.

2051
02:30:56,270 --> 02:31:00,230
But most of all I want to thank
the people of Miami...

2052
02:31:02,310 --> 02:31:06,860
...for their support through
the last 20-some odd years.

2053
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:08,980
Gee, it just flew by.

2054
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:15,320
It's really meant a lot to me.

2055
02:31:19,410 --> 02:31:21,160
It meant everything to me.

2056
02:31:22,620 --> 02:31:26,120
I've had a great, great ride,
believe me. And....

2057
02:31:26,330 --> 02:31:27,790
And I'm gonna miss you.

2058
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,870
He's an arrogant son of a bitch,
but I'll miss him.

2059
02:31:34,870 --> 02:31:37,040
In thinking about change...

2060
02:31:37,830 --> 02:31:42,590
...I don't know, I felt maybe it was
time for me to make a change too.

2061
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:47,920
And it was Willie Beamen taught me
how to give it another shot.

2062
02:31:51,010 --> 02:31:52,640
So starting today...

2063
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:55,260
...I'm taking over as head coach...

2064
02:31:55,510 --> 02:31:59,720
...for that new expansion team in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Aztecs.

2065
02:32:00,970 --> 02:32:05,310
" Why, " do you say? Because they're
giving me full management control.

2066
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:10,400
But hoping not to make a complete fool
of myself out there...

2067
02:32:10,730 --> 02:32:14,070
...I just signed Willie Beamen
as my starting quarterback...

2068
02:32:14,270 --> 02:32:16,860
...and franchise player for the Aztecs.

2069
02:32:18,570 --> 02:32:23,150
So, Miss P, I look forward to seeing you
next season across those sidelines.

2070
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:29,320
So long....Au revoir....

2071
02:32:30,580 --> 02:32:33,040
See you when the clouds come home.

2072
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,290
Especially you, baby.
Smoking cigars on me now, are you?
