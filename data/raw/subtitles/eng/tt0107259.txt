1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,800
Joan the Maid

2
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,360
I - The Battles

3
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,120
I had a daughter,

4
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,040
born within wedlock,

5
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,000
whom I had baptised and confirmed.

6
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,920
I brought her up to be God-fearing

7
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,760
and to respect Church tradition

8
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,240
in spite of her young age
and humble birth.

9
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,840
As a result, though she grew up
in fields and pastures,

10
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,720
she spent much time in church.

11
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,280
November Tth, 1455,
in Notre-Dame de Paris -

12
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,160
Each month,
she received Holy Communion.

13
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,320
She fasted and she prayed.

14
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,080
She displayed great devotion
and fervour

15
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,240
to resolving the hardships
of the people

16
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,720
because she felt
great compassion for them.

17
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,120
Isabelle Romée,
mother of Jeanne -

18
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,360
And yet, though she never thought,
conceived or did anything

19
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,160
contrary to her faith,

20
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,160
some of her enemies
had her tried for heresy.

21
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,000
And in spite of her denials
and appeals

22
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,960
no one supported her innocence,

23
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,920
and, without any trace of legality,

24
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,560
they condemned her,
damnably and criminally,

25
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,640
to a cruel death by fire.

26
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,920
For this, their souls will be damned,

27
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:48,280
and I, Isabelle Romée,
have sumered an irreparable loss.

28
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,920
What is it? Oh, it's you, Laxart?
You've brought round this little pest?

29
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:41,160
My Lord, Captain, forgive me.
Forgive her.

30
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,680
- My Lord, hear me out.
- Be quiet! I won't listen to you.

31
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,080
I'm speaking to your uncle.
Yes, you, the man from Burey.

32
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,640
You're known to be a good man,
a good husband, a reliable type.

33
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,520
- Yes, my Lord.
- Well, it won't last.

34
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,400
Tell me,
has this little goose bewitched you?

35
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:10,200
Or have you gone soft in the head,
bringing her back against my will?

36
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,000
Neither, Captain. Forgive me.
She hasn't changed her mind.

37
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,880
So you think I change my mind
as often as I change my shirt?

38
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,480
I was kind enough to listen
six months ago.

39
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,160
- What did I tell you at the time?
- My Lord, Captain, I obeyed you.

40
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,280
- What did I tell you?
- To bring her back to her parents.

41
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,920
Yes, after slapping her around a lot.

42
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,320
If you'd done that, I wouldn't be
wasting my breath with a fool like you.

43
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,840
A couple of slaps.
I should have taken care of it myself.

44
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,000
He was joking.

45
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,120
It was bound to go this way.

46
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
He called me a fool.

47
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,680
It'll work the third time.

48
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,000
Vaucouleurs in the Barrois,
mid-January, 1429

49
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,440
- Almost ready.
- Jeanne!

50
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,080
- Where has she got to now?
- She's with my wife.

51
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,560
- Where else would she be?
- You can't tell.

52
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,920
One can't control her.

53
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,240
- Jeanne!
- Catherine!

54
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,880
Bring a bottle and two glasses.
They're leaving.

55
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,160
- Are you deaf?
- Don't bother.

56
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,440
- I want to be back before dark.
- Have one for the road.

57
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,280
Goodbye, Uncle.

58
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,120
- What?
- I'm not leaving.

59
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,520
Don't look at me like that.

60
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,560
I'm ashamed, but I must stay.

61
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,160
- This madness must end.
- I'm not mad.

62
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,400
Have you considered
how your father will feel?

63
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,600
- What am I to tell him this time?
- Tell him the truth.

64
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,320
Henri, help me.
I'd like to beat her, but I can't.

65
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,120
Catherine told me I could stay here.

66
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,680
Women, women, they're a plague.

67
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't speak ill of women, Henri.

68
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,080
Without them, you'd be nothing but
wasted seed in your father's underclothes

69
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,360
and three flies
could have sipped you up.

70
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,840
Maybe I will have some wine.

71
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,600
I realise I've upset you.

72
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,280
But I'm unappy too.

73
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,520
I have been for a long time.

74
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,840
- Why must you be so stubborn?
- I'm not. I'm merely obeying.

75
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,720
- She's obeying.
- You're obeying me?

76
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,120
I'm not obeying you, Uncle.
Forgive me.

77
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,280
She speaks in riddles.

78
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,240
I can't help it. I must go to France
and see the dauphin.

79
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,680
The kingdom's in danger,
and I alone can save it.

80
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,000
I know. We'll deal with that later.

81
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,080
Now we must get home.

82
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,440
Why don't you believe her?
Havert you heard of the prophecy?

83
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,040
- What prophecy?
- The one that says the kingdom,

84
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,080
which was lost by a woman,
will be saved by a virgin from Lorraine.

85
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,560
It's a dimerent story in Champagne.

86
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,960
But it's true, everyone knows about it.

87
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,960
You don't believe it
because you're afraid to.

88
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,760
That's why we're losing
and the kingdom is in ruins.

89
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:51,280
Listen to her. Listen to her speak.
No one speaks the way she does.

90
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,160
It's as if gold poured out of her mouth.

91
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
Everyone will want to hear her.

92
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
They'll all come here.

93
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,320
All those with nothing better to do.
And we'll have to feed them.

94
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,000
You know what? You're too stupid.

95
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,040
She'll sleep with me.

96
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,520
I give up. I'll go and see your father.

97
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,680
He'll run me through.

98
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,080
You know he won't.

99
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,920
He'll cry, and my mother will cry.

100
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,520
So will you, and so will I,
thinking about you all.

101
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,280
The Meuse will burst its banks.

102
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,160
I'll be back, Jeanne.

103
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Wort you kiss me?

104
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,160
I have aged ten years in one.

105
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,680
So Jeanne stayed at my house
for three weeks.

106
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,480
I
Time seemed to slow down for her
as for an expectant mother,

107
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,840
in her longing to meet the dauphin.

108
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,280
What is she up to?

109
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,400
- She's sitting on the chest.
- But what is she up to?

110
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,960
Nothing. She's not moving.

111
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,760
Her eyes are shining
and her lips are moving.

112
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,560
- Is she saying something?
- I can't hear anything.

113
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,000
Her cheeks are red, as red as enamel.

114
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,160
Is light emitting from her?

115
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,720
No, it's just the lamp light.

116
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,920
Call her.

117
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,240
You call her.
I don't dare when she's like this.

118
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,200
It's the si_h time she's sung,
and she still hasn't moved.

119
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,720
Jeanne! Are you coming to eat?

120
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,760
It's ready.

121
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,320
- Did she hear me?
- I don't know.

122
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
She's still not moving.

123
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,920
So the days passed,
as though time stood still -

124
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:28,520
I'm not saying Baudricourt isn't a good captain.
They won't leave it at that.

125
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,040
Do you think he'll strike again?

126
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
They failed a month ago.

127
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,040
We're the last royal enclave
in the region.

128
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,080
They'll keep coming at us.

129
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,840
They're all around us.

130
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,040
- As at Orléans.
- Yes, as at Orléans.

131
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Or almost. I'd hate to be there.

132
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,240
Here, we have some breathing space.
They're completely surrounded.

133
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:00,280
It can't be fun.

134
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,560
Is the Loire still frozen in February?

135
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:14,040
If the Loire were to freeze, it'd be very
dangerous when the sun came out.

136
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,480
You slip through the ice and drown
before you knew it.

137
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,280
I've seen it happen.

138
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,480
I was in the king's army when I was young.

139
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,440
I know, Jacques.

140
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,520
Not the dauphirs.
His father's, Charles the Mad.

141
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,800
Did you fight? Did you bear arms?

142
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,760
I was in charge of fodder.

143
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,920
We went everywhere,
we even went to Brittany.

144
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,360
I know all the fords, all the bridges
between here and Bourges.

145
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,520
I saw wild animals, I saw brigands.

146
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
Have you heard of the flayers?

147
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,200
Hey, are you asleep?

148
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
I'm talking to you.

149
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,360
Is that true? That you know
the way to Bourges?

150
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Would you know
how to reach Chinon?

151
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,160
Would you know how to get there?

152
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,040
It's not a journey
to make at a time like this.

153
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,880
Not with all the Burgundians around.

154
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,560
Be careful, Jacques Alain.

155
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,800
She presses everyone into service.

156
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,720
- Hello, Uncle.
- So you're back?

157
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,040
Were you getting bored in Burey?

158
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,000
I can no longer stand
lying to your father.

159
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,040
I'd rather be here with you, erring.

160
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,360
Let's see this through, then.
Come to Chinon with us.

161
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,080
- He'll take us there.
- Who? Me?

162
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,040
Don't you want to see the dauphin?

163
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,080
The King of Bourges?

164
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,040
Should one risk being cut to pieces
to deliver a message to a wretch,

165
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,280
who probably won't have a corner
of his kingdom left once we get there?

166
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,160
- He'll cover you with honours.
- You're daydreaming.

167
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,120
Look at you. Look at us.

168
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,800
Even if we reach the king's castle,
however wretched he may be,

169
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,960
- we won't get to see him.
- You don't know that.

170
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,600
I must go to Chinon.

171
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,200
Help me get there.

172
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,080
The rest is up to heaven.

173
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,400
- Shall we bring the donkey along?
- This is no time to be a pilgrim.

174
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,880
God, keep us on the right path.

175
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,720
My stirrups are set too high.

176
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,000
I set them just right to travel fast.
Arert we in a hurry?

177
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,040
I hope he won't throw me into a ditch.
I've never yet made a horse gallop.

178
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,040
We train our horses
to be both lively and obedient.

179
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,160
Are you tired, Jeanne?

180
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,920
Saint-Nicolas is just over there.
We'll be there before dark.

181
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,400
- We must go back to Vaucouleurs.
- You think we're too old for this?

182
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,840
No, we shouldn't leave in this manner.

183
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,800
I need someone to speak
to the dauphin on my behalf.

184
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,440
Your captain,
he's the only one who can do it.

185
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
You're so dimicult, my child.

186
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,960
You start, you stop,
you rush foM/ard, you turn back.

187
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,360
The fact is I know what I must do,

188
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,880
and sometimes
I don't know how to do it.

189
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
You're still here?

190
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,000
If all my parishioners were like you,

191
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:39,160
I'd have no concerns
about their souls' salvation.

192
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,280
During confession, you told me
I was sinning against caution.

193
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,840
There's something I didn't tell you.
It's that you argue too much.

194
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,240
Is that a sin?

195
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,280
Go on, keep praying.

196
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,760
Look who's back.

197
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:36,040
You there, scram!

198
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Go home.

199
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,880
You're not welcome here.

200
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,800
- She's back?
- Yes.

201
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,680
The maiden
who wants to save the king.

202
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,000
I know someone who'd like to ask her
for some help too.

203
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:14,440
Yes, he's called Percy,
and he's no bigger than my little toe.

204
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:18,840
Don't speak to her.
The captain will have you whipped.

205
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,080
I
We're not allowed to talk to her
or he'll put us in chains.

206
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,200
Your orders aren't necessarily mine.

207
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,160
So, my lovely one,
why have you come here?

208
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,120
Don't you know the king
will be expelled

209
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,680
- and we'll soon all be English?
- Who are you?

210
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,360
They call me Jean de Metz.
I'm Robert de Baudricourt's squire.

211
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,080
And I've come to this royal city
to talk to him.

212
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,960
I want him to have me
escorted to the king.

213
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,080
That's what I've been told, yes.
And I bet he's not agreeable.

214
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,120
He's ignoring me.

215
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,640
And yet I must see the king
before the third Thursday of Lent,

216
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,760
even if it means walking
until my legs are just stumps.

217
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,720
I absolutely must see him.

218
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,760
Even if you got to see the king,
what dimerence would it make?

219
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,200
Even the king of Scotland,
with his army, can't help him.

220
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Even his mother disinerited him.

221
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,200
And when Orléans falls,
run for your life!

222
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,880
Hello, England!
God damn, thank you, fare ye well.

223
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Shut your mouths!

224
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,120
- What do you say to that?
- That's how it is.

225
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,920
There is no one in the world, no one,

226
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,640
neither duke nor prince
nor daughter of the king of Scotland,

227
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,880
who can recover the French kingdom.

228
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,080
I alone can help him.

229
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:11,200
You alone? Really?

230
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,520
I realise my position is lowly.

231
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,240
I'd much rather have stayed at home,
spinning and sewing with my mother.

232
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,760
I'm very good at sewing.

233
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,440
But I must. I must go. I must do this.

234
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,760
My Lord demands it.

235
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,920
You speak of your lord.

236
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,320
Mine's Baudricourt, the captain.
Who is yours?

237
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,400
God, the king of heaven.

238
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,400
- When would you like to leave?
- Today rather than tomorrow.

239
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,880
Rather tomorrow than the day after.

240
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,680
I'll speak with our captain.

241
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,560
And if God helps us,
I'll be the one to lead you to the king.

242
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,480
And many more, as the days passed,
began to believe her.

243
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,760
Eventually, Duke Charles of Lorraine,
who was ill, asked to see her.

244
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:31,840
Jeanne went to see him,
in Nancy, with a safe-conduct.

245
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,440
Three days later,
she returned to Vaucouleurs.

246
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,600
Look.

247
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,520
No! Four francs!

248
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,720
- What did you say to him?
- Nothing. I asked him...

249
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,760
Henri!

250
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,760
Come and look at this!

251
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,840
Look at what he gave her.

252
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,760
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.

253
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,840
I asked him for an escort
to go to France.

254
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,960
He thought I'd cure him
from his illness.

255
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,800
- That's why he wanted to see me.
- So, did you cure him?

256
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,840
Well, no.

257
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:37,120
His illness is old age.

258
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:50,000
Now what will I do?

259
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,960
Hey, is she here?

260
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Come with us!

261
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,000
Go ahead.

262
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:36,040
You stay there.

263
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,480
If this girl is bad,

264
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,200
let her move away from us.

265
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,480
If she is good, let her come closer.

266
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You see?

267
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,200
Fine.

268
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,440
Since that's the way it is,
since everybody seems to want it,

269
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,560
- you'll get your escort.
- Not a moment too soon.

270
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,280
And you pe_ormed an exorcism,

271
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,240
even though you'd heard my confession
this morning.

272
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,080
I know.

273
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,560
It was for his benefit.

274
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,760
I'll give you Jean de Metz.
Does that suit you?

275
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,440
I don't know what you did to him.
You're all he talks about.

276
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,640
Jeanne? What are you doing?

277
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,000
I must look like a boy.

278
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,080
But it's all crooked.
You look like a scarecrow.

279
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,120
Help me.

280
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
Come over here.

281
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,400
- I need chausses and a jacket.
- Not a jacket, a doublet.

282
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,640
Let me think who's built like you.

283
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,800
I know, Marie will give you her sors,
as he's ill.

284
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
He's been in bed
since Midsummer's Day.

285
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,120
His doublet has never been used.

286
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,840
I find it strange
to imagine you as a boy.

287
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,560
You can't keep those clogs.

288
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,560
You'll need a cloak.

289
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,280
Pierrot, our neighbour,
will give you his. He's your size.

290
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,840
You know Jean.

291
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:10,080
He's Bertrand de Poulengy,
a good squire.

292
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,960
He's the king's messenger,
Colet de Vienne.

293
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,040
He'll guide you.

294
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,720
And this is Richard, the archer.

295
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,960
I
Swear, before her

296
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,920
that you will guide her safely
to Chinon to meet our king.

297
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
I swear it.

298
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Just a second!

299
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:18,200
This is for you.

300
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,760
- Thank you, Captain.
- Go along, go,

301
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,840
come what may.

302
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,360
That same evening
of February 12th, 1429 -

303
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,840
As we left the town, that first evening,
we were afraid,

304
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,920
because there were many Burgundian
and English soldiers along the route.

305
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,240
We travelled all night.

306
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:16,760
- Go ahead, we'll join you later.
- Don't be long.

307
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,520
Just the time to take a leak.

308
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,080
She already thinks she's our captain.

309
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,640
Yes, she puts on airs.

310
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,600
Only, later,
when we'll all have to sleep together...

311
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:50,640
Don't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

312
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,720
Really? She's going to sleep
alongside us both?

313
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:03,320
Well, yes. Between two gentlemen.
We have to keep warm.

314
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,560
Have you ever been with a woman?

315
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:14,080
- I bet you haven't.
- Not really, no.

316
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:16,120
The time's come, then.

317
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:21,120
She may well dress like a man,
but she has all that's required.

318
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:25,120
Virgin or not, before the journey's up,
we'll know her in and out.

319
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:28,760
Stop it! You're making me piss
on my breeches.

320
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,640
Your little birdie wants to fly away.
You pig, you're already excited.

321
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,080
It's empty.
And there's some straw left.

322
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,800
You'll keep guard. Jean will
relieve you halmay through the day.

323
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,680
Can't you sleep?

324
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,720
Can't you?

325
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,360
Every time I close my eyes, I imagine
we're being attacked by the enemy.

326
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Me too.

327
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,480
Look at her. She looks like an angel.

328
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,960
I'll be punished for all the filth
I spouted earlier, I know I will.

329
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,600
I'd give anything
to have kept my mouth shut.

330
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,760
You should see your faces!

331
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,960
Have you swallowed a slug?

332
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,760
Didrt you hear a snapping sound?

333
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,840
I heard nothing.
Now, be good. We must sleep.

334
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,600
What are you afraid of?

335
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:29,240
Afraid? Us?

336
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,240
- We're not afraid.
- Afraid of the English?

337
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
We'll hear them coming.

338
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,080
- You'll hear nothing coming.
- What?

339
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,280
Because nothing will come. Trust me.

340
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Go to sleep.

341
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,960
Like this.

342
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,120
Yes, very good.

343
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:31,200
- You make it look light.
- It isn't.

344
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:35,800
Careful, you're hitting with the flat side.

345
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,120
I don't want to kill anyone.

346
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,040
Slaps or dust-ups,
I'll give you plenty of those.

347
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:48,240
- Like that?
- Ow!

348
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,720
- That must hurt.
- Yes, it hurts a lot.

349
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,000
I've sinned against you badly,
you know.

350
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:03,960
You? It's thanks to you
that I was able to leave.

351
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,160
That will get you into heaven.

352
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,320
I think you really come from God.

353
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,920
- You had doubts?
- No.

354
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:22,320
We travelled for 11 days,

355
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,800
crossingrivers
andridingallthewaytoChinon.

356
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,800
As we travelled together, I asked her
if she would achieve her aims.

357
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:40,400
And the Maid kept telling us
not to be afraid,

358
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:44,200
that she had been ordered to do this.

359
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:03,040
They've plundered everything.

360
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,080
It's been too many days
since I last went to Mass.

361
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,400
How will it be possible?

362
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,400
Jeanne.

363
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,680
Jeanne.

364
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
Leave her.

365
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,800
It's happening to her again.

366
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,480
It always happens
when we're about to eat.

367
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:00,120
Not a bit of it. It happens all the time.

368
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:02,200
I must say, I find it reassuring.

369
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,640
At least, this way,
we know where we're going.

370
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:09,280
If we had only you to rely upon...

371
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,120
Go ahead, say what you're thinking.

372
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:15,080
- Am I not a good guide?
- Yes, you are.

373
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:20,040
- Only you're not always very clear.
- Shush!

374
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,520
We mustrt disturb her.

375
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:40,400
- Do you know this village?
- Yes.

376
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,760
But I don't know
what's become of it recently.

377
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,120
I want to go there.
I must attend Mass.

378
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:50,480
I don't know.
Everything changes so quickly here.

379
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:53,000
First they're friends, then enemies.

380
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:55,040
Well?

381
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,200
Can you smell Burgundy...

382
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:01,720
or Armagnac?

383
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,120
This way. It's longer, but it's safer.

384
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:09,200
Yes. The enemy may be there,
but God is sure to be.

385
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,080
On February 23rd,
at Sainte-Catherine de Fierbois -

386
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,880
I thought the third Mass
would be shorter.

387
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:43,880
Given the number of times the bell's rung,
it should be over soon.

388
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:49,240
You guessed right.

389
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:57,280
- How far is it to Chinon?
- Less than half a day.

390
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,000
Get some paper and write.

391
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,400
"Gentle Dauphin,

392
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,720
"Give a good reception to the Maid.

393
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,240
"I have travelled 150 leagues
to come and see you

394
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,280
"on behalf of the king of heaven."

395
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:28,440
- Arert you writing?
- You want me to write that?

396
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,480
Of course.

397
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:32,680
Then you'll leave immediately.

398
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,720
The dauphin should be informed
that we're on our way, don't you think?

399
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,320
I'll start again.

400
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,360
"Gentle Dauphin,

401
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,120
"Give a good reception to the Maid."

402
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:55,000
When we reached our inn in Chinon,

403
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:59,520
people were sent to ask her
why she had come and what she wanted.

404
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,280
Some advisers had told the king
not to trust her.

405
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,120
Others said that,
since she was sent by God,

406
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,920
the king should at least hear her out.

407
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,160
On the third day, after a messenger
from Robert de Baudricourt had arrived,

408
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:21,200
they came to fetch her.

409
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,880
Follow me.

410
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,200
I think we're about to part ways.

411
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:44,240
And I think we'll meet again.
I don't know where.

412
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,720
Adieu, my friends.

413
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,680
I'll last a year, no more.
I must work hard.

414
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,800
May God grant you a long life,
Gentle Dauphin.

415
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,920
Why do you address me?

416
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,320
Look at how I am dressed.

417
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,000
Why should I be the one you call
"Gentle Dauphin"?

418
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:19,200
I know that you are the true heir of France

419
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:21,240
and the son of a king.

420
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,480
What do you want?
What do you expect from me?

421
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,480
Noble Dauphin,

422
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:37,840
I came because I was sent by God

423
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,920
to help you and the kingdom.

424
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
What's your name?

425
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,480
I'm called Jeanne the Maid,

426
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:53,760
and God wants me
to give you the message

427
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,440
that you will be anointed
and crowned in Rheims.

428
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:02,600
And you will be the lieutenant of
the king of heaven, who is king of France.

429
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,880
Gentle Dauphin, give me some men
so that I can lift the siege at Orléans

430
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,360
and lead you to Rheims.

431
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,440
I wish to speak to you alone.

432
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,400
I have great faith in her.

433
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:41,080
Jeanne told me a secret that no one,
beside God, could know.

434
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,640
Yes, I trust her.

435
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,000
I want her to stay here tonight,
in the Tour du Coudray.

436
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:59,960
Let her be looked after
by my master of the house.

437
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Gaucourt,

438
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,520
let her have a page.

439
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:12,080
Here's Louis de Coutes, sire.

440
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:16,280
When his father, Jean de Coutes,
chamberlain to the Duke of Orleans, died,

441
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,000
the duke entrusted the child to me
so that I might make him a page.

442
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,760
He is a good page.

443
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,640
Two days later,
in the middle of the day -

444
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,920
Are the soles of your shoes
tough enough, Jeanne?

445
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,320
They saw me through a long journey.

446
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,640
Mine are quite worn out.

447
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,200
Unless my lord is prepared
to lend me some more money...

448
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:10,040
You already owe me
a thousand gold écus, sire.

449
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,000
I can add...

450
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:18,560
these 12 coins here.

451
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,520
We'll have to deduct them
from the war chest.

452
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:31,280
As you can see, Maid, the French dauphin
is given great consideration.

453
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,960
Where is she?

454
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,440
Already back in our rich province?

455
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,480
I was hunting quail.

456
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:18,000
I was told a maid had arrived
who says she can save the kingdom.

457
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:21,120
- That's what she says.
- Where is she?

458
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,120
I've never seen a girl
do something like that.

459
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,520
- Who is this gentleman?
- The Duke of Alençon.

460
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,480
The noble cousin of our king.

461
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,280
You are very welcome.

462
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,240
The more of the French royal family
we have together, the better.

463
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,160
I, Regnault de Chartres,

464
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:38,800
Archbishop of Rheims,
Chancellor of France

465
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,000
and advisor to the king,

466
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:47,680
said the Maid should be questioned
on some points of faith.

467
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:53,600
The king wanted Jeanne to be questioned
in the town of Poitiers.

468
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,800
She was put up in the house
of Master Jean Rabateau,

469
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,440
at that time the king's lawyer in Parliament.

470
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,800
She stayed there for over three weeks.

471
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,760
I chose, for examiners,

472
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:15,240
Master Pierre de Versailles,
former professor of the University of Paris,

473
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,200
Master Mathieu Mesnage,
Master Guillaume Aymeri,

474
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:26,800
Brother Seguin Seguin,
then Dean of the University of Poitiers,

475
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:32,080
and others
whose names I cannot recall.

476
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:52,800
Do you know why we are here?

477
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,440
- To interrogate me.
- You put it badly.

478
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:02,200
We are here to test your good faith.

479
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:08,040
We will find out whether
it is good or evil that guides you.

480
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,280
Just as internal illnesses
must become visible,

481
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:18,280
hidden evil must manifest itself
in some visible manner.

482
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:25,000
And good must dispel the shadows
and doubts that surround it.

483
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,360
I was already questioned in Chinon.

484
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,400
That is true.

485
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,880
Your replies
were found to be relevant.

486
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:45,040
You were found to be devout,
sober, temperate,

487
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:53,880
accustomed to go to confession
and take Communion once a week.

488
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,960
That's not enough.
We need to find out more about you.

489
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,360
You wear mers clothes
and have short hair.

490
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,960
It is not suitable to your station.

491
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
The apostle condemns it.

492
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:12,440
Moral and religious law
formally forbids it.

493
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,920
I was unaware of all this.

494
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,400
I dressed in the way
that best suited my mission.

495
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,360
It was not revealed to me
that it was wrong.

496
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:34,360
These revelations,
from what did you get them?

497
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,240
From whom did you receive them?

498
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,960
From Saint Michael,
Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret.

499
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,440
What makes you think it is them?

500
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,960
They told me.

501
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:03,680
You wouldn't be the first to have
had dreams inspired by the earth,

502
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:06,240
by animality, by the devil,

503
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:11,360
by which I mean,
avarice, lust and pride.

504
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:16,480
Of all those who appear before you,
which one came to you first?

505
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:19,080
Saint Michael came first.

506
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,640
I was 13, or thereabouts.

507
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:27,440
He wasrt alone. He was surrounded
by many angels from heaven.

508
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,000
Did you see the angels in the flesh?

509
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,080
I saw them with my eyes,
just as I see you.

510
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,040
When they went away, I cried.

511
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,920
I would have liked them
to take me with them.

512
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,440
- What did Saint Michael look like?
- Did he wear a crown?

513
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,760
I saw no crown.

514
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
- I didn't notice his clothes.
- Did he have hair?

515
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I don't know.

516
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,800
Was he holding scales?

517
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,840
I know nothing about that.

518
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,640
How did you know it was Saint Michael
who was speaking to you?

519
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,960
He spoke to me
in the language of the angels.

520
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,280
Of the angels that were
all around him?

521
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,840
How can you be sure
they were angels?

522
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,320
I firmly believe they were angels.

523
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:46,880
But if... enemy put on angel dress,

524
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,080
how can it be figured what is?

525
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:52,920
That is not the language of the angels.

526
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,000
If the enemy took on the shape
of an angel,

527
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,040
how would you recognise him?

528
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,680
I'd know if it were Saint Michael
or something pretending to be him.

529
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:13,920
The first time...

530
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,920
Please continue.

531
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:25,520
The first time,
I had grave doubts and I was afraid.

532
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:32,760
I saw him many times
before I was sure it was Saint Michael.

533
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,880
When did you first see him?

534
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,920
I've already told you that.

535
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:46,520
I was a young girl and I was afraid
ofwhat I was seeing.

536
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,760
But later he taught me
and showed me so many things,

537
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,920
that I firmly believed it was him.

538
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,520
What did he teach you?

539
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:03,480
He taught me to feel compassion
for the kingdom of France.

540
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,720
He told me to leave my village
and come to France.

541
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:12,720
And that I would come to the rescue
of the French dauphin.

542
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:23,320
No doubt you felt a sense of pride
and contentment?

543
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:26,760
At first, I began to cry.

544
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:32,680
Then the voice told me
to go to Vaucouleurs,

545
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:36,760
where I would find a captain
who would take me to the dauphin.

546
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:40,240
He told me I had nothing to fear.

547
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:47,640
Why do you call the king
"the dauphin"

548
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,280
and not "the king"?

549
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,120
I will not call him that until he has been
crowned and anointed in Rheims,

550
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:56,160
where I am to lead him.

551
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,200
What was the voice like?

552
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:06,920
The voice was gentle.

553
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,120
What tongue spoke it?

554
01:09:09,159 --> 01:09:12,160
What language did the voice use?

555
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:14,640
It was better than yours.

556
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,800
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes.

557
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
More than you do.

558
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,200
They questioned her for days -

559
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,640
A man-at-arms, that makes a change.

560
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:07,440
I'd like to have a lot of men like you.

561
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:10,200
Have you also come to question me?

562
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,920
I know neither A nor B.

563
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,720
The king sent me here
to be your intendant.

564
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,960
My name is Jean d'Aulon.

565
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,240
What are the names
of the English military leaders?

566
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:25,800
Orléans is under Sumolk,
Glasdale and William Pole.

567
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,840
Their leader is the Duke of Bedford,

568
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,560
who claims to be regent
of France and England.

569
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,120
- Why?
- Do you know how to write?

570
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:37,000
- Yes, of course.
- Fetch some paper and ink.

571
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,600
Write.

572
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:18,440
"King of England,
and you, Duke of Bedford,

573
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:21,200
"who claim to be regent of France,

574
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:29,520
"You, Sumort, Classidas and la Poule,

575
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:36,280
"return to the Maid,
who has been sent by God,

576
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:44,880
"the keys to all the towns that have
been seized and violated in France.

577
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:57,480
"All of you, archers, brothers in arms,

578
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,520
"and gentlemen,

579
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:05,320
"you who are before
the town of Orléans,

580
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:07,400
"return to your country.

581
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:19,440
"And if you do not,
you will hear from the Maid,

582
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:23,760
"who will join you soon,
to your great detriment.

583
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,480
"King of England, if you do not retreat,
be aware that I am a war leader

584
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,600
"and wherever I come across
your men in France

585
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,440
"I will chase them from there.

586
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:56,400
"If they will not obey,
I will have them all killed.

587
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:02,640
"I have been sent here
by the king of heaven,

588
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:07,600
"one man against another,
to chase you out of France.

589
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,040
"You, Duke of Bedford,

590
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:26,240
"the Maid entreats you
not to let yourself be destroyed.

591
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,480
"Reply if you wish for peace in Orléans.

592
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:45,000
"OtheM/ise, you will soon be sorry.

593
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:54,040
"Written on Tuesday of Holy Week."

594
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,960
Sign it for me, "The Maid".

595
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,480
Jeanne, let me say this one more time.

596
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,080
God will not let us believe in you
unless you give us a sign.

597
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:28,280
Give us a sign that will allow us
to believe in you.

598
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,280
I did not come to Poitiers
to produce signs.

599
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,240
Do you think we'll advise the king
to entrust you with an army

600
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,600
just because you want one?

601
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,000
- So that you may endanger the men?
- Send me to Orléans.

602
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:52,480
I will show you the signs
for which I was sent.

603
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:57,920
Give me these men-at-arms and I'll show you
the signs for which I was sent.

604
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:18,840
According to you, God wishes to
deliver the French from their troubles.

605
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,920
But if that's what He wants,
He doesn't need men-at-arms.

606
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,400
His will should sumice.

607
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:37,920
In God's name, the men-at-arms will fight,
and God will grant victory.

608
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:52,080
These are my signs.

609
01:15:52,119 --> 01:15:54,120
I'll go to Orléans,

610
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,400
and the English will be defeated,

611
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:02,200
the siege will be lifted,

612
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,280
and the town will be freed.

613
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:10,200
After that,
the dauphin will go to Rheims,

614
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,880
where he will be anointed king.

615
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:22,360
Then Paris will return its allegiance
to the king.

616
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:31,600
And finally, the Lord of Orléans
will return from his captivity in England.

617
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,280
That's all I have to say.

618
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,080
You can leave now.

619
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,640
I
As no fault could be found in her

620
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:38,120
the king must not stop her
from going to Orléans

621
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,040
with an army.

622
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:50,160
But he must ensure
that she is given proper support

623
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:56,080
and put his trust in God.

624
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,840
To spurn or abandon her

625
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:08,840
would be to reject the Holy Spirit

626
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:17,000
and render oneself unwon'thy
of God's help.

627
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:22,040
Once this report was sent to the king
by the Doctors of the Church,

628
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:25,280
Jeanne was entrusted to
the Queen of Sicily,

629
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:29,120
Yolande of Aragon,
the mother of our queen,

630
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:33,240
and the ladies of Preuilly
and of Mortemer

631
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:37,200
by whom this virgin
was secretly examined

632
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:40,040
in the secret parts of her body.

633
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:18,000
I already knew, before they did,

634
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:20,440
that there is nothing
shameful about you.

635
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:25,440
- They thought I was a boy.
- They needed proof.

636
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,560
You have inspired the dauphin
with new enthusiasm.

637
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:34,200
But he is not a king yet.

638
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,920
Charles was 11 when he married
my daughter, Marie of Anjou.

639
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:44,360
Since then I've looked after him
as if I were his mother.

640
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:50,560
I've put all my will, all my power,

641
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,600
toward restoring
his wisdom and strength.

642
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,000
But I feel alone.

643
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,800
And here you are.

644
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,720
The kingdom of France
is now no more than a tattered rag

645
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,760
about to fall apart.

646
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:12,480
Let us pray that with your help

647
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,640
we might finally be able to repair
the damage caused by Queen Isabella.

648
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,080
I will assist you.

649
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:27,600
I have turned my gold dishes into
arms and provisions for your soldiers.

650
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,720
Baudricourt was not mistaken.

651
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,520
Why do you mention him, madame?

652
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,000
He told me you would be coming.

653
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:43,360
He didn't believe me at first.

654
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,720
Can I leave now,

655
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,120
and do what I came to do?

656
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:58,600
In Tours, you will find armour
I had made for you.

657
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,760
And the road awaits you,

658
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,400
with battles much fiercer
than those fought with words.

659
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:09,840
- That does not frighten me.
- Go, Jeanne,

660
01:21:11,479 --> 01:21:14,120
and may God keep you.

661
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,720
I followed Jeanne to Tours.

662
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:31,080
There, her armour
was made to measure

663
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:34,280
and the king put her in command.

664
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:38,840
Hauves Poulnoir,
a Scottish painter who lived in Tours,

665
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,880
made her banner.

666
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:46,480
There, she was approached by
Brother Jean Pasquerel,

667
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,320
back from a pilgrimage to Le Puy,

668
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:53,000
where Isabelle Romée,
Jeanne's mother, had also been.

669
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:55,680
She had asked him
to meet up with her daughter.

670
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:02,040
Jeanne left Tours for Blois,

671
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:05,880
where the king's army
was assembling,

672
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,360
but, without waiting
for the men to be ready,

673
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:12,720
she decided to go to Orléans
with a company of men-at-arms.

674
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:20,040
And this company, from then on,
had great faith in her.

675
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,320
- You don't look pleased.
- There are banners.

676
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,000
Have they painted them?
One can see them a mile om.

677
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:55,040
They're coming from the west.

678
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:57,200
It's been like this for two weeks.

679
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:04,760
Our good king is finally
shifting his arse.

680
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,800
He's sending us men, provisions.

681
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,200
The wind says no,
they won't enter the town.

682
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:19,080
- That means we're here for nothing.
- Not for nothing.

683
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:23,320
To give thanks to the king
who has finally decided to help us.

684
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:27,600
I don't place much faith
in the king's help,

685
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,760
- let alone a little girl's.
- She may be that,

686
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,480
but she knows how to sit in a saddle.

687
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,360
- Are you the Bastard of Orléans?
- I am he,

688
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:53,120
- and I'm delighted that you are here.
- I am not delighted.

689
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:58,640
Did you give the order that
I should come to this side of the river

690
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:02,160
and not straight ahead,
to where Talbot and the English are?

691
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:10,840
I made the decision along with others,
such as Lord Gaucourt here.

692
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:18,280
If you'd gone straight ahead,
you'd have faced their arrows.

693
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,760
This seemed wiser and safer.

694
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:31,360
In God's name, the counsel of God our Lord
is wiser and safer than yours.

695
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:39,080
You sought to deceive me,
but you deceive yourselves.

696
01:24:41,079 --> 01:24:47,480
I am here to bring you aid,
better aid than that of any army,

697
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,120
the aid of the king of heaven.

698
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,160
Does He send it out of love for you?

699
01:24:52,199 --> 01:24:56,680
Not out of love for me, but at the request
of St Louis and St Charlemagne,

700
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,760
- because He took pity on Orléans.
- It's a great comfort.

701
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,760
We no longer knew
which saint to turn to.

702
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,680
Don't look so disgusted.
Jeanne is a sign from heaven.

703
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,760
And what's more, she's bringing
you earthly goods, meat and wheat.

704
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,320
Trouble is, everything will rot here.

705
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:21,440
What do you mean,
everything will rot?

706
01:25:21,479 --> 01:25:25,320
Didrt your advisor tell you?
Our boats aren't working.

707
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:33,160
I
The wind blows where it will
and it is against us,

708
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,080
so long as it blows from the west,
towards the sea.

709
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,880
My God.

710
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:56,280
Quick, let's head for the town!

711
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:00,160
Alert the people of Orléans.
Get the boats over here.

712
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:10,480
Nice pennon. Is it an Annunciation?

713
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:14,000
Can't you see it's Our Lady,
with an angel handing her a lily?

714
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:16,880
As I was saying, it's very beautiful.

715
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:25,160
In Blois, we had loaded
several chariots with wheat,

716
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:30,360
and had brought along oxen, sheep,
cows, pigs and other provisions.

717
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:34,800
And we had set om, guided by the Lord
and by Gilles de Laval,

718
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,480
who was devoted to the Maid.

719
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:46,440
I knew it.
You belong to God and not to man.

720
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:54,960
You are the angel Raphael,
sent to save us.

721
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,080
- Give me your hand.
- Stop it. I'm none of those things.

722
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:02,920
Jeanne! Come with me.
It's nightfall.

723
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,880
The whole town awaits you.
They want to see you, to touch you.

724
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,920
Arert we ousting the English?

725
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,160
I know we'll get on,
if only you can learn to be patient.

726
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:24,920
So the Maid entered Orléans.

727
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,480
I stood to her left.

728
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:33,200
She was met by other soldiers,
by the people of Orléans,

729
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:39,120
carrying torches and displaying
the kind ofjoy they would have shown

730
01:27:39,159 --> 01:27:41,600
if God Himself had come among them.

731
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:46,480
There was a great press of people
hoping to touch her.

732
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:52,920
And one of those bearing a torch
came so close to her

733
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,080
that her pennon caught fire.

734
01:27:56,119 --> 01:28:01,120
So she spurred on her horse

735
01:28:01,159 --> 01:28:04,760
and turned him gently round
towards the pennon

736
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:09,600
whose fire she put out as though
she were an experienced soldier.

737
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:16,960
The men-at-arms and the people
of Orléans were amazed

738
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,120
and led her deferentially across town

739
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:24,480
to the house of Jacques Boucher,
who was the treasurer of Orléans.

740
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:41,960
Put that down at once.

741
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,880
Girls shouldn't play
with mers armour.

742
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,720
I wonder where you find the strength,
Madame Jeanne.

743
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,240
Everyone says that you are so upright,
so haughty on horseback.

744
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:57,600
Is it true that you've routed the English?

745
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:01,080
Charlotte, can't you see
Madame Jeanne is tired?

746
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:04,440
I hope there'll be no hullabaloo
and that you'll sleep well.

747
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:09,800
My husband is so proud
to have you as our guest.

748
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,640
Please, I would like for you to touch it.

749
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,280
- Why?
- So it will be blessed, Madame Jeanne.

750
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:29,320
Hand it to Charlotte, her touch
will bless it as much as mine would.

751
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,760
You see? I'm not as bad as you think.

752
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:40,320
- How about saying your prayers?
- We always pray together before bed.

753
01:29:40,359 --> 01:29:43,400
- Then the three of us will pray.
- With Dagobert?

754
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:46,160
Dagobert is hiding. He's the cat.

755
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:48,520
He's my cat.

756
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,000
- What else do you need?
- Arrows for our crossbows.

757
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:11,000
- How many?
- About 10,OOO.

758
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:13,280
Maybe 20,OOO.

759
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:15,360
We need them.

760
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:17,840
That's a heavy expense
for the town to bear.

761
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,120
Can't the king contribute something?

762
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:24,560
The king is like Job on his dunghill.

763
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,640
If I were to rely on his finances,
I may as well stay here.

764
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:36,440
How much for, shall we say,
15,OOO arrows or thereabouts?

765
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,520
500 livres.

766
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,600
And powder.

767
01:31:01,239 --> 01:31:03,480
And lead shot for the culverins.

768
01:31:05,479 --> 01:31:11,280
How much for powder, saltpetre,
grapeshot, including containers?

769
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,760
- 250 livres?
- 300.

770
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:24,480
I can't do more.

771
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:29,680
We must also feed the population.
It isn't easy.

772
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:34,720
- I can't do more.
- I'm asking on behalf of your saviours.

773
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,440
We can but hope.

774
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,720
2T5.

775
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:59,160
- When will you be back?
- When I have everything,

776
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:02,160
the munitions,
the provisions and the men,

777
01:32:02,199 --> 01:32:04,760
- with the help of the king.
- May he help you.

778
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,680
Sign there.

779
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,360
Bastard, something must be done.

780
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:32,840
Do what? For whom?

781
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,080
Thank you.

782
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:51,080
I've lost my messengers.
The English have kept them prisoner.

783
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:54,640
That's not done.
I'll send them a warning.

784
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:58,440
- Don't worry, they'll give them back.
- Good.

785
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:01,960
- From what side shall we attack tomorrow?
- None.

786
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,840
We won't attack tomorrow.

787
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,120
Are you doing this to try me?

788
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:09,000
I told you to be patient.

789
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:13,440
I'm going back to Blois
to gather the rest of the army.

790
01:33:13,479 --> 01:33:16,200
We'll act upon my return.
Not a moment earlier.

791
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:19,000
- Why am I here, then?
- To wait for me.

792
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:21,040
And to serve me.

793
01:33:22,039 --> 01:33:26,360
I'm in charge of this town
and I expect everyone to obey me,

794
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:28,400
even yOU.

795
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:33,120
Even if St Michael, St Catherine,
St Louis and St Charlemagne

796
01:33:33,159 --> 01:33:35,880
all told you to attack on your own.

797
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:40,680
I order you, in the king's name,
not to do anything until I get back

798
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,920
except eat, drink and sleep.

799
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,040
It will do you a lot of good.
Goodbye.

800
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:04,240
Christ! My nice doublet.

801
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:11,360
- What's wrong with you?
- Cross yourself before the cross.

802
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:14,360
- Because I snagged my doublet?
- Because you swore!

803
01:34:16,279 --> 01:34:18,600
I'm sorry.

804
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,640
It slipped out.

805
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,720
- I won't do it again.
- You keep saying that.

806
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,400
It's as if you'd all ganged up
to demoralise me.

807
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:32,720
- But you won't succeed.
- What are you talking about?

808
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,760
I haven't ganged up with anyone.

809
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,840
- I'm your brother.
- That makes it even worse.

810
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,120
If I catch you at it again...

811
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:45,320
Show me that snag.

812
01:34:46,359 --> 01:34:49,400
It's nothing. Go on, get out of here.

813
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:54,040
You'd better practise
your fencing with Louis.

814
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:57,560
- You hold your sword like a stick.
- Your wish is my command, Captain!

815
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,360
I'm in no mood for joking, you rascal.

816
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:03,240
Go to confession!

817
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:05,840
You foul-mouth! Triple penance.

818
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:10,840
- You'll fast all week.
- I'll eat nails.

819
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,320
Stop, stop. You're frightening me.

820
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:17,680
My word, if the English could see you,
they'd pack their bags right now,

821
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:21,640
without putting up a fight.
Your eyes are shining with the fire of hell.

822
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:25,520
Don't say that.

823
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,720
Don't ever say that,

824
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,120
not even in jest.

825
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:35,760
Jeanne, forgive me.

826
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,520
Jeanne, in the name of...

827
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,400
In the name of a little
gingerbread man.

828
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:51,120
I didn't mean to upset you.
Forgive me. I won't do it again.

829
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:53,240
You keep saying that.

830
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,520
- What did they do to him?
- We found him like this at the door.

831
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,560
Look how hungry he is.

832
01:36:18,199 --> 01:36:20,960
Poor man,
it's the Goddamns who did this to him.

833
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,120
They didn't appreciate your message.

834
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:26,480
Where's Guienne?

835
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:31,160
They kept the other one.
They want to burn him alive.

836
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:35,320
They can't do that!
It's uneard of to burn a messenger.

837
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:38,680
Here's their reply to your message.

838
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,600
Could you read it for me?
I don't know how.

839
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:51,680
"From Talbot, Army Chief,
to the self-styled Maid.

840
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,400
"You are no more than a brazen wench
and, as such,

841
01:36:54,439 --> 01:37:00,320
"we order you to go tend your cows,
unless you want to be burned alive."

842
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:02,840
It's short, but explicit.

843
01:37:04,039 --> 01:37:06,200
They'll see!

844
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:27,040
Open this for me.

845
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:32,640
Glasdale!

846
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,760
Glasdale!

847
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:40,360
- Who is calling?
- It's the Maid!

848
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,400
In God's name,
I demand that you leave!

849
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:48,520
You demand what?

850
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:52,280
I fear he is a bit deaf.

851
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:55,200
Do you need a strong voice?

852
01:37:55,239 --> 01:38:00,560
Don't worry.
With La Hire, they're sure to hear.

853
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:05,400
Tell them to lift the siege,
in the name of God,

854
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:08,880
or else I shall throw them out
and do them great harm.

855
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,760
You'd better set sail,

856
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,960
you bunch of pink scallops!

857
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,720
Just tell them what I said,
nothing else.

858
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,880
You'd better leave!

859
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:24,800
In the name of God.

860
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:28,400
Or we will forcibly boot you out!

861
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:31,400
- Is that it?
- More or less.

862
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,920
Go back to your cows, you witch!

863
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,280
You're lying!

864
01:38:45,319 --> 01:38:48,120
I think they got the message.
No point in lingering.

865
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:51,040
Why do they say such things?
I didn't insult them.

866
01:38:51,079 --> 01:38:54,600
No, La Hire's the one
who got a bit carried away.

867
01:38:56,119 --> 01:38:59,680
So you're La Hire?
Is it true what they say about you?

868
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:02,560
That grass no longer grows
where you've passed by?

869
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:05,040
That's someone else. I just make war.

870
01:39:05,079 --> 01:39:07,520
With me, you'll have to do it dimerently.

871
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:14,080
When speaking to Glasdale
and the rest of the English in the turrets,

872
01:39:14,119 --> 01:39:16,680
Jeanne was at the fort of Belle Croix,

873
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:21,680
in the middle of the bridge
between the town and the south bank.

874
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:27,480
- I need your help.
- That's what I'm here for.

875
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:31,480
- Shall I hear your confession?
- No, not every two hours.

876
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,440
I want you to teach me
to sign my name.

877
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:36,480
All military leaders do it.

878
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:40,520
I want to be able to sign letters myself.

879
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:15,640
Is that my signature?

880
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,160
Yes.

881
01:40:18,319 --> 01:40:20,320
Give me the pen.

882
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,240
Is that how I should hold it?

883
01:40:28,279 --> 01:40:30,280
Like this.

884
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:35,480
Now just imitate the line,
as if it were a drawing.

885
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,120
Jeanne's a simple name.

886
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:55,800
If I had to sign the Bastard of Orléans,
I don't know what I'd do.

887
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,960
- Your H.
- What about it?

888
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:16,600
Make a loop, like this.

889
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:24,720
- What's that H for?
- Nothing.

890
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:27,960
It's like an E. It's a silent letter.

891
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,200
How many silent letters
are in my name?

892
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:34,800
Three. There, there and there.

893
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,360
That's not too pretty.

894
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:56,640
Make your J longer.

895
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:58,760
Start again.

896
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:08,360
Go on, try again.

897
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:22,680
Wheat, oats, wheat, oats.
I see nothing about munitions.

898
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:26,920
The fortress accounts are... here.

899
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:29,520
All that section is about weapons.

900
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,840
Weapons? Are we fighting, then?

901
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,120
We're preparing to, Madame Jeanne.

902
01:42:35,159 --> 01:42:37,600
Everyone believes in it now.

903
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:40,520
To Jean Volant,
for 11 days as a carpenter

904
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,560
and 14 days as a stonemason,
and who worked setting up the cannon

905
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,840
at the tower by the orchards
of St Samson,

906
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,600
101 sous and four deniers.

907
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:55,960
Raoulet de Recourt,
for lodging the Maid, 20 sous.

908
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,520
Since the siege, everything's become
expensive. Men, wood, even fish.

909
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:04,360
- Yes.
- How many cannons do we have?

910
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:06,400
How much gunpowder?

911
01:43:06,439 --> 01:43:08,680
I wouldn't mind another drink.

912
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:22,960
Read it to me, so I can get an idea.

913
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,280
To Jean, the mason,
for the crossbows he made for the town...

914
01:43:27,319 --> 01:43:29,360
Ermine!

915
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:34,360
Don't use the same wine,
it's a bit sour.

916
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:36,880
It is sour.
Why didn't I notice that earlier?

917
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:39,680
Here. I'll be with you in a minute.

918
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,760
Shall I fry the fish?

919
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:47,480
Wait a while. She barely eats a thing.

920
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,520
I'll talk to you later.

921
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,600
- Run along.
- What if she doesn't want any?

922
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:58,000
It won't go to waste,
I can assure you.

923
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,400
For a sieve to separate powder,
ten sous.

924
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:05,640
To five men who prepared the powder,

925
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:09,280
two sous and eight deniers each,
per day.

926
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:13,320
To Jean Mahy, for a gift
made to three wounded Scotsmen

927
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:16,280
to help them live, 48 sous.

928
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:22,160
To Charlot le Long,
for three pairs of greaves and of chausses

929
01:44:22,199 --> 01:44:24,480
for the Maid's brother...

930
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:29,160
- Moving on...
- Yes.

931
01:44:32,119 --> 01:44:37,120
To Jacquet Compaing, for having
carried cannonballs across the river

932
01:44:37,159 --> 01:44:40,760
five sous and three deniers.
There are good people in this town.

933
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,080
Yes, marvellous.

934
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:48,160
Have you heard of Jean the culveriner?

935
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,480
What a man!

936
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:55,720
If they were all like him,
we wouldn't need anyone's help.

937
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,200
Present company excepted.

938
01:44:59,239 --> 01:45:02,880
Besides, he's from Lorraine,
from Montesclère, near your home town.

939
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,400
The things he's done with his culverin!

940
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:13,480
Last winter, he'd go to the boulevard
at La Belle Croix and shoot at them.

941
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:17,000
Who knows how many of them
he killed or wounded?

942
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:21,080
And then, when they responded
with arrows, he'd play dead.

943
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:25,640
So we'd carry him away and we could
hear the English shouting for joy.

944
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:30,320
And then he'd come back, and bam!
They soon figured out it was still him.

945
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,040
La Hire.

946
01:45:51,079 --> 01:45:53,520
I'm looking for my pages,
Raymond and Louis.

947
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:59,920
- I was told they were here.
- Come closer, watch and learn.

948
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:05,200
FoM/ard! What are they up to?
They seem to be weakening.

949
01:46:05,239 --> 01:46:07,680
FoM/ard! They're all yours!

950
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:19,520
- So, Maid, which one's yours?
- Him at the front, with the red hair.

951
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:23,520
- That's Raymond.
- Capo d'Oro! He's my favourite!

952
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:27,680
- Ten livres says he'll be first on the island.
- 20 livres on Tête-Noire. He's mine.

953
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,800
FoM/ard, Capo d'Oro!

954
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,840
Fling them into the water!

955
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:34,040
Into the water!

956
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:46,160
Hey, you bunch of nancies!

957
01:46:58,039 --> 01:47:00,880
- It's their fight.
- But he's bleeding.

958
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:06,320
It's nothing! He took fright.

959
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:08,760
Raymond got two of them!

960
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,960
Long live Raymond!

961
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,200
- You bet on the wrong man.
- Not necessarily.

962
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:17,680
- Come on, Tête-Noire!
- A cry for Capo d'Oro!

963
01:47:18,199 --> 01:47:21,920
Capo d'Oro! Capo d'Oro!

964
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,360
Louis! Cover him!

965
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:26,640
Go foM/ard!

966
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,160
You, in blue, attack from the right!

967
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:31,360
Go on! Further!

968
01:47:31,399 --> 01:47:33,520
You, in white! Don't hold back!

969
01:48:00,199 --> 01:48:02,960
Xaintrailles! Yes, it's him!

970
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,400
- Xaintrailles, 20 livres.
- Can it wait until tomorrow?

971
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:21,040
Jeanne, remove from my eyes
the terrible things I see at night.

972
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:26,000
I am Jeanne.

973
01:48:26,039 --> 01:48:28,120
What can I do for you?

974
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:31,240
My son hasn't come back
for two nights.

975
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:34,160
He left with the soldiers.

976
01:48:34,199 --> 01:48:36,560
He's still a child.

977
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:42,040
If your son left with the soldiers,
that's a good thing.

978
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:44,440
He's a good son of Orléans.

979
01:48:44,479 --> 01:48:46,520
They're doing their duty.

980
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:49,600
As soon as we've chased away
the English, he'll be back.

981
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:53,560
Jeanne, I would have liked
to have had a son like you.

982
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,800
Since he's fighting, he's like me.

983
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:59,480
Go, have no fear.

984
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,240
That's how it is.

985
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:18,560
Children leave their mothers.

986
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:21,680
Jesus also did. It must be done.

987
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,920
- It's strange you should say that.
- Why?

988
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,800
I didn't want to tell you.
Mother didn't want us to tell you.

989
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,840
We're in this together now.

990
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:38,080
It's about Father.

991
01:49:39,079 --> 01:49:42,520
In a dream,
he saw you by a leafless forest.

992
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:45,640
You were leaving
without a bac_ard glance.

993
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:48,520
You were leaving forever
with a band of men in armour.

994
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:54,480
- That's almost it.
- Yes, but then he told Jean and me

995
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,560
that if ever it should really happen,

996
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:01,040
we should both
go and drown you in the Meuse.

997
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:06,520
Would you have done it?

998
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,120
He also said that if we didn't have
the nerve to do it, he would.

999
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:20,480
Have you ever seen
any drowned people?

1000
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:23,360
I
A deer

1001
01:50:23,399 --> 01:50:26,360
in the freezing water near Burey.

1002
01:50:26,399 --> 01:50:28,680
He was as bloated as a full wineskin.

1003
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:33,800
And I haven't seen an Englishman
in that state yet.

1004
01:50:35,399 --> 01:50:40,880
Go along. And before you fall asleep,
pray Father recovers trust in me.

1005
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:59,120
On the Wednesday, the fourth day of May,
the Bastard of Orléans came back

1006
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:02,400
with the soldiers and provisions
he'd gone to seek in Blois

1007
01:51:02,439 --> 01:51:05,240
to support the town.

1008
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:09,120
As soon as she heard they had arrived,
the Maid got on her horse

1009
01:51:09,159 --> 01:51:12,600
and went to meet them, with her men,
to give them assistance,

1010
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,680
should they have needed it.

1011
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:19,720
And at dusk,
the army went into the town,

1012
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:22,920
in full sight of the enemy,
unopposed.

1013
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,880
Have you ever fought, Louis?

1014
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,360
No, Madame Jeanne, never.

1015
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:40,000
- Will we fight tomorrow?
- Tomorrow? No.

1016
01:51:40,039 --> 01:51:42,280
Tomorrow's Ascension Day.

1017
01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:44,760
You don't want to fight
on Ascension Day?

1018
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,880
I just do as you say.

1019
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,920
You can go to your room. Go and rest.

1020
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:24,920
Wake up, quickly!

1021
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:26,560
You nasty boy,

1022
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:29,920
you didn't tell me the blood of France
was being spilled.

1023
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:33,480
We're fighting. We're fighting,
but I don't know where.

1024
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:36,240
Hurry, get up. Go and get my horse.

1025
01:52:36,279 --> 01:52:39,880
- Can I help with your armour?
- There's no time. Hurry.

1026
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:43,840
Pierre, hurry. Get up.
There's a fight on.

1027
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:49,680
Get up! Help Pierre with his armour.

1028
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:58,760
What's going on? What's happening?

1029
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,480
There's a fight on.

1030
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,760
My voices tell me to attack the English.

1031
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:06,520
Can you help me with my armour?

1032
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:14,960
Charlotte, go and get the legs.

1033
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:25,280
No, it's the other leg.

1034
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:31,440
- Does it hurt?
- No.

1035
01:53:31,479 --> 01:53:34,160
What hurts me
is that I'm not already there.

1036
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:48,880
My sword.

1037
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,640
My sword.

1038
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:32,160
Louis, my banner, where is it?

1039
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:34,360
Pay attention, will you?

1040
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:41,240
It's in Saint-Loup,
before the Burgundy gate.

1041
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,320
- Who's attacking? The English or us?
- It's us. We decided to take it.

1042
01:54:46,359 --> 01:54:49,640
I don't know who gave the order.
Perhaps nobody did.

1043
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:55,000
Louis, hand it to me
through the window.

1044
01:54:55,039 --> 01:54:57,160
Through the window there.

1045
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:13,440
Saint-Loup,
on the evening of May 4th -

1046
01:55:52,359 --> 01:55:55,560
Don't cry, Jeannette. They're English.

1047
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,640
I'd never seen...

1048
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:01,240
- It's ugly. It's war.
- It's horrible.

1049
01:56:01,279 --> 01:56:03,400
We won the day.

1050
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:06,320
Yes, we won the day.

1051
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:11,640
Bless them, Lord.

1052
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:16,160
Take pity on them.

1053
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:20,800
Gather them into your heart.

1054
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,840
Amen.

1055
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:41,360
We were asleep last night.

1056
01:56:41,399 --> 01:56:44,160
They've cleared the Burgundy gate.

1057
01:56:44,199 --> 01:56:47,080
- We should take advantage of that.
- Why go there?

1058
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:49,240
They're all on the other side.

1059
01:56:49,279 --> 01:56:53,080
Exactly. Let's attack from the west.
The Paris gate.

1060
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:57,200
You fool, we'd be one against 50.
You're dreaming.

1061
01:56:57,239 --> 01:56:59,440
It would be suicide.

1062
01:57:01,439 --> 01:57:05,120
No, we keep coming back to it.

1063
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:09,760
The south bank. Les Tourelles.

1064
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:12,600
The fortress at the end of the bridge.

1065
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:16,160
It can't be done.
There are too few of us there too.

1066
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:19,440
Who says there are too few of us?

1067
01:57:22,119 --> 01:57:26,520
It's me, Gaucourt.
And many would agree with me.

1068
01:57:36,199 --> 01:57:40,280
- You came.
- The dauphin gave me a command.

1069
01:57:43,439 --> 01:57:46,920
Should I not be involved?

1070
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:49,800
We thought you were praying.
It's Ascension Day.

1071
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:52,800
- You said you'd not do anything.
- I went to Communion.

1072
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:54,840
I attended my council.

1073
01:57:56,199 --> 01:57:59,000
Is that a good reason
to keep me away from yours?

1074
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:01,040
What do you fear from me?

1075
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:03,920
We don't seek an adventure.

1076
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:06,040
You've been here four days.

1077
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:10,000
We've been under siege
for six months.

1078
01:58:10,039 --> 01:58:13,520
Who ever mentioned an adventure?
I'm here to fight.

1079
01:58:16,399 --> 01:58:18,400
The soldiers will follow me.

1080
01:58:19,439 --> 01:58:21,600
They'll obtain what they did elsewhere.

1081
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:25,440
Tell me where to go and I'll follow you.

1082
01:58:25,479 --> 01:58:27,720
I'm the one with the most men.

1083
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,760
Jeanne, Gaucourt is right.

1084
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:32,800
There are more Englishmen around
than there are rats.

1085
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:35,800
- I know because I've eaten some.
- Some Englishmen?

1086
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:39,600
You should have asked me around.

1087
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:45,080
They outnumber us five to one,
and they're expecting reinforcements.

1088
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:51,400
I know one of their greatest captains,
Fastolf, was in Janville yesterday.

1089
01:58:51,439 --> 01:58:53,440
And you were hiding this from me?

1090
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,920
Bastard, Bastard,
in God's name I command you

1091
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:03,400
to tell me where he is
as soon as you know.

1092
01:59:03,439 --> 01:59:08,000
Because if he comes without my being
informed of it, I'll have you beheaded.

1093
01:59:08,039 --> 01:59:10,040
You scare me.

1094
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,080
You'll be told.

1095
01:59:14,119 --> 01:59:18,080
By the blood of Christ,
we'll kill them all!

1096
01:59:18,119 --> 01:59:22,520
Be quiet! You poison the air
with your blasphemy.

1097
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:27,440
If I hear you take our Lord's name
in vain again, I'll have you cut in three!

1098
01:59:27,479 --> 01:59:30,960
How will you manage, La Hire?
Should we put a muzzle on you?

1099
01:59:32,439 --> 01:59:37,000
- It would suit you.
- Shut up. You owe me 20 livres.

1100
01:59:37,039 --> 01:59:39,040
By blood and mucus...

1101
01:59:39,079 --> 01:59:42,280
I don't know how to speak
without swearing.

1102
01:59:42,319 --> 01:59:44,840
Say what I say - by my stam.

1103
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:49,200
- Isn't that enough?
- By my stam.

1104
01:59:49,239 --> 01:59:55,280
- The men will piss themselves.
- I want them to be as pure as lilies.

1105
01:59:55,319 --> 01:59:58,640
You want to win?
Then you must be pure.

1106
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:01,040
That's the message I bring you.

1107
02:00:02,199 --> 02:00:05,360
Don't laugh. Listen to her.

1108
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:09,400
We've been punished for our sins.

1109
02:00:09,439 --> 02:00:13,000
She's our redeemer.

1110
02:00:14,319 --> 02:00:18,240
I agree, but we're here to act.

1111
02:00:22,479 --> 02:00:24,480
How far had you got?

1112
02:00:27,479 --> 02:00:29,480
Here.

1113
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:36,600
If we can seize back Les Tourelles,
the fortress at the end of the bridge,

1114
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:42,120
then we open up the southern route

1115
02:00:42,159 --> 02:00:44,680
and their siege falls into disarray.

1116
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:48,600
- But that's unrealistic.
- Why?

1117
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,760
There are over 300 of them in there,
armed to the teeth.

1118
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:55,120
Glasdale is their leader.
He's a pig, but not a donkey.

1119
02:00:57,159 --> 02:01:01,320
Here's the fortress of the Augustins.

1120
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:07,000
Before that, St Jean-le-Blanc.

1121
02:01:08,439 --> 02:01:11,080
- We'll never make it there.
- We will.

1122
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:18,960
The island?

1123
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,640
We must be able to do
what our pages did.

1124
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:24,840
By my arse, if...

1125
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,480
By my stam, if we can't
get these buggers from the rear...

1126
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,760
I'll become a monk.

1127
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,920
What do you think?

1128
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,800
It's a big risk.

1129
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,480
We don't know how many of them
are there.

1130
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:46,600
Well, this way we'll find out.

1131
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Where are you going?

1132
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:53,040
To tell them the news.

1133
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,600
If they don't leave quietly,
their defeat will be remembered forever.

1134
02:02:20,319 --> 02:02:23,000
Wait. Add something.

1135
02:02:26,199 --> 02:02:28,200
"And what's more...

1136
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:34,240
"I could have sent you my letter
a better way,

1137
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:40,720
"but you hold captive my messenger,
Guienne.

1138
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:51,080
"Give him back to me
and I will return some of your men

1139
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,960
"captured at Saint-Loup,

1140
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:59,000
"seeing as they didn't all die."

1141
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:19,800
Allow me, Madame Jeanne.

1142
02:03:25,319 --> 02:03:27,960
Read it! It contains news!

1143
02:03:37,479 --> 02:03:39,480
What are they saying?

1144
02:03:41,279 --> 02:03:43,720
I don't know.

1145
02:03:45,159 --> 02:03:47,320
News from the whore!

1146
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:49,720
The Armagnacs' whore!

1147
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,880
The Armagnacs' whore!

1148
02:03:53,479 --> 02:03:56,440
That's not true! I'm nothing of the sort!

1149
02:03:56,479 --> 02:04:00,920
- Come on, calm down.
- I'd rather they throw stones at me

1150
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:03,560
- than call me that.
- That's why they do it.

1151
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:06,000
Don't show you're upset. Come along.

1152
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:11,800
What you did was horrible!
You'll be punished for it!

1153
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:14,080
They know that now.

1154
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:21,040
The following day, as planned,
the Maid and our men left the town

1155
02:04:21,079 --> 02:04:23,960
to cross certain islands of the Loire.

1156
02:04:25,239 --> 02:04:29,200
And to cross the other arm of the river
they brought along two boats

1157
02:04:29,239 --> 02:04:34,240
which they used as a bridge to reach
the fortress of St Jean-le-Blanc.

1158
02:04:34,279 --> 02:04:38,920
We found it deserted,
because the English, seeing us coming,

1159
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:44,240
retreated to a stronger and bigger fortress,
that of the Augustins,

1160
02:04:45,039 --> 02:04:47,280
and we followed them there.

1161
02:05:28,239 --> 02:05:32,160
Soon after that,
we stormed the Augustins.

1162
02:05:32,199 --> 02:05:35,920
Most of the enemy soldiers
were taken and killed there.

1163
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:40,520
Those who could, sought refuge
by the bridge, at Les Tourelles.

1164
02:06:18,319 --> 02:06:22,600
And we remained outside
the large fortress, with the Maid,

1165
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:24,640
for the whole of that night.

1166
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:28,400
The people of Orléans made
great haste to bring us bread,

1167
02:06:28,439 --> 02:06:31,280
wine and other provisions.
They sharpened our axes,

1168
02:06:31,319 --> 02:06:35,000
brought torches, sewed bags,

1169
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:37,600
and prepared ladders.

1170
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:42,160
I remember having paid two livres
for a pheasant and a wine cask

1171
02:06:42,199 --> 02:06:44,200
for the Maid.

1172
02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:49,960
For though she fasted on Fridays,
she was very tired, and dined that night.

1173
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:07,400
Father, stay close to me at all times.

1174
02:07:07,439 --> 02:07:09,520
Fear not, Jeanne.

1175
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:17,240
- Havert you slept enough?
- My horse slept in my stead.

1176
02:07:18,359 --> 02:07:22,560
- I worry about your feet, Father.
- God made me as poor as can be,

1177
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:24,280
but I'm not barefoot.

1178
02:07:24,319 --> 02:07:28,360
Louis, take good care of my standard.

1179
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:36,480
What's wrong? You don't look well.

1180
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:38,880
No, Madame Jeanne, I'm fine.

1181
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:41,280
If you say so.
He had the runs all night.

1182
02:07:41,319 --> 02:07:43,880
Keep out of it.

1183
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:47,480
It's not true. You can count on me.

1184
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:50,120
I know, Louis.

1185
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:52,640
We'll see if you're
still laughing later on.

1186
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:54,320
Who's laughing?

1187
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:58,440
The Tth of May, 1429,
in the morning -

1188
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,520
See how pure this water is, Jeanne.

1189
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:05,200
Like you, it is pure and transparent.

1190
02:08:07,439 --> 02:08:11,400
Have you been struck by an arrow?

1191
02:08:11,439 --> 02:08:13,760
By divine grace, you mean.

1192
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:16,120
He thinks he's a reliquary.

1193
02:08:16,159 --> 02:08:18,320
It is a relic.

1194
02:08:18,359 --> 02:08:22,280
It's part of the true cross
on which our merciful Lord died.

1195
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:25,600
Touch it. Touch it,
that way you'll be invincible.

1196
02:08:27,279 --> 02:08:31,640
You don't believe me?
It comes from the Holy Land.

1197
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:33,880
You bought that too?

1198
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:36,560
I gave 30,OOO gold écus
to a Lombard merchant.

1199
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:38,600
It wasrt enough.

1200
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:49,160
Come over here with me.

1201
02:08:56,359 --> 02:08:58,640
We'll let the infantry attack first.

1202
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:02,000
If they get through, we rush in.

1203
02:09:04,399 --> 02:09:06,400
Not before.

1204
02:09:08,279 --> 02:09:10,400
Fine.

1205
02:09:10,439 --> 02:09:13,720
- Then?
- We'll do it again,

1206
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:18,280
- as many times as it takes.
- And I say, in God's name,

1207
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:21,520
we will enter the town this night,
by the bridge.

1208
02:09:23,359 --> 02:09:27,440
Bastard, I want to be part
of the first onslaught.

1209
02:09:27,479 --> 02:09:29,480
As you wish.

1210
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,920
Lord God, do for La Hire
what you would like La Hire to do for you,

1211
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:47,680
if you were La Hire
and La Hire were God.

1212
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:52,040
- What were you saying?
- Nothing. It's my personal prayer.

1213
02:09:52,079 --> 02:09:54,760
- La Hire.
- What?

1214
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:57,240
Find me a prayer.

1215
02:11:31,159 --> 02:11:34,040
Pull. Come on, pull.

1216
02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:36,240
Pull, for God's sake!

1217
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:39,480
Quick, the ladder!

1218
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:42,880
FoM/ard!

1219
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:47,640
FoM/ard!

1220
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:13,800
By the middle of the day,
after many assaults -

1221
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,080
- Can you give me a hand?
- Coming.

1222
02:14:29,319 --> 02:14:33,120
That's good. Lift the end a bit.

1223
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:37,760
That's good.
Let's make something sturdy, lads.

1224
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:40,920
Ten men will be climbing up this later.

1225
02:16:32,079 --> 02:16:34,080
It hurts.

1226
02:16:35,319 --> 02:16:37,520
Be gentle. It hurts.

1227
02:16:41,639 --> 02:16:44,720
Hurry. Hurry, please.

1228
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:50,720
Pierre! Where's Pierre?

1229
02:17:09,639 --> 02:17:11,680
What are you going to do?

1230
02:17:11,719 --> 02:17:13,920
I'm going to hurt you. Set your teeth.

1231
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:23,120
Go and fetch some lard and olive oil.

1232
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:45,280
Take this. Put it on the wound.

1233
02:17:45,319 --> 02:17:47,480
- It'll stop the bleeding.
- What is it?

1234
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:51,440
- It's a charm.
- No, no.

1235
02:17:51,479 --> 02:17:54,480
I don't want to use charms.
I'd rather die.

1236
02:18:09,479 --> 02:18:13,040
Have you got nothing better to do?
Bunch of layabouts. Get back!

1237
02:18:13,079 --> 02:18:15,120
Have you never seen
a wounded person?

1238
02:18:17,239 --> 02:18:20,400
- Is it bad?
- No, I don't think so.

1239
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:23,240
She's bleeding,
but nothing vital's been hit.

1240
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:25,800
Hurry, I feel as if
I'm losing all my blood.

1241
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:28,600
Stay calm. Breathe slowly.

1242
02:18:47,959 --> 02:18:51,120
- Feeling better now?
- It's horrible.

1243
02:18:56,479 --> 02:18:59,040
Pierre, I'm cold.

1244
02:19:00,079 --> 02:19:03,120
- Is it serious?
- No, she'll be fine.

1245
02:19:03,159 --> 02:19:06,320
Pierre, do you think I'll die?

1246
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:08,920
No, you won't die.

1247
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:12,840
Tell me, Father. Do you think I'll die?

1248
02:19:12,879 --> 02:19:14,880
No, you won't die.

1249
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:19,360
When you're done, leave us alone.

1250
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:27,560
There were many more onslaughts.

1251
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:31,800
But without Jeanne,
our men had lost their strength

1252
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:34,280
and their courage.

1253
02:19:34,319 --> 02:19:39,040
The English were rejoicing,
as they were sure they'd killed her.

1254
02:19:43,559 --> 02:19:46,800
What's going on, Bastard?
Have we come to a halt?

1255
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:50,160
- What about your wound?
- I can move my arm.

1256
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:53,400
Answer me. Are we withdrawing?

1257
02:19:54,479 --> 02:19:57,760
We've lost a lot of men.
They're exhausted.

1258
02:19:58,479 --> 02:20:00,960
- We must stop.
- But the day isn't over.

1259
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,760
Look, it's dusk.

1260
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:08,720
Look at you, you won't hold out.

1261
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
We'll start again tomorrow.

1262
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:14,040
Tomorrow...

1263
02:20:15,719 --> 02:20:17,440
You're right.

1264
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:21,760
You're right.
We must recover strength.

1265
02:20:21,799 --> 02:20:25,040
Go and rest. Drink, eat.

1266
02:20:25,079 --> 02:20:28,520
But don't let anyone leave.
Ask them to wait.

1267
02:20:28,559 --> 02:20:31,120
Wait for what?

1268
02:20:31,159 --> 02:20:33,280
Give me a bit of time.

1269
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:55,200
Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret,

1270
02:20:55,239 --> 02:20:57,600
archangel Michael,

1271
02:20:57,639 --> 02:21:00,000
patron saint of fighters...

1272
02:21:07,159 --> 02:21:09,160
I no longer know what to do.

1273
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
I have no strength left.

1274
02:21:14,639 --> 02:21:16,640
I'm in pain.

1275
02:21:17,879 --> 02:21:20,080
I feel like throwing up.

1276
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:28,040
The blood of France is flowing.

1277
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:30,360
Should any more be shed?

1278
02:21:37,479 --> 02:21:40,000
They want to stop.

1279
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:42,600
They always want to stop.

1280
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:47,120
I don't know what to answer.

1281
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:50,640
I don't know what to tell them.

1282
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:55,880
Give me the word.

1283
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:07,400
I can't find the words.

1284
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:10,000
Tell me what to tell them.

1285
02:22:11,159 --> 02:22:13,160
Give me the word.

1286
02:22:15,879 --> 02:22:18,720
Show me the sign of divine help.

1287
02:22:22,879 --> 02:22:26,160
I have always obeyed you.

1288
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:28,200
You can't abandon me.

1289
02:22:34,399 --> 02:22:38,160
Answer me, I beg of you.

1290
02:22:39,399 --> 02:22:41,400
Answer me.

1291
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:26,640
- Can't you hold it up?
- I'm worn out. Look at my hands.

1292
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:30,360
Hey, you! Do you recognise this?

1293
02:23:30,399 --> 02:23:34,040
Hold it up high, so the men can see it.

1294
02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:39,400
- Like this?
- No, higher. Give it some movement.

1295
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:41,840
Everyone must be able to see it.

1296
02:23:41,879 --> 02:23:44,200
- Are you tired or something?
- I'm Basque.

1297
02:23:44,239 --> 02:23:48,520
It takes more than this to tire me out.
Are you the Maid's intendant?

1298
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:54,920
Is it true what they're saying,
that she's dead?

1299
02:23:54,959 --> 02:23:58,600
No, not at all. She'll be with us later.

1300
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:01,840
It churns me up that we've stopped.

1301
02:24:04,159 --> 02:24:07,680
- They must be laughing in there.
- Concentrate on your standard.

1302
02:24:07,719 --> 02:24:12,360
Hold it higher.
Make sure it catches the light.

1303
02:24:12,399 --> 02:24:14,400
Hey...

1304
02:24:17,239 --> 02:24:21,160
What if we went a bit closer
to see if they find less to laugh a'bout.

1305
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:24,280
- Do you feel up to it?
- Just the two of us?

1306
02:24:24,319 --> 02:24:26,320
Arert you Basque?

1307
02:24:30,479 --> 02:24:34,000
Hey, when you draw up the accounts
for the day, don't forget me.

1308
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:36,040
I promise, but don't let go of that.

1309
02:24:36,079 --> 02:24:38,080
I promise.

1310
02:24:39,399 --> 02:24:41,400
I promise.

1311
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:07,080
Higher. I want to hear it
flapping in the wind.

1312
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:11,880
Go, by the bridge. Go!

1313
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:24,440
Higher.

1314
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:38,120
- How's your shoulder, Jeanne?
- It's fine.

1315
02:25:38,159 --> 02:25:40,400
Get ready, we're going back.

1316
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:42,440
Already?

1317
02:25:42,760 --> 02:25:44,960
Will the two of you carry that ladder?

1318
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,040
- Yes, with a bit of help.
- Jeanne!

1319
02:25:47,079 --> 02:25:48,920
Jeanne!

1320
02:25:49,959 --> 02:25:54,040
Get ready. When the post
of my standard touches the wall,

1321
02:25:54,079 --> 02:25:55,800
attack.

1322
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:57,840
Victory will be yours.

1323
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:01,200
Louis, my standard,
what have you done with it?

1324
02:26:01,239 --> 02:26:03,240
They asked me for it.

1325
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:18,640
Who are you? Give me my standard.

1326
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:22,680
Is that how you keep your promises?
Don't you want your money?

1327
02:26:38,479 --> 02:26:41,240
FoM/ard! Victory is yours!

1328
02:26:44,239 --> 02:26:46,240
Victory is yours!

1329
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:00,200
FoM/ard!

1330
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,680
And that evening,
Jeanne entered the town,

1331
02:28:22,719 --> 02:28:24,760
and Glasdale drowned in the Loire -

1332
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:46,920
I can make you a nice herb omelette,
Jeanne.

1333
02:28:48,239 --> 02:28:52,080
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

1334
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:55,240
You must do like the others,
eat and rest.

1335
02:28:56,680 --> 02:29:00,400
Because tomorrow, the Goddamns,
after all you've done to them,

1336
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:02,760
will fight back hard.

1337
02:29:02,799 --> 02:29:05,480
The surgeon said that
after all you've done,

1338
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:07,520
you must eat a lot and sleep well.

1339
02:29:07,559 --> 02:29:12,080
- He said it was a miracle.
- He said that, thanks to your words,

1340
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:14,520
the captains had no choice
but to advance.

1341
02:29:14,559 --> 02:29:18,000
It was as if they'd climbed
the steps of heaven.

1342
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:23,960
He also said something about
the God's grace.

1343
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,080
Yes, he said only God's grace
could have moved them to act that way.

1344
02:29:33,879 --> 02:29:37,320
Move! Go and get her brother. Hurry!

1345
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:52,120
Don't worry. She's sleeping.
