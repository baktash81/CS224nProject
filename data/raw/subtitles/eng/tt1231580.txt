1
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,193
We're back!

2
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Let's go!

3
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,995
Nuts.

4
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,875
Give me the Black Beauty.

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,956
Alvin! Alvin! Alvin!

6
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,629
Alvin, take it easy out there.
You gotta share the spotlight.

7
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,159
You got it, Dave.

8
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,789
Dave?

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,753
I'm serious, Alvin.
This is a charity benefit.

10
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,552
It's not all about you.

11
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,468
Sorry, Dave, I can't hear you over the
thousands of fans screaming my name.

12
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,673
I'm back, Paris!

13
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,314
Yeah! A little help, boys.

14
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,839
Yeah!

15
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,714
Yeah, man!

16
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,314
Alvin, will you please get down
from there?

17
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,793
I can't hear you!

18
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,831
- Alvin, I'm not kidding!
- What?

19
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,753
Dave, look out!

20
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,111
Alvin!

21
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,475
Dave!

22
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,515
Dave!

23
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,835
Dave?

24
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,712
This should help with the pain.

25
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,393
I wanna talk to my boys.

26
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,438
I just gave you a sedative that will
take effect in about one minute, so...

27
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,437
Well, let them in quickly.

28
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,677
- Dave!
- Dave, you're alive!

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,109
- Hey, guys!
- It was an accident, I swear.

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,515
- Are you okay?
- I'm really sorry, Dave.

31
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
I'll be fine. I'm just gonna be
stuck here for a while.

32
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,590
And until I get out,
I've made arrangements

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,676
for my Aunt Jackie
to come stay with you.

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,711
- Who's Aunt Jackie?
- The one who sends us

35
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,115
those metal buckets of yummy popcorn
for Christmas.

36
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,719
Oh, Popcorn Jackie.

37
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,159
You don't have much time,
monsieur Seville.

38
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,068
Listen, I want you guys to go home
and live a normal childhood.

39
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,995
I've even made arrangements
for you to go to school.

40
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,590
- School?
- Yes, school.

41
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,233
Simon, I'm putting you in charge.

42
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,310
- You are?
- I'm counting on you.

43
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,194
Dave, wait a minute. Why is he in charge?

44
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,395
He's counting on me.

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,192
Dave, please don't die.

46
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,276
He's just sleeping. He's had a sedative.

47
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,359
A sedative.

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,790
Excuse me.
I'm here to escort the Chipmunks home.

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,435
We're not leaving Dave.
I'm putting my paw down on this one.

50
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,039
You come here!

51
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,913
I got it. I'll fix it. Nope, made it worse.

52
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,349
- Please. Please go.
- Oh, this must be it.

53
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,351
The more stress you put
on monsieur Seville,

54
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,993
the longer it will take him to recover!

55
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,237
You are too slow for me, nurse.

56
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,998
- No! Don't...
- You'll never take me!

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,315
I'm not going anywhere without...

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,392
I hope for your sake he stays asleep
for the entire flight.

59
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,717
Maybe we should give him another shot,
just to be sure.

60
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,668
Any ideas on how we find Aunt Jackie?

61
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,718
Got it! Follow me.

62
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,159
Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me. Coming through.

63
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,273
Look! Aunt Jackie!

64
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,630
- Oh, yeah! Aunt Jackie!
- Popcorn Jackie!

65
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,637
- Oh, hello, dears!
- Cool wheelchair.

66
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,150
- Yay, we found you!
- Popcorn! Where's Simon and Theodore's?

67
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,511
There's plenty for everyone.
But let's have a hug first.

68
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,949
Get over here, you old teddy bear!

69
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,510
I'm not really much of a hugger.

70
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,349
Boys, I want you to meet someone.
This is my grandson Toby.

71
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,516
- Toby?
- Hi! I'm Theodore.

72
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,790
- Toby.
- What? What happened? What?

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,273
- The boys.
- Hey.

74
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,799
- Hi!
- Hey! How are you?

75
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,275
- I'm Toby. Nice to meet you.
- Toby's living with me

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,470
till he figures out
what he wants to do with his life.

77
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,795
So far, that means going
"pyu, pyu-pyu-pyu-pyu"

78
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,638
- with his thumbs all day.
- Well, for the record,

79
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,990
going "pyu-pyu-pyu-pyu-pyu"
with my thumbs right now

80
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,236
is keeping me in first place.
So that's important.

81
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,157
- Toby, get the bags.
- What bags?

82
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,510
- The luggage. Get the luggage.
- The... The... Right.

83
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,551
Yeah, let me get those. Sorry.

84
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,272
- Toby?
- Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!

85
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,992
Abandon wheelchair!

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,389
Toby!

87
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,835
Toby!

88
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,632
I'm fine. Don't worry.

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,028
I'm so sorry, Aunt Jackie. I'm so sorry!
Is she gonna be okay?

90
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,628
Don't worry about me.
I'll be home in no time.

91
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,593
- In you go.
- I wouldn't be so sure.

92
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,792
What? It was an accident. I swear.

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,473
Been there, done that. Several times.

94
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,757
I guess you'll be taking care of us now.

95
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,553
I'll take "Frightening Thoughts"
for $500, please, Alex.

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,832
Not a problem. I can totally do this.
I took care of my cat,

97
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,236
until he ran away. Well, "ran away"
is kind of strong wording.

98
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,839
I think he just wanted his space.

99
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,235
I still see him around
the neighborhood, you know.

100
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,954
He, like, hisses and claws at me,

101
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,753
but I think that's just his way
of saying we're still tight. You know.

102
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,719
You guys have nothing to worry
about, seriously,

103
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,990
'cause I'm not gonna be like Dave.
You know, Dave's gone.

104
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,755
Gone?

105
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,837
Not gone. Not gone, guys. He's...
He's not dead. He's very much alive.

106
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,916
He's completely coming back.
I'm just gonna be in his room,

107
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,837
keeping his bed warm.
I'm gonna be doing my thing,

108
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,190
you'll be doing your thing.
You're not even gonna know I'm there.

109
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,189
We're supposed to know you're there.

110
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,276
That's... That's the whole idea.

111
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,551
Yeah. Yeah! Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
Yeah, you'll know that I'm there.

112
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,433
I'm just saying, I'm not gonna be,
like, "I know everything"

113
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,757
and, "You do this, and you do that,"
like my dad.

114
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,397
All right! Let's do this.

115
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,634
Oh, boy.

116
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,756
Theodore, we're gonna be just fine.

117
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,190
The important thing is
we're all still alive.

118
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,118
Maybe my get well card
will help Dave get home faster.

119
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,074
It needs just a touch more glitter.

120
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,593
Yep, that should do it. Who's hungry?

121
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,671
- Me! Me! Me!
- Let's eat.

122
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,515
Simon?

123
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,108
It's a food ghost town in here. Alvin?

124
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,513
Holla! The Cheese Balls
are in the hizzouse!

125
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,028
Bingo! Dinner, she's a-served.

126
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,913
- Yay! All right!
- Hey! What're you doing in here?

127
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,350
- Cheese Ball?
- Dude, let's go! Come on!

128
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,675
Tom-bo, hey, hey,
give me a second, real quick.

129
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,473
Alvin, I really, really need
to focus right now

130
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,751
because I am one knockout away
from a heavyweight title.

131
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,679
Can we play as well?

132
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,793
You know,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings,

133
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,319
but I also don't wanna see
anybody get hurt,

134
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,510
and there are gonna be
fists of fury a-flying.

135
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,428
We can play Monopoly.
We play Monopoly with Dave all the time.

136
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,596
Do you? That sounds fun,
and we should do that sometime,

137
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,278
but right now I gotta get back
to floating like a butterfly

138
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,799
and stinging like a bee. So...

139
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,876
Hey, Tom-bo, you still there, buddy?

140
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,552
Who needs Toby, Theodore? You got us!

141
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,116
Yeah, who needs Toby?
Boys, right this way.

142
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,713
I'm gonna puke!

143
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,676
Do you know what Dave would say
if he were here right now?

144
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,677
- Alvin!
- Alvin!

145
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,792
Not bad. But I think it needs to come
more from the belly.

146
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,831
- Alvin!
- Alvin!

147
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,908
Phone. Get it together.

148
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,715
Be cool.

149
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,159
- Hello?
- Yes?

150
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,793
- Boys, it's me.
- Dave!

151
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,751
Dave? As in, "Dave"?

152
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,679
Well, I guess
since you answered the phone,

153
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,598
- you haven't burned down the house yet.
- Have a little faith, Dave.

154
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,791
Yeah. Mayday!

155
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,789
- What was that?
- Don't stress him out.

156
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,351
That was Aunt Jackie. Yeah.

157
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,677
She's making us a zesty 5-course meal.

158
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,118
Really? Well, can I talk to her?

159
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,952
- She's practicing her pole dancing.
- Pole dancing?

160
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,719
What happened to making dinner?
Guys, what's going on?

161
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,910
- Gotta go, Dave.
- Alvin, I'm not kidding.

162
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,076
- Feel better.
- Alvin!

163
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,909
Yep. Nobody does that better than him.

164
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,071
Toby? Toby, wake up.

165
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,628
Sorry.

166
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,877
No, that's... That's okay. What is it?

167
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,319
I had a nightmare.

168
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,035
The nightmares.
I hate the nightmares. What was it?

169
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,959
I dreamt we didn't have a family anymore.

170
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,110
Theodore.
Theodore, that couldn't happen.

171
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,596
No, you guys are tight.
Nothing could ever separate you.

172
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,312
Unless, like, an eagle swooped down
from the sky and was like, caw-caw!

173
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,510
- What?
- And grabbed you and...

174
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,600
Which... Which couldn't happen, ever.
So why would you...

175
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,199
Why would you ever think that
that would ever happen?

176
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,470
You know, 'cause the Eagles
are in Philadelphia.

177
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,238
No! No!

178
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,359
Sweet dreams.

179
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,072
- Toby! Toby, make it stop!
- What are you doing?

180
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,954
There's something wrong with the clock!
It won't shut up! I can't sleep!

181
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,757
That's the point. It's an alarm clock.

182
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,269
It helps you wake up early in the morning.

183
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,392
- Why would anyone wanna wake up early?
- Well, for school.

184
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,988
- You gotta be there by 8:00.
- In the morning?

185
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,315
Look, I don't like getting up this early
any more than you do.

186
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
But we are in this together, Alvin.

187
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,352
Sooner you get to school, sooner I get
to come home and get back to sleep.

188
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,755
You mean,
you don't stay with us at school?

189
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,474
No, no... No, I've done my time,
thank you very much.

190
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,953
But school is fun, right?

191
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,231
Fun? Well, I guess maybe it's fun-ish.

192
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,794
Hey, it's my cat!
Hey, remember I was telling you? Hey!

193
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,309
Hey! Hey, kitty. It's me. Remember?

194
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,074
I treated you good.

195
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,313
Okay, here we go.

196
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,720
Enjoy your first day at school.
See you around 3:00-ish.

197
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,909
Okay.

198
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,718
We got this. This'll be a walk in the park.

199
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,355
A chaotic and frightening
walk in the park!

200
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,833
Hi, I'm Theodore. Hi, I'm Theodore.
Hi, I'm Theodore.

201
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,393
- Watch out!
- Look out!

202
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,588
Hi, I'm...

203
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,994
Guys? Guys?

204
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,839
Oh, boy!

205
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,796
- Eagle!
- Go, Eagles!

206
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,433
Eagle!

207
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,951
That wasn't very fun-ish.

208
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,951
You must be our new students.
I'm Dr. Rubin, the principal.

209
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,271
And we're the Chipmunks.

210
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,278
Yes, well, that would explain
the fur and the bushy tails.

211
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,038
Follow me, gentlemen.

212
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,151
Gentlemen? Oh, us. Right.

213
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,068
There was a minute left and
we were down by 2. And I'm like,

214
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,909
"Coach, I don't care if my leg's broken.
Put me in. I can win this."

215
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,158
- I never get tired of this story.
- So I hobble out, barely able to stand.

216
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,872
Did I mention my leg was broken?

217
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,758
- Miss Ortega.
- Yes?

218
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,359
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

219
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,158
- Hello, guys. Welcome to homeroom.
- Good to be here.

220
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,840
- I hope.
- So this is a classroom.

221
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,595
I love the smell of zit cream
in the morning.

222
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,118
Hello, ladies.

223
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,958
- Is that the Chipmunks?
- The Chipmunks!

224
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,672
We love you, Alvin!

225
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,708
Hi, I'm Theodore. Hi, I'm Theodore.

226
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,672
Yes, he's Theodore, in case you missed it.
And I am Simon.

227
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,911
The name's Seville. Alvin Seville.

228
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,232
Somebody's gonna have to
knock those guys down to size.

229
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,158
Well, that should be pretty easy.
I mean, they're only 8 inches tall.

230
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,718
I had 15 cars.

231
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,631
I mean, that's, like, 5 more cars
than anybody really needs.

232
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,517
I had 7 maids.
I had courtside seats to the Lakers.

233
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,878
Even my maids had
courtside seats to the Lakers.

234
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,749
And now look at me. Look at me!

235
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,110
- Alvin and the Chipmunks!
- I lost everything.

236
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,390
Except for my dignity.
They can't take that away from me.

237
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,432
And it's all because of them.

238
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,071
Hey. Breakfast.

239
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,716
Now I run around hoping and praying

240
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,434
that I can find other animals
that can sing or dance. I mean...

241
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,075
Wait a second. You don't sing, do you?

242
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,668
Hey! Hey! That's my muffin!

243
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,553
Give me my muffin, you dirty rat!

244
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,236
I will get you, Chipmunks.

245
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,232
Girls, we gotta get out of here.

246
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,992
- I can't see.
- Not on my nose!

247
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,639
- That's my tail!
- Sorry.

248
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,318
- Move your butt!
- Okay.

249
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,668
Who's squishing me?

250
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,677
We made it. Jett Records.

251
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,030
Oh, my gosh. That's him. Ian Hawke.
Mr. Hawke?

252
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,559
That voice. I can't get it out of my head.

253
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,718
Hello? Mr. Hawke!

254
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,037
That's not in my head.
That's really happening.

255
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,440
- What do you want?
- We want to introduce ourselves.

256
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,519
That's right. I'm Brittany,
and this is my sister Eleanor.

257
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,598
Hello, sir. Such a pleasure to meet you.

258
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,278
And I'm their sister Jeanette.

259
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,392
Although I feel more like an Olivia,
or sometimes a...

260
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,431
Anyway, we're the Chipettes.

261
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,348
And, well, we would just be so honored
to have you represent us.

262
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,592
You made Alvin and the Chipmunks stars.
We wanna be stars, too.

263
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,836
- Yeah.
- And hang out with the Chipmunks.

264
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,830
Okay, now, listen, before we get
all girlie and giggly about this,

265
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,191
just tell me one thing.
You can sing, right?

266
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,472
No, no, wait. Hang on. Not here.

267
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,956
Why don't we take this meeting upstairs
in my penthouse office?

268
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,117
Sure! This is so exciting.

269
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,673
We're really on our way now.

270
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,674
Oh, my gosh. Guys, can you believe it?
My first penthouse office!

271
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,352
- Wow!
- Oh, boy!

272
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,312
Oh, my. The Hollywood sign.

273
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,676
Thought you might like the view.

274
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,234
So, ladies, tell me a little something
about yourselves.

275
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,830
Well, we grew up in a small town,
population 300, and...

276
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,474
Yeah? Really? That's fascinating. Great.

277
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,872
All right, impress me.

278
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,637
1, 2, 3.

279
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,871
Girls, girls, girls, girls.

280
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,952
Guess who just became the number one
Chipette fan in the whole dang world?

281
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,559
Ian Hawke, that's who.

282
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,950
- Yay! Nice!
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!

283
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,798
So when can we meet the Chipmunks?

284
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,108
That's an excellent question.
And the excellent answer is,

285
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,437
I don't really represent
Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

286
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,437
- Oh, no!
- What happened?

287
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,633
Classic tale. Sweet and innocent
when I met them, and they had nothing.

288
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,036
And then I work my butt off
to make them rock stars,

289
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,078
and they changed.

290
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,955
Turned on me like bad cheese.

291
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,675
- No!
- That's terrible.

292
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,510
I know! I mean, I treated Alvin
like he was my own son, you know?

293
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,154
And then he just goes and spits on me.

294
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,319
Literally. He filled his chipmunk cheeks
with saliva and just had at it.

295
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,795
And don't even get me started
about Simon.

296
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,911
But not Theodore, right?

297
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,556
It's the cuddly ones
you have to watch out for.

298
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,239
But what are we talking about them for?

299
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,238
Come on! They're over.
Tired. Novelty act.

300
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,713
Chipmunks who can sing.

301
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,079
But girl chipmunks who can sing?

302
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,829
Fasten your seatbelts!

303
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,398
So, I'm on Jay-Z's yacht, right?
And I say, "Jay, where's Beyoncé?"

304
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,910
And he says, "She's holding a plate
full of Cheese Balls. Turn around."

305
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,712
And guess what? She was!

306
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,035
P.S., Dave left me in charge.

307
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,754
Staying up till 10:00 every night.
Oh, yeah!

308
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,155
Hey, girls, look what I can do.

309
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,997
You are Theodore-able.

310
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,599
- Thank you.
- You're so cute.

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,070
I am so sorry.

312
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,919
- It's cool. No harm done.
- Not yet.

313
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,351
Girls? Please? Private conference.

314
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,994
Thank you.

315
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,312
Listen up, rock stars.

316
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,018
If you talk to those girls again,
you're dead.

317
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,033
If you look at those girls again,
you're dead.

318
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,674
If you even think about those girls...

319
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,759
Are you thinking about them?

320
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,313
Well, I am now!

321
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,113
That's it. You're dead!

322
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,555
- Run!
- Xander! Come on!

323
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,433
- Back here, you dirty rats!
- Hang ten, bros!

324
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,629
Scatter!

325
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,033
Go, go! That way! Over there!

326
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,954
Ryan!

327
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,235
Hey, slowpokes! Catch me if you can!

328
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,316
- You're dead, fur ball.
- Not!

329
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,832
- It's wedgie time!
- My butt!

330
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,636
Oh, boy. Eagle.

331
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,596
- Eagle! Eagle!
- Get them!

332
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,389
- Bully! Bully!
- This way! This way!

333
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,115
Gotcha!

334
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,151
- Guys, wait, wait. Time out!
- It's swirlie time!

335
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,555
Come on, come on, guys. This is so 1980s.

336
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,079
Please! Please!

337
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,751
Oh, man! Come on.

338
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,314
- That's a good look for you.
- Thank you.

339
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,673
Can't swim. Help!

340
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,799
Grab on, Simon.

341
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,555
Thanks.

342
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,589
You okay?

343
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,030
Well, considering that you just
saved me from drowning in a toilet,

344
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,310
I'm pretty good.

345
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,032
I'll be right back.

346
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,754
Alvin! Alvin! We're not going
to solve anything with violence.

347
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,757
- It's the fatty-ratty!
- Cut it out!

348
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,711
This rat has serious junk in the trunk.

349
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,273
- Yeah, little fatty!
- Stop it!

350
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,879
He jiggles when I poke him.

351
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,071
Mommy!

352
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,829
Simon, does this make my butt
look smaller?

353
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,430
Theodore, your butt looks fine.
Those guys are just jerks.

354
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,514
Gentlemen.

355
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,309
You threatened to climb inside of him
and build a nest.

356
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,112
That was out of line.

357
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,510
I'm not even sure
that's physically possible.

358
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,591
I should suspend all 3 of you.

359
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,948
Please do.

360
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,156
Instead, I have a better idea.

361
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,838
Due to budget cutbacks,

362
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,270
we are in jeopardy of losing
our beloved music program.

363
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,674
- That's awful.
- I know.

364
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,155
But there is one small ray of hope.

365
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,433
Every year the district sponsors
a music competition.

366
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,711
And the winner's school receives $25,000.

367
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,515
If we win, we can save our program.

368
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,234
And you want us to perform?

369
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,828
'Cause I didn't think you were a fan.

370
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,911
Why don't you sleep on it?

371
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,155
Wait a minute! What is that? That's us!

372
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,474
- Wait.
- I look skinny.

373
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,797
Promise me that you won't say anything.

374
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,273
A principal has a certain image to uphold,

375
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,436
and if the faculty ever found out
about this, I could...

376
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,989
I just cannot believe that you're
actually sitting in my office.

377
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,510
I have all of your CDs.
I even went to see you last year in Denver.

378
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,598
That's where I got this.
It was my birthday.

379
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,395
And I was like, "The Chipmunks!"

380
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,755
So what do you say?
Will you represent our school?

381
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,316
Honestly, suspension still sounds
pretty good to me.

382
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,718
Come on, Alvin. What do you say?
1 for all and 3 for 1!

383
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,910
Well put, Theodore. Very well put.

384
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,359
Count us in.

385
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,839
Go, Eagles!

386
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,039
Eagles? Where?

387
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,592
The penthouse level.

388
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,670
Isn't that that Chihuahua?
You know, from the movie?

389
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,113
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it...
I mean, yeah, of course it is.

390
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,559
A lot of big names live here.

391
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,839
- I must have his autograph.
- Hey, hey, Brittany.

392
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,190
You wanna be a star? Act like a star.

393
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,197
All right?
You don't get autographs, you give them.

394
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,995
Right.

395
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,076
Hey, look, over there!
There're a couple of the Jonas Brothers.

396
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,633
- Where?
- I don't see them.

397
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,149
Here we are! Okay!

398
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,794
Let's scoot in to my...

399
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,870
What? Did I... Darn it! Darn it to heck!

400
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,036
- What's wrong?
- Girls, I apologize,

401
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,470
but I seem to have left my keys
back in my office.

402
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,476
What if one of you were
to shoot through that mail slot

403
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,352
and open it up from the inside, huh?

404
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,029
I'll do it.

405
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,154
I'm stuck!

406
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,477
All right, I got you. I got you.

407
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,478
Not so hard!

408
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,875
Might want to lay off the nuts.

409
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,873
All right, how about you, Glasses?
You're in better shape. Wanna go?

410
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,471
I'm not that great at things like this.

411
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,794
I got it!

412
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,715
Yes!

413
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,515
- Impressive!
- Nice!

414
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,514
- Gee willikers! Stripes!
- Snazzy!

415
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,359
- Circles!
- This is the best tree house ever!

416
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,948
- A red piano!
- Brit.

417
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,475
Is this a dream? Somebody pinch me.

418
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,351
This is way better than a tree.

419
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,550
I just adore a penthouse view.

420
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,673
Nice one, Hawke.

421
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,796
- Yeah? You like it?
- Do I?

422
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,718
- I live here.
- It's so beautiful!

423
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,795
Yeah.

424
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,674
Last time we visited Meerkat Manor,

425
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,075
a rival group called the Commandos

426
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,112
was making large inroads
into the Whiskers' territory.

427
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,629
Toby! I thought Alvin was messy.

428
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,719
This is literally disgusting.
I feel like I'm living in a dumpster.

429
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,158
Simon, it's Meerkat Manor.
Watch with me.

430
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,312
You know, you're right. You're right.
I just need to relax.

431
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,510
Maybe that'll ease my nerves a little.

432
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,988
What is this? What...

433
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,069
You've got to be joking.
A taco? In a blanket? Toby!

434
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,869
Ladies and gentlemen,
going for his turkey, it's the Tobester.

435
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,559
Come on, baby!

436
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,828
Yes!

437
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,395
Yes!

438
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,718
No problem. Watch and learn, my friends.

439
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,198
Well, it looks like it's time
to play my second favorite game.

440
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,118
Hide the Broken TV from Dave.
You wanna play?

441
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,320
- No!
- Go easy on him, taco boy.

442
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,192
This day's been bad enough already.

443
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,312
I think I see what's going on.

444
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,635
You guys have been having
some problems at school?

445
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,637
No. Not really. Unless you consider

446
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,069
getting your head dumped
into a public toilet a problem.

447
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,557
Swirlies are the worst.

448
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,877
At least that's what I've heard.

449
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,959
Because there's no way that I could
possibly know that on a personal level.

450
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,475
Toby, what was school like for you?

451
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,834
Toby? Toby?

452
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,274
- Toby? Toby!
- What?

453
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,438
What was school like for me?
In a word, awesome.

454
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,876
But, you know, that's 'cause
I was, like, extremely popular.

455
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,912
Is that why you still live
with your grandma?

456
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,951
And refer to yourself as "the Tobester"?

457
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,672
And go "pyu-pyu-pyu" all day?

458
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,915
Bedtime!

459
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,955
Alvin?

460
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,828
Alvin, wake up and turn off the alarm!

461
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,349
Alvin! Alvin, I'm not kidding!
I'm not kidding, buddy. Turn it off!

462
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,833
Guys! Guys...

463
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,958
Boys, this isn't funny.

464
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,992
Hello. Humane Society? Yes. I need help.

465
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,873
A man is after us.
He wants to take us to a terrible place.

466
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,959
- School!
- Out!

467
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,389
- Have a heart, huh?
- Have a heart?

468
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,795
Dave wants you to go to school,
so you're going.

469
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,480
Yeah, well, don't worry about
picking us up at 3:00, Toby.

470
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,556
We'll get a ride. In a hearse!

471
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,877
Guys, guys, come on. Look, trust me.

472
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,956
The second day
is never as bad as the first.

473
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,195
Glasses! Glasses! You wouldn't hit
a guy with glasses, would you?

474
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,948
You're out, man!

475
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,559
Right in the pancreas.

476
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,879
- Call the nurse.
- Out! Out! You're out.

477
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,434
Come on, Alvin!
Remember your 5 D's!

478
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,753
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge!

479
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,950
- Move!
- You're next, fur ball.

480
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,960
You talking to me? You talking to me?

481
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,559
I'm the only one here,
so you must be talking to me.

482
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,435
- Yeah! Got him!
- Did you see that?

483
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,353
Unbelievable. He caught it.
You're out, man.

484
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,949
And the fat lady, she's a-singing.

485
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,469
- Dude's got hands.
- I think they're paws, actually.

486
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,558
Whatever. We can definitely use him
on the team.

487
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,032
Hey, fur ball! How would you like
a spot on the football team?

488
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,115
Football?

489
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,717
I gotta say, you're good. I'm gonna
let you hang out with us at lunch.

490
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,996
- That is, if you wanna be on the team.
- Interesting proposition.

491
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,879
- Alvin?
- Let me get back to you on that.

492
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,594
This is a one-time offer.
Don't take too long to think it over.

493
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,358
Right! Like I would ditch my brothers
just to become the first chipmunk ever

494
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,596
to play on an actual varsity football team.

495
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,759
Fat chance!

496
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,877
The stadium is pandemonium!
It's 4th and goal. It's up! It's up!

497
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,754
And he catches it! The crowd goes crazy!

498
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,075
Hey!

499
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,318
- Me?
- Alvin! Alvin! Alvin!

500
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,910
Alvin, I think the super-cool jock table
is paging you.

501
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,072
Why would I go over there? Like I really
need to worry about being popular.

502
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,829
Hello? Talking chipmunk? Huh?
World-famous rock star?

503
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,635
Guy with his own plush doll?
Guys, I'm on pajamas!

504
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,113
Not to toot my own horn, but...

505
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,752
Come on. It's laughable.

506
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,510
- Just go, Alvin.
- Really? You mean it?

507
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,393
- Yeah.
- Thanks! I'll be right back!

508
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,353
- What up, dudes?
- What's up, little man?

509
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,596
- Welcome to the cool table.
- Yeah! Bring it.

510
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,358
- Yeah!
- Pound the paw.

511
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,508
I want it! I got it! I got it! I...

512
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,389
Don't got it.

513
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,511
- I think he's cute.
- Me, too.

514
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,159
Toss. And he's up!

515
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,676
- Thank you.
- Hey, Alvin.

516
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,869
Call me.

517
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,312
Bernie, I'm telling you,
the Chipmunks are old news.

518
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,433
I got the next big thing.
Singing female chipmunks.

519
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,389
Hello? Bernie? Hello?

520
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,590
God! What part of "singing female
chipmunks" don't these people...

521
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,999
Girls, we're going to school.

522
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,232
And he's up and he scores!

523
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,758
Hey! What up, S?

524
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,316
Don't hate on the high-five.

525
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,758
Yeah. High-five.

526
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,878
Look, Alvin,
I know you guys have been busy

527
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,639
with your sporting endeavors
and whatnot,

528
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,751
but I can really use your help at home.

529
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,233
No can do.

530
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,511
Ry-dawg is gonna teach me how to get
pretty girls to do my homework.

531
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,157
Alvin, you promised Theodore
we'd hang out.

532
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,158
We are watching Meerkat Manor tonight.
No pretty girls.

533
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,114
- Dude, I can't swing it today, bro.
- That's what you say every day, Alvin.

534
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,629
Need I remind you
it's your day to do the laundry?

535
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,276
You better listen to your daddy, Alvin.
You don't wanna get grounded.

536
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,470
Are you going to pick that up?

537
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,272
Are you going to make me?

538
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,760
I'm just going to elegantly show you
how it's done.

539
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,039
Simon...

540
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,793
Off the glass.

541
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,878
And you call yourself a jock.

542
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,119
My brother, he's a real jokester.
Always kidding.

543
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,949
Anyhoo, see you guys in class.

544
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,994
- Hey, that's my pudding.
- It's my pudding.

545
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,589
Why are you trying to embarrass me
in front of my friends?

546
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,837
Are you kidding me? They're the ones
you should be embarrassed by.

547
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,793
- Good luck with the show, guys.
- Front row seats. Can't wait.

548
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,638
So? What song are we gonna sing?

549
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,479
No pressure,
but the whole school is counting on us.

550
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,309
Relax. It's like Ryan says,
who's gonna beat singing chipmunks?

551
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,835
That Simon is dreamy!

552
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,871
I think Theodore was looking at me.

553
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,390
Yeah, I know.
But, guys, remember what Ian said?

554
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,919
We can't trust them.

555
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,195
- Wow.
- What happened?

556
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,438
I never thought I'd say this,
but pink is my new favorite color.

557
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,596
Her glasses were quite fetching.

558
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,439
She's like a beautiful green gumdrop.

559
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,679
Okay, well, if you guys wanna do this,
you have to pay attention.

560
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,950
Maybe this is a good time
for us to take a break.

561
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,399
Good call. Take 5.

562
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,233
- She's right. We need to focus, fellas.
- Right.

563
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,918
This is for my screensaver.

564
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,553
Cheese Balls!

565
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,353
Hey, you guys! Hey.
You guys ready to go?

566
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,038
'Cause I got a lot of important stuff
to do at home.

567
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,436
You must be their guardian.

568
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,915
That I... That I am. Yes, I am.

569
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,235
Hi, how are you? How are you, Dr. Rubin?

570
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,157
I know that because
I went to school here a few years ago.

571
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,555
I don't know if you remember me.
Toby Seville? Probably not.

572
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,195
Toby?

573
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,833
No way! Hi! Hey, no braces.

574
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,440
- Your teeth look great.
- You... I... Thank you. I appreciate...

575
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,394
I did. I did. I did get my braces off
'cause they were just...

576
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,075
Okay.

577
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,630
That... You know what,
I know a guy who actually...

578
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,990
Who works on drum heads.
So that's very good.

579
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,872
I'll be in the car, guys. So...

580
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,558
Somebody's in love.

581
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,990
That aside, we're going to replace
everything. Chipmunk's honor.

582
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,556
Yes, the old false-modesty
suck-up routine.

583
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,910
- Ian Hawke?
- I thought I smelled a rat.

584
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,553
May I help you, Mr. Hawke?

585
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,159
Well, I was wondering if I could help you.

586
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,191
I just heard about
your musical competition,

587
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,118
and I just skedaddled down here as quick
as I could to volunteer my girls.

588
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,430
Well, that's very thoughtful of you,
but I've already made up my mind.

589
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,519
Well, perhaps this will
change your mind. Girls?

590
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,993
They're with Ian?

591
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,075
Curtains!

592
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,960
1, 2...
1, 2...

593
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,438
Wow! They're good!

594
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,232
Good? They're astounding!

595
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,909
My good people of West Eastman,

596
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,271
you have just witnessed
the debut of the Chipettes.

597
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

598
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,189
So?

599
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,393
They were splendid, but as I said before,
I have made my decision.

600
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,394
- Brit?
- No!

601
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,480
I see. You've made your decision.

602
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,318
I don't mean
to speak out of school, Doctor,

603
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,874
but in the true spirit of democracy,

604
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,319
which our great, wonderful country
was founded upon,

605
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,954
I say let the people vote.
Let them choose!

606
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,755
One person, one vote. I say, let us vote!

607
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,357
Let us vote! Let us vote!

608
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,153
Let us vote! Let us vote!

609
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,077
Please, don't be a fascist granny.
Let freedom ring, Doctor.

610
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,955
- Let us vote!
- Let us vote!

611
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,035
- Let us vote!
- Let us vote!

612
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,672
You make a persuasive case, Mr. Hawke.

613
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,310
All right, here's what I'm going to do.

614
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,353
This Friday, each group will perform
one song in front of the student body.

615
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,469
- Yes!
- All right!

616
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,319
Whoever gets the most applause
will represent the school.

617
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,755
What?

618
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,355
- Thank you!
- Yes!

619
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,549
We did it!

620
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,749
In your face!

621
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,830
It is on like Donkey Kong.

622
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,312
The meerkats huddle together
at the end of a traumatic day

623
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,189
to reaffirm their family bond.

624
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,035
The Whiskers are gonna have to rely
on each other more than ever.

625
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,075
Guys, I am so happy that Ms. Ortega can
rehearse with us every day after school.

626
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,635
Every day?

627
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,070
- But Ryan and I have...
- Alvin, stop right there, okay?

628
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,156
We're a team. We need you.

629
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,277
Would you relax? We're not gonna lose.
We'll talk about this in the morning.

630
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,551
Not much to talk about.
I will see you at rehearsal.

631
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,590
- Stop hogging.
- I'm not hogging.

632
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,157
You might as well be rooting out
truffles in the French countryside,

633
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,111
because you are, in fact, hogging!

634
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,434
- I'm not!
- Are so!

635
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,949
- Not! Am not! Not! Not!
- So! So! So! So!

636
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,753
Forget it! I think
I'll sleep in my own bed tonight.

637
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,553
- Ditto for me.
- I'm so glad I'm not a meerkat!

638
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,194
- Really? Why is that?
- Because as cold as I am,

639
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,117
- I would never huddle with you!
- Good!

640
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,800
- You hear me? I won't huddle!
- Fine!

641
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,555
Toby?

642
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,473
Can I sleep with you?

643
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,553
- What?
- Dave lets me.

644
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,192
My brothers are fighting.

645
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,756
Well... I'm... Okay.

646
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,796
Oh, man! Dutch oven!
Not the Dutch oven!

647
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,192
Anything but the Dutch oven!

648
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,959
Must find fresh air before it's too late!

649
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,831
It's too late! It burns.

650
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,793
Mama, it burns!

651
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,112
Let's see. What else am I in the mood for?

652
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,593
How about a side order of friendly advice?
Courtesy of me.

653
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,394
No, thanks.

654
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,429
Grapes, please.

655
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,069
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, well,

656
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,590
I just wanted to warn you about Ian.

657
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,914
What? You should be grateful to Ian.

658
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,838
He did everything for you, Alvin,
and you broke his heart.

659
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,274
Really? How do I put this gently?

660
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,789
He's the devil. He doesn't have a heart.

661
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,435
And one of the things he did for us
was put us in a cage.

662
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,232
Alvin, he would never do that.

663
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,715
Yeah, 'cause you were there. I forgot.

664
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,355
- Brittany, you'd better watch out.
- I don't need advice from you.

665
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,919
- But...
- But nothing, Alvin.

666
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,793
Ian's taking us straight to the top!

667
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,876
Got it. Straight to the top.

668
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,911
- Ironic.
- Yeah, funny.

669
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,433
We are so going
to destroy those Chipmunks.

670
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,357
- I don't wanna destroy them.
- Me, neither.

671
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,799
I just wanna hang out with them.

672
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,036
All right, all right, all right. Hold...
All right, look.

673
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,475
You know, if you feel that way,

674
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,353
maybe we should just
withdraw from the contest.

675
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,277
- What?
- Then I'll put you in a FedEx package

676
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,153
and mail you back to whatever tree
you came from. Sound good?

677
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,554
- No.
- Okay, then.

678
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,193
Take it from the top. Let's go!

679
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,037
All right. Wait. Stop!

680
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,159
Short one in the green dress.

681
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,679
- What's your name again?
- Eleanor.

682
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,075
Yeah, look,
I'm losing you there, you know.

683
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,634
- Have you always been that short?
- I... I guess.

684
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,474
Well, you got to work on that. Okay?

685
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,791
All right, let me try something here.

686
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,632
Brittany. Here, come up here.

687
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,637
No, you two stay back.
Little further.

688
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,588
Oh, yeah. Now, that I like.

689
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,439
And it's not just because Brittany's

690
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,551
more of a mega, ultra superstar
than you guys.

691
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,675
Good, good. Okay, you know what?
Let's get a little more separation.

692
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,792
Brittany, stay there. Let's get a little
more separation from you guys.

693
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,435
Yeah, let's give her some room.
Give her some room, guys. Back.

694
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,519
Okay. All right, watch me now.
1, 2, 3!

695
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,518
Now, watch me. Watch me now.

696
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,515
Hello.

697
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,514
Toby?

698
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,434
What are you doing at the house?
Where's Aunt Jackie?

699
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,519
Dave! Hey! Hey, Dave, what's happening?

700
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,636
Aunt Jackie is in the hospital.

701
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,320
I'm a little worried.
Who's watching the boys?

702
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,115
I am.

703
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,750
So, Dave, how is Paris?

704
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,714
- Wait, are the boys behaving?
- Absolutely. They've been just peachy.

705
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,273
Toby, what's going on?

706
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,753
Nothing. Nothing. No, don't even...
Don't even worry about it.

707
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,552
You know, I know that you're
not supposed to be stressed out,

708
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,716
so I'm going to go right now.
But it's all good here.

709
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,193
Come home soon! Bye!

710
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,835
Toby?

711
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,389
Toby!

712
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,596
Nurse! Nurse! Get me out of here!

713
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,909
Help!

714
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,749
I don't mean to interrupt your game,
but I saw you stand up to Ryan

715
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,077
- when he littered. That took guts.
- Really?

716
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,792
And that's the type of guy
that we're looking for.

717
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,831
Jeremy Smith, student body president.

718
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,110
- How do you do? I'm...
- International recording star

719
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,789
- and litter monitor Simon Seville.
- Litter monitor?

720
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,115
Litter monitor.
It's a new position that we've created

721
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,550
to help raise awareness
of a pressing problem in our society.

722
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,037
I agree 99% plus 1. You do the math.

723
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,715
Well, Simon, I know this is a lot to ask,

724
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,912
but we're looking for a take-charge guy

725
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,589
to take charge
of this very rewarding position.

726
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,199
What do you say?

727
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,839
Excuse me, everybody.
Quick announcement.

728
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,791
I'm Simon. I'm the litter monitor.

729
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,717
Put your trash in the garbage can.
Peace out.

730
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,276
Hello, ladies! You probably weren't aware

731
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,913
that you dropped a wrapper
on the ground,

732
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,076
so we're just gonna call this one
a warning.

733
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,868
Carry on.

734
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,075
- What up, dudes?
- What up, Al?

735
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,191
Hey, everybody! Check it out!

736
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:36,348
The newest member of the football team.
Suiting up for our first away game.

737
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,791
- Ry, don't mess with me.
- I talked to coach. You're in.

738
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,349
Dude! That's great! Awesome!

739
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,711
So check it out, A-man.
We're watching the new litter monitor.

740
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,593
I wasn't aware
the school even had a litter monitor.

741
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,995
We don't. But don't tell him that.

742
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,909
- Are you going to pick that up?
- No.

743
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,432
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

744
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,552
I guess I'm going to have to give you
a citation.

745
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,149
- Oh, no! I got a citation for littering!
- Oh, no!

746
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,670
You wanna play that game, do you?
Well, guess what?

747
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,233
I can play that game all day long.

748
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,157
- Simon!
- It's a joke, dude.

749
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,599
Litter is no joking matter.

750
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,833
No. You're the joke.
We're messing with you.

751
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,712
There's no such thing as a litter monitor.

752
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,152
- What?
- Good one, huh?

753
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,558
You knew about this, Alvin?

754
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,031
Does the word "brother" mean
anything to you?

755
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,673
Yes. Of course.

756
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,394
Yeah, well, he has some new brothers
now that he's on the football team.

757
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,913
You still haven't picked up that litter.

758
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,553
- You want me to get rid of litter?
- Yeah.

759
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,069
- Let's start with you.
- Hey, let... Let go. Let go!

760
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,155
No!

761
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,313
Downtown!

762
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,311
I'll catch up with you guys in a second.

763
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,075
Simon! Simon!

764
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,075
Simon!

765
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,116
Okay, I am a total jerk, I admit it.

766
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,514
So are we cool now?

767
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,200
Okay. Alvin, I am going to put this
behind us for Theodore's sake.

768
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,309
I know. That's why I'm giving you
the Alvin guarantee

769
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,028
that I will be at that
sing-off Friday night.

770
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,310
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why wouldn't you be there?

771
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,470
Because I have a...

772
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,515
- What?
- A...

773
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,796
- You have a what?
- A football game!

774
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,354
There! I said it! A football game!

775
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,231
Simon? Alvin? Is everything all right?

776
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,152
Theodore! Yeah, we're fine.

777
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,748
Just a little dumpster wrestling.

778
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,233
Crazy in here.

779
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,549
Right.

780
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,638
Don't worry, Theo!
Everything is going to be fine.

781
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,115
Alvin, do not miss that sing-off.

782
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,195
Don't worry, Simon. I'll be there.

783
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,393
I can do both.

784
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,678
Hey, guys, thanks so much
for helping out today.

785
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,030
Toys for Tots is a really cool organization.

786
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,833
So, everybody's getting cool points today.

787
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,028
- What's going on with Theodore?
- I have no idea.

788
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,158
Hey, Eleanor, why don't you see
if Theodore needs some help?

789
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,359
Well, okay.

790
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,829
They don't look very comfortable.

791
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,397
My shoes? They're not.

792
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,751
But Ian says
that I need to work on being taller.

793
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,237
Well, I think you look great
just the way you are.

794
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,835
You do?

795
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,874
Hi, you've reached Dave Seville.
Please leave a message.

796
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,792
Hi. Toby? This is Julie Ortega.
We talked yesterday.

797
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,558
Well, we kind of, sort of did.

798
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,992
Anyway, the reason I'm calling
is that I'm worried about Theodore.

799
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,717
He's been acting a little down lately.

800
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,510
I hope you're going to the sing-off Friday.

801
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,712
You know, with his dad gone, Theodore
needs all the support he can get.

802
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:53,834
So, I'll see you there.
I hope we get a chance to talk. Bye.

803
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,470
Okay, folks. Time to
get behind your undefeated Warriors.

804
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,431
The visiting Eagles are down by 5
with about 30 seconds left in the game.

805
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,790
- Time is running out for the Eagles.
- Go, Eagles!

806
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,309
Quarterback Ryan Edwards
really needs to make a move here

807
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,759
or this game is over.

808
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,833
I know they're gonna put me in.
They've gotta put me in!

809
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,598
Time out! Time out!

810
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,952
Time out, Eagles. 4th and 15
with 9 seconds remaining in the game.

811
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,073
Substitution, Eagles.

812
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,676
All right, boys. It's time for the big A.

813
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,268
I'm gonna crush them.
I'm bringing the pain!

814
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,233
- The Alvinator is in the house!
- Are you sure about this?

815
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,749
4th and 10, Xan.
We need to go with the secret weapon.

816
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,279
Trips right, Alpha left, motion on me.
Time to make history, boys.

817
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,833
- Ready!
- Break!

818
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,153
Defense!

819
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,715
- This ain't no dance, baby!
- I'm taking you down, Jennifer!

820
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,116
You're the one going down, rat face.

821
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,516
I'm gonna crack you like an acorn
and eat you for dinner,

822
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,200
with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.

823
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,028
Is he talking about my father?

824
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,517
A-42! A-42!

825
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,629
Hut!

826
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,151
Incoming!

827
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,592
- Yeah!
- Touchdown, Eagles!

828
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,393
Oh, yeah. Come on!
That's what I'm talking about.

829
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,033
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

830
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,479
And I love how awesome I am.

831
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,076
Final score, Eagles 15, Warriors 14.

832
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,397
What do you think about that,
suckers? Oh, yeah!

833
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,353
In your faces!
That's what I'm talking about.

834
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,232
You're like the Randy Moss of chipmunks.

835
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,874
Yeah! Give me an "A". Give me an "L".

836
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,911
Give me a "V". Give me an "I".
Give me an "N".

837
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,350
- What does that spell? Awesome!
- Way to go, Alvin!

838
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,358
- I'm the king of the world!
- Party with the MVP!

839
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,550
- Oh, yeah!
- Party with Alvin!

840
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,955
- You got that right.
- Everybody to the beach house!

841
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,394
Let's do it!

842
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,279
Alvin! Alvin!

843
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,435
Alvin! Alvin!

844
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,669
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

845
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,472
Chipettes! Chipettes!

846
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,229
So, look, guys, I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

847
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,994
There's plenty of time.
I'm gonna go find Alvin,

848
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,838
everything's gonna work out.

849
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,519
Thanks, Toby.

850
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,717
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Rubin.

851
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,435
Thank you, students. Thank you.

852
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,718
Welcome to our exciting
sing-off competition

853
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,274
between the Chipmunks and the Chipettes.

854
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,756
Now, remember, students,
there are no winners or losers.

855
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,793
Yeah, remind me to tell the Chipmunks
that when we blow them off the stage.

856
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,151
The group that we choose today will give
our school a chance to win $25,000

857
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,077
to save our music department.

858
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,715
So, without further ado,
I give you the Chipettes!

859
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,874
This is it, girls. Can you believe it?

860
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,679
Brittany, your time to shine, baby.
Go out there and knock them dead.

861
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,552
Yes, sir! I can do it!

862
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,799
You two, I just want to let you know
not to get in Brittany's way.

863
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,595
Okay.

864
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,597
Like what you see? Call Ian Hawke.
310-555-5309.

865
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,669
Don't worry, Simon. Alvin will walk
through that door any minute now.

866
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,229
Alvin!

867
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,158
I am back!

868
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,359
- Girls, that's for us.
- Thank you so much.

869
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,038
Thank you. Thank you.

870
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,395
Well done, ladies. And now,

871
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,118
let's hear it for a group
that will rock you like a hurricane.

872
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,756
At least that's what
many of you students have told me.

873
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,036
Here they are, the Chipmunks!

874
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,992
Hey, you know they say there's no "I"
in the word "team," and they're right.

875
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,998
But you know what there is an "I" in?
"Alvin."

876
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,997
Sucks to be you. Girls!

877
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,918
Sadly, he's correct.

878
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,917
- Did you find him?
- Guys.

879
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,470
Sorry, I searched the whole perimeter.

880
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,955
And I don't know why,
but the team's not back yet.

881
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,911
Well, what should we do?

882
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,388
I would...

883
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,552
I would ask someone who's not me.

884
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,273
I know what we should do.

885
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,038
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

886
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,590
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

887
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,919
Hi, everyone.

888
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,592
Our brother Alvin couldn't be here today.

889
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,835
The thing is,
we've never performed without Alvin.

890
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,316
And we're not starting now.

891
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,275
You can't have only 2 little pigs.

892
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,709
You can't have only 2 musketeers.

893
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,718
So, you know you can't
have only 2 Chipmunks.

894
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,674
Thank you.

895
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,152
I'll take you home.

896
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:40,190
Hear that, girls?
That is the sound of success.

897
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,395
I realize how devastated
you Chipmunk fans must be.

898
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,070
So, I guess that means that the Chipettes

899
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,519
- will be representing West Eastman...
- Come on, girls.

900
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,198
Let's take a victory lap.

901
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,557
Hey, come on, guys. Let's go.

902
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,752
- Brit, we have to.
- Let's go.

903
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,388
Yeah! Let them know!

904
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,638
Thank you. Thanks.

905
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,959
Life is good.

906
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,915
Especially when you're not a loser.

907
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,838
Hey, guys! I'm here!

908
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,115
Guys?

909
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,069
Great.

910
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,112
They're gone, Alvin.

911
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,711
They're never gonna forgive me.

912
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,073
You know, Alvin, Ian was right.

913
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,316
You don't care about anyone but yourself.

914
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,871
And by the way,
I never wanted to win this way.

915
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,590
Simon? Theodore?

916
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,358
Simon, are you awake?

917
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,035
Theo?

918
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,309
Theo!

919
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,838
Theodore? Theodore?

920
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,473
Theodore, I don't blame you
for being mad...

921
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,837
"I ran away from home.

922
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,033
"Don't look for me at the zoo,
'cause I'm not there."

923
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,673
Oh, no, Theodore.

924
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,193
Hello? Meerkat family?

925
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,599
Oh, brother.

926
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,799
Is anyone home?

927
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,517
My name is Theodore.
I'd like to be in your family.

928
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,593
Maybe they're hiding.

929
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,039
Don't be afraid!

930
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,672
You are not a meerkat.

931
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,594
Toby, you take the lions,
the tigers and the bears.

932
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,597
Simon and I will take the butterfly room.

933
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,239
Nice eagle.

934
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,271
- Theo!
- Don't move, Theodore!

935
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,393
No problem there.

936
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,313
Hang in there! Hang in there, little guy!

937
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,271
We're gonna get you out of there!

938
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,196
Okay, okay, we need a plan.
We need a carefully executed plan.

939
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,673
Or you could just run in there
like a maniac.

940
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,317
- Theo, watch out!
- Hi, I'm Theodore.

941
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,394
Hey, birdie! Over here! Are you hungry?

942
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,715
'Cause this "A" stands for "appetizer"!

943
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,469
Let's all just relax
and we'll talk this out. Okay?

944
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,270
Look, I get why you want Theodore. I do.

945
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,680
But, I'm sorry, I can't let that happen.

946
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,753
He's my brother. Not that he'd know that,

947
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,838
because I've been such a big jerk lately.

948
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,599
If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

949
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,319
Not literally!

950
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,839
I got you, Alvin!

951
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,349
Move it!

952
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,633
- Theo.
- Help!

953
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,116
Guys, it's a wedge-tail eagle.

954
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,356
Their only mortal enemy
is the pygmy elephant.

955
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,391
Luckily, I speak a little pachyderm.

956
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,679
I think it's working!

957
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,555
Or not!

958
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,953
Guys, that was huge.

959
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,439
He's right.

960
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,917
So, are we back to 1 for all
and 3 for 1?

961
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,391
Come on, Simon. Hug it out.

962
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,352
You know I'm sorry, Si.

963
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,718
Si? Don't make me have to kiss you!

964
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,796
Because I'll do it. I don't care.

965
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,595
Here come the lips.
Make-out train is leaving the station.

966
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,955
- Think I'll take that hug.
- Guys.

967
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:57,512
Interested? Call Ian Hawke.
310-555-5309.

968
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,713
Deloris, get me that
Ian Hawke on the phone.

969
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,199
- There you are...
- Hi.

970
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,914
my sweet little moneymakers.

971
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,709
Do you remember when I told you
that I would make you all big stars?

972
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,432
- Yeah.
- Well,

973
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,753
guess who's opening up for Britney
Spears at the Staples Center tonight?

974
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,070
- Yeah!
- Pinch me. Am I dreaming? Oh, my gosh.

975
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,953
Wait, tonight?
We'll miss the school contest.

976
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,034
That is correct.
You will miss the school contest.

977
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,515
You're so smart.
I can never get anything past you.

978
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,154
It was never about
that stupid school contest.

979
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:38,319
It was always about
making Brittany a star.

980
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,156
That's what you wanted, right?

981
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,756
- Well, yeah.
- Well, tonight's your big chance.

982
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,952
It's all about you, Brittany.

983
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,230
What about Jeanette and Eleanor?

984
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,113
Yeah, well, they can sing backup.
I got them some stuff, too.

985
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,435
Hey!

986
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,030
But we're her sisters.

987
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,392
And the 3 of us sing together
or not at all.

988
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,033
Okay, fine. All I really need is the B-girl.

989
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,350
Ian, I won't do it without them.

990
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,592
Okay. Fine, fine. Let's move on to plan B.

991
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,636
- Okay! Who likes barbecue?
- Barbecue?

992
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,877
Because I know this awesome little
barbecue restaurant in the Valley

993
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,877
that makes the best roasted chipmunk.

994
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,157
Real tasty.

995
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,589
Unless, of course, you wanna sing.

996
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:41,435
Welcome to West Eastman, and thank you
for supporting music in our schools.

997
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,870
Now, remember,
the group you pick tonight

998
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,673
will win $25,000 for their school!

999
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,035
Now, we've got a lot of acts,
and we have to turn the heat off at 9:30,

1000
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,550
so without any further ado,
representing Orange Grove,

1001
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,036
put your hands together for Li'l Rosero!

1002
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,151
So, we meet again.

1003
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,600
What? You want a piece of this, eagle?

1004
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,550
- Ian Hawke?
- I'll take that.

1005
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,511
I didn't realize
I pocket-dialed 1-800-LOWLIFE.

1006
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,312
- Alvin?
- Brittany?

1007
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,034
Yeah, could you guys fill in for us?

1008
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,437
We're not gonna be able
to perform tonight.

1009
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,711
What about the music department?
The whole school is counting on you.

1010
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,991
I know. I know.
I should have listened to you about Ian.

1011
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,749
- Don't tell me!
- Yep. He locked us in a cage.

1012
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,553
What? This is the biggest you have?

1013
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,352
I had my assistant call
and ask for the biggest limo.

1014
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,754
This is not the biggest limo you have.

1015
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,711
I'll go break the news to Dr. Rubin.

1016
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,991
- Brittany?
- Alvin, don't move!

1017
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,519
You got it!

1018
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:13,110
Brittany, I'm coming to get you.
Simon, tell Jeanette how to pick the lock.

1019
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,229
Roger that!

1020
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,039
Oh, man. I need to get to the girls, fast!

1021
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,154
I know how!

1022
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,197
Jeanette, focus. The 3rd number is
notoriously the hardest to crack.

1023
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,390
I'm assuming it's a prime number,
but we can't assume...

1024
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:42,638
Simon! The first 2 numbers were ones.
I got to go with one.

1025
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,239
- It opened!
- All right, girls.

1026
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,430
Ian's coming.
Put the phone back. Hurry!

1027
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,677
- Get ready to be fabulous.
- We're ready.

1028
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,869
Yeah, you better be.

1029
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,151
Because tonight's performance is
going to put me back on top.

1030
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,553
Next up, please welcome Charice!

1031
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:25,512
Driver-man, take me to the arena.
VIP entrance.

1032
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,315
How about a little moon roof action?
Moon roofs are go!

1033
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,471
Rooves? Moon roof.
Roofs? Rooves?

1034
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,794
Champagne. Don't mind if I do.

1035
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,597
You know why I don't mind if I do?

1036
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:46,352
Because tonight, we've got to toast
to a very special someone

1037
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,833
named me.

1038
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,269
They said I couldn't do it.
They said I'd never bounce back.

1039
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,997
Guess what? Time to kiss my sweet...

1040
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,794
Oh, yeah.

1041
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,555
A toast to the ladies who're gonna make
the world forget about the Chip...

1042
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,157
- What...
- See you!

1043
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,318
No. No, no, no! No!

1044
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,836
What are you doing? Alvin!

1045
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,353
Hi, Ian! Good to see you!
You never write!

1046
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,278
- No! Brittany... No!
- Come on, girls!

1047
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,311
I signed a contract!

1048
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,919
- Jump, Jeanette!
- Wait!

1049
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,116
- I'm not really good at...
- I got you.

1050
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,912
I'm dead if you don't perform!

1051
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,519
- Punch it, Alvin!
- You got it!

1052
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,278
- No! Don't!
- Hey, Ian!

1053
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,630
In the words of the Donald,
"You're fired!"

1054
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,954
Alvin!

1055
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,990
Hey! Hey. Hey, guys.
Any sign of Alvin yet? Huh?

1056
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,111
No. No Alvin, and no Chipettes.

1057
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:52,949
Just Dr. Rubin and, you know,
the entire school counting on us.

1058
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,673
Well... Yeah, you know, don't worry.

1059
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,029
Everything will work out-ish.

1060
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,598
- Faster, Alvin!
- Don't worry.

1061
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,154
I'm gonna get a little help
from my friend Digger!

1062
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,639
- Roger that, Alvin!
- Look out!

1063
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,112
Feels like I'm back at the race track.

1064
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,633
- Hey! Careful!
- Keep going! What are you doing?

1065
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,715
Yeah.

1066
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,310
Wait till I tell everybody back home
I saved Alvin Seville.

1067
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,835
I guess I owe you an apology about Ian.

1068
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,349
Stick with me, Brit.
I'll never steer you wrong.

1069
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,950
Oh, yeah. I'll never doubt you again.

1070
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,955
I gotta say, he is definitely persistent.

1071
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,470
- We have got to lose him.
- Hang on!

1072
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,992
I've got a plan.
Jump on the count of 3.

1073
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,189
3!

1074
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,908
That's it.

1075
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,678
I'm not really good with heights.

1076
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,597
Just hang on tight, Jeanette.

1077
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,392
Bring my girls right to me.

1078
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,751
- We need the remote.
- Guys, I know what to do.

1079
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,677
It's hats off to Ian.

1080
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,559
The remote!

1081
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,511
I can't reach it!

1082
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,471
I'm going for it. Grab my ankles.

1083
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,874
I got it!

1084
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,154
I got it.

1085
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,790
- Way to go, Jen!
- Nice work, Jeanette!

1086
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,596
Good going, Jen! Hey, Ian,
you were wrong. I don't need these!

1087
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,880
- My bad!
- Adiós, Ian!

1088
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,754
And now for our final act of the night.

1089
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,189
Now, listen, we've had
a last-second change to the line-up,

1090
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,629
but we don't think
you're gonna be too disappointed.

1091
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,469
Representing West Eastman,
it's the Chipmunks!

1092
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,994
We may have to go out there, Theodore.

1093
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,699
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

1094
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,219
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

1095
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:10,609
Chipmunks!

1096
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,428
Well, if there are no Chipmunks,
we're gonna have to move on. So now...

1097
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,470
I don't wanna be booed again.

1098
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,757
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to move on.

1099
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,994
Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! I...

1100
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,876
I'm not a Chipmunk, as you can see.

1101
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,996
Play some music, you loser!

1102
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,792
- Play some music!
- Yeah!

1103
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,239
- More music!
- Play some music!

1104
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,475
Okay, okay.

1105
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,592
Okay, okay, I got a song.
I got a song, I got a song.

1106
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,439
<i>Hi</i>

1107
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,355
Hi.

1108
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,351
Now, that was huge.

1109
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,671
Thank you. Thank you.
No, really. Thank you.

1110
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,997
- What the...
- The Chipettes are in the building!

1111
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,508
- It's the Chipettes!
- Alvin!

1112
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,148
- Theo!
- Hello, West Eastman!

1113
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,313
I'm putting her down! Hang on!

1114
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,158
- Alvin!
- Double high-five, brother.

1115
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,031
High-five!

1116
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,117
Ladies and gentlemen,
representing West Eastman,

1117
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,196
it is my great pleasure...

1118
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,072
This is such an honor.

1119
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,039
For you or for us?

1120
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,149
- For us.
- For us.

1121
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,713
Jinx! Double-jinx! Triple-jinx!

1122
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,159
Quadruple-jinx! Infinity-jinx!

1123
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,633
Guys! We get it.

1124
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,433
- Huddle up, gang.
- Okay, here's the plan.

1125
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,597
I give you the Chipettes
and the Chipmunks!

1126
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,434
- Dave!
- Dave!

1127
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,876
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1128
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,752
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1129
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:50,352
Hey, everybody. It's clear
that we have a winner of the $25,000!

1130
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,392
And it's West Eastman High!
West Eastman High!

1131
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,794
- Guys, we did it!
- Yeah!

1132
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,188
- Wow!
- Can you believe it?

1133
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,078
A little something
for the music department.

1134
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,788
All right!

1135
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,791
Right back at you, Dr. Rubes!

1136
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,269
Oh, yeah!

1137
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,154
- Chipettes! Chipettes!
- Chipettes! Chipettes!

1138
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,077
Ladies and gentlemen,

1139
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:17,479
the Staples Center is proud
to welcome the Chipettes!

1140
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:23,836
Hi, everyone.
I'm Jeanette. And I'm Eleanor.

1141
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,878
And I'm Brittany!

1142
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,675
And we're the Chipettes!

1143
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,438
- What?
- What is that?

1144
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,553
1, 2, 3.

1145
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,469
That's not the Chipettes!

1146
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,629
- Come on, lady.
- I know, I know. All right, I'm sorry.

1147
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,194
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I know, I'm sorry!

1148
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,435
I'm going!

1149
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,954
- Dave! You're dancing!
- You're moving good, Dave!

1150
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,354
- Yeah!
- Welcome home.

1151
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,550
So, did you miss us?

1152
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:10,797
- Of course I missed you. You're my boys.
- Cool!

1153
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,151
And, Dave, just think how much
you'd miss us if there were 6 of us.

1154
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,395
Alvin, what did you say?

1155
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,637
Well, the Chipettes needed
a place to crash, right?

1156
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,796
So, I said that you said

1157
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,912
they could stay with us
for as long as they needed to.

1158
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:27,635
- Alvin!
- Okay! This one's for Dave.

1159
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,354
Everybody,
shake what your mamma gave you!

1160
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,800
Arigon

1161
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,838
Look at you. All ready for bed.

1162
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,595
Looks like the Chipettes
are a good influence.

1163
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,914
- Thanks, Dave.
- Thanks, Dave.

1164
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,234
Thanks, Dave.

1165
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,598
Okay, guys. Now lights out.
Good night, everybody.

1166
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:19,789
- Good night, Jeanette.
- Good night, Simon.

1167
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,273
Good night, Dave. Good night, Alvin.

1168
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,396
- Alvin?
- I'm not tired.

1169
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,476
Sorry, but you've got school tomorrow.

1170
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,394
Not tired.

1171
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,276
Alvin, come on. It's time for bed.

1172
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,719
- Not tired.
- Alvin?

1173
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,358
Still not tired. More awake. Tired.

1174
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,675
- Just kidding. Much more awake.
- Alvin, that's it.

1175
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,040
- Don't make me come over there.
- Okay.

1176
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,510
Boy! I suddenly got really, really tired.

1177
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,109
Night, Dave.

1178
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,310
Alvin!

1179
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:19,757
Good start, gentlemen. Only 10 more
rows of bleachers to go. Let's do it.

1180
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,791
All right, guys.
All right. All right.

1181
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,388
All right, I'm out. I'm out.
Is this necessary?

1182
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,398
Come on. Is that necessary?
Is that...

1183
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,519
At least let me go back and get my purse.
