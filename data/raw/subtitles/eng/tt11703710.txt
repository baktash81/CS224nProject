00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,614
Serve the Lord, rejoicing
in the power of His spirit.

9
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:28,675
And the blessing
of Almighty God,

10
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:31,207
the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit

11
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,370
be with you

12
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:34,915
and remain with you
forever.

13
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,042
Amen.

14
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:37,699
Amen.

15
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:13,409
They are coming. Look.

16
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,516
If possible, please
look this way, please.

17
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:42,007
- I have never seen a wedding like this.
- Grander than ours.

18
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,220
There.

19
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:53,211
I didn't hear any congratulations
from you.

20
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:54,281
Don't provoke.

21
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:55,894
I wish the boy good things.

22
00:02:55,895 --> 00:02:56,931
I do.

23
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:00,415
Very clever.

24
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:05,489
- Mary.
- Hello.

25
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,407
- Honey, have you seen the cake?
- It's beautiful.

26
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:09,524
Smile.

27
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:14,609
It is charming.

28
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,017
Careful, children.

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,221
Thank you.

30
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:28,276
They will live here.

31
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:30,104
And I'm going to Dower House.

32
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:33,579
The thought of a warmer winter
is like a strong drink.

33
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,993
I can imagine.

34
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:36,581
Let's cut the cake.

35
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,728
Thank you for letting me
be so happy.

36
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,212
I feel that I have received
much more than I deserve.

37
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:46,135
Well, it's an encouraging start.

38
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:52,627
Bravo.

39
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:04,126
Splendid.
Look at the size of the cake.

40
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:11,627
- Bye.
- Send a card.

41
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:12,906
- Thank you.
- Bye.

42
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:14,033
- Good-bye.
- Have a good trip.

43
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:15,438
- Be careful.
- Of course.

44
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:23,921
Bye.

45
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:26,921
Goodbye.

46
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:29,209
Goodbye.

47
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:35,431
Congratulations.

48
00:04:41,524 --> 00:04:43,216
I received a letter from Mr. Murray.

49
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,892
He is coming to Downton on Tuesday.

50
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,794
- Why did you call him?
- I didn't.

51
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:48,740
It was his grandmother who called him.

52
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,426
He wants us there.

53
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:52,754
Rosamund, you should come with us.

54
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:55,322
- My goodness!
- Why do you say that?

55
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:59,418
There is only one reason for ladies
call their lawyers.

56
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:28,190
Sit down.

57
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,794
I feel like the Andromeda
chained to a rock

58
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,896
with you hovering over me.

59
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:37,698
I don't know why Murray
called them without asking me.

60
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:38,996
Neither do we.

61
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:40,891
Denker.

62
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:43,003
Mr. Murray will be here soon.

63
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:44,886
He has arrived, milady.

64
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,909
He said that the lady
is waiting for him.

65
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,215
What? Why didn't you tell me?

66
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,316
You shouldn't be
so suspicious.

67
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,085
You told them,
Lady Grantham? Good.

68
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:58,113
Please.

69
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,912
She didn't say anything.

70
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:01,808
Well, that's easy to tell.

71
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:05,792
I took possession of a mansion
in the South of France.

72
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:09,700
And now I have given the mansion
to my great-granddaughter, Sybbie.

73
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:10,725
What?

74
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:13,233
Which part don't you understand?

75
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,030
I didn't understand any part of it.

76
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:16,720
What mansion? Where?

77
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:18,886
This is too extraordinary
to talk about.

78
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:22,005
It is <i>La Villa des Colombes</i>,
and it's near Toulon.

79
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,526
But why is it yours?

80
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,633
And why did
did you never talk about it?

81
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,909
Because I thought it was a joke.

82
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,020
Start at the beginning.

83
00:06:30,404 --> 00:06:33,504
Years ago,
before you were born,

84
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:35,208
I was in France,

85
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,997
and I met a man,

86
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,097
the Marquis of Montmirail.

87
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,590
And he invited me
to spend some time

88
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:43,497
in the mansion
that he had just bought.

89
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:46,196
About a year later,
he sent me a letter

90
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,998
and said that he had
transferred the mansion

91
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,131
for my name.

92
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:54,725
I never thought it was serious,
so I didn't pay attention.

93
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,006
But wasn't it a joke?

94
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:57,216
I guess not.

95
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:01,286
He died recently,
and to the widow's dismay,

96
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,793
the mansion they have used
in winter for years,

97
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:06,301
was registered in the name
of Lady Grantham.

98
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,327
He never changed.

99
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,510
- Now, I need signatures.
- Of course.

100
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:11,514
Why did you give the mansion
to Sybbie?

101
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,879
Your children are
well established here,

102
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,395
and Edith is
more than well taken care of,

103
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:20,202
but Brompton will be a son
of Tom and Lucy.

104
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:23,821
So Sybil's only daughter
will inherit little,

105
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,756
and I wanted to correct this.

106
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:29,713
What family does he have,
this man, Montmirail?

107
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:33,208
The widow and a son,
the present marquis.

108
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:36,109
The mother is interested in taking
the matter to court.

109
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,047
- You can't blame her.
- Why not?

110
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:40,400
If her husband wanted
the place to be mine,

111
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,720
why should we argue?

112
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,842
Have you never thought of refusing?

113
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,407
Do I look like I'm turning down
a mansion in the South of France?

114
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,025
Mr. Murray?

115
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,305
- May I ask you a favor?
- Please.

116
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:57,739
I have an assignment for you.

117
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,705
Everything is explained in this letter.

118
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:02,089
I will call you in a few days
to clarify doubts.

119
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,408
Of course, Lady Grantham.

120
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:06,535
- Now I hear my train calling.
- Goodbye, Mr. Murray.

121
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:07,713
And thank you.

122
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:15,415
You want me to tell you
why he did it,

123
00:08:15,706 --> 00:08:19,322
But the truth is, I don't know.

124
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:22,319
And so, I will say good night,

125
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:26,884
and let them argue
about my mysterious past.

126
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:29,517
Denker, don't lead me on.

127
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:32,205
I am not a car.

128
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:34,134
Unfortunately.

129
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:36,862
I ask for forgiveness.

130
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,377
<i>Really should try it...</i>

131
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:39,901
That sounds strange.

132
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:42,335
They spend a few days
at the same resort

133
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:44,070
for more than 60 years,

134
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:45,501
and he gives her a house.

135
00:08:45,502 --> 00:08:47,694
I suppose he was not
just a lunatic.

136
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,336
That is what they will try to prove.

137
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:52,203
I think it's admirable of Grandma
to want to take care of Sybbie.

138
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:54,788
Even though Mr. Montmirail
is a stone-cold madman.

139
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:56,723
But why did Mama
never commented?

140
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:59,951
As far as she knows, she received
a very eccentric letter

141
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:01,994
for more than half a century.

142
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:04,025
You thought it was a waste of time
at the moment,

143
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,625
and never thought about it again.

144
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,812
<i>- Very good, Marigold.
- Go ahead.</i>

145
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:13,383
<i>I find it amazing that they have...</i>

146
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:16,429
<i>- That's right. Good move.
- Stay back.</i>

147
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:18,921
Grandma, look.

148
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,922
A call for you.

149
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:23,809
- Who is it?
- A Mr. Barber.

150
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,795
- It's from British Lion.
- What is it?

151
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:27,805
It's a film production company, isn't it?

152
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:29,718
I'd better find out
what he wants.

153
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:33,626
What are you going to do with the mansion
in the summer?

154
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:35,662
They can't go.
Nobody goes there in the summer.

155
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:37,899
- Now go.
- It sure is hot.

156
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,039
Apparently not.

157
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,703
- Mommy!
- Hi, sweetheart.

158
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,007
Mommy, come and play.

159
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:44,907
It's a race. Come on. Hurry up.

160
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,969
"Good deeds..."

161
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,111
Mr. Barber became
a producer and director.

162
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:58,365
He wants to practice
chronophotography here.

163
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,091
It's not the Stone Age,
Dad.

164
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:02,079
He wants to make
a film on Downton?

165
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,223
What did you say?

166
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:06,096
- I declined gently.
- I'll call back.

167
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:08,501
- I want to hear his offer.
- For what?

168
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:10,127
I suppose there will be a payment.

169
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:12,714
- When will Henry be back?
- There is no time for that.

170
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:13,895
Where is he now?

171
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:17,201
His last message came
from Istanbul or somewhere else.

172
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:20,107
But as far as I'm concerned,
the rally idea is noisy.

173
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:21,387
You can manage without it.

174
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,300
Got it.
So it's up to me, right?

175
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:25,994
Don't expect us to deal
with movie people.

176
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:28,281
First, let's hear
his proposal.

177
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,201
Come, Mary.
I'll keep you company.

178
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:31,851
The money will be useful, that's for sure.

179
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:35,016
Is everything okay with Henry?

180
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:37,403
He is passionate about cars.

181
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:40,742
Passionate about speed.
Passionate about adventure.

182
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,287
Besides being in love
with me, I guess.

183
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:45,682
But I don't nullify the other three.

184
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:48,848
- And you thought you would?
- I guess I did.

185
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:50,933
Ready for you.

186
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:08,905
It is perfect.

187
00:11:10,023 --> 00:11:13,288
Until recently, cinema
was confined to the studios,

188
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:15,332
but now,
this process is changing.

189
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,965
Napoléon, by Abel Gance,
last year,

190
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:19,954
showed what a camera
does on location,

191
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:21,994
filming in a house,
in real landscapes.

192
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,441
What kind of film?

193
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:26,514
The Gambleris, made in 1875.

194
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:29,147
The daughter of an earl,
Lady Anne Erskine,

195
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,829
fell in love with a man
who was a gambler,

196
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,030
- to the horror of the family.
- I can imagine.

197
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:35,903
They meet
in a country house

198
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,557
and things get out of hand.

199
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:41,130
There are visitors at a gaming club,
which would be here.

200
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:43,100
A gambling club in Downton?

201
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:44,516
That would end up with Grandma.

202
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:46,221
And with Daddy, too.

203
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,500
- We need to think.
- Of course.

204
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,433
Here is my card.

205
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:52,918
Call me at
if you have any questions.

206
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,551
Barrow will accompany you.

207
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:57,178
I believe that there are questions
that need answers

208
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,225
before we actually discuss.

209
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:01,341
We would stay here
about a month,

210
00:12:01,342 --> 00:12:03,888
and if you turn the card over,
you will see how much we will pay.

211
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,152
Of course, this is negotiable.

212
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:09,415
- Goodbye, Mr. Barber!
- Goodbye, Mr. Barber!

213
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:17,838
And that's just for starters?

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,752
I think it's a horrible idea.

215
00:12:22,753 --> 00:12:26,905
Highly Makeup Actresses
and plastered actors,

216
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:28,518
messing up our stuff.

217
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,646
We would continue to count
the spoons.

218
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,520
The locals would
with bad eyes.

219
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:34,374
You must not let
it stop you.

220
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,361
The county takes a dim view
of everything.

221
00:12:36,362 --> 00:12:38,168
You should consider the money.

222
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:39,861
We don't need to
talk about money.

223
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:41,721
But you need to think about it.

224
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:43,446
We can have a new roof.

225
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:45,734
Soon we will have real floods,
and then what?

226
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,768
If you refuse,
do you think we can convince them

227
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,675
driving further north
to Bancaster?

228
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,265
Mom, what do you think?

229
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:56,533
Mary, dear, would you take your father
to see the attics?

230
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:59,226
I don't believe
that he has visited recently.

231
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:12,873
I haven't been here in years.

232
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:15,172
Well, this is our
current situation.

233
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,623
With the money, we can
put the house in order

234
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:19,857
balancing what we spend
on the property,

235
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:22,896
and enter the 1930s
with our heads held high.

236
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:24,930
- But if you don't want to...
- No.

237
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:29,359
No, you will command.

238
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:31,661
You are the captain now.

239
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:35,127
I am aware of that,
even if I think otherwise.

240
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,887
And now I have
the unenviable task

241
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:41,993
to break the news to Mr. Carson.

242
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:44,386
I don't believe it.
Making a movie here?

243
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:45,566
Can they do that?

244
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:47,331
Will it be a movie with stars?
Celebrities?

245
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:49,524
Give him some water before he passes out.

246
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:50,911
There is nothing decided yet.

247
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:54,074
It's okay to get excited.
You live on the farm.

248
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:56,261
The rest of us will come and go

249
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:58,560
around every hour
that God gives us.

250
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:02,150
And what about His Lordship?
Hoping for a peaceful end.

251
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:05,533
And suddenly he plunged
into a three-ring circus.

252
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:06,996
Well, I agree with Daisy.

253
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:10,049
We will meet men and women
that we only see on the screen.

254
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,002
- It will be good for home.
- That's the thing.

255
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:14,849
- This money will make a difference.
- How much did they say?

256
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,028
It's none of your business,
if they talked.

257
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,175
- They didn't speak.
- Well, good night.

258
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:20,424
- Good evening.
- Good night.

259
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:23,901
Still, times change,
and we must change with them.

260
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:26,175
Mrs. Parker.
We should go home too.

261
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:27,920
Very good, Mr. Parker.
Let's go.

262
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:33,560
Daisy is more obedient
with him than with me.

263
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:35,578
Maybe he will make her happier.

264
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:37,184
Well, I did my best.

265
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:44,054
A movie? In Downton?

266
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:46,674
I know it seems unlikely,

267
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:49,901
but I'm not sure
if it is that horrible.

268
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:51,234
I disagree.

269
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:54,240
Rude and vulgar actors
and actresses

270
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:57,102
walking through the rooms
with his sticky fingers,

271
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:58,443
sitting on the chairs,

272
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,451
eating at the table where once
sat the King of England?

273
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:06,011
This smacks of the worst excesses
of the French Revolution.

274
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:09,298
Should we ask them to stand
stand and put gloves on them?

275
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:12,531
This is a fall, Elsie.
It's a fall.

276
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:15,166
They are flirting
with the mafia.

277
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:18,079
But it will pay, Charlie,
and they need the money.

278
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,172
With this argument, why
not open the place to the public

279
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:23,646
and have them poking and prodding
and poking around every corner?

280
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,187
We tried this once,

281
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:28,287
and I thought we had all
decided never again.

282
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:33,799
Keep this up
and you will have a heart attack.

283
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,920
I would be better off out of it
if that's what it's come to.

284
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,671
Andy, could you fold
this newspaper straight?

285
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,404
I will take him with me upstairs.

286
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:52,452
Of course.

287
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:56,703
Then a film will be made
in the big house.

288
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:58,577
What will this mean
for you?

289
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:01,614
- I can't say for sure.
- But it will be exciting.

290
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:04,409
See how a movie is made,
meet the stars.

291
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,412
I would stay away from them
if I were you.

292
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:07,923
I would stay away from everything.

293
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:09,978
I'll say good night, then.

294
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:12,034
- Good evening.
- Good night.

295
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:17,388
I forgot the newspaper,
after all.

296
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:20,802
Memory of a Mosquito.

297
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:23,975
Good evening.

298
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,565
Remember, it's his farm.
Not ours.

299
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:30,948
It's Lord Grantham's,
he's just the tenant.

300
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,654
Maybe, but don't say anything
that you will regret.

301
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:34,865
This is the problem.

302
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,935
And in the end, where will we be?

303
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,477
Murray requested a translation
of the will.

304
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,175
Apparently, Montmirail
talks about an idyllic interlude

305
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:48,627
he spent with his mother
before getting married.

306
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:50,423
And what else does Murray have to say?

307
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:51,598
It's strange.

308
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,563
The widow wants to fight
for the will,

309
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:56,113
but the son thinks he can
make an amicable agreement.

310
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:59,654
I would wire the mansion
and seal the windows.

311
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:01,744
He wants us to visit him there.

312
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:03,125
Mom can't travel,

313
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:05,266
but asked to take
Tom and Lucy with us,

314
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:07,726
now that he knows that Sybbie
must be the beneficiary.

315
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,740
What do you think?

316
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:09,741
Good,

317
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:11,593
we could get to know
Lucy better.

318
00:17:11,884 --> 00:17:13,644
With luck, it means
we would lose

319
00:17:13,645 --> 00:17:15,370
this whole terrible film
of Mary's.

320
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:19,165
I found it. Myrna Dalgleish.

321
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,462
I knew I had one of her own.

322
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,488
Her beauty is so classic.

323
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:23,919
I have one of his.

324
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,317
Guy Dexter in Casanova.

325
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:28,980
Just the thought makes me red.

326
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,325
He has something special.

327
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:32,101
Like an animal
ready to jump.

328
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:33,837
Jump on you, you say.

329
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:36,701
That's enough. Andy and I will be
jealous if you don't take care of yourself.

330
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,039
I like that.

331
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:43,302
I hate to know that you will miss
all the fun.

332
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:46,965
I am nervous now about leaving
you alone with Guy Dexter.

333
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,779
The chances would be good.

334
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:51,779
- <i>What do you think, Bertie?</i>
- A complication.

335
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:54,726
Tom says they need to
bring Maud Bagshaw.

336
00:17:54,727 --> 00:17:57,048
She is with them
until her house is ready.

337
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,614
We can stay in a hotel.

338
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,060
In that case, can we go?

339
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,447
- I would love to.
- Wouldn't we get in the way?

340
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:06,123
- Everyone goes, except me?
- I am.

341
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:08,009
I will do an article about people

342
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,876
who visit the South of France
in the summer.

343
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:12,550
Are you writing again?
That's great.

344
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,905
Edith returned to the magazine
two days a week.

345
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:16,252
What about little Peter?

346
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:18,340
She has a wonderful nanny,
thank God.

347
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:20,737
Can you really work
with two children

348
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:22,638
and take care of a house
like Brancaster?

349
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,687
Ask me in six months.

350
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,539
I am happy to know that you are
using your mind again.

351
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,175
We hope it is still there.

352
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,798
I will call Montmirail tomorrow

353
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,559
to say that we will be
at the hotel.

354
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,484
I think he will be relieved.

355
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:37,567
Come in.

356
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:41,366
I saw that the lights were still on.
were still on.

357
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:44,977
I suppose you agree with Dad

358
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:46,820
that the idea of the film
is too banal

359
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:48,436
to be taken into consideration.

360
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:52,614
Nothing is so banal if it will serve
to keep Downton going.

361
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:54,799
We will have money
to redo the roof.

362
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,360
At the cost of a terrible month.

363
00:18:57,361 --> 00:19:00,028
Frankly, I believe
that it will be very terrible.

364
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:03,664
But seeing those buckets
collecting rainwater in the attic

365
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:04,902
is also terrible.

366
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:07,559
We went through the war.
We will go through it too.

367
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,511
But you must be firm, Mary.

368
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:14,567
For these people, women
like us have two categories:

369
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:17,261
dragons and fools.

370
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:20,642
You have to make sure that they will see you
as a dragon.

371
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:29,492
Mr. Bates and Mrs. Baxter will take care of

372
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:30,832
of Lord and Lady Grantham.

373
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,726
The rest will stay at Downton
to help the people in the film.

374
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:35,587
I won't help anyone.

375
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:37,859
Unlike
of Ms. No-fairy-ness,

376
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,541
I would love to help.

377
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:42,046
May I be Mrs. Dalgleish's
of Mrs. Dalgleish's company?

378
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,138
I asked Anna to do that.

379
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:47,588
I don't mean to be a pain, Daisy,
but your job is here.

380
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,892
Do we know if Mrs. Dalgleish
will stay in the house?

381
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:52,567
Yes, it will stay with the director
and the protagonist.

382
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,556
The rest will stay in the mansion.

383
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:57,129
Now I have to go
to see Lady Mary.

384
00:19:57,678 --> 00:19:59,132
Don't worry, Daisy.

385
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:01,179
Anna will find a way
to get you there.

386
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,803
I would trade it all in for a trip
to the south of France.

387
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:04,804
Daisy?

388
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,633
I believe he
is opposed, milady,

389
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:13,412
and says that you must observe
and keep them under control.

390
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,006
I don't know if it will be of much help.

391
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:18,243
We need to get rid of it.

392
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:19,850
But how?

393
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,283
Should I travel to France
with the others?

394
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:25,309
Really?

395
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:29,888
She is worried that everything
is foreign to Your Lordship.

396
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:32,341
And neither Mr. Bates
or Mrs. Baxter

397
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:35,289
will have the authority to make sure
that everything is done right.

398
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,544
Yes, I understand.

399
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:38,754
Your Lordship needs
you, Charlie.

400
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:41,770
Only you can show them
how things should be done.

401
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,691
Don't worry about it.

402
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:46,953
They had better be warned.
The British are coming.

403
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,005
But what would I do with it?

404
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:51,733
And wouldn't it be an imposition
on the Montmirails?

405
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:55,048
He wants to be useful to you,
Papa, as he always has.

406
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:56,486
I could not show him

407
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,581
that he is of great help
just by being there?

408
00:20:58,582 --> 00:21:00,232
I will, since you insist,

409
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:02,896
but it seems too
sentimental to me.

410
00:21:05,091 --> 00:21:06,678
<i>Wait right here.</i>

411
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,440
<i>Right, go after him.</i>

412
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,092
BRITISH LION
CINEMATOGRAFIA LTDA

413
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:13,513
<i>You two, come on, pull.</i>

414
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:15,533
<i>Follow the closet, ma'am.
Give it to me.</i>

415
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:16,840
<i>It will show you where to take it.</i>

416
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:19,888
- No, that's private.
- I understand.

417
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:22,386
Over here. Here it is.

418
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:26,528
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

419
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:34,512
Yes, please. That's it.
You are an angel.

420
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,697
Hello, Mr. Molesley.
Why are you here?

421
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,904
You know I love everything
that has to do with movies.

422
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:08,785
- I know you like to go to the movies.
- It is more than that.

423
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:12,302
For me, Hollywood is
the real dream factory.

424
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,278
And I need dreams
as much as any man.

425
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:18,768
All this for one woman?

426
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:22,274
This is the closet
of Mrs. Dalgleish.

427
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:24,581
I know, it's so elegant.

428
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:31,917
No, do it the right way.

429
00:22:45,508 --> 00:22:47,665
- Sorry.
- Nice and easy, guys.

430
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,014
<i>Continue, put it there.</i>

431
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,611
<i>Thank you very much. Here you go.</i>

432
00:22:51,612 --> 00:22:52,865
<i>Look where you tread.</i>

433
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,891
You are here hiding
from the invaders.

434
00:22:56,892 --> 00:23:00,214
Sybbie! Hello, dear.
What a pleasant surprise.

435
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:03,616
She came to stay with her cousins
while we are in France.

436
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:05,115
We talk about you.

437
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:06,697
About me, Grandpa? Why?

438
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:08,624
For numerous reasons, all good.

439
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,065
I present to you
Miss Dalgleish.

440
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:12,769
My father, Lord Grantham.

441
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,712
She is one of the stars
of our film.

442
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:16,155
I believe easily.

443
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:18,223
Welcome to Downton,
Miss Dalgleish.

444
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:26,162
The modern world comes to Downton.

445
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:28,789
Did you tell our host
that we will stay in a hotel?

446
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,589
He would not listen. He insists
to stay in the mansion.

447
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,963
Even going to steal it?

448
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:35,827
He seems like a very nice guy
and has impeccable English,

449
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:38,300
which is more than can
be said of my French.

450
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:40,024
Mr. Guy Dexter.

451
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:44,295
Welcome, Mr. Dexter.
I am Lord Grantham.

452
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:46,665
This is my daughter,
Lady Mary Talbot.

453
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:50,117
She will take care of you,
since we are going to the Riviera.

454
00:23:50,118 --> 00:23:52,429
But I hope you have fun here.

455
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,085
I would go with you if I could.

456
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:56,006
- Are you English?
- Yes.

457
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:58,879
I went to America ten years ago
to try my luck,

458
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,289
and I've been there ever since.

459
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,749
I am not the only one.

460
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,362
They call us
the Hollywood Raj,

461
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:05,129
we play cricket
cricket once a week.

462
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,989
And the weather never stops playing.

463
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,463
Do you know the South of France?

464
00:24:08,464 --> 00:24:11,529
The last time there, I was left
on the roof of the Negresco

465
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,259
with Ronald Colman
and Gloria Swanson.

466
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,435
- On the roof?
- You can tell us at dinner.

467
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:18,122
- When will they go?
- Tomorrow.

468
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,228
Dover, Calais
and then the Blue Train to Nice.

469
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:22,706
That sounds enviable.

470
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:25,519
- When will your director arrive?
- He will come for dinner.

471
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:27,210
Don't you think so, Myrna?

472
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,144
How would I know?

473
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:35,867
Myrna Dalgleish in this house.

474
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:37,537
It's amazing.

475
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:39,990
Her father sold fruit
at the Borough market.

476
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:42,259
Now look at her.
A goddess of the screen.

477
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,098
And you will be her servant.

478
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,293
She brought
a mountain of luggage,

479
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:49,992
I thought that you and Anna might
offer to unpack.

480
00:24:49,993 --> 00:24:52,282
Remember, you don't know
this woman.

481
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,732
She may not be the movie star
you see in the magazines.

482
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,311
Well, there is only one way
to find out.

483
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:06,507
Thank you.

484
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:10,515
Lady Grantham.

485
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:13,680
- I am sorry to bother you.
- Not at all.

486
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,172
I made a new will

487
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:17,492
and I need you to witness
my signature.

488
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:20,499
I am exaggerating. It's just my
my jewelry and other pieces.

489
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,983
It's always a good idea to
to update these things.

490
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:26,217
Murray was already down,
I thought I would take advantage of that.

491
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:28,209
I'm glad you came,

492
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,577
because I wanted to tell you

493
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:32,201
that Violet asked us
to look through her things.

494
00:25:32,202 --> 00:25:33,807
What? Why did she ask you?

495
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:36,714
I have no idea, but of course
that anything of interest

496
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:38,641
will be forwarded
to Robert and you.

497
00:25:39,427 --> 00:25:41,268
I just thought
you should know.

498
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:44,113
Well, she wants to have her death
orderly and hassle-free.

499
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:45,608
It has a lot to do with her.

500
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:48,228
- Is it wrong to go to France?
- Certainly not.

501
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:52,517
Mary can send a telegram
if there is anything strange.

502
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,501
But there won't be.

503
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:58,772
I won't pretend that I've always loved her,
but it will be strange.

504
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:00,983
And Mary will be missed
when she is gone.

505
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:04,504
Mary will become her,
then the gap will be filled.

506
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,207
Now I have to go.

507
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,208
Dinner is late
for being here.

508
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:12,623
- See you when we get back.
- Of course.

509
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,918
She is right. It will be strange.

510
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,219
I will miss an opponent
to keep me in shape.

511
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:25,619
Be careful with the clothes.
They are couture.

512
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,367
I need to help Lady Mary
and Lady Hexham to get dressed,

513
00:26:28,368 --> 00:26:30,417
then I'll let Daisy
unpacking.

514
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:32,068
I will come back when I am
dinner.

515
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:35,091
As long as you finish
and the trunks are already in the room.

516
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:41,876
What were you doing
on the roof of Negresco?

517
00:26:41,877 --> 00:26:44,429
It was a treasure hunt
and it needed a chimney.

518
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,423
But when we got there
they were big,

519
00:26:46,424 --> 00:26:48,682
so we crushed and brought
all the pieces.

520
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:51,236
Was the manager satisfied?

521
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:52,852
Well, it was good publicity.

522
00:26:52,853 --> 00:26:55,267
Is there such a thing as good publicity?

523
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,132
It exists, if you are in the movies.

524
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:58,458
I suppose the Russians

525
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:01,125
break their glasses
as a sign of good luck.

526
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:04,112
And now famous people break
other people's property

527
00:27:04,113 --> 00:27:05,956
for good advertising.

528
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,682
Is it true
Miss Dalgleish?

529
00:27:07,683 --> 00:27:09,749
I don't do anything
unless I want to.

530
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,083
How great that sounds.

531
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:14,432
Move the plate closer.

532
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:18,932
How did you become a movie actress?

533
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,697
A talent scout
discovered me.

534
00:27:21,698 --> 00:27:23,478
Because I am very beautiful.

535
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:25,884
It sounds wonderfully
romantic.

536
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,292
Well, it's not so romantic.

537
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:30,470
Not when you know that every man in the room
in the room wants you.

538
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:34,985
What a joyful life you lead.

539
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:40,451
Have you made many films
traveling around the country?

540
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,510
I'm afraid I'm quite happy
to lose that.

541
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:45,410
I know you do it
just for the money, but that's okay.

542
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:50,461
What I never understand
is how you remember the lines.

543
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:51,928
Well, it's not theater.

544
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:54,087
In fact, I don't even know
if the performance is adequate.

545
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:55,715
But won't that change?

546
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,778
Haven't the movies started
to be talked about?

547
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,301
A few words here and there.
Nothing scary.

548
00:28:00,302 --> 00:28:01,345
Who says?

549
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:03,539
Bring me a <i>crème de menthe</i>!

550
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:08,305
Would it be possible to remember
Miss Dalgleish,

551
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:10,308
that the servants work
hard in this house

552
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:11,699
and are doing their best?

553
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,379
They are not used
to rudeness.

554
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,037
She is not used to criticism.

555
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:17,314
Your face on the screen sells
millions of tickets,

556
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:18,602
and she knows it.

557
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:20,948
I understood.

558
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:29,397
<i>I took my first picture
when I was 20.

559
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:32,726
Thank you.

560
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:37,406
I am the butler, sir.

561
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:39,779
Please,
let me know if you need anything.

562
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,966
Anything you need?
It seems like a very difficult task.

563
00:28:44,697 --> 00:28:47,034
I'm sorry.
I'm teasing you.

564
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,350
What I must say is
I have everything I need.

565
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:51,989
Thank you very much.

566
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:53,832
Very good, sir.

567
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:01,139
Put that book away,
Charlie, and go to sleep.

568
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,807
Let me finish this chapter.

569
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:11,082
You don't believe
what these people eat.

570
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:21,953
Pardon.

571
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,901
- Come on, Carson.
- Coming through.

572
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:29,180
Let's run
before things get worse.

573
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,171
I hope you have
a mediterranean version

574
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,943
of this outfit or it will bake.

575
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:35,972
Don't worry about me, my lord.

576
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:41,538
- You'll be fine, won't you?
- Bye, Daddy.

577
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:43,297
- Take care of Teo.
- Of course.

578
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,437
Have a great day,
no matter how it will be.

579
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:46,887
Yes, we will do our best.

580
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:50,028
Now, don't give me
with any scratches.

581
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:52,237
I found out,
in dealing with foreigners,

582
00:29:52,238 --> 00:29:56,338
if someone speaks loudly and slowly
will bend to your will.

583
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:58,831
Not too loud and not too slow.

584
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:01,041
No, no, Andrew.
Andrew. No, no.

585
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,354
Thank you, Bates.

586
00:30:05,268 --> 00:30:06,557
We came to wish you good luck.

587
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:08,641
Well, they just caught us,

588
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:10,761
as we set off
on our strange mission.

589
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,550
Good.

590
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,333
What a pity that you will miss
the footage.

591
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:20,068
Will you watch
while I am away?

592
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:21,369
I will try, if you let me.

593
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:23,959
Try to have fun.

594
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,726
I don't need to say
the same for you.

595
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:28,202
Please make Johnnie
keep his nose clean.

596
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,297
It will be done, sir.

597
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:39,533
All aboard
or we will miss the train.

598
00:30:46,465 --> 00:30:50,124
<i>Don't think I've seen
so many beautiful ladies.</i>

599
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:51,987
Tea for Miss Dalgleish.

600
00:30:51,988 --> 00:30:54,922
I just did.
Daisy can take it.

601
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:56,816
I will take it. I want to take it.

602
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:58,992
No, let me take it. Please.

603
00:30:59,142 --> 00:31:01,065
Lady Mary won't mind.
I beg you.

604
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,376
Calm down, Daisy.

605
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:03,893
But I will get the tray later.

606
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:21,361
This one is for you,
Miss Dalgleish.

607
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:24,399
I never told you how exciting
to see you here.

608
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:26,948
I love your movies.

609
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:29,330
You are an inspiration to me.

610
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:31,000
Since I watched
Star-Crossed...

611
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:32,607
- Can we move on?
- Now.

612
00:31:33,178 --> 00:31:34,821
Everyone in the positions.

613
00:31:37,725 --> 00:31:38,968
Is she the actress?

614
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:40,605
Roll the camera.

615
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:42,038
Harry.

616
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:45,489
E... Action!

617
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:50,079
You come down the stairs
and find him with your eyes.

618
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,633
You stop and move on.

619
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:54,539
But he is still waiting for you.

620
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:57,106
Tell her she looks beautiful.

621
00:31:57,993 --> 00:32:00,799
He is happy to hear that,
but you don't admit it.

622
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,418
Look into his eyes.
Will you let him kiss you?

623
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:08,705
It looks like you will.

624
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:10,479
Wait! Wait! Who is he?

625
00:32:10,677 --> 00:32:12,299
Cut, cut, cut.

626
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,448
I am sorry.

627
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:15,013
Wait, I can't act like this.

628
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:18,166
It's Molesley.
He is very much appreciated here.

629
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:19,866
Does it matter if he watches?

630
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:22,878
Of course they don't mind.
They just don't want him there.

631
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:24,113
No. Well noted.

632
00:32:24,114 --> 00:32:25,846
So now you will do it all over again?

633
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:27,151
Exactly.

634
00:32:27,152 --> 00:32:29,845
I'd rather make a living
on a mine.

635
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:32,245
First positions, please.

636
00:32:32,729 --> 00:32:33,862
Rotate the camera.

637
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,091
Harry.

638
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:37,972
And... action!

639
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:39,440
Go down the stairs,

640
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:41,439
surprised to find him there.

641
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:51,796
If I had known that we were going to stay
in the mansion, I don't know if I would come.

642
00:32:51,797 --> 00:32:52,810
Why not?

643
00:32:52,811 --> 00:32:55,105
Don't you think it might be
a little strange?

644
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,457
When we take ownership
the home of this family?

645
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,843
I don't know if this is the
sensible way to look at it.

646
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:04,217
I am glad that Sybbie will be
in a similar situation as her cousins.

647
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,018
Violet is giving her granddaughter away,

648
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:08,744
a great opportunity,
a real start in life.

649
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:11,744
Her generosity
surprised you?

650
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:13,653
Attila the Hun
loved his family.

651
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:22,397
Are you all right, Mr. Carson?

652
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,264
"Well" is not the first thing
that comes to my mind.

653
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:28,271
I brought you a piece of cake,
Mr. Carson.

654
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:52,491
I think she sounded very rude.

655
00:33:52,492 --> 00:33:54,165
I hope she is finished.

656
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,757
It is very difficult when
every film depends on you.

657
00:33:56,758 --> 00:33:59,058
It depends on Mr. Dexter too

658
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:00,773
and he seems
much better to handle.

659
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:02,418
And it is so attractive.

660
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:04,112
Hi, hi.
Are you up to something?

661
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:06,269
If I were,
would I tell you?

662
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:08,645
Mr. Molesley
is in the movie now.

663
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:10,997
I didn't know where to stay.

664
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:13,505
Let's leave the movie people
with their work

665
00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:14,646
And we with ours?

666
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:18,332
Listen to him, Daisy, before you run away
to join the circus.

667
00:35:15,941 --> 00:35:18,355
How are we all doing?
How do we survive?

668
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:20,168
Right?

669
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:22,566
Those cliffs
were pretty steep, weren't they?

670
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,622
Well, shall we?

671
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,526
<i>Monsieur</i> de Montmirail?

672
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:34,466
Lord Grantham. <i>Bienvenu</i>.

673
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:36,823
Well, we came in a caravan.

674
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:38,652
We even brought our butler.

675
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:41,182
- I don't know why.
- But how chic.

676
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:42,854
Now, come on in, everybody.

677
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:44,936
- Let's go.
- I need a drink.

678
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:46,660
And I would like a break.

679
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:47,847
I can imagine.

680
00:35:52,978 --> 00:35:55,034
- Welcome.
- <i>Merci.</i>

681
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:00,440
<i>Maman.</i>

682
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:03,539
May I present Lord Grantham.

683
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,509
My mother.
The Marquise de Montmirail.

684
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,543
Madam.

685
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:09,043
This is Lady Grantham,
Lord and Lady Hexham,

686
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,152
Lady Bagshaw
and Mr. and Mrs. Branson.

687
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:14,643
<i>Monsieur</i> Branson,
father of the lucky child.

688
00:36:14,644 --> 00:36:16,590
How happy you must be.

689
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,441
My wife and I
are happy.

690
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,481
I must say how kind you are
to include all of us.

691
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:23,317
We are delighted,
Lord Hexham.

692
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:25,310
Aren't we, <i>maman</i>?

693
00:36:25,311 --> 00:36:26,839
Delighted.

694
00:36:28,338 --> 00:36:29,683
Thank you, Mrs. Patmore.

695
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,073
- Thank you.
- Eat slowly.

696
00:36:35,174 --> 00:36:36,676
Mr. Mason.

697
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:39,098
How are you doing?
Are you going back to the farm?

698
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:41,080
I wanted to give the
to the young couple.

699
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:43,719
They are never left alone.
They always have to put up with me.

700
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,792
Well, it is your home.

701
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:48,150
But I want them to feel
that it is their home,

702
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:51,123
so that when I hand over
the rent, they take over.

703
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:52,358
What are you going to do?

704
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,705
Don't worry about me.
You already have your worries.

705
00:36:55,706 --> 00:36:57,819
- I care about you.
- Thank you.

706
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,049
The schedules for tomorrow
will be issued within one hour

707
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,736
and delivered to your accommodations

708
00:37:03,737 --> 00:37:04,944
A good day?

709
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:07,205
It's always good if we stick to
the schedule.

710
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:08,963
What is it?
Good news, I hope.

711
00:37:08,964 --> 00:37:11,820
No. My husband is not coming back
when he said he would come back.

712
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:13,678
It must be a disappointment.

713
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,971
It is a disappointment,
but not a surprise.

714
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:19,071
Seven-thirty is too late.
I like to eat at seven.

715
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,631
It is difficult for the kitchen,

716
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:22,815
if we change
the usual schedules.

717
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:29,371
I would like to see
the magic of the stars.

718
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,174
Well, one of her films
is being shown in Thirsk.

719
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:34,496
- Why don't we watch?
- I should say no.

720
00:37:34,497 --> 00:37:35,521
Why?

721
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:38,190
Your family is not here.
You are your own mistress.

722
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:40,199
That's fine.

723
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:41,965
I'll let Barrow know,

724
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:43,866
put on a coat
and tell Grandma.

725
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:51,475
Grandma, don't be angry,

726
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:53,893
But I'm going to Thirsk to see a movie.

727
00:37:53,894 --> 00:37:55,238
Alone?

728
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,446
With Mr. Barber, the director.

729
00:37:57,447 --> 00:38:00,864
Have you heard from
from Henry lately?

730
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,210
He sent a telegram today.

731
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:04,590
He is not coming back yet.

732
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:06,375
Denker, change of plans.

733
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:10,398
I'm not going to get ready.
I want my dinner on a tray.

734
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:11,499
Milady.

735
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,330
I am sorry.

736
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:22,393
It is not your fault
that Miss Dalgleish

737
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:24,992
has the charm of a wart.

738
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:26,619
Mr. Dexter is nice.

739
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,338
He can defend himself
without my help.

740
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:30,896
Not interested in movies?

741
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:32,637
I watched a few.

742
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:35,289
I prefer to eat rocks.

743
00:38:35,676 --> 00:38:38,660
In fact, I think I will
stay in my bed.

744
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:41,274
At least until everyone
leave.

745
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:42,497
Should I worry?

746
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:46,539
Florence Nightingale crawled into
in bed at the age of 38.

747
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,237
She passed away at the age of 90.

748
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:50,111
You would tell me, wouldn't you?

749
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:51,981
What do you think?

750
00:38:52,775 --> 00:38:53,799
Go.

751
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:02,784
<i>And you, Lord Grantham?</i>

752
00:39:02,785 --> 00:39:04,779
Do you know the South of France?

753
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,180
I know that Lord Brougham
made it fashionable

754
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,187
in the 1830s
when he was chancellor.

755
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:12,220
So you are just recovering
what is rightfully yours.

756
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:15,904
I wouldn't say that, but I understand
why you are upset.

757
00:39:15,905 --> 00:39:17,328
But here you are,

758
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:20,460
keeping an eye on the furniture,
measuring the curtains...

759
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:23,132
Mom, please. We can
buy another country house.

760
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,279
We are here

761
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:26,379
because your son invited us.

762
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:30,535
But I would like to know why
your husband did this.

763
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:32,969
I have asked our lawyer
to come here in a few days.

764
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,924
I think it's an excellent idea.

765
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:37,203
Until then, I hope you enjoy
the stay.

766
00:39:40,966 --> 00:39:44,025
Your butler brings an air of
of splendor to the proceedings.

767
00:39:44,026 --> 00:39:46,274
But he can withdraw,
if he prefers.

768
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:48,893
Why? The house already belongs
to your granddaughter.

769
00:39:49,546 --> 00:39:50,753
Lady Bagshaw,

770
00:39:51,145 --> 00:39:52,145
please,

771
00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:53,529
come and sit here.

772
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:56,462
I am sorry.

773
00:39:56,463 --> 00:40:00,321
I went to rest for five minutes,
I closed my eyes and blacked out.

774
00:40:00,322 --> 00:40:01,984
Welcome to the House of Doves.

775
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,596
- You must come here a lot.
- Yes, we do.

776
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:07,619
Or rather, we were coming,
before you guys showed up.

777
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,283
Always in winter,
as long as I can remember.

778
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:12,958
But now the fashion
is to come in the warmer months.

779
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:14,891
I will write an article
about it.

780
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:18,103
- Are you a writer, Lady Hexham?
- I'm more of a journalist.

781
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:21,102
I have a magazine
and I'm going to take back control of it.

782
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:22,496
What is your article about?

783
00:40:23,765 --> 00:40:26,709
Scott Fitzgerald,
Zelda, Coco Chanel.

784
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,707
Everyone who made the hotels
hotels stay open in July.

785
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:32,927
May I publish
some pictures of the mansion?

786
00:40:32,928 --> 00:40:34,308
Would that be possible?

787
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:35,808
Of course.

788
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,074
If we can see the images
before using them.

789
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:40,826
Clearly, she is not the first
journalist he has met.

790
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,375
Tickets, please.

791
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,376
SOLD OUT

792
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,585
We will have to postpone
our appreciation

793
00:40:50,586 --> 00:40:53,140
of Miss Dalgleish's exhibition
for another time.

794
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:54,370
This is not her film.

795
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:56,795
"The Terror" is the first film
fully spoken film

796
00:40:56,796 --> 00:40:57,967
to be shown here.

797
00:40:57,968 --> 00:40:59,691
I thought it was
"The Jazz Singer."

798
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:02,395
In this one, Al Jolson speaks a few
words to his mother.

799
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:03,441
And he sings.

800
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:05,820
In this one, they talk
during the whole movie.

801
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:07,118
Where is the Rialto Bridge?

802
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,575
Take the next left
and park.

803
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:18,994
Lady Mary went to the movies
in Thirsk with Mr. Barber,

804
00:41:18,995 --> 00:41:21,339
and Lady Grantham is
eating in her room.

805
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,457
So Mr. Dexter
and Miss Dalgleish

806
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:24,661
will dine alone.

807
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:26,418
Does Mrs. Patmore know about this?

808
00:41:26,419 --> 00:41:27,428
You know.

809
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:29,964
We feel sorry for Mr. Dexter.

810
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:33,048
What happened?

811
00:41:33,428 --> 00:41:35,953
Wouldn't it be interesting
to you, Mrs. Hugues.

812
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:37,367
You may speak.

813
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:39,353
If you like.

814
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,638
During the royal visit,

815
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,480
do you remember a jack
named Ellis?

816
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:54,788
I remember.

817
00:41:55,576 --> 00:41:58,964
You became great friends,
I remember.

818
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,081
I received a letter from him
this morning

819
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,475
saying that he is going to get married.

820
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:08,979
Is that sad?

821
00:42:10,105 --> 00:42:11,472
I know it shouldn't be.

822
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:15,718
Mr. Barrow, your path
in this life

823
00:42:16,052 --> 00:42:17,270
is very difficult.

824
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:19,860
Most people
in your position

825
00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:22,308
choose to hide
behind appearances

826
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:25,957
that allows them to avoid
persecution and rejection.

827
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:29,015
He certainly must not
be blamed for this.

828
00:42:30,858 --> 00:42:33,796
It's not what I want,
Mrs. Hugues.

829
00:42:34,655 --> 00:42:36,422
So you, sir, are a brave man.
are a brave man.

830
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:39,482
But it is also destined
to be lonely.

831
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:42,069
Unless you are very lucky.

832
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,218
MEET ME AT MIDNIGHT
DON'T TELL ANYONE

833
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:08,008
You said that her face
would sell a million tickets.

834
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:09,770
Not in Thirsk, apparently.

835
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:16,375
But it was right, of course.

836
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:18,039
She is very beautiful.

837
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:30,178
GOD SAVE THE KING.

838
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:33,211
How wonderful.

839
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,208
I am still curious to know
why we are here.

840
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:39,203
If you went to England,
you would meet my mother,

841
00:43:39,204 --> 00:43:40,721
which would make more sense.

842
00:43:40,722 --> 00:43:43,574
I wanted to know you
more than Lady Grantham.

843
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:44,792
And your mother?

844
00:43:45,252 --> 00:43:48,452
The situation is delicate for her,
but she will be fine,

845
00:43:48,453 --> 00:43:49,747
I will make sure of it.

846
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,140
Over there.

847
00:43:57,937 --> 00:43:59,563
What is their game?

848
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:02,457
Make us feel safe
and then sue us?

849
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:05,314
Maybe they want to make us feel
feel guilty and give up the game.

850
00:44:05,315 --> 00:44:08,127
I think that <i>Monsieur</i> de Montmirail
loved his father

851
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:10,094
and intends to accomplish
what he wants.

852
00:44:10,095 --> 00:44:12,086
And we are here
representing Grandma,

853
00:44:12,087 --> 00:44:13,687
the mysterious figure
of it all.

854
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,160
<i>Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

855
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:39,428
Shine.

856
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:40,970
No.

857
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:44,290
Coverage. Legal.

858
00:44:45,094 --> 00:44:46,199
Yes.

859
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,253
Carson?

860
00:44:49,134 --> 00:44:50,376
Can I help you?

861
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,587
I think that might be it.

862
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,008
You look like
King Zog of Albania.

863
00:45:01,653 --> 00:45:02,653
É.

864
00:45:04,581 --> 00:45:05,823
Perfect.

865
00:45:05,824 --> 00:45:07,078
No, no, no.

866
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,581
I won't allow that.

867
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:10,310
I chose it, so I pay.

868
00:45:10,311 --> 00:45:12,928
Yeah, but I'm the one who's going to use it.

869
00:45:13,595 --> 00:45:15,121
Thank you, sir.

870
00:45:15,122 --> 00:45:16,969
To both of them, you
and your wife.

871
00:45:24,412 --> 00:45:26,865
If you were selling clothes
when he arrived in Hollywood,

872
00:45:26,866 --> 00:45:28,710
how did you get into the world
of films?

873
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:31,244
One day, I was asked to pose
for a newspaper

874
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:32,998
with a suit
that they were advertising

875
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:34,995
and an agent came
and signed me up.

876
00:45:34,996 --> 00:45:36,462
Since it is so beautiful.

877
00:45:37,271 --> 00:45:39,540
I thought they liked
my talent as an actor.

878
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:41,134
Girls, go change your clothes.

879
00:45:41,135 --> 00:45:42,573
We want to go home.

880
00:45:44,524 --> 00:45:46,224
Now you know
why I am at the movies.

881
00:45:46,225 --> 00:45:47,550
How did you become a butler?

882
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:50,436
It's far less glamorous.
I got a job as a lackey,

883
00:45:50,437 --> 00:45:53,685
I was apprentice, first servant,
valet,

884
00:45:53,686 --> 00:45:55,162
and, finally, butler.

885
00:45:55,163 --> 00:45:57,823
I know all about running
a house, sir.

886
00:45:57,824 --> 00:45:59,905
This is the difference
between you and me.

887
00:45:59,906 --> 00:46:02,096
I don't know what I am doing
most of the time.

888
00:46:02,097 --> 00:46:03,550
It is not what it seems.

889
00:46:04,246 --> 00:46:05,296
Thank you.

890
00:46:05,902 --> 00:46:07,908
- Sir
- Just Barrow, sir.

891
00:46:09,606 --> 00:46:12,213
Okay, Guy.
Let's rehearse, please.

892
00:46:15,995 --> 00:46:18,010
Myrna, your line.

893
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:21,056
I saved a cue for you.

894
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:24,408
I always think they look like
instruments of war.

895
00:46:25,092 --> 00:46:26,305
That's because they are.

896
00:46:26,306 --> 00:46:30,303
There is a phone call for you.
Mr. Bullock. He says it's urgent.

897
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:31,814
Five minutes, people!

898
00:46:33,514 --> 00:46:35,421
<i>There is drama down there.</i>

899
00:46:35,422 --> 00:46:38,549
The man in charge was shouting
on the phone when I arrived.

900
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,129
It seems they are making the wrong
the wrong kind of film.

901
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,698
Is there a right kind?

902
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:47,363
All I know is that it seems that the public
only wants movies that talk.

903
00:46:47,364 --> 00:46:51,102
I thought the best thing about movies
is that you can't hear them.

904
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,407
It would be even better
if I couldn't see them too.

905
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:58,603
Everyone, gather around, please!
Everybody!

906
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:03,746
We are suspending production.

907
00:47:03,747 --> 00:47:05,112
I know, I know.

908
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,409
I regret to be the bearer
of bad news.

909
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:10,198
We will contact you
when we run out of plans.

910
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:11,199
Thank you.

911
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,243
What is it? What happened?

912
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,697
It seems that talking movies
are making a lot of money,

913
00:47:17,698 --> 00:47:20,914
while our film is silent
and expensive to recover the costs,

914
00:47:20,915 --> 00:47:23,669
so they want to cut their losses
and shut us down.

915
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,813
How sad.

916
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:27,603
It is worse for the men and women
who work at it.

917
00:47:27,604 --> 00:47:31,679
We still owe the extras,
and now they are out of a job.

918
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,102
- I told you.
- Excuse me.

919
00:47:34,402 --> 00:47:35,402
Myrna.

920
00:47:36,306 --> 00:47:37,901
Why is he stopping?

921
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:40,702
Apparently, silent films
no longer make money.

922
00:47:40,703 --> 00:47:43,609
I saw it one night.
The theater was almost empty.

923
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,705
What a shame.

924
00:47:44,706 --> 00:47:47,913
I feel sorry for Mr. Barber.
He doesn't deserve that.

925
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,901
I wish I could help.

926
00:47:53,902 --> 00:47:56,113
I wish I could too,
but I don't know how.

927
00:47:56,114 --> 00:47:59,106
We are doing a mute.
They only want to launch spoken, so

928
00:47:59,107 --> 00:48:02,006
Why not turn it
into a talking movie?

929
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:03,409
What would this mean?

930
00:48:03,807 --> 00:48:06,006
Getting a coach from London.

931
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,706
He could record the sound
for scenes we already did and

932
00:48:09,707 --> 00:48:13,202
And put new lines in the rest.
Why wouldn't it work?

933
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:19,206
Mr. Mason
is driving me crazy.

934
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:21,689
All cups and saucers
need to be right.

935
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,223
You are his daughter-in-law.
His son died in the war.

936
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:27,413
No wonder he and I
don't get along.

937
00:48:27,414 --> 00:48:29,448
It is a pity
that he is annoying you

938
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:31,209
because he is a lovely man.

939
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,426
And he likes you very much,
Daisy.

940
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,600
Didn't you have a crush on him
once?

941
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:37,508
About a hundred years ago.

942
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:41,693
I heard that a sound specialist
is coming from London.

943
00:48:41,694 --> 00:48:43,163
Don't remind me.

944
00:48:45,107 --> 00:48:46,506
Are you okay?

945
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:48,211
Can I help you?

946
00:48:48,212 --> 00:48:50,096
No one can help me now.

947
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,301
Come on.

948
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,105
If it isn't just Barrow.

949
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,106
Sir?

950
00:49:02,802 --> 00:49:05,506
I thought this big house
is much more interesting

951
00:49:05,507 --> 00:49:07,150
than our silly movie.

952
00:49:07,697 --> 00:49:09,114
Don't call me "sir".

953
00:49:10,802 --> 00:49:12,505
Is there anything I can do?

954
00:49:12,506 --> 00:49:15,124
Unless you have ideas
for my next career.

955
00:49:16,197 --> 00:49:17,580
I don't understand.

956
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:21,304
The movies were mimes
until now.

957
00:49:21,305 --> 00:49:23,104
Mimes with music.

958
00:49:23,105 --> 00:49:25,891
Now with the talking movies,
they will be about acting.

959
00:49:25,892 --> 00:49:27,309
They won't want us.

960
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:30,605
They will hire real actors
from the theater and

961
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,759
we will be finished.

962
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,792
But you have a good voice.

963
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:36,766
There may be some new faces coming in,

964
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,850
but the public will not want to
to say goodbye to old favorites.

965
00:49:40,523 --> 00:49:41,730
I hope you are right.

966
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,980
Sir.

967
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,314
That is the yacht
of the Duke of Westminster.

968
00:50:30,504 --> 00:50:31,914
Let me summarize.

969
00:50:32,443 --> 00:50:34,584
In the years after 1864,

970
00:50:34,585 --> 00:50:37,502
the late Marquis de Montmirail
made four wills.

971
00:50:37,503 --> 00:50:41,204
In each one, he refers to the fact
of having given the <i>Villa des Colombes</i>

972
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,879
to the then Dowager Countess
of Grantham in 1865.

973
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,901
I brought the originals.
I'll leave copies.

974
00:50:47,902 --> 00:50:50,407
So clearly
it was not something that was forgotten.

975
00:50:50,408 --> 00:50:52,759
He intended this
and kept his decision.

976
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,093
I feel better for it.

977
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:55,994
She must have had
some power over him.

978
00:50:55,995 --> 00:50:57,611
She must have blackmailed him.

979
00:50:57,612 --> 00:50:59,509
<i>Maman</i>, that is a silly answer.

980
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,503
We will challenge it in court.

981
00:51:01,504 --> 00:51:03,693
Based on what, madam?

982
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:06,897
You have other homes.
It's not about hardship.

983
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:11,102
Her husband bought the mansion
and disposed of it before he met her.

984
00:51:11,103 --> 00:51:14,852
My advice would be to hand over
the property without delay.

985
00:51:20,147 --> 00:51:22,700
- Thank you very much.
- Do you intend to accept that?

986
00:51:23,103 --> 00:51:26,499
Of course, my father made me
sole executor, Lord Grantham.

987
00:51:26,807 --> 00:51:30,268
I think he trusted me
to fulfill his desires.

988
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:32,503
Then why did you invite us here?

989
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:34,591
I was curious to meet him.

990
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,807
My father and his mother
spent a week together

991
00:51:36,808 --> 00:51:38,806
in October 1864.

992
00:51:44,312 --> 00:51:47,304
And I was born in July 1865.

993
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:48,603
Precisely.

994
00:51:48,604 --> 00:51:51,760
I think that is the reason why
he gave her the mansion after a month.

995
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:54,013
In gratitude for his birth.

996
00:51:55,275 --> 00:51:56,386
In other words,

997
00:51:56,942 --> 00:51:59,822
I believe that you and I
have a lot in common.

998
00:52:14,303 --> 00:52:16,207
We should thank
Lady Grantham.

999
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:17,208
Of course.

1000
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:20,340
Now we know
that for her to have the Villa

1001
00:52:20,341 --> 00:52:22,902
was not a random choice
or a foolish mistake,

1002
00:52:22,903 --> 00:52:25,815
but a decision firmly
supported for many years.

1003
00:52:25,816 --> 00:52:27,411
It's funny, in a way,

1004
00:52:27,412 --> 00:52:29,871
knowing that my daughter
is from the golden circle where,

1005
00:52:29,872 --> 00:52:32,206
because of his blood,
beautiful things happen.

1006
00:52:32,207 --> 00:52:35,205
Just as Mary will have Downton
and we will have Brompton.

1007
00:52:35,206 --> 00:52:37,103
But they are working
of work.

1008
00:52:37,104 --> 00:52:39,199
Here was made
to laugh and have fun.

1009
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:42,202
Wouldn't Sybil be happy
for her daughter?

1010
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,605
And encouraged her to use
for the good of others?

1011
00:52:46,606 --> 00:52:48,314
Yes, I think she would.

1012
00:52:49,094 --> 00:52:50,500
So let's do the same.

1013
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:53,871
I look forward to bringing Sybbie here.
She'll love it.

1014
00:52:55,106 --> 00:52:56,799
Look at this view.

1015
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,914
Don't you feel grateful
that we are alive?

1016
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:03,049
I love you, you know.

1017
00:53:04,169 --> 00:53:06,397
I thought I would never love
again.

1018
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:08,607
And I love you.

1019
00:53:09,192 --> 00:53:10,413
So it's all good.

1020
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:16,709
Shall we go back? The water is

1021
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,859
They seem
very happy together.

1022
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,695
This is how it should be.

1023
00:53:20,696 --> 00:53:23,870
It's exciting for Sybbie,
for all of them.

1024
00:53:24,183 --> 00:53:28,366
I like that Tom and Lucy have
a meeting here every summer,

1025
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:30,499
until it became
a family tradition.

1026
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:34,815
The sun made me sleepy.

1027
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:38,305
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to take
a nap before dinner.

1028
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,314
You look tired too.

1029
00:53:41,474 --> 00:53:42,913
Why don't you do the same?

1030
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:44,608
I won't be long.

1031
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:50,975
She is right.
You look tired.

1032
00:53:50,976 --> 00:53:53,511
I don't understand how it is useful
for people to say that.

1033
00:53:53,512 --> 00:53:54,799
I am sorry.

1034
00:53:57,345 --> 00:53:59,200
Never stop writing.

1035
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:01,126
Mom,

1036
00:54:01,127 --> 00:54:03,884
if there is something bothering you,
please say so.

1037
00:54:03,885 --> 00:54:05,852
No, not at all, really.

1038
00:54:08,943 --> 00:54:12,109
I had to change the arrangement
of the dining table again,

1039
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,973
but I think they got the hang of it
the way of passing

1040
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:16,111
His Lordship's shirts,
finally.

1041
00:54:16,112 --> 00:54:17,716
You should have let me do that.

1042
00:54:17,717 --> 00:54:20,237
You must be very grateful
for your help, Mr. Carson.

1043
00:54:20,238 --> 00:54:22,775
Well, maybe. When I showed
them how to do this,

1044
00:54:22,776 --> 00:54:25,809
they spoke French
very loud and very fast.

1045
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,644
Is everything settled?

1046
00:54:29,012 --> 00:54:31,785
It seems that the mansion now
belongs to Miss Sybbie.

1047
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,406
Lucky girl.

1048
00:54:33,407 --> 00:54:34,813
Do you envy her, Ms. Baxter?

1049
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:37,264
I'm not a big believer
in envy, Mr. Bates.

1050
00:54:37,265 --> 00:54:38,444
I know what I want,

1051
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:41,725
and I can live without a mansion
in the south of France.

1052
00:54:41,726 --> 00:54:43,934
What do you want,
Miss Baxter?

1053
00:54:43,935 --> 00:54:45,506
Please, Mr. Carson.

1054
00:54:45,507 --> 00:54:47,112
We all know what she wants.

1055
00:54:47,113 --> 00:54:49,391
Your affections are
firmly committed.

1056
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:50,994
They are not committed.

1057
00:54:51,562 --> 00:54:53,607
Uncommitted
in that way, perhaps,

1058
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:55,464
but completely taken.

1059
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:58,222
Are we talking about
Mr. Molesley?

1060
00:54:58,701 --> 00:54:59,709
We are.

1061
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:02,305
But suppose
that he never takes action?

1062
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:04,895
Then I'll be an old maid.

1063
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:07,500
You would never marry
to anyone else?

1064
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:10,991
It took me a long time
to find him.

1065
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:13,208
Madam.

1066
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:21,424
I don't know how long
he thought about it,

1067
00:55:21,604 --> 00:55:23,855
But he checked the dates,
he made sure.

1068
00:55:23,856 --> 00:55:26,290
I was born exactly nine
months later,

1069
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:29,344
I mean, the "idyllic interlude"
they spent together.

1070
00:55:29,345 --> 00:55:31,672
And he gave the mansion
right after I was born.

1071
00:55:31,673 --> 00:55:33,677
I am sure that
that it is all a coincidence.

1072
00:55:33,678 --> 00:55:35,780
Does it really?
That would explain the mystery.

1073
00:55:35,781 --> 00:55:38,086
Your father loved you very much.

1074
00:55:38,087 --> 00:55:40,011
But it is Rosamund
who looks like him.

1075
00:55:43,183 --> 00:55:45,069
I hope I have helped you, milady.

1076
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:46,312
Thank you, Baxter.

1077
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:47,860
- Good evening.
- Good night.

1078
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:49,281
What's that for? What's up?

1079
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:50,948
Just a little heartburn. I'm fine.

1080
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,897
What will happen
if the story is released?

1081
00:55:56,594 --> 00:55:58,630
I suppose Carson
will deliver his notice.

1082
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:01,598
Don't be ridiculous. You are the least
least French person I have ever met.

1083
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,875
You don't even like garlic.

1084
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:04,947
This is not exactly
proof of anything.

1085
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:10,862
How did they do it
so fast?

1086
00:56:10,863 --> 00:56:12,112
Because time is money.

1087
00:56:12,113 --> 00:56:14,163
The problem is,
what will the actors say?

1088
00:56:14,164 --> 00:56:15,176
What do you mean?

1089
00:56:15,177 --> 00:56:18,356
I write the lines for them,
but they don't always adhere to the text,

1090
00:56:18,357 --> 00:56:20,672
and sometimes we don't remember
what the actors say.

1091
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,265
Why not let
Mr. Molesley help?

1092
00:56:23,266 --> 00:56:24,623
Why?
What can you do?

1093
00:56:24,624 --> 00:56:26,535
He is the principal of the school
of the mansion,

1094
00:56:26,536 --> 00:56:28,205
And I know that he can read lips.

1095
00:56:28,336 --> 00:56:30,081
He could help
in something.

1096
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:31,444
This is really true.

1097
00:56:31,445 --> 00:56:34,651
And he was here every day
and watched every scene.

1098
00:56:34,652 --> 00:56:36,914
Okay, Mr. Barber. I'm ready.

1099
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:39,245
Bring in the actors.

1100
00:56:45,954 --> 00:56:48,364
That sounds
very professional, milady,

1101
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:49,883
if you don't mind my saying so.

1102
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:51,510
It is the new Speed Reflex.

1103
00:56:51,511 --> 00:56:53,269
You can see the image
before you take it down.

1104
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:55,511
What will they think of next?

1105
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,108
How are you doing down there?

1106
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:58,940
All right, I guess, sir.

1107
00:56:58,941 --> 00:57:02,360
Although they are very French,
the French, aren't they?

1108
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:05,192
- I suppose they are obligated.
- I suppose they are.

1109
00:57:05,193 --> 00:57:06,393
Poor things.

1110
00:57:06,394 --> 00:57:10,038
That's very good, but, Carson,
could you take the phone out?

1111
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:11,220
That spoils it a bit.

1112
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,806
It is beautiful to see you
enjoying your work.

1113
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,810
It's good to have a point...

1114
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:19,681
Support in the real world again?

1115
00:57:19,682 --> 00:57:21,603
Something like that, yes.

1116
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:25,552
My goodness.

1117
00:57:25,553 --> 00:57:26,716
What is it?

1118
00:57:27,098 --> 00:57:28,098
Take a look.

1119
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:36,892
Who is she?

1120
00:57:36,893 --> 00:57:40,572
This is Lady Grantham,
who I started working for

1121
00:57:40,573 --> 00:57:43,427
like a young page
wet behind the ears.

1122
00:57:43,428 --> 00:57:44,625
Grandma?

1123
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:45,629
Heavens.

1124
00:57:46,984 --> 00:57:49,824
Thank you, Carson.
Could you give us a moment?

1125
00:57:51,906 --> 00:57:53,099
What does it say?

1126
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,816
"<i>Violette, mon adorée.</i>"

1127
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,199
My God.

1128
00:58:03,299 --> 00:58:05,866
Mary had a little lamb.

1129
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:08,730
<i>His wool was white as snow.</i>

1130
00:58:08,731 --> 00:58:10,355
Okay, Mr. Stubbins,
are you ready?

1131
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:13,492
As ready as I can be,
Mr. Barber, for I did not control

1132
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:15,319
the sound insulation or the set.

1133
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,651
Call Mr. Dexter, please.

1134
00:58:17,652 --> 00:58:18,653
Guy?

1135
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:21,107
Where are the lines?

1136
00:58:21,108 --> 00:58:22,289
I am sorry.

1137
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,369
No, no.

1138
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:25,734
- Thank you.
- And here.

1139
00:58:26,872 --> 00:58:29,284
Time the speech
to match the movie.

1140
00:58:29,285 --> 00:58:31,396
No, don't lean.

1141
00:58:31,397 --> 00:58:34,994
And try not to move your head.
Very good.

1142
00:58:34,995 --> 00:58:36,875
Ring the bell
to ask for silence!

1143
00:58:40,206 --> 00:58:41,206
E...

1144
00:58:41,794 --> 00:58:43,328
Sound rolling.

1145
00:58:54,675 --> 00:58:56,607
"Well, if it isn't Lady Anne.

1146
00:58:56,608 --> 00:58:58,777
I thought I could find myself.

1147
00:58:58,778 --> 00:59:01,136
Nobody can keep a secret
a secret these days.

1148
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,410
Just a reminder

1149
00:59:04,411 --> 00:59:06,515
which is my future
for me to throw away.

1150
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:10,870
No, wait.

1151
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:11,872
Don't go."

1152
00:59:13,032 --> 00:59:14,032
Cut.

1153
00:59:19,464 --> 00:59:20,489
Very good.

1154
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:22,785
Miss Dalgleish.

1155
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:24,295
Ready.

1156
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:37,234
And action.

1157
00:59:40,646 --> 00:59:42,531
"I knew where you would be.

1158
00:59:42,532 --> 00:59:44,332
I just came to..."

1159
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,314
Hold on.
I turned my head there.

1160
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:47,525
You... yes.

1161
00:59:47,526 --> 00:59:50,499
I wrote a
to cover this. See?

1162
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,341
"I only came to stop you
from throwing away your future."

1163
00:59:53,342 --> 00:59:55,868
You... go back to the "future".

1164
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:56,870
Right.

1165
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:01,492
And action.

1166
01:00:05,386 --> 01:00:08,657
"I knew where you would be.
I just came to stop

1167
01:00:08,658 --> 01:00:10,815
- who throws away his future.
- Louder!

1168
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:15,483
"I can't stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1169
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,827
- I must..."
- Cut.

1170
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:20,921
Thank you, Myrna.
Could you give me a minute?

1171
01:00:23,755 --> 01:00:24,755
Are you okay?

1172
01:00:25,198 --> 01:00:27,301
What now? Mr. Stubbins?

1173
01:00:27,302 --> 01:00:30,415
I am here to record sound,
not to perform miracles.

1174
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:32,657
Lady Anne Erskine
that she is not.

1175
01:00:32,658 --> 01:00:35,688
Couldn't she learn the accent
the accent and try again?

1176
01:00:35,689 --> 01:00:38,493
People try their whole
their whole lives and fail.

1177
01:00:38,494 --> 01:00:40,788
George B. Shaw
wrote a play about it.

1178
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:43,204
You could do it, milady.

1179
01:00:43,205 --> 01:00:45,193
You saw how Mr. Dexter did it.

1180
01:00:45,194 --> 01:00:46,532
It can't be that hard.

1181
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:47,702
But I couldn't.

1182
01:00:48,116 --> 01:00:49,983
What? Couldn't
do the accent?

1183
01:00:49,984 --> 01:00:52,087
I think it could.
I think it does.

1184
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:54,963
- But I am not an actress.
- Well, Myrna is an actress?

1185
01:00:54,964 --> 01:00:56,791
Looking forward to seeing
her Hedda Gabler?

1186
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:57,893
Even so.

1187
01:00:57,894 --> 01:00:59,399
Look, just try.

1188
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,828
If you don't succeed,
we will close forever.

1189
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:04,790
If you can,
will allow us to continue.

1190
01:01:05,894 --> 01:01:06,894
Please.

1191
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,460
How do we deal
with Miss Dalgleish?

1192
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,108
Now, take her
back up.

1193
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:14,517
- We need to see if it will work.
- I'll do it.

1194
01:01:16,596 --> 01:01:18,001
<i>Miss Dalgleish?</i>

1195
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:25,716
- Here are the lines, milady.
- Thank you.

1196
01:01:25,717 --> 01:01:28,118
I don't know how I get into
into these things.

1197
01:01:36,467 --> 01:01:38,220
"I knew where you would be.

1198
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:42,972
I only came to stop you
from throwing away your future.

1199
01:01:42,973 --> 01:01:45,716
I can't stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1200
01:01:46,982 --> 01:01:48,196
I have to go."

1201
01:01:49,603 --> 01:01:51,423
And cut.
Touch them together.

1202
01:02:01,399 --> 01:02:03,370
<i>Well, if it isn't Lady Anne.</i>

1203
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:05,098
<i>I thought you might find me.</i>

1204
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,169
<i>You can't keep
a secret these days.</i>

1205
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,720
<i>I knew where you would be.</i>

1206
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:12,013
<I've only come to stop you
from throwing away your future.

1207
01:02:12,014 --> 01:02:13,015
<i>Just a reminder</i>

1208
01:02:13,016 --> 01:02:15,134
<i>which is my future
for me to throw away.</i>

1209
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,106
<i>I can't stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1210
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:20,780
<i>No, wait.</i>

1211
01:02:21,444 --> 01:02:22,497
<i>Don't go.</i>

1212
01:02:23,691 --> 01:02:25,001
<i>I have to go.</i>

1213
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,915
I hope it was
it was a prop.

1214
01:02:45,908 --> 01:02:47,357
When was it painted?

1215
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:49,425
And why was she your beloved?

1216
01:02:49,426 --> 01:02:51,394
Why did she grant
the final favor?

1217
01:02:51,395 --> 01:02:54,776
They were together only
a few days. Does it seem likely?

1218
01:02:54,777 --> 01:02:56,216
And it's just a coincidence

1219
01:02:56,217 --> 01:02:58,276
that Daddy was born
nine months later?

1220
01:02:58,277 --> 01:03:00,358
I imagine that,
when she got home,

1221
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,702
your grandfather was very
happy to see her.

1222
01:03:02,703 --> 01:03:03,814
Anyway,

1223
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:06,868
Monsieur de Montmirail was
madly in love with her.

1224
01:03:06,869 --> 01:03:09,351
- When did he get married?
- I know that, I looked.

1225
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:12,853
She married in 1870, five years
after Robert's birth.

1226
01:03:12,854 --> 01:03:15,595
And the current Marquis
was born in 1873.

1227
01:03:15,596 --> 01:03:17,637
So the mansion was a parting gift
of farewell

1228
01:03:17,638 --> 01:03:20,008
to his grandmother before
that he looked for a wife.

1229
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:22,794
- That's what it looks like.
- Evidently.

1230
01:03:25,974 --> 01:03:27,596
I will probe it.

1231
01:03:27,597 --> 01:03:29,978
- About Mrs. Patmore.
- You can't.

1232
01:03:29,979 --> 01:03:31,106
I can.

1233
01:03:31,669 --> 01:03:33,636
You know that she
has a house of her own.

1234
01:03:33,637 --> 01:03:35,052
You know she is lonely.

1235
01:03:35,053 --> 01:03:36,716
It is a solution for all of us.

1236
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,854
They sound very conspiratorial.

1237
01:03:39,855 --> 01:03:42,955
We talked about Mrs. Patmore
and how much she likes you.

1238
01:03:42,956 --> 01:03:44,278
Does she really like it?

1239
01:03:44,888 --> 01:03:46,530
Well, I like her.

1240
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,315
- She is a good woman.
- She is.

1241
01:03:48,316 --> 01:03:50,647
But sometimes I worry
that I'm lonely.

1242
01:03:50,648 --> 01:03:52,271
He has his own house, of course,

1243
01:03:52,272 --> 01:03:54,325
but I think I would like
to have company there.

1244
01:03:55,389 --> 01:03:56,885
I know what you are thinking,

1245
01:03:57,391 --> 01:03:58,761
but the answer is no.

1246
01:03:58,762 --> 01:04:00,562
You always said
that you admired her.

1247
01:04:00,563 --> 01:04:01,963
And I admire it.

1248
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:04,315
But I wouldn't live off her.
It wouldn't be right.

1249
01:04:04,316 --> 01:04:07,139
- Even if she wanted to?
- Even then.

1250
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:10,035
There are things that are right
and there are things that are wrong,

1251
01:04:10,036 --> 01:04:11,361
and I can't change that.

1252
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:18,406
Thank you for accepting.
I owe you a lot.

1253
01:04:18,407 --> 01:04:20,207
- Is everything in order?
- Well...

1254
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:23,008
Once we record the sound
of the scenes we've already shot,

1255
01:04:23,009 --> 01:04:25,547
we will need new material
for what is missing...

1256
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:30,323
May I speak, Mr. Barber?

1257
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:31,524
Of course.

1258
01:04:31,525 --> 01:04:33,325
I went through all
the dialogue letters

1259
01:04:33,326 --> 01:04:35,783
that would be shown
if the image were silent,

1260
01:04:35,784 --> 01:04:38,052
and started sketching scenes

1261
01:04:38,053 --> 01:04:40,003
that would cover the needs
needs of the plot.

1262
01:04:40,004 --> 01:04:42,633
- Have you written a play?
- Well, I started one.

1263
01:04:42,634 --> 01:04:44,614
- Could I read these scenes?
- Of course.

1264
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:47,190
And if you are satisfied,
I'll do the rest.

1265
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:52,510
Am I limited
by the plot synopsis?

1266
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:56,270
For example,
when she finally rejects him,

1267
01:04:56,652 --> 01:04:59,554
wouldn't it be better
with a big romantic climax?

1268
01:04:59,555 --> 01:05:00,955
I don't understand.

1269
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:05,108
Bill Benson is about to
to throw his life away.

1270
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:09,726
Alone, empty and without hope.

1271
01:05:10,726 --> 01:05:13,534
Suddenly he raises his face
and sees Anne standing there,

1272
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,517
tall, serene, graceful,

1273
01:05:16,017 --> 01:05:20,081
her eyes shining
with unshed tears.

1274
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,037
On an impulse,
he takes his money back.

1275
01:05:23,038 --> 01:05:24,365
<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>

1276
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:26,709
The wheel spins.

1277
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:38,854
And everything he has
would be gone.

1278
01:05:39,961 --> 01:05:41,159
But, no.

1279
01:05:41,659 --> 01:05:45,817
Her love, her beauty
saved him.

1280
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:50,117
She takes his hand,
and they leave.

1281
01:05:51,395 --> 01:05:52,395
Together.

1282
01:05:53,018 --> 01:05:54,099
End.

1283
01:05:55,472 --> 01:05:57,272
I think I'm going to cry.

1284
01:05:57,273 --> 01:05:59,173
Mr. Molesley, please,

1285
01:05:59,174 --> 01:06:02,412
finish the script
as you see fit

1286
01:06:02,413 --> 01:06:03,900
- and bring it to me.
- Right.

1287
01:06:07,956 --> 01:06:10,035
- You said he worked here?
- Yes.

1288
01:06:10,036 --> 01:06:11,623
He was a servant.

1289
01:06:12,033 --> 01:06:14,781
But we didn't know
of his hidden talents.

1290
01:06:18,214 --> 01:06:19,215
Poor Carson.

1291
01:06:19,216 --> 01:06:21,265
You must be cooking
in these clothes.

1292
01:06:21,266 --> 01:06:23,717
Isn't there a lighter model
model that he can use?

1293
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:25,879
- I believe so.
- Thank you, <i>monsieur</i>,

1294
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,731
but we English,
don't get hot

1295
01:06:27,732 --> 01:06:29,132
by wearing the correct attire.

1296
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,577
I invited some friends over tomorrow
to say goodbye

1297
01:06:32,578 --> 01:06:33,800
and introduce you.

1298
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:35,744
But the presence of your butler
reminds me

1299
01:06:35,745 --> 01:06:38,150
that we are your guests
and I should have asked.

1300
01:06:38,151 --> 01:06:39,151
Please.

1301
01:06:39,451 --> 01:06:43,321
Here's to your fortunate granddaughter,
Sybil Branson.

1302
01:06:43,322 --> 01:06:45,266
- To Sybbie.
- Sybbie.

1303
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,668
I wish she were here
to meet her.

1304
01:06:47,669 --> 01:06:49,906
I hope you will meet her one day.
She is lovely.

1305
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:52,425
It's good to hear a stepmother
talk like this.

1306
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:54,639
You must be happy
the way things are.

1307
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,448
When the ones you love are lucky,

1308
01:06:56,449 --> 01:06:58,101
is almost better than being lucky.

1309
01:06:58,102 --> 01:06:59,621
Almost, but not quite.

1310
01:06:59,622 --> 01:07:00,662
Yes.

1311
01:07:05,228 --> 01:07:07,264
Do you know the miniatures
in the library?

1312
01:07:08,709 --> 01:07:12,404
One of them is Grandma's,
and it is engraved on the side.

1313
01:07:15,715 --> 01:07:16,715
I've seen it.

1314
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:21,861
I was forced to see her there
for more than half a century.

1315
01:07:22,898 --> 01:07:24,625
But he forbade me to take it off.

1316
01:07:25,438 --> 01:07:26,663
He made me swear.

1317
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,808
Any more news
from Mr. Talbot?

1318
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:35,843
Not since the phone call
I told you about.

1319
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:37,811
You must miss him,
milady.

1320
01:07:37,812 --> 01:07:39,469
I just hope he feels my

1321
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:44,852
His Lordship
will soon be home.

1322
01:07:45,033 --> 01:07:47,001
I'm afraid he will have a shock.

1323
01:07:47,673 --> 01:07:49,121
Did you enjoy the filming?

1324
01:07:49,975 --> 01:07:51,089
In a way.

1325
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,240
I liked Mr. Barber
and Mr. Dexter

1326
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:55,362
and see how a film is made,
but...

1327
01:07:56,549 --> 01:07:58,914
I was a little
disappointed as well.

1328
01:07:58,915 --> 01:08:00,394
For Miss Dalgleish?

1329
01:08:00,395 --> 01:08:04,089
It sounds silly, but I thought
that we would become friends.

1330
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:07,796
They say it is a mistake to meet
their favorite stars.

1331
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:09,921
In this case, they are right.

1332
01:08:22,876 --> 01:08:24,084
Are you happy?

1333
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:26,239
I am,
but there is work to be done.

1334
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,993
The harder you work,
the happier you will be.

1335
01:08:28,994 --> 01:08:30,726
Well, you already know me.

1336
01:08:30,727 --> 01:08:33,902
And, yes, I want to enjoy
Sybbie's luck.

1337
01:08:34,303 --> 01:08:36,892
- I want us all to enjoy it.
- Congratulations, Tom.

1338
01:08:36,893 --> 01:08:39,837
You are a leopard who has changed
your spots successfully.

1339
01:08:51,403 --> 01:08:52,852
He is very fast.

1340
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,563
No.

1341
01:08:56,546 --> 01:08:59,866
Where is the ball? It is gone.

1342
01:09:00,618 --> 01:09:02,482
Good move.

1343
01:09:02,483 --> 01:09:03,861
<i>That's it, how about it?</i>

1344
01:09:03,862 --> 01:09:07,652
George should be in bed,
or at least on his way.

1345
01:09:07,653 --> 01:09:08,946
Do you have other children?

1346
01:09:09,421 --> 01:09:12,947
A daughter, Caroline,
with my second husband.

1347
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,200
George's father died in a car accident
car accident seven years ago,

1348
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,146
the day George was born.

1349
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,600
He held the baby in his lap
and died on the way home.

1350
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:23,210
My God.

1351
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:25,976
What was he like?

1352
01:09:26,836 --> 01:09:28,513
It was perfect, really.

1353
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,059
Beautiful like a prince
from a fairy tale.

1354
01:09:32,685 --> 01:09:37,173
Moralistic, strong, with dreams,
determined to do his part.

1355
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:40,624
- Do you miss him?
- Of course.

1356
01:09:40,845 --> 01:09:43,626
Although I wonder
what life would have made of him

1357
01:09:43,627 --> 01:09:44,732
if he had lived.

1358
01:09:44,912 --> 01:09:45,999
In a way...

1359
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:49,007
One way?

1360
01:09:49,495 --> 01:09:51,928
I was going to say, in a way,
that you remind me of him.

1361
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:54,043
Although I cannot say
why.

1362
01:09:54,044 --> 01:09:55,057
I am flattered.

1363
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,053
What about your current husband?

1364
01:09:57,297 --> 01:09:59,096
Henry is more pragmatic.

1365
01:09:59,443 --> 01:10:01,616
There are no dreams about him.
He is an executioner.

1366
01:10:02,336 --> 01:10:05,836
It tests your endurance
from morning until night.

1367
01:10:06,082 --> 01:10:07,682
But he is a good co-worker.

1368
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:09,307
Is he handsome too?

1369
01:10:09,308 --> 01:10:10,414
Yes.

1370
01:10:11,552 --> 01:10:12,918
I like the pretty ones.

1371
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:17,592
But is there trouble in paradise?

1372
01:10:17,753 --> 01:10:19,319
You don't need me to tell you,

1373
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,433
marriage is a soap opera,
not a short story.

1374
01:10:23,194 --> 01:10:25,207
Full of twists and turns.

1375
01:10:26,194 --> 01:10:29,016
Suppose it all boils down to
whether you love him or not.

1376
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:32,535
Really, Mr. Barber?
It's because working on the movies.

1377
01:10:33,608 --> 01:10:36,128
I think I have counted enough
for one night.

1378
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:40,496
I hope you warmly welcome
our successors to the mansion.

1379
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:43,928
And with the Bransons, perhaps
you will see Lord Grantham,

1380
01:10:43,929 --> 01:10:47,555
who I think I can call
my good friend.

1381
01:11:06,089 --> 01:11:08,509
He handled everything
with such good manners

1382
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,160
Because he thinks he is my brother.

1383
01:11:10,161 --> 01:11:12,405
For a moment,
I thought you were going to speak.

1384
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:14,987
You can't talk like that.
Your father loved you. That's enough.

1385
01:11:14,988 --> 01:11:16,788
But it's not enough, is it?

1386
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:19,461
Not when I could be
a fraud throughout life.

1387
01:11:19,462 --> 01:11:23,071
A Frenchman who stole the role
of the proper heir.

1388
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:25,126
But that would be Matthew's father,

1389
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:26,799
and now his son
who will inherit,

1390
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,354
then what difference does it make
in the long run?

1391
01:11:38,472 --> 01:11:40,631
I'm afraid it's a real
blow to daddy

1392
01:11:40,632 --> 01:11:42,665
discover that you may
be an impostor.

1393
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,439
If it's true,
he will be devastated.

1394
01:11:45,956 --> 01:11:47,089
<i>Maman.</i>

1395
01:11:47,707 --> 01:11:49,820
You know, I liked seeing
you working here.

1396
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,514
I got a preview
of what you are missing.

1397
01:11:52,695 --> 01:11:54,261
I don't think I'm ready

1398
01:11:54,262 --> 01:11:56,382
to say goodbye to this
part of my life.

1399
01:11:57,021 --> 01:12:00,006
I looked at the miniature,
Lady Hexham, and, you are right.

1400
01:12:00,007 --> 01:12:01,320
The matter is settled.

1401
01:12:01,765 --> 01:12:05,005
Please take it to your grandmother.
It's hers anyway.

1402
01:12:26,991 --> 01:12:28,751
Just a moment, please.

1403
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,193
What is it?

1404
01:12:34,194 --> 01:12:35,706
Whatever your secret is,

1405
01:12:35,707 --> 01:12:37,734
is not a good time
to share with daddy?

1406
01:12:52,642 --> 01:12:55,093
<i>Yes, nothing compares to the sea.</i>

1407
01:12:55,094 --> 01:12:57,154
That one was beautiful. It was...

1408
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:01,309
You have been so kind,
but it's time to go home.

1409
01:13:01,436 --> 01:13:03,135
We will too, soon.

1410
01:13:03,136 --> 01:13:05,747
As you know, the contents of the house
already belongs to your mother.

1411
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,577
You should take what you want.

1412
01:13:07,578 --> 01:13:09,551
No. His wishes were clear.

1413
01:13:16,602 --> 01:13:18,608
Our lawyers
can manage the rest.

1414
01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:21,775
I know it's late,
but can we walk?

1415
01:13:21,776 --> 01:13:23,008
Yes, of course.

1416
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:25,774
<i>Monsieur,</i>
we are indebted to you.

1417
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,083
Thank you.

1418
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,196
- Madame.
- Thank you.

1419
01:14:04,764 --> 01:14:06,378
Why didn't you tell me before?

1420
01:14:06,379 --> 01:14:08,616
I was, and suddenly
we were coming here.

1421
01:14:08,617 --> 01:14:10,486
But you never
should have come here.

1422
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:13,452
We have to get her to a doctor,
not some quack in Marseilles.

1423
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:16,013
Dr. Clarkson is able
of presenting a diagnosis.

1424
01:14:16,014 --> 01:14:18,392
We will go to London.
We will go to America, if you need us.

1425
01:14:18,393 --> 01:14:21,006
- We'll discuss it better later.
- You should have told me!

1426
01:14:21,007 --> 01:14:23,836
With the chance of disease
take over our lives?

1427
01:14:23,837 --> 01:14:24,981
It can't be that bad.

1428
01:14:24,982 --> 01:14:26,634
Robert, I run a hospital.

1429
01:14:26,635 --> 01:14:28,980
Do you think I just sat there
and heard nothing?

1430
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:30,534
No. No, no, no.

1431
01:14:30,535 --> 01:14:31,701
No. No.

1432
01:14:32,473 --> 01:14:34,227
That's not what I want.

1433
01:14:34,587 --> 01:14:35,933
We are not sad people.

1434
01:14:36,754 --> 01:14:39,832
The fact that I am sick now
does not make us sad.

1435
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:44,451
Oh my gosh. My...
Losing my mother and my name.

1436
01:14:45,286 --> 01:14:47,114
Can I lose you too?

1437
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:49,761
- I can't take it.
- If I can take it, you can.

1438
01:14:49,981 --> 01:14:51,960
Remember
that I love you from the beginning.

1439
01:14:53,143 --> 01:14:54,787
I loved him before he loved me.

1440
01:14:55,469 --> 01:14:57,234
I was always ashamed of it.

1441
01:14:57,235 --> 01:14:59,824
Don't have. I had money.
You needed it.

1442
01:15:01,678 --> 01:15:03,124
And then came love.

1443
01:15:04,195 --> 01:15:06,369
And we are happy, aren't we?

1444
01:15:06,797 --> 01:15:07,832
Hon.

1445
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:15,829
You are everything to me.

1446
01:15:16,839 --> 01:15:17,839
All.

1447
01:15:19,096 --> 01:15:21,723
And I hope to be everything
for a while yet.

1448
01:15:22,725 --> 01:15:23,725
Now...

1449
01:15:25,863 --> 01:15:27,756
we must start early tomorrow

1450
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:29,623
and it's past
past my bedtime.

1451
01:15:31,466 --> 01:15:32,500
Hon.

1452
01:15:33,339 --> 01:15:35,754
I hope we can get passage
for the Blue Train.

1453
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:07,009
Why is the camera
in a padded case?

1454
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:08,839
Anyone would think
to be a lunatic.

1455
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,288
It is certainly unpredictable.

1456
01:16:10,289 --> 01:16:13,330
The microphone cannot pick up
any noise

1457
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:15,525
unless I approve.

1458
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:19,391
The padded box contains
the sound of the camera running.

1459
01:16:20,193 --> 01:16:22,680
So we are really
in your hands, Mr. Stubbins.

1460
01:16:22,681 --> 01:16:24,407
Your words, not mine.

1461
01:16:24,694 --> 01:16:26,889
Everybody ready?
Let's go for a take.

1462
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:29,063
- E...
- Be aware

1463
01:16:29,064 --> 01:16:33,110
from where the microphones are
and speak clearly.

1464
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:36,786
And this time, Myrna,
mime, but don't speak.

1465
01:16:36,787 --> 01:16:38,730
- No word. Right?
- I'm not an idiot.

1466
01:16:38,731 --> 01:16:41,503
- We just want to hear from Lady Mary.
- Mary, please.

1467
01:16:41,504 --> 01:16:42,524
Very good.

1468
01:16:42,525 --> 01:16:44,289
Albert, is the clapperboard ready?

1469
01:16:46,808 --> 01:16:48,085
Ring the bell.

1470
01:16:48,086 --> 01:16:49,501
Roll the camera.

1471
01:16:51,891 --> 01:16:52,891
Albert.

1472
01:16:55,094 --> 01:16:56,129
E...

1473
01:16:58,138 --> 01:16:59,139
action.

1474
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:02,074
<i>Madame, Messieurs,
placez vos paris.</i>

1475
01:17:04,941 --> 01:17:06,027
Bill.

1476
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:07,898
You are back.

1477
01:17:08,012 --> 01:17:10,045
- I always come back.
- Sorry.

1478
01:17:10,046 --> 01:17:11,125
- Cut!
- Sorry.

1479
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,231
Everybody, back to
to the beginning, please.

1480
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:16,908
Roll the camera.

1481
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:22,205
And... action.

1482
01:17:22,206 --> 01:17:24,622
<i>Madame, Messieurs,
placez vos paris.</i>

1483
01:17:26,797 --> 01:17:27,953
Bill.

1484
01:17:28,164 --> 01:17:29,505
You are back.

1485
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,197
I always come back.

1486
01:17:31,198 --> 01:17:32,217
- Sorry!
- Cut!

1487
01:17:32,218 --> 01:17:34,844
It's hard for me because
she is right in my ear!

1488
01:17:34,845 --> 01:17:37,045
- And he caught me walking out of there!
- I understand.

1489
01:17:37,046 --> 01:17:38,058
Restart, please.

1490
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:41,448
Bill.

1491
01:17:41,693 --> 01:17:42,813
You are back.

1492
01:17:43,175 --> 01:17:44,866
- I always come back.
- Holy shit!

1493
01:17:44,867 --> 01:17:46,906
- No need to swear!
- Myrna, I'm sorry.

1494
01:17:46,907 --> 01:17:48,101
- That's enough.
- Myrna.

1495
01:17:48,102 --> 01:17:50,576
Get your hands off me.
Get out of my way!

1496
01:17:50,577 --> 01:17:51,739
- Myrna, darling!
- No!

1497
01:17:55,222 --> 01:17:56,498
What now?

1498
01:17:56,771 --> 01:17:59,097
I knew she would be
a problem from the start.

1499
01:17:59,098 --> 01:18:00,637
She is rude, crude.

1500
01:18:00,638 --> 01:18:03,097
Fact, but now she
also feels humiliated.

1501
01:18:03,098 --> 01:18:05,784
Moving her mouth as
Lady Mary's voice comes out of it.

1502
01:18:05,785 --> 01:18:07,924
And this is his
first sound film.

1503
01:18:07,925 --> 01:18:09,290
What will happen to her?

1504
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:11,056
I guess her career
is over.

1505
01:18:11,057 --> 01:18:12,928
I suppose for many it is over.

1506
01:18:12,929 --> 01:18:15,308
The point is that they
have to bring her back.

1507
01:18:15,309 --> 01:18:18,062
But what if she doesn't come?
They can't force her.

1508
01:18:18,302 --> 01:18:19,764
Why don't you two go?

1509
01:18:20,411 --> 01:18:22,815
You know how to talk to her.
They don't.

1510
01:18:26,723 --> 01:18:29,495
Myrna, dear,
please come down.

1511
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:31,428
<i>We can't do anything without you.</i>

1512
01:18:31,429 --> 01:18:33,241
You can talk without me!

1513
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:34,616
<i>Just go away!</i>

1514
01:18:36,806 --> 01:18:37,913
Milady.

1515
01:18:40,102 --> 01:18:42,288
I think it is a good idea
to let the maids

1516
01:18:42,289 --> 01:18:44,807
see if you can make her
comfortable, Mr. Barber.

1517
01:18:44,935 --> 01:18:47,122
If you think so, yes.
Stand back, everyone.

1518
01:18:50,437 --> 01:18:52,010
May we
come in, Miss Dalgleish?

1519
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:53,764
We understand
what you are going through.

1520
01:18:54,502 --> 01:18:56,708
This is true,
and you know it.

1521
01:19:01,724 --> 01:19:04,803
I'm not going out just to
humiliate me and laugh at me.

1522
01:19:04,804 --> 01:19:06,257
They won't do that.

1523
01:19:06,391 --> 01:19:08,170
You should hear them at the premieres.

1524
01:19:08,171 --> 01:19:10,951
"Don't speak. Don't open your mouth."
They despise me.

1525
01:19:10,952 --> 01:19:13,691
Why didn't you take
diction classes? Lots of people do.

1526
01:19:13,692 --> 01:19:15,311
I tried. I couldn't.

1527
01:19:15,312 --> 01:19:16,425
I didn't get it right.

1528
01:19:16,745 --> 01:19:19,374
Something has been bothering you
since you got here.

1529
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:21,203
- What is it?
- That's it.

1530
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:24,016
I knew it was over
as soon as I saw The Jazz Singer.

1531
01:19:24,017 --> 01:19:25,968
It looks like a sword
hanging over me.

1532
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:29,076
I thought I would have a few more
films, but this will be the last.

1533
01:19:29,077 --> 01:19:31,355
You don't know that.
It was fine as far as I could see.

1534
01:19:31,356 --> 01:19:32,865
And how do I look?

1535
01:19:32,866 --> 01:19:35,331
The fact is that I am finished,
as the Yanks say.

1536
01:19:35,332 --> 01:19:36,612
I am a thing of the past.

1537
01:19:39,595 --> 01:19:41,085
Let's go, ma'am.

1538
01:19:41,301 --> 01:19:43,407
You are not talking
with your fan club right now.

1539
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:44,440
What?

1540
01:19:44,441 --> 01:19:47,014
You are famous, beautiful and rich.

1541
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:49,539
So what if your career
in cinema is over?

1542
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:51,510
There are other things
you can do.

1543
01:19:52,025 --> 01:19:53,615
Now, pull yourself together.

1544
01:19:53,616 --> 01:19:56,601
In the meantime, try to be polite
polite with people.

1545
01:19:56,602 --> 01:19:57,629
Come on, Daisy.

1546
01:19:57,896 --> 01:20:00,692
You are one of us,
not like them.

1547
01:20:01,202 --> 01:20:02,715
Just remember that.

1548
01:20:03,348 --> 01:20:04,475
Now, let's go.

1549
01:20:04,476 --> 01:20:06,381
Fix your hair
and let's go.

1550
01:20:08,198 --> 01:20:09,411
How are you doing there?

1551
01:20:09,412 --> 01:20:11,811
<i>She's almost ready,
Mr. Barber.

1552
01:20:12,722 --> 01:20:14,984
You are, aren't you,
Miss Dalgleish?

1553
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:22,562
I had a sister like you.

1554
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:25,109
I miss her. Every single day.

1555
01:20:25,418 --> 01:20:26,662
You remind me of her.

1556
01:20:29,186 --> 01:20:31,317
She died of
flu in 1919.

1557
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:35,208
I didn't think it would touch our family, but
family, but you never know.

1558
01:20:38,893 --> 01:20:39,986
Let's go?

1559
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,255
<i>I'm not worth it.</i>

1560
01:20:50,256 --> 01:20:52,012
You are worth it to me.

1561
01:20:58,180 --> 01:20:59,355
<i>Rien ne va plus.</i>

1562
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:07,812
It seems that you
are my savior.

1563
01:21:08,134 --> 01:21:12,483
And I intend to continue as your
your savior for a long time to come.

1564
01:21:13,183 --> 01:21:14,219
Mary?

1565
01:21:15,191 --> 01:21:17,079
What the hell is going on?

1566
01:21:17,404 --> 01:21:20,444
- Cut!
- No!

1567
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:24,667
So you put them in place?

1568
01:21:24,668 --> 01:21:27,813
I think I can say that
without fear of contradiction.

1569
01:21:27,814 --> 01:21:29,620
I did not leave them in doubt

1570
01:21:29,621 --> 01:21:31,426
how to do things
things correctly.

1571
01:21:31,427 --> 01:21:32,438
Mr. Bates?

1572
01:21:32,439 --> 01:21:34,336
You made
your feelings clear.

1573
01:21:34,337 --> 01:21:36,536
They learned how to deal
with an English butler.

1574
01:21:37,577 --> 01:21:39,443
Get your coats.

1575
01:21:40,965 --> 01:21:43,810
Watching you,
I remembered the pieces

1576
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:45,444
that the three of them were doing in the attic.

1577
01:21:45,445 --> 01:21:47,798
Except that there is a lot
more to it this time.

1578
01:21:47,799 --> 01:21:50,456
I don't want to be harsh,
but how do we know she's good?

1579
01:21:50,457 --> 01:21:52,170
She is absolutely superb.

1580
01:21:53,577 --> 01:21:55,663
I showed the telegram
from Daddy to Grandma.

1581
01:21:55,664 --> 01:21:57,291
Tom,
you should take a look.

1582
01:21:57,492 --> 01:21:58,807
We can go up now.

1583
01:21:58,808 --> 01:21:59,983
You are right.

1584
01:22:00,487 --> 01:22:01,800
It must be you.

1585
01:22:02,594 --> 01:22:04,253
You can give her the thumbnail.

1586
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:08,405
What is this miniature?

1587
01:22:09,202 --> 01:22:10,753
It is a long story.

1588
01:22:10,986 --> 01:22:14,585
Talkies are good news for West End
for West End actors.

1589
01:22:14,586 --> 01:22:16,970
Good news for them,
bad news for me.

1590
01:22:17,993 --> 01:22:20,305
Death by microphone, isn't it, Guy?

1591
01:22:20,306 --> 01:22:22,593
Our business has always
been a game of chance.

1592
01:22:22,594 --> 01:22:23,766
Well said.

1593
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:29,520
I have an idea,
Miss Dalgleish,

1594
01:22:29,521 --> 01:22:30,740
that can help.

1595
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,026
I will take your mother
to the hospital first thing in the morning.

1596
01:22:35,027 --> 01:22:36,441
I am apprehensive, of course.

1597
01:22:37,104 --> 01:22:39,230
But this is for you
to hear, not for her.

1598
01:22:39,578 --> 01:22:42,037
I thought they
could fight more.

1599
01:22:42,038 --> 01:22:43,164
So do we.

1600
01:22:43,165 --> 01:22:44,651
Mom wanted it.

1601
01:22:45,514 --> 01:22:47,277
And then Edith
found this.

1602
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,565
There is something written next to it.

1603
01:23:02,635 --> 01:23:05,701
I... I think they think

1604
01:23:05,702 --> 01:23:08,395
that something improper
happened between us.

1605
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:11,669
- I believe everyone thinks.
- No.

1606
01:23:12,182 --> 01:23:13,275
I wouldn't say that.

1607
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:17,269
You are a terrible
liar, Tom.

1608
01:23:17,796 --> 01:23:21,869
I would never get anywhere
if I was a liar like you.

1609
01:23:23,797 --> 01:23:26,448
We will try to meet
at the mansion every year.

1610
01:23:26,449 --> 01:23:28,892
The whole family together,
in the summer.

1611
01:23:28,893 --> 01:23:30,832
Won't it be too hot?

1612
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:32,583
We hope you
come and find out.

1613
01:23:32,584 --> 01:23:33,833
No.

1614
01:23:33,834 --> 01:23:37,528
No. That's over for me.

1615
01:23:38,109 --> 01:23:39,187
Never mind.

1616
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,215
I am happy to have
met you, Tom.

1617
01:23:43,709 --> 01:23:46,502
I think that in the end,
we got along pretty well, didn't we?

1618
01:23:46,709 --> 01:23:47,781
I think so.

1619
01:23:48,126 --> 01:23:49,159
In the end.

1620
01:23:49,423 --> 01:23:52,422
You were not what we had
in mind for Sybil,

1621
01:23:52,423 --> 01:23:54,131
but we overcame it.

1622
01:23:54,132 --> 01:23:55,685
And that's life, isn't it?

1623
01:23:55,686 --> 01:23:58,206
Overcoming the unexpected.

1624
01:23:59,412 --> 01:24:01,424
And maybe learning from it,

1625
01:24:01,425 --> 01:24:03,425
what I think we can say
say we did.

1626
01:24:03,426 --> 01:24:05,946
You have been my good friend
over the years, Violet.

1627
01:24:06,219 --> 01:24:07,632
I hope it was for you.

1628
01:24:08,092 --> 01:24:10,922
And now you are settled.

1629
01:24:11,405 --> 01:24:14,611
Maud is back in the family
and everyone is happy.

1630
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,314
When was the miniature painted?

1631
01:24:20,994 --> 01:24:22,297
Did you pose for this?

1632
01:24:22,804 --> 01:24:23,998
No, we... we

1633
01:24:24,265 --> 01:24:28,269
We went for a walk in the city one day,

1634
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:31,548
and there was a store where a man
was taking pictures.

1635
01:24:31,549 --> 01:24:34,168
Yes, I remember because
he was the first photographer

1636
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:35,552
I had already seen it.

1637
01:24:35,553 --> 01:24:37,210
They must have copied from that.

1638
01:24:37,769 --> 01:24:42,329
Montmirail sent me to London
with a silly, scribbled letter.

1639
01:24:42,819 --> 01:24:44,545
I sent it back.

1640
01:24:45,502 --> 01:24:47,059
Of course, I should have burned it.

1641
01:24:48,403 --> 01:24:49,749
We will let you rest.

1642
01:24:49,976 --> 01:24:52,293
But we wanted to say
how grateful we are.

1643
01:24:52,394 --> 01:24:53,553
And Sybbie will be too.

1644
01:24:54,199 --> 01:24:55,439
It is a beautiful place.

1645
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,093
This I remember.

1646
01:25:19,175 --> 01:25:20,459
Time for bed.

1647
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:22,868
Yes, I'll just fix that.

1648
01:25:23,312 --> 01:25:24,600
What are they?

1649
01:25:24,601 --> 01:25:27,328
The letters
From <i>Monsieur</i> de Montmirail.

1650
01:25:28,567 --> 01:25:29,745
Are they well named?

1651
01:25:31,177 --> 01:25:32,574
I'm afraid so.

1652
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:35,896
So she lied when she said
that she didn't remember.

1653
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:38,789
"Lying" would be heavy.
Maybe I forgot a little.

1654
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:41,385
I can't believe you didn't remember
everything that happened.

1655
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:42,953
I will ask when I go to see her.

1656
01:26:06,459 --> 01:26:08,266
Is this the way I find
Mr. Barrow?

1657
01:26:08,919 --> 01:26:09,945
Left.

1658
01:26:17,065 --> 01:26:18,550
So this is where it hides.

1659
01:26:18,551 --> 01:26:20,488
Is there anything I can
with anything, sir?

1660
01:26:20,489 --> 01:26:22,791
Well, start by not calling me "sir.
"sir".

1661
01:26:23,937 --> 01:26:26,550
I'm not sure
what Mr. Carson would think,

1662
01:26:26,551 --> 01:26:30,355
if I were to receive a guest
from upstairs, Mr. Dexter.

1663
01:26:30,356 --> 01:26:32,703
Well, Mr. Carson is not
in charge now.

1664
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,704
You are.

1665
01:26:34,718 --> 01:26:37,298
Suppose someone walks in.
What would they say?

1666
01:26:37,991 --> 01:26:39,054
I don't mind.

1667
01:26:39,568 --> 01:26:41,555
I have lived in America for ten years.

1668
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:43,519
I don't believe
these things anymore.

1669
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:46,132
Please, call me Guy.

1670
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:50,570
What is your real name?

1671
01:26:51,391 --> 01:26:52,417
Quentin.

1672
01:26:53,502 --> 01:26:55,015
Quentin Sidebotham.

1673
01:26:56,888 --> 01:26:58,335
That was a good decision.

1674
01:27:00,524 --> 01:27:02,319
Do you know what you will do next?

1675
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,517
I don't think anyone knows.

1676
01:27:04,415 --> 01:27:06,795
I will go home and wait for
the events.

1677
01:27:07,377 --> 01:27:10,187
You could call Clive Brook
or Charlie Chaplin,

1678
01:27:10,188 --> 01:27:11,366
see what they think.

1679
01:27:11,945 --> 01:27:13,239
Do you know Charlie Chaplin?

1680
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,201
A little wild
for me, but yes, I know him.

1681
01:27:17,028 --> 01:27:18,646
Hollywood has a bad
publicity,

1682
01:27:18,647 --> 01:27:20,777
but I live in a place called
Hancock Park,

1683
01:27:20,778 --> 01:27:22,436
and it's pretty cool.

1684
01:27:24,177 --> 01:27:25,396
I believe.

1685
01:27:27,549 --> 01:27:29,842
Well, why don't you come
and see for yourself?

1686
01:27:34,387 --> 01:27:35,387
What?

1687
01:27:36,455 --> 01:27:37,628
I mean.

1688
01:27:40,401 --> 01:27:42,722
I travel a lot for work and...

1689
01:27:43,455 --> 01:27:45,875
I don't have a wife
to take care of me, so...

1690
01:27:46,546 --> 01:27:47,766
you could take care of.

1691
01:27:49,802 --> 01:27:51,161
Would I be your jack?

1692
01:27:51,862 --> 01:27:53,162
More than that.

1693
01:27:54,104 --> 01:27:55,524
You would manage the house

1694
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:58,311
and organize our trips,
make me comfortable.

1695
01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:00,791
It would make us both comfortable.

1696
01:28:02,103 --> 01:28:04,608
If my career is over,
we will have to rethink.

1697
01:28:04,609 --> 01:28:06,056
Your career will not end.

1698
01:28:06,539 --> 01:28:07,575
Good.

1699
01:28:08,628 --> 01:28:09,732
Well...

1700
01:28:11,389 --> 01:28:12,735
let me know when you have ...

1701
01:28:13,943 --> 01:28:15,043
reached a decision.

1702
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:25,668
Right.
I have everything I need.

1703
01:28:26,403 --> 01:28:28,335
I will go to the house
with the results

1704
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:29,450
as soon as you have them.

1705
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:31,350
But do you feel optimistic?

1706
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,603
Robert, you don't need
this kind of talk.

1707
01:28:33,604 --> 01:28:37,483
Lady Grantham understands too much
to pretend she doesn't.

1708
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:40,556
But even though everything
may seem bad,

1709
01:28:40,557 --> 01:28:41,766
there is still a surgery.

1710
01:28:41,767 --> 01:28:43,738
Let's take it one step at a time.

1711
01:28:44,368 --> 01:28:45,418
My goodness.

1712
01:28:46,528 --> 01:28:49,815
Robert doesn't see it, but things
could be much worse.

1713
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:51,963
How many face these things

1714
01:28:51,964 --> 01:28:53,709
wasting their lives?

1715
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:54,816
I don't.

1716
01:28:56,026 --> 01:28:57,096
No way.

1717
01:29:00,852 --> 01:29:02,710
How are things at the farm?

1718
01:29:02,711 --> 01:29:03,855
Tight.

1719
01:29:04,118 --> 01:29:05,408
Poor Mr. Mason.

1720
01:29:05,409 --> 01:29:07,949
He would be so unhappy
to hear you say that.

1721
01:29:08,687 --> 01:29:10,827
He has been talking
about you lately.

1722
01:29:10,828 --> 01:29:11,828
Really?

1723
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:16,488
Saying what a beautiful woman
you are and how much he admires you.

1724
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:18,075
Him? Really?

1725
01:29:18,295 --> 01:29:20,078
But he will not
take it any further.

1726
01:29:20,381 --> 01:29:21,401
Why not?

1727
01:29:21,735 --> 01:29:24,480
Because he can't ask
you to live on the farm

1728
01:29:24,481 --> 01:29:26,566
and cannot be
dependent on a woman.

1729
01:29:26,567 --> 01:29:27,720
Can't he?

1730
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,484
We will see about that.

1731
01:29:34,294 --> 01:29:35,603
Here's what we found,

1732
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:38,820
when I was going through
Violet's things.

1733
01:29:39,995 --> 01:29:42,294
The letters
of the Marquis of Montmirail.

1734
01:29:42,295 --> 01:29:44,620
Wow. It doesn't look
good for Dad,

1735
01:29:44,621 --> 01:29:46,552
if she had to
to keep this a secret.

1736
01:29:46,553 --> 01:29:48,146
Well, let's not hurry.

1737
01:29:48,147 --> 01:29:50,593
- I'm sorry. Did they say anything?
- No, no.

1738
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:53,217
- Can I talk to you alone?
- Yes.

1739
01:29:54,438 --> 01:29:55,851
So what happens now?

1740
01:29:55,852 --> 01:29:57,944
Well, I thought we could
read them together.

1741
01:29:57,945 --> 01:30:01,017
Bertie, you and I can do
this and report what's in it.

1742
01:30:01,018 --> 01:30:03,433
And let's break the news to Daddy.

1743
01:30:10,316 --> 01:30:12,007
What happened?

1744
01:30:12,723 --> 01:30:14,028
You have to help me.

1745
01:30:14,029 --> 01:30:16,571
We are about to shoot
our last act,

1746
01:30:16,572 --> 01:30:19,279
the dinner when Benson
realizes that he must give up on her

1747
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,365
and runs to London.

1748
01:30:20,366 --> 01:30:21,925
I know. I just learned.

1749
01:30:21,926 --> 01:30:24,246
Molesley did
a wonderful job.

1750
01:30:24,459 --> 01:30:27,298
I said that the extras were
tired of not being paid,

1751
01:30:27,299 --> 01:30:30,199
and I don't blame them, but I'm still waiting for the money.
I'm still waiting for the money.

1752
01:30:30,385 --> 01:30:32,944
They're not going to do
anything too drastic, are they?

1753
01:30:33,191 --> 01:30:34,817
They say they won't work.

1754
01:30:35,891 --> 01:30:37,049
But how can I help?

1755
01:30:38,324 --> 01:30:42,347
Can your servants help?

1756
01:30:43,748 --> 01:30:45,454
You can ask them.

1757
01:30:52,692 --> 01:30:54,729
There is something else,
Mr. Barber?

1758
01:30:56,398 --> 01:30:58,918
I would never have gone through
through any of this without you.

1759
01:30:59,904 --> 01:31:02,110
If this is true,
then I am happy.

1760
01:31:05,355 --> 01:31:06,690
Can I kiss you?

1761
01:31:11,022 --> 01:31:12,058
No.

1762
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:13,801
Don't you want to?

1763
01:31:15,813 --> 01:31:19,138
I'm afraid I'm
too old-fashioned to believe

1764
01:31:19,139 --> 01:31:21,778
that what I want is the
only thing that matters.

1765
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:25,550
- Have I offended you?
- Not at all.

1766
01:31:26,805 --> 01:31:29,291
Nothing is more pleasant
for a married woman,

1767
01:31:29,292 --> 01:31:32,084
than to discover that she
is still an object of desire.

1768
01:31:32,945 --> 01:31:35,952
Better not tell your husband
when he returns. He might,

1769
01:31:36,212 --> 01:31:37,390
hit me on the nose.

1770
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:38,610
Wouldn't that be exciting?

1771
01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:41,693
Two beautiful men
fighting for my favors.

1772
01:31:44,401 --> 01:31:45,809
You called, milady?

1773
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:49,123
- Did she keep his letters?
- Apparently all of them.

1774
01:31:49,124 --> 01:31:52,743
I will not ask what you have hidden,
if you tell me the answer.

1775
01:31:52,744 --> 01:31:54,680
Most of them
are quite sad.

1776
01:31:55,204 --> 01:31:58,197
There was clearly no love
between him and his wife.

1777
01:31:58,404 --> 01:32:01,190
But what do they say about
the days you spent in France?

1778
01:32:01,191 --> 01:32:03,471
I'm afraid they didn't
corresponded at the time.

1779
01:32:03,723 --> 01:32:06,830
So we still have no proof
of what really happened.

1780
01:32:06,831 --> 01:32:09,558
I suppose that's where
where the mystery lies.

1781
01:32:09,696 --> 01:32:11,732
I'm going to see Violet tomorrow.

1782
01:32:12,496 --> 01:32:13,787
Should I go?

1783
01:32:13,788 --> 01:32:14,809
No.

1784
01:32:15,379 --> 01:32:18,221
You are what lawyers call
an "interested party".

1785
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:19,692
I don't.

1786
01:32:22,132 --> 01:32:24,878
Meaning that we would be
up there on the screen

1787
01:32:24,879 --> 01:32:26,711
with Miss Dalgleish
and Mr. Dexter?

1788
01:32:26,712 --> 01:32:28,872
- Are you sure?
- That's what I mean.

1789
01:32:28,873 --> 01:32:31,013
I will do it.
So will Mr. Carson.

1790
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,301
Mr. Molesley will
want to participate.

1791
01:32:33,302 --> 01:32:35,204
- How many do you need?
- We need ten.

1792
01:32:35,205 --> 01:32:37,404
- Mrs. Denker, would you like it?
- Maybe not.

1793
01:32:37,405 --> 01:32:39,517
I want to keep an eye
on His Lordship.

1794
01:32:39,518 --> 01:32:41,339
What about Mr. Mason?
You might ask.

1795
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,199
Run to the farm
and ask him.

1796
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,706
And do they have clothes for us?

1797
01:32:44,707 --> 01:32:46,403
They will need time
to adjust.

1798
01:32:46,404 --> 01:32:48,099
Come up for a taste
at the end of the day.

1799
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:50,149
We are created.

1800
01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:51,956
Who will wait for us?

1801
01:32:51,957 --> 01:32:54,084
I was thinking
we could use Albert.

1802
01:32:54,543 --> 01:32:56,535
Would you be serving
Miss Dalgleish?

1803
01:32:56,536 --> 01:32:57,713
I think so.

1804
01:32:57,714 --> 01:33:01,628
Well... Okay, let's
back to work, please!

1805
01:33:01,629 --> 01:33:02,962
All right, let's go.

1806
01:33:04,957 --> 01:33:07,960
Filming must be the slowest
slowest occupation known to man.

1807
01:33:07,961 --> 01:33:10,093
It makes a glacier
look impatient.

1808
01:33:10,094 --> 01:33:12,503
I suppose Robert
is in hell.

1809
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:15,962
He was wishing it would all
would be over when they returned.

1810
01:33:16,506 --> 01:33:18,670
You can ease
his pain if you want.

1811
01:33:19,797 --> 01:33:22,571
We find the letters
of <i>Monsieur</i> de Montmirail.

1812
01:33:23,117 --> 01:33:26,306
But Robert still doesn't have
the answer he needs.

1813
01:33:27,671 --> 01:33:29,776
I won't pretend
that I don't understand you.

1814
01:33:29,884 --> 01:33:31,923
Did they talk about the miniature?

1815
01:33:31,924 --> 01:33:33,549
What is its meaning?

1816
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:34,953
Well, could you get it?

1817
01:33:34,954 --> 01:33:37,335
It is in the bottom right drawer.

1818
01:33:37,676 --> 01:33:39,252
Opening, at the back,

1819
01:33:39,253 --> 01:33:41,573
you will find the letter
he sent with it.

1820
01:33:42,203 --> 01:33:45,556
It is still there after
after all this time.

1821
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:48,476
Could you read it?

1822
01:33:54,525 --> 01:33:55,964
"<i>Chère</i> Violette,

1823
01:33:55,965 --> 01:33:59,411
we missed the chance
to know perfect love.

1824
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:05,193
But we still can,
if you just change your mind."

1825
01:34:06,927 --> 01:34:08,722
Why didn't you just
not tell us?

1826
01:34:10,534 --> 01:34:12,198
There was nothing to tell.

1827
01:34:13,607 --> 01:34:14,939
Nothing happened.

1828
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,099
Besides years of being harassed.

1829
01:34:17,398 --> 01:34:18,606
Well, no.

1830
01:34:18,607 --> 01:34:20,515
This is not
totally correct.

1831
01:34:20,896 --> 01:34:22,033
So what is it?

1832
01:34:22,442 --> 01:34:24,932
I never saw him after that.

1833
01:34:24,933 --> 01:34:26,763
I knew I would have given in.

1834
01:34:27,093 --> 01:34:31,217
If I had been tempted
again, I would have failed.

1835
01:34:34,078 --> 01:34:36,688
I was a fool for love
back then.

1836
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:39,846
A few years later,
we went to Russia,

1837
01:34:39,847 --> 01:34:41,988
and I got myself
in terrible trouble.

1838
01:34:42,711 --> 01:34:44,314
Well, I almost did.

1839
01:34:44,315 --> 01:34:46,604
With Prince Kuragin.
Yes, I know.

1840
01:34:47,192 --> 01:34:49,303
How did you avoid this
with the marquis?

1841
01:34:49,304 --> 01:34:51,303
I can't imagine.

1842
01:34:51,304 --> 01:34:56,275
He was the most attractive man
I have ever met in my life.

1843
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,208
But I was newly married,

1844
01:34:58,209 --> 01:35:01,709
And it would have been a shame, you know,
to spoil that.

1845
01:35:03,429 --> 01:35:04,897
I wish you had.

1846
01:35:04,898 --> 01:35:07,603
I didn't want you to think
that my life was a fraud,

1847
01:35:07,604 --> 01:35:08,921
why it wasn't.

1848
01:35:08,922 --> 01:35:11,428
I was happy
with Robert's father.

1849
01:35:11,429 --> 01:35:15,081
Well... happy enough,
in that English way,

1850
01:35:15,082 --> 01:35:17,922
when... you never speak

1851
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:21,643
about anything,
but trust each other.

1852
01:35:21,854 --> 01:35:25,755
If they had put
Kuragin and Montmirail together,

1853
01:35:25,756 --> 01:35:29,632
I would have come out as a
sort of scarlet woman.

1854
01:35:30,897 --> 01:35:33,390
You don't look
very scarlet.

1855
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:36,874
Well, I am trusting
in you to be sure

1856
01:35:37,414 --> 01:35:39,589
that this is not how
that I will be remembered.

1857
01:35:40,716 --> 01:35:43,622
Well, the next earl
will be Matthew's son,

1858
01:35:44,105 --> 01:35:47,219
my grandson, your great-grandson.

1859
01:35:47,592 --> 01:35:50,192
I will do my best
to make him value his name.

1860
01:35:50,785 --> 01:35:52,035
I know it will.

1861
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:56,302
I know I can trust you
to do the right thing.

1862
01:35:56,571 --> 01:35:58,337
This is very generous
on your part.

1863
01:35:58,338 --> 01:36:01,168
Because we had
our fights, you and I.

1864
01:36:01,169 --> 01:36:05,478
Well, that's true, but I'm glad
that you came to Downton.

1865
01:36:05,479 --> 01:36:08,060
I have never met anyone
in whose opinion

1866
01:36:08,061 --> 01:36:10,872
I could trust,
be morally correct,

1867
01:36:10,873 --> 01:36:12,052
not for years.

1868
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,793
Well, not since
since my mother died.

1869
01:36:15,907 --> 01:36:17,174
You must have asked yourself

1870
01:36:17,175 --> 01:36:19,400
why I asked you
to examine my papers.

1871
01:36:19,401 --> 01:36:20,527
I wondered.

1872
01:36:21,001 --> 01:36:24,714
When I think of that world
of long ago,

1873
01:36:25,584 --> 01:36:30,301
when I... I was a girl
in my first crinoline

1874
01:36:32,599 --> 01:36:36,193
In those moments,
I feel as if I had been

1875
01:36:36,194 --> 01:36:39,912
transported
to a different planet.

1876
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:42,448
And so you have been.

1877
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,351
Like every human being
who lives long enough.

1878
01:36:46,352 --> 01:36:48,905
And I have. Lived a lot.

1879
01:36:50,212 --> 01:36:51,365
I didn't mean that.

1880
01:37:05,384 --> 01:37:07,613
I'm sorry, but I
could not wait.

1881
01:37:07,614 --> 01:37:10,203
Everything is fine. Nothing happened.

1882
01:37:10,893 --> 01:37:12,410
You are your father's son.

1883
01:37:16,453 --> 01:37:18,782
I can't pretend
that I am not relieved.

1884
01:37:18,783 --> 01:37:21,016
I can't pretend
that I am not insulted.

1885
01:37:23,103 --> 01:37:24,976
Why do you think
he gave you the mansion,

1886
01:37:24,977 --> 01:37:27,485
if it has nothing to do
with my birth?

1887
01:37:27,486 --> 01:37:30,156
I think it had everything to do
with his birth.

1888
01:37:30,157 --> 01:37:32,996
When you were born
sent a message

1889
01:37:32,997 --> 01:37:36,169
that what he wanted
would never happen

1890
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:38,231
and it was time to move on.

1891
01:37:38,466 --> 01:37:40,647
He never loved his wife
as he loved you.

1892
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:42,826
The mansion is proof of this.

1893
01:37:43,793 --> 01:37:44,828
Well...

1894
01:37:46,807 --> 01:37:48,434
it's not for me to say.

1895
01:37:55,421 --> 01:37:56,594
Right.

1896
01:38:04,781 --> 01:38:07,571
I looked at the final scenes.
I am impressed.

1897
01:38:07,572 --> 01:38:10,718
This kind of work appeals to you,
writing plays for the screen?

1898
01:38:11,678 --> 01:38:14,677
- What, you mean...
- Say, four a year.

1899
01:38:14,678 --> 01:38:16,425
I would send you the book or short story

1900
01:38:16,426 --> 01:38:19,150
that I am interested
with my notes and suggestions.

1901
01:38:19,151 --> 01:38:22,387
I would pay 700 guineas
up to a thousand.

1902
01:38:22,388 --> 01:38:24,589
- <i>Mr. Barber</i>.
- What?

1903
01:38:25,137 --> 01:38:26,986
I would earn 700
for writing the script.

1904
01:38:26,987 --> 01:38:29,106
It would rise to a thousand
if the film is made.

1905
01:38:33,112 --> 01:38:34,353
For each route?

1906
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,306
I feel like the queen.

1907
01:38:41,887 --> 01:38:44,925
I don't envy you
if you need to wear these corsets.

1908
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:51,931
- This is absurd.
- Cheer up.

1909
01:38:51,932 --> 01:38:54,689
After all, you must be
used to the costume.

1910
01:38:55,595 --> 01:38:57,329
We put the names in the places,

1911
01:38:57,330 --> 01:38:59,826
so, please,
find your chair and sit down.

1912
01:38:59,827 --> 01:39:03,076
Mr. Carson, you will play
Lord Pumphrey,

1913
01:39:03,077 --> 01:39:04,710
at the end of the table.

1914
01:39:04,711 --> 01:39:07,126
It feels strange
to be sitting here.

1915
01:39:07,127 --> 01:39:09,165
You have spent too much time standing.

1916
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,404
I would say that you
spent enough time.

1917
01:39:14,405 --> 01:39:16,546
You may be right,
Mr. Dexter.

1918
01:39:16,547 --> 01:39:20,471
Tell me, does your offer mean
what I think it means?

1919
01:39:20,935 --> 01:39:23,560
It can mean
whatever you want.

1920
01:39:24,528 --> 01:39:26,318
I would like
that it meant a lot.

1921
01:39:27,271 --> 01:39:28,497
Then you are in luck.

1922
01:39:37,223 --> 01:39:39,809
- Mrs. Hughes.
- Thank you.

1923
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:44,192
You are here.

1924
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:46,263
I don't even recognize you.

1925
01:39:47,033 --> 01:39:48,033
E...

1926
01:39:50,435 --> 01:39:51,732
No, not really.

1927
01:39:51,733 --> 01:39:53,232
Please, we are not here.

1928
01:39:53,233 --> 01:39:55,905
My Lord, if you could go
behind the camera.

1929
01:39:57,619 --> 01:39:58,619
Thank you.

1930
01:40:05,909 --> 01:40:08,565
I look like something
to scare crows.

1931
01:40:08,566 --> 01:40:11,698
Nonsense. You are
the image of elegance.

1932
01:40:11,699 --> 01:40:14,660
Now, sit down here
and have something to warm you up.

1933
01:40:15,582 --> 01:40:17,699
I thought it was
just colored water.

1934
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:19,530
For others it really is.

1935
01:40:19,870 --> 01:40:22,830
To us,
I smuggled in something cool.

1936
01:40:23,656 --> 01:40:26,265
You are right. This is good.

1937
01:40:27,611 --> 01:40:30,061
Doesn't the young couple
look good together?

1938
01:40:30,062 --> 01:40:32,452
It must be wonderful to feel
that you are helping.

1939
01:40:32,851 --> 01:40:34,429
I would like to do more.

1940
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:36,624
Well, that's what
that I want to talk to you about.

1941
01:40:45,967 --> 01:40:47,810
Aren't you nervous?

1942
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:50,052
How a man should feel

1943
01:40:50,053 --> 01:40:53,063
when all your dreams
come true?

1944
01:40:53,064 --> 01:40:54,736
All your dreams?

1945
01:40:55,074 --> 01:40:56,175
I know,

1946
01:40:56,957 --> 01:40:58,925
- but you see, Miss Baxter...
- Phyllis.

1947
01:41:00,042 --> 01:41:01,042
Phyllis.

1948
01:41:02,097 --> 01:41:03,448
I felt ashamed.

1949
01:41:03,844 --> 01:41:05,195
The best I could offer

1950
01:41:05,196 --> 01:41:08,008
it was a poor life
on a teacher's salary.

1951
01:41:08,009 --> 01:41:09,391
I would have accepted it.

1952
01:41:12,006 --> 01:41:13,654
But now, you won't have to.

1953
01:41:14,584 --> 01:41:17,609
I will write plays
to be made into movies.

1954
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:18,982
For Mr. Barber?

1955
01:41:18,983 --> 01:41:22,259
For him now, but who knows
what will happen if I do well.

1956
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:24,607
<i>It's going to be talking movies
from now on.</i>

1957
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,507
What is this drug?

1958
01:41:29,942 --> 01:41:31,216
<i>For the first time,</i>

1959
01:41:31,217 --> 01:41:34,271
I can offer
a decent and prosperous life.

1960
01:41:35,666 --> 01:41:36,981
For both of us.

1961
01:41:38,093 --> 01:41:39,284
<i>So, what do you say?</i>

1962
01:41:42,573 --> 01:41:44,066
Won't you kneel down?

1963
01:41:48,143 --> 01:41:50,658
- Do you want me to kneel?
- I think so.

1964
01:41:51,106 --> 01:41:52,658
It won't happen again.

1965
01:41:54,813 --> 01:41:56,268
Okay, so...

1966
01:41:59,351 --> 01:42:01,880
You want to marry me,
Miss Baxter?

1967
01:42:01,881 --> 01:42:04,226
I mean, Phyllis?

1968
01:42:07,017 --> 01:42:08,017
<i>Yes.</i>

1969
01:42:08,357 --> 01:42:11,235
I accept very happily,
Mr. Molesley.

1970
01:42:21,229 --> 01:42:23,182
Congratulations, dear.

1971
01:42:23,183 --> 01:42:25,393
Very good, Mr. Molesley.

1972
01:42:25,394 --> 01:42:27,776
Very good, Mr. Molesley.

1973
01:42:29,601 --> 01:42:32,251
Please calm down.
Let's go to the first take.

1974
01:42:32,252 --> 01:42:33,359
Say that again.

1975
01:42:33,897 --> 01:42:35,678
Barkis is willing.

1976
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:37,261
Mr. Mason.

1977
01:42:37,776 --> 01:42:40,357
And you will be content
to live in my little house?

1978
01:42:40,358 --> 01:42:42,028
Unless you think it is wrong.

1979
01:42:42,029 --> 01:42:44,249
I certainly don't think so.

1980
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:46,260
The younger ones
can keep the farm.

1981
01:42:46,261 --> 01:42:47,852
I will turn in the lease.

1982
01:42:47,853 --> 01:42:49,718
Well, I'll drink to that.

1983
01:42:50,854 --> 01:42:52,818
- Okay, and if we can...
- Remember!

1984
01:42:52,819 --> 01:42:56,930
Clarity, diction
and keep your head still.

1985
01:42:56,931 --> 01:42:58,205
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1986
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,197
Prepare the camera.

1987
01:43:01,431 --> 01:43:03,002
And action.

1988
01:43:06,837 --> 01:43:07,993
<i>Where are you going?</i>

1989
01:43:08,382 --> 01:43:09,579
<i>Back to London.</i>

1990
01:43:10,813 --> 01:43:12,729
What? You can't.

1991
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:14,360
I can and I must.

1992
01:43:14,361 --> 01:43:18,746
If I stay, dear Anne,
I will destroy you along with me.

1993
01:43:18,747 --> 01:43:19,877
Can't you see?

1994
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:24,275
- Let's fight together.
- No, we won't.

1995
01:43:24,276 --> 01:43:27,410
I am the useless one. I am the exile.
I am the lost soul.

1996
01:43:27,411 --> 01:43:28,598
Now, let me go!

1997
01:43:35,823 --> 01:43:37,769
Bill, please wait.

1998
01:43:38,721 --> 01:43:40,150
He broke her heart.

1999
01:43:40,151 --> 01:43:41,331
Chap is a cheapskate.

2000
01:43:41,332 --> 01:43:42,472
And cut.

2001
01:43:49,602 --> 01:43:50,718
Bravo.

2002
01:43:54,573 --> 01:43:55,815
Bravo.

2003
01:44:00,024 --> 01:44:02,157
The buffet in the lounge is ready,
milady.

2004
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:03,320
Thank you, Barrow.

2005
01:44:05,507 --> 01:44:07,811
Milady, could I speak with you?

2006
01:44:08,787 --> 01:44:09,842
Of course.

2007
01:44:10,605 --> 01:44:12,471
I would like to hand in
my notice.

2008
01:44:15,088 --> 01:44:17,601
I know that you
have not always been happy here.

2009
01:44:17,602 --> 01:44:20,705
It is not that, milady.
I had good years at Downton.

2010
01:44:21,259 --> 01:44:22,891
But I formed a kind of...

2011
01:44:22,892 --> 01:44:25,162
I'm not sure what it is,
really.

2012
01:44:25,163 --> 01:44:27,648
A working friendship
with Mr. Dexter.

2013
01:44:28,305 --> 01:44:30,170
- With Guy?
- That's right, milady.

2014
01:44:30,171 --> 01:44:31,841
And we intend to travel together.

2015
01:44:31,842 --> 01:44:33,803
He will make movies
and I will take care of him.

2016
01:44:34,335 --> 01:44:37,803
I'm going to be his agent,
as the movie people say.

2017
01:44:37,804 --> 01:44:39,224
And if I am right...

2018
01:44:40,646 --> 01:44:43,097
is the closest I have come

2019
01:44:43,098 --> 01:44:44,974
the offer
of an honest way of life.

2020
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:49,598
No need to explain, Barrow.

2021
01:44:49,599 --> 01:44:51,006
I wish you all the best.

2022
01:44:51,526 --> 01:44:54,702
And I hope you will be as happy
as our cruel world leaves you.

2023
01:44:55,821 --> 01:44:57,424
Thank you, milady.

2024
01:45:08,698 --> 01:45:09,698
So what?

2025
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:12,209
It is done.

2026
01:45:13,832 --> 01:45:14,867
Great.

2027
01:45:19,315 --> 01:45:21,829
I want to know if you will miss
your acting career.

2028
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:24,385
Say yes. Come to London
and we'll give you a part.

2029
01:45:24,386 --> 01:45:27,057
No, thank you.
I liked it, really,

2030
01:45:27,058 --> 01:45:28,694
but once is enough.

2031
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:31,143
I can help you,
Miss Dalgleish?

2032
01:45:31,838 --> 01:45:33,922
I would love
some of this ham,

2033
01:45:33,923 --> 01:45:36,619
if you can reach it.
And a little sauce.

2034
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:40,427
What happened to your voice?

2035
01:45:40,428 --> 01:45:42,878
- What do you mean?
- You missed the horrible...

2036
01:45:46,252 --> 01:45:48,494
Of course, I didn't mean "horrible" exactly.
exactly.

2037
01:45:48,495 --> 01:45:50,173
She is a born talent.

2038
01:45:50,174 --> 01:45:52,667
Lady Grantham
do you think I can go to Hollywood

2039
01:45:52,668 --> 01:45:54,313
and be an American.

2040
01:45:54,774 --> 01:45:56,004
Why don't you go?

2041
01:45:56,429 --> 01:45:57,651
Agree with me, Bertie.

2042
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:02,618
Will you excuse me?
I just want to go downstairs.

2043
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:04,189
Thank you.

2044
01:46:05,869 --> 01:46:07,816
Why is she so cool?
all of a sudden?

2045
01:46:07,817 --> 01:46:09,673
It is simple.
She is no longer afraid.

2046
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:14,610
Do you know that I am
completely crazy about you?

2047
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:16,829
Dear Mr. Barber

2048
01:46:17,749 --> 01:46:19,576
I can't give you
what you want.

2049
01:46:20,555 --> 01:46:23,627
But I can say that I loved
working with you.

2050
01:46:25,013 --> 01:46:26,643
And I should be content with that.

2051
01:46:27,004 --> 01:46:28,385
That's all you're going to get.

2052
01:46:29,802 --> 01:46:33,139
I am happy as my father's son
because I loved him.

2053
01:46:33,628 --> 01:46:36,700
It matters more to me
than all dynastic things.

2054
01:46:36,701 --> 01:46:38,214
It should be just like that.

2055
01:46:38,215 --> 01:46:41,457
I am happy for Sybbie,
as long as she learns to give back.

2056
01:46:41,458 --> 01:46:43,145
Don't believe in the idle rich?

2057
01:46:43,146 --> 01:46:44,173
I believe in them.

2058
01:46:44,174 --> 01:46:46,316
I just don't want
my family to be one.

2059
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:47,711
That sounds good to me.

2060
01:46:48,279 --> 01:46:49,488
I'll have another cup.

2061
01:46:49,489 --> 01:46:50,575
Excuse me.

2062
01:46:55,739 --> 01:46:58,283
Does this include any future members
of your family?

2063
01:46:58,284 --> 01:46:59,896
Yes, of course, because...

2064
01:47:04,174 --> 01:47:06,533
It's early,
so don't say anything yet.

2065
01:47:06,534 --> 01:47:08,774
My dear,
I won't say anything.

2066
01:47:08,775 --> 01:47:10,578
But I think I can kiss you.

2067
01:47:13,125 --> 01:47:15,232
Dr. Clarkson has arrived, my lord.

2068
01:47:17,215 --> 01:47:20,306
I notice that you are very friendly
with the handsome Mr. Barber.

2069
01:47:20,307 --> 01:47:21,699
Don't start.

2070
01:47:22,182 --> 01:47:24,752
I stayed out of trouble
and I've been good.

2071
01:47:25,642 --> 01:47:27,817
With some difficulties,
I must add.

2072
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:30,726
It is not what you were afraid of.

2073
01:47:30,727 --> 01:47:34,367
Pernicious anemia is often confused
confused with cancer.

2074
01:47:34,368 --> 01:47:38,071
And even a few years ago
it could have ended with you.

2075
01:47:38,072 --> 01:47:39,881
But now there is treatment.

2076
01:47:39,882 --> 01:47:41,279
Thank God.

2077
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,005
It will not be
particularly pleasant,

2078
01:47:43,006 --> 01:47:45,464
but you will get better
and you won't die.

2079
01:47:46,302 --> 01:47:48,036
Well, thank you, Dr. Clarkson.

2080
01:47:49,512 --> 01:47:51,432
Thank you very, very, very much.

2081
01:47:51,433 --> 01:47:52,774
Yes, thank you.

2082
01:47:53,379 --> 01:47:55,405
Now, you must come in
for dinner.

2083
01:47:55,406 --> 01:47:57,627
But it will be every man for himself
that night.

2084
01:47:57,628 --> 01:47:59,772
All created
are movie stars now.

2085
01:47:59,773 --> 01:48:01,945
We will never bring them
through the servants' wing.

2086
01:48:01,946 --> 01:48:03,038
<i>Milorde!</i>

2087
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:07,368
Milady! Come quickly!
Please hurry!

2088
01:48:07,369 --> 01:48:08,500
Doctor.

2089
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:12,751
Speak again.
Speak in that voice.

2090
01:48:13,524 --> 01:48:16,796
I just want to say
how grateful I am.

2091
01:48:16,797 --> 01:48:19,602
You both helped me
when I needed it.

2092
01:48:20,087 --> 01:48:22,701
- Thank you.
- Are you going to Hollywood now?

2093
01:48:22,702 --> 01:48:25,110
Why not? I have no family
holding me here.

2094
01:48:25,111 --> 01:48:29,055
And I've made a talking movie now,
which puts me in the forefront.

2095
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:31,848
Just don't forget who you are
and not even where you came from.

2096
01:48:31,849 --> 01:48:34,081
But also don't let
let it stop you either.

2097
01:48:34,082 --> 01:48:35,349
And good luck.

2098
01:48:37,241 --> 01:48:38,263
Come here.

2099
01:48:43,864 --> 01:48:46,237
Old Lady Grantham
is sinking very fast.

2100
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:47,979
They are up there with her now.

2101
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:51,246
Grab a coffee or something stronger
just in case.

2102
01:48:56,514 --> 01:48:58,779
Charlie, are you okay?

2103
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,795
What did King Lear say?

2104
01:49:01,889 --> 01:49:05,006
"Winds, blow away
the very cheeks!

2105
01:49:05,357 --> 01:49:09,991
Rage, blow hard!
Trumpets and cataracts."

2106
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:16,160
The moment of her departure
finally arrived?

2107
01:49:20,036 --> 01:49:24,012
That such a great lady
must depart

2108
01:49:24,747 --> 01:49:27,973
when the house is full
of moviegoers.

2109
01:49:39,824 --> 01:49:40,824
Maud.

2110
01:49:41,917 --> 01:49:44,393
What are you doing here?

2111
01:49:45,197 --> 01:49:47,296
You won't believe me,

2112
01:49:48,124 --> 01:49:49,421
but I will miss you.

2113
01:49:49,422 --> 01:49:52,133
Or did you come just to check
if I've already gone?

2114
01:49:53,455 --> 01:49:54,814
Do you want something?

2115
01:49:56,697 --> 01:50:00,556
Whatever I wanted,
sweet boy,

2116
01:50:01,423 --> 01:50:06,391
you gave me long before
and over and over again.

2117
01:50:06,804 --> 01:50:11,084
Dear Mama, I hope I have not been
have been a disappointment.

2118
01:50:12,088 --> 01:50:14,245
You have always been smarter
than me.

2119
01:50:14,246 --> 01:50:15,251
True.

2120
01:50:16,378 --> 01:50:18,714
But don't let this
come between us now.

2121
01:50:19,307 --> 01:50:24,305
You are much kinder
than I ever was.

2122
01:50:26,096 --> 01:50:29,583
Cora, I owe you an apology.

2123
01:50:30,183 --> 01:50:32,842
I didn't think you would last.

2124
01:50:32,843 --> 01:50:33,921
I know.

2125
01:50:34,278 --> 01:50:36,871
But I was wrong.

2126
01:50:37,652 --> 01:50:41,845
This is something that you
have never heard me say before.

2127
01:50:41,846 --> 01:50:43,515
It was worth the wait.

2128
01:50:44,810 --> 01:50:48,006
Mary, dear, and Edith.

2129
01:50:49,228 --> 01:50:52,148
You were wonderful granddaughters.

2130
01:50:52,149 --> 01:50:56,505
And I leave you two,
confident that your lives

2131
01:50:56,506 --> 01:50:59,290
will be happy and fruitful.

2132
01:50:59,291 --> 01:51:00,500
Grandma.

2133
01:51:00,861 --> 01:51:02,224
Dear Grandma.

2134
01:51:03,036 --> 01:51:04,666
Well, that should be enough,

2135
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:07,744
or will I be like one
of those guests

2136
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:11,297
who put their bags in the car
and never leave.

2137
01:51:13,092 --> 01:51:14,325
Milady.

2138
01:51:14,609 --> 01:51:16,420
Stop that noise.

2139
01:51:16,929 --> 01:51:19,313
I can't hear myself die.

2140
01:53:01,223 --> 01:53:03,075
Take that too.

2141
01:54:26,583 --> 01:54:27,793
Thank you, Bates.

2142
01:54:31,588 --> 01:54:33,414
Strange day
for you and for me.

2143
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:36,129
We are orphans at last.

2144
01:54:39,631 --> 01:54:41,253
- Good Morning.
- Good morning.

2145
01:54:47,005 --> 01:54:48,041
Milady.

2146
01:54:53,127 --> 01:54:54,989
She would be so happy
with you here.

2147
01:54:55,693 --> 01:54:58,775
I remember the first time
I really saw you, milady.

2148
01:54:59,384 --> 01:55:01,004
Up close, I mean.

2149
01:55:01,598 --> 01:55:03,932
I had just been
promoted

2150
01:55:03,933 --> 01:55:05,241
and was in the dining room

2151
01:55:05,242 --> 01:55:08,525
with the old butler,
Mr. Mountjoy.

2152
01:55:08,526 --> 01:55:10,282
I was terrified of him.

2153
01:55:10,791 --> 01:55:12,910
But then
she came towards us.

2154
01:55:12,911 --> 01:55:15,246
She was angry
at something.

2155
01:55:15,997 --> 01:55:17,893
And I could see him trembling.

2156
01:55:18,727 --> 01:55:20,216
I never forgot that.

2157
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:23,271
And never again
was I ever afraid of him again.

2158
01:55:23,667 --> 01:55:25,374
You belong to our history.

2159
01:55:25,504 --> 01:55:28,678
In fact, I wonder
if your part is already over.

2160
01:55:29,753 --> 01:55:31,981
Would you consider coming back?

2161
01:55:32,506 --> 01:55:34,502
For a little while longer.

2162
01:55:34,733 --> 01:55:35,799
Milady?

2163
01:55:36,055 --> 01:55:37,443
Barrow is leaving.

2164
01:55:37,444 --> 01:55:39,922
And I cannot train
a new butler by myself.

2165
01:55:40,327 --> 01:55:42,291
Andrew could be
his right-hand man

2166
01:55:42,292 --> 01:55:44,246
while you train him
to succeed you.

2167
01:55:44,247 --> 01:55:45,982
Do you think he could handle it?

2168
01:55:45,983 --> 01:55:47,228
Well, certainly.

2169
01:55:47,833 --> 01:55:49,292
In time.

2170
01:55:51,713 --> 01:55:53,700
His Lordship's brooch.

2171
01:55:54,227 --> 01:55:57,531
So now, the torch
of Downton has passed to you.

2172
01:55:58,633 --> 01:55:59,992
For my father.

2173
01:56:00,676 --> 01:56:04,275
But if I'm going to carry it too,
I will try to do it with pride.

2174
01:56:07,564 --> 01:56:09,982
I cannot pretend that I am not
scared.

2175
01:56:10,108 --> 01:56:12,070
You don't have to be.

2176
01:56:12,206 --> 01:56:14,138
You have the strength.

2177
01:56:14,139 --> 01:56:15,141
Do I?

2178
01:56:15,142 --> 01:56:16,661
Sometimes I have doubts.

2179
01:56:17,943 --> 01:56:19,834
Well, I don't.

2180
01:56:20,209 --> 01:56:22,033
Not for a moment.

2181
01:56:22,436 --> 01:56:25,624
And you can always count on me,
if it means anything.

2182
01:56:26,186 --> 01:56:27,669
It means a lot.

2183
01:56:31,096 --> 01:56:32,615
And I think you know.

2184
01:56:35,062 --> 01:56:37,222
Now I just need some time
before we go.

2185
01:56:38,944 --> 01:56:39,950
Milady.

2186
01:56:58,811 --> 01:57:00,383
What did she have to say?

2187
01:57:01,337 --> 01:57:03,670
She wants me back home.

2188
01:57:03,671 --> 01:57:05,011
As a butler.

2189
01:57:05,309 --> 01:57:06,863
Does she really want to?

2190
01:57:10,515 --> 01:57:11,694
We have to go.

2191
01:57:11,695 --> 01:57:13,647
Thank you for organizing this.

2192
01:57:13,838 --> 01:57:16,661
She left the instructions
in minute detail.

2193
01:57:16,662 --> 01:57:17,823
I can imagine.

2194
01:57:17,824 --> 01:57:19,668
You will bury me one day,

2195
01:57:19,669 --> 01:57:21,624
and I am happy to see
that it will be well done.

2196
01:57:22,263 --> 01:57:25,103
I suppose the point is,
Crawleys come and go,

2197
01:57:25,104 --> 01:57:26,615
but the family continues.

2198
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:29,250
Mom knew this
and believed it.

2199
01:57:29,251 --> 01:57:30,466
Not only her.

2200
01:58:33,485 --> 01:58:36,212
Let's go inside.

2201
01:59:44,936 --> 01:59:48,279
Here they are.

2202
01:59:50,666 --> 01:59:51,875
Andy.

2203
01:59:51,876 --> 01:59:53,568
Lovely.

2204
01:59:54,805 --> 01:59:55,911
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2205
01:59:55,912 --> 01:59:57,224
How beautiful.

2206
02:00:00,331 --> 02:00:03,437
- Are you tired?
- Sybbie, how are you?

2207
02:00:08,062 --> 02:00:09,926
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2208
02:00:14,002 --> 02:00:15,708
What a beautiful baby.

2209
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:17,222
He is very handsome.

2210
02:00:17,223 --> 02:00:18,907
Look, Mary.

2211
02:00:18,908 --> 02:00:21,024
Hello.
