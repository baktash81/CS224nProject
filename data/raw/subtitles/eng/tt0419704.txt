1
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,543
In a village in the region of La Mancha,

2
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:25,962
whose name I don't
care to remember,

3
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,880
there lived not so long ago

4
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,591
one of those gentlemen
who keep a lance in the rack,

5
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:35,054
an old shield, a lean horse,
and a swift hound...

6
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,931
gaunt and wizened,

7
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:39,517
an early riser and a lover
of the hunt.

8
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:43,062
They say his name was
Don Quixote de la Mancha,

9
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:46,649
who spent his days reading
books of knight errantry,

10
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,027
which he loved
and enjoyed so much

11
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,280
that he completely lost it.

12
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:54,115
Now, all the fantasies
in those books

13
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:55,158
became such an obsession

14
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,452
that he thought of
nothing else

15
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:59,537
but duels, enchantments,

16
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,248
battles,
and impossible love,

17
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,125
until the day came

18
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:07,628
when he had the most extravagant
notion of all:

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,214
to call himself a knight errant

20
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,925
and go in search of
grand adventures,

21
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,512
just like all
the heroes in his books.

22
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,931
But Don Quixote needed a squire,

23
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,268
so he decided to work on
a neighboring farmer,

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,145
and although it wasn't easy,

25
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:26,689
he persisted
and promised so much

26
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:27,940
that in the end,

27
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,611
poor Sancho,
for that was his name,

28
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:33,237
agreed to go with him,

29
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,948
leaving behind his wife,
his land,

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,451
and all his possessions.

31
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:41,412
Now all he lacked in his
search for eternity

32
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,164
was a lady to
fall in love with

33
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,124
and yearn for.

34
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,294
You see, a knight errant
without love

35
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:51,130
is a knight
without a soul.

36
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,674
He suddenly recalled

37
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,343
a farm girl from
a nearby village.

38
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:58,262
Although he didn't actually
know her,

39
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,306
he'd been in love from afar,

40
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,435
and so was inspired to create
the damsel of his dreams.

41
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:05,978
And although that
lady never existed,

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,025
she would always be for him
his Dulcinea.

43
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,194
Dulcinea Del Toboso.

44
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,029
Not again, I'm fed up with this !

45
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,198
Who cares, anyhow ?

46
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,617
It's always
the same old yarn.

47
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:20,910
What are you saying ?

48
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,662
I mean, the book says
very clearly that--

49
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:24,247
Why should I bother
with some old book

50
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,290
when I was there
to see it for myself ?

51
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,544
You mean, you're Rucio,
Sancho's donkey ?

52
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,713
Hold it right there !

53
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,674
The only talking donkey
I know

54
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,219
is a friend of mine who
hangs out with some green ogre.

55
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,554
I'm a horse.

56
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:42,390
And it's about time
the world knew the truth.

57
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:43,015
The truth ?

58
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,352
What truth ?

59
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,028
It all began quite
some time ago,

60
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,364
after we got back
from that first adventure--

61
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:01,242
Quixote, Sancho, Rocinante,
and yours truly.

62

So where do you think
you're going, donkey ?

68
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,517
This road is for
horses only.

69
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:30,146
So what's this pig
doing here then ?

70
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,647
Are you blind ?

71
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,567
Can't you see what
a wonderful steed he is ?

72
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:36,486
I wasn't talking to you.

73
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,298
One day
I'll be a great horse,

74
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,509
and I'll do all kinds of
important stuff.

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,093
You'll see.

76
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:05,181
Just remember, you'll have to
pass the pony exams first.

77
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,058
Whoa, I'm afraid he'll have
a tough time at the practical.

78
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,899

right, left, right, left--

91
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,759
Squad ! Positions !

92
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,691
I don't believe it.

93
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:58,025
Yes !

94
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,703
Three in a line.

95
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:16,043
And what exactly do you think
you're doing, James ?

96
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,295
It's perfect !

97
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,171
A hurricane wouldn't even
knock this lot down.

98
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:29,640
You're safe, I got ya.

99
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,309
Off, James.

100
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,643
Now !

101
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:35,813
Everything's under control.

102
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,732
You won't believe this,
Rocinante, it's incredible !

103
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,275
No screaming in the barn !

104
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:40,276
But--
No excuses in the barn !

105
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,695
Stop !

106
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,280
Hey, you-- you...
don't take another step !

107
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,699
What do you want?

108
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,576
We're not even meant to be
talking to each other.

109
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:50,286
Our masters might not
be speaking,

110
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,829
but you and I are horses-- Negative.

111
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,290
He's already made it clear,
he doesn't want to talk.

112
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,709
Look, buddy, when I was
working as a bodyguard

113
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,502
for Babieca, El Cid's horse,
we were right in the middle of

114
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,880
shooting a big scene
in Valencia--

115
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,632
Besides, it was greedy
Sancho's fault.

116
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,842
No, it was Quixote's fault,

117
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,219
and his absurd obsession
with chivalry and love,

118
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,262
which don't even exist.

119
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,473
Don't exist for you, maybe.

120
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,184
Horses like you turn their
life into a big, fat lie.

121
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,810
Look at yourself
here in this old barn,

122
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,647
a sad and ridiculous officer
with a handful of hens

123
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,857
and some little
squirt as a bodyguard ?

124
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,526
What are you gonna invade ?
The drinking trough ?

125
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,283
Rocinante,
you've become a coward.

126
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,036
Now you've
gone too far, pal.

127
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:43,339
We have to stop Quixote
from seeing this !

128
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,633
Stop him ?

129
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,009
But this is our
chance to get

130
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,886
some dignity
back in our lives,

131
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,262
make our dreams come true.

132
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,681
Your dreams, you mean.

133
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,766
But then you're just
the same as Quixote, a--

134
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,393
Say it, Why don't you ?

135
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:57,645
A fool !

136
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,444
Losers.

137
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,990
One word from you,
and he's mincemeat.

138
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,910
Don't you even
think about it!

139
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,792
Give that back !

140
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,713
This is really important !

141
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,049
Very, very important.

142
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,510
There's an end to
your dreams.

143
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,016
That Quixote lives in our house,

144
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,393
you haven't spoken in months,

145
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,687
and now, all of a sudden,
you've got to talk ?

146
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,021
Well, just make
sure you remind him

147
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,023
to pay the rent--
that's all !

148
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,734
This time it's different.

149
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:45,359
We're meeting at Bachelor
Carrasco's place--

150
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,486
mutual territory.

151
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,697
Who knows what trouble
he'll get you into now.

152
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,323
Oh, please !

153
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,534
What do you think you're doing
dressed like that, Sancho ?

154
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,453
This is a
Calf Klein occasion.

155
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,913
And what's
wrong with this ?

156
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,999
Ten years and still
like new.

157
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,542
Fits like a glove, too.

158
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,379
Hey, my friend.

159
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,839
Where would we be
without you ?

160
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:10,342
And you're not riding
that broken-down donkey !

161
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,887
Take the new horse.

162
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:15,055
Just her way of showing
affection.

163
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,431
My dear Sancho,
come in !

164
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,475
We were waiting for you.

165
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,601
Where's Quixote, then ?

166
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,062
Sancho.

167
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:48,774
Let's get this over with.

168
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,234
I've got the donkey
double-parked.

169
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,236
Gentlemen...

170
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,197
we have known one another
since childhood.

171
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,575
You, Quixote,
are the most famous

172
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,493
and cultivated in
the village.

173
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:00,744
After you, Bachelor.

174
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,456
And you, Sancho, wealthy
and respectable man.

175
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,709
You followed
him for a dream,

176
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,502
but it all went sour,
didn't it ?

177
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,462
He said I'd get to be

178
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:11,672
governor of an island
if I went with him.

179
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,841
Yeah, but we didn't
find Dulcinea.

180
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,676
You saw her,
but I didn't.

181
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,386
Because you
left me alone.

182
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,764
As you can see, there have
been quite a few letters

183
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,475
concerning that
book about you two.

184
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,477
You've even got
a fan club,

185
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,062
which isn't bad,

186
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,232
especially when you consider
that I, for example,

187
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,484
haven't had
a letter in years.

188
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,158
And on top of it all,

189
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,745
they flooded the region
with these pamphlets.

190
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,706
"I, Knight Of
The Crescent Moon,

191
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,207
"having learned
of the adventures

192
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,709
"of the knight errant
Don Quixote,

193
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,796
"do challenge him to a duel
in Barcelona this full moon.

194
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,093
"If I should win, Quixote
will hand over his arms

195
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,847
"and renounce
Dulcinea forever.

196
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,515
"But if Quixote be
the winner,

197
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,060
"I promise to reveal

198
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,646
"the true identity
of Dulcinea,

199
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:12,983
and will give her all my
treasures and possessions."

200
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,777
So what's all this
gotta do with me ?

201
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,028
You ?

202
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,990
My dear Sancho,
do I have to remind you

203
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,034
that you were the one
who went off with him

204
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:25,871
to resurrect this
whole chivalry thing ?

205
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,665
And now you are Quixote
and Sancho,

206
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:30,000
Sancho and Quixote--

207
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,962
an indivisible symbol of
this beautiful village,

208
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,715
its main heritage,
the pride of La Mancha !

209
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,510
You are everything !

210
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,303
And your point is ?

211
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:45,683
The truth is, Quixote
asked me to intercede.

212
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:48,811
Just shake hands,
can't you ?

213
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,689
Go along with him
on this new adventure.

214
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:54,858
Help him as I do,

215
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,695
for the sake
of friendship.

216
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:00,280
Well, he can forget about
Barcelona, for a start.

217
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,283
I cannot, in truth,
forget about Barcelona,

218
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,996
if that is where I shall find
the beautiful Dulcinea,

219
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,124
queen of my days
and princess of my nights.

220
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,834
For you, Quixote.

221
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,435
That old pile of junk ?

222
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,270
Extraordinary !

223
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,105
Ah, looks like
Teresa's girdle.

224
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:36,233
If I'm not mistaken,
this magnificent gem

225
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,944
is nothing less
than Esplandiana--

226
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,113
the armor of the mythical
knight Esplandian.

227
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,991
You seem to know
everything, Quixote.

228
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,117
Everything is in the books.

229
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,871
Please,
take this as a small sign

230
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,664
of Bachelor Carrasco's
commitment

231
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,208
to our beloved Quixote.

232
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,461
What about me, huh ?

233
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,299
Nothing !
For me, nothing !

234
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,011
Hmm...

235
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,313
Hmm.

236
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,953
Hah.

237
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,625
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

238
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,210
GiddyaP-

239
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:38,879
Oh, no.

240
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,966
Hah !

241
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,100
Hi-yah !

242
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,694
Oh, this is absurd.

243
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:03,862
We can't go on
like this.

244
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,197
Pay me and we're even.

245
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,657
But of course I will--
Yeah, right.

246
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,117
Just as soon as we
get back from Barcelona.

247
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,993
Oh, not again, please !

248
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,829
I already said no back there,
didn't I ?

249
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:12,913
I mean, what do you want?

250
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:13,956
Me to follow on another
mad escapade

251
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,125
just to get
dumped on again ?

252
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,044
Oh, but we'll show the world how
to live an exceptional life.

253
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,629
Forget it !

254
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:21,797
So that's a yes then ?

255
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,092
Look at them.

256
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,385
They're impatient
to be off.

257
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,428
Get out.

258
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,683
Between honor and money,
second is first.

259
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,434
Ooh, I'm with him.

260
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,979
Didn't I make
myself clear ?

261
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,314
Come on !
No !

262
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,067
My friend, a knight errant
is not one

263
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,320
who just does what
the world expects-- no.

264
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,116
He must live as his
heart dictates.

265
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,784
You forget I'm not
like you, Quixote.

266
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:51,910
I'm not a knight errant.

267
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:55,956
I'm just...
a simple man.

268
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,166
A swap !

269
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,126
Can I suggest
a straight swap ?

270
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,468
It was good to
see you again.

271
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,346
Yeah, good luck,
and have fun.

272
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,433
But I need you, Sancho !

273
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,477
You're the only one
who ever saw her.

274
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:22,274
Look, Quixote, I don't--

275
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,068
Okay, give me one good reason
why I should go.

276
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,111
Mmm, the treasure ?

277
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,946
Not bad, huh ?
That treasure--

278
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,406
How much are we
talking about?

279
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,491
I mean,
does it say anywhere ?

280
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,160
Well, then I need
another reason.

281
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,703
ls that you, sweetie ?

282
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,163
Just in time to help!

283
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,749
Hurry up, there's a lot to do today. Uh-oh.

284
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,001
Okay, sweetie.

285
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:41,960
But I get the treasure.

286
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,879
You can keep
the windmills.

287
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,007
Oh, no-- but who's gonna
take care of my chickens ?

288
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,555
Sancho... how should I put this ?

289
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,140
Have you got any
spare cash on you ?

290
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,934
Here we go again.

291
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,852
But what about me ?

292
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,146
Doesn't my opinion count for
anything around here ?

293
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,529
Sweetie ?

294
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,365
Are you there ?!

295
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,785
But if you don't want them to reach Barcelona,

296
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,788
why do you help them ?

297
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,290
To play to the gallery,
of course !

298
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:21,959
If I want to be famous,

299
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,544
I have to start
with my own village.

300
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,463
Here, everyone worships
Quixote,

301
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,924
and they will
believe I supported him.

302
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,550
And now ?

303
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,844
We have to stop them getting
to Barcelona at all costs.

304
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,931
I want to
humiliate them !

305
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,266
To get rid of them,

306
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,185
have their fame vanish
forever !

307
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:44,022
Quixote is already
wearing the first trap.

308
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:48,110
That armor is as dangerous
as his damn madness.

309
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,445
And now I'll
hire the services

310
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,823
of Sinister Knight,

311
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,992
and you will help execute
my foolproof plan.

312
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,036
Is that clear, Avellaneda ?

313
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:02,165
But does Sinister
really exist, then ?

314
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,810
Ooh.

315
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,562
My little chickens.

316
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,946
No, no, I said no !

317
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,781
I'm not going--

318
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,177
Um, excuse me !

319
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,055
Excuse me,
would you like to be an

320
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,515
authentic knight errant ?

321
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,601
Build your own armor
in easy installments.

322
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,688
Windmill or giant?

323
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,606
Check for yourselves
with today's special offer.

324
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,317
For sure it is--
Horrible.

325
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,610
Magnificent !

326
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,447
Or buy here, your own
copy of "Don Quixote."

327
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,323
So that of the book
was true.

328
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:41,199
You absolutely
have to own a copy

329
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,452
and pretend to have read it

330
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,078
if you want to be
anyone around here.

331
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,080
A bargain, 10 eurocrowns.

332
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:48,498
But I am Don Quixote.

333
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,710
Of course you are--
they all are.

334
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,258
8 eurocrowns ?

335
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,676
What are they
doing here ?

336
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:00,552
Paying to see
the fair Dulcinea

337
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,762
before the duel,
of course.

338
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,014
5 eurocrowns ?

339
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,017
Can this be possible ?

340
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,268
So who's written it ?

341
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,020
Miguel de Cervantes.

342
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:13,732
There's this great bit about
how Sancho found Dulcinea--

343
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,692
Okay, okay, I'll take it,
but tear out those pages

344
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,444
about Sancho and Dulcinea.

345
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,738
Is this-- by the sacred
laws of chivalry--

346
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,324
home to
the peerless Dulcinea ?

347
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,659
Hey, I don't need it
autographed.

348
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,619
You don't think
I'd sell the original

349
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,787
for 20 eurocrowns,
do you ?

350
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,247
But we said 5.

351
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,291
That was before I knew
it was an adaptation.

352
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,542
What's all this about
a book, then ?

353
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,086
What's not in books,
life will teach you.

354
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,631
I must pay my respects
to my true love !

355
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,021
Hey, you,
get in line.

356
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,941
I am Don Quixote
de la Mancha.

357
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,275
My beloved--

358
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,110
Get in line!

359
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,156
Hmm.

360
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,325
Relax, Sancho,
as soon as they see us,

361
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,953
they'll send
these impostors packing.

362
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,309
Invitation ?
Membership card ?

363
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,894
But--
Out !

364
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:39,693
No sneakers.

365
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,903
Next !

366
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,573
Noble guardian of the virtue
of the peerless Dulcinea--

367
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,160
please announce
the arrival of Don Quixote.

368
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,497
Let him in.

369
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,673
No, no, he's Quixote.

370
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,466
Actually, my squire,
here present,

371
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:07,178
and Dulcinea are
already acquainted.

372
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,638
Hmm.

373
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,557
A great honor.

374
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:11,308
100 eurocrowns.

375
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,310
Just to see her ?

376
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,437
Per person.

377
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,272
Discounts only for babies,
pensioners

378
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,274
and veterans of
the Battle of Lepanto.

379
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,901
Hmm ?
Hmm.

380
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,160
You !

381
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,329
And the other gentleman ?

382
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,789
I'll see her
in Barcelona.

383
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:35,915
Everything's free there.

384
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,334
But how will I know
it's truly her

385
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:40,045
without you by my side ?

386
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,214
Nice doing business
with you gentleman.

387
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:44,507
This way.

388
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,802
Hurry along now,
and no pushing.

389
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,272
If it's her,
just give me a sign.

390
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:04,903
ls it really you,
beautiful lady ?

391
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,863
Move back.

392
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:09,741
Well ?

393
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,826
How...
should I know ?

394
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,495
I can't see her face.

395
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,498
Move back to the line,
Pendejo.

396
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,420
Are you crazy ?

397
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,674
Well, technically, yeah.

398
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:26,424
Could you possibly draw
that curtain back

399
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,510
a little, my friend ?

400
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,595
I wait to count to five.

401
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,555
One... two--

402
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,266
You dare challenge me !

403
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:35,725
Three, four, <i>cinco</i> !

404
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,524
They're in trouble,
we've got to help !

405
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:43,400
No way, I can't
stand violence.

406
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,860
Coward.

407
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:50,990
So I guess this is where we
all get beaten to a pulp.

408
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,956
What's wrong with
that piece of junk ?

409
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,625
Well, according
to the legend...

410
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,586
the soul of
the Knight Esplandian

411
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,255
lives inside this armor.

412
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,841
Is there room in there
for the two of you ?

413
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,808
Allow me to express my sorrow
for all of this.

414
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,438
See how my heart
beats in torment.

415
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,607
My beloved one,
I always--

416
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,409
Perhaps you were going
a bit too fast for her.

417
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,411
Can I come in ?

418
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,081
They've kidnapped Dulcinea !

419
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,083
Sinister's forces
are at hand !

420
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,420
What have you done with our
little Dulcinea ?

421
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:46,796
No time to waste !

422
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,507
I must save my love.

423
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,513
Don't leave me here--

424
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:56,598
Ooh, whoops, ohh !

425
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,560
Confess !

426
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,312
Are you not at
Sinister's service ?

427
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,064
Uh-oh !

428
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,692
How dare you
claim such a thing ?

429
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,615
If I were you, I'd run !

430
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:24,667
I'm with you,
partner.

431
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,628
Let's get out of here.

432
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:36,429
That old piece of junk
gives me the willies.

433
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,557
Brother knights,
gentlemen,

434
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,768
who is Don Quixote ?

435
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:45,855
Oh, it's me !

436
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:49,734
And I say,
why be Don Quixote ?

437
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:53,863
Why not Lancelot, Percival,
Amadis,

438
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,365
King Arthur or
the Peers of France ?

439
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,700
Who are those ?

440
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,536
What kind of
knights are you ?

441
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,496
Because all of you are
knights, aren't you ?

442
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,414
Yeah !

443
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:07,794
Pursuing justice,
protecting widows,

444
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:11,464
helping orphans, and seeking
true love !

445
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely !

446
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:16,511
So why not do so
each in your own way ?

447
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:21,099
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

448
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,642
You, sir, what was
your name

449
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,060
before becoming
a fake Quixote ?

450
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,938
My name was Peter,
Peter the Pan Maker.

451
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,773
But there's got to be more
to life than that.

452
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,149
Quite so.

453
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,901
But why not as
yourself ?

454
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:35,113
Sir Peter,
the pan maker.

455
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,115
Hmm...

456
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,117
Sir Peter Pan.

457
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,493
Sir Peter Pan ?

458
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,745
Yes, I like it!

459
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:45,915
Before you know it, that name
will be as famous as...

460
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,250
Don Quixote.

461
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:47,709
You think so ?

462
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,752
Ridiculous.

463
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,629
And... you,
what's your name ?

464
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:52,505
My name ?

465
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,592
Remigio,
and I sell balloons.

466
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,261
They call me "Globus."

467
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:00,179
Sir Globus is...

468
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,389
good.

469
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:02,432
Then, who is Quixote ?

470
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,643
Not me, not me...

471
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,816
I entreat heaven to
protect you, my friends !

472
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,944
The world will remember
your deeds.

473
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,781
And one day, we shall
gather 'round the fire,

474
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:24,203
and with great joy, recall
our exploits !

475
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,455
To adventure !

476
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,709
Yes, to adventure !

477
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,130
And now what ?

478
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:35,465
Puh, they're all nuts.

479
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:38,885
You're a genius.

480
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:40,929
I'd have never
thought of that.

481
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,221
How do you mean ?

482
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,515
That nonsense you made up
to get rid of them.

483
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,517
It was no trick,
my friend.

484
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,063
True nights one and all.

485
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,398
Perhaps you too will
join us one day.

486
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:55,777
Come on, Sancho,

487
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,612
let us depart
to free my love

488
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:00,990
from the evil jaws
of Sinister.

489
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,660
But we don't even
know it was her.

490
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:04,577
It was.

491
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:07,246
Trust me !

492
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,691
Enough!

493
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:38,236
My Olympic days
are over !

494
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,196
Ohh, ooh...

495
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:41,781
Oh... ow.

496
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:45,493
But wasn't that
guy blind ?

497
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:57,005
Ugh, I do so hate
the countryside.

498
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,798
Not that I'm against
the occasional picnic

499
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,592
or anything, but--
pah !

500
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,678
Tastes like a dishcloth.

501
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,555
Hmm, how do you
imagine her ?

502
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,682
Who ?
Dulcinea.

503
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:12,020
I told you before, I don't
want to talk about love.

504
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,521
So far
as I'm concerned,

505
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,106
there's no such thing.

506
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:18,026
Could you imagine someone
searching the world for you,

507
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,028
just because you're
the way you are ?

508
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,657
Ugh, I think I prefer
eating a dishcloth.

509
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,993
One day, I'll be a horse,

510
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,412
and Dulcinea
will kiss me.

511
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:30,329
You don't say.

512
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:31,914
Now if you'll
excuse me,

513
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,292
I have important
business to attend to.

514
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:36,794
One more time, Sancho.

515
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,921
Tell me again.

516
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,716
What was she like ?

517
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,218
One in a million.

518
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,180
The fairest damsel
who ever took breath.

519
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:55,104
Quixote, what would happen
if Dulcinea...

520
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,814
didn't exist ?

521
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,779
My life would be
meaningless.

522
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,656
Well, that wouldn't
be so bad, would it?

523
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,784
And how was
her voice ?

524
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:09,243
Was it bright ?

525
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,913
Look, Quixote,
if I was a woman,

526
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:13,664
I'd think you were
a good man

527
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,458
and I'd give you a chance.

528
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,751
Seriously ?

529
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:17,960
Of course not.

530
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:19,962
I'm just saying that
to shut you up.

531
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,964
It's time to sleep.

532
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,591
Hmm.

533
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:24,801
Good night, Sancho.

534
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,969
Good night, Quixote.

535
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:29,806
Sancho!

536
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:31,682
What ?

537
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,976
Thanks for believing in me.

538
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,354
♪ And that's
why I love you ♪

539
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:39,065

I say it's night.

There's nothing wrong with stopping to eat.

564
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,487
Everyone needs to eat,

00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:52,949
Help, help !

566
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,450

00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:55,284
So?

568
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:57,203
We must help her.

569
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:59,580
I can't hear a thing.

570
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,165
Ooh !

571
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,014
Ahh !

572
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,100
Will anyone help me ?

573
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:20,893
I'll take care of the lion,
and you save the fair lady.

574
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:23,229
But I don't
even know her !

575
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:24,313
Forward,
my great steed !

576
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,191
Who ? Sorry,
never heard of him.

577
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:34,490
Uh-oh.

578
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:36,450
Okay, so what do you
do when you come

579
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,077
face-to-face
with a wild lion ?

580
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:39,161
Tremble ?

581
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,455
Tremble, that's it ?

582
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,457
<i>That's it.</i>

583
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,917
Ahh !

584
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:47,211
Okay, okay, step aside,
I'll take care of this.

585
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,380
Everything's under control.

586
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:50,965
Hurry, there's no
time to waste.

587
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,509
Listen, lady,
take it easy.

588
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,261
We must act
immediately !

589
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:56,470
She's in great danger!

590
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,682
But the lion's coming
straight towards us.

591
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:01,017
Here I go !

592
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,112
Gah, did we have to
come all this way

593
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:16,073
just to make
fools of ourselves ?

594
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,745
Yahhh !
Get lost.

595
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,263
Oh, my !

596
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,275
Ooh, is-- is he dead ?

597
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,196
He's killed my Rucio.

598
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,700
Is he dead ?

599
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,661
Yah !

600
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,663
Stand, stand if you dare !

601
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:07,792
Ahh, ohh !

602
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:16,550
Thanks for the escort.

603
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,095
Your wish is our command.

604
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:22,181
Though, unfortunately, we can't
detain ourselves further,

605
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:23,182
as we are
pursuing the delinquents

606
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:25,935
who kidnapped my beloved
Dulcinea.

607
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:29,522
How romantic !

608
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:31,107
Let's go to
the castle.

609
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,525
I'm sure my husband
will send

610
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:35,611
a fearsome army
after those villains.

611
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:40,574
And besides, that means you'll
be able to rest a little.

612
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:05,766
Ay!

613
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:07,810
Attend to my guests

614
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:11,272
and take care of
their mounts.

615
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,859
Our fearsome army.

616
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,990
Ahh, chicken supper.

617
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:25,995
Oh.

618
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,092
Well, isn't that the lion--

619
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,720
Never fear.

620
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:46,307
Bartolo is only aggressive
outside the castle walls.

621
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,059
A little insecurity problem.

622
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,103
My respects, your grace.

623
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:54,315
Don Quixote de la Mancha,
at your faithful service.

624
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,192
Darling, I told
this brave knight

625
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:59,153
we'd help catch the kidnappers
of his beloved lady.

626
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:02,031
I guarantee that wagon
will never leave this land--

627
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:05,493
uh, because I imagine

628
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,120
they travel in a wagon,
don't they ?

629
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,122
Many thanks.

630
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:11,123
But I can't possibly
let anyone else perform

631
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,126
the duty that is mine alone.

632
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:17,296
You saved my love.

633
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:20,633
Permit me, in the name of
the sacred laws of chivalry,

634
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,176
to do the same for you.

635
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:23,511
Well, if you invoke
the laws of chivalry,

636
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,803
then I have no option.

637
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:28,390
First, we shall send
my army with Bartolo,

638
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,476
a great tracker.

639
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:33,354
And once they've found
the wicked miscreants,

640
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:36,482
it will fall to you
to free her.

641
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:40,444
But if you wish,
my men can beat them,

642
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,780
and whip them, drag them
along the ground

643
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:45,783
until they scream
and plead for mercy !

644
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,743
Darling...

645
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:49,828
Your commitment
is all too clear.

646
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,830
And your reward.

647
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:55,209
Ask whatever you wish,
and it shall be yours.

648
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,211
I consider myself
already paid in full.

649
00:38:57,503 --> 00:39:00,422
And you, my friend,
from all I possess,

650
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:01,882
choose what you wish.

651
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,093
So, for example,
if I ask for food,

652
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,678
you'd give it to me ?
Done.

653
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,346
What else do you wish ?

654
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:08,639
Money ?
Can I ask for money ?

655
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,307
Done.

656
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,226
Hmm...

657
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:15,813
It is said that the wish
of the noble Sancho

658
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,147
is to be
governor of an island.

659
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,440
Yeah, right.

660
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:19,358
Can I ask for one of
those islands

661
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,776
with water all around it?

662
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,279
By luck, in my dominions,

663
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,531
there is just
such an island,

664
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:26,740
and it needs a governor.

665
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,076
An island, hey,
with water all around it !

666
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:32,121
But how can I leave you
on your own ?

667
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:34,498
After all the sacrifices
you have made,

668
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,125
I insist you take
immediate possession.

669
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,627
I have to tell Teresa.

670
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:41,463
Don't worry, we'll take care
of everything.

671
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:47,803
My friend, forgive me
if I ever doubted you.

672
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:51,098
All you ever promised
has come true.

673
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,891
To the new governor.

674
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,769
Governor Sancho Panza !

675
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,192
Your eyes--

676
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,987
your eyes are like...

677
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,238
two eyes.

678
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:11,535
That's just gone too far.

679
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:14,496
Your voice--
now, let me see.

680
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:15,205
How does your
voice sound ?

681
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,541
I don't believe this.

682
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,377
Hmm, you're such a seducer.

683
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,129
Huh ?

684
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,261
What the--

685
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:31,764
Well, when you know mares
like I know mares.

686
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,351
If I were you,
I'd come check this out.

687
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:37,061
Oh, get lost !

688
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:49,281
My dear governor, forgive me
for summoning you like this,

689
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:51,367
but I need your help !

690
00:40:57,081 --> 00:41:00,334
Oh, right, governor.

691
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:03,253
Your wish is my command,
duchess.

692
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,214
Take this.

693
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,007
I understand you alone

694
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,760
have actually
seen this Dulcinea,

695
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:14,139
and I was wondering
what she is like.

696
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:15,391
Why do you ask ?

697
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:18,477
It's all there in this
new best-seller, you see,

698
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:20,562
everything that happened.

699
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:24,525
And Cervantes assures us
you never even saw Dulcinea.

700
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:31,990
And another thing--

701
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,993
Quixote is in danger
from the Sinister Knight,

702
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,246
and only you can
help him.

703
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,414
Don Quixote made him up.

704
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:41,583
Oh, no, he is real,
as real as they come.

705
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,837
And he plans to
destroy Quixote.

706
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:46,839
But we know how to
be rid of him,

707
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:50,050
and in doing so, help
Quixote find his Dulcinea.

708
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,344
But she doesn't
exist either.

709
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:53,595
Listen carefully, Sancho.

710
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,556
If you want to
save Quixote

711
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:57,766
and keep your
precious island...

712
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:07,735
As midnight has passed,

713
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,695
and your valiant soldiers
have not returned,

714
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:10,988
I beg your leave to depart.

715
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,906
Don't be so impatient !

716
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,283
I'm sure
they'll be back soon.

717
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:17,536
But Barcelona is my
final clue to Dulcinea,

718
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:19,663
and the full moon is but
two nights away.

719
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:31,341
Forgive such forwardness,
my lord,

720
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:34,428
but I must abandon you
forth ways because...

721
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,680
oh, yeah, that's it.

722
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,932
I thought I heard
the guardsman.

723
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,434
Perhaps they have news.

724
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:41,977
Off you go.

725
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:43,979
Tell me, Quixote,
is it true you never

726
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:45,397
actually saw Dulcinea ?

727
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,441
Not with my eyes,
it's true.

728
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:53,363
But with my heart,
every second of my life.

729
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:54,615
But Sancho has seen her,

730
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:55,532
and his eyes are keener
than mine--

731
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:58,494
so often blinded by passion.

732
00:42:58,786 --> 00:42:59,745
I think I'm headed off
to my island.

733
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,750
Sir, the constable has--

734
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:06,585
The wagon ?

735
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:07,878
A wagon, and brought
it to the--

736
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,004
Here ?

737
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:09,797
Sorry ?

738
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,507
Oh yeah, a wagon,

739
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:13,675
with two men and a woman
in the back,

740
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:16,053
and they asked
to take refuge

741
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:19,014
according to the sacred
laws of chivalry.

742
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:19,932
Hmm.

743
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:21,517
Okay, can I go now ?

744
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:22,476
What's wrong ?

745
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:26,021
Under laws
of refuge...

746
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,147
we can't touch them.

747
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,649
Am I to believe
that with Dulcinea

748
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:32,486
and her captors right here,
you plan to do nothing ?

749
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:35,364
Do men make laws
only to deny justice ?

750
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:39,326
But nobody even knows
what she looks like.

751
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,453
Except the governor.

752
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:42,579
What if it
really is her ?

753
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,790
You're right.

754
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:46,708
Justice should be
above the law.

755
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,753
Is the governor
willing to help ?

756
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,893
Is it she ?

757
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:07,521
Out with it !

758
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:10,148
Is she or is she not
Dulcinea ?

759
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,942
Quixote, the truth is--

760
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:13,402
This is not the behavior
of a governor !

761
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:15,696
Is it possible ?

762
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:18,740
Is this, by the glory of
the sacred laws of chivalry,

763
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,492
the place where--

764
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,873
Come on, come on,
let us not waste more time.

765
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,296
Don't get near, Pendejo.

766
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:41,138
I shall respect you
under refuge on condition:

767
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,474
you immediately release
the beautiful Dulcinea,

768
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,144
queen of my days
and princess of my nights.

769
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:58,488
Oh, that's nice.

770
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:02,117
Release me, you say ?

771
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,119
The macho man
hasn't been born

772
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:07,205
who can get the better
of me.

773
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:10,792
I-- I have no words,
Dulcinea.

774
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:14,463
Love weakens
my voice and my will.

775
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,214
And you are ?

776
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:18,800
Don Quixote de la Mancha,
at your faithful service.

777
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:19,801
Ugh, not another one.

778
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:22,721
Don't waste your time,
sunshine.

779
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:29,311
Well, I never imagined
the moment quite like that.

780
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:39,988
Why don't humans understand
what we say ?

781
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,823
They can't be too
intelligent, can they ?

782
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,159
After all, we understand
everything they say.

783
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:45,494
It's all for
the best, Rucio.

784
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:49,998
Your master got his island,
mine his Dulcinea.

785
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,460
And I got a mare with
a magnificent apartment.

786
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:54,711
But it's all a lie.

787
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:57,214
It's always been a lie.

788
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:58,674
Where are you ?

789
00:45:58,966 --> 00:46:01,093
Not as long
as we believed in it.

790
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:02,803
Hunky ?
Hunky ?

791
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:08,517
Rucio, we're off
right now !

792
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:10,686
Not now.

793
00:46:10,978 --> 00:46:13,230
I said, no !

794
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:19,653
What have I done,
what have I done ?

795
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:22,948
I'll never be able to look
Quixote in the face again.

796
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,215
<i>Rue...</i>

797
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,093
Hunky, are you
deaf or something ?

798
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:50,267
My dear Don,

799
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,561
cool your aching heart.

800
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:56,189
Dulcinea will
speak with you, or else !

801
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:57,983
Without her, I'm nothing.

802
00:46:58,275 --> 00:47:00,902
And your thoughts
are now of marriage ?

803
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,701
Marriage, so soon ?

804
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:10,996
And how long have you been
searching for her ?

805
00:47:11,288 --> 00:47:12,205
For all eternity !

806
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:13,957
Time goes by, Quixote.

807
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:16,293
I married duchess
without knowing her--

808
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:19,212
Well, I don't suppose I know
her now, really.

809
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:21,840
If you put it
like that...

810
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:25,260
So you accept ?

811
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:32,976
We still aren't far enough.

812
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:34,186
We could've brought
a horse.

813
00:47:34,478 --> 00:47:35,604
Still a good way
to go until we reach

814
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:38,690
the Isle of Barataria,
governor.

815
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:42,444
Good--
the further, the better.

816
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:52,913
Queen of my days,
princess of my nights,

817
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:53,789
I am your faithful servant.

818
00:47:54,081 --> 00:47:55,957
Ugh !

819
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,043
Must you keep
repeating yourself ?

820
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:01,129
So what's on offer,
exactly ?

821
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:02,255
Your true love.

822
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,217
Um, something
a little more tangible ?

823
00:48:05,509 --> 00:48:07,803
One must marry well,
you know.

824
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:08,970
I haven't even
asked her yet.

825
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:13,975
Uh, what pretense
of love is this,

826
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,937
if you can't show
how much you care ?

827
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:19,064
Don't I deserve a
diamond necklace ?

828
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:19,689
Aren't I worth a house
in the country ?

829
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:20,690
A private pension ?

830
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:23,151
Paid holidays
in Palm Beach ?

831
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:24,069
A weekly facial ?

832
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:25,946
Ugh, get him
out of my sight.

833
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:29,116
How can this skinflint possibly
be the true Quixote ?

834
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,076
But I am he.

835
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:33,537
Ugh, yeah, the one
who fought windmills

836
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:35,789
and traveled the world for love
without even knowing me ?

837
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,375
Giants,
they were giants.

838
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:41,002
Look, I never
asked a thing.

839
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:42,796
Not battles nor adventures.

840
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:47,134
And now, when all I want's
a decent wedding,

841
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,136
the true Quixote
wouldn't reject me,

842
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,263
just because I wasn't up
to his dreams !

843
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:52,472
Ugh !

844
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:55,684
He wouldn't treat me
like some toy !

845
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:59,938
Wisdom was never
so painfully gained.

846
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,400
I have been selfish,
Dulcinea.

847
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:06,361
Let us do as
you say, immediately.

848
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,321
All that is mine
is yours.

849
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:09,281
Hooray !

850
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:10,699
Tonight, a party !

851
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:13,243
And you'll be able
to wear the new clothes

852
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:16,663
I've embroidered for you
with all my love.

853
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:24,087
Sweetie pie,
where are you ?

854
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:25,922
I tell you, Sinister,

855
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:27,674
they'll never reach
Barcelona.

856
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:30,135
They're finished.

857
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:35,348
That includes the supplement for your thugs

858
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,393
letting themselves
get walloped by Sancho,

859
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,021
and exclusive rights
in case you decide

860
00:49:41,313 --> 00:49:43,940
to sell
the story some day.

861
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:46,401
Is that clear, Avellaneda ?

862
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:47,777
Now, let me see.

863
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:50,280
We have to pay rent on
the set and the castle,

864
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:51,323
my husband has to conduct

865
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:54,075
a very expensive wedding
tomorrow.

866
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:55,410
Oh, and you can't
begin to imagine

867
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:59,372
the amount of top-quality meat
that beast eats every day.

868
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:00,916
This is what
we agreed.

869
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:03,210
The rest later.

870
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,127
Aren't you going to
say anything ?

871
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,922
Yes, I want to
keep Bartolo.

872
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:07,881
Oh, what on earth for ?!

873
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:09,925
To eat people!

874
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:10,926
But he's a vegetarian !

875
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:17,349
I want to keep Bartolo.

876
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:18,850
Um, what about me ?

877
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:21,394
That Quixote don't look like
he's so loaded after all.

878
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,356
But his friend is, my dear,
and he feels so guilty,

879
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:26,566
He won't deny you a thing.

880
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:28,109
Ugh-- who was it ?

881
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,536
Sweetie pie !

882
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,086
Get away from me !

883
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:00,183
Are you okay,
hunky, darling ?

884
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,894
Don't you like my
new hairstyle ?

885
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,563
You really think
a thoroughbred like me

886
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,899
would be interested in some
cheap trotter ?

887
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:11,236
Oh, here comes the part
where I really get it.

888
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,411
Oh, now I'm angry !

889
00:51:21,413 --> 00:51:24,040
You are, like, so...

890
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:25,709
pathetic !

891
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,628
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

892
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:31,256
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

893
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,219

895
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:48,064
Ah, Oh, Oh...

896
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:52,235
Nice outfit, Quixote.

897
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:55,238
You have to admit, Altisidora
has impeccable taste.

898
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,031
Altdi-- who ?

899
00:51:56,323 --> 00:51:59,159
Did I say Altisidora ?

900
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,996
My friend,
forget Barcelona.

901
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:05,332
You've got your
Dulcinea now--

902
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,292
the real one, of course.

903
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:08,084
The truth is,
I was wondering

904
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,128
if my good friend Sancho

905
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,171
will be back
in time for the wedding.

906
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:14,466
Of course,
how could he miss this ?

907
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:18,178
♪ Just one
desire I can't deny ♪

908
00:52:23,475 --> 00:52:24,559
I've got this funny feeling

909
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,645
we've been going
around in circles.

910
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:30,023
It's a trick,
don't you see ?

911
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:32,400
Now I understand.

912
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,402
Of course !
Great !

913
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:36,696
It's simple, they gave me
the wrong map.

914
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:39,407
Oh, really.

915
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:41,493
How can this be
the Isle of Barataria ?

916
00:52:41,785 --> 00:52:43,161
It hasn't got water
all around it.

917
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:45,455
And did you figure
that out all by yourself,

918
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:47,624
or did the donkey help ?

919
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:49,125
Thanks for your help, guys,

920
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,210
but I'm heading back
to the castle.

921
00:52:50,502 --> 00:52:52,212
Quixote needs me,
and I don't think

922
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:54,547
I'd be much of
a governor anyhow.

923
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,424
What do I owe you ?

924
00:52:58,385 --> 00:53:00,470
You're not going back
anyplace.

925
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,055
I'm a free man,
I'll do what I want.

926
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:05,642
No, you won't.

927
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,403
I'm raging !

928
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:28,331
Roasted over a slow flame,
I think.

929
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:36,047
Ooh !

930
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:37,465
Wait !

931
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:42,137
The beating was bad enough,
but burned alive ?!

932
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:44,472
Don't worry, boss !

933
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:54,023
Now you're
making me dizzy !

934
00:53:57,485 --> 00:54:00,321
Oh, oh, great plan !

935
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:03,408
Really effective-- no !

936
00:54:07,996 --> 00:54:08,663
Smoke...

937
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:10,123
No, thank you,
I don't indulge--

938
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:12,375
Fire !

939
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:26,097
Rocinante !

940
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:40,612
Couldn't you even
wait for us

941
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:42,697
to be properly cooked ?

942
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:44,657
Don't you touch him !

943
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:51,080
We've got to get out of here.

944
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:00,632
Everything's under control.

945
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:03,593
Sorry, but I'm too
young to die.

946
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,180
What's all this ?

947
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:09,807
Him.
Him.

948
00:55:11,643 --> 00:55:13,228
Oh, my love !

949
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,979
What have they
done to you ?

950
00:55:16,523 --> 00:55:19,317
If I don't get
married tomorrow,

951
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:21,569
someone will have to
compensate me.

952
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:24,572
Dumb's okay,
but not a vegetable !

953
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:43,258
Rocinante.

954
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:51,516
Ow-- huh ?

955
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:55,728
My brave steed.

956
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,146
What about me ?
Who's more important ?

957
00:55:57,438 --> 00:56:00,441
Me, or some stupid horse ?

958
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:05,905
Queen of my days
and princess of my nights,

959
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:07,240
I-- I have--

960
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:09,409
maybe we should wait a bit--
this wedding is--

961
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:10,618
Enough with these
childish pranks.

962
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:11,828
What are you
two waiting for ?

963
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,621
Sorry ?

964
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:16,666
Why wait until tomorrow, with
such a magnificent full moon ?

965
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,043
It isn't quite
full yet, it's--

966
00:56:24,007 --> 00:56:27,927
Who cares ?
Why not get married right now ?

967
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,345
Altis--

968
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:31,306
Dulcinea !

969
00:56:31,598 --> 00:56:32,807
Do you take
Quixote to be--

970
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:34,392
Yes !

971
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:36,436
And you, Quixote, do you take
this beautiful lady

972
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:39,022
to be your
lawfully wedded wife ?

973
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,566
This isn't the way
I imagined it.

974
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:44,777
Did you understand
the question, Quixote ?

975
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:46,988
I...

976
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:53,953
Well... l...

977
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:55,288
No !

978
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,956
No!

979
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:59,000
Sancho ?

980
00:57:00,627 --> 00:57:01,502
The governor of...

981
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:07,008
There'll be no wedding,
Quixote.

982
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:11,679
I lied to you.

983
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:13,848
I never saw Dulcinea
all that time ago.

984
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:18,353
I looked right enough,
day and night,

985
00:57:18,645 --> 00:57:19,812
day after day, for you,

986
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:23,483
for my best--
my only friend.

987
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:26,361
But the truth is...
she doesn't exist.

988
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:29,072
Then this lady--

989
00:57:29,364 --> 00:57:30,490
Ugh, "lady" ?

990
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:32,241
Some jumping
midget comes along

991
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,744
and says I'm not
your Dulcinea,

992
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:36,412
and you believe him ?

993
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,623
I invented it all.

994
00:57:38,915 --> 00:57:40,208
And this one's just
another invention.

995
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,627
Try inventing these,
buster !

996
00:57:42,919 --> 00:57:45,755
This is a real woman !

997
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,468
Come along, my dear,
better luck next time.

998
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,594
Yes, my love.

999
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:55,598
Ahhh !

1000
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:04,107
Rucio !

1001
00:58:04,399 --> 00:58:05,274
I hope your
insurance covers it.

1002
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:08,861
I never thought I'd be
so glad to see you.

1003
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:13,950
James, James !

1004
00:58:14,242 --> 00:58:15,993
Wake up,
this isn't funny.

1005
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:19,288
Too late.

1006
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,498
James...

1007
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:53,823
Well, you oughta
be happy.

1008
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:55,116
We're going home.

1009
00:58:55,408 --> 00:58:58,411
You know, I'm not sure
about anything anymore.

1010
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:00,955
And you ?

1011
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:43,664
Rocinante !

1012
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:57,595
It's that way to
the village.

1013
00:59:57,887 --> 00:59:59,055
Teresa will be hopping mad,

1014
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:00,473
but at least we'll
get something to eat.

1015
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:03,810
After all, Barcelona's
a long way,

1016
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:07,480
and it will just be
more of the same, right ?

1017
01:00:07,772 --> 01:00:08,481
This is the end,
Sancho.

1018
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:11,359
It's over.

1019
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:13,569
All my life,
I've been a coward,

1020
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:15,404
running away from
reality.

1021
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:20,159
But you can't
live on illusions.

1022
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:20,910
A coward ?

1023
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:22,954
You've lived
a great life.

1024
01:00:23,246 --> 01:00:24,831
Are you serious ?

1025
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,833
I never met
a braver man,

1026
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:28,876
a man who dares to
live as he feels

1027
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:31,087
and thinks with his heart.

1028
01:00:31,379 --> 01:00:34,131
At least Dulcinea was
a beautiful illusion.

1029
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:36,676
Oh, Dulcinea...

1030
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:42,765
So... home ?

1031
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:43,558
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking ?

1032
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:47,144
Hmm...

1033
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:49,021
Ha-ha !

1034
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,065
Come on !

1035
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:40,990
Quixote, that duel
between you

1036
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:43,034
and the Knight Of
The Crescent Moon, wasn't it...

1037
01:01:43,326 --> 01:01:44,869
Uh-huh.
Alone...

1038
01:01:45,161 --> 01:01:46,495
Face-to-face at dusk ?
That's right.

1039
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:49,290
Then could you explain
something to me ?

1040
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:22,365
Ah.

1041
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:28,496
Huh ?

1042
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:30,414
Oh, look who's here.

1043
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,083
Sir Peter Pan.

1044
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:33,876
I'm not
Peter Pan anymore.

1045
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:35,294
It'll never catch on.

1046
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,672
I've decided to be
Quixote again.

1047
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:38,631
Sir Globus !

1048
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:40,466
Me too.

1049
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,072
Tent, helmet, armor,
and once set of lances.

1050
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:03,864
The sword is optional.

1051
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:05,783
Social-security number ?

1052
01:03:06,075 --> 01:03:07,743
What's that ?
A photo i.d. ?

1053
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:09,453
Hmm...

1054
01:03:09,745 --> 01:03:11,455
Well... well...

1055
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,001
It's not my best, but--

1056
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:16,961
Okay, in the case
of accident ?

1057
01:03:17,253 --> 01:03:18,879
Sancho,
Sancho Panza.

1058
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,589
6-3-3 8-4-5-6.

1059
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,926
That's all, sign here.

1060
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,972
You're Quixote 163.

1061
01:03:28,264 --> 01:03:29,974
50 eurocrowns ?

1062
01:03:30,266 --> 01:03:33,310
But first,
where's my book ?

1063
01:03:34,979 --> 01:03:37,523
I'm gonna go broke.

1064
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:45,614
Well, this is
the end of us.

1065
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:47,074
Never fear, Sancho.

1066
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:50,077
It's all going to
work out just fine.

1067
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:09,764
The light, I can
already see the light !

1068
01:04:10,056 --> 01:04:12,975
And...

1069
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,644
what are you planning
to ride, exactly ?

1070
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:18,105
Hmm, good question.

1071
01:04:18,397 --> 01:04:21,275
I just saw some pretty good rental horses
outside-- Hey, I'm here, what about me ?

1072
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:24,737
Got the afternoon free,
what do you say, Don ?

1073
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:25,988
Can't you hear me ?

1074
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,364
Hey, hello !

1075
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:28,741
Maybe...

1076
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:30,951
Oh, forget it.

1077
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:33,245
Why not ?

1078
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:35,081
Yes !

1079
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,792
I've got it,
Rucio shall be my steed.

1080
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:38,876
Yes !

1081
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:40,461
Where's Rucio ?
Right here !

1082
01:04:40,753 --> 01:04:41,337
There you are.

1083
01:04:41,629 --> 01:04:43,047
Yes !

1084
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:45,299
Rucio, would you consent...
Yes, yes !

1085
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:47,927
To being my horse-- Can't you understand a simple yes ?

1086
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,014
Oh, that's right,
just finish me off.

1087
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:55,351
Don't take offense, Quixote,
but Rucio's only a donkey.

1088
01:04:55,643 --> 01:04:56,894
Don't ruin it !

1089
01:04:57,186 --> 01:04:59,355
This beast has show
great courage.

1090
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,982
He's strong
and resilient.

1091
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:03,776
He's a survivor.

1092
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:05,861
Kneel, Rucio.

1093
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,947
By the authority
vested in me,

1094
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:10,074
by the sacred
laws of chivalry,

1095
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:14,995
I name thee horse of
the highest rank.

1096
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:19,875
It's the battle of the century !

1097
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,877
And remember,
the joust, the duel

1098
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:24,088
the winning Quixote will have
the honor to fight

1099
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:27,133
the Knight Of
The Crescent Moon !

1100
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:34,431
Quixote 26
enters the arena.

1101
01:05:34,723 --> 01:05:35,808
His opponent,
Quixote 13 !

1102
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,270
Applause, please !

1103
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,443
Yeah, that hurts !

1104
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:48,863
Let's pick up
the pieces and move on,

1105
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:51,115
'cause here comes
Quixote 76 !

1106
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:12,094
Whoa...

1107
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:14,722
You know, I'd fight
in Quixote's place

1108
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:17,474
if they'd let me.

1109
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:29,195
Be careful !

1110
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:33,032
Watch out !

1111
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,410
Ooh.

1112
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,167
Holy cow !

1113
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:52,176
Forget I said that !

1114
01:06:55,054 --> 01:06:58,807
Do we have our
ringer, then ?

1115
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,476
666.

1116
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:01,852
Unbeatable.

1117
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:04,188
He'd better be.

1118
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:10,402
I entreat thee, dispatch me
to the Elysian fields

1119
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:12,363
if cowardice I show.

1120
01:07:12,655 --> 01:07:13,781
I pray also for
the Knight Esplandian,

1121
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:17,493
son of Amadis and Oriana,
here with me today.

1122
01:07:17,785 --> 01:07:19,536
Show him the way to courage,

1123
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:24,124
and help free his soul
from such cruel punishment.

1124
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:26,835
Surely you're not gonna
wear that old junk.

1125
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:28,087
It's my armor.

1126
01:07:28,379 --> 01:07:29,213
It's for real out there,
Quixote,

1127
01:07:29,505 --> 01:07:30,339
and this thing--

1128
01:07:30,631 --> 01:07:31,006
well, I don't know
what's up with it,

1129
01:07:31,298 --> 01:07:32,841
but it's not good.

1130
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:36,095
The spell will only be broken
when the soul of this knight

1131
01:07:36,387 --> 01:07:39,056
takes part in
an act of courage.

1132
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:42,017
Ahh, impossible.

1133
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,395
That's impossible.

1134
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:47,189
I believe in you.

1140

Hi.

1141
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:09,878
I suppose they
do need someone

1142
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,880
to pick up the helmets
around here, donkey.

1143
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:13,257
Let go of me !

1144
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:15,592
I'm off into battle
in a moment !

1145
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:16,969
I am Don Quixote's steed !

1146
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:20,556
You're going nowhere,
you're a donkey.

1147
01:08:20,848 --> 01:08:21,974
If your Quixote
needs a horse,

1148
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:23,934
then he can rent us.

1149
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:25,644
That's what
we're here for.

1150
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:26,854
Exactly.

1151
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:28,605
And it's no fun being
grounded on the beach.

1152
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:30,983
Ow, ow, ow...

1153
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:32,735
On the beach ?

1154
01:08:33,027 --> 01:08:34,236
On the bench !

1155
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,240
Let's go, sir Rucio.

1156
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:39,867
It's time.

1157
01:08:41,535 --> 01:08:42,578
What did he
just call him ?

1158
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:45,372
Sounded a bit of
a putdown to me.

1159
01:08:50,336 --> 01:08:52,713
Look who's come
to see you !

1160
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,429
Can we talk about this ?

1161
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:02,514
Here's the deal.

1162
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:05,225
I just eat
your legs.

1163
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:05,893
That way,
your master doesn't get

1164
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:08,145
to take part in the joust.

1165
01:09:08,437 --> 01:09:10,230
Don't you know
anything ?

1166
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:11,357
I'm retired !

1167
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,401
Rucio is Quixote's
horse now and--

1168
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:16,779
What did you say ?

1169
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:23,243
You want me to
repeat it for you, pal ?

1170
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:26,705
Hi-yah !

1171
01:09:38,217 --> 01:09:41,053
Hey, boss !
James, you're alive !

1172
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:43,263
You're safe.

1173
01:09:43,555 --> 01:09:44,640
Off, James.

1174
01:09:44,932 --> 01:09:46,141
There's a good chicken.

1175
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:48,894
Well, I'm going
lettuce hunting.

1176
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:16,588
Due to circumstances
beyond our control,

1177
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,384
we'll be passing
directly to the semifinal.

1178
01:10:20,676 --> 01:10:23,762
Peter Pan, Don Quixote 25.

1179
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:28,767
Remigio, alias: Globus,
Quixote 26.

1180
01:10:30,811 --> 01:10:34,356
Don Alonso Quijano, Quixote 163.

1181
01:10:35,524 --> 01:10:39,069
And a last-minute entry,
Quixote 666,

1182
01:10:39,361 --> 01:10:40,112
The Golden Knight.

1183
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:46,910
Well, at least we should be
home for supper.

1184
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:57,004
Hail, Sinister!

1185
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:06,597
What have I gotten into ?

1186
01:11:06,889 --> 01:11:08,932
Hi-yah !

1187
01:11:09,224 --> 01:11:11,018
Whoa... whoa !

1188
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:20,068
Whaa-ha-ha !

1189
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,695
Whoo-ha-ha !

1190
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:23,322
Woo-hoo !

1191
01:11:23,614 --> 01:11:24,072
First finalist !

1192
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:27,367
Remigio Globus !

1193
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:29,286
What, me ?

1194
01:11:29,578 --> 01:11:32,122
And you hired this
hopeless failure

1195
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:36,627
to get rid of Quixote ?

1196
01:11:36,919 --> 01:11:41,632
Don't worry, he's not
in the final...

1197
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:43,383
Yet.

1198
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:47,095
Alonso Quijano !

1199
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:51,225
But what's this
he's riding ?

1200
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:53,727
This is ridiculous !

1201
01:11:57,523 --> 01:12:02,569

something from me.

the one and only
Don Quixote !

1220
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:12,806
Damn the lot of you !

1221
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:08,570
And now we give you
the battle of the century,

1222
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:11,531
between the true,
the one and only,

1223
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:15,243
the inimitable
Don Quixote de la Mancha !

1224
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:20,832
Weighing in at 140 pounds!

1225
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:23,460
And the Knight
Of The Crescent Moon...

1226
01:14:23,752 --> 01:14:25,629
Sinister,
I might have known.

1227
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:28,423
Must you always ruin things ?

1228
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:30,592
Bachelor, what are
you doing here ?

1229
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:31,802
And dressed like that ?

1230
01:14:32,094 --> 01:14:33,845
Damn you, Quixote !

1231
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:37,015
Ever since I was a child,
I've been nothing !

1232
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:40,394
I studied, I try,
oh, but in our village,

1233
01:14:40,686 --> 01:14:42,688
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza

1234
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,023
are the only ones
who count !

1235
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,775
I tried to
stop you when I put

1236
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:48,985
an early end to your
first adventure.

1237
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:50,529
So it was you.

1238
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:51,822
Just you wait.

1239
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:55,575
And now I finally get
a chance to be someone,

1240
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:57,744
a chance to be famous,

1241
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:00,580
and you humiliate me
in front of everybody !

1242
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:01,998
Come along, my friend.

1243
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,792
If you really wanna
be someone--

1244
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,711
someone important--
why not become a knight ?

1245
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,295
Maybe they'll write a book
about you too,

1246
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:10,799
and you'll be
immortalized for all eternity.

1247
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:11,925
A knight, you say ?

1248
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:13,802
You could sign up
for a course...

1249
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:14,928
at night school.

1250
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,346
Sorry, old chap,
I've gotta go.

1251
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:17,431
I'm on again.

1252
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:22,811
There's everything
to play for !

1253
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,063
May the best man win !

1254
01:15:37,576 --> 01:15:38,618
Woo-hoo !

1255
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:42,247
This could be the end
for Quixote.

1256
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:44,207
Careful !

1257
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,585
Watch it, hang on !

1258
01:15:47,836 --> 01:15:48,336
Forget it, Quixote !

1259
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,547
It isn't worth it !

1260
01:15:50,839 --> 01:15:52,340
To the bitter end !

1261
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:53,341
I know my destiny !

1262
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:55,385
And mine !

1263
01:15:55,677 --> 01:15:56,762
Incredible !

1264
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,681
They're still standing
after that !

1265
01:16:01,892 --> 01:16:02,851
Wow.

1266
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:05,604
All right, he did it !

1267
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:09,107
Yes !

1268
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:51,358
Hmm.

1269
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:01,827
No.

1270
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:05,622
I believe in you.

1271
01:17:05,914 --> 01:17:06,623
No !

1272
01:17:11,378 --> 01:17:12,420
Enough.

1273
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:14,172
Come here.

1274
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:18,760
Hah !

1275
01:17:27,853 --> 01:17:29,646
Ahh !

1276
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,863
Must still have a few
old scores to settle.

1277
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:56,131
Whoa !

1278
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:02,137
You win.

1279
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:06,683
I'm mad about Dulcinea,

1280
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:09,436
but she deserves the best
and bravest of knights.

1281
01:18:09,728 --> 01:18:13,398
I must renounce my love

1282
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,400
for the sake
of a...

1283
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:17,485
a pure love

1284
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:19,738
and what is
best for her.

1285
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:21,740
Renounce ?

1286
01:18:22,032 --> 01:18:22,824
Only the true Quixote

1287
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:26,161
would take honor
and courage so far.

1288
01:18:26,453 --> 01:18:28,830
Only Quixote would
renounce love

1289
01:18:29,122 --> 01:18:30,582
for the sake of
true, pure love,

1290
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:33,543
which is why you are
the winner,

1291
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:35,712
the best among knights.

1292
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:45,347
Wow.

1293
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:47,849
For I am Dulcinea.

1294
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:49,017
Ahh !

1295
01:18:49,309 --> 01:18:51,394
What?
Huh ?

1296
01:18:53,063 --> 01:18:56,816
Much like you, I had to
know if Quixote was real,

1297
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:59,611
or just a figment of
my imagination,

1298
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:00,779
so I set all this up.

1299
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:02,530
Can it be possible ?
ls this the--

1300
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:08,787
ls this, by the glory of
the sacred laws of chivalry--

1301
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:09,704
Cut the crap.

1302
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,582
Yeah !

1303
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:15,460
Oh, yes !

1304
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:20,715
Bravo, congratulations
and all that.

1305
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:22,550
Now what
about the treasure ?

1306
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:24,135
Treasure ?

1307
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:27,138
Do you know how much it
costs to organize this ?

1308
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:29,641
You made it !

1309
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:30,767
It was nothing.

1310
01:19:31,059 --> 01:19:34,896
But you're a horse,
a real horse !

1311
01:19:35,188 --> 01:19:36,731
A horse ?

1312
01:19:38,358 --> 01:19:39,859
And of the best of breeds !

1313
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:41,820
A Percheron, no less !

1314
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:44,698
All right, all right, okay, enough flattery.

1315
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,575
Make way, give him some room,
everybody back !

1316
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,786
Hmm !

1317
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:01,297
Sancho!

1318
01:20:01,589 --> 01:20:03,008
<i>Hasta la vista !</i>

1319
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,343
We'll be together
again soon, my friend !

1320
01:20:05,635 --> 01:20:07,679
Just don't come back
without the rent.

1321
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:09,764
What's that ?

1322
01:20:12,392 --> 01:20:15,311
Everything under control.

1323
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:24,612
Why does your friend
want a lion ?

1324
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:27,574
You haven't met his wife.

1325
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,921
And this, my friends,

1326
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:44,299
is the true story
of Don Quixote.

1327
01:20:44,591 --> 01:20:47,343
Sancho returned
home happily to Teresa

1328
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:49,804
and Rocinante went back
to his dear dusty barn

1329
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:52,015
to care for his beloved hens.

1330
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:55,894
For taking care of Don.

1331
01:20:58,063 --> 01:21:00,815
Did you see that ?!

1332
01:21:01,107 --> 01:21:03,693
It's no surprise Quixote
lived happily ever after

1333
01:21:03,985 --> 01:21:05,528
with that adorable creature.

1334
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:11,201
Of course, I stayed
with him, too.

1335
01:21:11,493 --> 01:21:14,913
I don't get paid much,
but he does understand me.
