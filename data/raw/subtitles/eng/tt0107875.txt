00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:31,280
Subtransl.ed balloumowgly

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,480
A magic ball

3
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:57,730
Subtransl.ed balloumowgly

4
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,160
It was quiet that day in the kingdom...

5
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,760
The air was heavy and began to surround the castle

6
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,840
I set off even though I knew I was leaving...

7
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
in danger his daughter, Princess Irene...

8
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,240
But the bad situation in the country forced me to do this...

9
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,920
Guard... before

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,840
Through the mountains... let's go

11
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,280
I thought
those old walls would be strong enough to protect my baby.

12
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,600
After all, Irena was always safe...

13
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,000
.
...safe in the hands of her loyal good...

14
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,280
Ugh...

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,200
Irena, Princess Irena.

16
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,200
Irena!

17
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,600
Come on, I know you're in there somewhere.

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,760
But well, I'll have to wait.

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,920
Oh, it's a little girl
pretty, a real royal, so how could she not when she's a princess.

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,000
No, Terlip, no, you can't do that.

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,920
You know Luti, she's always dealing with weird stuff.

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,320
Strange things, you never know what might happen.

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,520
Her father told me: take care of her!

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,600
It's late, I have to find...

25
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,000
It's okay, I think
he's sleeping. Come on, Terlip.

26
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,920
Terlip I found it!

27
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,640
Come on, Mr. Worm.
It won't hurt your insanity.

28
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,000
Terlip, oh Terlip!

29
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,110
No!

30
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,400
Angry, help me!

31
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,240
Luti!

32
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,720
Oh, where are we!?

33
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,760
I wish Luti was here.

34
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,720
Hello, who is this?

35
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,080
My dress, let me go!

36
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,880
Ooo, Turlip!

37
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,480
Oh, someone's here.

38
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,000
Who is this?

39
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,440
Look Turlip, it's a boy!

40
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,360
Are you all right?

41
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,040
A gandi.

42
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,400
You look good.

43
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,080
I was scared, that's all.

44
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,880
Scared?  You don't have to be afraid anymore.

45
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,200
There is one thing they can't stand, it's a song, they hate music.

46
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,800
You see,
you do this when you see a leprechaun or some of their pets.

47
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,200
Goblins, pets!?

48
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,880
Yes, everyone knows
about leprechauns and their pets, except the people at the castle.

49
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh!?

50
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,440
You're from the castle, aren't you?

51
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,720
Yes.

52
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,480
And you don't know the way back?!

53
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,230
No.

54
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,120
Typical.  Come on, follow me.

55
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
These goblins aren't so bad, if you know how to treat them.

56
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,920
But they were horrible!

57
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,760
Hey
well, they're actually a little creepy, but you shouldn't have run...

58
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
...to face them and sing.

59
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,320
But singing doesn't always work down there.

60
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,840
Where downstairs?

61
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,440
Down in me.

62
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,760
In me?!

63
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,280
Yes, that's where they live, where my father works.

64
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,560
They don't teach you anything in that castle

65
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,600
Of course they teach me to read, write, count...

66
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,640
Count!
Great, that'll really help you against the goblins...

67
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,280
..at least you'll know how to count them.

68
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,000
Irena!

69
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Irena!

70
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,000
Angry, God, he cares about me.

71
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,760
Well, I'll leave you to it, you'll be safe now, see you...

72
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,440
Irena.

73
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,590
See you Irena.

74
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,920
Let me kiss you in gratitude.

75
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,760
Kiss me?

76
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,040
Princess Irene, what are you doing?

77
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,760
Princess!  You didn't tell me you were a princess!

78
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,720
You didn't even ask.

79
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,320
Well, I have to go now, I need me home.

80
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,520
Irena, there you are.

81
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,000
Wait, you didn't tell me your name!

82
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,480
Kurzi, my name is Kurdy!

83
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,200
Kurds.

84
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Oh, princess, you silly.

85
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,840
The fight, it was awful, some goblin creatures were chasing us.

86
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,160
Goblin creatures!?  Nonsense!

87
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,320
- but Luti is true!
"Don't be mad at me, you've been disobedient".

88
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,080
.so you're leaving, something might have happened!

89
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,080
But Luti, something happened...

90
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,680
So princess, what are you going to do... uh... uh...

91
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,520
Help!

92
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,640
Irena, Irena, where are you?

93
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,160
Hi Luti.
Don't worry, I'll help you.

94
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Come on, get up.

95
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,960
Uh-oh.

96
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,880
You know, you should be more careful.

97
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,200
And what are you going to do today?

98
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,880
Luta, I can play...

99
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,720
No, you can't.  Not after last night!

100
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
But Luti, now I know what to do if I meet a leprechaun.

101
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,680
Don't tell me about
leprechauns. They don't exist.

102
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,080
Are you hurt?

103
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,040
You know Luti, you work so hard.
Why don't you rest, I'll be fine.

104
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,760
Well, yeah, maybe you're right.

105
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,880
But don't sneak up on me and see that boy.

106
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,200
Terlip, Terlip, where are you?

107
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,720
How did you get there?!

108
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,280
Use.  Magic door.

109
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,960
Oh, Terlip, it's okay, I'm here now.

110
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,440
Now, what have you got?

111
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,000
Turlip!  Come on, scaredy-cat.

112
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,720
Okay.  Then I'm going alone.

113
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,240
Oh... It's just a pigeon.

114
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,960
What kind of noise is it?

115
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,280
Anybody there?

116
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,120
Who is this?  Does she look that weird?!

117
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,080
You don't have to be afraid of me.

118
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,560
How does he know my name?

119
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,560
I know your name because it's the same as mine, Irena.

120
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,760
I don't want
to talk to you. Luti told me never to talk to strangers.

121
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,520
But I'm your great-great-great-grandmother.

122
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,560
I don't have a great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother!

123
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,600
I'm not as great as you say.

124
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
You must be very old.

125
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,320
O da.

126
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,760
Older than you can imagine.

127
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,040
If you are
really my great-great-grandmother, then why didn't they tell me about you?

128
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,840
Not everyone knows I'm here.

129
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,000
I mean, you're not a real person.

130
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,250
Okay.

131
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,440
You're not just a dream, are you, Grandma?!

132
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,680
Oh!  You're not!  Then you must be... a ghost!

133
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,720
So you shouldn't be afraid.

134
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm not really a ghost,
but I'm not real either.

135
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,600
You mean you're some kind of magic?

136
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,560
Yes, in a way.

137
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,560
Like a rose on a window that turns into a flame.

138
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,360
I put that rose there to bring you to me.

139
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,960
I thought you might need my help.

140
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,920
Oh, sometimes I really need help, Grandma.

141
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,560
Luti is very kind, but she doesn't know how to help me with my homework.

142
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,520
I didn't mean this kind of help!

143
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,240
So what kind of help did you mean?

144
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,760
We all need help when we have problems.

145
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,840
Am I in trouble, Grandma?

146
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,120
I feel like you'll soon be my baby.

147
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,960
But remember,
I'll be here when you need me, but you won't always be able to see me.

148
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,680
Irena!

149
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,840
Irena!  Where is that girl?

150
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,200
Grandma, Grandma, where are you?

151
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,880
Irena!
Oh, that girl's gonna be in trouble when I find her.

152
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,200
Oh, that princess is so weird...

153
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,720
..what to do with the boy
that boy and the leprechaun stories, and those hidden things, to die of worry!

154
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,240
Oh, three more steps, but I promised the king I'd take care of her...

155
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,520
...no one would harm the princess, she's still a child...

156
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,600
Poor child, without a mother...

157
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,240
O,
these stairs, it's a problem in castles... too many stairs... oh...

158
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,480
Princess Irena!

159
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,880
Are you looking for me?

160
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,440
What!?  Where have you been naughty princess!

161
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,240
I had to visit my grandmother.

162
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,760
But you don't have a grandmother.

163
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,720
...so I sang as loud as I could, like you told me to...

164
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,720
..and then they all ran away and hid...

165
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,760
...and we sang louder and louder, and those skinny little monsters...

166
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,840
... to
ran off and left that girl alone, pretending to be a princess.

167
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,800
Princess!?

168
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,550
Yes.

169
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,840
That was extremely brave, son.
But watch out for those goblins...

170
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,240
... are very bad.
If they want something, nothing will stop them, not even your song.

171
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,040
Rest Kurdy, you don't have to do this.

172
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,200
- is fine.

173
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,720
No, no, really.
It's hard for someone your age.

174
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
What is this?

175
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,240
Where is that noise coming from?

176
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,560
Where are they?

177
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,320
Oh no.  Leprechauns.

178
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,400
- Hey, Glaub, are you hurt?
- No, I don't believe in Map.

179
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,400
He just hit my head, he, he...

180
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,200
- his head?!
- Just your head?! What a shame...

181
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,800
... to at least hit you somewhere
that hurts, so you can't work...

182
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,200
So I reported you to Prince Foglib!

183
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,920
Get up, get up!

184
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,440
Oh, poor creature.

185
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,720
And Prince Froglib likes to do different things to people.

186
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,120
What things?

187
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,440
What things! What things!
What you're missing!

188
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,240
No imagination?

189
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,880
Of course I do.

190
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,640
So... which
is the most sensitive part of your body?

191
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,080
Don't be stupid!  My feet, of course!

192
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,600
So... what would Prince Froglib do with them then?

193
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200
Would you stand up!?

194
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,880
A date!  Meeting, in the royal cave!

195
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,960
Throw the Glaub stone,
we'd better go! Quickly!

196
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,600
And then we'd be... aaa...ooo...

197
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,000
- they sunk their mines, you idiot!

198
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,480
Oh, yeah, sink... aaaa... aaa...

199
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,640
- I know. I'd sink their mines!
- Well, that's what he meant.

200
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,800
Silence!

201
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,960
Thank you
Dear .... I meant that we will...aaa...

202
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,120
- Let's get rid of the people, you idiot!

203
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,000
Yes, that we'll get rid of people... uh...

204
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,760
No!  It's not enough!

205
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,480
Oh, this is Prince Froglib!

206
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,560
- What do you mean it's not enough?
- Not enough of my little monstrosity!

207
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,920
No
you told me I lived on the surface of the earth a hundred years ago!?

208
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,680
- and so is my little idiocy.
- but we've been expelled underground, haven't we?

209
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,520
Because on earth we were forced to help others...

210
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,440
...being nice to people.

211
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,550
Not possible!
How could we live with these people... 211... ...shy, scornful creatures...

212
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:51,320
... with gentle feelings and soft heads.

213
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,880
That's nice, son, but haaa... aaa...

214
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,600
Will you shut up a minute!

215
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,360
What the hell did you think?!

216
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,680
She is a very simple mother.

217
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,080
We should do worse than sink their mine!

218
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,400
We need revenge!

219
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,800
We have to go up and get them all...

220
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,440
... and bring them here with us!

221
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,560
And make them eat the dirt under their fingernails!

222
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,520
Ooo, what a mysterious prince he is!

223
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Yeah, but how could we... uh...

224
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,120
It is extremely simple.

225
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,560
First we should dig a tunnel.

226
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,360
And after that... that's very good...

227
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,040
What?  What will they do?

228
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,720
Yes!  Brilliant!  We'll... uh...

229
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,480
They will sink our mine.

230
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,680
But there's a lot of water there, people will drown!

231
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,520
I have to warn them.

232
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,200
But what was Froglib talking about?!

233
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,880
Some kind of plan!?

234
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,040
Goblins!

235
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,600
- Kurzi!
Thank God you're all right! Dad!

236
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,480
Daddy!

237
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,560
This is the king! This is the king!
The king is back! It's the king!

238
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,920
- Dad, Dad!
- Yes, my baby, I'm here!

239
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,520
Pier, get the horse!

240
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,120
I'm glad you're back.
Will you stay now?

241
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,640
- Of course.

242
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,040
Come on!  Let's tell me all the news!

243
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,200
I was up in the tower visiting my great-grandmother.
Her name is Irena, just like me.

244
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,080
- What?! But you knew it was there, didn't you!?

245
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,120
I didn't know it was there now.

246
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,240
But... then it must have been a dream after all.

247
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,080
No, it isn't. This is one of her pigeons.

248
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,760
Yes.  I'm sure it wasn't a dream.

249
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,960
I heard you got home late one night.

250
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,760
Yes.  I'm lost.

251
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,880
I was chased by some strange creatures.

252
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,680
Strange creatures?

253
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,160
Yes. The boy I met said they were goblins.

254
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,840
- Leprechauns!?
Here!? - Yes

255
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,720
And I thought they were just stories!?

256
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Then it must be true!

257
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,720
Don't worry your baby
I'm not leaving.

258
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,960
Garda!  Garda!

259
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,280
These are just mining stories.

260
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,600
How can you believe in something that doesn't exist!?

261
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,200
How will we know them when we see them!?

262
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,080
They might even attack us, nothing worse than that!

263
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,560
What did you hear?

264
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,240
What if they're creatures?
But... they don't exist!?

265
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,120
Help!  Help!  Dad!  Luti!

266
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,160
Thank God.

267
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,960
It's Grandma's spindle.

268
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,160
She said she would be here if I got in trouble.

269
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,410
Grandma!

270
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,040
I'm sure I heard the spindle.

271
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,440
Come on, Grandma, I know you're in here somewhere.

272
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,880
Come on, Irena!

273
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,670
My child, you're cold and wet!

274
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,360
I'll light a fire for you.

275
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,280
Oh, Grandma, that's wonderful.

276
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,480
Let's make more magic.

277
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,720
I didn't bring you here
to show you tricks...

278
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,040
... Come closer...

279
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,760
- Oh!
- Poor thing, you're hurt.

280
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,960
Yes.
A strange creature came to our castle and scratched my hand.

281
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,240
Strange creature!? In the castle!?

282
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,720
Turns out it's a lot worse than I thought.

283
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,240
Oh, Grandma, that's better.

284
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,200
It's time I showed you what I did to your spindle.

285
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
- for me!? - Yes!

286
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,040
- Oh, Grandma!
- It will protect you from danger!

287
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,520
But you protect me, Grandma, no matter how dangerous I am...

288
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,440
...you protect me with your magic.

289
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,800
Yes, but my magic may not be enough.

290
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,280
How do you figure that?

291
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,200
Maybe you'll need a different kind of magic...

292
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,200
... and what is in all of us...

293
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,120
To be brave!

294
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,520
It's more than just being brave, my child.

295
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,400
It's the magic of good against evil...

296
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,920
...right versus wrong...

297
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,200
... when
you do something you think is good, even if no one will help you with it!

298
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,480
But I won't need such
magic, Grandma! Because you'll be here!

299
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,400
Well,
yes, I'll be here, but there will come a time when you won't need me...

300
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,120
...because you will find your own magic.

301
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Here it is!  I've been doing this to you all along!

302
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,640
This is a very nice grandmother,
but I'm not very good at knitting!

303
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,320
This ball is not for knitting!

304
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,400
What a beautiful ring!

305
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,480
I really don't understand, Grandma, I thought you gave me a ball!

306
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,720
And I did, and you still do.
It's tied to your ring!

307
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,840
It's so thin you can barely see it.

308
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,400
But you'll be able to feel it.

309
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,040
Use it when you're in trouble.

310
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,000
You'll only find your magic if you follow the thread.

311
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,160
Just follow the thread.

312
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,920
If you tie it to a rock, you will always know how to turn around.

313
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,880
Careful, honey.
You can't wait till morning!

314
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,400
Okay, I'll leave at dawn.
But I really have to go...

315
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,320
... someone needs to find out what the leprechauns are doing.

316
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,400
He doesn't know those roads
from there. I have to go.

317
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Oh no.  We're out of heads.

318
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,120
I'm not going back until I find out what they're planning.

319
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,800
This is like a village.  Goblin village.

320
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,480
Goblins must live here.

321
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,640
Get that dog over here!

322
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,320
I told you... not until we sink their mines!

323
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,480
That was close.

324
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,480
That promises something!

325
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,680
What a strange tunnel!

326
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,120
What's up, man!

327
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,520
What is this!

328
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,120
She has... uh...

329
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,720
They call it fingers, stupid!

330
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Yes, and then we'll get rid of them, right?!?.

331
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,200
She's ugly!

332
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,720
We'll make sure that these creatures
are always covered...

333
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,240
...that our little Toad should never have to look at them!

334
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,720
Isn't that my little free thinker!?

335
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,320
Yes, oh yes!

336
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,200
But, Mom... aren't sunny people called sunny...

337
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,440
... because they need the sun!

338
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,680
Ooo, such intelligence and bad brains!

339
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,600
Then... if you depend so much on the sun...

340
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,360
...then he'll start to confront us.

341
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,320
Oh, what stubborn wisdom.

342
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
That's why I have to keep them underground here.

343
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,120
...until their heads grow like this...

344
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,640
... and until their skin grows and wrinkles...

345
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,600
But
I may suffer, but it will be for the good of all the goblins.

346
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,800
Yes!  Because who, who, who...

347
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,080
Because who ever marries Princess Irene...

348
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,240
... will become the king of sunny people!

349
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,560
Princess Irene!?

350
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,640
Weird!? Did you hear something?

351
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Ooo!  Sunny boy!

352
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,920
- Ah, get him!

353
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,320
- get him, hit him, hurt him!

354
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm just passing through.

355
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,960
Give it to me, please, give it to me.
I could torture him like this.

356
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,080
We'll think about it
later! Guard!

357
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,400
Yes!  Call the guard!

358
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,160
This is goblin hospitality!

359
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,840
I think she's a scared mother!

360
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,440
Scared!?
It'll take more than these goblins to scare me!

361
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,560
Come back, you freaks!

362
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,320
What a wonderful dozen.

363
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,920
Good stenographers!
Watch your feet!

364
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,080
Oh, horror, horror!

365
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,320
Run back!  Move!

366
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,440
All the problems you people have
sunny people are because you are soft...

367
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,200
...soft in song...

368
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,440
...soft at heart...

369
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,680
... and soft in the head!

370
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,040
But I can still sing.

371
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,400
Stop it, stop it, I can't stand this noise!

372
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,440
Subtransl.ed balloumowgly

373
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,360
Stop it, stop your insufferable sound!

374
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,120
Push that rock!

375
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,080
Yes! Capture it, hide it, crush it!

376
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,920
Don't worry, he won't be able to sing forever...

377
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,760
... in
soon it will be so weak that we can do with it what we want!

378
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,040
It's not worth it, it's not moving!

379
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,880
Oh, my feet, my feet!

380
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,400
You must
keep playing, whatever happens, I have to keep playing.

381
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Grandma!?  Is that you?

382
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,040
Follow the thread!

383
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,720
You'll find your own magic...

384
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,880
..if you follow the thread.

385
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,760
What!?

386
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,920
I was just dreaming.

387
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,000
This is Terlip, as Grandma said...

388
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,480
...we have to follow the thread.

389
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,280
But I have to go!

390
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:01,280
Oh, Terlip, it's you!

391
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,800
I thought you ran away.

392
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,280
Let's go, then!

393
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,720
Oh, Terlip, look.
Not like that!?

394
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,280
Don't worry, I'll carry you.

395
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,320
It's ice cream.

396
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,000
It's so scary.

397
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,520
Oh no.  Take a look at.

398
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,800
I'll never pass this way!

399
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,440
Maybe something's keeping him...

400
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,000
It's stuck!

401
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,880
Oh, Terlip, what do we do now?

402
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,520
I know!  I'll follow the thread back!

403
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,240
Where's he gone now?!

404
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,080
We'll never find our way out of this cave!

405
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,200
No!

406
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,400
Very good. We'll keep him in
in the dark forever...

407
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,600
..and then his head will become like ours...

408
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,680
...and the skin will become wrinkled and dirty...

409
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,600
No! This is stupid!
It's too dangerous!

410
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,560
If he runs and warns others!

411
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,640
No! We will
wait until he's too weak to sing, so we'll kill him!

412
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,040
But mom!  Please!

413
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,800
Can't we keep it?

414
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,520
I could torture him like that, I really could!

415
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,360
Patience!
Everything will be different when you marry that naughty princess!

416
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,800
You'll see...

417
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,680
... and then you can have as much
as many sunny people as you want...

418
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,560
... and do whatever you want to them!

419
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,600
Oh, great.

420
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,920
Mom, you're such a monster!

421
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,370
Sleep tight, son.
Good night.

422
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,920
You could take your shoes off
before you go to bed?

423
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,320
They're tough as nails... and I have... wow...

424
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,560
...OK OK.  Make yourself comfortable.

425
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,320
That's right!  That's what I should do.

426
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,960
To follow the thread through this pile of stones.

427
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,960
There must be a way through this!?

428
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,280
By that!?

429
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,560
That's that boy!

430
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,760
Not possible!

431
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,760
Are you Kurds?

432
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,760
- What was that?
- Kurds! Kurds!

433
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,920
- who's there? - It's me, Irena!

434
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,360
Irena!?  Here!?

435
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,080
Push this rock
to try to move it!

436
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,320
- But I already have
Please!

437
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,200
Hello, princess!  I'll try!

438
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,320
Kurdy, are you okay?

439
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,240
- I think - try again, it will definitely work!

440
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,480
Move aside!

441
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,960
- Quickly, you must
get out of here! Come on!

442
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,120
You're crazy. They're leprechauns!

443
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,520
It's fine.  I got a wire!

444
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,360
The end?  What thread?

445
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,360
The one my grandmother gave me, you fool.

446
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,480
Crazy?  Yeah?

447
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,840
You must have gone Nazi crazy...

448
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,360
... the goblins almost killed me and now I'm going straight to them...

449
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,320
... and all because of a
one girl. Irena, where are you?

450
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,160
This way!

451
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,120
Ha!  That's never been here before!?

452
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,560
Wine.  Wait for me!

453
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,000
Are you wearing your cat
with you everywhere?

454
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,440
Of course. He's the only friend I have.

455
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,640
Except for you!

456
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,560
- on me?
- We're friends, aren't we?

457
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,560
Well, I guess we're a princess.

458
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,000
Don't call me princess and I'm a human being, you know!

459
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,840
You are?!

460
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,120
What do you mean?

461
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,160
So... how did you find me, underground!?

462
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,720
... right in the middle of the mountain!?

463
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,320
Just. I just followed Grandma's lead.

464
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,160
Come on, please!  The end?!  Grandma!?

465
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,600
And how else would I find you?

466
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,280
You think the leprechaun told me?!

467
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,720
- It isn't, is it?
- She's not crazy.

468
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,120
You're crazy, you'll get in trouble!

469
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,040
But I'm just following the thread.

470
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,560
- Come on - but I don't see any wires!

471
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,240
- Wait, let's go back.
- No, trust me.

472
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,960
Turn around.  This is crazy.

473
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,200
Clocks.  I know what I'm doing.

474
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,200
Irena, stop!
Goblin king! See.

475
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,560
You brought us straight
to the royal bedroom.

476
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,440
Royal bedroom!?

477
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,280
Hey, just wait a
Wait a second! The queen's shoes!

478
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,560
It has six fingers.

479
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,040
Creatures
sunny! Guard!

480
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,880
Irena!  Run!

481
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,120
She's a princess!
Take her! Get her!

482
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,840
Yes!  Za njoooooo.... aaa...

483
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,640
- Come on. No! This way!

484
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,960
- What?
- follow the thread!

485
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
- Irena!
- Quick!

486
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,960
Wow!  What a descent!

487
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,440
- Are you okay? I think I did it.

488
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,480
Look at the Kurds.  Moon!

489
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,920
You see that the thread
has brought us back!

490
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,280
Yes, but we need to warn others about leprechauns!

491
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,480
Let's go to Grandma's, she'll know what to do!

492
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,730
Oh no!

493
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,200
When you see it with your own eyes
you will believe it!

494
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,640
Come on, this way!

495
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,560
Grandma!  I brought someone to see you!

496
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,920
- Well... - Here!

497
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,680
Now you have to trust me!

498
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,640
I don't see any grandmothers.

499
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,800
She's somewhere...

500
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,960
...she's...
she's just invisible right now!

501
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,440
Is your grandmother invisible?

502
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,760
Yeah.

503
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,960
...but she's here, I know she is.

504
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,360
Look, I'm glad you saved me, but I really don't have time for games.

505
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,480
This is not a game!

506
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,200
No, it isn't. I'm serious.
Leprechauns have a plan and you're part of that plan.

507
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,920
We can't waste time with invisible grandmothers.

508
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,560
You don't believe me, do you?

509
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,600
- Well... - but I thought we were friends!?

510
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,080
Friends don't lie to each other.

511
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,840
- I have to warn
King. - Let him go.

512
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,600
- Goodbye Kurdy.
- Goodbye... princess.

513
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,840
But I have a grandmother!

514
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,520
I have a.

515
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,040
Guard, guard!
I must see the King!

516
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,160
- Goblins!
- Stop! Who is this?

517
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,560
Get him!

518
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,640
Oh no!  It's a boy!

519
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,160
- it's not
my fault. I didn't see him in the dark.

520
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,720
- It could have been one of
those creatures. Yes!

521
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,560
Come on!
Help me get him inside!

522
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,000
But I was only trying to warn the king...

523
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,560
Bleeding... delirium... ugly wound.

524
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,880
I don't understand Terlip at all...

525
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,040
Grandma wasn't there at all when I needed her!?

526
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,960
Now Kurdy thinks I've been lying to him all along.

527
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,040
But we didn't, did we?

528
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,520
She exists, doesn't she?

529
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,960
She said I'd find my magic if I followed the thread.

530
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,800
That's right!  That's what Grandma thought!

531
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,000
He's not here because
he wants me to think for myself.

532
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,120
I have to find a way to save us from the goblins.

533
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,680
Come on, Terlip!
We have to find a way to save ourselves from the goblins.

534
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,320
Irena!  Irena!

535
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,240
Oh, that girl's gonna be in trouble when I find her!

536
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,240
Luti!  Luti!

537
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,600
So there you are!
I've been looking all over for you!

538
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,600
You had us so worried!

539
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,640
Angry, I want to see my father once!

540
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,320
But Princess, he's a very busy man!

541
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,560
- Shut up!
- and how things are in the kingdom...

542
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,040
...doesn't want to be disturbed.

543
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,320
Do as I say!

544
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,080
Bring me my father!
This is a matter of great importance!

545
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,200
- but Irena... - you heard me!

546
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,520
Give a message to the king, will you...

547
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,720
... and tell him the princess wants to see him.

548
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,200
- Yes, yes of course. Urgent!

549
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,160
- Yes, Your Majesty - Thank you!

550
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,920
Send to the king!
Send to the king!

551
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,280
So you're the kid
my baby! Where have you been?

552
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,720
Father, will you strengthen the guard?
We're in grave danger.

553
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,920
Why?  In what danger?

554
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,080
Didn't Kurdy warn you, Dad!?

555
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,560
- Kurzi?!
- You mine boy!

556
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,280
- But...but...but... your majesty... -Hey!

557
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,960
What did he want to warn me about?

558
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,560
About leprechauns.
Please believe me!

559
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,680
Of course my baby!

560
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,080
Strengthen the guard!

561
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,600
Strengthen the guard!

562
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,160
What kind of noise is it?

563
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,240
Sounds like little creatures scratching around underground...

564
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,880
... and that means rats!

565
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,720
There are no rats... it's the mountain, that's what it is!

566
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,040
Ooo, have another drink!

567
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,400
No, no, don't worry.  I know where else!

568
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,480
Shut up, you rats!

569
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,080
What is it!  You've never had wine!?

570
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,080
Drink little rats!

571
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,920
Be good or I'll leave the yard cats on you!

572
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,600
Leprechauns.  Stop the goblins!

573
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,240
Warn the king!

574
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,040
Hello Kurds!

575
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,320
You know who I am!

576
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:26,080
- Irene's grandmother.
- Yes!

577
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,200
Then you're real!

578
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,000
Don't worry.  I'm here to help you.

579
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,360
Oh no.  They're here!

580
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,120
Guard room!

581
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,040
I'm gonna need this!
I pray I haven't taken the princess yet!

582
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,800
Back!  Get back!

583
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,080
Great Terlip!  But where are the others!

584
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:41,440
Come on, boys, let's get you to your lovely princess.

585
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,480
Her room must be
here somewhere. Irena!

586
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,240
Irena!

587
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,680
- Thank God
Kurds!

588
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,680
What are you doing here?

589
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,080
The elves are here.
Stay inside and lock the door...

590
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:04,640
... I'll help them fight.
- Why can't I move?

591
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,120
No. Stay here where it's safe!

592
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,040
You'll be back though, won't you?

593
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,040
I'll be back.  That's a promise!

594
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,120
Stand up!

595
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,640
Step on them!

596
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,000
You have to step on them.
It's the only place that hurts.

597
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,400
And sing.
I can't stand singing!

598
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,400
- Yes! - Where are the others?

599
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,680
We tried
to drive them out of the kitchen, but to no avail!

600
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,720
They've got the king!

601
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,800
Let's go, then!

602
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,840
Step on them!
Step on them!

603
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,360
Take the boy
that boy! Here!

604
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,760
Ahaha!  That's better!

605
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:00,880
Come on, you naughty creatures!
Let me see you now!

606
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,920
Go back, you lazy bastards!

607
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,400
Rise up and fight you unfortunates!

608
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,720
You stingy bastards!

609
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,040
It hurts, doesn't it!!

610
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,640
back!  Or I'll cut your head off!

611
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,880
A little closer!  Just a little closer!

612
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,080
What is it?  Are you afraid...

613
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,440
...to crush you with my stone shoe!

614
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,960
Who is stronger now!

615
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,520
What is it?  No air?

616
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,560
What's wrong with you!?  Are you scared?

617
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,720
Scared!?
No! It's a stench I can't stand!

618
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,160
What!?

619
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,480
I'm stuck!

620
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,720
Get this off me!

621
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,160
Get them!
Get them! Redirect!

622
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,480
Goodbye, you insane people...

623
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,280
...but I'm not done with you yet!

624
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,600
Bravo young man!
Are you all right?

625
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,280
Your Majesty.  Your Majesty!

626
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,960
Rest a moment!

627
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,440
Irina's cat!

628
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,680
What is this? Where's Froglib?

629
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,080
What's the problem,
boy? What's the matter?

630
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,600
Where's the princess?
Where is Irena?

631
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,120
Princess!  Oh no!

632
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,520
No!  My baby!  Not my baby!

633
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,520
Where's the princess?

634
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,240
Where's the princess?  A princess?

635
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,280
Destroy the mine!
A message from the king!

636
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,440
He ordered you to sink the mine!

637
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,120
Oh no!  Water!  Here it comes!

638
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,200
Water!  I think the wall will hold!

639
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,080
Get out of my way, you rats!

640
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,320
What is this?

641
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,440
Your Majesty!  Get everyone out...

642
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,240
..is trying to sink the mine, but we've surrounded it with an embankment...

643
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,720
... there is only one way to avoid water!

644
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,000
God forbid!

645
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,720
And I can't find Princess Irene...

646
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,720
..she's not in her room!

647
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,800
Find it, son!
We've got to find her!

648
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,880
- Have you seen
Princess? - No! Why?

649
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,760
Out! Quick!
Drop everything and run!

650
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,600
I'll check the basement!
Everybody out or you'll drown!

651
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,640
Let's get out of here!

652
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,040
Who is this?

653
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,760
- Kurzi!
Watch out! Froglib!

654
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,920
Come one step closer and I'll wring his neck!

655
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,160
She's mine now!
I'm taking her back with me!

656
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,040
No!  Don't go down there!  You won't make it!

657
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:27,080
You eat!
Try and stop me, sunny boy!

658
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,960
But water!  It's coming through this tunnel!

659
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,360
Do you think I'm stupid enough to fall for that old trick!

660
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,600
I'm not stupid!

661
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,240
Have you seen the princess?

662
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,960
I'm not your majesty!

663
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,920
Maybe he's still inside!

664
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,880
Oh, Irena!  My poor child!

665
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,480
Water!  Oh no!

666
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,840
- Irena!
- Kurzi!

667
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,240
Okay, Irena, I'll catch you when the power comes on!

668
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,000
Current!  It's too strong!

669
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,520
Trust me!

670
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:07,760
Come on!

671
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,240
Oh, Kurds!  Thank you.

672
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,440
I told you to trust me.

673
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,680
- Attention, Kurds!
- Froglib!

674
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,200
Yes!  I've come for my princess!

675
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,920
What's the matter, boy
sunny! You can't breathe!

676
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,840
Stop it!

677
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,920
Look at it one last time,
princess, before I break his neck!

678
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,400
No!  Let him go!  Let him go!

679
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,200
Are you all right?

680
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,480
I did.  And you?

681
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,360
Yes.  Thanks!

682
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,240
Sorry about before!

683
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,280
For what?

684
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:39,480
Which I didn't believe.
I saw your grandmother, but I still had to trust you.

685
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,480
I knew he was following me!

686
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,960
Kurdy, do you remember when we first met?

687
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,710
Yes.

688
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,920
Well, I promised you something.

689
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,080
Irena!  Irena!

690
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,080
Dad!  Oh, Dad!

691
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,640
I never saw Irene's great-grandmother.

692
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,640
But I knew she was there.

693
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,000
She took care of all of us.
