1
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,121
Before there was light there were angels.

2
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,324
One moment darkness

3
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,923
the next, heaven was bright
with glorious beings.

4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,765
It was perfect.

5
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,884
It did not last.

6
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,159
Lucifer revolted against God.

7
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,401
A line was drawn in paradise.

8
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,845
A war began.

9
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,486
Every angel was forced to choose

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,442
the holiness of heaven or the chaos
that roiled outside.

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,042
One angel refused

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,319
believing the only thing worth fighting for

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,210
was a force we now call love.

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,410
Cast out of heaven

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,563
this angel did not fall alone.

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,684
Every angel who had yet to choose

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,526
fell in a flash of almighty fury.

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,202
These are the Fallen.

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,528
Exiled from heaven

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,524
they wander the earth

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,921
banished until the rebel angel

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,647
abandons love and takes a side.

23
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,525
That was then.

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,044
This is now.

25
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,742
Is that it?

26
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,820
Must be.

27
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Love you.

28
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
My baby.

29
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,282
I just wish I knew how to help you.

30
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,846
I'll be fine.

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Look here.

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
It's small.

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,131
I wanted you to have something
to open on your birthday.

34
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Thank you.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I love you.

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Bye, Dad.

37
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,051
Welcome to Sword and Cross Academy.

38
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,319
For over 75 years
we have served adolescents

39
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,405
who because of social and-or
emotional challenges that they face

40
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,844
have been unable to thrive
in a traditional academic environment.

41
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,325
At Sword and Cross
we combine college preparatory education

42
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,768
cutting edge clinical services

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,810
and diverse enrichment
programs that focus on

44
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,530
personal growth.

45
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,126
Where do you want him this time?

46
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Through there.

47
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,885
I'll be right with you.

48
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,486
Including

49
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,159
fencing, swimming

50
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,289
and the use of our world
renowned Fowler Library.

51
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,249
Our founder's philosophy is
based upon the core principles...

52
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,410
Now dump your hazards.

53
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,468
Hazards?

54
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,603
Alcohol. Drugs. Weapons of any type.

55
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,126
Gang related items or clothing.

56
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,251
Music players, tablets,
gaming systems, laptops.

57
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Cell phones.

58
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,961
No no no, I need my phone.

59
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:48,531
You get ten minutes of phone
privileges once a week.

60
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,324
- You're kidding.
- What's this?

61
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,729
- I don't know, it's a present...
- Hazard.

62
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,650
Haven't got all day, Randy.

63
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,956
I'll be right there. Arriane!

64
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,382
Could you show Lucinda to the dorms?

65
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,206
Sure, I got it.

66
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,847
You can pick your bag up after lunch.

67
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,325
So tell me about your weekend, Cam.
I'm all ears.

68
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,449
- Arriane.
- Luce.

69
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,162
We're going to keep him
on a very short leash.

70
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,322
There's no need
to press charges this time, Bill.

71
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,169
You know we've got this covered.

72
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,606
We'll keep a good eye on him.

73
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,086
You're going to want to stay away from Cam.
Yeah, why's that?

74
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,800
He's trouble.

75
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,245
Not the good kind.

76
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,449
Let me see your schedule.

77
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,689
Good, you're with us.

78
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,491
- Us?
- Prep-track.

79
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,800
We tend to stick together.

80
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,567
Most kids here are psych referrals.

81
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,547
They're lucky to get through the day
without wetting themselves

82
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:49,226
or attacking a teacher because their
pencils are unevenly sharpened.

83
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,801
Don't be spooked, though.
They keep them separate.

84
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:55,247
All the serious mental defectives are
up on the third floor.

85
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,684
It's one big pharmapalooza.

86
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,646
This is me. 208.

87
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
Where are you?

88
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,481
313

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
You're messing with me, right?

90
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,761
You're a psy...

91
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,041
(0K8)'-

92
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Hey.

93
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,767
Sorry.

94
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,647
Tell me about your hallucinations.
What do you call them?

95
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Shadows.

96
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Shadows.

97
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,887
And they started when?

98
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,531
When I was little.

99
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,887
Five or six. I can't remember exactly.

100
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,844
And you still see them?

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,367
No. I haven't for a while.

102
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,242
Tell me, Lucinda.

103
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,644
Why do you think you're here

104
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,605
at Sword and Cross'?

105
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,771
Ask the judge.

106
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,481
I've read your file.
I know what the judge thinks.

107
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,003
What I don't understand is your decision.

108
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,845
Doctor Segal says that
on medication, you're stable.

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,800
No hallucinations. No paranoia.
No nightmares.

110
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,850
I'm not crazy, you know.

111
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,921
No. Nobody's saying you're crazy.

112
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,845
Everybody's saying that.

113
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,170
Do you understand, that if you take
your prescribed medication you can leave.

114
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,399
Go home. Go back to your old school.

115
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,890
Be with your friends.

116
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,124
I don't like the way they make me feel.

117
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:59,762
But if you refuse, you need to be here

118
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,082
in a court sanctioned treatment facility,
under supervision.

119
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,044
Even if it means being locked up

120
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,920
I'd rather be me than pretend to be
something I'm not just to fit in.

121
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,887
You have a chance at a normal life.

122
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,691
Poor thing. She has no
idea what she's in for.

123
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,210
Maybe it'll be different this time.

124
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,341
You know something I don't?

125
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:33,145
It'd just be nice for a change, that's all.

126
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:34,551
Alright, let's make it interesting.

127
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,999
Twenty to one Luce goes down in flames,
just like always.

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,020
I'm in for a hundred.

129
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:39,021
- Arriane!
- What?

130
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,101
- Gabbe?
- It's cruel.

131
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:41,331
This isn't a game, Roland.

132
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Maybe it is.

133
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,241
Here we go again.

134
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,971
The mind is its own place and in itself

135
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,805
can make a Hell of Heaven.

136
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,762
What's that?

137
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,703
Milton. Paradise Lost.

138
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,722
- You're Lucinda Price?
- Yeah.

139
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:14,042
I'm Miss Sophia.
You're in my Philosophy of Religion class.

140
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,368
- Did you come for your books?
- Mm-hmm.

141
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,605
Pre-calc, English lit, Chemistry,
Religion and History.

142
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,082
Oh, still missing one.

143
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,691
Would you mind? It's in
special collections.

144
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Sure.

145
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,762
Ah, it's a pleasure to meet you, Luce.

146
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Thanks.

147
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Hi.

148
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,526
Hey, wait.

149
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,926
You dropped this.

150
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Shit!

151
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,926
You scared me.

152
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Alright.

153
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,965
You poor thing.

154
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,761
- Jeez.
- Oh, did you fall?

155
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Are you hurt?

156
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,245
- I'm fine.
- No you're not.

157
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,324
You've never been less fine
in your whole nauseating existence.

158
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,169
Coming here was a bad choice.

159
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,960
Listen, if I did something to upset you,
I'm sorry...

160
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,570
You make me sick.

161
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,042
You're nothing.

162
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,529
You bat your lashes and flick your hair and
expect the whole world to come to a stop.

163
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,626
You don't even know me.

164
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,862
I know you're a murdering little psycho.

165
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,199
Hey! Break it up!

166
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,248
Psycho bitch.
You should come with a warning label.

167
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,760
That was quick.

168
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,806
- She...
- Don't tell me she started it.

169
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,159
I'm sure she did.

170
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,242
But that doesn't mean
you have to take the bait.

171
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,726
You're right. I'm sorry.

172
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,161
Fighting is grounds for expulsion.

173
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,683
Which for you would mean
a transfer to the state psych hospital.

174
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,411
Is that what you want?

175
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
No.

176
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,605
Since today is your first day and I'm guessing
you've yet to read the code of conduct

177
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,604
I'll just give you yard duty.

178
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,721
And you? You come with me.

179
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,331
You know you're not supposed to be
in here without a pass.

180
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,007
I just, ah...

181
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,247
Oh no no no, that was a joke.

182
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,801
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

183
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Oh gosh.

184
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,927
Oh. Not funny?

185
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,402
It's just been a really rough day.

186
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,291
Yeah. Welcome to Sword and Cross.

187
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,243
- This place is...
- Crazy.

188
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,410
I'm Pennyweather Van Syckle-Lockwood.
You can call me Penn.

189
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,248
(0K8)'-

190
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,761
And you are Lucinda Price,
but everyone calls you Luce.

191
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,763
Transferred here from Dover with a 4.2.

192
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
Impressive.

193
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,046
How did you know that?

194
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,728
Shoot. Was that stalkery?

195
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,685
A little bit, yeah.

196
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,980
Sorry.

197
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:11,016
See the thing is, this is a really
small school. Like really, really small.

198
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,279
Like infinitesimally small,
and not a lot happens here.

199
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,484
It's not like Dover, and you're the new
girl and you're smart and you're pretty

200
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:19,456
so I'm guessing that you're going to be
the centre of a lot of attention

201
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,164
both positive and negative.

202
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Great.

203
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Tell you what.

204
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,247
I'm gonna go, let you do your thing

205
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,279
and then maybe if you're feeling
forgiving you can...

206
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,243
forget the whole me acoosting you
in the bathroom with too much information

207
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,616
when you just want to be alone and
then rambling on and on

208
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,364
because I don't know
know how to stop myself

209
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,316
from talking situation
that's happening right now

210
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,421
and give me another chance?

211
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,521
I'll go now.

212
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,984
- Hey Penn?
- Yeah?

213
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,562
Do you mind showing me back to the dorms?
I'm a little bit lost.

214
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Sure.

215
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,487
Thanks.

216
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,848
What if angels actually
walked among us right now, here on earth?

217
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,921
That's the story of The Fallen.

218
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,804
Angels cast out of heaven

219
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,327
condemned to live
their lives alongside us mere mortals.

220
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,531
Banished, because they
failed to pick a side

221
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:51,000
in Lucifer's war against Heaven.

222
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,966
Who can tell me
what the war in Heaven was about?

223
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Todd?

224
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,611
Good versus evil?

225
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,042
No, that's too simplistic.

226
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,479
Lucifer was God's favourite.

227
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,925
His brightest light.

228
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,010
What caused him to turn from God?

229
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,179
Anyone?

230
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,830
'Cause his girlfriend dumped him.

231
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,170
What happened to the other angels?

232
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,082
Those that sided with Satan
were banished to Hell.

233
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,602
Only the faithful remained in heaven.

234
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,530
The angels that didn't choose,
they were cast out.

235
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,170
They are the Fallen.

236
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,444
Forced to walk the earth

237
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,321
some of the Fallen
retained their angelic nature

238
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,291
repented and wait for the chance
to return to Heaven.

239
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,239
Others aligned themselves with Lucifer

240
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,811
finding pleasure in mischief and chaos.

241
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,841
But neither group can leave this world

242
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,208
because of one of their own.

243
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,729
The rebel angel.

244
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,446
He rejected both sides of the war.

245
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,719
God and Lucifer alike

246
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,486
all in his pursuit of human love.

247
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,410
The other fallen angels

248
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,209
must remain here on earth

249
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,207
until he chooses a side
in the only war that has ever been waged.

250
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,805
The war we still see every day
raging all around us.

251
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,931
But surely you learned some of this
in Sunday school?

252
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,083
No, I didn't go to church growing up.

253
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Really?

254
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,009
Yeah, my parents aren't really religious.

255
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,007
So, you were never baptized?

256
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,170
Um, no.

257
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,207
Is it supposed to be over, the war?

258
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,439
I mean, theologically speaking

259
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,005
if the Devil is still alive.

260
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:43,048
What's to stop him trying
from trying again?

261
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,923
Excellent question.

262
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,088
So, any more takers on that bet?

263
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,283
Yep.

264
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:07,850
Keep them rolling, Roland.

265
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,846
Luce, you poor thing.

266
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,326
Are you okay?

267
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,846
What is going on here? Is anyone hurt?

268
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,805
No really, I'm fine.

269
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,045
The food is fine.

270
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,766
- Anything?
- Anything, sweetie.

271
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,846
Definitely your orange cinnamon pancakes with
whipped cream with bananas. That sounds...

272
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Hey!

273
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,645
What's taking so long? Come on.

274
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Ineedit.

275
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,839
Mom? Mom?

276
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,481
Allocated time completed.
Allocated time completed.

277
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,931
I just can't believe I have to wait
a whole week to talk to them.

278
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,296
You know, I didn't even
get a chance to say goodbye.

279
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,243
You can have my time on Tuesday.

280
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,443
No.

281
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,805
Yeah, I'm not gonna use it.

282
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,881
I've been here six years.
Everyone I know is here

283
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,446
and everyone I'm interested in
talking to is in this room.

284
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,120
What about your parents?

285
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,651
I've been meaning to ask.

286
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,564
How I ended up here?

287
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,211
You don't have to tell me.
It's not a big deal.

288
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,764
Well after my parents got divorced

289
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,324
neither of them really wanted me around so

290
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:29,721
they decided that boarding school
was in my best interest.

291
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,481
And as soon as my Morn saw that brochure

292
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,564
the one with the kids riding horses
and swimming and stuff

293
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,862
that was it.

294
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:41,467
The search was over,
I was enrolled and here I am.

295
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,249
So you're not a kleptomaniac,
manic depressive, anorexic cutter?

296
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,481
No.

297
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,448
My diagnosis is much worse

298
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,524
and, I'm afraid, untreatable.

299
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,724
I have TDP.

300
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,966
TDP?

301
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,849
Tragically Disinterested Parents.

302
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,644
Yeah, my parents suck.

303
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,250
But there's a pool.

304
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,324
But there is a pool.

305
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,489
You've gotta be kidding me.

306
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,130
Don't tell me.

307
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,324
Is Cam in love?

308
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,243
That could make things difficult for you.

309
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,682
Just don't forget who you work for.

310
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,805
Daniel.

311
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,889
I didn't get a chance to
say thanks yesterday.

312
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Don't mention it.

313
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,489
Well thank you anyway.

314
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,476
There's one more thing
I'm a little embarrassed to even ask but...

315
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,706
Well then don't.

316
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,404
Well I've committed now.
I'm just going to go for it.

317
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:27,368
It's just you seem really familiar to me.

318
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,569
Like I know you from somewhere.

319
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,405
- Is that possible?
- No.

320
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,485
I'd remember you.

321
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,564
Because I keep thinking that...

322
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,568
I've gotta go, alright? I'll see you later.

323
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Thank you.

324
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,845
Hey new girl. Pretty
eventful first few days.

325
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,650
Already planning your escape?

326
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,688
Yeah, considering it.

327
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,201
You ah, you want some breakfast?

328
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,325
That's tempting,
but I'm actually running late to class.

329
00:25:10,326 --> 00:25:12,049
It's better never than late.

330
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,566
This is really good.

331
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,161
Where's it from?

332
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,561
I stole it from the faculty lounge.

333
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,088
They have a pretty decent espresso machine.

334
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,925
You're incorrigible.

335
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,841
That's what they tell me.

336
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,241
You don't agree?

337
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,686
I just know what I like.

338
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,767
And you don't mind
breaking the rules to get it.

339
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Well

340
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,368
if the risk is worth the reward.

341
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,366
I don't see why not.

342
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,959
What about you?

343
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,566
You don't end up
at Sword and Cross by following the rules.

344
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,085
You got a little rebel in you?

345
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,205
I'm just misunderstood.

346
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,086
No, I see it.

347
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,321
You got a spark.

348
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
What do you mean?

349
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,891
Means you're the kind of person who'd rather
do what's right than what you're told.

350
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,960
It means you're trouble.

351
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,683
You think you know me, huh?

352
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,805
I know what I like.

353
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
Time's up.

354
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,244
Roland's having a party this Friday.

355
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,479
- Yeah?
- It's just casual.

356
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,050
- You can bring a friend.
- Okay.

357
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,169
Bunch of us get together at the end
of the week to blow off some steam.

358
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
Thanks.

359
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,851
Aren't you in this class?

360
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,963
Oh, I've heard it all before.

361
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,684
En garde! Allez!

362
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,249
How well did they think this through?

363
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,121
You know, giving weapons to
heavily medicated teenagers

364
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:31,088
with poor impulse control and anger issues.

365
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,280
Halt!

366
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,960
Alright, change partners.
Sparks, you're up.

367
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,684
Price, let's see
if you've been paying attention.

368
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,931
Remember what I showed you?

369
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,521
Not really.

370
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,041
En garde!

371
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Allez!

372
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,086
That wasn't terrible

373
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,083
considering it was just your first time.

374
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Alright.

375
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,807
Switch partners.

376
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,004
Grigori. Come on over.

377
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
En garde!

378
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Allez!

379
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,601
Very good.

380
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,170
One more. En garde.

381
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Allez!

382
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,006
Grigori, halt.

383
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Halt!

384
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
Halt!

385
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,205
Both of you, halt!

386
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,370
I give it a week.

387
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,721
What about the whole baptism thing?
Could that affect her?

388
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,081
The details don't matter.

389
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:14,404
Grigori always finds something to obsess
over but it never makes a difference.

390
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,882
Now y'all just need to relax
and accept that Luce is gonna die

391
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,163
and there's nothing you or Daniel
or Miss Sophia can do to stop it.

392
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,210
I thought you'd never done this before?

393
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,481
I haven't.

394
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,689
My body just took over.

395
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,850
Like I knew exactly what to do.

396
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Huh.

397
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,565
It was weird. Have you ever felt that?

398
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:34,006
Yeah, I was kinda like
that with trigonometry.

399
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,162
It all just fell into place
so at first I was like

400
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,239
'wow, I'm a genius.'

401
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,404
But then I remembered that we covered it last
year so I guess that's not as impressive.

402
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,450
You got it bad, huh?

403
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,606
No, it's not like that.

404
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,686
Well, maybe it is.

405
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,083
It's just I have these
feelings about Daniel.

406
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,491
Like I know him.

407
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,608
Like I've known him for a really long time.

408
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,451
Yeah, maybe you guys
went to preschool together or something.

409
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,323
Well I asked him
if we'd met before and he said no

410
00:31:03,324 --> 00:31:05,402
and he basically ran away. It was strange.

411
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Yeah.

412
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,011
Something definitely not quite... hmm.

413
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
What do you mean?

414
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,590
I can get in a lot of trouble
if you tell anybody

415
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,156
what I'm about to say to you, okay?

416
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
I won't.

417
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,121
So I volunteer in the
office for my free period

418
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:24,842
which I know sounds totally lame
but is actually kind of cool and fun

419
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,569
in its own weird way, sort of.

420
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,843
Turns out Randy is totally useless
when it comes to computers.

421
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:33,730
So he asks yours truly
to do the most basic tasks like

422
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,526
find files on his desktop and search for
videos of sneezing hedgehogs or whatever.

423
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,011
Meaning.

424
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,484
I have full access
to everybody's academic records.

425
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,324
I've looked at Daniel's file.

426
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,491
It's empty-

427
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,844
He's got no home address,
no emergency contact, nothing.

428
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,126
- Do you like this?
- Yeah.

429
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,929
It's the same with all those kids.

430
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,016
There's just something not quite right
about that whole group.

431
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,756
You never hear them talk about
their families or their old schools.

432
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,227
They barely ever go to class and it's like
they all knew each other from before.

433
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,326
Wait, who do you mean?

434
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,481
Daniel arrived first.

435
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,279
He transferred at the beginning
of last year and then Gabbe.

436
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,256
The tall blonde
that's always hanging around him?

437
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,651
Yep, 85 percent confectionery
sugar by volume.

438
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,960
Then Arriane.

439
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,876
Oh yeah, she showed me around my first day.

440
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,564
And Molly. Serious defective.

441
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,204
And Roland, I have literally no idea
how he passes his weekly pee test

442
00:32:25,205 --> 00:32:29,079
and then Mr. Future 25 Years to Life,
Cam, transferred in last spring.

443
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,081
Miss Sophia, too.

444
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:33,209
She's new this year and totally ignores
everyone except her favourites.

445
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,236
Well what do you make of it?

446
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,830
Beats me.

447
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,004
- I can't believe it.
- What?

448
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,481
I'm actually going to one
of Roland's parties.

449
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,004
Oh, don't you two look lovely?

450
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,527
Thanks.

451
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,971
You do too. As always.

452
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,721
Aren't you sweet.

453
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,124
Is it wrong that I kind of hate her?

454
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,002
Why, because she's a flawless,
honey-scented, spray tanned,

455
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:10,885
bikini waxed manicured
blond-fembot who's always smiling

456
00:33:10,886 --> 00:33:13,326
and is at this moment kissing your crush?

457
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,450
Yeah, pretty much that.

458
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,526
It might be wrong, but I totally get it.

459
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,765
Anybody order drinks?

460
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,845
I'm still trying to figure out
how you ended up here.

461
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,604
Well you invited me, remember.

462
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,205
That's not what I meant.

463
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,008
With the rest of us it's obvious, right?

464
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,561
Drugs.

465
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,081
Vandalism.

466
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,481
Depression.

467
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,400
Nymphomania.

468
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,126
So why did you end up at a place like this?

469
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,401
Maybe I'm not as innocent as I look.

470
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,929
- Hello.
- Hi.

471
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,284
Is that a Flying Lotus jacket?

472
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Yeah.

473
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,048
You are such a hipster.

474
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,164
In... in a good way, I mean.

475
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,040
Like you know,
it's not like you're trying to be cool.

476
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,365
Like you're actually cool.

477
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Wow.

478
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,808
I've been accused of a
lot of things in my life

479
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,526
but never that.

480
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,759
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. Thank you.

481
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,827
Oh, is that for me?

482
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,948
Amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you.

483
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Sure.

484
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
Um...

485
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,886
So...

486
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,925
Is it from a show, or...?

487
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,564
Yeah. He's amazing live.

488
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,404
I saw him in Asheville with Teebs.

489
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,405
Get out of it. Teebs is my favourite
post-Dilla artist.

490
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:13,726
Well Thundercat changed my life.

491
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:15,882
Well no, except maybe for Thundercat.

492
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,889
Have you heard the Daylight remix?

493
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
That bass.

494
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,040
Exactly.

495
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,047
Yes.

496
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,846
Bad memories?

497
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,490
So do you still think about him?

498
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
Who?

499
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,847
The boy you killed. Trevor.

500
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,366
You know, tall, easy on the eyes.

501
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,720
Well at least he was before
he hooked up with you.

502
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,088
Now he's not so much to look at.

503
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,766
How do you know about him?

504
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,520
- I know a lot about you, Crazy Luce.
- Get that away from me.

505
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,243
I'll bet I know you better than
you know yourself.

506
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,464
For someone who doesn't like fire,
it sure does seem to like you.

507
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,480
That's enough!

508
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:10,796
Shut up, Arri, before I give you a scar
on your face to match the one on your back.

509
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,310
Back off, Molly.

510
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,524
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

511
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,067
What are you doing?

512
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,162
Just having some fun
with your psycho girlfriend.

513
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,929
Stay away from Luce.

514
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,507
You hear me?

515
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,224
Oh, you've lost track, Cam.

516
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,211
You always want what you can't have.

517
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,804
This time she's mine.

518
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,966
Lay off me!

519
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,844
There's definitely life in outer space!

520
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,365
Hey! Where's Luce?

521
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,602
Um, I don't know.
I thought that she was with you.

522
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,323
(0K8)'-

523
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,876
She doesn't need your kind of help.

524
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,306
Who's gonna protect her, you?

525
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:53,622
You know, you lovebirds need
to relax, huh? It's a party.

526
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,656
You know, I'm feeling pretty tired
all of a sudden, actually.

527
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,819
I think I'm just gonna go.

528
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,980
You want me to walk with you?

529
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,590
No, it's okay. You should stay.

530
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Hello?

531
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
Molly.

532
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,929
Molly, come on. I know it's you.

533
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,201
Where's Trevor?

534
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,601
I'm so sorry.

535
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,248
I'm so sorry.

536
00:39:02,249 --> 00:39:04,447
What did you do, you freak!

537
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,527
It's my fault.

538
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,806
I'm so sorry.

539
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,967
So tell me, how was your first week
at Sword and Cross'?

540
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Fine.

541
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,324
No incidents to report?

542
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,648
Visions? Nightmares?

543
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
No.

544
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,291
What about your shadows?

545
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Good.

546
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Good.

547
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Good.

548
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
What's wrong?

549
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,280
Nothing.

550
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,129
I just can't get past it.

551
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
What?

552
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,369
This feeling that I know you.

553
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,731
Haven't we been through this?

554
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
Yeah, but...

555
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,371
I don't believe you.

556
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,649
There is something between us.

557
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,004
And you feel it too, don't you?

558
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,845
Alright. Okay.

559
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,208
You're right.
I should have just told you the truth.

560
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,206
It's...

561
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,724
Like I realise I haven't been
very warm towards you, and...

562
00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:28,085
You've been a real dick.

563
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,427
Yeah, but believe me.

564
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:31,991
You've got to know
it's not because of anything you've done.

565
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,759
See, there's this girl...

566
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,761
Gabbe?

567
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,170
What? No.

568
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,921
No, not Gabbe.
No, just someone else. Another girl.

569
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,811
I guess you could say
I'm not with her anymore, but.

570
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,041
I still love her.

571
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,956
What I'm trying to say is...

572
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,460
You're a mess and I'm
better off without you?

573
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,531
Something like that.

574
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,086
It's not that simple.

575
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,243
You can't tell someone how to feel.

576
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Yeah.

577
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,690
I wish things could be different.

578
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,691
Hey! Don't go.

579
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,922
There you are. I was worried about you.

580
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,128
You left the party without saying goodbye.

581
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
What's wrong?

582
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,082
Luce?

583
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,610
Stop! Talk to me!

584
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,280
I had an interesting conversation
with Molly last night.

585
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,320
(0K8)'-

586
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,130
She knew things about me.

587
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,050
Things I haven't shared with anyone.

588
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,246
And...?

589
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,288
Someone's been talking to her.

590
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,084
Someone who's read my file.

591
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,724
Oh right, 'cause that makes perfect sense.

592
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:07,004
I betrayed your trust to a ruthless,
soulless, unimaginative bully

593
00:44:07,005 --> 00:44:09,890
with suspect hygiene and poor
language skills in exchange for what?

594
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,368
Oh, two free body piercings
and a prison tattoo.

595
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,489
I was sure I'd get away with it,
but you caught me.

596
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,484
Well, at least you're
big enough to admit it.

597
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,923
What's wrong? Really?

598
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,650
You have read my file, haven't you?

599
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,801
Of course.

600
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,686
So then you know about...

601
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,371
Your shadows?

602
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,321
Do you still see them?

603
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Yeah.

604
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,521
Do you see them right now?

605
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,002
No. But since I've been here
they've gotten a lot worse.

606
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,210
And I'm scared.

607
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,150
I'm scared somebody's going to get hurt.

608
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:47,451
No, don't be ridiculous.

609
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,527
I'm not.

610
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,764
Trevor was just standing there.

611
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,483
He was just standing there

612
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,927
and we...
- Okay. Tell me... tell me exactly what happened.

613
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,004
Trevor acted like I didn't exist all year

614
00:45:00,005 --> 00:45:02,367
and then suddenly at this party
he was flirting with me.

615
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,124
Come up to the cabin with me.

616
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,647
Just one time I wanted to feel

617
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,646
normal.

618
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,282
- You want a drink?
- Sure.

619
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Did you hear that?

620
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,769
Trevor, are you sure that we're alone?

621
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,120
Luce.

622
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,200
Relax.

623
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,480
No.

624
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,210
Stop. Stop. Get off. Get off!

625
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,003
- What the hell?
- Please, get out of here.

626
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,004
What's going on?

627
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,400
No. No!

628
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,080
Luce?

629
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,010
The shadows were bigger than ever.

630
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,440
And then suddenly everything exploded.

631
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,639
And I don't know how but I was outside
and Trevor didn't make it.

632
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,640
Trevor!

633
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,323
Where's Trevor? Tell me.

634
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,201
I'm so sorry.

635
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,942
I'm so sorry.

636
00:46:32,943 --> 00:46:34,981
What did you do, you freak?

637
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,327
It's my fault. I'm so sorry.

638
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,927
Trevor!

639
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,286
And he's dead because
there's something wrong with me.

640
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,282
And I'm really glad you
want to be my friend

641
00:46:45,283 --> 00:46:48,602
but you should stay away from me
because I'm dangerous.

642
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,084
Did you want him to die?

643
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,243
No.

644
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,845
Did you try to hurt him?

645
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,322
No.

646
00:46:58,323 --> 00:47:00,527
Well then it's not your fault.

647
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,489
You don't need to be alone, Luce.
You need a friend.

648
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,165
Let me help you.

649
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,480
Why?

650
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,123
Because that's what friends do.

651
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:31,207
Last time we were discussing how it was
Lucifer's pride that led to the fall.

652
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,960
Yes.

653
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,364
So who can translate?

654
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,201
Humilitas homines sanctis

655
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,166
angelis similes facit

656
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,564
<i>et superma ex angefis demones fan.</i>

657
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,841
Anyone?

658
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,287
It was pride that turned
angels into devils.

659
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:54,009
What was that, Luce?

660
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,203
It is humility that makes men as angels.

661
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,561
It was pride that turned
angels into devils.

662
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,566
We have a Latin scholar in our midst.

663
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,131
No, I've never...

664
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,891
It was just a guess.

665
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,724
So how does that relate to the rebel angel?

666
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,411
Wasn't it his pride,
his stubborn pursuit of love over God

667
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,245
that led to the Fallen
being trapped on earth?

668
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,041
Arriane?

669
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,285
I'm tired of listening to you twist these
religious fables to fit your own beliefs.

670
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,364
You tell this story of yours
as is love was a choice.

671
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,404
I don't care for your tone.

672
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,603
Maybe you're just pissed the rebel angel
chose the wrong girl.

673
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,966
Get out.

674
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,530
Gladly.

675
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,681
I'd rather burn in hell for all eternity

676
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:54,368
than have to listen to one more second
of your pious self-satisfied ravings.

677
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,799
That was kind of awesome.

678
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,867
Yeah.

679
00:49:02,868 --> 00:49:04,305
Do you think she'll get suspended?

680
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,962
I doubt she even gets detention.

681
00:49:05,963 --> 00:49:07,689
Those kids get away with everything.

682
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,399
Hey, I forgot my sweater.
I'll catch up with you guys.

683
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,400
(0K8)'-

684
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,124
Listen to me.
You've got to keep your eye on Cam.

685
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,806
What are you talking about?

686
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,679
I don't believe the statue was an accident.
She's in danger.

687
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,126
I saw him on the upper floor
just before it happened.

688
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,480
Why would he do that?

689
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,563
You heard. She isn't baptized.

690
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,489
She needs our protection. She's...

691
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,122
Sorry, I just... l forgot my sweater.

692
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,725
I'll go talk to her.

693
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,641
Hey Luce!

694
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,200
Wait.

695
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,920
What?

696
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,241
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

697
00:50:25,242 --> 00:50:27,208
I just thought maybe
we could walk together.

698
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,680
Oh.

699
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,806
Sure.

700
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,728
What were you working on in class today?

701
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,325
Nothing. It's ah...

702
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,242
sort of a graphic novel.

703
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,240
What kind of story?

704
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,489
I guess you could call it a romance.

705
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,364
Does it have a happy ending?

706
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,847
I don't know.

707
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:51,971
You don't know how it ends?

708
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,644
No, not yet.

709
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,845
I'm sort of stuck, to be honest.

710
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,326
Well let's hear it. Tell me your story.

711
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,442
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.

712
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,680
No?

713
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,609
Maybe I could help you with the ending.

714
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,040
(0K8)'-

715
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,964
It's about this boy and this girl

716
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,323
and they love each other more than anything

717
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,884
but they can never be together.

718
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,682
Why?

719
00:51:24,683 --> 00:51:26,170
Because there's this curse.

720
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,808
Every seventeen years they meet

721
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,885
and they fall in love

722
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,527
and then just when they're happiest,
the girl dies.

723
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,566
So it's a tragedy?

724
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,170
What happens to the boy?

725
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,041
He waits.

726
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,243
He doesn't age or change.

727
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,290
He remains in love.

728
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,441
Years pass, and eventually she returns.

729
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,201
The same girl?

730
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,566
She's changed.

731
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,128
She has a new name, new family.

732
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,005
She has no memory of him

733
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,810
but he knows it's her.

734
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,440
It's her soul

735
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,486
reincarnated.

736
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,569
And they fall in love.

737
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,807
Always.

738
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,049
I mean, each time it's slightly different.

739
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,283
There are infinite versions
but the end is always the same.

740
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,128
But then all it takes is a kiss

741
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,405
and she's gone.

742
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,005
Who put the curse on them?

743
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,004
It was the devil himself.

744
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,161
He was jealous of their love,
so he tried to break it.

745
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,721
There has to be something
they can do, right?

746
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,645
He's tried everything.

747
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,566
He tries looking for her

748
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,730
then tries to avoid her.

749
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,526
Tries to run away
from the inevitable heartbreak.

750
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,491
But the curse always finds a way,
no matter what.

751
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,810
The girl in your story.

752
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,601
Is she the one you mentioned at the pool?

753
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,405
The girl you're still in love with?

754
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,528
She's the inspiration, yeah.

755
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,326
This girl?

756
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,324
Alright, you got me. It's um...

757
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,247
I was using you for her
current incarnation.

758
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,244
This is meant to be Paris.

759
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,201
In 1723.

760
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,730
It's stupid.

761
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,601
Why me?

762
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,605
Because you're beautiful.

763
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,524
But I messed up the eyes.

764
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,441
There's always been
something about your eyes.

765
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,881
What's wrong?

766
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,280
Nothing.

767
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,367
Tell me about this place.
Have you been there before?

768
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
Does it matter?

769
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,291
- Yes.
- Why?

770
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,208
I've never travelled before.

771
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,482
I've never even left the country.

772
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,806
But I know that
there's a café just off to the right

773
00:54:34,807 --> 00:54:37,446
and I know it smells like
jasmine after it rains.

774
00:54:37,447 --> 00:54:41,729
And I know that the old man that runs the café
is kind to his dog and he's cruel to his wife

775
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,240
and I know these things
because I've been there.

776
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,164
And I've been there with you.

777
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,850
Oh, Luce, come on.

778
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,280
Don't.

779
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,123
Don't tell me that I'm crazy.

780
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,324
Luce, its' a drawing, alright?

781
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,243
It's a story, that's all.

782
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,601
You're lying.

783
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,527
I wish I could tell you
what you want to hear.

784
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,801
I'm sorry.

785
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,120
Blow.

786
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,211
Happy birthday, Luce.

787
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,161
How'd you know?

788
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,091
Did you make a wish?

789
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,604
I can't tell you. It won't come true.

790
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,290
Oh, that's okay.

791
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,484
I already know what you wished for.

792
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,640
Oh yeah?

793
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,086
What'd I wish for?

794
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,240
Answers.

795
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,491
You want the truth.

796
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,606
Meet me at the arches at eight
and I'll tell you everything.

797
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,880
And Luce?

798
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,531
Wear something nice.

799
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,805
It's party time.

800
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,001
Look at you.

801
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,080
Oh, wow.

802
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,607
Is it yours?

803
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,080
For tonight.

804
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,765
How'd you manage that?

805
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,323
It's Roland's special talent.

806
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,721
Anything you want, he can get it for you.

807
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,450
Am I going to regret this?

808
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,363
There's only one way to find out.

809
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,288
- Come on.
- No way, I drive.

810
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,091
You really want to start the night by
saying no to the girl?

811
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,680
(0K8)'-

812
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,370
What am I doing here with you?

813
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,880
Celebrating.

814
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,167
You're good at that.

815
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,162
Every time I ask you a question

816
00:58:24,163 --> 00:58:26,640
you have some clever
way of avoiding the answer.

817
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,200
That's not true.

818
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,001
Here's an example. Where did you grow up?

819
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,662
See?

820
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,841
How come you won't tell me
anything about yourself?

821
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,651
Because I'm having a nice time
and I don't want to ruin it.

822
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,290
It's that bad, huh?

823
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,241
I prefer this.

824
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,290
You promised answers.

825
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,042
Come on, Luce. It's your birthday.

826
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,647
I'm thinking there's something else
you might want.

827
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,006
What are you doing?

828
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,239
- Stop!
- I told you to stay away from her.

829
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,339
Daniel, what are you doing?

830
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,429
- Why, because you care so much about her?
- Stop it!

831
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:27,704
Stop!
- No, because I know what you're capable of.

832
00:59:27,705 --> 00:59:29,289
You're still with Lucifer. Admit it!

833
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,567
Why don't you tell her, Daniel?
Tell her everything.

834
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,007
- She wants the truth.
- Stop it!

835
00:59:33,008 --> 00:59:34,044
Just stay away from her!

836
00:59:34,045 --> 00:59:35,465
You don't have a say in it.

837
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,285
I don't know what's going on here
but it has nothing to do with me.

838
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,369
I never bought into that idea that
there's one person you're meant to be with

839
00:59:56,370 --> 01:00:00,763
but my visions are so real
and my feelings are so real

840
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,281
it's like past lives or something.
I don't know.

841
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,246
And everything's connected to Daniel
somehow but he keeps pushing me away.

842
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,562
And Cam's hiding something too.

843
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,841
So what do you think?

844
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,416
I think you're a jerk for not telling me
it was your birthday

845
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,762
but I'm willing to overlook that
because this is so ridiculously juicy.

846
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,610
Do you believe in reincarnation?

847
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,004
No. Not at all.

848
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,050
I didn't think so either but

849
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,686
there has to be
some sort of explanation for this.

850
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,400
Hmm.

851
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,047
Maybe I can help.

852
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,240
What are you doing?

853
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,364
We just need one more thing.

854
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,480
What?

855
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,841
How do you know which room Todd's in?

856
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,251
So how does this work exactly?

857
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,720
Have you got those yearbook photos?

858
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,082
Todd's been working on this really
cool facial recognition algorithm.

859
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,004
It's not all my code.

860
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,844
It was developed at Carnegie Mellon,

861
01:01:12,845 --> 01:01:16,003
but I've tweaked it a little.

862
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,930
He's so modest.

863
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,920
Sorry.

864
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,249
This might take a minute.

865
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,925
It's just searching.

866
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,805
Luce? Hello?

867
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,161
We've got hits.

868
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,440
Whoa.

869
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,561
Look at the name.

870
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,404
It must be a relative.

871
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,850
Oh, What?

872
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,479
The actual... Fuck.

873
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,241
Print it.

874
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,520
I'll get it.

875
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,364
Todd, I'm counting on
you having some sort of explanation

876
01:02:42,365 --> 01:02:44,601
because I am really struggling here.

877
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,529
I haven't got the faintest idea.

878
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,240
I love you.

879
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,568
Let's see what else we can find.

880
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,291
It's happening again.

881
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,760
No.

882
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,571
Leave me alone!

883
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,327
Luce? Everything okay?

884
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,120
Luce?

885
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,640
Penn!

886
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,850
I've gotta find Penn!

887
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,200
Penn!

888
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,485
Penn, where are you?

889
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,679
Todd!

890
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,170
I've gotta find Penn!

891
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,611
- No!
- Penn!

892
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,007
Todd!

893
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,121
Todd!

894
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,280
No!

895
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,999
Here at the school infirmary

896
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,129
we provide the same care
she'd receive at the hospital.

897
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,531
I want to take her home.

898
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:29,127
The doctor's clear. She needs to
remain under clinical supervision.

899
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,628
For how long?

900
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,906
Until she's stable.

901
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,446
You should get some rest.

902
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,329
We'll call you at the hotel as soon
as Luce is able to receive visitors.

903
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,689
There was nothing we could have done.

904
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,290
I refuse to accept that.

905
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,376
I could have warned her.
I could have been there...

906
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,522
When has that ever helped?

907
01:06:48,523 --> 01:06:49,839
It doesn't matter, okay?

908
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,729
She needs us and we let her down.

909
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,689
Is this a criminal investigation?

910
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,841
Not at the moment.

911
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,009
The fire was caused by lightning.

912
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,003
That report is preliminary.

913
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,487
Given the similarity to
the Trevor Beckman case

914
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,439
we'll definitely want to question her.

915
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,886
I don't want you talking to her
without her attorney present.

916
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,210
We come together today

917
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,962
to mourn the loss of a dear friend,
a kind and generous...

918
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,685
whose life was far
too brief to mourn the loss...

919
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,481
whose tragic passing comes
as a shock to us all.

920
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:35,521
We will always remember a kind
and generous friend

921
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,921
someone whose company was always a pleasure

922
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,290
and although today
we are understandably overcome with grief

923
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,762
I ask you to have faith that in time

924
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,806
our pain will prove strengthening

925
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,402
and ultimately a testament

926
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,201
to how much Todd mattered

927
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,209
and always will.

928
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,526
Not only was he a loving son

929
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,321
but he was also a kind and generous friend.

930
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:10,408
We must transform our sadness
into something strengthening.

931
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,007
That's how we celebrate his life

932
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,410
and ensure his legacy.

933
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,205
You show up to his funeral
after you get him killed?

934
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,680
I know you're the one doing this.

935
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,843
What are you talking about?

936
01:08:23,844 --> 01:08:26,127
The statue. The fire in the library.

937
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,403
You were trying to kill her.

938
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:29,129
Killing Luce is your thing, Daniel.

939
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:30,645
Don't you dare...

940
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,445
What's the matter, Daniel?
You afraid of a little competition?

941
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,685
What I feel for Luce is real.

942
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,730
She's different this time.
She deserves more than you can give her.

943
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,371
If you come near her...

944
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,400
You'll What?

945
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,328
How many times do you
have to watch her die?

946
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,331
I love you.

947
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,847
Luce!

948
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,047
Oh, Penn!

949
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,200
Luce!

950
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,680
Todd?

951
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,806
I'm sorry.

952
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,119
I'm so, so sorry. It's my fault.

953
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,451
Oh, don't say that.

954
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,285
It's true. The shadows
were exactly the same.

955
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,927
- It was the exact same...
- Stop it, okay?

956
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,965
You did not cause this.

957
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,771
I won't hear it.

958
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,400
(0K8)'-

959
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,486
I'm so sorry.

960
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,126
Did you make a wish?

961
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,042
Past lives and destinies.

962
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,690
You want the truth.

963
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,096
She doesn't know me at all.
All it takes is a kiss.

964
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,201
But he knows it's her.

965
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,302
Luce! NO!

966
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,269
Kiss him and you'll die.

967
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,091
Who put the curse on them?

968
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,201
It was the devil himself.

969
01:11:05,202 --> 01:11:07,407
Daniel, no!

970
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,245
Luce, no.

971
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,846
You will die.

972
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,241
You will die.

973
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,286
You feeling better?

974
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,042
Every part of me hurts, but I'm alive.

975
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,161
Well that's something.

976
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,486
I remember.

977
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,083
What?

978
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,100
Everything.

979
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,920
The fire.

980
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,920
You carrying me.

981
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,776
Being in your arms, it felt like we were...

982
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,131
Well you were delirious.

983
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,200
Maybe.

984
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,124
But that's not all I remember.

985
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,565
I remember this.

986
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,249
I remember the day this was taken.

987
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,480
What do you mean?

988
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:51,961
Enough!

989
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,930
I know what I know.

990
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,845
My whole life people have
told me that I'm crazy.

991
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,082
Luce.

992
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:12,684
Let's see if they're right.

993
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,090
No Luce, get down from there.

994
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,247
No, Luce.

995
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,086
No!

996
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,203
It will always be you, Luce.

997
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,644
Just as it always has been.

998
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,371
Now is not the time for sentimentality.

999
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,200
Luce?

1000
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,485
I gave you this.

1001
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,964
It was a long time ago.

1002
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,365
How is this possible?

1003
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,119
- It's okay.
- No, every bad thing

1004
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,990
that's ever happened to
me is because of that.

1005
01:16:08,991 --> 01:16:10,804
No, they can't hurt you. They just observe.

1006
01:16:10,805 --> 01:16:12,801
The fires. They killed Trevor.

1007
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:15,690
Luce, the shadows didn't cause the fire
and neither did you.

1008
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,569
They're called Announcers.

1009
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,080
Look.

1010
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,042
Think of them as windows into the past.

1011
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,203
They're attracted to
the most important moments in your life.

1012
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,730
What am I seeing?

1013
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,244
Our lives together.

1014
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,760
We've been in love for thousands of years.

1015
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,601
Luce, all your visions are real.

1016
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,730
So we're reincarnated?

1017
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,361
You are.

1018
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,881
I'm...

1019
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:15,921
An angel.

1020
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,409
I'm one of the Fallen.

1021
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,166
Stop!

1022
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,771
Don't do it, Luce.

1023
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,491
Kiss him and you will die.

1024
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,689
This is why I tried so hard
to push you away but I can't.

1025
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,046
You didn't tell her?

1026
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,080
I'm so sorry.

1027
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,407
Unbelievable. You're unbelievable.

1028
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,489
What? I don't understand, why?

1029
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,922
The curse is my punishment
for not taking a side at the Fall.

1030
01:17:46,923 --> 01:17:48,285
Luce, don't listen to him.

1031
01:17:48,286 --> 01:17:50,567
Stay, Luce. I chose you.

1032
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,406
Ichoselove.

1033
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,043
Don't listen to him, Luce.

1034
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:56,004
If you kiss him, you will die.

1035
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:58,726
- I've seen it a thousand times.
- No, this time it's different.

1036
01:17:58,727 --> 01:18:00,131
I promise it is different.

1037
01:18:00,132 --> 01:18:01,479
He's a liar, Luce.

1038
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,322
If you stay with me, I can protect you.

1039
01:18:03,323 --> 01:18:04,765
You've seen me in my true form.

1040
01:18:04,766 --> 01:18:06,039
This is different.

1041
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,239
I can protect you.

1042
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,480
This could be our chance.

1043
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,722
Please.

1044
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,802
Luce, I can offer you a future.

1045
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,120
A life.

1046
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,890
I can't lose you again.

1047
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,530
I know what I want.

1048
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,082
No!

1049
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,646
I'm still here.

1050
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,725
You think you've beaten the curse?

1051
01:19:06,726 --> 01:19:08,961
You have no idea how much danger she's in.

1052
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,161
Lucifer knows she's not baptized.

1053
01:19:11,162 --> 01:19:12,603
I don't understand. Tell me why.

1054
01:19:12,604 --> 01:19:14,841
He lifted the curse for
himself, not for you.

1055
01:19:14,842 --> 01:19:16,203
He'll come for her now.

1056
01:19:16,204 --> 01:19:17,804
Daniel can't protect you, Luce.

1057
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,280
I can!

1058
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,045
She's safer with me!

1059
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,808
There's a natural order to things, Daniel.

1060
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,405
You can't just do as you please.

1061
01:19:28,406 --> 01:19:30,164
Well the cycle's been broken.

1062
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,210
Roland! Molly!

1063
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,046
Luce!

1064
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,441
You're coming with me!

1065
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,448
Keep her safe. I need to deal with Cam.

1066
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,560
Where I'm taking her,
I don't want him to follow.

1067
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,963
He'll lead Lucifer right to us.

1068
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,365
They're all angels.

1069
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,962
I won't let you take her to Lucifer!

1070
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,490
I don't answer to him anymore.

1071
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,321
You're the one putting
her in danger, Daniel.

1072
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,248
Don't pretend you even care about her!

1073
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,446
Where are you going?

1074
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,999
I can protect her.

1075
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,411
Stay away from her!

1076
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:21,966
What the heck!

1077
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,282
Back to your rooms. Shut the door!

1078
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,885
This is a lockdown.

1079
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,845
Wait for the all clear.

1080
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,610
It's a lockdown. Shut the door.

1081
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,122
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not.

1082
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,011
I'm not your enemy.

1083
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,324
I'm not trying to kill her.

1084
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,760
Then who?

1085
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,886
Luce! Wait!

1086
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,403
She set the fire in the library. She...

1087
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:14,640
Penn?

1088
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,640
No!

1089
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:21,245
No!

1090
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,640
Go!

1091
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:27,727
Luce, your time has come.
I am tired of waiting.

1092
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,725
This ends now.

1093
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,521
Every breath you take keeps Daniel
from his rightful place in heaven!

1094
01:22:33,522 --> 01:22:35,921
- Daniel!
- You are the real curse.

1095
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,365
Luce!

1096
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,400
Luce!

1097
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,810
Sophia, what have you done?

1098
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,405
You claim to be a servant of God.

1099
01:22:44,406 --> 01:22:46,323
I am. There's a war going on.

1100
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,439
Loyal soldiers do what they must.

1101
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,507
Including murder?

1102
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,727
You refuse to see the bigger picture.

1103
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,450
You always have.

1104
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,442
With her gone you'd have been
forced to choose a side

1105
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,446
and order would have been restored.

1106
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,240
Thank you.

1107
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,041
I don't understand why she'd do that.

1108
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,165
She's a fanatic, Luce.

1109
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,104
She fights for god, but she went too far.

1110
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:15,604
Why would Sophia kill Penn?

1111
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,011
Why did she try to kill me?

1112
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,368
You're not baptized.
If you die, it'll be forever.

1113
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,123
Sophia thought with you gone
I'd have no reason to stay on earth

1114
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,690
and I'd return to heaven.

1115
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:26,961
But Cam was right.

1116
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,169
Lucifer will be coming for you.

1117
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,722
Which is why I need to
get you somewhere safe.

1118
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,451
I know a place. I have friends there.
They'll protect us.

1119
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,681
We have to go.

1120
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,922
I can't leave now. I can't leave Penn.

1121
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,200
We'll take care of her.

1122
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,320
Penn!

1123
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,245
She'll come with us. Go. Please.

1124
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,040
Luce.

1125
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,170
They'll take Penn with them.

1126
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,001
There's no more time. We have to go.

1127
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,491
Wait a minute. Listen.

1128
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,601
My whole life I've been
searching for the truth.

1129
01:23:57,602 --> 01:23:59,443
I've been trying to figure out who I am.

1130
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,730
Why I never seem to fit in to the life
that was supposed to be mine.

1131
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,490
And now I'm terrified.

1132
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,923
I have more questions than
I ever have before

1133
01:24:06,924 --> 01:24:08,968
but... this is it.

1134
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,645
This is who I am.

1135
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,970
This is where I belong.

1136
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,090
Right here, with you.

1137
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,446
I love you.

1138
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,047
I've known it from the
first moment I saw you.

1139
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,929
It will always be you, Luce.

1140
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,361
Forever.
