1
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:41,614
My name is Daphne Reynolds
and I was born in New York City.

2
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:47,018
I´ve lived my whole life with my mom
in a fifth-floor walkup in Chinatown.

3
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:51,525
It´s always been just the two of us,
me and Libby.

4
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:55,362
But every year on my birthday
I´d make a wish.

5
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,864
Make a wish, baby!

6
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,728
That someone else could be there too.

7
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,704
And every year when he didn ´t come...

8
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,275
...I´d ask my mom to tell me
the same story.

9
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:15,507
You never get tired of this one,
do you? Okay.

10
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,482
Once upon a time...

11
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:21,590
... there was a young,
very cool singer named Libby...

12
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:25,250
... who one day decided to go out
and see the world.

13
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:37,098
Little did she know that in the deserts
of Morocco fate was waiting for her...

14
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:45,237
...and his name was Henry.

15
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:57,754
They fell madly, passionately,
hopelessly in love...

16
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:02,659
...and were married
by the chief of a Bedouin tribe.

17
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:13,234
Henry brought her to England to meet
his family so they could get married for real.

18
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:18,948
But fate was not so kind this time.

19
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,107
She was definitely not
what they were expecting.

20
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:29,287
But when Henry´s father suddenly died...

21
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,589
...Libby knew there ´d be more pressure
on him to lead a certain kind of life...

22
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:37,130
...because he was now Lord Dashwood...

23
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,133
...and Libby was no one ´s idea of a lady.

24
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,431
Henry knows all about it.
If you love him, you will go now.

25
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,667
I think you should see this.

26
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,281
Apparently there´s someone else.

27
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:04,622
So even though it broke her heart,
she knew she had to leave him.

28
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:13,925
But a few months later, fate
gave her the greatest gift of all:

29
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:18,199
A beautiful baby girl named Daphne.

30
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,870
Sweet dreams, kiddo.

31
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:24,605
-Love you.
-Love you.

32
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,349
I can ´ t believe you ´ re 1 5 years old today.

33
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,929
Sweet dreams, Henry.

34
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:52,303
On my 1 7th birthday,
Mom and I had to work.

35
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,376
But it turned out to be
where my story really began.

36
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,911
You delivering something?

37
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:01,209
Yeah, about three hours
of watered-down rock and roll...

38
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,215
...and one very late waitress.

39
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,718
Sorry.

40
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,015
Watch your head.

41
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,886
Are you related?

42
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,226
-Can I park it?
-Yeah, over there.

43
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:29,668
How could he do this to me?
It´ s our wedding day! Where is he?

44
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:34,180
What? I should know?
20 minutes and she´s lost him already.

45
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,874
Very funny.

46
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,681
Hey, how you doing?

47
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,795
I´m sorry, can I borrow this? Thanks.

48
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:58,600
Thanks.

49
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:03,979
Sorry about this.
Come on, big guy, wakey-wakey.

50
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:10,313
Help! Ma!

51
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:15,650
-lt´s cold and I can´t get it out!
-Shout!

52
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,883
Shout!

53
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,918
-Are you done with this, sir?
-Oh, thanks.

54
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,456
Daphne?

55
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,659
-Noelle!
-What are you doing here?

56
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,854
I´m clearing the chicken cacciatore.

57
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:57,591
Oh, my God, that is so funny!

58
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:02,363
Guess what? I´m interning at Jenkins
and Taylor before I go to Duke, pre-law.

59
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,905
-What´s up next for you?
-The dessert, a selection of sorbets.

60
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:10,535
-No, where are you going to college?
-The University of the Undecided.

61
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,048
Is that in Ohio?

62
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:15,479
Yeah.

63
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,642
Undecided, Ohio.

64
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,052
Well, I guess I better be going.
But say hey to Jenkins. And Taylor.

65
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:25,126
-But--
-lf everyone would clear the dance floor...

66
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:29,094
...the bride and her father
would like to share a special dance.

67
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,649
-I know. I saw the look.
-I don´t want to talk about it.

68
00:08:55,818 --> 00:09:00,517
Every time we do these weddings, Mom,
I see the father-daughter dances.

69
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,021
I just--

70
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:06,184
I can´t help but think that
l´m never gonna get to do that.

71
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:10,321
I know you think you´re doing the
right thing by keeping me from him--

72
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:14,528
I was trying to protect you
from getting hurt the same way I was.

73
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,296
You left him, remember?

74
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,464
It´s not like he jumped on a plane
and came after me.

75
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,100
Maybe he would have
if he knew I existed.

76
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:30,117
-lt´s not that simple.
-Why can´t you understand, Mom?

77
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:33,483
I feel like half of me is missing.

78
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:38,150
And without the other half, how am
I supposed to know who I really am?

79
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,525
Daph.

80
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:46,032
Getting to know someone because
they share the same DNA isn´t the answer.

81
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,537
It´s about getting to know yourself.

82
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,943
Come on, let´s go steal some leftovers.
Lasagna looks great.

83
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:03,279
I love you a million Swedish fish.

84
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,721
I love you a million red M&M´s.

85
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,429
Taxi!

86
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,439
-Where to, miss?
-JFK, Virgin Atlantic.

87
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:04,772
No problem.

88
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:08,348
Maybe the answer was taking
a year or two off before college...

89
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:11,509
...to find out what I´m supposed
to do with my life.

90
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:16,314
But deep down,
I think I´ve always known...

91
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,694
... what I really need more than anything
else in the world is to find him...

92
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,094
... to find my dad.

93
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:28,702
Mom, you always said it was up to me
to write the rest of my story...

94
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:31,704
...but you ´ve been writing it for me,
Mom.

95
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:35,376
Now it has to be my turn.

96
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:45,153
-Can I borrow that for a sec?
-Sure.

97
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:32,664
Great Britain Grand Hotel?

98
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,393
What?

99
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,860
-That´ s not it.
-lt sounded really good.

100
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,161
-Thanks.
-ls that a Gibson J200?

101
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:09,327
Yeah.

102
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:13,703
-Are you a musician?
-No, but I live with one back home.

103
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,609
My mom.

104
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,380
So you checking in?

105
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,512
-Day job?
-Yeah. One of many.

106
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:27,485
You know, life of a struggling musician.

107
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:29,419
Hey, lan, catch!

108
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:34,222
Come on, l´ll show you around.

109
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:39,128
So the kitchen´s through there.

110
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:41,235
Common room´s down the hall.

111
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:45,601
I should warn you, the dog and bone´s
on the blink and we´ve no lift here.

112
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,175
Phone is broken.

113
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:51,040
Elevator, none.

114
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:53,181
Loo´s free.

115
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,040
Who´s Lou?

116
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:58,618
We better take this slowly.

117
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:01,847
Lord Henry Dashwood announced today...

118
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:05,357
...he was giving up his hereditary seat
in the House of Lords...

119
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,655
... to run for election as a commoner.

120
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,891
Why should an accident of birth give me
the right to make decisions for people?

121
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,092
-The only power I want...
-My dad!

122
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,003
...is the power the voters choose to give
me. That´s why I´m standing in this election.

123
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:20,334
Thank you.

124
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:25,276
Lord Dashwood, who will marry his fiancée
Glynnis Payne this summer...

125
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:29,247
... will also inherit a stepdaughter,
the lovely Clarissa Payne.

126
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:34,481
But this surprising announcement has sent
shock waves through Westminster.

127
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:37,888
He now appears to be
an unstoppable political force.

128
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,360
I admit, when you first suggested
giving up your seat in the House of Lords...

129
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:48,333
... I began to question your sanity.
But, no, this is political dynamite.

130
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:52,031
I had an eccentric idea we might
actually be doing the right thing.

131
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:55,233
It´s possible to do the right thing
and still be a winner.

132
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:59,677
The latest poll puts the party six points
ahead. That´s all due to you, Henry.

133
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:03,716
You´re transforming the image
of the party your father loved.

134
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:08,880
He would have been so proud of you.
You´re young, thrusting, idealistic...

135
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,650
...an impeccable reputation....

136
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:14,557
And a fabulous fiancée
with all the right connections.

137
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,497
Sorry to interrupt, but if I don´t steal him
he´ll miss his speech at the Oxfam ball.

138
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,660
-Oh, blast it, my speech.
-Right-hand pocket, darling.

139
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,698
She thinks of everything.

140
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:31,579
Well, gentlemen, that seems to be all.
Thank you.

141
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:33,977
You two enjoy yourselves.

142
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,378
How´s our boy doing?

143
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:41,990
If he doesn´t ruffle too many feathers,
he´ll be the next prime minister.

144
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:43,749
Excellent.

145
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:52,190
Ian, I don´t know if I can do this anymore.

146
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,835
Daphne, he´s your father.

147
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:58,167
You´ve flown halfway around the world
to see him. You can´t turn back now.

148
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,604
He´s got a family now, I mean....

149
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:04,803
You saw them, they´re so elegant
and sophisticated. It´s like....

150
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,409
What would he want with me?

151
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:11,019
-Yeah, well, you got a point there.
-Shut up.

152
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:15,045
It´s just not as simple as I thought.

153
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:20,525
Maybe I should just go home
and let him get on with his life.

154
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,357
Can I help you, miss?

155
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,493
Actually, no.

156
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,569
Thanks.

157
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:41,271
Perfect. Absolutely wonderful.
Thank you so much. Ciao.

158
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:46,381
You haven´t forgotten Lady Wrightwood´s
this afternoon, have you?

159
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:50,644
She is sponsoring us for the Royal Enclosure
at Ascot. We have to be there.

160
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:53,822
I thought marrying Henry
meant we didn´t have to try so hard.

161
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,082
I´m not getting married for five weeks.

162
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,419
Until then we have
to keep up appearances.

163
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:01,791
Look what happened to Olivia Dixon
when she went to China.

164
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,990
-Who´s Olivia Dixon?
-Exactly.

165
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,146
-Did you see that?
-What?

166
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:24,479
An impossibly large bird
falling off that wall.

167
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:28,180
Are you hallucinating?

168
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,076
These eggs are positively glacial.

169
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:55,842
When I run this house, senile servants
will be the first thing to go.

170
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:59,249
You´d have to get around the old bat.
She´d never allow it.

171
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:02,356
Anyone seen my pruning shears?

172
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:05,891
The old bat seems to have forgotten
where she put them.

173
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,068
Morning. Morning, Mother.
Morning, darling.

174
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,738
Everyone sleep well?

175
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:19,238
Apparently not.

176
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,600
There´s someone at the window.
I´m not hallucinating.

177
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,575
It´s those bloody paparazzi again.

178
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,079
Percy, call the police.
I will not tolerate this media circus!

179
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,190
-Where do you think you´re going?
-lt´s you!

180
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:43,422
How long do you people have to spy
before realizing there´s no story?

181
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,500
-You´ve got the wrong idea.
-Tell it to the authorities.

182
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:50,263
The real scandal is how young
they´re starting you guttersnipes now.

183
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:55,672
You sit down and tell me who sent you.
The Sun? The Daily Star?

184
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:01,612
Good heavens, you can´t be
more than 1 7.

185
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:05,580
Go on, take your picture and go away.

186
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:08,416
-I already have a picture of you.
-What´ s going on?

187
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,526
-Where the devil did you get this?
-From Libby.

188
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,927
-That singer you met on a camel?
-Why would Libby give this to you?

189
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:25,471
She thought l´d want to know
what my father looked like.

190
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,372
My name is Daphne Reynolds.
I´m Libby´s daughter.

191
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,440
According to this...

192
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,775
...I´m your daughter too.

193
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,178
Oh, for heaven´s sake!

194
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:44,257
Seems you had an even better time
in Morocco than you let on.

195
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,859
Oh, dear God.

196
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,759
I haven´t--

197
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:08,446
No, this is impossible.

198
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:11,051
-Must be a mistake.
-Exactly, a mistake.

199
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,880
This doesn´t prove anything.

200
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:16,821
This Libby must have written down
the first man she could think of.

201
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:20,919
You´re the only man she´s ever thought of.

202
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,191
Can I have a word with you in private
for a moment, please?

203
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,302
Henry?

204
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,530
You´re not going to believe her, are you?

205
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:35,033
Maybe l....

206
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,441
Maybe I shouldn´t have come.
This is a big shock for you.

207
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,548
I´m freaking out
and l´ve known since I was 2.

208
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:46,586
Don´t get me wrong, I mean in a good way.
I´ve dreamt about this my whole life.

209
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,348
Not that exact entrance, of course.
I imagined something more graceful.

210
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:56,458
I can see now
that it was probably a mistake.

211
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,431
I shouldn´t have come.

212
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:09,203
Sorry, did you just say you´ve known
about this your whole life?

213
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:13,641
-Yeah.
-Good. Now we´ve got that settled...

214
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:16,079
...how about some tea
and a piece of fruitcake?

215
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,981
Your mother didn´t feel I deserved
the same consideration?

216
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:22,123
-No to the fruitcake, then.
-How could she keep this from me?!

217
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:27,193
What happened to the mistake theory
we were operating on a moment ago?

218
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,523
No, wait a minute, ducky.

219
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:35,062
Henry, I know this has come as a shock,
but we can´t just let the girl go.

220
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:39,333
-Not until we´ve got to the bottom of this.
-Shall I call a hotel, madam?

221
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,442
And tell them what, exactly?

222
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,014
The best-known candidate in a generation
is requesting a room for a teenage girl?

223
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:50,845
-The press will have a field day.
-Can we leave the press out of this?

224
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:55,183
-No, Glynnis is absolutely right.
-Thank God someone else is thinking straight.

225
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:58,155
The girl must stay here, with us.

226
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:06,891
Darling, before we let this hypothetical
daughter blow your political career...

227
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:10,129
-...we might consider checking up on her.
-For what?

228
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,172
Criminal record? Blood type?
Triple sixes on her scalp?

229
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:19,143
Glynnis, she has a birth certificate,
she has my photograph and she has my eyes.

230
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:21,745
Only thinking of what´s best for you.

231
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:25,512
I know you don´t like thinking about it,
but the press can be brutal.

232
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:28,815
" Exclusive! Henry Dashwood
in Love Child Shocker!"

233
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,949
Actually, she´s not strictly a love child.
Her mother and I were married.

234
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:37,895
I mean, not technically.
It was a Bedouin ceremony in Morocco.

235
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,694
We planned to make it official
as soon as we got back...

236
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:43,497
... but for some reason Libby decided to....

237
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,367
Well, anyway, she left.

238
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,703
-Taking something of yours with her.
-Put a cork in it.

239
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:52,836
Maybe someone should have put
a cork in it 1 7 years ago!

240
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,178
Well, here we are.

241
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:17,328
Will it do?

242
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:22,341
Are you kidding? It´s incredible!
It´s bigger than our entire apartment...

243
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:27,778
...and the restaurant downstairs. It makes
the White House look like a McDonald´s.

244
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:31,510
I get the point. Now, why don´t
I send Percy to fetch your things?

245
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:35,247
-Thank you so much, Lady Dashwood.
-No hugs, dear.

246
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:39,792
I´m British. We only show affection
to dogs and horses.

247
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:42,252
Right.

248
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,933
You rock!

249
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,482
Hello?

250
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:09,789
-Libby?
-Henry.

251
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:13,394
-ls she there? Is she all right?
-Yeah, she´s here.

252
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:17,494
She´s fine. Mother is force-feeding her
fruitcake as we speak.

253
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,592
How could you not tell me
l´d fathered a child?

254
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,831
You let her show up
1 7 years later, unannounced--

255
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:28,942
And what?
Put a dent in your political career?

256
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,375
-No, that´s not--
-lf you´re afraid of a scandal, send her back.

257
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:36,779
It´s not about scandal, it´s finding out
I had a daughter for half my life!

258
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,328
Libby.

259
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,330
I didn´t want her to get hurt.

260
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:56,436
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Ask your advisors.

261
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:59,904
They´ve gotten you this far, haven ´ t they?

262
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:22,088
My point is that Henry´s strength has
been that he´s completely scandal-free...

263
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:25,825
...unlike his opponent.
This could ruin everything.

264
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,697
Have you finished stating the obvious?

265
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,964
Good. Then let me explain
what we´re going to do.

266
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,167
We give the papers the story,
but we spin it our way.

267
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,335
Let´s see what we have.

268
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,674
Yes, the Royal Dress Show.

269
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:45,720
Introduce her as the daughter you´ve always
known, but rarely were able to be with.

270
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:48,913
The press still gets a story,
but it´s cut off at the knees.

271
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,617
We are dealing with a living,
breathing 1 7-year-old girl.

272
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:56,696
The only thing we know is
that she´s an American teenager.

273
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,560
Hardly a promising start.

274
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:02,863
Still, what do you think, Henry?
Liability or asset?

275
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,405
Well, l´ve only spent a few moments
with her myself...

276
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:09,702
...but my sense is that
she´s quite mature for her age.

277
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,039
She seems well-mannered.

278
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,610
-Thanks, Percy!
-Your lunch, Miss Daphne.

279
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:24,350
I´d say rather self-contained, soft-spoken.

280
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:39,037
Perfect. Let´s run with it.

281
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:44,540
Ah, me. Please be Armistead.

282
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:51,475
-Dashwood residence, Clarissa speaking.
-This is lan Wallace. Is Daphne there?

283
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:53,780
She´s not here.

284
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:57,391
There´s no one here by that name, actually.
Sorry.

285
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:04,329
If you do happen to see her, could you
tell her lan Wallace is trying to find her?

286
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:06,797
Absolutely. I will.

287
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:09,726
Not.

288
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:36,558
-Daphne.
-Mr. Dashwood.

289
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,665
-Lord Dashwood?
-Call me Henry.

290
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,664
Henry. Okay.

291
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,432
-This is a cool room.
-Listen, l....

292
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,402
I was just wondering if....

293
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:54,872
I was wondering if.... Well, I don´t know
if this would interest you, actually...

294
00:28:56,351 --> 00:29:00,447
...but I was hoping you might accompany
me to the Royal Dress Show on Friday?

295
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:04,455
-Dress show?
-Yes, it´s ass-numbingly dull.

296
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:08,892
Some people I have to impress
take it frightfully seriously.

297
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,860
Is it like a fashion show?

298
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:15,059
Gwyneth and Madonna go to those things,
right? Do you think they´d be there?

299
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:19,605
I have no idea what you´re talking about,
but for me it´s a stop on the campaign trail.

300
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:22,675
For Glynnis, it´s a chance
to launch Clarissa on society.

301
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,142
Launch? You make her sound like a ship.

302
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:29,977
No, in Clarissa´s case it´s more like
an intercontinental ballistic missile.

303
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:34,145
She´s what in the old days
might have been called a debutante.

304
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:38,892
Well, I don´t know. I just....

305
00:29:40,728 --> 00:29:45,392
-Could you bear it?
-Could I bear it? I mean that´d be....

306
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:48,833
-That´d be cool.
-Really?

307
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:51,836
Well, good. That´s settled, then.
That´s good.

308
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,808
Good.

309
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:07,049
I forgot. I brought this for you.
It´s some pictures of me growing up.

310
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:10,218
-That´s....
-I thought you might want to have it.

311
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,586
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

312
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,560
That´s splendid, thank you.

313
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,033
Okay.

314
00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:13,745
Daphne, could I get your advice
on something?

315
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:14,911
Sure.

316
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:18,024
I can´t decide which one to wear
to the show tomorrow...

317
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:22,959
-...and I was wondering what you thought.
-ls that a Gucci tartan mini? That´s so cute!

318
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:27,761
-You can go that funky to the show?
-Daphne, that´s the whole point.

319
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:30,097
Turn up in a sensible dress and pearls...

320
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:33,536
...and you might as well wear
a sign saying, "Spot the Plonker."

321
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,543
I´m glad you told me.
Wouldn´t want to be a plonker.

322
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:39,873
What are stepsisters for?

323
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,349
-This is really cute.
-Good. I´ll wear that, then.

324
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,618
-See you later!
-Bye!

325
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:03,532
I´m here to see Daphne Reynolds.

326
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:06,868
-Do you have an appointment?
-No, but she´s a friend of mine.

327
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:10,704
-You don´t get in without an appointment.
-She´ll want to see me.

328
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:13,813
-Could you move away now, please, sir?
-What?

329
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:17,315
-Could you move away now, please?
-All right, chill out, mate.

330
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:19,851
You don´t own the place.

331
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:40,669
No, stop!

332
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:56,123
No. Not good.

333
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:01,789
I´m so sorry. One second.
I´ll be right there. Almost ready.

334
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:04,026
One second!

335
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:08,191
We have to go! Prince Charles,
Harry and Wills will already be there.

336
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:11,031
Why doesn´t Daphne come along later?

337
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:16,602
-I suppose Percy could drive--
-Brilliant. It´s settled, then.

338
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:23,548
Come on!

339
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,617
Well, isn´t this perfect?

340
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,837
-Go low on that one, Army.
-Low? Low it is.

341
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:54,740
You´d think they´d choose debs who actually
had ankles. Those look like baked hams.

342
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:59,218
-Shall I park the car?
-No, see you later!

343
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:02,117
Sorry. No admittance.
Show´s already started.

344
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,484
Come on!

345
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:07,483
Cow!

346
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:16,833
Where is this Daphne, anyway?

347
00:34:17,004 --> 00:34:19,905
She´ll probably swing through
on a vine any minute.

348
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:22,668
The girl is positively barbaric.

349
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:26,575
I hope she doesn´t embarrass me
in front of Armistead.

350
00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:37,085
We still have the arrival
of Henry´s illegitimate daughter.

351
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:42,286
You needn´t worry. Henry assured me
she will be the soul of discretion.

352
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,391
-ls this the way to the show?
-Go! You´re on!

353
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:53,501
Oh, my giddy aunt!

354
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:04,209
Holy poo on toast!

355
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:10,056
Henry...

356
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:11,956
...do something!

357
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:18,631
That´s her.

358
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:30,007
Who is that adorable creature?

359
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,041
She can dump tea in my harbor anytime.

360
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,380
Thank you, London!

361
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:53,098
I say, are you all right?
Are you sure?

362
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:58,029
-What a disgrace!
-Must be American.

363
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:02,708
Make way, everyone.
T acky American coming through.

364
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:06,310
My evil stepsister.
You´ve seen Cinderella, right?

365
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:09,949
Let me clue you in. I win.

366
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:16,518
-What a cute dog!
-I beg your pardon?

367
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:19,091
I´m Henry Dashwood´s daughter
from New York.

368
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,491
-I didn´t know Henry had a daughter.
-Can I play with him?

369
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,398
-She´s very temperamental! A biter!
-Seems sweet.

370
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,899
-Hey, guy! I like the ribbon.
-Oh, dear. Excuse me, won´t you?

371
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:34,735
Cute little guy, let´s play.

372
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:38,242
-Princess Charlotte, I do apologize.
-lt´s all right, Henry.

373
00:36:38,412 --> 00:36:44,112
I´ve just been having a delicious moment
with your daughter.

374
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:49,587
Wonderful girl. A little rough around
the edges, but you´ll sort those out.

375
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:53,853
-ls she staying for the summer?
-No, no, no.

376
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,895
-Oh, l´m afraid not.
-No, no, no.

377
00:36:57,498 --> 00:36:58,487
-No.
-Yes.

378
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,864
My daughter will be
joining us this season.

379
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:04,300
-What season?
-Oh, my dear, you´ll love it!

380
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,499
Beautiful gowns, lovely tiaras,
long, silky gloves...

381
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:12,703
...and the feverish kissing
in the cloakroom.

382
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,314
I must have my little baby back.

383
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,680
Come here, my darling. There.

384
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,378
There now, sweetheart.

385
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:24,751
-You´ve found a new friend.
-Come on, Daphne.

386
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:27,622
-Who´s my precious girl?
-Let´s get you out of here.

387
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:31,390
-Daddy.
-Relax, darling, relax.

388
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:35,001
She´ll be gone in no time,
just like her mother.

389
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:49,409
Jesus!

390
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:52,875
-You scared the bejesus out of me.
-Sorry.

391
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:55,318
So you´re the milk thief.

392
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:01,425
-What´re you doing up so late?
-Jet lag.

393
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:03,956
What´s your excuse?

394
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:07,532
Couldn´t sleep. Just thinking.

395
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,170
How I nearly wiped out
the entire royal family?

396
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:15,638
I think they enjoyed it. It´s the first time
Princess Charlotte´s taken a shine to anyone.

397
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:20,144
And no one will go near that dog since
it ate one of Lord Barret´s testicles.

398
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:24,717
-Tragic.
-The real tragedy is, he´s still reproducing.

399
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:31,722
Coco Pops. Interesting choice.

400
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:36,192
-I had you down as an All-Bran man.
-These are strictly contraband.

401
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:39,492
Glynnis makes me eat that
other gravel every morning.

402
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:45,929
-Do you like Coco Pops?
-Dude, it´ s chocolate. Need I say more?

403
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:58,310
Did you mean what you said
about me staying for the summer?

404
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:00,613
Yes. Yes, I did.

405
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:04,018
So does that mean l´m gonna
be launched on society?

406
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:08,127
I suppose we ought to arrange
some sort of coming-out party for you.

407
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:12,026
Coming-out party? Coming out as what?

408
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:16,970
-As a young woman.
-What are you trying to say, Henry?

409
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:21,472
I just-- I mean as a young woman
of a certain...

410
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:25,203
...social standing and eligibility.

411
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:27,313
Eligibility? For what?

412
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:33,249
Well, for men--
I mean, for male suitors to....

413
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:41,519
-I ´ m not explaining this very well, am l?
-No. But I ´ m having fun watching you try.

414
00:39:41,695 --> 00:39:46,223
Yes, well, perhaps we ought to leave
the party arrangements to you.

415
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:50,766
It´s not my kind of thing,
but l´ll think about it.

416
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,797
Thanks, Henry.

417
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:03,106
I was just wondering
whether your mother ever...?

418
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:11,915
-No. No, she never got married.
-No, but obviously there´d be....

419
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:14,823
There´d be somebody, you know....

420
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,108
Well, off to bed, I suppose.

421
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:38,512
I hope you find your sleeping arrangements
conducive to a good night´s--

422
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,349
Henry? "Sweet dreams" is all it takes.

423
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,057
Right.

424
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,894
Well, sweet dreams.

425
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,961
Sweet dreams, Henry.

426
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:03,208
Morning, Henry!

427
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:07,672
-Off to work?
-I was just-- Well, yes.

428
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,912
Oh, that reminds me. We must
get a dress for you for Saturday.

429
00:41:12,086 --> 00:41:14,646
-What´s on Saturday?
-The ball at the Orwoods´.

430
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:18,883
-Lots of hands to shake, l´m afraid.
-I can help Daphne find a dress.

431
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:25,388
We know that wouldn´t be a good idea.
No, I found a gown at my designer´s.

432
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:29,064
I´ve put it in your room, dear.
It´s utterly ravishing.

433
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:34,037
Excellent. Thank you. I´m counting on
you girls to give Daphne some pointers.

434
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,869
Bye, now.

435
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:49,819
Oh, very you. Lovely.

436
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,815
Thanks.

437
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:55,291
So Henry asked us to give you
some pointers, didn´t he?

438
00:41:55,462 --> 00:41:58,727
Well, pointer number one, go home.

439
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:03,026
Mother and I belong here and it´s
quite clear you just don´t fit in.

440
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:05,434
And pointer two?
While you´re packing...

441
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:10,543
...keep your grimy little Yankee paws
off Armistead Stuart.

442
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:13,612
-He´s mine.
-lf you´d take your nose out of the air...

443
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,648
...you´d see you´re designer,
l´m vintage.

444
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:19,342
You´ve got a mansion,
I have a five-floor walkup.

445
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,785
You´re snotty Little Miss Cranky Pants
and I go with the flow.

446
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,984
So why would you ever think
that l´d ever have the same taste in guys?

447
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:31,063
So here´s a little pointer for you.
Get over yourself.

448
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:36,135
And stop trying to be my daddy´s
little girl, because l´m not going anywhere.

449
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:41,836
Bye.

450
00:42:47,948 --> 00:42:49,540
Pull!

451
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:57,517
Don´t listen to that silly twit Clarissa.
She´s just threatened by you, that´s all.

452
00:42:57,691 --> 00:42:58,953
Pull!

453
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:06,692
-Why would she be threatened?
-Her mother is about to marry my son...

454
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:09,097
...and gain a title
and all that goes with it.

455
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,139
For years, Alistair tried to elevate his
position through my husband´s career.

456
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:16,742
Now he´s got his claws into Henry.

457
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:20,641
People like Alistair and Glynnis,
social standing is everything.

458
00:43:20,814 --> 00:43:22,076
Pull!

459
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:29,880
It´s silly, but they live by it.
And I lived by it too, once.

460
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:34,656
Till I saw what a toll it took
on the people who I love most.

461
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:38,420
Believe me, there´ll be plenty
of people rooting for you to fail.

462
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,695
That´s what makes it such fun.

463
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,761
-Bring it on.
-Pull!

464
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,570
Oh, dear. Is that how
the West was won?

465
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:19,032
Lord Henry Dashwood. Miss Glynnis
Payne. Miss Clarissa Payne.

466
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:22,601
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Ashley.

467
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:26,212
-Thank you very, very much.
-Thank you.

468
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,439
-Thanks.
-Who´ s next?

469
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:35,113
Lord and Lady Harrison Gordon.

470
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:38,983
Lord and Lady Jeffrey Charles.

471
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:45,321
Now, come along, Daphne. Deep breath
and remember the family motto.

472
00:44:45,499 --> 00:44:47,592
What´s the family motto?

473
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:50,836
-What does that mean?
-lt means, ducky...

474
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:54,303
...hang in there and you´ll rock!

475
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:57,069
Lady Jocelyn Dashwood,
Countess of Wycombe.

476
00:44:57,244 --> 00:45:01,271
Lady Jocelyn Dashwood,
Countess of Wycombe.

477
00:45:04,985 --> 00:45:06,680
Miss Daphne Reynolds.

478
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:12,315
41 3 Mulberry Street,
Chinatown, New York.

479
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:23,331
-What has she done to that dress?
-Mother!

480
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:31,177
-Fantastic!
-Who designed the dress, Miss Reynolds?

481
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:33,472
Could you hold it on that step, please?

482
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,914
-Let´s go.
-That wretched girl!

483
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:41,646
-Yummy.
-Can you look this side, please?

484
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,290
-That´s right.
-Can I have another smile?

485
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:47,522
That´s beautiful, Miss Reynolds.
This way. Lovely.

486
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:50,254
-Can we get a photograph?
-Excuse me, thank you.

487
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:53,764
Thank you. That will be all, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

488
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:58,371
I´m sorry about that. You´re still
something of a novelty, l´m afraid.

489
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:02,403
-Are those the girls that are coming out?
-Yes, Peach and Pear Orwood.

490
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:06,307
-The daughters of Lord Orwood.
-Have you noticed the chandelier?

491
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,381
Chairman of my constituency party.

492
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,280
The real love of his life
is that chandelier.

493
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:14,717
Don´t let him catch you looking at it.

494
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:17,413
You´ll start his boring story
about how Napoleon...

495
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:20,321
...gave it to Josephine
at the Battle of Borodino.

496
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:22,428
The story is longer than the battle.

497
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:26,589
Excuse me. I wonder if I might request
a dance from your gorgeous daughter?

498
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:29,998
I´m sure she´d be delighted.
Thank you, Armistead.

499
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:38,506
I can´t believe that little imposter
is going to ruin my summer.

500
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:42,274
She may be a lot of things, but
I can´t believe imposter is one.

501
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:44,917
Technically, she´s 39th
in line to the throne.

502
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:50,352
Really, Fiona, 38 people would have
to die for her to be queen.

503
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:54,551
Well, it´s far less than
the 72 you´d need.

504
00:46:54,862 --> 00:47:00,391
Women are just drawn to me.
It´s something I happen to be blessed with.

505
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:06,563
An indefinable quality that just
relaxes them, fascinates them.

506
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,641
-You´re feeling it, aren´t you, Dabney?
-lt´s Daphne.

507
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,111
And let me guess, you´re feeling it
in my backside?

508
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,185
Ian.

509
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:32,622
Ladies and gentlemen, we´re gonna take
a short break. See you in 1 0.

510
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:37,897
Warning : colonial strumpet alert.

511
00:48:38,298 --> 00:48:40,960
Hi, l´m Daphne Reynolds.
Peach and Pear, isn´t it?

512
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:43,659
-Are those your real names?
-Yes.

513
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:47,637
Pumpkin and Gourd would have
been much more appropriate.

514
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:50,743
-Our mother was obsessed with fruit.
-And vegetables.

515
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:55,143
-We have a sister called Parsnip.
-She doesn ´ t get out much.

516
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:59,046
Let´ s bail. This party´ s a total bore.

517
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:03,013
Don´t listen to her, the party´s hopping!

518
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:08,588
Excuse me for a second?

519
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:12,524
She is so nice.

520
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:21,332
-Henry, old chap.
-What a wonderful evening.

521
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:25,877
I ´ m glad you ´ re enjoying yourself. I don ´ t
know if you´ve noticed the chandelier.

522
00:49:26,313 --> 00:49:28,543
Actually, it´s a rather fascinating story.

523
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:36,485
-Looking for me?
-Oh, no. I was just looking for the loo.

524
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:40,491
Outside? On the terrace?

525
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:45,292
All right, so you caught me.

526
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,662
So let me guess. You´ll disappear again
without so much as a glass slipper?

527
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,575
This Cinderella´s got a dad now.
She´s not going anywhere.

528
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,115
-Your song was really beautiful.
-Thanks.

529
00:50:02,282 --> 00:50:07,481
It´s not gonna liven up this party,
though. Poor girls. I feel sorry for them.

530
00:50:07,654 --> 00:50:10,487
A dud like this will send them
back to social Siberia.

531
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:14,691
What do you say we liven things up
a little bit? Get the party started.

532
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:17,694
Well, first of all, I could get fired.

533
00:50:17,864 --> 00:50:20,992
-And second of all, I could get fired.
-Come on.

534
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:22,499
-No.
-Wimp.

535
00:50:22,669 --> 00:50:26,833
-No. No.
-For me?

536
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:31,671
Okay, let´s do it.

537
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,582
-lnsufferable deprivation of this house....
-Okay, guys.

538
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:40,914
-One, two, three, four!
-l´m cranking up the bass!

539
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,321
What?

540
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:54,726
What the devil is going on?
Is that girl yours?

541
00:51:55,095 --> 00:51:56,926
Yes. Yes, she is.

542
00:51:57,097 --> 00:52:03,036
What do I tell my daughters when they´re
lying awake crying over their ruined ball?

543
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,953
No!

544
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:28,859
Oh, my precious!

545
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:34,964
You!

546
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,400
We´re going. Come on.

547
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,471
Lord Dashwood!

548
00:53:28,185 --> 00:53:30,153
This is ridiculous.

549
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:26,069
Have you seen the papers? It´s everywhere.
We have to do something.

550
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:31,673
I don´t know anyone that isn´t
relieved to see that go.

551
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:37,079
-What on Earth are you giving Henry?
-They´re called Coco Pops, madam.

552
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:40,884
-Morning.
-Hardhat, anyone?

553
00:54:41,057 --> 00:54:45,050
You never know when something
sharp might fall from the sky.

554
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:48,859
-l´m most dreadfully sorry, miss.
-You idiot!

555
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:53,628
These are my best suede Pradas. Do you
have any idea how expensive they are?

556
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:02,644
I´m really sorry about last night.
I was just trying to help them out.

557
00:55:02,812 --> 00:55:04,905
Where did you find that revolting song?

558
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:08,050
James Brown, 1 976,
charted out at number 1 4.

559
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:14,556
I have no idea where that came from.

560
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:20,195
What?

561
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:24,527
Gillian, darling. Yes, l´m sorry,
it´s just an awful time.

562
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:42,313
What music did you listen to
when you were younger?

563
00:55:42,485 --> 00:55:46,046
-Back before the Earth´s crust cooled?
-Favorite band of the ´ 70s.

564
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:47,747
Don ´ t say the Bee Gees.

565
00:55:47,924 --> 00:55:50,825
-Don ´ t say the Bee Gees.
-They were called Little Feat.

566
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:54,122
And I saw them half a dozen times.
I remember they once--

567
00:55:54,297 --> 00:55:57,630
It´s 8: 1 5 and you have an appointment
in Westminster at 9 : 1 5.

568
00:55:58,168 --> 00:56:00,932
Yes. Yes, you ´ re right.

569
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:10,040
See you later.

570
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:15,650
Miss Daphne, Mr. Wallace
is here to see you.

571
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:18,413
Don ´ t let him in,
I ´ m not even cute yet!

572
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:23,117
What am I gonna wear?

573
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:34,931
Hello, sir. Ian Wallace.

574
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:36,663
I ´ m here to pick up Daphne.

575
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:44,839
-How you doing?
-How do you do?

576
00:56:45,015 --> 00:56:46,414
Good.

577
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:52,518
-Who are you?
-I ´ m a musician. I was at the ball last night.

578
00:56:53,857 --> 00:56:55,484
You were in the band?

579
00:56:57,427 --> 00:57:01,022
-Now you and Daphne are...?
-Eloping together? Yeah.

580
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:06,365
I realize it´s a bit sudden, but after last
night, there really was no turning back.

581
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:11,530
-You´re joking.
-Yes, sir.

582
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:18,776
-Don´t wait up, Henry.
-See you.

583
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,340
-Wow.
-Okay.

584
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:26,785
-So, what we need´s a little cheering up?
-Hold the "little."

585
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:28,253
Just leave it all to me.

586
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:36,129
You ready? Let´s go!

587
00:58:02,859 --> 00:58:04,690
Oh, hey, you gotta try these.

588
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:08,089
These are great kebabs.
Can we have two?

589
00:58:08,264 --> 00:58:10,391
-Nice. Thank you.
-Thanks.

590
00:58:11,234 --> 00:58:13,725
This is awesome!

591
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,378
I like these.

592
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,448
Oh, my God. I love these.

593
00:58:25,615 --> 00:58:29,073
Yeah. This place has always got
really nice stuff. That suits you.

594
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:30,514
-l´ll get it.
-You sure?

595
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:32,712
It´s fine. Honestly.

596
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,052
-Wait, wait.
-What?

597
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:37,455
-This is so pretty.
-Yeah.

598
00:58:38,294 --> 00:58:40,057
-You like?
-Yeah, it´s cool.

599
00:58:47,137 --> 00:58:49,571
Looks good. Yeah, I like it.

600
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:56,475
-Thanks for my bracelets.
-lt´s okay.

601
00:58:56,946 --> 00:59:01,246
-Today was really fun. I needed it.
-Good. Glad you´re enjoying yourself.

602
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:07,080
-From now on l´m gonna behave.
-Behave like what, exactly?

603
00:59:07,257 --> 00:59:11,626
I don´t know.
An impeccably brought up young lady.

604
00:59:11,795 --> 00:59:14,355
No more repeats of last night.

605
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:18,890
Okay. Well, I just chose you to help!

606
00:59:27,544 --> 00:59:31,776
Okay, that´s it.
Now gently slide your foot back.

607
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:38,513
So much for gently. Hold this.

608
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:43,016
You gotta think grace.
You gotta think poise.

609
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,686
You gotta think balance.

610
00:59:47,397 --> 00:59:48,989
Observe.

611
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:52,262
Nice!

612
00:59:52,802 --> 00:59:56,932
So tell me, Obi-Wan, where did
you learn your impressive skills?

613
00:59:57,106 --> 01:00:00,906
Well, if you really want to know,
believe it or not...

614
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:04,639
-...my mother was a deb.
-Really?

615
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:08,477
Yeah, and then she chose
to marry beneath her.

616
01:00:08,651 --> 01:00:10,710
Her parents promptly disowned her.

617
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:14,789
But for some reason they took pity
on me, their half-breed grandson.

618
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:20,021
They paid for me to go to the right schools.
They got me into all the right clubs.

619
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:23,796
Until one day I realized
the hypocrisy of it all.

620
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,227
And your parents?

621
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:30,532
They´re poor as church mice
and they´re the happiest people I know.

622
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:35,072
Now, enough stalling. Get up there
and let me see you perform.

623
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:37,179
All right. All right.

624
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:42,045
Okay. Find your center.

625
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:46,816
Good. That´s it.

626
01:00:47,757 --> 01:00:50,282
Okay. Now.

627
01:01:12,482 --> 01:01:15,144
You know what I still don´t get?

628
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:20,884
Why are you trying so hard to fit in
when you´re born to stand out?

629
01:01:49,385 --> 01:01:51,319
-Hello?
-Five hours ago your daughter...

630
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:54,513
...rode off on a motorcycle
and hasn ´ t been heard from since.

631
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:58,494
-Are we talking about a date?
-I don ´t know, but I dread to think.

632
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:00,458
The boy´s in some sort of band!

633
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:04,660
Really? Cool. Let me guess,
he´ s a drummer.

634
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:07,102
-This is serious.
-As I recall...

635
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,603
... I spent a great deal of time
on the back of your motorbike.

636
01:02:10,773 --> 01:02:14,265
Yeah, well, I think
that´s rather different.

637
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:18,670
Strange how easy it comes, isn´t it?

638
01:02:19,616 --> 01:02:22,176
-What?
-Worrying.

639
01:02:24,153 --> 01:02:28,954
-Does it ever go away?
-No, Henry, it doesn´t.

640
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:36,357
Henry! Henry!

641
01:02:36,532 --> 01:02:39,296
Libby, l´m sorry, l´m gonna have to run.

642
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:48,668
Darling, this really is important. I´ve just
had a conversation with a Bedouin translator.

643
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:52,747
Apparently there are certain drums
which indicate an actual marriage...

644
01:02:52,915 --> 01:02:56,646
...whereas others they just use
merely for mating rituals.

645
01:02:56,819 --> 01:03:00,653
-Have I just entered a parallel universe?
-Don ´ t you see what this means?

646
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:04,350
It´s possible that you and Libby
never had a real wedding.

647
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:07,894
So there´s nothing to interfere
with our plans! Is there?

648
01:03:08,064 --> 01:03:10,931
Isn´t that good news, Henry? Henry?

649
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,164
Here we go.

650
01:03:46,803 --> 01:03:48,270
Hang on a second.

651
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:54,340
-Hello, sir.
-lan. I had no idea you were so versatile.

652
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:58,378
Henry, come along, lots to do.
The assembled press are waiting.

653
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:00,015
Hi.

654
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:05,381
-Hey. What are you doing here?
-Another one of my glamorous jobs.

655
01:04:07,957 --> 01:04:11,051
-You look beautiful.
-Thanks.

656
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:14,025
-I have to be on my best behavior.
-You better be.

657
01:04:14,197 --> 01:04:18,793
-There´ s more reporters here than usual.
-They´ re waiting to see what I ´ ll do next.

658
01:04:18,968 --> 01:04:23,064
Oh, yeah? You mean like kissing a guy
who parks cars?

659
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:27,509
Daphne, the press...

660
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:32,808
-...want a photo of you and your father.
-Thanks. I´ll find him.

661
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:34,814
See you.

662
01:04:34,984 --> 01:04:37,817
Stay away from her, peasant.
She´s out of your league.

663
01:04:37,987 --> 01:04:41,787
What´s the matter? Thought our competition
ended in lower school.

664
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,756
Afraid she might prefer musicians
to Cambridge boys?

665
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:48,454
No. Breeding always
wins out in the end.

666
01:04:50,967 --> 01:04:53,765
Is Miss Reynolds enjoying
her time in London?

667
01:04:54,003 --> 01:04:56,938
-Very much.
-Lord Dashwood, how´s the campaign?

668
01:04:57,106 --> 01:04:59,666
Miss Reynolds, tell us
about the chandelier.

669
01:04:59,842 --> 01:05:01,173
Maybe that´s enough.

670
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:03,005
Thank you, no more now.

671
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:06,940
-Do you think he´s terribly rich?
-I imagine so.

672
01:05:07,116 --> 01:05:09,448
-I hope so.
-Peach?

673
01:05:09,652 --> 01:05:12,951
Pear? You look...

674
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:16,854
-...different.
-lt´s Daphne.

675
01:05:17,026 --> 01:05:22,157
-She gave us some styling tips.
-Why would you want tips from her?

676
01:05:28,371 --> 01:05:29,804
Lovely.

677
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:31,837
-Charming here.
-lsn´t it just?

678
01:05:49,258 --> 01:05:51,317
The race is that way.

679
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:54,122
Aren´t you supposed
to be escorting Clarissa?

680
01:05:54,297 --> 01:05:57,892
What? And leave you
to fend for yourself?

681
01:05:58,634 --> 01:06:01,831
Or are you suffering
from the romantic delusion...

682
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:05,440
...that some non-talent commoner
will do it for you?

683
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:10,511
You know, I really wish you ´ d pull
your lip over your head and swallow it.

684
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:17,909
Despite myself, I find your Yankee
vulgarity intensely attractive.

685
01:06:18,087 --> 01:06:20,920
So forget about the car parking,
mixed-race mongrel...

686
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:25,686
...and give me that kiss you ´ ve been
longing to give me since we first met.

687
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:27,295
You ´ re right.

688
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:30,091
I have been longing to do this.

689
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:49,815
Henry, do something!

690
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:53,946
You should have hit him!

691
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:57,782
Don´t you ever pucker your lips
at me, you arrogant jerk!

692
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,623
And how dare you insult lan?!
He´s twice the man you´ll ever be!

693
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:13,538
-Henry. Henry.
-Out of the way. Get out of the way.

694
01:07:13,809 --> 01:07:15,834
What was the argument about?

695
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:25,410
-Give me the keys to your bike! Quick!
-Here you go.

696
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,824
What´s going on?

697
01:07:29,992 --> 01:07:32,119
You do know how to drive--

698
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:34,791
Look out!

699
01:07:37,533 --> 01:07:39,558
Oh, sorry.

700
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:09,492
That is without doubt the most
indecorous thing I have done in years.

701
01:08:09,665 --> 01:08:13,226
Well, I have no idea
what you´re talking about, but l´m glad.

702
01:08:13,602 --> 01:08:15,194
You should do it more often.

703
01:08:15,371 --> 01:08:18,238
I don´t even remember
the last time I went barefoot.

704
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:22,143
Don´t you just love squidging
your toes in the sand?

705
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:24,506
Did you know it´s a natural exfoliant?

706
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:29,140
Mom says if you can walk on a beach and
you got a steady hand with nail polish...

707
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:32,685
...there´s no reason to ever pay
for a pedicure.

708
01:08:32,955 --> 01:08:36,391
-You talk just like her, you know.
-As in too much?

709
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:41,025
Is she happy?

710
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:50,229
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I can tell
she gets lonely sometimes...

711
01:08:50,806 --> 01:08:54,139
...but I think she´s pretty content
with who she is.

712
01:08:57,146 --> 01:09:01,776
-I like that about her.
-I wish I were more like that.

713
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:07,684
So, what next?

714
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:11,423
-No!
-Yes!

715
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:15,860
-No. No, absolutely not.
-lt´s this or that.

716
01:09:18,934 --> 01:09:21,232
I think we´ll do this one.

717
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,966
How´re you doing?

718
01:09:28,044 --> 01:09:29,807
Henry?

719
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:32,547
That doesn´t sound pleasant.

720
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:37,345
-What do you think?
-lt´s just henna.

721
01:10:08,217 --> 01:10:10,447
-What´s this?
-I told you how groovy I was?

722
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:13,452
-Yeah.
-And I used to like people like this guy.

723
01:10:14,023 --> 01:10:17,151
Oh, look. This stuff is good.

724
01:10:17,326 --> 01:10:20,193
I´ve been looking for Coo Coo Ow!
Strange, funky sounds.

725
01:10:20,362 --> 01:10:22,990
I remember them. " Doris."

726
01:10:36,812 --> 01:10:39,178
-Come on, Henry.
-l´m not gonna head bang.

727
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:42,317
-You just bang your head.
-Don´t do that. No.

728
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:46,148
-Nod!
-l´m not gonna do that. All right. Let´s go.

729
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:34,630
I was just-- I wanted
to see if they still fit.

730
01:11:35,204 --> 01:11:37,832
Well, they seem fine.

731
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:44,008
Who are you? What have you
done with my fiancé?

732
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,614
I want my Henry back.

733
01:11:57,927 --> 01:11:59,622
-Lord Dashwood.
-Lord Dashwood.

734
01:11:59,795 --> 01:12:02,127
You´ve dropped 1 5 points in the polls.

735
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:04,562
-Are you worried?
-I really can´t comment.

736
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:09,102
If you can´t handle your own child,
how can you handle the government?

737
01:12:10,406 --> 01:12:14,866
-Frank, good to see you.
-Could you answer, please?

738
01:12:16,645 --> 01:12:18,636
-How much time do we have?
-Plenty.

739
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:21,146
Your first two clients
were no-shows and...

740
01:12:21,317 --> 01:12:24,718
...you got out of your speech
at the Children ´ s Education Center.

741
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:29,449
-Why would we have canceled that speech?
-We didn´t. They did.

742
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:58,253
Daphne, can I have a word?

743
01:12:59,288 --> 01:13:04,487
This is Brigadier Sir Roderick Dashwood.
He lost an eye at the Battle of the Boyne.

744
01:13:06,028 --> 01:13:09,429
And over here we have Field Marshal
Bingley Dashwood.

745
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,998
He lost his arm
at the Battle of the Nile.

746
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:19,105
And Uncle Alfred never spoke about what
he lost, but you´d rarely find him sitting.

747
01:13:19,975 --> 01:13:23,775
I lost my tonsils.
Does that mean I qualify?

748
01:13:25,414 --> 01:13:27,075
Listen, Daphne.

749
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:32,812
Part of the burden of being a member
of this family is that there are certain...

750
01:13:32,988 --> 01:13:36,856
...codes of behavior
that one is expected to observe.

751
01:13:37,826 --> 01:13:41,023
And if one is not seen
to conform, then....

752
01:13:42,197 --> 01:13:44,188
Well, then it becomes....

753
01:13:46,101 --> 01:13:50,333
Listen, I ´ ve very much enjoyed
our time together.

754
01:13:50,906 --> 01:13:54,137
Really and truly. It´ s just that this....

755
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:58,246
These are very difficult circumstances...

756
01:14:00,182 --> 01:14:03,583
...and you, as my daughter,
have to....

757
01:14:04,353 --> 01:14:05,877
I have to change.

758
01:14:07,556 --> 01:14:09,717
It´ s okay, I get it.

759
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,197
-I ´ m.... I ´ m a Dashwood too, right?
-Yes.

760
01:14:17,466 --> 01:14:19,093
Yes, you are.

761
01:14:34,049 --> 01:14:39,544
What are you looking at?
I can do it.

762
01:16:12,247 --> 01:16:14,772
Not wearing that
to The Strokes concert, are you?

763
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,714
Oh, my God, I totally forgot!

764
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:21,152
-Things have been so hectic.
-That´s okay.

765
01:16:21,323 --> 01:16:23,951
I´ll wait for you to get changed.

766
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:27,954
I can´t go. We´re going
to the queen´s garden party.

767
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:32,000
-Yeah, but....
-l´m sorry.

768
01:16:33,735 --> 01:16:35,202
Cool.

769
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:40,005
Just call me when Daphne
re-inhabits your body.

770
01:17:00,028 --> 01:17:05,432
-And this is Miss Daphne Reynolds.
-Oh, Daphne.

771
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:08,327
Nice girl.

772
01:17:09,638 --> 01:17:14,041
I gather Her Majesty´s accepted
an invitation to Daphne´s ball.

773
01:17:14,209 --> 01:17:18,578
She´s come a long way, I must say.
You must be very proud of her.

774
01:17:27,155 --> 01:17:28,782
No.

775
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:44,070
This is the tiara that I wore
at my own coming-out party.

776
01:17:44,706 --> 01:17:48,164
Clarissa´s had her beady eye
on it for months.

777
01:17:48,343 --> 01:17:50,811
But I want you to have it.

778
01:17:59,454 --> 01:18:03,481
-So royal.
-I hope it makes you feel like a princess.

779
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:08,989
But you know, my dear,
it´s not the crown that makes the queen.

780
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:12,065
It´s what´s in here.

781
01:18:28,984 --> 01:18:32,545
-Hello.
-Ladies.

782
01:18:37,192 --> 01:18:38,819
Well, yes, of course.

783
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:55,475
Here she comes.

784
01:19:37,786 --> 01:19:39,515
Daphne.

785
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:43,482
-You look....
-Different?

786
01:20:11,887 --> 01:20:14,549
-Can we talk for a sec?
-lt´s your party.

787
01:20:14,723 --> 01:20:18,056
-You can do whatever you want.
-lan.

788
01:20:18,226 --> 01:20:21,320
-I really didn´t--
-I don´t want to hear about it, Daph.

789
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:25,928
What happened to the old you?
The real you?

790
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:33,303
Okay, lads, let´s pick up the tempo.

791
01:20:46,788 --> 01:20:48,551
Mom!

792
01:20:53,395 --> 01:20:54,657
What are you doing here?

793
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:58,630
Jocelyn thought you might need a pal
while being fed to the sharks.

794
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,462
Oh, honey, you look so beautiful.

795
01:21:01,636 --> 01:21:04,298
Look at you, Mom!

796
01:21:05,173 --> 01:21:07,641
Are you actually wearing a bra?

797
01:21:15,383 --> 01:21:16,941
Come on.

798
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:25,893
Hello, Henry.

799
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:28,721
Libby.

800
01:21:30,499 --> 01:21:36,495
-Hello, Lucy. I´m Glynnis, Henry´s fiancée.
-lt´s Libby, actually. And congratulations.

801
01:21:36,938 --> 01:21:42,205
Well, what a lovely surprise.
I see you´ve come with no escort.

802
01:21:42,377 --> 01:21:46,177
Henry, you must find somebody divine
for Lubby here to dance with.

803
01:21:46,348 --> 01:21:48,646
Libby. Remember?

804
01:21:49,951 --> 01:21:53,182
And why doesn´t he just
ask her himself?

805
01:22:39,367 --> 01:22:43,770
This is fantastic. Everyone important
has accepted their invitation.

806
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:48,573
-We´ve got the election in the bag.
-How can you be so calm?

807
01:22:48,743 --> 01:22:53,043
Her Majesty is due any moment and your
candidate is dancing with that woman.

808
01:22:53,215 --> 01:22:54,807
Henry knows what´s at stake.

809
01:22:54,983 --> 01:22:58,783
Besides, look what he did with Daphne.
Quite an achievement.

810
01:22:58,954 --> 01:23:02,549
I thought I was going to have to get rid
of her, like her mother, but--

811
01:23:02,724 --> 01:23:04,123
What did you just say?

812
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:06,226
Nothing.

813
01:23:06,394 --> 01:23:09,625
-Did you say you got rid of my mother?
-Figure of speech.

814
01:23:10,732 --> 01:23:14,691
-Are you the one that made her leave?
-Daphne, darling, now is not the time.

815
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:19,136
-Come on now, don ´ t linger!
-Hey, but-- Glynnis!

816
01:23:19,307 --> 01:23:22,333
-How dare he!
-Come on.

817
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:24,842
-Come on!
-Glynnis, let go!

818
01:23:25,013 --> 01:23:28,176
-Get in here!
-Glynnis! Let go!

819
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:30,250
Get in here!

820
01:23:30,752 --> 01:23:33,744
Glynnis! Glynnis!
Glynnis!

821
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:43,263
Remember the ritual dances?

822
01:23:43,431 --> 01:23:46,457
You were so bad
they´re still blaming you for the locusts.

823
01:23:46,635 --> 01:23:50,799
-I recall your frock nearly got us arrested.
-I had you translate my apology.

824
01:23:50,972 --> 01:23:54,772
-Which was something of a risk, I thought.
-I know it. You could ´ ve been...

825
01:23:54,943 --> 01:23:57,741
-...trading me in for a goat.
-Camel, actually.

826
01:23:57,913 --> 01:24:00,313
Which never came through,
by the way.

827
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,676
I had faith in you, Henry.

828
01:24:06,254 --> 01:24:08,381
Just not enough?

829
01:24:08,556 --> 01:24:11,684
You didn´t say goodbye.
You just disappeared.

830
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:15,421
-lt was what you wanted.
-What I wanted?

831
01:24:15,597 --> 01:24:19,795
-What I wanted was to be given a chance.
-You have had 1 7 years of chances, Henry...

832
01:24:19,968 --> 01:24:24,701
...and I ´ ve had 1 7 years
of waiting for you to take them.

833
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,705
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

834
01:24:30,879 --> 01:24:34,781
...the traditional father-daughter dance.
Lord Dashwood?

835
01:24:39,721 --> 01:24:41,211
Please!

836
01:24:42,023 --> 01:24:43,320
Help!

837
01:24:43,925 --> 01:24:45,517
-Where is Daphne?
-l´ll find her.

838
01:24:45,694 --> 01:24:48,822
Oh, no.
Has Daphne gone missing again?

839
01:24:50,598 --> 01:24:53,624
Maybe Clarissa can step in.
You wouldn´t mind, would you?

840
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:56,293
No. I´m almost your daughter
now too.

841
01:24:58,473 --> 01:25:00,441
Well, l´d....

842
01:25:10,018 --> 01:25:11,679
-Help! Someone!
-Daphne?

843
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:14,048
I can´t miss
my own father-daughter dance!

844
01:25:14,222 --> 01:25:15,849
-Honey?
-Help!

845
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:32,728
-How dare you, Glynnis? How dare you!
-We don´t want a scene, do we?

846
01:25:32,907 --> 01:25:37,469
Take your hand off my daughter or you won´t
get a scene, you´ll get a Broadway musical.

847
01:25:55,797 --> 01:25:57,526
-Daphne....
-What are you doing?

848
01:25:58,033 --> 01:26:01,093
Finally giving you what you deserve.

849
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,571
Go ahead.

850
01:26:09,277 --> 01:26:11,006
I don´t want it.

851
01:26:12,614 --> 01:26:14,081
Any of it.

852
01:26:33,201 --> 01:26:34,691
Daphne!

853
01:26:35,103 --> 01:26:36,593
Daphne!

854
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,000
-Wait.
-No.

855
01:26:43,845 --> 01:26:46,541
I´m done waiting, Henry.

856
01:26:54,289 --> 01:27:00,057
You know, when I was little, every birthday
l´d get all dressed up and l´d wish...

857
01:27:00,562 --> 01:27:05,966
...that if I was good enough,
you´d come and find me.

858
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:13,707
And now here I am, in the most beautiful
dress I could ever imagine...

859
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,144
...and you´re here.

860
01:27:18,947 --> 01:27:23,816
You know what I miss now?
I miss being me.

861
01:27:25,386 --> 01:27:28,287
I finally realized that that is enough.

862
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:36,563
You know, Daphne....

863
01:27:38,032 --> 01:27:43,834
Maybe we´re just trying
to make something work here which isn´t.

864
01:27:44,005 --> 01:27:48,908
Pray be upstanding
for Her Majesty, the queen.

865
01:28:03,391 --> 01:28:05,518
Go ahead.

866
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:07,651
Duty calls.

867
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,427
Come on, honey.

868
01:30:22,897 --> 01:30:26,060
-Lord Dashwood! What is your priority?
-Thank you very much.

869
01:30:26,234 --> 01:30:29,169
-The election or your daughter?
-I have no comment.

870
01:30:37,512 --> 01:30:40,845
-Couldn ´ t you sleep either?
-No.

871
01:30:42,884 --> 01:30:45,478
Made a bit of a mess of things,
haven ´ t l?

872
01:30:45,653 --> 01:30:47,177
A bit.

873
01:30:48,756 --> 01:30:53,216
Henry, for six centuries this family
has been sacrificing bits of itself for England.

874
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:58,730
Arms, legs, eyes. The battlefields of Europe
are littered with them.

875
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,767
Don´t follow in that glorious tradition.

876
01:31:04,472 --> 01:31:07,373
You know what you´re going
to sacrifice?

877
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:12,272
Your heart, Henry.

878
01:31:46,414 --> 01:31:47,904
Sir Charles.

879
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:03,057
Thank you.

880
01:32:04,465 --> 01:32:05,591
Thank you.

881
01:32:08,035 --> 01:32:09,764
Thank you.

882
01:32:11,606 --> 01:32:13,198
Thank you.

883
01:32:13,374 --> 01:32:15,706
Well, over the last few weeks,
l´ve certainly...

884
01:32:15,877 --> 01:32:19,836
...received more support and encouragement
from this constituency...

885
01:32:20,014 --> 01:32:24,917
...than I ´ d ever dared hoped for. So I ´ d like
to take this opportunity to thank you all.

886
01:32:27,288 --> 01:32:33,591
You may have noticed that recently there
have been one or two remarks in the press.

887
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:36,161
Regarding my behavior.

888
01:32:36,798 --> 01:32:41,326
It´s been suggested l´ve not been conducting
myself in a manner befitting an MP.

889
01:32:42,837 --> 01:32:46,295
Well, l´ve been giving my priorities
a great deal of thought...

890
01:32:46,808 --> 01:32:50,608
...and l´ve decided that it´s time
to get them straight.

891
01:32:50,778 --> 01:32:54,544
Which is why I must now respectfully
withdraw my candidacy.

892
01:32:59,854 --> 01:33:05,258
Representing you would undoubtedly
be the greatest honor of my political life.

893
01:33:05,693 --> 01:33:11,029
It would simply be impossible to do so
if l´m not serving my own conscience.

894
01:33:12,366 --> 01:33:13,856
See...

895
01:33:18,906 --> 01:33:20,806
...I´ve changed.

896
01:33:27,515 --> 01:33:31,747
And as important
as my political aspirations are to me...

897
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:35,214
...there is one thing
that matters more.

898
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,661
Thank you.

899
01:34:09,957 --> 01:34:11,447
Are you out of your mind?

900
01:34:12,026 --> 01:34:14,790
I have done everything
to get you to this position...

901
01:34:14,962 --> 01:34:17,123
...and I will not let you
throw it all away!

902
01:34:17,298 --> 01:34:19,562
You´ve lied to me,
I know you lied to Libby...

903
01:34:19,734 --> 01:34:22,862
...so forgive me if I don´t give
a flying fart what you think.

904
01:34:23,037 --> 01:34:26,097
Libby? I stopped you
from ruining your life!

905
01:34:26,274 --> 01:34:28,868
I saved your family´s reputation!

906
01:34:29,043 --> 01:34:33,104
When I found out that girl was pregnant,
I knew I was doing the right thing.

907
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:38,808
-You knew about Daphne?
-Of course I knew! It´s my job to know!

908
01:34:41,756 --> 01:34:43,747
-Grandpa! Are you okay?
-Oh, God.

909
01:34:44,258 --> 01:34:46,055
-This is horrible.
-Do shut up!

910
01:34:47,528 --> 01:34:51,828
Henry, darling! I know Daddy´s been naughty,
but what about me?

911
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,763
You´ll survive.

912
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:16,720
Hey. Table six is screaming for coffee.
What´re you doing, anyway?

913
01:35:16,891 --> 01:35:19,792
Sorry, it´s my college applications.
Due on Monday.

914
01:35:19,961 --> 01:35:22,088
Okay, l´ll cover for you.

915
01:35:22,263 --> 01:35:24,788
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

916
01:35:30,004 --> 01:35:34,805
Ladies and gentlemen, the bride
would like to share a dance with her father.

917
01:35:35,977 --> 01:35:37,911
I love you, Dad.

918
01:36:32,867 --> 01:36:36,769
-What are you doing here?
-I just came because l....

919
01:36:37,505 --> 01:36:42,169
I had something very important
to say to you...

920
01:36:42,343 --> 01:36:46,439
...and I hope I can.... Actually,
I wrote it all down on the plane about....

921
01:36:48,282 --> 01:36:50,773
About 200 times, as you....

922
01:36:54,588 --> 01:36:57,421
It was on a....
I have it....

923
01:36:57,591 --> 01:37:00,685
What it comes down to is....

924
01:37:02,196 --> 01:37:04,528
Is that I love you, Daphne.

925
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:08,260
I love you.
I ´ m so sorry.

926
01:37:08,436 --> 01:37:12,964
I wouldn ´ t change you, anything about you.
I wouldn ´ t change one hair on your head.

927
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:16,906
-Not for anything--
-I love you, Dad. I love you!

928
01:37:36,097 --> 01:37:37,689
Might l....

929
01:37:38,432 --> 01:37:40,900
Might I have the honor of this dance?

930
01:38:21,675 --> 01:38:24,269
Listen, Daphne, l....

931
01:38:25,012 --> 01:38:29,415
I just think when you´re groveling
it´s important to bring a very large present.

932
01:38:29,917 --> 01:38:32,715
-I don´t understand.
-May I cut in?

933
01:38:32,887 --> 01:38:34,445
Of course.

934
01:38:37,391 --> 01:38:39,586
I tried to call you....

935
01:38:51,672 --> 01:38:54,800
You never did want me to go,
did you?

936
01:38:54,975 --> 01:38:57,466
There never was anyone else,
was there?

937
01:38:59,713 --> 01:39:02,807
I´d say I owe you
a rather large apology.

938
01:39:03,984 --> 01:39:07,476
You think l´ve waited 1 7 years
for an apology?

939
01:39:17,364 --> 01:39:20,765
So I finally got my father-daughter dance.

940
01:39:20,935 --> 01:39:24,371
Of course, it got interrupted
when my boyfriend showed up.

941
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:27,769
And then my parents started making out.

942
01:39:32,613 --> 01:39:37,346
But sometimes things aren ´t exactly
how you always imagined.

943
01:39:37,718 --> 01:39:39,845
They´re even better.

944
01:39:53,334 --> 01:39:57,395
Oh, just in case you were wondering
what happened to Clarissa and Glynnis...

945
01:39:57,571 --> 01:40:02,201
...don ´t worry.
They ended up exactly as they should.

946
01:40:04,278 --> 01:40:07,247
--the rustication, then it gets smoother--

947
01:40:07,414 --> 01:40:09,041
-Big Ben.
-So did Alistair.

948
01:40:09,216 --> 01:40:12,276
I can see the smiles.
For those of you who speak English...

949
01:40:12,453 --> 01:40:15,752
...it´ s not the name of a large hamburger
at a fast food restaurant.

950
01:40:15,923 --> 01:40:18,153
This is the closest he got
to Parliament.

951
01:40:19,827 --> 01:40:25,322
My parents got married again.
This time, it was legal.

952
01:40:25,499 --> 01:40:27,194
I think.

953
01:40:30,537 --> 01:40:33,301
As for me, I didn ´t end up at NYU.

954
01:40:33,474 --> 01:40:38,605
But before you get too disappointed,
I did get into Oxford.

955
01:40:38,946 --> 01:40:43,542
What can I say?
Like father, like daughter.

956
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:49,786
It was my own happily ever after.

957
01:44:53,667 --> 01:44:54,656
[ ENGLlSH]
