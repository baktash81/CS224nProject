1
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:46,015
-Package for Robert Garfield.
-Yeah.

2
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,119
-Sign here.
-Thanks.

3
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:49,748
Whenever it wants, the past can come
kicking the door down.

4
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:54,444
And you never know
where it's gonna take you.

5
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:58,715
All you can do is hope
it's a place you wanna go.

6
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:15,502
You've reached the Garfield family.
Jill and the boys are away.

7
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,303
You can reach them on their cells.

8
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:22,881
I'll be on the road for a few days.
Be back Tuesday.

9
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:32,356
On behalf of the president
of the United States...

10
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,754
...l present this flag...

11
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,429
...for the honorable
service rendered...

12
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:41,260
...by your husband,
Major John Sullivan.

13
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:44,494
-Hey, Sully!
-Hey!

14
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:48,333
Bobby, l decided what l wanna be.
A magician.

15
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:52,945
-l'll pull rabbits out of a hat.
-Rabbits will shit in your hat.

16
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:55,944
But l'd be a cool bastard.
Admit it.

17
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:11,955
There's cake at the Veterans Hall.
Of course you're all welcome.

18
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,300
-Mr. Garfield.
-Mr. Oliver.

19
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:22,498
-Thanks for sending the glove.
-Been Sully's lawyer forever.

20
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:26,907
Couldn't see why a baseball glove
had to go through probate.

21
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:33,345
-You and Sully were kids together?
-Yeah, there were three of us.

22
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:36,420
Me and Sully, and a girl named Carol.

23
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:38,523
-Carol Gerber?
-That's right.

24
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,750
l'm hoping she'll be here.

25
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:45,487
You didn't hear about Carol?

26
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,232
No.

27
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:54,837
l'm afraid she's dead.

28
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,670
l'm so sorry.

29
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:44,515
This street is where it all happened.

30
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,187
It's not much now.

31
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:51,762
Why do we always expect home
will stay the same?

32
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:54,499
Nothing else does.

33
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:11,574
It's funny how when you're a kid,
a day can last forever.

34
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:16,982
Now, all these years
seem just like a blink.

35
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,893
Bobby? Bobby-o?

36
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,762
Time to get a wiggle on.

37
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:07,837
Wake up, Bobby.

38
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:11,671
Hey, wait for me!

39
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,477
Come on, Johnny.

40
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,526
Happy birthday, Mr. Eleven. Ta-da!

41
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:41,399
Oh, wow. Library card.

42
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:45,601
A grownup's library card,
if you please.

43
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:49,840
Thanks, Mom.

44
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:52,116
-ls--?
-Don't.

45
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:56,882
Don't you think l wanted to get you
a bike? l can't afford it.

46
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,390
lKnow how that makes me feel?
Your father didn't leave us well-off.

47
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:04,722
He did leave us three months'
unpaid rent...

48
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:08,731
...a life insurance policy that lapsed
before he died.

49
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:12,427
He left a rather large stack
of unpaid bills...

50
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,869
...which l managed to take care of.

51
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:17,838
People understand our situation.

52
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,171
Mr. Biderman is a good example...

53
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,747
...but it has not been easy.
Do you get that?

54
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,546
Your father never met
an inside straight he didn't like.

55
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:32,213
-What's an inside straight?
-Never you mind, Bobby-o.

56
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:37,727
Don't let me catch you playing cards.
l've had enough of that.

57
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:39,898
Come on, then.

58
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:45,601
That must be the new
upstairs apartment tenant.

59
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:50,806
l don't trust people who move their
things in paper bags. lt's slutty.

60
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,844
-He has suitcases.
-Yes, but they don't match, do they?

61
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:57,778
Oh, hello, folks. l'm Ted Brautigan.

62
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,849
l'll be living upstairs.

63
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:03,045
l'm Elizabeth Garfield.
This is my son, Robert.

64
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:05,952
Nice to meet you, Mr. Brattigan.
Tempus fugit.

65
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,992
lt's Brautigan,
but Ted is fine with me.

66
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:13,162
lt's nice to meet you.
l hope you like it here.

67
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:14,856
Thank you, Robert.

68
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:20,563
Birthday boy!

69
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:25,040
Carol, it's hard enough
being friends without that.

70
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,736
You loved it. Here.

71
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:31,144
-ls this gonna be gushy?
-l don't know.

72
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,213
Better not be.

73
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:36,644
Whoa.

74
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:39,188
-Just like it.
-Yeah, that's great.

75
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,690
-Thanks.
-Sure.

76
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:49,799
-Didn't get the bike, did you?
-No big deal. Mom can't afford it.

77
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:51,334
She buys new dresses.

78
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:55,701
She has to look nice for the office.
Are you coming?

79
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:59,040
-Yeah.
-Come on.

80
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,187
-Hey, Sully!
-Hey!

81
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:13,820
-Get the bike?
-No.

82
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:17,929
Well, l got nothing for you.
But happy birthday!

83
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,134
Hang on! Wait for me!

84
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:58,736
-What's an inside straight?
-Something to do with gambling.

85
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:03,466
Poker. You draw a middle card.
lt's dumb, strictly for suckers.

86
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:13,849
This neighborhood
is getting terribly run-down.

87
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:16,146
I think I'll have to move.

88
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:25,556
-Yeah?
-Is that how we answer the phone?

89
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:30,202
Hi, Mom. l'm sorry. l was just excited
about dinner and all.

90
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:35,899
Mr. Biderman has to work late
and needs me to do the same.

91
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:38,942
So birthday dinner
at the Colony is off.

92
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:40,134
Okay, Mom.

93
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:44,180
There are leftovers.
l'll be home to tuck you in.

94
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:47,353
Oh, make sure to turn
off the gas ring...

95
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:49,783
... when you're done with the stove.

96
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:52,890
-l know.
-See you soon.

97
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,043
Evening, Robert.

98
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:14,677
Or should l say Bobby?

99
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:17,782
Oh, Mr. Brautigan. Hi.

100
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:19,281
lt's Ted.

101
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,323
Sorry. Ted'll be hard for me,
but l'll try.

102
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:28,123
You going out later?

103
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:33,597
l was supposed to have
a birthday dinner.

104
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,702
Mom had to stay at work,
even though she didn't want to.

105
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,503
Are you a rich man then...

106
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,810
...from your birthday gifts?

107
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,845
A library card?

108
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:56,315
No, an adult library card. Oh, my.

109
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:59,619
All the master storytellers
waiting for you.

110
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:03,728
You know why she picked it?
Because it was free.

111
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:08,260
That doesn't matter.
Don't you give up on this card.

112
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:10,800
Because books can be solid gold.

113
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:15,634
The great ones have gotten us
through the nights for centuries.

114
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:21,039
Give a writer an hour to hook you.
lf he can't, find someone else.

115
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:23,408
Think you can try that?

116
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:27,278
lf l don't have anything else to do.

117
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,584
Fair enough. Don't be afraid.

118
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,920
A Tale of Two Cities ends
with a beheading, great stuff.

119
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:39,963
Lost Horizon, magic and places
unknown. Can't beat that.

120
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:46,067
Where'd you live
before you came here, Mr--? Ted?

121
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:49,573
Some other place
that wasn't as nice as this.

122
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:52,108
You lived here long?

123
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,407
Yes, sir. Since my dad died.

124
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,313
-When was that sad day?
-When l was 5.

125
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:03,015
Six years, huh?

126
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:07,219
You must know everything happening
on this street.

127
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:12,989
Sure do. Because nothing happens
on this street.

128
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,794
-Six years.
-That's just a blink.

129
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:22,133
Someday you'll agree.

130
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:27,905
You know, Ben Jonson called time
the ""old bald cheater.""

131
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:29,505
What?

132
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:33,674
Ben Jonson called time
the ""old bald cheater.""

133
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:35,444
l like that.

134
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:39,955
l think l do too. Who's Ben Jonson?

135
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,219
He's an English writer,
dead these many years.

136
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:46,195
Brilliant, but foolish about money.

137
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,335
And given to flatulence.

138
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,595
What's flatulence?

139
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,341
Yeah, kids always think
farts are funny.

140
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,650
Might have a job for you.
Have to think about it first.

141
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:12,889
Really?

142
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:16,653
Yeah. lf it works out,
you might get that bike.

143
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,095
How'd you know l wanted a bike?

144
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:26,134
All kids want bikes.

145
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:00,332
Hey, Mom. l took another look
at that bike.

146
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:04,942
lt's a Phantom, 26-incher. Real swell.

147
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:08,575
No, perfect. Perfect is more like it.

148
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,908
Start saving those pennies.

149
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,212
Ted? lt's me.

150
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:16,913
Hi, kid. Come in.

151
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,591
Thanks for making the skyward journey.

152
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:22,754
An icy root beer awaits you as reward.

153
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,793
Colder, the better.

154
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:29,696
One feels them first at the back
of one's eyes.

155
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,170
Feels what?

156
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:37,872
One feels them first
at the back of one's eyes.

157
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:44,542
Yeah.

158
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:49,210
Hey, l did like you said.

159
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,786
-What?
-l gave him a couple of hours.

160
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:55,256
Oh, yeah. Lost Horizon.
What do you think?

161
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:57,258
Better than the Hardy Boys.

162
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,021
Yeah, sure is.

163
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:06,967
Tell me, Bobby, how'd you like
to make a dollar a week?

164
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:08,470
Would l ever?!

165
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:11,370
Well, my eyes are beginning
to fail me...

166
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:16,708
...and if you will read me
the Harwich Journal every day...

167
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,010
...headline stuff, sports,
comics, want ads...

168
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:23,552
...l'll give you said dollar.
What do you say?

169
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,690
What else?

170
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,322
What do you mean?

171
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,122
There's got to be more
to it than that.

172
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,633
Yeah, there is.

173
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:39,133
So, what's the real job?

174
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:42,500
lKeep your eyes open.

175
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,609
-For what?
-Low men.

176
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:48,774
That's right, Bobby.

177
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:53,576
l use the term ""low""
in the Dickensian sense...

178
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:58,723
...meaning dangerous. Men who stop
at nothing to get what they want.

179
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:02,219
Your real job will simply be...

180
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,662
...to walk around the area...

181
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:08,897
...and if you see them
or find evidence on them...

182
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,103
...you'll alert me immediately.

183
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:14,739
Okay. And why are they hot
on your trail?

184
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:23,405
A certain something l have.
Let's leave it at that.

185
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:27,212
What do they look like?

186
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:33,823
Well, they wear dark clothes,
dark hats.

187
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,386
They're kind of anonymous...

188
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:40,690
...but you can recognize their cars...

189
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,061
...loud and flashy.

190
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,270
When they move, they move in packs...

191
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:50,067
...like animals closing
in on the kill.

192
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,872
And they cast long shadows.

193
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,742
Oh, what a world.

194
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:08,283
They're not cops, are they?

195
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:10,692
Or secret agents?

196
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:16,758
Are you asking me if l'm a bad guy
or a commie spy?

197
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:20,132
l've scamped my share of fines...

198
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,137
...and if there were library police...

199
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:26,140
...l'd be one of their
10 most wanted.

200
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:32,282
But l never robbed a bank
or stole a military secret.

201
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:34,412
So who are they?

202
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:38,288
They're thugs, relentless...

203
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:41,091
...when they're after something.

204
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:44,387
-Like this something you have?
-That's right.

205
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:50,394
And what they want is me,
back under their control.

206
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:53,367
Look out. When they're closing in...

207
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,338
...they leave strange signs in code...

208
00:19:57,543 --> 00:20:00,876
...in obvious places
like telephone poles...

209
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,948
...posters and notices
for lost pets and lost dogs.

210
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:11,250
lf l knew what they'd do,
they'd never catch me.

211
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:15,951
-What do l do if l see them?
-Run and tell me what you've seen.

212
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:19,761
l asked if you knew
what was going on around here.

213
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:24,629
-Sure.
-That's why you're my man, kiddo.

214
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:35,305
Don't worry,
l won't let the bogeyman get you.

215
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:39,109
-Bobby?
-She can't know what you're thinking.

216
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:43,277
You think she can,
and that's a mother's power.

217
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:47,082
Mrs. Garfield.

218
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:53,054
Well, it's very cozy in here.

219
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:56,166
Mom, Ted-- l mean, Mr. Brautigan...

220
00:20:56,368 --> 00:21:00,464
...he's gonna pay me a dollar a week
to read him the paper.

221
00:21:01,106 --> 00:21:03,666
Well, that's very generous.

222
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:07,437
Do you always have boys read to you,
Mr. Brattigan?

223
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:09,443
lt's Brautigan, ma'am.

224
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:12,982
And, yes, l need someone to do it.

225
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:16,154
My eyes aren't what they used to be.

226
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:18,846
And what did you do before that?

227
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:22,221
l worked up north. Various places.

228
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,432
Well, come along, Bobby.
Time and tide wait for no man.

229
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:35,136
-Bye, Mr. Brautigan.
-Bobby.

230
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:47,615
Mom, guess what Mr. Brautigan--

231
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,049
-Something doesn't make sense.
-What?

232
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,821
Why would a man his age wanna
spend time with a kid?

233
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:00,430
l don't know.

234
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:04,762
l do know that he said
l must be some lucky kid...

235
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,063
...to have a mom who'd let me...

236
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:11,072
...have a grownup library card
for my birthday.

237
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:15,109
l don't know. l trust him...

238
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:18,442
...about as far as l could
sling a piano.

239
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:23,816
That's right, spoil it for me.
You never want me to get that bike.

240
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:26,992
l do, and l wish l could've
gotten it for you.

241
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:30,491
But your father didn't exactly
leave us well-off.

242
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,092
lt's only reading.

243
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:41,832
All right, what's the harm?

244
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:43,597
Yes, yes, yes!

245
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:47,711
But only on the porch,
mind, in the fresh air.

246
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:49,171
Okay.

247
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:08,795
-Bye, Bobby.
-Bye, Carol.

248
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:13,335
Sorry l'm late. l forgot the time.

249
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:14,631
That's all right.

250
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:19,036
We're all time's captives,
hostages to eternity.

251
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:20,233
Ben Jonson?

252
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,414
No, Boris Pasternak.

253
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:27,650
He was a Russian
of no account, l think.

254
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:31,955
What's going on in the world?
Something scurrilous.

255
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:34,455
""Vice President Richard M. Nixon...

256
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,823
...after having won
the Republican nomination...

257

...on the first ballot,
confers with Henry Cabot Lodge--""

258
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:46,935
-We're going for ice cream.
-Can't. Earning my daily bread.

259
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:51,934
-Afternoon, Mrs. Gerber. Carol.
-Hi, Ted.

260
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:58,373
l never, ever saw a girl
as special as Carol Gerber.

261
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,274
There's millions.

262
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:01,646
Oh, yeah?

263
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:05,749
-Have you kissed her yet?
-Yuck!

264
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,518
-Well, you will, l promise you.
-Stay away.

265
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:14,760
You will. lt will be the kiss
by which all others...

266
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:19,370
...in your life will be judged,
and found wanting.

267
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,737
Are you done?

268
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:29,007
Yeah. Come on, read to me. Go on.

269
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:32,615
-Come back here and do your job.
-Okay.

270
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:36,514
But you will kiss her.

271
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,394
Oh, my God!

272
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:53,897
Nice going.

273
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:03,746
Get in! Get in, Bobby!

274
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:33,972
Come on. Come on, Sully.

275
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:35,544
Sully!

276
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:41,679
""FBl announces new measures
to combat Red infiltrators.""

277
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:46,454
-Hey, Bobby.
-Yeah?

278
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:49,957
Tell me what Dale Arden's wearing
in Flash Gordon.

279
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:53,294
What is it with you and her?

280
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:58,533
When l was younger l thought
she was a real hotsie-totsie.

281
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:04,474
Okay, before comics,
we've got sports, baseball.

282
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:08,840
""Maury Wills on the way
to break Ty Cobb's record.""

283
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,036
l saw Cobb.

284
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:14,917
My dad saw Babe Ruth.
He saw him point for the home run.

285
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,385
Against the Cubs.
He told me all about it.

286
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,150
He tell you of Nagurski's
comeback game?

287
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:27,128
l know he saw it, though.
Were you there?

288
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:31,769
-Yeah.
-You and Dad were at the same place.

289
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:34,501
You know about Nagurski?

290
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:37,998
He was my dad's hero, that's all.

291
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:42,174
The greatest football player ever.
He came to Chicago...

292
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:45,544
...played eight years
to make the Bears champions.

293
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:49,585
Then he retired.
When he was old, six years retired...

294
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:52,256
...the Bears brought him back.

295
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:55,358
Last game of the season,
they played...

296
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,858
...the Cardinals, sworn enemies.

297
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:02,261
The Bears had to beat
the Cardinals to win.

298
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:07,300
Nagurski wasn't supposed to play.
Third-string fullback.

299
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:11,575
ln the first half
the starter went down.

300
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,502
-The second half there was a pileup.
-Oh, no.

301
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:19,275
lf your dad was here
he'd say he was frightened.

302
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:24,285
-He was just so scared.
-But why? Nagurski was in the game.

303
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:26,718
l was scared too. We all were.

304
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:30,259
We wanted a miracle, you see, Bobby.

305
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:34,464
We wanted him the way he was,
the old Nagurski.

306
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:38,159
We wanted him the way he was
in the old days.

307
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:43,064
Did he do good?
l don't wanna hear this if he didn't.

308
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:48,946
The quarterback gave him the ball...

309
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:52,746
...and Nagurski ran slowly
up to the line...

310
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:55,378
...and the Cardinals crushed him.

311
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:56,947
But somehow...

312
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:02,649
...somehow, he gained a few yards.

313
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,553
Next play, the same.

314
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:08,961
They just kept giving the ball
to the old man...

315
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:15,404
...and the Bears began to move down
the field, five yards, seven more.

316
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:20,775
lf he could score for us,
we'd be champions again.

317
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:26,550
Go on, Ted! You can't stop!

318
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:33,651
Ted!

319
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:37,495
Come on. l gotta know
what happened.

320
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,032
Come on.

321
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:46,602
You know what your dad did then?

322
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:48,898
No, what did my father do?

323
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:53,840
We were all screaming. We couldn't
believe what was happening.

324
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:56,207
My God, what was it? Go on.

325
00:28:56,882 --> 00:29:01,512
lt was our miracle, you see,
because he was crawling.

326
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:05,948
Bronko Nagurski was crawling
toward the goal line...

327
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:09,650
...and they did everything
they could to stop him.

328
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:12,353
But nothing could stop him.

329
00:29:12,564 --> 00:29:17,058
Yeah, that's right, Bobby.
Not on that day.

330
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:21,667
Not when your dad and l
saw the miracle...

331
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:24,742
...when the old man brought us home.

332
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,771
He scored. He scored for us.

333
00:29:32,884 --> 00:29:34,681
We were champions again.

334
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,749
l just knew he would.

335
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:46,125
Then he was gone again,
back to the North where he came from.

336
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:50,092
Bronko Nagurski.

337
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,133
Bobby? Bobby-o!

338
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:14,117
-Ted?
-Yeah?

339
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:17,753
Well, l know the low men
don't exist...

340
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,155
...but if they started
driving around here...

341
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:25,497
...and the signs started
appearing on the poles....

342
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,201
Well, we both know
that couldn't happen.

343
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:32,165
But if it did...

344
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:45,247
...would you have to go away?

345
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:51,120
lt wouldn't be safe
for me here.

346
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:54,650
And wishing cannot make it so.

347
00:30:54,962 --> 00:30:56,361
Bobby!

348
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,873
Bobby? This Ted of yours...

349
00:31:18,352 --> 00:31:21,048
...did he say where he's from?

350
00:31:21,622 --> 00:31:24,591
Someplace not as nice as here,
l think.

351
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:31,093
Well, that doesn't tell us much,
does it?

352
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:35,299
-Anything else?
-Nope.

353
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:40,395
Bobby?

354
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:49,208
-Does he...?
-What?

355
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:55,418
Nothing.

356
00:31:57,124 --> 00:32:00,093
You'll tell me if
anything unusual happens?

357
00:32:02,996 --> 00:32:04,429
Hello?

358
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,893
Hi.

359
00:32:09,703 --> 00:32:11,193
You promised.

360
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:13,168
l really need the--

361
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,008
Who was that?

362
00:32:17,678 --> 00:32:20,272
Nothing, honey.
Just a wrong number.

363
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:29,282
Son of a bitch!

364
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,846
-l know it's you!
-Your mom says she's almost ready.

365
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,542
-Think Ted would come?
-To the fair?

366
00:32:59,753 --> 00:33:02,813
-Don't you think we should ask?
-l guess.

367
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:06,855
-You do it. l'll get Sully.
-Okay.

368
00:33:08,962 --> 00:33:13,058
-Do you like being beaten by a girl?
-Hey, no fair.

369
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,839
-Mr. Biderman needs me to go in.
-On Saturday?

370
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:33,247
-Some people have to work for money.
-Mom, you promised.

371
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:36,820
These are just lKools.
Read the advertising:

372
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:41,323
""lKools. They cool the throat.""
They're hardly cigarettes at all.

373
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:42,859
-Mom?
-What?

374
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,190
Can l have money for the rides?

375
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,198
You never stop, do you?
Aren't you earning money now?

376
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,562
For the bike.

377
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:55,936
lf you want to spend it on rides with
your girlfriend, that's your business.

378
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:19,122
Ted? lt's me.
You wanna come to the fair?

379
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:25,794
Ted?

380
00:34:45,058 --> 00:34:47,288
ls everything okay?

381
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,703
Ted, wake up.

382
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:03,972
Ted, you have to help me.

383
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:07,179
Ted, l don't know what to do.

384
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:10,046
They draw west now.

385
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:12,919
Who? Jesus, Ted, please.

386
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,754
They draw west now,
but they may be back.

387
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:26,462
Ted, please.
You can't die on me.

388
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,461
Please....

389
00:35:33,974 --> 00:35:35,737
Oh, my God.

390
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,771
What just happened?

391
00:35:43,116 --> 00:35:44,674
Went off again, did l?

392
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:49,615
-You mean, like at the fridge?
-Yeah.

393
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:52,451
No, way worse.

394
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,927
l thought you were having a fit.

395
00:35:58,832 --> 00:35:59,924
lt's all right.

396
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,094
lf it happens again,
don't touch me.

397
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:06,431
Nobody should touch me,
that's all.

398
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,532
Sorry.

399
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:14,342
-ls it safe to leave you alone?
-Yeah.

400
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,275
lt's okay.

401
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:25,318
Okay.

402
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,755
Mrs. Gerber's taking us to the fair.

403
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:36,333
Carol and l thought you
might like to come.

404
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:41,633
Thank you, Bobby,
but l think just now, it's not wise.

405
00:36:42,642 --> 00:36:44,735
-Okay.
-Okay.

406
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,684
The cigarettes are on the table.

407
00:36:57,023 --> 00:36:58,854
Thanks, kiddo.

408
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:01,425
What's so funny?

409
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:06,895
You run along now. Enjoy yourself.
Don't fall out of anything.

410
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:30,913
Yes! That one.

411
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,966
No!

412
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,744
Yes!

413
00:37:57,117 --> 00:37:58,880
What are you gonna name it?

414
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:04,284
All right. Step right up!
Hey, who feels lucky?

415
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,891
Find the queen of hearts and win.

416
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:09,823
-lt already happened!
-Just once.

417
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,759
Easy peas-y Japanese-y.

418
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:14,991
Just find the queen of hearts.

419
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:19,498
-Put down your bet. l'll do it again.
-A quarter.

420
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:20,730
See, a jack.

421
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:26,406
We got the king and we got the queen.
Tell me where she lands.

422
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,847
-Fortune awaits you.
-That one there.

423
00:38:35,755 --> 00:38:37,120
-Yes!
-Genius.

424
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:41,054
-l told you!
-Wait. Double and add a half-dollar.

425
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:42,421
Okay.

426
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,806
That one there.

427
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:59,001
-Heartbreak.
-That's enough. l have to stop.

428
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,773
-l can spot his moves.
-l better give up then.

429
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:05,712
-Just a quarter.
-One, okay.

430
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:12,550
Up and down, all around.
ln and out, all about.

431
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:14,158
Now they're back...

432
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,158
...side by side.

433
00:39:17,363 --> 00:39:20,457
Tell me, mister.
Where's she hide?

434
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:22,798
lt's on the right.

435
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:26,397
No. lt's the one on the left.
Right there.

436
00:39:29,676 --> 00:39:31,667
-Okay, enough.
-There she is.

437
00:39:31,878 --> 00:39:34,244
-Bobby was right.
-A prodigy, huh?

438
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:38,907
-Why don't you win it back?
-l could, but l can't play for money.

439
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,108
A boast-y boy.

440
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,221
Says he can win,
but afraid to back it up.

441
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:47,218
l could have my money back.
Come on. Beat him.

442
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:51,761
-l can't. Your mother won't be happy.
-Beat him, come on.

443
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:55,230
My mom's never happy.
lt's all l got.

444
00:39:55,435 --> 00:40:00,668
This is the move that stunned
the sheik of Araby. Behold.

445
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:12,781
This one here, in the middle.

446
00:40:17,924 --> 00:40:19,858
-All right!
-That's it!

447
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:23,689
A lucky guess.

448
00:40:23,897 --> 00:40:27,765
Double your bet.
That way we all go home happy.

449
00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:30,225
Fine.

450
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,872
This one is five years of my life.

451
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:22,448
This one here.

452
00:41:24,991 --> 00:41:27,186
Nobody ever beat that shuffle.

453
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:32,693
Well, mister,
is it or isn't it?

454
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,733
-Yes, that's it! Okay.
-All right!

455
00:41:38,938 --> 00:41:42,465
-lt was a fluke.
-You bet it was a fluke.

456
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,543
Now beat it, kid.

457
00:41:47,747 --> 00:41:51,513
Okay, gang, let's go. That's enough.
Come on, Bobby.

458
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:56,485
Step right up!
We had a winner!

459
00:41:56,689 --> 00:41:59,453
lt's easy as can be.
Easy peas-y Japanese-y!

460
00:42:08,468 --> 00:42:09,457
Yes, yes.

461
00:42:20,546 --> 00:42:22,013
Don't be afraid.

462
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:26,675
When we swung out, l was afraid
we would fall to our doom.

463
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:30,121
We're as safe as can be.

464
00:42:33,893 --> 00:42:36,487
What do you think you're doing?

465
00:42:36,696 --> 00:42:39,494
Well, l thought you wanted me to.

466
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,259
l just wasn't ready, that's all.

467
00:42:44,904 --> 00:42:46,337
Okay.

468
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:53,444
-Bobby, do it again.
-l better not. You'll tell.

469
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,848
No, it'll be our secret.
Hurry, before we go down.

470
00:43:01,888 --> 00:43:05,153
Bobby, l'm dying here.

471
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:28,437
Thank you.
That was the nicest thing.

472
00:43:29,749 --> 00:43:33,651
lt'll be the kiss by which
all others will be judged.

473
00:43:33,853 --> 00:43:35,081
What?

474
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:38,386
Sounded better when Ted said it.

475
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:03,077
You knew, didn't you, where
the queen of hearts was.

476
00:44:04,384 --> 00:44:08,184
l could tell what was
going on in his head.

477
00:44:08,388 --> 00:44:12,415
Every thought he had, l knew,
and he couldn't fool me.

478
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:15,718
Can you tell what's in Sully's head?

479
00:44:17,096 --> 00:44:18,996
Sully's head's always empty.

480
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:23,396
Oh, yeah? Maybe l'm thinking
of getting a new glove.

481
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:26,868
You are?
Well, what about that one?

482
00:44:28,107 --> 00:44:30,940
-Want it?
-Are you kidding? l love it!

483
00:44:31,244 --> 00:44:34,008
-Then, Bobby, it's yours.
-lt is?

484
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,443
l'll leave it to you in my will.

485
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:42,210
-Sully, you just love doing that!
-l got you again.

486
00:44:44,424 --> 00:44:46,892
You know, when you're young...

487
00:44:47,093 --> 00:44:49,994
...you have moments
of such happiness...

488
00:44:50,196 --> 00:44:54,030
...you think you're living
in someplace magical...

489
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,926
...like Atlantis must have been.

490
00:44:57,136 --> 00:45:01,732
-Carol, l owe you $ 75. lt's your turn.
-Okay.

491
00:45:03,843 --> 00:45:06,368
-Here, give me $25 back.
-Twenty-five.

492
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,410
-Here. $22.
-Okay. Wait, no!

493
00:45:08,614 --> 00:45:13,142
-No! Hold on.
-Oh, yeah. No.

494
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:14,910
Then we grow up...

495
00:45:17,156 --> 00:45:19,818
...and our hearts break in two.

496
00:45:20,026 --> 00:45:22,551
-Yes! l own it!
-Wait, no!

497
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:26,755
-What? No, l do.
-No! He does.

498
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,608
-Come on.
-Hang on.

499
00:45:46,886 --> 00:45:48,410
What is it?

500
00:45:52,391 --> 00:45:54,188
l wonder what it means?

501
00:45:54,727 --> 00:45:58,788
lt means somebody lost their pet,
goofball. Come on.

502
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:02,190
Yeah, but maybe it's a secret code.

503
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:04,198
What are you talking about?

504
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:07,304
-Fairy. l'll take that!
-l'm not a fairy!

505
00:46:07,507 --> 00:46:10,374
-Don't talk to them!
-How are your tits?

506
00:46:10,576 --> 00:46:13,545
-Go away!
-Grow up, Harry Doolin!

507
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,748
The Lone Ranger.

508
00:46:27,193 --> 00:46:29,991
-Hi-ho, Silver!
-Bobby, how was school?

509
00:46:30,196 --> 00:46:32,357
-Good.
-You'll never guess.

510
00:46:32,565 --> 00:46:36,729
Don-- Mr. Biderman
has invited me to a seminar...

511
00:46:36,936 --> 00:46:40,599
...on the weekend.
""Real Estate in the '60s.""

512
00:46:40,806 --> 00:46:45,834
Mr. Cushman and Mr. Dean are going,
but l was amazed he asked me.

513
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,976
Bobby?

514
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:53,374
l so want to be an agent.
This is a big chance for me.

515
00:46:53,586 --> 00:46:55,281
Great, when is it?

516
00:46:55,488 --> 00:46:57,456
Friday. Just for two nights.

517
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:01,519
-You can't go to your girlfriend's.
-She's not my girl--

518
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:04,389
Whatever. You can't stay there...

519
00:47:04,597 --> 00:47:08,055
...so l'm gonna ask
Sully's mother to put you up.

520
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:09,427
That won't work.

521
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:11,936
But it has to.

522
00:47:12,605 --> 00:47:14,869
They're gonna visit his grandma.

523
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:19,166
Just my luck.
Just my rotten luck.

524
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:29,844
Why don't you ask your friend
to come down for a cup of tea?

525
00:47:30,856 --> 00:47:32,084
Okay.

526
00:47:39,332 --> 00:47:42,028
l'm sorry, Mrs. Garfield, but no.

527
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,068
l wouldn't be much of a
babysitter for Bobby.

528
00:47:46,272 --> 00:47:50,333
But l've never been invited
to a real seminar before.

529
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:55,071
You could sleep on the couch,
and you could go to the diner...

530
00:47:55,281 --> 00:47:58,341
...and maybe even take in a movie.

531
00:48:00,052 --> 00:48:03,419
l'll tell you what.
lf Bobby wants me to, l will.

532
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:08,818
Bobby?

533
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:13,294
How come you get to have
all the fun?

534
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:16,729
Don't you want me to better myself?

535
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,702
Yeah, but what about me?
l never get what l want.

536
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,598
Who knows?

537
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:29,941
Maybe l'll get a raise after this.
Who knows what l can afford then?

538
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:36,354
l guess, if it's only a weekend.

539
00:48:41,027 --> 00:48:43,757
-Thank you.
-Good.

540
00:49:24,303 --> 00:49:27,101
-Have you ever heard of privacy?
-Sorry.

541
00:49:27,306 --> 00:49:30,571
Wait, you can't just leave.

542
00:49:31,043 --> 00:49:35,002
-What do l do, then?
-Tell me, how do l look?

543
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:38,406
You look like my mom.

544
00:49:38,718 --> 00:49:41,619
The dress!

545
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,781
Wow!

546
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,615
Be an angel.

547
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:54,823
-Guess it must have cost a ton.
-Don't you start on that.

548
00:50:32,772 --> 00:50:35,240
""And in this reporter's opinion...

549
00:50:35,441 --> 00:50:39,969
...the Haywood-Albini fight
could tarnish a sterling record.""

550
00:50:42,715 --> 00:50:45,548
l'd back Hollywood Haywood any day.

551
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,580
Ted, you listening?

552
00:50:48,788 --> 00:50:51,154
Their senses grow keener.

553
00:50:54,727 --> 00:50:59,960
Hey, kiddo, you're too young to smoke.

554
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,965
So how long this time?

555
00:51:03,169 --> 00:51:06,036
Breaking records left and right.

556
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,633
Well, they're coming closer.

557
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:15,144
They're doing a good job
of hiding from me.

558
00:51:15,347 --> 00:51:19,477
-Haven't seen a single thing yet.
-Good.

559
00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:21,676
l've been wrong before.

560
00:51:23,656 --> 00:51:25,715
So go on about the fight.

561
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:29,417
Okay. So this old guy, Albini...?

562
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:34,224
He's gonna take on Hollywood Haywood
tomorrow in New York.

563
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:39,063
-Sounds like Albini's gonna get beat.
-lt sure does.

564
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:41,736
Well, l might place a bet.

565
00:51:41,941 --> 00:51:45,468
We may go into town
after your mother leaves.

566
00:51:45,678 --> 00:51:49,375
Get a bite to eat.
See a movie.

567
00:51:49,615 --> 00:51:51,913
Ever hear of Village of the Damned?.

568
00:51:53,385 --> 00:51:58,482
lt's about evil, little kids
taken over by alien forces.

569
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,060
There you go.

570
00:52:17,977 --> 00:52:19,410
What's up?

571
00:52:20,446 --> 00:52:23,006
Oh, no, your bike.

572
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,078
Stay right there, Bobby.

573
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,339
Thank you.

574
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:09,988
Hey, Gerber Baby!

575
00:53:13,198 --> 00:53:15,462
-Still with your fairy?
-Yeah.

576
00:53:15,668 --> 00:53:17,135
Come on, let's go home.

577
00:53:17,336 --> 00:53:20,032
-Where you going?
-This isn't funny!

578
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,503
lt's a riot, Gerber Baby.

579
00:53:23,142 --> 00:53:24,734
Hey, lay off her!

580
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,878
Hey, the little guy's a hero.

581
00:53:27,546 --> 00:53:30,208
Stop me, fairy.
Be a man.

582
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,509
l asked how your tits were.

583
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:35,380
l wanna feel for myself.

584
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,054
Get away from me!

585
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:39,223
Leave her alone!

586
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,586
She's just a Gerber baby.

587
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,959
-Bastard!
-Hey, guys?

588
00:53:44,163 --> 00:53:46,996
-Let's beat this queer up.
-Yeah.

589
00:53:57,209 --> 00:54:01,407
-Ted, go home.
-We're all going home, Bobby.

590
00:54:02,681 --> 00:54:05,582
Who's that, your fairy godfather?

591
00:54:06,251 --> 00:54:10,381
Richie O'Rourke, Willie Sherman,
and Harry Doolin.

592
00:54:10,589 --> 00:54:12,853
The unholy trio of St. Gabe's.

593
00:54:14,226 --> 00:54:15,557
How do you know us?

594
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:18,457
Come over here.
Find out what l know.

595
00:54:30,376 --> 00:54:32,537
You're going to apologize.

596
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:36,581
-l don't think so.
-Shall l tell you why?

597
00:54:37,516 --> 00:54:40,917
Because l know your dark secret.

598
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,749
-And l will tell the world.
-l got no secret.

599
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:50,494
You like calling people queer
and fairy and such words?

600
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:53,921
Look in my eyes, Harry Doolin.

601
00:54:55,067 --> 00:54:56,830
Tell me what you see.

602
00:54:58,437 --> 00:55:04,171
Do you see someone in your mother's
clothes when he thinks no one is looking?

603
00:55:05,811 --> 00:55:08,678
Tell the whole, wide world.

604
00:55:09,615 --> 00:55:11,913
Now say, ""l'm sorry, Carol.""

605
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,781
l'm sorry, Carol.

606
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:29,924
-What did he say?
-Yeah, what?

607
00:55:30,135 --> 00:55:31,466
Nothing.

608
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:36,975
Thank you, kind sir.

609
00:55:37,176 --> 00:55:38,905
What did you say to him?

610
00:55:39,111 --> 00:55:42,740
Just intellectual chitchat
among men of goodwill.

611
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:47,318
-Ted?
-Yes, sweet Carol?

612
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:52,115
-You're a very strange person.
-Tell no one.

613
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:56,457
All right, here we go. Come on!

614
00:55:56,662 --> 00:55:57,686
Settle down.

615
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,386
Sully's got the ball!

616
00:55:59,598 --> 00:56:01,828
-Oh, no!
-Oh, touchdown!

617
00:56:02,034 --> 00:56:03,331
-Get in.
-All right.

618
00:56:03,535 --> 00:56:05,025
-Get the dog!
-Come on!

619
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:11,403
-And away we go!
-Bye!

620
00:56:11,877 --> 00:56:16,371
-Bye! See you.
-Have a good trip. See you.

621
00:56:40,405 --> 00:56:42,339
Oh, my gosh. The low men.

622
00:56:49,248 --> 00:56:51,148
Where's the little lady?

623
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:54,717
There he is. On time.
Give me a little kiss.

624
00:56:55,754 --> 00:56:57,654
Get the bags, dear.

625
00:56:58,924 --> 00:57:01,620
-Good afternoon.
-You look great.

626
00:57:01,827 --> 00:57:03,556
-How are you?
-Fine.

627
00:57:03,762 --> 00:57:06,230
-Here, l'll take that.
-Thank you.

628
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:09,400
-Need a hand with those, sport?
-Nope.

629
00:57:11,003 --> 00:57:13,233
A real helpful kid there.

630
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,572
He's a good boy.

631
00:57:15,774 --> 00:57:16,763
l'm sure he is.

632
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,172
-What a beautiful day.
-Yes, it is.

633
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:26,817
-Mr. Cushman, Mr. Dean.
-Liz.

634
00:57:27,019 --> 00:57:29,783
-Good day for a drive.
-Yes, isn't it?

635
00:57:31,623 --> 00:57:32,920
Women.

636
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:37,893
Always have to bring the farm.

637
00:57:38,397 --> 00:57:41,093
Well, you know what they say.

638
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,098
Can't live with them, can't live
without them, can't shoot them...

639
00:57:46,772 --> 00:57:48,672
...outside of Montana.

640
00:58:02,154 --> 00:58:04,281
Don't do anything l wouldn't do.

641
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:07,253
But if you do, name it after me.

642
00:58:20,906 --> 00:58:24,637
l trust him about as far
as l can sling a piano.

643
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:28,308
Yeah, l'm worried for my mom.

644
00:58:31,817 --> 00:58:33,910
l'm worried for us all.

645
00:58:39,124 --> 00:58:40,989
-So scary!
-Oh, l know!

646
00:58:41,193 --> 00:58:43,184
-What now?
-Had enough to eat?

647
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:46,728
Are you kidding,
after those hot dogs?

648
00:58:46,932 --> 00:58:49,924
So, what do they call
this part of town?

649
00:58:50,135 --> 00:58:53,434
l've heard it referred to
as ""down there.""

650
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:57,635
You see, every city
has a place where...

651
00:58:57,843 --> 00:59:00,573
...your last name doesn't matter.

652
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:05,808
Wine comes in a paper sack,
and you can buy anything...

653
00:59:06,652 --> 00:59:09,246
...if you've got cash in your pocket.

654
00:59:10,522 --> 00:59:12,114
Hey, come on.

655
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:17,293
-Stay close now.
-Don't worry about that.

656
00:59:17,496 --> 00:59:22,524
You shouldn't be in a place like this,
but l can't leave you here. So...

657
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:24,259
...let's go.

658
00:59:25,003 --> 00:59:29,337
Hollywood Haywood versus Eddie Albini,
tomorrow night, New York.

659
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:31,338
l've got money to burn.

660
00:59:31,543 --> 00:59:32,942
What do you say?

661
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,343
Not one step.

662
00:59:48,193 --> 00:59:51,959
Making good on that promise,
look how he piles into Freon.

663
01:00:02,507 --> 01:00:04,031
Hey, kid.

664
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:06,042
What's your name?

665
01:00:06,878 --> 01:00:09,142
Bobby. Bobby Garfield.

666
01:00:09,348 --> 01:00:11,077
Been in before?

667
01:00:11,283 --> 01:00:12,272
No, ma'am.

668
01:00:13,518 --> 01:00:14,985
You look familiar.

669
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:20,187
Did l know your father?

670
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,386
My father's dead.
He died years ago.

671
01:00:25,364 --> 01:00:26,524
Was he Bobby too?

672
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,596
Bobby Garfield. Yes, ma'am.

673
01:00:30,302 --> 01:00:32,293
He was just like me.

674
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,438
Yeah, he was a good customer.

675
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:36,436
l liked him.

676
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:38,365
Yeah, he used to...

677
01:00:38,577 --> 01:00:41,740
...stop in for a beer now and then.

678
01:00:43,315 --> 01:00:47,115
Like on Mondays, when it's just
dead in here...

679
01:00:47,319 --> 01:00:50,482
...and in no time flat
we were all laughing.

680
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,620
Yeah, not a mean bone in his body.

681
01:00:55,727 --> 01:00:57,524
He was generous too.

682
01:00:57,963 --> 01:01:00,295
Not too many like that in here.

683
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,027
He'd never buy a drunk a drink.
l admired that.

684
01:01:05,237 --> 01:01:08,764
He also never met an inside
straight he didn't like.

685
01:01:09,341 --> 01:01:11,138
Who told you that?

686
01:01:11,676 --> 01:01:13,667
l remember the big losers.

687
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:16,279
Most nights he walked out of here...

688
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:19,314
...with a little more
than he came in with.

689
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:24,785
Yeah, he was a hell of a card player,
Bobby was.

690
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,197
lKeep that, if you want.

691
01:01:35,033 --> 01:01:37,126
He's handsome, don't you think?

692
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:41,261
You've got that to look forward to.

693
01:01:43,642 --> 01:01:45,507
You got a girlfriend?

694
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:47,478
Yes, ma'am.

695
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,210
Pretty?

696
01:01:49,714 --> 01:01:52,239
Yes, ma'am. Her name's Carol.

697
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:54,612
She's a real hotsie-totsie.

698
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:59,654
A what?

699
01:01:59,858 --> 01:02:01,485
Let's go. Taxi's waiting.

700
01:02:01,693 --> 01:02:04,787
My dad came here!
He didn't lose our money.

701
01:02:04,996 --> 01:02:08,329
He was generous and funny
and people liked him!

702
01:02:08,533 --> 01:02:10,501
-Good.
-lsn't that a thing?

703
01:02:10,702 --> 01:02:13,637
Yeah. Lucky for us
we came in here, l'd say.

704
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,830
Yes, it is a wonderful thing.

705
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:21,373
-How much did you bet?
-All l've got. $200 on Albini.

706
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:25,949
-You think Albini can beat Haywood?
-l think he can knock him out.

707
01:02:26,852 --> 01:02:28,319
l bet 10-to-1 odds.

708
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,785
-Do you know anything about boxing?
-Nothing.

709
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,548
1 49 Broad Street.

710
01:02:33,758 --> 01:02:35,225
lt'll be on the radio.

711
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:37,395
We'll listen tomorrow night.

712
01:02:37,596 --> 01:02:38,961
l hope you're right.

713
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:42,725
-Oh, no. Here they come! Get down!
-What is it?

714
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:47,064
Take your mind away! Don't be scared.
Think of something else.

715
01:02:47,272 --> 01:02:48,466
-How?
-Carol.

716
01:02:48,673 --> 01:02:52,734
Think of Carol. Don't let her go.
Think of a happy memory.

717
01:02:52,944 --> 01:02:54,309
Take your mind away!

718
01:02:54,513 --> 01:02:57,482
Think of a happy memory.
Don't let her go.

719
01:03:42,627 --> 01:03:45,152
Good night, kiddo. l'm proud of you.

720
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,764
l'm sorry l didn't believe you
about the low men.

721
01:03:48,967 --> 01:03:50,264
l know.

722
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:56,402
Ted, my father never bought
a drunk a drink.

723
01:03:57,509 --> 01:03:59,739
What does that mean, exactly?

724
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,738
lt means he was a good man.
He was honest.

725
01:04:06,518 --> 01:04:09,715
And he never added
to the troubles of the world.

726
01:04:09,921 --> 01:04:11,149
Okay?

727
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:15,392
-Good night.
-Good night.

728
01:04:25,537 --> 01:04:28,005
There's the bell.
Haywood coming out...

729
01:04:28,206 --> 01:04:30,572
...throwing punches, running in.

730
01:04:30,775 --> 01:04:33,005
Now attacking Albini at will.

731
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:37,944
Albini, arms hanging like weights,
occasionally throwing a weak punch.

732
01:04:38,149 --> 01:04:40,515
The punches are flying! Hollywood--

733
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:42,118
Oh, my goodness!

734
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:47,019
Out of nowhere, a right by Albini
hits Hollywood to the head...

735
01:04:47,225 --> 01:04:48,317
...and to the mat!

736
01:04:48,526 --> 01:04:51,495
They're counting him out. 8...9... 10!

737
01:04:51,696 --> 01:04:52,924
Oh, my goodness!

738
01:04:53,131 --> 01:04:56,692
One of the most improbable finishes
to a fight, ever!

739
01:04:56,901 --> 01:04:59,233
Albini has beat Hollywood Haywood!

740
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,270
This one has got to be reviewed!

741
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,098
Wow.

742
01:05:05,877 --> 01:05:09,870
You just won 2000 bucks.

743
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,607
Hello?

744
01:05:14,819 --> 01:05:16,252
Mrs. Garfield.

745
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,217
Yes, fine. l'll get him.

746
01:05:18,423 --> 01:05:20,220
Bobby? lt's your mother.

747
01:05:20,425 --> 01:05:21,824
Okay.

748
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:26,490
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, honey.

749
01:05:26,931 --> 01:05:29,661
-Have you missed me?
-Of course I have.

750
01:05:30,168 --> 01:05:32,796
But l'm trying not to be too sad.

751
01:05:33,238 --> 01:05:34,933
Oh, good.

752
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,506
-Brush your teeth.
-I did.

753
01:05:37,709 --> 01:05:39,074
Good boy.

754
01:05:39,277 --> 01:05:43,839
l can't chat all night. There's
a cocktail party for us delegates...

755
01:05:44,049 --> 01:05:46,677
...down in the ballroom and l'm--

756
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,983
Are you there?

757
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:52,054
l dropped the phone.
l love you, Bobby!

758
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:54,219
Don--!

759
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:02,557
That's funny.

760
01:06:05,303 --> 01:06:07,100
Got cut off.

761
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:20,177
That 2000....

762
01:06:21,386 --> 01:06:25,220
-lt's traveling money, isn't it?
-Yeah, it is.

763
01:06:29,761 --> 01:06:34,221
l lied to you. l didn't tell you
about the lost pet sign l saw.

764
01:06:34,432 --> 01:06:35,421
l know.

765
01:06:37,502 --> 01:06:39,493
When will you leave?

766
01:06:39,738 --> 01:06:42,229
Tomorrow, when your mother gets back.

767
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,501
Collect my winnings from Len Files
at the Corner Pocket....

768
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:47,769
Then go.

769
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,243
Will l ever see you again?

770
01:06:53,752 --> 01:06:55,049
No.

771
01:06:56,621 --> 01:06:59,021
And wishing can't make it so.

772
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,931
l don't want you to go.

773
01:07:14,672 --> 01:07:17,232
lt's all for the best, kiddo.

774
01:07:17,442 --> 01:07:19,410
lt's all for the best.

775
01:07:44,702 --> 01:07:48,832
""ln yet another startling
development in Washington...

776
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:53,943
...J. Edgar Hoover, the director of
the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation...

777
01:07:54,145 --> 01:07:58,309
...today issued a statement denying
the Bureau was involved...

778
01:07:58,516 --> 01:08:03,078
...in recruiting psychics
in the battle against Communism.""

779
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:13,924
That's really what all this is about,
isn't it, Ted?

780
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:22,936
Want a root beer?

781
01:08:23,908 --> 01:08:28,845
That's the only good thing about you
going. l can't stand that stuff.

782
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,114
Yeah, l know.

783
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:35,385
-Do you know everything?
-Nope.

784
01:08:37,455 --> 01:08:40,185
So what happens when you touch people?

785
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:44,991
l pass on a kind of window
into other people's minds.

786
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:49,792
ls that why they want you?
This window?

787
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:54,301
Yeah. l know certain things,
see certain things.

788
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:58,168
Some see it as a gift,
but to me it's always been a burden.

789
01:08:58,376 --> 01:09:00,844
What l see has a value for some.

790
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:03,945
Maybe l escaped them this time.

791
01:09:04,148 --> 01:09:05,410
Thanks.

792
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:08,184
Cheers.

793
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,009
To good health.

794
01:09:12,724 --> 01:09:14,123
Oh, well.

795
01:09:14,893 --> 01:09:17,555
We're all just passing through, kiddo.

796
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:21,028
Just passing through, that's all.

797
01:09:23,768 --> 01:09:26,669
Tell Carol l'd like to
say goodbye to her.

798
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:27,929
Sure.

799
01:09:33,845 --> 01:09:35,972
-Hey, Bobby!
-Yeah?

800
01:09:37,582 --> 01:09:40,107
l think you should go find her now.

801
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:43,116
Okay.

802
01:10:17,355 --> 01:10:19,755
-Hey, Bobby.
-ls Carol home?

803
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:22,290
No, she went to the ravine
to read...

804
01:10:22,493 --> 01:10:24,085
...by the tree.

805
01:10:51,489 --> 01:10:54,458
You don't scare me, Bobby Garfield.

806
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:56,957
lf it isn't the Gerber baby.

807
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,289
No! Please!

808
01:11:05,603 --> 01:11:06,592
Harry?

809
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:25,189
Carol! Carol!

810
01:11:43,408 --> 01:11:45,808
ls everything okay?

811
01:11:46,944 --> 01:11:50,107
He hit me, Bobby. He hit me hard.

812
01:11:50,314 --> 01:11:51,576
lt's okay.

813
01:11:52,216 --> 01:11:54,184
-l'll go get help!
-No, please!

814
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,347
Don't leave me alone.
He might come back.

815
01:11:57,555 --> 01:11:58,647
lt'll be okay.

816
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,323
Can you walk?

817
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:01,514
l don't know.

818
01:12:01,726 --> 01:12:04,593
-Just try, okay?
-Maybe, l don't know.

819
01:12:08,332 --> 01:12:09,424
lt'll be okay.

820
01:12:09,767 --> 01:12:12,702
lt's okay.
Here, try and stand up, okay?

821
01:12:23,414 --> 01:12:26,679
You have to get on my back, okay?

822
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:31,082
-Bobby, l can't!
-Yes, you can.

823
01:12:32,323 --> 01:12:33,347
You can.

824
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:37,050
You have to think about
something else, okay?

825
01:12:38,763 --> 01:12:40,731
Here, get on my back.

826
01:12:41,132 --> 01:12:44,499
Remember at school how we
rode piggyback at recess?

827
01:12:44,702 --> 01:12:47,330
-Yeah.
-This is just like that, okay?

828
01:13:11,062 --> 01:13:14,225
-Bronko Nagurski.
-Nagurski.

829
01:13:21,839 --> 01:13:23,602
Ten yards...

830
01:13:23,808 --> 01:13:26,242
...seven yards....

831
01:13:31,082 --> 01:13:33,573
Nothing could stop him.

832
01:14:05,082 --> 01:14:06,276
Ted!

833
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,482
Help.

834
01:14:10,855 --> 01:14:12,550
l think her arm's broken.

835
01:14:12,757 --> 01:14:14,918
Come on, Carol. lt's all right.

836
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,435
lt's all right.

837
01:14:31,976 --> 01:14:33,534
My arm.

838
01:14:33,744 --> 01:14:36,042
Bobby, take her hand, all right?

839
01:14:38,449 --> 01:14:39,814
Oh, yes.

840
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:44,044
One great, big boy
against one little girl.

841
01:14:44,388 --> 01:14:49,052
He's probably so afraid of you.
Thought you had the heart of a lion.

842
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,419
He hurt me, Ted.

843
01:14:51,629 --> 01:14:54,063
l know. Believe me, l know.

844
01:14:54,565 --> 01:14:59,025
Now listen. l've got to look
at your shoulder. Understand?

845
01:14:59,237 --> 01:15:01,068
l don't want to hurt you.

846
01:15:02,406 --> 01:15:04,203
Oh, my.

847
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,442
He broke my arm.

848
01:15:06,644 --> 01:15:09,204
No, l think it's just dislocated.

849
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,677
And l think l can fix it.

850
01:15:14,318 --> 01:15:17,151
Are you a doctor, Ted?

851
01:15:17,355 --> 01:15:18,913
No, l'm not a doctor.

852
01:15:19,523 --> 01:15:22,117
But as you noted, l'm very strange.

853
01:15:22,326 --> 01:15:24,521
So who knows what l can do?

854
01:15:24,929 --> 01:15:27,261
Do you have the heart of a lion?

855
01:15:30,868 --> 01:15:33,530
Just close your eyes
and try and relax.

856
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:36,229
Bobby, give me your belt.

857
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:41,041
Now, Carol, do you know
what pain does?

858
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:43,713
lt rises and travels up the body.

859
01:15:44,548 --> 01:15:46,448
That's it. Thank you.

860
01:15:46,651 --> 01:15:48,312
Listen to me, Carol.

861
01:15:48,519 --> 01:15:50,487
Just listen and relax.

862
01:15:50,688 --> 01:15:53,521
l want you to bite down hard
on the belt.

863
01:15:53,724 --> 01:15:58,218
You're going to bite down
on Bobby's belt and catch the pain.

864
01:15:59,163 --> 01:16:00,858
Now relax.

865
01:16:01,065 --> 01:16:02,726
Close your eyes.

866
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,525
lKeep them closed.

867
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:07,203
You're safe. Just breathe in.

868
01:16:07,872 --> 01:16:11,137
Breathe out. That's it.
There's no pain.

869
01:16:11,409 --> 01:16:14,003
Just listen to my voice.

870
01:16:15,813 --> 01:16:18,714
l can sense them
closing in on me, Bobby.

871
01:16:19,483 --> 01:16:22,748
l know. There's signs everywhere.

872
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,487
Here we go.

873
01:16:24,689 --> 01:16:27,487
Bite down hard and catch-- Here we go.

874
01:16:31,362 --> 01:16:32,624
All right.

875
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,119
There.

876
01:16:34,332 --> 01:16:35,799
Ted?

877
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,598
lt doesn't hurt anymore.

878
01:16:39,437 --> 01:16:41,667
You do have the heart of a lion.

879
01:16:42,506 --> 01:16:44,235
You did well, Carol.

880
01:16:44,442 --> 01:16:46,774
What the hell is going on in here?

881
01:16:47,745 --> 01:16:49,645
Mom, what happened to you?

882
01:16:49,847 --> 01:16:54,614
-Take your hands off that little girl!
-Mom, he didn't do anything bad!

883
01:16:54,919 --> 01:16:57,353
How dare you touch her!

884
01:16:57,555 --> 01:16:59,250
He didn't hurt her!

885
01:16:59,457 --> 01:17:02,085
l brought her so Ted could help her!

886
01:17:02,293 --> 01:17:06,127
Go to your room!
And you! You are going to jail!

887
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:09,322
What happened to you
didn't happen to her.

888
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:13,102
-Why's her blouse open?
-Her shoulder's hurt!

889
01:17:13,304 --> 01:17:15,101
l said, go to your room!

890
01:17:15,306 --> 01:17:17,331
What Bobby said was true!

891
01:17:19,877 --> 01:17:22,471
Let's clean you up in the bathroom.

892
01:17:22,813 --> 01:17:25,145
He carried me up the hill.

893
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,715
Ted took my pain away.

894
01:17:27,918 --> 01:17:29,613
Don't you touch her!

895
01:17:31,222 --> 01:17:32,519
Go in the bathroom.

896
01:17:32,723 --> 01:17:35,886
l'm calling the police
to tell them everything.

897
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,524
Tell them what happened to you.

898
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:42,524
You weren't there. You couldn't know.

899
01:17:42,733 --> 01:17:44,200
l know.

900
01:17:44,402 --> 01:17:48,065
l know you didn't realize
the seminar would involve that.

901
01:17:48,272 --> 01:17:52,368
And l know he's growing up
while your mind is on other things.

902
01:17:56,447 --> 01:18:01,384
l'm taking that child home. And you
better not be here when l get back.

903
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:12,218
-Be careful.
-l'll be fine, don't worry.

904
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:14,694
Where will you go till it's dark?

905
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:19,598
The diner near the Corner Pocket,
l guess. Pick up my winnings later.

906
01:18:20,371 --> 01:18:22,430
l want to go with you.

907
01:18:23,207 --> 01:18:25,107
Bobby, come inside, please.

908
01:18:25,843 --> 01:18:27,538
Do as she says, kiddo.

909
01:19:14,325 --> 01:19:16,418
Yes, is this...

910
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,027
...Housitonic-5837?

911
01:19:20,431 --> 01:19:23,423
Yes, well, l have some information
for you...

912
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:26,102
...about Brautigan.

913
01:19:26,704 --> 01:19:30,162
You can find him at
the Corner Pocket tonight...

914
01:19:30,374 --> 01:19:31,807
...in Bridgeport.

915
01:19:32,843 --> 01:19:35,539
Yes. Now, there's a reward--?

916
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:36,871
Hello?

917
01:19:37,081 --> 01:19:38,139
Hello--

918
01:19:42,887 --> 01:19:44,650
Bastards.

919
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,982
When your mother writes ''bad''...

920
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:23,921
...under a mental picture of someone,
she writes it in ink.

921
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:30,360
l mean, l knew that, but
l didn't think she'd betray me.

922
01:20:35,806 --> 01:20:38,434
See, l need the money to survive...

923
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:42,343
...and l can't go back
to the Corner Pocket.

924
01:20:43,447 --> 01:20:46,109
And l need time to think...

925
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,882
...and there isn't any.

926
01:20:56,994 --> 01:20:58,655
Here's what you do.

927
01:20:59,797 --> 01:21:01,424
Write a note for me.

928
01:21:01,632 --> 01:21:02,724
A note?

929
01:21:03,534 --> 01:21:05,695
Yeah, to the Corner Pocket.

930
01:21:06,203 --> 01:21:08,171
l'll get you your money.

931
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:13,009
l'm not sure this is a good idea.

932
01:21:13,611 --> 01:21:15,272
Ted, take my hands.

933
01:21:16,847 --> 01:21:21,250
Don't worry. l won't let
the bogeyman get you.

934
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,487
Hello?

935
01:22:00,557 --> 01:22:02,422
Can I help you?

936
01:22:02,893 --> 01:22:06,852
lt's about Brautigan.
He took the train. l saw him go.

937
01:22:07,064 --> 01:22:09,498
Stay out of this, kid.

938
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,100
Brautigan's our business.

939
01:22:15,005 --> 01:22:16,870
Don't hurt him.

940
01:22:18,876 --> 01:22:22,039
Please don't hurt him.

941
01:22:22,413 --> 01:22:24,404
Go home, Bobby.

942
01:24:18,162 --> 01:24:20,096
Ted, l got the money!

943
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:34,368
Ted!

944
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:56,831
l wouldn't have missed a minute!

945
01:24:57,034 --> 01:24:58,501
Not a single minute!

946
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:02,571
Not for the whole world!

947
01:25:29,433 --> 01:25:32,129
Where have you been?
l've been worried!

948
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,566
l'm all safe and sound.

949
01:25:34,771 --> 01:25:38,537
Do you have any idea
what you just put me through?

950
01:25:38,742 --> 01:25:42,337
You only think about yourself!

951
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,107
-Bobby--
-Ted's gone.

952
01:25:45,315 --> 01:25:47,545
l'll never see him again.

953
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:51,378
So you got everything you wanted.
Happy?

954
01:25:51,588 --> 01:25:54,113
There's no money. l don't have a job.

955
01:25:54,324 --> 01:25:56,724
There's plenty of money now!

956
01:25:57,928 --> 01:26:01,125
See how great it worked out,
turning him in?

957
01:26:01,331 --> 01:26:03,697
l did it for you. For your own--

958
01:26:03,901 --> 01:26:07,393
You lie! You always lie.

959
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:13,066
My father was a good man
and people liked him.

960
01:26:14,678 --> 01:26:17,169
Everyone liked him except you.

961
01:26:17,748 --> 01:26:20,182
You never liked me either.

962
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:25,044
Then l find a grownup friend
of my own, and you know what?

963
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:27,254
l loved him.

964
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:33,158
You didn't just betray him;
you betrayed both of us.

965
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:44,965
Bobby?

966
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:58,020
Ted got it right.

967
01:26:58,221 --> 01:27:00,712
It isn't all Atlantis.

968
01:27:02,392 --> 01:27:05,520
My mother got a job outside of Boston.

969
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:09,254
And I was upset, of course,
but one thing....

970
01:27:09,466 --> 01:27:11,297
I wasn't afraid.

971
01:27:11,735 --> 01:27:14,260
I had Ted to thank for that.

972
01:27:15,472 --> 01:27:18,600
Hey, get out of here.
This is my place now.

973
01:27:18,809 --> 01:27:21,300
You can't. This is everybody's park.

974
01:27:21,511 --> 01:27:23,172
Yes, l can.

975
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,145
Little Bobby Garfield.

976
01:27:28,885 --> 01:27:31,979
Where's your fairy godfather
when you need him?

977
01:27:55,078 --> 01:27:57,603
That was for the Gerber baby!

978
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:53,135
Do you need any help?

979
01:28:53,336 --> 01:28:54,826
l'm fine.

980
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:19,586
Do you think you could ever
see your way to forgiving me?

981
01:29:24,167 --> 01:29:26,567
l'm working on it, Mom.

982
01:29:56,566 --> 01:29:59,558
Carol, we're leaving now.

983
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:01,760
Oh, no.

984
01:30:03,406 --> 01:30:06,170
Here. lt's where l'll be
in Massachusetts.

985
01:30:06,376 --> 01:30:09,436
-Will you write to me?
-Of course.

986
01:30:09,646 --> 01:30:11,170
l'll write to you.

987
01:30:12,382 --> 01:30:14,748
l'll probably be homesick.

988
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:17,883
l'll never forget you.

989
01:30:24,327 --> 01:30:26,955
Was it you who beat up Harry Doolin?

990
01:30:29,099 --> 01:30:30,259
Good.

991
01:30:31,368 --> 01:30:32,392
Good.

992
01:30:43,413 --> 01:30:45,608
-Carol, wait.
-l can't. Not now.

993
01:30:48,018 --> 01:30:50,782
-But l--
-l love you too, Bobby Garfield.

994
01:30:52,756 --> 01:30:55,020
But l have to go make the salad.

995
01:31:05,235 --> 01:31:08,136
9:35, 25 minutes before 10
on WKMD...

996
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:11,739
...serving up the biggest hits
with the Platters.

997
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:21,810
So, what are we gonna do?

998
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:26,011
The best we can, Mom.
The best we can.

999
01:31:28,725 --> 01:31:31,250
Well, time and tide wait for no man.

1000
01:31:31,461 --> 01:31:34,521
Ben Jonson called time
""the old bald cheater.""

1001
01:31:34,731 --> 01:31:37,700
-Who was Ben Jonson?
-An English writer.

1002
01:31:37,901 --> 01:31:41,359
Foolish about money,
and given to flatulence.

1003
01:31:41,571 --> 01:31:43,266
Flatulence?

1004
01:31:44,908 --> 01:31:47,308
Bobby Garfield!

1005
01:32:17,641 --> 01:32:21,042
Hey!
l don't think you should be in there.

1006
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,572
lt's not safe.

1007
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:26,578
l used to live here when l was a kid.

1008
01:32:30,854 --> 01:32:34,585
-Have you lived here long?
-Only my whole life.

1009
01:32:35,992 --> 01:32:38,984
Oh, wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait.

1010
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:44,066
Was your mother...

1011
01:32:46,036 --> 01:32:48,095
...was she...?

1012
01:32:49,072 --> 01:32:52,235
Was she Carol, Carol Gerber?

1013
01:32:53,209 --> 01:32:57,703
-My mom's dead. She died years ago.
-l was sorry to hear that.

1014
01:33:00,917 --> 01:33:04,011
We never kept in touch
like we said we would.

1015
01:33:08,558 --> 01:33:10,856
My God.

1016
01:33:11,061 --> 01:33:13,689
You're the boy on the Ferris wheel?

1017
01:33:14,931 --> 01:33:20,426
-Mom told me about that.
-She promised she'd never tell anyone.

1018
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:24,740
She said you were beautiful.

1019
01:33:28,278 --> 01:33:29,905
One of us was.

1020
01:34:05,215 --> 01:34:08,184
You can keep that, if you want.

1021
01:34:11,421 --> 01:34:12,786
l'm Bobby.

1022
01:34:14,657 --> 01:34:17,888
-Molly.
-Molly.

1023
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,430
She had the heart of a lion.

1024
01:35:07,944 --> 01:35:11,505
I never heard from
Ted Brautigan again.

1025
01:35:11,714 --> 01:35:15,980
Not that I didn't think of him.
I always have...

1026
01:35:16,186 --> 01:35:17,813
...and always will.

1027
01:35:19,722 --> 01:35:25,024
Because that summer was the last of
my childhood.

1028
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:30,332
And though I never again saw
what people were thinking...

1029
01:35:30,533 --> 01:35:34,697
...there was an enduring gift
that he left me.

1030
01:35:35,738 --> 01:35:40,368
What Ted did was open my eyes...

1031
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:43,242
...and let the future in.

1032
01:35:45,682 --> 01:35:48,378
I wouldn't have missed a minute of it.

1033
01:35:49,819 --> 01:35:51,787
Not for all the world.
