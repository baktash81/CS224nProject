1
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,554
All right, let's
do this one last time.

2
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:23,757
My name is Peter Parker.

3
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:26,718
I was bitten
by a radioactive spider.

4
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:28,695
And for 10 years

5
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:31,273
I've been the one
and only.

6
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:33,076
Spider-Man.

7
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:34,850
I'm pretty sure
you know the rest.

8
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:37,953
With great power comes
great responsibility.

9
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:42,647
I saved a bunch of people,
fell in love, saved the city.

10
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:45,138
And then
I saved the city again.

11
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,282
And again and again

12
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:47,584
and again.

13
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,085
And I did, uh

14
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,171
I did this.

15
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:52,639
Get on up
Get yourself together

16
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:53,835
Drive that funky soul

17
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,796
We don't really talk
about this.

18
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,546
Look, I'm a comic book.
I'm a cereal.

19
00:01:58,632 --> 00:01:59,804
Did a Christmas album.

20
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,749
I have an excellent
theme song.

21
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:03,202
Spider-man
Spider-man

22
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:05,647
And a so-so Popsicle.

23
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:07,936
I mean, I've looked worse.

24
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:09,507
But after everything

25
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:13,397
I still love
being Spider-Man.

26
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:14,694
I mean, who wouldn't?

27
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:17,201
So no matter
how many hits I take

28
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:22,537
I always find a way
to come back.

29
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,890
Because the only thing standing
between this city and oblivion

30
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,444
is me.

31
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:31,179
There's only one Spider-Man.

32
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:33,694
And you're lookin' at him.

33
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,357
Ooh

34
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:40,570
Ooh, ooh, ooh

35
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:45,342
Needless to say

36
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:50,772
Nevertheless
Callin' it quits

37
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:52,415
Now, baby, I'm a wreck
Miles!

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,651
Miles, papá, time for school!

39
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:57,471
Miles!

40
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,342
Miles!

41
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,710
Miles!
Yeah! Yeah?

42
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:04,927
Are you finished
packing for school?

43
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:06,671
Yeah.

44
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:10,155
Just ironing my last shirt.

45
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:11,983
Speaks Spanish

46
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,577
You're a sunflower

47
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,265
Come on! You a grown man now.

48
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:17,538
Let's show these teachers that.
Miles!

49
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,694
Where's my laptop?
Speaks Spanish

50
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,116
If you want me to drive you,

51
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,522
we gotta go now.
No, Dad. No, no, no, I-I'll walk.

52
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:25,305
Personal chauffeur going once.
It's okay.

53
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,843
Speaks Spanish

54
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:29,257
Miles! Gotta go.
In a minute!

55
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,101
Gotta go.
In a minute!

56
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:32,420
Mom, I gotta go.

57
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:33,804
In a minute.

58
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,993
Speaks Spanish

59
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:40,315
See you Friday.
Okay, mummy.

60
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:41,666
Speaks Spanish

61
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:44,952
Wow! Look who's back.
Yo, what's going on, bro?

62
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:47,671
Hey, I'm just walking by.
How you doin'?

63
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:49,679
Speaks Spanish

64
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:52,022
Yo, Miles! You feel
that earthquake last night?

65
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:54,877
What you talkin' about?
I slept like a baby last night.

66
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:56,154
How's that new school?

67
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,718
So easy.
We miss you, Miles.

68
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,048
You miss me?
I still live here!

69
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:02,132
Wait, you miss me?

70
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:05,105
Man Singing in Spanish

71
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,200
Contra!

72
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:14,343
Oh, come on.

73
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:18,514
Seriously, Dad.
Walking would've been fine.

74
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,887
You can walk plenty
on Saturday

75
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:20,869
when you peel
those stickers off.

76
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:22,888
You saw that?
I don't know if that was me, dad.

77
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:25,061
And the two from yesterday
on Clinton.

78
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,653
Yeah, those were me.

79
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:30,874
So, oh, look at that.
Another new coffee shop.

80
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:32,561
You see the mass?
Totally. Yeah.

81
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,576
You see that. What's that one called?
Foam Party.

82
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:37,524
"Foam Party"? Come on.
Mmm.

83
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,918
And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that mass?

84
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:42,578
I see it.
Is that a coffee shop or a disco?

85
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:44,092
Dad, you're old, man.

86
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:45,088
There are multiple reports

87
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:47,290
of another mysterious
seismic event last night.

88
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:49,918
Sources close to Spider-Man say
he's looking into the problem.

89
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:53,126
Spider-Man. I mean,
this guy swings in once a day,

90
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:55,700
zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?

91
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:56,731
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

92
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:58,387
Meanwhile,
my guys are out there,

93
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:00,438
lives on the line, no masks.
Uh-huh.

94
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:02,416
You know, we show our faces
I know. Dad, dad.

95
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,744
Speed up. Speed up.
I know these kids.

96
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,869
You know, with great ability
comes great accountability.

97
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:07,220
That's not even
how the saying goes,

98
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:08,345
dad.
I do like his cereal, though.

99
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,524
I'll give him that.

100
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:11,880
Oh, my gosh.
Don't cops run red lights?

101
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:12,983
Oh, yeah, some do.

102
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,892
But not your dad.

103
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,156
My memories keep begging

104
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:20,224
For someone else

105
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:25,560
I know this feeling, yes
I know it very well

106
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:27,849
Why can't I go back
to Brooklyn Middle?

107
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
You've given it
two weeks.

108
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:30,803
We're not having
this conversation.

109
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:33,373
I just think that
this new school is elitist.

110
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,443
"Elitist"?
And I would prefer to be

111
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,537
at a normal school
among the people.

112
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,540
"The people"?
These are your people.

113
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:40,735
I'm only here 'cause
I won that stupid lottery.

114
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:43,688
No way. You passed the entry
test just like everybody else. Okay.

115
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:46,571
You have an opportunity here.
You wanna blow that? Huh?

116
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:47,946
You wanna end up
like your uncle?

117
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:50,001
What's wrong with Uncle Aaron?
He's a good guy.

118
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:52,516
We all make choices in life.

119
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,731
It doesn't feel
like I have

120
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:55,231
a choice right now.
You don't!

121
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,180
I love you, Miles.

122
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:12,876
Yeah, I know, Dad.
See you Friday.

123
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,782
You gotta say "I love you" back.
Dad, are you serious?

124
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:22,579
I wanna hear it. "I love you, Dad."
You wanna hear me say it?

125
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:24,392
You're dropping me off at a school.
"I love you, Dad."

126
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:26,282
Look at this place.
"Dad, I love you."

127
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,985
Dad, I love you.

128
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:32,468
That's a copy.

129
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:34,756
Tie your shoes, please.

130
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:38,800
"I love you, Dad."

131
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:42,555
Hey, good morning.
How you doin'?

132
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:45,055
Weekend was short, huh?
"That's a copy."

133
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,587
Oh, my gosh! This is Th
This is embarrassing.

134
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,243
We wore
the same jacket.

135
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:51,762
Hey. Your shoe's untied.
Yeah,

136
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:53,914
Yeah, I'm aware.
It's a choice.

137
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:56,884
Theory is that
All matter is composed

138
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,790
Of at least three

139
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,129
Fundamental particles

140
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,916
Who can solve this for XY?

141
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:05,799
And that is known
as a syllogism.

142
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:08,237
Read two chapters
of Great Expectations.

143
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:11,048
A take-home quiz
on volumetric pressure.

144
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:13,141
Five-page essay
with your conclusions stressed.

145
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:23,604
countless other possibilities.

146
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:26,430
There could be a universe
where I am wearing red.

147
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:28,274
Or wearing leather pants.

148
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,305
Mr. Morales. Movin' in the dark.
You're late again.

149
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:34,673
Einstein said
time was relative, right?

150
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:38,539
Maybe I'm not late.
Maybe you guys are early.

151
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:45,266
Sorry.
It was just so quiet.

152
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:47,540
Would you like
to keep standing there,

153
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,501
or do you wanna sit down?

154
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:54,344
Our universe is, in fact,
one of many parallel universes

155
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,407
happening
at the exact same time.

156
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,016
Thanks to everyone here at
the Fisk Family Foundation

157
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,122
I liked your joke.
Really?

158
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:04,516
I mean, it wasn't funny.
That's why I laughed.

159
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:06,884
But it was smart,
so I liked it.

160
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,818
I don't know. I don't think
I've seen you before. -

161
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:11,588
Every choice that we make

162
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:14,963
would create countless
other possibilities.

163
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:18,243
A what-if to infinity.

164
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:21,287
A zero?
A few more of those,

165
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:23,935
you'd probably have
to kick me outta here, huh?

166
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,506
Maybe I'm just not right
for this school.

167
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:29,193
If a person wearing a blindfold
picked the answers

168
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,068
on a true-or-false quiz
at random,

169
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:32,855
do you know
what score they would get?

170
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,756
50%?
That's right!

171
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:36,891
The only way to get
all the answers wrong

172
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:39,244
is to know
which answers are right.

173
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,829
You're trying to quit.

174
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:44,300
And I'm not gonna let you.

175
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,603
I'm
assigning you a personal essay.

176
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,458
Not about physics,
but about you,

177
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,197
and what kind of person
you want to be.

178
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:08,511
Unh. Unh
Unh. Unh

Ha, sicker than
Your average

181
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:14,169
Poppa twist cabbage
Off instinct

182
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:15,365
Don't think

183
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:20,223
My Detroit players, timbs for
My hooligans in Brooklyn

184
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,622
Dead right, if the head
Right, Biggie there e'rynight

185
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:28,239
Never lose, never choose to
Bruise crews who

186
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:29,886
Do something to us
Come on

187
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:32,731
Uncle Aaron!
Hey! Were you scared?

188
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,521
You want that?

189
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:40,564
What's up with school?

190
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,708
Going great!
Got tons of friends.

191
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:44,923
You can't tell me
it's all that bad there.

192
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:46,435
Smart girls

193
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,990
Place must be full of 'em.

194
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:51,508
No, there's no one.

195
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,287
Yo, I can't have no nephew of mine.
No one.

196
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:54,546
On the streets with no game.
Hey,

197
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:56,669
I got game.
There's a new girl.

198
00:09:56,755 --> 00:09:59,091
Actually, you know,
she's kinda into me.

199
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,865
You know how it is.

200
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,662
What's her name?

201
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:04,232
You know,

202
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:05,741
we layin' down the
groundwork right now.

203
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:08,591
You know about
the shoulder touch?

204
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:10,154
'Course I do.

205
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,296
But tell me anyway.

206
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:16,300
Tomorrow, find that girl.
You walk up to her and be like:

207
00:10:18,054 --> 00:10:20,038
"Hey."

208
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:21,405
You serious, Uncle Aaron?

209
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,408
I'm tellin' you, man,
it's science.

210
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:26,277
So walk up to her
and be like: "Hey."

211
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:29,379
No, no, no, no.
Like: "Hey."

212
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:30,639

213
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:33,283
No. "Hey."

214
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:34,573

215
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:38,521
You sure you my nephew, man?

216
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,216
Is that her?

217
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:43,534
I should probably go.
Still got a paper to do tonight.

218
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:47,130
Yo, you been holdin' out on me?
You throw these up yet?

219
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:50,134
Naw, man. You know
my dad. I can't.

220
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:52,336
Come on. I got a spot
you ain't gon' believe.

221
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:54,401
Naw, I can't.
I can't. Can't.

222
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:58,034
I'm gonna get
in so much trouble.

223
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,939
Hey, man. Tell him
your art teacher made you.

224
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,243
Hey! How'd you know
about this place?

225
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:06,472
Did an engineering
job down here.

226
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:11,262
One, two, three
Four, five

227
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,848
What's up?

228
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,862
Yeah, man,
I knew we were related.

229
00:11:27,357 --> 00:11:28,675
Whoa!

230
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,768
Brooklyn!

231
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,682
There's a lot of
history on these walls.

232
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:40,057
This is so fresh.

233
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,714
And now
you on your own, Miles.

234
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:53,120
Whoa, slow down a little.

235
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:55,276
That's better.

236
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:58,409
Who's the black sheep?
What's the black sheep?

237
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:00,901
Don't know who I am
When I'm coming so you sleep

238
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,372
See what you got now?
Makin' mistakes is part of it.

239
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,245
And you can't beat that

240
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:11,670
The real Miles
comin' outta hidin'.

241
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:13,770
You gotta hay?
It's for the hoes

242
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:16,614
Now you can cut that line
with another color.

243
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,866
You can get with this
Or you can get with that

244
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:21,270
You can get with this or
You can get with that

245
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:23,374
You can get with this
Or you can get with that

246
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,595
I think you'll get with this
For this is where it's at

247
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:28,466
Little help?

248
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:31,379
who was quite contrary
Talkin' 'bout Mary

249
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:33,216
Did you want drips?
'Cause if you do, that's cool,

250
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:34,880
but if you don't,
you gotta keep it moving.

251
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:36,543
That's intentional.

252
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,421
Wow.
Is it too crazy?

253
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:45,984
No, man.

254
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:49,002
Miles, I see exactly
what you're doing there.

255
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:50,753
Yeah.

256
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:53,365
You know, me and your dad used
to do this back in the day.

257
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:55,526
Stop lyin'.
It's true.

258
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:59,163
Then he took on the cop thing,
and I don't know

259
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:01,635
He's a good guy, just

260
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:03,650
You know
what I'm sayin'.

261
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,906
All right, come on, man.
I gotta roll.

262
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:38,789
Miles, let's go.

263
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,936
That's weird.

264
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:11,921
My pants shrank.

265
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:13,803
I think I hit puberty.

266
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:23,447
I gotta get new pants.

267
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:26,350
Wait. Why is the voice
in my head so loud?

268
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,663
What?

269
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:30,780
Oh! Are you okay?
What?

270
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:32,991
Why am I so sweaty?

271
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:34,635
Why are you so sweaty?

272
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:36,717
It's a puberty thing.

273
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:40,147
I don't know why I said that.
I'm not going through puberty.

274
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:43,405
I did,
but I'm done.

275
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:45,663
I'm a man.

276
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:49,466
So you're, like, new
here, right? We got that in common.

277
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:51,311
Yeah. That's one thing.

278
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:53,725
Cool. Yeah.
I'm Miles.

279
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:56,757
I'm Gwe anda.

280
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:58,527
Wait, your name is Gwanda?

281
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,030
Yes, it's African.
I'm South African.

282
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:05,428
No accent though
'cause I was raised here.

283
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:08,686
Do the shoulder
touch now before she walks away.

284
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:14,224
Why is this so scary?

285
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,905
Am I doing this in slow motion
or does it just feel that way?

286
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:22,716
I'm kidding. It's Wanda.
No "G." That's crazy. Heh.

287
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:26,216
Hey.

288
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:28,912
Okay, then.
Uh

289
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,310
I'll see you around.

290
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,552
Oh. See you.

291
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:35,341
Sorry. Um
Hey.

292
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:39,221
Oh, crap.
Can you let go, please?

293
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:42,287
I can't let go.
Ow! Ow! Calm down. It's fine. Just

294
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:46,197
Miles, let go.
Workin' on it.

295
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,932
It's just puberty.

296
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:51,651
I don't think you know
what puberty is. Just relax.

297
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:52,793
Okay, I have a plan.
Great.

298
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:56,339
I'm gonna pull really hard.
That's a terrible plan.

299
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:57,598
One.
Don't do this.

300
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:58,775
Two.
Three!

301
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:07,197
Nice to meet you?

302
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,382
Sure. Total pleasure.

303
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:18,349
No one saw. It's okay.

304
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:21,552
No one knows, no one knows.

305
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:25,642
Everyone knows.

306
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:29,365
Everyone knows.
They're talkin' 'bout me.

307
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,146
They saw everything!
He knows. She knows. They know.

308
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,644
Wow, she's super tall.

309
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:35,560
Why is he smiling?
Am I the weird guy now?

310
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:36,786
What am I doing?

311
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:37,914
That guy's
such a weirdo.

312
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:39,656
How do I stop?

313
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:41,271
Can they hear my thoughts?!

314
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:44,075
Why are all my thoughts
so loud?!

315
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:46,922
Hey! I know you snuck out
last night, Morales.

316
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:48,333
Play dumb!

317
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,717
Who's Morales?

318
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:51,474
Not that dumb!

319
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:53,296
Hey!

320
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,905
Okay, okay. You're okay.

321
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,506
You're okay.

322
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,375
He'll never find you.

323
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,711
No.

324
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:13,409
Ow!

325
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:15,904
What are you doing
in my office, Morales?!

326
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:18,689
Morales! Open up!

327
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:20,423
Oh, Spider-bells
Goblin smells

328
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:22,727
Why is this happening?

329
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:24,326
Spider-buggy bleiw a tire

330
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,404
He's got
a nice voice.

331
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:28,215
Spidey-bells, Spidey-bells

332
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:29,747

Stop sticking!

334
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:37,741
Keep sticking, Miles! Oh!

335
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:49,359
Hofstadter
is suggesting

336
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:52,210
is that we

337
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,424
look on the

338
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:01,578
Okay.

339
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:07,424
My room!

340
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,911
"Why is this happening?"

341
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:17,455
"Please stop sticking."

342
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,502
"Please keep st"

343
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:21,818
Wait, wait, wait.

344
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,323
How could there be
two Spider-Men?

345
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:25,312
There can't be two Spider-Men.

346
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,252
Can there?

347
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,565
Come on, Uncle
Aaron, pick up. Pick up!

348
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:35,432
Yo, it's Aaron.

349
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:36,994
I'm outta town for a few days.

350
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,494
I'll hit you when I'm back. Peace.
No. No-No-No-No-No.

351
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:41,073
It's not possible!

352
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:43,468
It's It's just puberty.

353
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,366
It's a normal spider
and I'm a normal kid!

354
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:50,934
All right!

355
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:56,869
I gotta tell someone.

356
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:24,439
Okay, you're being crazy, Miles.
You're being crazy.

357
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:29,052
Find the spider.

358
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:30,635
You'll see.

359
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,871
It's a normal spider.

360
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:52,076
It's, like, boring
how normal this spider is.

361
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:02,819
I'm right here.

362
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:05,564
Why is this happening to me?

363
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:14,213
Slow down! What am I doing?

364
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:20,919
Way over there.

365
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:22,134
You're like me.

366
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:23,430
Miles. Look out.

367
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:24,969
I don't wanna be a hero.

368
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:26,540
Miles.

369
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:29,783
Whoa!

370
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,299
Norman, listen to me.

371
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,192
Spider-Man?

372
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:40,371
I cannot let you open a portal
to another dimension.

373
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:42,923
Brooklyn is not zoned
for that.

374
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:45,877
It's not up to me.

375
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:47,306
Is that Green Goblin?!

376
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:48,728
Why won't you quit?!

377
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,845
I guess I like Brooklyn not
being sucked into a black hole.

378
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,439
I think I'm gonna go.

379
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,963
Staten Island, maybe.
Not Brooklyn.

380
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,729
No! No!

381
00:21:24,171 --> 00:21:26,562
Whoa!

382
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:29,080
Oh! What now?

383
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:31,416
What is this place?

384
00:21:57,752 --> 00:21:59,641
Did you know your shoes
are untied?

385
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,913
Uh-huh.
This is a onesie,

386
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,669
so I don't really
have to worry about it.

387
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,884
I thought I was the only one.
You're like me.

388
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:15,555
I don't wanna be.

389
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't think
you have a choice, kiddo.

390
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:21,078
Got a lot going through
your head, I'm sure.

391
00:22:21,164 --> 00:22:22,344
Yeah.

392
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,627
You're gonna be fine.
I can help you.

393
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:26,997
If you stick around,
I can show you the ropes.

394
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:29,156
Yeah.

395
00:22:29,242 --> 00:22:32,851
I just need to destroy
this big machine real quick

396
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:34,524
before the space-time
continuum collapses.

397
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:35,828
Don't move.

398
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:40,367
See you in a bit.

399
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:52,978
How does he do that?

400
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,228
Is it here?
No, no, it's here.

401
00:22:58,313 --> 00:23:00,663
All right, folks.

402
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:01,883
I always get this wrong.

403
00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:04,352
Oh, boy.

404
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,639
Prowler.

405
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,159
Man, I was in
the middle of something.

406
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,810
I am so tired.

407
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:21,896
Are you mad at me?
I feel like you're mad at me.

408
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:30,621
That all you got?

409
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:34,963
Aw, so gross.

410
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:37,660
I should go
up there and help him.

411
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:40,529
Who am I kidding?
I should not do that.

412
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:49,022
Watch out.
Here comes the Spider-Man.

413
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:51,995
You like my new toy?

414
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:56,576
Cost me a fortune, but, hey,
can't take it with you, right?

415
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,851
You came all this way.
Watch the test.

416
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:01,530
It's a hell of a freaking
light show.

417
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:02,897
You're gonna love this.

418
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:08,288
No! No,
don't do this! Stop!

419
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:12,015
You don't know what it can do!
You'll kill us all!

420
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:29,968
I see multiple
dimensions opening!

421
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:35,374
That was three, four
and five separate dimensions.

422
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,811
It's unstable! We should stop.

423
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:52,741
Norm, what's your take
on head trauma?

424
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,995
I tried to warn you, pal.

425
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:14,042
Goblin, no!
Get him outta there!

426
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,183
Wilson! Where are we?

427
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:25,631
Really weird.

428
00:25:25,864 --> 00:25:27,542
Wilson!

429
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,886
Hey! Are you okay?

430
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:05,573
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm just resting.

431
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:08,315
Can't you get up?
Yeah.

432
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:10,714
Yeah, I always get up.

433
00:26:12,965 --> 00:26:14,597
The coughing's
probably not a good sign.

434
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:16,632
Find him. Now.

435
00:26:16,803 --> 00:26:19,925
Listen, we gotta team up here.
We don't have that much time.

436
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,795
This override key is the only
way to stop the collider.

437
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,292
Swing up there, use this key,
push the button and blow it up.

438
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,854
You need to hide your face.

439
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,972
You don't tell anyone
who you are.

440
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:33,286
No one can know.
He's got everyone in his pocket.

441
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:35,294
If he turns
the machine on again,

442
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,102
everything you know
will disappear.

443
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:39,037
Your family, everyone.

444
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:40,630
Everyone.

445
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:43,912
Promise me
you'll do this.

446
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:49,700
I promise.

447
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:52,565
Go. Destroy the collider.

448
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:54,011
I'll come and find you.

449
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:57,500
It's gonna be okay.

450
00:27:05,528 --> 00:27:06,553
Tombstone.

451
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:08,042
We're done with tests.

452
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,972
Get that thing ready
to go again. And soon.

453
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:14,659
Run faster!

454
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:16,722
These guys are weak.

455
00:27:16,883 --> 00:27:19,727
I'd say it's nice
to see you again, Spider-Man,

456
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:20,711
but it's not.

457
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:22,539
Hey, Kingpin.
How's business?

458
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:23,949
Boomin'. Heh.

459
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:27,286
Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.

460
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:30,370
This might open a
black hole under Brooklyn.

461
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:32,324
It can't be worth the risk.

462
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:35,604
It's not always
about the money, Spider-Man.

463
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:43,042
Don't you wanna know
what I saw in there?

464
00:27:43,248 --> 00:27:44,534
Wait.

465
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:47,604
I know
what you're trying to do,

466
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:50,279
and it won't work.

467
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:51,930
They're gone.

468
00:28:05,578 --> 00:28:06,791
Get rid of the body.

469
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,901
What was that?

470
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,682
Kill that guy.

471
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:50,469
Stop sticking!

472
00:29:08,772 --> 00:29:12,006
Stand clear
of the closing doors, please.

473
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:39,038
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

474
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:50,324
Police! Put your hands up!

475
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,492
Miles? Miles?

476
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:54,433
Why aren't you
at school?

477
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,771
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's okay.

478
00:29:58,178 --> 00:30:00,362
Miles?
¿Qué te pasa?

479
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:04,714
Is it the earthquake?

480
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:07,736
Can I sleep here tonight?

481
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:09,403
Miles.
It's a weeknight.

482
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:10,719
You made a commitment
to that school.

483
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:12,585
Jeff,
he's upset.

484
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:17,007
Of course you can stay.

485
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,421
Dad?
Yeah.

486
00:30:21,501 --> 00:30:24,710
Do you really hate
Spider-Man?

487
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:29,210
Yeah. I mean, with
a vigilante, there is

488
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:30,424
Jeff, mi amor.

489
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,265
What? He asked me.

490
00:30:32,353 --> 00:30:34,858
Baby, you know how I feel
about Spider-Man. Come on.

491
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:39,163
Tú sabes que
él te quiere mucho.

492
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:41,687
That's why he's tough on you.
You know that, right?

493
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:46,335
Mom, do you ever think
about moving out of Brooklyn?

494
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:49,382
Our family doesn't run
from things, Miles.

495
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,101
Yeah, I know.

496
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:56,651
What's that about?

497
00:30:56,736 --> 00:30:58,420
He's having a hard time, Jeff.

498
00:30:58,505 --> 00:30:59,671
When it gets hard,

499
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,473
that's when
he's gotta stick it out.

500
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:11,023
We interrupt this
broadcast for a special report.

501
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,140
Sad news tonight.

502
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:16,671
The hero known as Spider-Man
has died

503
00:31:16,827 --> 00:31:19,593
after injuries related to
another powerful earthquake

504
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,179
in Brooklyn.
Multiple sources are confirming

505
00:31:22,265 --> 00:31:24,601
that Peter Parker,
a 26-year-old grad student

506
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:26,296
and part-time photographer

507
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:29,874
operated as Spider-Man
for at least a decade.

508
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:33,522
I'm not runnin'
Runnin', runnin'

509
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:36,530
No, I'm not afraid
Of the fall

510
00:31:36,632 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm not scared

511
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:42,596
He is survived
by his wife, Mary Jane,

512
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:44,765
and his aunt, May Parker.

513
00:31:45,651 --> 00:31:48,369
Our hero, Spider-Man, is gone.

514
00:31:48,454 --> 00:31:49,804
I'm not scared

515
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:51,788
My husband, Peter Parker,

516
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:54,640
was an ordinary person.

517
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,343
He always said it could've been
anyone behind the mask.

518
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,554
He was just the kid
who happened to get bit.

519
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,983
I'm going to miss him.

520
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:06,352
Yeah.

521
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:08,265
We were friends,
you know.

522
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:10,324
Can I return it
if it doesn't fit?

523
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:12,062
It always fits

524
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:14,655
eventually.

525
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,983
He didn't ask for his powers,

526
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:28,216
but he chose to be Spider-Man.

527
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:32,029
My favorite thing about Peter

528
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:35,544
is that he made us each
feel powerful.

529
00:32:35,802 --> 00:32:39,720
We all have powers
of one kind or another.

530
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,115
Of the dark

531
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:43,982
But in our own way.

532
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:46,450
We are all Spider-Man.

533
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:48,997
And we're all
counting on you.

534
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:51,798
They're counting on me.

535
00:32:51,943 --> 00:32:55,841
Probably not you specifically.
I think it's a metaphor.

536
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:48,643
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

537
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:52,377
That thing you gave me,
that key.

538
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:55,752
I think I really messed it up.

539
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:59,471
I wanna do what you asked.

540
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:01,496
I really do.

541
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:04,448
But
I'm sorry.

542
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:07,330
I'm not sure
I'm the guy.

543
00:35:07,918 --> 00:35:10,770
I can't do this
without you.

544
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:12,340
Hey, kid.

545
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,713
Whoa!

546
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:20,836
What did I do to him?!

547
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:32,971
No.

548
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:38,826
Who are you?

549
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,910
All right, people,
let's do this one last time.

550
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:48,660
My name is Peter B. Parker.

551
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:51,856
I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.

552
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,762
And for the last 22 years,

553
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:57,723
I thought I was
the one and only Spider-Man.

554
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:00,554
What a day.

555
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:02,824
I'm pretty sure
you know the rest.

556
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,637
You see, I saved the city,
fell in love, I got married,

557
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:07,746
saved the city some more,
maybe too much.

558
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,824
My marriage got testy,
made some dicey money choices.

559
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,035
Don't invest
in a spider-themed restaurant.

560
00:36:13,168 --> 00:36:16,160
Then like 15 years passed.
Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.

561
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:18,606
I broke my back,
a drone flew into my face,

562
00:36:18,691 --> 00:36:19,673
I buried Aunt May.

563
00:36:19,758 --> 00:36:21,775
My wife and I split up.

564
00:36:21,964 --> 00:36:24,167
But I handled it
like a champion.

565
00:36:24,324 --> 00:36:25,880
'Cause, you know what,

566
00:36:25,965 --> 00:36:27,715
no matter
how many times I get hit,

567
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,617
I always get back up.

568
00:36:34,107 --> 00:36:37,317
And I got a lot of time
to reflect and work on myself.

569
00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:40,942
Did you know that seahorses,
that they mate for life?

570
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,896
Could you imagine?

571
00:36:42,982 --> 00:36:46,223
A seahorse seeing
another seahorse

572
00:36:46,317 --> 00:36:47,968
and then making it work?

573
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:51,153
She wanted kids and

574
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:53,309
And it scared me.

575
00:36:55,192 --> 00:36:57,317
I'm pretty sure
I broke her heart.

576
00:36:57,725 --> 00:37:00,225
Flash forward: I'm in
my apartment doing push-ups,

577
00:37:00,311 --> 00:37:02,225
doing ab crunches,
getting strong,

578
00:37:02,357 --> 00:37:04,694
when this weird thing
happened.

579
00:37:04,803 --> 00:37:07,631
And I gotta say, weird things
happen to me a lot.

580
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:11,186
But this was real weird.

581
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:54,651
Ow!

582
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,956
You see, I was in New York,
but things were different.

583
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:01,628
Also, I was dead.

584
00:38:02,027 --> 00:38:03,534
And blond.

585
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:05,499
I was kind of perfect.

586
00:38:05,968 --> 00:38:09,085
It was like
looking in a mirror.

587
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:11,734
I have a feeling that
the thing

588
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,343
that brought me here

589
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:15,546
was the thing
that got him killed.

590
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:18,059
You wanna know
what happened next?

591
00:38:22,312 --> 00:38:23,588
Me, too.

592
00:38:23,682 --> 00:38:24,913
Who are you?

593
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:26,718
What are
you doin' over there?

594
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:28,913
Freeze! P.D.N.Y.

595
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:30,305
Stop!

596
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,610
Are you kidding me right now?

597
00:38:36,695 --> 00:38:38,079
Stop! Stop!

598
00:38:38,164 --> 00:38:39,780
I gotcha. I gotcha.

599
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:41,668
Hey, kid. Drop the body.

600
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:46,720
Hey, kid. Get over here!
Come on, now!

601
00:38:46,805 --> 00:38:47,805
Whoa.

602
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,825
See you, officers!

603
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,178
Aw, come on.

604
00:38:58,851 --> 00:39:01,202
Hey, kid.
Kid, come on, now!

605
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:02,989
Put 'em up, son!

606
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:08,463
Uh adiós?

607
00:39:12,331 --> 00:39:15,174
Help!
Somebody stop that train!

608
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:34,302
Oh, hey. What the?

609
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:39,402
Sorry.

610
00:39:41,938 --> 00:39:45,543
I'm gonna die!

611
00:39:49,394 --> 00:39:51,872
Looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man

612
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,277
dragging a homeless corpse
behind a train.

613
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,965
Yes! I didn't kill you.

614
00:39:58,051 --> 00:39:59,574
Who are you?
Who are you?

615
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:00,824
Why are you trying to kill me?
I'm not.

616
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:02,754
I'm trying to save you.

617
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,217
Hey, maybe you
guys can go around?

618
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:27,770
All right. Thanks, New York.

619
00:40:38,027 --> 00:40:39,879
What was that?

620
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:42,184
Kid electrocuted me

621
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:43,894
with his hands.

622
00:40:47,457 --> 00:40:49,943
You're like me.
I got some questions.

623
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:56,281
Why do you look like
Peter Parker?

624
00:40:58,996 --> 00:41:00,287
Because I am Peter Parker.

625
00:41:00,372 --> 00:41:03,043
Then why aren't you dead?
And why is your hair different?

626
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:05,457
Why are you older?
And why is your body

627
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:06,785
a-a different shape?

628
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:08,160
Pretty sure
you just called me fat.

629
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:09,504
No. No, you just

630
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,052
Atleast, you don't look
so hot either, kid.

631
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:13,035
Most superheroes don't wear
their own merch.

632
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:14,363
Are you a ghost?
No.

633
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:15,528
Are you a zombie?
Stop it.

634
00:41:15,613 --> 00:41:16,966
Am I a zombie?
You're not even close.

635
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:19,496
Are you from another dimension?
Like a parallel universe

636
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:21,177
where things are like
this universe but different?

637
00:41:21,262 --> 00:41:23,199
And you're Spider-Man
in that universe?

638
00:41:23,285 --> 00:41:24,996
But somehow traveled
to this universe,

639
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,205
but you don't know how?

640
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:27,980
Wow. That was really
just a guess?

641
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:29,777
We learned about it
in physics.

642
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,821
Quantum theory.
This is amazing!

643
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,074
You can teach me
like Peter said he would.

644
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,434
Before he died. Yeah, right.
Yeah. Exactly.

645
00:41:36,637 --> 00:41:37,965
Look, I made a promise
to him.

646
00:41:38,051 --> 00:41:39,667
Here's lesson number one,
kid.

647
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,895
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

648
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,456
Peter, seriously

649
00:41:51,323 --> 00:41:53,407
Trust me, kid.

650
00:41:53,492 --> 00:41:55,600
This'll all make you
a better Spider-Man.

651
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:02,819
Hey, are you okay?

652
00:42:02,905 --> 00:42:04,006
No, I'm not.

653
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:05,412
What's going on
with your body?

654
00:42:05,498 --> 00:42:06,843
I don't think my atoms
are real jazzed

655
00:42:06,928 --> 00:42:08,613
about being
in the wrong dimension.

656
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:13,093
Look, I'm not looking
for a side gig

657
00:42:13,178 --> 00:42:14,494
as a Spider-Man coach.

658
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,796
I got a lot going on
in my dimension.

659
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:18,898
"With great power
comes great"

660
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:20,501
Don't you dare
finish that sentence.

661
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:22,269
Don't do it!
I'm sick of it.

662
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:29,043
Want my advice?
Go back to being a regular kid.

663
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:30,260
I don't have a choice!

664
00:42:30,354 --> 00:42:31,783
Kingpin's got
a supercollider.

665
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:33,206
He's trying to kill me.
Wait a second.

666
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,378
What did you just say?
Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.

667
00:42:35,463 --> 00:42:37,510
Who cares about that.
Where's the collider?

668
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,253
Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.

669
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:40,458
Goodbye.
Where you going?

670
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:41,799
When it runs again,
I'll jump in

671
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:43,523
and get back to my life.
You can't let them run it.

672
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:44,744
I'm supposed to destroy it

673
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,065
so it never runs again
or everyone's gonna die.

674
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:50,947
"Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.

675
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:53,479
But there's always a little bit
of time before everybody dies

676
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,088
and that's when I do
my best work.

677
00:42:55,174 --> 00:42:56,697
Aren't you gonna
need this?

678
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,447
Aw, you have a goober.
Give it.

679
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:02,072
W-W-Wait, no. Not so fast.
He called it an override key.

680
00:43:02,158 --> 00:43:04,811
There's always a bypass key,
a virus key, a who-cares key.

681
00:43:04,896 --> 00:43:07,214
I can never remember,
so I always call it a goober. Give it.

682
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:08,950
I need it
to destroy the collider.

683
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,359
I need it to go home.

684
00:43:10,445 --> 00:43:12,174
No. I'll swallow it.
Don't play with me.

685
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,158
What? Hey?
I said

686
00:43:14,244 --> 00:43:16,361
The collider created a portal
that brought me here.

687
00:43:16,447 --> 00:43:17,996
And I have to get

688
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:22,329
Did you break this?
No, it broke.

689
00:43:22,557 --> 00:43:23,791
I don't remember
what happened.

690
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,494
See, this is why
I never had kids.

691
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,066
Can't we make another one?

692
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:29,236
We can't do anything.
Thanks to you,

693
00:43:29,346 --> 00:43:32,072
I have to re-steal what
your guy stole from Alchemax

694
00:43:32,157 --> 00:43:34,941
and make another one of these.

695
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,976
If I don't turn off the collider
after you leave,

696
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:38,315
everyone in this city,

697
00:43:38,401 --> 00:43:41,510
my parents, my uncle and
millions of others, will die.

698
00:43:41,596 --> 00:43:43,017
And you're just gonna
go home

699
00:43:43,102 --> 00:43:45,318
and leave me here
to figure this out for myself?

700
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:48,072
You good with that, Spider-Man?
Yeah.

701
00:43:58,117 --> 00:43:59,979
What are you doing?

702
00:44:00,157 --> 00:44:03,902
Making you feel guilty.
Is it working?

703
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:06,173
How could it? No.
Look at me.

704
00:44:06,258 --> 00:44:07,768
Does it look like
it's working?

705
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:11,502
No. No, it's not

706
00:44:13,698 --> 00:44:18,204
No! No! No!
Do not let him win!

707
00:44:19,271 --> 00:44:20,619
All right, kid. You win.

708
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:22,963
Come on, we don't have
a second to lose.

709
00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:25,799
Mmm. I love this burger.
So delicious.

710
00:44:25,885 --> 00:44:27,713
One of the best burgers
I've ever had.

711
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:30,182
In my universe, this place
closed six years ago.

712
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,393
Hmm. I don't know why.
I really don't.

713
00:44:32,479 --> 00:44:33,670
Mmm.

714
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:38,137
You have money, right?
I'm not very liquid right now.

715
00:44:38,222 --> 00:44:39,939
Can we focus?
Mm-hm. Sure.

716
00:44:40,025 --> 00:44:42,562
The other Peter
You gonna eat that?

717
00:44:43,752 --> 00:44:44,838
I'm listening.

718
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:46,565
The other Peter said
he was gonna be

719
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,236
showing me the ropes.
Wow.

720
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:50,822
You got any Spider-Man
tips you can tell me now?

721
00:44:50,908 --> 00:44:52,119
Yeah, I got plenty.

722
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:53,586
Disinfect the mask.

723
00:44:53,798 --> 00:44:55,854
You're gonna wanna use
baby powder in the suit,

724
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,058
heavy on the joints.

725
00:44:57,144 --> 00:44:59,307
You don't want
any chafing, right?

726
00:44:59,627 --> 00:45:01,729
Anything else?
Nope, that was everything.

727
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,736
I think you're gonna be
a bad teacher.

728
00:45:03,822 --> 00:45:06,057
Uh-uh-uh?
Look up where Alchemax is.

729
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:09,619
"A private technological campus
in Hudson Valley, New York."

730
00:45:09,744 --> 00:45:11,088
You can teach me

731
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:12,305
to swing on the way there.

732
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:17,533
I'm not swinging to
the Hudson Valley, Miles.

733
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:19,913
Not after a hearty
burger breakfast.

734
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,611
Keep your legs fresh.
You're gonna thank me later.

735
00:45:24,202 --> 00:45:26,424
I can see a new horizon

736
00:45:26,799 --> 00:45:28,354
Underneath the blazing sky

737
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,392
I'll be where the eagle's
Flying higher

738
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:33,900
And it's a no on the cape.
I think it's cool.

739
00:45:33,986 --> 00:45:35,518
Take that off.
It's disrespectful.

740
00:45:35,604 --> 00:45:37,658
Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.

741
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,366
So how do we
retrace Peter's steps?

742
00:45:40,432 --> 00:45:41,854
That's a good question.

743
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:45,038
What would I do
if I were me?

744
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:47,577
Got it.

745
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:49,342
I infiltrate the lab.

746
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:51,514
Find the head scientist's
computer.

747
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,429
That lady with the
bike is the head scientist.

748
00:45:53,514 --> 00:45:54,858
I saw her
in this documentary.

749
00:45:54,944 --> 00:45:57,702
Cool! Step Three:
I reexamine my personal biases.

750
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,252
I hack the computer.

751
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:00,553
It's not technically
hacking.

752
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:02,733
Not now. I just lost
my train of thought.

753
00:46:02,835 --> 00:46:04,835
Download the important stuff.

754
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:06,360
I'll know it when I see it.

755
00:46:06,445 --> 00:46:09,381
I grab a bagel
from the cafeteria and run.

756
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:11,210
So, what am I doing?

757
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:14,210
You stay here.
You're lookout. Very important.

758
00:46:14,296 --> 00:46:16,737
Look, man. You gotta teach me
how to do Spider-Man stuff

759
00:46:16,822 --> 00:46:18,338
or I won't be able
to help.

760
00:46:19,665 --> 00:46:22,350
Watch and learn, kid!
I'll quiz ya later!

761
00:46:25,344 --> 00:46:26,837
Why did I get stuck with

762
00:46:26,923 --> 00:46:28,715
the janky, old, broke
hobo Spider-Man?!

763
00:46:30,335 --> 00:46:31,696
That's new.

764
00:46:41,447 --> 00:46:42,844
Kingpin.

765
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:48,135
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

766
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,655
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

767
00:46:58,697 --> 00:47:00,198
Whoa!

768
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:08,009
Peter!

769
00:47:08,273 --> 00:47:09,837
Peter!

770
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:11,571
Peter!

771
00:47:11,657 --> 00:47:13,494
What are you doing here?
Kingpin's here.

772
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:14,907
Just move over.

773
00:47:14,993 --> 00:47:17,704
You're steppin' on my foot.
Go back outside.

774
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,353
No! I can't sit there
and let Spider-Man die

775
00:47:20,439 --> 00:47:21,565
without doing anything
about it.

776
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,243
I'm not doing that again.

777
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:25,688
What?

778
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:29,095
Most people I meet
in the workplace try to kill me,

779
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:31,923
so you're
a nice change of pace.

780
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:35,064
Mr. Fisk!
Look at this data.

781
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,650
I know you can't
really understand it,

782
00:47:36,735 --> 00:47:38,704
but these are
really good numbers.

783
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:40,775
And I got the password.

784
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:43,673
Mr. Fisk.
If we fire again this week

785
00:47:43,759 --> 00:47:46,226
there could be a black hole
under Brooklyn.

786
00:47:46,376 --> 00:47:47,939
You see this? And this?

787
00:47:48,025 --> 00:47:49,396
This is multiple dimensions

788
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:52,173
beginning to crash
into each other.

789
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:53,800
This is pretty standard
Spider-Man stakes.

790
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:55,568
You get used to it.
Watch this.

791
00:47:55,653 --> 00:47:58,103
He's gonna say,
"You've got 24 hours."

792
00:47:58,189 --> 00:47:59,751
You've got 24 hours.

793
00:47:59,837 --> 00:48:01,809
What this means is there
could be a rupture

794
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:03,316
in the space-time
continuum.

795
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:04,545
Ooh. That's bad.

796
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,146
Actually, everything
she said was bad.

797
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:07,508
I was lying before.

798
00:48:15,773 --> 00:48:18,577
Okay. Hold on.
Let me get you some more data.

799
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,842
What are you doing, bud?
I can't move.

800
00:48:22,928 --> 00:48:24,663
Okay, relax your fingers.

801
00:48:24,749 --> 00:48:27,700
We don't have time.
Just let go. Be in the moment.

802
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:29,802
I am in the moment.
It's a terrible moment.

803
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:32,472
I'm not refusing.
No more excuses.

804
00:48:32,557 --> 00:48:34,141
I just need more time.

805
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:36,242
They're right there.
They're gonna see you.

806
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:38,177
Miles, you gotta unstick.

807
00:48:38,262 --> 00:48:40,113
What do you do to relax?

808
00:48:40,198 --> 00:48:42,966
Relax. Okay, okay, okay.

809
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,786
Needless to say, I

810
00:48:46,872 --> 00:48:48,387
Oh, for crying out loud.

811
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:51,157
Callin' it quits
Now, baby, I'm a wreck

812
00:48:52,744 --> 00:48:55,528
You're a wreck, ooh

813
00:48:57,883 --> 00:49:00,692
just the worst.

814
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:04,871
Miles, where did you go?
I'm right here.

815
00:49:04,956 --> 00:49:08,307
Where? I can't see ya.
I'm right in front of you.

816
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:10,843
Can Spider-Man turn invisible?
Not in my universe.

817
00:49:10,928 --> 00:49:12,836
Aah! You just poked me
in my eye!

818
00:49:12,922 --> 00:49:15,266
This is incredible.
Some kind of fight or flight thing.

819
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:16,618
What's that?

820
00:49:19,237 --> 00:49:20,611
Remember this password.
Come on.

821
00:49:20,697 --> 00:49:22,635
D-G-F-A-M-P-E-S-A-N-D
Slow down!

822
00:49:22,736 --> 00:49:27,213
4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.
I need to write it down!

823
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:28,424
Download the schematic.

824
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,338
How do I do that?
While I turn on the charm.

825
00:49:32,914 --> 00:49:34,333
Spider-Man?

826
00:49:34,419 --> 00:49:36,682
Oh, hey.
Didn't see you there.

827
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:38,135
Wow.

828
00:49:38,221 --> 00:49:40,604
Okay, I'm kinda
freaking out right now.

829
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,440
You're supposed to be dead.

830
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:45,519
Surprise! O-Okay.
That's-That's a no-no.

831
00:49:45,605 --> 00:49:47,332
We don't like that.
This is fascinating.

832
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:48,855
Okay, that's my face.

833
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:51,417
An entirely different
Peter Parker.

834
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:54,253
Little bit of a gut, perhaps
from dimensional warping.

835
00:49:54,338 --> 00:49:56,894
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah.
I was way flatter before I warped.

836
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,512
Travel through the multiverse

837
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:00,809
appears to have
deteriorated the

838
00:50:00,894 --> 00:50:02,814
What was the rest?!

839
00:50:04,285 --> 00:50:05,667
Hey, how old are you?

840
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:08,367
'Cause you don't look
a day over 35.

841
00:50:08,453 --> 00:50:10,341
They said I was crazy!
They said I was crazy!

842
00:50:10,426 --> 00:50:12,824
You showed
'em you're not crazy.

843
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:15,566
This might pinch a little.

844
00:50:17,324 --> 00:50:19,496
I know. I just need
to get these samples.

845
00:50:19,582 --> 00:50:20,455
Okay.

846
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:22,259
Organize your desktop, lady.

847
00:50:22,345 --> 00:50:25,824
Wow. Just complete
cellular decay.

848
00:50:26,674 --> 00:50:28,199
I've never seen
anything like this.

849
00:50:28,285 --> 00:50:29,598
What are you doing?

850
00:50:29,684 --> 00:50:31,824
I'm just taking the whole thing.

851
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:33,492
And obviously
you've been glitching.

852
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:36,746
"Glitchin'"? No.
Why would you even say that?

853
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,449
If you stay in this dimension
too long,

854
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,004
your body's gonna
disintegrate.

855
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,176
Do you know how painful
that would be, Peter Parker?

856
00:50:42,262 --> 00:50:45,082
I don't know.
You can't imagine.

857
00:50:45,243 --> 00:50:47,194
And I, for one,

858
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:49,301
can't wait to watch.

859
00:50:51,128 --> 00:50:52,558
What did you say
your name was?

860
00:50:52,644 --> 00:50:54,590
Dr. Olivia Octavius.

861
00:51:03,051 --> 00:51:05,025
Can I assume that your friends
call you Doc Ock?

862
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:07,238
My friends
actually call me Liv.

863
00:51:07,546 --> 00:51:10,176
My enemies
call me Doc Ock.

864
00:51:10,262 --> 00:51:11,597
I got this! Run!

865
00:51:11,683 --> 00:51:13,532
Who are you talking to?

866
00:51:15,486 --> 00:51:18,405
I got it!
Oh, you "got it," Peter?

867
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:22,317
I got it handled, buddy!

868
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,973
Everything is fine!

869
00:51:27,915 --> 00:51:30,949
Okay, this is a little bit bad.
You're chatty.

870
00:51:31,163 --> 00:51:32,605
Gotta go.

871
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:37,742
This is the moment
that I'm losin' the fight.

872
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,863
Let me tell you the good news.
We don't need the monitor.

873
00:51:42,948 --> 00:51:45,365
Peter!

874
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,744
You didn't tell me
you had an invisible friend!

875
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,970
Could you give me that back,
young man?

876
00:51:51,055 --> 00:51:52,972
Peter!

877
00:51:53,057 --> 00:51:55,494
It's proprietary.

878
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:01,727
Oh.

879
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:02,883
This'd be a good time

880
00:52:02,968 --> 00:52:04,550
to turn invisible.
Yep.

881
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,753
Okay, not gonna turn invisible.
Selecting a bagel.

882
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:09,456
Act super normal.

883
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:10,590
Spider-Man?

884
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:11,791
You know, that's funny,

885
00:52:11,876 --> 00:52:13,492
I get that a lot.
Hey.

886
00:52:13,577 --> 00:52:15,729
Spider-Man?
Hey! Hands up!

887
00:52:15,814 --> 00:52:17,094
Now we do
a switchy-switchy.

888
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,353
What?
Get back here!

889
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:19,633
Where do you think
you're going?

890
00:52:19,718 --> 00:52:21,668
He took a bagel!
Time to swing,

891
00:52:21,753 --> 00:52:23,922
just like I taught ya.
When did you teach me that?

892
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:26,086
I didn't. It's a little joke
for team-building.

893
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:27,944
Hey! Hey!
Hey!

894
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:30,306
All right, you ready?
Of course I'm not ready!

895
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,847
I can't do this yet!

896
00:52:33,932 --> 00:52:35,813
Everybody knows
that the best way to learn

897
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:38,321
is under intense
life-threatening pressure.

898
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,032
Oh! Come on, come on, come on.

899
00:52:46,945 --> 00:52:48,305
Uh-oh.

900
00:52:53,885 --> 00:52:55,961
What are you doing down there?

901
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,954
I run better than I swing.

902
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,807
You gotta swing
or they'll catch you.

903
00:53:01,008 --> 00:53:02,782
This is what you wanted.

904
00:53:08,756 --> 00:53:10,008
Uh-oh.

905
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:17,579
Come back, little boy.

906
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:20,180
Aim with your hips!
Look where you want it to hit.

907
00:53:20,266 --> 00:53:22,496
Square your shoulders.
Don't forget to follow through!

908
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:23,938
Don't shoot off
your back foot.

909
00:53:24,048 --> 00:53:26,899
That's too many things!
Then stop listening to me!

910
00:53:26,985 --> 00:53:30,250
That's the best idea
you've had all day!

911
00:53:36,894 --> 00:53:39,094
Nice, Miles!

912
00:53:42,632 --> 00:53:44,483
I'm doin' it.
Good. You're doin' it.

913
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:47,086
Double tap to release
and thwip it out again.

914
00:53:47,171 --> 00:53:48,954
Okay.
Thwip and release.

915
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:52,071
And thwip. Release. Thwip.
And release.

916
00:53:52,157 --> 00:53:53,959
You're a natural. Thwip. And release!
Thwip. Release.

917
00:53:54,044 --> 00:53:56,407
Feel the rhythm?
Thwip. And release!

918
00:53:56,493 --> 00:53:57,680
Good, Miles.

919
00:53:57,766 --> 00:54:00,102
I gotta say,
you're amazing, man.

920
00:54:00,188 --> 00:54:01,534
We're a little team!

921
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:03,602
Me as the teacher
who could still do it.

922
00:54:03,688 --> 00:54:06,539
You as the student who can
do it, just not as good.

923
00:54:06,735 --> 00:54:09,461
I'm proud of us. Is there
something you want to say to me?

924
00:54:11,423 --> 00:54:12,770
Peter!

925
00:54:25,293 --> 00:54:26,926
What the?
Who did that?

926
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:54,588
Hey, guys.

927
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:55,722
Gwanda?

928
00:54:55,807 --> 00:54:57,387
It's Gwen, actually.

929
00:54:57,473 --> 00:55:00,493
Oh, you know her.
Very cool.

930
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:02,152
I'm from another dimension.

931
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:05,231
I mean,
another-another dimension.

932
00:55:05,317 --> 00:55:08,449
All right, people. Let's start
at the beginning one last time.

933
00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:09,903
My name is Gwen Stacy.

934
00:55:09,988 --> 00:55:12,738
I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.

935
00:55:12,823 --> 00:55:14,270
And for the last two years,

936
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:17,541
I've been the one
and only Spider-Woman.

937
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,574
You guys know the rest.

938
00:55:19,846 --> 00:55:21,315
I joined a band.

939
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,395
Saved my dad.

940
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:30,324
I couldn't save my best friend,

941
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,699
Peter Parker,

942
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:35,809
so now I save everyone else.

943
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,598
And I don't do friends
anymore,

944
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:40,926
just to avoid
any distractions.

945
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,285
And one day
this weird thing happened.

946
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:49,327
And I mean, like,
really weird.

947
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:57,066
I was blown into last week.

948
00:56:01,106 --> 00:56:02,598
Literally.

949
00:56:02,975 --> 00:56:06,676
I landed in New York,
but not my New York.

950
00:56:08,184 --> 00:56:09,481
Lucky for these folks,

951
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:11,465
Spider-Man was there
to save the day.

952
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:14,918
My Spider-sense told me
to head to Visions Academy.

953
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:17,199
You guys are early.

954
00:56:17,285 --> 00:56:20,176
Wasn't sure why
until I met you.

955
00:56:20,262 --> 00:56:21,449
Oh!

956
00:56:22,126 --> 00:56:23,512
I like your haircut.

957
00:56:23,606 --> 00:56:25,211
You don't get to like
my haircut.

958
00:56:25,297 --> 00:56:26,504
Let's go.

959
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:27,922
How many more Spider-People
are there?

960
00:56:28,007 --> 00:56:29,207
Save it
for Comic-Con.

961
00:56:29,293 --> 00:56:31,239
What's Comic-Con?
Whoa!

962
00:56:48,153 --> 00:56:49,551
You're dead, Spider-Man.

963
00:56:49,644 --> 00:56:52,176
Wilson!
What are you doing?

964
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:54,918
Vanessa.
Richard, come on.

965
00:56:58,184 --> 00:56:59,968
Vanessa! Richard!

966
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:01,543
No!

967
00:57:01,648 --> 00:57:04,132
Don't look back, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.

968
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:24,950
I killed Spider-Man.

969
00:57:25,323 --> 00:57:27,559
Why did I just see two more?

970
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,691
There's three, actually.

971
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:32,488
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.

972
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:34,395
This means
you get what you want.

973
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:36,488
It means my collider works.

974
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:40,762
All we have to do is kill
a couple of Spiders.

975
00:57:40,987 --> 00:57:43,309
And the collider will bring
your family back.

976
00:57:43,582 --> 00:57:46,473
As many families
as you want.

977
00:57:55,168 --> 00:57:57,410
Tomorrow, at my collider.

978
00:57:58,038 --> 00:58:00,012
Our collider.

979
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:04,716
He broke this?

980
00:58:04,802 --> 00:58:07,059
Yeah. He's actually
really embarrassed about it,

981
00:58:07,145 --> 00:58:09,426
so just keep
it between us, okay?

982
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:12,686
I know where we
can make a new one.

983
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,503
And we won't let him
break it this time.

984
00:58:17,665 --> 00:58:19,590
I'm sorry about your friend.

985
00:58:20,878 --> 00:58:22,262
Thanks, Miles.

986
00:58:24,314 --> 00:58:26,032
I know
how hard this is.

987
00:58:26,117 --> 00:58:28,379
To have to figure
this stuff out on your own.

988
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:32,098
It's kinda nice not being
the only Spider-person around.

989
00:58:32,192 --> 00:58:33,235
Yeah.

990
00:58:34,825 --> 00:58:37,301
If you ever decide
to do friends again,

991
00:58:37,414 --> 00:58:39,395
I could always open up a slot.

992
00:58:40,065 --> 00:58:42,782
I'll keep you posted.

993
00:58:43,414 --> 00:58:44,981
Cool.

994
00:58:49,906 --> 00:58:51,622
We should probably go.

995
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:54,410
Peter, we're
literally on the doorstep.

996
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:55,676
Bad idea. Bad idea.

997
00:58:55,762 --> 00:58:57,302
Just relax.
This is a bad idea.

998
00:58:57,387 --> 00:58:59,104
You guys are all very sweet,

999
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:01,238
but no more fans today,
please.

1000
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:07,043
I'm not ready for this.

1001
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:12,879
Peter?

1002
00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:16,660
Hey, Aunt May.

1003
00:59:17,098 --> 00:59:18,871
So this is gonna
sound crazy,

1004
00:59:18,957 --> 00:59:21,199
but I'm pretty sure
that I'm from an

1005
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,512
An alternate dimension.

1006
00:59:23,598 --> 00:59:24,900
Yeah.

1007
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:28,145
You look tired, Peter.

1008
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:29,988
Well, I am tired.

1009
00:59:30,074 --> 00:59:33,566
And older. And thicker.
Yeah. I've heard that already.

1010
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:35,840
Oh, jeez.
Are those sweatpants?

1011
00:59:35,966 --> 00:59:38,316
Yup, that's what they are.

1012
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:40,098
I was there,

1013
00:59:40,613 --> 00:59:42,474
when it all happened.

1014
00:59:42,785 --> 00:59:44,551
I am so sorry.

1015
00:59:44,762 --> 00:59:46,629
And what dimension
are you from?

1016
00:59:46,811 --> 00:59:48,270
Brooklyn.

1017
00:59:48,967 --> 00:59:52,301
Did Peter have a place where we
could make another one of these?

1018
00:59:52,465 --> 00:59:54,027
A goober.

1019
00:59:55,289 --> 00:59:56,465
Follow me.

1020
01:00:00,027 --> 01:00:01,793
Oh, yeah,
I got one of these, too.

1021
01:00:01,912 --> 01:00:03,996
A little, old shed
where I keep my Spider-gear.

1022
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:18,731
I mean,
this place is pretentious.

1023
01:00:25,669 --> 01:00:27,438
Whoa.

1024
01:00:32,075 --> 01:00:33,856
Dude. Was yours
anything like this?

1025
01:00:33,942 --> 01:00:35,160
Mine was like this,

1026
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,122
but take away the jeep,
the plane.

1027
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:40,911
Imagine it way smaller.
Imagine a futon.

1028
01:00:41,049 --> 01:00:43,684
I feel sad for this guy.

1029
01:00:57,501 --> 01:00:58,934
Hey, Peter.

1030
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:01,856
I think this is a cape.

1031
01:01:17,688 --> 01:01:20,919
Peter knew
how dangerous the job was.

1032
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:24,458
But he figured the only one
who could stop this guy

1033
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:26,200
was Spider-Man.

1034
01:01:27,631 --> 01:01:29,514
Kingpin knows
we're coming.

1035
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,483
We're going to be
outnumbered.

1036
01:01:31,568 --> 01:01:33,645
Don't be
so sure.

1037
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:36,004
You might need these.

1038
01:01:40,485 --> 01:01:43,950
You think you're the only people
who thought to come here?

1039
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,322
Hey, fellas.

1040
01:01:47,517 --> 01:01:49,012
Is he
in black and white?

1041
01:01:49,098 --> 01:01:51,262
Where's that wind coming from?
We're in a basement.

1042
01:01:51,418 --> 01:01:53,489
Wherever I go,
the wind follows.

1043
01:01:53,574 --> 01:01:56,606
And the wind,
it smells like rain.

1044
01:01:57,128 --> 01:01:58,262
Hi, guys!

1045
01:01:58,349 --> 01:02:00,117
Speaking Japanese

1046
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:06,051
This could literally not
get any weirder.

1047
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,606
It can get weirder.

1048
01:02:08,848 --> 01:02:12,036
I just washed my hands.
That's why they're wet.

1049
01:02:12,489 --> 01:02:13,958
No other reason.

1050
01:02:21,713 --> 01:02:23,549
You're like me.

1051
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:27,709
My name is Peter Parker.

1052
01:02:27,795 --> 01:02:29,201
My name is Peni Parker.

1053
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,256
My name is Peter Porker.

1054
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,233
I was bitten by.
I was bitten by

1055
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,115
a radioactive spider.
A radioactive pig.

1056
01:02:34,532 --> 01:02:36,725
In my universe, it's 1933,

1057
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:38,037
and I'm a private eye.

1058
01:02:38,123 --> 01:02:39,475
I like to drink egg creams,

1059
01:02:39,561 --> 01:02:41,936
and I like to fight Nazis.
A lot.

1060
01:02:42,022 --> 01:02:44,071
I'm from New
York in the year 3145.

1061
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:45,787
I have a psychic link
with a spider

1062
01:02:45,873 --> 01:02:47,608
who lives inside
my father's robot.

1063
01:02:47,757 --> 01:02:50,061
And we're best friends.
Forever.

1064
01:02:50,147 --> 01:02:52,273
Sometimes I let
matches burn down to my fingertips

1065
01:02:52,358 --> 01:02:53,740
just to feel something,
anything.

1066
01:02:54,998 --> 01:02:56,889
I'm a photographer
for the Daily Beagle.

1067
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,154
When I'm not pooching around,
I'm working like a dog,

1068
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,889
trying to sniff out
the latest story.

1069
01:03:01,059 --> 01:03:02,874
I frolic and I dance
And I do this With my pants

1070
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:04,476
Okay! Enough!

1071
01:03:05,272 --> 01:03:08,014
So how did you
get here?

1072
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:10,334
Well, it's kind of
a long story.

1073
01:03:15,084 --> 01:03:16,272
Maybe not
that long.

1074
01:03:16,686 --> 01:03:19,365
And now we're just trying
to find a way home.

1075
01:03:21,287 --> 01:03:24,311
The only way home is back
through that collider gizmo.

1076
01:03:24,397 --> 01:03:25,404
The only trouble is

1077
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:28,643
One of us has to stay behind
and destroy it.

1078
01:03:28,912 --> 01:03:30,168
I'll do it. I'll do it.
I'll do it.

1079
01:03:30,253 --> 01:03:32,572
No, no, no.
You guys don't get it.

1080
01:03:32,657 --> 01:03:33,928
Don't get what?

1081
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:42,190
None of you can stay here.
If you stay here, you'll die.

1082
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:44,690
I'm the guy
who's gonna turn it off.

1083
01:03:44,831 --> 01:03:48,065
And I'm gonna get you all home
before I do.

1084
01:03:48,573 --> 01:03:52,651
Look, I made a promise.
So I have to keep it.

1085
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:58,465
Who are you
again?

1086
01:03:58,551 --> 01:03:59,868
This is Miles.

1087
01:03:59,954 --> 01:04:01,438
And he's gonna save
the multiverse.

1088
01:04:01,524 --> 01:04:03,790
Yeah, man.
This kid can turn himself invisible.

1089
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:05,922
Watch this.
He can do it now.

1090
01:04:08,758 --> 01:04:12,000
I can't do it on command.
He can't do it on command.

1091
01:04:12,086 --> 01:04:14,790
But it is cool. Show 'em
the zappy thing, Miles.

1092
01:04:16,402 --> 01:04:19,821
Can't do it on command.
He can't do it on command.

1093
01:04:19,907 --> 01:04:22,040
But he can do so much more.
What else do you do?

1094
01:04:22,126 --> 01:04:24,943
Just those two things.
Just those two things.

1095
01:04:25,175 --> 01:04:26,592
Aw, man.

1096
01:04:26,677 --> 01:04:31,283
Look, I've seen him in action.
He's got potential.

1097
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:34,188
I think he's gonna
get us home.

1098
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:37,915
Okay, little fella,

1099
01:04:38,001 --> 01:04:40,106
Kingpin's gonna send
a lot of mugs after ya.

1100
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,430
I'm talkin' hard boys,
real biscuit boxers.

1101
01:04:42,516 --> 01:04:43,961
Can you fight them
all off at once?

1102
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,141
I haven't actually
fought anyone.

1103
01:04:46,243 --> 01:04:47,680
Surprise attack!

1104
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:51,516
Can you rewire a mainframe
while being shot at?

1105
01:04:51,602 --> 01:04:52,584
Can I what?
Show me!

1106
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:54,420
Surprise attack!

1107
01:04:54,505 --> 01:04:56,255
Can you swing and flip with
the grace of a trained dancer?

1108
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,259
Can you close off your feelings
so you don't get crippled

1109
01:04:58,344 --> 01:05:00,181
by the moral ambiguity
of your violent actions?

1110
01:05:00,266 --> 01:05:02,361
Can you help your aunt create
an online dating profile

1111
01:05:02,446 --> 01:05:04,361
so she can get out of
the dang house once in a while?

1112
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,899
Can you float through the air
when you smell a delicious pie?

1113
01:05:06,985 --> 01:05:08,352
What?
Can you be strong?

1114
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,703
Ruthless?
Disciplined?

1115
01:05:09,789 --> 01:05:10,774
I don't know. Maybe.

1116
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,665
Psychic?
Show me some moxie, soldier!

1117
01:05:12,797 --> 01:05:15,407
Above all, no matter
how many times you get hit,

1118
01:05:15,492 --> 01:05:16,842
can you get back up?

1119
01:05:16,927 --> 01:05:18,811
'Cause when a Spider-Man
is on the floor

1120
01:05:18,896 --> 01:05:20,713
When you think
you can't keep goin'

1121
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:23,016
Come on, Miles.
Come on. You can do it.

1122
01:05:23,102 --> 01:05:24,969
You can do this.
Guys, cool it.

1123
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:27,753
Come on. You can do it!
Get up, Miles.

1124
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:29,874
Come on, Miles.
Get up.

1125
01:05:36,086 --> 01:05:38,430
You need to be more honest
with yourself about this.

1126
01:05:38,516 --> 01:05:39,969
He's not ready.
It's obvious.

1127
01:05:40,055 --> 01:05:41,501
There's no way.
He's just a kid.

1128
01:05:41,586 --> 01:05:42,702
If he can't do this,

1129
01:05:42,787 --> 01:05:44,141
we have to stay
and do it for him.

1130
01:05:44,227 --> 01:05:46,563
He's looking right at us
while we talk about him.

1131
01:05:47,505 --> 01:05:48,855
Miles?

1132
01:05:49,026 --> 01:05:50,103
Miles?

1133
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,118
You see that?
He can, um

1134
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:58,072
He can turn invisible.

1135
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:04,159
When it gets dark
Outside

1136
01:06:04,245 --> 01:06:07,269
In you I confide

1137
01:06:07,382 --> 01:06:11,266
You help me face my demons
I won't hide

1138
01:06:11,414 --> 01:06:13,432
Miles, what
is going on with you?

1139
01:06:13,518 --> 01:06:16,081
Nobody's heard from you.
We don't know what's going on.

1140
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:19,073
If you're hidin' something from
us, you need to come clean.

1141
01:06:19,256 --> 01:06:20,956
You call me back. Now.

1142
01:06:22,531 --> 01:06:24,777
He's not answering me
either.

1143
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:30,175
It's Aaron.
I'm outta town for a few days.

1144
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:31,956
I'll hit you when I'm back.
Peace.

1145
01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:33,573
Aaron, it's Jeff.

1146
01:06:34,438 --> 01:06:37,423
Look, I need you to call me
if you've heard from Miles.

1147
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:39,159
He has a

1148
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,511
He has a soft spot for you,

1149
01:06:43,101 --> 01:06:44,951
and we haven't heard
from him.

1150
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:48,230
And you know I wouldn't reach
out if this wasn't important.

1151
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:50,485
Hope you're good.

1152
01:06:52,389 --> 01:06:54,001
Dear Uncle Aaron.

1153
01:06:54,189 --> 01:06:58,430
I gotta do something, and
I don't know if I can do it.

1154
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:01,446
I'm scared, man.

1155
01:07:02,204 --> 01:07:06,376
I'm just tired of
lettin' everybody down.

1156
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,587
You're the only one
I can talk to.

1157
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:16,110
I just wish you were here.

1158
01:08:10,735 --> 01:08:12,149
Hello, Mr. Fisk.

1159
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:15,290
I've got the security tapes
from the tunnel right here.

1160
01:08:15,455 --> 01:08:18,558
If the kid's out there,
I'll find him.

1161
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,219
You know me, sir.
I don't ever quit.

1162
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,351
Personal insanity
They gotta like the ally

1163
01:09:58,437 --> 01:09:59,429
Turn it up
Against the rally

1164
01:09:59,515 --> 01:10:00,625
You're running in
While they're counting

1165
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,950
Even score, got the tally
Knock 'em off at the finale

1166
01:10:03,647 --> 01:10:05,784
Go, go!
They don't want it, yeah

1167
01:10:08,612 --> 01:10:10,482
They don't want it, yeah

1168
01:10:11,546 --> 01:10:13,052
This is

1169
01:10:13,544 --> 01:10:15,393
Purple.
No.

1170
01:10:15,487 --> 01:10:16,603
Blue?
No.

1171
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:18,309
Has anyone
heard from Miles?

1172
01:10:18,496 --> 01:10:20,780
Look, he's just clearing his head.
I know the kid.

1173
01:10:20,865 --> 01:10:22,395
He's got
what it takes.

1174
01:10:22,731 --> 01:10:25,239
I bet you he's gonna come back
through that door,

1175
01:10:25,325 --> 01:10:27,274
recharged
and ready to fight.

1176
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,865
My uncle.
Hey, where have you been?

1177
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,919
My uncle Aaron, he's
he's-he's the Prowler. He

1178
01:10:32,036 --> 01:10:33,576
Slow down, Miles. Slow down.
He works for Kingpin.

1179
01:10:33,661 --> 01:10:34,973
He tried to kill me!

1180
01:10:35,059 --> 01:10:37,084
This is a pretty
hard-core origin story.

1181
01:10:37,169 --> 01:10:39,075
It's okay. It's okay.
We're gonna figure it out.

1182
01:10:39,161 --> 01:10:42,591
Were you followed?
No, I don't think so.

1183
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:54,713
Cute place. Real homey.
Oh, great. It's Liv.

1184
01:10:54,798 --> 01:10:56,749
I guess
I was followed.

1185
01:10:56,834 --> 01:10:57,916
Oh, no.

1186
01:10:58,001 --> 01:10:59,317
Get out of here,
kid.

1187
01:10:59,872 --> 01:11:03,278
You messed up bigtime, kid.
Very sloppy.

1188
01:11:03,364 --> 01:11:05,381
Speaks Spanish

1189
01:11:06,005 --> 01:11:09,164
Let me guess. You're Scorpion.
Well, we're the Spider, uh, gang.

1190
01:11:09,312 --> 01:11:11,364
Would you mind
taking this outside?

1191
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:14,497
We don't pick the ballroom,
we just dance.

1192
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:16,692
Ooh, I think
I'll be taking that.

1193
01:11:20,736 --> 01:11:24,075
Stand, niñito, dale.
Prepárate a morir.

1194
01:11:25,044 --> 01:11:26,377
Man, stupid pillows.

1195
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:47,200
I said,
take it outside!

1196
01:11:47,496 --> 01:11:49,152
I got it!

1197
01:12:00,763 --> 01:12:03,934
I got this, buddy.
Leave the kid alone!

1198
01:12:06,903 --> 01:12:08,707
No, no, no! No!

1199
01:12:17,915 --> 01:12:19,769
You gotta go, man.

1200
01:12:29,058 --> 01:12:31,192
All vehicles in
the area, we have a disturbance

1201
01:12:31,277 --> 01:12:33,691
involving
multiple Spiderpeople?

1202
01:12:33,777 --> 01:12:35,035
Yeah. On my way.

1203
01:12:44,808 --> 01:12:46,157
Give me that thing.

1204
01:12:46,242 --> 01:12:49,580
Don't be stupid, kid.
Hand it over, now!

1205
01:13:07,532 --> 01:13:09,366
Nowhere left
to run.

1206
01:13:14,771 --> 01:13:16,460
Miles?

1207
01:13:16,901 --> 01:13:18,351
Uncle Aaron.

1208
01:13:20,309 --> 01:13:22,976
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1209
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:30,327
Please, Uncle Aaron.

1210
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:34,234
Prowler.

1211
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,210
What are you waitin' for?
Finish it.

1212
01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:06,124
Get out of here!

1213
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,943
No.

1214
01:14:28,828 --> 01:14:30,011
Miles.

1215
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:31,944
Uncle Aaron.

1216
01:14:33,099 --> 01:14:34,569
This is my fault.

1217
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:41,124
No, Miles.

1218
01:14:42,638 --> 01:14:44,139
I'm sorry.

1219
01:14:46,936 --> 01:14:49,124
I wanted you to look up to me.

1220
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:53,366
I let you down, man.
I let you down.

1221
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,624
You're the best
of all of us, Miles.

1222
01:15:00,481 --> 01:15:02,217
You're on your way.

1223
01:15:02,576 --> 01:15:06,686
Just
keep going.

1224
01:15:09,483 --> 01:15:11,269
Just keep going.

1225
01:15:45,121 --> 01:15:46,377
Hands up!

1226
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:48,768
Put your arms up. Now!

1227
01:15:49,567 --> 01:15:51,698
Turn around.

1228
01:15:54,063 --> 01:15:56,467
Hey! Hey!

1229
01:16:03,906 --> 01:16:07,510
Aaron. Aaron, no. No!

1230
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,401
All units.

1231
01:16:18,823 --> 01:16:21,673
I want an APB
on a new Spider-Man.

1232
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:53,119
Hey, bud.

1233
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,061
You okay?

1234
01:17:00,034 --> 01:17:03,119
We've all been there.
You know, for me,

1235
01:17:03,346 --> 01:17:05,080
it was my Uncle Ben.

1236
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:09,377
For me, it was
my Uncle Benjamin.

1237
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:12,124
For me,
it was my father.

1238
01:17:12,486 --> 01:17:14,635
For me, it was
my best friend.

1239
01:17:15,202 --> 01:17:19,049
Miles, the hardest thing
about this job is

1240
01:17:19,805 --> 01:17:22,353
you can't always
save everybody.

1241
01:17:23,017 --> 01:17:26,002
Look, it was my fault.
You wouldn't understand.

1242
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:29,525
Miles, we're probably the
only ones who do understand.

1243
01:17:32,028 --> 01:17:34,213
Oh, no.

1244
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:39,003
Who in here trying
To start a riot?

1245
01:17:40,017 --> 01:17:42,834
That way,
that way.

1246
01:17:43,005 --> 01:17:45,476
Other way, other way,
other way, other way.

1247
01:17:47,866 --> 01:17:49,282
Who that swinging
In the air?

1248
01:17:49,446 --> 01:17:50,595
Hey
there.

1249
01:17:50,695 --> 01:17:52,594
Do animals talk
in this dimension?

1250
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,368
'Cause I don't wanna
freak him out.

1251
01:17:55,009 --> 01:17:58,001
Let's stand up, stand up
You better just fix your

1252
01:18:01,692 --> 01:18:03,446
What's going on?

1253
01:18:03,693 --> 01:18:05,141
Bye,
Miles.

1254
01:18:08,724 --> 01:18:11,008
Miles, I came
to say goodbye.

1255
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:12,584
We can say goodbye
at the collider.

1256
01:18:12,669 --> 01:18:14,759
You're not getting it.
You're staying here.

1257
01:18:14,845 --> 01:18:16,863
I need to be there.
So you can all go home.

1258
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:20,626
They are going home, Miles.
I'm the only one stayin'.

1259
01:18:20,845 --> 01:18:23,555
You're taking my place?
If you stay here, you'll die.

1260
01:18:23,641 --> 01:18:25,399
I'm doing
what needs to be done.

1261
01:18:25,549 --> 01:18:27,829
I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

1262
01:18:28,487 --> 01:18:29,977
What about MJ?

1263
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:32,876
Not everything works out,
kid.

1264
01:18:34,177 --> 01:18:35,837
I need the goober.

1265
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,477
Please don't make me
take it from you.

1266
01:18:38,562 --> 01:18:39,644
That's not fair!

1267
01:18:39,729 --> 01:18:41,399
You gotta tell them
I can do this.

1268
01:18:41,485 --> 01:18:43,407
It wasn't their decision.

1269
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:50,266
I gotta make Kingpin pay!
You have to let me make him pay!

1270
01:18:50,352 --> 01:18:51,791
Miles, you're gonna get
yourself killed.

1271
01:18:51,876 --> 01:18:53,357
But I'm ready.
I promise!

1272
01:18:56,479 --> 01:18:58,345
Then venom-strike me
right now.

1273
01:18:58,485 --> 01:19:03,009
Or turn invisible on command
so you can get past me.

1274
01:19:13,902 --> 01:19:16,965
Look, I know how
much you want this, kid.

1275
01:19:17,058 --> 01:19:18,957
Poor
little guy.

1276
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:24,606
But you don't
have it yet.

1277
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:31,981
I'm sorry.

1278
01:19:32,996 --> 01:19:35,166
When will I know
I'm ready?

1279
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:39,973
You won't.
It's a leap of faith.

1280
01:19:40,395 --> 01:19:42,090
That's all it is,
Miles.

1281
01:19:42,238 --> 01:19:43,965
A leap of faith.

1282
01:20:24,835 --> 01:20:26,744
Miles.

1283
01:20:27,234 --> 01:20:29,071
Miles, it's your dad.

1284
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,069
Please open the door.

1285
01:20:33,643 --> 01:20:36,252
Miles, I can see
your shadow movin' around.

1286
01:20:38,184 --> 01:20:41,963
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it.
You're still ignoring me.

1287
01:20:42,423 --> 01:20:44,463
Look, can we talk
for a minute?

1288
01:20:46,522 --> 01:20:48,197
Something

1289
01:20:50,057 --> 01:20:52,059
Something happened to

1290
01:20:54,919 --> 01:20:58,220
Look, sometimes
people drift apart, Miles.

1291
01:21:00,336 --> 01:21:03,275
And I don't want that
to happen to us, okay?

1292
01:21:04,049 --> 01:21:06,447
I know I don't always do
what you need me to do

1293
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:08,478
or say
what you need me to say.

1294
01:21:10,913 --> 01:21:15,064
I see this spark in you.
It's amazing. It's why I push you.

1295
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,205
But it's yours.

1296
01:21:18,829 --> 01:21:21,767
Whatever you choose to do
with it, you'll be great.

1297
01:21:29,524 --> 01:21:32,080
Look, call me
when you can. Okay?

1298
01:21:33,244 --> 01:21:34,704
I love you.

1299
01:21:36,107 --> 01:21:38,478
You don't have to
say it back, though.

1300
01:22:57,448 --> 01:22:59,823
200 miles per hour
With a blindfold on

1301
01:22:59,948 --> 01:23:02,240
Mama always asking
"Where did I go wrong?"

1302
01:23:02,355 --> 01:23:04,181
Took you long enough.
What's up, danger?

1303
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:06,811
Ah, what's up, danger?

1304
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:10,011
I see this spark in you.

1305
01:23:10,097 --> 01:23:11,831
It's amazing.

1306
01:23:12,302 --> 01:23:15,495
Whatever you choose to do
with it, you'll be great.

1307
01:23:15,738 --> 01:23:17,995
Our family doesn't
run from things.

1308
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:21,557
You're the best of all of
us, Miles. You're on your way.

1309
01:23:21,643 --> 01:23:23,675
Just keep going.

1310
01:23:24,428 --> 01:23:27,612
When do I
know I'm Spider-Man?

1311
01:23:27,901 --> 01:23:29,862
You won't.

1312
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,937
That's all it is, Miles.

1313
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:35,425
A leap of faith.

1314
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:39,409
Like, what's up, danger?

1315
01:23:41,865 --> 01:23:44,235
Like, what's up, danger?

1316
01:23:47,003 --> 01:23:48,938
Like, what's up, danger?

1317
01:23:52,409 --> 01:23:54,558
Like, what's up, danger?

1318
01:23:54,643 --> 01:23:56,794
Made 'em myself.

1319
01:23:56,879 --> 01:23:58,681
They fit perfectly.

1320
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:06,753
Can't stop me now
Traveled 200 miles

1321
01:24:06,839 --> 01:24:09,440
I'm knockin' at your door
And I don't really care

1322
01:24:09,526 --> 01:24:11,012
If you ain't done wrong
I said I got you now

1323
01:24:11,097 --> 01:24:12,550
Come on, what's up, danger?

1324
01:24:13,252 --> 01:24:14,893
Don't be a stranger

1325
01:24:15,073 --> 01:24:17,615
I'm right here at your door

1326
01:24:17,701 --> 01:24:20,018
I won't leave,
I want more

1327
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:21,878
What's up, danger?

1328
01:24:22,071 --> 01:24:23,554
Yeah, what's up, danger?

1329
01:24:24,847 --> 01:24:26,073
Can't stop me now

1330
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,855
'Cause I like high G's
Sister, I might lose

1331
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,206
I like it all on the edge
Just like you, hey

1332
01:24:30,292 --> 01:24:32,659
I like tall buildings
So I can leap off of 'em

1333
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:34,815
I go hard with it
No matter how dark it is

1334
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:36,940
Come on, what's up, danger?

1335
01:25:05,581 --> 01:25:07,799
Kingpin has a
private elevator entrance

1336
01:25:07,884 --> 01:25:09,800
from his penthouse
to the collider below.

1337
01:25:09,885 --> 01:25:11,769
Didn't count on
having an audience.

1338
01:25:21,948 --> 01:25:23,292
You gotta be kidding me.

1339
01:25:23,378 --> 01:25:25,768
Thank you. It's nice
to be with you this evening

1340
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:27,206
to celebrate Spider-Man.

1341
01:25:27,292 --> 01:25:29,886
He and I were very close

1342
01:25:30,065 --> 01:25:32,955
What a pig.
I'm right here.

1343
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:35,826
Hold on. Get a load of how
the waiters are dressed.

1344
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:37,792
It's in poor taste, but

1345
01:25:38,418 --> 01:25:40,089
It can't be
that easy.

1346
01:25:41,049 --> 01:25:42,643
It's that easy.

1347
01:25:47,878 --> 01:25:49,943
I just wanna
thank Mary Jane Parker

1348
01:25:50,029 --> 01:25:51,581
for being here this evening.

1349
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:53,461
MJ?

1350
01:25:55,098 --> 01:25:59,050
Pay attention.
It's not your MJ, Peter, okay?

1351
01:25:59,306 --> 01:26:01,189
I'm sorry,
I'll be right back.

1352
01:26:01,603 --> 01:26:03,612
Peter! Come here. Trust me.

1353
01:26:03,698 --> 01:26:04,854
I've been there.

1354
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:07,235
You gotta move on, buddy.
It will take one second. Let me just

1355
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,359
Oooh!

1356
01:26:08,445 --> 01:26:10,995
Hello.
Oh, wow.

1357
01:26:11,145 --> 01:26:13,471
Um
I just wondered

1358
01:26:13,557 --> 01:26:16,034
if we could have some more
bread at table 12.

1359
01:26:16,592 --> 01:26:17,878
Yeah.

1360
01:26:20,156 --> 01:26:22,473
I'm just
I'm really sorry.

1361
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:25,543
Oh! Don't be sorry.
It's just bread.

1362
01:26:25,628 --> 01:26:28,057
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

1363
01:26:28,143 --> 01:26:29,580
Mm-hmm.
I didn't even try.

1364
01:26:29,665 --> 01:26:32,370
That's fine. You know,
I should really get going.

1365
01:26:32,456 --> 01:26:34,245
I know I could do better

1366
01:26:34,331 --> 01:26:35,848
if I just had
another chance

1367
01:26:35,934 --> 01:26:41,167
to give you the bread
that you deserve.

1368
01:26:41,349 --> 01:26:42,564
Are you okay?

1369
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,706
We'll take care of
that bread right now.

1370
01:26:44,792 --> 01:26:47,064
Well, it's been nice
talking to you.

1371
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:49,933
For you, they should fill this
place up with fresh bread.

1372
01:26:50,018 --> 01:26:52,637
You all right, man?
Oh, yeah. Totally.

1373
01:26:52,722 --> 01:26:54,705
Good, 'cause we are not
getting any bread.

1374
01:26:56,726 --> 01:26:58,509
I'm just sorry
my family can't see

1375
01:26:58,594 --> 01:27:00,463
what we're doing here
tonight.

1376
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:11,314
Initializing
primary ignition sequence.

1377
01:27:16,905 --> 01:27:18,274
Sleep.

1378
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,439
Start the sequence.

1379
01:27:25,525 --> 01:27:28,471
Uploading Vanessa Fisk
and Richard Fisk DNA sequence.

1380
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:31,108
Beginning scan
for dimensional matches.

1381
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:41,744
Secondary
ignition in five, four,

1382
01:27:41,884 --> 01:27:46,372
three, two, one.

1383
01:28:03,026 --> 01:28:06,230
Peter, you don't have to stay
behind. I can do it.

1384
01:28:06,316 --> 01:28:07,778
It's okay.

1385
01:28:07,863 --> 01:28:09,582
I've made up my mind.

1386
01:28:14,007 --> 01:28:16,490
I'll put the goober in
and take over the beam.

1387
01:28:16,576 --> 01:28:19,562
After you're gone,
I'll blow it up.

1388
01:28:19,709 --> 01:28:21,035
Good luck, guys.

1389
01:28:24,947 --> 01:28:26,215
They know
we're here.

1390
01:28:33,923 --> 01:28:36,793
Nice to see you again,
Peter.

1391
01:28:42,914 --> 01:28:44,383
I got you covered!

1392
01:28:44,469 --> 01:28:46,404
Oh! These guys are the pits.

1393
01:28:54,143 --> 01:28:55,539
Why is this
always difficult?

1394
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:57,789
Where you going, Peter?

1395
01:28:58,537 --> 01:29:00,020
Any last words?

1396
01:29:00,106 --> 01:29:03,008
Can I get a minute to think
about it? You have a pen?

1397
01:29:03,251 --> 01:29:05,755
Goodbye, Peter Parker.

1398
01:29:15,999 --> 01:29:17,549
Who did that?!

1399
01:29:23,793 --> 01:29:26,228
Miles?
Spider-Man?

1400
01:29:26,314 --> 01:29:29,158
Wow, Miles. You're
doing it on command!

1401
01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:30,594
It's about time, right?

1402
01:29:30,679 --> 01:29:33,080
Look who's here!
You figured it out.

1403
01:29:33,166 --> 01:29:34,699
I love you!
I am so proud of you!

1404
01:29:34,784 --> 01:29:36,752
Do I want kids?

1405
01:29:37,613 --> 01:29:39,767
Oh, yeah, I forgot
about her.

1406
01:29:41,424 --> 01:29:43,141
Well, that doesn't look
promising.

1407
01:29:43,226 --> 01:29:44,814
No, it doesn't.

1408
01:29:50,898 --> 01:29:53,502
I've got genetic matches.
Hold on.

1409
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:54,719
It's too risky.

1410
01:29:54,804 --> 01:29:55,892
Shut up and turn it up.

1411
01:29:55,986 --> 01:29:57,683
On your left!
On your right!

1412
01:29:57,768 --> 01:30:00,259
I got five o'clock!
Three o'clock! Two o'clock!

1413
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:03,040
Every direction!

1414
01:30:05,048 --> 01:30:07,031
Get to a shelter.
I'll be right there.

1415
01:30:07,116 --> 01:30:08,470
Speaks Spanish

1416
01:30:08,556 --> 01:30:10,725
I tried the school,
but I can't get through.

1417
01:30:24,284 --> 01:30:26,202
Guys, are you seeing this?

1418
01:30:27,937 --> 01:30:29,987
Looks like our dimensions
are coming to us.

1419
01:30:30,072 --> 01:30:32,017
Does look cool though,
right?

1420
01:30:32,512 --> 01:30:34,448
We gotta get back
up there.

1421
01:30:36,812 --> 01:30:37,892
Is that all you got?

1422
01:30:37,978 --> 01:30:39,896
You gonna fight
or you just bumping gums?

1423
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:41,759
You hard-boiled
turtle slapper!

1424
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:03,286
Speaks Spanish

1425
01:31:03,462 --> 01:31:06,821
What are you,
some kind of silly cartoon?

1426
01:31:06,907 --> 01:31:09,048
You got a problem
with cartoons?

1427
01:31:14,821 --> 01:31:16,324
Blammo!

1428
01:31:21,491 --> 01:31:22,740
Aww

1429
01:31:22,825 --> 01:31:25,087
Did that feel like
a cartoon?

1430
01:31:39,142 --> 01:31:40,524
Gwen!

1431
01:31:48,892 --> 01:31:50,008
I like your suit.

1432
01:31:50,094 --> 01:31:51,485
Thanks. I made it myself.

1433
01:31:51,571 --> 01:31:55,626
That was adorable, team!
Now, hold on tight!

1434
01:32:09,304 --> 01:32:11,789
Buckle up, guys.
This is gonna take a while.

1435
01:32:15,478 --> 01:32:17,161
All right.
Never mind.

1436
01:32:17,247 --> 01:32:18,477
Let's end
this thing.

1437
01:32:18,563 --> 01:32:19,634
Guys,
I got it.

1438
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,954
I'll go. I'm the one
with the goo

1439
01:32:22,677 --> 01:32:23,961
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me.

1440
01:32:24,273 --> 01:32:26,876
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

1441
01:32:32,161 --> 01:32:33,330
Miles!
Be careful!

1442
01:32:47,076 --> 01:32:48,259
That was crazy.

1443
01:32:48,344 --> 01:32:50,193
We taught him that,
right?

1444
01:32:50,278 --> 01:32:53,049
I didn't teach him that.
And you definitely didn't.

1445
01:33:10,965 --> 01:33:12,340
You okay?

1446
01:33:13,883 --> 01:33:15,285
Come on.

1447
01:33:22,144 --> 01:33:24,896
Guys, I got control of the beam!
Get up here!

1448
01:33:26,379 --> 01:33:29,801
Alert! Quantum
polarity has been reversed.

1449
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:36,566
Guess
this is it.

1450
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:40,660
Well, nice to know
we're not alone.

1451
01:33:40,801 --> 01:33:43,160
Right?
Yeah.

1452
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:46,347
I got the portal open.
You first, Peni.

1453
01:33:46,535 --> 01:33:48,144
Thank you,
Miles.

1454
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,426
From both
of us.

1455
01:33:53,613 --> 01:33:56,799
I, uh, love you all.

1456
01:33:57,363 --> 01:33:59,816
I'm taking this cube thing
with me.

1457
01:34:00,054 --> 01:34:01,840
I don't understand it.

1458
01:34:02,147 --> 01:34:03,782
But I will.

1459
01:34:07,572 --> 01:34:09,394
I want you
to have this.

1460
01:34:09,551 --> 01:34:11,308
It'll fit
in your pocket.

1461
01:34:12,552 --> 01:34:14,371
That's all, folks.

1462
01:34:14,636 --> 01:34:17,152
Is he allowed
to say that, legally?

1463
01:34:20,949 --> 01:34:22,966
Do I get to like
the hairdo now?

1464
01:34:24,574 --> 01:34:26,257
You know I'm older than you.

1465
01:34:26,465 --> 01:34:29,676
15 months, but it's pretty
significant if you ask me.

1466
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,397
Well, Einstein said
time was relative, right?

1467
01:34:34,668 --> 01:34:35,970
Nice.

1468
01:34:38,653 --> 01:34:40,152
Friends?

1469
01:34:41,656 --> 01:34:42,972
Friends.

1470
01:34:43,192 --> 01:34:44,394
Cool.

1471
01:34:44,496 --> 01:34:46,210
See you around,
Spider-Man.

1472
01:34:57,167 --> 01:34:58,543
Your turn.

1473
01:34:59,387 --> 01:35:02,257
Yeah, yeah. Right.

1474
01:35:05,769 --> 01:35:07,902
You're not going anywhere!

1475
01:35:08,457 --> 01:35:10,500
I'll hold him off.
You shut this down.

1476
01:35:10,585 --> 01:35:12,082
Peter,
that wasn't the deal!

1477
01:35:12,168 --> 01:35:15,652
Push the green button!
Do not wait for me!

1478
01:35:19,285 --> 01:35:21,678
What are you doing?
You gotta go home!

1479
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:24,722
This guy could kill you!
I can't let Spider-Man die.

1480
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:26,168
Neither can I.

1481
01:35:28,637 --> 01:35:30,386
It's okay.

1482
01:35:30,786 --> 01:35:32,636
Yeah, it is okay.

1483
01:35:36,679 --> 01:35:38,855
You gotta go home, man.

1484
01:35:40,648 --> 01:35:43,082
How do I know
I'm not gonna mess it up again?

1485
01:35:43,306 --> 01:35:44,785
You won't.

1486
01:35:45,837 --> 01:35:47,219
Right.

1487
01:35:47,484 --> 01:35:49,363
It's a leap of faith.

1488
01:35:58,475 --> 01:36:00,433
Not bad, kid.

1489
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:11,465
Kingpin!

1490
01:36:24,626 --> 01:36:25,742
Nope!

1491
01:36:25,827 --> 01:36:28,063
Sorry! That's cheating.

1492
01:36:30,299 --> 01:36:31,585
Adiós.

1493
01:36:39,674 --> 01:36:41,677
I gotta get to that button.

1494
01:36:46,549 --> 01:36:47,974
Oh, no.

1495
01:36:48,089 --> 01:36:51,005
Not so easy doing it
on your own, is it?

1496
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:56,705
I can't wait to kill
one more Spider-Man.

1497
01:36:59,888 --> 01:37:01,935
Where am I?
What?

1498
01:37:02,043 --> 01:37:03,473
Wilson?

1499
01:37:03,644 --> 01:37:06,718
Is this what you want, man?
What are you doing?

1500
01:37:06,804 --> 01:37:09,186
Vanessa. Vanessa.

1501
01:37:09,272 --> 01:37:11,435
What are we doing here?
I don't know, Richard.

1502
01:37:11,521 --> 01:37:13,599
It's me. You know me.

1503
01:37:14,101 --> 01:37:15,786
We're leaving now.

1504
01:37:16,021 --> 01:37:17,528
Don't go.

1505
01:37:18,147 --> 01:37:19,530
Stay with me.

1506
01:37:19,669 --> 01:37:21,208
Please!

1507
01:37:26,402 --> 01:37:29,489
You're not stopping this.
Not today.

1508
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:32,391
I am stopping this.
Right now!

1509
01:37:40,112 --> 01:37:42,349
I need backup.

1510
01:38:19,845 --> 01:38:21,251
Come on.

1511
01:38:29,511 --> 01:38:32,570
The real Spider-Man
couldn't even beat me.

1512
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:36,820
You're nothing!

1513
01:38:42,531 --> 01:38:44,767
You took my family.

1514
01:38:48,603 --> 01:38:52,708
And now I'm gonna make sure
you never see yours again.

1515
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:14,421
Get up, Spider-Man.

1516
01:39:16,431 --> 01:39:18,945
Get up! Come on!

1517
01:39:25,811 --> 01:39:29,234
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1518
01:39:40,302 --> 01:39:42,491
I'll always have my family.

1519
01:39:43,482 --> 01:39:45,741
You ever hear of
the shoulder touch?

1520
01:39:46,326 --> 01:39:47,726
What?

1521
01:39:51,661 --> 01:39:52,743
Hey.

1522
01:40:02,262 --> 01:40:06,902
Hey, Kingpin!
Push the green button for me!

1523
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:58,477
Miles? Miles? Miles?
A-A-A-Are you okay?

1524
01:41:58,626 --> 01:42:00,158
Yeah, I'm okay.

1525
01:42:00,617 --> 01:42:01,878
You're probably busy,
so

1526
01:42:01,964 --> 01:42:04,377
No, no no! I can talk,
I can talk.

1527
01:42:04,735 --> 01:42:07,885
Look, so I came by earlier
because, uh

1528
01:42:09,016 --> 01:42:11,025
Your uncle
I know, Dad.

1529
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:14,173
I am so sorry.

1530
01:42:14,259 --> 01:42:15,634
Yeah.

1531
01:42:16,478 --> 01:42:17,861
Do you know
who did it?

1532
01:42:17,946 --> 01:42:19,353
I thought I did.

1533
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:21,489
But I was wrong.

1534
01:42:21,916 --> 01:42:25,103
Look, Miles,
what I said at the door,

1535
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:26,884
it wasn't just talk.

1536
01:42:28,677 --> 01:42:30,761
Look, you know,
I was thinking

1537
01:42:30,854 --> 01:42:33,473
maybe we could find
a nice wall,

1538
01:42:33,605 --> 01:42:34,980
privately owned,
Okay, dad.

1539
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:36,892
Like at the police station,
Okay.

1540
01:42:36,978 --> 01:42:42,345
And you could "throw up"
some of your art.

1541
01:42:42,962 --> 01:42:44,759
Man, I'm bad at this.

1542
01:42:45,072 --> 01:42:48,267
Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?

1543
01:42:49,141 --> 01:42:51,494
Oh, come on, man.
C-Mobile!

1544
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:53,580
Officer.
Spider-Man!

1545
01:42:54,005 --> 01:42:56,611
Listen, down there,
that was

1546
01:42:56,784 --> 01:42:58,433
I I mean, I owe you

1547
01:42:58,519 --> 01:43:00,723
Ooo-kay!

1548
01:43:08,168 --> 01:43:10,006
I look
forward to workin' with you.

1549
01:43:10,091 --> 01:43:12,877
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, me, too. I guess.

1550
01:43:12,963 --> 01:43:14,854
I-I-I don't approve of
your methods,

1551
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:19,104
but we're just gonna have
to agree to disagree.

1552
01:43:19,571 --> 01:43:22,104
Thank you for
your bravery tonight.

1553
01:43:22,643 --> 01:43:23,924
I love you.

1554
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:25,112
Wait, what?

1555
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:26,529
And look behind you!

1556
01:43:38,431 --> 01:43:40,315
All right. Cool. Yeah.

1557
01:43:40,401 --> 01:43:42,065
Thanks, Spider-Man.
Spider-Man, a su servicio.

1558
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:42,838
Thank you.

1559
01:43:42,924 --> 01:43:44,776
Hey, man. What's up,
little man?

1560
01:43:44,862 --> 01:43:45,721
New Spider-Man.

1561
01:43:45,807 --> 01:43:47,049
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm the new Spider-Man.

1562
01:43:47,134 --> 01:43:48,416
Check it out.

1563
01:43:48,547 --> 01:43:49,795
Whoa!

1564
01:43:49,902 --> 01:43:51,971
That was part of the move.

1565
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:55,588
Okay, let's do
this one last time, yeah?

1566
01:43:55,674 --> 01:43:57,190
For real this time. This is it.

1567
01:43:57,315 --> 01:43:58,861
My name is Miles Morales.

1568
01:43:58,946 --> 01:44:01,065
I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.

1569
01:44:01,151 --> 01:44:02,510
And for like two days,

1570
01:44:02,596 --> 01:44:04,627
I've been
the one and only Spider-Man.

1571
01:44:04,877 --> 01:44:06,233
I think you know the rest.

1572
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:07,932
I finished my essay.

1573
01:44:08,235 --> 01:44:10,143
Saved a bunch of people.

1574
01:44:12,103 --> 01:44:14,200
Got hit by a drone.

1575
01:44:14,286 --> 01:44:16,401
I did this with my dad.

1576
01:44:17,127 --> 01:44:19,398
Met my roommate. Finally.

1577
01:44:21,236 --> 01:44:24,409
Slapped a sticker where
my dad's never gonna find it.

1578
01:44:24,909 --> 01:44:26,471
And when I feel alone,

1579
01:44:26,557 --> 01:44:29,268
like no one understands
what I'm going through,

1580
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,276
I remember my friends
who get it.

1581
01:44:39,166 --> 01:44:41,671
I never thought I'd be able
to do any of this stuff.

1582
01:44:41,756 --> 01:44:43,534
But I can.

1583
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:46,830
Anyone can wear the mask.

1584
01:44:48,095 --> 01:44:50,510
You could wear the mask.

1585
01:44:51,869 --> 01:44:55,252
If you didn't know that before,
I hope you do now.

1586
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:05,518
'Cause I'm Spider-Man.

1587
01:45:07,005 --> 01:45:09,628
And I'm not the only one.

1588
01:45:09,736 --> 01:45:10,908
Not by a long shot.

1589
01:45:10,988 --> 01:45:13,443
Needless to say
I keep her in check

1590
01:45:13,528 --> 01:45:16,058
She was all bad-bad
Nevertheless

1591
01:45:16,167 --> 01:45:18,782
Callin' it quits now
Baby, I'm a wreck

1592
01:45:18,867 --> 01:45:22,085
Miles. Miles!

1593
01:45:22,248 --> 01:45:23,730
You got a minute?

1594
01:45:33,589 --> 01:45:35,207
Stepped out of my zone
My zone

1595
01:45:35,292 --> 01:45:37,090
I had to get out all alone
All alone

1596
01:45:37,175 --> 01:45:38,792
And figure it out on my own
My own

1597
01:45:38,877 --> 01:45:40,870
And I know what
I really want now

1598
01:45:40,956 --> 01:45:42,572
Can't stop me
Can't break me

1599
01:45:42,657 --> 01:45:44,207
What don't kill me
Gon' make me

1600
01:45:44,292 --> 01:45:46,198
Shoot for the stars
No safety

1601
01:45:46,284 --> 01:45:47,855
And now I see clear in HD

1602
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:49,746
Gotta go hard
Gotta go hard

1603
01:45:49,831 --> 01:45:51,581
I ain't got time to waste
I ain't got time

01:45:51,666 --> 01:45:53,378

You gotta choose a side
You gotta choose a side

You better keep
You better do what's right

1612
01:46:08,303 --> 01:46:09,671
Or you gonna lose the fight

1613

You gonna
Gotta go hard

1614
01:46:11,153 --> 01:46:12,108

Heroes never die

1619
01:46:18,241 --> 01:46:19,803
I'm a web slinger
to a gunslinger

1620
01:46:19,889 --> 01:46:21,616
No millimeter
this is my arena

1621
01:46:21,702 --> 01:46:23,538
I'm the black widow
with the best stinger

1622
01:46:23,624 --> 01:46:25,242
And I'll make you scream
like a bad singer

1623
01:46:25,327 --> 01:46:27,272
I'm everything that you
wanna be plus more

1624
01:46:27,358 --> 01:46:29,152
Since there's
no heroes anymore

1625
01:46:29,237 --> 01:46:31,116
Jump out the window
him with the mask on

1626
01:46:31,202 --> 01:46:32,929
Who the bad man
that our man gotta bash on?

1627
01:46:33,014 --> 01:46:35,600
Oh, we'll never link up
blink and you will see us

Young prince 'bout to ink up

Oh, we'll never link up

Something powerful

1635
01:46:51,514 --> 01:46:53,389
Tried to balance life
and my sanity

1636
01:46:53,475 --> 01:46:55,358

Okay, I fight crime
Through the nighttime

When the lights shine
I go python

1651
01:47:21,156 --> 01:47:22,943
I'm falling on
my last lifeline

1652
01:47:23,029 --> 01:47:24,779
There's no way
in my right mind

1653
01:47:24,865 --> 01:47:26,670
My city up on my back tight

1654
01:47:26,756 --> 01:47:28,539
How can I possibly
act right?

1655
01:47:28,625 --> 01:47:30,295
I'm Robin Hood
I'm the black knight

1656

Battling evil

Fighting my demons
I'm nice for a reason

1660
01:47:38,045 --> 01:47:39,905
Enticed with the bleeding
I'm showing my sins

1661
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:42,467
How can you expect me
to stay sane?

Protect me

Look, I ain't got no time
to be hanging around nobody

All of 'em weak in the knees
Knees

1738
01:50:40,137 --> 01:50:41,817
Scary how lights When they freeze
Freeze

1739
01:50:41,902 --> 01:50:43,718
Well, we keep on going until we win
Win

1740
01:50:43,803 --> 01:50:45,402
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

1741
01:50:45,488 --> 01:50:47,355
We are the way up
Up

1742
01:50:47,441 --> 01:50:48,988
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

1743
01:50:49,073 --> 01:50:51,058
We are the way up
Up

1744
01:50:51,143 --> 01:50:52,893
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

1745
01:50:52,978 --> 01:50:54,752
We are the way up

01:50:54,838 --> 01:50:56,477
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

1747
01:50:56,563 --> 01:50:58,568
We are the way up
Up

1748
01:51:12,175 --> 01:51:13,580
Well

1749
01:51:21,141 --> 01:51:23,002
Ha!

1750
01:51:30,135 --> 01:51:31,776
This morning
I woke up

1751
01:51:31,862 --> 01:51:33,736
In a fortress of distortion

1752
01:51:33,831 --> 01:51:35,648
I'm at war with my emotions

1753
01:51:35,733 --> 01:51:37,716
I'm at war with
they enforce me

1754
01:51:37,801 --> 01:51:39,641
Trying to fight for what's
right, and got sidetracked

1755
01:51:39,726 --> 01:51:41,753
Where your mind at?
Never mind that

1756
01:51:41,838 --> 01:51:44,090
Got me thinking a blink
you swim and you sinking

1757
01:51:44,175 --> 01:51:47,193
You wouldn't, you leave me
here for my loaded weapon

1758
01:51:47,278 --> 01:51:49,595
I still owe my brother
my present protection

1759
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,581
My prayer, my sights
So I'm doing what's right

1760
01:51:51,666 --> 01:51:53,542
And I ask you no questions
Questions

1761
01:51:53,627 --> 01:51:55,467
I wanna be home-free
Homefree

1762
01:51:55,552 --> 01:51:57,535
Where's one that was lonely
Lonely

1763
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:59,534
But I'm ready and waiting
Waiting

1764
01:51:59,631 --> 01:52:02,456
For my day of salvation
and I'm patient

1765
01:52:02,592 --> 01:52:06,408
Ohhh whoa, Ohhh whoa

01:52:59,325 --> 01:53:03,710
Ohhh whoa, Ohhh whoa

1788
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:05,841
My rebel lone yell
Yell

1789
01:53:05,927 --> 01:53:07,539
My rebel lone
Lone

1790
01:53:07,632 --> 01:53:14,263
Ohhh whoa, Ohhh whoa

1791
01:53:15,731 --> 01:53:22,271
Ohhh whoa, Ohhh whoa

Ohhh whoa, Ohhh whoa

1793
01:54:19,321 --> 01:54:22,814
Oh,
Spidey-bells Spidey-bells

1794
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,516
Swinging through Midtown

1795
01:54:24,626 --> 01:54:26,485
Oh, what fun to sling a web

1796
01:54:26,571 --> 01:54:28,446
And take the bad guys down

1797
01:54:28,531 --> 01:54:30,348
Spidey-bells, Spidey-bells

1798
01:54:30,433 --> 01:54:32,115
Quipping all the time

1799
01:54:32,207 --> 01:54:33,919
Oh, what fun
to swing around

1800
01:54:34,036 --> 01:54:36,053
New York
While fighting crime

1801
01:54:36,138 --> 01:54:37,899
Swinging through
the streets

1802
01:54:37,985 --> 01:54:39,688
On a web of spider silk

1803
01:54:39,969 --> 01:54:41,641
Kicking all the butts

1804
01:54:41,727 --> 01:54:43,578
Of villains and their ilk

1805
01:54:43,663 --> 01:54:45,680
Bombs from Goblins fling
Fling

1806
01:54:45,765 --> 01:54:47,557
Pumpkins blooming bright
Bright

1807
01:54:47,667 --> 01:54:49,284
How hard it is
To consistently bring

1808
01:54:49,369 --> 01:54:50,851
Peace to New York all night

1809
01:54:50,937 --> 01:54:53,155
Oh, Spidey-bells
Might be swell

1810
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,735
To do more than fight crime

1811
01:54:54,821 --> 01:54:57,946
I got a lot of qualities
That don't get much airtime

1812
01:54:58,321 --> 01:55:00,820
I can sing, I can dance
I tell jokes, I act

1813
01:55:00,906 --> 01:55:02,914
I get big, big,
big deal

1814
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,618
If my agent called me back

1815
01:55:06,594 --> 01:55:10,480
Why did I agree

1816
01:55:10,689 --> 01:55:15,235
To do this stupid song?

1817
01:55:15,391 --> 01:55:18,242
I have a degree

1818
01:55:18,365 --> 01:55:22,922
In chemical engineering

1819
01:55:32,328 --> 01:55:33,305
You're a bit late.

1820
01:55:33,391 --> 01:55:34,626
We can't all be
everywhere at once.

1821
01:55:34,711 --> 01:55:35,884
Little text
might've been nice.

1822
01:55:35,969 --> 01:55:37,947
I was gone for less than two hours.
What happened?

1823
01:55:38,032 --> 01:55:40,015
Okay. Okay.
I know what it looks like.

1824
01:55:40,101 --> 01:55:42,486
But here's the good news.
Oh, here we go.

1825
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:44,617
The multiverse didn't collapse.

1826
01:55:44,703 --> 01:55:46,421
Oh, cool!
Little touch and go.

1827
01:55:46,507 --> 01:55:47,515
But it worked out.

1828
01:55:47,601 --> 01:55:49,141
Great story. Did
you finish the goober?

1829
01:55:49,226 --> 01:55:50,554
It's not a goober.
It's a gizmo.

1830
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:51,822
Do you always
have to call me out?

1831
01:55:51,907 --> 01:55:53,153
It's just really frustrating
and bums me out.

1832
01:55:53,238 --> 01:55:54,489
Don't get excited, Miguel.

1833
01:55:54,574 --> 01:55:55,998
It's just a prototype.
Not excited.

1834
01:55:56,083 --> 01:55:57,579
But you could
be the first person

1835
01:55:57,625 --> 01:55:59,508
to make an autonomous
multiverse jump.

1836
01:55:59,638 --> 01:56:00,638
Or the last.

1837
01:56:00,726 --> 01:56:02,476
Okay. So we're just gonna roll
the dice on this?

1838
01:56:02,524 --> 01:56:05,308
So, what you do you say, pal?
Where you want to go first?

1839
01:56:05,645 --> 01:56:08,497
Let's start at the beginning
one last time.

1840
01:56:08,664 --> 01:56:10,563
Earth '67.

1841
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:14,719
Whoa!
What the?

1842
01:56:14,805 --> 01:56:15,938
I'm Spider-Man.

1843
01:56:16,024 --> 01:56:17,634
I need you to come with me.
Who the heck are you?

1844
01:56:17,719 --> 01:56:20,398
I-I just told you
Listen. Listen I'm from the future.

1845
01:56:20,484 --> 01:56:22,750
How dare you point at me!
You were pointing first.

1846
01:56:22,836 --> 01:56:24,570
It's rude to point.
You're being very rude.

1847
01:56:24,655 --> 01:56:27,181
You're not believing I'm not
Which one pointed first?

1848
01:56:27,267 --> 01:56:28,875
Spider-Man pointed first.
Obviously.

1849
01:56:28,961 --> 01:56:30,500
You're pointing at me right now.
I'm not pointing.

1850
01:56:30,585 --> 01:56:31,453
What you say? Look at you
You're pointing.

1851
01:56:31,539 --> 01:56:32,703
Look at your finger. Look at.
I'm just Pointing at

1852
01:56:32,788 --> 01:56:33,977
your finger right now.
Which is different. Then normal

1853
01:56:34,062 --> 01:56:35,305
You're pointing
pointing. You haven't seen.

1854
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:36,225
You're accusing me.
Pointing

1855
01:56:36,318 --> 01:56:38,264
of pointing while you're
at you. Then No.
