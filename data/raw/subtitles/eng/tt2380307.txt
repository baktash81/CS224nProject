00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,390
<i>Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.</i>

2
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,350
<i>'Cause of something that happened
before I was even born.</i>

3
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,430
<i>See, a long time ago,
there was this family.</i>

4
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,390
<i>The Papá, he was a musician.</i>

5
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,790
<i>He and his family
would sing and dance</i>

6
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,110
<i>and count their blessings.</i>

7
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,350
<i>But he also had a dream.</i>

8
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,550
<i>To play for the world.</i>

9
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,510
<i>And one day...</i>

10
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,070
<i>he left with his guitar...</i>

11
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,790
<i>and never returned.</i>

12
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,350
<i>And my Mamá...</i>

13
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,510
<i>She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.</i>

14
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,470
<i>After banishing all music
from her life...</i>

15
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,670
<i>she found a way
to provide for her daughter.</i>

16
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,230
<i>She rolled up her sleeves...</i>

17
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,190
<i>and she learned to make shoes.</i>

18
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,510
<i>She could have made candy.</i>

19
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,310
<i>O-o-or fireworks.</i>

20
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,070
<i>Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers.</i>

21
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,590
<i>But no.</i>

22
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,070
<i>She chose shoes.</i>

23
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,590
<i>Then she taught
her daughter to make shoes.</i>

24
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,310
<i>And later, she taught
her son-in-law.</i>

25
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,550
<i>Then her grandkids got roped in.</i>

26
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,670
<i>As her family grew,
so did the business.</i>

27
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,670
<i>Music have torn
her family apart.</i>

28
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,750
<i>But shoes held
them all together.</i>

29
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,190
<i>You see that woman...</i>

30
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,710
<i>was my great-great-grandmother...</i>

31
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,870
<i>MamáImelda.</i>

32
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,070
<i>She died way before I was born.</i>

33
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,550
<i>But my family still
tells her story...</i>

34
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,350
<i>every year on Día de los Muertos
... the Day of the Dead...</i>

35
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,270
<i>And her little girl?
She's my great-grandmother, MamáCoco.</i>

36
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,590
Hola, MamáCoco.

37
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,590
How are you, Julio?

38
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,710
Actually, my name is Miguel.

39
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,270
MamáCoco has trouble
remembering things.

40
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,310
But it's good to talk to her,
anyway.

41
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,270
So, I tell her
pretty much everything.

42
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,870
I used to run like this.

43
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,390
But now I run like this,
it's just way faster.

44
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,350
The winner is...
luchadora Coco!

45
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,990
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

46
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,150
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

47
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,910
Miguel, eat your food.

48
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,190
My abuelita, she's
MamáCoco's daughter.

49
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,190
Aw, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.

50
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,230
No, gracias.

51
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,710
I asked if you would like
more tamales.

52
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,310
S-Si?

53
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,430
That's what I thought you said!

54
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,470
Abuelita runs the house
just as MamáImelda did.

55
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,790
No music!

56
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,550

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,950
Down.

70
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,030
Roll over.

71
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,230

I know, I'm not supposed
to love music.

75
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,950
But it's not my fault.

76
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,550
It's his.

77
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,550
Ernesto de la Cruz.

78
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,350
The greatest musician
of all time.

79
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,150
Here in this very plaza,
the young Ernesto de la Cruz

80
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,470
took his first steps
toward becoming

81
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,550
the most beloved singer
in Mexican history.

82
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,790
<i>He started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.</i>

83
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,190
<i>But when he played music,</i>

84
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,750
<i>he made people
fall in love with him.</i>

85
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,190
<i>He starred in movies.</i>

86
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,550
<i>He had the coolest guitar.</i>

87
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,270
<i>He could fly!</i>

88
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,990

I wanna be just like him.

108
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,710
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz...

109
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,830
and I get this feeling.

110
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,750
Like we're connected somehow.

111
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,710
Like if he could play music...

112
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,430
maybe someday, I could too!

113
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,590

Ay, ay, ay, muchacho!

115
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,350
Huh?

116
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,270
I asked for a shoe shine,
not your life story.

117
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,750
Oh, yeah, sorry.

118
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,990
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home, so.

119
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,430
Look, if I were you,

120
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,350
I'd march right up
to my family and say,

121
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,750
"Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it!"

122
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,230
I could never say that.

123
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,350
You are a musician, no?
I could never say that.

124
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,110
You are a musician, no?

125
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,470
I-I-I don't know.

126
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,870
I mean, I only really
play for myself.

127
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,910
Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician

128
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,030
by hiding his sweet,
sweet skills?

129
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,030
No!

130
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,030
He walked out onto that plaza

131
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,110
and he played out loud!

132
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,310
Mira, Mira, they're
setting up for tonight.

133
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,910
The music competition for
Día de Muertos.

134
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,630
You wanna be like your hero?
You should sign up!

135
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,350
Unh-unh. My family would freak!

136
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,910
Look, if you're too scared,
then, well, have fun making shoes.

137
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,870
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

138
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,030
Seize your moment?

139
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,750
Show me what you got,
muchacho.

140
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,510
I'll be your first audience.

141
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,950
Miguel!

142
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,110
Ah!

143
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,630
Abuelita!

144
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,190
What are you doing here?

145
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,910
Um... oh... uh...

146
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,590
You leave my grandson alone!

147
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,230
Doña, please! I was just
getting a shine.

148
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,790
I know your tricks, mariachi.

149
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,910
What did he say to you?

150
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,510
He was just showing me
his guitar.

151
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,030
Shame on you!

152
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,630
My grandson is a
is a sweet little

153
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,910
angelito, perrito, cielito!

154
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,470
He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.

155
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,070
You keep away from him.

156
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,710
Ay, pobrecito!

157
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,870
Estas bien, mijo.

158
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,630
You know better than
to be here in this place.

159
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,390
You will come home.
Now.

160
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,830
How many times
have we told you?

161
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,990
That plaza is crawling
with mariachis.

162
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,710
Yes, Tío Berto.

163
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,070
No, no, no, no, no.

164
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,190
Hey, go away, you. Go!

165
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,590
It's just Dante.

166
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,390
Never name a street dog.

167
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,750
They'll follow you forever.

168
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,550
Now, go get my shoe.

169
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,950
I found your son in
Mariachi Plaza.

170
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,350
Ay, Miguel?

171
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,510
You know how abuelita
feels about the plaza.

172
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,750
I was just shining shoes.

173
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,230
A musician's shoes.

174
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,310
But the plaza's where
the foot traffic is.

175
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,950
If abuelita says, "No more plaza",
then no more plaza.

176
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,190
But what about tonight?

177
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,150
What's tonight?

178
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,950
Well, they're having
this talent show.

179
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,870
- A-and I thought I might...
- Sign up?

180
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,910
Well, maybe?

181
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,590
You have to have talent
to be in a talent show.

182
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,430
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes? Oh!

183
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,510
It's Día de los Muertos.
No one's going any where.

184
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,270
Tonight is about family.

185
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,870
Ofrenda room. Vámonos.

186
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,950
Don't give me that look.

187
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,470
Día de los Muertos is the
one night of the year

188
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,670
our ancestors can come visit us.

189
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,550
We put their photos
on the ofrenda

190
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,550
so their spririts can cross over.

191
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,470
That is very important.

192
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,070
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

193
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,510
We made all this food.

194
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,510
Set out the things
they loved in life, mijo.

195
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,750
All this work to
bring the family together.

196
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,270
I don't want you sneaking off
to who-knows-where.

197
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,310
Huh! Where are you going?

198
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,790
- I thought we were done.
- Ay, Dios mío.

199
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,230
Being part of this family means
being here for this family.

200
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,750
I don't want to see you
end up like...

201
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,110
Like MamáCoco's papá?

202
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,750
Never mention that man!

203
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,870
He's better off forgotten.

204
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,150
- But you're the one who...
- Eh, thchhsss!

205
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,550
- I was just...
- Tchsshh!

206
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,230
- But...
- Tchshh.

207
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,990
- I...
- Shhh.

208
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,150
Papá?

209
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,790
Papáis home?

210
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,150
Mamá, cáImese, cáImese.

211
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,870
Papáis coming home?

212
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,470
No, Mamá, it's okay.
I'm here.

213
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,630
Who are you?

214
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,270
Ay... rest, Mamá.

215
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,750
I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.

216
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,430
Miguel?

217
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,830
Miguel?

218
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,750
Ay.

219
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,350
What are we going to do
with that boy?

220
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,110
Ha ha ha, you're right.

221
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,190
That's just what he needs.

222
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,830
Huah!

223
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,950
Oh, it's you. Get in here.

224
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,590
Come on, Dante. Hurry up.

225
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,950
You're gonna get me
in trouble, boy.

226
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,470
Someone can hear me.

227
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,350
I wish someone
wanted to hear me.

228
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,110
Other than you.

229
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,950
Ew, okay!

230
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,990
Perfecto.

231
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,350
<i>I have to sing.</i>

232
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,870
<i>I have to play.</i>

233
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,590
<i>The music, it's...
it's not just in me.</i>

234
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,470
<i>It </i>is<i> me.</i>

235
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,350
<i>When life gets me down.</i>

236
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,870
<i>I play my guitar.</i>

237
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,870
<i>The rest of the world may
follow the rules, but I...</i>

238
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,790
<i>must follow my heart.</i>

239
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,150
Ugh.

240
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,630
<i>You know that feeling...</i>

241
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,190
<i>like there's a song in the air</i>

242
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,310
<i>and it's playing just for you?</i>

243
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,430
<i>♪ A feeling so close ♪</i>

244
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,350
<i>♪ You could reach out
and touch it ♪</i>

245
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,070
<i>♪ I never knew ♪</i>

246
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,710
<i>♪ I could want something
so much ♪</i>

247
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,310
<i>♪ But it's true ♪</i>

248
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,470
<i>You must have faith, sister.</i>

249
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,710
<i>Oh, but Padre,
he will never listen.</i>

250
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,830
<i>He will listen to music!</i>

251
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,550
<i>♪ Only a song, only a song ♪</i>

252
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,190
<i>♪ Has the power
to change a heart ♪</i>

253
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,630
<i>Never underestimate
the power of music.</i>

254
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,310
<i>But my father,</i>

255
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,030
<i>he will never give
his permission.</i>

256
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,110
<i>I am done
asking permission.</i>

257
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,190
<i>When you see your moment,</i>

258
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,750
<i>you mustn't let it pass you by.</i>

259
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,750
<i>You must seize it.</i>

260
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,070
<i>Señor de la Cruz,</i>

261
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,550
<i>what did it take for you
to seize your moment?</i>

262
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,830
<i>I had to have faith
in my dream.</i>

263
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,790
<i>No one was going to hand it to me.</i>

264
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,150
<i>It was up to me to
reach for that dream.</i>

265
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,710
<i>Grab it tight...</i>

266
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,590
<i>and make it come true.</i>

267
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,630
No more hiding, Dante.

268
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,230
I gotta seize my moment.

269
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,190
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza
if it kills me.

270
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,590
Día de Muertos has begun!

271
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,470
No, no, no, no, no.

272
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,310
We have to make a clear path.

273
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,550
The petals guide
our ancestors home.

274
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,270
- Mamá!
- Hunh!

275
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,710
Where should we put this table?

276
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,870
In the courtyard, mijos.

277
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,110
You want it down
by the kitchen?

278
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,710
Si, eh, next to the other one.

279
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,150
Get under, get under!

280
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,910
Miguel?

281
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,070
Uh, nothing.

282
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,070
Mamá, Papá, I...

283
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,110
Miguel, your abuelita have

284
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,910
the most wonderful idea.

285
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,270
We've all decided...

286
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,910
it's time you joined us
in the workshop!

287
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,670
What?

288
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,310
No more shining shoes.

289
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,070
You will be making them,
every day, after school.

290
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,910
Oh, our Miguelitititito

291
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,510
carrying on the family tradition.

292
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,470
And on Día de los Muertos!

293
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,430
Your ancestors
would be so proud.

294
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,790
You'll craft huaraches
just like your Tía Victoria.

295
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,350
And wing tips just like
your PapáJulio.

296
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,070
But what if I'm no good
at making shoes?

297
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,430
Ay, Miguel.

298
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,750
You have your family here
to guide you.

299
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,030
You are a Rivera.

300
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,870
And a Rivera is?

301
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,790
A shoemaker...

302
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,830
through and through.

303
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,110
That's my boy!

304
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,910
Haha! Berto!
Break out the good stuff!

305
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,550
Mm, mm, mm, mwah!

306
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,590
Dante!

307
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,590
No, Dante, stop!

308
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,150
Hunh!

309
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,350
Ah!

310
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,830
No, no, no, no, no!

311
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,950
No.

312
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,470
De la Cruz' guitar?

313
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,750
Ah?

314
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,630
Papá?

315
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,790
MamáCoco.

316
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,590
Is your papáErnesto de la Cruz?

317
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,110
Papá! Papá!

318
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,990
Haha!

319
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,070
Papá, Papá!

320
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,270
It's him!

321
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,950
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was!

322
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,830
Miguel, get down from there.

323
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,310
MamáCoco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!

324
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,870
What are you talking about?

325
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,670
I'm gonna be a musician!

326
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,750
What is all this?

327
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,950
You keep secrets
from your own family?

328
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,830
It's all that time he spends
in the plaza.

329
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,710
Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.

330
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,870
It's not a fantasy.

331
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,030
That man was
Ernesto de la Cruz.

332
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,710
The greatest musician
of all time.

333
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,430
We've never known
anything about this man.

334
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,870
Or whoever he was,
he still abandoned his family.

335
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,230
It's no future for my son.

336
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,150
Well, Papá, y-you said
my family would guide me.

337
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,310
Well, de la Cruz <i>is</i> my family.

338
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,990
I'm supposed to play music.

339
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,350
Never! That man's music
was a curse.

340
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,870
I will not allow it.

341
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,670
- If you would just...
- Miguel.

342
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,870
You will listen to your family.

343
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,590
No more music.

344
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,790
Just listen to me play.

345
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,150
End of argument.

346
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,590
You want to end up
like that man?

347
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,750
Forgotten?

348
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,910
Left off your family's ofrenda?

349
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,030
I don't care if I'm on some
stupid ofrenda.

350
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,950
- Hunh!
- Hunh!

351
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,870
- No!
- Mamá!

352
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,230
There.

353
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,550
No guitar.

354
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,950
No music.

355
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,950
Aw, come.

356
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,110
You'll feel better after
you eat with your family.

357
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,750
I don't wanna be in this family!

358
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,990
Miguel, Miguel!

359
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,590
I-I wanna play in the plaza.

360
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,630
Like de la Cruz.

361
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,030
C-can I still sign up?

362
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,110
You got an instrument?

363
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,630
No. But if I can borrow a guitar.

364
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,510
Musicians gotta bring
their own instruments.

365
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,270
You find a guitar, kid,
I'll put you on the list.

366
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,030
Hey, excuse me,
can I borrow your guitar?

367
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,310
Sorry, muchaco.

368
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,790
You guys have a spare guitar?

369
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,710
No.

370
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,990
I need a guitar
just for a little bit.

371
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,510
Get outta here, kid.

372
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,590
Great-great-grandfather.

373
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,830
What am I supposed to do?

374
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,230
No, no, no, no.
Dante, stop.

375
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,230
Cállate, shh.

376
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,230
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,630
Señor de la Cruz.

378
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,950
Please don't be mad.

379
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,390
I-I'm Miguel.

380
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,150
Your great-great-grandson.

381
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,630
I-I need to borrow this.

382
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,790
Our family thinks
music is a curse.

383
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,310
None of them understand.
But I know you would have.

384
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,910
You would have told me
to follow my heart.

385
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,830
To seize my moment.

386
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,470
So, if it's all right with you...

387
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,110
I'm gonna play in the Plaza.

388
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,910
Just like you did!

389
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,710
Huh?

390
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,110
What's going on?

391
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,830
Somebody stole
de la Cruz' guitar.

392
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,310
The window is broken, look!

393
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,910
All right, who's in there?

394
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,870
I'm sorry, i-it's not
what it looks like.

395
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,670
De la Cruz is my...

396
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,030
Huh!

397
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,230
There's nobody here!

398
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,670
- Miguel!
- Mamá!

399
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,350
Miguel, come home!

400
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,190
Dios mio, little boy!
Are you okay?

401
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,990
Here, let me help you.

402
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,350
Thanks. I...

403
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,990
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

404
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,110
Aah!

405
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,790
Aah!

406
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,870
Do you mind?

407
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,310
- Aah!
- Aah!

408
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,750
Look how big she's getting.

409
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,750
Uh! Dante?

410
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,070
You can see me?

411
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,270
Wait! What's going on?

412
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,710
Dante! Dante!

413
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,750
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

414
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,870
Miguel?

415
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,430
- Miguel?
- Miguel?

416
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,030
Y-you're here!

417
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,030
Here here.

418
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,230
And you can see us?

419
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,910
Our Miguelitititito!

420
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,310
Remind me how I know you?

421
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,750
We're your family, mijo.

422
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,630
Tía Rosita?

423
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,870
Si.

424
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,670
PapáJulio?

425
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,870
Hola!

426
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,030
Tía Vic...toria?

427
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,270
He doesn't seem
entirely dead.

428
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,710
He's not quite alive, either.

429
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,190
We need MamáImelda.

430
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,670
She'll know how to fix this.

431
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,830
Oye!

432
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,230
It's MamáImelda!

433
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,590
She couldn't cross over!

434
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,390
She's stuck!

435
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,830
On the other side!

436
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,270
Tío Oscar?

437
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,670
Tío Felipe?

438
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,870
Oh, hey, Miguel.

439
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,150
I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.

440
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,910
But if MamáImelda
can't come to us...

441
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,630
Then we are going to her!

442
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,790
- Whoa!
- Vámonos!

443
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,190
Whoa.

444
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,750
Come on, Miguel, it's-it's okay.

445
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,110
Dante?

446
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,310
Dante!

447
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,390
Dante, wait up!

448
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,190
You've gotta stay with me, boy.

449
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,030
You don't know...

450
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,950
where...

451
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,270
This isn't a dream, then.

452
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,070
You're all really out there.

453
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,150
You thought we weren't?

454
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,350
Oh, I don't know.

455
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,590
I thought it might have been
one of those made-up things...

456
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,190
that adults tell kids, like...

457
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,830
vitamins.

458
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,070
Miguel, vitamins
are a real thing.

459
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,870
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

460
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,750
Hunh!

461
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,270
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...

462
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,030
Ay, Santa Ma...

463
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,830
Are those?

464
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,430
Alebrijes!

465
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,350
- But those are...
- Real alebrijes.

466
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,990
Spirit creatures.

467
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,550
They guide souls
on their journey.

468
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,110
Watch your step,
they make cacitas everywhere.

469
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,990
<i>Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead.</i>

470
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,630
<i>Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.</i>

471
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,870
Welcome back.

472
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,070
Anything to declare?

473
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,590
Some churros, from my family.

474
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,790
How wonderful!

475
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,150
<i>If you're experiencing
travel issues...</i>

476
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,310
<i>Agents at the Department of
Family Reunion</i>

477
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,070
<i>are available to assist you.</i>

478
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,630
Next family, please.

479
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,870
Oh, your photos are
in your son's ofrenda.

480
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,870
Have a great visit.

481
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,990
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

482
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,950
<i>And remember to return
before sunrise.</i>

483
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,150
<i>Enjoy your visit!</i>

484
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,310
Next?

485
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,190
Your photo's on your
dentist's ofrenda.

486
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,590
Enjoy your visit.

487
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,550
Grashiash.

488
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,750
Next?

489
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,710
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.

490
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,110
Shall we skip the scanner?

491
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,550
I'm on so many ofrendas

492
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,110
it will just overwhelm your
blinky thingy.

493
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,350
Whoa, shoot.

494
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,390
Looks like no one
put up your photo...

495
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,790
Frida?

496
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,270
Okay, when I said
I was Frida, just now...

497
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,070
That.

498
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,990
That was a lie.

499
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,910
And I apologize for doing that.

500
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,870
No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.

501
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,750
You know what?

502
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,550
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

503
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,110
Haha!

504
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,870
Almost... there...

505
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,990
Just a little... further...

506
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,510
Ugh.

507
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,510
Upsy daisy.

508
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,630
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?

509
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,670
Dumb flower bridge!

510
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,030
Aw, I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

511
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,830
Next?

512
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,550
Oh, come mijo, it's our turn.

513
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,110
Welcome back, amigo.

514
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,310
Anything to declare?

515
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,110
A-as a matter of fact...

516
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,310
Yes.

517
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,230
Hola.

518
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,830
<i>Paging Marta Gonzalez Ramos...</i>

519
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,230
<i>Marta Gonzalez Ramos...</i>

520
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,590
<i>Please report to level seven.</i>

521
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,430
Whoa.

522
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,230
I miss my nose.

523
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,990
Come on, help us out, amigo.

524
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,710
We gotta get to a
dozen ofrendas tonight.

525
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,430
We are not visiting
your ex-wife, Stanley,

526
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,510
por Día de Muertos.

527
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,950
I demand to speak to the
person in charge.

528
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,630
I'm sorry, señora, it says here

529
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,910
no one put up your photo.

530
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:27,070
My family always, always
put my photo up in the ofrenda

531
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,030
That devil box tells you
nothing but lies.

532
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,670
MamáImelda?

533
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,390
Oh, mi familia.

534
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,270
They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.

535
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,590
Tell this woman and her
devil box

536
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,950
that my photo is in the ofrenda.

537
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,230
Well, w-we never
made it to the ofrenda.

538
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,270
What?

539
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,830
We ran into a...

540
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,590
um...

541
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,710
Hunh! Miguel?

542
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,590
MamáImelda.

543
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,990
What is going on?

544
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,350
You the Rivera family?

545
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,390
Well, you're cursed.

546
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,390
What?

547
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,710
Día de los Muertos
is a night to give to the dead.

548
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,190
You stole from the dead.

549
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,950
But I wasn't sealing the guitar.

550
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,910
Guitar?

551
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,070
It was my
great-great-grandfather's.

552
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,230
He would have
wanted me to have it.

553
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,310
Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak
of that musician.

554
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,270
He is dead to this family.

555
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,030
Uh, you're all dead.

556
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,950
Achoo!

557
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,630
I am sorry, uh,
who's alebrije is that?

558
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,590
That's Dante.

559
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,750
He sure doesn't look
like an alebrije.

560
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,310
He just looks like
a plain old dog.

561
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,590
Or a sausage someone
dropped in a barbershop.

562
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,870
Whatever he is, I am-
achoo!

563
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,190
terribly allergic.

564
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,990
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

565
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,430
And I don't have a nose
and yet here we are.

566
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,590
Achoo!

567
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,190
But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.

568
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,750
Oh...

569
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,710
You took my photo
off the ofrenda?

570
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,830
It was an accident.

571
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,110
How do we send him back?

572
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,270
Well, since it's a family matter...

573
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,710
The way to undo a family curse is

574
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,470
to get your family's blessing.

575
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,350
That's it?

576
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,670
Get your family's blessing

577
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,270
and everything should
go back to normal.

578
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,270
But you've gotta do it by sunrise.

579
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,750
What happens at sunrise?

580
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,670
Híjole, your hand!

581
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,510
Huh!

582
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,470
Whoa, Miguel.
Can't have you fainting on us.

583
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,190
But not to worry.

584
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,230
Your family is here.

585
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,030
You can get your
blessing right now.

586
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,230
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.

587
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,390
Aha!

588
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,630
Perdón, señora.

589
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,510
Oh.

590
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,230
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

591
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,030
Miguel.

592
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,990
Nailed it.

593
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,390
Now say,
"I give you my blessing."

594
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,190
I give you my blessing.

595
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,670
I give you my blessing
to go home...

596
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,190
To put my photo back
on the ofrenda...

597
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,310
And to never play music again.

598
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,070
What? She can't do that!

599
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,390
Well, technically, she can add
any condition she wants.

600
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,190
Fine.

601
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,270
Then you
hand the petal to Miguel.

602
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,790
Ha!

603
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,790
No skeletons.

604
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,710
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

605
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,070
Two seconds and you
already break your promise.

606
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,910
This isn't fair, it's my life.

607
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,510
You already had yours.

608
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,750
PapáJulio,
I ask for your blessing.

609
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,630
Tía Rosita?

610
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,190
Oscar?

611
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,030
Felipe?

612
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,190
Tía Victoria?

613
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,910
Don't make this hard, mijo.

614
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,630
You go home my way,
or no way.

615
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,270
You really hate music
that much?

616
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,190
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

617
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,830
The same path he did.

618
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,950
He's family.

619
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,430
Listen to your MamáImelda.

620
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,390
She's just looking out for you.

621
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,870
Be reasonable.

622
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,830
Con permiso,
I need to visit the rest room.

623
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,990
Be right back.

624
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,910
Ah, should we tell him

625
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,070
there are no restrooms
in the Land of the Dead?

626
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,590
Vámonos.

627
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,750
We got a family looking
for a living boy.

628
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,710
I wanna be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

629
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,590
We gotta find my
great-great-grandpa.

630
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,670
Hold it, muchaco.

631
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,830
Huh!

632
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,270
I found that little boy!

633
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,230
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.

634
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,870
Excuse me.

635
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,590
Oh.

636
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,470
Dante.

637
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,030
Disturbing the peace.

638
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,430
Fleeing an officer.

639
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,190
Falsifying a unibrow.

640
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,270
That's illegal?

641
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,590
Very illegal.

642
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,750
You need to clean up
your act, amigo.

643
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,750
Amigo?

644
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,510
Oh, that's-that's so nice
to hear you say that because

645
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,510
I have just had a really
hard Día de Muertos

646
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,510
and I could really use
an amigo right now.

647
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,350
And amigos, they help
their amigos.

648
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,830
Listen, you get me across
that bridge tonight...

649
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,670
and I'll make it
worth your while.

650
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,950
You like de la Cruz?

651
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,150
He and I go way back.

652
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,430
I can get you front row seats
to his sunrise spectacular show.

653
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,750
I-I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

654
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,310
You just gotta let me
cross that bridge.

655
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,590
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

656
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,510
But my shift's almost up and...

657
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,430
I wanna visit my living family.

658
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,990
So I'm letting you off
with a warning.

659
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,830
Can I at least
get my costume back?

660
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,310
Uh... no.

661
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,150
Ser maldito.

662
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,270
Hey.

663
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,550
Hey!

664
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,950
You really know de la Cruz?

665
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,470
Who wants to... ah! Ay!
You're alive!

666
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,870
Yeah, I'm alive.

667
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,950
And I want to get back to
the Land of the Living...

668
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,190
I need de la Cruz' blessing.

669
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,670
That's weirdly specific.

670
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,310
He's my great-great-grandfather.

671
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,990
He's your gr-gr-gr-
what?

672
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,790
Ew.

673
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,670
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

674
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,870
Wait, wait.

675
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,190
Hunh!

676
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,910
Wait. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait

677
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,550
Wait, uh, wait,

678
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,870
Wait, uh, wait, wait,

679
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,150
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait,

680
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,510
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait,

681
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:56,870
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

682
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,190
Wait, uh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

683
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,590
Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

684
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,350
You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...

685
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,230
Niño, niño, I can help you.

686
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,070
You can help me.
We can help each other.

687
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,830
But most importantly,
you can help me.

688
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,830
- Miguel!
- Huh!

689
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,710
- I'm Héctor.
- That's nice.

690
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,910
Esperame, chamaco!

691
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,830
Ay! He is going
to get himself killed!

692
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,670
I need my spirit guide...

693
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,910
Pepita.

694
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,590
Who has that petal
Miguel touched?

695
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,670
Here... n-nice alebrije.

696
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,470
Hey, hey, hold still.

697
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,950
Look up, look up.
A ver, a ver.

698
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,430
Look up, up, up!

699
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,190
Okay.

700
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,870
Eh. Ta-da!

701
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,350
Dead as a doorknob.

702
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,390
So listen, Miguel.
This place runs on memories.

703
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,670
When you're well remembered,
people put up your photo...

704
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,070
and you get to cross the bridge

705
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,230
and visit the living on
Día de Muertos.

706
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,390
Unless you're me.

707
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,710
You don't get to cross over?

708
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,350
No one's ever put up my picture.

709
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,070
But you can change that!

710
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,670
This is you?

711
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,070
Eh, Muy guapo, eh?

712
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,190
So, you get me to my
great-great-grandpa...

713
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,670
Then I put up your photo
when I get home?

714
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,110
Such a smart boy!

715
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,870
Yes! Great idea, yes!

716
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,510
One hiccup, de la Cruz
is a tough guy to get to...

717
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,110
and I need to cross that
bridge soon. Like tonight.

718
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,910
So, you got any other
family here, you know?

719
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,230
Someone a bit more, eh,
accessible?

720
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,550
Um... nope.

721
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,110
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.

722
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,630
You gotta have
some other family.

723
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,070
Only de la Cruz.

724
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,150
If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

725
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,510
Ugh. Okay, okay, kid.
Fine, fine.

726
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,310
I'll get you to your
great-great-grandpa.

727
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,230
It's not gonna be easy,
you know.

728
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,870
You know, he's a-
he's a busy man.

729
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,550
Wait, what are you doing?

730
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,910
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.

731
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,550
No. Skeletons don't
walk like that.

732
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,630
It's how you walk.

733
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,830
No, I don't.

734
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,430
Stop it!

735
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,710
Whoa!

736
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,550
Ernesto de la Cruz'
Sunrise Spectacular?

737
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,550
Que padre?

738
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,830
Wuacch, every year,
your great-great-grandpa

739
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,630
puts on that dumb show
to mark the end of Día de Muertos.

740
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,150
A-a-and you can get us in!

741
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,070
I'm...

742
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,910
Hey, you said you had
front-row tickets!

743
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,710
That...

744
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,590
that was a lie.

745
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,070
I apologize for that.

746
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,150
Cool off, chamaco, come on.
I'll get you to him.

747
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,070
How?

748
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,390
'Cause I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

749
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,430
Ugh.

750
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,710
You better have
my dress, Héctor.

751
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,150
Hola, Ceci!

752
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,510
Ay!

753
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,950
Hola.

754
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,790
Cezi!

755
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,870
I lost the dress.

756
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,350
Ay, diosa Mia!

757
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,510
I've got to dress 40 dancers
by sunrise.

758
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,870
- And thanks to you...
- Cezi, Cezi...

759
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,990
- I'm one Frida short
- Cezi...

760
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,230
of an opening number.
- Dante.

761
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,950
Dante!

762
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,390
We shouldn't be in here.

763
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,870
Dante! Ven acá!

764
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,470
You!
How did you get in here?

765
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,550
I-I just followed my...

766
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,430
Hunh! Oh, the mighty Xolo dog!

767
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,870
Guider of wandering spirits.

768
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,070
And whose spirit
have you guided to me?

769
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,510
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

770
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,030
Uh-uh-uh! The alebrijes of this
world can take many forms.

771
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,910
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

772
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,430
Or maybe he's just a dog.

773
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,510
Come! I need your eyes.

774
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,070
Your are the audience.

775
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,310
Darkness!

776
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,430
And from the darkness...

777
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,630
A giant papaya!

778
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,990
Dancers emerge from the papaya.

779
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,670
And the dancers...

780
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,150
Are all me!

781
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,990
And they go to drink
from the milk of their mother.

782
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,830
Who is a cactus.
But who is also me!

783
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,070
And her milk is not milk...

784
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,790
but tears.

785
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,230
Is it too obvious?

786
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,350
I think it's just the
right amount of obvious.

787
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,270
It could use some music.

788
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,710
Oh, what if you did like...

789
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,230
Tun-tun-tun-tun-tun?

790
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,390
Oh, and then it could go...

791
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,230
Darala-dalala-dalala-dalala
Whenk?

792
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,830
And what if everything was on fire?

793
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,430
Yes! Fire everywhere!

794
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,870
Inspired.

795
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,590
You. You have
the spirit of an artist.

796
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,350
The dancers exit. The music fades.
The lights go out.

797
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,470
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage.

798
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,030
Huh?

799
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,870
He does a couple of songs.
The sun rises. Everyone cheers.

800
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,870
Excuse me, where's
the real de la Cruz?

801
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,670
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals.

802
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,670
He's too busy hosting that
fancy party at the top of his tower.

803
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,150
Chamaco, you can't
run off on me like that.

804
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,910
Come on, stop pestering
the celebrities.

805
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,030
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here.

806
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,550
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

807
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,270
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

808
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,910
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

809
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,030
He's your great-great-grandpa.
How come he didn't invite you?

810
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,150
Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?

811
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,030
Sh-it's the hot ticket!

812
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,670
But if you're not on the guest list,
you're never gettin' in,

813
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,910
Chorizo.

814
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,590
Hey, it's Chorizo!

815
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,310
Ah-ha, very funny, guys.
Very funny.

816
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,510
Chorizo?

817
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,350
Oh, this guy's famous.

818
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,390
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.

819
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,030
I-I don't wanna talk about it.

820
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,630
He choked on some chorizo!

821
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,310
I didn't choke, okay?
I got food poisoning

822
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,670
which is a big difference.

823
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,230
This is why I don't like musicians.

824
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,070
Bunch of self-important jerks!

825
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,550
Hey, I'm a musician.

826
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,790
- You are?
- Well...

827
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,670
If you really wanna get to Ernesto...

828
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,670
there is that music competition
at the Plaza de la Cruz.

829
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,390
Winner gets to play at his party.

830
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,750
No, no, no, Chamaco!
You are loco if you think...

831
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,430
I need to get my great-great-
grandfather's blessing.

832
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,590
You know where
I can get a guitar?

833
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,750
Ay... I know a guy.

834
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,750
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

835
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,310
A footprint!

836
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,790
It's a Rivera boot.

837
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,510
- Size seven!
- And a half.

838
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,710
- Pronated.
- Miguel.

839
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,550
Why the heck would you
wanna be a musician?

840
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,590
My great-great-grandfather's
a musician.

841
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,750
Who spent his life performing like
a monkey for complete strangers?

842
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,830
Blech! No, no, thank you, no.

843
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,590
What do you know?

844
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,070
So, how far is this guitar, anyway?

845
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,230
We're almost there.

846
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,430
Keep up, chamaco, come on!

847
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,510
Cousin Héctor!

848
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,070
Hey! These guys!

849
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,030
Héctor!

850
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,430
Hey, tío, qué onda?

851
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,030
These people are all you family?

852
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,790
Eh... yeah, in a way.

853
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,550
We're all the ones with
no photos or ofrendas.

854
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,190
No family to go home to.

855
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,470
Nearly forgotten, you know?

856
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,710
So we all call each other
"cousin" or "tío" or-or whatever.

857
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,750
- Héctor!
- Tía Chelos! Hey!

858
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,950
Muchas gracias.

859
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,270
Save some for me.

860
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,670
Is Chicharrón around?

861
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,070
In the bungalow. I don't know if
he's in the mood for visitors.

862
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,350
Ah, who doesn't like a
visit from cousin Héctor?

863
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,350
Huh!

864
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,590
Buenas noches, Chicharrón.

865
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,950
I don't want to see your
stupid face, Héctor.

866
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,230
Come on, its Día de Muertos.

867
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,510
I brought you a little offering.

868
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,870
Get outta here!

869
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,670
I would Chich, but the thing is...

870
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,790
me and my friend Miguel...

871
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,710
we really need to
borrow your guitar.

872
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,190
- My guitar?
- Yes.

873
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,590
My prized, beloved guitar?

874
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,230
I promise we'll bring it right back.

875
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,430
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?

876
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,390
Eh...

877
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,790
- Or my mini fridge?
- Oh, you see...

878
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,950
Or my good napkins,
my lasso, my femur?!

879
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,030
No, not like those things.

880
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,350
Where's my femur, you...

881
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,430
Oh, oh.

882
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,990
You okay, amigo?

883
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,550
I'm fading, Héctor.

884
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,790
I can feel it.

885
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,630
I couldn't even play that
thing if I wanted to.

886
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,710
You, play me something.

887
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,270
Oh, you know I don't
play anymore, Chich.

888
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,870
The guitar's for the kid.

889
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,310
You want it?

890
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,670
You've got to earn it.

891
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,710
Ay, only for you, amigo.

892
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,430
Any requests?

893
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,270
You know my favorite, Héctor.

00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,070

Gracias.

908
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,750
Wait, what happened?

909
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,790
He's been forgotten.

910
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,710
When there's no one left in the
living world who remembers you...

911
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,950
you disappear from this world.

912
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:39,230
We call it "The Final Death."

913
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,510
W-where did he go?

914
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,830
No one knows.

915
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,150
But I've met him.

916
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,270
I could remember him...
when I go back.

917
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,630
No, it doesn't work
like that, chamaco.

918
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,430
Our memories...

919
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:53,830
They have to be passed down
by those who knew us in life.

920
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,550
In the stories
they tell about us.

921
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:59,910
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Chich's stories.

922
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,790
Hey, it happens to
everyone eventually.

923
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,150
Come on, de la Cruzito,
you've got a contest to win.

924
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,470
You told me you hated musicians.

925
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,990
You never said you were one.

926
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,070
How do you think I knew
your great-great-grandpa?

927
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:25,510
We used to play music together.

928
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:26,990
Taught him everything he knows.

929
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,310
No manches.

930
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,390
You played with
Ernesto de la Cruz?

931
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,030
The greatest musician
of all time?

932
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,990
Oh! Oh, you're funny.

933
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,950
Greatest eyebrows
of all time, maybe.

934
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,870
But his music, eh, not so much.

935
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,950
You don't know what
you're talking about.

936
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:45,030
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz.

937
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,110
Showtime, chamaco.

938
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,310
Querer lo, t-shirts, bobbleheads.

939
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,830
Bienvenidos a todos!

940
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,310
Ow! ha-hah-ay!

941
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,710
Who's ready for some música?

942
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,990
It's a Battle of
the Bands, amigos.

943
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,910
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself...

944
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,190
Ernesto de la Cruz
on his fiesta tonight!

945
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,230
That's our ticket, muchacho.

946
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,990
Let the competition begin!

947
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,430
So, what's the plan?
W-what are you gonna play?

948
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,270
Definitely "Remember Me."

949
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,670
No, not that one. No.

950
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,150
Come on, it's the
most popular song.

951
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,230
Ah, it's too popular.

952
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,430
♪ Remember me
though I have to travel far ♪

953
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:54,510
♪ Remember... ♪

954
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,830
♪ Don't let it make you cry ♪

955
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,510
Um, what about...
Poco Loco?

956
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,470
Epa! Now, that's a song.

957
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,150
De la Cruzito!
You're on standby.

958
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,350
Los Chachalacos,
you're up next.

959
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,550
Los Chachalacos!

960
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,670
You always this nervous
before a performance?

961
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,830
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

962
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,670
What? You said
you were a musician!

963
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,790
I am! I mean, I-I will be.

964
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,030
- Ay!
- Once I win.

965
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,230
That's your plan?

966
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,990
No, no, no, no.
You have to win, Miguel.

967
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,670
Your life literally
depends on you winning.

968
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,110
And you've never
done this before?

969
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,510
- I'll go up.
- Uh, n-no!

970
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,070
- I need to do this.
- Why?

971
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,230
If I can't go out there
and play one song...

972
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,990
how can I call myself
a musician?

973
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:45,990
What does that matter?

974
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,710
'Cause I don't just want
to get de la Cruz' blessing.

975
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,590
I need to prove that...

976
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,670
that I'm worthy of it.

977
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:55,270
Oh. Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment.

978
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,670
At such a bad time!

979
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,070
Okay! Okay, okay. Okay.

980
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:04,030
Okay, you wanna perform?
Then you've got to perform!

981
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,390
First, you have to loosen up.

982
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:06,710
Shake off those nerves.

983
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,110
Now, give me your best grito.

984
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,390
My best grito?

985
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,870
Come on, yell. Belt it out.

986
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,590
Haooeyy-he-he-hey!

987
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:19,790
Oh, it feels good.

988
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,550
Okay, now, now, now you.

989
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,390
A-a-eh.

990
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,590
Aeh...

991
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:25,350
Ay...

992
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,070
Ay...ay...

993
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:26,750
Ay...ay...ay.

994
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,190
Oh, come on, kid.

995
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:39,950
De la Cruzito!
You're on now!

996
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,230
Miguel, look at me.
Hey, hey, look at me.

997
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:43,110
Come on, let's go!

998
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:43,950
You can do this.

999
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,870
Grab their attention
and don't let it go!

1000
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:46,550
Héctor...

1001
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,070
Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.

1002
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,310
De la Cruzito!

1003
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,990
Arriba-Ba! Hey!

1004
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,030
Eh...

1005
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,950
What's he doing?
Why isn't he playing?

1006
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,430
Bring back the singing dog!

1007
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,510

1008
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:15,230

I have a emergency announcement.

1050
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:23,270
Please be on the look out
for a living boy.

1051
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,350
Answers to the name of Miguel.

1052
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,230
Earlier tonight, he ran away
from his family.

1053
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:31,510
They just want to send him
back to the Land of the Living.

1054
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,830
Wait, wait, wait.

1055
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,550
You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

1056
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,150
The only person who
could send you home.

1057
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,350
I do have other family, but...

1058
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:39,310
You could have taken my
photo back this whole time?

1059
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,190
But they hate music.
I need a musician's blessing.

1060
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,870
- You lied to me!
- Oh, you're one to talk.

1061
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,790
Look at me, I'm being
forgotten, Miguel.

1062
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,470
I don't even know if I'm
gonna last the night.

1063
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,950
I'm not gonna miss my one
chance to cross that bridge

1064
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,910
'cause you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

1065
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,910
- It's not stupid.
- I'm taking you to your family.

1066
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,870
- Let go of me.
- You'll thank me later.

1067
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:00,110
You don't wanna help me.
You only care about yourself.

1068
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,510
Keep your dumb photo.
- No!

1069
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,070
No, no, no!
- Stay away from me!

1070
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:05,230
No!

1071
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,790
Hey, chamaco?

1072
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,310
Where did you go?

1073
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,230
Chamaco?

1074
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,830
Sorry!

1075
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,990
Come back.

1076
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,590
Dante, cállate.

1077
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,230
Don't Dante, stop it.

1078
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,830
He can't help me.

1079
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,750
Dante, stop.

1080
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:33,270
Stop it.

1081
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,470
Leave me alone!

1082
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,030
You're not a spirit guide,
you're just a dumb dog.

1083
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,590
Now get outta here!

1084
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:39,910
It's him!

1085
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,190
It's that living boy!

1086
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,390
I've heard about him, look!

1087
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,550
He's alive.

1088
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,070
Huah!

1089
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,270
Aah!

1090
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,630
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

1091
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,110
I am giving you my blessing,
and you are going home.

1092
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,870
I don't want your blessing.

1093
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,070
Miguel! Stop!

1094
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:06,830
Come back!

1095
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:09,990
Miguel!

1096
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,950
I am trying to save your life.

1097
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,390
You're ruining my life.

1098
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,310
What?

1099
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:20,150
Music's the only thing
that makes me happy.

1100
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,950
A-and you... you wanna
take that away.

1101
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,510
You'll never understand.

me cueste, Llorona ♪

1103
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:37,070

1104
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,430
I-I thought you hated music.

1105
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:42,190
Oh, I loved it.

1106
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,550
I remember that feeling.

1107
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:48,030
When my husband would play,
and I would sing.

1108
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,630
And nothing else mattered.

1109
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,550
But when we had Coco...

1110
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:58,510
suddenly, there was something in my
life that mattered more than music.

1111
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,150
I wanted to put down rules.

1112
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,870
He wanted to play for the world.

1113
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:09,470
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

1114
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,750
Now, <i>you</i> must make a choice.

1115
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,630
But I don't wanna pick sides.

1116
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,630
Why can't you be on my side?

1117
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,830
That's what family's
supposed to do.

1118
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,830
Support you.

1119
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,150
But you never will.

1120
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,470
Have a good time.

1121
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,790
Oh, how exciting!

1122
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,910
Oh, El Santo!

1123
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,990
I-I-I'm a big fan.

1124
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,790
You mind if I?

1125
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:56,950
Gracias, señor.

1126
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,470
Invitation?

1127
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:04,630
It's okay, I'm Ernesto's
great-great-grandson.

1128
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:07,750
Heh.

1129
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,550
Disculpe, señores.

1130
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,430
Hey, hey, guys, it's Poco Loco!

1131
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,070
You were on fire tonight.

1132
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,270
You too!

1133
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,550
Hey, musician to musician,
I need a favor.

1134
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:30,590
Oh, the competition winners.
Congratulations, chicos.

1135
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,110
Thanks guys.

1136
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:53,270
Oh.

1137
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:56,630
- Hey, enjoy the party, little músico.
- Gracias.

1138
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,110
Ooh.

1139
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,270
Look, it's Ernesto.

1140
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,190
De la Cruz.

<i>But what can we do?
It is hopeless.</i>

1151
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,230
<i>You must have faith, sister.</i>

1152
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,510
<i>Oh, but Padre,
he will never listen.</i>

1153
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:12,670
<i>He will listen to music.</i>

Huah!

1171
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,230
It-it's you.

1172
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:27,750
Y-you are that boy.

1173
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:29,670
The one who came from
the Land of the Living.

1174
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,950
You... know about me?

1175
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,350
You're all anyone
has been talking about.

1176
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:36,670
Why have you come here?

1177
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,150
I'm Miguel.

1178
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:41,670
Your g-great-great-grandson.

1179
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,550
I have a great-great-grandson?

1180
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:45,710
I need your blessing.

1181
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:49,430
So I can go back home and
be a musician just like you.

1182
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,790
The rest of our family...

1183
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,790
they wouldn't listen.

1184
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,710
But I... I hoped you would.

1185
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:01,190
My boy, with a talent like yours...

1186
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:03,310
how could I not listen?

1187
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:08,230
Haha! I have a
great-great-grandson!

1188
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:15,870
Look, it's Frida!

1189
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,910
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.

1190
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,550
It is an honor, señora.

1191
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:20,950
Gracias.

1192
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:26,230
Hey, Negrete, Infante.

1193
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:28,390
Have you met my
great-great-grandson?

1194
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,550
My great-great-grandson!

1195
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:32,870
He is alive and a musician, to boot.

1196
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,910
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

1197
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,070
No dimple!

1198
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,550
To our friendship. Haha!

1199
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:41,590
I'd move heaven and earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud!

1200
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,710
Poison!

1201
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:46,190
You know, I did all my own stunts.

1202
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:49,710
♪ Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me ♪

1203
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:55,670
All of this came from my amazing
fans in the Land of the Living.

1204
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:59,430
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with.

1205
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:01,790
Hey, what's wrong?

1206
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,710
Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

1207
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:05,950
N-no, It's all great.

1208
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:08,230
- But?
- It's just...

1209
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:11,310
I've been looking up
to you my whole life.

1210
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,910
You're the guy
who actually did it.

1211
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:17,710
But did you ever regret it?

1212
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,270
Choosing music
over everything else?

1213
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:25,990
It was hard saying
goodbye to my hometown.

1214
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,790
Heading off on my own.

1215
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,990
Leaving your family?

1216
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,510
Si.

1217
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,590
But I could not have
done it differently.

1218
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,670
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.

1219
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:40,230
And you, my great-great-grandson...

1220
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,590
are meant to be a musician.

1221
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,110
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.

1222
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,230
We cannot belong to one family.

1223
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:51,590
The world is our family!

1224
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,310
Ooh-hoo! Ooh!
The fireworks have begun!

1225
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:09,270
Soon, the party will move across
town for my sunrise spectacular.

1226
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:12,350
Hunh! Miguel, you must
come to the show!

1227
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,470
You will be my guest of honor.

1228
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,030
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.

1229
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:20,550
I can't.

1230
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,950
I have to get home
<i>before</i> sunrise.

1231
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:25,430
Oy! I really do need to get you home.

1232
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,470
It has been an honor.

1233
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,950
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

1234
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:36,030
I hope you die very soon.

1235
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:39,950
You know what I mean.

1236
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,150
Miguel...

1237
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:44,950
I give you my blessing.

1238
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:46,830
We had a deal, chamaco.

1239
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,310
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

1240
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,910
Oh, Frida. I thought
you couldn't make it.

1241
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:54,790
You said you'd take back my photo.

1242
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,390
You promised, Miguel.

1243
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,030
You know this uh, man?

1244
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,670
I just met him tonight.

1245
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,630
He told me he knew you.

1246
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,950
H...Héctor?

1247
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,310
Please, Miguel.

1248
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,910
Put my photo up.

1249
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:12,870
My friend. You're...
you're being forgotten.

1250
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:13,910
And whose fault is that?

1251
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:15,870
- Héctor, please.
- Those were my songs you took.

1252
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:17,430
My songs that made you famous.

1253
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,310
- What?
- If I'm being forgotten...

1254
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:21,270
It's because you never told anyone
that I wrote them.

1255
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,470
That's crazy. De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.

1256
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:26,070
You wanna tell him?
Or should I?

1257
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,590
Héctor, I never meant to take credit.

1258
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:30,910
We made a great team, but...

1259
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:34,830
you died, and... I-I only sang
your songs because

1260
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:37,030
I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.

1261
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:38,670
Oh, how generous!

1262
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,630
You really did play together.

1263
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:43,150
Look, I don't want to fight about it.

1264
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,990
I just want you to make it right.

1265
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:46,910
Miguel can put my photo up.

1266
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,070
- Héctor.
- And I can cross over the bridge.

1267
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:50,750
I could see my girl.

1268
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,310
Ernesto.

1269
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,110
Remember the night I left?

1270
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,470
That was a long time ago.

1271
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,750
We drank together.

1272
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:59,710
And you told me you would move
heaven and earth for your amigo.

1273
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:02,470
Well, I'm asking you to now.

1274
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:04,190
Heaven and earth?

1275
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,390
Like in the movie?

1276
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,150
What?

1277
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,750
That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1278
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:09,950
In the de la Cruz movie,
"El Camino a Casa."

1279
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,510
I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.

1280
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,430
No, it's in there.

1281
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:14,630
Look!

1282
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:17,030
<i>This calls for a toast.</i>

1283
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:18,630
<i>To our friendship! Haha!</i>

1284
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,110
<i>I would move heaven
and earth for you, mi amigo.</i>

1285
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:23,910
But in the movie, Don Hidalgo
poisons the drink.

1286
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:25,630
<i>Salud.</i>

1287
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:27,310
<i>Poison!</i>

1288
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,910
That night, Ernesto.

1289
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,950
The night I left.

1290
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,470
<i>We've been performing
on the road for months.</i>

1291
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:38,550
<i>I got homesick
and I packed up my songs.</i>

1292
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:40,550
You wanna give up now?

1293
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:42,630
When we're this close
to reaching our dream?

1294
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:44,590
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

1295
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:46,670
I can't do this
without your songs, Héctor.

1296
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,190
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1297
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:50,470
Hate me if you want.
But my mind is made up.

1298
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:55,590
Oh, I could never hate you.

1299
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:59,830
If you must go, then I'm...
I'm sending you off with a toast.

1300
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,110
To our friendship.

1301
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:07,110
I would move heaven
and earth for you, mi amigo.

1302
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,550
Salud!

1303
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,630
<i>You walked me to the train station.</i>

1304
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:17,070
<i>But I felt a pain in my stomach.</i>

1305
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:19,190
<i>I thought it must have
been something I ate.</i>

1306
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:21,190
<i>Perhaps it was that chorizo,
my friend.</i>

1307
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,870
<i>Or something I drank.</i>

1308
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:28,950
I woke up dead.

1309
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:31,590
You...

1310
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,150
poisoned me!

1311
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:35,950
You're confusing movies
with reality, Héctor.

1312
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:39,790
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

1313
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:43,350
I never thought that you might have...

1314
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:45,030
that you...

1315
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:49,350
How could you?

1316
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:50,110
Héctor!

1317
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:51,270
Security! Security!

1318
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:54,110
You took everything away from me!

1319
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:56,190
You rat!

1320
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:58,390
Have him taken care of.

1321
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,230
He's not well.

1322
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,390
I just wanted to move back home!

1323
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:04,270
No! No!

1324
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:07,110
I apologize.

1325
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,190
Where were we?

1326
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,350
You were going
to give me your blessing.

1327
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:13,670
Yes... ah... Si.

1328
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,790
Miguel...

1329
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:21,030
My reputation... it is...

1330
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:23,510
very important to me.

1331
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:25,710
I would hate to have you think...

1332
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,630
That you m-murdered Héctor
for his songs?

1333
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,590
You don't think that.

1334
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:33,990
Do you?

1335
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:38,630
I... No... Everyone knows you're the...
the good guy.

1336
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:48,110
PapáErnesto...
my blessing?

1337
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,910
Security?

1338
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:53,990
Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

1339
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,350
What?

1340
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:56,870
But I'm your family!

1341
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,910
And Héctor was my best friend.

1342
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:02,310
Success doesn't come
for free, Miguel.

1343
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:05,790
You have to be willing
to do whatever it takes to...

1344
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,190
seize your moment.

1345
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,310
I know you understand.

1346
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:12,230
No! No!

1347
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:15,510
Let go!

1348
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:17,070
No!

1349
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:18,670
Aah!

1350
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:39,670
Help!

1351
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:41,830
Can anyone hear me?

1352
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:44,470
I wanna go home!

1353
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,350
Huh?

1354
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:03,750
H-Héctor?

1355
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,750
- Kid?
- Oh, Héctor!

1356
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:07,670
You were right.

1357
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:09,510
I should have gone
back to my family.

1358
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:12,510
- Hey, hey, hey.
- They told me not to be like de la Cruz.

1359
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,550
- But I didn't listen.
- Hey, it's okay.

1360
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,830
But I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

1361
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:19,790
I didn't care if was on
the stupid ofrenda.

1362
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:23,190
It's okay.

1363
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,510
I told them I didn't care.

1364
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:30,070
- Huh! Oh!
- Héctor!

1365
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,830
Héctor?

1366
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:34,190
She's...

1367
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:36,070
forgetting me.

1368
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:37,390
Who?

1369
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,310
My daughter.

1370
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:45,150
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

1371
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:47,790
I just wanted to see her again.

1372
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,230
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

1373
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:54,350
I wish I could apologize.

1374
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:57,830
I wish I could tell her that her
Papáwas trying to come home.

1375
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,710
That he loved her so much.

1376
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,390
My Coco.

1377
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,190
Coco?

1378
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:23,950
Where?

1379
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:26,270
Where did you get this?

1380
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:28,710
That's my MamáCoco.

1381
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,710
That's my MamáImelda.

1382
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:32,630
Is that...

1383
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,670
You?

1384
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,150
We're...

1385
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,350
- family?
- Family?

1386
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:55,990
I always hoped I'd see her again.

1387
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:57,750
That she'd miss me.

1388
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,590
Maybe put up my photo.

1389
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,870
But it never happened.

1390
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:04,390
You know the worst part?

1391
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:07,510
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

1392
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:10,230
I thought at least one day,
I'd see her here.

1393
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:12,750
Give her the biggest hug.

1394
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:16,790
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

1395
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:19,710
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

1396
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:21,630
You disappear.

1397
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:23,310
From this one.

1398
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:25,550
You'll never get to see her.

1399
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:27,190
Ever again.

1400
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:31,350
You know...

1401
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:33,190
I wrote her a song once.

1402
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:35,510
We used to sing it every night.

1403
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,950
At the same time.

1404
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,670
No matter how far apart we were.

1405
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,230
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her.

1406
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:44,230
One...

1407
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:45,230
last...

1408
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:46,470

H-He stole your guitar.

1428
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,990
He stole your songs.

1429
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:56,550
You should be the one
the world remembers.

1430
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:57,750
Not de la Cruz.

1431
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,110
I didn't write "Remember Me"
for the world.

1432
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:02,190
I wrote it for Coco.

1433
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,350
I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a
great-great-grandpa.

1434
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:09,670
Are you kidding? A minute ago,
I thought I was related to a murderer.

1435
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,670
You're a total upgrade.

1436
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:13,710
My whole life...

1437
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:16,030
there's been something
that made me different.

1438
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:18,350
And I never knew
where it came from.

1439
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:20,190
But now, I know.

1440
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:21,870
It comes from you!

1441
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:24,190
I'm proud we're family.

1442
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:27,390
I'm proud to be his family!

1443
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:30,430
Rrrr-aayy!

1444
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,230
Haaa-ooei!

1445
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,230
Aaah-haha-ha-aayy!

1446
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,830
I'm proud to be
<i>his</i> family!

1447
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:39,110
Haooo-whoo-hoo!

1448
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:42,630
Ho-ha-ay!

1449
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:52,390
Dante?

1450
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:55,350
Dante!

1451
01:11:58,150 --> 01:11:59,550
It's Dante!

1452
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:05,550
Haha!

1453
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:11,590
Imelda!

1454
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,510
Héctor.

1455
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,230
You look good.

1456
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:27,070
Dante!

1457
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,590
You knew he was my
PapáHéctor the whole time!

1458
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:31,150
You are a real spirit guide.

1459
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:34,030
Who's a good spirit guide?
You are!

1460
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:45,670
Whoa!

1461
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,990
Haha!

1462
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:53,830
Dante!

1463
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,150
There they are!

1464
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:19,990
Miguelito! Miguelito!

1465
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:26,070
Gracias, Dios mio!

1466
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:41,910
Mijo, I was so worried.

1467
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,190
Thank goodness
we found you in time.

1468
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:46,390
And you.

1469
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:48,710
How many times
must I turn you away?

1470
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:49,710
Imelda...

1471
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:53,070
I want nothing to do with you.
Not in life, not in death.

1472
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:56,670
I spent decades protecting
my family from your mistakes.

1473
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:59,910
He spends five minutes with you,
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

1474
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:01,590
I wasn't in there 'cause of Héctor.

1475
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:03,510
He was in there 'cause of me.

1476
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:06,070
He was just trying to get me home.

1477
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:07,830
I didn't wanna listen.

1478
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,710
But he was right.

1479
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:12,310
Nothing is more
important than family.

1480
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:16,150
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

1481
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:18,190
And your conditions.

1482
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:20,750
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

1483
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,070
To get Héctor's photo.

1484
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:23,990
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.

1485
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,790
Héctor should be on our ofrenda.

1486
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:27,270
He's part of our family.

1487
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:28,710
He left this family.

1488
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,350
He tried to go home to you and Coco.

1489
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,310
But de la Cruz murdered him.

1490
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:34,870
It's true, Imelda.

1491
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:36,990
And so what if it's true?

1492
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:39,230
You leave me alone
with a child to raise,

1493
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:41,110
and I'm just supposed
to forgive you?

1494
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:42,430
Imelda, I...

1495
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,350
Héctor?

1496
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:45,550
Hunh!

1497
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,870
I'm running out of time.

1498
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,910
It's Coco.

1499
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:53,150
She's forgetting you.

1500
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:56,310
You don't have to forgive him.

1501
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,270
But we shouldn't forget him.

1502
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:04,030
I wanted to forget you.

1503
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:06,550
I wanted Coco
to forget you too, but...

1504
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:08,870
This is my fault.

1505
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:10,790
Not yours.

1506
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,990
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1507
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:19,510
Miguel...

1508
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:21,870
If we help you get his photo...

1509
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:23,430
you will return home.

1510
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:24,950
No more music.

1511
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:28,310
Family comes first.

1512
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:33,350
I... I can't forgive you.

1513
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,230
But I will help you.

1514
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:40,870
So how do we get to
de la Cruz?

1515
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:44,750
I might know a way.

1516
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:34,190
Good luck, muchacho.

1517
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,470
Gracias, Frida.

1518
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:41,150
Ah!

1519
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,430
Here, let me help you with...

1520
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:45,590
Don't touch me.

1521
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:47,590
Everyone clear on the plan?

1522
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:48,910
Find Héctor's photo.

1523
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:49,790
Give it to Miguel.

1524
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:50,790
Send Miguel home.

1525
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:51,990
Got your petals?

1526
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:55,030
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

1527
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:56,270
- Yes?
- Ah!

1528
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,030
Don't I know you?

1529
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:02,110
That's for murdering
the love of my life!

1530
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,430
- Who the?
- She's talking about me.

1531
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:05,870
I'm the love your your life?

1532
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:07,470
I don't know,
I'm still angry at you.

1533
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:08,990
Héctor? How did you...

1534
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:11,110
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson!

1535
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:13,350
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me.

1536
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:14,630
You!

1537
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:17,550
Wait. You're related to Héctor?

1538
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:18,950
The photo!

1539
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:21,830
Eh...

1540
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:23,870
After him!

1541
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:27,470
Security, ayuda.

1542
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,630
You said love of your life?

1543
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:30,990
I don't know what I said.

1544
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:32,630
That's what I heard.

1545
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:46,990
Places, señor.
You're on in 30 seconds.

1546
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:56,190
Miguel, I have it!

1547
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:05,550
Oh!

1548
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:12,550
Hurry, come on!

1549
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,350
Ladies and gentleman!

1550
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:22,150
The one. The only.
Ernesto de la Cruz!

1551
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,190
Get her off the stage!

1552
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:41,550
Sing!

1553
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:43,030
Sing!

You... still got it.

1580
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:34,990
Uh-h-hum...

1581
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:36,470
Oh!

1582
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:41,150
Miguel, I give you my blessing...

1583
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:43,830
To go home...

1584
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:46,430
To put up our photos...

1585
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:48,190
And to never...

1586
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:50,310
Never play music again.

1587
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:55,830
To never forget how much
your family loves you.

1588
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:59,710
You're going home.

1589
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,870
You're not going anywhere!

1590
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,590
Imelda!

1591
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:09,230
Stay back! Stay back!

1592
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:11,270
All of you, stay back!

1593
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:12,990
Not one more step.

1594
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:15,870
Dante!

1595
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:19,070
Ernesto, stop!

1596
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:21,590
Leave the boy alone.

1597
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,430
I've worked too hard, Héctor.

1598
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:25,550
Too hard to let him
destroy everything.

1599
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,390
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1600
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:29,030
He's a threat.

1601
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:33,150
You think I'd let him go back to the
Land of the Living with your photo?

1602
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:34,910
To keep your memory alive?

1603
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:36,510
- No.
- You're a coward!

1604
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:40,030
I am Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.

1605
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:41,950
Héctor's the real musician.

1606
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:44,670
You're just the guy who
murdered him and stole his songs.

1607
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:45,870
Murdered?

1608
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:48,270
I am the one who's
willing to do what it takes

1609
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:50,230
to seize my moment.

1610
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:52,190
Whatever it takes.

1611
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:54,030
Aah! Aah!

1612
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,430
No!

1613
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,590
- Miguel!
- Miguel!

1614
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:02,350
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

1615
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:38,070
Haha!

1616
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:40,190
Boo! Boo!

1617
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:42,430
Boo!

1618
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:45,630
Hahaha! Please, please,
mi familia!

1619
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:46,990
- Murderer!
- Get off the stage!

1620
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:49,870

Look!

01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:19,550
Nice kitty.

1626
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,590
Ah!

1627
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:24,910

1637
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:52,230
Good boy, Dante.

1638
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:53,590
Miguel!

1639
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,030
Oh!

1640
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,470
Héctor!

1641
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,750
The photo, I lost it.

1642
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:00,430
It's okay, mijo.

1643
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:01,750
It's...

1644
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,350
Héctor!

1645
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,030
Héctor?

1646
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:06,830
Coco.

1647
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:08,710
No, we can still find the photo.

1648
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,870
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1649
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:13,350
No, no, no.
I can't leave you.

1650
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,390
I promised I put your photo up.

1651
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:17,630
I promised you'd see Coco.

1652
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:20,070
We're both out of time, mijo.

1653
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:22,790
No! No!

1654
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:24,590
She can't forget you.

1655
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:26,670
I just wanted her to know...

1656
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:28,710
that I loved her.

1657
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:30,270
Héctor!

1658
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:32,630
You have our blessing, Miguel.

1659
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:35,150
No conditions.

1660
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:37,990
No, PapáHéctor. Please!

1661
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:42,910
No.

1662
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:45,350
Go home.

1663
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:48,310
I promise! I-I won't let
Coco forget you!

1664
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,910
There he is!

1665
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,550
Miguel! Stop!

1666
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:24,590
Where have you been?

1667
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:26,670
Ah! I need to see
MamáCoco, please!

1668
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:28,390
Huh! What are you doing with that?

1669
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:29,430
Give it to me!

1670
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:30,990
Miguel, stop.

1671
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:33,390
Miguel! Miguel?

1672
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:34,870
Miguel!

1673
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:36,470
MamáCoco?

1674
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:37,710
Can you hear me?

1675
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:39,070
It's Miguel.

1676
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:41,030
I-I saw your Papá!

1677
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:43,470
Remember? Papá?

1678
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:45,270
Please.

1679
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:46,990
If you forget him.

1680
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,430
He'll be gone.

1681
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:49,910
Forever.

1682
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:54,110
Here. This was his guitar, right?

1683
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:56,150
He used to play it to you?

1684
01:25:58,110 --> 01:26:00,070
See, there he is.

1685
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:04,510
Papá, remember? Papá?

1686
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:08,310
Miguel!

1687
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:11,390
MamáCoco, please.
Don't forget him.

1688
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:19,470
What are you doing
to that poor woman?

1689
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:20,550
It's okay, mother.

1690
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,830
What's gotten into you?

1691
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:29,870
I thought I lost you, Miguel.

1692
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:31,470
I'm sorry, Papá.

1693
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:33,030
We're all together now.

1694
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:35,070
That's what matters.

1695
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:36,630
Not all of us.

1696
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:38,430
It's okay, Mamita.

1697
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:42,270
Miguel, you apologize
to your MamáCoco.

1698
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:46,390

1699
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:53,230

Nothing, Mamá.

1724
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:21,750
Nothing at all.

01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:59,350

1731
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:19,950
Papáwas a musician.

1732
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:22,350
When I was a little girl...

1733
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:27,830
He and Mamáwould sing
such beautiful songs.

1734
