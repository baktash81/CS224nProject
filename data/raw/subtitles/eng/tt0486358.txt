<i>From the voice of Kansas City,
news radio.</i>

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,508
Sandra Day O'Connor,
the first woman ever deserved…

5
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:31,350
…on High Court has turned in
her letter of resignation…

6
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:33,806
…bring her to High
Court to an end.

7
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,300
Let's go to
the White House.

8
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:36,734
Good morning.

9
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,964
I directed my staff
to compile information…

10
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,488
… and recommend from my review,
potential nominees…

11
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:45,964
…who faithfully interpret the Constitution 
and laws of our country.

12
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,965
I believe as Christian citizens
of this country…

13
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:54,766
…we should be actively involved...

14
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:56,967
... in this historical moment.

15
00:00:57,268 --> 00:00:59,468
And if the churches
across this country …

16
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:01,719
…believers can come together
and take a stand…

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,370
… I think it's gonna have
a powerful, powerful impact…

18
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:05,971
… on this process.

19
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:13,472
We dare not sleep through
this poi???? decision…

20
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:18,473
… because frankly, futur generations
depend on us.

21
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:23,541
Pray urgently that
God's perfect will, will be done.

22
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,037
We are engaged today…

23
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:34,388
… in what they call:
culture war.

24
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,496
We did not start it…

25
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,060
… but, we, by his grace,
are going to end it?.

26
00:01:42,455 --> 00:01:44,262
And we should say:
"Yes…

27
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:48,071
… we want to reclaim America
for Christ "

28
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,526
Upon? this mean-spirited message,
us against them…

29
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,330
… and that's what the religious
right is doing…

30
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,503
…in the United States,
it is dividing this country.

31
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,141
- Well, we have Tyry…
- Yes.

32
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:28,810
… in Hillside, Illinois,
that he listens to on the WCPT.

33
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,509
What do you have in your mind?

34
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,683
I am Christian,
I am a Bible believing Christian.

35
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:36,610
Somehow, these guys
don't ji**? with the Christianity…

36
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:37,980
… in what I have learned.

37
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:42,055
I mean, there is authoritarianism
kind of way about them and…

38
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,540
… there is nothing generous?,
nothing compassion…

39
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:47,196
… for me, there is nothing
Christian bottom line?, I mean…

40
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,930
Yes. It is… It is…
It is upside down.

41
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,662
I mean… Yes, I've been-I've been raised
as a Christian all my life

42
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,857
I think
that's probably the thing…

43
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:57,236
… that upset me most
about what's happening.

44
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,158
None of this
really makes any sense for me.

45
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,777
So there is some new brand
of religion outhere…

46
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,193
… It's somehow
the things have changed…

47
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:07,779
… since Matthew…
uh, wrote… uh…

48
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,170
… wrote about the Jesus's sermon
on the mount…

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,820
… where Jesus told us
to be peacemakers.

50
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,441
And right now they…
Everything they do…

51
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,427
…they say, they do it
in name of God.

52
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:20,039
That we need to go
to war in name of God.

53
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:22,576
They are being told
George Bush, of all people?

54
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:25,569
… he is the Holy man
who has been anointed…

55
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,418
… with the job of… of…
creating a Christian society…

56
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:31,617
… not just in America,
but all over the world.

57
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:33,977
You and I know
that's false.

58
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,919
This is a tanglement? of politics
with religion.

59
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,946
What… what kind of lesson
is that for our children?

60
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,455
There has never been
a generation like this one.

61
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:02,905
The Earth is filled
with dead and dying…

62
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,835
… in spirit and body.

63
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,920
But now it is the time
to the glory of Lord…

64
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:10,524
… to come to the Earth
as the water covers the sea.

65
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,190
<i>"Now is the time!"</i>

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,720
We prophecied these dry bones,
arise!

67
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,214
<i>"Now is the time!"</i>

68
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,819

# The word of the Lord #

70
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,096
# The word of the Lord of Zion #

# The word of the Lord,

00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,565
# Prophecy… #

81
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,604
# The Lord… #

82
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:08,697
# Arise #
[He will save the nation]

83
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,509
# The Lord will… #

84
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,011
# Arise! #

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,535
Fabulous! Alright,
Thank you for coming!

86
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:25,148
That is great.

87
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,023
Wow!

88
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,458
I have no idea how many people
are here today.

89
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,463
I told the auditorium hold
about 500 …

90
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,226
… so we are doing pretty good,
are we?

91
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:38,036
Ok listen,
mums and dads.

92
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,188
I want to tell you about something
that we have in the bookstore.

93
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,471
We have School of Evangelism …

94
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,404
… and unfortunately,
this one doesn't sell quite as much…

95
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:49,313
… because people,
for whatever reason…

96
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,177
… I guess they think that
this is gonna be a door-knock key.

97
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,149
A manual, uh.

98
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,208
And it is not.
There is an hands?in the back…

99
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:59,987
… that teaches kids how to, eh…

100
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,521
…actually start a conversation
with their friends…

101
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,542
… and how to? the loss?.

102
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,899
Another thing that
I wanted to announce…

103
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,992
is our camp
coming up in August.

104
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,960
Yeah!

105
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,168
And it just gonna be
an incredible time!

106
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,206
We've got brochures…

107
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,314
… on the camp
sitting on the bookstore.

108
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:20,372
You need to pick one up
and begin to pray…

109
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:23,627
…about*****
this year. Ok?

110
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,975
Boys and Girls! I need everybody seated
***…

111
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,385
…*****right this way.

112
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,280
Is there anyone here
that believes…

113
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,420
… that God can do anything?

114
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,722
God can do anything!
We can just say: "God, fix the world!"

115
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,932
How do you know?
This is a pretty sick old world?

116
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,273
This is a sick old world.

117
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,868
***, just fix it!

118
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,423
Somebody hit your tools…

119
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:55,446
… and let's just fix this old world!

120
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,877
Can't you God change things?

121
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,051
We got too many Christian ***?

122
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,956
… fat and lazy.

123
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,406
They don't want to give up
their evening meal…

124
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,852
… they don't want to
***** for 3 days…

125
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,892
… or 40 days or whatever.

126
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,706
Do you know Muslims,
train their children…

127
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:18,602
… from the time of 5 years-old…

128
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,531
… to **** during the month of Ramadan?

129
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,780
Listen,
we hold the keys.

130
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,314
"We" can change the world.

131
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,949
Boys and girls can
change the world?

132
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,982
Absolutely!

133
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,321
Absolutely!

134
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,827
***** stand** feet.

135
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,795
I need you to get serious,
serious with God.

136
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:49,977
Say: "God"

137
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:50,928
<i> God</i>

138

<i>I am here to be trained</i>

140
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:55,489

<i>I am here for an education</i>

142
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,720
I am willing God.

143
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:00,211
<i>I am willing God.</i>

144
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:02,243
I will do what
you want me to do.

145
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:04,144
<i>I will do what
you want me to do.</i>

146
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,233
I'll say what you want me to say.

147
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:07,934
<i>I'll say what you want me to say.</i>

148
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:09,514

<i>In Jesus name</i>

<i>Amen</i>

152
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,663
You don't open your mouth…

153
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,797
… the Holy Spirit can't talk.

154
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,017
Alright, I want everyone that you
raise your hands…

155
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,628
… and we gonna
pray in tongue.

156
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:26,262
Aleluya,
let's do it.

157
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,873
Oh, we love you,
Jesus...

158
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,508
Holy Spirit, Lord.
***

159
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,047
Feel its power!
Feel its power!

160
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,286
You talk them and...

161
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,515
The Holy Spirit is going to
whisper you what to say.

162
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,387
Don't stop!
Don't stop!

163
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,565
This it is the greatest day
of your lives…

164
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,167
… next the day you got saved??.

165
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,852
She's not in trance,
she's not out of her.

166
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:22,593
She is very aware of
what's going on.

167
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,837
She's just hooking up
with the spirit…

168
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,123
…she's just staying focused.

169
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,404
I am going to playgrounds
of kids that…

170
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:53,008
…don't know anything
about the Christianity…

171
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,189
…lead them to the Lord
in a matter of…

172
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,693
…just no time at all
and just a moment later...

173
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,299
they can be seen? in vision
of hearing the voice of God…

174
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,854
… because they are so open.

175
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:05,693
They are so usable
in Christianity.

176
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,704
If we look at the
world's population…

177
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,476
… one third of that
6,700 million people…

178
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,849
…are children under the age of 15,
one third.

179
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,623
Where should we putting
our efforts?

180
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,489
Where should we putting
our focus?

181
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,258
I'll tell you where are our enemies
are putting it…

182
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,397
…they are putting on the kids.

183
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,790
You **** to schools.
You go in Palestine…

184
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,398
… and I can take you to
some websites…

185
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,131
… that would absolutely shake you
to your foundations…

186
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,332
… and show you photographs of
where they're taking their kids…

187
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,967
… camps like we take our kids
to Bible camps…

188
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,170
… and they're putting hand-grenades
in their hands…

189
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,045
… they teach them how to put
on bomb-belt…

190
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,909
… they teach them
how to use rifles…

191
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,779
… they teach them
how to use machine guns…

192
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,729
It is no wonder with that kind
of intense training and discipline…

193
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,048
… that those young people are ready to kill
themselves for the cause of Islam.

194
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:10,558
I want to see young people who are
commited with the cause of Jesus Christ…

195
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,166
… as the young people
are to the cause of Islam.

196
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,933
I want to see them
as radically laying down their lives…

197
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:20,242
… for the Gospel,
as they are over in Pakistan…

198
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,711
… in Israel and…
and Palestine…

199
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,416
… and all *** places,
you know because we have…

200
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,278
Excuse me!
But we have the Truth!

201
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,824
I would say
there is a friendly environnement now…

202
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,221
… in the United States
towards Christianity…

203
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,287
… that has been in my lifetime…

204
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,697
… and a lot of it has to do just
the last few years…

205
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,496
… has to do with President Bush.

206
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,232
He has really brought
some real credibility…

207
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,104
… to the Christian faith.
He has been very opened…

208
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,668
… ***ly open,
about his faith in God.

209
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,608
This moment right now today,
is a fulfillment of a prophecy.

210
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:04,179
We got to stand up
and take back to the land.

211
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,054
Hey listen,
I just wanted to know you guys

212
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,701
- Both, you came with Mark, right?
******

213
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,430
You are not related to him, right?

214
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,402
- No
- He is coming to our camp this summer.

215
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,964
Are you guys coming too?

216
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,408
- To North Dakota?
- To North Dakota.

217
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,173
- Yes.
- You are coming?

218
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,744
*** Your whole family coming?
Or just you guys?

219
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,380
- I think just this?.
- Awesome!

220
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,621
With my brother,
my twin brother.

221
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,395
I want to know
more about you guys.

222
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,245
How long have you
been a Christian?

223
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,785
I've been a Christian,
I was at 5…

224
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:39,957
- I got saved.
- Yes?
- Because I just** of life.

225
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,787
- Yes?
- And ** nothing…

226
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,089
… I got****…

227
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,430
You got 5 years-old and
there was nothing fun?

228
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,557
- Yeah.
- Really? Already?

229
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,592
So, what do you think
the camp is gonna be like?

230
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:50,995
What do you expect in?

231
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,851
What do you expect in
God to do for you?

232
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,463
What am I expecting
God to do for me?

233
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,602
- Yeah, camp.
- I think… Oh, camp!

234
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,616
Camp,
I think God is gonna... you know…

235
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,741
… give me use to meeting
other people…

236
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,281
… because I have hard
times for that.

237
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,785
- I can't believe that!
- I'm shy!

238
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,812
You are shy?
I can't believe it!

239
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,790
Except for when things
have been ****.

240
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,391
Yeah, then you are
not shy at all!

241
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,087
- No
- Oh, you guys are great.

242
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,993
Really appreciate
that you come.

243
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,621
*** to see you in summer.

244
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,632
*****

245
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,668
Good to meet you, Terrene.
Good to meet you, Levi.

246
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,864
- We will talk later.
- Ok.
- Bye, bye.

247
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,484
<i>Time for creation,
garden of Eden…</i>

248
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,684
<i>...approximatively 6000 years ago.</i>

249
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,525
Was it an explosion?

250
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,568
Did we come for a global ****?

251
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,070
Argh! Argh!

252
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,368
I don't think so.

253
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,937
It's been said that we are
the result of an explosion…

254
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,975
… is this true?
Is this scientific?

255
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:51,020
Or is it just based on a belief?

256
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,889
Levi, come here.

257
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,424
I need to be near you.

258
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,265
Alright, let's go over
some things.

259
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,027
One popular thing to do
in American politics…

260
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,835
… it is to note that the summers
in the United States…

261
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,572
… over the past few years,
have been very warm.

262
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,542
As a result,
global warming must be real.

263
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,048
What's wrong
with this reasoning?

264
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,780
- It's only got a 0.6 degrees.
- Ah.

265
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,152
Yeah, it is not really
a big problem, is it?

266
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,989
No. I don't think that
it's gonna hurt us.

267
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,159
It is… It is a huge political issue,
global warming.

268
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,055
And that's why
it's really important for you…

269
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,159
- … to understand…
- The evolution too?

270
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,294
- Um, not really. At the most…
- Creationism?

271
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,966
Um, it is becoming one.
Now.

272
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,631
What if you got to go to school
where the teacher says…

273
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,336
…creationism is stupid…

274
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,345
… and you are stupid
if you believe it?

275
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,143
- I think they should... yeah
- Well?

276
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,184
Or, what if you got
to go to school…

277
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,776
… where your teacher says
evolution is stupid…

278
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,446
… and you are stupid
if you believe it?

279
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,286
- It wouldn't mind it.
- You wouldn't mind it.

280
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,223
If you look at creationism…

281
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,659
… you realise it is
the only possible answer…

282
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,096
- … to all the questions.
- That's exactly what Dad says.

283
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,896
It is the only possible answer
to all the questions.

284
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,928
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

285
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,498
Yes.

286
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,003
Did you get to the part
where it says that…

287
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,411
… science doesn't prove
anything? Ja!

288
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,009
And it's really interesting
when you look it that way.

289
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,184
- It is.
- It is.

290
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,049
- Alright!
- Alright.

291
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,487
I think personally that Galileo
made the right choice…

292
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,421
… by giving up
science for Christ.

293
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,899
God didn't say:
"Have children…

294
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:52,168
… and give my kids to someone out
for 8 hours a day. "

295
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,578
And if I can homeschool them…

296
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,484
… as well as can? public school…

297
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,888
…why would I send them somewhere else
for 8 hours a day?

298
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:06,004
Our nation was founded on…

299
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:09,652
…Judeo-Christian values.

300
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,991
We know when things
start changing…

301
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,057
… *** out of schools, and…

302
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,899
… ah… the schools
started to fall apart.

303
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,702
And now the rest of us
****:

304
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,740
Wait a minute,
where is my country?

305
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,906
Our firm belief is…

306
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,711
… there are two kinds of people
in the world.

307
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,576
People who love Jesus
and people who don't.

308
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,577
And I want my kids to grow up
knowing: You know what?

309
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,187
It's a good thing
to be a Christian..

310
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,993
<i>… Matthew Spalding, our guest.</i>

311
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,397
<i>Tomorrow, Glenn Thomas****
from Christian marines...</i>

312
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,902
<i>… of *** Operation Iraqi Freedom…</i>

313
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,733
<i>… of its book God Saw Them Through.</i>

314
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,165
<i>So, tomorrow it will be very interesting
we will see back here again.</i>

315
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,602
… #******* #

316
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:09,310
Why our kids thought that
global warming doesn't exist?

317
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,753
Ok, why?
Look, rape this world…

318
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,853
…rape this earth,
take everything you want from her…

319
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,053
… because, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

320
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,064
We are not here for very long.

321
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,965
Christ is coming to take us
away from Earth…

322
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,732
… so cut down our trees,
use all of our oil…

323
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,365
… take advantage of everything
that the Earth has to offer...

324
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,375
That's why you're here
getting involved…

325
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,426
…with issues like
global warming.

326
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:35,410
It… it…it… you want
to shake them.

327
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,078
And you want to say:
What… what…

328
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,673
… what is you are
not understanding…

329
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,719
… by the *****
of the Christianity?

330
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,121
How did you get here?

331
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,183
Our president is still
telling Americans…

332
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,285
… that we should teach
creationism in our schools.

333
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:54,999
That we should teach it
right along side with the evolution.

334
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,297
I think **** in this…

335
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,337
… and******…

336
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,036
… exactly what they want.

337
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,133
Do you know what's
happening in Kansas?

338
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,840
Yes, I know it. I saw.

339
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,142
They have to teach
intelligent design…

340
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,146
…right along with
Darwin evolution.

341
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,481
Think about that.

342
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,910
You got 600,000 children,
they are being lied to.

343
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,688
There is no conflict
between two.

344
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,482
- Well, not…
- That is religion, it is not science.

345
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,526
We have a population,
25% of the american population right now…

346
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:28,157
…described themselves
as Evangelists.

347
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,066
Eh… that's about…
about 80 million people.

348
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,798
They're very tenacious
and they elbow their way…

349
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,567
…into positions
of*** America.

350
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,407
That is the emo?
of… of… of a group…

351
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,174
… that is commited
to like I say…

352
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,312
… building a government
that they are comfortable with.

353
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,148
In the end it's gonna come
like a thief in the night.

354
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,980
They are slow
shipping away…

355
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,919
… at the separation between
Church and State.

356
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:26,687
"Jesus died, was buried, three days later,
He rose from the deads.

357
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:33,861
Wasn't Jesus only a man?
No, Jesus Christ is Almighty God."

358
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,801
- Rachael, it's your turn.
- I know.

359
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,831
Go ahead, Rachael.

360
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,665
Yeah, yeah.
Get a**** this time!

361
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,976
Jesus Christ…

362
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,715
… your spirit will help me…

363
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,547
… to meet this ***.

364
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:59,617
Ball, I command you
in Jesus name…

365
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,418
… make a good ****.

366
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,561
Alright, Rachael!

367
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,758
- This side,****.
- Ok

368
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,343
- Hi.
- Hi.

369
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,247
God is telling me that He…
You are****…

370
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,150
…he just wants to take you
and he just wants…

371
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:40,160
… to***, and He has special
plans for you, in your life…

372
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:44,263
… and he just wants you to be able
to follow him with your whole heart.

373
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,870
- Mm, thank you.
- You're welcome.

374
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,307
- I appreciate it.
- Welcome.

375
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,016
Woaw! I***…

376
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,612
… ***.

377
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,124
Yeah, I waited a little bit,
you know, to be sure, you know…

378
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,183
- … *********?
- ********?

379
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,230
Aha. And after I felt
like I*** the right ****.

380
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,529
Alright. Good job, Rachael.

381
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,859
****to be obedient.

382
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,897
I*** bowling ministery there?.

383
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,413
When I grow up,
I just…

384
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,701
…*** it would be kind of fun to be
one of those like…

385
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:35,042
...people who paint nails***...

386
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:38,956
… because you do chance
to tell him about the Lord.

387
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,557
Relaxing Christian
music in back***…

388
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,958
…you know, doing it,
you know what I mean?

389
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,858
It just be very relaxing…

390
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,924
… it would just be able to…

391
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,267
…*****walls at that***, you know…

392
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,401
… and they would just accept it,
you know?

393
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,832
I've been teased several times…

394
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,973
… and… and I just thought to myself:

395
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,570
"Man's decision? Whatever."

396
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,342
God's decision... something

397
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,785
They think I'm weird?
Go ahead.

398
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,887
You are not the one who
is going to be judging me…

399
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,156
… or if I'm gonna go to hell or heaven.
God is.

400
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,823
Now, what He thinks
is so important.

401
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,088
It… doesn't matter
what you think.

402
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,319
This is my favorite part.

403
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,828
Owww!

404
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,081
My favorite kind
of music is like…

405
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,018
… Christian heavy metal,
rock and roll.

406
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,521
It focuses on the bases
towards Jesus…

407
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,391
…and some
of the songs actually say…

408
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:28,126
… like Jesus or “our Lord”
or… stuff like that…

409
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,897
… but they do have
a Christian basis…

410
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:34,068
… and they are focused towards Him,
so that's why I like Christian.

411
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:39,775
Um, and… but really Britney Spears
and like Lindsay Lohan…

412
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,973
… and some people like that…

413
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,581
… I could feel definitely
careless about them…

414
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,217
… because*** their songs
are mainly based …

415
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,748
… on guys or girls…

416
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,953
… and, um… we,
as Christians, I do not…

417
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,752
…I do not believe in that.

418
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,026
- Victoria?
- Yeah?

419
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,699
You *** about 5 minutes…

420
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,596
- … so I can feed you *** lunch.
- Yeah.

421
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,639
When I dance, I really have
to make sure that's God…

422
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,108
… because people will notice…

423
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,368
… when I'm just dancing with flesh.

424
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:18,710
I do that sometimes,
I must admit that…

425
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:21,778
… and I really need
to get over that.

426
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,755
I am not… I am not the only one
who makes that…

427
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,123
People out there…
You are not the only one…

428
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,989
… who makes *** sick.

429
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,255
Can you have a cookie?
You can have a cookie.

430
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,701
Ok. Alright.
Let's do the *** first…

431
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:44,232
… now that everybody is…
***we got in something else.

432
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,510
Jenny? Christian?
Could you stand up, please?

433
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,069
Ok.

434
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,644
I*** the Christian fight…

435
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:56,050
… to our Savior
whose kingdom stands.

436
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:01,550
One brotherhood united all the Christians
in unity and their love.

437
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,651
Ok. ***the Bible.

438
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,290
I **** to the Bible…

439
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,897
…God's almighty?? word.

440
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,198
It will make it a lamp onto my feet…

441
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,202
… and a light onto my path.

442
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,167
I ***words in my heart…

443
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,702
… so*** sin
against God.

444
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,675
Very good everybody.

445
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,706
I look at it, and George***…

446
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,206
… our children
are **to us from God…

447
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,551
… and someday we're gonna
have to answer to God…

448
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,787
… how we raised our children.

449
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,291
I ***: Lord,
you have given me this daughter…

450
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,486
… and, how am I supposed
to train her?

451
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,194
What am I supposed to do now?
Right.

452
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,729
And I bring her to places
where she can learn this…

453
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,570
…from Becky, from Pastor Carol,
from different people.

454
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,305
But the Lord told me
what you need to train her…

455
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,600
… it is to train her
about her character.

456
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,003
Where are you going?

457
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,970
I am going***under the rain.

458
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,181
Ok.

459
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,380
Ok, you **** under the rain.

460
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,048
- I need to ***.
- Well...

461
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,288
…I do not want you to get ***.

462
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,153
Victory, turn around
and go back inside now. Thanks.

463
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,528
Ok.****
10 times*** drops of rain…

464
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,496
You're very funny

465
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:30,972
Tori?

466
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,147
Ok, get your stuff packed,
come on.

467
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:40,153
So, *****.

468
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,856
Tori, we need to get out your
sleeping bag…

469
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,859
…you need your Bible, a pen
and a notebook.

470
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,192
Flashlight, oh…

471
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,862
**** brief prophecy****

472
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:51,936
Right!

473
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,601
Alright, did you find
the *** or ****?

474
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,299
Check in your…
Yeah, check in there.

475
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,847
*** walk among the*** and stuff and...

476
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,092
…just pray over the seats.

477
00:28:49,362 --> 00:28:52,060
Yeah, yeah in the name of Jesus,
we just speak over…

478
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,400
… every person that is sitting in
these chairs this week…

479
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:59,328
… and Lord, we just ask
to be covered with the blood of Jesus…

480
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,768
Open hearts, Lord,
Open hearts.

481
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,607
Father, we pray over
the electrical system…

482
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,545
… we pray over the electricity
will not go out in this building…

483
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:10,847
…in Jesus name…

484
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:13,217
…because of storms
or any other reason.

485
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,779
I am just praying
over this equipment.

486
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,850
We speak over
the PowerPoint presentations…

487
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,923
… all of the video projectors…

488
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,019
… and we say: "devil,
we know what you love to do…

489
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,661
… in meetings like this "

490
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,459
And we say:
"You will not in Jesus name.

491
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,626
You will not prevent
this message from going out…

492
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,435
No microphone problems
in Jesus name "

493
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,835
In the name of Jesus,
we speak that.

494
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,906
Father, we just ask you,
in the mighty name of Jesus…

495
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,279
… that this will be a
defining moment in their lives.

496
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,045
Father, I pray that Jesus
will be glorified on this camp.

497
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,947
You cannot go in there.

498
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,653
Billy, you cannot go in there.

499
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,763
Alright. I am so…

500
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,721
It exhausts to me doing this.

501
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,085
# Aw, yeah #

502
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,699
# Born...born... born,

503
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:14,102

named Mary on Christmas Day #

504
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,699
# He bled and he died on
the cross to take sin away #

505
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,273
# You take him high #

506
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,009
# You take him low #

507
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,914
# You take J.C. wherever you go #

508
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,315
# Tell me who's in the house? J.C.! #

509
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,854
# Tell me who's in the house? J.C.! #
[Come on!]

510
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:34,981
# Who's in the house? J.C.! #

511
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,410
# Jesus Christ is in the house today #

512

# When He's in your life you want to dance #

513
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,061
# We're kickin' it,
we're kickin' it for Christ #

514
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,564
# Dance!
We're kickin' it for Christ #

515
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,000
# Dance!
We're kickin' it for Christ #

516
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,440
# Dance!
We're kickin' it for Christ #

517
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,707
# I say, it's Jesus Christ #

518
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,080
# Who is in the house today! #

519
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:04,117
Whoa, give** a big big**!.

520
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,958
Good evening!

521
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,315
You made it!
[Whooo!]

522
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,996
***you guys like my hair?

523
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,132
Fingernails?

524
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:19,169
The eyebrows?

525
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,637
And the rest of me?!

526
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,243
*** talk this week about
how the devil…

527
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,947
…uses tactics to destroy
our lives.

528
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:37,213
The first tactic that he uses
is to tempt you with sin.

529
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,528
*** you first ** as a kid…

530
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:51,365
… particularly***  these stuff starts.

531
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,436
When you start as a kid,
sin just doesn't seem like that…

532
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,334
… ***.

533
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,570
It looks kinda cute, in fact.
Warm and fuzzy???.

534
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:09,779
But sin is designed
to destroy you.

535
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,885
And you feed this
baby long enough…

536
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:19,292
… and he's gonna grow
in your life…

537
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,130
… until you got yourself
tied by the tail…

538
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,893
… and you don't know
how which end is up??…

539
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,905
… and what you seems
very innocent…

540
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,733
… now controls your life.

541
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,581
The devil goes after the young.

542
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,788
Those who cannot
*** for themselves.

543
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,682
That's why we're trying to help you…

544
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,826
… we are trying to warn you.

545
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:54,744
And while I'm on the subject…

546
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:58,835
Let me say something about Harry Potter...

547
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,904
*** are enemies of God!

548
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:11,211
And I don't care what kind of hero they are:
They are enemy of God…

549
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:15,448
… and it had been in the Old Testament,
Harry Potter would have been put to death!

550
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:16,880
Amen!

551
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,795
***?Don't make heroes ****.

552
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,765
This is a generation,
is gonna stand for purity…

553
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:34,763
… and righteousness and holiness and you are
going to serve the Lord all the days of your life.

554
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,670
And we declare
all those things over you.

555
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,939
I believe this so much that
I have given my whole life…

556
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,243
… to*** that you get there.

557
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,627
I sense in my heart tonight??
what the Lord says…

558
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,726
… is that there are some kids here…

559
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:01,388
… saying they are Christian…

560
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,056
… they go to the church all the time…

561
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,765
… but one thing:
when you went to your church…

562
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,765
… and another thing:
when it is school with your friends.

563
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:09,133
You are *** and hypocrit.

564
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,600
You do things
you shouldn't do…

565
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,574
You talk dirty just like
the other kids talk dirty.

566
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,445
And it's time to clean up your act.

567
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,077
Come up here and get washed.

568
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,717
Because we cannot have ***
in the army of God.

569
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,688
If that's you,
put your hands up here.

570
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,924
Woah, baby...
Wash your hands.

571
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:37,465
Father, we just wash them
with the water of your Word.

572
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,600
We say: "No more, devil.
No more!"

573
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,741
Say, boys and girls:
"In the name of Jesus."

574
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,168
You know exactly
what you need to *** up.

575
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,938
Name it!
Name it aloud!

576
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,210
Name it,
what you need to be forgiven out???

577
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:56,813
# Oh- oh… Oh- oh… #

578
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:01,182
# Oh- oh… Oh- oh… #

579
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,886
No more ****,
no more hypocrisy.

580
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,393
Now you got somewhere
and pray…

581
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,728
… and you start doing some
repenting here.

582
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:13,133
# Oh- oh… Oh- oh #

583
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:32,752
Uh… I… uh…
I haven't got much to say.

584
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:36,384
I just wanted
to talk about belief and God…

585
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:41,758
… and I've had a hard time
doing it and…

586
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,596
… it's just really
hard to do this…

587
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,904
… just to believe in God
is really hard…

588
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:55,639
… because you don't see Him.
You don't… You don't…

589
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,578
… really know how much.

590
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:01,549
Sometimes I don't even believe
in the Bible says.

591
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,018
It makes me ****, makes me feel
guilty and bad because…

592
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:13,794
… God always talked to me about
that of how??? I have rejected Him.

593
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,549
Bu!

594
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:21,664
*****.

595
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,299
Ahhh!

596
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,669
Ah…

597
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,129
- Somebody died.
- Ah… Scared...

598
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,174
Dark, dark house
there was the dark, dark corridor.

599
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,301
Dark, dark corridor
it took to the dark, dark quarter.

600
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,072
In the dark, dark quarter
there was the dark, dark stairs.

601
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,671
Ouh!

602
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,540
- Everyone in the bed?
- I 'm not.

603
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:43,348
- Alright.
- I'm not going to do it****…

604
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,049
I will not ***
about ghosts stories, Ok?

605
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:49,116
Some are a lot of fun
but they don't **** God…

606
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,927
… and, uh, God says to focus
on those things…

607
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,391
…that are…
that *** truth…

608
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,227
… and in those things that have beauty.

609
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,738
Focus on the good things
and the things of God, Ok?

610
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,939
Here we go.
Lights up, guys.

611
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:26,361
- What time is breakfast?
- Eight.

612
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,092
My hair is still wet.

613
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,862
God just created humans that ate from
the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.

614
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,699
Resulted in sin and death.

615
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,338
I got some dripping with blood
here somewhere.

616
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,950
Alright, that's better.

617
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,387
And now I move these letters.

618
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:53,991
That's better.

619
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,058
This generation particularly…

620
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:58,919
… is the sight and sound generation…

621
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,427
… and so, it is very difficult for them…

622
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,461
… to sit down with a book,
a tablet and a pencil…

623
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,693
… and try to learn
the way we've learnt.

624
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,995
They learn visually,
they learn by demonstration…

625
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,963
… they learn by uh…
modeling and***.

626
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,333
These are****, ain't that great?

627
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,845
And just good old Ken and Barbie dolls…

628
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,709
… and so, we talk about how
they walked and talked…

629
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,113
… in the garden of the Eden with God…

630
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,549
… but when God breathed in the man **************…

631
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:26,556
… in ****,
the breath of life.

632
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,725
At that point, man
became a living soul.

633
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,487
Now I tell the kids:…

634
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,832
…"If you want to become
a stronger Christian…

635
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,275
… and have your spirit man be strong…

636
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,431
… there are certain things that you need to do."

637
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:42,654
If you pray everyday…

638
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:45,804
… your spirit *** will get stronger.

639
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:49,104
If you go to church
and learn more about God…

640
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,573
…your spirit is gonna get stronger.

641
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,275
If you don't read the Bible…

642
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,613
*******.

643
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,718
********.

644
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,086
Your spirit will be ****.

645
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,818
So…

646
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,488
For instance,
we have a brain mold…

647
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,629
… because one of the sessions is
gonna be talking about our minds…

648
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,860
… and how they need to*** the word of God.

649
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,802
This is really fun because
you can make a jelly mold??? …

650
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,334
It looks like a brain.

651
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,567
And you just talk about how things
stick to our minds…

652
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,600
… and we used these sticky fingers…

653
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:22,243
… and so*** represent, uh, dirty thoughts…

654
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,344
… this could represent
swear words…

655
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,175
…*** represent things
that we have seen on TV…

656
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:30,814
… or whatever that we heard,
and it sticks to our minds…

657
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,348
… and you suppose to slap it.

658
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,418
- *** brain?
- I don't know if it slaps.

659
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,983
But *** stick very good
but ***, it is sticking there.

660
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,824
It sticks to your brain and
that's very effective for kids.

661
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,460
So***** we have many
different things we've gotten???.

662
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,192
But that's what I do,
I just look around…

663
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,066
… and walk around ****conceptions of stores???…

664
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,838
… or see something and ***:

665
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:53,841
That really would work good for…..
You know… So...

666
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,974
I come *** 20 objects classes
****…

667
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,083
… you know, and people…
Other children ministeries ***:

668
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,709
Preaching an hour for kids
and I feel sorry for the kids.

669
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:04,588
<i>You need to feel sorry for my kids?</i>

670
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,550
They know exactly,
you know…

671
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,318
They're getting it...
they're getting it.

672
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,828
# I got Jesus, yes I do,
I got Jesus, I want??? you? #

673
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,093
# I got Jesus, yes I do,
I got Jesus, I want??? you? #

674
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:21,470
# I got Jesus, yes I do,
I got Jesus, I want??? you all! #

675
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,900
# I got Jesus, yes I do,
I got Jesus, I want??? you? #

676
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,475
# 1, 2, 3, 4,
We got Jesus, and *** #

677
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,913
Everybody ready?
We're gonna pray again.

678
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:36,643
Alright! God, we just thank you
for this food this morning.

679
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,955
We ask you Father
to bless it…

680
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:43,287
… and Lord Jesus, we plead??your blood
over our sins…

681
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,252
… and the sins of our nation.

682
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:49,461
God, end abortion
and send revival to America.

683
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,994
Thank you, Jesus,
Amen.

684
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,306
Mom, doesn't he look like Harry Potter?

685
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,237
Mom, he looks like Harry Potter.

686
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,035
- A bit, yes.
- *** here.

687
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:07,181
I can't watch it,
because it has witchcrafts.

688
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,011
My mum doesn't want me
to watch any of the movies…

689
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,921
… 'cause of the witchcraft,
but I watch it with my dad.

690
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:19,794
It is Becky Fischer.

691
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,597
This is Becky Fischer,
in live and in colors?

692
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:22,966
Uh... She's ****

693
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,658
- Look at her new hairstyle!
- Hahaha!

694
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:26,667
Oh, she's the number one
cover lady for…

695
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,173
…Children's Ministry worldwide
for April.

696
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,366
It is almost like being
on the cover of Rolling Stones.

697
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,452
So far, camp
has been awesome.

698
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,660
I love being in
the presence of God.

699
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,741
God is not in every church,
there is such a thing there…

700
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,442
...***
it has certain church…

701
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,947
… they call: "dead churches"…

702
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,676
… and people there,
they sit there like this:

703
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:21,450
<i>We worship you, God,
we worship you, God.</i>

704
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:24,490
They sing like 3 songs
and they listen to a sermon.

705
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,658
Churches are God likes to go to…

706
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,591
Our churches are *** jumping up and down,
shouting His name…

707
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,768
… and just praising Him.
They are not acting…

708
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:36,370
They are not quiet…
"We worship you"

709
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:41,040
They are… Aleluya!! God!!
You know, and…

710
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:46,884
… and depending on what…
how they invite Him…

711
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,683
… He'll be there or not.

712
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:56,653
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y,
that's the trojan??? battle cry.

713
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:01,661
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y,
that's the trojan??? battle cry.

714
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,687
I got my Bible.

715
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,720
They told me that
I was going to preach tonight.

716
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,263
I'm really **** about
preaching kids.

717
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:36,856
I have never really preached
a whole bunch kids I didn't know.

718
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,370
I feel, I mean,
I really feel…

719
00:45:47,944 --> 00:45:51,410
… I really feel that we are
a key generation, I really do.

720
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,447
I really feel that…

721
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,219
that this generation,
is a key generation…

722
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,579
… to Jesus coming back.

723
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,556
That is exactly what I want to say.

724
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,799
I don't write the sermon,
God writes the sermon.

725
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,866
I mean, I can feel it
sometimes *****…

726
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,537
… I can feel it in my arm…

727
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:19,006
… someone is holding my arm
when I am writing, right?

728
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,945
And I feel when I go up
and I start preaching…

729
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,178
The Holy Spirit is gonna
come out of me.

730
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,513
Not…that ain't gonna be me
up there *** preaching…

731
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,746
…It is... but you know,
it's not gonna be... me.

732
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,620
You know, we can't just
sit around on the couch all day…

733
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,689
… because Satan will be after you.

734
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,865
He is not gonna sit around either.

735
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,162
If Satan is not sitting around you,
you shouldn't sit around.

736
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,969
Satan will try to trip you
off your path…

737
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,736
… off your race,
off the course…

738
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,545
Don't let him do that.

739
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:58,241
In Jesus name,
do not let Satan get you off …

740
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,377
…what God has for you.

741
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,212
We are a generation
that needs to rise up…

742
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,052
… that needs to rise up
and **** the time…

743
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,516
… *** with a whole heart,
everything we've got.

744
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:11,792
Yeah!

745
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:23,029
Now... who's ready for
some fun tonight?

746
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,538
You know, it ain't gonna be the same person
that you came on this camp...

747
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:31,876
… you gonna be a different person…

748
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,849
… you gonna be radical,
you gonna be on fire.

749
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,092
How many want to be those
who give up their lives for Jesus?

750
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,931
I got my big old ***
ghost hamming*** tonight.

751
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,273
We gonna break something
in *** tonight.

752
00:47:56,841 --> 00:47:59,801
We gonna break the power
of the enemy in government.

753
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:03,242
They came to your schools and
they took Jesus out of your schools but…

754
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,405
…one thing they couldn't do,
is take Jesus out of your heart.

755
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:10,516
We can't just sit back
and accept corrupt government.

756
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:14,185
I believe God wants to put godly
righteous people in government.

757
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,716
How many of you
want to break this cup?

758
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,892
The power of the enemy
of government.

759
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:25,193
Break this cup.

760
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,735
You break that thing
in the name of Jesus.

761
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,942
Righteous government ***...
Righteous government.

762
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,977
Lord, come on,
proclame that righteous government.

763
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,454
Everytime you break a cup…

764
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,319
… there is a release in the spirit.

765
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,627
We break the power of the devil!...
in this nation.

766
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:54,558
In the name of Jesus,
it's gone.

767
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,499
Shout it out!! Shout it out!!
I wanna hear you!

768
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,659
****

769
00:49:02,759 --> 00:49:06,874
Fire in the world!
In the world!

770
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:18,618
Jesuuuuuuuus!!!!!!

771
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,635
*****kids, ****.

772
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,704
Unlike McDonald's,
this is not about how fast…

773
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,074
…you can go to?? the drive-thru.

774
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:45,737
You want something *** God,
you gonna have to cook a little!...

775
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,981
You need to stay in the pot???…

776
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:57,324
…****in the holy ghost.

777
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:04,133
God touched you tonight,
I wanna hear about it.

778
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,564
Somebody come tell me
what happened.

779
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,666
- Pray it out???, Tori.
- Pray it out???.

780
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,702
[Take the microphone.]

781
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:14,801
***** changes our nation…

782
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,511
… if we break ****…

783
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:22,885
… and we proclaimed
to Lion of Judas.

784
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,130
Take these prophecies…

785
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:44,231
… and do what the apostle Paul said,
and make war with them.

786
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,748
This means war!

787
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:01,522
This means war!

788
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:04,923
This means war!

789
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,124
Are you a part of that or not?

790
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,365
- Sorry, I like to throw rocks.
- Ok, Levi.

791
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,002
******.

792
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,442
Whenever I run into a non-Christian
something you know, I always uh…

793
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,772
… there is always something
that doesn't... seem right…

794
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:04,880
…there is always something
that… makes my fear…

795
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,184
…***, you know.

796
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,193
This world *** feeds you is trash.

797
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:15,425
It's like... giving out candy…

798
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,063
… but I don't want candy,
I want the meal.

799
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,764
The Holy Spirit is like the meal.
A good food, you know.

800
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,402
The food that you need
and so that is good.

801
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:26,165
But candy will just make you sick…

802
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,977
That's what a lot of people
in this world are: they are sick.

803
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,643
They are looking
for something.

804
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:46,826
You could pick up
a huge spider, back there.

805
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,897
- I am not going back there.
- Let me there to see.

806
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:51,691
- Where?
- Up????.

807
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,862
- Show me.
- You see it?

808
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,806
You see that big ******?

809
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:00,143
I know it,
it's digusting.

810
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,109
I do think I'm different
from another kids…

811
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,475
… because we know Jesus and
we're hungry after Jesus, you know?!

812
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,115
But you know what?

813
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,082
I wouldn't be different
from other kids…

814
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:12,714
… if I *** their call????.

815
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,418
That's the thing with America.

816
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:20,693
America... you know, is supposed to be,
uh... God's nation, right?

817
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:25,458
Then things just gotta start...
twisting around, you know.

818
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:30,131
And now, a lot of people in America
just don't follow in God.

819
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,745
Ok, we're gonna welcome
Mister President now.

820
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:54,026
Talk to him. Say:
"Welcome..., welcome President Bush."

821
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,763
<i>Welcome, President Bush.</i>

822
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:57,227
We're glad you're here.

823
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:58,601
<i>We're glad you're here.</i>

824
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,427
I want you to bless him.
Speak up blessing to him.

825
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:04,672
Do that **** your hands
and speak up blessing to him.

826
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,907
Do ****.

827
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:16,012
He has surrounded himself
with spirit filled people…

828
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,656
… So pray in spirit over him…

829
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:22,526
…Here he is,
come to visit us.

830
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,225
Yes, Lord...
Thank you Jesus.

831
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,002
Tell him: "Mister President…"

832
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:32,768
<i>Mister President</i>

833
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,437
… one nation under God. "

834
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,639
<i>Mister President…</i>

835
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:40,641
<i>… one - nation - under - God!</i>

836
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,487
- The days went fast, really?
- Yeah.

837
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:01,291
They just flew... whooa!
And this... is the Big Night.

838
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,893
- Yeah.
- Yeah, are you ready?

839
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,535
We got some good surprises
for you tonight, alright?

840
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:11,872
Hey, I want everybody sit down***
the smiling faces, right this way.

841
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,309
Hi you??? guys.

842
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:22,714
I am very excited tonight,
I usually talk to... to big people…

843
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:28,124
… but tonight I get to talk...
maybe to the most important generation…

844
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:29,985
… in american history.

845
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,357
Whoa! And I am not just joking.

846
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,988
Where is the young man?
The young man with a long hair.

847
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:39,030
Right there,
come here son.

848
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:44,274
Just stand right with me,
what's your name?

849
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,573
- My name is Levi.
- Levi?

850
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,836
Whoa, that's a great name, Levi.

851
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:52,413
- Do you like Levi's name?
- Yes.

852
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,447
Here is the deal.
Before you were born…

853
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:59,183
… God knew you.

854
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:00,855
Extraordinary.

855
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,956
He said this: "He said he formed
you in your mother's womb."

856
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,462
You are not just
a piece of protoplasma…

857
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:09,658
… or whatever that is.

858
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:14,135
Not just a piece of tissue
in your mother's womb.

859
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,596
You were created in***ely
by God.

860
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,311
Is that incredible?

861
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,877
God wrote a book about your life
and He wrote:

862
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:32,947
Levi... Levi will be a God seeker
from an early age…

863
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:38,323
… and he will become a voice
that touch the America. "

864
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:40,421
Yeah!

865
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:44,524
And he would not sell out...
in his teenage years…

866
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,214
…he will go for God all those days…

867
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,003
… and he will be a man of prayer."
[Yeah!]

868
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:52,811
And in his twenties…
… he begin to share things real strong for God…

869
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,770
… in the nation.

870
00:56:55,289 --> 00:57:00,273
God's dream:
"The novel of Levi's life"…

871
00:57:00,479 --> 00:57:01,964
… signed: God.

872
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:03,714
What do you think of that?

873
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,312
- That's pretty cool.
- Pretty cool, uh?

874
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,982
You are pretty cool.

875
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,596
Now listen to me, guys.

876
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:19,026
Since 1973,
up to 50 million babies…

877
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,196
… never had chance
to fulfill their dreams…

878
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,303
…God had for their lives.

879
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,308
That's sad, isn't it?

880
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,809
Do you know,
a third of your friends…

881
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:31,873
… could be here tonight,
but they never made it.

882
00:57:33,304 --> 00:57:40,311
A person's... a person.
Not matter how small...

883
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:44,785
God has a dream for the lucky
has a dream for you.

884
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:49,494
*** see that?... It's *** awesome, isn't it?
Look at that.

885
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,191
7 weeks old.

886
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:55,266
Tonight, I believe
something is gonna start tonight…

887
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:57,006
… that can change America.

888
00:57:57,473 --> 00:58:01,037
Seriously... kids,
I believe: you are the beginning…

889
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:04,374
… of a movement that can raise
upon? moral outcry…

890
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:07,383
… that can overthrow abortion
in America and could turn this.

891
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:10,181
Would you like to be part
of that kind of company?

892
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,178
Yeah!

893
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:31,668
Jesus, I plead your blood…

894
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:35,004
… over my sins
and the sins of my nation.

895
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:39,244
God, end abortion
and send revival to America.

896
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:44,015
Louder: Jesus!
I plead your blood over my sins…

897
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:45,916
… and the sins of my nation.

898
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,923
God, end abortion
and send revival to America.

899
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:54,521
Life! Life! We command life, Lord,
in the name of Jesus, life!

900
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,496
Satan, in Jesus name,
*** go of them.

901
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,566
You have no power taking
people's life…

902
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,964
… only God has that power.

903
00:59:03,363 --> 00:59:05,412
No more, Lord...
No more!

904
00:59:06,053 --> 00:59:10,741
No more!...
No more!

905
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:20,218
Adults... we cried after God: 32 years!
Too long!

906
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:23,325
God, we are asking for
the courts of America…

907
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,527
… we are asking
***courts…

908
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,886
… **** righteous judges…

909
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:31,698
… who rule in behalf of
your **** God!

910
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:37,001
Righteous Judges...
Righteous Judges!

911
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,437
Righteous Judges!
Righteous Judges!

912
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:43,809
Righteous Judges!
Righteous Judges!

913
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,673
*** Children are crying to you, God.

914
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:49,919
Here from heaven,
God, it's time.

915
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:51,610
Too long, Lord.

916
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,288
Abortion, God.

917
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,758
Righteous Judges!
Righteous Judges!

918
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,220
Righteous Judges!
Righteous Judges!

919
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,396
You made a ***
with God tonight…

920
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,835
… that you are gonna pray
to end abortion in America.

921
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:13,908
Don't take that lightly,
don't be a promise-breaker.

922
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,839
Don't be a promise-breaker.
Be a history-maker.

923
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,683
Do you think
you know America?

924
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,952
I mean, do you think
you know your own country?

925
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,455
Well, I got to tell you:
you don't.

926
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:04,548
There is a religious political army
of foot soldiers outhere…

927
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:07,295
… that are being directed
by a political right.

928
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,521
This is not a ***
conspiracy stuff…

929
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,368
It's happening!

930
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,594
This people…
you know…

931
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,898
They don't look like poli***,
they don't look like politicians…

932
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:22,465
… they don't look like... they have a…
like they *** band wagon for anybody.

933
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,404
I mean, they just looked like
your neighbor.

934
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,545
But… When you put
them all together…

935
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:30,450
… what ends up happening,
is they start taking control…

936
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,355
… in small slices,
and so…th…

937
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:35,757
This is the last stage.
Let me tell you something.

938
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:39,952
They've taken over...
the White House, Congress…

939
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:42,295
… the judiciary for
a generation.

940
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,592
Together, these people
form a powerful…

941
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:46,798
… I mean, powerful
voting block.

942
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:50,229
Look, George Bush
and Karl Rove…

943
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,171
… all these people:
big, big time.

944
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,511
We've been asleep at the wheel…

945
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:58,646
… as this conservative,
political, fundamentalist element…

946
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:02,311
…has gained too much control
and power in this country.

947
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,787
I... I... I...
Totally beyond me.

948
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:08,080
How anybody can look at
this picture and say:

949
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:09,787
Oh, you know this…
Yeah…

950
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,460
It doesn't affect me.
It's just absurd.

951
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:38,045
I am pleased to announce my nomination
of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr...

952
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:42,450
… as associate justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States.

953
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,492
Definitly,
if the President tries…

954
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:53,093
… to replace O'Connor,
a moderate with an extremist…

955
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,635
… uh, it would be the biggest fight, uh...
over Supreme Court…

956
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,069
… in american history.

957
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,512
The nomination of judge Alito
is so important…

958
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,480
…and why the Church
needed to be involved.

959
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:08,014
It's everything that every Christian
we care about…

960
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,579
… because he is so outspoken
on the life issue…

961
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,617
… and other issues that are
such a great concern to us.

962
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,591
This is a crucial, crucial time.

963
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:24,766
Judge Alito, what we worked on
for a 30 years…

964
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:28,437
… is coming to culmination,
to consumation, right now.

965
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:33,642
And let's... let's confirm
this man, Judge Alito…

966
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:37,710
… to the US Supreme Court
and let's make one more step towards…

967
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,042
… bringing America back
to one nation under God.

968
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,742
God bless you.

969
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:16,275
# Your face is all I see #

970
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:22,054
# And your days will always be#

971
01:04:22,926 --> 01:04:28,452
# A treasure and my reward #

972
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:34,732
# The one thing, yeah, the one thing
I live is Lord#

973
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:40,768
# Oh, how amazing #

974
01:04:41,284 --> 01:04:46,284
# A love beyond explaining #

975
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:52,550
# You are beautiful #

976
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:18,939
We've decided
the Bible is the word of God.

977
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,744
We don't have to have
a general assembly…

978
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,014
… about what we believe.

979
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,515
It is written in the Bible... alright?

980
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:27,847
So we don't have to debate
about what we should think…

981
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:32,220
… about homosexual activity,
it is written in the Bible.

982
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:39,195
I think I know what
you did last night.

983
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:44,464
If you sign me a $1000,
I won't tell your wife.

984
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,746
If you use any of this,
I'll sue you.

985
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:57,074
And I have a 10 year rule
about ***.

986
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:00,088
For those who married somebody
30 years older than you…

987
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,115
… I hope he dies
so you can get his money.

988
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:03,720
But…

989
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:13,259
The point I want to get across is:
you need to make sure in your home...

990
01:06:13,535 --> 01:06:16,069
…you have few core beliefs.

991
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:17,838
And we, as Americans…

992
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,966
… those that are citizen
of the United States…

993
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:22,072
…you need to make
sure our nation…

994
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:23,701
… has a core belief…

995
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,275
… and as we settle
those philosophies correctly…

996
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:32,150
… then our freedom
is guaranteed. Amen?

997
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,484
Let's pray together. Father, in the
mighty name of the Lord Jesus.

998
01:06:35,757 --> 01:06:37,918
We pray for President Bush…

999
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:41,426
… because he is preparing to elect
a new Supreme Court nominee.

1000
01:06:42,273 --> 01:06:45,525
Give us a *** strength
that lasts forever.

1001
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:49,335
Lord, let us not waiver.
Let us not be talked down of it.

1002
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,271
Let us not be negotiated it out of it.

1003
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:58,102
It's massive warfare everyday.
Let the battle begin!

1004
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:02,549
Are you getting all this, in there?

1005
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,550
- Yes
- Ok

1006
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,417
So, you need to repent.

1007
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,957
*** it's great.

1008
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:19,362
When they turn on all those lights,
it's very ***.

1009
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:22,128
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi, what's your name?

1010
01:07:22,305 --> 01:07:24,273
- My name is Levi.
- Hello Levi. Ted Haggard.

1011
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,875
- I am the senior pastor here.
- The sen..., yeah, I guess.

1012
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:28,974
- Ok. You figured that out?
- Yes.

1013
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,644
- What's your name?
- Teri.

1014
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,110
- Was it a good sermon?
- Yes, it was.

1015
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,510
- You do some preaching?
- Yes.

1016
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,913
- What's your favorite subject?
- My favorite subject?

1017
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:38,419
I like faith.
**** faith.

1018
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:41,049
- Well, that's fabulous.
- Yes, I like faith.

1019
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,217
So your people like
hear you preach?

1020
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,586
It seems everybody pays
attention more, you know.

1021
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:48,224
- This, is preaching.
- Is it your content…

1022
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,432
… or is it because you are kid?

1023
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,230
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Well, you know…

1024
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,361
- I guess it's…
- You will know in your 30.

1025
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,328
I say,
use your cute kid thing…

1026
01:07:58,509 --> 01:08:02,043
… until you're 30 and by then
you have a good content.

1027
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,483
We believe that
you have to emphasis…

1028
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:10,944
… people younger than you
in order for your church…

1029
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,879
… to grow in a healthy way.

1030
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:14,924
Kids are everything.

1031
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:17,986
They love the evangelical message,
God loves them…

1032
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:21,094
… the Bible is the word of God,
they are gifts from God.

1033
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,394
So all the public schools telling them
they are animals…

1034
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,798
…they are a product
of natural selection…

1035
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:27,492
… we tell them:
" God loves you."

1036
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,665
God has created you,
you have a purpose in life.

1037
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,299
I mean, the kids are...
just loving it!

1038
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:36,802
And so... uh... So it's a *** lot of people
and we are growing.

1039
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,048
Churches like this…
There is a new church like this…

1040
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:40,840
… every 2 days in America.

1041
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:42,744
It's got enough grow…

1042
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:45,014
… to essentially
***  every election.

1043
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:49,186
If the evangelicals vote,
they determine the election.

1044
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,552
It's a fabulous life!

1045
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:47,678
#… nothing but the blood of Jesus #

1046
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:52,447
# What can make us whole again? #

1047
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:57,118
# Nothing but the blood of Jesus #

1048
01:09:57,793 --> 01:10:02,193
# Oh! Precious is the flow #

1049
01:10:03,396 --> 01:10:08,396
# That make us white as snow #

1050
01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:13,905
# No other fount I know #

1051
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:18,643
# Nothing but the blood of Jesus #
[Let sing it for this nation.]

1052
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:23,618
# What can wash away our sins? #

1053
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:28,089
# Nothing but the blood of Jesus #

1054
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,787
Amen. Ok.

1055
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:36,089
The Bible says that
out of the mouth of babies…

1056
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:37,694
… God has *** praised…

1057
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,664
… to silence the enemy,
and the foe and the avenger.

1058
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:46,404
God wants to use the smallest
to*** the wise…

1059
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,704
…the things that are nothing
to notify the things that are.

1060
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,344
You see the big towers here?

1061
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:54,445
… and the big buildings
and the big men?

1062
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,386
God says the praises of little children
can shake kings.

1063
01:10:57,654 --> 01:11:00,680
Come on!...
Aleluya.

1064
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:45,664
We are being trained to...
go out and train others…

1065
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:49,630
…train others to be God's Army
and to do God's will…

1066
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,033
… what he wants you to do.

1067
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:55,036
I feel ***
trained to be warriors…

1068
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:56,774
… only in a much ***away.

1069
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:00,213
We don't like… I don't feel
the sense or like afraid????…

1070
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:03,250
… *** to die in battle
or anything like you would…

1071
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:06,550
… when you actually go**  to *** the physical???.

1072
01:12:06,723 --> 01:12:08,889
There is a peace with it all too.

1073
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,052
There is an excitement yet peace
at the same time. It's really cool.

1074
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:15,660
You know, a lot of people
die for God and ***…

1075
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,665
… and they are not even afraid.

1076
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:20,099
They don't even feel afraid
of anyone or anything.

1077
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,597
And it is like…
I heard dad told me…

1078
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:25,736
… like when their dads
are like missionaries and stuff…

1079
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,672
… and they had to go to somewhere
really dangerous and stuff…

1080
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:32,439
… they jumped around them and yelling:
"Martyr, martyr!!"

1081
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,450
It's really cool.

1082
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,058
***

1083
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,726
The young man, get in.

1084
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:52,224
I know a powerful soldier for God,
thus it is, son.

1085
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:55,329
You stay right there.
There you go, Joseph.

1086
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:58,072
Someday you might be
the leader of the government…

1087
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:01,706
… who knows, Joseph.
He dreams dreams.

1088
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:04,810
What's your name?
Austin?

1089
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,943
You look great with
that tape on your mouth.

1090
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:12,178
Here we go.
Alright, go ahead young men…

1091
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,288
… ****, I love you.

1092
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,047
Some extreme liberals …

1093
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:19,428
… they have to look at this
and start shaking in their boots.

1094
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,327
The intensity that you see
of these kids…

1095
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,189
… there's no doubt,
they've gotta be watching this…

1096
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:27,128
… and do: "Oh my goodness!",
I didn't know this was possible.

1097
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,673
And what these kids like
when they grow up?

1098
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:35,700
It's like animal*** people
eat your heart out... you know.

1099
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,543
You wanna see intense, you wanna see
kids passionate by Christ.

1100
01:13:39,113 --> 01:13:40,378
This is it.

1101
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,010
You know,
I have to believe with all my heart …

1102
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,383
… that this is just
a tip of the iceberg.

1103
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:48,221
I believe those kids made
an impact in heaven.

1104
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,458
God hears the cries of children.

1105
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,260
Ufff! It makes me wanna cry.

1106
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,819
We are talking to Becky
in Bismarck, North Dakota.

1107
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:29,592
She is a children's pastor
and she runs a summer camp…

1108
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:32,329
… for evangelical children
there, in North Dakota.

1109
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,002
- Becky, how are you?
- I'm doing very good.

1110
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:39,173
Why kids? Why are they supposed
to be some new army of God?

1111
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:41,342
Why are we using
kids to do that?

1112
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,337
Anyone who does any work
with kids knows this…

1113
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,873
… it's because the reason
you go for kids…

1114
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,381
… it is because
whatever they learn…

1115
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,781
… by the age of 7, 8, 9 years old…

1116
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,284
… it's pretty long there
for the rest of their lives…

1117
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:54,615
… and there are statistics
that you can research for yourself…

1118
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:58,391
No, I… I… I know these statistics,
but you used the term "to learn"...

1119
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:01,626
The word to learn
is different than “indoctrinate”...

1120
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,492
God gave us a brain…

1121
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,898
… God gave us the freedom to choose…

1122
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:07,993
… and learning is part of that choice.

1123
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,966
And I think everytime
the fundamentalist movement, Becky…

1124
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,607
…interferes with that,
we are doing harm…

1125
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:16,001
… we are doing harm to
the progression of the mankind.

1126
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:19,705
I don't think any*** kid
anything by choice.

1127
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,346
Uhm.. If I understood,
your question to me was…

1128
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,950
… if I feel it right for
the fundamentalism…

1129
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,052
… to indoctrinate their children
with their own beliefs.

1130
01:15:27,423 --> 01:15:29,255
I guess, fundamentally,
yes I do.

1131
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:32,417
Because every other religions
are indoctrinating their kids.

1132
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:35,855
Hello? I would like to see
more churches indoctrinating.

1133
01:15:36,631 --> 01:15:38,564
You can tell a child anything.

1134
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,499
Just like I say,
you can tell a child…

1135
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:44,132
You can make a child
into a soldier that carries a AK-47.

1136
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,035
You can call it brain washing…

1137
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:49,202
… but I am radically passionate
in teaching children…

1138
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:52,545
… about their responsibilities
as Christians…

1139
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,983
… as God fearing people,
*****…

1140
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:56,818
Woa, Becky,
let me ask you this:

1141
01:15:57,085 --> 01:16:00,111
How do we ignore that all of this
sadden??? were creating…

1142
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:03,318
… children soldiers
for the Republican Party?

1143
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:04,686
How... How is that figuring…

1144
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,552
…to anything that Christ had to say about…

1145
01:16:06,829 --> 01:16:08,558
… how we should live
our life on the Earth?

1146
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:12,530
It is… I am not safe…
I am not aware of any churches…

1147
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,736
… that **** with that political cause.

1148
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,364
I… I am not going after
my kids politically…

1149
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,075
… but that, you know… because
at the same time I wanna say…

1150
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,343
… that I don't have any problem
saying to my children:

1151
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:24,668
"We are Pro life."

1152
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:26,940
I got to tell you God
is watching us…

1153
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:30,008
… God has… and I…
And God has a very special place…

1154
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:32,053
… for those people
who mess with our children.

1155
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:33,381
- It is not a pretty place.
- You know what?

1156
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:34,913
I am not going to go there, Mike.

1157
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,921
You know, what's always made
this country special?

1158
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,123
What's always set
this country apart?

1159
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:42,760
… is because there is
something that we called: …

1160
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:45,056
… a separation between
Church and State.

1161
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,427
That's always something
that separates us…

1162
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,769
… and has separated us
for 200 years.

1163
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,069
It is worked.

1164
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,433
I respect your right
is fundamentalist…

1165
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,770
… to teach your children
whatever you wanna teach them…

1166
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:58,238
… but don't let that bleed over
into the public sector.

1167
01:16:58,414 --> 01:17:00,011
Don't let that bleed over
into the schools.

1168
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,710
I *** with you,
Christianity is important.

1169
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:04,682
We believe it's the most
important religion in the world…

1170
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:06,553
… because it changes
the life of people.

1171
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:10,249
But Becky, it's a witches brew:
it's gonna take over democracy.

1172
01:17:10,526 --> 01:17:11,918
You know,
I think democracy…

1173
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:14,389
… is the greatest political system
on Earth…

1174
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,554
… ***,
it's the only… the only…

1175
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,500
… it's the *** on Earth, 
you know…

1176
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,801
… and*** it is designed
to destroy itself …

1177
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:23,663
… because we have to give
evreyone the equal freedom…

1178
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:26,033
… and ***
it will destroy us.

1179
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,438
And so perfect world
it is not going to be perfect…

1180
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,209
… until Jesus
is truly Lord.

1181
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,844
Ok. Becky,
thanks for joining us. Ok.

1182
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,783
***

1183
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,716
Aw, man!

1184
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:43,451
The more I hear about this…

1185
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:46,953
… that is to say, every time
it is getting crazier and crazier.

1186
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:07,675
On this vote,
*** are 58, ****are 42.

1187
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,680
The presidence nomination 
of Samuel A. Alito Jr…

1188
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,745
… of New Jersey
to be associate justice…

1189
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,684
… of the Supreme Court
of the United States…

1190
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,556
… is confirmed.

1191
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:37,268
 I love America,
I love the American life style...

1192
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,872
... and to be part of 21st century.

1193
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:44,310
I wake up every day excited about
what I'm gonna do…

1194
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,679
… but at the same time I look at 
this sick old world…

1195
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:49,080
… and I **: God, 
let's get out of here.

1196
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:01,301
Knowing what I know…

1197
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:04,536
… how do I not give 
my whole life…

1198
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:09,610
… to helping other people:
children, teenagers or adults…

1199
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:12,706
…come to a saving knowledge
of Jesus Christ.

1200
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:15,940
How can I enjoy heaven?…

1201
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,648
… with the knwoledge
that I never told people…

1202
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:22,087
… that it matters so much to me...
about Jesus.

1203
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:28,161
That is not a burden, 
it is the greatest joy of my life.

1204
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,195
The most religious nation
in the world is India.

1205
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:37,805
The most irreligious nation
in the world is Sweden.

1206
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,999
We are a nation of Indians
ruled by Swed's??.

1207
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:45,375
As Christians, you are the leaders,
you speak for God.

1208
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:48,544
We cared about our country.
And what I wanna say is…

1209
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,912
…we want to get our message out. 
We can't *** down to she said:…

1210
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:53,845
… you just **** your message down 
to single sentences???.

1211
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:55,414
Let me give you some 
single sentences.

1212
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:57,922
Number one:

1213
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:01,425
Number two:
liberalism is dead.

1214
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:07,206

1215
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:13,870
Number four:

1216
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:18,509
And number five:

1217
01:20:23,519 --> 01:20:25,077

01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:10,164
# Gonna go to the place that's the best #

1222

# Goin' up to the spirit in the sky #
# [Spirit in the sky] #

1225
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,870
# That's where I'm gonna go when I die #
# [When I die] #

1226
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,215

- Hi...

1228
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:35,488

01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,455

that you would go?

1230
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:42,456

- Yeah.
- Ok.

1232

# Prepare yourself, you know it's a must #

1233
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:54,408
# Gotta have a friend in Jesus #

1234
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:56,041
I think that they were Muslim.

1235
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,846
# So you know that when you die #

1236
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:02,049
# He's gonna recommend you to the spirit in the sky #

1241
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:14,760

1245
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,766
Pamphlets in our hands.

1246
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,240
~ God has been so good to you
you have to *** ~

1247
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:31,777

magnify the Lord ~
