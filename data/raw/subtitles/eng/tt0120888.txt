1
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:20,590
All right, everybody, come on.

2
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,429
Out on the dance floor.

3
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,149
Look at the happy couple.

4
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:27,870
No exceptions.
Up out of your chairs.

5
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,989
I can feel
all the happiness in here.

6
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,910
All right!

7
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:44,749
Look at him go.

8
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,350
If I...

9
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:51,950
I get to know your name...

10
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:55,270
If I...

11
00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:00,429
Could trace
your private number, baby...

12
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,550
All I know is that to me...

13
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:04,149
You look like
you're lots of fun.

14
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,069
Open up them lovin' arms.

15
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,669
I want some, want some.

16
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,189
I set my sights on you.

17
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:14,870
And no one else will do.

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,469
And I...

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,069
I got to have my way now, baby.

20
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,389
All I know is that to me...

21
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:26,150
You look like
you're lots of fun.

22
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,750
Open up them lovin' arms.

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,149
Watch out, here I come.

24
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,749
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

25
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,229
Like a record, baby...

26
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,469
Right round, round, round.

27
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,070
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

28
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,470
Like a record, baby...

29
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,989
Right round, round, round.

30
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,429
Somebody get some pants
on that kid.

31
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,670
If I...

32
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,709
I got to be your friend...

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,589
Grandma Molly,
I'm talking to you.

34
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,990
And I...

35
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:06,229
Would like to move in
just a little bit closer.

36
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:08,029
All I know is that to me...

37
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,870
You look like
you're lots of fun.

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,790
Open up your lovin' arms.

39
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,990
Watch out, here I come.

40
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,550
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

41
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,629
Like a record, baby...

42
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,030
Right round, round, round.

43
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:24,789
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

44
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,630
Like a record, baby.

45
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:33,750
I want your love.

46
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:42,390
Uncle Marty!

47
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,549
All I know is that to me...

48
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,309
You look like
you're lots of fun.

49
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,949
Open up your lovin' arms.

50
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,269
Watch out, here I come.

51
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:54,030
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

52
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,390
Like a record, baby...

53
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,709
Right round, round, round.

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,269
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

55
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,749
Like a record, baby...

56
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:04,350
Right round, round, round.

57
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:07,630
You spin me round...

58
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,590
And round...

59
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,829
And round.

60
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,109
Very nice.

61
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,870
Good job, lady.
You were shakin'.

62
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,830
It is gonna be fun today.

63
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,590
The best man's gonna come up
and say a few words...

64
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:25,669
so let's put our hands together
for the groom's brother David.

65
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,629
All right, Dave.

66
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,109
When my brother Harold
asked me to be the best man...

67
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,710
I was like,
"Whoa, of course, man...

68
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,429
"because you've always
been there for me."

69
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,830
Like when I was in rehab...

70
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,350
and like the time
I couldn't find my car.

71
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,029
'Cause, Harold, he's always been
the dependable one.

72
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:04,550
I've always been
the screwed-up one. Right, Dad?

73
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,549
"Why can't you
be more like your brother?

74
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:12,309
"Harold would never
beat up his landlord."

75
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,230
He's drunk as shit.

76
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,150
But...

77
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:22,189
a little news flash, Pop.

78
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,029
Harold ain't so perfect.

79
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,310
Remember that time
in Puerto Rico...

80
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:31,109
when we picked up those two...

81
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,670
I guess they were prostitutes,
but I don't remember paying.

82
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,189
How about that?

83
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:37,829
Terrific.

84
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,589
I'm a person, too,
Pop, goddamn it!

85
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,030
You're a moron!

86
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,469
The best man, everybody.

87
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,150
Best man. The better man.

88
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,269
We've all done crazy things
in our life, so...

89
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,750
He's playing the guitar now.
Isn't that great?

90
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:01,510
He's doing good.

91
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:02,669
Sounds good?

92
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,790
It's because I'm the best
guitar player in the world.

93
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:06,270
Self-taught.

94
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,990
No lessons,
thank you very much, Pop.

95
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,150
All right.

96
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:12,549
They'll be divorced in a year.

97
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,990
Very good.

98
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:17,869
I think we all know
that when you fall in love...

99
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,870
the emptiness
kind of drifts away.

100
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:21,589
That's all I'm talking about.

101
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,510
I've done some crazy things
in my life, too...

102
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,270
but then I met
a very special girl...

103
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:29,070
a girl who I'm actually
marrying next week.

104
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:31,829
Thank you.

105
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:35,549
So all I'm saying is that
when you fall in love...

106
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:37,469
the emptiness drifts away...

107
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,109
because you find something
to live for...

108
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:40,109
each other.

109
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,029
And the way
I've seen you two...

110
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,710
looking into each other's
eyes all day long...

111
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,549
I can tell that you're
gonna live for each other...

112
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:46,750
for the rest of your lives.

113
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,190
So cheers.

114
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,309
That's a good
wedding singer.

115
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,829
Now on behalf of
Mr. and Mrs. Harold Veltri...

116
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,909
you guys have a nice dinner.

117
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,110
George Stitzer's gonna take over
on lead vocals...

118
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,469
so take it away, George.

119
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,229
Give me time...

120
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:27,429
To realize my crime.

121
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:35,190
Let me love and stay.

122
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,669
-Jesus.
-Scary.

123
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:45,269
I have danced...

124
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:48,710
I like her.

125
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,190
Inside your eyes.

126
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,990
How can love...

127
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:00,869
Be real?

128
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:05,590
Do you really want to hurt me?

129
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,549
Good save, wedding singer.

130
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:09,990
Good job.

131
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,870
Sammy, how come you're not out
with your limo? What's up?

132
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,550
That new waitress.
That's what's up.

133
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,909
Is she in trouble.

134
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:18,670
She's gonna get it,
and she doesn't even know it...

135
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:19,910
and I'm gonna give it to her.

136
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,429
Take it easy, man. Who is she?

137
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,870
She's Holly Sullivan's cousin.

138
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,429
If she's
half as easy as Holly...

139
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,150
I'll close this deal
by the end of the week.

140
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:31,029
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

141
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:33,310
Please. It's her first day.

142
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,789
Always takes them three weeks...

143
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,590
to realize they shouldn't
date anyone at work.

144
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,829
You like being the guy
that helps them realize that?

145
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,349
Yes, I do.

146
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,389
You want to be like Fonzie,
don't you?

147
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,309
You're on your way.

148
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:52,390
Do you really want to hurt me?

149
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:55,830
Do you really want
to make me cry?

150
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:06,510
Prime rib, please.

151
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,709
Always the prime rib.
Make them eat the fish.

152
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:11,629
Andre,
can I have three prime rib?

153
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,989
Your wish is my command, madame.

154
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:18,109
How come he's so nice to you?

155
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,829
I let him look at my boobs
at the Christmas party.

156
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:23,149
Not my finest half-hour...

157
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,150
but it's been a pleasant
working environment ever since.

158
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,990
So, how's your first night
going?

159
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,150
Being at this wedding
is making me realize...

160
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:38,070
that Glenn is never
going to set a date...

161
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:40,230
and I've been wearing
this ring for two years...

162
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,709
and I feel like an idiot.

163
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,430
You know what you must do?

164
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:47,429
Relax. Don't do it.

165
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:54,230
I feel stupid for moving here
to be closer to him.

166
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,069
I think you need a break.
Go out back and get some air.

167
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,029
I'll cover your tables.

168
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,390
You OK?

169
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,829
You going to throw up?

170
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,309
Come with me, man.

171
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,309
Give me time...

172
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,709
What?

173
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,310
Here we go.

174
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,029
Come on.

175
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,310
You got it. There.

176
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,630
Is he a friend of yours?

177
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,789
Me? No.

178
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:33,990
I couldn't let him do it
in front of his family.

179
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,110
Wow.

180
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:38,030
I'm glad I got to see it.

181
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,069
You all through?

182
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,510
Going to wait a few years
before you drink again?

183
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,229
All right, remember,
alcohol equals puke...

184
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,790
equals smelly mess
equals nobody likes you.

185
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,510
I got it from here.

186
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,829
Know what? You go this way,
and you go this way.

187
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:57,510
It's for the best.
It's all right. Take it easy.

188
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:59,670
See you later.
Sleep it off, pal.

189
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,109
Hey, you know,
wedding singer?

190
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:10,549
Are you drinking, too?

191
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,230
No. It's Coca-cola.

192
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,029
Are you sure? There's
no rum in that Coca-cola?

193
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:17,989
I'm not a big drinker...

194
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,029
and if it was, I'd be puking
more than that kid.

195
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,349
I don't think anybody could
puke more than that kid.

196
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,750
I think I saw a boot come out.

197
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,389
You're the wedding singer.

198
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,670
How you doing? I'm Robbie.

199
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,150
I'm Julia.

200
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,390
I'm actually waitressing
at your wedding next week.

201
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:37,110
Cool. That's a beautiful ring
you have there.

202
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,309
Are you getting married, too?

203
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,189
Actually, I don't know
how serious the guy is...

204
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:45,190
who gave this to me.

205
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,710
I feel like I'm doomed to wander
the planet alone forever.

206
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,109
Like the Incredible Hulk?

207
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,229
Yeah...only
I'm not helping people.

208
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,990
That's not true,
because I saw you inside.

209
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,510
You were helping people.

210
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,469
You were giving them
fish and coffee and forks.

211
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:05,989
People can't eat without forks.

212
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,149
And they can't
drink without a fish.

213
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,789
That's right.
What does that mean?

214
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,509
I don't know.
You lost me back at the Hulk.

215
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:16,070
Robbie, you better
get back in there.

216
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,669
They're starting
to turn on George.

217
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,670
-Sit down!
-You suck!

218
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,389
He's got to learn a new song.

219
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,470
But it was nice to meet you.

220
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,789
It was nice meeting you, too.

221
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:30,829
And if I ever get married,
maybe you'll sing at my wedding.

222
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,510
Oh, man. It's a deal.

223
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,870
Take care.

224
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,149
There was love...

225
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,629
All around...

226
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,389
But I never...

227
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,790
Heard it singing.

228
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:48,109
Very nice.

229
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,110
No, I never...

230
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,109
Heard it at all...

231
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,070
Pretty.

232
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,909
'Til there was you.

233
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,150
Much better.

234
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,670
You're going
to blow everybody away...

235
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,190
at your fiftieth
anniversary party.

236
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,269
If I sing to Frank
without making any mistakes...

237
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,189
he would know
how hard I've worked...

238
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,630
and how much I still love him
after all these years.

239
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,389
I hope 50 years from now...

240
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,350
Linda and I are as happy
as you two guys.

241
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,469
You will be.
It runs in your family.

242
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,909
You're a born romantic,
just like your father was.

243
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,990
I know they'll be
looking down on you tomorrow.

244
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:25,389
I hope so.

245
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:26,749
Are you nervous?

246
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,429
I'm actually not
that nervous, you know?

247
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,670
I'm at weddings all the time.
It's going to be fun.

248
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,309
Not about the wedding--
about the wedding night.

249
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:37,069
Will this be your first time
with intercourse?

250
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,270
Don't be ashamed.

251
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,750
When I got married,
I wasn't a virgin.

252
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:46,870
I already had intercourse
with eight men.

253
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:50,470
That's actually something
I don't want to know about.

254
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:54,349
That was a lot back then.
That would be like 200 today.

255
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,469
It's 5:00.
I'm going to get going.

256
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,110
But your payment.

257
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,789
My payment.
Can I get it to go?

258
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,990
You're such a sweet boy...

259
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,910
letting an old woman
pay you with meatballs.

260
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:10,190
They taste so good,
it's like I'm ripping you off.

261
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,389
I don't have
any clean Tupperware.

262
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,629
All right,
definitely next time.

263
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,949
Don't be silly.
Now hold out your hands.

264
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,149
-You want to--
-Do it.

265
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:25,189
Cool.

266
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:26,469
Thanks a lot.

267
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,309
Now, please, take a bite...

268
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:34,310
so that I can
watch you enjoy.

269
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,149
That's my favorite part.

270
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:39,069
Well...
I'll go with the right one.

271
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,070
That looks good.

272
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:47,630
That's a good meatball.

273
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:52,310
Now, listen to me, Robbie Hart.

274
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:55,389
You're going to be
a fine husband.

275
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,910
I hope so, Rosie. Thank you.

276
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,310
I'm going to leave.

277
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:00,589
I'll see you
at the wedding, all right?

278
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,949
Thank you for coming in
and taking me to lunch.

279
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,510
Look at the picture
of that girl. See that?

280
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:18,269
You're a lot prettier
than that girl...

281
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:19,629
and she's getting married.

282
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:22,350
What does pretty have to do
with getting married?

283
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:24,309
Everything.
You got to get married...

284
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:27,030
before your hips start spreading
and you get facial hair...

285
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:29,990
which, by the way,
comes from your father's mother.

286
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,910
Looks like Magnum, P.I.,
for God's sake.

287
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:35,869
I can't make Glenn set a date.

288
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,029
You're going to hate
this idea...

289
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,270
but I think you should consider
a fake pregnancy.

290
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,510
I'm exiting the car.

291
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,069
It's just a means to an end.

292
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:49,309
ln five years,
he'll thank you for it.

293
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,590
Perhaps we should call her.

294
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,029
She's probably got
a make-up problem or her dress.

295
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,670
I know her.
She likes to look her best.

296
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,229
Hey, sis.

297
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:32,430
Hi, Robs.

298
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:35,430
I just got off the phone
with Linda's mom.

299
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,030
Linda's not there, but...

300
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,150
there was a note.

301
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,630
A note?

302
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:43,270
Everything all right?

303
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,669
Yeah, she's OK.

304
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,029
It basically indicated...

305
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,029
that Linda was...

306
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,909
not coming today.

307
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,190
So, it was a bad note.

308
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:02,470
Did she say why?

309
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:07,749
I am so sorry, honey.

310
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,789
It's OK.

311
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,429
You want me to say something?

312
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:18,070
Just give me a second.
I'll be right back.

313
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:22,029
Oh, my God,
she's not showing up.

314
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,549
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

315
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,150
It's OK.

316
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,510
Oh, God!

317
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:57,350
You can't catch me!

318
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,070
I'm going to get you
and chop you up!

319
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:02,629
Can we turn this crap off,
please?

320
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,509
That's right, Robbie.
You have to let it out.

321
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,669
-Let what out?
-Your feelings.

322
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,309
About what that lousy bitch
did to you today.

323
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,350
Don't call her that...

324
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:12,670
because we're going
to get back together...

325
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,590
and then there will be weirdness
between you and me...

326
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,629
so just watch it.

327
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,710
I made this for you,
Uncle Robbie.

328
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,910
Thanks, Freddy Krueger.

329
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,150
That's not nice.

330
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,229
Very creative, though.

331
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:26,749
Go back to the boiler room.

332
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,670
I just wish I knew
where she was, you know?

333
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:35,789
He's taking it pretty bad.

334
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:37,869
He's acting like a real robot...

335
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,629
a zombie or something.

336
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:42,429
He's been wanting to get married
since the third grade.

337
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,030
It makes sense.
That's when Mom and Dad died.

338
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,469
He wants to start
a family of his own.

339
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:48,949
Check out the cake.

340
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:51,630
There's only
a little groom on top.

341
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,950
You're late.

342
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:14,189
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:15,749
I just couldn't do it.

344
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,750
If you need some more time,
I guess I can wait.

345
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:25,110
No, I don't need
more time, Robbie.

346
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:26,470
I don't ever want to marry you.

347
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:32,149
You know, that information...

348
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:35,390
might have been a little
more useful to me yesterday.

349
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:39,149
I've been talking to my friends
the last couple of days...

350
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:40,910
Here it comes.

351
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:44,389
And I think I figured out
what's been bothering me.

352
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,469
I'm not in love with Robbie now.

353
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,950
I'm in love with Robbie
six years ago...

354
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:52,069
Robbie, the lead singer
of Final Warning...

355
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:53,989
when I used to come and
watch you from the front row...

356
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,069
in your spandex pants...

357
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,150
your silk shirt unbuttoned...

358
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:02,069
licking the microphone
like David Lee Roth.

359
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,429
I still got the spandex.
I'll put them on right now.

360
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,270
The point is,
I woke up this morning...

361
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:09,509
and I realized I'm about
to marry a wedding singer.

362
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,910
I am never going
to leave Ridgefield.

363
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:13,790
Why do you need
to leave Ridgefield?

364
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,749
We grew up here.
All our friends are here.

365
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,829
It's the perfect place
to raise a family.

366
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,269
Living in your sister's
basement with five kids...

367
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,030
while you're off every
weekend doing wedding gigs...

368
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:24,910
at a whopping 60 bucks a pop?

369
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,389
Once again...

370
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,269
things that could have been
brought to my attention...

371
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,349
yesterday!

372
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:34,270
The fact is,
we grew apart a long time ago.

373
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:37,709
You wanted to get married.
You didn't care to who.

374
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:40,830
That's not true. I love you.
Come here.

375
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:44,229
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

376
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,590
Hey, Linda.

377
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:48,549
You're a bitch.

378
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:54,030
Thanks, Petey.
Go back to the house.

379
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,029
He might have
Tourette's syndrome.

380
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,389
We're looking into it.

381
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,030
I got to go.

382
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,069
I'm sorry.

383
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:25,150
Ninety-nine Luftballons...

384
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,189
Glenn!

385
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,349
Don't be so jumpy.

386
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:33,510
These are for you.

387
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:34,949
Thank you.

388
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,789
They're beautiful.

389
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:42,270
I have something else for you.

390
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:49,270
Two airplane tickets
to Las Vegas?

391
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,949
Oh, my God, Glenn!

392
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,670
I know you wanted
to set a date...

393
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,749
so I went to the travel agent
and set it.

394
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,229
Glenn, I love you so much...

395
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,350
but Las Vegas? I thought--

396
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,349
Jules, it's the romance
capital of the world.

397
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,870
I just don't want
a big wedding--

398
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,510
hundreds of people
we don't know...

399
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,470
that are just there
for the free drinks...

400
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:14,469
and all-you-can-eat buffet.

401
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,430
They might as well be in Vegas.

402
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,630
Las Vegas it is,
and it'll be great.

403
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:29,070
Are you going to do
the girl thing?

404
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:32,269
You're going to act happy
and be pouting on the inside?

405
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,309
I'm happy.

406
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:41,229
All right.

407
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:42,829
Let's get married here.

408
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,630
I know that's what you want.

409
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,469
Thank you, Glenn.

410
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:50,190
It's more important
to you anyway.

411
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:54,150
I promise I will give you
the most beautiful wedding...

412
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,109
and even you'll have
a good time.

413
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:21,829
It's about time
his best friend showed up.

414
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,549
So, how's he doing?

415
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:24,949
I don't know.

416
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,910
He's been down in the basement
since it happened.

417
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:29,869
Five days now.

418
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:33,910
I think he's having some kind
of a mental situation...

419
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,349
an episode or something.

420
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,750
All right.

421
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,990
You do something, because
I don't want to be known...

422
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,190
as the brother-in-law
of the town nut job.

423
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,590
I got enough problems already.

424
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:47,709
Shit,
I got water all over myself.

425
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,589
Hello?

426
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,349
You all right?

427
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:14,469
These sheets are soft.
You use Downy?

428
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,670
All Tempa-Cheer.

429
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,590
You can wash your clothes
at any temperature...

430
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,510
and the colors
don't run together.

431
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,630
-Really?
-Yeah. Now leave me alone.

432
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,149
You have to go back to work.

433
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,269
There's going to be over
a hundred drunk girls...

434
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:33,389
at this wedding tonight.

435
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,909
I've got nothing
to offer anybody.

436
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,110
I haven't done jack shit
since high school.

437
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,070
Why would any girl
ever marry me?

438
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:41,749
Marry you?

439
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,709
I'm just trying to get someone
to play with your ding-dong.

440
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,869
Holiday...

441
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:54,109
Celebrate...

442
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:07,470
If we took a holiday...

443
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:11,030
Took some time to celebrate...

444
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,909
Come on, let's celebrate.

445
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,389
Just one day out of life...

446
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,110
It would be...

447
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,349
It would be so nice.

448
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:25,789
Everybody spread the word.

449
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,950
I live in
my sister's basement.

450
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,150
He just had his heart broken.

451
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:35,870
Why would he even think
about coming back to work?

452
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,469
I don't know.

453
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,029
Celebrate.

454
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:53,189
You guys are off
to a great start.

455
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:54,670
I mean...

456
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:57,270
Cindy showed up,
so, right away, Scott...

457
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:58,669
you got to be pretty psyched.

458
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,470
I'm not paying you to hear
your thoughts on life.

459
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:03,789
I'm paying you to sing.

460
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:08,750
I have a microphone,
and you don't...

461
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,589
so you will listen
to every damn word...

462
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:13,310
I have to say!

463
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:24,229
It's funny. Some of us
will never find true love.

464
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,870
Like, take, for instance...me.

465
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,909
And I'm pretty sure
that guy right there.

466
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,150
And that lady
with the sideburns.

467
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:39,429
And basically
everybody at table nine.

468
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,989
But the worst thing is...

469
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:48,749
that me, fatty,
sideburns lady...

470
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,510
and the mutants
over at table nine...

471
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,629
will never, ever find a way
to better the situation...

472
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:57,669
because...

473
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:01,229
apparently, we have
absolutely nothing to offer...

474
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,749
the opposite sex.

475
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,670
You are the worst wedding singer
in the world, buddy!

476
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:08,710
Sir, one more outburst...

477
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,030
I will strangle you
with my microphone wire.

478
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,509
Let's cut the stupid cake...

479
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:17,390
because the fat guy's
going to have a heart attack...

480
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:18,750
if we don't eat again soon.

481
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:24,630
And while we do that,
here's a little mood music.

482
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,309
Cindy and Scott are newlyweds.

483
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:42,149
He loves her...

484
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,709
But she loves
this guy right here...

485
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:47,270
And he loves somebody else.

486
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:50,109
You just can't win.

487
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,029
And so it goes...

488
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,869
Until the day you die.

489
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:57,270
This thing they call love...

490
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,470
Is gonna make you cry.

491
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:00,629
I hate you.

492
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:02,630
I've had the blues...

493
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:05,349
The reds and the pinks.

494
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,909
One thing's for sure...

495
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,870
Love stinks?

496
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,430
Love stinks.

497
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:34,789
Drug addict! Degenerate!

498
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,870
I was wondering
what happened to you.

499
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,549
Did everybody leave?

500
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,949
Pretty much,
except for a few cops...

501
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:14,469
that are still interviewing
some witnesses.

502
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:21,149
I'm going to get
the hell out of here.

503
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:24,749
So it was
your first wedding back.

504
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,029
Of course things are going
to be a little shaky.

505
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:29,509
A little shaky?
I hate weddings.

506
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:32,630
I hate the bride.
I hate the groom.

507
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,589
I want them to be miserable,
because that's what I am.

508
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,550
No. You're the best.

509
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,990
At what? People eat
prime rib, and I sing.

510
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:44,390
It's a joke.
I can't do this anymore.

511
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,110
Glenn and I set the date...

512
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:50,030
so you have to play our wedding.

513
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,509
Congratulations.

514
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,630
I just can't do it, all right?

515
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,990
I'm having an engagement party
in two weeks...

516
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:04,150
and I really want
you and Sammy to come.

517
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:26,709
Good, you're here.

518
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:29,110
Robbie's here!
Let's move it!

519
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,949
The kids have been fed,
but if they want snacks...

520
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:34,190
there's ice pops in the freezer,
or microwave popcorn.

521
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,469
Good.

522
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:37,029
Are you going
to the engagement party?

523
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,789
Yeah, I'll probably go.

524
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,349
Come on, Andy, move your ass!

525
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:44,230
Hang on. I'm watching Dallas.

526
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:46,629
I think J.R. might be dead.
They shot him.

527
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,589
Good night.

528
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,550
-Love you.
-Love you.

529
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,589
Time to make the donuts.

530
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,710
I made the donuts.

531
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,470
Dunkin' donuts--
up to 52 varieties...

532
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:57,230
Uncle Robbie's here.

533
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,669
Hey, the Goofball Brothers.

534
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:04,230
ls it true you're in the middle
of a nervous breakdown?

535
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,150
-Who said that?
-Everybody.

536
00:30:10,189 --> 00:30:12,430
You're eight years old.
You only know your parents.

537
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,670
What are you talking about?

538
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,349
Is it true you're gonna end up
in a mental institution?

539
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:18,429
Cuckoo's nest!

540
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:20,789
Hey, kids.

541
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,670
Remember what we talked about?

542
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,670
Go over there
and watch some television.

543
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:30,509
Can I speak to you for a second?

544
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,070
Everybody...

545
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,750
I've been thinking
about what happened to you...

546
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:38,189
and it's all for the best.

547
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,710
I know you were
in love and everything...

548
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,789
but that wears off.

549
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,110
Me and your sister,
we used to be wild.

550
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:47,109
She was very adventurous...

551
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,949
and we got into some crazy shit.

552
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:51,589
But now the thrill is gone.

553
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:54,789
If we get a second alone,
we usually go to sleep.

554
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,310
If it's a special occasion...

555
00:30:57,349 --> 00:31:00,070
she might do
this exotic dance for me.

556
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,509
What?

557
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,829
Sometimes she might
work with my nipples a bit.

558
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,549
All right, enough. Go out.

559
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:08,349
I'll take care of the kids.

560
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,430
I don't know what I just said,
but I said something.

561
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:22,109
Women got a thing
about marriage.

562
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,229
If you want to stay with them,
you're gonna have to marry them.

563
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,430
No big deal. There she is.

564
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,750
The girl who finally beat me
into submission.

565
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,870
That's right.

566
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,109
August 5th
is less than three months away.

567
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:36,189
We've got a lot of planning
to do.

568
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:38,150
Do you think
it would be better...

569
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,910
if maybe you took over
all the arrangements?

570
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,230
I'd like to do it together.

571
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,350
Yeah, but you like this stuff.

572
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,829
It's really not my thing.

573
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,750
God forbid I screw up
the wedding flowers.

574
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:54,110
How could I live with myself?

575
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:55,269
He'll be so wasted...

576
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,350
he won't know flowers
are at the wedding.

577
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:03,069
I hear you're gonna have
your bachelor party Friday.

578
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:07,110
Gonna be all right with that?
You might miss Miami Vice.

579
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,469
Nope. Summer. Reruns.
I'm all set.

580
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:12,829
Great.

581
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,789
All right, nice house.

582
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,710
I told you this guy was loaded.

583
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:23,949
I know. In and out, though.
I don't want to be here long.

584
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:26,509
Let me just pick up a chick,
and we'll get out of here.

585
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,230
What do you think
of the jacket?

586
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,749
I would lose that glove.
You look nuts.

587
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:33,829
There's Julia.

588
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:37,430
Let's go say hello.

589
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,709
Hi, you guys.

590
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,390
I'm so glad you came.

591
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:44,590
Jason,
this is Robbie and Sammy...

592
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,989
and this is my fiance Glenn.

593
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,189
-Congratulations, Glenn.
-Thank you.

594
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,310
Robbie Hart.

595
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,949
I heard what happened
to you at your wedding.

596
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:56,869
That was so cold.
You must have felt like shit.

597
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,989
No. It felt really good.
Thanks for bringing it up.

598
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,790
My parents died when I was 10.
Want to talk about that?

599
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,869
Why would we want
to talk about that?

600
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:07,310
I don't know.

601
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,870
Somebody needs a drink.

602
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:10,989
Actually,
I'm not a big drinker.

603
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,749
I am.
How about an Alabama Slammer?

604
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:13,869
Sounds like a plan.

605
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,789
Meet me at the bar.
I gotta piss first.

606
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:17,989
Have a few drinks
and drive home.

607
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,310
Julia, thanks for inviting us.

608
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:25,070
I'm glad you guys came.
We hang out at work so much...

609
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,230
but we don't get to talk
'cause we're always so busy.

610
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,950
We should make time to talk,
don't you think?

611
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:36,469
Know what? The first time
this guy saw you...

612
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:38,669
he told me
he was gonna hit on you.

613
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:41,189
-Really?
-That's not true.

614
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,909
Yeah, it is.
You told me she was in trouble.

615
00:33:43,949 --> 00:33:46,629
She was gonna get it,
and she didn't even know it.

616
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,549
He's teasing.
I would never say that.

617
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:51,110
You said you were
gonna give it to her.

618
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:53,030
Give me what, exactly?

619
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:54,550
You're a jerk.

620
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:56,909
What do you mean?
You didn't know she was engaged.

621
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,750
So now you're not
gonna give it to me?

622
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,389
Very funny.

623
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,830
Say hi to your brother Tito.

624
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:08,390
So how are you doing?

625
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:11,349
I'm doing better. I don't know.

626
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,709
How are you and Glenn doing
with the wedding plans?

627
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,630
Glenn isn't really--
He's very busy right now.

628
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:23,590
He works on Wall Street.
You know how that is nowadays.

629
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,510
Wall Street--stocks and stuff?

630
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,590
Actually, he's in bonds.

631
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:30,910
He barely has time to sleep,
let alone plan a wedding...

632
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,550
so I'm kind of doing this
on my own.

633
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:35,510
But I went to Marshall's
for the floral centerpieces.

634
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,909
Marshall's?
You should go to Tony's.

635
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,510
They're cheaper, and
they've got a great selection.

636
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:43,429
All right.
Well, thank you for the tip.

637
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,670
It's a shame you won't be
doing weddings anymore.

638
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,989
We won't get
to hang out as much.

639
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,309
We'll get to hang out.

640
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:52,589
There's other things to do
besides weddings, right?

641
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,709
Oy, oy, bar mitzvah...

642
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,789
Mazel tov...

643
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:18,789
L'chaim !

644
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:21,869
Let's keep the fun rolling.
Take it away, George.

645
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:37,510
Do you really want to hurt me?

646
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:41,950
You seem kind of sad.

647
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,590
Why don't you
get out there and dance?

648
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:46,870
I asked that girl over there.
She turned me down.

649
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:49,709
She said she didn't dance
with losers.

650
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,350
Man. That hurts.

651
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:55,149
But why would you want
to dance with somebody...

652
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:57,710
who doesn't want
to dance with you? Right?

653
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,710
Listen, don't worry.

654
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,229
You're gonna meet a girl
who treats you right someday.

655
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:04,550
I promise you.

656
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,069
How you guys doing?
All right?

657
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,149
I want you to meet
a friend of mine...

658
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,909
by the name of Julia Sullivan.

659
00:36:13,189 --> 00:36:15,550
Could you come out here
for a second?

660
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,990
Say hi to Julia, everybody.

661
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,029
Hello.

662
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,149
Now, who of you out there
would like to dance...

663
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:23,630
with this fine-looking woman?

664
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:29,629
I'd like to do more
than dance with her.

665
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:32,550
Wow, Julia.

666
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:34,550
Sounds to me
like you got your pick...

667
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,510
of any man in this room
to dance with...

668
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,430
so I want you
to take your time...

669
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:43,110
and find amongst all these
young studs here tonight...

670
00:36:43,149 --> 00:36:46,229
the coolest, most un-losery guy
in the bunch.

671
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,229
Pick me.

672
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:52,590
Please pick me.

673
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,070
May I have this dance?

674
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:11,989
OK, pal, have fun.

675
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,470
I can only give you love...

676
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:24,550
That lasts forever...

677
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:28,070
And a promise to be near...

678
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,229
Each time you call...

679
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,310
And the only heart I own...

680
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,230
For you and you alone...

681
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,669
That's all.

682
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:46,870
All I have are these arms...

683
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,310
To enfold you.
Just go with it.

684
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:55,469
And a love
time can never destroy.

685
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,310
Take it, George.

686
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,790
Come here, Big Red.

687
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:36,869
If you're wondering
what I'm asking...

688
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:39,710
In return, dear...

689
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:41,389
You'll be glad to know...

690
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:46,550
That my demands are small.

691
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:50,950
Say it's me
that you'll adore...

692
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:53,229
For now and ever more.

693
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,149
That's all.

694
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:03,109
To the new lord of the ladies!

695
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,550
You're a lovely dancer.

696
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,149
-Are you gonna tell Glenn?
-About what?

697
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:17,869
About you and that kid
and him squeezing your tush?

698
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:21,229
He did have very strong
hands for a 13-year-old.

699
00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:22,350
I could see that.

700
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:25,750
By the way, thank you for
recommending Tony the florist.

701
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,950
His flowers were beautiful,
and he didn't overcharge me.

702
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,829
Good. I'm glad.

703
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,069
And a new girl in town...

704
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,190
could certainly use that kind
of help on everything.

705
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:35,309
You got Holly
and your mother, right?

706
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,429
My mother lives 50 miles away...

707
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:40,149
and Holly's
not into that kind of thing...

708
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,269
so that really only leaves
one person.

709
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:51,909
I would, but, you know,
I just--l can't.

710
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:53,549
I understand.

711
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:55,790
I just don't know
how to go about this.

712
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:59,309
I'm afraid I'm gonna pay $500
for a half-eaten wedding cake.

713
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,950
I really gotta concentrate
on getting some more gigs.

714
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:05,510
There's only four Jewish
families in this town.

715
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,589
All right.

716
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,909
I have never done it
for that cheap.

717
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:22,189
I know for a fact you gave
Eric Lamensoft that price.

718
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:24,350
I did not.

719
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,469
Faye, look at me.

720
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,590
Look me in the eyes.
I'm right here.

721
00:40:29,629 --> 00:40:32,550
Don't look away. Did you
give him that price or not?

722
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,270
OK. Just that one time.
So you got me.

723
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,549
Can I say something?

724
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:45,030
I deal with a lot of people,
but you two look truly happy.

725
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,830
You're gonna make it.
I know. Believe me.

726
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:48,829
How do you know?

727
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,189
You can just look at a couple...

728
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,990
and you can tell right away...

729
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,510
they're gonna
stay together forever.

730
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:58,350
Like Donald and Ivana...

731
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,869
and Woody and Mia...

732
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:04,189
and Burt and Loni.

733
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,709
We're not getting married.

734
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,630
That's right. Actually,
we're brother and sister.

735
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,070
So that's it.
I could sense a closeness.

736
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,110
The weird thing is,
when we were growing up...

737
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,789
we didn't get along 'cause
I used to do this to her.

738
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,390
We're gonna go now.
Come here, sis.

739
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,709
Your ass is grass.

740
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,709
I'm telling Mom
when we get home.

741
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,949
Yes, it's ladies' night...

742
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,990
And the feeling's right.

743
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,670
Yes, it's ladies' night.

744
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,190
Oh, what a...

745
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,150
Oh, what a night.

746
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:42,790
Yes, it's ladies' night...

747
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,430
And the feeling's right.

748
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,229
I've never seen it from
this perspective before.

749
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:48,629
Is this what I look like?

750
00:41:48,669 --> 00:41:51,190
No. You're much better
than him.

751
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:52,869
He's ridiculous.

752
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:53,829
One...

753
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,830
Romantic lady...

754
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,030
Single baby...

755
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:08,830
Sophisticated mama...

756
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:13,349
Come on, you disco lady.

757
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,590
Send me a line, mama.

758
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,229
Yes, it's ladies' night.

759
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,630
Oh, what a night!

760
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,229
Chaka Khan!

761
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,310
Thank you.
This is Jimmy Moore...

762
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:24,790
saying that ain't
no sock in my crotch.

763
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:27,070
Take four, everybody.

764
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,030
Jimmy, that was really good.
Thank you.

765
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:30,110
No. Thank you.

766
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,189
-For what?
-For quitting.

767
00:42:33,229 --> 00:42:36,870
Or...should I thank Linda?

768
00:42:36,909 --> 00:42:39,509
My business has tripled.

769
00:42:40,749 --> 00:42:45,269
You've just inspired
me to hire a D.J...

770
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,949
so thank you.

771
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:54,709
Good luck finding a D.J. who can
move and shake like this.

772
00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:02,829
How did you become
a wedding singer?

773
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,470
I think I got into it
to make some money...

774
00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:08,270
until my music career took off.

775
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:10,429
And you wanted to be
a rock star?

776
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,469
I kind of just wanted
to be a songwriter, you know?

777
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,870
That's the hardest thing,
to write a song.

778
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,910
A song that
when people hear it...

779
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:22,189
they go, "Ohh, I know
what that guy was feeling...

780
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:23,469
"when he wrote that."

781
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,590
Have you written anything
lately?

782
00:43:24,629 --> 00:43:26,750
Yeah, I guess.

783
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,270
Will you play it for me?

784
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,109
You don't want to hear it.
It's not good.

785
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,629
I'm sure it is.

786
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:35,110
I wrote half of it
when I was with Linda...

787
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,829
and I wrote the other half
after we broke up...

788
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,749
so it's a little uneven,
you know?

789
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,749
I don't mind.
I'd like to hear it.

790
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,310
Yeah, all right.

791
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:55,150
I just want to warn you
that when I wrote this song...

792
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,790
I was listening
to The Cure a lot, so...

793
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:00,589
Here we go.

794
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,070
You don't know...

795
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,950
How much...

796
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:09,349
I need you.

797
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:13,869
While you're near me...

798
00:44:13,909 --> 00:44:16,869
I don't feel blue.

799
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:21,070
And when we kiss...

800
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:25,310
I know you need me, too.

801
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:29,429
I can't believe
I found a love...

802
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:33,550
That's so pure and true...

803
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:37,030
But it all was bullshit.

804
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:41,349
It was a goddamn joke...

805
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:45,630
And when
I think of you, Linda...

806
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,549
I hope you fuckin' choke.

807
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:53,509
I hope you're glad...

808
00:44:53,549 --> 00:44:56,350
With what you've done to me.

809
00:44:57,469 --> 00:44:59,110
I lay in bed...

810
00:44:59,149 --> 00:45:01,189
All day long...

811
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:04,270
Feeling melancholy.

812
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:07,069
You left me here...

813
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:08,950
All alone...

814
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,670
Tears running constantly.

815
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:17,030
Oh, somebody kill me, please.

816
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,550
I'm on my knees.

817
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:24,669
Pretty, pretty please.

818
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,590
Kill me.

819
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,070
I want to die.

820
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:38,430
Put a bullet in my head.

821
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,429
I liked it.

822
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:45,830
He's losing his mind...

823
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:49,909
and I'm reaping
all the benefits.

824
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:03,950
Thank you for the ice cream.
It always cheers me up.

825
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,870
It's my pleasure.

826
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,189
I feel weird
being in this place.

827
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:10,309
We came here all the time.
We used to get chocolate shakes.

828
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:12,429
May I ask what happened
with Linda?

829
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:17,309
She wasn't the right one,
I guess.

830
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:19,909
Did you have any idea
she wasn't the right one...

831
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:21,510
when you were together?

832
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,309
I should have.

833
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,869
I remember we went
to the Grand Canyon once.

834
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,949
We were flying there,
and I'd never been before...

835
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,229
and Linda had,
so you would think...

836
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,509
that she would give me
the window seat...

837
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:38,189
but she didn't.

838
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:41,110
Not that that's a big deal,
you know?

839
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,350
But there were a lot of
little things like that.

840
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:45,869
-l know that sounds stupid.
-Not at all.

841
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,789
I think it's
the little things that count.

842
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:50,190
How did you know
that Glenn was the right one?

843
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:54,990
The right one.

844
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:57,789
I always just envisioned
the right one...

845
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,750
being someone I could
see myself growing old with.

846
00:47:04,229 --> 00:47:08,229
And Glenn will be a really
good-looking older man...

847
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:09,790
like Blake Carrington.

848
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,750
I'm gonna probably
look like Buddy Hackett.

849
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,909
Of course
I'm gonna hire him.

850
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,229
He's your best friend and
the only limo driver in town.

851
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:28,790
Yeah. I just like
having fun with him.

852
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,709
Wow. Look at him go.

853
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:39,910
Better move it, man.

854
00:48:41,509 --> 00:48:42,629
You're not gonna make it.

855
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,989
You hit 2 cones.
Those could have been people.

856
00:48:53,029 --> 00:48:54,590
Those could have been
guests at her wedding.

857
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:58,069
They were cones.

858
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:14,310
That was fun today.
Wasn't that fun?

859
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,110
That was fun.

860
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,509
-l got the job, right?
-Yeah, you did.

861
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:21,310
It's August 5th,
a week from today.

862
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,429
Someone left a jacket
in the back.

863
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:25,789
That's Julia's jacket.

864
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,549
Remember?
She took it off on Noxon Street.

865
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,229
She said it's not
jacket weather anymore.

866
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:33,189
-Uh-oh.
-What?

867
00:49:33,229 --> 00:49:35,429
-You like her.
-No, I don't.

868
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:37,989
Of course you do. She's
a cool chick with a hot ass.

869
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:40,229
You talk about her ass again,
I'll break your neck.

870
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,270
Anyway, she told me
she likes you.

871
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,030
Really?

872
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,349
She said that?

873
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,069
Think about it.

874
00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:52,429
It's gonna be your first
kiss as a married couple.

875
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:54,429
It's perfectly acceptable
to open your mouth.

876
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:57,309
I just would not want
to do that in a church...

877
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:59,829
in front of God
and all of our relatives.

878
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:02,790
It would gross them out
to see me like...

879
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:06,070
No one will ever solve that.

880
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,549
You forgot
your jacket in the limo.

881
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,629
Thank you for bringing it back.
That's so nice of you.

882
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,350
Yeah, it was.

883
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:19,189
I'll see you later, all right?
Have fun today.

884
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,709
Hey, wait a second.

885
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,949
Maybe...he can help us.

886
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,229
You're the expert on this.

887
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:27,150
We were just having a debate
about wedding kisses.

888
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,630
I say that it's OK for it
to be an open-mouth kiss.

889
00:50:30,669 --> 00:50:32,790
And I say that it's
the type of occasion...

890
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,750
where people dress up,
so it's not appropriate.

891
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:37,470
-l see.
-What do you want to do?

892
00:50:37,509 --> 00:50:40,070
Thin, tight mouth,
and it's over?

893
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:43,669
No. Thin, partially open.

894
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:45,069
No tongues, over.

895
00:50:45,069 --> 00:50:48,389
No tongue? Please. There
has got to be a little.

896
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,230
Maybe a little tongue.

897
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:52,589
Not porno tongue.
Church tongue.

898
00:50:52,589 --> 00:50:54,310
Church tongue. I like that.

899
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,069
Church tongue? What is that?

900
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,789
I don't know
how to describe it.

901
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:00,589
Well, show me.

902
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,550
Not on me.
How about on him?

903
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:09,629
You don't mind, do you?

904
00:51:09,669 --> 00:51:12,269
Come on, just hold still.
Julia, go ahead.

905
00:51:17,709 --> 00:51:19,710
Come on.
We're all adults here.

906
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,909
I'm gonna have to see it
to make an educated decision.

907
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:31,589
Well, if it's for
educational purposes.

908
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,189
Good. OK.
All right, you ready?

909
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,069
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

910
00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:39,310
You may kiss the bride.

911
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:06,750
Wow.

912
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:10,870
That...was...great.

913
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:13,350
Julia, you should do that
at the wedding.

914
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:17,229
I gave her the jacket.

915
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:19,869
Hey, Jules. Hey, Holly.

916
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,790
I kissed her,
but it didn't mean anything.

917
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:26,189
I just brought her the jacket.

918
00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:28,509
Kissed who?

919
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:31,310
Oh, me.

920
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,909
Who hasn't?

921
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:39,349
I got you something.
It's called a CD player.

922
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,910
Cost me 700 bucks...

923
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,589
but the sound quality
is outstanding.

924
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,349
You want to play a record?

925
00:52:45,389 --> 00:52:48,750
Jules, it doesn't play records.
It plays CDs.

926
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:50,829
It's a CD player.

927
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:52,590
I'll be upstairs hooking it up.

928
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:57,630
Oh, my God, Robbie
is so amazingly cute.

929
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,990
I think
I should go out with him.

930
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:05,389
Yeah, why not?

931
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:08,389
You're single, and he's single.
It makes sense.

932
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:12,109
If you don't want me to,
I won't do it.

933
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,109
Why would I not want you to?

934
00:53:15,149 --> 00:53:17,110
Good, then I'm going out
with him.

935
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,149
Who you going out with?

936
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,630
Good.
That guy needs to get laid.

937
00:53:22,669 --> 00:53:23,990
Excuse me.

938
00:53:24,029 --> 00:53:26,550
Because he's going out with me
doesn't mean he'll get laid.

939
00:53:29,229 --> 00:53:31,390
All right, he probably will.

940
00:53:31,429 --> 00:53:32,709
Do you think
he'll go out with me?

941
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:36,310
Jules is chums with him.
She'll fix it up, won't you?

942
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,870
You know what would be fun?
Let's go on a double date.

943
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,989
Robbie,
you look so cute tonight.

944
00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:07,509
Thank you.

945
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:10,269
I like these rubber bracelets.
You look like Madonna.

946
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,510
Yeah, that's the idea.

947
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:19,029
Here you go.

948
00:54:19,069 --> 00:54:21,669
So, Robbie,
how's your business going?

949
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:25,150
I'm actually working
on a game plan right now.

950
00:54:25,189 --> 00:54:27,190
You should look
into the bond market.

951
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,390
-That's where the money is.
-Glenn's in junk bonds.

952
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,349
No, Jules,
it's high-yield bonds.

953
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:34,470
Do I tell people
you're in junk waitressing?

954
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:39,509
My grandmother gave me
a savings bond when I was a kid.

955
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:44,549
I get $25 in 1993,
so that'll be good.

956
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:49,109
So we totally
look like a couple.

957
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,790
Don't you think
we look great together?

958
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:55,429
David Bowie playing.
He's the best.

959
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:57,029
I think he's coming to town
in September.

960
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:59,270
I love David Bowie.

961
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,789
When I get excited...

962
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:05,829
My little China girl...

963
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:10,509
She says, "Oh, baby,
just you shut your mouth."

964
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:13,510
Shut your mouth. All right.

965
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,269
We all know the words.

966
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,149
God, I love David Bowie.
He is so sexy.

967
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,550
You think the "time to make
the donuts" guy is sexy.

968
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:23,069
That guy is funny.

969
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:25,670
You know who else
I think is sexy?

970
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:31,430
That's good.
Thank you very much.

971
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:32,709
I gotta go to the bathroom.

972
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,630
Excuse us, guys.
We'll be right back.

973
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:40,310
She'll feel better
once she yaks.

974
00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:42,790
I hope so.

975
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:53,029
So...

976
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,989
Sunday's the big day, huh?

977
00:55:56,029 --> 00:55:57,429
I don't even know
your last name.

978
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:58,789
It's Gulia.

979
00:56:01,629 --> 00:56:03,949
Julia's last name
is gonna be Gulia.

980
00:56:03,949 --> 00:56:05,950
Julia Gulia. That's funny.

981
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,789
Why is that funny?

982
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,389
I don't know.

983
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:17,949
Are you excited?

984
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:22,150
Yeah. She's paid her dues,
been with me four years.

985
00:56:22,189 --> 00:56:24,070
I owe it to her to get married.

986
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:26,550
You had the Long Island
iced tea.

987
00:56:26,589 --> 00:56:30,029
Plus, you know, you probably...

988
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:31,309
you want to get married.

989
00:56:33,029 --> 00:56:34,829
I don't want to break up.

990
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:36,390
Plus, she was with me
before I made my money...

991
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:37,510
so I know I can trust her.

992
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:47,749
That is a luscious ass
right there, isn't it?

993
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,149
My God.

994
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,270
That's Grade-A,
top-choice meat.

995
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:56,229
Like to bite
right through that thing.

996
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:57,830
Chew on it.

997
00:56:57,869 --> 00:56:59,870
But we can't get chicks
like that anymore.

998
00:56:59,909 --> 00:57:01,110
We're too old.

999
00:57:01,149 --> 00:57:02,910
Speak for yourself.
I'm not too old.

1000
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:04,229
I can still get chicks
like that.

1001
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,550
Not that hot, though, right?

1002
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,470
I've gotten hotter.

1003
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,909
10 years ago.

1004
00:57:12,189 --> 00:57:14,589
Try 10 days ago.

1005
00:57:15,709 --> 00:57:17,349
Really?

1006
00:57:17,389 --> 00:57:18,869
As hot as that?

1007
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:22,750
Hotter and younger.

1008
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,149
How do you do it, man?

1009
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:28,029
How do you do it
without getting caught?

1010
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,589
Julia is totally preoccupied
with the wedding.

1011
00:57:32,629 --> 00:57:34,069
She doesn't know
what's going on.

1012
00:57:34,109 --> 00:57:36,350
Oh, man.

1013
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:38,349
You know what sucks, though?

1014
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:41,830
Once you get married,
the party's over, right?

1015
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,350
I work in the city, man.

1016
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,149
And I work long hours.

1017
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,229
Yeah, that's something.

1018
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:53,709
Julia's feeling
a little under the weather.

1019
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,189
Told you she was gonna yak.

1020
00:57:55,229 --> 00:57:57,549
Yeah, you called it.

1021
00:57:57,549 --> 00:57:59,869
Why don't you go get your car
and meet us out front?

1022
00:58:05,669 --> 00:58:07,269
Oh, God. I forgot my purse.

1023
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:09,949
Do me a favor and put her
in the car with Glenn.

1024
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,870
-No problem.
-It's OK.

1025
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:17,230
I puked.

1026
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:19,789
OK. Don't worry.

1027
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,510
I vomited in my hair.

1028
00:58:21,549 --> 00:58:22,629
All right.

1029
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:25,229
Does my hair smell bad?

1030
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,429
No, it smells good, actually.

1031
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,030
Just feel better, all right?

1032
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,189
Hi, Glenn.

1033
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:49,149
Don't puke in the car,
all right?

1034
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:51,950
It'll stink for a week.

1035
00:59:16,709 --> 00:59:20,030
What do you think of Glenn?
Do you think he's trustworthy?

1036
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:21,909
Yeah, he better be.

1037
00:59:23,149 --> 00:59:24,270
Who cares about Glenn?

1038
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,470
You know what
I keep thinking about?

1039
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,830
What?

1040
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:31,909
That soft kiss
from the other day.

1041
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,949
It looked really nice.

1042
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:38,949
Did it feel good?

1043
00:59:41,389 --> 00:59:43,589
I don't know.

1044
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:44,829
I don't remember.

1045
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:47,510
Could I refresh your memory?

1046
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:00,390
Yummy.

1047
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,710
So you know Julia's
staying at Glenn's tonight.

1048
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:13,029
Look, Robbie,
I know that you're shy...

1049
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:15,269
and I know
that you've been hurt...

1050
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:19,909
so I'm gonna make this
really easy on you.

1051
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:24,549
If you come upstairs,
you're gonna get laid.

1052
01:00:24,589 --> 01:00:26,389
Wow.

1053
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:29,990
Nobody's ever said that
to me before.

1054
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:33,830
I just--I'm telling you...

1055
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,669
my head's kind of a mess
right now.

1056
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,870
Julia's staying
at Glenn's tonight, huh?

1057
01:00:41,349 --> 01:00:42,510
Does she stay over there a lot?

1058
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,269
Really?

1059
01:00:49,709 --> 01:00:51,830
Oh, my God.

1060
01:00:51,869 --> 01:00:52,829
What?

1061
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:55,910
I can't believe
I never noticed it before.

1062
01:00:59,669 --> 01:01:01,550
You've got a thing for Julia.

1063
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:04,069
Oh, no, I don't.

1064
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:05,390
I think she's
a very nice girl...

1065
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:07,590
but she's marrying
that jerk-off.

1066
01:01:07,629 --> 01:01:10,789
You know why
she's marrying him, don't you?

1067
01:01:13,949 --> 01:01:16,110
The money thing?

1068
01:01:16,149 --> 01:01:18,550
Security? A nice house?

1069
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,709
I guess that's important
to some people.

1070
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,869
No, it's...

1071
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:26,469
It's not important
to some people, Robbie.

1072
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,069
It's important to all people.

1073
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:31,829
Really? Then I guess
I'm in big trouble.

1074
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,989
Morning, sunshine.

1075
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,830
I have a bad headache.

1076
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,429
A really bad headache.

1077
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:42,509
Can I cook you
some breakfast?

1078
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:48,229
How was your bottle of rum
last night?

1079
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,629
I didn't vomit on you, did l?

1080
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:58,509
A little on my shoe,
but I was wearing your shoes.

1081
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:59,789
Good.

1082
01:02:02,149 --> 01:02:05,109
So, did anything happen
with Robbie last night?

1083
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:11,149
A kiss.

1084
01:02:11,189 --> 01:02:13,110
Did you kiss him,
or did he kiss you?

1085
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:15,350
I kissed him.

1086
01:02:15,389 --> 01:02:16,389
And then what?

1087
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:17,830
Nothing.

1088
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:24,309
He sure doesn't
think much of Glenn, though.

1089
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:26,470
Really? What did he say?

1090
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,670
That Glenn's a jerk-off.

1091
01:02:32,269 --> 01:02:34,189
Why would he say that?

1092
01:02:34,189 --> 01:02:36,789
Who knows?
Maybe he was jealous.

1093
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:40,870
Don't worry. I told him
why you were marrying him.

1094
01:02:40,909 --> 01:02:43,350
Why did you tell him
I was marrying him?

1095
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:45,469
Because you love him...

1096
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:49,989
and because...

1097
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,110
because with Glenn,
you'll have security.

1098
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:55,110
But that's not
why I'm marrying him.

1099
01:02:57,269 --> 01:02:58,909
Then why are you?

1100
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:16,589
Hi, Rosie. How are you?

1101
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:17,789
Fine, dear.

1102
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:20,189
Is Robbie here?
I came by to give him something.

1103
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:23,230
No, Julia.
I'm afraid he's not.

1104
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:26,150
But it's Thursday.
You have singing lessons today.

1105
01:03:26,189 --> 01:03:27,790
Not anymore.

1106
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:29,990
Now that he's gone to the city
to get a real job...

1107
01:03:30,029 --> 01:03:32,509
he doesn't have time
to give me lessons.

1108
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:34,790
Why do you think you'd be
a good hire for this bank?

1109
01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:36,510
I'm ready to work hard...

1110
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:39,229
and when I put my mind
to something, I go all the way.

1111
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:40,589
I'll go all the way
for you, sir.

1112
01:03:41,869 --> 01:03:43,110
Do you have any experience?

1113
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:46,669
I have no experience,
but I'm a big fan of money.

1114
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:49,830
I like it. I use it.
I have a little.

1115
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:52,109
I keep it in a jar
on top of my refrigerator.

1116
01:03:52,149 --> 01:03:54,469
I'd like to put more in it.
That's where you come in.

1117
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:58,630
He wants to make money.

1118
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:04,830
Live in a nice house
with wide windows and lamps.

1119
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:08,110
You can't expect him to live
forever with his sister...

1120
01:04:08,149 --> 01:04:11,189
and the nipple-twisting
that goes on there.

1121
01:04:11,229 --> 01:04:12,709
I thank you for your time.

1122
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,549
Actually, sir, I need this job
to impress a girl.

1123
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:17,189
Will you leave now, please?

1124
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:18,950
You don't even have
to give me the job.

1125
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,029
If you could give me some cards
with my name on it...

1126
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:22,110
I think that might help.

1127
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,629
I'm gonna try
and go look for him, OK?

1128
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:26,630
Tell him I'll give him a raise.

1129
01:04:26,669 --> 01:04:29,110
Three meatballs a lesson.

1130
01:04:29,149 --> 01:04:30,549
How about this?

1131
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:33,030
10 singing lessons
for one business card.

1132
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,990
Thank you very much.

1133
01:04:57,709 --> 01:04:59,909
Hey, Julia.
What are you doing here?

1134
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:02,790
I went by Rosie's to find you.

1135
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:05,949
I'm not doing that anymore.

1136
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:10,070
I thought that teaching
was a big part of your life.

1137
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,590
It was, but now I'm doing
some stuff...

1138
01:05:12,629 --> 01:05:15,109
to better my situation.

1139
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,589
Sounds kind of selfish.

1140
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:20,349
It's not selfish. There's
a lot of money out there.

1141
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:21,589
I'm trying to get
my hands on some.

1142
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:24,230
But you don't want to be
just another yuppie idiot.

1143
01:05:24,269 --> 01:05:25,509
What's wrong with that?

1144
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:28,149
Don't want to live in
my sister's basement anymore.

1145
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,709
I want to get a big house,
have some security.

1146
01:05:31,949 --> 01:05:34,309
Can't do that doing favors
for people all the time...

1147
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:35,590
getting paid in meatballs.

1148
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,670
But you're above
all that material bullshit.

1149
01:05:37,709 --> 01:05:40,550
I don't know. We're living
in a material world...

1150
01:05:40,589 --> 01:05:43,310
and I am a material girl.
Or boy.

1151
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:45,429
No, you're not.

1152
01:05:45,469 --> 01:05:47,550
What about you?
You're into material shit.

1153
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,150
What do you mean?

1154
01:05:50,189 --> 01:05:52,509
You're marrying Glenn
'cause he's got money.

1155
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:02,469
You asshole.

1156
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:17,310
Oh, my gosh.
She made me a present.

1157
01:06:17,389 --> 01:06:19,309
I am an asshole!

1158
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:23,989
You're going
to the mental institution.

1159
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:24,990
Beat it!

1160
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,030
-Rudy.
-Same?

1161
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:52,069
Give me the same, please.

1162
01:06:55,189 --> 01:06:56,270
What's up?

1163
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:58,190
-There he is.
-You all right?

1164
01:06:58,229 --> 01:07:00,670
You know something?

1165
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:02,310
You were right.
You've always been right.

1166
01:07:02,349 --> 01:07:04,630
What have I been so right about?

1167
01:07:04,669 --> 01:07:08,350
Women.
You just have fun with them.

1168
01:07:08,389 --> 01:07:10,630
You get emotionally involved,
and they end up...

1169
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:11,870
What do they do to you?

1170
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:16,710
They rip your heart
out of your ass.

1171
01:07:16,749 --> 01:07:18,310
That's right.

1172
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:20,869
Did something happen with Julia?

1173
01:07:20,909 --> 01:07:23,909
I went on
that double date, right?

1174
01:07:23,949 --> 01:07:26,149
And the moron
she's gonna marry...

1175
01:07:26,189 --> 01:07:28,910
actually tells me
he cheats on her.

1176
01:07:28,949 --> 01:07:30,869
But can I tell her?

1177
01:07:30,909 --> 01:07:33,349
No. Who am l
to break up a marriage?

1178
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:36,069
You need a prostitute.

1179
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:44,270
Anyways...I'm confused.

1180
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:46,349
Because you like her.

1181
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:51,390
I think I'm in love with her.

1182
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:55,910
But I gotta get that
out of my head, you know?

1183
01:07:59,029 --> 01:08:01,550
From now on,
I'm gonna be like you.

1184
01:08:01,589 --> 01:08:03,750
I'm gonna be with
a different chick every night...

1185
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:05,229
and then I'll send them packin'.

1186
01:08:05,229 --> 01:08:07,749
Sounds like you got it
all figured out.

1187
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:11,430
I'm gonna have to give them
cab money to go home...

1188
01:08:11,469 --> 01:08:12,589
because I'll feel bad
if I don't...

1189
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,349
but after that,
it's Bye-Bye, Birdie.

1190
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:18,510
That's it, man,
starting right now.

1191
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:21,829
We are gonna be free and happy
the rest of our lives.

1192
01:08:26,789 --> 01:08:29,630
I'm not happy.
I'm miserable.

1193
01:08:29,709 --> 01:08:31,430
What?

1194
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:34,630
I grew up idolizing guys...

1195
01:08:34,669 --> 01:08:36,869
like Fonzie
and Vinnie Barbarino...

1196
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:38,349
'cause they got
a lot of chicks.

1197
01:08:38,349 --> 01:08:41,229
You know what happened to Fonzie
and Vinnie Barbarino?

1198
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:44,630
I read that Fonzie
wants to be a director...

1199
01:08:44,669 --> 01:08:48,150
and Barbarino, I think,
the mechanical bull movie.

1200
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,270
I didn't see it yet.

1201
01:08:49,309 --> 01:08:53,989
Their shows got canceled
'cause no one wants to see

1202
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:56,469
a 50-year-old guy
hitting on chicks.

1203
01:08:57,909 --> 01:08:59,189
What are you saying?

1204
01:08:59,229 --> 01:09:01,869
What I'm saying is,
all I really want...

1205
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:04,269
is someone to hold me...

1206
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:08,710
and tell me that everything
is gonna be all right.

1207
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:12,870
Everything is
gonna be all right.

1208
01:09:16,749 --> 01:09:18,389
If you found someone
you can love...

1209
01:09:18,429 --> 01:09:20,550
you can't let her get away.

1210
01:09:22,269 --> 01:09:25,429
You're right, man.
Thank you, Sammy.

1211
01:09:25,469 --> 01:09:27,189
Don't tell anyone what I said.

1212
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:32,669
Mom.

1213
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,829
Do you really like Glenn?

1214
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:38,630
Oh, sure, honey.
What's not to like?

1215
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:40,550
He's rich, he's charming,
he's handsome...

1216
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,789
and now he's really got it all
'cause he's got you.

1217
01:09:47,109 --> 01:09:49,110
Honey, what's the matter?

1218
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:53,990
I don't know if
I'm in love with him anymore.

1219
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:57,150
Why? What happened?

1220
01:10:00,669 --> 01:10:03,909
I just don't know
if he's the right guy for me.

1221
01:10:05,629 --> 01:10:07,750
And I've been spending
a lot of time...

1222
01:10:07,789 --> 01:10:10,789
with this other man,
Robbie Hart.

1223
01:10:10,829 --> 01:10:13,990
The wedding singer?

1224
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:16,829
You're thinking of leaving
Glenn for the wedding singer?

1225
01:10:18,189 --> 01:10:20,230
I don't know
what I'm thinking.

1226
01:10:20,269 --> 01:10:21,509
I'm confused.

1227
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,790
I know, sweetie.

1228
01:10:23,829 --> 01:10:26,950
You've got what is known
as the jitters, cold feet.

1229
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:30,230
Everybody has 'em. I had 'em.

1230
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:31,990
Course, I should have run
screaming down the street...

1231
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:34,949
instead of marrying your father,
but Glenn is different.

1232
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:36,070
He's a keeper.

1233
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,749
You're gonna marry Glenn
on Sunday.

1234
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:42,590
You're gonna love him...

1235
01:10:42,629 --> 01:10:44,510
and everything's
gonna be wonderful.

1236
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:50,349
Where's your veil?
It's downstairs.

1237
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,630
I'll go get it.

1238
01:11:17,309 --> 01:11:19,590
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1239
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,309
I'm Mrs. Glenn Gulia.

1240
01:11:23,829 --> 01:11:28,110
Hello. It's nice to meet you.
I'm Julia Gulia.

1241
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:34,069
Right when I wake up
in the morning...

1242
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:36,230
you're the first person
that pops in my head.

1243
01:11:36,269 --> 01:11:38,949
I keep thinking
about you over and over.

1244
01:11:38,989 --> 01:11:42,989
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia.

1245
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:55,229
I'm pleased to meet you.

1246
01:11:55,309 --> 01:11:56,949
I'm Mrs. Robbie Hart.

1247
01:11:58,349 --> 01:12:01,030
Robbie and I are so pleased
you could come to our wedding.

1248
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,309
Pretty good?

1249
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,389
What happened?

1250
01:12:41,429 --> 01:12:45,030
She just looked way too happy.
I couldn't do it.

1251
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,830
I'm sorry, man.

1252
01:12:47,869 --> 01:12:50,469
Hey, Rudy. Get Robbie a double.

1253
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:52,909
Actually, Rudy,
don't even worry about it.

1254
01:12:52,909 --> 01:12:54,149
I brought my own.

1255
01:12:54,189 --> 01:12:56,229
You can't drink that in here.

1256
01:12:56,269 --> 01:12:58,309
All right.

1257
01:12:58,349 --> 01:13:01,309
I'll finish up in the alley.
Are you guys coming?

1258
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:13,229
It's the wedding singer.

1259
01:13:13,269 --> 01:13:15,149
Hey, Glenn. What's up?

1260
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:18,070
I heard you couldn't
close the deal with Holly.

1261
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:19,949
What's the matter with that?
You're not...

1262
01:13:19,949 --> 01:13:21,869
You like women, right?

1263
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:23,630
Not as much as you do, I guess.

1264
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:26,349
We're gonna have a little
pre-bachelor party.

1265
01:13:26,389 --> 01:13:28,510
You want to come
and have a beer?

1266
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:29,669
You're ridiculous, man.

1267
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:33,829
Stop all this
cheating shit, moron.

1268
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:34,949
She's a good girl.

1269
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,469
Hey, asswipe...

1270
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:39,749
don't go snitchin'
to Julia about this.

1271
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,149
I know you got
some little crush on her...

1272
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:44,309
but you gotta face the facts.

1273
01:13:44,349 --> 01:13:46,510
She'd rather go to bed
with a real man...

1274
01:13:46,549 --> 01:13:47,829
not some poor singing orphan.

1275
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:53,110
All right, shithead.
I haven't been in a fight...

1276
01:13:53,149 --> 01:13:54,710
since I was
in the fifth grade...

1277
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,950
but I beat the shit
out of that kid...

1278
01:13:56,989 --> 01:13:58,629
so now I'm gonna beat
the shit out of you.

1279
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:02,189
What are you doing?

1280
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:04,149
I'm sorry.

1281
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,270
I used to be much stronger.

1282
01:14:13,869 --> 01:14:15,429
Why don't you write
a song about this?

1283
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:16,830
You can call it...

1284
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,429
"l got punched in the nose...

1285
01:14:19,469 --> 01:14:21,869
"for stickin' my face
in other people's business."

1286
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:27,990
Way to go.

1287
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,430
Sounds like a country song.

1288
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:47,710
Kiss my grits.

1289
01:14:53,629 --> 01:14:58,149
I can see that you're drunk,
and that's OK.

1290
01:14:58,189 --> 01:15:00,269
I'm still gonna tell you this.

1291
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:02,709
I really miss you,
and I want to come back.

1292
01:15:04,309 --> 01:15:06,349
I don't want
to be alone anymore.

1293
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,430
You're not alone anymore.

1294
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:12,190
Linda's back.

1295
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:56,469
Can I help you?

1296
01:15:59,749 --> 01:16:00,989
Is Robbie here?

1297
01:16:02,749 --> 01:16:04,669
I'm afraid he's indisposed.

1298
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:09,430
Shower.

1299
01:16:13,749 --> 01:16:15,229
You must be Linda.

1300
01:16:15,269 --> 01:16:18,590
Yeah, that's me...
Robbie's fiancee.

1301
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,510
Who are you?

1302
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:21,749
I'm Julia Sullivan.

1303
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,949
Would you tell him
that I came by to see him?

1304
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:28,230
Oh, yeah,
surely will, Jennifer.

1305
01:16:28,269 --> 01:16:29,590
It's Julia.

1306
01:16:46,389 --> 01:16:48,950
Wake up, sleepyhead.

1307
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:51,749
This is the first day
of our new life together.

1308
01:16:54,069 --> 01:16:55,149
Wake me up...

1309
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:57,069
Before you go-go.

1310
01:16:57,109 --> 01:17:00,909
Don't leave me hanging on
like a solo.

1311
01:17:11,789 --> 01:17:12,989
What are you doing here?

1312
01:17:14,669 --> 01:17:18,310
Well, you passed out,
so I took care of you.

1313
01:17:18,349 --> 01:17:20,709
What?
Why'd you take care of me?

1314
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:25,349
I told you last night.
I realized I was wrong...

1315
01:17:25,389 --> 01:17:27,429
and I want to take
care of you for good.

1316
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:28,550
I can learn
to deal with the fact...

1317
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:31,750
that you're a wedding singer
and not a rock star.

1318
01:17:31,789 --> 01:17:33,510
You can learn to deal with that?

1319
01:17:33,549 --> 01:17:36,429
I don't want you to learn
to deal with that.

1320
01:17:36,429 --> 01:17:39,469
That's not how it works. Jeez!

1321
01:17:42,349 --> 01:17:44,829
Maybe we should talk about this
when you're feeling better.

1322
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,110
Hey, psycho...

1323
01:17:47,149 --> 01:17:48,870
I'm not gonna feel
better about this.

1324
01:17:48,909 --> 01:17:50,590
It's over.

1325
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:52,870
Now please get out
of my Van Halen t-shirt...

1326
01:17:52,909 --> 01:17:55,109
before you jinx the band
and they break up.

1327
01:17:59,629 --> 01:18:01,790
So you're still pissed
about that wedding thing.

1328
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:15,469
Glenn, good morning.

1329
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,269
Hey, baby.

1330
01:18:22,309 --> 01:18:24,270
You gonna make breakfast in bed?

1331
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:28,590
Actually, I've been doing
some thinking, and...

1332
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:32,070
I don't need a big wedding...

1333
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:34,229
and I think
that I've been really selfish...

1334
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:37,590
making you do something
you don't even want to do.

1335
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:41,389
You wanna go to Vegas?

1336
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:47,069
All right. Let's go.

1337
01:18:49,549 --> 01:18:52,709
There were bells...

1338
01:18:52,749 --> 01:18:55,630
On a hill...

1339
01:18:55,670 --> 01:19:01,150
But I never heard them ringing.

1340
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:05,469
No, I never heard
them at all...

1341
01:19:05,509 --> 01:19:10,790
'Til there was you.

1342
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:16,790
And there was music...

1343
01:19:16,829 --> 01:19:21,750
And there were wonderful roses.

1344
01:19:21,789 --> 01:19:24,549
They tell me...

1345
01:19:24,589 --> 01:19:26,469
In sweet...

1346
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:29,990
Fragrant meadows...

1347
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:36,749
Of dawn and dew.

1348
01:19:36,789 --> 01:19:39,229
There was love...

1349
01:19:39,269 --> 01:19:40,229
All around...

1350
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:43,949
Flight number 1156
is now ready for boarding.

1351
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:48,310
We'd like to ask passengers
traveling with small children...

1352
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:53,189
I never heard it at all...

1353
01:19:53,229 --> 01:19:59,789
'Til there was you.

1354
01:19:59,829 --> 01:20:01,630
I just always
envisioned the right one...

1355
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:03,789
being someone
I could grow old with.

1356
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,630
I know. I'll go get the car.

1357
01:20:14,029 --> 01:20:16,470
Rosie, congratulations.

1358
01:20:16,509 --> 01:20:17,789
I gotta go take care
of something, OK?

1359
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:20,389
I know you do. Go get her.

1360
01:20:20,429 --> 01:20:22,309
All right.

1361
01:20:22,349 --> 01:20:23,829
-l need to talk to you.
-l can't talk right now.

1362
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:26,949
-Are you back with Linda?
-No. Who said that?

1363
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:29,469
Julia.
She went to your house...

1364
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,270
to tell you she was
falling for you...

1365
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:33,229
and Linda answered the door
in her underwear.

1366
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:34,550
She was so upset...

1367
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:36,350
she and Glenn
jumped a plane to Vegas.

1368
01:20:36,389 --> 01:20:38,430
What do you mean? They're
getting married tomorrow.

1369
01:20:38,469 --> 01:20:40,669
Apparently,
that wasn't soon enough.

1370
01:20:42,749 --> 01:20:43,709
I said, hip, hop...

1371
01:20:43,789 --> 01:20:45,789
A-hippie to the hippie
to the hip, hip, hop.

1372
01:20:45,829 --> 01:20:47,909
You don't stop rockin'
to the bang, bang boogie...

1373
01:20:47,949 --> 01:20:49,149
Say, up comes the boogie...

1374
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:50,550
To the rhythm
of the boogie that beats.

1375
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:52,510
We're now ready
for our general boarding.

1376
01:20:52,589 --> 01:20:54,349
That's it, sweetie.
Ready to go?

1377
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:59,189
This is a great idea.
I'm glad you came around.

1378
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:01,149
You want to do some
gambling and fun right away...

1379
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,309
or just get married?

1380
01:21:02,349 --> 01:21:04,149
I just want to get married.

1381
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:05,990
You're never going to find her.

1382
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:08,110
There's got to be a million
wedding chapels in Vegas.

1383
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:10,230
-Does anybody have a pen?
-What for?

1384
01:21:10,269 --> 01:21:11,710
I got a good idea for a song.

1385
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:14,109
-Here.
-Thank you.

1386
01:21:18,949 --> 01:21:20,110
Thank you.

1387
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:21,149
Hey, I'm sorry.

1388
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:22,789
Can I help you?

1389
01:21:22,829 --> 01:21:24,709
I need a ticket
for Las Vegas, please.

1390
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:29,510
We only have one seat left
in our first-class section.

1391
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:30,950
The next flight
leaves in the morning.

1392
01:21:32,269 --> 01:21:34,429
Can I borrow
your credit card?

1393
01:21:34,469 --> 01:21:36,229
You're going
to pay me back, right?

1394
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:38,190
No, but if you don't
give it to me...

1395
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:41,749
I'm going to tell everybody
what you said at the bar.

1396
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:42,909
Thanks.

1397
01:21:42,949 --> 01:21:45,029
That was really nice of you.

1398
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:46,190
Thanks.

1399
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:48,110
Do you like
Flock of Seagulls?

1400
01:21:48,149 --> 01:21:50,310
I can see you do.

1401
01:21:50,349 --> 01:21:51,750
-Wish me luck.
-Go get her!

1402
01:22:02,949 --> 01:22:04,229
Do you mind
if we switched seats...

1403
01:22:04,269 --> 01:22:05,629
and I sat in the window seat?

1404
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:09,030
I hate the aisle seat.

1405
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:11,709
Every time that cart comes by,
it bangs me in the elbows.

1406
01:22:11,749 --> 01:22:15,549
Your arms are smaller
than mine, Jules.

1407
01:22:15,589 --> 01:22:19,589
I know. I just never saw
the lights of Vegas before.

1408
01:22:21,309 --> 01:22:22,749
Tell you what.

1409
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:25,309
How about I let you lean over me
when we fly over the strip?

1410
01:22:33,469 --> 01:22:34,909
Thank you.

1411
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:37,229
Hot towel?

1412
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:41,349
Thanks.

1413
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:53,230
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

1414
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:56,390
I've never been
on first class before.

1415
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:58,710
My name is Joyce.
Just buzz if you need anything.

1416
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,869
Thank you. Here.

1417
01:23:05,549 --> 01:23:07,269
Sir?

1418
01:23:07,309 --> 01:23:08,710
Is that Billy Idol?

1419
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:12,550
-I believe it is.
-Oh, my God.

1420
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:15,150
Would you like some champagne
or some orange juice?

1421
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,749
How much is it?

1422
01:23:16,789 --> 01:23:19,749
-It's free.
-It's what?

1423
01:23:19,789 --> 01:23:21,909
Holy shit, this is incredible.

1424
01:23:21,949 --> 01:23:23,150
Actually, I shouldn't drink.

1425
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:26,229
I fell in love with this girl
who's going to marry an idiot...

1426
01:23:26,269 --> 01:23:28,190
so I'm on my way to Vegas
to stop them.

1427
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:31,549
That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

1428
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,909
Where are they getting married?

1429
01:23:32,949 --> 01:23:33,909
I don't know where...

1430
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:35,630
but I'm going to run around
and find them.

1431
01:23:35,669 --> 01:23:37,069
I got to do what I got to do.

1432
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:48,869
Next time they come by,
grab me a Heineken.

1433
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:58,469
She comes over to tell me
how she feels...

1434
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:00,429
and Linda answers the door...

1435
01:24:00,429 --> 01:24:02,829
wearing nothing
but my Van Halen t-shirt.

1436
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:04,389
No way.

1437
01:24:04,429 --> 01:24:05,589
I don't know what to do.

1438
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:08,029
She's getting married,
and he's going to ruin her life.

1439
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:10,229
Glenn doesn't deserve her.

1440
01:24:10,269 --> 01:24:12,270
All he cares about
are possessions...

1441
01:24:12,309 --> 01:24:16,110
fancy cars, CD players.

1442
01:24:16,149 --> 01:24:18,510
Even women
are possessions to him.

1443
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:19,630
Billy idol gets it.

1444
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:21,469
I don't know why
she doesn't get it.

1445
01:24:21,509 --> 01:24:22,709
I hope you find her.

1446
01:24:22,749 --> 01:24:24,349
You guys
will not believe this.

1447
01:24:24,389 --> 01:24:26,350
Some creep in coach
who thinks he's Don Johnson...

1448
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:29,029
just asked me to be part
of the mile-high club.

1449
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:32,550
He said I was
Grade-A, top-choice meat.

1450
01:24:38,349 --> 01:24:39,909
Is he right in here?

1451
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:43,270
What's the mile-high club?

1452
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:54,869
Oh, my God.
The mile-high guy is Glenn.

1453
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,309
They're on this plane.

1454
01:24:56,349 --> 01:24:57,949
No way!

1455
01:24:57,989 --> 01:24:59,069
You guys got to help me.

1456
01:24:59,109 --> 01:25:00,709
Right!

1457
01:25:03,789 --> 01:25:05,789
Good afternoon, everyone.

1458
01:25:05,829 --> 01:25:09,430
We're flying at 26,000 feet,
moving up to 30,000 feet...

1459
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:12,669
and we got clear skies
all the way to Las Vegas.

1460
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:15,750
And now, we're bringing you
some in-flight entertainment.

1461
01:25:15,789 --> 01:25:17,670
One of our first-class
passengers...

1462
01:25:17,709 --> 01:25:19,070
would like
to sing you a song...

1463
01:25:19,109 --> 01:25:20,990
inspired by one
of our coach passengers.

1464
01:25:21,029 --> 01:25:23,870
And since we let
our first-class passengers...

1465
01:25:23,949 --> 01:25:27,430
do pretty much whatever
they want, here he is.

1466
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:32,789
I wanna make you smile...

1467
01:25:32,829 --> 01:25:35,110
Whenever you're sad...

1468
01:25:35,149 --> 01:25:36,350
Carry you around...

1469
01:25:36,389 --> 01:25:38,829
When your arthritis is bad.

1470
01:25:38,869 --> 01:25:41,469
Oh, all I wanna do...

1471
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:44,069
Is grow old with you.

1472
01:25:46,949 --> 01:25:48,950
I'll get you medicine...

1473
01:25:48,989 --> 01:25:52,390
When your tummy aches...

1474
01:25:52,429 --> 01:25:53,949
Build you a fire...

1475
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:55,909
If the furnace breaks.

1476
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:59,429
Oh, it could be so nice...

1477
01:25:59,469 --> 01:26:01,990
Growin' old with you.

1478
01:26:04,869 --> 01:26:06,869
I'll miss you...

1479
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:09,070
Kiss you...

1480
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:10,710
Give you my coat...

1481
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:13,149
When you are cold...

1482
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:15,069
Need you...

1483
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:17,309
Feed you...

1484
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:18,909
Even let you hold...

1485
01:26:18,949 --> 01:26:20,869
The remote control.

1486
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:26,510
What the hell's
that fruit doing here?

1487
01:26:31,389 --> 01:26:33,110
Get out of the way!

1488
01:26:33,149 --> 01:26:34,910
Excuse me, sir.
I have to serve the beverages.

1489
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,589
How you doing, sir?
Chicken or fish?

1490
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:46,030
Get out of my way,
or you're going to get hurt.

1491
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:49,590
Don't you talk
to Billy Idol that way.

1492
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:55,429
So let me clear the dishes...

1493
01:26:55,469 --> 01:26:58,389
In our kitchen sink...

1494
01:26:58,429 --> 01:26:59,509
Put you to bed...

1495
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:01,669
When you've had
too much to drink.

1496
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:06,430
I could be the man...

1497
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:10,469
Who grows old with you.

1498
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:12,910
I wanna grow old...

1499
01:27:12,949 --> 01:27:15,149
With you.

1500
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:26,190
That was the most
beautiful song.

1501
01:27:26,229 --> 01:27:27,869
I got a confession to make.

1502
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,590
That song was about you.

1503
01:27:30,629 --> 01:27:32,030
Good.

1504
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:34,270
I'm in love with you.

1505
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:38,349
I am so in love with you.

1506
01:27:40,309 --> 01:27:41,949
That wasn't a bad song.

1507
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:44,349
I'm going to tell those
record company guys about you.

1508
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:46,550
You mind if I give her
a kiss first?

1509
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:48,550
Do what you got to do.

1510
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:10,309
I know this...

1511
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:12,069
Much is...

1512
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:13,349
True.

1513
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:19,629
I know this...

1514
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:21,429
Much is...

1515
01:28:21,469 --> 01:28:23,189
True.

1516
01:28:24,149 --> 01:28:25,909
I know, I know, I know...

1517
01:28:25,949 --> 01:28:28,350
This much is true.

1518
01:28:28,389 --> 01:28:30,550
Oh, yes, I do...

1519
01:28:30,589 --> 01:28:34,549
Robbie and Julia.
