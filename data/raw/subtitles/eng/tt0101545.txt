1
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:56,664
That wasn't
a store robbery.

2
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:58,732
That was an
assassination.

3
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,904
That wasn't a clerk.
That was a wise guy.

4
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,073
How do I know?

5
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:08,812
I spent a little time with
the FBI's organized crime unit.

6
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:11,047
You could say that
I'm intimately knowledgeable...

7
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:13,522
with the rancorous
workings of the Mob...

8
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:16,025
in the midwest section
of this country.

9
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:19,689
I know gangland slayings,
and that's exactly what this is.

10
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:23,131
I'd look into it personally,
but I got a date tonight.

11
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:27,465
Think I'll take the private jet
and fly to Spain,

12
00:01:27,538 --> 00:01:29,438
pick up
the little lady,

13
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,998
do the subsonic tummy bump
at 30,000 feet...

14
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:35,239
then glide back into
the U.S. Of A. By dawn.

15
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:39,716
I know what you're gonna say:
"Jim Dodge, settle down.

16
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:41,911
Relax.
You owe it to yourself."

17
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:44,750
I'll tell you
what I tell everybody.

18
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:47,882
Any little fräulein that
expects anything more from me...

19
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,984
than a little bit
of pleasure, danger...

20
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:52,120
and a great set
of pectorals,

21
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,790
she's looking for
a fall right on her ass.

22
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:01,972
- Hubie, Hubie!
- Let me tell you something.

23
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,440
If you know what's good for you,
don't you ever come back!

24
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:08,811
You're not gonna find someone
who has the relationship...

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,747
with those animals that I do.

26
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:14,717
Listen to the dogs.
They love me!

27
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:19,214
It all started
when I was 15.

28
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,623
That's when I invented
the artificial cow heart.

29
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,526
Oh, that was a big thing.

30
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:28,497
A little before your time,
but it made the newspapers.

31
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,592
ABC, NBC, CBS,
they picked up on it.

32
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,399
But it's more or less
a hobby for me, boys.

33
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,574
Scoot over!

34
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:42,345
Actually, today I decided...

35
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:47,373
I've gone about as far as I can go
in the animal health-care business.

36
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:51,445
The reason that I'm not
at work this afternoon...

37
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:55,151
is because I was made an offer
I cannot refuse. I sold.

38
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:57,126
Whatcha gonna do
with the cash?

39
00:02:57,195 --> 00:03:00,392
Invest it overseas,
projects in Eastern Europe.

40
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:02,865
I don't know.
I've got everything.

41
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:06,028
Jim, you just bought
the animal hospital.

42
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,571
How come you
sold it so fast?

43
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:12,108
Tax problem.

44
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:14,440
And here's my
accountant right now.

45
00:03:14,512 --> 00:03:17,538
Earl, take a bow.
Ha-ha-ha!

46
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,584
20 minutes for lunch.
Go buy another suit.

47
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,710
He works for me.

48
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,620
He's scouting some
real estate for me,

49
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,817
but the market's
real tight.

50
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:33,022
I like the new
uniform, Lorraine.

51
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,396
With the right
shoes and handbag,

52
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,902
that might be suitable
for a cocktail party.

53
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,701
So... question.

54
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:45,799
When in the worid are you going
to start serving sashimi?

55
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:48,573
Maybe when I find out
what it is.

56
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:53,044
You've never
heard of sashimi?

57
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:55,608
You've got
to be kidding.

58
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:58,484
It's this special
Japanese fish you eat raw.

59
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,490
A little
butter sauce,

60
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:03,049
and you're ready
to go to heaven.

61
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:07,860
I'd hire you in a minute if I hadn't
already fired you so many times.

62
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:10,765
Did you ever think
of leaving town?

63
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:15,800
Thousands of people
over in St. Louis...

64
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:20,640
got no idea
how full of shit you are.

65
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:24,238
You've been alive for
21 years, my friend.

66
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:26,249
Plenty of time
for most people...

67
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,649
to find a place
for themselves.

68
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:34,281
Well, I'm not like
everybody else.

69
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,384
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, that's for sure.

70
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,898
How about if I...

71
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,434
I work for you
for free?

72
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:48,972
No.

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,065
I'm afraid not, Jimmy.

74
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,644
Think about St. Louis.

75
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:57,947
- Hey, Josie.
- Hi.

76
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:01,041
- Fill her up?
- Fill her up.

77
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:21,264
How you doin'?

78
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:41,019
You got fired again,
didn't you? Didn't you?

79
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,151
Who told you that?

80
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:47,823
- Hubie Marshall called me at work.
- He called you at work?

81
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:50,958
That's it, I'm gonna...
What'd he say?

82
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,969
He said
he fired ya!

83
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:56,406
He said that?
And you believed him?

84
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:58,567
Damn straight I do!

85
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:01,908
With all due respect, Dad,
you're Mr. Gullible. Sometimes.

86
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:05,707
The truth of the matter is,
Dad, I resigned.

87
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:10,249
- I'll tell you something else.
- Shut up, Jimmy!

88
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:13,256
I had no idea the job was
gonna be a hire/fire situation.

89
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:16,758
Luther Betenhauser's boy
is doing better.

90
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:19,261
- What's wrong with him?
- Fell off his grandfather's silo.

91
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,493
- He's got brain damage.
- He does not.

92
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:26,093
Hoover Fey says his tongue's gonna
hang out his mouth the rest of his life.

93
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,933
And when he dies,

94
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:30,530
at the funeral they're
gonna put a mask on him.

95
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:34,135
Do I have to listen to this
while I'm eating?

96
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,145
Let's talk about
something else.

97
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,516
Josie McClellan
moved to New York.

98
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,013
She did not.
I saw her today.

99
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,581
I don't know
how you could.

100
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,594
I heard she got tired of
taking care of her father,

101
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,028
and she told him
to jump in a lake,

102
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:56,293
and left to get her M.B.A.
In high-fashion design...

103
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,562
at the University
of New York City.

104
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:03,066
I just saw her at the gas station
in living color.

105
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,108
We had a cup
of java together.

106
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:09,306
I'm gonna take Lou Selby's
word over yours any day.

107
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,439
Lou Selby's a drunk.

108
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:15,710
For a guy who's just
lost his umpteenth job,

109
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:18,253
you sure are handy
with the tongue sword.

110
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:22,448
- You got canned again?
- Well, he didn't get canned.

111
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,619
He got fired.

112
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:27,719
That's gotta be a record.

113
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,901
Not only are you
an obnoxious slug,

114
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,460
but you're a freeloading
obnoxious slug.

115
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:38,506
You should talk.

116
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,837
In your mid-forties,
still living at home.

117
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,505
I'm twenty-four,
and I pay rent.

118
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,844
- So do I.
- You did pay rent.

119
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:52,148
Dad, you mean you're
cutting my rent?

120
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,450
Hell, no!

121
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:57,492
You're not paying rent because
you don't have a job or any money.

122
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:00,221
You're out of school and you live
in this house, you pay rent.

123
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:08,768
# I wanna stay home #

124
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:14,539
# I wanna stay home
right here #

125
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:18,636
# I wanna stay home
today #

126
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:22,376
Jim! Yo, Jim!

127
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,578
Jim, wake up!

128
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:26,746
Hey, get up!

129
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,924
Get u-u-up!

130
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:35,763
# When my day begins ##

131
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:39,164
You know, getting this job,

132
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:43,034
restoring your faith and pride in me
is a number-1 priority.

133
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,097
Priority ought to be making
something of yourself.

134
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:48,108
That's right up there.

135
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:52,010
When I was your age, I couldn't wait
to get out of my folks' house.

136
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:55,615
I love living at home.

137
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,124
I don't think this is such
a great place for me to work.

138
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,901
Okay,

139
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:17,837
say I don't get this job,
hypothetically.

140
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:19,339
Are you gonna be upset?

141
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:22,774
You don't get this job,
you're on a bus to St. Louis.

142
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:24,539
St. Louis?

143
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,740
Uncle Jeff's offered you
work in his garden shop.

144
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:29,215
I don't know anything
about gardening.

145
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:31,582
You will learn!

146
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:34,781
I'm getting a feeling that
you want me out of your life.

147
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:38,019
I don't want you out of my life,
I want you out of my house.

148
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:41,495
- Wow.
- Out!

149
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:43,258
Okay, okay, okay.

150
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:03,476
- Sure I can't offer you a bear claw?
- No, thanks.

151
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:07,044
- They're good, fresh.
- No, I'm fine.

152
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:10,489
You don't want one,
and I don't need one.

153
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,153
- Right!
- I love the darn things, though.

154
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:17,130
I could eat those by the dozen.
By the looks of it, I have.

155
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,133
Right.

156
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,170
I'm so excited that
you're considering...

157
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:25,536
joining the Target team.
We all are.

158
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:28,404
I appreciate that.

159
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:31,968
Good. Then let's cut
right to the chase.

160
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:36,714
We're prepared
to offer you $42,500 a year...

161
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,912
with a full benefit package.

162
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:41,353
That's dental, medical,

163
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,584
profit sharing, pensión,

164
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:46,627
expense account, car allowance,

165
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:48,356
vacation, of course,

166
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,491
and any and all
relocating expenses.

167
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:56,663
This is our first, best,
and last offer. What do you think?

168
00:10:57,372 --> 00:11:00,239
Well... um, C. D...

169
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:02,105
with all due respect,

170
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:04,145
I came in here...

171
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:06,874
with the number forty-five
in mind, and...

172
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:26,925
Hmph.

173
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:31,631
You've got me.

174
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,633
Forty-five it is.

175
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,474
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

176
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,844
- I'd like to buy you lunch.
- No, no, no.

177
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:43,110
Your money's no good here.
Lunch is mine.

178
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:46,119
- I'm not going to argue.
- Better not. I'm bigger than you.

179
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:50,680
Hang on a second.
I told her to hold my calls.

180
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,819
Yeah, Peg. Uh-huh.

181
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:56,090
No, it's okay.

182
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:59,292
- He's right here with me now.
- Hi, Peg.

183
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,858
We just closed the deal.
Uh-huh.

184
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:06,270
It was a slam-dunk, too.
I got him for forty-five.

185
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:13,537
No, he's right here.

186
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:17,551
What do you mean
he missed the plane?

187
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,881
Then who the hell
am I talking to?

188
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:25,626
Ohhh!

189
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:31,598
I'll, uh...
I'll get back to you.

190
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,100
I know a great,
little Italian place...

191
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,603
that has the best pasta
primatonis in the wor...

192
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,605
Excuse me a minute,
will you please?

193
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:41,699
- Lovely wife you have there.
- Dodge, James?

194
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:46,205
Mm-hmm.

195
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:48,806
James, I'm afraid we have
a little misunderstanding.

196
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:51,716
You see, I thought
you came in for the, uh...

197
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:55,244
operations manager's job.

198
00:12:55,323 --> 00:12:58,759
I have you down here
as night cleanup boy.

199
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:03,027
Well, I'm a little overpaid...

200
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,896
for night cleanup boy,
wouldn't you say?

201
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:11,869
The truth is, James,
I can offer you $4.44 per hour.

202
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:18,235
Uh, four, four...
$4.44...

203
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:21,680
- $4.44.
- What about the benefits?

204
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,184
Two fifteen-minute breaks
and a half hour for lunch.

205
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,622
And the title is, uh,
night... cleanup boy.

206
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:31,522
Yes.

207
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:35,056
I'll take it.

208
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,758
Oh, and, uh...
Iose the curl.

209
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:43,092
- Welcome to the Target team.
- Thank you.

210
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:46,436
So the parrot says,
"Of course I can talk."

211
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:49,341
Can you fly?

212
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:55,142
I don't want any damn Japanese
automobile plant in this town.

213
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,812
It... it means jobs.

214
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:02,948
I don't need a job.

215
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:05,788
Your governor's tryin' to use
my town as a political chip.

216
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,589
I resent that.

217
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:11,530
There could be some specific
benefits for you personally.

218
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:18,128
Josie!

219
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:22,235
- Yeah?
- Come here.

220
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,546
Meet these gentlemen
from the governor's office.

221
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:29,980
Come on in here, honey.

222
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:47,067
Honey, I want
you to meet Bill, uh...

223
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:50,797
Uh, Bob. Bob Bosenbeck.

224
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:55,298
Bob.

225
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,317
Dave.

226
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,695
My pleasure, Dave.

227
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:22,793
Right. Dave Hockner.

228
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,896
I don't want to interrupt.

229
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:28,168
Very nice to meet both of you.

230
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:29,869
Bye.

231
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:31,878
Bye.

232
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,476
Josie?

233
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:41,487
Josie!

234
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:52,130
You pull another stunt
like you did today,

235
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,464
I'll beat the livin'
daylights outta you!

236
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:17,887
All right, out!

237
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:23,628
Out of the vehicle, ma'am.
Get out of here!

238
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:25,665
Get out of the car!

239
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,380
Right on time!

240
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:52,658
Everything's going as planned.

241
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:55,056
You ordered a limousine?

242
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:58,864
Of course.

243
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:00,867
My first day of work.

244
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:04,029
How's it gonna look
if my dad drives me?

245
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:06,038
A little treat
for getting the job.

246
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:08,097
It was only fifty bucks.

247
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:13,479
- Right on time, Henry.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:17,381
Henry, the sign... very wrong.

249
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:22,246
Ciao!

250
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:31,324
Hey, Jim, where you going?

251
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,563
Hello, boys.

252
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:37,160
Going to Paris on an F-14.

253
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:40,036
Got a peace meeting with the
vice president of Bulgaria.

254
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:43,099
Business, you know?
Then I'm going to Venice,

255
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,475
for a spaghetti dinner
with the princess of Austria.

256
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:48,413
A beautiful lady...
really big bones.

257
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:51,110
Remember to brush
your teeth, Melvin!

258
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:54,677
You, too, Sidney!
Adiós!

259
00:17:56,357 --> 00:17:59,884
Jim is so cool!

260
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:26,237
Bobby.

261
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:30,448
Got a loose tile here.
In the morning...

262
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:32,314
take care of it.

263
00:19:32,386 --> 00:19:35,253
I don't need a lawsuit, okay?

264
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:37,552
I've got enough to worry about.

265
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:40,554
Who's he?

266
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:42,596
Attention, shoppers.

267
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:44,597
The store will be closing
in five minutes.

268
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:47,759
Bring all your purchases
to the front.

269
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:31,510
- Are you a slacker?
- No, uh, Presbyterian.

270
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,773
What did you say?
What did you say?

271
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:35,974
I'm askin' you
a simple question.

272
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,143
- Are you lazy?
- No, sir.

273
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:42,245
The last guy that wore that uniform was
a lazy slacker, and I fired his butt.

274
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:47,988
Uh, about the uniform,
will I be getting my own?

275
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:52,192
You work out, which I doubt,
you can have a new name patch.

276
00:20:57,371 --> 00:21:01,705
Would I be able to have it laundered?
It smells a little like Darnell.

277
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:04,107
I don't think you know
who you're messin' with.

278
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:07,037
After you clean the
ladies' and mens' crappers...

279
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:10,174
and you'd better be able
to eat off those bowls...

280
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,048
you clean my coffee maker,
then wax my desk.

281
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,247
Uh, clean what?

282
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:18,758
- Clean my coffee maker and wax my desk!
- I got it!

283
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:21,386
Sweep the aisles,
startin' with health and beauty.

284
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:23,396
Work your way over to
juniors and misses.

285
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:25,898
Ups and downs, leaving your
debris in the cross aisles.

286
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,900
So, I start with
health and beauty...

287
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:29,959
I just said to start
with health and beauty!

288
00:21:30,037 --> 00:21:32,335
Then you do
your cross aisles.

289
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:34,340
That'll bring your
dust bin into play.

290
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:36,433
Take the debris.
Load it into the dustbin.

291
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,411
Take the dustbin out
to the loading dock...

292
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,414
and empty it into
the receptacle.

293
00:21:41,482 --> 00:21:44,007
- Got that? Easy as pie.
- Yeah.

294
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:46,177
I was employed briefly
at Del Taco, and...

295
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,821
I don't care about your
Del Taco experience.

296
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:51,253
We've got this problem
in this store with grazers.

297
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:54,885
- You know what a grazer is?
- Is that a farm term?

298
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:58,954
It's a customer or employee
that eats off the shelves,

299
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:01,556
similar to a cow grazing
in a field of grass.

300
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:04,262
Only this isn't a field of grass,
and you're not a cow.

301
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:06,999
There's no eatin'.
You're not being paid to eat, so don't!

302
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:09,940
- Any questions?
- Not right off hand.

303
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:12,443
- Think you can handle it?
- I'll give it the old college try.

304
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,536
Don't touch me!

305
00:22:14,614 --> 00:22:17,310
Well, despite our
age difference,

306
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:19,351
I think I'll enjoy
working with you.

307
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:21,682
Let's get something straight.
You ain't workin' with me.

308
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:23,688
You're working for me.

309
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:27,453
- Still, it'll be fun being around you.
- I ain't gonna be near you.

310
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:30,154
I'm gonna be home pumping the pasties
out of Colleen Jackson.

311
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:34,222
- You're not going to be here?
- Hell, no.

312
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,894
I'm gonna be here
by myself?

313
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:42,237
That's right. And you'd better
stay out of the ladies' undergoods.

314
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:47,077
Wait a minute!
Nobody told me I'd be here alone.

315
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,614
- What are you doing?
- Saving money.

316
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:51,741
Wait! Are you
turning off the lights?

317
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:54,342
In 25 seconds, you got
light in every third aisle.

318
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,786
When the sun comes up,
turn off all the lights.

319
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:58,655
I don't understand.
Hold on!

320
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,454
I don't understand.
Hold on!

321
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:02,391
I'm locking you in.

322
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:04,554
When I come back at 7:00
to open up,

323
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,063
I'll let you out.

324
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,695
- You're locking me in?
- What do you take me for, a fool?

325
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:15,172
Nobody gets keys on their
first night. Nobody!

326
00:23:15,241 --> 00:23:17,436
Get to work!

327
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,536
- What if there's a fire?
- The fire department will come.

328
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:24,947
- I could perish!
- Ha-ha-ha. Boo!

329
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:27,451
You can't do this.
I'm locked in, alone, in the dark.

330
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,456
That was not a part
of my employment agreement.

331
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:23,069
# You got to wash with
the crocodile in the river #

332
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:27,636
# You got to swim
with the sharks in the sea #

333
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:31,774
# You got to live with
the crooked politician #

334
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:34,945
# Trust those things
that you can never see #

335
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,457
# Ay yeah, yeah
Ay yeah, yeah #

336
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:42,085
# Ay yeah, yeah
Ay yeah, yeah #

337
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,355
Agh!

338
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:56,667
# It's a cruel, crazy
beautiful worid #

339
00:24:56,742 --> 00:25:01,839
# Every day you wake up
I hope it's a blue, blue sky #

340
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:08,911
# It's a cruel, crazy
beautiful worid #

341
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:11,047
# One day
when you wake up #

342
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:14,217
# I will have to
say good-bye #

343
00:25:16,562 --> 00:25:18,359
# Say good-bye #

344
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:27,671
# It's your worid
so live in it, good-bye #

345
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,107
# It's your worid
so live in it... ##

346
00:25:47,193 --> 00:25:49,218
9:17!

347
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:53,928
Time for a break.

348
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:20,252
Hello.

349
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:24,428
Anybody out there?

350
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:26,464
When I accepted...

351
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:31,060
the post of president,
grand poobah of Target,

352
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:34,970
realizing that
I had brought...

353
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,634
meaningfulness,
peace, and happiness...

354
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,905
into the lives of
thousands of people.

355
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:43,415
Jim Dodge, of Monroe,

356
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:45,507
top moneymaker on the tour.

357
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:47,814
His father's here today,
Bud Dodge,

358
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:49,855
and sister Penny,
a sad, sad story,

359
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:52,857
was just admitted to
University Hospital.

360
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:56,827
While trying to pop a zit,
her head mysteriously exploded.

361
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:22,650
Dad! Hi!

362
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:24,712
Do you know
what time it is?

363
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,157
I'm starting to think about
Christmas and gifts,

364
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:32,027
because I'm in a big store
and I'm getting gift ideas.

365
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:34,964
- Hi.
- Mom, hi!

366
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:36,968
How's it going?

367
00:27:37,036 --> 00:27:39,004
I finished all
my janitor stuff.

368
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:41,562
Most of it. I've got
to save some for later.

369
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,043
- It's easy as hell.
- Uh, honey, it's a little late.

370
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:48,477
It is kind of late.

371
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:51,072
Sleep tight.

372
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,311
See you in the morning.

373
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:56,081
Love you, too.

374
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,826
Mr. James Dodge!

375
00:28:58,316 --> 00:29:01,251
He can't be happy as
the night cleanup boy.

376
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:05,588
Sweetheart,

377
00:29:05,657 --> 00:29:08,922
he wants us
to call him a janitor.

378
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,659
Maybe I should have spent
less time harping...

379
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:16,029
and more time helping.

380
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,558
Harpin' and helpin'
him what?

381
00:29:19,637 --> 00:29:23,767
Harpin' on him to leave,
and helpin' him become...

382
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:27,608
the good, mature,
productive person he could be.

383
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:59,199
Are you all right?

384
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:03,405
Yes, I'm fine, thanks.
And you?

385
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:06,433
What are you doing here?

386
00:31:08,212 --> 00:31:09,975
I work here.

387
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:12,278
Have a good one, Officer Don.

388
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,377
Okay, Carl. Let me know
if you hear anything.

389
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:18,820
You bet.

390
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,984
Well, sir,
she didn't leave on the bus.

391
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,223
Let's look for her
someplace else.

392
00:31:25,296 --> 00:31:28,060
She wouldn't be dumb
enough to thumb, would she?

393
00:31:28,132 --> 00:31:32,068
Does she have any friends
she might have run off with?

394
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:34,130
Boyfriends?

395
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:38,107
Just get in the car
so we can look for the girl.

396
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:41,339
I'm tired,
haven't had any coffee.

397
00:31:41,412 --> 00:31:44,210
My daughter, I don't know
where the hell she is.

398
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:46,648
And you're sounding like
some goddamn preacher!

399
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,652
Come on, get in the car!

400
00:31:50,254 --> 00:31:52,119
Prick.

401
00:31:56,294 --> 00:31:58,990
Are you sure you
didn't hurt yourself?

402
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:01,588
Oh, no.
Are you kidding?

403
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,260
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

404
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:06,530
Can I ask what
you were doing?

405
00:32:06,604 --> 00:32:08,595
I was roller-skating.

406
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:11,574
- I know, but why?
- Why not?

407
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:15,100
I got bored.
One thing led to another...

408
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,512
and I'm roller-skating
in my shorts.

409
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,381
Better question would be,
"What are you doing here?"

410
00:32:21,452 --> 00:32:23,113
Shopping.

411
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:26,390
We've been closed
for five hours.

412
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:28,755
Yeah. I fell asleep.

413
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:31,590
- While shopping?
- No, in the ladies' dressing room.

414
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:35,325
That makes no sense.
You're a high-profile young ingenue.

415
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,496
I was debating whether or not
to get arrested for shoplifting.

416
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:43,766
Your father owns $10 million
worth of real estate.

417
00:32:43,841 --> 00:32:47,277
- It's not my fault.
- I didn't imply such.

418
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:49,711
It seems funny
that someone of your...

419
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:53,550
- Wealth?
- If you will. Would shoplift.

420
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:56,451
I didn't do it.
I chickened out.

421
00:32:57,522 --> 00:32:59,149
Would consider shoplifting.

422
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:03,751
It's a long, self-indulgent,
highly unromantic story...

423
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:06,160
about an overbearing father,

424
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,289
deceased mother and brother,

425
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:12,166
and a completely confused girl
who looks a little like me.

426
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:52,837
I sure am glad
you dropped by.

427
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:56,277
I was getting tired
of being with myself.

428
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:03,076
I guess... I'm what you
call a people person.

429
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:08,150
- What are you cooking?
- Hobo chicken.

430
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:10,717
It's a glazed chicken
in wine sauce...

431
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:13,389
with vegetables
and skin-on potatoes.

432
00:34:13,464 --> 00:34:16,456
Silverware, silverware.

433
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,461
It's only 210 calories.

434
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:25,475
I don't know if you're watching
your figure, but I sure am.

435
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:29,240
If you can grab a serving spoon,
I think we'll be set.

436
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,244
Keep your distance
from these things.

437
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:39,846
I think it's safe
to keep five feet.

438
00:34:44,495 --> 00:34:46,861
I think they're about done.

439
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:51,962
Dining room's right this way.

440
00:34:53,771 --> 00:34:55,705
Mmm!

441
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:02,337
I think my father poured
the cement for your pool.

442
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,282
He's a cement contractor.
Good man.

443
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:08,976
Bud Dodge?

444
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:11,954
My mother works at
Hoenicker's over Christmas.

445
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:13,957
My sister's a teller
at the bank.

446
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:16,459
My brother's in grade school.
He's not employed.

447
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:19,291
I used to work at
the animal shelter,

448
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:23,299
but I was terminated.
Now I'm working here.

449
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:26,830
Do you always
talk this much?

450
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:31,733
I guess I do.

451
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:34,835
I like talking to people.

452
00:35:36,113 --> 00:35:39,742
- Maybe you should go into sales.
- I've actually tried that.

453
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:49,557
Some fresh ground pepper?

454
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:51,094
Please.

455
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:55,999
Some people don't like
a lot of pepper. Say when.

456
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:58,058
That's fine.

457
00:35:58,135 --> 00:36:00,069
I happen to really
like it a lot.

458
00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:03,595
It enhances the natural
flavor of the chicken.

459
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:10,806
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way.

460
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:12,650
I've had dreams about you.

461
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:15,344
You've had dreams about me?

462
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:17,982
Not recently.

463
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:20,216
I've had dreams
about you in the past.

464
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:23,158
I've had dreams about
entire cheerleading squads,

465
00:36:23,227 --> 00:36:25,354
so don't get me wrong.

466
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,593
- It's kid stuff. How 'bout you?
- Do I dream?

467
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:33,100
That's about all I do.

468
00:36:46,717 --> 00:36:50,619
Raisin' a kid's hard work.
You got any kids?

469
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:52,747
No, sir. And from
listening to you,

470
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:55,258
and from observin' this,

471
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:58,352
I'm kinda grateful
Emily turned up infertile.

472
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:18,780
Shouldn't you be
cleaning up the store?

473
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,784
I got plenty of time.

474
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:24,253
- Big store.
- Huge.

475
00:37:25,323 --> 00:37:26,722
Always smoke cigars?

476
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,487
I enjoy a good one
after a fine meal.

477
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:32,495
It settles the stomach.

478
00:37:34,031 --> 00:37:35,521
You're the town liar,
right?

479
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,272
- What?
- I'm sorry.

480
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,932
That really came out wrong.

481
00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:49,009
- How could it come out right?
- That's what people call you.

482
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,241
- I didn't mean to imply it's true.
- People call me that?

483
00:37:51,315 --> 00:37:54,443
- I thought you knew.
- That I was the town liar?

484
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,885
- You didn't?
- No. I'm not.

485
00:37:56,954 --> 00:37:59,855
- You have the wrong information.
- I didn't mean to offend you.

486
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:05,262
- Did you think that was a compliment?
- No. And I apologize.

487
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:09,231
- I can't repeat things like that.
- Don't think about it.

488
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,428
As I said, you've got
the wrong information.

489
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:14,664
If people are calling me that,

490
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:16,866
it's because they're
small, petty and jealous.

491
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:19,842
Small towns are
notorious for that.

492
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:22,072
- I'm sure there's a word for me.
- Sure.

493
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:24,740
- What do they call me?
- A tease.

494
00:38:24,815 --> 00:38:27,045
Tease?

495
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:30,417
Yeah, I can see that.

496
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:34,386
Actually, I never teased.

497
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,722
This is becoming amusing,

498
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:40,560
- but who exactly calls me a liar?
- Everybody.

499
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:43,623
- Everybody.
- No, not everybody.

500
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:47,467
- There's some old people in town.
- Right.

501
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:54,742
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

502
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,578
Do you think I'm a liar?

503
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:00,640
I don't know you well enough.

504
00:39:02,753 --> 00:39:06,780
You've known me for 17 years. We went to
the same schools from kindergarten on.

505
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:09,655
I knew of you, but I didn't
know you personally.

506
00:39:10,861 --> 00:39:12,954
That's always bothered me.

507
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,659
I mean that old...
in-out, us-them thing.

508
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:20,295
- That's the way it's been.
- It's always bothered me.

509
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:24,899
- It's water over the dam now.
- But it's your dam and my water.

510
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:26,944
I got crapped on
a lot of years.

511
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:29,002
I meant that it's in the past.

512
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,049
The present
is a result of the past.

513
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:34,050
I look at my
high school yearbook...

514
00:39:34,118 --> 00:39:37,383
and I don't see
four fabulous years.

515
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:39,616
I'm reminded of
what it feels like...

516
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,181
to have my underwear
yanked up my ass...

517
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:44,193
by some big football player.

518
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:46,593
And where are those guys now?

519
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:52,929
They're not working nights at Target.
I'll tell you that.

520
00:39:53,004 --> 00:39:55,632
Yeah, You know...

521
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:57,674
I look at my yearbook...

522
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:01,075
and I see
four fabulous years...

523
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:04,180
that are gonna be the
highlight of my life.

524
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:06,182
Here's what it's like.

525
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,775
First you feel a hand
going down your pants...

526
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:12,050
and tighten around
the elastic waistband.

527
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:13,147
Highlight.

528
00:40:13,224 --> 00:40:14,970
- Sometimes I'd actually see stars.
- It's not going to get better.

529
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:16,716
- Sometimes I'd actually see stars.
- It's not going to get better.

530
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:18,762
If I was particularly unlucky,

531
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:23,425
my shorts would rip completely free
and I'd get this really drastic...

532
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:25,469
Do you hear me?

533
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:28,429
Yeah.

534
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:34,768
I don't really care about a graphic
description of a childhood prank.

535
00:40:35,513 --> 00:40:37,743
That prank was a motif in my life.

536
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:45,583
You know, I'm locked
in this store here...

537
00:40:45,656 --> 00:40:48,853
because I didn't have
the guts to steal a skirt...

538
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:51,258
so I could get arrested
and embarrass my father...

539
00:40:51,328 --> 00:40:54,229
in this stupid,
desperate, childish,

540
00:40:54,298 --> 00:40:56,289
pathetic attempt to leave home.

541
00:40:57,835 --> 00:40:59,769
You have your underwear
yanked up your ass.

542
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:02,931
I have my entire life
yanked up my ass!

543
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:06,977
You were speaking figuratively.
I was speaking literally.

544
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:10,571
And you're happy.
You're happy.

545
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:11,945
I'm not happy.

546
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:15,611
I'm working nights.
Everybody thinks I'm a liar.

547
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:18,018
My whole family's
laughing at me.

548
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:20,922
Reverend Harwell gave me
the finger last week.

549
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:23,152
At least you have
some control over your life.

550
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:25,661
- So do you.
- My father controls my life.

551
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,666
You're over 18.
You can tell him to drop dead.

552
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:33,101
- So can you.
- I don't want to.

553
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,798
I like living at home.

554
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:39,434
- No, you don't.
- Am I a garden snail?

555
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,879
An involuntary muscle
in a janitor suit?

556
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:45,040
I know what I want to do.

557
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:47,084
What could
you possibly like...

558
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:49,119
about living at
home at your age?

559
00:41:49,186 --> 00:41:53,088
The meals are great.
I mean, there's cable.

560
00:41:55,593 --> 00:41:58,426
The accommodations
are excellent, five-star.

561
00:41:58,496 --> 00:42:00,430
What do you care if
I'm living at home or not?

562
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:04,493
Hey, I didn't come here
to irritate you.

563
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:07,162
Well, you're beginning to.

564
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:11,940
Great.
That's really great.

565
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:15,045
I gotta stop saying
those kinds of things.

566
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:18,376
Those freakin' kids!
I knew I couldn't trust 'em.

567
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:21,315
Town liar.
That's a nice rep.

568
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:23,512
I bet it was Gregory,
that little weasel.

569
00:42:23,587 --> 00:42:26,750
Top secret, and they still
shoot off their mouths!

570
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:28,951
If I'd really been
a French spy,

571
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:31,460
those little tots
would've gotten me killed!

572
00:42:31,528 --> 00:42:34,793
Piano wire wrapped around my neck.
My testicles shoved down my throat.

573
00:42:34,865 --> 00:42:37,857
A piece of dynamite
stuck up my ass!

574
00:42:42,906 --> 00:42:45,340
She's so beautiful.

575
00:42:46,743 --> 00:42:49,109
And I'm the town liar.

576
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:56,451
# Sha-la-la-la-la
La-la-la #

577
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,455
# Sha-la-la-la-la
La-la-la #

578
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:04,692
# Sha-la-la-la-la
La-la-la #

579
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:08,197
# Sha-la-la-la-la
La-la-la #

580
00:43:08,265 --> 00:43:12,861
# Shiny boat through
the open doorway #

581
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,640
# Fell in love
on a summer day #

582
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,774
# You're only young once
but that's all right #

583
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:36,484
# Because it's just
so good to be alive #

584
00:43:38,462 --> 00:43:41,863
# Take away your troubles
Take them out the door #

585
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:47,734
# Ohh, nothing on my mind
except my new love #

586
00:43:50,774 --> 00:43:55,302
# Nothing on my mind
except my new love #

587
00:43:58,048 --> 00:44:01,040
# Sha-la-la-la-la
La-la-la #

588
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:05,350
# Sha-la-la-la-la
La-la-la ##

589
00:44:31,848 --> 00:44:35,807
Jim, there's
no reason to lie right now.

590
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:38,821
There's no one to impress.

591
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:42,381
I'm not impressed by a man
telling me he likes living at home.

592
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:45,826
Excuse me, I'm not lying,

593
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:47,830
and I'm not trying
to impress you.

594
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:50,025
So if you'll excuse me,

595
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,092
I have to clean dead flies
out of the lighting fixtures.

596
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,037
Okay, my error.
I apologize.

597
00:44:56,106 --> 00:44:59,598
It's just that I
can't imagine a man...

598
00:44:59,676 --> 00:45:03,669
giving up his independence,
his right to mate,

599
00:45:03,747 --> 00:45:05,772
to have a family,

600
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:10,411
to build a life for himself,
for good cooking.

601
00:45:10,487 --> 00:45:11,818
Hold on.

602
00:45:11,888 --> 00:45:14,618
I have not given
up my right to mate.

603
00:45:14,691 --> 00:45:17,125
I have the right to mate...

604
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:20,163
anytime I feel like mating.

605
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,221
You go out with someone.

606
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:26,201
You bring her home.
You introduce her to...

607
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:29,966
Mom, Dad, Sis, Billy,

608
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,598
Wolfie the dog.

609
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:36,078
Cocktails in the rumpus room,
and then do it on the bunk bed?

610
00:45:38,148 --> 00:45:40,378
Let's analyze that remark.

611
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,781
I don't have a dog,

612
00:45:41,852 --> 00:45:44,116
my brother's
not named Billy,

613
00:45:44,187 --> 00:45:46,655
and I don't even
have a rumpus room.

614
00:45:46,723 --> 00:45:48,748
You know what I mean.

615
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:57,127
Yeah, I know what you mean.

616
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,363
Spit on me,
make me feel lousy.

617
00:46:05,475 --> 00:46:06,942
Jim?

618
00:46:08,512 --> 00:46:10,946
You said something
that wasn't true.

619
00:46:12,115 --> 00:46:13,776
No.

620
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:19,789
No, I said that I can
have sex when I want to, and I do.

621
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,816
However, I was
looking forward...

622
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:25,987
to a nice, quiet evening
of janitoring.

623
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:29,430
I don't think you see
what I'm getting at.

624
00:46:29,499 --> 00:46:31,433
I see what you're getting at.

625
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:34,834
I'm a lying monk with an Oedipus complex
and an appetite for home cooking.

626
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:37,100
Don't forget,
you're the indecisive shoplifter.

627
00:46:37,174 --> 00:46:38,698
Yes! Exactly.

628
00:46:38,775 --> 00:46:41,710
I would do anything
to be in your shoes.

629
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:44,178
These are Darnell's shoes.

630
00:46:44,247 --> 00:46:47,944
You have freedom,
and you're not using it.

631
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:50,043
It makes me sad.

632
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,817
You have the wealth of the entire town,
and you're trying to get arrested.

633
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:57,883
- That makes me sad.
- That makes me sad, too.

634
00:46:57,961 --> 00:47:01,226
- That's pretty stupid.
- It's very stupid.

635
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:03,232
Are you serious?

636
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,700
I mean, you haven't
been drinking?

637
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:08,067
This isn't
the bottle talking?

638
00:47:08,138 --> 00:47:10,197
No.

639
00:47:10,273 --> 00:47:13,538
Then why don't you
just talk to the guy?

640
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:18,179
For the same reason that
you can't leave home,

641
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:21,706
I can't tell my father
to go to hell.

642
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:23,719
Why not?

643
00:47:25,922 --> 00:47:29,653
Because I don't
want to be alone.

644
00:47:56,586 --> 00:47:59,555
Mr. McClellan?

645
00:47:59,623 --> 00:48:03,821
You ever have any family problems,
you and your daughter?

646
00:48:03,894 --> 00:48:07,330
What the hell
do you think this is?

647
00:48:07,397 --> 00:48:09,331
You got a point.

648
00:48:14,538 --> 00:48:17,302
Would you go
with me somewhere?

649
00:48:19,276 --> 00:48:21,506
- Where?
- Florida?

650
00:48:21,578 --> 00:48:24,138
Wyoming? Spain?

651
00:48:24,214 --> 00:48:26,910
It doesn't really matter,
just away somewhere.

652
00:48:27,884 --> 00:48:29,146
I'd love to.

653
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,711
I just can't afford to be...

654
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:35,417
capricious and carefree
like yourself.

655
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:39,019
I've gotta set my sights on
something, and really go for it.

656
00:48:39,696 --> 00:48:42,893
- Night janitor?
- It's a beginning.

657
00:48:42,966 --> 00:48:45,366
- I-I'm lookin' at...
- It's an end.

658
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:50,796
Maybe if you had
a destination in mind,

659
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:53,604
that would make all the
difference in the worid.

660
00:48:53,677 --> 00:48:56,908
- Why?
- Well, uh,

661
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,916
I'm just not built to
aimlessly roam the worid.

662
00:49:00,984 --> 00:49:03,350
I'm too conservative for that.

663
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:08,747
Well, I was thinking
about Los Ángeles.

664
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:11,919
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

665
00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:15,988
- What for?
- Live, work.

666
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:18,557
- At what?
- Whatever.

667
00:49:18,635 --> 00:49:21,729
And what about
your father?

668
00:49:21,805 --> 00:49:24,069
When I don't die,

669
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,200
he'll realize I can
make it on my own.

670
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:30,947
If I do, he'll have the satisfaction
of knowing that I can't.

671
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:34,141
If he brings me back,
or if I go back on my own,

672
00:49:34,217 --> 00:49:36,651
he's just gonna beat
the shit out of me.

673
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,019
- So it doesn't make a difference.
- Literally?

674
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:44,359
Yeah.

675
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:49,228
- Sad.
- Yeah, it's sad.

676
00:49:49,299 --> 00:49:52,666
Until he throws you across
the room, it's sad.

677
00:49:52,736 --> 00:49:55,830
I'm afraid to live with him,
and I'm afraid to live without...

678
00:49:55,905 --> 00:50:00,239
You didn't come to work
to hear this stuff. I'm really sorry.

679
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,336
I'm gonna clean this up.

680
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:11,977
I'm just surprised.

681
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:14,853
I thought everything
was okay, you know.

682
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:17,859
I figured you got a nice car,
a nice house, some money.

683
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:22,159
- Everything's okay.
- It should be, but it's not.

684
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:24,359
It's twisted
and it's distorted,

685
00:50:24,434 --> 00:50:28,336
and it can't be changed
and it cannot be saved.

686
00:50:34,711 --> 00:50:35,973
I'll go with you.

687
00:50:40,784 --> 00:50:42,752
Really?

688
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:44,954
Yeah.

689
00:50:46,723 --> 00:50:48,657
We have to get a car.

690
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:51,993
Let's get through
the night, first.

691
00:50:52,061 --> 00:50:54,188
- I have money.
- How much?

692
00:50:54,264 --> 00:50:56,289
Fifty-two thousand dollars.

693
00:50:58,768 --> 00:50:59,860
On you?

694
00:51:01,938 --> 00:51:03,929
In my purse.

695
00:51:15,752 --> 00:51:19,449
Fifty-two thousand dollars.
Wow.

696
00:51:19,522 --> 00:51:22,719
I've never seen
so much money in my life.

697
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:25,226
This is more than
my house cost.

698
00:51:25,595 --> 00:51:29,429
Jim, now that I'm
spending the night,

699
00:51:29,499 --> 00:51:31,467
how can I pay you back...

700
00:51:31,534 --> 00:51:33,934
for being so cold
to you in high school?

701
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:38,939
Do you need an
answer right away?

702
00:51:39,008 --> 00:51:42,944
No. Sometime before
the sun comes up.

703
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:48,915
Well, uh,

704
00:51:48,985 --> 00:51:51,453
you're probably not
going to remember this,

705
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:53,455
but, uh,

706
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:56,185
there was a homecoming dance
our sophomore year.

707
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:59,888
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you remember Mrs. Noble?

708
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:04,662
Large, hairy gym teacher with
suspiciously cumbersome groin bulge?

709
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:06,599
I had her for two years.

710
00:52:06,669 --> 00:52:08,603
She made everybody
switch partners...

711
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:10,798
because the fat giris
were dancing together,

712
00:52:10,874 --> 00:52:13,035
and the doinks, myself included, were
against the wall blowing spit bubbles.

713
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:14,474
Right.

714
00:52:14,544 --> 00:52:18,002
Well, for three-quarters...

715
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:21,107
of one verse of a slow song,

716
00:52:21,184 --> 00:52:23,379
we danced together.

717
00:52:24,754 --> 00:52:26,244
You reeked of Stri-Dex.

718
00:52:27,257 --> 00:52:29,589
Oh, no, that was Larry Fry.

719
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:32,025
I'm sorry.

720
00:52:32,095 --> 00:52:34,222
I don't remember.

721
00:52:35,832 --> 00:52:39,563
- You got your hair caught in my braces.
- I don't remember.

722
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:42,764
Well, it's not important.

723
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,171
I had...
Well, I had just always...

724
00:52:48,244 --> 00:52:50,838
dreamed of finishing that dance.

725
00:52:53,716 --> 00:52:54,808
Okay.

726
00:52:58,154 --> 00:53:00,748
Don't feel you have
to answer right away.

727
00:53:00,823 --> 00:53:04,816
It's just a small portion
of my life that's incomplete.

728
00:53:04,894 --> 00:53:07,488
I thought you were gonna
say something different.

729
00:53:13,803 --> 00:53:15,737
Well,

730
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:19,069
first things first.

731
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:38,389
# When things go wrong #

732
00:53:40,163 --> 00:53:43,155
# As they sometimes will #

733
00:53:43,232 --> 00:53:48,864
# When the road you're trodding
seems all uphill #

734
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,336
# When the funds are low #

735
00:53:56,412 --> 00:53:59,279
# And the debts are high #

736
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:05,515
# And you wanna smile
but you have to sigh #

737
00:54:08,157 --> 00:54:15,063
# When care is pressing
you down a bit #

738
00:54:15,131 --> 00:54:20,967
# Rest if you must #

739
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:25,031
# But don't you quit #

740
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:29,840
# Oh no #

741
00:54:29,912 --> 00:54:33,609
# Don't you quit #

742
00:54:34,884 --> 00:54:37,580
# Oh no #

743
00:54:52,468 --> 00:54:56,302
# But you never can tell #

744
00:54:56,372 --> 00:55:00,672
# How close you are #

745
00:55:00,743 --> 00:55:07,114
# It may be near
when it seems so far #

746
00:55:07,183 --> 00:55:09,151
# Ooo ooo ##

747
00:55:21,998 --> 00:55:24,626
You're ticklish there?

748
00:55:44,587 --> 00:55:46,350
Aaah!

749
00:55:49,058 --> 00:55:50,923
Ow.

750
00:56:22,024 --> 00:56:23,958
Officer Don!

751
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:28,986
You scared the crap out of me.
I thought it was the custodian.

752
00:56:29,065 --> 00:56:30,930
What are you doing?

753
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,403
I work here now.

754
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:39,575
You wanna let me in?

755
00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:43,579
I'd love to.
I don't have the keys.

756
00:56:43,647 --> 00:56:45,581
I'm locked in 'til 7 a.m.

757
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:49,710
- What's going on?
- Have you seen Josie McClellan?

758
00:56:50,954 --> 00:56:52,319
Of course.

759
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:57,588
Uh, dark hair,
green eyes, beautiful.

760
00:56:57,661 --> 00:56:59,060
Oh, yeah. Of course.

761
00:56:59,129 --> 00:57:02,621
- You seen her recently?
- Oh!

762
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:05,634
Ah... I just
saw her yesterday.

763
00:57:05,702 --> 00:57:07,966
We had a cup
of java together.

764
00:57:08,038 --> 00:57:09,630
She come into the store?

765
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:12,698
I don't know.
I only work nights.

766
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:16,837
- Why?
- Well... she's missing.

767
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:21,407
I was looking this side
of town for her and I come past.

768
00:57:21,484 --> 00:57:24,282
I seen that
the outside sign's on.

769
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:28,654
- The outside sign's never on.
- Oh, yeah.

770
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:33,162
Did you try the library?
Maybe she fell asleep reading.

771
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:35,589
No.

772
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:37,633
She's probably screwing somebody...

773
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:40,169
the old man don't approve of.

774
00:57:45,408 --> 00:57:51,108
Would you know if the custodian
comes by to check up on people?

775
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:54,275
I wouldn't think
he'd do that, Jimmy.

776
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:56,512
I feel pretty good now.

777
00:58:05,996 --> 00:58:07,987
I'm sorry, sir.

778
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:10,828
I had to practice
a little therapy.

779
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,130
Boy's in his own worid.

780
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:21,404
# Can't believe
you've left me #

781
00:58:21,478 --> 00:58:23,275
# So know that
you've upset me #

782
00:58:23,346 --> 00:58:25,109
# You just want
to forget me #

783
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:26,944
# Why don't you
come and get me #

784
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:28,780
# And, boy
I really miss you #

785
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:30,615
# And all I wanna do
is kiss you #

786
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:32,382
# I've used up
all my tissues #

787
00:58:32,455 --> 00:58:34,252
# 'Cause it's more serious
some issues #

788
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:36,189
# I don't even know
the reason #

789
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:37,851
# You were playin'
and you were teasin' #

790
00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:39,690
# Didn't tell me
you were leavin' #

791
00:58:39,763 --> 00:58:42,027
# Those good looks
are deceivin' #

792
00:58:42,098 --> 00:58:45,590
# Where are you, baby
We used to have so much fun #

793
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:47,432
# You drive me crazy #

794
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:49,631
# Somebody tell me
where he's gone #

795
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:53,107
# Where are you, baby
We used to have so much fun #

796
00:58:53,176 --> 00:58:56,077
# You drive me crazy #

797
00:58:56,146 --> 00:58:57,875
# You peep in
through the window #

798
00:58:57,947 --> 00:58:59,881
# This is too much
for me to handle #

799
00:58:59,949 --> 00:59:03,350
# Already caused a scandal
a disturbance like a vandal #

800
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,285
# I've lost track
of all time #

801
00:59:05,355 --> 00:59:07,448
# 'Cause you're always
on my mind #

802
00:59:07,524 --> 00:59:09,856
# You're just that type of guy
that'll make me cry #

803
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:12,417
# Oh why, oh why, oh why
Oh why has he disappeared #

804
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:14,156
# This feeling
is really weird #

805
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:18,667
# You're reckless and you're dear
Can you feel when I drop these tears #

806
00:59:18,735 --> 00:59:21,670
# Where are you, baby
We used to have so much fun #

807
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:24,104
# You drive me crazy #

808
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:25,971
# Somebody tell me
where he's gone #

809
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:29,341
# Where are you, baby
We used to have so much fun #

810
00:59:29,412 --> 00:59:31,744
# You drive me crazy #

811
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:58,871
# Where are you, baby
We used to have so much fun ##

812
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:06,482
Aaah!

813
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:47,682
Why don't we get
underneath the bench?

814
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:53,588
Do you want to get on top?

815
01:01:00,804 --> 01:01:02,669
You check the office.
I'll scope the dressing rooms.

816
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:04,366
Right.

817
01:01:12,982 --> 01:01:15,644
You're on top.

818
01:01:16,753 --> 01:01:19,278
- Did you want to be on top?
- Oh, no.

819
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:22,051
I'm fine where I am.

820
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:24,059
Sure.

821
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:00,120
Ow, ow, ow.

822
01:02:02,365 --> 01:02:05,732
I think he went
to the back.

823
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:18,370
Evening.

824
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:24,176
Nice.

825
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:26,188
Excellent.

826
01:02:26,256 --> 01:02:30,659
Hey, you got a tattoo?

827
01:02:31,694 --> 01:02:32,718
No, sir.

828
01:02:32,795 --> 01:02:36,287
- Not you, asshole!
- I'm a missing person.

829
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:38,994
The whole town
is looking for me.

830
01:02:39,068 --> 01:02:41,559
- You hidin' out?
- Yes.

831
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:44,698
I'd appreciate it
if you'd let us sit up.

832
01:02:44,774 --> 01:02:48,801
- What about the tattoo?
- I don't have one.

833
01:02:48,878 --> 01:02:52,075
- You owe me a buck.
- Actually, it's up to two.

834
01:02:52,148 --> 01:02:54,673
I borrowed that one
off you at Burger King.

835
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:56,946
Excuse me!

836
01:02:58,087 --> 01:03:00,248
Are you planning to shoot us
in the back of the head?

837
01:03:00,323 --> 01:03:03,986
We haven't decided yet,
have we?

838
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,153
Who are you?

839
01:03:06,229 --> 01:03:09,221
Ah... you don't
want to know.

840
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:11,665
Wouldn't have asked if
he didn't want to know!

841
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:15,465
- He's a little crazy. He's my brother.
- That's not true.

842
01:03:15,538 --> 01:03:17,631
She doesn't even know me.

843
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:20,801
- Somebody better start
talking straight here.
- That's the truth.

844
01:03:20,877 --> 01:03:22,936
Okay.

845
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:25,905
You want to know?

846
01:03:27,483 --> 01:03:28,450
Mm-hmm.

847
01:03:28,518 --> 01:03:31,419
Okay, good. But...

848
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:33,981
come on over here.

849
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:38,160
- What?
- Come on over.

850
01:03:38,294 --> 01:03:39,761
Come on over here!

851
01:03:39,828 --> 01:03:41,796
Over here.

852
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:00,181
Come on down here.

853
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:04,886
That's right.
Down here!

854
01:04:07,523 --> 01:04:09,320
Okay.

855
01:04:10,392 --> 01:04:13,555
You dumb sons of bitches!

856
01:04:13,629 --> 01:04:16,826
Do you realize
that you have just walked...

857
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:20,357
straight into a $60-million
drug transaction?

858
01:04:23,372 --> 01:04:27,809
You're running this multi-zillion-dollar
drug transaction by yourself?

859
01:04:27,876 --> 01:04:32,040
- Little Target boy?
- No.

860
01:04:32,114 --> 01:04:34,582
No, I'm not
doing it by myself.

861
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,709
Oh, no, no.

862
01:04:36,785 --> 01:04:39,720
As a matter of fact,

863
01:04:39,788 --> 01:04:42,222
in about 10 minutes...

864
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:44,987
this place is gonna
be alive with the meanest,

865
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:49,429
ugliest, most impatient animals
you guys have ever seen.

866
01:04:49,498 --> 01:04:52,831
I'll give you five minutes
to take...

867
01:04:52,901 --> 01:04:55,131
whatever you want
in the whole store.

868
01:04:55,204 --> 01:04:57,604
I won't tell.
Take your guns and go.

869
01:04:58,974 --> 01:05:00,339
Okay, then,
who's the girl?

870
01:05:02,678 --> 01:05:06,307
- I'm his hostage.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

871
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:09,374
Is that true?
Hmm?

872
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:12,318
Yes!
Yes, it's true.

873
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:14,379
And, um...

874
01:05:17,259 --> 01:05:21,355
if the deal doesn't go down,
she becomes pig feed.

875
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:22,556
Bullshit.

876
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:24,792
Oh, really?

877
01:05:27,603 --> 01:05:30,731
- Well, blow her away.
- That's bullshit!

878
01:05:32,241 --> 01:05:34,732
Okay.

879
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,837
Then give me your guns
and I'll do it for you.

880
01:05:38,914 --> 01:05:40,643
It's bullshit, right?

881
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,575
We'll see.

882
01:05:46,355 --> 01:05:47,447
Roll over.

883
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:49,457
- You heard him.
- What?

884
01:05:49,525 --> 01:05:51,584
Roll over!
You too, honey.

885
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,958
You heard me.
Roll over. Do it!

886
01:05:54,029 --> 01:05:56,862
Come on, come on!
Roll! That's it.

887
01:05:56,932 --> 01:06:00,459
- Very good.
- Mmm! Yeah.

888
01:06:00,536 --> 01:06:03,937
Um... give me the guns!

889
01:06:04,907 --> 01:06:07,171
No way, man.
Uh-uh.

890
01:06:07,242 --> 01:06:08,470
Fine.

891
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:12,446
You do it.
I don't need her anymore.

892
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:15,449
- I only needed her
to get through customs.
- I don't like this.

893
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:17,542
This sucks.
It's not worth it.

894
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:21,612
- We don't have time. Do it!
- All right.

895
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:25,856
It's nothing personal.

896
01:06:25,994 --> 01:06:28,588
- Jim!
- Too late. They're here!

897
01:06:28,664 --> 01:06:30,757
It's too late.
They're here.

898
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:34,166
Men, hold your fire.

899
01:06:34,236 --> 01:06:37,672
Ned, Tommy,
hold your fire.

900
01:06:37,739 --> 01:06:40,902
There are infrared scopes
trained on your heads.

901
01:06:40,976 --> 01:06:45,003
- We didn't want this!
- It's the girl you want, not us!

902
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,106
Ned, we got a WD-40.
That's right, a full-scale PMS.

903
01:06:48,183 --> 01:06:50,617
Okay, everybody just relax!

904
01:06:50,686 --> 01:06:54,122
Everybody, just relax!
The place is gonna blow.

905
01:06:54,189 --> 01:06:57,420
Just relax.
Now, put down your guns.

906
01:06:57,493 --> 01:07:00,621
They're putting down the guns.
Are you putting them down?

907
01:07:00,696 --> 01:07:03,529
Get down 'cause
lives are at stake.

908
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,966
Let go. Now get back.

909
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:10,436
Get back. Spread 'em.
Spread the legs. Put down the dogs.

910
01:07:10,506 --> 01:07:12,736
Okay, put the dogs down.

911
01:07:12,808 --> 01:07:14,400
Both of 'em!

912
01:07:14,476 --> 01:07:16,967
Put the dogs down!
Down!

913
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:21,141
- That was great!
- I got a surprise for you guys.

914
01:07:21,216 --> 01:07:24,481
We have a bit
of a surprise for you.

915
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:27,185
Them guns aren't loaded.

916
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:41,762
I got an idea.
How about a truce?

917
01:07:41,837 --> 01:07:44,806
I'm full of shit.
You're full of shit.

918
01:07:44,873 --> 01:07:47,307
Everybody at one time
is full of shit.

919
01:07:47,376 --> 01:07:50,971
I'll throw on some corn dogs
and we'll get to know each other.

920
01:07:51,046 --> 01:07:53,708
I'd like to know what
goes on inside your heads.

921
01:07:53,782 --> 01:07:56,615
- Okay, you had the big one...
- No.

922
01:07:56,685 --> 01:08:00,519
Sorry. I could've sworn
you had the big one.

923
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:02,079
Ha!

924
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:05,016
I lied.

925
01:08:09,531 --> 01:08:12,796
These are the men that
killed that guy in Saltburg.

926
01:08:12,868 --> 01:08:16,304
I'm fairly sure
that we're gonna die.

927
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:19,306
I'm disappointed we're not
going to California together.

928
01:08:19,374 --> 01:08:22,241
We're not dead yet.

929
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:25,109
Pretty darn close.

930
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,808
If I can get them
to take me with them,

931
01:08:27,883 --> 01:08:30,750
maybe I can get away
and come back for you.

932
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:34,277
We need a car and
they obviously have one.

933
01:08:34,356 --> 01:08:36,256
Just...

934
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:38,793
- go along with whatever I do.
- Okay.

935
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:53,169
So, what's the word
on you two?

936
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:56,973
Are you married?
Obviously...

937
01:08:57,045 --> 01:09:00,105
you're hack crooks if you can't
pull off a discount store job.

938
01:09:02,517 --> 01:09:05,077
What were you planning
to steal? Hair spray?

939
01:09:09,424 --> 01:09:10,413
Sorry.

940
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:15,927
Lady, you got a job?

941
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:19,193
No.

942
01:09:19,268 --> 01:09:21,099
Then don't knock ours.

943
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:25,030
Crime isn't a job.
It's a sickness.

944
01:09:28,944 --> 01:09:32,710
Whoops. Anyone
have some change?

945
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:46,992
You look like a lady
in need of a quarter.

946
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:49,656
I might need more
than just a quarter.

947
01:09:52,601 --> 01:09:55,035
- You know...
- No.

948
01:09:55,103 --> 01:09:57,094
You and I could make
a lot of money.

949
01:09:57,172 --> 01:09:59,936
Honey, me and Nestor are partners.

950
01:10:00,008 --> 01:10:04,206
- We don't need a third.
- You don't know, so shut up.

951
01:10:08,183 --> 01:10:10,549
Hop on.

952
01:10:26,468 --> 01:10:30,268
Now.
Let's go now.

953
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:33,597
Know what you are?

954
01:10:33,675 --> 01:10:35,108
Yeah.

955
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:37,771
You are one good-looking
ball of trouble.

956
01:10:40,182 --> 01:10:41,376
Good.

957
01:10:52,895 --> 01:10:56,524
# Ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya #

958
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:02,332
# Ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya #

959
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:08,100
# Go #

960
01:11:18,754 --> 01:11:20,813
What do you think,
for the car?

961
01:11:20,889 --> 01:11:24,655
- This one?
- The whole thing. We'll lay it in back.

962
01:11:24,726 --> 01:11:27,126
We got multi-cassette
capabilities.

963
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:28,992
Think of the sound!

964
01:11:29,064 --> 01:11:32,431
# Ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya #

965
01:11:34,236 --> 01:11:38,229
# Ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya #

966
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:43,677
# Ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya #

967
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,442
# Ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya #

968
01:11:50,886 --> 01:11:54,583
# Ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya #

969
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:59,318
I'm not helping you
load your car.

970
01:11:59,394 --> 01:12:00,827
Think again, boy.

971
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:03,888
You're not taking the
stolen merchandise out.

972
01:12:03,966 --> 01:12:06,230
- I'm not gonna let you.
- Get out.

973
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:08,394
It's stolen.
All of it!

974
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:10,404
- Gimme that!
- No!

975
01:12:10,472 --> 01:12:12,804
- Give it to me!
- It's mine!

976
01:12:16,945 --> 01:12:18,970
But where...

977
01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:21,515
Wait a minute.

978
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:26,880
- You're not going with them?
- Yeah.

979
01:12:26,955 --> 01:12:30,152
You'll be an accessory.

980
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:34,127
- So?
- You don't know anything about them.

981
01:12:34,196 --> 01:12:36,494
You certainly don't know
anything about him!

982
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:39,033
These are hardened
criminals here!

983
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:41,501
That's enough!

984
01:12:42,704 --> 01:12:45,434
Don't waste your time.
You could get a hernia.

985
01:12:45,507 --> 01:12:48,101
If my foot could talk,

986
01:12:48,176 --> 01:12:51,339
it'd say, "May I please
go up this geek's ass?"

987
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:53,643
- Forget him!
- All right.

988
01:12:53,715 --> 01:12:56,878
He's no use to us.
He's built like an oyster.

989
01:12:56,952 --> 01:12:58,351
Listen.

990
01:13:00,722 --> 01:13:02,952
If you tell on us,

991
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:05,118
I'll kill you.

992
01:13:09,798 --> 01:13:11,732
Fine.

993
01:13:16,138 --> 01:13:18,538
Jim?

994
01:13:26,848 --> 01:13:28,440
Don't be an ass.

995
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:33,053
Okay, Jimbo?

996
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:37,882
Let's go, shall we?

997
01:14:04,853 --> 01:14:07,321
Ahem.

998
01:14:07,389 --> 01:14:08,913
C'mon, come on!

999
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:28,509
You got it?

1000
01:14:28,577 --> 01:14:30,670
I got 'em, I got 'em.

1001
01:15:53,361 --> 01:15:56,125
That wasn't a store robbery.

1002
01:15:56,198 --> 01:15:58,428
That was an assassination.

1003
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,298
That wasn't a clerk.
That was a wise guy.

1004
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:04,770
How do I know?
I spent a little time...

1005
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,899
with the FBI's
organized crime unit.

1006
01:16:06,975 --> 01:16:09,739
I'm intimately knowledgeable
with the seedy...

1007
01:16:09,811 --> 01:16:12,473
workings of the Mob in the
midwest section of this country.

1008
01:16:13,515 --> 01:16:15,915
I know a gangland slaying
when I see one,

1009
01:16:15,984 --> 01:16:19,784
and that's exactly
what this baby is.

1010
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:22,483
I'd look into it
myself personally,

1011
01:16:22,557 --> 01:16:24,923
but I got a date tonight.

1012
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,430
Attention, Target shoppers.

1013
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:24,448
Jim?

1014
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,974
He is so cool!

1015
01:19:03,851 --> 01:19:06,945
# Got my ray-bans on
every day and night #

1016
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,387
# Got a one-track mind
that I wanna hide #

1017
01:19:10,457 --> 01:19:13,756
# Got an easy job
that I try to keep #

1018
01:19:13,827 --> 01:19:17,160
# Got a bunch of giris
and I got 'em cheap #

1019
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:20,598
# Got a million things
that I wanna do #

1020
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:24,694
# But I waste my time
hangin' out with you #

1021
01:19:24,772 --> 01:19:28,208
# It's not because
I'm really easy to please #

1022
01:19:28,275 --> 01:19:31,574
# It's not the way you
bring me down on my knees #

1023
01:19:31,645 --> 01:19:34,614
# It's just a feeling
but it keeps coming back #

1024
01:19:34,681 --> 01:19:37,013
# It's a tiny little
heart attack #
