1
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,702
With one <i>Yuko</i> each,

2
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,205
the Finals match is intense.

3
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,790
They are sizing each other up.

4
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,502
They are moving to check
each other's condition.

5
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,004
THE BIBLE

6
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,384
As we speak, Ko Doo-young tries
foot skills.

7
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,345
Ko is trying <i>Kouci Makikomi!</i>

8
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,679
Excellent! It worked!

9
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,597
Nice approach!

10
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,849
Ko Doo-young earned anotherÂ <i>Yuko.</i>

11
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,440
Ko should stand strong.

12
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,692
Tamada is pushing him hard.

13
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,027
-Correct.
-He got caught.

14
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,195
This is not good!

15
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,948
Ko lost a half-point.

16
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,158
-He must escape.
-Tamada is trying scarf hold.

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,119
He must get free from there.

18
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,249
Ko shouldn't lose in the grip battle.

19
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,959
-Pushing him out!
-A chance!

20
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,752
<i>-Uchimata!</i>
-He locked!

21
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,254
Good!

22
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,493
Doo-young!

23
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,005
<i>The optic nerve was critically damaged.</i>

24
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,634
<i>No treatment or transplant will fix</i>
<i>the damage.</i>

25
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,637
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

26
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,681
<i>he lost his sight completely.</i>

27
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,863
You applied this year too?

28
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,948
Yes, nice to see you again.

29
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,328
If you are granted parole,
do you have a plan after that?

30
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,914
I see...

31
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,459
you didn't get any licenses.

32
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,002
I didn't get any licenses.

33
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,589
In fact, I don't deserve to get out.

34
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,926
I scammed other people for money.

35
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,887
Thinking about those
upon whom I inflicted pain,

36
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,725
I should be stuck here
even after my time is served.

37
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,772
-Is that just an act to get parole?
-Not at all.

38
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:56,194
I've scammed people.
But I can't do that to God.

39
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,077
Ko Doo-young?

40
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,622
Why are you...

41
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,040
He is...

42
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,876
my younger brother.

43
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,338
I was always in trouble
so I never talked about him.

44
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,382
I didn't want to be a problem for him.

45
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,926
My parents passed away at the same time.

46
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,595
Now my only bother lost his...

47
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,558
I'm a bad person.

48
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,604
I deserve to be punished, but...

49
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,527
I worry about him so much
I can't even eat.

50
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,822
He must be in despair
after losing his sight.

51
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,824
I wonder if he's eating okay,

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,535
or if he's injured.

53
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,497
He is the only reason

54
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,709
that I applied for parole.

55
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,503
That's it.

56
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,218
I'll take this back.

57
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,681
Doo-young...

58
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,147
Tears are falling.

59
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,004
Doo-young shines light on my life!

60
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,944
My toe, damn it!

61
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,114
Damn!

62
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,869
This shouldn't be the way
to welcome me after a decade.

63
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,845
Jeez, freaking messy.

64
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,446
Look at this shitty house. What the...

65
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,956
It stinks!

66
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,425
Are you Doo-young?

67
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,848
Why didn't you open the door,
you son of a bitch?

68
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,725
Right.

69
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,686
You became blind!

70
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,938
It's damn dark here.

71
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,152
Get out.

72
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,028
Asshole!

73
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,124
It's been a while.

74
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:39,959
Get lost.

75
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,388
Good!

76
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,017
Home-made ramen!

77
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,199
Fuck...

78
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,827
I didn't you'd be
helpful in my life!

79
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,370
Thank you, son of a bitch!

80
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,587
You must have gotten a call.
It's just one year.

81
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,964
I didn't want to come here either.

82
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,342
Let's stay together for one year.

83
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,053
After that,

84
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,305
I will disappear without a trace.

85
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,812
What an asshole!

86
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,526
At least greet your guest.
Where's your basic decency?

87
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,491
By the way...

88
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,536
how much is this house worth?

89
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,998
Must be worth some.
How much money you got?

90
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,084
Hey!

91
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,628
Your mom must have left you some!

92
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,589
By the way!

93
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,095
Don't even think
that I'll take care of you

94
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,972
or anything like that.

95
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,017
What are you doing?

96
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,110
-Hey.
-Let go!

97
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,491
Arrogant ass.
You can't even take a few steps.

98
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,329
I will get lost to my room,
so continue.

99
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,525
One Lamborghini Ice Tornado.

100
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,277
What?

101
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,655
Lamborghini Ice... Over there!

102
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,614
Hello!

103
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,949
One Lamborghini menthol, please.

104
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,534
Ah, menthol!

105
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,537
That's what I meant.

106
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,128
-Give me the same one.
-There's no more.

107
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,009
Put it down, will you?

108
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,637
I bought this.

109
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,639
Lamborghini menthol.

110
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,100
I said its exact name first.

111
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,061
Lamborghini Ice Tornado!

112
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,943
Sir.

113
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,361
Keep the change!

114
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,447
Hey! Hey!

115
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,243
-You son of a bitch!
-OK, OK.

116
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,203
-I'll give it to you.
-Damn it!

117
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,667
You fucker! Damn it!

118
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,337
If I ever see you again,
you are a dead man!

119
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,547
Son of a bitch!

120
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,884
My stomach... Why?

121
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,263
Poop now? Really?

122
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,266
You are an assho...
I really need to poop.

123
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,310
VIEW CONTACTS
DOO-YOUNG

124
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,983
Hi Doo-young, it's me, Soo-hyun.

125
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,444
You've been avoiding my calls.

126
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,115
I am in front of your home.

127
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,576
If you are inside--

128
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,581
Oh? It's open.

129
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,585
Ouch, it hurts!

130
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,301
Doo-young!

131
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,935
Doo-young.

132
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,019
Who... who are you?

133
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,562
Who... why did you hit me?

134
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,064
What's this for?

135
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,318
What are you two?
Are you his girlfriend?

136
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,530
I guess Doo-young doesn't eat.

137
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,782
He will when he's hungry.
He's not a kid.

138
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,869
You know what I mean!

139
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,497
Why are you yelling?

140
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,962
Let's eat, Doo-young!

141
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,255
What's up with her?

142
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,466
Doo-young, get up.
Let's ea--

143
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,677
What's wrong?

144
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,929
Open your eyes!

145
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,645
Listen.

146
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,773
I didn't get out to bury you.

147
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,360
If you want to die, do it quietly
without this fuss.

148
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,239
Or eat something and live.

149
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,133
He apparently didn't eat.

150
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,010
Malnutrition? Does this make sense?

151
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,181
He had more than national-level skill.
He had national-level physique!

152
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,809
Shouldn't you at least check
if he eats and drinks?

153
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,019
Take him then.

154
00:14:55,853 --> 00:15:00,357
If you are that worried, take him.
You care too much for a coach.

155
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,483
What do you mean?

156
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,736
You said he was strong.

157
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,112
He must bang you well!

158
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,156
You are trash!

159
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,207
Yeah, my life is trashy
because of that bastard.

160
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,125
Goddammit!

161
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,294
Goddammit?

162
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,754
Please pay for Mr Ko.

163
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,676
The trash will take itself out.

164
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,971
I maxed out my card.

165
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,432
I don't even have a card, OK?

166
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,518
I'd fucking love to have one.

167
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,397
What the hell...

168
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,609
What's wrong with your brother?

169
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,945
I know you two are not close,

170
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,697
but he doesn't act like your brother
at all.

171
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,741
He's my half-brother.

172
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,745
No wonder.

173
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,664
It makes sense now.

174
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,043
You want me to beat you up?

175
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,796
You like making me look bad?

176
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,589
Stop the drama.

177
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,133
Sit and shove food down your throat.

178
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,344
Don't annoy me.

179
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,811
Is that ham?

180
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,824
It's Spam.

181
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,411
You fucker.

182
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,248
Did you lose your sense of smell, too?

183
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,293
Spam, my ass.
Your existence is Spam.

184
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,007
And...

185
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,344
you should thank me
for being a humanitarian.

186
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,098
I even cook for you.

187
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,226
-You call making ramen cooking?
-Don't look down on ramen.

188
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,312
Spicy ramen, udon-style ramen,
sea food ramen, and Nagasaki ramen.

189
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,273
There are so many kinds, fucker!

190
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,649
You are so insensitive.

191
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,610
You grew up on good food.

192
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,696
You can live onÂ ramen for ten years.

193
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,905
Just shut up and eat.

194
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,367
What the fuck do you care whether I eat?

195
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,207
Are you wearing my cologne?

196
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,878
What? I've had it with you!

197
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,505
What's up with your tone?

198
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,965
What about yours?

199
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,177
You son of a bitch! Damn...

200
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,303
That mouth!

201
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,430
Why was your mouth spared?

202
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,307
You should've lost your speech, too.

203
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,316
My appetite is ruined. Damn it.

204
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,044
You... son of... a bitch!

205
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,004
You can see, can't you?

206
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,006
You must see a little.

207
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,550
-Son of a bitch!
-Humanitarian?

208
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,260
-Bullshit.
-That hurts!

209
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,890
Damn. Hey!

210
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,726
What, son of a bitch?

211
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,938
Son of a bitch!

212
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,609
Ow, my stomach.

213
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,739
Apologies.

214
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,243
Even with collateral,
the borrower has to come in person.

215
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,830
Or his power of attorney.

216
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,958
Is that really necessary?

217
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,584
I'm sorry.

218
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,380
I mean... I'm his brother.

219
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,464
We are family...

220
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,552
Power of attorney...

221
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,099
Damn it.

222
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,980
Right, dried squid.

223
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,316
Sir, do you have any Coke Zero?

224
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,860
It's here!

225
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,154
Here is the money.

226
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,117
And this. Where did my Coke go?

227
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,621
That son of...

228
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,293
Hey! Get over here. I told you before.

229
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,504
If I see you again, you are dead...

230
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,923
Damn it. I picked that Coke first.

231
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,552
Well, do you live around here?

232
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,805
So what?

233
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,433
Then, let's set some ground rules.

234
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,438
Whoever pays first takes it, OK?

235
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,690
Who the hell are you?

236
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,736
None of your business.

237
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,572
Who do you think I am?

238
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,659
I... I didn't ask.

239
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,411
IDC!

240
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,662
What?

241
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,332
Search online, you old fart.

242
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,334
Give me the Coke!

243
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,211
Oh no.

244
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,838
I'm sorry... Oh my god, your suit...

245
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,590
You're dead.

246
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,176
-I will kill you, son of--
-I didn't mean to.

247
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,802
-Son of a bitch!
-Stop chasing me.

248
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,512
This whole town is aÂ psych ward!

249
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,682
You won't live next time.

250
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,227
What a shitty day today!

251
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,939
What's up with those pants?

252
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,399
It'll get soggy...

253
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,817
Eat now.

254
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,571
Do you smell sweet and sour pork?

255
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,948
OK, here.

256
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,741
Open your mouth!

257
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,409
What's this about?

258
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,161
Nothing.

259
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:50,249
My heart aches to see you
lose so much weight.

260
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,671
I guess a fork would be better.
One second.

261
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,345
I got you a fork.

262
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,974
Here! Open your mouth.

263
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,861
Hey. You do it yourself.

264
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,363
OK?

265
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,574
It's in front of you.

266
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,162
That's a carrot.

267
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,376
That's a cucumber.
Move your fork next to...

268
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,670
-Left...
-Forget it.

269
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,642
Here. I got it on the fork. Try it.

270
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,277
It's good.

271
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,404
Isn't it?

272
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,531
It is, right?

273
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,160
Eat some black bean noodles, too.

274
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,245
The noodles will get soggy.

275
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,540
No one likes soggy noodles. Eat now.

276
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,387
Now you eat, little bro!

277
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,556
Good! Very good.

278
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,436
-Did you order this from Yangtze?
-Yangtze?

279
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,562
YANGTZE

280
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,232
Damn, you are a psychic!

281
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,443
That's amazing.

282
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,780
Oh, by the way...

283
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,701
My dad and your mom...

284
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,081
The ossuary is moving.

285
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,877
So they need some paperwork.

286
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,630
My consent isn't enough,
as you are their son, too.

287
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,799
Power of attorney?

288
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,469
Or whatever it's called. So annoying.

289
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,598
I wanted to do a good thing,
but the system is freaking complicated.

290
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,266
So?

291
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,063
Where's your seal?

292
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,733
Why do you need it for moving
the ossuary?

293
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,071
What the fuck?

294
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,992
You think I'll use your seal
to scam you or something?

295
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,206
That hurts my feelings, really.

296
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,002
I'd never use your seal to scam you!

297
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,212
What the...

298
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,588
Never mind. Forget it.

299
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,509
I will justÂ spread their ashes
in the Yangjae Stream.

300
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,723
That's not what I meant.

301
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,817
Please check.

302
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,364
Wow, this is correct!

303
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,325
Thank you.

304
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,660
Good bye.

305
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,998
For under 3,000 cc,

306
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,208
this model has great mileage.

307
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,710
Take a look.

308
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,587
Oh, it opens.

309
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,048
A sunroof is a must!

310
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,800
You never drove one of these?

311
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,470
How much is it fully loaded?

312
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,181
One moment, please.

313
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,894
Do you have a disability discount?

314
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,061
Excuse me?

315
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,525
Try those macaroons.

316
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,701
Guess where I got them.

317
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:56,786
From Ichon.

318
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,247
Isn't it good?

319
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,833
You love these.

320
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,338
Doo-young.

321
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,175
Let's do judo again.

322
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,969
How can I? I'm blind now.

323
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,971
Don't take this wrong.

324
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:19,100
There is a... national Paralympics team.

325
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,985
If you get on the team, you'll--

326
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,407
I've lived hereÂ for 20 years.

327
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,619
But I can't even find my room.

328
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,704
And I should do judo?

329
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,458
Do you know what that's called?

330
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,630
Going fully retarded.

331
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,386
Want to be my light?

332
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,768
No, you can't drink that.

333
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,648
Airheads are easy targets.

334
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,328
Is this your house?-Is this your house?
-Shush.

335
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,913
-Why?
-You're so cute.

336
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,915
We got a mad dog in the house.

337
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,917
-If it wakes up, it'll be noisy.
-Oh no.

338
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,004
Take my hand and walk on your tiptoes.

339
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,017
My God, a ghost!

340
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,645
You're still up?

341
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,940
Is he the mad dog?

342
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,317
Mad dog?

343
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,236
Did I say that? No...

344
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,197
That's not what I meant.

345
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,450
Get lost before this mad dogÂ bites you.

346
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,787
Look how you talk to your brother!
Where are you going?

347
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,874
Hey, don't go.

348
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,126
Cutie! Baby!

349
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,590
Son of a bitch.

350
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,927
Don't you have any manners?

351
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:04,099
You don't even need a degree
if you have manners.

352
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,142
You blind son of a bitch!

353
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,561
I'm taking good care of you.

354
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,106
And you do this to me?

355
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,399
Dick!

356
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,736
-Gui Townhall.
-Hey, I'm still talking.

357
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,572
Hello. You came by here before.

358
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,282
I'm Go Doo-young.

359
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,369
You asked if I wanted to move
into the facility.

360
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,206
I think that might work better
than my current situation.

361
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,333
I'm wondering though.

362
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,087
Will the criminal put on parole
to help me

363
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,755
be sent back to prison?

364
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,091
He's not helping at all.

365
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,637
-Are you out of your mind, son of a bitch?
-You're driving me crazy.

366
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,557
I lived fine without you!

367
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,392
Get lost.

368
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,528
What a temper!

369
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,530
Damn.

370
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,159
Hello?

371
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,663
His skills shouldn't be wasted.

372
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,999
It's Paralympics,

373
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,542
but he can continue with judo.

374
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,836
Please convince him.

375
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,672
He didn't want to do it.

376
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,341
That's why you need to convince him.

377
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,095
Keep talking to him about it.

378
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,014
I'm a busy man.

379
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,432
You're a hooligan.

380
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,684
What?

381
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,564
You have a really nice car.
Where did you get the money?

382
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,858
You also registered Doo-young
for disability.

383
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,651
You had time for that!

384
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,115
Are you interested in me?

385
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,992
-I'm not into athletes.
-Are you nuts?

386
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,578
Then why are you so nosy?

387
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,497
Doo-young is too scaredÂ to go outside.

388
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,707
Even as a half-brother,
you're not helping.

389
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,126
He's still your brother.
How can you...

390
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,420
I've had enough of this.

391
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,673
There are even families that are not
related by blood.

392
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,841
Family, my ass.

393
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,932
I think he called
because he was depressed.

394
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,725
I take good care of him.

395
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,894
But I can't heal the scar in his heart.

396
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,607
Mr. Ko, are you eating well?

397
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,568
Spicy ramen, udon-style ramen,

398
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:22,946
Nagasaki.

399
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:24,948
He can't...

400
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,283
He can't make ramen on his own.

401
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,994
I saw him eating raw ramen.

402
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,581
He wants different kinds of ramen...

403
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,499
Have this.

404
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,460
If you're short on side dishes,
apply for more.

405
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,838
The welfare office provides
kimchi and side dishes.

406
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,090
You are doing good things.

407
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:46,886
Change of living environment
can lead to depression.

408
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,684
Taking him on a walk would help.

409
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,935
And getting some sun.

410
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,398
I'm going in.

411
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:02,402
Get some sunlight, asshole.
You don't want to be depressed.

412
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,195
You are the one who depresses me.

413
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,948
You are the one who angers me!

414
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,908
This place is no better than prison.

415
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,719
Hey.

416
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,975
Do you have any place you want to go?

417
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,311
You said the ossuary has been moved.

418
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,647
I want to go there.

419
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,528
You want me to take you there?

420
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,572
You and me?

421
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,199
Like good old brothers?

422
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,245
You have no conscience, like your mom.

423
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,748
Just say no.
No need to bad-mouth the dead.

424
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,083
Shut up, asshole!

425
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,607
Do you remember?

426
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,735
Jungsoo Sauna

427
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,528
Yangzte?

428
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,615
When Dad got paid,

429
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,328
Mom, Dad, you, and me...

430
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,540
We bathed and ate black bean noodles.

431
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,209
I don't remember.

432
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,545
We haven't been there since you left.

433
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,132
I kept asking.

434
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,802
But they were waiting for you.

435
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,012
Bullshit.

436
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,307
You think we were happy after you left?

437
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,269
"Maybe it's teenage rebellion."

438
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,732
"Maybe he'll come back
after he makes it big."

439
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,278
I thought up all kinds of reasons
trying to understand you.

440
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,739
But you never came back.

441
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,996
I buried our parents
by myself when I was 18.

442
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,709
I lost hope then.

443
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,295
It was over.

444
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,938
I won't tell your parole officer,
so just leave.

445
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,065
Live life the way you want it.

446
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,693
I'm used to being alone now.

447
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,210
Hey, get up.

448
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,713
Get up.

449
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,344
-Get the hell up.
-Why?

450
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,679
Get up!

451
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,140
-Sit up.
-Stop!

452
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,433
Just get up!

453
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,477
-What th--
-You son of a bitch!

454
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,312
Just get up!

455
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,521
Get up...

456
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,149
What the hell!

457
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,359
Let's go to a sauna.

458
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,696
Clean yourself up, asshole.

459
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,911
Scrub off ten years worth of dead skin.

460
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,040
I'm not doing this.

461
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,000
I want to go home.

462
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,086
What are you saying?

463
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,505
Let's get you scrubbed.

464
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,381
Take your clothes off.

465
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,896
Damn, you are all grown-up now.

466
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,439
What are you doing?

467
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,359
You asshole. Ow, that hurts...

468
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,402
You can see, right?

469
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,655
You're not completely blind.

470
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,867
Wow... asshole!

471
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,707
Look at all this dead skin.
It'll clog the sewer.

472
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,876
Keep it down, please.

473
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,629
Doesn't it feel good?

474
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,548
Do you see how skillful I am?

475
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,050
Is this all you did?

476
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,596
Before I went to prison,

477
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,891
I hid in the sauna for an entire year.

478
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,685
I scrubbed people for a year.

479
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,521
I wasn't happy after I left either.

480
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,316
I was a bus boy,Â did manual labor.

481
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,068
Even a barber assistant.

482
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,699
Then why did you run away?

483
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,371
You're too dumb to understand.

484
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,040
You liked Mom.

485
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,714
Your mom was good to me.

486
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,757
After your mom moved in,

487
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,927
my lunchbox was the best in class.

488
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,140
During the lunch hour,
your mom came in with hot udon.

489
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,892
No other mom ever did that.

490
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,853
I remember. I was there.

491
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,062
Then...

492
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,899
one day, the woman next door

493
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,612
told me to wake up.

494
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,822
To pull it together.

495
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,033
Why?

496
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:45,912
Why?

497
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,583
She said the woman I call Mom

498
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,336
was your mother's hospice caregiver.

499
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,296
She said if my momÂ saw this,

500
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,256
she'd turn in her grave.

501
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,342
So IÂ flipped out and left home.

502
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:06,432
I thought how those two desperately wished
my mom to die.

503
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:11,229
You shouldn't have asked.
I didn't want to tell you that.

504
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,030
Scrub thoroughly.

505
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,575
Your back is like an eraser.

506
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,078
Dead skin is coming out like crazy.

507
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,998
-Feels like I'm bleeding.
-No way.

508
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,585
My arms are tired.
Stop bitching at me.

509
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,547
Your shoulders...

510
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,426
are so wide now.
You were a tiny little thing.

511
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,346
You didn't even have pubes,

512
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,682
but now you are all hairy.

513
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,603
No. This is not it.

514
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,065
Let's go. I have enough clothes.

515
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,150
Probably all judo uniforms.

516
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,194
A man must have style.

517
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,158
Doo-young, what's wrong?

518
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,327
Why did you stand in the way?

519
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,288
Wait, hold on.

520
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,333
What are you doing?

521
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,961
What? Me?

522
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,421
Yes, you.

523
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,881
Don't you see? I'm shopping.

524
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,091
No kidding.

525
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,137
If you pushed him,
you should apologize.

526
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,558
Is he blind?

527
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,935
He should carry a stick or something.

528
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,729
Why be a nuisance?

529
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,732
Shouldn't you yield to someone
with disability?

530
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,150
It's common courtsey.

531
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,693
You are an asshole.

532
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,572
Son of a bitch.

533
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,283
-Look at this little...
-Little?

534
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,202
I'm older than your sugar baby.

535
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,663
What are you?

536
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,291
What's it to you?

537
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,043
I'm his brother. So what?

538
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,920
-Let's just go.
-Hold on.

539
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,716
What a fucking retard.

540
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:05,968
Wait.

541
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,013
Did you call him a retard?

542
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,350
If he can't see,
he should stand in the corner.

543
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,395
If you have fucking eyeballs,
don't bump into people.

544
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,732
Or do you use your eyes
to check out girls?

545
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,113
I told you to apologize to my brother.

546
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,159
Say you're sorry
before you go back to shopping.

547
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,581
Sir.

548
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,752
I barely touched...

549
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,379
Are you guys con men?

550
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,007
I didn't... You saw it, right?

551
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,300
He looks very hurt.

552
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,551
Let's just go.

553
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,887
He is sweating.

554
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,847
-What are you talking about?
-My stomach.

555
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:53,891
Are you OK?

556
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,980
I'm telling you the truth.

557
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,317
I barely touched him.

558
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,612
He is exaggerating. Really!

559
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,988
Please keep it down.

560
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,490
You should know better.

561
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,326
His brother has... disabil...

562
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,705
He is not well.

563
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,249
It's all my fault.

564
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,545
I just wanted to buy him some clothes
He didn't even want any.

565
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,720
I just wanted him...

566
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,393
to overcome the prejudice against him.

567
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,440
The wall of prejudice...

568
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,696
It's all my fault.

569
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,613
What was that?

570
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,824
Sorry.

571
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:53,993
Because of me...

572
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,037
Did you get hurt a lot?

573
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,623
I'm here.

574
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,376
Don't worry about me.

575
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,217
Don't cry.

576
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,617
I went easy on that bastard.

577
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,494
-Enough.
-Enough of what?

578
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,288
Did you study acting?

579
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,790
That was a great performance.

580
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,710
I take after the con man.

581
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,880
What did you call me?

582
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,924
What should I call you?

583
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,220
Are you Robin Hood?

584
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,222
Why can't you call me brother?

585
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,601
Brother, my ass.

586
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,145
Even the dogs will laugh.

587
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,650
You just said brother.

588
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,319
-When?
-Just now.

589
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,655
-I never said that.
-You turd.

590
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,617
Don't lie to me. That's my specialty.

591
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,246
-Let's just go home.
-Lead the way!

592
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,414
Lead the way, shithead.

593
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,625
You can't do anything without me.

594
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,543
Let go!

595
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,091
You scared the hell out of me.

596
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,468
Were you about to flip me?

597
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,262
Were you?

598
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,098
Hold onto my arm.

599
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,851
Jeez.

600
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,187
You can't even...

601
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,403
I should've taken an MRI.

602
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,905
-CT scan is too cheap.
-Enough.

603
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:56,824
Did you see her though?

604
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,619
How did an old fart get
someone like her? So jealous.

605
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,996
Did you see her?

606
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:03,622
So hot.

607
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,502
So I am saying...

608
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,301
Can you please leave us alone?

609
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,928
I have something to discuss
with Doo-young.

610
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:27,896
You two can go to his room.

611
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,814
It's OK.

612
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,025
Continue.

613
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,117
Doo-young.

614
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,203
Don't talk about it anymore.<i></i>
I won't do it.

615
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,331
Are you that ashamed?

616
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:49,335
Is a Paralympics medal meaningless to you?

617
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,004
I don't want to be seen as disabled.

618
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,507
I'm not disabled, so it won't mean much
coming from me.

619
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:56,925
But someone said

620
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,094
disability can't be overcome

621
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,096
but must be accepted.

622
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,890
How can I accept it?

623
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,603
The world went black and I became
a laughing stock overnight.

624
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,230
I know how uncomfortable this is.

625
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,483
I can help you ease the discomfort.

626
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,943
But if you are ashamed,

627
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,404
no one can help you.

628
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,114
Want to trade places with me?

629
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,663
I lost everything.

630
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,838
If you lost everything, too,

631
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,384
you wouldn't call it discomfort.

632
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,930
OK, Doo-young. But this is...

633
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,015
He said no.

634
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,103
He has to want it.

635
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,646
He could get hurt.

636
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,941
He could get ingured more.
Leave.

637
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,026
Don't come back. Leave now.

638
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:58,987
You have no right.

639
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,615
You don't even care
if he eats or not.

640
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,992
Malnutrition? Shame on you.

641
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,163
I want pork belly.

642
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,295
Shall we?

643
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,131
Join us,Â coach.

644
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,590
Excuse me?

645
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,094
-I... I am...
-Stay, or whatever.

646
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,140
Then...

647
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,893
Soju and beer cocktail, too?

648
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,354
Do it yourself.
I don't make it for girls.

649
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,362
I'm from Hanchun Church.

650
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,489
Have some Korean-made candies.

651
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,075
Do you have good pork belly?

652
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,201
Of course I do.

653
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,412
Make me some that tastes like beef!

654
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,580
OK!

655
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,877
I have to eat chicken for dinner today.

656
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,338
Hold on. You.

657
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,758
THE BIBLE

658
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:01,967
A pastor?

659
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,387
Will you accept Jesus Christ?

660
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,976
Seven to three, the golden ratio.

661
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,731
Shouldn't he eat some, too?

662
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,108
-I should.
-No, no.

663
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,319
Food is not everything. He is full.

664
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,739
Full of glory and grace of God,
he doesn't get hungry.

665
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,283
-Who is he?
-A neighbor.

666
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,785
Don't bother.

667
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,661
He was born to grill meat.

668
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,247
Brother?

669
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,958
No need to know.
Just grill the meat.

670
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,419
Are you married?

671
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,380
No need to know.
Just eat the meat.

672
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,467
I'm not married at all.

673
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,095
-Do you live around here?
-I'm in a good mood.

674
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,097
You are a good cook, so...

675
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,391
I'll wrap one for you.
What do you want in it?

676
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,185
Meat, no fat.

677
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,270
Just the meat.

678
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,481
-Garlic?
-Two slices.

679
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,609
Just eat what I give you.

680
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,361
-Onions?
-Just a little.

681
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:04,571
A lot.

682
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:10,577
-Drink the shot.
-After I eat this.

683
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,747
I'll eat this first.

684
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,251
Open your mouth.

685
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,227
You shouldn't leave empty-handed.

686
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,451
It's fortunate.

687
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,996
You two are getting closer.

688
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,836
Are you always so nosy?

689
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:05,299
Doo-young was a star.

690
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,303
But he didn't get a chance to shine.

691
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,639
Maybe that's why I'm so nosy.

692
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,650
I won't bother you anymore.

693
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,864
Doo-young smiles again because of you.

694
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:45,881
I'm doing the dishes?

695
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,467
You need to be independent.

696
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,518
You have to be good at this.

697
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,812
So you can get married and stuff.

698
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,773
What crazy woman would marry me?

699
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,734
You are too handsome to resist.

700
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,445
How many girls have you dated?

701
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,155
You can't date while training.

702
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,991
It takes everythingÂ to win a gold medal.

703
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,619
What a waste!

704
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,704
This is nonsense.

705
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,957
Go pick up a girl today.

706
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,417
-Is that a joke?
-Damn.

707
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,964
Picking up girls is the easiest thing
in the world.

708
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,423
It's the hardest for me.

709
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,759
Come here.

710
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,970
-Even more so now.
-Sit here.

711
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,472
This moron.

712
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,767
Where do I even begin about girls?

713
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,895
You poor virgin!

714
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,271
Turd.

715
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,607
Let me think.

716
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,151
Girls...

717
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,365
-They're like judo.
-Judo?

718
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,075
Judo.

719
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,664
Here's a Coke bottle. Touch it.

720
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:06,670
Feel it.

721
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,547
Hold it tight.

722
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,718
Hold it tighter!

723
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:13,927
There!

724
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,847
Push and pull. Push-pull.

725
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,183
You push and pull her.

726
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,104
You need push and...

727
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,733
Wait for the right time.

728
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,527
When the moment is right,

729
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,114
<i>Tachi-waza!</i> The game is on your side.

730
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:35,991
Then, what?

731
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,326
After<i> Tachi-waza...</i>
Use the same judo techniques.

732
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,454
What would you do?

733
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,123
Use your charm and skills.
Overwhelm her.

734
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,833
Make her lose her mind.

735
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,170
Completely lose it.

736
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,173
Is she slipping away? Get her.

737
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:54,384
Grab her and <i>Kamate!</i>
Last hold and you win.

738
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,136
Forget it.

739
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,556
This only works when I am attractive.

740
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,308
It won't be easy to charm them.

741
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,479
Can you move your eyes?

742
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:10,025
Look down to the left
for about ten seconds.

743
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,196
Like this?

744
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:18,033
Yes. Now cross your legs.
Look up to the right for three seconds.

745
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,623
That's side-eyeing, dumb ass.

746
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:25,957
I'm done.

747
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:29,002
That's it!

748
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,587
You just did it.

749
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:31,797
You did it.

750
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,049
Yes, that. That's it.

751
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,094
Rough, cool, like a wild horse.

752
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,180
Maintain that posture.
Say a sensitive phrase.

753
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,765
Sensitive phrase?

754
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,392
Humans have twoÂ sets of eyes.

755
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,019
Physical eyes

756
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,604
and emotional eyes.

757
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,689
Emotional eyes...

758
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,527
You may have noticed
that I've unfortunately lost...

759
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,529
physical eyes.

760
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,906
Isn't this too old-fashioned?

761
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,074
Listen to the end.

762
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,119
But God...

763
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,789
gave me another set of eyes.

764
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,292
Emotional eyes.

765
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,670
E... emotional eyes.

766
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,130
Yes, just like that.

767
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,632
You're ready.

768
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,833
Handsome!

769
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,710
Let's dress you up!

770
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,303
Emotional eyes.

771
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,068
No, go back.

772
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,591
My legs will cram up.

773
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,968
-Can I change my pose?
-No.

774
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,721
My back hurts.

775
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,764
Hold the pose.

776
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,183
Nothing comes easy.

777
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,102
I'll go find some hot chicks.

778
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,520
You stay like this.

779
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,064
-Hey!
-What?

780
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:55,857
I...

781
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,569
-like girls who look like movie stars..
-What the...

782
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,321
He wants aÂ goddess or what?

783
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,242
Humans have two...

784
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,370
Humans have twoÂ sets of eyes.

785
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,121
Physical eyes.

786
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,666
And emotional eyes.

787
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,293
Are you here alone?

788
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,921
Yes.

789
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,840
I mean I came with someone.

790
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,134
I see.

791
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,346
My friends made me come here.

792
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,933
This kind of scene is new to me.
so I feel little bit awkward.

793
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,603
Can we talk for a minute?

794
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:35,563
Yes.

795
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,278
Oh...

796
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,117
Humans have twoÂ sets of eyes.

797
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,202
Physical eyes,

798
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,204
and emotional eyes.

799
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,707
E... emotional eyes?

800
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,542
As you might have noticed,

801
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,879
I lost my physical eyes.

802
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,049
That has made me...

803
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,843
very rebellious.

804
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,222
Oh, I... I'm sorry.

805
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:10,890
But...

806
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,478
God...

807
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,400
gave me another set of eyes.

808
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:21,693
Emotional eyes.

809
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,031
How do I look

810
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,158
through your emotional eyes?

811
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,785
Well... like a movie star.

812
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,955
You must really see me.

813
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,333
People say I look at a famous actress.

814
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,296
Don't you think we are a good match?

815
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,381
-Yes.
-You are so handsome.

816
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,886
You are so hot!

817
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,764
Shall I kiss you or not?

818
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,016
I will kiss you!

819
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,731
What's this? Hold on!

820
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,358
Back off for a second.

821
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,110
-Oh my, what's this?
-Sorry. I know we just met.

822
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,820
-Holy cow!
-It was so good.

823
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,238
-No, it wasn't.
-Who are you?

824
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,531
He's my brother.

825
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,825
-I'm his brother.
-I'm not done.

826
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,078
-Just leave.
-Why?

827
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,496
-Go!
-No. Who are you?

828
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,414
-Who are you?
-I'm a woman. What?

829
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,874
No, you're not. Go.

830
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,334
-Oh my.
-Don't stick to me.

831
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,251
Thank you.

832
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,753
-For what?
-He thanked me!

833
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,254
-I don't like you.
-Jeez.

834
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,839
-Go!
-See you later.

835
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,966
See you never. Go!

836
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,593
You dumb ass!

837
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,012
I told you to wait.
So impatient!

838
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:31,930
Got any wipes?

839
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,349
-Why?
-Why? Look at you.

840
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,978
Your lips... you look like a clown.
She came here alone, right?

841
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,272
I was so scared. Her face is...

842
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,399
Let me see.

843
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,110
Her mouth was verywhere!

844
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,405
You should have let me
check her out first.

845
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,741
She said she looked like a famous actress.

846
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,618
She said that?

847
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,372
Wow, that bitch!

848
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,834
That's how the world is.

849
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,460
It's a scary place.

850
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,130
How dare she say that with her face?

851
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,381
So scary.

852
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,968
Her body was fine though.

853
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,763
You son of...

854
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,850
You felt her up that quick?

855
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,185
You surpass your master!

856
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,524
How did she look?

857
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,152
You won't sleep if you knew
Just think of a movie star.

858
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,113
I can only imagine.

859
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,490
Listen up.

860
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,578
Let's say you are wasted.

861
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,581
You don't know
if you are on the street or in a room.

862
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,833
A street light looks like a ladder.

863
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,878
You can't tell if it's upright
or flat on the ground.

864
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,254
Do you know what I mean?

865
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,922
-So?
-So,

866
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:52,051
her face would make you sober up
right away.

867
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,563
So, Mr. Ko.

868
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,400
Wait until I give you a green light
next time.

869
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,780
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

870
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,698
<i>Excuse me.</i>

871
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,118
Someone asked me to come
for my test results.

872
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,078
But I haven't done any tests.

873
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,622
So how can I have the results?

874
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,499
What is your name?

875
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:23,791
Ko Doo-sik.

876
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,587
You came to the ER before.

877
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,924
Your CT and blood test results came back.

878
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,259
Oh that! I see.

879
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:34,928
Should I wait?

880
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,264
-Please hurry.
-OK.

881
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,437
Excuse me.

882
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,106
Hello?

883
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,194
Mr. Ko?

884
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:53,738
Just a second.

885
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:00,245
I know this is a lot to take in.

886
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,789
-Most people...
-Just a second, damn it.

887
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,271
<i>Your call cannot be connected...</i>

888
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,589
You are speaking nonsense.

889
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,840
Can't you do math?

890
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,592
Sir.

891
00:59:56,384 --> 01:00:00,013
There's nothing we can do
about Dr. Kim's schedule.

892
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,932
That quack said
I will die in three months.

893
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,810
But I have to wait longer
to see the doctor?

894
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:09,564
What's that shit?
Can't you even do simple math?

895
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,190
The hospital system--

896
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:13,109
I got that!

897
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,945
I got that fucking system

898
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,864
is making me wait for months!

899
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,866
So answer me.
Will you be responsible

900
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,744
If I die before seeing a doctor...
What are you looking at?

901
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,454
Damn it...

902
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,665
-Sir, sorry.
-Let go.

903
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,585
Stop bullshiting me and give me an option.

904
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,128
-Calm down.
-What do I do?

905
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,505
I'm in the final stage
of pancreatic cancer.

906
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,424
And I just wait and die?

907
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,259
Then-- Let go of me, damn it!

908
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,387
What should I do? Give me an option.

909
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,722
Answer me.

910
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,059
How is this fucking hospital
worse than a clinic?

911
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,518
Do I look poor?

912
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,228
Let go. I got money.

913
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,647
-Please stop.
-I got money.

914
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,484
I will pay, so let me see the doctor.

915
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,320
What are you looking at?

916
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,676
I don't have wait to die.

917
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,760
Let's end it now.

918
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:28,309
DOO-YOUNG, ASSHOLE

919
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,446
Why is he not answering?

920
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,578
God damn it!

921
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,643
Damn it.

922
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,280
JUNGSOO SAUNA

923
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,035
What's that sound?

924
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,584
Why are you using the stove?
You might get hurt, dumb--

925
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,710
Let me see.

926
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,296
You got a burn.

927
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,714
Where is the ointment?

928
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:29,889
Damn it.

929
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,726
Do you have a tapeworm or something?

930
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,895
Tell me if you're hungry.

931
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,939
I wanted to make it for you.

932
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,694
This is so fucked!

933
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,114
Mom used to make an extra egg.

934
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,242
Because you liked it.

935
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,953
She was full of it.

936
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,712
The persimmon tree in the yard grew up
on your fried eggs.

937
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:06,217
She waited all day, and when the egg
got cold, she buried it under the tree.

938
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,594
"Grow well and bear good fruit

939
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,263
for my Doo-sik,"

940
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:11,889
she used to say.

941
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,517
Stop it.

942
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:19,105
Don't try to move me.
I don't believe it.

943
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,234
Hold on.
I'll go buy some ointment.

944
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,995
Damn it.

945
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,549
-Can you walk?
-What?

946
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:49,802
Change your clothes.

947
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:52,889
We going somewhere?

948
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,725
You wanted to see your mom.

949
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:14,577
Mom,

950
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:17,371
Dad!

951
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,041
We're here together.

952
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,836
No need to worry now.

953
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,512
Stop.

954
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,812
I need to use the restroom,
so stay here.

955
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,439
Wait...

956
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:46,400
Come back soon.

957
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:06,420
Your son became blind.

958
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,217
And your troublemaker,

959
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,053
I...

960
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:18,891
will die soon.

961
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,019
I don't know who's right.

962
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:25,648
But I will hear what you say
when I see you soon.

963
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:26,732
That dumb ass...

964
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:33,864
Doo-young...

965
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,872
What will you do with him?

966
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:45,001
{\an8}Stop smiling like that and answer me.

967
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,469
Drink all you want.

968
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,019
Here.

969
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:09,984
Isn't it good?

970
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,236
It is.

971
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,529
Eat.

972
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:19,410
I heard you were a judo star.

973
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,496
Expected to win a gold medal.

974
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,291
Why are you wasting such good skills?

975
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,417
You should use it.

976
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,463
So... you were a star...

977
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,214
What is it?

978
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,219
Paralympics? You will win it so easily.

979
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:38,763
What do you want to say?

980
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:40,931
Let's do it again, judo.

981
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,809
-So you're trying to convince me?
-Yes.

982
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,686
-I don't want to.
-Why?

983
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,316
You don't want to be called a retard?

984
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,902
I can't even go to a store...

985
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,698
I can't even buy
a package of ramen by myself.

986
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,285
How can I join the National Team?

987
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,329
There's help.

988
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:06,749
People will help.

989
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,751
That coach and other people.

990
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:10,377
They'll help.

991
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,880
You won't be by yourself.

992
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,471
Let's go outside.

993
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:31,440
Are you crazy?

994
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,609
How can I run?

995
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:37,029
You know this place!
We played here all the time as kids.

996
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,406
It's not the same.

997
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:40,407
It is.

998
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,660
Nothing has changed.

999
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:45,496
I was there for you then
and I'm here for you now.

1000
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,082
No!

1001
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,335
-Let's go home.
-Damn it!

1002
01:08:55,798 --> 01:09:01,220
You want to be stuck in the house forever?
If not sports, what else will you do?

1003
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,472
I can just die.

1004
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:10,354
God damn it!

1005
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,733
Die?

1006
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,487
Is it that easy to die?

1007
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,448
If I were about to die,
I would run all I want.

1008
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:24,201
You can do anything
if you were about to die.

1009
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:25,828
I'm scared.

1010
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,797
I will keep an eye on you, OK?

1011
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:43,387
Let's run.

1012
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,431
Doo-young.

1013
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,187
Run, Doo-young!

1014
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,107
Trust me and run,

1015
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,025
son of bitch.

1016
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:58,402
Run!

1017
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,031
There you go!

1018
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,536
You can do this.

1019
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,289
There.

1020
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:12,958
You're doing it.

1021
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:33,395
Are you alright?

1022
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:36,774
Good job!

1023
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,818
Freaking good!

1024
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:43,572
Will you help me?

1025
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,116
I will help you, bro.

1026
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,577
If someone makes fun of me,

1027
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,622
will you beat him up?

1028
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:55,501
I'll choke the fucker to death.

1029
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,590
What brought you here?

1030
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,053
Are you wearing makeup?

1031
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,138
A little...

1032
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,225
You should just put on some cream.
Your makeup is a mess.

1033
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:29,910
Get him on the National Team.

1034
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,833
-National Team? Does he want it?
<i>-</i>I barely convinced him.

1035
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,960
So make him do it
before he changes his mind.

1036
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:39,712
Why all of sudden?

1037
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:41,547
So many questions.

1038
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,215
Still nosy!

1039
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:47,845
By the way...

1040
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,513
So, if he...

1041
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,600
wins a gold medal,
does he get a full pension?

1042
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:55,644
They pay the same
for Paralympics athletes?

1043
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:58,647
It's all the same.
Same pension and benefits.

1044
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,984
Why? Are you trying
to take advantage of him?

1045
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,413
I have a condition.

1046
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:16,623
You must train Doo-young.

1047
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,210
You might not understand.

1048
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,546
I am a coach for the regular team.

1049
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,673
Paraolympics athlets
have their own coaches.

1050
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,009
You're making me a liar.

1051
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:30,554
-What're you saying?
-I told him you will help.

1052
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,057
You can be his manager.

1053
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,809
You just need to take him
to his practice and matches.

1054
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,735
Here's the story.

1055
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,947
When Doo-young was born, I adored him.

1056
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:51,492
But as he grew up, I began to hate him.

1057
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:53,077
He didn't do anything wrong.

1058
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:55,287
He must feel frustrated, too.

1059
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,540
I'm finally feeling close to him again...

1060
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,253
but I have cancer.

1061
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:04,588
I'm dying soon.

1062
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:12,221
He will be all alone.
So help me. I am begging you.

1063
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,307
Without your help,

1064
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,102
he can't get on the team.

1065
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:19,645
Only you can help.

1066
01:13:26,443 --> 01:13:29,071
I only put 300 km. on the car.
Please give me a good price.

1067
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:32,241
Why are you selling so soon?

1068
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:34,118
Just because.

1069
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,872
-What? Where are you going?
-The Paralympics National Team.

1070
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,583
Why?

1071
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:43,919
Soo-hyun!

1072
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:45,712
Are you drunk?

1073
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,673
I want to take Doo-young with me.

1074
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,176
Will he play again?

1075
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:53,762
-Yes.
-Then, just send him.

1076
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,889
I'll tell them to take good care of him.

1077
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,267
He won't send him without me.

1078
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,144
Who's he?

1079
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:03,522
He has a brother. I'll come back
once Doo-young gets used to it.

1080
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:04,773
Come back?

1081
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,317
What if someone else takes your position?

1082
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:11,864
Then I'll just have to stay
with the Paralympics National Team.

1083
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:14,241
Oh, my God, you!

1084
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:15,868
You worked so hard to get here.

1085
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,120
Is this the right decision?

1086
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,747
If I send Doo-young alone,

1087
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,293
I won't be ble to live with it.

1088
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,420
I feel frustrated too!

1089
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:30,090
Why are you doing this?
He's not your brother!

1090
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,175
I need to show him.

1091
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,929
He might have lost everything,

1092
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,224
and he can't see,

1093
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,435
I want to show him
he can still smile.

1094
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:45,606
I don't want to waste my career either,
but...

1095
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,613
To hold his hand,

1096
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:56,700
I need to drop what I have.

1097
01:14:58,243 --> 01:14:59,745
I need to empty my hands.

1098
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,167
Help me.

1099
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,715
Won-suk, do it right.

1100
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,966
Do it properly!

1101
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,803
Do you want to taste death?

1102
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,936
Your eyes have arrived.

1103
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:30,108
What's this?

1104
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,485
Your eyes.

1105
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,737
Here is the handle.

1106
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:34,738
No.

1107
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:37,658
Instead of standing in one place
because you can't see,

1108
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,284
have some style!

1109
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,328
And walk forward.

1110
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:44,540
This is how you unfold this.
Hold the handle.

1111
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:45,707
And then!

1112
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,753
That was not easy.

1113
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:17,864
Do I look stylish?

1114
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:20,951
Gosh.

1115
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:25,122
You're the most stylish
blind guy in the world.

1116
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,710
So lame.

1117
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,188
Grip hold! Begin!

1118
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,708
<i>Yuko </i>for white!

1119
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:11,293
Stop!

1120
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,086
<i>Yuko?</i>

1121
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:26,850
Doo-young! Are you scared of hurting
your opponent?

1122
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,023
Grip hold!

1123
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:36,985
Begin!

1124
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:46,453
One point!

1125
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:48,246
One point for blue!

1126
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:50,248
Match over.

1127
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:56,755
Did your car break down?

1128
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:01,051
My car? I sold it.

1129
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:03,387
Why?

1130
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:06,890
Is it hard to take the bus
and the subway?

1131
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,600
No, that's not it.

1132
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:12,479
Athletes must have spirit of steel!

1133
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:15,649
In the old days, they won gold on ramen.

1134
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:17,609
-When was it? Nineteen--
-I'm off.

1135
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:21,238
-How dare you cut me off!
-Thank you.

1136
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:23,031
Keep it up!

1137
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:38,463
I'm glad you can't see.

1138
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:44,845
If you could see my face,
my beauty would be a distraction.

1139
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:50,225
In any case,

1140
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,436
you belong to the Korean National Team.

1141
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,480
So do your best.

1142
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:58,603
4,500 won.

1143
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,535
Why?

1144
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,831
Are you delivering noodles now,
Mr. Missionary?

1145
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:20,417
Don't just order one dish
during peak hours.

1146
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:23,378
Isn't that an unspoken rule?

1147
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,255
So funny.

1148
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:26,298
Hey.

1149
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,718
Oh my.

1150
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:37,893
Church is a corporation, too.

1151
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,647
They don't hire people
without a college degree.

1152
01:21:44,774 --> 01:21:48,153
A megachurch pays more than Samsung.

1153
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,573
-Is that why you went to theology school?
-That was the requirement,

1154
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:52,991
so I did it.

1155
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:56,953
So you became a pastor.

1156
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:00,665
How can I die leaving you like this?

1157
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:03,418
I took a leave of absence.

1158
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,047
Die well when the time comes.

1159
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:10,675
YANGTZE

1160
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:16,348
Hello!

1161
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:19,100
What is taking you so long, bastard?

1162
01:22:19,517 --> 01:22:20,352
Excuse me?

1163
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,187
Quit if you are going to do this.

1164
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:25,023
Yes.

1165
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,276
Aren't you taking off?

1166
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:29,444
Go now.

1167
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,780
You came here to deliver
and you ate the food.

1168
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:36,368
-Got any beer?
-Why?

1169
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,079
I just got fired.

1170
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:44,793
For real?

1171
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,336
Doo-young?

1172
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:52,342
He is very talented.

1173
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:54,302
National Team?

1174
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:59,099
Dig deeper. A storm will knock it down.

1175
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:02,227
You're paying me for this, right?

1176
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,814
If you don't, I'll report you.

1177
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:08,066
Don't laugh.

1178
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,153
Bury some fried eggs later.

1179
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,490
There are so many kinds
of good fertilizers out there.

1180
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:16,616
Why fried eggs?

1181
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:19,494
I don't even have one for myself.

1182
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:21,955
Hey, come here.

1183
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,416
I think I'm done.

1184
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,502
What's wrong?

1185
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:30,296
Hey!

1186
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,007
What's going on?

1187
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:39,597
119?

1188
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,766
I need an ambulance now.

1189
01:23:42,642 --> 01:23:44,644
-What?
-Dumb ass.

1190
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:46,688
Yes?

1191
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,690
911, dumb...

1192
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:49,899
Oh, 911!

1193
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:52,610
Don't call.

1194
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:54,487
They can't do anything.

1195
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:16,259
It's been months!

1196
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,136
I know.

1197
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,931
Let's get rewarded in Brazil
for all your effort.

1198
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:23,516
Yes, coach.

1199
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:52,420
It doesn't feel like our house.

1200
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:55,882
What did you do?

1201
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,639
I feel it already.

1202
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:04,808
Latin girls are hot.

1203
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,519
Brazil is awesome.

1204
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:10,688
After the match,
let's pick up some Brazilian girls.

1205
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,649
You turd.

1206
01:25:12,732 --> 01:25:14,609
I am globally popular.

1207
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:16,611
When I show up,

1208
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:18,780
they'll want to change their nationality.

1209
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:20,740
But I don't speak English.

1210
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:23,159
That's why you're an amateur.

1211
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:24,953
You don't pick up girls with words.

1212
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:28,456
You do it with your eyes and emotion.

1213
01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:30,583
Emotion.

1214
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:34,087
I want to win a gold medal.

1215
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:35,505
Will I?

1216
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:39,384
Of course. It's yours.

1217
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,137
Who else is out there?

1218
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:46,724
We packed almost everything.

1219
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,018
Right, I forgot to say this.

1220
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:51,521
I...

1221
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:54,190
-got a job.
-Job?

1222
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:56,818
I'm wokring right now, you know.

1223
01:25:56,901 --> 01:26:01,906
Someone I know asked me help
build something in Pusan.

1224
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:06,452
-When?
-As soon as possible.

1225
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:09,247
He wants me there now.

1226
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:13,293
Should I just go to Brazil?

1227
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:16,880
It's hard for aÂ high-school drop out
to get a job.

1228
01:26:17,213 --> 01:26:20,758
You son of a...
Do you really have to point that out?

1229
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:24,345
If you do it well this time,
you'll get a permanant job?

1230
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:26,389
I will.

1231
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:30,226
You need a job to get married.

1232
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:32,937
Mind your own business.

1233
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:35,982
Stop worrying about my damn business.

1234
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,610
I'll go to Brazil alone this time.

1235
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:40,236
I have my coach.

1236
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:44,532
Will you be OK?

1237
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:46,910
I'm pretty good with the stick now.

1238
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:51,206
I'll win the match anyway.

1239
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:53,750
You arrogant ass.

1240
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:56,794
If you don't win, just stay there.

1241
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,504
Don't come back from Brazil.

1242
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:01,341
-Dancing samba?
-Dance like crazy!

1243
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:07,013
-What do you think?
-Good.

1244
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:08,765
-Will this work?
-You're good!

1245
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:11,768
You move like that, then the girls...

1246
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:16,022
Don't wander off.

1247
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:18,441
Listen to the coach
who thinks she is pretty.

1248
01:27:18,524 --> 01:27:19,525
It's not me.

1249
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:21,152
People say I'm pretty.

1250
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:23,071
Just go with it.

1251
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:25,156
We are saying goodbye to each other.

1252
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:26,658
Go do a good job.

1253
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,660
I will visit you in Pusan.

1254
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:32,497
OK.

1255
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:35,333
Let's get some sashimi, later.

1256
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,960
Eat well.

1257
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:39,254
-Easy on your stomach--
-Let's get going.

1258
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:40,338
The plane is leaving.

1259
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:42,382
Your brother might cry.

1260
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:43,633
Let's go.

1261
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,468
Watch out.

1262
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:48,930
Bye.

1263
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,224
Bye!

1264
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:10,034
<i>Ko Doo-young from Korea</i>

1265
01:28:10,326 --> 01:28:12,036
<i>moves up to Quarter Finals!</i>

1266
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:17,000
Good job. That was a clean move.

1267
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:18,793
Did I look sexy?

1268
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:22,297
Your brother was a bad influence.

1269
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,341
I want to talk to him.

1270
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:28,594
Sure, let's brag.

1271
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:33,433
Did you see me going to Quarter Finals?

1272
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:35,810
I... I did.

1273
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:38,396
You look damn good on TV.

1274
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:45,987
Are you in Pusan?

1275
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:47,655
Do you hear it?

1276
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:50,867
Seagulls.

1277
01:28:54,245 --> 01:28:57,123
Yes, do you hear samba music?

1278
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,292
<i>It is crazy here.</i>

1279
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,002
<i>People are dancing.</i>

1280
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:02,920
<i>The girls are so hot here.</i>

1281
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,340
<i>-This is no joke!</i>
-Liar!

1282
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,552
All I hear is your breath.

1283
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:12,430
<i>Isn't it bed time?</i>

1284
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:14,891
-Don't you need to sleep?
<i>-I'm OK.</i>

1285
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:16,809
Do you need to go to work?

1286
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:18,811
Is the food good?

1287
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:20,146
Yes.

1288
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:23,316
<i>It's good, but home food is the best.</i>

1289
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:25,068
<i>-Spicy ramen, Nagasaki--</i>
-One second.

1290
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,122
<i>Are you doing a good job?</i>

1291
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:40,541
<i>Don't be lazy.</i>

1292
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:42,877
<i>Work hard and get married.</i>

1293
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:44,670
<i>You need to get married.</i>

1294
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:47,757
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

1295
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:48,758
Cultist!

1296
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:50,676
Why?

1297
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:52,887
Why are you looking at me so scary?

1298
01:29:55,598 --> 01:29:58,643
How much do you get paid for delivery?

1299
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:03,606
-Why do you ask?
<i>-</i>I'll pay you more for taking care of me.

1300
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:08,319
Why would I take care of you?
I'm not crazy. I'm busy.

1301
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:10,822
You cultist, you are not busy.

1302
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:13,699
I don't want to hear that.
I will do it right this time.

1303
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:15,535
I will go back to school.

1304
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:17,203
To become a missionary?

1305
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:18,329
None of your business.

1306
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:19,705
Do it.

1307
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:20,748
I will.

1308
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,834
I won't stop you.

1309
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,254
But before then,

1310
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,423
clean up my piss and shit.

1311
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:33,052
Say goodbye to me first
and do those things.

1312
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,847
That's disgusting.

1313
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:38,933
OK, you agreed.

1314
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:45,481
Doo-young's finals are at dawn,
so set the alarm.

1315
01:30:46,065 --> 01:30:47,066
And lower the bed.

1316
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:53,614
-I said lower.
-I got it.

1317
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:56,701
I'm not good with machines.

1318
01:31:15,052 --> 01:31:15,887
Doo-young.

1319
01:31:17,263 --> 01:31:19,182
What's the matter? You don't feel well?

1320
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:21,851
I keep thinking about it.

1321
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:23,603
The match...

1322
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:25,771
when I got hurt.

1323
01:31:32,361 --> 01:31:35,072
You've done well.
Don't feel overwhelmed.

1324
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,157
Coach.

1325
01:31:38,951 --> 01:31:42,246
I want to win a gold medal.

1326
01:31:44,957 --> 01:31:45,875
But I'm scared.

1327
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:48,169
I can't breathe.

1328
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:52,381
Can I drop out?

1329
01:31:52,548 --> 01:31:56,385
Doo-young! You can, if you want.
Don't push yourself too hard.

1330
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:59,347
You're still young.
You manage the match well.

1331
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:01,849
You can win next time.

1332
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:04,977
But then...

1333
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:12,777
your brother...

1334
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:15,780
might not be with you.

1335
01:32:20,576 --> 01:32:22,620
-Doo-young.
-I want to go.

1336
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,290
-I'm going.
-Doo-young.

1337
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:27,708
I want to go.

1338
01:32:28,584 --> 01:32:29,585
Get it together!

1339
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:32,463
This is why he couldn't tell you.

1340
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:39,053
Is that really the right thing to do,
to run to your brother?

1341
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:41,597
Then, go ahead.

1342
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:43,641
Let's go home together.

1343
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:05,121
How much time do I have

1344
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:07,123
until the finals?

1345
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,001
About five minutes.

1346
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:16,549
I want to be alone for a while.

1347
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:46,245
Hey brother!

1348
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:48,789
It's me.

1349
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:52,001
Girls are so hot here.

1350
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:54,962
I should've gone there.

1351
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:01,802
Don't worry.

1352
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,681
I got the phone numbers
of two samba ladies.

1353
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:09,435
Did you pick the right one this time?
You have a history.

1354
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,896
He's making me nervous.

1355
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:12,938
Are you kidding?

1356
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:15,483
These girls are hot this time.

1357
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,403
<i>Are you sure?</i>
<i>I should've gone there.</i>

1358
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:22,990
Finals...

1359
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,910
I know, you son of a bitch!

1360
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:28,329
Remember.

1361
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:30,247
If you don't win a gold medal,

1362
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,166
don't come back.

1363
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:33,876
Stay in Brazil.

1364
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:36,087
If you come back,

1365
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:39,090
I will stop you at the airport.

1366
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:41,634
It's not bad here.

1367
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,220
But...

1368
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:50,434
I want to win a gold medal and go home.

1369
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:57,441
I will win no matter what.

1370
01:34:58,609 --> 01:34:59,443
<i>Wait for me.</i>

1371
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:01,362
<i>OK?</i>

1372
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,074
You must wait.

1373
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:09,161
Doo-young.

1374
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:10,746
Yes?

1375
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:13,624
I miss you.

1376
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:18,045
<i>I miss you, so come home soon.</i>

1377
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:23,509
Are you in pain?

1378
01:35:26,762 --> 01:35:27,596
<i>Are you?</i>

1379
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,600
<i>Does it hurt a lot?</i>

1380
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:51,245
Hurry home.

1381
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:00,296
I am in so much pain, you son of a bitch.

1382
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:04,800
It hurts more when you're not here.

1383
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:08,304
Hurry home.

1384
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:11,223
Hang in there.

1385
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,435
I will go back soon.

1386
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:18,499
You can do this, Doo-young.

1387
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,923
2016 Rio Paralympics.

1388
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:29,552
<i>The final round for 60kg and under</i> <i>is</i>
<i>about to start.</i>

1389
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:31,637
<i>-Ko Doo-young from Korea...</i>
-He is coming in.

1390
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:34,473
<i>and Pana from Turkey will match.</i>

1391
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:41,021
These two athletes must have made
more effortsÂ than regular players.

1392
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:43,524
They must be thinking of

1393
01:37:43,899 --> 01:37:45,317
those moments of training.

1394
01:37:45,442 --> 01:37:48,070
I see tension on Ko Doo-young.

1395
01:37:48,737 --> 01:37:49,905
Grip hold!

1396
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:00,666
Begin!

1397
01:38:00,749 --> 01:38:02,334
The match begins as we speak.

1398
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:04,837
From the beginning,

1399
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,380
the grip battle is fierce.

1400
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:08,007
They are sizing up each other.

1401
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:09,133
<i>It didn't lock.</i>

1402
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:10,634
<i>Ko avoided well.</i>

1403
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,094
<i>Pana tries again.</i>

1404
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:15,973
Stop!

1405
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:18,309
That was close.

1406
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:21,770
<i>The shoulder throw worked on Ko,</i>
<i>but it was out of bounds.</i>

1407
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:24,189
<i>He is allowing Pana to attack...</i>

1408
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:26,025
Lower your stance.

1409
01:38:26,525 --> 01:38:27,776
Hold his left arm!

1410
01:38:32,823 --> 01:38:33,741
Grip hold!

1411
01:38:38,454 --> 01:38:39,872
Both are back at the center.

1412
01:38:40,205 --> 01:38:41,248
Begin!

1413
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:43,918
Pana's sudden attack!

1414
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:47,630
<i>Waza-ari for the opponent.</i>

1415
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:50,382
<i>Waza-ari </i>for blue.

1416
01:38:56,847 --> 01:38:58,557
Doo-young, get it together.

1417
01:38:58,807 --> 01:39:00,267
You have plenty of time.

1418
01:39:04,396 --> 01:39:06,523
He lost<i>Â Waza-ari,</i> but...

1419
01:39:08,817 --> 01:39:10,152
Give me a cigarette.

1420
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:13,656
-I don't have any.

1421
01:39:13,864 --> 01:39:14,698
You do.

1422
01:39:15,157 --> 01:39:16,075
I quit.

1423
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:18,369
For real.

1424
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:21,413
Why did you quit so fast?

1425
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:24,416
Watch the match.

1426
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:28,796
Facing Pana,

1427
01:39:28,879 --> 01:39:30,965
Ko shouldn't lose his confidence.

1428
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:33,842
He's done very well...

1429
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:40,766
I hope he plays the match calmly.

1430
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:44,311
Both players have moved to the center,

1431
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:46,188
gripping each other's uniform.

1432
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:48,023
Our player, Ko Doo-young!

1433
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:51,402
Hold it tight, son of a bitch.

1434
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:55,322
Doo-young,

1435
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:56,991
Are you scared ofÂ hurting

1436
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,033
your opponent?

1437
01:39:58,784 --> 01:39:59,743
Are youÂ Robin Hood?

1438
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:01,745
Why can't you call me brother?

1439
01:40:02,037 --> 01:40:04,623
I wasn't happy after IÂ left either.

1440
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:09,169
You have to button from the top.

1441
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:10,838
Are you sick?

1442
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:12,381
Sick?

1443
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,174
No.

1444
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:15,968
Doo-young.

1445
01:40:16,635 --> 01:40:17,469
Run.

1446
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:22,725
Trust me and run.

1447
01:40:25,227 --> 01:40:26,395
Do you have a brother?

1448
01:40:29,356 --> 01:40:30,607
I have one.

1449
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:33,736
Begin!

1450
01:40:38,323 --> 01:40:39,575
Circle throw!

1451
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:43,454
<i>Half a point for Ko!</i>

1452
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:53,547
Hold him down!

1453
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,258
Pana is trying to escape,

1454
01:40:56,341 --> 01:40:58,135
but Ko won't let him.

1455
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:01,889
Ko must lower his stance.

1456
01:41:32,795 --> 01:41:34,171
Half point.

1457
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:39,551
That makes one full point.

1458
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,764
<i>Our first gold medal!</i>

1459
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:47,810
