00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,709
<i>Hi. Ed Renfrew for Delos again.
If there's anyone who doesn't know...</i>

2
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,149
<i>...what Delos is,
well, as we've always said:</i>

3
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,069
<i>Delos is the vacation of the future,
today.</i>

4
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,909
<i>At Delos, you get your choice
of the vacation you want.</i>

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,508
<i>There's Medieval World, Roman World
and, of course, Westworld.</i>

6
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,669
<i>Let's talk to some people
who've been there.</i>

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,908
<i>- Pardon me. What is your name?
- Gardner Lewis.</i>

8
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:43,668
<i>- Just got back from Westworld.
- Tell us how you liked it.</i>

9
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,108
<i>When you played cowboys and Indians
as a kid, you'd point, go "bang"...</i>

10
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,069
<i>...and the other kid
would pretend dead.</i>

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,148
<i>Well, Westworld is the same thing,
only it's for real.</i>

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,348
<i>I shot six people.
Well, uh, they weren't real people.</i>

13
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,029
<i>What Mr. Lewis means is
he shot six robots...</i>

14
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,149
<i>...scientifically programmed to look, act,
talk and even bleed just like humans do.</i>

15
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,708
<i>- Isn't that right?
- Well, they may have been robots.</i>

16
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,309
<i>I mean, uh, I think they were robots.
I mean, I know they were robots.</i>

17
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,948
<i>Yes, the robots of Westworld
are there to serve you...</i>

18
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:17,629
<i>...and to give you the most unique
vacation experience of your life.</i>

19
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:19,348
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

20
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,069
<i>And you, madam?</i>

21
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,428
<i>- Hello.
- What is your name?</i>

22
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:26,588
<i>My name is Janet Lane,
and I was in Roman World.</i>

23
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:30,268
<i>What is the one thing that stands out
in your mind about Roman World?</i>

24
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:32,908
<i>Oh, well, I think it would be...</i>

25
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:34,708
<i>...the men.</i>

26
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:40,188
<i>I just feel marvelous. I mean,
it's just a warm, glowing place to be.</i>

27
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,828
<i>- Thank you very much.
- Oh, thank you very much.</i>

28
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:47,789
<i>- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.</i>

29
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,148
<i>- And you, sir?
- Yeah?</i>

30
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:51,428
<i>What is your name, sir?</i>

31
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,629
<i>Oh, I'm Ted Mann.
I'm a stockbroker from St. Louis.</i>

32
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,868
<i>And which world
did you just come from, sir?</i>

33
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,749
<i>Oh, you're not gonna believe this.</i>

34
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,828
<i>I've just been the sheriff of Westworld
for the last two weeks.</i>

35
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,469
<i>- Did it seem real to you?
- It's the realest thing I ever done.</i>

36
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,628
<i>- I mean that.
- Thank you very much.</i>

37
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,469
<i>Yeah.</i>

38
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,509
<i>- And you, sir?
- My name's Arthur Caine.</i>

39
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,869
<i>I've been in the castle.</i>

40
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,628
<i>I've had a couple of sword fights
and three jousts.</i>

41
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:18,629
<i>And I...</i>

42
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,829
<i>I married a beautiful princess.</i>

43
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,668
<i>Is that something
you always dreamed of doing, sir?</i>

44
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,668
<i>All my life. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

45
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:30,388
<i>There were some comments of
the people who just returned from Delos.</i>

46
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:34,029
<i>Why don't you make arrangements to
take our hovercraft to Medieval World...</i>

47
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:38,109
<i>...Roman World and Westworld?
Was it worth $1000 a day?</i>

48
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,909
<i>Yes.</i>

49
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,909
<i>Contact us today,
or see your travel agent.</i>

50
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,868
<i>Boy, have we got a vacation for you.</i>

51
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,069
<i>505-345-675, Delta 9.</i>

52
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,629
<i>505-345-675, Delta 9.</i>

53
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,069
<i>Read you as
Kappa 505-899 on a y-axis...</i>

54
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:04,908
<i>...confirm a reading of Gamma 505-786.
See if you have all that.</i>

55
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,589
<i>Kappa 505-899...</i>

56
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,268
<i>This is Delos Control to Station 3.</i>

57
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:19,669
<i>You're cleared on vector 79, on a 195.</i>

58
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,109
<i>We anticipate a scan
in about four and a half minutes.</i>

59
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,388
I'm not worried at all. I'm just c...
Thanks.

60
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,549
I'm just curious.

61
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,708
How much do they weigh?

62
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,348
- Three or 4 pounds.
- That heavy?

63
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,028
Do they have much of a kick?

64
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:56,228
A Colt .45?

65
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:59,268
Well, I never fired one before.

66
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,188
Hey.

67
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:06,748
What about that thing
where you go like this over the gun?

68
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,428
- Fanning.
- Yeah.

69
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:09,589
What about it?

70
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,028
- Is that hard to do?
- No.

71
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,468
Now, when they give you
the gun belt...

72
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:20,108
...does it have those strings
to tie around your leg?

73
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,749
- If that's the kind you want.
- That's the kind I want.

74
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,588
I think it's probably better
for quick draws, you know?

75
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,349
It all depends.

76
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:32,629
What kind of gun belt did you have
the last time?

77
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:36,349
I had the one without the strings.

78
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,228
- And you could draw fast?
- Mm-hm.

79
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:44,268
Hmm. Then maybe
it doesn't matter after all.

80
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:51,108
- The guns they give you are real guns?
- Mm-hm.

81
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,388
- Real guns.
- Ha.

82
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:54,548
That's incredible.

83
00:04:55,069 --> 00:05:00,629
<i>Give us a shift to 197
and take it down to 443.</i>

84
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:03,948
We have negative acceleration of 22...

85
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:07,268
...so long as you maintain
passenger comfort.

86
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:10,588
<i>Sequencing was transferred
according to the log at 041.</i>

87
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:15,748
<i>The
orientation on the resort will now begin.</i>

88
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:18,628
<i>Please put on your earphones.</i>

89
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:21,668
Don't you wanna listen?

90
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,628
I heard it the last time.

91
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,028
<i>...consists of three separate resort
areas, each with its own special appeal.</i>

92
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,748
<i>Whichever resort you've chosen...</i>

93
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,389
<i>...we are sure you will have
a fascinating and rewarding stay here.</i>

94
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:39,908
<i>Here it is possible to relive
the excitement...</i>

95
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:42,228
<i>...and stresses of pioneer life
to the fullest.</i>

96
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,468
<i>Western World
is a life of lawless violence...</i>

97
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:47,389
<i>...a society of guns and action.</i>

98
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:51,988
<i>This is Medieval World, where we have
reconstructed 13th-century Europe.</i>

99
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:55,629
<i>A world of chivalry and combat,
romance and excitement.</i>

100
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,028
<i>Our teams of engineers have spared
no expense in this re-creation...</i>

101
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,509
<i>...precise to the smallest detail.</i>

102
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:02,908
<i>Then we have Roman World:</i>

103
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:07,308
<i>A lusty treat for the senses in the setting
of delightful, decadent Pompeii.</i>

104
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:10,468
<i>Here the traveler experiences
the sensual, relaxed morality...</i>

105
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,228
<i>...that existed at the peak
of the imperial Roman Empire.</i>

106
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,108
<i>All together,
these resorts comprise Delos...</i>

107
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:19,069
<i>...the most exciting vacation spot
in the history of man.</i>

108
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,748
This is Delos Control to Station 3.

109
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:24,388
Your negative deceleration
should be 25...

110
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:28,228
...and ground speed should be 355
and dropping.

111
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,308
<i>The whole spectrum of technology
has been employed in Delos...</i>

112
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:34,348
<i>...for the vacationer's pleasure.
Expensive and unusual...</i>

113
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,309
<i>...Delos is not for everyone.
But for those that choose it...</i>

114
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,909
<i>...it is truly a unique
and rewarding experience.</i>

115
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,988
Think about transferring
for the approach.

116
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:46,268
<i>- Transfer 393.
- Note a wind change...</i>

117
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:54,628
We have you on Grid 5, over.
Notify ground crews.

118
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,229
<i>Stand by. Locking in now.</i>

119
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:10,068
Shut down two, shut down three.

120
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,508
<i>Down two. Down three.</i>

121
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:15,188
Nice job, everybody.

122
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:40,468
<i>Welcome to Delos.</i>

123
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,828
<i>Please go to your color-coded tram...</i>

124
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:45,988
<i>...which will take you
to the world of your choice.</i>

125
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,908
<i>Give your name to the attendant.</i>

126
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:52,188
<i>Welcome to Delos.</i>

127
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:54,108
<i>Please go to your color-coded tram...</i>

128
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:56,628
<i>...which will take you
to the world of your choice.</i>

129
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:58,748
- May I have your name, please?
- John Blane.

130
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,028
- Peter Martin.
- Thank you.

131
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,908
<i>Please go to your color-coded tram...</i>

132
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,908
<i>...which will take you
to the world of your choice.</i>

133
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:10,228
<i>We are sure you will enjoy your stay...</i>

134
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,388
- Was she a...?
- Probably.

135
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:14,549
That's amazing.

136
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:16,228
<i>...there are no rules...</i>

137
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:19,828
Supposedly, you really can't tell,
except by looking at the hands.

138
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,908
<i>...do not be afraid
of hurting anything...</i>

139
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,788
They haven't perfected the hands yet.

140
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:24,948
<i>Nothing can go wrong.</i>

141
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:27,788
<i>You will enjoy your stay
in Roman World.</i>

142
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,228
<i>While you are there, please feel free
to indulge your every whim.</i>

143
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:35,468
<i>Medieval World exists for you,
the guest.</i>

144
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:37,508
<i>Nothing can go wrong.</i>

145
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:33,188
<i>See if you can get another
programmer on the grid.</i>

146
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:37,588
<i>I have a quick fade in the CRT and my
balance controls don't seem to help me.</i>

147
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:39,148
<i>I'm keeping this in real time.</i>

148
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:42,068
<i>Switch me over to an online status
and I'll do it manually.</i>

149
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,788
<i>You've got a 3-millisecond cycle delay
which should be computed in.</i>

150
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:48,348
<i>I don't know what to do
if the stagecoach is late.</i>

151
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:27,668
Oh, it's fantastic.

152
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:50,268
I reckon that's everything.

153
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:52,268
Bath's down the hall.

154
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:55,628
Bath will cost you two bits
for hot water.

155
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,988
Dinner at 7, breakfast at 6:30.
Get lunch on your own.

156
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:01,868
Couple places in town to eat.

157
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,108
Don't look like much here,
but we have everything.

158
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:07,308
Just a minute.

159
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:22,108
- You mean to tell me he's a robot?
- That's what I mean to tell you.

160
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:28,548
I'm paying $1000 a day for this?

161
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,708
Well, it's authentic.

162
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:33,508
The West of the 1880s.

163
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:38,228
Well, at least they could have made it
a little more comfortable.

164
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,147
That's the point.

165
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:42,747
This is really the way it was.

166
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:46,428
If you wanted comfort,
you should have stayed in Chicago.

167
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:48,668
Hey, Julie would have loved all this.

168
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:52,388
Poking around for hours in all those
funny shops, looking for silly...

169
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:55,308
Peter, what the hell's wrong with you?
You're a lawyer.

170
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:58,508
You know better than anybody else
what a ride she took you for.

171
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:01,908
- Well, the kids.
- Well, fine, the kids.

172
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:04,547
Here you are, six months later,
still thinking about it.

173
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:07,348
No, not really.
Just came to mind, is all.

174
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:15,788
There's a lot to do here.

175
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,748
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey.

176
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:20,947
What about you?

177
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:24,868
Uh, vodka martini on the rocks
with a twist of lemon. Very dry, please.

178
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:28,788
Just give him whiskey.
He's new in town.

179
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:36,148
- You gotta get into the feel of the thing.
- I feel silly.

180
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:38,308
Why?

181
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,707
It looks like a joke.

182
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:43,348
Well, it's not a joke,
it's an amusement park.

183
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:45,828
The best amusement park in the world.

184
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:48,348
All you have to do is have fun.

185
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:52,347
Some pretty rough-looking
customers here.

186
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:55,188
- How many of them are...?
- Guests like us?

187
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:59,508
Who knows? That's the beauty
of this place, it doesn't matter.

188
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:03,348
It may look rough,
but it's still just a resort.

189
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:22,028
There's no way to get hurt here.
Just enjoy yourself.

190
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,988
What is this stuff?

191
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,468
It doesn't say.

192
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:39,868
- God. Give me this.
- Puts hair on your chest.

193
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:41,747
Yeah.

194
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,907
Sloppy with your drink.

195
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,748
- Get this boy a bib.
- Ha.

196
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:18,907
Yes, sir.

197
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,388
- Go on.
- No.

198
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,227
He needs his mama.

199
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:36,307
Kill him. If you don't kill him...

200
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:43,268
You talk too much.

201
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:50,948
You say something, boy?

202
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:59,468
I said, you talk too much.

203
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:08,028
Why don't you make me shut up?

204
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,827
Your move.

205
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:21,548
Pretty realistic, huh?

206
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,387
Listen, are you sure he was a...?

207
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:27,947
Of course. You don't really think
you shot anybody, do you?

208
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:32,388
Wow.

209
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:35,428
Hey, John...

210
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,028
...how do I know I'm not gonna kill
another guest with this thing?

211
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,548
Try it.

212
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:47,707
Shoot me.

213
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,748
Go on, shoot.

214
00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:59,148
Shoot!

215
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,948
The gun has a sensing device.

216
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:06,667
It won't fire at anything
with a high body temperature.

217
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:09,148
Only something cold, like a machine.

218
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,068
Hmm.

219
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:12,628
They thought of everything.

220
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:19,227
The Black Knight won't be
repaired till tomorrow afternoon.

221
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:22,787
The dungeon lighting is 55.
Repeat, 55.

222
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:26,667
Yeah, I have the banquet scheduled
for 5:30, if that conforms.

223
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:15,787
Well, what do folks do for companionly
entertainment in this town?

224
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:19,108
I wouldn't know about such things.
I'm just running this hotel.

225
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:22,268
Miss Carrie has a real nice saloon
down at the end of the street.

226
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:27,068
Now, I won't have talk of that woman
in this house. Not over my dinner.

227
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:28,947
The food's real good, ma'am.

228
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:32,268
Thank you, stranger.
You're a gentleman of some breeding.

229
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:35,387
Isn't she terrific?

230
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:37,267
Who's Miss Carrie?

231
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:23,667
Uh...

232
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:26,348
You fellas new in town?

233
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:28,427
Yep.

234
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:30,267
Whiskey.

235
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,628
Just passing through?

236
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:34,867
Maybe.

237
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:37,148
Looking for some fun?

238
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,708
Maybe.

239
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:45,147
Well, you come to the right place.
There's plenty of fun here.

240
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:47,747
That's Cindy and Arlette.

241
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:51,308
Arlette's from Paris.

242
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:54,588
Perhaps you gentlemen
are taking a liking to them.

243
00:20:54,748 --> 00:20:55,747
Perhaps.

244
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:58,307
- They're real accommodating.
- John.

245
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:00,188
They, uh...

246
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:01,907
- They look it.
- John, listen...

247
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:05,347
Why don't you just go on upstairs
and we'll reckon accounts later?

248
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:07,267
- John, are those...?
- Sounds good to me.

249
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:08,867
Are those two girls machines?

250
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,427
Now, how can you say
a thing like that?

251
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:16,307
Come on.

252
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:29,987
What's going on?

253
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:34,307
- They're robbing the bank.
- Robbing the bank?

254
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:37,108
- Hey, maybe we ought to go help out.
- Uh-uh.

255
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:39,747
You don't know,
it might be fun to fight bank robbers.

256
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:43,467
Look, Pete, this is better.

257
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:27,787
There, uh...

258
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:32,707
There is something I have to tell you.
I don't know if it matters...

259
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:34,307
...but it matters to me.

260
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:43,468
I haven't ever had a, uh...

261
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:46,747
A...

262
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:51,627
Well, I hardly know you,
if you know what I mean.

263
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,427
I mean, we just met
a few minutes ago.

264
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,427
And, uh...

265
00:22:56,828 --> 00:22:58,988
You're probably very nice.

266
00:23:18,428 --> 00:23:19,867
I feel funny.

267
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:25,427
Why?

268
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:18,827
I think you're very nice.

269
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:30,747
How was it? Wasn't it terrific?

270
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:33,387
Boy, machines are the servant of man.

271
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:35,467
Wasn't that great?

272
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:36,867
Not bad.

273
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:41,027
"Not bad." Now you're the big lover.

274
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:46,627
Well, you know how it is.
Some guys have a way with women.

275
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:50,027
Shooting stopped.

276
00:24:51,268 --> 00:24:53,027
I guess we missed the robbery.

277
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:56,387
You can't have everything.

278
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:58,507
Mm-mm.

279
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:02,227
- John...
- Hmm?

280
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:05,107
...this place is really fun.

281
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:40,147
I think it's the gyro unit.

282
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,986
- What do you think?
- I wonder if we shouldn't rewire her.

283
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:51,827
I'd replace the
whole unit rather than try to repair it.

284
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:53,106
With a 10?

285
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:54,827
Use an XX-50 if we have any.

286
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:56,507
The double X's have a longer lifespan.

287
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,707
A 50 may not fit in here.

288
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:02,667
Well, maybe you can shift the
integrator unit further up into the cavity.

289
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,547
I'll try.

290
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:13,787
- Mm. Balance servo again?
- Yeah, she fell over this afternoon.

291
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:18,066
I think it's the sensor. But if it's the
central unit, we'll have to open her up.

292
00:29:18,228 --> 00:29:20,946
Well, you get a confirmation
before you do that.

293
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:28,427
- What's he in for?
- Central malfunction.

294
00:29:28,748 --> 00:29:32,227
Another one? Hmm.

295
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:47,187
From the day we opened...

296
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:50,747
...we had a failure-and-breakdown rate
conforming to computer predictions.

297
00:29:50,908 --> 00:29:55,467
That is, 0.3 malfunctions
for each 24-hour activation period...

298
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,627
...concurrent or not.

299
00:29:56,788 --> 00:29:59,906
Now, this was an anticipated operations
aspect of the resort...

300
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:01,867
...and we were fully able to handle it.

301
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:05,907
The majority of the breakdowns
were minor or peripheral...

302
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:07,547
...until about six weeks ago.

303
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:10,866
Then Roman World
had a rise in breakdown rate...

304
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:12,867
...which doubled in a week.

305
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,627
In addition, we saw
a disproportionate rise in central...

306
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:18,067
...as opposed to peripheral,
breakdowns.

307
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:21,587
Now, we identified some problems
with humidity control...

308
00:30:21,748 --> 00:30:23,547
...and regained homeostasis.

309
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:27,147
Well, despite our corrections,
the breakdown rate continued to climb.

310
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:29,907
Then Medieval World began
to have trouble.

311
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:32,587
Now we're seeing
more Western World breakdowns.

312
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,867
There's a clear pattern here
which suggests an analogy...

313
00:30:36,028 --> 00:30:40,147
...to an infectious-disease process,
spreading from one area to the next.

314
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:43,587
Perhaps there are superficial similarities
to disease.

315
00:30:43,748 --> 00:30:47,707
It's only a theoretical concept.
There are many ways to order that data.

316
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:52,467
I must confess, I find it difficult
to believe in a disease of machinery.

317
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:55,227
But we aren't dealing
with ordinary machines here.

318
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:58,147
These are highly complicated
pieces of equipment...

319
00:30:58,307 --> 00:31:00,987
...almost as complicated
as living organisms.

320
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:04,387
In some cases, they've been designed
by other computers.

321
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:06,987
We don't know exactly how they work.

322
00:31:15,388 --> 00:31:20,467
<i>That input goes out at level 55
for pulse forms of 039 duration.</i>

323
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,387
<i>We'll try to stabilize there.</i>

324
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,027
Okay, my telemetry is good.

325
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:28,066
Repeat, I have good telemetry.

326
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:33,267
We have sunrise at 0.43.
Ready on all quadrants.

327
00:31:33,427 --> 00:31:35,346
Energize grid.

328
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:38,427
Grid energized. Confirmed.

329
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:44,747
All right, then give me 436,
if you can patch that in. If not, 435.

330
00:31:44,908 --> 00:31:48,547
I have sound now.
Thank you very much.

331
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:51,266
Yes, I want scrambled eggs and bacon
and cinnamon toast.

332
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:53,667
Do you have cinnamon toast? You do?

333
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,827
Okay, send it down
to Central Control Room, Console 3.

334
00:31:56,988 --> 00:32:00,746
Wait a minute. Now, what was that?
No grounding, Unit 5?

335
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:04,826
Try a bypass.
I have readings on all units, 5 included.

336
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:06,547
Hold on a minute.

337
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,867
All right, let's stand by
for resort activation.

338
00:32:15,988 --> 00:32:19,827
You ready on phase 443?

339
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:24,026
Four-four-three.

340
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:27,626
Okay, we're gonna activate at 59.

341
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:31,227
Lower gain Alpha 2.

342
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:37,867
Ready on six, on five, on four...

343
00:32:38,027 --> 00:32:41,627
...on three, on two, activate now.

344
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:16,106
What do you want?

345
00:34:24,268 --> 00:34:25,426
Not one word.

346
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:28,866
You mind if I finish shaving?

347
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:37,386
Have you no sense of de...?

348
00:35:19,388 --> 00:35:20,706
Was he bothering you?

349
00:35:22,507 --> 00:35:24,146
He isn't gonna bother you again.

350
00:35:24,308 --> 00:35:25,947
Well, I'm here to tell you that things
have changed.

351
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:27,747
There's law here now.

352
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:30,667
You can't go around plugging
whoever you please.

353
00:35:31,947 --> 00:35:33,907
But, sheriff, it was self-defense.

354
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:35,707
That's what they all say.

355
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:38,506
He shot a man.
He'll have to stand trial.

356
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,507
Judge will be here next week.

357
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:43,306
If I were you, I wouldn't trouble
over your friend here.

358
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:46,667
Judge Benson likes to hang them.
Hang them high.

359
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:49,106
- Look, sheriff...
- Beat it.

360
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:53,147
I said, beat it.

361
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,867
I've never been in jail before.

362
00:36:15,027 --> 00:36:17,186
First time for everything.

363
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,026
But I haven't done anything wrong.

364
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:24,866
Well, you shot a man.
That's something.

365
00:36:26,588 --> 00:36:29,586
- Where you from?
- Chicago.

366
00:36:30,428 --> 00:36:33,546
Well, Chicago's a long way
from here, fella.

367
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:37,027
A thousand miles and more.

368
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:00,226
Hold it.

369
00:39:27,107 --> 00:39:29,906
I guess that sort of makes us
desperados.

370
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,986
Yeah, I guess.

371
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,267
Well, what do we do now?

372
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:38,906
Well, the way I figure it,
anything we want.

373
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:41,986
- There's no law in that town now.
- I'll say.

374
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:46,546
- We go in there...
- We do anything we want.

375
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:48,347
You know what?

376
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:52,867
- What?
- I almost believe all this.

377
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:57,026
Well, why shouldn't you believe it?
It's as real as anything else.

378
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,986
Yep. I reckon.

379
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:04,466
- What can you give me in Grid 7?
- We have that on SM-514.

380
00:40:04,627 --> 00:40:07,386
Transfer, now.

381
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:09,866
Transferred.

382
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:11,066
Reschedule.

383
00:40:11,227 --> 00:40:13,987
She wants to meet the king.
We have to restructure for that.

384
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:15,346
Can't disappoint a guest.

385
00:40:15,508 --> 00:40:17,306
<i>Listen, this is the third day in a row...</i>

386
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:19,067
<i>...that I've called you
about my laundry.</i>

387
00:40:19,227 --> 00:40:20,506
<i>You've got all my shirts...</i>

388
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,187
We're rechecking the tapes
on the mechanism now.

389
00:40:23,707 --> 00:40:28,506
We have programmed infidelity in the
queen as of, uh, two minutes ago.

390
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:33,906
All right, coming up on the castle.
Zero, now.

391
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:37,066
<i>It also conforms with your
five-year history at this time of year.</i>

392
00:40:40,987 --> 00:40:42,866
Leave me now.

393
00:40:57,227 --> 00:40:59,066
My queen.

394
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:07,627
If the king should hear of this,
we would both be put to death.

395
00:41:07,827 --> 00:41:11,026
I would be more than happy
to die for you, my lady.

396
00:41:11,187 --> 00:41:13,986
Let us pray it shall not be so.

397
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:16,906
I have news.

398
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:20,906
The Black Knight has returned
and seeks a match with you.

399
00:41:21,347 --> 00:41:24,426
- The Black Knight?
- None other.

400
00:41:24,587 --> 00:41:26,506
Is he pretty tough?

401
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:31,146
He has the strength of 10,
and cunning besides.

402
00:41:31,427 --> 00:41:34,826
But his sight is weak in his left eye.

403
00:41:34,987 --> 00:41:38,026
Stay to his left and you will prevail
and win the day.

404
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:40,866
Confirmation of the reprogramming
of that Black Knight...

405
00:41:41,027 --> 00:41:44,546
...for left lateral weakness and
instability for tomorrow.

406
00:41:44,707 --> 00:41:46,866
I shall see you on the morrow?

407
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:48,666
My lady.

408
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:18,266
The schedule of tomorrow a.m.

409
00:42:18,427 --> 00:42:22,106
It's his last day in the resort.
Let's make it a lulu.

410
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:25,026
Tomorrow a.m., broadswords.
Schedule locked.

411
00:42:25,187 --> 00:42:27,946
We have a problem with
the air conditioning in Beta section.

412
00:42:28,107 --> 00:42:29,346
Send a crew out.

413
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,946
Yes. He can be sheriff
any time he wants.

414
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:34,426
That is correct.
Just give him the badge.

415
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:49,466
Now, I'm the new law around here.

416
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:53,106
You think you can handle things?

417
00:42:55,347 --> 00:42:57,626
You wanna try me?

418
00:43:24,107 --> 00:43:26,586
A thousand pardons, milord.

419
00:43:28,387 --> 00:43:30,986
What is your name, child?

420
00:43:31,147 --> 00:43:32,546
Daphne.

421
00:43:33,387 --> 00:43:35,546
Daphne.

422
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:38,386
Oh, I love this place.

423
00:43:39,187 --> 00:43:40,506
I love my horse.

424
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:43,906
- I love my horse and I love Julie.
- Oh, shut up, will you?

425
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,386
I like the spots on my horse.

426
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:49,426
- Did you see the spots on the horse?
- Your horse is beautiful.

427
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:52,065
- Thank you very much. I liked yours too.
- Thank you.

428
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:54,786
Look out.

429
00:43:54,946 --> 00:43:56,146
Let me handle this.

430
00:44:03,147 --> 00:44:04,226
Get it, get it, John.

431
00:44:19,147 --> 00:44:20,426
Goddamn it.

432
00:44:20,587 --> 00:44:23,946
- Do you suppose it's real?
- Hell, no.

433
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:25,826
That's not supposed to happen.

434
00:44:25,987 --> 00:44:28,346
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's part of the thing.

435
00:44:28,507 --> 00:44:33,506
The hell. Goddamn machines, anyway.
That's not supposed to happen.

436
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:37,106
- A rattlesnake struck a guest?
- He was shooting at it and missed.

437
00:44:37,267 --> 00:44:39,626
Even so, the snakes are programmed
never to strike.

438
00:44:39,787 --> 00:44:42,146
- Was the guest injured?
- Minor puncture wounds.

439
00:44:42,307 --> 00:44:46,026
Inexcusable to injure a guest. Pick up
that snake for a total post at once.

440
00:44:46,187 --> 00:44:50,426
Check all the snake's central mechanisms
tonight during the repair period.

441
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,706
Doesn't anything work around here?

442
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:15,346
Logic circuits on the snake
simply failed to respond.

443
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:17,906
There was no sign of
mechanical damage or tampering...

444
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,266
...and no clue to the malfunction.

445
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:22,186
Central mechanism psychosis?

446
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,626
I feel we should shut down the resort
for a month.

447
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:25,786
Oh, that seems rash.

448
00:46:25,946 --> 00:46:28,866
Well, a snake injured a guest.
We can't allow that to happen.

449
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:31,786
Many elements of the Delos Resort
are potentially dangerous.

450
00:46:31,947 --> 00:46:34,346
That's part of the appeal,
but if they become truly...

451
00:46:34,507 --> 00:46:35,666
I agree.

452
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,025
We can announce
that the resort is overbooked...

453
00:46:38,187 --> 00:46:40,866
...and not allow any further
new guests to arrive.

454
00:46:41,026 --> 00:46:42,986
We can take care of the ones
already here.

455
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:46,466
If we can't insure the safety of
the guests, we're in desperate trouble.

456
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:50,746
But we can insure their safety.
Everything's fine.

457
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:36,746
All right, let's start that bar fight.

458
00:47:36,907 --> 00:47:38,505
Cheat.

459
00:47:44,307 --> 00:47:48,105
- John, what do you say?
- Uh... Hit me.

460
00:48:07,267 --> 00:48:09,546
Now, that's just rude.

461
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:18,425
Okay.

462
00:48:21,306 --> 00:48:24,185
Hey, look out. Look out.

463
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,146
Whoa.

464
00:49:00,307 --> 00:49:03,026
Hey, sheriff! Come on!

465
00:49:19,907 --> 00:49:21,225
Come on, let's go upstairs.

466
00:49:29,026 --> 00:49:30,466
Look out.

467
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:39,546
Yeah. Woo-hoo!

468
00:50:14,186 --> 00:50:15,145
Yeah.

469
00:50:32,627 --> 00:50:34,506
- What's his problem?
- Nothing.

470
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:37,225
He got shot up today,
so we're taking the opportunity...

471
00:50:37,386 --> 00:50:39,425
- ...to replace the visual cortex.
- Mm-hm.

472
00:50:39,587 --> 00:50:41,946
Using the new infrared units.

473
00:50:42,107 --> 00:50:44,745
And we're increasing audio sensitivity.

474
00:50:48,866 --> 00:50:52,425
- You called for me, my lord?
- Yes.

475
00:50:53,347 --> 00:50:56,025
How long have you been
in the palace, Daphne?

476
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:58,946
- Since I was 3, my lord.
- Aww...

477
00:50:59,107 --> 00:51:01,065
Charming.

478
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:04,546
I think we ought to get to know
each other better, Daphne.

479
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:06,825
Better, milord?

480
00:51:07,386 --> 00:51:10,506
I can reward you well.

481
00:51:12,586 --> 00:51:13,985
Milord.

482
00:51:14,146 --> 00:51:16,066
Daphne.

483
00:51:16,586 --> 00:51:18,026
Milord.

484
00:51:18,187 --> 00:51:20,226
Daphne.

485
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,585
Milord forgets himself.

486
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:27,945
Uh-oh. Problem with
the girl. Program breakdown.

487
00:51:28,626 --> 00:51:29,625
What's the trouble?

488
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,785
One of the castle machines
isn't responding.

489
00:51:31,946 --> 00:51:34,145
Refusing a guest's seduction.

490
00:51:34,306 --> 00:51:36,585
Get her out of there,
report it to Central Repair.

491
00:51:36,746 --> 00:51:38,066
Right.

492
00:51:38,226 --> 00:51:40,106
Refusing?

493
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:59,426
- Did you find the trouble?
- No apparent trouble.

494
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:01,585
But she wasn't following
programming.

495
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:04,266
She refused a guest's seduction,
and she is a sex model.

496
00:52:04,426 --> 00:52:07,146
- Certainly is.
- You think they're gonna shut down?

497
00:52:07,306 --> 00:52:11,626
No, the directors feel to close down now
would hurt tourist confidence.

498
00:52:11,986 --> 00:52:13,225
I don't like it.

499
00:52:20,466 --> 00:52:22,265
Breakfast.

500
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:43,265
I'm never gonna drink again.

501
00:53:04,747 --> 00:53:06,305
Aah...

502
00:53:07,946 --> 00:53:09,905
Okay, I've gained 437.

503
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:12,345
I'm not getting sound pickup
in the 10th quadrant.

504
00:53:12,506 --> 00:53:15,266
Please check my Lisda console.

505
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:34,746
Hold, varlet.

506
00:53:43,947 --> 00:53:46,986
- Are you speaking to me?
- None other, sire.

507
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:50,546
Uh, lookit, I'm hungry and I...

508
00:53:52,747 --> 00:53:56,586
Prepare for thy doom,
thy scurrilous knave, huh?

509
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:59,145
Wait a minute.
Uh... Can't we talk this over?

510
00:53:59,307 --> 00:54:01,386
What, have you no spine, varlet?

511
00:54:01,546 --> 00:54:04,425
- Well, I...
- Aha.

512
00:54:04,626 --> 00:54:06,265
The queen.

513
00:54:09,826 --> 00:54:10,826
Full monitor.

514
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:16,065
Okay.

515
00:54:16,946 --> 00:54:17,946
Let him go.

516
00:55:15,466 --> 00:55:18,545
Oh, what a hangover.

517
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:40,345
Aye, varlet.

518
00:55:45,586 --> 00:55:48,185
We're losing a little tolerance.
Bring me up.

519
00:56:18,506 --> 00:56:20,145
Shut down. Shut down immediately.

520
00:56:26,067 --> 00:56:27,825
Circuits don't respond, sir.

521
00:56:27,987 --> 00:56:29,985
- Then cut the robot power.
- Power cut.

522
00:56:32,266 --> 00:56:34,665
Oh, my head.

523
00:56:39,986 --> 00:56:42,065
I'm freezing.

524
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:49,185
Gotta get to the hotel.

525
00:56:50,586 --> 00:56:52,305
I think I'm gonna be sick.

526
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,425
- They're not responding.
- Should we cut the main power grid, sir?

527
00:57:06,586 --> 00:57:08,265
Shut it all down. Shut it all down.

528
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:20,065
Hold it.

529
00:57:25,867 --> 00:57:29,905
Come on, not now. Not you again.

530
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:32,065
It's too early.

531
00:57:34,146 --> 00:57:36,345
Let me do it this time.

532
00:57:39,066 --> 00:57:40,825
Your move.

533
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:53,585
- I'm shot.
- What?

534
00:57:54,746 --> 00:57:56,705
I'm shot.

535
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:07,985
John?

536
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:20,945
Oh, my God.

537
00:58:23,706 --> 00:58:24,785
Draw.

538
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,705
Sir, we have no control
over the robots at all.

539
00:59:45,345 --> 00:59:48,785
- They're running on stored charge.
- How long can they go?

540
00:59:48,946 --> 00:59:52,025
Some will begin to run down in an hour.
Others can go a full 12.

541
01:00:04,746 --> 01:00:07,825
- Turn the main grid back on.
- The relays must be frozen.

542
01:00:07,986 --> 01:00:09,545
We can't get back our power.

543
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:12,425
Hello? Hello? Hello?

544
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:56,145
Listen, how we gonna get out of here?
All these doors are electrically powered.

545
01:00:57,586 --> 01:01:00,585
Now, get these doors
open in here before we all suffocate.

546
01:04:04,985 --> 01:04:07,345
Temperature elevated, 98 degrees.

547
01:04:07,506 --> 01:04:10,705
Oxygen, 17 percent and dropping.

548
01:04:10,865 --> 01:04:13,945
Get that power on
so we can open these doors.

549
01:04:39,665 --> 01:04:41,385
Hey.

550
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:49,745
- Hey.
- Don't shoot me.

551
01:04:50,746 --> 01:04:52,665
Hey, wait a minute.

552
01:04:54,866 --> 01:04:56,225
What's the matter with you?

553
01:04:58,706 --> 01:04:59,704
Hold out your hands.

554
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:03,264
Let me see your hands.

555
01:05:06,145 --> 01:05:09,024
You're a guest.
You really gave me a scare.

556
01:05:09,185 --> 01:05:12,265
Look, uh, everything's broken down.
The machines have gone crazy.

557
01:05:12,426 --> 01:05:13,745
You know about the machines?

558
01:05:13,906 --> 01:05:15,584
Yeah, I repair them.

559
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,825
There's one chasing me now.
A gunslinger.

560
01:05:18,386 --> 01:05:23,144
Gunslinger.
Must be a model 404, maybe a 406.

561
01:05:23,305 --> 01:05:26,665
If he's a 406,
he's got all the sensory equipment.

562
01:05:26,826 --> 01:05:29,184
- It's a beautiful machine.
- He's after me!

563
01:05:29,345 --> 01:05:31,305
- I don't doubt it.
- What can I do?

564
01:05:31,466 --> 01:05:34,745
There's nothing you can do.
He'll get you. You haven't got a chance.

565
01:05:34,906 --> 01:05:38,065
- There must be something.
- Fella, don't kid yourself.

566
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:41,625
There are things you could try,
acid for his visual system...

567
01:05:41,785 --> 01:05:44,505
...noise for his hearing.
No matter what you did...

568
01:05:44,665 --> 01:05:48,625
...he'll always be one jump ahead of you.
You haven't got a chance.

569
01:05:51,705 --> 01:05:52,745
Yes, I do.

570
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:42,864
Ha.

571
01:19:42,705 --> 01:19:44,824
Help me.

572
01:19:46,825 --> 01:19:49,384
Help me.

573
01:19:50,785 --> 01:19:53,224
Help me.

574
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:59,264
Help me.

575
01:20:04,505 --> 01:20:07,423
Help me.

576
01:20:10,145 --> 01:20:12,144
All right. It's all right.

577
01:20:32,824 --> 01:20:33,824
- It's okay.
- Help me.

578
01:20:33,985 --> 01:20:35,064
All right, all right.

579
01:20:35,225 --> 01:20:37,304
- Help me.
- You're gonna be all right.

580
01:20:37,585 --> 01:20:39,584
Help me.

581
01:20:41,304 --> 01:20:43,824
Help me...

582
01:20:51,705 --> 01:20:52,983
No water.

583
01:20:53,145 --> 01:20:55,023
- Go ahead. Go ahead and drink.
- No water.

584
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:58,664
- I'm trying to help you.
- No water. No. No. N...

585
01:23:07,585 --> 01:23:10,184
<i>Why don't you make
arrangements to take our hovercraft...</i>

586
01:23:10,345 --> 01:23:13,064
<i>...to Medieval World, Roman World
and Westworld?</i>

587
01:23:13,225 --> 01:23:15,784
<i>Contact us today,
or see your travel agent.</i>

588
01:23:15,945 --> 01:23:19,063
<i>Boy, have we got a vacation for you.
Vacation for you.</i>

589
01:23:19,225 --> 01:23:25,384
<i>For you, for you, you, you, you...</i>
