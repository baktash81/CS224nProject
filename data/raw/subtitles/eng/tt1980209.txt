Just not the less I was used to.</i>

2737
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:16,918
<i>Well, I took a real swing for it,
you know?</i>

2738
02:00:17,293 --> 02:00:20,843
<i>And for a while, it was like
I always thought it would be.</i>

2739
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:22,299
<i>I was one of you.</i>

2740
02:00:22,382 --> 02:00:24,009
<i>And it felt good.</i>

2741
02:00:24,217 --> 02:00:26,561
<i>People finally saw me like I saw myself</i>

2742
02:00:26,636 --> 02:00:28,309
<i>and you can't ask for more than that.</i>

2743
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:30,974
<i>Maybe I did, though.</i>

2744
02:00:31,182 --> 02:00:34,311
<i>Maybe it got so I didn't want to
be "equal to" anymore.</i>

2745
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:36,692
<i>I wanted to be "better than."</i>

2746
02:00:36,813 --> 02:00:38,907
<i>And that's a recipe for injury.</i>

2747
02:00:38,982 --> 02:00:41,076
<i>That doesn't mean you give up, though.</i>

2748
02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:44,371
<i>You rest, you heal and
you get back on that bench.</i>

2749
02:00:44,863 --> 02:00:46,740
<i>Life is going to give me another set.</i>

2750
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:48,120
<i>And I am going to rock it.</i>

2751
02:00:48,199 --> 02:00:49,826
<i>Because my name is Daniel Lugo,</i>

2752
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,911
<i>and I believe in fitness.</i>
