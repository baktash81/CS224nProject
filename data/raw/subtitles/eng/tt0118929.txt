Mrs. Murdoch,
why didn't you report this before?

00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:42,584
I mean, if your husband has been missing
as long as you say...

I thought he'd simply
walked out on me.

of something?

00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,020
if it's Main Street west
or the cross-town.

359
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,195
I'm sorry, Inspector,
I cannot be of more assistance...

360
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,072
but I am running late
for an appointment.

361
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,366
Well, I appreciate
your taking the time.

362
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,918
There's just one thing
that puzzles me.

363
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:36,631
I've met quite a few murderers
in the course of my work.

364
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,342
Murdoch doesn't strike me as one.

365
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:43,054
Perhaps you are not
accustomed to digging deep enough.

366
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,598
Well, I do know when someone
is lying to me, Doctor.

367
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,268
Forgive me, Inspector,
but you are not a clinician.

368
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:52,063
Judging personalities
happens to be my business.

369
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,107
Well, maybe you could
give me a few pointers.

370
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,984
Certainly.

371
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,069
Let's take you, for instance.

372
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,448
You are a fastidious man, driven.

373
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,616
Consumed by details.

374
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,286
I would say your life is...

375
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,580
rather lonely.

376
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,958
Good evening, Inspector.
I really must be going.

377
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,557
[Starts engine]

378
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:57,670
WOMAN: Closing time.
The pool is now closed.

379
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,428
Dr. Schreber.

380
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:11,851
Most unfortunate it is that we were
forced to seek you out here.

381
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,438
You know how uncomfortable
we find all this...

382
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,440
moisture.

383
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,985
- I'm sorry. I--
- Failed to report in, yes.

384
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,655
I was frightened.
I--I have a weak heart, you know.

385
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:27,534
Your weakness is not, we think,
an affair of the heart.

386
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,245
We found this
in his hotel room.

387
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,207
Must we reproduce
Mr. Murdoch's memories again?

388
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,333
I tried to imprint him...

389
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,502
but he woke up, he knocked the syringe
right out of my hand.

390
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,629
I tried to stop him but he was too fast.

391
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,839
He has no memories, then?

392
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,217
Only fragments.
The procedure, it was interrupted.

393
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,054
I--I guess it's only a matter
of rounding him up.

394
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,681
You have had strays
before, right?

395
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:53,393
This is no stray, Doctor.
This one can tune.

396
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,563
But that's impossible.
I thought only you had that ability.

397
00:30:56,646 --> 00:31:00,900
You will process another template
of the subject's memories, yes?

398
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,694
Of course. I'll imprint him again.

399
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:07,282
No. We require them
for a quite different purpose.

400
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,535
It's almost midnight,
Dr. Schreber.

401
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,037
We'll talk again
after tonight's tuning, but...

402
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,373
no more delays, yes?

403
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:20,169
No more inconsistencies
in your behavior.

404
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,337
[Loud noise]

405
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,638
You appear quite frail, Doctor.

406
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,893
Perhaps some exercise
would do you good.

- Kate.

410
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,456
- How is he?
- The same.

411
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,418
Walenski? It's me, Frank.

[Key in lock]

413
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,259
Come in, Frank.

414
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,056
Close the door.

415
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,816
I've been looking through
some of your old reports.

416
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,902
It's an interesting case.

417
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,866
The kind that can make
a man's career...

418
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,117
or break it.

419
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,495
Yeah, I was on that case.

420
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:39,791
And then what?
What happened then, Eddie?

421
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,668
Nothing happened, Frank.

422
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,838
I've just been spending time
on the subway, riding in circles.

423
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,799
Thinking in circles.

424
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:49,801
There's no way out.

425
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,471
I've been over every inch
of this city.

426
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,520
You're scaring your wife
to death, Eddie.

427
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,313
She's not my wife.

428
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,734
I don't know who she is.
I don't know who any of us are.

429
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,695
What makes you say that?

430
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,863
Do you think about
the past much, Frank?

431
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,783
As much as the next guy.

432
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,495
See, I've been trying
to remember things--

433
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,206
clearly remember things
from my past.

434
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:25,712
But the more I try to think back,
the more it all starts to unravel.

435
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,046
None of it seems real.

436
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,466
It's like I've just been
dreaming this life...

437
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,053
and when I finally wake up
I'll be somebody else.

438
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,972
Somebody totally different.

didn't you, Eddie?

441

Something to do with the case.

442
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,486
There is no case.
There never was!

443
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,991

12 family photo albums,
9 personal diaries...

00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:47,960
17 love letters,
assorted childhood photographs...

449
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:52,131
26 wallets,
ID's and social security cards.

DR. SCHREBER:
These do bring back memories.

451
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,846
This one is still warm.

What is it?

453
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,935
The recollections of a great lover?

454
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,979
A catalog of conquests?

455
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,564
We will soon find out.

456
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,529
You wouldn't appreciate that,
would you, Mr. Whatever your name is?

457
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,991
Not the sort of conquests
you would ever understand.

And last, but not least...

463
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,346

the evolutionary ladder.

to master our gifts.

The idea that a simple man
could develop the ability to tune--

Why can't I remember anything?
What have you done to me?

536
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,051
Nothing, nothing.
Please, I want to help you.

537
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,386
We can't talk here.

538
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,638
It is not safe.
If they see us together, they'll--

539
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,098
I don't care.
I want some answers.

540
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,474
I want some answers now!

541
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,684
Who are they?

542
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,644
Why are they trying to kill me?

543
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,895
- Answer me!
- Oh!

544
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,237
My God. You really can do it.

545
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,571
I did that?

546
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,865
Listen to me, John.
You have their power.

547
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,992
You can make things happen
by will alone.

548
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:07,329
They call it tuning. That is how they make
the buildings change.

549
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,915
Just now you acted out
of self-defense. A reflex.

550
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,793
But I can teach you to control
your power consciously.

551
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,170
Let me help you, John.
Together we can stop them.

552
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,839
We can take the city back.

553
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,590
[Panting]

554
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:20,884

556
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,305

[People chatting]

565
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:15,022
He made a terrible
impression for the firm...

566
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,399
lollygagging around as he did.

567
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,319
So I simply told Frederickson
I was going to have to let him go.

568
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,113
And well you should have, darling.

569
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,823
He attacked me.

570
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,034
I don't know where he has gone.

571
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,995
Come, Dr. Schreber.

572
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,581
We have much to do.

573
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,416
Yes?

574
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,126
Yes.

575
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,796
[Clock ticking]

576
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:58,690
# They say that you're

00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:06,615
# It isn't so #

579
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:15,582
# But if you put me down
for another #

580
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,087
# I'll know #

581
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,633
# Believe me, I'll know #

582
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:30,138
# 'Cause the night #

# If you are true to me #

587
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,957
# So remember #

588
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,713
# When you tell those little white lies #

589
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:13,223
# That the night
has a thousand eyes #

[Applause]

592
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,693
MAN: Whoo!

593
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,824
Tonight's experiment shall be conducted
in the following locations.

594
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:35,287
The first subject
shall be imprinted here on Avenue M.

595
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,831
Mr. Book. There is a--a problem.

596
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,209
There is no Avenue M.
We were unable to complete it.

597
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,963
During the last tuning
we detected a lack of control.

598
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,674
An opposing influence
on the machines?

599
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:52,471
Then this man Murdoch
is more powerful than we thought.

600
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,264
He's becoming like us.

601
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:58,852
So we must become like him.

602
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,313
The good doctor
has done as we asked?

603
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:04,691
The life and times
of John Murdoch, Volume 2.

604
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,321
We must not do this.

605
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:12,908
Murdoch does not possess
these memories, yes?

606
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,619
How will his imprint
allow us to find him?

607
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,996
Everywhere he goes...

608
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,666
everyone he seeks out
will be known to us.

609
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:25,671
And as he follows the clues,
so shall we follow the memories.

610
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,382
Perhaps we have forgotten
what happened last time, when we t--

611
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,551
Yes. Poor, poor Mr.--

612
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,470
We have not forgotten.

613
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:40,811
If Mr. Hand wishes to make this sacrifice
for the greater good...

614
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,854
so be it.

615
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:48,068
But to imprint one of us.
Failure has always resulted.

616
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,655
What Mr. Hand proposes
is our only option.

617
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,156
Imprint.

618
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,622
This may sting a bit.

619
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,625
Ah!

620
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,669
Aah!

622
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,599
Ah.

[Chuckles]

624
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,327
Is it done?

625
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,622
Oh, yes, Mr. Book.

626
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,085
I have John Murdoch...in mind.

627
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,050
"Johnny...

628
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,220
"I found this postcard
among your mother's things.

00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,666
Harris.

"Harris Karl."

639
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,469
Excuse me. Can you tell
me the way to Avenue C?

640
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,762
Try the subway.

641
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,309
You got a problem, pal?

642
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:47,312
You, uh, been working here long?

643
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:52,776
25 years. No days off
for good behavior.

00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,794
Mm! Mmm! Mm!

00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:15,006
Mm! Mm! Mm! Mm!

647
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,970
We're looking for John Murdoch.

648
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,179
Mmm!

649
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,711
Shhhh.

651
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,006
MR. WALL:
She knows nothing, Mr. Hand.

652
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,175
A dead end, yes, Mr. Wall.

653
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,802
We thought his imprint would
allow us to track him, yes...

654
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,263
but instead we have
been brought here.

655
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,931
This is irrational.

656
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,309
Instincts are irrational, Mr. Wall...

657
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:10,770
and we must follow
where they lead, yes.

658
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:15,317
Mr. Sleep suggests he may go
to places familiar...his job.

659
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,402
He does not care about our job.

660
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,280
Indulge us, Mr. Hand.

661
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,948
If you were Murdoch--

662
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:22,991
Yes.

663
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,951
If...

664
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,620
I were Murdoch...

665
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,081
I would remember...

666
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,752
how my wife had hurt me
by sleeping with another man.

667
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,796
And then...

668
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:42,010
I would look for a way
to hurt her in return.

669
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,016
- Leave me alone with her.
- [Sobs]

670

Platform 3, all change.

00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,237
All change? Excuse me.

674
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,613
How do I get to the end of the line?

675
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,240
You want the Express.

00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:14,209
ANNOUNCER: No trains leave
on platform 7.

677
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,627
- You want platform 2.
- Got it. Thanks a lot.

678
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,670
Hey!

679
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,171
How come that train didn't stop?

680
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,756
That's the Express.

681
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,968
There's no way out, you know?

682
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,971
You can't get out of the city.
Believe me, I've tried.

683
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,723
You're Murdoch, aren't you?

684
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,892
The one they've been looking for.

685
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,811
- Who are you?
- Used to be a cop.

686
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,981
At least, in this life, I was.

687
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,483
They steal people's
memories, you know?

688
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,819
Then they swap them around
between us.

689
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,530
I've seen them do it.
Back and forth, back and forth...

690
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,657
till no one knows
who they are anymore.

691
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,992
How do you know all this?

692
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:51,329
Once in a while, one of us wakes up
while they're changing things.

693
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,623
It's not supposed to happen,
but it does.

694
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,667
It happened to me.

695
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,669
They'll come looking for you, Murdoch.

696
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,422
Just like they'll come looking for me.

697
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,507
But that's OK.

698
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,009
I figured a way out.

699
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,427
[Horn blasts]

700

[People screaming]

701
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,813
They were here.

702
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,941
Last night.

703
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,319
This was to be his home.

704
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,988
Ah.

705
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,865
That was when we loved her.

706
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,783
This is all well and good, Mr. Hand...

707
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:33,371
But we require a more practical link
to his present whereabouts.

708
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,292
Yes.

709
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,879
And I know where to find her.

710
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,598
We're very lucky,
when you think about it.

711
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,640
EMMA: I'm sorry?

712
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:56,978
To be able to revisit those places
which have meant so very much to us.

713
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,856
I thought it was more
that we were haunted by them.

714
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,941

01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,670
You let me ask you a question?

896
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,131
You heard of a place
called Shell Beach?

897
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:44,675
- Sure.
- You know how to get there?

898
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,135
- Yeah.
- You tell me?

899
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:50,347
Oh, all right. You just, uh--
You go to the...

900
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:52,266
Where? Where do you go?

901
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,435
Just give me a second, will ya?

902
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:58,272
You can't remember, can you?

903
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:01,984
You think that's kind of odd?

904
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,110
JOHN MURDOCH: Hmm?

905
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,029
Wait.

906
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,447
I got a better one for you.

907
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:07,781
When was the last time...

908
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,701
you remember doing
something during the day?

909
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:11,827
What do you mean?

910
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,121
I just mean...during the day.

911
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:16,206
Ha. Daylight.

912
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,791
When was the last time
you remember seeing it?

913
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,587
And I'm not talking about some distant,
half-forgotten childhood memory.

914
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,757
I mean like yesterday?
Last week? When?

915
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,259
Can you come up
with a single memory?

916
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:30,054
You can't, can you?

917
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:33,307
You know something?
I don't think the sun even...

918
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,060
exists...in this place.

919
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:40,356
'Cause I've been up for hours and hours
and hours and the night never ends here.

920
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,734
- That is crazy.
- You're damn right this is crazy.

921
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:46,195
Listen to me, Bumstead.
It's not just me.

922
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:48,238
It's all of us.

923
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,823
They're doing something to all of us.

924
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:52,618
- Shut up, you--I've--I've heard enough.
- Please listen.

925
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,453
- Shut up, will ya! Shut up!
- Listen to me.

926
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:07,966
There has to be an explanation
for this somewhere.

927
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,434
Explain this.

928
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,284
[Door slams]

929
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:40,249
John, I'm so sorry.

930
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,001
I never meant to hurt you, John...

931
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,169
and I did it,
and I don't know why I did.

932
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,380
I wish I could take it all back.

933
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,966
No. Emma... You didn't do it.

934
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:51,760
This...affair of yours,
whatever it is...

935
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,429
the thing you're
supposed to have done...

936
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,305
you didn't do it.
I don't believe it ever happened.

937
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,765
What do you mean?

938
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,143
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

939
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:02,146
but what if we never
knew each other before now?

940
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:04,565
What if the first time we ever met...

941
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:08,444
was last night in your--
in our apartment...

942
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:11,405
and everything you remember...

943
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:14,324
and everything that I'm supposed
to remember never really happened?

944
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,952
Someone just wants us to think it did.

945
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,501
You know, back in the apartment...

946
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,754
I suddenly felt like
I didn't know you at all.

947
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:32,050
It was as if you were a stranger.

948
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,054
But how can that be true?

949
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:40,726
I so vividly remember meeting you.

950
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,854
I remember falling in love with you.

951
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:46,482
I remember losing you.

952
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:47,900
Time's up.

953
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:50,694
No, wait, wait.

954
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:52,863
Please, just...

955
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:54,031
just one more minute.

956
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:02,664
I love you, John.

957
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,212
You can't fake something like that.

958
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,506
No, you can't.

959
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,952
[Knock on door]

960
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,621
Inspector? Sir?

961
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:46,542
Detective Walenski
killed himself last night.

962
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:50,379
I--Um...kind of thought
you should know.

963
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:55,676
Oh, and...
the chief wanted to see you.

964
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,011
Sir...

965
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,103
I knew you'd track the killer down, sir.

966
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,825
Um...sir...

968
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:37,134
How can we help you, sir?

969
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:39,595
You can sleep.

970
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:42,681
Gentlemen--

971
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,349
Sleep. Sleep.

972
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:49,229
Evening, sir.

973
01:16:58,113 --> 01:16:59,197
Bumstead.

974
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,621
I wanted to be the first
to congratulate you...about the case.

975
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:11,084
Take us to Murdoch.

976
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:12,252
Sleep.

977
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:24,222
[Chokes]

978
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:41,198
Dr. Schreber.

979
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:42,366
Ah.

980
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,159
I knew you'd come eventually.

981
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:46,870
Don't you think it's about time
you started giving me some answers?

982
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:49,122
Yes. Yes, of course.

983
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,957
Won't you please sit down?

984
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:56,046
I--I come here quite often.

985
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:58,548
It's one of the few places
I'm allowed a moment's peace.

986
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:01,968
You--You see,
they have an aversion to--to water.

987
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:05,555
One could almost call it a phobia.
Ha ha ha ha.

988
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,892
Who are they?
What do they want from me?

989
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:10,477
Right.

990
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,562
Well, for now, let's just say...

991
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:15,315
that you were the subject
of their experiment.

992
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,775
W--We all are.

993
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:20,987
You're not crazy, John.

994
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,490
And you are not a murderer.

995
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,160
I'm sorry about this. I truly am.

996
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,745
But we do not have much time...

997
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,415
and I cannot afford the luxury
of doing this the right way.

998
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:32,958
Everything you need to know...

999
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,335
all the answers
are in this syringe.

1000
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:36,586
I need you to inject yourself.

1001
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,005
It's the only way to
make you understand.

1002
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:40,340
You're kidding me, right?

1003
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:43,385
We're running out of time, John.
You have to do this now.

1004
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:45,429
Give me the gun, Doctor.

1005
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,889
Inspector, he is more
disturbed than we thought.

1006
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,642
I may not be the judge of personality
that you are, Doctor...

1007
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:53,687
but you're the one
who looks disturbed to me.

1008
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:56,398
You do not know
what you are doing.

1009
01:18:57,607 --> 01:19:01,194
What, exactly is in this...Doctor?

1010
01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:05,115
All the answers you've
been looking for, John.

1011
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:06,241
I swear to you.

1012
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:07,743
Uh-huh.

1013
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:12,831
Guess I'll just have to
hold on to it for...safekeeping.

1014
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,082
If you don't mind.

1015
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,542
Let's go, Doctor.

1016
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:22,215
- Go? Where are we going?
- Shell Beach.

1017
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,594
That's where you want to go, isn't it?

1018
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:27,262
The ocean.

1019
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,814
Why are you doing this?

1020
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:41,109
What do you hope to gain by helping me?

1021
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,736
The truth.

1022
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:46,448
None of these maps extend far enough
to show the ocean.

1023
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:47,866
You won't find anything there...

1024
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,826
I promise you!
I've been there, and--

1025
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,454
lf you've been there,
you can show us the way, then, can't you?

1026
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,165
We'll see for ourselves.

1027
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:57,250
I won't.

1028
01:19:58,418 --> 01:20:01,171
I refuse.
You--You can't make me go there!

1029
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,382
Ah!

1030
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,510
Ah!

1031
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:09,805
Ah! Ah!

1032
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:15,602
You were saying, doctor?

1033
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,867
I don't understand.
Used to be a bridge here.

1034
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:39,167
Try that again,
your friends are gonna be...

1035
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,544
fishing you out of the canal.

1036
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:41,962
Just don't hurt me.
I'll tell you everything.

1037
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,089
It doesn't matter anymore anyway.

1038
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:53,306
What? [Gasps]

1039
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:57,227
Who are you people?

1040
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:05,902
We will give you some more
pretty things soon...Anna.

1041
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,571
I'm not Anna.

1042
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,324
You will be soon, yes.

1043
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:18,290
I have another use for her first.

1044
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:30,218
First there was darkness.
Then came the strangers.

1045
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,681
They abducted us
and brought us here.

1046
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:38,685
This city, everyone in it...

1047
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:40,103
is their experiment.

1048
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:43,023
They mix and match
our memories as they see fit...

1049
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:45,859
trying to divine
what makes us unique.

1050
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:49,279
One day, a man
might be an inspector.

1051
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:52,282
The next, someone entirely different.

1052
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:55,619
When they want to
study a murderer for instance...

1053
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:59,497
they simply imprint one of their citizens
with a new personality...

1054
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:04,628
arrange a family for him,
friends, an entire history...

1055
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,463
even a lost wallet.

1056
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,715
Then they observe the results.

1057
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:14,220
Will a man, given the history
of a killer, continue in that vein?

1058
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:18,266
Or are we, in fact, more
than the mere sum of our memories?

1059
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:23,313
This business of you being a killer
was an unhappy coincidence.

1060
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:26,191
You have had dozens
of lives before now.

1061
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,611
You just happened to wake up
while I was imprinting you with this one.

1062
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:32,489
Why are they doing all of this?

1063
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:35,909
It is our capacity for individuality...

1064
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:38,495
our souls that makes
us different from them.

1065
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:40,914
They think they
can find the human soul...

1066
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:44,084
if they understand
how our memories work.

1067
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:45,377
All they have
are collective memories.

1068
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,254
They share one group mind.

1069
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:49,756
They're dying, you see?

1070
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:53,218
Their entire race
is on the brink of extinction.

1071
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:55,136
They think we can save them.

1072
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,639
- Where do I fit in?
- You are different, John.

1073
01:22:58,264 --> 01:23:01,101
You resisted my attempt
to imprint you.

1074
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:09,109
Somehow you have developed
their ability to tune.

1075
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:10,402
That is how they change things.

1076
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:11,987
That is how they built this city.

1077
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,948
They have machines buried deep
beneath the surface...

1078
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:18,952
that allow them
to focus their telepathic energies.

1079
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,247
They control everything here,
even the sun.

1080
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,667
That's why it's always dark.
They can't stand the light.

1081
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,960
So why do they need you?

1082
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:31,381
When they first brought us here,
they extracted what was in us.

1083
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:35,260
So they could store the information,
remix it like so much paint...

1084
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:37,846
and give us back new memories
of their choosing.

1085
01:23:37,929 --> 01:23:41,558
But they still needed an artist
to help them.

1086
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:46,521
I understood the intricacies
of the human mind...

1087
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:49,065
better than they ever could...

1088
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:51,860
so they allowed me
to keep my skills as a scientist...

1089
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:53,319
because they needed them.

1090
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:55,864
But they made me
delete everything else.

1091
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:02,245
Ah! Ah!

1092
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:07,042
Can you imagine what
it is like being forced...

1093
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,793
to erase your own past?

1094
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:12,213
What about my past?
What about my childhood?

1095
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,842
Shell Beach, Uncle Karl.

1096
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:17,886
What about this?

1097
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,638
This was blank when I found it!

1098
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,724
You still don't understand, John.

1099
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:25,935
You were never a boy...
not in this place.

1100
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:28,772
Your entire history is an illusion,
a fabrication...

1101
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,690
as it is with all of us.

1102
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:33,234
You made those drawings
happen with your gift.

1103
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:35,195
You say they brought us here.

1104
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:38,156
From where?

1105
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:42,994
I'm sorry.

1106
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,830
I don't remember.

1107
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,665
None of us remember that...

1108
01:24:48,374 --> 01:24:49,918
what we once were...

1109
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:52,378
what we might have been...

1110
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:53,838
somewhere else.

1111
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:13,233
I've taken you this far.

1112
01:25:13,316 --> 01:25:15,401
You don't need me anymore.

1113
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,278
Let's go.

1114
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,298
John.

1115
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:04,159
There is no ocean, John.

1116
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:08,329
There is nothing beyond the city.

1117
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:11,749
The only place home exists...

1118
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:15,587
is in your head.

1119
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:25,638
No! No!

1120
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,515
John, stop!

1121
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:31,227
No!

1122
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:35,231
Stop!

1123
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,113
Please!

1124
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:44,157
No!

1125
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:48,661
- Aah!
- Uhh!

1126
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,802
And now you know the truth.

1127
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:21,527
Aaah!

1128
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:23,029
Aah!

1129
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:25,365
No!

1130
01:27:25,448 --> 01:27:26,491
Aah!

1131
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:27,951
Aaaah!

1132
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:16,291
You'll allow yourself
to surrender, Mr. Murdoch...

1133
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:18,543
or it will result in
this one's death, yes?

1134
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:21,129
What do I care?
She's not my real wife!

1135
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:22,297
She's nothing to me!

1136
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:26,551
But you do still care,
don't you, Mr. Murdoch?

1137
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,262
You see, I have
become the monster...

1138
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:31,306
you were intended to be.

1139
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:33,057
Uhh!

1140
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:37,061
Shall I end her life now
as you would have?

1141
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,275
Don't hurt her, please!

1142
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:46,946
Then surrender, Mr. Murdoch.

1143
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,656
Sleep.

1144
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:52,702
Now.

1145
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:56,205
John?

1146
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:12,388
Sleep.

1147
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:37,121
The doctor was right.
He has evolved.

1148
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:38,956
Kill him.

1149
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,708
Kill him!
Kill him!

1150
01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:47,548
Kill him! Kill him!

1151
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:52,720
He is powerful, yes.

1152
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:57,225
Dangerous. But he can also
lead us to what we seek.

1153
01:29:57,308 --> 01:30:00,645
What the doctor calls the soul.

1154
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:04,399
It is time for our experiment
to move into a final phase.

1155
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:07,151
We no longer need
the other subjects.

1156
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:10,822
The time for study is over.

1157
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:15,118
It is time to be one
with John Murdoch.

1158
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,584
It is time, Doctor.

1159
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,211
Imprint.

1160
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:30,716
Shut it down!

1161
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,970
Shut it down forever!

1162
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:50,069
What are you doing?

1163
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:54,699
They want to imprint you
with their own collective memories.

1164
01:30:56,033 --> 01:31:00,163
They want to make you one of them,
so they can share your soul.

1165
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:08,588
Imprint, Doctor.
No more disobedience.

1166
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:10,465
I'm sorry, John.

1167
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,551
The pain will only last a moment.

1168
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:16,637
No!

1169
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:26,355
Remember, John.

1170
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:29,525
You'll rise to greater
heights than that, my boy.

1171
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:31,402
One day when you're older,
you'll understand.

1172
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,489
Remember.

1173
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:35,531
[Whistle]

1174
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:38,409
That's it, John.
Practice makes perfect.

1175
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,662
SCHREBER: Now remember
what I told you. Never talk to strangers.

1176
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:43,498
John, remember.

1177
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:46,375
You're probably wondering why I keep
appearing in your memories.

1178
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:48,961
It is because I have
inserted myself in them.

1179
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:51,088
All of these memories
have been fabricated...

1180
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:52,840
to teach you about the strangers.

1181
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:56,052
Give you a lifetime of knowledge
in a single syringe.

1182
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:01,224
You will survive, John.

1183
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:03,559
You will find strength
within yourself...

1184
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:05,561
and you will prevail.

1185
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:06,979
Remember.

1186
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:08,731
YOUNG JOHN: Hi, Uncle Karl.

1187
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:09,815
Johnny!

1188
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:14,862
You're getting the hang of it, John.

1189
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:16,989
Maybe one day
I'll be working for you.

1190
01:32:17,823 --> 01:32:20,993
This is the machine the strangers use
to amplify their thoughts.

1191
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:22,912
The machine
that changes their world.

1192
01:32:22,995 --> 01:32:24,497
You must take control of it.

1193
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,165
You must make the machine yours.

1194
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:28,334
I know you can beat them, John.

1195
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:30,920
But you must concentrate.

1196
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,215
Something's wrong.

1197
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:40,513
Aah!

1198
01:32:42,848 --> 01:32:45,560
There is no time for romance, John.

1199
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:47,937
The world can be what you make it.

1200
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:49,981
What have you done?

1201
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:52,567
You have the power
to make anything happen...

1202
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,151
but you must act now!

1203
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:16,525
- Ahhhhh!
- Ahhhhhh!

1204
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:18,944
Ahhhhh!

1205
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:39,256
- Aaaahhh!
- Aaaah!

1206
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:57,900
Aah!

1207
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:16,168
Aah!

1208
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:23,676
Aah!

1209
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:27,388
Aah!

1210
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,351
- Aah!
- Aah!

1211
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:43,464
Raah!

1212
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:47,885
Aah!

1213
01:37:21,043 --> 01:37:23,963
[Shrill scream]

1214
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:40,437
I knew you could do it, John.

1215
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:42,523
You have their power now.

1216
01:37:42,606 --> 01:37:44,400
You control their machines.

1217
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:45,901
Where's Emma?

1218
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:49,405
She is not Emma anymore, John.

1219
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:50,865
She has been reimprinted.

1220
01:37:50,948 --> 01:37:52,575
So give her back her memories.

1221
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:55,077
I can't. The facility
where the strangers...

1222
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:58,080
stored the memories
has been destroyed.

1223
01:37:58,163 --> 01:38:00,291
I'm sorry.

1224
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:03,085
What are you going to do now, John?

1225
01:38:04,837 --> 01:38:08,632
You told me I had
the power, didn't you?

1226
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:11,510
I can make these machines
do anything I want.

1227
01:38:13,178 --> 01:38:15,514
Make this world anything
I want it to be.

1228
01:38:16,515 --> 01:38:19,560
Just so long as I concentrate
hard enough.

1229
01:39:44,436 --> 01:39:45,813
DR. SCHREBER:
Where are you going?

1230
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:50,234
Shell Beach.

1231
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:32,484
- What's the fare?
- Quarter.

1232
01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:39,700
Oh, please.

1233
01:40:39,783 --> 01:40:42,244
- Oh, no--
- It's fine.

1234
01:40:42,327 --> 01:40:43,746
- Thank you.
- OK.

1235
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:25,829
MR. HAND: John...

1236
01:41:29,374 --> 01:41:31,543
Been waiting for you, yes?

1237
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:33,337
What are you doing?

1238
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,757
I'm just making a few little changes
around here, is all.

1239
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:38,550
Are we sure that's what we want?

1240
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:41,470
I'm prepared to take my chances.

1241
01:41:41,553 --> 01:41:42,971
I'm dying, John.

1242
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:46,058
Your imprint is not
agreeable with my kind.

1243
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:49,770
But I wanted to know
what it was like...

1244
01:41:51,146 --> 01:41:52,606
how you feel.

1245
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:55,317
You know how I was
supposed to feel.

1246
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:59,154
That person isn't me.
Never was.

1247
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:02,950
You wanted to know what it was
about us that made us human.

1248
01:42:04,326 --> 01:42:07,663
Well, you're not going
to find it...in here.

1249
01:42:09,414 --> 01:42:12,042
You went looking
in the wrong place.

1250
01:43:50,432 --> 01:43:52,351
It's so beautiful here.

1251
01:43:57,689 --> 01:43:59,149
So bright.

1252
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:07,824
Do you know if Shell Beach
is around here?

1253
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:10,535
I think that's it just over there.

1254
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:30,764
I'm headed that way myself.

1255
01:44:32,724 --> 01:44:34,726
Would you like to join me?

1256
01:44:36,895 --> 01:44:37,896
Sure.

1257
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:45,904
I'm Anna, by the way.

1258
01:44:45,988 --> 01:44:48,240
- What's your name?
- John.

1259
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:52,119
John Murdoch.

1260
01:49:40,699 --> 01:49:44,536
# When marimba rhythms
start to play #

1261
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:47,122
# Dance with me #

1262
01:49:47,205 --> 01:49:49,749
# Make me sway #

1263
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:54,129
# Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore #

1264
01:49:54,212 --> 01:49:56,256
# Hold me close #

1265
01:49:56,339 --> 01:49:59,301
# Sway me more #

1266
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:03,471
# Like a flower
bending in the breeze #

1267
01:50:03,555 --> 01:50:05,807
# Bend with me #

1268
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:08,810
# Sway with ease #

1269
01:50:08,893 --> 01:50:13,148
# When we dance
you have a way with me #

1270
01:50:13,231 --> 01:50:15,150
# Stay with me #

1271
01:50:15,233 --> 01:50:18,069
# Sway with me #

1272
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:22,866
# Other dancers may be on the floor #

1273
01:50:22,949 --> 01:50:27,621
# Dear, but my eyes will see only you #

1274
01:50:27,704 --> 01:50:32,334
# Only you have that
magic technique #

1275
01:50:32,417 --> 01:50:37,005
# When we sway I go weak #

1276
01:50:37,088 --> 01:50:41,009
# I can hear the sound of violins #

1277
01:50:41,092 --> 01:50:46,348
# Long before it begins #

1278
01:50:46,431 --> 01:50:50,518
# Make me thrill
as only you know how #

1279
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:56,691
# Sway me smooth, sway me now #

1280
01:50:56,775 --> 01:51:01,863
# Sway me now #

1281
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:07,952
# Sway me smooth #

1282
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:49,506
