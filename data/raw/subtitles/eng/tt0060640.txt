[Crusoe] Okay, how about some food?

71

[narrator] Each kit holds six tins
of concentrated food tablets,

72
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,937
each unit roughly the
nutritional equivalent of...

73
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,941
- ...a Thanksgiving turkey dinner.
- [Crusoe] Hmm.

74
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,474
[narrator] First, however,
a word of warning.

75
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,386
Take no more
than one tablet of each...

76
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,220
Or they'll hang in your chest
like a lead balloon.

84
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,577
Put a shopping bag on your head.
That's no good.

85

No... [hiccups] No shopping bag.

86
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,580
What else?

87
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,591
Frighten yourself. All right.

88
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,758
Look out! There's an octopus
in the boat!

89
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,832
There's another one.

90
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,562
What else? Stand on your head
and hold your breath.

91
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,703
Okay, l'll stand on my head
in the middle of the ocean.

92
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,221
l don't think this is gonna... work.

Hey, sail! Ahoy!

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,525
Over here, sail!

96
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,504
Looks like a Chinese junk.
Hey! Here! American!

Hey! Hurry up!
Chop-chop!

Oh, nice Chinese sailor

Hey! Hey, over here, sailboat!

100
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,416
You're not a sailboat!

101
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,480
You're a shark.
You're a shark!

102
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,186
Hey! No, go back! Go back!

103
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,559
No! Get out of here! Whoa!

104
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,069
[narrator] Sharks are all
cowards at heart.

105
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,868
Chances are, a well-placed blow
on the sensitive area around his nose

106
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,135
will send him packing.

107
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,837
A blow on the nose?
You gotta be kidding.

108
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,779
[narrator] A well-placed
blow on the nose.

109
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,986
Okay. Come and get
your well-placed blow.

110
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,051
Ah!

111
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,494
Oh!

112
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,969
This isn't in the manual,
but come and get it.

113
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,847
[laughing]

114
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:21,649
Well-placed blow on the nose, huh?
Put that in your manual next time.

115
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,315
[squeaking]

116
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,414
Ah!

117
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,426
[hiccups]

118
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,155
Ah!

119
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,393
[hiccups]

120
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,358
Ah!

121
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,403
[Crusoe] And that, dear Jane,

122
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,532
is how I discovered a new way
to get rid of the hiccups.

123
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,140
The final leak was patched,

124
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,975
and after a certain amount
of twisting and turning,

125
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,073
I managed to fall asleep.

126
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,391
[scratching]

127
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,771
[scratching]

128
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:58,042
[Crusoe] Everything might have been all
right if it wasn't for my old problem,

129
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,276
sleepwalking.

130
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,062
You come back,
you get more of the same!

131
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,347
[Crusoe] Now I was in real trouble.

132
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,852
Everything, food, water,

133
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,014
everything I needed
to sustain life was gone.

134
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,161
Four days later.

135
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,205
No food. No water.

136
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,935
The sun beat down relentlessly.

137
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,034
Even the shark had run out on me.

138
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,545
Not a sign of life anywhere.

139
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,321
[narrator] If you should run out
of provisions, don't panic.

140
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:13,290
Man has been known to live
over 70 days without food.

141
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,294
However, and mark this well,

142
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,557
man does require water.

143
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,624
More than four days without water,

144
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:26,501
and the human machine
will find itself in extreme difficulty.

145
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,354
[thunder]

146
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,560
Water.

147
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,368
Water.

148
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,136
Hey. Hey. Rain.

149
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:07,009
Soak it up.
Hey! Hey, rain!

150
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,411
[laughing] Rain! Rain!

151
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:13,781
Save the rain! Beautiful rain!

152
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,821
l've got rain!

153
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,516
l've got beautiful rain!

154
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,582
Hey, save the beautiful rain.

155
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,286
l'm sinking!

156
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,488
Get rid of the beautiful rain!

157
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,329
Get rid of the rain!
Get rid of the rain!

158
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,892
- [people chattering]
- Hey.

159
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,379
[chuckling] You'll have to excuse
my appearance.

160
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,819
l had a rough night.

161
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,858
l must look a sight.

162
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,988
[narrator] Chapter 10:
Alone on an Island.

163
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,547
Well, we made it, didn't we?

164
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,025
So knock off lying there, mister,
and move it.

165
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,460
Lots of things to do. Upsa-daisy.

166
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,293
[narrator's voice muffled]

167
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,567
Shut up!

168
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:18,939
[Crusoe] Once I made my plight known
to the outside world, I felt better.

169
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,509
The next most pressing thought:
Where was I?

170
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,851
I made a crude sextant and took
a noon sight on the sun.

171
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:39,625
According to my calculations,
l am somewhere between...

172
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,998
...Elmira, New York,
and Muncie, lndiana.

173
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,237
[Crusoe] Night was coming on now.

174
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,509
With palm fronds and sticks
and my poncho from the dinghy,

175
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,050
I built a snug little shelter.

176
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,630
Oh, boy, am l looking forward
to a good night's sleep.

177
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,599
[grunts]

178
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,262
Well, as Confucius say,

179
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,140
"When in soup,
might as well enjoy flavor."

180
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,701
Boy. Too much!

181
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,084
[thunder]

182
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,727
Oh.

183
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,903
No! Ow!

184
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,902
Ooh!

185
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,306
[Crusoe] The days began to pass.

186
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,682
Still not a glimpse
of a plane or a ship.

187
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,687
Not a sign of life anywhere,

188
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,724
save for birds and small animals.

189
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,750
Trying to conserve my old clothes
before they became hopeless tatters,

190
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,662
I fashioned new ones
out of the materials at hand.

191
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,894
Nothing pretentious.
A warm-weather ensemble.

192
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:27,234
Pleated hat of palm.
Anti-sunstroke accessory.

193
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,501
And a jacket
cut along simple lines.

194
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:33,841
A deep, plunging "V" in front
and laced sides.

195
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,095
[bird sounds]

196
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,808
Let's see. May, June, July.

197
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,582
Seven, 1 4, 21 .

198
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,749
Twenty-second,
twenty-third, twenty-fourth.

199
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,884
Another day, another nut.

200
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,931
July 25th.

201
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,966
* Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

202
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,235
* Happy birthday, Lt. Crusoe

203
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,142
* Happy birthday to you *

204
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:45,747
[bird calling]

205
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,919
[Crusoe] Driven by loneliness
and curiosity,

206
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,355
I resolved to explore
this lonely island.

207
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,416
If it was an island.

208
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,233
Still no sign of another human being.

209
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,611
It was almost as if I were
the first person on Earth.

210
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,562
I guess I always knew
it would happen someday.

211
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,862
Dear, you never knew my father.
His name was Joe Crusoe.

212
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,495
Pop was a frustrated streetcar motorman
back in Kansas City, Kansas,

213
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,971
who always wanted to run away to sea.

214
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,443
He never made it, but he stuck me
with the name Robinson.

215
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:51,210
Why couldn't Dad
have named me Dwight or Lyndon?

216
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,206
It was indeed an island.

217
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,750
Now I knew for certain.

218
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,751
I was alone.

219
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,480
I took a new direction homeward,

220
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,958
coming upon a part of the shore
that was unknown to me.

221
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,428
At first I paid scant attention

222
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,432
because I was too busy
feeling sorry for myself.

223
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,162
Then I saw it.

224
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,319
[creaking]

225
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,501
Hello?

226
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:31,133
Hello!

227
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,005
War over.

228
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:38,504
Me... Me friend
of Sessue Hayakawa.

229
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,019
Okay?

230
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,167
Hello?

231
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,175
Anybody here?

232
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,484
Boop. Boop.

233
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,053
Boop. Boop.

234
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,964
[chuckles]

235
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,298
l've always wanted to do this.

236
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,037
Boop-boop-boop.
Boop-boop-boop.

237
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,902
Ow.

238
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,393
Hello!

239
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,692
[heartbeat]

240
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:49,733
[clatter]

241
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,442
[scratching]

242
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,881
[shudders]

243
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,375
[footsteps]

244
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,434
What? Oh, l... Hello.

245
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,276
[chuckling] Oh. That's ...

246
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,344
Hello there.

247
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:10,650
[stammering] Captain Nemo,
l presume, huh?

248
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,118
You probably never read
20,000 Leagues Under the...

249
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,821
l sure admire that gun you got there.

250
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,330
That could blow a hole
big enough to...

251
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,826
[stammering]
Mind if l have a look at it?

252
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,366
- lt's not an American-made...
- [gunshot]

253
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,434
- [ricocheting]
- [shattering]

254
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,747
[shrieking, whimpering]

255
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,453
Well, there, there, buddy.
lt's okay now.

256
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,719
Hey, listen.
How'd you get here anyway?

257
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,056
Listen, who are you?

258
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,196
Huh?

259
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,094
A fellow American!

260
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:05,369
Oh, boy. lf you only knew
how glad l am to see you.

261
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,843
What's this?

262
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,375
" Astro-Chimp Floyd?

263
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:18,218
Project Mercury.
Discoverer of bearer

264
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,520
please notify Navy Department,
Washington, D.C."

265
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,687
An astro-chimp.

266
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,890
Well, sir, let me tell you
what an honor it is to meet you.

267
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,731
ln my book, you're one of
the great heroes of our time.

268
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,965
Hey, mind if l look around in here?

269
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,097
[Crusoe] Of course he couldn't answer.

270
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,438
But I could almost
figure it out for myself.

271
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,946
It was years since the chimp program
on space probes was phased out.

272
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,447
Floyd probably landed
out of recovery range,

273
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,450
floated to shore
in a space capsule,

274
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,986
broken out and managed
somehow to survive.

275
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,988
After all, why shouldn't he survive?

276
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,149
Floyd wasn'tjust any animal.

277
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:59,094
The Navy selected these creatures
for their high degree of adaptability.

278
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,827
As I recall, the IQs of those
astro-chimps compared favorably...

279
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,199
with those of your average
naval ensign.

280
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,797
Oh, boy!

281
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:12,036
A Japanese supermarket!

282
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,319
Wait a minute.
Let's not lose our heads here.

283
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,588
l don't need comic books.
l don't need the gas mask either.

284
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,687
l don't need...
whatever that is.

285
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:38,566
Now, let's do it the way Robinson Crusoe
did it hundreds of years ago.

286
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,605
Still makes sense.
You take things off the ship

287
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,368
in the order of their importance.

288
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:48,037
A storm could take the boat right off
the reef and sink it in deep water.

289
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,013
Tools. Need plenty of tools.

290
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,312
Candles. Blankets.

291
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,818
Oh, can l use blankets.

292
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,755
Gosh, these little Japanese houses
are sure cute.

293
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,759
They're simple, too.

294
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:11,165
Hey, Floyd, l'll bet we could
build one of them.

295
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,170
Let's see.

296
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,507
[Crusoe] We stripped the submarine
of tools and materials,

297
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:21,238
and borrowing somewhat from
the Tinker Toy school of architecture,

298
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,644
we finished in a couple of weeks.

299
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,377
It looked a little like
a doll house with a hangover,

300
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,749
but we were proud of it.

301
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,948
We now have

302
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,890
a new addition

303
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,927
to the household.

304
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,864
A little mynah bird came by

305
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,892
while we were finishing the house,

306
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:51,067
and it seems he has
attached himself to us.

307
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,769
[squeaks]

308
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,709
Hello, Jane.

309
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,906
[bird] Hello, Jane.

310
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,678
No, no. Me Rob, you Jane.

311
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,686
[bird] Me Rob, you Jane.

312
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,745
No, let's get this straight.

313
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:07,290
Jane. Jane. Get that?

314
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,825
Remember? Jane.

315
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:12,329
[bird] Remember? Jane.
Remember? Jane.

316
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,230
Never mind.
We'll work on it later.

317
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,461
Oh, Floyd, that's very pretty.

318
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,730
Just put it over here.
Anyplace is all right.

319
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,897
Very pretty!

320
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,776
l must close now, sweetheart,

321
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:33,806
as l want to catch the outgoing tide.

322
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,981
l'll be writing every day now.

323
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,819
All my love, Rob.

324
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,558
[bird] Remember? Jane.
Remember? Jane.

325
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,726
You bet your beady little black eyes
l'll remember Jane.

326
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,771
That girl is one in a million.

327
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,772
Be back in a minute, Floyd.

328
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,741
- l'm gonna go down to mail a letter.
- [bird] Remember? Jane.

329
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,890
Onward, O missive of love,

330
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,426
through wind and rain
and sleet and snow.

331
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,191
The mail must go through.

332
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,803
All right. l'll call you.

333
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,469
Let me see you beat
three pretty little geishas.

334
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,011
All right.

335
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:20,114
All right. Three samurai beat
three geishas. Go on. Take them.

336
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,422
- [bird] Oh, boy.
- Shut up.

337
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,825
[bird] Shut up. Deal.

338
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,091
Go play a game of skill
with a dumb animal.

339
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,601
[bird] Shut up and deal.
Shut up and deal.

340
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,370
Have l got a surprise for you
come Thanksgiving.

341
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,378
Shut up and deal!

342
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:52,220
l wonder what this stuff is
we got off the submarine.

343
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,554
Look like some kind of
Japanese soft drink.

344
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,822
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

345
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:10,166
lt's not bad.

346
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,641
Kumquat cola or something.

347
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:17,944
[bird] Oh, boy!

348
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,052
A little for you
and a little for me.

349
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,651
Okay, buddy boy. Here we go.
l deal again.

350
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,872
Okay. l open for two clams.

351
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:55,317
And for Pete's sake, don't go ape with
the betting. lt always spoils the game.

352
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,918
Okay, how many cards?

353
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,688
Come on, Floyd.
l'm trying to teach you the game.

354
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,633
A full house.

355
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:16,070
All right. Lucky.

356
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:38,457
[slurring] Watch this one.

357
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:15,329
Come on, Floyd.
Bottoms up. Chug-a-lug.

358
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,067
How many cards?

359
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,071
All right, wise guy.

360
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,352
Okay, wise guy. l'll play these.

361
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,684
And l'll bet them all.

362
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,959
Read them and weep.

363
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,937
Not again.

364
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,939
All right. Take it all.
Go on, take it all!

365
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,445
l hope you're...
l hope you're proud of yourself.

366
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,752
Do you know something,
my fine, hairy young friend?

367
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:11,921
You know something?

368
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,951
You play poker like a woman.

369
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,752
You know why?

370
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,321
A woman doesn't know what cards
she's playing either,

371
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,333
and she always wins.

372
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,928
- And l'll tell you why she always wins.
- [bird] Remember Jane.

373
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:30,496
Remember Jane.

374
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:35,068
Floyd, did l ever show you
a picture of my fiancée?

375
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:42,649
This is the most beautiful creature
in the whole world, Floyd.

376
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,915
lsn't she lovely?

377
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,890
l don't suppose you astro-chimps

378
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,017
ever had a lady friend, huh?

379
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,756
l mean, you just never had one.

380
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:57,096
All that rigorous flight training
and regular... regular hours.

381
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,968
And no dames.
Strict... Strict rules.

382
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,009
Oh, Floyd, she's lovely.

383
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,478
She's in show business,
l see, huh?

384
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,677
Oh, Floyd,
how you must miss her.

385
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,416
Floyd, a toast.

386
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,689
A toast with this delicious
Japanese soft drink.

387
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,765
To our ladies fair,

388
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,994
wherever they are, may be.

389
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:37,136
From their lonely, loyal sailor... boys.

390
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,405
[sniffling]

391
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,847
Floyd, you look terrible.

392
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,287
l better put you two to bed.

393
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,596
You know, you shouldn't
break training like that, Floyd.

394
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,969
Just a minute, Floyd.

395
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,734
You know something, Floyd?

396
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,275
They ought to bottle this stuff.

397
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,071
[both cawing]

398
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,917
Floyd, a toast.

399
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:58,784
To the United States Navy

400
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:02,053
and to the world in general.

401
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,253
Wherever they may be.

402
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,337
[bird] Cock-a-diddle-doodle.

403
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,747
Cock-a-diddle-doodle.

404
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,444
Cock-a-diddle-doodle.

405
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,216
Cock-a-diddle-doodle.

406
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,248
Cock-a-diddle-doodle-dada-diddle.

407
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,385
- Ooh.
- [bird] Cock-a-diddle-doodle.

408
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,827
lt's not " cock-a-diddle-doodle."

409
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:44,197
lt's " cock-a-doodle-do."
"Cock-a-doodle-do."

410
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,499
- How many times do l have to tell you?
- Cock-a-doodle-do!

411
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,864
[bird] Cock-a-doodle-do!

412
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,938
Cock-a-doodle-do!

413
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,740
Cock-a-doodle-do!

414
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,576
Oh, that was a great idea,

415
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,746
training the bird
to be an alarm clock.

416
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,662
[whistles]

417
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:33,780
Kumquat cola.

418
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,375
Ah.

419
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,591
Why don't you lead off.
You go off first.

420
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,695
Here.

421
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,845
Now, remember, keep your head...
Watch your grip.

422
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,514
No, that's all wrong.
You lifted your head...

423
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,620
Nice shot.
Lousy form and a nice shot.

424
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:18,689
Sometimes it's just luck.

425
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,136
Oh, don't get funny.

426
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:53,486
Japanese clubs are a little
short for me, Floyd.

427
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,252
[groans]

428
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,148
That's a great lie, that is.

429
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,285
Right in the middle of a footprint.

430
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,330
Floyd, your footprints
are all over the place.

431
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:31,494
How many times have l told you
to rake over your footprints in a trap?

432
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:35,698
lt's one of the cardinal rules of golf.
You replace your divots and you...

433
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,035
You know something?

434
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,439
That doesn't look like your footprint.

435
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:44,042
Floyd, l'm sorry. lt's one of mine.
Look at this.

436
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:54,053
Actually, it's a little...
little small for mine, isn't it?

437
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,157
Floyd, we're not alone.

438
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,866
Come on!

439
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,371
Stay close to me, Floyd.

440
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,449
Why did it get so quiet
all of a sudden?

441
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,701
Come on. Let's go.

442
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:22,205
That means everybody, sailor.
Come on!

443
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,051
See, Floyd? lt's all right.

444
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,495
Just an ordinary dark,
terrifying cave.

445
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:10,381
- Ah!
- Ah!

446
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,729
Be careful!
You're gonna hurt somebody!

447
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,513
Ow! Ow! Ow!

448
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,314
Now, listen.

449
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:45,377
Just calm down.

450
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,315
l'm not gonna hurt you.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

451
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,928
That's it.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

452
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:56,056
No, wait. Don't , don't . Hey!

453
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,837
Don't stand there, you dumb ape.
We're not playing.

454
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,785
[straining] What is the matter with you?

455
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,655
[panting] All right.
Now, l turn you loose,

456
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,288
you gonna be good?

457
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,959
All right.

458
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,366
Now, just stay calm.

459
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,508
See? See?

460
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,170
Nothing to be upset about.

461
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,475
Just be calm.

462
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,482
That's it.

463
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,783
All nice. Nice, now.

464
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,185
That's all right.

465
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,452
Me trust.
All smiles. See teeth?

466
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,960
Boy, you know something?
You're as strong as a man.

467
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,702
Doggone it! Watch it!
What's the matter with you?

468
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,100
Ow! Ow! Quit!

469
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,937
[Crusoe] So here, my dear,
was the dilemma.

470
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,947
I couldn't turn her loose.

471
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:22,509
Poor, wild thing only seemed to have
this one fixed idea in her mind.

472
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,554
She simply wanted to kill me.

473
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,419
So I had to keep her.
I'm sure you understand.

474
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,654
I had to keep an eye on her
for my own protection.

475
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,760
l sure tied myself a knot there.

476
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,326
There it is.

477
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,005
Okay, now,

478
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,304
no more funny stuff, huh?

479
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,607
There.

480
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,171
See? Your friend Rob no hurt.

481
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,782
You hungry?

482
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,449
Want food?

483
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:02,583
Kau-kau?

484
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,696
You thirsty?
Want water? Drink?

485
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:14,232
[Crusoe] Like all wild things,
I knew sooner or later

486
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,431
she'd respond to
a little human kindness.

487
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,902
Hey! Take it easy!

488
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,881
That's dangerous! Here we go!
Lady, watch it!

489
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:50,839
Okay. We know how to die
in Kansas City.

490
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,569
Just make it quick.

491
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:07,950
Listen, if you don't mind my saying so,
you seem a little erratic.

492
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,621
Hey, what's the matter now?

493
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,570
Hey, what's wrong with you?

494
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,573
What did l do?

495
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,639
You live this island?

496
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,675
You grow up here?

497
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:37,982
Where... Where house?

498
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:41,285
Where you sleep, huh?

499
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:48,058
You come... You come across water?
You paddle on boat here?

500
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,202
You live other island?

501
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,836
You all alone?

502
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,738
Now we're getting somewhere.

503
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,972
You got a father?

504
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:06,277
[Floyd hooting]

505
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:10,017
Will you stay out of this, Floyd?
l'm trying to find out something.

506
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,951
[hoots]

507
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,990
l've been around that chimp too long.

508
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:19,684
Who is your father?
Your father fisherman?

509
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,731
Father fish?

510
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,733
Father raise coconut?

511
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:28,828
Father have trading post?

512
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,703
Make boats.
Father make boats?

513
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,508
Your father's a monkey?

514
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,313
Father's a...

515
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,409
A chief, huh?
Father chief! Oh, yeah.

516
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,613
Big chief. Yeah.

517
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,783
ls he a nice fella?

518
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,223
He not nice fella.

519
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,032
Him, uh, maybe cannibal?

520
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,228
You know, uh, cannibal.

521
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,563
That's good.

522
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,679
She says her father's a headhunter.

523
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,922
Why you come this island?

524
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,099
You... Yeah, you father.

Marry! You marry.

528

Yeah. You marry,

529
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,848

530
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:56,323
And he's ugly. Yeah.
Ugly guy from other island.

531
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,055

00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,195
He gets paid for this.
He gets money.

535
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,535
You... You say no.

536
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,700
You say big no.

537
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:15,040
You say no.

538
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:18,376
You want to marry...

539
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,440
You want to marry the chimp?

540
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,452
You want to marry...

541
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,853
Tall. Tall. Big. Yeah.

542
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:29,824
Big fella that smiles a lot.

543
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,485
A lot of teeth.

544
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,855
But wait.

545
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,092
You father,

546
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,136
he send you

547
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,637
to seagulls.

548
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:46,540
No, send you to the... the sharks.

549
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,510
l got that. Yeah. But wait.

550
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,514
Father...

551
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,852
...changed his head.

552
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,617
Changed his mind!
Father changed his mind. Yeah?

553
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,750
He paddled you

554
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,887
to this island. Well, why?

555
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:12,032
He bring you to see...

556
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,297
...a big...

557
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,773
...Frankenstein.

558
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:22,369
No, you see the big, green giant.

559
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,608
Turn you into stone.

560
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:28,310
No. Kabuna. Kabuna.

561
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,946
- Who's Kabuna?
- Kabuna evil god of island.

562
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:34,956
Kill, kill! Big hoo! All finish up.

563
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,686
The big stone face
where l found you, huh?

564
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,628
Well, why didn't you say...
You speak English.

565
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:44,861
Oh, yes. Speak English
plenty great. Fluently.

566
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:48,836
Why keep it a secret? We wouldn't
have had to go through that other stuff.

567
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:53,467
l like other stuff.
Good game. A joy for me.

568
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:57,411
Most time l catch sad life.
Must make up good things.

569
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,710
You make up things, huh?

570
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:03,844
Like about your father a bad chief
and sending you here to die.

571
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,718
Oh, no. All true.
Father all bad.

572
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,623
Throw all wives, noisy daughters
kau-kau to shark.

573
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,990
Laugh. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

574
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:16,088
- Wait. His own wives and daughters?
- Why not? Got plenty left.

575
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:19,294
- And he brought you here to die?
- Yes.

576
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:21,803
Kabuna get me.
Kill, kill. Mash, mash.

577
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:23,600
l die or finish up.

578
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:24,662
Oh, for...

579
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,904
Just because you won't marry
some dumb cluck!

580
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,673
A woman should have the right
to marry whom she wants.

581
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:32,271
- Woman got what?
- Rights.

582
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,942
What's a matter word, " rights" ?

583
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:39,785
Well, it's something women have where
l come from. They do what they want.

584
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,118
[chuckles] Father be crossing coconut,

585
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,128
he hear you sing out this " rights."

586
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:49,723
Well, l'm not looking forward
to meeting your father.

587
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,927
- He not come along this side?
- No.

588
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:56,733
Oh, good. Heart belong
me tick-tock much better.

589
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:01,004
l don't like to knock somebody else's
family, but your father sounds like...

590
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,136
He not fright me.

591
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:06,876
l'll tell you something.
He fright me. Mm-hmm.

592
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:10,647
Boy, what am l gonna do with you?

593
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,085
Nothing can do.

594
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,986
Father and Kabuna work together.

595
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,991
Plenty smart.

596
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,117
Anyway, you stay here tonight.

597
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:26,234
Oh, everything's okay.
l'll sleep outside.

598
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,466
Everything's okay.
l'm practically married.

599
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,976
Wait a minute. Here, l'll show you
a picture of my girl.

600
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,008
There. Look at that.

601
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,444
Beautiful, isn't she?

602
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,143
Eew. Looks sick.

603
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,447
Where girl color go?

604
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,216
Well, she's what we call a blond.

605
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:49,053
They have more fun, you know.

606
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,619
Floyd.

607
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,720
Now, don't worry.

608
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,197
l'll leave Floyd here to guard you.

609
00:58:57,267 --> 00:59:01,533
You got the picture, Floyd?
l am appointing you official protector.

610
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:06,268
Nobody, l repeat, nobody gets in here
to bother that young lady tonight.

611
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,382
And that includes me.

612
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,013
Good night.

613
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:41,266
Jane would be proud of me.

614
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:44,677
Takes character to walk away
from a beautiful native girl like that.

615
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:05,528
l guess at heart l'm just a good,
wholesome kid.

616
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,866
Good and wholesome, stupid kid.

617
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:18,136
Hammock doesn't look too big to me.

618
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:34,155
[thunder]

619
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:58,510
Don't tell me it's gonna...

620
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:01,185
Aw!

621
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:05,921
- [thunder]
- [wind howling]

622
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,589
Aw, nuts!

623
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:18,164
Oh, hi, boy. Thattaboy.
That's the way to stand a watch.

624
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,572
What...

625
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:22,406
Cut the clowning, Floyd.
lt's just me! Come...

626
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,345
Look, stupid,

627
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,975
l just wanna get a blanket
because it's raining!

628
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,315
l'm not going in there to stay.
Come on!

629
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:35,117
Floyd, have a heart.
l'm freezing out here.

630
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:38,024
All l wanna do
is get that blanket there.

631
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,358
Go on, Floyd! Please!

632
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:45,192
lf that isn't typical. You give a chimp
authority, he'll wanna take over.

633
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:51,902
Thanks a lot!
l'd like to put you back in orbit.

634
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,049
Dumb monkey.

635
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:15,555
[tearing]

636
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:59,736
But, after the fight was over,
we came to terms.

637
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,743
And so, my dear,

638
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:07,340
that's how your very own
Lt. Robin Crusoe

639
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,351
met his Man Friday.

640
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:15,256
Except she was a girl.

641
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:19,556
l named her "Wednesday."

642
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,563
Wednesday.

643
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,794
Don't get the idea

644
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,768
she's one of those

645
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,738
gorgeous island girls.

646
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:31,831
lsland.

647
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:35,935
She's just a plain little thing,
actually.

648
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:51,550
You write scritch-scratch a lot her?

649
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:54,494
Yes, twice a day.

650
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,158
- What her name?
- Who?

651
01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:00,293
- Remember Jane.
- l remember Jane. Jane!

652
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:04,669
That's her name. Jane.
She's a real lovely little lady.

653
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:09,734
Dear Jane. Dear Jane.

654
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,373
Anyway,

655
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:18,511
the real problem isn't Wednesday.

656
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,954
lt's Tanamashu,

657
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:26,290
that old headhunter father of hers.

658
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,456
Meantime, all my love.

659
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:33,059
Hurriedly, Rob.

660
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,800
[bird] Remember Jane.
Remember Jane.

661
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,618
[Crusoe] * Go tell Aunt Rhody

662
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,660
* Go tell Aunt Rhody

663
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,425
* Go tell Aunt Rhody
she's really Uncle Fred *

664
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,587
lt's him! Tanamashu!

665
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,094
Wednesday! Wednesday!

666
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,159
Tanamashu's coming!

667
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,703
Your nutty father's here. Come on.
We gotta blow out of here!

668
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,610
Floyd, put down
that silly comic book.

669
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:59,212
We'll hide in the jungle!
Wednesday, where you going?

670
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,253
Give me your hand.
Let's get out of here!

671
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,103
Floyd, come on!

672
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,616
[women chattering indistinctly]

673
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,215
l don't like the looks of this.

674
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,460
Well, l mean, l like the looks of it,

675
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:42,463
but l don't like the looks of it.

676
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:48,528
So?

677
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,365
So let's get outta here!

678
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:01,906
[Crusoe] Come on, Floyd!

679
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,117
Hee-ya!

680
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:41,778
Oh, boy.

681
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,876
[all giggling]

682
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,461
[coughing]

683
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:02,369
- [Crusoe] Who are you?
- Sorry.

684
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:05,464
These are sisters-cousins belong me.

685
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:10,205
Okay, you can tell sisters and cousins
to get out of the way

686
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:13,043
if they don't want to see
an innocent man drown.

687
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:17,381
One moment. Sisters-cousins
all must run for lives!

688
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:18,545
Was all my fault.

689
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:23,120
l not go marriage with ugly,
bad snake island chief.

690
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:26,423
Father catch crazy!
Father plenty cross.

691
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,362
Kill, kill! Big hoo!

692
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:32,366
Begin to throw all daughters-cousins
kau-kau to shark.

693
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,062
l'm drowning!
You gotta believe me.

694
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:38,129
- l'm very sincere.
- One moment!

695
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:41,870
l tell sisters-cousins,
woman got rights!

696
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:47,439
My whole life passing
in front of my eyes!

697
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:51,782
- Woman got rights, you say!
- Okay, okay. Women got rights.

698
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,719
So we not go now.

699
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:57,850
You just said your father's gonna
kau-kau everybody to the sharks.

700
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:01,124
But Father got to catch first.
First we fight!

701
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,563
Fight? Fight?

702
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:06,999
Wednesday, you're out of your mind!
You can't fight.

703
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:08,366
We try.

704
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:10,769
Sisters-cousins fight good,
probably.

705
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:14,339
- You be our chief.
- Me?

706
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,902
Well, chief, admiral, general.
What is word?

707
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,608
The word's " no."

708
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:31,258
[Crusoe] Following a brief period
of brainwashing,

709
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:34,854
I decided to accept their offer
and make the best of it.

710
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,730
[all] * Until we meet once more

711
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:41,361
* We wishing you
a happy voyage home *

712
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:44,167
- [whistle]
- Company, halt!

713
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:51,970
Now hear this!

714
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:57,513
ln my book, there's just one way
to do things, and that is the Navy way.

715
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:04,618
The entire efficiency of a fighting
machine is based on just one thing.

716
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:07,852
Discipline.

717
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:12,589
Discipline, discipline, discipline!

718
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,634
We shape up or ship out!

719
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,903
Let's see if we can form a line
along here.

720
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,501
On the double!

721
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:32,550
All right, ladies. Shape up!

722
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,021
That's enough shaping up.

723
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,523
At ease!

724
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,452
Admiral Honey, they
already at ease, thank you.

725
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:44,693
Feel fine. Like you plenty.

726
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:48,533
That's not what l meant.
Never mind.

727
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:49,729
[giggling]

728
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,467
All right, sailor,
wipe that smile off your face.

729
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:55,408
- l said wipe it off!
- Okay, honey.

730
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:59,243
- You mean " sir."
- Okay, honey, sir.

731
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,779
Smarten up, sailor.
Smarten up.

732
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:09,381
All right, belay that giggling!
Sailors do not giggle!

733
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,449
Well, thank you.

734
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,188
Wait a minute. No.
Wait a minute.

735
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:16,993
Let's not confuse the relationship
between an officer and personnel.

736
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:20,627
Ladies, discipline is very important
here! Come on! Knock it off.

737
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:24,366
Knock it...
Company, dismissed!

738
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:33,938
lt's gonna be a very tough war.

739
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:42,012
- Not much good-looking house.
- That doesn't matter.

740
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:46,187
What's important is that we get our
battle strategy clearly in our minds.

741
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:49,696
Okay, Admiral Honey.
You're boss.

742
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:57,405
Yeah. All right. Where does
Father usually land his canoes?

743
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,735
[Wednesday] Always here.

744
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,370
Always take this path to Kabuna here.

745
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:07,040
What does Father do at Kabuna?

746
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,482
They do good business.

747
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,781
Father stand to Kabuna.

748
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:15,290
Father say, "l, Tanamashu, here.

749
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:18,417
What great god Kabuna
got to say?"

750
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:20,359
And Kabuna say,

751
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:24,559
"You good chief, Tanamashu.
Kabuna like you plenty.

752
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:28,933
Tell people to bring you best fish,
bring you pretty new girls,

753
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,370
throw old wives
kau-kau to shark.

754
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,238
This make Kabuna plenty happy."

755
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:36,903
Sounds a little fishy to me.

756
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:39,407
You mean, people hear
Kabuna say this?

757
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:42,109
Oh, not people. People not hear.

758
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:45,153
Kabuna speak only to Father.
Only Father hear.

759
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:49,247
Oh! Only Father hear, huh?

760
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,884
[chuckling]

761
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,450
l think l know that bit.

762
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:56,093
What's the matter, "bit" ?

763
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:02,597
l may just visit Kabuna myself.

764
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:04,662
l may outsmart Father.

765
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:08,304
You outsmart Father?

766
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,346
Wednesday, all due respect
to your father,

767
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:14,143
but he is, after all, just a savage.

768
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:16,616
On the other hand,
l am graduated with honors

769
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:20,121
from one of the finest technical schools
in the United States.

770
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:23,681
ln all honesty, who do you think
is going to outsmart whom?

771
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,953
Father.

772
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:29,922
You got some other plan,
Admiral Honey?

773
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:33,263
Well, as a last resort,
l mean only as a last resort,

774
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:35,803
we may have to fight,
make a big hoo-hoo.

775
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:39,466
This good type plan. All sisters-cousins
like to make big hoo-hoo!

776
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:44,205
Okay, but remember, we hoo-hoo
only in the case of emergency.

777
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:50,346
Someone may get hurt
if we hoo-hoo,

778
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,478
and l'm afraid l know who.

779
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:55,482
All right, young people.
Get to work.

780
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:57,923
Snap it up! Mm-hmm.

781
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:06,565
Cousin, take topside.
Plenty hurry.

782
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:09,195
- What's the matter this thing?
- Don't know.

783
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,900
Admiral Honey say move it, we move.
Come along, sisters-cousins.

784
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:16,001
On your toes. Gung ho.
Now, move out, move out. Come on.

785
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:25,518
What's the matter this?
Maybe candy stick.

786
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:29,216
- You think?
- Maybe candy. Maybe not.

787
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:33,284
Hey, watch it!
Hey, those are flares.

788
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,296
Explosive.

789
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,389
[explosion sound]

790
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:44,932
Just take them up topside.
Don't fool around.

791
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:48,807
Come along, sisters-cousins.
On your toes! Now, move out! Come on.

792
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:59,951
Well, here goes.

793
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:05,283
[generator turning]

794
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:09,930
Hey! Hey, l did it!
l got the generator working!

795
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,728
Ow! Oh, boy.

796
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:19,466
Stop horsing around!
This thing is dangerous.

797
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,509
Stop it!

798
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,914
Hey, away from the water!
That wire's hot!

799
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:43,523
Sweetie, that line runs back
to the generator.

800
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,090
You step in the water
with the juice turned on,

801
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:48,796
you'll light up like a Roman candle.

802
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:51,202
l mean, you shoot off sparks.

803
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,867
You know, l mean, big smoke.

804
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:57,434
Thank you.
You are pretty nice yourself.

805
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,172
Yeah.

806
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,388
- Hey!
- [chuckles]

807
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:18,493
So far, so good.

808
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:21,627
Like you say, so far, so good.

809
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,694
Yeah...

810
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:25,798
Yeah.

811
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,107
Wednesday, l do not like this.

812
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:36,173
Sisters-cousins take good care
of Admiral Honey.

813
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:39,687
Admirals don't get carried around
on litters by girls.

814
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,689
At least not in wartime.

815
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:45,215
Ladies got to respect,
got to look up to Admiral Honey.

816
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:48,262
Ride in litter, save face.

817
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,562
- Also feet.
- lt's not my face l'm worried about.

818
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,881
Floyd, no, no.

819
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:12,784
Get down from there.

820
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,955
You do it like this.

821
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,993
l always thought you
were the big brain.

822
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,197
- No, you idiot! Stay back!
- [shrieks]

823
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:32,903
Don't get sore at me. Why didn't you
watch what you were doing?

824
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:36,205
Maybe we've learned
a little lesson now.

825
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,013
Yo.

826
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,650
Move it out.

827
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,090
Periscope secure

828
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,397
and working.

829
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:04,405
Now, let's see. Flares.

830
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:07,374
Flares. Twelve cases.

831
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:10,707
Smoke bombs, six.

832
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,974
Oxygen tank, one.

833
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:16,279
Smoke masks. Smoke masks.

834
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:18,285
Two.

835
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:21,288
First-aid kit. First-aid kit. One.

836
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,481
Flamethrower, one.

837
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,464
Okay.

838
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:33,431
And...

839
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:36,938
Fire extinguisher,
carbon-dioxide spray type.

840
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:44,278
Nice effect.

841
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:47,713
Okay, battery packs. Six.

842
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,843
Extra spool of wire,
double-1 4 gauge, two.

843
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:56,016
Water valve installed and working.

844
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,025
And that's about it.

845
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:06,032
[electric feedback]

846
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:12,636
Hello, hello.

How now brown cow.

852
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:33,025
'Round the rugged rock
the ragged rascal ran.

853
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:37,861
Sister Susie sells seashells
by the seashore.

854
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:41,630
Soft. What light
in yon window breaks?

855
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:46,205
[over speaker] It is the east,
and Juliet is the sun.

856
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:49,137
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

857
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:52,339
Would that l were a glove.

858
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:53,881
You read...

859
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:59,653
[chuckling] Sorry, folks.

860
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,712
Kabuna a little hammy there.

861
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,390
Okay.

But he no good.
We give him big squeeze!

875
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:51,729
[Crusoe] Kabuna got to go along
with daughter of Tanamashu.

876
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:53,899
Daughter plenty okay.

877

Kabuna say woman got rights.

878
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:01,377
Woman got rights to talk.

879
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:05,510
Got rights to choose
first-chop fella.

880
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,987
Tanamashu plenty tough?
Okay.

881
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:10,718
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

882

[Crusoe] And that's just about
the way it was, dear.

1205

We had a great reception
on the carrier.

1206
01:52:12,459 --> 01:52:15,087
Of course, it wasn't for me.
It was all for Floyd,

of outer space.

Welcome aboard, lieutenant.

1210

Well, Floyd, l'm delighted
to see you again.

1211
01:52:25,038 --> 01:52:27,336
You must have had
some experience.

1212

l know you're anxious
to hear about the story.

1213
01:52:29,976 --> 01:52:32,171
Later, if you don't mind.
Excuse me.

1214
01:52:32,245 --> 01:52:34,770
Floyd, l've got some people
l want you to meet.

1215
01:52:34,848 --> 01:52:36,577
Then we've got
a lot of things to do.

1216
01:52:36,649 --> 01:52:39,880
[sailor] The president's on the phone,
sir. He wants to talk to him.

1217
01:52:39,953 --> 01:52:43,389
Captain? Sir?
l'd like to give you a full report.

1218
01:52:43,456 --> 01:52:46,619
lt's really an interesting story.
l was flying about 1 6...

1219
01:52:50,463 --> 01:52:53,626
Hey, mister.
That's a pretty good outfit.

1220

- Mind if l send a picture to my girl?
- Go ahead.

1221
01:52:58,838 --> 01:53:01,534
Say, what are you?
Some kind of a hermit?

1222
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:04,577
l'm glad you asked that.
This thing started months ago.

1223
01:53:04,644 --> 01:53:07,511
l was flying along
about 1 6,000 feet, l'd say.

1224
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:10,549
Excuse me. They're taking the chimp.
l want a picture.

1225
01:53:10,617 --> 01:53:12,585
Oh, no. Go ahead.

1226
01:53:20,493 --> 01:53:23,462
[Crusoe] Anyway, dear, that's just
the way it happened.

1227
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:25,157
I'll be home soon.

1228
01:53:25,231 --> 01:53:27,290
