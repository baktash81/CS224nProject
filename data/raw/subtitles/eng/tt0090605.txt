1
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,933
Bio-readouts are in the green.

2
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:01,477
Looks like she's alive.

3
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,274
There goes our salvage, guys.

4
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,928
How are we today?

5
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,930
Oh. Terrible.

6
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:40,182
Better than yesterday, at least.

7
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:41,642
Where am l?

8
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:42,851
You're safe.

9
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:45,938
You're at Gateway Station.
Been here a couple of days.

10
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,441
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're OK.

11
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,652
Looks like you've got a visitor.

12
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:56,407
Jonesy! Come here!

13
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,742
Hey, come here.

14
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:01,453
How are you, you stupid cat?

15
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,163
How are you?

16
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:05,207
Where have you been?

17
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:08,210
Guess you two have met, huh?

18
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,630
I'm Carter Burke.
I work for the Company.

19
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,675
Don't let that fool you.
I'm really an OK guy.

20
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,928
I'm glad you're feeling better.

21
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,932
They tell me the weakness and
disorientation should pass soon.

22
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:24,101
That's just
natural side effects...

23
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:27,563
of such an unusually long
hypersleep.

24
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:29,898
What do you mean?

25
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,276
How long was I out there?

26
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:36,071
Has no one discussed this
with you?

27
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:37,573
No.

28
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:42,870
But, I mean,
I don't recognize this place.

29
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:45,914
No, I know. Uh...OK.

30
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:48,917
This might be a shock.
It's long-

31
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,919
How long?

32
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:52,629
Please.

33
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:56,050
Fifty-seven years.

34
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,385
What?

35
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:02,765
You were out there
for fifty-seven years.

36
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:06,143
You drifted
right through the core systems.

37
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:08,896
It's really just blind luck...

38
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:12,191
that a deep-salvage team
found you.

39
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,401
It's one in a thousand, really.

40
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:16,695
You're damn lucky
to be alive, kiddo.

41
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,530
You could be floating
out there forever.

42
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:21,742
You OK?

43
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:24,828
Oh.

44
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,086
-Oh!

45
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:33,337
You OK?

46
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,720
Oh!

47
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,681
God!

48
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,267
Nurse! Please!

49
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,688
Someone get in here now!

50
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,106
No!

51
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:53,857
Now!

52
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,110
-Hold-
-Please.

53
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:58,445
Hold her.

54
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,489
Kill me!

55
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:10,040
No!

56
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:11,291
No!

57
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:19,425
Bad dreams again?

58
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,051
You want something
to help you sleep?

59
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:22,428
No.

60
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:25,472
I've slept enough.

61
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:28,684
Jonesy.

62
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:30,185
Come here.

63
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,314
Shh.

64
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:39,028
It's all right.

65
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:42,239
It's all right now.

66
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:46,744
It's over.

67
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:14,855
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Been running behind all morning.

68
00:09:14,897 --> 00:09:16,774
Is there
any word about my daughter?

69
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:21,362
Uh...l think we should
worry about the hearing now.

70
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:22,905
We don't have a lot of time.

71
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:24,907
I read your deposition,
and it's great.

72
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:26,659
If you stick to that,
we'll be fine.

73
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,870
The thing is, there are gonna be
a lot of heavyweights in there.

74
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:31,955
Feds, Interstellar
Commerce Commission...

75
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:34,917
Colonial Administration,
insurance company guys.

76
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,711
Do you have any news
about my daughter?

77
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,090
We did come up
with some information.

78
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,384
Why don't we sit down?

79
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:46,387
I was hoping to wait
until after the inquest.

80
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:47,888
Uh...

81
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,518
"Amanda Ripley McClaren-"

82
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,561
married name, I guess-

83
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,397
"age sixty-six."

84
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:59,400
That was at the time
of her death...

85
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:03,237
which was two years ago.

86
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,907
I'm real sorry.

87
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,127
Amy.

88
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,923
She was cremated and interred...

89
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,926
at Westlake Repository,
Little Chute, Wisconsin.

90
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,594
No children. I checked.

91
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,894
I promised her...

92
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,439
that I would be home
for her birthday.

93
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:44,111
Her eleventh birthday.

94
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,408
Ohh...

95
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:53,078
I'd like to
go back to this point...

96
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,164
about the override
destruct elements.

97
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:56,957
I don't understand this.

98
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:00,169
We have been here
three and a half hours.

99
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,756
How many different ways
do you want the same story?

100
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,259
Look at it
from our perspective, please.

101
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,095
Please?

102
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:15,643
You freely admit to
detonating the engines of...

103
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:18,562
and thereby destroying
an M-Class star freighter...

104
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:21,065
a rather expensive piece
of hardware.

105
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:23,567
Forty-two million
in adjusted dollars.

106
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:26,570
That's minus payload, of course.

107
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:28,572
The lifeboat's
flight recorder...

108
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:31,575
corroborates some elements
of your account...

109
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:33,577
in that, for reasons unknown...

110
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:36,413
the Nostromo
set down on LV-426...

111
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:39,083
an unsurveyed planet
at that time...

112
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,085
that it resumed its course...

113
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:44,838
and was subsequently set
for self-destruct by you...

114
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,090
for reasons unknown.

115
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:47,424
Not for reasons unknown.

116
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,676
I told you.

117
00:11:48,717 --> 00:11:52,012
We set down on Company orders
to get this thing...

118
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:57,142
which destroyed my crew
and your expensive ship.

119
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,352
The analysis team...

120
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:00,938
which went over the lifeboat
centimeter by centimeter...

121
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,691
found no physical evidence
of the creature you describe.

122
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:07,903
Good! That's because I blew it
out of the goddamn air lock.

123
00:12:09,571 --> 00:12:10,948
Like I said.

124
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:15,160
Are there any species...

125
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,913
like this hostile organism
on LV-426?

126
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:20,874
No. It's a rock.
No indigenous life.

127
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,213
Did IQs just drop sharply
while I was away?

128
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:28,882
Ma'am, I already said
it was not indigenous.

129
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:31,802
It was a derelict spacecraft.
It was an alien ship.

130
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:33,429
It was not from there.

131
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,473
Do you get it?
We homed in on its beacon.

132
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:39,393
And found something
never recorded once...

133
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:42,438
in over three hundred
surveyed worlds.

134
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:47,776
"A creature that gestates
inside a living human host."

135
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:49,486
These are your words.

136
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,697
"And has concentrated acid
for blood."

137
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:52,823
That's right.

138
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:57,786
Look.
I can see where this is going...

139
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:00,456
but I'm telling you
that those things exist.

140
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:02,541
Thank you, Officer Ripley.
That will be all.

141
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,917
Please! You're not listening.

142
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,544
Kane-the crew member...

143
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:10,424
Kane, who went into that ship,
said he saw thousands of eggs.

144
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:12,509
Thank you. That will be all.

145
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:14,637
God damn it, that's not all!

146
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:17,431
If one of those things gets
down here, that will be all!

147
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:20,809
And all this bullshit
you think is important...

148
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:23,187
you can kiss all that good-bye!

149
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:33,030
It is the finding
of this court of inquiry...

150
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,157
that Warrant Officer
E. Ripley...

151
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,077
N-O-C-one-four-four-seven-two...

152
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:41,205
has acted
with questionable judgment...

153
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:44,249
and is unfit
to hold an ICC license...

154
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,211
as a commercial flight officer.

155
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:50,798
Said license is hereby
suspended indefinitely.

156
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:53,968
No criminal charges...

157
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:56,971
will be filed against you
at this time...

158
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:59,431
and you are released
on your own recognizance...

159
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:02,226
for a six-month period
of psychometric probation...

160
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:07,481
to include monthly review by
an ICC psychiatric technician.

161
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:12,403
These proceedings are closed.

162
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:25,249
That could have been better.

163
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,750
Look, I think-Ripley.

164
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,752
Van Leuwen.

165
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:31,755
Why don't you just
check out LV-426?

166
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:33,757
Because I don't have to.

167
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,427
People have been there
for over twenty years...

168
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:38,971
and they never complained
about any hostile organism.

169
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,973
What people?

170
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:42,683
Terraformers.

171
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,018
Planet engineers.

172
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,395
They go in,
set up atmosphere processors...

173
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,188
to make the air breathable.

174
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,190
It takes decades.

175
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,818
It's what we call
a shake 'n' bake colony.

176
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,488
How many are there?
How many colonists?

177
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,908
I don't know.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.

178
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,118
Do you mind?

179
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:04,913
Families.

180
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,335
Jesus.

181
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,870
I'll be down in maintenance.

182
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:28,872
-Al?
-What?

183
00:16:28,914 --> 00:16:30,457
-Hey, Al.
-What?

184
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,376
Remember you sent
some wildcatters...

185
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:33,627
out in the middle of nowhere
last week...

186
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:35,963
out past the Ilium Range?

187
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:39,258
One's on the horn,
a mom-and-pop survey team.

188
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:41,635
He's onto something,
wants his claim honored.

189
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:43,595
Why wouldn't it be honored?

190
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:47,725
Because you sent them
on Company orders maybe?

191
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:50,853
Christ. Some haunch in
a cushy office on Earth says...

192
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:52,771
"Go look at a grid reference."

193
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:56,108
We look. They don't say why,
and I don't ask...

194
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:59,403
because it takes two weeks
to get an answer out here.

195
00:16:59,445 --> 00:17:01,405
The answer is always,
"Don't ask."

196
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,866
What do I tell this guy?

197
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:07,911
As far as I'm concerned,
if he finds something, it's his.

198
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:09,413
-Lydecker?
-What?

199
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:12,458
You kids know
you're not supposed to be here!

200
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,709
Get out!

201
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,869
You go in places we can't fit.

202
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:51,830
So? That's why I'm the best!

203
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,290
Knock it off.

204
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:56,627
If I catch you playing in the
air ducts, I'll tan your hides.

205
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:58,921
Mom, all the kids play-

206
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:01,507
Wait.
Have a look at this.

207
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,187
Folks,
we have scored big this time.

208
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:23,153
What is it, Dad?

209
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,034
I'm not sure.

210
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:32,830
Let's see if we can't get
a closer look at this thing...

211
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:34,873
maybe through that crack
on the side.

212
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:36,375
Shouldn't we call in?

213
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,877
Let's wait till we know
what to call it in as.

214
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:44,925
That's about as close
as we can get.

215
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:47,594
Should we look inside?

216
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:05,529
You kids stay inside.
I mean it.

217
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:07,031
We'll be right back.

218
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:08,907
OK.
Bye.

219
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:26,652
Huh?

220
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:29,947
Timmy,
they've been gone a long time.

221
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:33,033
It'll be OK.
Dad knows what he's doing.

222
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:35,577
Mayday! Mayday!

223
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:38,497
This is Alpha Kilo Two-four-
niner calling Control!

224
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:41,583
This is
Alpha Kilo Two-four-niner!

225
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:46,005
Aah!

226
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:51,468
Aah!

227
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:28,589
Hiya, Ripley.

228
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:31,759
This is Lieutenant Gorman
of the Colonial Marine Corps-

229
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:35,095
Ripley, we have to talk.

230
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:38,766
We've lost contact
with the colony on LV-426.

231
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:47,608
I don't believe this.

232
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,110
You guys throw me
to the wolves...

233
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:52,529
and now you want me
to go back there?

234
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:55,240
Forget it.
It's not my problem.

235
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:56,742
-Can I finish?
-No.

236
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:58,369
There's no way.

237
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:02,247
You wouldn't be
going in with the troops.

238
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:04,875
I can guarantee your safety.

239
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:07,711
These Colonial Marines
are very tough hombres.

240
00:22:07,753 --> 00:22:10,381
They're packing
state-of-the-art firepower.

241
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:12,841
There's nothing
they can't handle.

242
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,051
Lieutenant, am I right?

243
00:22:14,093 --> 00:22:17,846
We've been trained to deal
with situations like this.

244
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:21,058
Then you don't need me.
I'm not a soldier.

245
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,852
But we don't know
exactly what's going on.

246
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:25,688
It may be a downed transmitter.

247
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:27,982
But if it's not...

248
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:32,152
I'd like you there
as an advisor, and that's all.

249
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:38,200
What's your interest
in all this? Why are you going?

250
00:22:39,243 --> 00:22:41,370
The Corporation co-financed
that colony...

251
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:43,539
along with
Colonial Administration.

252
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,791
We're getting into a lot
of terraforming now...

253
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:46,792
and building better worlds-

254
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:49,378
Yeah. I saw the commercial.

255
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,423
I don't have time for this.
I've got to get to work.

256
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:55,634
Right. I heard you're
working the cargo docks.

257
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,678
That's right.

258
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,221
Running loaders and forklifts.

259
00:22:59,263 --> 00:23:00,597
Yeah. So?

260
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:03,809
Nothing. I think it's great
that you're keeping busy.

261
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:06,312
I know it's the only thing
you could get.

262
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:08,355
There's nothing wrong with it.

263
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:12,568
What would you say
if I told you...

264
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:15,487
I could get you reinstated
as a flight officer?

265
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,573
The Company's already agreed
to pick up your contract.

266
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:20,659
If I go.

267
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:23,495
Yeah, if you go.

268
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,831
Come on.
That's a second chance, kiddo.

269
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,416
I think personally for you...

270
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,377
it would be the best thing
to go and face this thing.

271
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,962
Get back on the horse.

272
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:34,757
Spare me.
I've had my psych evaluation.

273
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:36,717
I know. I've read it.

274
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:39,219
You wake up every night,
soaked in sweat-

275
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:41,263
I said no, and I mean it!

276
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,768
Now please leave.

277
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:46,977
I am not going back...

278
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:50,314
and I would not be
any good to you if I did.

279
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:51,607
OK.

280
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:52,900
Shh.

281
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:57,404
Would you do me a favor?
Just think about it.

282
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,826
Thanks for the coffee.

283
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:17,132
Aah!

284
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,640
Oh.

285
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:13,605
Hello.

286
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,816
Ripley.

287
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:16,984
You OK?

288
00:25:17,026 --> 00:25:20,029
Just tell me one thing, Burke.

289
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,198
You're going out there
to destroy them, right?

290
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,825
Not to study.

291
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:26,785
Not to bring back.

292
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:28,412
But to wipe them out.

293
00:25:28,454 --> 00:25:32,541
That's the plan.
You have my word on it.

294
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:37,004
All right, I'm in.

295
00:25:37,046 --> 00:25:38,255
I think that-

296
00:25:46,722 --> 00:25:48,891
And you, you little shithead...

297
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:51,727
you're staying here.

298
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:26,507
They ain't payin' us
enough for this, man.

299
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:30,970
Not enough to have to
wake up to your face, Drake.

300
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:33,764
What? Is that a joke?

301
00:28:33,806 --> 00:28:35,599
I wish it were.

302
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:39,561
Hey, Hicks.
Man, you look just like I feel.

303
00:28:41,772 --> 00:28:43,607
All right, sweethearts...

304
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:46,235
what are you waiting for,
breakfast in bed?

305
00:28:46,276 --> 00:28:48,028
Another glorious day
in the Corps.

306
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,322
A day in the Marine Corps
is like a day on the farm.

307
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:54,910
Every meal's a banquet,
every paycheck a fortune...

308
00:28:54,952 --> 00:28:56,537
every formation a parade.

309
00:28:56,578 --> 00:28:58,247
I love the Corps!

310
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:00,249
Man, this floor is freezing!

311
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,334
Want me to fetch your slippers?

312
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:04,461
Gee, would you, sir?
I'd like that.

313
00:29:04,586 --> 00:29:06,171
Look into my eye.

314
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:07,756
Fall in, people!

315
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:10,175
Come on, let's go.

316
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:12,177
I hate this job.

317
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:14,722
Crowe, Wierzbowski,
on your feet.

318
00:29:17,683 --> 00:29:20,269
I'm talking about
breathing, not this frozen shit.

319
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:22,104
Yeah, Top, how about it?

320
00:29:25,482 --> 00:29:28,944
First assembly's
in fifteen, people. Shag it.

321
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:33,907
Hey, mira.
Who's Snow White?

322
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:37,244
She's supposed to be
some kind of consultant.

323
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:39,663
Apparently,
she saw an alien once.

324
00:29:39,663 --> 00:29:41,749
Whoopee-fucking-do!

325
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,916
Hey, I'm impressed.

326
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,668
Qué bonita.

327
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:48,380
Hey, Vasquez.

328
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:51,467
Have you ever been
mistaken for a man?

329
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:53,636
No. Have you?

330
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:55,512
Ha ha! Oh, Vasquez.

331
00:29:56,847 --> 00:29:58,515
You're just too bad.

332
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:11,695
Hey, Top, what's the op?

333
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:14,031
A rescue mission.
You'll love it.

334
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,741
There's some juicy
colonists' daughters...

335
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:17,910
we have to rescue
from their virginity.

336
00:30:18,994 --> 00:30:21,246
Dumbass colonists.

337
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:26,710
What's this crap supposed to be?

338
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,712
Cornbread, I think.

339
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:30,714
It's good for you, boy. Eat it.

340
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:34,259
I wouldn't mind getting
more of that Arcturian poontang.

341
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,011
Remember that time?

342
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:39,223
Yeah, but the one
you had was a male.

343
00:30:39,223 --> 00:30:41,558
It doesn't matter
when it's Arcturian.

344
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:44,186
Hey, Bishop,
do the thing with the knife.

345
00:30:44,228 --> 00:30:45,562
Oh, please.

346
00:30:45,562 --> 00:30:48,440
Come on. All right!

347
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:50,442
I don't want to see that.

348
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:52,403
All right!

349
00:30:52,444 --> 00:30:55,531
What are you doing, man?

350
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:57,658
Quit messing around, Drake.

351
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,326
Bishop. Hey, man.

352
00:30:59,368 --> 00:31:01,412
-Do it.
-Hey, not me, man!

353
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:04,039
Yeah, you. Don't move.

354
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:05,374
Trust me.

355
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:18,929
Aah!

356
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:21,056
All right, knock it off.

357
00:31:21,098 --> 00:31:22,308
Thank you.

358
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:27,646
Enjoy your meal.

359
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:29,815
That wasn't funny, man.

360
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:35,612
Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?

361
00:31:35,654 --> 00:31:37,197
Yeah, thanks.

362
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:41,410
Looks like the new lieutenant's
too good to eat with us grunts.

363
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:46,999
Boy's definitely
got a corncob up his ass.

364
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:50,377
I thought you
never missed, Bishop.

365
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:56,884
You never said anything about
an android being on board.

366
00:31:57,926 --> 00:32:00,512
It never occurred to me.

367
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:04,224
It's common practice
to have a synthetic on board.

368
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:06,727
I prefer the term
"artificial person."

369
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:08,687
Right.

370
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:10,272
Is there a problem?

371
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:13,317
I'm sorry. I don't know
why I didn't even...

372
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,985
Ripley's last trip, the syn-

373
00:32:15,027 --> 00:32:16,987
the artificial person
malfunctioned.

374
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:18,238
Malfunctioned?

375
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,950
There were problems,
and a few deaths were involved.

376
00:32:21,992 --> 00:32:23,243
I'm shocked.

377
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:25,162
Was it an older model?

378
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:27,247
Yeah.
The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2.

379
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:30,626
That explains it. The A-2s
always were a bit twitchy.

380
00:32:30,668 --> 00:32:33,379
That could never happen now
with our behavioral inhibitors.

381
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,214
It is impossible for me
to harm...

382
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:38,092
or allow to be harmed
a human being.

383
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:40,260
Sure you don't want some?

384
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:45,015
Just stay away from me.
You got that straight?

385
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,104
Guess she don't like
the cornbread, either.

386
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:07,121
Squad, ten-hut!
Officer on deck!

387
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:08,664
As you were.

388
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:09,873
Quickly, quickly.

389
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:11,500
Settle down.

390
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:12,793
All right, listen up!

391
00:33:14,086 --> 00:33:15,546
Good morning, Marines.

392
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:19,508
I'm sorry we didn't have time
to brief you before we left-

393
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,926
Sir!

394
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:22,386
What is it, Hicks?

395
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:23,887
Hudson, sir.

396
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:25,556
He's Hicks.

397
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:28,559
What's the question?

398
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,438
Is this gonna be a stand-up
fight or another bug-hunt?

399
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:36,608
All we know is there's still
no contact with the colony...

400
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,069
and a xenomorph may be involved.

401
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:41,071
Excuse me, sir. A what?

402
00:33:41,113 --> 00:33:42,323
A xenomorph.

403
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:44,241
It's a bug-hunt.

404
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:46,452
What exactly
are we dealing with?

405
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:47,870
Ripley.

406
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,081
I'll tell you what I know.

407
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:54,501
We set down on LV-426.

408
00:33:54,543 --> 00:33:56,879
A crew member
was brought back on board...

409
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,589
with something attached
to his face...

410
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:00,716
some kind of parasite.

411
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:03,594
We tried to get it off.
It wouldn't come off.

412
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:06,597
Later, it seemed to come off
by itself and die.

413
00:34:06,597 --> 00:34:08,974
Kane seemed fine.

414
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:11,268
We were all having dinner.

415
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,146
It must have laid
something inside his throat...

416
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:15,689
some sort of embryo.

417
00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:18,567
He started...Um, he-

418
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:22,821
Look, man,
I only need to know one thing-

419
00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:24,698
where they are.

420
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,200
Vasquez, kick ass.

421
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:27,701
Anytime, anywhere.

422
00:34:27,743 --> 00:34:29,703
Right. Somebody said "alien..."

423
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:32,706
she thought they said
"illegal alien" and signed up.

424
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:34,750
-Fuck you, man.
-Anytime, anywhere.

425
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,418
Are you finished?

426
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:45,302
I hope you're right.
I really do.

427
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:50,099
Yeah, OK. Right.
Thank you, Ripley.

428
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,602
We have Ripley's report on disk.
I suggest you study it.

429
00:34:53,644 --> 00:34:55,020
Because just one
of those things...

430
00:34:55,062 --> 00:34:58,649
wiped out my crew
in less than twenty-four hours.

431
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:00,484
If the colonists
have found that ship...

432
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:02,861
there's no telling how many
have been exposed.

433
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:04,279
Do you understand?

434
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:10,744
Anyway, we have it
on disk, so look at it.

435
00:35:10,786 --> 00:35:12,371
Any questions?

436
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:15,958
What is it, Private?

437
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,044
How do I get out
of this chickenshit outfit?

438
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:20,838
You secure that shit, Hudson.

439
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,300
All right.

440
00:35:25,676 --> 00:35:27,594
Now listen up.

441
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,392
I want this thing to go smooth
and by the numbers.

442
00:35:34,643 --> 00:35:39,231
I want DCS and tactical database
assimilation by 0830.

443
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,066
Ordnance loading,
weapons strip...

444
00:35:41,108 --> 00:35:43,861
and drop-ship prep details
will have seven hours.

445
00:35:44,862 --> 00:35:45,988
Now move it, people!

446
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:50,034
You heard the man,
and you know the drill.

447
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:51,368
Assholes and elbows!

448
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:54,121
Hudson, come here.
Come here!

449
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:11,430
I don't care if you are
short, Hudson. Get it done.

450
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:14,099
You'll get lip cancer
smoking those.

451
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:17,603
I want this loading lock
sealed. Now!

452
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:19,772
-How many more, Spunkmeyer?
-Last one.

453
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:21,148
Good. Take it away.

454
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,668
Clear behind.

455
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,802
Did you check number three?

456
00:36:49,843 --> 00:36:54,181
Hi. I feel like a fifth wheel.
Is there anything I can do?

457
00:36:54,223 --> 00:36:56,642
I don't know.
Is there anything you can do?

458
00:36:59,353 --> 00:37:01,355
Well, I can drive that loader.

459
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:04,441
I have a Class Two rating.

460
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:07,695
Be my guest.

461
00:37:53,282 --> 00:37:54,950
Where you want it?

462
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:00,748
Bay twelve, please.

463
00:38:57,096 --> 00:39:00,808
We're a team, and there's
nothing to worry about.

464
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:03,227
We come here,
and we gonna conquer...

465
00:39:03,268 --> 00:39:06,188
and we gonna take some.
Is that understood?

466
00:39:06,188 --> 00:39:09,191
That's what we gonna do.
We are going to get some.

467
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:12,194
All right, people,
on the ready-line!

468
00:39:12,194 --> 00:39:13,320
-Are you lean?
-Yeah!

469
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:15,155
-Are you mean?
-Yeah!

470
00:39:15,197 --> 00:39:18,075
-What are you?!
-Lean, mean Marines!

471
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:22,288
Get on the ready-line!
Get some today!

472
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:24,081
Get on the ready-line!

473
00:39:24,123 --> 00:39:25,249
Move it out!

474
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,167
Move it out, God damn it!

475
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:30,504
Get hot! One, two, three!
Get out! Get out! Get out!

476
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:32,172
Move it out! Move it out!
Move it out!

477
00:39:32,214 --> 00:39:34,216
Move it out! Move it out!
Move it out!

478
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:36,844
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three!

479
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:40,431
Absolutely badasses!

480
00:39:40,472 --> 00:39:43,183
Let's pack 'em in!
Get in there!

481
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:44,768
Move it!

482
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,894
Let's go, let's go.

483
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:50,399
One, two, three,
four, five, six!

484
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:54,278
I want combat seating.
You know your places.

485
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:58,115
Get those weapons stowed.
Let's go.

486
00:39:58,157 --> 00:40:00,659
Come on. Settle down, people.

487
00:40:01,785 --> 00:40:04,038
Lock them in, Hudson.

488
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,416
Ready to get it on?
You know it!

489
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:10,294
OK, Bishop, let's go.

490
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:11,670
Roger.

491
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,634
I'm ready, man.

492
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:20,554
Ready to get it on! Go!

493
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:26,393
Stand by.
Cross-locking now.

494
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:28,687
Pre-launch auto-cycle engage.

495
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:33,942
Primary couplers released.

496
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:35,986
Hit the internals.

497
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:48,666
Oh, shit, man.

498
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:50,876
Confirm cross-lock
and drop stations secured.

499
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:53,796
Affirmative.
All drop stations secured.

500
00:40:58,133 --> 00:40:59,635
Stand by. Ten seconds.

501
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:06,225
Stand by to initiate
release sequencer...

502
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:07,434
on my mark.

503
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:10,437
We're on
an express elevator to hell.

504
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:12,189
Going down!

505
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:15,150
Two, one, mark.

506
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:19,446
Whoo-hoo!

507
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,502
Switch to DCS ranging.

508
00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:35,504
Two-four-oh,
nominal to profile.

509
00:41:35,546 --> 00:41:38,132
We're in the pipe, five by five.

510
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:51,103
We're picking up
some hull ionization.

511
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:54,815
Got it. Rough air ahead.
We're in for some chop.

512
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,874
How many drops
is this for you, Lieutenant?

513
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:15,419
Thirty-eight.

514
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,714
Simulated.

515
00:42:18,756 --> 00:42:20,841
How many combat drops?

516
00:42:20,883 --> 00:42:23,302
Uh, two...

517
00:42:23,344 --> 00:42:25,012
including this one.

518
00:42:25,054 --> 00:42:26,555
Shit.

519
00:42:26,597 --> 00:42:28,474
Oh, man.

520
00:42:41,111 --> 00:42:44,865
Range zero-one-four.
Turning on final.

521
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:53,082
I got a bad feeling
about this drop.

522
00:42:53,123 --> 00:42:57,294
You always say, "I got
a bad feeling about this drop."

523
00:42:57,336 --> 00:43:01,006
When we get back without
you, I'll call your folks.

524
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:08,222
All right.
Let's see what we can see.

525
00:43:08,263 --> 00:43:10,265
Everybody on-line.

526
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:11,767
Looking good.

527
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:15,479
Drake, check your camera.

528
00:43:15,521 --> 00:43:17,481
There seems to be a malfunction.

529
00:43:17,523 --> 00:43:18,774
That's better.

530
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:21,568
Pan it around a bit. Good.

531
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:26,323
I'm ready. Check it out.
I am the ultimate badass.

532
00:43:27,116 --> 00:43:29,952
State of the badass art.

533
00:43:29,994 --> 00:43:32,830
You do not wanna fuck with me.

534
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:34,790
Check it out.

535
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:39,795
Hey, Ripley, don't worry.

536
00:43:39,795 --> 00:43:43,382
Me and my squad of ultimate
badasses will protect you.

537
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,968
Check it out.

538
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:50,306
Independently targeting
particle-beam phalanx.

539
00:43:50,347 --> 00:43:51,807
Whap!

540
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:54,601
Fry half a city with this puppy.

541
00:43:54,643 --> 00:43:56,645
We got tactical
smart missiles...

542
00:43:56,645 --> 00:43:59,523
phase-plasma pulse-rifles,
RPGs.

543
00:43:59,565 --> 00:44:03,068
We got sonic,
electronic ballbreakers!

544
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,570
We got nukes.

545
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:06,488
We got knives, sharp sticks-

546
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:07,740
Knock it off, Hudson!

547
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:09,491
All right, gear up.

548
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:12,286
Two minutes, people. Get hot.

549
00:44:13,412 --> 00:44:15,122
Somebody wake up Hicks.

550
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:30,596
Coming around
for a seven-zero-niner.

551
00:44:30,638 --> 00:44:32,640
Terminal guidance locked in.

552
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:34,099
Where's the damn beacon?

553
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,644
Oh, I see it.

554
00:44:42,524 --> 00:44:44,485
That's the atmosphere processor?

555
00:44:44,526 --> 00:44:46,153
Yep, that's it.

556
00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:47,905
Remarkable piece of machinery.

557
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:49,531
Completely automated.

558
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:51,575
We manufacture those,
by the way.

559
00:45:01,794 --> 00:45:03,462
OK, Ferro.

560
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:06,966
Take us in low
over the main colony complex.

561
00:45:08,258 --> 00:45:10,719
Storm shutters are sealed.

562
00:45:10,761 --> 00:45:12,721
There's no visible activity.

563
00:45:12,763 --> 00:45:14,682
All right. Hold at forty.

564
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:15,891
Roger.

565
00:45:15,933 --> 00:45:17,685
Give me a slow circle
of the complex.

566
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:27,194
Structure seems intact.

567
00:45:28,779 --> 00:45:30,072
They still have power.

568
00:45:30,114 --> 00:45:33,867
OK, Ferro.
Set down on the landing grid.

569
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:37,246
Immediate dust-off on my clear,
then stay on station.

570
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:53,595
Down and clear.

571
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,890
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp!

572
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:03,314
I want a nice, clean dispersal
this time.

573
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,109
Let's go! Move it out!

574
00:46:07,151 --> 00:46:08,986
Head 'em out!

575
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:31,925
First squad up, on-line.

576
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:34,303
Hicks, get yours in a cordon,
and watch the rear.

577
00:46:34,303 --> 00:46:35,971
Vasquez, take point.

578
00:46:36,013 --> 00:46:37,514
Let's move!

579
00:46:45,314 --> 00:46:46,815
Move up.

580
00:46:50,152 --> 00:46:52,321
Hudson, run a bypass.

581
00:46:57,701 --> 00:46:59,244
Second squad, move up.

582
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:00,663
Flanking positions.

583
00:47:00,663 --> 00:47:02,373
Second squad, on-line.

584
00:47:31,402 --> 00:47:32,903
You set?

585
00:48:03,976 --> 00:48:06,562
Second team, move inside.
Hicks, take the upper level.

586
00:48:34,923 --> 00:48:36,425
Sir, you copying this?

587
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:39,970
Looks like hits
from small-arms fire.

588
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:45,100
We got some explosives damages,
probably seismic survey charges.

589
00:48:45,142 --> 00:48:47,102
Are you reading this?

590
00:48:47,144 --> 00:48:48,812
Keep it tight, people.

591
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:06,580
Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.

592
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:25,349
Nothing.

593
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:27,601
Not a goddamn thing.

594
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:35,442
Quarter and search by twos.

595
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:49,373
OK, Dietrich, Frost, you're up.

596
00:50:36,962 --> 00:50:38,839
It's right in here.

597
00:50:50,934 --> 00:50:52,061
-Now!
-Now!

598
00:50:53,103 --> 00:50:54,229
Hyah!

599
00:50:55,314 --> 00:50:56,940
Good one, Hudson.

600
00:50:56,982 --> 00:51:00,277
Uh, sir, we have
a negative situation here.

601
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,154
Uh, moving on, sir.

602
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:12,206
Wait.

603
00:51:12,247 --> 00:51:13,666
Wait, tell him to...

604
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,877
Hicks, back up.

605
00:51:16,919 --> 00:51:18,587
Pan right.

606
00:51:20,005 --> 00:51:21,882
There.

607
00:51:21,924 --> 00:51:23,884
You seeing this all right?

608
00:51:25,302 --> 00:51:26,428
Looks melted.

609
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:30,099
Somebody must have bagged
one of Ripley's bad guys here.

610
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:33,310
Acid for blood.

611
00:51:33,352 --> 00:51:36,689
If you like that,
you're gonna love this.

612
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,620
Quit screwing around.

613
00:51:51,662 --> 00:51:53,163
Second squad,
what's your status?

614
00:51:53,205 --> 00:51:55,165
We just finished our sweep.

615
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:56,667
Nobody's home.

616
00:51:56,709 --> 00:51:59,628
Roger.
Sir, this place is dead.

617
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,297
Whatever happened here,
we missed it.

618
00:52:03,257 --> 00:52:04,883
The area's secured.

619
00:52:04,925 --> 00:52:06,719
Let's go check their computer.

620
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,305
-It's not secure.
-The area's secured.

621
00:52:09,346 --> 00:52:12,433
First team, head for Operations.

622
00:52:12,474 --> 00:52:14,435
Hudson, get their CPU on-line.

623
00:52:14,476 --> 00:52:15,602
Affirmative.

624
00:52:15,644 --> 00:52:17,813
Hicks,
meet me at the south lock.

625
00:52:17,855 --> 00:52:19,148
We're coming in.

626
00:52:19,189 --> 00:52:20,983
He's coming in.

627
00:52:21,025 --> 00:52:22,985
I feel safer already.

628
00:52:23,027 --> 00:52:25,696
Pendejo jerkoff.
