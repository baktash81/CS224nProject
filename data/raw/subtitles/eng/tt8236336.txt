2
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:04,774
How long you been
working on this project, Dan?

3
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,651
Five years.

4
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,987
Five, wow.

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,115
Every day? Nights, weekends?

6
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:16,911
It’s been very consuming.

7
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,584
Do you have
a relationship, Dan? Family?

8
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,129
Just trying to get
a better sense of who you are.

9
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:29,590
When it started, I was
seeing someone, but, you know,

10
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,426
with the nature of the work
and the hours...

11
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,179
I wasn’t a very good partner.

12
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:43,062
Five years,
and it could all go away.

13
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,106
Just vanish in the face
of these allegations.

14
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,025
I can certainly imagine

15
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,944
an ambitious young man
like yourself

16
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,862
spends years
with his head buried

17
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,156
in some terrible spectacle,

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,450
gets frustrated
with the process,

19
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,828
sees an opportunity
to get the truth out faster,

20
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,204
maybe crosses a line.

21
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,831
I’m assuming this is
the most important thing

22
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,624
- you’ve ever been a part of.
- I didn’t do it.

23
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,459
Or I can see
an equally ambitious senator

24
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,919
encouraging you
to do something.

25
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,879
Now would be
a good time to tell me.

26
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,965
That did not happen.
What I did, I did on my own.

27
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,259
I acted alone.

28
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,010
You ever sleep, bro?

29
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,805
I used to. Got in the way of work.

30
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,099
Anything in that bag
contain the real names

31
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,309
of CIA officers,
assets or partners,

32
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,687
or any information
that would be in violation

33
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,106
of the agreement between
the Central Intelligence Agency

34
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,691
and the United States Senate?

35
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,527
- Have a good night, Jay.
- You, too, Dan.

36
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,155
So, you did steal the document?

37
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,074
I did not steal it.
I relocated it.

38
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,534
Everyone has their own words.

39
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,327
The language is built
to choose sides.

40
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,580
Now, why did you relocate it?

41
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,250
They could send you
to jail, Dan.

42
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,971
I think I should
start at the beginning.

43
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,181
- McDONOUGH: You Dan Jones?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,265
- Denis McDonough.
- Hi.

45
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,350
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

46
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,101
Come on in, yeah.
Absolutely.

47
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,770
So, thanks for coming in.

48
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,229
Uh, tell me your story.

49
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,148
My second day of grad school
was September 11th.

50
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,194
I was headed to a lecture,
and everything just... stopped.

51
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,947
The next day, I changed all my
classes to national security.

52
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,407
Good man.

53
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,825
So, what’s the long-term plan?

54
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,619
Where do you see yourself
in ten years?

55
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,037
Are you running for office?

56
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,622
Oh, uh, no.
No politics for me.

57
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,332
I think I’d be more effective
behind the scenes,

58
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,084
somewhere I can
really make a difference.

59
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,543
So, what about before Harvard?

60
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,754
Uh, what’d you fill up
your days with then?

61
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,340
Teach For America
for three years in Baltimore.

62
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,549
Seventh-graders.

63
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,343
I read that you taught
high school Spanish

64
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,928
in Saint Paul, Minnesota,
after college?

65
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,554
And LBJ’s first job
was teaching

66
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,640
at the Mexican school
in South Texas.

67
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,266
Knowing how
to deal with children

68
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,227
is a highly useful skill
when working on the Hill.

69
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,356
But from my perspective
as Senate staff,

70
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,235
I would wait until
things turn around up here.

71
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,862
I think Senator Daschle
would say the same thing.

72
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,824
Go get some real-world
experience in counterterrorism,

73
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,243
in... foreign policy.

74
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,453
Try the CIA. Try FBI.

75
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,748
Have them teach you what they
don’t teach you in a classroom.

76
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,625
Then you can come back here, and...

77
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,253
help us fix all the things that
Bush and Cheney are breaking.

78
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,171
McDonough.

79
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,507
Yes, Senator, uh, one second.

80
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,676
The boss. Here.

81
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,094
Keep in touch, huh?

82
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,722
- Thank you very much for your time.
- Absolutely.

83
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,724
McDONOUGH: I do not have
that information right now,

84
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,268
but I can certainly get that
for you in the next 15.

85
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,228
Yeah.

86
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,944
In regards to
the bomb plots in Germany,

87
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,320
three men were arrested
in Medebach

88
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,489
with 1,500 pounds
of hydrogen peroxide

89
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,825
and 26 military-grade
detonators.

90
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,785
The CIA suspects
the Islamic Jihad Union...

91
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,078
Excuse me.

92
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,997
Uh, can I borrow you
for a minute, Dan?

93
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,832
Uh, Senator would
like to see you.

94
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,333
Yeah, of course.

95
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,089
- Morning, Dan.
- Morning, Senator.

96
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,842
Have you seen the story today
in The New York Times?

97
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,261
- No, Senator, I have not.
- Evidently, the CIA destroyed

98
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,514
tapes of interrogations
of Al Qaeda detainees.

99
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,060
Did the Intel Committee know
there were tapes?

100
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,270
No. This is the first
I’ve heard of it.

101
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,774
So, I want to find out
what was on the tapes

102
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,233
and why they were destroyed.

103
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,819
We want you to lead
the investigation, Dan.

104
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,990
But if the tapes were
destroyed, how do we...

105
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:07,117
They’re saying
they have written records.

106
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,871
Thousands of pages.
Let’s see about that.

107
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,290
I want you to find out
exactly what they have

108
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,250
and read every word of it.

109
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,551
This report on the
destruction of tapes by the CIA

110
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,179
- has been two years in the making.
- Thank you.

111
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,848
The findings
are very troubling,

112
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,476
but it will remain classified.

113
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,979
Based on these revelations,
a larger study into

114
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:40,234
the entire CIA Detention
and Interrogation Program

115
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,237
is clearly in order.

116
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,073
All in favor, say "yay."

117
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,367
- Mr. Whitehouse?
- Yay.

118
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,161
- Mr. Burr?
- Yay.

119
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,248
- Mr. Rockefeller?
- Yay.

120
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,583
Mr. Chambliss?

121
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,210
- Nay.
- Mr. Risch?

122
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,629
I think
this is a waste of time.

123
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,631
Now, I know you voted
against this, Saxby...

124
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,092
But you already had
your tapes investigation.

125
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,470
Yes, but the rest of us
voted to go further, 14 to one.

126
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,140
It’s our job
to provide oversight.

127
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:15,561
All during the campaign,
you got candidate Obama saying

128
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,355
how he wanted to be the first
post-partisan president.

129
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,190
Saxby, you know me.

130
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,067
It’s my intention
that this report be seen

131
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,653
as coming from the entire
Intelligence Committee,

132
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,321
not just the Democrats.

133
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,948
So, who takes the lead?

134
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,701
Well, I was thinking Dan Jones.

135
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,829
He spent four years doing
counterterrorism at the FBI.

136
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,582
He’s already got
the security clearances.

137
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,127
The rules are the same
as the tapes investigation.

138
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,087
No politics, no bias,

139
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,881
and the senator
isn’t interested

140
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,716
in opinions or theories,
just facts.

141
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,342
Based on what
you found out already,

142
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,304
this could go to
a pretty dark place.

143
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,431
You need to keep your
personal feelings out of it.

144
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,434
That’s the first thing
Republicans are gonna look for.

145
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,519
No talking to the press
or your girlfriend

146
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,313
or any family members.

147
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,440
Nobody outside of
the committee.

148
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,275
You’re gonna get
a team of six...

149
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,776
three Republicans,
three Democrats...

150
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,820
but there can’t be
any Republican sentences

151
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,614
or Democratic paragraphs.

152
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,490
And how long do we have?

153
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,327
We’re hoping you can
wrap it up in a year or so.

154
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,080
You’re gonna have to keep the
senators updated on your work.

155
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,458
Nobody wants any surprises.

156
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,711
There’s a covert CIA off-site
in Virginia.

157
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,962
You start tomorrow.

158
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,048
- Jones, right?
- Sean.

159
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,343
- Hi. Dan.
- Sean Murphy from the Agency.

160
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,678
- Let’s go inside.
- Okay.

161
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,435
Identification, gentlemen.

162
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,021
The room we’ve designated is a SCIF.

163
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,357
No phone reception, no photos...
you know the drill...

164
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,442
lead walls.

165
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,361
And, per the agreement,

166
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,987
the room is off-limits
to everyone

167
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,906
- except committee personnel.
- Absolutely.

168
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,824
No one inside
without your permission.

169
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,670
- And the computers?
- Right here.

170
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,172
Your own dedicated server,
air-gapped workstations.

171
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,132
We’ll be updating
the database as we go.

172
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,301
The files will be loaded
on here as we collect them

173
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,178
- from across the Agency.
- Great.

174
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,138
We’ll want all relevant
documents as soon as possible.

175
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,640
- Well, we got to vet it first.
- Vet?

176
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,100
There’s a lot to...

177
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,476
Director Panetta
agreed to give us

178
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,811
everything pertaining
to the program.

179
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,021
Wh-Who would be,
who would be vetting it?

180
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,023
It’s a big agency.

181
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,775
We got to make sure
you don’t get anything

182
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,986
you’re not supposed to.

183
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,638
Make yourself at home.

184
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,692
There’s... no printer?

185
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,152
No paper.

186
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,279
No documents are allowed
to leave the room

187
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,156
without CIA approval.

188
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,201
Paper has a way of getting
people in trouble at our place.

189
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,248
I think at some point
we’re gonna need a printer.

190
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,416
And paper.

191
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,044
At our place...

192
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,629
paper’s how
we keep track of laws.

193
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,551
Okay.

194
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:15,175
...calling this
an obvious terrorist attack

195
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,469
based on very
preliminary information,

196
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,346
the information that

197
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,680
intelligence officials
are getting...

198
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,474
You’re not gonna like this.

199
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,643
...a possible
hijacked plane, and of course

200
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,979
the-the very horrifying video
of the plane...

201
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,399
We confirmed some of the names.

202
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,775
The hijackers?

203
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,610
Two of the guys from
the Malaysia meetings.

204
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,987
The San Diego guys.
They took down Flight 77.

205
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,364
Pentagon.

206
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,949
...the coordination
that took place

207
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,450
to have two planes
hit the towers...

208
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,494
Attention, everyone, please.

209
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,830
We have reason to believe
the Counterterrorism Center

210
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,415
is a potential target.

211
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,167
We’re asking all personnel
to evacuate, immediately.

212
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,169
Jim Miklaszewski

213
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,504
there from the Pentagon.

214
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,089
Of course, the president
has the authority

215
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,633
to scramble
military, uh, forces,

216
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,343
and, uh, this is a case,
obviously,

217
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,012
in which, uh, retaliation,
if indeed it proves to be

218
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,931
a terrorist incident,

219
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,516
will be contemplated.

220
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,560
We also have to work, though,

221
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,145
sort of, the-the dark side,
if you will.

222
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,688
We’ve got to spend time
in the shadows

223
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,606
in-in the intelligence world.

224
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,984
Uh, a lot of
what needs to be done here

225
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,778
will have to be done quietly,
without any discussion...

226
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:17,988
Fucking warned them.

227
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,449
August 6th
presidential briefing:

228
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,451
"Bin Ladin Determined
to Strike in U.S."

229
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,953
- Flashing red lights.
- And before that,

230
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,164
in July, what did we say?

231
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,583
"There will be
significant terrorist attacks

232
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,670
against the United States in
the weeks and months to come."

233
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,172
It’s not your fault.

234
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,842
It is a mean, nasty, dangerous,
uh, dirty business out there,

235
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,303
and we have to operate
in that arena.

236
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,430
But we need to make certain
that we have not

237
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,725
tied the hands, if you will,
of our intelligence community.

238
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,352
Counterterrorism Director Black
and I saw President Bush

239
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,229
at Camp David this weekend.

240
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,565
And the president gave me
his word that there will be

241
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,319
no changes in CIA leadership as
a result of Tuesday’s attacks.

242
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,070
We will look forward now,

243
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,532
not waste time second-guessing
or looking for blame.

244
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,993
Going forward, we will be
the tip of the spear

245
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,329
in the battle against Al Qaeda.

246
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,998
As I said
to the president, two weeks,

247
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,126
we’ll have flies walking
across Al Qaeda eyeballs.

248
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,253
I’ve asked Chief Counsel Rizzo
here to walk us through

249
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,506
where we are from
a legal standpoint.

250
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,676
The president has issued
a memorandum of notification

251
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,264
giving CIA the power to capture
and detain suspected terrorists

252
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,766
on the battlefield.

253
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,726
Detain them where?

254
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,937
Are we bringing them
to the U.S.?

255
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,147
We’re really not
in the prison business

256
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,399
- over in Counterterrorism.
- Look,

257
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,110
the budget for Counterterrorism
last week was what?

258
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,530
$600 million?

259
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:45,200
The budget this week is
whatever you need it to be.

260
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,161
And we are in whatever business
it takes to get the job done.

261
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,122
Initially, CIA legal

262
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,625
stated that any facility used
to hold detainees

263
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,378
had to meet the requirements
of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons,

264
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,546
but then Deputy Director Pavitt

265
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:58,922
thought that was
gonna be too limiting.

266
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,007
So, who came up
with the black sites?

267
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,092
Not totally clear.

268
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,760
My guess is either

269
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,555
a senior officer
at Counterterr... CTC,

270
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,014
or Alec Station bin Laden unit

271
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,683
decided black sites
were the best option.

272
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,686
Well, did the CIA
tell the State Department

273
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,481
they were making deals
to hold people on foreign soil?

274
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,609
Where was Secretary of State
Powell in all this?

275
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,152
Well, I found a memo.

276
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,364
The CIA’s general counsel...

277
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,116
said the decision was made

278
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,743
not to tell Powell
about the program,

279
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,454
because...

280
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,039
"He would blow his stack

281
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,542
if he were to be briefed
on what was going on."

282
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,421
Well, who decided that?

283
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,256
Someone inside the White House.

284
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,340
Mm-hmm.

285
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,760
What about interrogations?

286
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,596
President Bush’s memoranda

287
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,681
just authorized
capturing and detaining.

288
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,850
It didn’t say anything
about interrogations.

289
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,769
And who gave them permission
to play that role?

290
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:58,732
Nobody. It looks like
it started with legal at CTC.

291
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,195
Do you want me to brief Senator McCain
on this? I know he’s interested.

292
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,990
The Republicans just
pulled out of the study, Dan.

293
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,414
Good morning.

294
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,458
Where is everybody?

295
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,129
Attorney General Holder
opened a criminal investigation

296
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,589
into the CIA.

297
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,133
As a result, the Agency
won’t allow any of their people

298
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,760
to be interviewed
for our report.

299
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,179
The Republicans don’t see
how we can move forward,

300
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,388
so they’re out.

301
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,391
So, does this mean we stop?

302
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,185
I mean, the committee
voted to investigate.

303
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,728
The senator says we keep going.

304
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,647
But we can’t actually talk
to anyone who was involved

305
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,899
- in the program.
- Right. According to CIA legal,

306
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,443
CIA personnel is
only speaking to DOJ.

307
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,028
And is DOJ gonna
share their findings?

308
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,404
I mean, can we work with them?

309
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,822
I’ve reached out
to the special prosecutor.

310
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,532
I’m waiting to hear back.

311
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,451
Okay, but if nobody who
actually worked on the program

312
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,787
is going to talk to us,
how do we investigate?

313
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,288
So, we have the files,

314
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,248
their e-mails and cables,
their memos.

315
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,958
We have to use
their own communications

316
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,251
to tell the story.

317
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,796
Do you have any idea
how hard that’s gonna be?

318
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,048
The tapes investigation
took two years, Dan,

319
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,009
and this is about a lot more
than what was on the tapes.

320
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,012
Uh, we don’t even know
what this is.

321
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,264
Right, but we do know
who it starts with.

322
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,725
We go one detainee at a time.

323
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:49,926
You speak English?

324
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,179
My name is Ali Soufan.
I’m with the FBI.

325
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,931
You’re under arrest.

326
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,017
- You understand?
- No. Where are you taking me?

327
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,860
Your wound is infected.

328
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,070
But we’re going to
take good care of you.

329
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,702
I want to show you something.

330
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,045
He’s talking to
someone off-screen.

331
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,341
He’s calling him Mukhtar.

332
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,218
You know who that is?

333
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,397
Mukhtar.

334
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,199
A man who lost his mind?

335
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,208
No, not him.

336
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,092
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?

337
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,832
Abu Zubaydah confirmed
that KSM is the leader

338
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,668
of all Al Qaeda operations
outside of Afghanistan.

339
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,044
He trained the hijackers.

340
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,629
We’re calling him
the mastermind.

341
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,256
Outstanding.

342
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,341
Hats off
to the bin Laden group.

343
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,093
Whichever one of
your people did this,

344
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,345
I want to call them and
congratulate them in person.

345
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,347
Who was it?

346
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,266
Wasn’t our guy.

347
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,184
What? Who got it?

348
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,937
FBI is working Zubaydah.

349
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,397
An FBI guy got this?

350
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,315
Yes, Ali Soufan.

351
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,234
Uh, they used him
in the Cole investigation.

352
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,653
He’s part of their counterterrorism group.
He speaks Arabic.

353
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,364
I don’t care who speaks Arabic.

354
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,117
This is not just
a criminal investigation.

355
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,869
We are gathering
intelligence here.

356
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,370
That is what we do.

357
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,706
The FBI is looking at the past.

358
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,958
We need to stop attacks
in the future.

359
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,294
I want CIA in the room
with this guy, okay?

360
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,338
I want CIA
in the room with Zubaydah.

361
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,048
So, who do we have
who can work on him?

362
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,633
CIA runs sources,
people who cooperate.

363
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,135
That’s not these guys.

364
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,387
Every second we are not
draining the detainee’s brain,

365
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,180
we are rolling the dice.

366
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,765
We need our people in the room.

367
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,727
We need to be the ones
asking the questions now.

368
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,271
I heard from someone
over in Technical Services,

369
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,106
a woman named Miriam,

370
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,817
about a couple of
Air Force psychologists

371
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:56,237
who came in and pitched a whole
new approach to interrogations.

372
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,615
Jim Mitchell and Bruce Jessen.

373
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,701
Miriam says Mitchell
has the special sauce.

374
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,247
Zubaydah didn’t
tell us everything,

375
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:10,043
because we stopped short
of where we needed to go.

376
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:15,757
SERE stands for Survival,
Evasion, Resistance and Escape.

377
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,261
It’s a program to help prepare
U.S. Special Forces

378
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,639
for whatever they might
encounter if captured.

379
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,142
Now, I have over 14,000 hours

380
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,895
observing SERE
interrogation techniques.

381
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,980
Bruce here
has more than that...

382
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,899
Uh, observing,
as opposed to...?

383
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,944
I took a course in conducting
interrogations as well.

384
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,821
I worked with volunteers
in actual simulations.

385
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,908
We feel we can reverse engineer

386
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,828
these SERE techniques
to induce learned helplessness.

387
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,830
Can you explain
what that means,

388
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,874
"reverse engineer"?

389
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,918
Instead of using
these techniques

390
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,670
to protect our people,

391
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,882
we use them to achieve
compliance in the detainees.

392
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:01,177
Our plan involves, uh,
using individual assessments

393
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,974
of detainees to create
a program designed to induce

394
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,769
debility, dependency and dread.

395
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,981
- We call these the three "D"s.
- Three "D"s.

396
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,066
And there’s science
to back this up?

397
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,693
Oh, yes. Yes, sir.

398
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,486
Excuse me, Dr. Mitchell.

399
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,531
Can you elaborate on, uh, the
techniques you’ll be employing?

400
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,032
Absolutely.

401
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,037
The, uh, the attention grasp.

402
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,874
Walling.

403
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,960
Facial hold.

404
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:38,297
The facial slap or insult slap.

405
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,299
Cramped confinement.

406
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,053
Wall standing.

407
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,223
Stress positions.

408
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,642
Sleep deprivation.

409
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,769
Waterboarding.

410
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,813
Use of insects.

411
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,399
And mock burials.

412
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,030
Well, from my perspective,
this seems like it could be

413
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,033
a potential game changer,
but, of course...

414
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,076
it’s up to Director Rodriguez.

415
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,912
I think if we’re serious about
stopping the next threat,

416
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,831
we need to put on
our big boy pants

417
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,708
and provide the authorities
these guys need.

418
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:18,254
These approaches might...
raise some eyebrows at Defense.

419
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,174
Well, we’re not at Defense.
We’re at the CIA.

420
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,633
Besides, you just said,

421
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,677
we use this SERE stuff
on our guys all the time.

422
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,763
I don’t see a problem.

423
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,765
Shortly after
the CIA’s decision

424
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,975
to engage Dr. Mitchell,
Abu Zubaydah was moved

425
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,269
to a cell that was lit
24 hours a day.

426
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,481
Loud noise was fed into
his cell to disrupt his sleep.

427
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,441
What about the guy
who got him talking?

428
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,151
Ali Soufan?

429
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,111
Wait, he’s FBI, not CIA.

430
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,614
So, we can ask him
questions, right?

431
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,075
No rule against that.

432
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,618
We can try.

433
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,839
There’s only
one interrogation technique

434
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,425
that works: rapport building.

435
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,261
You get close to these guys,
and they open up.

436
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,222
But the CIA
didn’t believe that.

437
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,890
Just look at Abu Zubaydah.

438
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,101
Well, you got him to talk.
How’d you do that?

439
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,270
I walked in one day and
played him a tape of himself.

440
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:18,689
Most of it was
of a phone conversation.

441
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,233
Uh, we had tapped his phones.

442
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,652
But he forgot to hang up
at the end of the call,

443
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,571
so we had all this
background noise of his house.

444
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,573
Then my partner walked in

445
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,118
with a big box
full of cassette tapes.

446
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,370
We told him we had bugged
his safe house;

447
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,038
we had been listening
for months;

448
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,707
we knew everything,
so lying was pointless.

449
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,751
He looked at
the box full of tapes and...

450
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,211
And all-all the tapes
were blank.

451
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:43,005
Of course they were.
But he didn’t know that.

452
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,049
So, he talked.

453
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,553
Uh, what happened when
the contractors showed up?

454
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,472
Who the fuck is this?

455
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,432
Dr. Mitchell
is an Air Force psychologist,

456
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,643
and he’s developed
a new method of interrogation.

457
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,186
Why-why do we need
a new method?

458
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,188
He’s not telling you
everything.

459
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,399
We think he knows more.

460
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,733
We put him at number three

461
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,360
or number four
in Al Qaeda leadership.

462
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,486
He probably knows
the next move.

463
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,864
Do you speak Arabic, Jim?
Does Gary here?

464
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,198
Don’t need to.

465
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,535
C-Can I ask you something?

466
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,873
Have you ever interrogated
any sort of extremist before?

467
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,959
- Know much about Al Qaeda?
- No.

468
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,628
Have you ever interrogated
any sort of terrorist before?

469
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:26,132
- No.
- Any sort of criminal?

470
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,592
No.

471
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,344
Have you ever interrogated
anyone before?

472
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,679
It’s not important.

473
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,808
He’s a human;
I’m a psychologist.

474
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,643
He knows a secret,

475
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:42,190
and I’m gonna get him
to tell that secret to Gary.

476
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,525
What-what are you going
to do to him that isn’t...

477
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,861
What am I gonna do?

478
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,571
What is Jim gonna do?

479
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,908
Jim’s gonna do what works.

480
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,995
Let’s go, shitbird!

481
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,876
Move it, asshole!

482
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,879
Help! Please!

483
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,064
You can’t just shave
a Muslim man.

484
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,232
Do you know what that means?

485
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,525
He’s going to shut down.

486
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,153
Got to humiliate him,
right off the bat.

487
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,113
Same reason
we took away his clothes.

488
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,740
Why the loud music?

489
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,575
Sleep deprivation.

490
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,245
We stop the music
when he starts talking.

491
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,913
Then he can sleep.

492
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,581
Tired people tell the truth?

493
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,708
Learned helplessness.

494
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,836
You’re familiar with
Dr. Martin Seligman?

495
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,381
Seligman did
an experiment with dogs.

496
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,299
He put them in a cage

497
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,927
with a barrier
running down the middle.

498
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,637
And one side of the cage
was electrified

499
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,264
and the other wasn’t.

500
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,140
At first,
when he shocked the dogs,

501
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,142
they’d jump over the barrier
to get away.

502
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,436
And then
he electrified both sides.

503
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,439
There was no escape.

504
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,402
No belief they could
change anything.

505
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:13,489
He’d open the door to the cage,
they wouldn’t even leave.

506
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,032
It’s learned helplessness.

507
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,076
That’s what we’re
gonna instill in this man.

508
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,869
You’ll see.

509
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,628
A coffin?
You’re gonna kill him?

510
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,922
Let’s call it
a confinement box.

511
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,758
I got this one,
and I got a smaller one.

512
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:35,511
And you’re gonna
put him in there?

513
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:40,599
With these, which, based on
my evaluation, he hates.

514
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,393
Are you out of your mind?

515
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,979
We don’t do this.

516
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,522
You know this is
against the law.

517
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,150
The most senior people
have signed off on it.

518
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,735
We’re putting him on trial.

519
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,903
How are we gonna build
a case against him?

520
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,615
Who says he’s getting a trial?

521
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,620
I wanted to arrest him
right there on the spot.

522
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,123
- I told the Bureau that.
- What’d they say?

523
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,000
They briefed Director Mueller,

524
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,170
and told me to get the hell
out of there, so I did.

525
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,964
- When was that?
- Late May, mid-May or...

526
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,592
’Cause I’m finding records
that say that Mitchell left

527
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,552
a little while later,
early June,

528
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,181
for R & R and some meetings
at headquarters.

529
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,850
But we had one
high-value detainee in custody,

530
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,435
Abu Zubaydah.

531
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,063
And after Mitchell left,
the CIA put him in isolation,

532
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,815
and didn’t ask him
a single question for 47 days.

533
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,527
Are you fucking kidding me?

534
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,738
The whole country was
on red alert that summer.

535
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,740
If they were so concerned
about the next attack,

536
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,033
why’d they stop
asking questions?

537
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,368
Right, it doesn’t
make any sense.

538
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,453
Once the psychologist
showed up,

539
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,205
almost nothing did anymore.

540
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,631
The CIA said
Zubaydah was involved

541
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,758
in every major
terrorist operation

542
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,134
carried out by Al Qaeda.

543
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:58,636
They told the president

544
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,179
he was number three or four
in the organization.

545
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,723
Yes, that was
my understanding as well.

546
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,975
And the claim that
Zubaydah was a major player

547
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,478
was the main justification they
gave to the Justice Department

548
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,021
for needing to go harder.

549
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,856
They were certain
he knew about the next attack.

550
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,566
But last night I found this.

551
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,487
Turns out Zubaydah wasn’t three
or four in the organization.

552
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,823
He wasn’t part of
Al Qaeda leadership at all.

553
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,950
They only had one source
calling him that,

554
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,327
and that source later admitted
he was lying.

555
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:26,080
So, they exaggerated who he was

556
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,707
to the president
and the Department of Justice

557
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:32,128
in order to get legal approvals
for these new techniques?

558
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,671
Is that what you’re saying?

559
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,424
I think that’s a possibility.

560
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,217
The program
really starts with him.

561
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,224
Have you guys
used this thing before?

562
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,476
The waterboard?

563
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,270
No, it’s a Navy thing.

564
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,063
But we watched a video.

565
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,648
We tested it on each other,

566
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,276
just to get a feel
for the experience.

567
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,027
Is it safe?

568
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,864
Yes.

00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,457

00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,044

I don’t know.

or any information that would
violate the agreement between

00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,570
the Central Intelligence Agency
and the United States Senate?

00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,489
- All good.
- All right, good night.

00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,241
- Have a good night, Jay.
- Get home safe.

589
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,409
Good night.

00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,052

591
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:49,723
Do I know you?

592
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,892
No, but I think I can help you.

593
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,937
- Help-help me with what?
- The EIT program.

594
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,106
That’s what you’re
looking into, isn’t it?

595
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:03,153
I need to know
I won’t be named, anywhere.

596
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,030
I’m still with the Agency.

597
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:08,701
My even being here with you,
talking, is...

598
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,872
What was your involvement?

599
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:17,543
Office of Medical Services,
black sites.

600
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,713
- So, you’re a doctor?
- Physician’s assistant.

601
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,339
The American
Medical Association

602
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,882
won’t allow doctors
to be involved.

603
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,302
They take an oath: do no harm.

604
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,554
We’re the next best thing.

605
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,223
I was there
when the contractors arrived.

606
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,686
They made tapes of the
Abu Zubaydah interrogations,

607
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,187
but there’s a 21-hour period

608
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,231
where the transcripts
are missing... nothing.

609
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,025
They were using the waterboard.

610
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,027
Zubaydah lost consciousness.

611
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,279
He was choking to death,
drowning.

612
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,156
Not just thinking
he was drowning,

613
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,991
he was actually
fucking drowning.

614
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,661
I was told that the waterboard

615
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,913
was only gonna be used
as a last resort.

616
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,249
The contractors did
an assessment of the prisoner,

617
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,460
- and they made a call...
- What kind of assessment?

618
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,378
Th-They bounced him
off the walls a few times

619
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,964
and then strapped him down and
poured water down his throat.

620
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,966
We understand this is
a different approach,

621
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,218
- but it’s based on science.
- Science?

622
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:09,928
Oh, come on. What science?

623
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,097
- Have you seen their science?
- They believe the waterboard

624
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,515
is working here
to create compliance.

625
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,850
Well, of course they do.

626
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,019
They’re the ones who get
to decide when it’s used.

627
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,772
And they’re also the ones who
get to decide if it’s working.

628
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,440
How is that even ethical?

629
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,609
The people we’re dealing with
weaponized daily life.

630
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,153
Would you like to talk about
the ethics of that?

631
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,405
We’re here to make sure

632
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,949
that nothing like that
ever happens again.

633
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,451
They’re training their people

634
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,786
to resist
traditional interrogations

635
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,120
in the back of a cave
somewhere.

636
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,456
So we need to change
our approach

637
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,627
before another bomb goes off
or another building falls down.

638
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,295
Okay, okay.

639
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:47,132
What is gonna happen when one
of our soldiers gets captured

640
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,885
and takes out a card with
the Geneva Convention on it

641
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,346
and wants to be treated
like a human being?

642
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,973
You think his captors
aren’t gonna remember

643
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,975
the way these people
were treated here?

644
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,062
- And for what?
- Do you have a kid at home?

645
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,818
We’re not gonna get beat again.

646
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,152
Besides the chief of station,

647
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,446
did you report your concerns
up the chain of command?

648
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,199
We got a cable from
Director Rodriguez

649
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:15,327
telling us to stop putting
our objections in writing.

650
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,579
No paper trail.

651
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,833
I told them if they were gonna
keep using the new techniques,

652
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,751
I wanted out.

653
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,504
I wasn’t the only one.
Guys were choking up.

654
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,551
It’s all in the e-mails.

655
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,057
As early as November 2001,

656
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,144
the CIA’s legal team
circulated a memorandum

657
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,770
describing
a novel legal defense

658
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:44,106
for their officers
who might engage in torture.

659
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,734
Come on. They actually
called it torture?

660
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,277
The CIA?

661
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,404
They just forgot
we have laws against that?

662
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,781
Yes, sir.
Mitchell and Jessen renamed it

663
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,742
"enhanced interrogation"
to help sell it,

664
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,618
but the Agency was
talking about doing it

665
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,328
before they even had
a single detainee.

666
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,790
My question, Senator, is:
How did the CIA know

667
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,667
they needed
to torture prisoners

668
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,878
before they even had one?

669
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,796
That didn’t come from
Cheney and Addington?

670
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,757
Seems like it happened
the other way around.

671
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,760
The CIA took it
to the Bush White House

672
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,803
and John Yoo at
the Office of Legal Counsel.

673
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,472
So, here’s where we’re at.

674
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,808
The crime of torture,
as described in Section 2340,

675
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,479
requires that the defendant...
in this case, an interrogator...

676
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,690
intends to cause
severe pain or suffering.

677
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:29,693
But in this case, that’s not
the interrogator’s intent.

678
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:32,946
Right. The intent is to gain
intel, save American lives.

679
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,783
But, John,
what if the techniques

680
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,534
the interrogator employs
do nonetheless

681
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,161
cause pain and suffering?

682
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,788
How do we deal with that?

683
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,874
Well, the key phrase is
"severe pain or suffering."

684
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,460
But 2340 never actually defines
the term "severe."

685
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,630
We found this definition
in a Medicare statute.

686
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,340
Severe pain or suffering:

687
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:55,427
"acute symptoms that place the
individual in serious jeopardy

688
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,721
- and are hard to endure."
- Meaning?

689
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,015
To constitute torture,

690
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,728
the damage done must rise
to the level of organ failure,

691
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:09,024
impairment of bodily function,
or death.

692
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,568
So, basically, if someone dies,
we’re doing it wrong?

693
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,570
If the president
deemed it necessary

694
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:16,532
to... crush the testicles
of a child

695
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,617
to stop a plane
from crashing into a building,

696
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,993
to save American lives,

697
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,955
there is no law or treaty
that could stop him.

698
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,749
I can make
the same argument for

699
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:29,044
gouging out a prisoner’s eyes
or dousing him with acid.

700
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,505
In our opinion,

701
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:36,802
if it provides unique
intelligence that saves lives,

702
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,012
and doesn’t cause
any lasting harm,

703
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:41,223
then it’s legal
for the president to order it.

704
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,433
What do we mean
when we say "unique"?

705
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:46,144
Intelligence that couldn’t have
been obtained any other way.

706
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:51,358
And you’ve discussed
all of this

707
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,235
with the White House, I assume?

708
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,695
And?

709
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,614
Did they tell Bush what
they were gonna do to Zubaydah?

710
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,575
- No.
- And National Security Advisor Rice...

711
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,702
- where was she in all this?
- National Security Advisor Rice

712
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,204
was told about the program,
but she was also told

713
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:06,665
the president
would not be briefed.

714
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,792
Who tells the president’s
national security advisor

715
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,836
not to brief the president?

716
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,756
Cheney and Addington.

717
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,260
According to CIA records, Bush
wasn’t told about the program

718
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:23,223
until April of 2006,
four years later.

719
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,229
And the records we found state

720
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:32,816
that when the president was
finally told about the program,

721
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,236
he expressed discomfort
with the image of a detainee

722
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,905
chained to the ceiling,
wearing a diaper,

723
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,616
and forced to go
to the bathroom on himself.

724
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,578
How long till you can
get this thing done, Dan?

725
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,663
We’ve got to get this out.

726
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,796
What about this guy,
Gul Rahman?

727
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,341
Captured in Peshawar,
November 2002.

728
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,594
He’s not at Gitmo.
He’s-he’s not anywhere.

729
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,893
Gul Rahman.

730
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,728
Gul...

731
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,606
No. They didn’t tell
the committee about him.

732
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:15,275
He’s detainee number 24.

733
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,783
HQ says he knows

734
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,786
operational detail
about Al Qaeda.

735
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,496
The guy’s an asshole.

736
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,207
Threw his food at us, he
threatened to kill the guards.

737
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,169
I’ve asked headquarters
to approve the application

738
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,964
of the enhanced measures
for this detainee,

739
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,715
and the request
has been approved.

740
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:42,219
- Oh, great. We haven’t had any luck loosening him up.
- Mm.

741
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,845
Come on!

742
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,389
Ran him up and down the hall,

743
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,849
beat the crap out of him...
nothing.

744
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:52,229
Even been trying this thing
they call short shackling.

745
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,564
Chain a dude’s hands
to a bolt on the floor.

746
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,777
Then you chain his feet
to the same bolt.

747
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,571
Farmers call it hog-tying,
I think.

748
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:04,116
He finally admitted
to something.

749
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,450
What was that?

750
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:09,621
That he was who we said he was:
Gul Rahman.

751
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:17,337
What you want to do first is
take away his sense of control.

752
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:19,840
If you like, I could spend
some time showing you

753
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:23,010
how to achieve this
with the enhanced techniques.

754
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,887
Great.

755
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:29,141
We got another 30 guys here
to deal with.

756
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,604
I heard you told the doctor
you were cold.

Absolutely. Come on in, Dan.

763
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,964
The senator is
needed on the floor for a vote.

764
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,883
Uh, give her five minutes.

765
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,928
Did you sleep last night, Dan?

766
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:12,309

Gul Rahman.

771
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,070
They thought he was maybe
working for an Afghan warlord

772
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,988
or that he knew something
about an attack.

773
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:26,865
- Did he?
- No, he died before they found out

774
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,825
anything besides his name.

775
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,410
Dumped cold water on him
one night

776
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:32,412
and found him dead in his cell
in the morning.

777
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:33,997
The autopsy said hypothermia.

778
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:37,250
- Where did you get this from?
- Inspector general’s report.

779
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:41,713
CIA did their own investigation
into the death of Gul Rahman.

780
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,592
The officer in charge
was recommended

781
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,260
for a performance bonus.

782
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:48,595
They promoted him.

783
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,680
He’s still out there
in the field.

784
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:58,814
Well, are you accusing the CIA
of murder, Dan?

785
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,026
Because that sounds like
where this is going.

786
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,903
We have proof
the deputy director

787
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:08,031
coached the officer in charge
how to cover up what happened,

788
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,534
told him to be careful
what he put in writing.

789
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,870
So, why would they need
to cover it up

790
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,914
if they were following
standard operating procedure?

791
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,542
Why didn’t they tell
the committee?

792
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,877
Why didn’t they tell you?

793
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,551
I’m gonna need to review
all this personally.

794
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,554
It’s very disconcerting.

795
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,606
"Disconcerting"?
"Very disconcerting"?

796
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,358
Dan, you need to be
careful here.

797
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,861
You’re getting
emotionally involved.

798
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,989
They fucking killed a guy, and
nobody was held accountable?

799
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,325
W-We don’t know
he was a terrorist.

800
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:55,287
- We barely even know his name.
- I understand.

801
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,164
And what you need
to understand is that

802
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,167
her name is going
on this report, not yours.

803
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,043
Senate staff doesn’t
have to run for reelection,

804
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,545
but she does.

805
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,882
Their legal argument said EITs
wouldn’t cause lasting harm.

806
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,718
So how long is Gul Rahman
gonna be dead for?

807
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,521
Are you guys seeing
this Panetta review?

808
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,190
It just showed up.

809
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,443
I don’t understand.

810
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,362
Looks like the CIA did
their own investigation.

811
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:32,032
It confirms everything
we’ve been finding.

812
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:41,333
So, what are you
gonna do with it?

813
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,376
Hopefully, nothing.

814
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,670
Special Prosecutor Durham,
please?

815
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,423
I’ve already left
several messages.

816
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,634
It’s Dan Jones again from
the Intelligence Committee.

817
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:51,968
How are you?

818
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:54,346
Good. I just wanted
to check in again to see

819
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,014
if the special prosecutor
is available

820
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,599
to meet on the CIA probe.

821
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:01,937
It can be off the record.
I just want to compare notes.

822
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,316
Yeah, same number.
Thank you.

823
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,155
You know, we got to think back

824
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,365
to the period after 9/11.

825
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,908
We didn’t even know who hit us.

826
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,284
We didn’t know that
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was

827
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:17,661
the mastermind of 9/11

828
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,329
or the operational commander
of Al Qaeda.

829
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,872
And then we started rounding up
these terrorists.

830
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:22,207
We caught Abu Zubaydah.

831
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,292
We caught, uh,
Ramzi bin al-Shibh and KSM.

832
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:26,795
And these guys provided us
information under questioning

833
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:30,257
by the CIA that stopped
a number of terrorist attacks.

834
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,800
They were pl-planning
to blow up

835
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,385
the U.S. consulate
in Karachi, Pakistan.

836
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,011
- Shit.
- They were planning to blow up

837
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,137
our Marine camp in Djibouti...

838
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,562
- Good morning.
- Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was

839
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:49,401
indicted in New York for trying
to blow up airplanes in 1995.

840
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:50,902
The CIA already knew about him.

841
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,654
They knew he was close
to bin Laden.

842
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,281
They knew about him before
Zubaydah ever identified him.

843
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:55,740
How long have you been here?

844
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,659
Also, according to this cable...
a few hours...

845
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,244
a CIA officer in Islamabad

846
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,204
began working someone
they call Asset X.

847
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:04,874
X claimed to have
direct access to KSM,

848
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:07,294
but was eventually turned away
when he asked for money.

849
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,755
- How much money?
- Few thousand bucks.

850
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,133
Two years later, after
they’ve been putting him off,

851
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,510
putting him off, putting him
off, they finally pay him,

852
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,095
and almost immediately
he sends a text

853
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,639
to his CIA handler saying:
"I’m with KSM."

854
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:22,225
It had nothing to do
with the waterboard.

855
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,894
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

856
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:43,830
One, two, three,

857
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,082
four, five, six...

858
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,626
Who are you
working with in the U.S.?

859
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,838
...seven, eight, nine,
10, 11...

860
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,882

00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,738
the Heathrow
and Canary Wharf plots.

872
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:19,407
He knows that.
It’s in his goddamn notebook.

873
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,701
We asked about plots
in the U.S., not London.

874
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:24,120
- He’s fucking with you again.
- To be honest,

875
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:27,165
I’ve never met a resistor
like this guy.

876
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:28,750
He’s a super resistor.

877
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,502
He lied to you
to make you stop.

878
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,670
He just tells us shit
he knows we already have.

879
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,089
That’s all he does.

880
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,716
Then that’s
what we’re learning.

881
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,387
That’s what the waterboard
is giving us.

882
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,724
We now know he’s lying.

883
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:46,851
I thought it was meant
to give us the truth.

884
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:50,855
And... the truth is he’s lying.

885
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:01,199
Headquarters says we go again.

886
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:04,160
The chief of interrogations

887
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:06,579
ordered the rectal rehydration
of KSM,

888
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:08,415
not for health reasons,

889
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,792
but as a way of showing total
control over the detainee.

890
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,753
Even though
rectal rehydration was never

891
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:15,672
an approved technique.

892
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,590
Total control isn’t
chaining the guy to the wall,

893
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:19,509
keeping him awake for days,
and threatening his family?

894
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,219
You need to shove a tube
up his ass?

895
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,846
This right here

896
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,472
is the rest of your life

897
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,599
unless you start telling the truth.

898
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:28,184
Then they went back
to waterboarding him.

899
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,853
"When a medical officer
pressed on KSM’s..."

900
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,563
- Wait. Where are you?
- Next page.

901
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,648
"When a medical officer
pressed on KSM’s abdomen,

902
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,692
he expressed water
from his mouth and nose."

903
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,694
So, he was swallowing
all the water.

904
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,028
"On March 17th,

905
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,864
the waterboard technique
began to evolve."

906
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,243
Interrogators used their hands
to maintain

907
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:48,246
a pool of water
over KSM’s nose and mouth.

908
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:02,010
Who are
the operatives inside the U.S.?

909
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,762
Issa... Issa...

910
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,806
Issa al-Britani.

911
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,851
Where is the next attack?

912
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,686
M-Montana.

913
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,482
We got something.

914
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:20,862
KSM told interrogators he sent
Abu Issa al-Britani to the U.S.

915
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:24,115
to recruit African American
Muslims in Montana

916
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,117
to blow up gas stations
and start forest fires.

917
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:27,202
Montana?

918
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,412
Muslims in Montana?

919
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,831
The FBI had serious doubts
as well.

920
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:34,334
Later, KSM admitted
he just told them

921
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,794
what they wanted to hear
to make it stop.

922
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:40,632
So, did they get anything
actionable from him at all?

923
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,175
Anything that saved lives?

924
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:45,595
They waterboarded him
183 times, and then concluded

925
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,764
KSM may never be
forthcoming or honest.

926
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,599
Everything they got from him

927
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,769
was either a lie
or something they already had.

928
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:55,522
Well, okay,
so my first question is:

929
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:59,859
If it works, why do you need
to do it 183 times?

930
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,320
Maybe when
the report comes out,

931
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,030
people will finally see that.

932
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:07,367
Well, let’s worry about getting
it right, getting it done.

933
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,827
We can worry about
changing the world later.

934
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:26,261
Sorry I’m late.

935
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,388
It’s okay.

936
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,099
- Barely slept.
- Want some coffee?

937
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,521
Hey, can I ask you something?

938
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,856
You ever, uh, have dreams,

939
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,568
you know, about the stuff
that’s in the report?

940
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:45,905
Yeah. I have one
where I’m drowning.

941
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:48,366
I can’t move my arms or legs.
I can’t breathe.

942
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,743
- That wakes me up.
- Last night I dreamt

943
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:53,705
I was trapped in
one of those confinement boxes.

944
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,540
They just left me there.

945
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,167
Daniel Jones, right?

946
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:00,628
- Do I know you?
- I just wanted to tell you to your face

947
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,755
that I think you
and that report are garbage.

948
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:04,507
- Excuse me...
- You weren’t there,

949
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:06,467
so you don’t know
what worked and what didn’t

950
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:07,719
or what we were up against.

951
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,512
You may not realize,
but we were trying

952
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:11,764
to protect this country
from people who want to destroy

953
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:13,141
everything we believe in.

954
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,059
You may not realize it,

955
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,437
but we’re trying to do
the exact same thing.

956
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,940
Your bullshit report will
never see the light of day.

957
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:27,113
Special Prosecutor
Durham, please.

958
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,282
It’s Dan Jones, calling again

959
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,285
about the Justice Department
investigation of the CIA.

960
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,078
We really need to meet.

961
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,123
You have?

962
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,960
Okay, what are their findings?

963
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:53,139
Fuck!

964
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,016
Nothing?

965
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,601
No indictments at all?

966
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,770
No charges against
Jose Rodriguez or Gina Haspel

967
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,229
for destroying the tapes.

968
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,523
Nothing against the CIA
for torturing people.

969
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,108
Nothing against
Jim Pavitt and the others

970
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,402
for providing misinformation,
nothing at all.

971
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:08,655
DOJ says they don’t have
enough admissible evidence

972
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:10,698
to convict anyone.

973
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,742
You go after the contractors,
and they’re indemnified.

974
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,202
You go after
the head of Counterterrorism,

975
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:15,995
and he’d just say
he was following orders

976
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,205
from the CIA director.

977
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,581
You go after the director,
and he...

978
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:20,208
well, he would just cite
the president.

979
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,793
Then the White House
would claim national security.

980
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:24,796
DOJ at least share
what they found?

981
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:25,922
No.

982
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:30,551
They won’t turn anything over.

983
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,971
We’re the only ones
still looking at this.

984
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,908
Dan?

985
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,494
Dan?

986
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,454
You know a CIA officer

987
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:00,748
testified before Congress
in 1978 regarding the use of

988
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:03,960
coercive physical interrogation
techniques in Latin America?

989
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,837
And the officer said
the techniques result

990
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,214
in false answers and have
proven to be ineffective.

991
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,757
And before Latin America,
they did it in Vietnam.

992
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:10,842
They knew it didn’t work...

993
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,176
Dan, I need
to tell you something.

994
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,720
...and they did it again.

995
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:14,804
Don’t even listen
to their own fucking people.

996
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,305
I’m leaving the study.

997
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:20,351
I... I got a job offer,
and I can’t turn it down.

998
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:23,896
I’m sorry, but don’t you see
what this is doing to you?

999
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,148
To all of us?

1000
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:26,941
I mean, my kids
are at home growing up,

1001
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,153
and I’m down here reading about
how they put a power drill

1002
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,863
against one guy’s head
and-and how they pulled

1003
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,489
another guy’s arms
out of his sockets.

1004
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,408
And I just... this is
how I’m spending my Sundays.

1005
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,034
And my Saturdays.

1006
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:39,746
This is how I spend every day.

1007
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:42,999
I just... I-I-I-I can’t.

1008
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:47,128
Um... I’m gonna leave
after Thanksgiving.

1009
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,178
Okay. I understand.

1010
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,804
Okay.

1011
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,264
Thanksgiving.

1012
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:01,517
That gives us...
that gives us a couple months.

1013
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:04,937
Dan, it’s November.

1014
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:07,774
Thanksgiving is next week.

1015
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:12,862
How many pages have
we written so far? Thousands?

1016
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:16,324
We don’t even know
if this is ever gonna come out.

1017
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,826
The tapes investigation
never did.

1018
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,411
It’s still classified.

1019
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:22,038
You just said it yourself:

1020
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,499
The CIA knew
this shit didn’t work in 1978,

1021
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,001
and it didn’t stop them
from doing it again.

1022
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,922
Look, we’ve been down here
for two years, Dan,

1023
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,633
in this basement.

1024
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:36,511
Nobody’s waiting for us
to come out.

1025
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,759
...shocking photos that
apparently show U.S. troops

1026
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:19,804
abusing detainees in a prison
outside Baghdad.

1027
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,347
We have a problem.

1028
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,891
Both myself and the president
have gone on record

1029
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:26,310
saying we do not
torture people.

1030
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,355
He just made a statement
for the U.N.’s goddamn

1031
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,483
Day in Support
of Victims of Torture.

1032
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:34,777
Wh-What-what did he say?

1033
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,615
"The United States
does not torture.

1034
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:42,994
It’s against our laws
and it’s against our values.

1035
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:48,416
I have not authorized it,
and I will not authorize it."

1036
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,379
I’m not sure where
that leaves either of us.

1037
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,506
So, here’s the deal.

1038
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:59,093
Some new lawyer over at OLC,
Jack Goldsmith,

1039
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,679
is saying there are issues
with the John Yoo memo.

1040
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,139
Legal issues?

1041
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,474
Yeah, and there’s
the inspector general’s report:

1042
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:08,185
allegations of
war crimes and torture.

1043
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:11,564
Throws the whole
program under the goddamn bus.

1044
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,274
What’s it say?

1045
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:17,069
"The inspector general finds
that EITs are inconsistent

1046
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:18,613
with the
public policy positions

1047
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:22,116
the United States has taken
regarding human rights,"

1048
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,993
blah, blah, blah.

1049
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,078
"The program, as implemented,

1050
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:30,958
diverges sharply from how the
CIA has described," blah, blah.

1051
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,878
"There is also little evidence
that the waterboard

1052
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,756
is effective
in gaining information."

1053
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:39,550
Look, guys, Director Tenet
wants to pause the program.

1054
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,013
You know, I retired
from the Air Force

1055
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:47,558
just a couple of months
before 9/11.

1056
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,310
22 years.

1057
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,522
And then
I wake up that morning,

1058
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:59,946
and I turn on the news and...
see what’s happening.

1059
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:06,577
A lot of people just went back
to their coffee and cornflakes.

1060
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:10,831
But Jim wanted
to do something

1061
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,501
to keep people safe.

1062
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,671
We are going right back to the
National Security Council today

1063
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,714
and asking to have
the program recertified,

1064
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:20,508
as many techniques as possible.

1065
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,885
We have a plan.

1066
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:24,971
Thank you. Thank you.

1067
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,158
Jones.

1068
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:48,411
Yes, Senator.

1069
00:54:58,004 --> 00:54:59,338
On the Sunday talk shows,

1070
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:01,007
former Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld

1071
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,134
and former Vice President
Dick Cheney

1072
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:06,804
argued enhanced interrogation
techniques played a major role

1073
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,265
in leading up to the raid
on bin Laden’s compound.

1074
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,308
No, that’s not right.
That’s not what happened.

1075
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,227
- It was not torture.
- I’ll look into it.

1076
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,563
And, uh, I would strongly
recommend that we continue it.

1077
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,356
At the heart of the controversy

1078
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,859
is a process called
waterboarding.

1079
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:24,238
Okay, here’s what
the CIA is claiming:

1080
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:28,576
They got bin Laden after using
EITs against detainees.

1081
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:36,208
They say it all started in 2002
with Abu Zubaydah

1082
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:39,587
and a detainee they called
"Riyadh the Facilitator,"

1083
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,881
who tipped them off
to Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti,

1084
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,174
who had ties to bin Laden.

1085
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,884
That’s not what happened?

1086
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,470
The truth is the CIA
was on al-Kuwaiti’s phones,

1087
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:51,182
e-mails, identity, long before
they captured any detainees.

1088
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:56,103
Before they even had
an EIT program.

1089
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:58,647
Zubaydah told us al-Kuwaiti had
nothing to do with bin Laden.

1090
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,525
Same with KSM
and-and the others.

1091
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:04,612
But now we have former
CIA Director Michael Hayden

1092
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:07,239
on the radio saying
this all came from EITs.

1093
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:09,909
And former Attorney General
Mukasey is out there saying

1094
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:12,078
KSM broke like a dam
after waterboarding.

1095
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:13,621
Where is he saying that?

1096
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,123
Wall Street Journal.
I found a memo.

1097
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:17,833
It’s from a few months back,
in March.

1098
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,335
It’s called
"The Public Roll-out."

1099
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,713
The memo states the Agency
wanted their PR people

1100
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:26,801
to connect the bin Laden raid
to intel obtained via EITs

1101
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,177
before it even happened.

1102
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,306
So... if the CIA got bin Laden,

1103
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,226
then who cares
what else it did?

1104
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,187
If it saved lives, there’s
no need for accountability.

1105
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,481
Exactly. They lied to Bush
about the program.

1106
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,316
Now they’re lying
to President Obama.

1107
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,112
This document about bin Laden
and, uh, the role of EITs,

1108
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:48,030
it just isn’t true.

1109
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:57,540
You want me to get you
the White House?

1110
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,918
Let’s do that.

1111
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:05,631
It’s very clear to us

1112
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:09,635
the EITs did not lead
to bin Laden.

1113
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:12,346
The CIA is misrepresenting
the operation.

1114
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,306
I’m sure you see that,
don’t you?

1115
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:16,725
McDONOUGH : I’m not
sure I understand, Senator.

1116
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,769
The mission was a success;
that’s the headline here.

1117
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:22,231
This is a crucial moment
in our nation’s history.

1118
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:26,819
I want to make certain that the
Agency isn’t manipulating it

1119
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:30,197
to sanitize
their own past actions.

1120
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:32,116
I will let
the national security advisor

1121
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,285
know your concerns, Senator.

1122
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,704
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Senator Feinstein.

1123
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,291
That’s it?

1124
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,668
They don’t care
the story is wrong?

1125
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:48,257
Well, I don’t think we can look
to the White House for support.

1126
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,976
What the hell just happened?

1127
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:02,354
The CIA just got
the president reelected.

1128
00:58:02,438 --> 00:58:04,231
That’s what happened.

1129
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,988
It was the
greatest manhunt of all time.

1130
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,616
You think you know the story,

1131
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,618
but hold on to your seats.

1132
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:18,787
Zero Dark Thirty,
the riveting new film,

1133
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,457
brings you the hunt
for Osama bin Laden

1134
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,168
as it has never been
seen before.

1135
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:41,268
This is it.
The last guy we have.

1136
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:47,524
Number 119: Muhammad Rahim,
captured June 2007.

1137
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:58,744
We kept Rahim awake

1138
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,913
for 138 hours straight.

1139
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:03,999
Used the attention grasp,

1140
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:07,002
facial hold,
dietary manipulation.

1141
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:10,422
Abdominal slaps,
stress positions.

1142
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:13,550
We even offered him a towel
to wear if he cooperated.

1143
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:14,885
Gave us nothing.

1144
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:16,595
He said that,
if we hurt him,

1145
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:19,932
he’d just make things up
to get us to stop.

1146
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,685
And then he said
he was at our mercy

1147
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,020
and we could kill him
if we wanted.

1148
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:26,772
What’s the point
of moving forward

1149
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,607
without the waterboard?

1150
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:30,818
It’s like trying to play
baseball without the bat.

1151
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,820
We’ve been going at him
for 60 days now,

1152
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,155
not getting anywhere.

1153
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:39,326
The problem is
that CTC hasn’t given us

1154
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,287
any good intel
to question him about.

1155
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,038
We don’t have any leverage.

1156
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,999
Hold on.
You’re the psychologists.

1157
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,834
You told me you were
gonna get us intel.

1158
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,627
Now you’re saying
we need to give it to you?

1159
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:54,049
I’m thinking we improve his
treatment for a week or two,

1160
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:58,137
give him some hope,
and then we go back at him hard

1161
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,556
and create
a sense of helplessness.

1162
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,768
Or we could try recruiting him.

1163
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:08,522
Tell him he can be
a CIA agent if he talks.

1164
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,982
The FBI does that.

1165
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,984
We’re not the FBI.
We don’t do that.

1166
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,737
The way the science works is

1167
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,905
we only get the intel after...

1168
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,699
After what?

1169
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,118
Why are so many of these guys
still lying to us

1170
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,329
after you work on them?

1171
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:27,833
Where’s the special sauce?

1172
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:34,006
You have to make this work.
It’s only legal if it works.

1173
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:36,884
The CIA’s questioning
of Muhammad Rahim

1174
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,094
resulted in
zero intelligence reports.

1175
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:42,431
On April 21, 2008,
the Agency convened

1176
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,266
an after-action review
of his interrogation.

1177
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,977
Senator, I just want to point
out that this is the first time

1178
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:48,645
the Agency stopped
and evaluated

1179
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,230
the effectiveness
of the program.

1180
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,484
And they concluded that,
in the future,

1181
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,569
CIA interrogators should use
rapport building.

1182
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:01,116
They even suggested
asking other agencies,

1183
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,410
law enforcement,
and even other countries

1184
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,245
about effective
interrogation methods.

1185
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,707
So...

1186
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,004
For the past six years,
there’s been a steady stream

1187
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:19,676
of CIA personnel...
directors, deputies, analysts...

1188
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,553
coming over here and telling me

1189
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:25,724
what an amazing success
EITs have been.

1190
01:01:25,808 --> 01:01:29,603
Somehow not even one of them
managed to mention that part.

1191
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:40,531
How many detainees have been
through the program in total?

1192
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,450
At least 119.

1193
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,830
The Agency admits
a quarter of them

1194
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,957
should never
have been detained.

1195
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:54,878
The EIT program never worked,
not on anyone.

1196
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:07,850
Today, we are gathered
to approve

1197
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,435
the committee’s study of

1198
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:14,565
the CIA Detention
and Interrogation Program.

1199
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:17,317
I would like to thank
Daniel Jones

1200
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:21,155
and his small staff
who prepared this study.

1201
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,699
Clerk, would you call the roll?

1202
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,078
- Mr. Udall?
- Yay.

1203
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:31,081
- Mr. Rubio?
- Nay.

1204
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,834
- Mr. Rockefeller?
- Yay.

1205
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,295
- Mr. Warner?
- Yay.

1206
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,297
- Mr. Blunt?
- Nay.

1207
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,216
- Mr. Conrad?
- Yay.

1208
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,510
- Mr. Coats?
- Nay.

1209
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:45,846
- Mr. Nelson?
- Yay.

1210
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,307
- Mr. Risch?
- Nay.

1211
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,893
- Ms. Mikulski?
- Yay.

1212
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,145
- Mr. Burr?
- Nay.

1213
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,606
- Mr. Wyden?
- Yay.

1214
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:58,066
- Ms. Snowe?
- Yay.

1215
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:02,070
- Mr. Chambliss?
- Nay.

1216
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:04,239
Ms. Feinstein?

1217
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:06,700
Yay.

1218
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,662
The motion passes.

1219
01:03:10,746 --> 01:03:15,751
The report will now be sent
to the CIA for final comments.

1220
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,423
I, John Owen Brennan,

1221
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:23,634
do solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the full truth,

1222
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,094
and nothing but the truth,
so help me God.

1223
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:28,764
Thank you, Mr. Brennan.

1224
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,016
I look forward
to hearing your testimony.

1225
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,730
I am honored
to appear before you today

1226
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,734
as the president’s nominee
for director of the CIA.

1227
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:44,530
I’d like to say from
the beginning that honesty...

1228
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:48,033
truthfulness... was a value
inculcated in me

1229
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:51,078
growing up in New Jersey by
my parents, Owen and Dorothy.

1230
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,205
Now, none of us
are perfect beings.

1231
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:55,290
I am far from perfect.

1232
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:57,501
But I will be honest
with this committee

1233
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,127
and do everything possible

1234
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:02,464
to meet your legitimate needs
and requirements.

1235
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:04,007
Mr. Brennan,

1236
01:04:04,091 --> 01:04:06,718
I’ve long believed that our
government has an obligation

1237
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:10,847
to the American people to face
its mistakes transparently,

1238
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:13,892
to help the public understand
the nature of those mistakes,

1239
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:16,270
and to correct them.

1240
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:20,274
The enhanced interrogation
techniques were brutal,

1241
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:23,026
and, perhaps most importantly,
they did not work.

1242
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:26,029
Now, the CIA has
a responsibility

1243
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:28,490
to correct any inaccurate
information it provided

1244
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,659
to the previous White House,
the Department of Justice,

1245
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:32,536
Congress and the public.

1246
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,913
So, here’s my question:

1247
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:38,208
Do you agree that the CIA
has this responsibility?

1248
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:40,794
And I’d appreciate
a yes or no answer.

1249
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:46,008
Yes, Senator.

1250
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:47,634
Absolutely.

1251
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,846
Office of the chief of staff.

1252
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,973
Mr. McDonough is
in a meeting right now.

1253
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:55,309
According to the latest NBC
News/Wall Street Journal poll,

1254
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:58,895
the president’s
approval rating is at 44%.

1255
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:00,439
That’s up three points since March...

1256
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,441
Excuse me. Mr. McDonough.

1257
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,985
- Director Brennan is here.
- Oh.

1258
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,320
There he is.

1259
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,488
- Congratulations, Mr. Director.
- Thank you.

1260
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:09,990
Welcome. Come on in.
Thank you.

1261
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:12,200
Thank you
and thank President Obama.

1262
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:13,952
I’ll let him know.

1263
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:16,121
Speaking of, uh,

1264
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,624
he wanted me to ask you
if there’s any new information

1265
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:21,084
on the drone strikes
of April 29th?

1266
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:24,588
We can confirm
that the Al Qaeda planner

1267
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,633
Abu Sulayman al-Jazairi
has been killed.

1268
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:30,260
Unfortunately, we also believe

1269
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:34,348
that there were between five
and ten civilian casualties.

1270
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:35,849
Shit.

1271
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,143
Well, I’ll let
the president know.

1272
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:40,228
What about the
Intelligence Committee report?

1273
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:41,772
We need to talk about that.

1274
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,691
John, w-we gave the CIA
until February

1275
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:47,152
to come up with its response;
it’s now May.

1276
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:49,154
I’ve got Senator Feinstein
all over my phone sheet.

1277
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:51,531
I don’t want to be the one
who has to push on this,

1278
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,284
but the president would really
like to get this behind us.

1279
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:01,541
And?

1280
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,960
We acknowledge that

1281
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:06,630
the Detention and Interrogation
Program had shortcomings

1282
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,965
and that the Agency
made mistakes.

1283
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,717
The most serious of those
occurred early on

1284
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:13,428
and stemmed from the fact
that we were unprepared.

1285
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:18,642
Now, as you know, we part ways
on some key points.

1286
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:22,062
According to our review,
indications are that

1287
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,314
interrogations of
detainees upon whom

1288
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:27,109
the enhanced interrogation
techniques were used

1289
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:30,529
did produce unique intelligence

1290
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:32,364
that helped
thwart attack plans,

1291
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:34,408
capture terrorists,
and saved lives.

1292
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:35,951
Excuse me, intelligence
gathered from EITs...

1293
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:38,245
And that intelligence
continues to inform

1294
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,038
our counterterrorism efforts.

1295
01:06:40,122 --> 01:06:41,623
It led us to bin Laden.

1296
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,585
Now, it’s one thing
to disapprove of the program.

1297
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,295
I-I welcome that conversation,

1298
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:49,005
but it’s something else
altogether

1299
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:50,632
to say that it was
mismanaged and ineffective.

1300
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:51,842
Excuse me, Director Brennan.

1301
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:54,553
The report is
based on CIA records.

1302
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:57,180
CIA officers themselves
called it ineffective.

1303
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:58,890
CIA officers?

1304
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:01,393
Well, you didn’t speak to any
CIA officers in the program,

1305
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:02,644
did you, Dan?

1306
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:05,105
Your lawyers would not
make them available to us

1307
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:08,775
because of the Department
of Justice’s criminal inquiry.

1308
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:11,862
We also disagree with
the study’s characterization of

1309
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:16,283
how the CIA briefed Congress,
the White House and the press.

1310
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,785
Now, we have documentation
that certainly proves that.

1311
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,287
Excuse me, sir, what documents?

1312
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,663
If the director is referencing

1313
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:23,540
cables or e-mails
we were never shown,

1314
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,167
then that’s a violation
of our agreement.

1315
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,753
Everything was supposed
to have been provided to us.

1316
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:29,755
Do we just give
the committee access

1317
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:31,715
to the entire
CIA computer system?

1318
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,633
Is that where this goes?

1319
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:37,095
Dan gets to read every e-mail,
gets to see every document?

1320
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:40,265
Every relevant document
or e-mail, yes.

1321
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,228
I have always supported
the intelligence community.

1322
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:50,066
I broke with my own party
to support the drone program,

1323
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,986
but what this report
makes very clear

1324
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,656
is a real need for oversight
and accountability.

1325
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,618
You asked for our response,
and we gave it to you.

1326
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:02,078
We looked in the mirror.

1327
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:05,040
Now, uh, we made mistakes.

1328
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:08,502
There were abuses, and those
abuses have been addressed.

1329
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:11,963
But I-I vehemently disagree
with the narrative

1330
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:14,049
that you’re trying
to string together here.

1331
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,759
It lacks context.

1332
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,719
It does not paint
an accurate picture

1333
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:19,888
of the work that was done.

1334
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,556
Let’s go.

1335
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,518
Senator, John Brennan’s
name is in that report.

1336
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,269
He was Director Tenet’s
chief of staff

1337
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:27,646
and then
deputy executive director

1338
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,272
when the program started.

1339
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:30,941
- He grew up at the Agency.
- He claims to have

1340
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,651
- spoken out against the EIT program...
- Where?

1341
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,736
I just spent five years
looking at their e-mails.

1342
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,613
I never found anything
to suggest that’s true.

1343
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:38,949
Well, we knew
this wasn’t going to be easy.

1344
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:42,035
They have their own narrative,
and they’re gonna stick to it.

1345
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,912
Maybe we could come up
with some middle ground,

1346
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,122
- find some common language.
- I thought our job

1347
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:47,707
was to provide oversight
and accountability,

1348
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,626
not middle ground.

1349
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:52,504
I have a question for you.

1350
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:55,090
Do you work for me
or for the report?

1351
01:08:56,591 --> 01:09:01,012
And I’d encourage you to think
about that before answering.

1352
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,569
McDONOUGH:
Dan!

1353
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,696
Dan Jones.

1354
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,030
There he is.

1355
01:09:19,114 --> 01:09:20,949
Look at you, chief investigator

1356
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:23,410
of the largest study
the Senate’s ever conducted.

1357
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,036
My God. How you doing?

1358
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,955
It’s good to see you
in the fresh air.

1359
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:28,373
- Yeah.
- It’s so funny.

1360
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:29,958
I was just thinking
the other night,

1361
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,544
do you remember that time
you came and saw me,

1362
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,170
right after
you got out of school?

1363
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:36,214
You said go get
intel experience,

1364
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:37,883
wait till the Dems
got the Senate back.

1365
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:39,217
And look at you now:

1366
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:40,844
working for the
Senate Intelligence Committee

1367
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:42,387
for Dianne Feinstein.

1368
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,097
You told me once you wanted
to make a difference.

1369
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,807
I hope you still
get that chance.

1370
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:47,767
- What does that mean?
- What does that mean?

1371
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:51,605
It means, Dan, get out of the
senator’s head about the CIA.

1372
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:53,607
You’re not doing yourself
any favors.

1373
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,150
Have you read the report?

1374
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:58,403
It’s 7,000 pages, Dan.

1375
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:02,240
The Bible tells the history
of mankind in less than that.

1376
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:05,744
Look, buddy,

1377
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,495
we’re gonna get the CIA
to sit down with you,

1378
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:09,956
tell you
their side of the story.

1379
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,667
It would help
if you would listen.

1380
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:16,463
The study seems
to most seriously diverge

1381
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:19,507
from the facts by asking
the reader to believe

1382
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:21,801
the CIA withheld information

1383
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,845
from the executive branch
and Congress.

1384
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:27,057
We’d like to see that
removed from the report.

1385
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,142
After the photos of
Abu Ghraib came out in 2004,

1386
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,478
Deputy Director McLaughlin
appeared before Congress,

1387
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:34,439
in front of you, and said
the CIA is not authorized

1388
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:36,816
to do anything like what
you’ve seen in those photos.

1389
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,860
But what they were doing
was even worse.

1390
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:40,862
Then in 2005,
Senator Rockefeller

1391
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:42,656
called for a review
of the program,

1392
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,699
and the deputy chief
of Counterterrorism

1393
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,493
got nervous
where that might lead.

1394
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,787
So he sent a message
to senior leadership

1395
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,373
discussing the need
to manage the situation.

1396
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:55,293
He said, "We either get out
and sell, or we get hammered.

1397
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:58,338
Congress reads it,
cuts our authorities,

1398
01:10:58,421 --> 01:10:59,798
messes up our budget.

1399
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,132
We need to make sure

1400
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:03,593
the impression of
what we do is positive."

1401
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:06,262
This is the deputy chief
of Counterterrorism.

1402
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:08,848
That all stays in.

1403
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:11,059
We fundamentally disagree
with the assertion

1404
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:13,979
that the program was
poorly managed and executed

1405
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:17,565
and that unqualified officers
imposed brutal conditions,

1406
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:20,652
used unapproved techniques, and
were rarely held accountable.

1407
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,862
What about Mitchell and Jessen?

1408
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:26,658
Mitchell’s PhD thesis
was on diet and exercise

1409
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:28,368
for controlling hypertension.

1410
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:30,412
Jessen’s dissertation
was on family therapy,

1411
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:31,997
something called
family sculpting,

1412
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,082
where you make clay figures
of your family members.

1413
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,792
- No. How much were they paid?
- They had no experience

1414
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,043
in real-world interrogations.

1415
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:38,586
No science
to back up their claims.

1416
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:39,963
They were allowed to assess

1417
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,840
the effectiveness
of their own program

1418
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:43,842
without providing
any scientific evidence.

1419
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,385
How much in total

1420
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,555
did the U.S. taxpayers
give them for their work?

1421
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,515
Over $80 million.

1422
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,394
The Agency also disagrees that

1423
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:57,605
the Detention and Interrogation
Program did not produce

1424
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,566
unique intelligence
that disrupted plots

1425
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,860
and saved lives.

1426
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,154
For instance,
the identity of José Padilla,

1427
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:06,031
the "dirty bomber."

1428
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:07,615
If we hadn’t stopped Padilla,

1429
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:11,161
this entire area
would be radioactive today.

1430
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:12,871
José Padilla!

1431
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:15,790
Padilla found the instructions
for his dirty bomb online,

1432
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:19,252
in-in an article entitled
"Making and owning an H-bomb

1433
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,422
is the kind of challenge
real Americans seek."

1434
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:25,383
It says,
"Fill two buckets with uranium

1435
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:28,595
and swing them above your head
as fast as possible."

1436
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,055
It was a joke.

1437
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:31,639
As far as we can tell,

1438
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:34,059
everything they attribute
to EITs they already had,

1439
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:36,770
from other sources,
from foreign governments,

1440
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,313
from other methods.

1441
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:40,899
They claim they saved lives,
but what they really did

1442
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:42,692
was make it impossible
to prosecute

1443
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:45,945
a mass murderer like KSM,
because if what we did to him

1444
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:48,823
ever came out in a court
of law, the case is over.

1445
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:52,077
The guy planned 9/11,
and instead of going to jail

1446
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,537
for the rest of his life,
the CIA turned him into

1447
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:57,791
a recruiting tool
for a war we’re still fighting.

1448
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:03,671
Stop meeting with them.

1449
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:13,223
This is a remarkable document
you’ve created.

1450
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,058
Truly.

1451
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:18,645
It will provide
an enduring history,

1452
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:21,397
whether it comes out or not.

1453
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,780
What does that mean, "w-whether
it comes out or not"?

1454
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,116
What does she mean?

1455
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,742
What does that mean?

1456
01:13:32,826 --> 01:13:34,369
We’ve been working on this
thing for nearly five years.

1457
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:37,956
Yes, and it is still
our word against theirs.

1458
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,624
She’s gonna need
more than that.

1459
01:13:56,683 --> 01:13:57,851
This is Jones.

1460
01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:59,602
Hey, Dan, this is Evan Tanner.

1461
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:03,231
Um, I hear rumors the report
might not be coming out now.

1462
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,024
A lot of pushback
from the Agency.

1463
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:07,944
- They’re calling it "flawed."
- Who told you that?

1464
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:11,072
Dan, I’m the
national security reporter

1465
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:12,448
for The New York Times.

1466
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,492
Do you have any thoughts?

1467
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:17,829
It’s not
my place to talk about rumors.

1468
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:19,414
No, I didn’t think you would.

1469
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,499
I was wondering
if you might want to comment.

1470
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:25,128
Uh, it can be off the record.

1471
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:29,174
I just think we can
help each other here.

1472
01:14:29,257 --> 01:14:31,843
You know I can’t do that.

1473
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:36,681
And here’s what we know
about Caroline Krass:

1474
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:38,266
20 years
in the executive branch,

1475
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:39,809
including the
Office of Legal Counsel

1476
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:41,477
where she worked with John Yoo.

1477
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:44,189
Guys, this
confirmation’s a done deal.

1478
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:46,065
We’re not gonna stop it.

1479
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:49,986
But it is a public hearing,
and it just seems like

1480
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:52,030
there’s an opportunity
to say something.

1481
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,782
Wh-What are you
looking for, Senator?

1482
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:57,368
I don’t know, something
to move the study forward,

1483
01:14:57,452 --> 01:15:00,371
to break us
out of this stalemate.

1484
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:03,958
Any ideas?

1485
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,715
Senator, there is a document.

1486
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:51,923
You ever sleep, bro?

1487
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:53,883
I used to.

1488
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:55,843
Got in the way of work.

1489
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:58,638
Anything in that bag contain
the real names of CIA officers,

1490
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,848
assets or partners,
or any information

1491
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:03,101
that would be in violation
of the agreement between

1492
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,895
the Central Intelligence Agency
and the United States Senate?

1493
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:08,690
- Have a good night, Jay.
- You, too, Dan.

1494
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:03,328
The committee
will come to order.

1495
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,707
Today, we are gathered
for the confirmation hearing

1496
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:12,378
of Caroline Krass to be
general counsel of the CIA.

1497
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:14,964
Welcome, Ms. Krass.

1498
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:17,216
I’m honored to be here
before the committee,

1499
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,178
and I’d like to take this
moment to acknowledge my family

1500
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,638
and thank them
for their support.

1501
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,140
Thank you.

1502
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,809
Uh, before we begin,
I would like to remind members

1503
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,395
not to discuss
classified topics

1504
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:33,483
or ask questions which require
a classified answer.

1505
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:36,444
With that said,
I turn to Senator Udall.

1506
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:38,446
Ms. Krass,
nice to see you again.

1507
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,239
We had a chance
to sit down last week

1508
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:41,616
and discuss the Senate’s study

1509
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,993
on the Detention
and Interrogation Program.

1510
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:49,415
You told me you found the study
to be hard reading.

1511
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:51,459
Also, last week,
a number of articles appeared

1512
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,503
discussing
the one-year anniversary

1513
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:55,505
of the vote to approve
the committee’s study.

1514
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:57,548
And in one of those articles,

1515
01:17:57,632 --> 01:18:01,469
the CIA claimed to have found
significant errors.

1516
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:04,555
Now, I got to tell you, I don’t
believe that is accurate.

1517
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:07,767
In fact,
I’m more confident than ever

1518
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:11,771
in the factual accuracy
of the committee’s study.

1519
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:16,025
I want to say that again:
I’m more confident than ever.

1520
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:19,445
It appears that the CIA
performed their own study

1521
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:24,033
of the EIT program, initiated
by former Director Panetta.

1522
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:26,452
And the findings

1523
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:28,871
in that review
are entirely consistent

1524
01:18:28,955 --> 01:18:33,167
with our committee’s report,
but amazingly conflicts with

1525
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:35,336
the CIA’s official response
to that report.

1526
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:41,634
So, why is a review
the CIA conducted internally,

1527
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:45,680
and never revealed to Congress,
so different from

1528
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:49,350
the CIA’s formal response
to the committee’s report?

1529
01:18:49,434 --> 01:18:51,644
Do you have an answer for that?

1530
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:56,065
Um, not at this time.

1531
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:04,490
If I wanted the public to know
about the Panetta review,

1532
01:19:04,574 --> 01:19:06,159
I would have told them myself.

1533
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:07,743
We hear that the Republicans

1534
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:09,245
are gonna censure Udall
for that performance.

1535
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:10,746
But the review
proves our point.

1536
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,373
They found
the same things we did.

1537
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:14,500
The Agency didn’t know
how or where to hold people,

1538
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:16,210
didn’t know
how to interrogate people,

1539
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:18,588
and, more importantly,
the CIA did give it to us.

1540
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:21,007
I don’t know
if it was an accident

1541
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,550
or it was a whistle-blower.

1542
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:24,093
Well, if it was
a whistle-blower,

1543
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:26,554
you may have just exposed them.

1544
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:28,848
Not to mention yourself.

1545
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,949
We got something here.

1546
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,951
The director
has asked me here today

1547
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:32,411
in my capacity
as Agency legal counsel.

1548
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:36,999
What we have to discuss
has serious implications.

1549
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:38,209
All right.

1550
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:39,669
We have proof that the staff

1551
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,420
of the Senate
Intelligence Committee

1552
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:44,006
illegally gained access
to the CIA’s computer network

1553
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,008
and obtained
classified documents.

1554
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:48,261
What kind of proof?

1555
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,012
We found the document
in question

1556
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:52,014
on Daniel Jones’s computer.

1557
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:55,226
We did not provide it to him
or to the committee.

1558
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:59,188
If he didn’t hack us,
how did it get there?

1559
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:02,817
We feel that Jones and his team
need to be disciplined.

1560
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:06,571
Immediate dismissal
is in order,

1561
01:21:06,654 --> 01:21:09,115
at a minimum, I would think.

1562
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:14,662
John, are you saying that you
broke into the computer system

1563
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:16,414
of the United States Senate?

1564
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:18,207
We never gave you clearance
on that document.

1565
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:22,044
It was classified, yet
you chose to make it public.

1566
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:23,671
We’ve made our investigation
and our findings

1567
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:24,839
known to the White House.

1568
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:27,675
You’re fucking kidding me.

1569
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,928
They’re saying I broke into

1570
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:34,015
the most top secret
computer system in the world?

1571
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,183
- Brennan and Eastman came over...
- Eastman?

1572
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:38,102
Eastman’s name is in the report
over a thousand times.

1573
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:40,605
- That’s not a conflict?
- Dan.

1574
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:43,441
They filed a criminal referral
against you.

1575
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:45,901
They want you gone.

1576
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,574
H-How did the Agency
come to the conclusion

1577
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:52,825
that I’m a hacker?

1578
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,660
H-How do they even know
what’s on my computer?

1579
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:56,495
They say
they conducted a search.

1580
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,039
Of the United States Senate?

1581
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,874
The whole reason
this committee was established

1582
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:01,876
in the first place
was to stop the CIA

1583
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,252
from spying on U.S. citizens.

1584
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:04,879
The senator is talking
to Harry Reid about

1585
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:06,631
- that very thing...
- Did they go into that room?

1586
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:08,549
That room is off-limits. Did
they go into that fucking room?

1587
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,301
I don’t know.

1588
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:13,262
I don’t know.

1589
01:22:14,889 --> 01:22:17,433
I do know that the Republicans
are gonna run with this.

1590
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:19,477
They’re gonna use it
to discredit the report.

1591
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,937
They’re gonna
use it to discredit you.

1592
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:26,067
Dan, they’re accusing you
of breaking the law.

1593
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,735
You’re gonna need a lawyer.

1594
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:34,992
There’s a saying at the Agency:

1595
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:36,369
"Admit nothing,

1596
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:38,537
deny everything,
make counteraccusations."

1597
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:40,748
That’s what they’re doing.

1598
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,708
The CIA is
investigating you for...

1599
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:44,877
They’re the ones who
should be investigated, not me.

1600
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,546
Mr. Jones?
Mr. Clifford will see you now.

1601
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,173
Our computer system

1602
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:52,051
isn’t even connected
to the CIA mainframe.

1603
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:53,844
So did I just
go over to Langley

1604
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:55,096
and break in on a weekend?

1605
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,972
Seems unlikely.

1606
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:58,974
So what evidence do they have?

1607
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:01,060
A document.

1608
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,480
A document?
What kind of a document?

1609
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:08,984
I can’t tell you that.

1610
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:12,029
Because, what, it’s classified?

1611
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:14,198
I was tasked
to lead an investigation

1612
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:16,701
into a CIA program
they started after 9/11,

1613
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:19,036
what they called
enhanced interrogation.

1614
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,124
And I assume your work
is critical of the Agency?

1615
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,795
You know, Dan, a lot of people
in this country

1616
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:29,505
felt the CIA was
justified in doing

1617
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,465
whatever they had to do
to keep us safe.

1618
01:23:31,549 --> 01:23:33,801
I have friends
who lost people that day.

1619
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,470
And a lot of people watch 24
on Thursday nights

1620
01:23:36,554 --> 01:23:38,139
and hear Jack Bauer say,

1621
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:39,765
"I don’t want to bypass
the Constitution,

1622
01:23:39,849 --> 01:23:41,559
but these are
extraordinary circumstances,"

1623
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:43,978
just before, you know,
he s-sticks a knife in them

1624
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,604
and makes them give up a plot.

1625
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,606
It-it doesn’t work that way.

1626
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:52,027
Well, as
Winston Churchill said,

1627
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:55,030
"History is written
by the victors."

1628
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,452
Churchill didn’t really
say that; Hermann Goring did.

1629
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,829
And what he said was,
"We will go down in history

1630
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:03,706
either as the world’s
greatest statesmen

1631
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:05,374
or its worst villains."

1632
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:08,753
So your report is
gonna determine that:

1633
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:10,504
statesmen or villains?

1634
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:17,595
How long have you been
working on this project, Dan?

1635
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:19,805
Five years.

1636
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:22,683
Five years,
and it could all go away,

1637
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:26,395
just vanish in the face
of these allegations.

1638
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:27,897
I can certainly imagine

1639
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,608
an ambitious young man
like yourself spends years

1640
01:24:30,691 --> 01:24:33,861
with his head buried
in some terrible spectacle,

1641
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:36,071
gets frustrated
with the process,

1642
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:38,908
sees an opportunity
to get the truth out faster,

1643
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,242
maybe crosses a line.

1644
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:41,911
I’m assuming this is
the most important thing

1645
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:43,746
- you’ve ever been a part of.
- I didn’t do it.

1646
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:45,456
Or I can see
an equally ambitious senator

1647
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:46,749
encouraging you
to do something.

1648
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,501
Now would be
a good time to tell me.

1649
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:49,919
That did not happen.

1650
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:51,796
What I did, I did on my own.
I acted alone.

1651
01:24:51,879 --> 01:24:53,631
- So you did steal the document?
- I did not steal it.

1652
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,007
- You needed it to...
- I relocated it.

1653
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,175
I put it in a safe.

1654
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,302
If they had a way
of destroying tapes,

1655
01:24:58,385 --> 01:24:59,845
- then surely they could get...
- Everyone has their own words.

1656
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:01,597
The language is built
to choose sides.

1657
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,974
Now, why did you relocate it?

1658
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,856
Documents had a way of
disappearing off the server.

1659
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:14,443
For instance, in 2010,
over 800 documents

1660
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:17,488
just vanished
without any explanation.

1661
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:20,199
So you had computer issues
all along.

1662
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:23,160
Who else knew
what was on the computers?

1663
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:25,996
Well, the CIA hired an outside
firm to vet the documents:

1664
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,331
CENTRA.

1665
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:29,333
And CACI was also involved.

1666
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:31,210
- Who are they?
- Contractors.

1667
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:33,087
But Jim Pavitt
is on their board.

1668
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,007
Former deputy director
of operations for the CIA,

1669
01:25:37,091 --> 01:25:40,261
Jim Pavitt, during the program,
Jim Pavitt.

1670
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:42,179
And is he named in the report?

1671
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:44,765
Can’t tell me.

1672
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:48,727
So they can’t destroy
the document.

1673
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:51,897
Then they can go after
the next best thing: you.

1674
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:54,108
Make you a zealot.

1675
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:57,278
Anything you touch is tainted.

1676
01:25:57,361 --> 01:25:59,780
I could see the Agency saying
that this is a violation

1677
01:25:59,864 --> 01:26:04,577
of the Espionage Act, the...
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,

1678
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,871
uh, who knows what else.

1679
01:26:06,954 --> 01:26:08,873
And if they file
a charge against me,

1680
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,749
how long could I go away for?

1681
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:13,836
I don’t know.
20 years, maybe more.

1682
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:27,474
I did not hack into
the CIA computer system.

1683
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:33,480
I mean, my com... my computer
skills stop at Microsoft Word.

1684
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:35,274
They probably know that.

1685
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:36,859
Let me ask you something:

1686
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,194
How much does
a Senate staffer make?

1687
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:41,030
At my level?
About-about a hundred grand.

1688
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,657
Any retirement, savings,
family money?

1689
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:45,951
No.

1690
01:26:46,035 --> 01:26:48,454
So, we should discuss
my retainer.

1691
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,915
- How much is that?
- $30,000 to start.

1692
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:53,584
And if it goes to trial,
add a zero.

1693
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:56,795
Nothing could make them happier

1694
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:59,298
than knowing you’re
sitting here talking to me.

1695
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:00,925
That’s what they want, Dan.

1696
01:27:01,008 --> 01:27:05,179
Make you bleed money
all over my floor.

1697
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:08,265
Do you want my expert opinion,
for free?

1698
01:27:08,349 --> 01:27:11,769
You don’t really have
a legal problem.

1699
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:14,063
You have a sunlight problem.

1700
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:17,775
I’m sure you know people
who can help you solve it.

1701
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,248
Daniel Jones.

1702
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:34,708
I didn’t think
you’d ever return my calls.

1703
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:36,210
Does your boss know
you’re talking to

1704
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:38,003
a guy with a byline
and a tape recorder?

1705
01:27:38,087 --> 01:27:39,338
There’s something going on
I think you should look into.

1706
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:41,715
It involves the Agency.

1707
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:45,928
Okay. Is it that report
you’ve been working on,

1708
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,596
the one that
never quite comes out?

1709
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,557
Computers. It has to do with
the hacking of computers.

1710
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:52,977
All right, whose?

1711
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,939
The United States Senate.

1712
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:59,358
Someone hacked into the Senate?

1713
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:03,153
No shit? Okay.

1714
01:28:03,237 --> 01:28:06,240
You have any idea if it was
foreign or domestic?

1715
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:08,033
Uh, all right, yes, you...

1716
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,702
sorry, you said
it was the Agency.

1717
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,787
So what-what does the CIA

1718
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,247
have to do with
U.S. Senate computers?

1719
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:14,623
Evan, you’re the
national security reporter

1720
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:15,666
for The New York Times.

1721
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:18,460
You can figure it out.
All right?

1722
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,881
Hmm.

1723
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:25,050
Morning, Senator.

1724
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:26,593
You wanted to see me?

1725
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:28,595
You know anything about this?

1726
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:33,017
"Computer Searches at Center
of Dispute on CIA Detentions."

1727
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,977
You have any idea
how that ended up

1728
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,895
- in The New York Times?
- Yeah, I saw that.

1729
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:38,522
It looks accurate.

1730
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:41,400
Senator McCain is already
calling the CIA a rogue agency.

1731
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:42,776
What are your thoughts on

1732
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:45,446
someone like
Edward Snowden, Dan?

1733
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:48,323
W-Well, Senator, I know
how you feel about leaks.

1734
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:50,993
I think he’s a traitor,
plain and simple.

1735
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,828
It’s my job
to provide oversight

1736
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,455
with the tools of governance,

1737
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:57,416
not lights and cameras
and headlines.

1738
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:03,714
Do you want me to resign?

1739
01:29:07,426 --> 01:29:09,261
No.

1740
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,222
But I think I might need you
to write me a speech.

1741
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:18,353
Senator Feinstein claimed today

1742
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:21,732
on the Senate floor
that the CIA hacked

1743
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:23,609
the Senate Intelligence
Committee’s computers

1744
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:26,153
to thwart an investigation
into past practices.

1745
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:27,654
Can you respond to that?

1746
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:31,116
Well, first,
we in no way, shape or form

1747
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,161
tried to thwart
the release of the report.

1748
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:36,830
Uh, we want that behind us.

1749
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:39,666
As far as this allegation
that the CIA

1750
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:42,503
somehow hacked into
the Senate computer system,

1751
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:46,548
nothing could be
further from the truth.

1752
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:49,009
We just wouldn’t do that.

1753
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:51,095
It’s beyond
the scope of reason.

1754
01:30:01,647 --> 01:30:03,398
Thank you.

1755
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:05,192
I understand
your position, Senator,

1756
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:07,736
and I am aware of
Director Brennan’s comments.

1757
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,780
Did you hear what Lindsey
Graham said this morning,

1758
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:12,741
about the Agency
breaking into our computers?

1759
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:15,994
"The legislative branch
should declare war on the CIA.

1760
01:30:16,078 --> 01:30:19,665
Heads should roll,
people should go to jail."

1761
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:23,085
Is that what you want?
Send people to jail?

1762
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:25,796
We do have jails for a reason.

1763
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:28,048
The Justice Department
investigated the CIA,

1764
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:29,883
and they decided
not to prosecute.

1765
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:32,177
It’s their call, not ours.

1766
01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:34,638
Now, when this administration
took office,

1767
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:36,265
we faced
the very real possibility

1768
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:38,767
of economic collapse.

1769
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:40,310
We had a decision to make:

1770
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:42,604
Do we spend our political
capital on going around

1771
01:30:42,688 --> 01:30:45,440
trying to find people to blame,
or do we solve the problem?

1772
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,359
Maybe the way
to solve the problem

1773
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,778
is to hold people accountable.

1774
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:52,489
Do you ever wonder
why history repeats itself?

1775
01:30:52,573 --> 01:30:54,116
Well, I think
maybe it’s because

1776
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:55,742
we don’t always listen
the first time.

1777
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:59,204
Senator, the people at the
Agency... they have families.

1778
01:30:59,288 --> 01:31:02,166
There are children
who might lose a parent.

1779
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:09,173
Years ago, some radical group
put a bomb in the flower box

1780
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:12,551
outside of my daughter’s
bedroom window, right out here.

1781
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:15,429
Had it been any warmer out,
it would have exploded.

1782
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:16,889
And then there was the time

1783
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:21,018
that I found Harvey Milk
shot to death in his office.

1784
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:24,062
I-I think I’m aware of
the risks of public service.

1785
01:31:24,146 --> 01:31:27,274
President Obama
ended the torture program

1786
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:29,735
three days after taking office.

1787
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:34,406
The EITs, what the CIA did...
that is not our mess.

1788
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,991
No, it’s not,

1789
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:39,578
but that’s not the question
we’re asking, is it?

1790
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:43,957
The question we’re asking is:
Who is going to clean it up?

1791
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:45,626
So let’s do that.

1792
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:50,505
Right after Director Brennan
apologizes to me and my staff.

1793
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:53,842
The inspector general is here.

1794
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:55,636
Go ahead in.

1795
01:31:55,719 --> 01:31:59,681
In regards to the CIA
search of Senate computers,

1796
01:31:59,765 --> 01:32:01,642
we’ve looked into the matter

1797
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:04,937
and have recommended
that the Department of Justice

1798
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,980
begin a criminal investigation.

1799
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:08,023
Good.

1800
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:09,816
So have we.

1801
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:12,277
Dan Jones,
lead Senate investigator.

1802
01:32:12,361 --> 01:32:14,947
Not the Senate staff.

1803
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,823
The CIA.

1804
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:18,492
Us?

1805
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:22,079
Are-are you accusing me or
my staff of breaking the law?

1806
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:24,289
My understanding is
that five CIA employees

1807
01:32:24,373 --> 01:32:27,125
entered a room
that was off-limits.

1808
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:28,335
On whose orders?

1809
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,587
Senator Feinstein
is right to call this

1810
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:32,714
a violation of
the separation of powers.

1811
01:32:32,798 --> 01:32:37,302
The CIA cannot spy
on the U.S. Congress.

1812
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:41,765
As inspector general,
I’m gonna have to launch

1813
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:45,978
a full investigation
into the Agency’s actions.

1814
01:33:05,998 --> 01:33:07,374
Am I going to jail?

1815
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:09,501
No, they’re
dropping the charges.

1816
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,295
You’re going back to work.

1817
01:33:11,378 --> 01:33:14,047
Take the most important
findings, finish the summary...

1818
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:15,674
no more than 400 pages.

1819
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:19,636
I’m going to ask the committee
to vote to release it.

1820
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:27,477
McDONOUGH:
So, you saw they voted.

1821
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:29,062
11 to three.

1822
01:33:29,146 --> 01:33:31,398
They want to release
an executive summary.

1823
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:33,817
That thing goes out,
it puts my people in danger,

1824
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:36,695
who are out there
in a dangerous world today,

1825
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:38,155
trying to do their jobs.

1826
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:39,865
Pulls the rug
out from under them.

1827
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:43,035
Anything that you feel
puts your people in harm’s way

1828
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:44,369
stays classified.

1829
01:33:44,453 --> 01:33:47,247
My concern is this:
If-if the Senate puts out

1830
01:33:47,331 --> 01:33:49,249
a small pile of pages
and the press goes nuts,

1831
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:52,419
then everybody’s gonna want
to see a bigger pile of pages.

1832
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:54,880
You keep saying the president
wants to turn the page.

1833
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:57,049
Well, then turn the page.

1834
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,426
Close the damn book.

1835
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,267
Senator Feinstein
has asked the White House

1836
01:34:07,351 --> 01:34:10,645
to head up final comments
and redactions.

1837
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:13,815
She wants us
right in the middle of it.

1838
01:34:13,899 --> 01:34:15,192
And?

1839
01:34:15,275 --> 01:34:19,112
And I think that’s exactly
where you want us.

1840
01:34:19,196 --> 01:34:21,365
You’ll have the pen.

1841
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:24,826
Leadership specified

1842
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:27,162
that we should redact
anything that could result in

1843
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:28,914
legal exposure
for officers in the field,

1844
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:30,916
past or present.

1845
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:35,045
Basically, if there’s
any questions, black it out.

1846
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:43,011
You see this?

1847
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:52,604
What the...

1848
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:54,981
fuck is this?

1849
01:34:58,485 --> 01:34:59,861
Good afternoon. Where’s Marcy?

1850
01:34:59,945 --> 01:35:01,029
Conference room.

1851
01:35:01,113 --> 01:35:02,739
Early the next week.

1852
01:35:02,823 --> 01:35:05,033
Wednesday.

1853
01:35:05,117 --> 01:35:06,410
Yeah, that’ll work.

1854
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:09,204
And you get me the agenda.
Thank you.

1855
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,375
Imagine you pick up a book,

1856
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:16,420
and "blank" turns water
into wine on page 237,

1857
01:35:16,503 --> 01:35:19,297
and on page 71
"blank" heals a leper,

1858
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:22,676
and on page 295
"blank" rises from the dead.

1859
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:25,053
How do you know the blanks
are all the same person?

1860
01:35:25,137 --> 01:35:27,722
I thought that the CIA
agreed to using pseudonyms.

1861
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:30,600
They did, but now even
the fake names are gone.

1862
01:35:30,684 --> 01:35:33,061
And the dates.

1863
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,857
The entire story is gone.

1864
01:35:44,281 --> 01:35:47,200
I hope you took
your strong pills today.

1865
01:35:48,827 --> 01:35:51,455
McDONOUGH: Isn’t it enough
to know what actually happened?

1866
01:35:51,538 --> 01:35:53,999
Do we need to know the names
of the people involved?

1867
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:55,792
But the actual names
aren’t in the report.

1868
01:35:55,876 --> 01:35:57,836
Someone could figure out
who our people are

1869
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,004
based on their pseudonyms.

1870
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,922
You know, I found
a photo of my husband

1871
01:36:01,006 --> 01:36:02,924
on the Internet
linking him to me.

1872
01:36:03,008 --> 01:36:04,468
Secrecy is very hard
to maintain.

1873
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:06,219
I believe you introduced
your husband publicly

1874
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:07,637
at your confirmation hearing.

1875
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:08,722
It was on C-SPAN.

1876
01:36:08,805 --> 01:36:10,265
Some of these people...

1877
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:12,392
they are out there
in the world, right now.

1878
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:13,477
Yes, they are.

1879
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,103
There’s an officer
from Alec Station

1880
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:17,230
mentioned 41 times
in 500 pages.

1881
01:36:17,314 --> 01:36:19,232
In 1998, her team
missed the bombing

1882
01:36:19,316 --> 01:36:22,027
of the U.S. embassy
in Kenya and Tanzania.

1883
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,403
1999, they missed the bombing

1884
01:36:23,487 --> 01:36:25,238
of the Marriott Hotel
in Islamabad.

1885
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:28,909
In 2000, she was made aware
of two Al Qaeda operatives

1886
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:30,744
who arrived in Los Angeles.

1887
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:32,370
FBI officers, working within
the bin Laden unit,

1888
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:33,914
requested permission
to investigate.

1889
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,624
That’s not how
we want to play it.

1890
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:38,043
The CIA knew
they were on American soil

1891
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,961
and didn’t do anything.

1892
01:36:40,045 --> 01:36:42,297
Al-Mihdhar then left the States
to play a key role

1893
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,924
in the bombing of the USS Cole,

1894
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:47,010
before returning to hijack
Flight 77 with al-Hazmi

1895
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:48,678
and crash into the Pentagon.

1896
01:36:48,762 --> 01:36:51,097
And you want to
protect this person’s identity.

1897
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:52,641
We’d also like to redact

1898
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:54,309
the pseudonyms
of the contractors.

1899
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:58,021
Dr. Mitchell was already quoted
by name in The New Yorker.

1900
01:36:58,104 --> 01:37:00,815
He was handing out brochures
at professional conferences

1901
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:03,026
telling people
he worked for the CIA.

1902
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:05,695
If we are protecting
the identities of CIA staff,

1903
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:08,031
we need to protect
our contractors as well.

1904
01:37:08,114 --> 01:37:10,325
Mitchell and Jessen were given
a contract by the Agency

1905
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:11,952
for a program that didn’t work.

1906
01:37:12,035 --> 01:37:13,745
The CIA also agreed
to a five million dollar

1907
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:16,706
indemnification clause
for their company that covered,

1908
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:19,876
among other expenses,
criminal prosecution.

1909
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,338
You know, I kept
the rag we used on KSM.

1910
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:27,217
You should eBay that bad boy
when this is all over.

1911
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:30,053
Make a mint.

1912
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:31,888
An internal CIA memo concluded

1913
01:37:31,972 --> 01:37:34,724
that Mitchell and Jessen "have
both shown blatant disregard

1914
01:37:34,808 --> 01:37:38,562
for the ethics shared by almost
all of their colleagues."

1915
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:41,439
The pseudonyms for
the contractors need to stay.

1916
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,360
McDONOUGH: Guys, we’ve been
at this for months.

1917
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:46,736
What about the
locations of the black sites?

1918
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,238
The country names?

1919
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:49,489
We made commitments
to those countries

1920
01:37:49,573 --> 01:37:50,782
to maintain their secrecy.

1921
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,242
No country names.

1922
01:37:52,325 --> 01:37:53,827
Not open to negotiating
these points.

1923
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:56,371
We need to consider
the morale of the CIA here.

1924
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:57,914
Now, we-we publish this report,

1925
01:37:57,998 --> 01:38:00,458
- there’s a very good chance we could lose them.
- Lose them?

1926
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:02,127
What does that mean?

1927
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:04,087
What about the morale
of all the people at the Agency

1928
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,422
who spoke out
against the program?

1929
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:06,840
What about them?

1930
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:08,925
People who sent cables back
from black sites

1931
01:38:09,009 --> 01:38:10,552
saying they wanted
to be transferred

1932
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:12,554
because they were disgusted by
what was being done.

1933
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:13,972
All right, uh, look.

1934
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:15,974
We have...
Dan more than anyone...

1935
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:18,310
have worked to uncover
the truth about this

1936
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:19,644
when no one else would.

1937
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:21,813
We will not allow this
to be covered up

1938
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:23,106
by the executive branch.

1939
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:24,816
President Obama
called it torture.

1940
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:26,401
Bush and Cheney
wouldn’t do that.

1941
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:30,071
He signed an executive order
getting rid of it.

1942
01:38:30,155 --> 01:38:31,531
Now, just imagine, God forbid,

1943
01:38:31,615 --> 01:38:33,950
there’s another
terrorist attack on our watch.

1944
01:38:34,034 --> 01:38:35,910
There won’t be another Democrat

1945
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:38,079
in the White House
for 20 years.

1946
01:38:38,163 --> 01:38:40,248
I’d also like
to talk about the redactions

1947
01:38:40,332 --> 01:38:42,417
concerning KSM.

1948
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,878
Cory Gardner,
the Republican challenger,

1949
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:46,755
will be the next
United States senator

1950
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:48,214
from the state of Colorado,

1951
01:38:48,298 --> 01:38:50,884
defeating the Democratic
incumbent, Mark Udall.

1952
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:53,928
A major, major win
for the Republicans.

1953
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:56,097
Chris Frates is standing by
in Colorado.

1954
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:58,350
This is huge
for, uh, Colorado, Wolf.

1955
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:01,478
This is the first time
a Republican has won

1956
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:04,981
the Senate race state-wide
in Colorado since 2002.

1957
01:39:05,065 --> 01:39:06,650
Big night for Colorado,

1958
01:39:06,733 --> 01:39:09,944
and a big night for control
of the United States Senate.

1959
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:14,991
She’s expecting you.

1960
01:39:15,075 --> 01:39:17,410
So, I just got a call

1961
01:39:17,494 --> 01:39:20,121
from Secretary of State Kerry.

1962
01:39:20,205 --> 01:39:23,249
He thinks that,
with the release of the report,

1963
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:27,128
that the coalition against ISIL
could collapse.

1964
01:39:27,212 --> 01:39:29,130
Isn’t that a bit convenient?

1965
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:30,840
- He calls you just before...
- Dan.

1966
01:39:30,924 --> 01:39:33,843
Wh-Where did Kerry get
his intel on this? The CIA?

1967
01:39:33,927 --> 01:39:37,138
- Is it credible?
- Embassies could be attacked.

1968
01:39:37,222 --> 01:39:38,807
Hostages could be killed.

1969
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:40,892
It’s just another stall tactic.

1970
01:39:42,519 --> 01:39:45,063
He suggested giving the report
to the president,

1971
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:48,858
so that it could be released
later, when hostilities cease.

1972
01:39:48,942 --> 01:39:51,820
You lose control of the
committee in a week, Senator.

1973
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:53,488
Yes, I am aware of what happens

1974
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:56,282
when the Republicans
are in the majority, Dan.

1975
01:39:57,826 --> 01:40:01,496
Look, I want to get this report
out as much as anyone,

1976
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:04,582
but I have known him
a long time.

1977
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,000
I tend to believe him.

1978
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:07,752
Nobody else is gonna
tell this story.

1979
01:40:07,836 --> 01:40:09,254
- Dan, the senator has a luncheon.
- If we stop now,

1980
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:10,714
aren’t we a part
of the cover-up?

1981
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:12,757
Strong pills, Senator?

1982
01:40:21,349 --> 01:40:24,936
I think you should go home
and get some rest.

1983
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:26,730
You look tired.

1984
01:40:26,813 --> 01:40:31,109
Marcy, if I could
have five minutes.

1985
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:33,153
Of course.

1986
01:42:11,668 --> 01:42:14,838
Did you ever meet a guy
called Greg Craig?

1987
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:19,384
Just in pa... White House
counsel when Obama took office?

1988
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:21,928
- Just in passing.
- Right.

1989
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:26,224
So, right after he got elected,
the president asked Craig

1990
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:28,226
to come up with a plan
to deal with

1991
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:29,894
the aftermath
of the torture program.

1992
01:42:29,978 --> 01:42:33,690
So, he got Secretary of Defense
Gates, Janet Napolitano,

1993
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:35,942
Hillary Clinton...
serious people... in a room,

1994
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:39,445
and he asked for
their recommendation.

1995
01:42:39,529 --> 01:42:42,740
- And?
- A-And the consensus

1996
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:44,784
was that the president
should appoint

1997
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:46,619
an independent
bipartisan commission

1998
01:42:46,703 --> 01:42:48,788
into interrogations
and detainee treatment,

1999
01:42:48,872 --> 01:42:51,624
like a deep dive into
what worked and what didn’t

2000
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:54,919
and... who was responsible.

2001
01:42:55,003 --> 01:42:56,921
You know, like what they did
after 9/11,

2002
01:42:57,005 --> 01:43:00,008
and like what you’ve been
trying to do.

2003
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:01,676
So why didn’t they do that?

2004
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:04,804
Well, evidently,
the president listened closely

2005
01:43:04,888 --> 01:43:06,598
to the recommendation.

2006
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:10,727
He then thought about it,
and then he said no.

2007
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:15,023
He’d spent an entire campaign
saying he was post-partisan,

2008
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:17,233
so going after
the Bush administration

2009
01:43:17,317 --> 01:43:19,527
flew in the face of all that.

2010
01:43:19,611 --> 01:43:24,240
And right then, everyone in
that room changed their minds.

2011
01:43:24,324 --> 01:43:28,620
They sided with the president:
no independent commission.

2012
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:31,414
Everyone except Craig,

2013
01:43:31,497 --> 01:43:34,876
because he thought
it was too important.

2014
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:36,836
You couldn’t just
torture people,

2015
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:40,924
lie about it,
and then hide it from history.

2016
01:43:41,007 --> 01:43:44,010
A few months later,
Craig was gone,

2017
01:43:44,093 --> 01:43:47,096
and this mess
wound up with the Senate.

2018
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:48,932
And you.

2019
01:43:49,015 --> 01:43:51,476
Well, the president must have
known that, by doing that,

2020
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:53,353
he was making it
next to impossible.

2021
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:55,980
Uh, he came from the Senate.

2022
01:43:56,064 --> 01:43:59,025
Dan, they sent you off
to build a boat,

2023
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:01,194
but they had no intention
of sailing it.

2024
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:05,156
They probably didn’t think
you’d get as far as you did.

2025
01:44:09,369 --> 01:44:11,245
Let me ask you a question.

2026
01:44:11,329 --> 01:44:15,041
If the CIA knew
that torture didn’t work,

2027
01:44:15,124 --> 01:44:17,251
why did they continue to do it?

2028
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:21,381
After 9/11,
everyone was scared...

2029
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,093
...scared it might
happen again,

2030
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:27,428
and the CIA would be blamed
if it did.

2031
01:44:27,512 --> 01:44:29,263
Or maybe they were ashamed.

2032
01:44:29,347 --> 01:44:31,224
You know, how come
the most sophisticated

2033
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:33,434
intelligence organization
on Earth

2034
01:44:33,518 --> 01:44:35,853
couldn’t keep
its own people safe?

2035
01:44:35,937 --> 01:44:38,690
But fear and shame don’t make
for better policy decisions,

2036
01:44:38,773 --> 01:44:40,650
and the fact that
the people who we captured

2037
01:44:40,733 --> 01:44:42,986
didn’t look like us or
believe the same things we do

2038
01:44:43,069 --> 01:44:45,405
made it that much easier
to do the things we did.

2039
01:44:45,488 --> 01:44:46,864
So once
the CIA program started,

2040
01:44:46,948 --> 01:44:48,324
they had to keep
telling people it worked,

2041
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:49,492
even if it wasn’t true.

2042
01:44:49,575 --> 01:44:50,952
Their own position was that

2043
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:53,413
if it didn’t work,
it was illegal.

2044
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:55,707
So they misrepresented
the results.

2045
01:45:08,094 --> 01:45:13,433
If we had your report,
we would print it tomorrow.

2046
01:45:13,516 --> 01:45:14,851
All of it.

2047
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:17,770
The senator said
she would release

2048
01:45:17,854 --> 01:45:19,939
- a summary of the report.
- Really?

2049
01:45:20,023 --> 01:45:22,191
Over the objections of the CIA
and the White House?

2050
01:45:22,275 --> 01:45:23,484
You really think
that’s gonna happen?

2051
01:45:23,568 --> 01:45:25,361
If I gave it to you,
what would happen?

2052
01:45:32,827 --> 01:45:34,704
Some people will think
you’re a hero,

2053
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:36,622
and some will probably think
you’re a traitor.

2054
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:39,500
Look at Edward Snowden.

2055
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:50,553
No. If it’s gonna come out,

2056
01:45:50,636 --> 01:45:52,472
it’s gonna come out
the right way.

2057
01:45:52,555 --> 01:45:54,849
What if it doesn’t?

2058
01:45:54,932 --> 01:45:57,143
Then I didn’t do my job.

2059
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:01,147
I’m sorry.

2060
01:46:02,732 --> 01:46:04,108
Sorry.

2061
01:46:50,947 --> 01:46:52,824
McDONOUGH: So, with
the Affordable Care Act

2062
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:54,867
behind us, the president
would like to begin

2063
01:46:54,951 --> 01:46:57,370
a serious discussion
about immigration reform.

2064
01:46:57,453 --> 01:46:59,455
Now, obviously
we’ve had some setbacks

2065
01:46:59,539 --> 01:47:01,499
in both the House
and the Senate,

2066
01:47:01,582 --> 01:47:05,503
uh, so strategy has become
paramount... unity as well.

2067
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:08,131
So, we would like to, uh,
really start talking about...

2068
01:47:08,214 --> 01:47:10,049
Excuse me, Mr. McDonough.

2069
01:47:10,133 --> 01:47:12,552
I would like to discuss
the report on the CIA

2070
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:14,095
and the White House’s position.

2071
01:47:14,178 --> 01:47:16,764
That’s not the topic
of this particular caucus.

2072
01:47:16,848 --> 01:47:18,933
Uh, the president
would like to discuss...

2073
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:21,435
Our country
did things the Nazis did,

2074
01:47:21,519 --> 01:47:23,938
things that made us
condemn other regimes.

2075
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:26,732
And the position
of this administration

2076
01:47:26,816 --> 01:47:28,317
is to suppress
this information,

2077
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:30,278
to keep the people
who did these things safe?

2078
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:32,196
I can assure you that is not

2079
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:34,532
the position of
this administration, Senator.

2080
01:47:34,615 --> 01:47:36,576
You worked with John Brennan

2081
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:38,286
at the
National Security Council.

2082
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:41,080
Now, I understand that Brennan
gave this president

2083
01:47:41,164 --> 01:47:43,374
his first security briefing
when he took office.

2084
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,543
And now CIA Director Brennan

2085
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:48,713
is working closely with the
president on the drone program.

2086
01:47:48,796 --> 01:47:50,381
You know, it’s funny.

2087
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:52,133
Every time
I go over to the CIA,

2088
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:53,759
they claim I’m doing
the Senate’s bidding,

2089
01:47:53,843 --> 01:47:55,136
and every time I come here,

2090
01:47:55,219 --> 01:47:56,596
you claim I’m doing
the CIA’s bidding.

2091
01:47:56,679 --> 01:47:59,974
I only have a few days left
in my term here,

2092
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:04,437
and if there isn’t a plan to
release the report before I go,

2093
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:07,106
I’m prepared to read it
on the floor of the Senate.

2094
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:08,649
And either the White House

2095
01:48:08,733 --> 01:48:10,651
or the Republicans
will have to stop me.

2096
01:48:10,735 --> 01:48:12,111
McDONOUGH:
What would you have us do?

2097
01:48:12,195 --> 01:48:13,654
Now, we go after
Bush and Cheney on this,

2098
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:15,489
what’s to prevent
the Republicans

2099
01:48:15,573 --> 01:48:19,368
from coming back at us and
trying to repeal health care?

2100
01:48:19,452 --> 01:48:22,205
Uh, we go after the CIA,
uh, maybe they say,

2101
01:48:22,288 --> 01:48:25,249
"Okay, well, immigration reform
is off the table."

2102
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:27,251
Maybe it’s gun control.

2103
01:48:27,335 --> 01:48:32,340
Now, democracy is messy...
but let’s just think

2104
01:48:32,423 --> 01:48:35,134
how many countries
there are in the world

2105
01:48:35,218 --> 01:48:37,261
where a report like this
could even get done.

2106
01:48:41,974 --> 01:48:43,935
I would like us to be more than

2107
01:48:44,018 --> 01:48:45,561
the country
that did the report.

2108
01:48:45,645 --> 01:48:48,314
I’d like us to be the country
that made it public.

2109
01:48:48,397 --> 01:48:52,026
And that is what I intend
to see happen.

2110
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:53,986
I yield the floor

2111
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:57,531
to the senior senator
from California.

2112
01:49:11,295 --> 01:49:13,214
Over the past six years,

2113
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:17,051
a small team of investigators
pored over more than

2114
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:21,555
6.3 million pages
of CIA records

2115
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:23,891
to complete this report.

2116
01:49:23,975 --> 01:49:27,937
It shows that
the CIA’s actions a decade ago

2117
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:31,732
are a stain on our values
and on our history.

2118
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:35,236
The release of
this 500-page summary

2119
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:37,238
cannot remove that stain,

2120
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:41,742
but it can and does say
to our people and the world

2121
01:49:41,826 --> 01:49:45,663
that America is big enough
to admit when it’s wrong

2122
01:49:45,746 --> 01:49:49,792
and confident enough
to learn from its mistakes.

2123
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:53,087
Releasing this report is
an important step toward

2124
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:56,507
restoring our values
and showing the world

2125
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:01,053
that we are, in fact,
a just and lawful society.

2126
01:50:01,137 --> 01:50:05,516
There are those who will
seize upon the report and say,

2127
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,311
"See what the Americans did?"

2128
01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:10,021
And they will try to use it

2129
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:13,733
to justify evil actions
or to incite more violence.

2130
01:50:13,816 --> 01:50:17,361
We cannot prevent that.

2131
01:50:17,445 --> 01:50:19,363
But history will judge us

2132
01:50:19,447 --> 01:50:24,118
by our commitment to
a just society governed by law

2133
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:27,455
and the willingness
to face an ugly truth

2134
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:31,125
and say "never again."

2135
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:32,626
Thank you.

2136
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:36,589
I now yield the floor
to the senator from Arizona.

2137
01:50:38,424 --> 01:50:40,634
JOHN McCAIN:
What might come as a surprise

2138
01:50:40,718 --> 01:50:44,180
is how little these practices
did to aid our efforts to bring

2139
01:50:44,263 --> 01:50:47,391
9/11 culprits to justice
and to find and prevent

2140
01:50:47,475 --> 01:50:50,227
terrorist attacks
today and tomorrow.

2141
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:52,063
That could be a real surprise,

2142
01:50:52,146 --> 01:50:54,732
since it contradicts
the many assurances

2143
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:57,026
provided by
intelligence officials,

2144
01:50:57,109 --> 01:50:59,070
on the record and in private,

2145
01:50:59,153 --> 01:51:02,865
that enhanced interrogation
techniques were indispensable

2146
01:51:02,948 --> 01:51:04,867
in the war against terrorism.

2147
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:08,371
I think it’s an insult to
the many intelligence officers

2148
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:10,373
who have acquired
good intelligence

2149
01:51:10,456 --> 01:51:12,541
without hurting
or degrading prisoners

2150
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:16,462
to assert we can’t win this war
without such methods.

2151
01:51:16,545 --> 01:51:19,548
Yes, we can, and we will.

2152
01:51:19,632 --> 01:51:21,759
But in the end,

2153
01:51:21,842 --> 01:51:24,428
torture’s failure to serve
its intended purpose

2154
01:51:24,512 --> 01:51:27,807
isn’t the main reason
to oppose its use.

2155
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:32,770
This question isn’t about
our enemies; it’s about us.

2156
01:51:32,853 --> 01:51:38,192
It’s about who we were, who we
are, and who we aspire to be.

2157
01:51:38,275 --> 01:51:42,279
It’s about how we represent
ourselves to the world.

2158
01:51:42,363 --> 01:51:45,157
Our enemies act
without conscience.

2159
01:51:45,241 --> 01:51:47,201
We must not.

2160
01:51:49,578 --> 01:51:51,664
Senator Dianne Feinstein today

2161
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:54,500
exposed the CIA’s now extinct

2162
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:56,919
enhanced interrogation
techniques.

2163
01:51:57,002 --> 01:51:58,587
The thing that strikes me about

2164
01:51:58,671 --> 01:52:00,047
what the Senate
was doing today...

2165
01:52:00,131 --> 01:52:02,007
Dianne Feinstein,
Jay Rockefeller...

2166
01:52:02,091 --> 01:52:03,843
is they were doing
everything they can

2167
01:52:03,926 --> 01:52:06,554
to make sure
this doesn’t happen again.

2168
01:52:06,637 --> 01:52:08,722
Because by going public
like this...

2169
01:52:08,806 --> 01:52:10,891
Dan.

2170
01:52:10,975 --> 01:52:12,476
You did well.

2171
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,311
Thank you.

2172
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:16,689
Thank you.

2173
01:52:16,772 --> 01:52:20,484
"We’re gonna be on you
if you try to do this."
