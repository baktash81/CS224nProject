1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,008
Previously on New Amsterdam.

2
00:00:02,107 --> 00:00:03,605
He will not grow old.

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:04,984
I'm a 65-year-old man.

4
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,363
You're also my son.

5
00:00:06,462 --> 00:00:07,673
You will not die...

6
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:10,188
I never had a coronary of a woman before.

7
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:11,718
Until you find the one...

8
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:12,683
We're separated.

9
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:14,278
And your souls are wed...

10
00:00:14,377 --> 00:00:15,608
Is it that obvious?

11
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:16,833
I almost died.

12
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:18,893
Hey, let the good times roll.

13
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:21,383
Hi, my name is john and i'm an alcoholic.

14
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:24,378
He's got this bizarre sense of humor.

15
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:27,338
I haven't had a drink in 15,495 days.

16
00:00:27,437 --> 00:00:29,770
This weird past lives thing...

17
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,693
You're either the luckiest man alive or the unluckiest.

18
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,108
Well, that'll depend on whether
you'll have dinner with me tonight.

19
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:36,460
Now that was flirting.

20
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,743
Definitely flirting.

21
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:40,110
Do you believe in true love?

22
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,550
I've waited a very long time for this.

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,060
the truth, john.

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,580
That's all i needed.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,900
What took you so long?

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,600
I had to be sure.

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,940
A gray hair.

28
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,610
I'm mortal.

29
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,730
You want to eat again?

30
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,030
Ever?

31
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,623
Come on, sara.

32
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:59,158
I'll cook for you.

33
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:01,040
I need a detective!

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,140
I have information on a homicide.

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,400
Santori,

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,823
you're up.

37
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:10,133
Yes, sarge.

38
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:12,500
Come on.

39
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,433
Sara, i need to see you.

40
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:16,798
Between shifts then.

41
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:17,703
Please?

42
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:21,598
The cops said it was a heroin overdose,
but that's wrong.

43
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:23,635
Ollie's against heroin.

44
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,638
All drugs, all alcohol.

45
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:27,450

All right.

49
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:33,928
Hold on here a sec.

50
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:35,245

M- i-c-k.

00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,993
Ollie is dead.

54
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,468
And you think he was murdered.

55
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,018
You don't think he o. d

56
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:43,240
I know he didn't.

57
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:44,393
"sobriety first.

58
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:46,793
" every day he said that.

59
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:49,310
Ollie helped me stop drinking.

60
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,380
One day at a time.

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,780
Five long days.

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,260
Come on You're drunk now.

63
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,223
And you smell like mangos!

64
00:02:59,322 --> 00:03:00,898
My friend was murdered!

65
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:01,913
I've got this one.

66
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:03,403
Mick, mick, let's get some coffee.

67
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:05,060
You need to talk about your friend?

68
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,238
His junkie friend!

69
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:07,283
He was sober!

70
00:03:07,382 --> 00:03:09,650
And he was murdered!

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,838
Assaulting a police officer.

72
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:15,205
B- a-d!

73
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,338

1964 East 54th Street

80
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,308
I worry about people who don't drink.

81
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,310
I don't trust 'em.

82
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,703
He's drinking water.

83
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,508
It's bad for your health, man.

84
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:42,160
Ever seen a camel?

85
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,527
You like hairy humps?

Handmade suit, pinky ring, broken nose?

00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:56,290
Gee, wonder what he does for a living.

00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,190
Mafia.

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,098

He whacked six people this year,
i kid you not.

93
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:12,680
Last thanksgiving, took out a turkey
for lucky luciano.

94
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,308
You're gonna get yourself killed.

95
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:18,413
Camel man, i don't think so.

96
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:24,248
Ladies and gentleman, a warm dutchman

You all right?

101
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,840
No one believes me.

102
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,188
I'm fine, sarge. I'm ok.

103
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,330
Yeah, a stun gun.

104
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,697
Are you kidding me?

105
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,123
Cancel the bus.

106
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,300
We're giving him a ride.

107
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,700
What?

Ollie.

112
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,033
I did it.

113
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:48,400
I brought help.

114
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,348
One day at a time.

115
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:55,820
35 years.

116
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,223
Needle mark.

117
00:05:57,322 --> 00:06:01,628
Csu found a bindle of- straight flush, killer dope.

118
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,713
I want a full tox screen.

119
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:05,688
I'd have the needle residue tested, too.

120
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:07,038
If csu had found one.

121
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:08,850
Next of kin?

122
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,198
Next stop, potter's field.

123
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:13,565
My hands are still buzzing.

124
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,050
Cocktail time.

125
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,273
Expensive test.

126
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:20,640
The new sarge isn't gonna like it.

127
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,673
Put it on a rush.

128
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:24,108
Priority request.

129
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:25,508
Oh, come on, man.

130
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:26,333
I'm parched.

131
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:28,710
It's not workin' out for you, the drinking?

132
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,750
You sound like ollie.

133
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,660
Call me if you want to stop.

134
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,100
All right.

135
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,523
What's this about?

136
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:43,493
Ollie played guitar right-handed.

137
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:46,228
Right-handed junkies shoot dope in their left arms, usually.

138
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:47,425
Sherlock marquez.

139
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:48,734
And if he O. D.

140
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,973
where's the needle?

141
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:52,340
What's this about for you?

142
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,780
I know how you feel.

143
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,780
I blacked out once, woke up in cuba.

144
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,600
They think you're crazy.

145
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,220
Crazy stories...

146
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,590
Chasin' down john wilkes booth,

147
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,420
throwin' the high hard one to emily dickinson...

148
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,768
How you doin'?

149
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,043
I'm ok...

150
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:26,410
If you're not here to kill me.

151
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,968
You've been in a lock-down psych ward for two days.

152
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,043
What?

153
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:37,320
No visitors, not even the kid that signed you in,
the horn player.

154
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,190
You're "ok"?

155
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,063
Who are you?

156
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,310
I'm an alcoholic.

157
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,630
Same as you.

158
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,228
Maybe we can help each other.

159
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,490
Oh, my.

160
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,890
The name is frank.

161
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,458
Give me a call when you want to stop.

162
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:01,825
Omar signed me in?

163
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,770
Keep the change.

164
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,833
New york city takes care of its own.

165
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:19,923
And that is what big apple shelters are gonna do.

166
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:24,543
As a city councilman, my job is to
solve problems any way i can.

167
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:28,348
Now, when i told my wife daphne that
the project had run out of money,

168
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:32,118
daphne persuaded the great chris duncan
to perform a benefit for us,

169
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:35,198
and today, the first big apple is open.

170
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:36,583
Daphne?

171
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,950
Thanks, ben.

172
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,463
I know some of you are skeptical.

173
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,083
You know what shelters in this city are like.

174
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:47,828
If you're lucky enough to get a bed,
odds are you'll also get robbed.

175
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:48,753
Or killed.

176
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:51,163
Big apple isn't just about beds.

177
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:54,723
It's about education, rehab, job training.
- There.

178
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:58,280
Getting out of the shelters, back into life.

179
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,140
So, if you need a little help,
big apple is finally here.

180
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,908
Hey, this is our spot!

181
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,100
Get out!

182
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,438
Cool out.

183
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:09,193
Ok?

184
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:11,423
Did ollie have a hiding spot
where he kept his stuff?

185
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:13,618
You're out flyin' the flag,
you gotta have a good spot.

186
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:15,613
Hey. I'm daphne tucker.

187
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:17,498
You need a place to stay tonight?

188
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:18,313
No!

189
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:19,713
I live here!

190
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:21,498
Don't yell at her.

191
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:22,513
Hey, man.

192
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:23,733
The tuckers are for real.

193
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:27,018
They gave me a job driving them and my own place.

194
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:28,138
I need a drink...

195
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:28,963
Now.

196
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:30,698
If they don't want help, nothing you can do.

197
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:33,065
Show me the hiding spot.

198
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,623
This is about the overdose.

199
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:38,103
You know anything about that?

200
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:42,028
In the last two years, there have been
seven drug-related deaths in this park.

201
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:44,543
The problem is not going to fix itself.

202
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:48,460
If we don't do something to help these people, who will?

203
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,900
Oliver hardin.

204
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,188
This is just a list of his aa meetings.

205
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:27,445
That's it.

206
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,668
Look at this.

207
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:29,423
What?

208
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:31,898
Don't tell me you know wiat weirdass lock this fits.

209
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:33,643
Babe ruth's secret hot dog locker?

210
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:35,778
You ordered a tox screen on the homeless O. D.?

211
00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:36,830
It didn't add up, sarge.

212
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:37,813
The vic was right-handed.

213
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:39,583
Ok, good, at least you had some clues.

214
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:44,280
Here i was thinkin' your partner's was a drunk,
just wanted to believe this guy was sober.

215
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,953
Methadone.

216
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:48,763
Fatal dose, five times over.

217
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,658
Killer dope was a set-up.

218
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:52,690
M. E. Ruled it a homicide.

219
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:55,057
Next time, just run it by me.

220
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,610
I like her.

221
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,243
Why?

222
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:01,338
Because she just backed up her partner?

223
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,108
Oh, no, wait, that was me.

224
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:04,323
Hamilton arms.

225
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:06,828
Flophouse hotel on barrow, public lockers.

226
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,370
I'm like 90% sure.

227
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,737
Where are you going?

228
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,370
Who's that?

229
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,160
He's nobody.

230
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,938
Howard: howard, alcoholic.

231
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:25,153
All: hi, howard.

232
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:28,193
It's supposed to be anonymous.

233
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:31,843
I'm supposed to feel safe in these rooms.

234
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:36,908
I see photographers outside my meeting,
i don't feel safe.

235
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:41,123
Takin' pictures of celebrities leaving my meeting...

236
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:47,960
I feel like havin' a bottle of vodka,
a fistful of percs, and punchin' someone's lights out.

237
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,543
Pictures don't matter.

238
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:55,048
Sobriety, that's what counts.

239
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,343
Sorry.

240
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:57,743
Who are you?

241
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,408
Chris, alcoholic, addict.

242
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:02,195
All: hi, chris.

243
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:03,913
The real chris.

244
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:07,848
Who i am out in the world, that's the other chris.

245
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:10,145
Chris duncan, the rock star.

246
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:12,373
See, he's the famous one.

247
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:16,440
Everywhere he goes, they take his picture.

248
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,673
Problem is, the real chris needs to be here.

249
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,338
If i don't go to meetings, i shoot dope.

250
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,690
I'm dead.

251
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,090
Pictures don't Matter.

252
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,673
Bein' honest is all that matters.

253
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:35,888
You get a notebook, pencil,
you write down all your secrets.

254
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:39,658
Writes a moral inventory of your whole life.

255
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:41,943
However long that takes.

256
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:46,268
You write your worst secret at the top of the list,

257
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:50,590
the one thing you swore you'd take to the grave.

258
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,010
And then you keep going.

259
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,490
If you're fearless, you're thorough,
you tell the absolute truth.

260
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,570
You get clean.

261
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,648
I'm john, i'm an alcoholic.

262
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,353
All: hi, john.

263
00:13:09,452 --> 00:13:13,918
I wanna be honest in here,
because that's what i was taught.

264
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:17,103
A guy named ollie used to come here.

265
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:20,078
If you knew him, i'd like to talk after the meeting.

266
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:23,470
I'm investigating his death.
-? A cop?

267
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,200
Working a meeting?

268
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,940
I earned this seat.

269
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,520
That went well.

270
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,248
Only thing in ollie's locker.

271
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,630
Oh, boy.

272
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,673
Big deal.

273
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:58,993
Old guy had an old guitar.

274
00:13:59,092 --> 00:14:02,630
Old ain't bad, with guitars or men.

275
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,133
A gibson I double o, early '1930s.

276
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:12,370
Mr. Robert johnson's axe of choice.

277
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,293
Good shape.

278
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:16,828
You could get six, eight grand for it.

279
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:18,598
That's why a homeless guy had it.

280
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:20,965
Who's robert johnson?

281
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,633
Who's mozart?

282
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:27,000
Who's charlie parker?

283
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,410
Who's chano pozo?

284
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,463
Cuban percussionist.

285
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:34,058
Used to play big band bebop with diz.

286
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,698
Co-wrote "manteca.

287
00:14:35,797 --> 00:14:36,773
" ouch.

288
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:39,378
Robert johnson invented the blues.

289
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:41,940
Sold his soul to the devil to do it.

290
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,700
For what, immortality?

291
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,500
Who wants that?

292
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Played this thing like no one ever has, before or since.

293
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,100
You dig chano, my man rj will melt your brain.

294
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,200
6,000?

295
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,200
He's on crack.

296
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,500
You're right.

297
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,968
The guitar isn't worth what omar said.

298
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:04,835
Not this one.

299
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:05,633
Print that out.

300
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:08,168
This one might've been robert johnson's.

301
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:09,600
It's worth a little more.

302
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,100
320,000 and it gets better.

303
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,800
Purchased at auction by chris duncan.

304
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,333
Small world.

305
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,700
Chsis raised money for the big apple shelter.

306
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,200
How did ollie get it?

307
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,100
The shelter benefit was chris's last gig.

308
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,933
He cancels everything...

309
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:30,968
Big tour, new record, checks himself into new horizons next day.

310
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,300
Doesn't tell a soul.

311
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,368
How'd you know?

312
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:34,435
Lucky guess.

313
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,433
Look who's here.

314
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,200
Mr. "i don't feel safe".

315
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,400
The cop?.

316
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,100
The cop.

317
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,218
This your cop friend?

318
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:42,268
Who's today's target?

319
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,635
Chris duncan?

320
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,700
Man: there he is!

321
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!

322
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,368
Need to see chris duncan.

323
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,735
Chris?

324
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,833
Decoy.

325
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:04,200
Man: there he is!

326
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,268
sara, i'd like you to meet...

327
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,100
Omar.

328
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,500
A real pleasure.

329
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,600
Wow.

330
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
Not a lot of men can pull that off.

331
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,100
He doesn't deserve you.

332
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,118
So, we're on a date.

333
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:35,100
I need some date stuff.

334
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,268
What about your family?

335
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:37,368
Tell me about your family.

336
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:38,900
Not much to tell.

337
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,200
You know about mine.

338
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,700
The dillanes, of greenwich, newport and new york city.

339
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,168
Biggest private house on park avenue.

340
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:47,333
My great grandmother.

341
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:48,818
She thought bigger was better.

342
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,268
So did the old man's mistress.

343
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,900
The ballet dancer.

344
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,300
Made him hire stanford white.

345
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Family secret?

346
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,468
I thought so.

347
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,000
No such thing.

348
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,400
So, what about the amsterdams?

349
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,500
My father...

350
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,000
I left home when i was 14.

351
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,868
I thought he'd fight me on it.

352
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,235
He didn't.

353
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,700
He still around?

354
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,600
Long time gone.

355
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,100
My mother, too.

356
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,500
What did he do?

357
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,600
The best he could.

358
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,700
John, i need details.

359
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
I've gotta get you drunk, loosen your tongue.

360
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,500
Omar!

361
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
I don't drink.

362
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,100
Oh.

363
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,500
Bet that's a good story.

364
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Good night, guys.

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,300
Good night, omar.

366
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,300
Young white man with a colored child?

367
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,700
No day at the beach.

368
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,568
You struggle through god knows what growing him up.

369
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,400
Don't give up now.

370
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,500
You want your son back, start writing, do the work.

371
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,900
My whole life.

372
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,268
Might take a while.

373
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,000
You like it?

374
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,400
Your son walkin' past you like you don't exist.

375
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,700
What happens when i'm done?

376
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,918
you read it.

377
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,033
Out loud.

378
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:25,400
To another human being.

379
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,900
Like me, for example.

380
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,200
The past is the past.

381
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,600
Everybody's got one.

382
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,300
You're not gonna tell me anything i haven't heard before.

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Hey, frank.

384
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,400
You got more of these?

385
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,500
I have told you, i have no idea where chris is.

386
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,000
You took pictures at the benefit.

387
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,168
You know what he looks like.

388
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:01,435
Backstage pictures.

389
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:02,668
Revealing, personal.

390
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,533
No.

391
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:05,133
I sell those, mate.

392
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:06,968
Not with an expired work visa.

393
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,335
Mate.

394
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,600
Fine.

395
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,000
Chris was so high he needed a stepladder to scratch his ass.

396
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,400
There.

397
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,000
Looks cropped.

398
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,400
Hang on.

399
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,600
It's ollie.

400
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,800
They invited all the guys from the park.

401
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,833
Free food.

402
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:39,300
You need to take a picture of chris duncan, right now, where do you go?

403
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,068
The man likes a high thread count.

404
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,168
Five star hotels.

405
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:42,833
Good luck.

406
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,700
Does he register under fake names?

407
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,968
That's why i say "good luck. "

408
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:46,735
what names?

409
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:47,433
Bye-bye now.

410
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:50,700
Immigration, you got them on speed dial, right?

411
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,268
"jim hendrix. " "bud holly. "

412
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,600
his dead heroes.

413
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,100
I thought chris duncan was in rehab.

414
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,968
You don't think he has something to do with the park overdose.

415
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:05,100
He's a person of interest.

416
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,168
He just strolls out of new horizons.

417
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:08,233
He's out now.

418
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,768
We thought you might know where he is.

419
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:10,700
No.

420
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,468
You were on his list of approved visitors.

421
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:14,535
Which he made up when he got there.

422
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,902
In withdrawal, out of his mind.

423
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,933
Intake office.

424
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:21,100
Already more requests than beds.

425
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,333
If there's nothing else...

426
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:24,068
Well, actually, if you wouldn't mind telling me-

427
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,700
thanks for your help, mrs. Tucker.

428
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,100
Ah, daphne.

429
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,600
The missing wife.

430
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,618
Detectives amsterdam and marquez.

431
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:32,568
My husband, councilman ben tucker.

432
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,733
I never see her anymore.

433
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,300
One of the park guys, they're investigating his death.

434
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,018
The overdose.

435
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:39,700
Oliver hardin.

436
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,400
Guys like that, that's why she's doing this.

437
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,500
When you've fallen that far down, no resources, no hope...

438
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,400
Right out front, sir.

439
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,100
Great parking space.

440
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,100
Good job, bob.

441
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,300
If there's anything i can do.

442
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,700
Thanks for your help.

443
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,868
She didn't visit chris, but she knows he was at new horizons?

444
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,600
Not worth pursuing?

445
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Oh, no.

446
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,468
I picked up her cell by accident.

447
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,133
Easy mistake.

448
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,500
They look so much alike.

449
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,600
Three calls from the kempler hotel.

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,133
Swank place.

451
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,500
You gonna get a warrant for every room?

452
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,368
Jim morrison, please.

453
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:18,433
Nope. I'm sorry.

454
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:22,000
I meant johnson. Mr. Robert johnson.

455
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,900
Yes, bob johnson.

456
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,700
Ohh.

457
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,100
Thank you.

458
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,568
Bob's not taking calls at the moment.

459
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:30,500
Oh.

460
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,100
Hey, brother.

461
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,500
This belongs to someone inside.

462
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,100
Thanks.

463
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,868
You forgot the key, baby.

464
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,235
Nag, nag, nag.

465
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,100
Chris?

466
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,100
Eva?

467
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,900
Just like ollie.

468
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,300
Not quite.

469
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,300
This one's rich, white, and famous.

470
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,900
his driver's license, cut in half.

471
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
What's this?

472
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,400
Planning a party?

473
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,800
A list of names.

474
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,733
i never saw nor contacted my parents again.

475
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:07,868
I heard later they had believed i had died in the indian wars.

476
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:10,268
I had just enough money in my pocket for a drink.

477
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,300
I forgot all about my errand.

478
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,700
I returned home as the sun was setting.

479
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,600
But i hand that couldn't lose and no money left to bet with.

480
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,368
Instead of thinking of fanny and what she'd been through,

481
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:26,333
i satisfied my own cry by...

482
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:29,033
The battlefield in france during the first world war,

483
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:31,400
i put another man in mortal danger in order to save my own son.

484
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,233
I stole the formula...

485
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,868
While winning the affections of a good woman there,

486
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:40,235
it became a game to me,

487
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,268
I wasted precious time with a son and wife i dearly loved

488
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,635
to chase fame and fortune.

489
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,500
It's a list of people he's hurt in the Past.

490
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,433
People he needs to get right-

491
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:16,100
right. I almost forgot, the crucial aa angle.

492
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,068
Whoever tara brown brooklyn is, it's at the top of his list.

493
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,133
The worst thing he did.

494
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:22,268
Bad enough for tara brown brooklyn to kill him.

495
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:23,968
Or have an idea of who did.

496
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,168
Aa's the connection.

497
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:26,400
It's a theory.

498
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,468
Here on earth, we human detectives explore several theories as we gather the facts.

499
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:31,600
I got this one.

500
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,133
Ok.

501
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:33,533
Marquez, stay with the vic.

502
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:34,933
Run down the drug angle with the m. E.

503
00:24:35,032 --> 00:24:37,400
Let's find out where chris duncan's been since rehab,

504
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,668
while mister sober over here finds out what tara brown brooklyn means

505
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:43,035
and what that has to do with the price of beans in boston.

506
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,400
Maybe he knocked her up, wrote a crummy song about it.

507
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,733
Santori.

508
00:24:47,832 --> 00:24:50,100
You got your stun gun?

509
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,400
Chris duncan?

510
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,668
There's a singer by that name.

511
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:56,300
That's the one.

512
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,300
How would i know chris duncan?

513
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,668
Not a lot of white rock singers on this block.

514
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,868
Tara brown. Fort greene, brooklyn.

515
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:03,933
You're the only one.

516
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:06,568
Look, my baby's sleeping, my son's at school.

517
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:07,133
I gotta take my shot.

518
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:09,900
You could've told me at the door you didn't know chris duncan.

519
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,400
You didn't have to let me in.

520
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,033
You're a detective.

521
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:17,200
I thought maybe you could help me.

522
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,300
The cops that are on the case, they've given up.

523
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,700
Jason.

524
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,900
My son...

525
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,300
He was nine.

526
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,418
I sent him to the bodega.

527
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:33,400
The baby needed milk.

528
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,800
He got hit by a car.

529
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,300
Killed.

530
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,700
Hit-ane-run.

531
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,300
Who would do something like that?

532
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,300
Kill my baby... Just drive away?

533
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,600
Tara, when did this happen?

534
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,968
The hit and run was the same night as the shelter benefit.

535
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,468
Chris has a place in park slope.

536
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:57,968
He's loaded, going home.

537
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,500
He kills a kid.

538
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,100
Next day he checks into rehab.

539
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,468
Cuts up his driver's license.

540
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:03,033
Well, m. E.

541
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:04,818
Ruled chris' death a homicide.

542
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:06,800
Methadone o. D. Same as ollie.

543
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,168
Chris was going to come clean with tara brown,

544
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,535
but someone killed him before he had the chance.

545
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,400
Why kill ollie?

546
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,800
What's the connection?

547
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
Are you john?

548
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah.

549
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,468
I'm sorry, but i have some bad news.

550
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:31,835
Frank is dead.

551
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,433
Heart attack.

552
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:37,900
We kept him alive for a while last night, but he didn't have a chance.

553
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
Congenital arrhythmia.

554
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,400
Since he was a kid.

555
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,800
He never said.

556
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,200
When he turned down the morphine, that's when i knew.

557
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,400
He wanted to die sober.

558
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,900
Hmm.

559
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,300
I got 93 days.

560
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,668
God knows why, but when ruby shoots oswald...

561
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,400
That's it for me.

562
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,800
Good-bye, scotch.

563
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,900
Thanks for coming.

564
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,200
No choice.

565
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,033
Frank told me if i didn't,

566
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,400
i'd start drinkin' again and die a hosrible death

567
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,700
he was sorry he couldn't hear your stuff.

568
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,968
He said you gotta find somebody else quick.

569
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:25,335
Another human being.

570
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,900
That's it?

571
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,100
Who are you, jack the ripper?

572
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,500
You're supposed to read your list to somebody else.

573
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,568
Ollie was chris duncan's "somebody else".

574
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,235
He heard chris' confession.

575
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:46,868
So, they met at the aa meeting.

576
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:47,785
Chris liked him.

577
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:48,633
He was a musician.

578
00:27:48,732 --> 00:27:51,968
For a big celebrity, who's the safest person to tell your deepest secrets to?

579
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:53,033
A homeless guy.

580
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:54,600
Chris read it to ollie.

581
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,100
Ollie was killed by someone who thought he was gonna give chris up on the hit-and-run.

582
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,168
And the guitar?

583
00:27:59,267 --> 00:27:59,933
It was a gift.

584
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:02,300
Chris was grateful.

585
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,900
Something happens when you do this.

586
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,000
I would've given the moon to the person who heard mine.

587
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,268
I walked. He followed.

588
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:13,233
Did you see that?

589
00:28:13,332 --> 00:28:15,700
Sarge, we're talking about two murders and a dead kid.

590
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,300
You go, girl.

591
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,233
Ollie was killed because chsis told him about the hit-and-run.

592
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:25,368
Chris was killed because he was about to spill his guilty rock star guts to tara brown,

593
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:26,900
the hit-and-run's mother.

594
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,700
Who killed them?

595
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,300
Ooh. Don't wait for him.

596
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,168
See, this is a chick thing.

597
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:32,100
We're bonding.

598
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,500
Whoever else was in chris duncan's car.

599
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,400
Bonded.

600
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,700
it might be- it might be skipping.

601
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,300
what's wrong?

602
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,500
I googled you.

603
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,000
Oh, no.

604
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,318
I feel violated.

605
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:39,533
It's not funny.

606
00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:41,000
I mean, what are you?

607
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,833
The cia?

608
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:42,868
Witness protection?

609
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:43,433
Sara.

610
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,468
You're something, because five years ago, you didn't exist.

611
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:46,533
I'm a cop.

612
00:29:46,632 --> 00:29:48,868
Cops aren't in public databases.

613
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:50,200
Your partner is.

614
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,768
The chief of detectives is.

615
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:53,233
Family members, schools.

616
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:55,268
Ask me anything. I'll tell you.

617
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:57,635
Why aren't you in public databases?

618
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,100
Must be real bad.

619
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,000
Something happened.

620
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,968
I had to become someone else.

621
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:09,733
What is it?

622
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:12,100
An undercover thing?

623
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,268
What's your real name?

624
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,400
John amsterdam.

625
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,033
I like it.

626
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:18,400
I'd like to keep it.

627
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,800
I'd like to keep you.

628
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,000
Trust me.

629
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,800
Do i have a choice?

630
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,200
No.

631
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,233
i had no choice.

632
00:30:38,332 --> 00:30:40,600
I had to tell you the truth.

633
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,300
Might take a while.

634
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,200
I, uh- i brought sandwiches.

635
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,100
The truth about what?

636
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,600
You probably want to sit down.

637
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,700
So, what?

638
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,100
You some kind of superhero?

639
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,100
Is this your secret lair?

640
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,500
No.

641
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,700
You know how i always looked younger than the other dads?

642
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,000
Just listen, omar.

643
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,400
Please.

644
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,000
The first family i abandoned was my own.

645
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:51,900
In 1620, when i came to the new world, i was 14 years of age.

646
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,600
Hey!

647
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,500
I don't care about papers.

648
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,000
A black suv.

649
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,600
It hit him.

650
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,800
Never even slowed down.

651
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,833
Bad news.

652
00:32:57,932 --> 00:32:59,468
Chris duncan never owned a black suv.

653
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:00,868
Hit-and-run in fort greene.

654
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,400
Nine-year-old killed.

655
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,233
That's it.

656
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:04,233
The whole story.

657
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:06,600
And in the same day's paper...

658
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,100
That's the good news.

659
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,700
He did. Ben tucker.

660
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,133
A black suv, city-owned.

661
00:33:11,232 --> 00:33:13,900
Driver reported it stolen that night, during the concert.

662
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,500
Recovered a week later.

663
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,900
Stripped.

664
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,100
I think we better talk to the councilman.

665
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,500
No.

666
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,900
Not ben.

667
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,500
Why are we here?

668
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,300
Looks different when you stop.

669
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,468
A real place.

670
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:32,585
A neighborhood.

671
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:34,300
What are you doing?

672
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,433
It makes sense.

673
00:33:35,532 --> 00:33:36,433
Take me home right now.

674
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,018
You talked to chris in rehab.

675
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:40,385
He called you from the hotel.

676
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,700
You were sleeping with chris duncan.

677
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,933
You can't do this.

678
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:46,700
After the show, he's out of his mind on dope.

679
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
Wants to go home. To brooklyn.

680
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,600
Your husband's car, it's right there.

681
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,233
No.

682
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:52,068
That didn't happen.

683
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,300
Jason brown.

684
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,500
That's his name.

685
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,033
Look out!

686
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:57,400
The boy you killed.

687
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,300
He was nine years old.

688
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,268
The car knocked him 28 feet.

689
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:04,635
He landed right there.

690
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,500
Killing a kid.

691
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,000
A secret like that, keeping it inside, it eats you up.

692
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,568
Now, chris knew that.

693
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:14,468
You gotta tell someone.

694
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:16,835
If you don't...

695
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,500
It kills ya.

696
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,700
Watch out!

697
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,818
Who was driving?

698
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:21,833
You're crazy.

699
00:34:21,932 --> 00:34:22,568
You're gonna kill yourself.

700
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:23,133
Telling someone.

701
00:34:23,232 --> 00:34:24,568
Letting go of the secret.

702
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:25,033
I can't.

703
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:26,568
It's the only way.

704
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,500
Who was driving?

705
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,068
Get out of the street!

706
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,700
Who was driving?

707
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,668
Who was driving?!

708
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:35,035
I was!

709
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,000
I was driving.

710
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,700
And two people were killed to protect your secret.

711
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
Yeah?

712
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,033
Bob webson.

713
00:34:57,132 --> 00:34:58,500
Ben tucker's driver.

714
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,300
You write in haiku?

715
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,568
He's on a methadone maintenance program.

716
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,933
Injectable doses.

717
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:06,300
Like what killed ollie and chris duncan.

718
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,900
We'd like to bring him in.

719
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,568
We're the only two women in the house.

720
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,100
You notice that?

721
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,018
Hard not to.

722
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:15,100
Try harder.

723
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,900
We're cops, not women.

724
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,768
Our bond is our work.

725
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,300
That's it.

726
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,918
Councilman's driver? Bob.

727
00:35:22,017 --> 00:35:24,285
Go ahead. Pick him up.

728
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,000
Marquez.

729
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,000
Look where'd you get your shoes?

730
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,800
My wife killed someone?

731
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,100
A kid?

732
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,733
She says she panicked.

733
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:44,433
A bad accident, a strung out rock star in the car.

734
00:35:44,532 --> 00:35:47,200
She told me that she was going to go back to the shelter that night.

735
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,700
You didn't know about the accident until now?

736
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,000
Uh...

737
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,600
In her statement, your wife says she told you the next day.

738
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,300
I would've reported it.

739
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,000
She says she wanted to, you told her not to.

740
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,100
You said you'd "take care of it. "

741
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,300
come on.

742
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,468
I've got her statement.

743
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:08,668
I gotta get yours.

744
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:09,800
Please.

745
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,400
It's my job.

746
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,800
Please.

747
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Thanks, councilman.

748
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,900
Her statement says chris duncan called her from rehab.

749
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,033
I believe that.

750
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:26,500
As part of his recovery program, chris told someone about the accident.

751
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,100
A homeless guy.

752
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,800
Ollie hardin.

753
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,400
So, let me guess.

754
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,933
Daphne says that she told me,

755
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:36,968
and i killed ollie to protect our little secret.

756
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,335
No, bob did.

757
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,000
You had him shoot ollie up with methadone.

758
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,700
Made it look like an o. D.

759
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,100
My driver.

760
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,900
He can barely drive.

761
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,968
Bob was terrified of being homeless.

762
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:51,100
Ben played on that fear.

763
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,900
If the secret came out, he'd be back on the streets.

764
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,500
So i made bob kill ollie?

765
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,900
Chris duncan, too.

766
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,800
My wife...

767
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,300
She's a very sick woman.

768
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,900
And i've spent years pretending that she wasn't.

769
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,433
The sleeping around, the lies.

770
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:13,468
You think chris duncan was the first?

771
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,000
It was her.

772
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,400
All of it.

773
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,900
What, you think it was bob's idea to report the car stolen?

774
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,000
To kill two people?

775
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,033
The guy's dumber than a box of hair.

776
00:37:23,132 --> 00:37:25,600
She probably didn't even have to sleep with him more then once.

777
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,418
No, i'm sure it's true.

778
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:28,868
Everything she told you...

779
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:31,235
Except she did it.

780
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,200
I didn't say a word.

781
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,600
I didn't tell him anything.

782
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,100
I stood by you.

783
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,118
Tell him.

784
00:37:44,217 --> 00:37:45,300
She's right.

785
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
I think this is yours, sarge.

786
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,768
She left it on my desk.

787
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,700
A shopping list.

788
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,300
No one's gonna believe her.

789
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,733
It's her word against mine.

790
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:56,300
Well, his, too, when bob hears what you just said.

791
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,300
Take him away.

792
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,133
Ok, sara.

793
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:07,500
I could pick you up at work.

794
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh, me, too.

795
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,400
So, we could be tired together.

796
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,600
Exhausted.

797
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,100
Ok.

798
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,500
Sure, i...

799
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,300
You really want help, mick?

800
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,900
Thanks for coming.

801
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,100
I'm glad to be here.

802
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,568
I want to thank my pal johnny, my buddy.

803
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,700
Who-who are yow?

804
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,818
Mick.

805
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,700
M- i-c-k.

806
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,668
Alcoholic?

807
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:51,633
Huge.

808
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:53,200
You know that.

809
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,800
Johnny helped out ollie, and now he's helpin' me.

810
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,200
You know, no one's ever left me anything before.

811
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,000
Johnny tells me this gitbox is worth a little dough-re-mi,

812
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,000
but i'd never sell it.

813
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm gonna learn how to play it.

814
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,500
Stopped drinkin'...

815
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,768
Gotta do somethin'.

816
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:17,500
Right?

817
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,900
And when i stop bein' an alcoholic...

818
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,100
No.

819
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,500
You don't get cured.

820
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,500
You get better.

821
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,900
That's what ollie always said.

822
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,933
Mick!

823
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:36,118
Alcoholic!

824
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:37,600
One day!

825
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,000
All: hi, mick.

826
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,800
Keep the change.

827
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,900
Thanks.

828
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,400
i blacked out.

829
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,100
When i woke up, i was in a place for the insane.

830
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,100
"stranger told me you put me in there. "

831
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,900
that's when i stopped drinking.

832
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,000
? my son.

833
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,100
You deserve the truth.

834
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,700
you all right?

835
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,200
Oh, boy.

836
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,468
John, i'm really beat.

837
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,333
Me, too.

838
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:39,000
That's why i'm here.

839
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,500
The second we hit my bed, i am out.

840
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,600
I'm not going home with you.

841
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,300
I can't be with you, john.

842
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,400
I don't understand.

843
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,100
That's the problem.

844
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,933
Neither do i.

845
00:40:53,032 --> 00:40:57,100
I don't understand how i can be with someone who won't tell me the truth.

846
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,768
If i don't understand something, i can't make it work.

847
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:00,533
I'm a doctor.

848
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:02,068
I need for things have to make sense.

849
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:02,733
The heart attack.

850
00:41:02,832 --> 00:41:03,868
That's what this is about.

851
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:06,400
No, your heart.

852
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,168
There's something hidden in there.

853
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:09,133
Something big.

854
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:12,300
Some dark secret you won't tell me.

855
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,668
This is me.

856
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:14,800
Right.

857
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,033
John amsterdam.

858
00:41:16,132 --> 00:41:18,868
The man with anomalous blood and no past at all,

859
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:20,900
whose father did "the best he could. "

860
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,418
well, he could've done a little better.

861
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:24,100
He could've taught you to be honest.

862
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,833
He didn't.

863
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:26,168
I picked that up myself.

864
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,200
Tell me i'm wrong.

865
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,733
Tell me you're not hiding something.

866
00:41:29,832 --> 00:41:32,800
Tell me you were really undercover, that's why there's no history.

867
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,600
If it's true, i will believe it.

868
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,500
I promise.

869
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,900
That's what i thought.

870
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,600
You want the truth?

871
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,000
The truth is i'm 400 years old.

872
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,568
The truth is omar is my son, one of 63 children i've fathered.

873
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:01,033
John-

874
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:03,668
i've tried to be careful because i can't stay with them.

875
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:04,885
I'm immortal, they're not.

876
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:06,068
The truth is-
- stop.

877
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,435
Just stop.

878
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:23,000
