1
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,969
Since before recorded time...

2
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:47,534
it had swung through the universe
in an elliptical orbit so large ...

3
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:52,242
that its very existence
remained a secret of time and space.

4
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,110
But now, in the last few years
of the 20th century,

5
00:00:57,823 --> 00:01:00,586
the visitor was returning.

6
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:12,933
The citizens of Earth would get an extra
Christmas present this year,...

7
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:15,904
as their planet orbited
through the tail of the comet.

8
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:19,374
Scientists predicted a light show
of stellar proportions,

9
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:23,743
something not
seen on Earth for 65 million years.

10
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:25,816
Indeed, not since the time...

11
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:29,750
that the dinosaurs
disappeared, virtually overnight.

12
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:38,192
There were a few who saw this as more
than just a coincidence,

13
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:42,199
but most didn't..

14
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm showing you the top of the line here.
This is the best we have.

15
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:22,366
- This is $9.50. Now this...
- $9.50?

16
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:26,237
But wait, this is $8. Okay?
This is $7.50.

17
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:27,638
This lady over here,
she's wearing the $7.50.

18
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:30,177
Yeah, right.
- Let me tell you about this.

19
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:56,993
Blow on it. See? See how nice that is?
Isn't it great?

20
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:59,406
Now, I know you got $9.50.

21
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:17,355
And this spring, look at it.
Isn't that nice?

22
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,757
And the other side. Look at it.
Isn't that great? It's $9.50.

23
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:23,989
Enjoy the movie.

24
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:26,160
Excuse me. Where's the men's room?

25
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:27,733
- In a minute.
- Hey, you work here or not?

26
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:30,894
Hey, Regina.
Regina, give that thing a rest, will you?

27
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:31,992
In a minute, Mel.

28
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:35,301
Look, I don't pay you
to do that kind of stuff around here.

29
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:38,500
Regina, I want you to clean everything up,
so we can get out of here

30
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:41,944
in time to watch the comet.
- Everything's cleaned up.

31
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:43,307
Damn!

32
00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:46,975
I want you to take this flashlight
and walk the house.

33
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:49,054
Mel, they throw things at me.

34
00:03:49,157 --> 00:03:52,387
Who cares? Walk the house.

35
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:55,391
Have you ever been hit with Dots, Mel?
Milk Duds?

36
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:58,486
Those things hurt.
- I don't...

37
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:02,228
Oh, how are you, sir?
The refreshments are right over there.

38
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:03,632
Thank you.

39
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:07,431
I don't want those weirdoes cutting up
the seats, you understand?

40
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:09,507
Okay. Okay, okay.

41
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:15,680
Replacing Reg in third place is Reg.

42
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:18,009
Third place.

43
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,876
Wait a minute.

44
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,751
Somebody named DMK in sixth place.
When did this happen?

45
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:31,156
Look, don't be an overachiever. You'll fit in
better with your age group, okay?

46
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,263
- This is really annoying.
- Regina. Regina, look over here.

47
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:37,128
Regina, look at me!

48
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:38,969
Read my lips.

49
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:44,567
Flashlight. Walk house. Now.

50
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:46,637
Okay, Mel.

51
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:52,339
- Let me take this for you.
- That's great... There go the profits.

52
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,441
And listen, stay out
of the projection booth.

53
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:56,143
And stay away from Dupree.

54
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,744
I'm gonna fire that guy someday.

55
00:04:57,856 --> 00:04:59,823
He's been doing to me
what he's been doing to her in the booth.

56
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:01,050
He's been doing to me
what he's been doing to her in the booth.

57
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,623
- "David, that was a scream.”
- "You're right.”

58
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,861
I 'il go see. You stay here.

59
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:10,729
I'm talking about a mint-condition
print of ‘It Came from Outer Space’.

60
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:14,229
In 3D, man. Yeah, right.

61
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:19,733
Look, you know as well as I do
you got film freaks that'd go down on you

62
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:21,936
for a bootleg print of that.

63
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,971
100 bucks? 100 bucks? Right.

64
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:29,346
Something wrong with the phone here?
Did I hear you say $100?

65
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:32,045
Look, $100 isn't gonna get it this time.

66
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:34,178
Because I'm gonna have to
spend the night in here

67
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,087
waiting for you to bring the print back.

68
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:38,523
Think I'm gonna miss this comet thing
for a lousy $100?

69
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:41,188
"Help me!”

70
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,663
Okay 110's a little better, yeah.

71
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:47,328
Hey, Reggie, here's the deal.
You leave, I let you in the backdoor.

72
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:49,871
Okay? I leave, you let me back in.
Mel thinks everybody's gone.

73
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:53,203
- Larry, do you know anybody named DMK?
- No.

74
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:55,776
No, you got to have the print back
by 6:00 in the morning.

75
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:58,813
You know, if we spend the night in here,
we're gonna miss the comet.

76
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:01,747
It's not like you can't see it
on television, you know.

77
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,579
all right, hey.
Get your guy here in an hour.

78
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:06,551
Yeah, well, maybe I want to
see it for real, okay?

79
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:09,624
Hey, television's real.
Television's very real.

80
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,890
So, what do you say? I'll give you $15.

81
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:15,353
Are you kidding?

82
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:17,294
We spend the night in here,
we end up making it,

83
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,457
and you give me 15 bucks?

84
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:19,864
Do you know
what that makes me look like?

85
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:23,131
Reggie, I'm not giving you $15
for making it with me.

86
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:26,701
Okay, well, just so
we have that straight, okay?

87
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:28,399
Yeah, for sure.

88
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,502
I mean, you'd be worth a lot more
than $15. Everybody knows that.

89
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:38,681
The first earthlings to see the
effects will be in Newfundland.

90
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,681
Or, Newfoundland.

91
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:44,989
This is expected to begin at 2.04.
That's Pacific Standard Time.

92
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:46,753
Hey, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.

93
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:51,688
...Interesting sidebar to this story
is the fact that all telecommunications

94
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:56,030
seem to be out in that part
of the world.

95
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:58,136
This could have...

96
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:06,005
Hello?

97
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,207
Samantha, you sound pissed.

98
00:07:09,816 --> 00:07:12,909
I just had it out with Doris
once and for all, again.

99
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,412
She wants me to, like, haul chips and dips
around for her little comet party.

100
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:21,959
Yeah, well, speaking of Doris...
Look, I need your help.

101
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:25,621
Tell her that you know all about this
field trip that I'm gonna take, okay,

102
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:29,292
with my science class. We're gonna go
to the observatory to watch the comet.

103
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:32,859
- She won't go for it.
- She'll go for it. Just tell her, okay?

104
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,198
Okay.

105
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:42,914
Doris? Reggie's on the phone.

106
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,349
She's not having car trouble?

107
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:50,285
She's gonna be out all night
with her science class at the observatory.

108
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:52,723
I know everything.

109
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:59,093
Yeah, hi, Doris.
- What's this about a science class, Regina?

110
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:02,062
Well, you want me to do better
in science, don't you?

111
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:04,826
I want you home in five minutes
after you finish work.

112
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:07,336
If you wanna watch the comet,
you can do it here.

113
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:10,168
Look, Doris. I have 18 years ...

114
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:13,606
Look, Doris. Like, I'm 18, okay,
and I can watch the comet wherever
I want to watch the comet.

115
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:17,545
Here, Samantha, you and your sister
share a lot of secrets.

116
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:19,411
I want you to share this one with her.

117
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:23,043
If it were up to me,
I couldn't care less what she did.

118
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:27,280
But if your father makes it back home
without some Sandinista

119
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,585
blowing his brains out,

120
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:30,991
he's gonna hold me responsible
for any kind of trouble

121
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:32,822
you two girls get into.

122
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:36,025
What we have here is a chain of command.

123
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:38,760
The Major jumps on me, I jump on you.

124
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:42,532
Did you get that? Okay.

125
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:48,434
- Now, are you going to join the party?
- Join the party for what Doris?

126
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,409
So I can watch Chuck from across the street

127
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:52,777
stick his hands down your pants?

128
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,484
I think that's something
Daddy should know.

129
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:58,915
Chuck's a nice guy.
He's certainly nice to be with

130
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,852
while Daddy's down in Banana Land.

131
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,618
You were born with an asshole, Doris.
You don't need Chuck.

132
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:16,865
Looks like a real nice crowd
we have out here tonight.

133
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,675
Sarah, Chucky.

134
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:32,310
Hey, where have you been? You're gonna
miss everything. It's going to start.

135
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:35,514
Oh, kids.
I'll never marry another man with kids.

136
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:38,319
In 1910, Halley's comet returned.

137
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:41,322
Everybody thought
they were going to die then.

138
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:48,865
- What was that?
- Look!

139
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:59,940
You wanna know what bugs me about all this?

140
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:01,105
What?

141
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:05,847
Well, I'm always afraid
someone's gonna see us, you know?

142
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:10,252
See us how? There's no windows.
They can't see through walls.

143
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,582
Well, Superman can see through walls.

144
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,787
Not these walls. They're made out of steel.
Used to be a fire law.

145
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:21,496
Superman can see through steel.

146
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:25,370
No, it's the one thing he cannot see through.

147
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:28,766
That's lead, you nerd.
- Lead?

148
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:33,607
Yeah. I mean, Superman can see through
steel like it wasn't there, even.

149
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:36,136
Larry!

150
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:39,183
Well, I guess I'm the only one who's not
outside watching the meteor shower.

151
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:42,320
Perhaps put the radio on autopilot
and leave me.

152
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:43,049
I just might put the radio station
on autopilot and sneak out myself.

153
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:21,605
This is the Big K
of Los Angeles. A great-looking morning

154
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:25,735
in southern California. 50,000 watts
of oil, steel, and passion FM in the a.m..

155
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,372
It's wake-up time in the City of Angels.
And I'm Steve LaBeau.

156
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:32,484
- God damn it!
- What?

157
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,777
What?

158
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:36,985
I've been waiting by that door
for the last 30 minutes,

159
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,422
and that pinhead hasn't brought
the film back yet.

160
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:42,653
Give the guy a break.
I mean, people are late sometimes.

161
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:47,398
No, something's wrong.
If he screwed that film up,

162
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,900
we could all be in a lot of trouble.

163
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:52,769
I'm gonna go over there on the bike.

164
00:13:52,872 --> 00:13:55,864
Oh, jeez!
Don't I get an Egg McMuffin or anything?

165
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:59,544
- You could do me a favor.
- I did you a favor last night.

166
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:01,079
If that guy calls,

167
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:06,382
you tell him I'm on my way over,
and I'm very, very, very, very pissed.

168
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:09,817
- Hey, what about my 15 bucks?
- Tell him you're pissed, too.

169
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:31,299
DMK.

170
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:39,977
You trust people, you get
screwed over every goddamn time.

171
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:46,822
Is that you?
Yeah, it's about frigging time.

172
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:29,622
That's the end of you, DMK.
You're history.

173
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,717
God, bad smog.

174
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,753
Shit!

175
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,589
Shit!

176
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,034
Oh, damn it!

177
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,636
Just great!

178
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,275
I don't believe this,
there's clothes everywhere!

179
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,848
I hate days that start like this.

180
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,221
Oh, damn it, damn it!

181
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,234
Eww. Gross.

182
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,278
Larry?

183
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:21,226
What is this? Trick or treat?

184
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,629
- Come here.
- What?

185
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:28,098
- Come here!
- Come here, your ass.

186
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:37,345
Alright look, I don't know what your scene
is, but don't do anything stupid, okay?

187
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:44,710
No, you don't seem to understand.
I've been trained to take care of myself.

188
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,583
You know what I'm saying?
I don't want to hurt you.

189
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:52,520
Oh, shit!

190
00:18:58,668 --> 00:18:59,657
No!

191
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:06,197
Let go of me!

192
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:07,876
No!

193
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,614
Come on, come on, come on!

194
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:12,579
Samantha?

195
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:16,317
Doris?

196
00:22:57,865 --> 00:22:59,195
- Samantha?
- What?

197
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:03,728
God. What are you trying to do?
Give me a heart attack?

198
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:06,602
- I thought you were Doris.
- You know, she decked me last night.

199
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:08,139
Knocked one of my teeth loose, even.

200
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:10,209
Wait till Daddy hears about that.

201
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,575
You know how he's always telling me
to be careful with my mouth

202
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,944
on account of the dental plan
doesn't cover anything cosmetic.

203
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:20,643
Anyway, get this. I think Chuck and Doris
spent the night together last night.

204
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:22,687
Wait till Daddy hears about that.

205
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:26,724
I mean, even if he isn't pissed off
about my mouth, which I can't imagine.

206
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:29,291
What's happening?

207
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:31,921
Oh, yeah, I guess you are a little confused.

208
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:34,900
God, you look terrible.

209
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:38,629
I ran away last night after she slugged me.
Left a note and everything.

210
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:40,933
But I didn't have any place to go,
so I spent the night

211
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,702
in a lawn storage shed.

212
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:46,067
It was pretty gross with the Synerol
and everything.

213
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:48,508
God, look at this kitchen.

214
00:23:49,615 --> 00:23:51,515
I'm not cleaning this up.

215
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:54,350
So anyway, since I was still here
this morning,

216
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:58,786
I thought, hey, I'll go
to pep squad practice and split after.

217
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,581
Except for I don't know
if pep squad practice is on or not.

218
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:03,059
I can't get anybody on the phone.

219
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:07,791
Sammy, you can't get anybody
on the phone because everybody is gone.

220
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,499
What? could you grab the milk, please?

221
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,770
- I swear to God!
- You made me swallow my gum.

222
00:24:13,873 --> 00:24:16,340
There's nobody.
I mean, there's no body!

223
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:20,441
Oh, right. Nobody. I'm sure.

224
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,346
- Come here.
- Hey!

225
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:24,882
Back off!

226
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,142
This sweater cost 80 bucks.

227
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:32,380
Muffy?

228
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:37,257
Stupid dog.

229
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:39,456
Look! Look at this!

230
00:24:41,332 --> 00:24:46,268
- At what?
- Doris isn't at Chuck's. I'll show you Doris.

231
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,364
Here's Doris.

232
00:24:49,473 --> 00:24:52,465
This is all that's left of her,
this and dust.

233
00:24:54,177 --> 00:24:57,304
Look, here's Chuck.

234
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,449
Where are the kids?

235
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,685
It's Saturday morning.
Where are the goddamn kids?

236
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,248
They're around.

237
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,885
They're not around.

238
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:46,323
Look, if you're trying to scare me,
you're doing it, okay?

239
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:49,820
- I'm not trying to scare you.
- Then stop it.

240
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:51,396
I'm not doing it.

241
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:55,494
You try calling someone.
Not just your pep squad. Anyone.

242
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,194
Nobody's home!

243
00:25:57,772 --> 00:26:00,672
Unbelievable, that's song number 16
on the survey this week.

244
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:03,744
Don't forget, we preview the top 20
every Friday night.

245
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:06,439
A great way to start a super weekend
here in the southland.

246
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:07,572
Get down!

247
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:35,899
- Are you sure this is the radio station?
- Yeah. Just go on in.

248
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,341
Well, don't push.

249
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:51,982
Do you think whatever happened,
happened everywhere?

250
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:54,252
Like in Burbank or places like that?

251
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:59,422
We'll ask the DJ.
He does the news, doesn't he?

252
00:26:59,532 --> 00:27:02,898
Search me. I always change the channel
when the news comes on.

253
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:08,938
Here's something in here.

254
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:16,706
So, where is he?

255
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:24,514
I mean, somebody has to run this stuff,
don't they?

256
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,487
We've got trouble. Not us.
That's the name of the song.

257
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:28,956
And I'm Steve LaBeau
trapped inside your radio.

258
00:27:29,062 --> 00:27:30,926
The guy who really cares about you.

259
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:33,020
I mean, who else would sit
in this little box every day

260
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:35,189
just to play music for you?

261
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,894
Well, it's time to reach into
the old mailbag here. Got a letter from...

262
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:40,096
Beam me up, Scotty.

263
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,799
Okay, girls. Hold it right there.

264
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:46,308
- You, the blonde, get into the light.
- Wait.

265
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:49,479
Why don't you just let my sister go.

266
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,206
And maybe you and I
can work something out.

267
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:52,577
- I'm not going anywhere!
- Shut up!

268
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:54,650
You got the wrong idea.
You, into the light.

269
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:59,017
I'll give you to five. One, two... No?

270
00:27:59,757 --> 00:28:04,250
All right. Let's try it this way.
Five, four, three...

271
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:05,725
Okay, okay.

272
00:28:06,196 --> 00:28:08,824
Do you get a lot of dates this way?

273
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,359
Open your eyes.

274
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:18,901
Okay.

275
00:28:22,245 --> 00:28:25,680
Hey, I know what you're thinking, but...
- That you're a cretin?

276
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:30,941
Sweetheart, you haven't seen those
freaked-out zombies running around here?

277
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:33,521
Yeah, I was jumped by one.

278
00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:35,283
Well, you got off lucky.

279
00:28:36,593 --> 00:28:38,288
Me and this girl pulled into town
this morning.

280
00:28:38,394 --> 00:28:40,122
You don't work here?

281
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:42,626
No. I drive a truck.

282
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:46,899
I was heading to San Diego
with this girl I picked up.

283
00:28:47,404 --> 00:28:49,494
We were looking for a gas station.

284
00:28:50,774 --> 00:28:53,298
That's when we spotted one of those...

285
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:56,102
Whatever they are.

286
00:28:57,513 --> 00:28:59,538
Looked like it was eating...

287
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,539
Looked like it was eating a cat.

288
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:03,346
A dead cat?

289
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,379
Semi-dead.

290
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:07,980
Who'd want to eat a live cat?

291
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,449
Beats the shit out of me.

292
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:13,185
This girl freaked out.

293
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:15,853
Took off running.

294
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:22,330
I spotted her about 20 minutes later.

295
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:26,735
- Looked like one of those things had...
- What?

296
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,242
Torn her apart.

297
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,046
Oh, God.

298
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:42,682
- Larry.
- Oh, shit.

299
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,652
What's with her?

300
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:49,826
I think she's going to be
sick or something.

301
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:51,487
A guy she knew...

302
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:54,157
Same thing might have happened.

303
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:01,234
- Is it safe around here, do you think?
- Yeah.

304
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,240
I checked it out.

305
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,005
Swell.

306
00:30:17,256 --> 00:30:18,621
Are you all right?

307
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:24,427
My name's Hector.

308
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:29,024
- What's yours?
- Just leave me alone, okay?

309
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:35,301
Look, I... I know we got off
on the wrong foot,

310
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:40,878
but considering what the alternative is,
I think we should try to get along.

311
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:42,538
What do you say?

312
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,943
Listen, this is no time
for an attitude problem.

313
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,745
Your little sister seems to be taking this
a lot better than you.

314
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:54,225
That's 'cause she doesn't know
what's going on.

315
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:55,349
And you do, I suppose.

316
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:58,451
Whatever is going on isn't just here.
It's everywhere.

317
00:30:58,897 --> 00:31:01,661
She thinks we're gonna be rescued,
that our dad's gonna come back

318
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:04,630
from Honduras
with the goddamn Green Berets.

319
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:06,169
She could be right.

320
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:09,331
Give us a break, Hector.

321
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:16,842
Where did you spend the night last night?

322
00:31:21,884 --> 00:31:25,547
I spent the night in the back of my truck
with the girl I picked up.

323
00:31:27,591 --> 00:31:29,956
- What else do you want to know?
- Skip it.

324
00:31:31,495 --> 00:31:33,359
Steel's gotta be the answer.

325
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:36,261
If Sam spent the night
in the Lawn storage shed...

326
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:39,301
What?

327
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:42,195
...again, I'm an employee. I can't.

328
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:45,571
Just our way of saying
Merry Christmas to you from all of...

329
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,857
Testing, one, two, three, four.

330
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:14,099
This is Samantha Belmont,

331
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:18,435
one-third owner of
the Greater Los Angeles Basin, speaking.

332
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:21,532
You guys?

333
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:24,405
Hey, is anybody there?

334
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:30,345
Where did you get this,
a Dime Store?

335
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:33,113
Beats me. It was given to me.

336
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:36,182
Yeah, well, it might be all right
for date night in the barrio,

337
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:38,452
but if we run into any more
of those guys outside,

338
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,153
we're gonna need
a little more stopping power.

339
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:48,194
Date night in the barrio?

340
00:32:57,544 --> 00:32:59,535
Here are other changes.

341
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:02,308
And here's some other changes.
Most of you guys had finals this week?

342
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:03,035
Huh, Later.

343
00:33:03,236 --> 00:33:05,510
They are history. Canceled.

344
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:09,884
They're history. They're cancelled.
The legal drinking age is now 10.
But, you will need ID. Let's be real.

345
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,649
I'll be taking take requests from all you
teenage comet zombies on the...
Hit line!

346
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,893
That's 555-4487.

347
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,829
Get it? 555-HITS!

348
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:35,541
Do you know where the armed forces
reserve centre is at Los Alamitos?

349
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:36,706
Yeah.

350
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:40,181
My dad used to take us there
for target practice.

351
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:45,123
They store automatic weapons there.
- You know how to use them?

352
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,784
Come on, Hector.

353
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:51,823
The MAC-10 submachine gun
was practically designed for housewives.

354
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:55,966
I got a call!

355
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:59,427
It came in on the hit line.
- Hello?

356
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,065
Hello?

357
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,368
It went dead.
- Did they say they were okay?

358
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,637
I don't know.
They said they were in the desert.

359
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:09,076
- The desert? What desert was it?
- I don't know.

360
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:10,307
Shit! Think!

361
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,940
Why don't you just pull your gun
on her? Maybe you can scare it out of her!

362
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,454
They said they were, like, part of
a think tank or research group or something.

363
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,352
Where? Was it in this state?

364
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,357
- I forget.
- Okay. Let's take it real slow.

365
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,229
Did they mention a town?

366
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,593
Some place they were near,
like maybe Blythe, Bishop?

367
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,992
- What about Edwards Air Force Base?
- If I knew, I'd tell you.

368
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,163
I didn't expect the call, you know.
I didn't take notes or something.

369
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:37,467
Just try and remember.

370
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,975
If you think I'm not telling you
something on purpose...

371
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:41,668
Well, if they'll stay put,
we can get them.

372
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,746
...leave anything out?

373
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,315
From a psychological standpoint,
the radio station represents

374
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,405
a link to normalcy.

375
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,212
I don't think they'll wander far
as long as it's operating.

376
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,454
Dr. Carter, I'd just like to say upfront.
I'm opposed to this.

377
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,582
There is no reason for us to bring
those people,

378
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:59,155
or any other survivors back here.

379
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:03,923
What about the disintegration factor?
You just want to let that happen?

380
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,095
We don't know that
the condition is progressive.

381
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:09,193
I think we've established that, Audrey.

382
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:12,365
Partial protection seems to result
in a slowing of the overall effect,

383
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:14,443
but progression is steady in any case.

384
00:35:14,544 --> 00:35:17,877
Drying of the body fluids...
Get to the point, Oscar.

385
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,708
We've heard this a thousand times.

386
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:23,786
Ultimately, there is nothing left
but calcium dust.

387
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:28,652
Right. So there isn't even enough hope
to warrant bringing anybody back here.

388
00:35:30,057 --> 00:35:33,026
So, what you're saying is,
we shouldn't even try.

389
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:35,196
Right.

390
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:41,725
We don't want to be caught in the city
after dark. we'll leave tomorrow.

391
00:35:43,172 --> 00:35:45,299
And we've had an indication
of some survivors...

392
00:35:45,406 --> 00:35:46,897
in San Bernardino as well.

393
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:47,877
Four, maybe five.

394
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:50,376
Wait a minute.
Wait, girls, just shut up.

395
00:35:50,846 --> 00:35:55,475
Samantha! Did they say
anything else? Anything?

396
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:01,747
Yeah. They said
be careful on the street.

397
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:06,690
Because some people were exposed
to the comet a little bit.

398
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,694
What happened to Doris
is happening to them, only slower.

399
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:17,092
And, like, they're dangerous.

400
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:21,204
Like what happened to Larry.

401
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:59,343
You're not going to blame me
because the phone went dead.

402
00:36:59,445 --> 00:37:03,710
I'm not the phone company.
Nobody is the phone company anymore.

403
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:19,490
What?

404
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,292
Cops?

405
00:37:23,601 --> 00:37:26,126
Where were you guys earlier?

406
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:37,474
Oh, shit, my license.

407
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:40,010
Oh, shit!

408
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,950
I know you guys are probably going
to give me a ticket or something,

409
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,023
but I'm really glad to see...

410
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,242
 ...the weekend comet sale.
Everything must go.

411
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,442
Big savings on tuners, turntables,
car stereos,

412
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,577
also demos of great damaged items.

413
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:20,417
This weekend only, Henry's
Stereo Warehouse. Fourth and Alameda.

414
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:23,721
Free coffee for the adults.
Free balloons for the kids.

415
00:39:48,142 --> 00:39:50,633
This is for your step mom,
you little punk.

416
00:39:51,845 --> 00:39:55,837
- Ahh! They're here! They're here!
- Where?

417
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:58,349
- What's wrong?
- It's okay. I've got her.

418
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:01,442
- You've got her?
- Yeah, I got her.

419
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:10,428
Sammy, Sam, it's only a dream.

420
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:13,564
I know.

421
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:16,932
I know.

422
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:19,731
...expand your career
horizons. For a clearer view of...

423
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,898
Is there anything I can do?

424
00:40:23,176 --> 00:40:24,268
I'm fine.

425
00:40:24,844 --> 00:40:26,812
Interstate Technologies
is an equal-opportunity employer.

426
00:40:27,314 --> 00:40:30,110
Looks like the weather is shaping up
for a great weekend.

427
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:33,706
You know, it's hard to believe that there's
only 11 more shopping days till Christmas.

428
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,118
Good luck finding a parking space within
hitchhiking distance of the malls, too.

429
00:40:37,222 --> 00:40:39,416
You know how jammed it can get.

430
00:40:47,965 --> 00:40:52,425
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, I guess so.

431
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,135
Come on in. Have a seat.

432
00:41:02,746 --> 00:41:06,705
Listen, I have to go
to San Diego tomorrow.

433
00:41:07,918 --> 00:41:09,112
Why?

434
00:41:10,221 --> 00:41:11,551
My mom.

435
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:16,652
- Some friends. My sister.
- But you know they're gone.

436
00:41:17,495 --> 00:41:21,522
I know, but I still have to find out.

437
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:24,396
I mean, you guys know for sure,
but I don't know.

438
00:41:26,504 --> 00:41:28,835
Did you have, like, a close family?

439
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,775
Yeah, pretty close.

440
00:41:37,647 --> 00:41:40,116
- And you?
- Not anymore.

441
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:45,411
My real mom hung around until my dad
came back from Vietnam, then she split.

442
00:41:45,622 --> 00:41:48,887
So it's been mostly me and Sam and Dad

443
00:41:49,392 --> 00:41:51,451
and the 3rd special forces.

444
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:56,025
Smoke Bomb Hill. Fort Bragg.

445
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:05,005
But then around about
sixth or seventh grade,

446
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,267
it became real obvious
that we weren't boys,

447
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:10,208
that we were never going to go
to ranger school.

448
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:15,076
So I guess Dad figured there was
nothing more to offer us.

449
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:19,753
So he found us a new mom
and went off looking for a war.

450
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:27,085
What about the em...

451
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,625
The guy. Larry?

452
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:36,759
Oh, he and I weren't going steady
or anything like that.

453
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:56,818
- Look, don't go to San Diego, okay?
- I have to.

454
00:42:58,259 --> 00:42:59,850
But I'll be back.

455
00:43:03,296 --> 00:43:04,922
Please, okay?

456
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,533
What will you give me if I come back?

457
00:43:20,346 --> 00:43:21,870
Texas.

458
00:43:24,084 --> 00:43:29,020
Could give you Florida. Florida and Texas.
Florida, Texas and Hawaii.

459
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:35,822
- Hawaii? I wanted Hawaii.
- When I come back,

460
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,523
I'll take you to dinner.

461
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:43,631
Your choice.

462
00:43:58,884 --> 00:44:00,442
Here.

463
00:44:15,666 --> 00:44:17,099
Great!

464
00:44:25,677 --> 00:44:27,907
See? This is the problem
with these things.

465
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:30,004
Daddy would have gotten us Uzis.

466
00:44:32,082 --> 00:44:34,549
The car didn't know the difference.

467
00:44:43,694 --> 00:44:45,991
So, did you make it with him last night?

468
00:44:46,229 --> 00:44:49,129
- Who?
- The Good Humor Man. Who do you think?

469
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:54,100
- Jeez. Is that what's bugging you?
- That's no answer, man.

470
00:44:55,172 --> 00:44:57,834
No, I didn't make it with him last night.

471
00:44:58,441 --> 00:44:59,602
Why are you so weirded out?

472
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,540
Oh, right, Reg.
Why should I be weirded out?

473
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:04,112
My sister, who swiped every guy
I ever had my eye on

474
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:07,477
has now swiped the last guy
in the whole freaked-out world.

475
00:45:50,025 --> 00:45:51,389
Mom?

476
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:58,055
Mother?

477
00:46:01,202 --> 00:46:02,499
Mom.

478
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:29,918
I don't know who you are out there,
but I have a gun.

479
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:34,016
So if I were you,
I'd split while I had a chance.

480
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,651
Okay?

481
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:50,806
Look, kid, just stay away.
We don't want any.

482
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,368
Shit!

483
00:47:57,681 --> 00:48:00,081
Get out of here, you little freak.

484
00:48:08,524 --> 00:48:10,924
Lucky for you I like kids.

485
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:21,101
Jeez! There goes the neighborhood.

486
00:48:38,185 --> 00:48:39,243
Shit.

487
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,294
Audrey, what's the code?

488
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:10,511
We found survivors.

489
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:13,718
How long will the blood test take?

490
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,116
Not long.

491
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:21,489
I've talked with some of the others,
and we've decided

492
00:49:21,595 --> 00:49:25,997
that it would be more beneficial
to conduct the blood tests in the field.

493
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:29,567
So I want you to go to LA
with the rest of the group.

494
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,695
Whatever the majority wants.

495
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:40,370
You don't seem to hold
majority rule in very high regard.

496
00:49:40,947 --> 00:49:42,847
If something's wrong, it's wrong.

497
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:45,747
Majority rule doesn't have anything
to do with it.

498
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:48,350
But it goes straight
to the core purpose of our group,

499
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:49,887
which is to survive.

500
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,052
You'll grant me that?

501
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:56,353
The core purpose never included
bringing outsiders to the facility.

502
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:03,415
That's about the twelfth can
you've downed this morning.

503
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:04,587
Thirsty.

504
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:07,459
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do
when your complexion freaks out?

505
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,690
Dermatologist is dead, you know.

506
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,733
I know and I'm getting a rash
or something, too.

507
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,393
Oh, God. You and your rashes.

508
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:17,700
Hey, I'm sorry if the end of the world
makes me a little nervous.

509
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,511
So, do you like him?

510
00:51:28,517 --> 00:51:31,384
- Come on, Sam.
- I'm just interested.

511
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:38,121
Yeah, well, I guess so.
I mean, he's nice.

512
00:51:41,497 --> 00:51:44,159
There was this new guy at school.
Paul Morgan.

513
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:46,957
He transferred from Taft. Junior.

514
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:50,064
Oh, I don't hang around
with juniors much.

515
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,240
I liked him.

516
00:51:55,744 --> 00:51:59,201
I mean, he was from Taft,

517
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:03,549
but, he was nice.

518
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:12,491
Kathy said he was probably
gonna ask me out.

519
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:16,055
Huh, Kathy.

520
00:52:17,431 --> 00:52:20,093
She was flunking algebra
and she was trying to figure out some way

521
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:22,761
to keep her parents from finding out.

522
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:28,198
This is really a lucky break for her.

523
00:52:34,915 --> 00:52:38,146
No wonder I'm breaking out.
Think we could go home and change?

524
00:52:38,253 --> 00:52:42,881
- Why don't we get a little creative?
- What?

525
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:47,720
- Do you have your a,
do you have your MasterCard on you?
- No.

526
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:50,593
Good, 'cause you don't need it.

527
00:52:50,697 --> 00:52:52,994
The stores are open!

528
00:54:02,499 --> 00:54:07,368
Hey, Reg, which do you like better?
This?

529
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,465
Second one. Yeah. Definitely.

530
00:54:11,576 --> 00:54:14,941
- How come?
- 'Cause it'll stay in style longer.

531
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:18,178
- Come on.
- I guess you're right, actually.

532
00:54:18,282 --> 00:54:21,376
Yeah, we got to think
of these things, you know?

533
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,365
Well, let's do it.

534
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:53,279
- You know, I've been thinking.
- Don't set any dangerous precedents.

535
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,714
What if Hector's got
the same problem we have?

536
00:54:55,817 --> 00:54:59,720
- Such as?
- Such as, no guys.

537
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,417
- What?
- Really.

538
00:55:04,294 --> 00:55:06,387
I mean, what if Hector's gay?

539
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,328
- I'm sure.
- Think it over.

540
00:55:11,434 --> 00:55:13,663
You said he didn't
come on to you last night.

541
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,735
So?

542
00:55:14,836 --> 00:55:18,737
So that means that the last guy on earth
is either a gentleman or a fag.

543
00:55:19,074 --> 00:55:21,735
I mean, what are the odds? In LA?

544
00:55:22,878 --> 00:55:26,210
Things could be very interesting
around here, Regina.

545
00:55:39,928 --> 00:55:42,191
Attention, shoppers.

546
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:46,190
I trust you've got credit cards
to pay for all that stuff.

547
00:56:14,694 --> 00:56:17,094
What's the matter?
Lost something?

548
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:20,757
Check with lost and found
on the second floor.

549
00:56:21,634 --> 00:56:23,295
Didn't find this one.

550
00:56:32,545 --> 00:56:35,036
You dirty rat.

551
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,885
Get her, boys!

552
00:57:40,978 --> 00:57:42,171
Woa!

553
00:58:05,302 --> 00:58:07,463
Bummer!

554
00:58:11,641 --> 00:58:14,303
Well, I think it's time
to take the high ground.

555
00:58:20,683 --> 00:58:25,279
Listen, you guys, we're expecting
some friends here any minute.

556
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,183
Look, you just split now, okay,
and we'll Tell them not to hurt you.

557
00:58:34,463 --> 00:58:36,555
No imagination.

558
00:58:58,418 --> 00:59:00,045
Look, over there.

559
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:09,853
Hey!

560
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:14,594
- Hey!
- Eat glass, creeps!

561
00:59:16,837 --> 00:59:18,702
How did you like that?

562
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:26,045
You guys are a bunch of wimps!
You can't hit anything.

563
00:59:28,115 --> 00:59:29,241
Hi.

564
00:59:39,459 --> 00:59:40,653
Get her.

565
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,408
Knock that shit off!

566
01:00:06,919 --> 01:00:09,682
Hello out there in Television Land.

567
01:00:11,058 --> 01:00:13,389
All right. Here's the deal.

568
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:17,858
If bachelorette number one
isn't out here in half a tick,

569
01:00:17,963 --> 01:00:22,592
I'm going to ice bachelorette number two.
Got it?

570
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:39,944
Come on.

571
01:00:44,789 --> 01:00:46,120
Let her go.

572
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:51,016
I'm sorry, miss, I can't have you
holding one of my people hostage.

573
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:54,994
Even if you pull the trigger,
I can still take him out. And you.

574
01:00:55,165 --> 01:00:56,826
Come on, Willy, she means it.

575
01:00:56,934 --> 01:00:59,334
Miss, you're not getting the point.

576
01:00:59,436 --> 01:01:02,598
I can't have you holding
one of my people hostage.

577
01:01:08,312 --> 01:01:09,745
You're crazy!

578
01:01:09,847 --> 01:01:12,610
I'm not crazy.
I just don't give a fuck.

579
01:01:13,651 --> 01:01:16,414
- What do you think, 20, 30 minutes?
- No more.

580
01:01:16,553 --> 01:01:19,646
They could be anywhere by now.
Let's go back.

581
01:01:19,789 --> 01:01:23,417
- Let's apply a little deductive reasoning.
- Deductive reasoning?

582
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:28,129
Where would adolescents
with nothing to do go?

583
01:01:34,671 --> 01:01:38,538
See, we worked really hard to
get ahead in this business, girls.

584
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:41,166
And we don't get shit for it!

585
01:01:42,245 --> 01:01:43,576
But we do it...

586
01:01:43,913 --> 01:01:46,575
because we know we can work
our way up through the system.

587
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:47,842
And the system works

588
01:01:47,949 --> 01:01:52,351
Why, just a few days ago,
we were only stock boys.

589
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,051
Now we own the store.
The American way.

590
01:01:57,459 --> 01:01:59,289
And then this happens.

591
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,222
What are you talking about?

592
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:07,931
I'm talking about you
coming in here and ripping us off.

593
01:02:08,036 --> 01:02:11,232
What do you want?
You want us to pay for it? What?

594
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:17,507
You wouldn't believe
what we want from you.

595
01:02:17,879 --> 01:02:22,746
In your worst nightmare,
you wouldn't believe.

596
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:30,183
Let's play a game.
It's called ‘Scary Noises’.

597
01:02:32,093 --> 01:02:34,584
This is the closest shopping arcade,
but the whole area

598
01:02:34,695 --> 01:02:37,289
is an absolute monument
to consumerism.

599
01:02:37,498 --> 01:02:39,328
All we can do is hope.

600
01:02:39,534 --> 01:02:42,434
Check all the fiords,
including the basement.

601
01:02:49,709 --> 01:02:53,201
Isn't that a scary noise?
Wanna hear it again?

602
01:02:54,547 --> 01:02:57,141
Gosh! The suspense is killing me.

603
01:02:59,285 --> 01:03:00,912
Let's do it again.

604
01:03:03,189 --> 01:03:06,646
An E-ticket attraction.
Let's do it again.

605
01:03:10,529 --> 01:03:12,190
Now wait a minute.

606
01:03:12,332 --> 01:03:15,358
I don't think
there's really a bullet in here.

607
01:03:16,202 --> 01:03:19,829
No. Now, see there, it's loaded.

608
01:03:20,038 --> 01:03:22,836
I just needed
to be a little more patient.

609
01:03:23,343 --> 01:03:26,368
I think this is it, girls.
I really do.

610
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:54,165
We're not with these guys.

611
01:03:54,272 --> 01:03:56,740
Really, like, we just met them
an hour ago.

612
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,977
I mean, look at this stuff.
Look at this skirt.

613
01:04:02,513 --> 01:04:06,812
It's ironic. Of all the great minds
of the world, all the great intellects,

614
01:04:06,918 --> 01:04:10,183
- Who should survive? Or almost survive?
- I’m so thirsty

615
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:14,714
I don't have to see the result
of the blood test.

616
01:04:14,826 --> 01:04:17,590
I can guess
what they say about that one.

617
01:04:20,931 --> 01:04:22,397
You're right.

618
01:04:23,266 --> 01:04:27,168
It would be senseless to take her back.
Look, I'll stay and take care of it.

619
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:31,227
Then if this Hector person shows up,
I can run tests on him, too.

620
01:04:31,608 --> 01:04:36,010
Of course, it would be out of the question
to let you remain by yourself.

621
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:39,015
I'll stay here with you.

622
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,433
Listen, thanks for suggesting
that I wait for Hector.

623
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:06,701
I mean, I know Reggie'll probably get him,
but I'd like to have a shot at it.

624
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:09,175
Samantha, I need you to lie down.

625
01:05:09,712 --> 01:05:11,873
Hector's not exactly a fox,

626
01:05:12,815 --> 01:05:15,578
but considering what's left,
he's not bad.

627
01:05:15,985 --> 01:05:20,114
- He sounds cute. Is he coming back?
- Yeah.

628
01:05:20,856 --> 01:05:23,915
But we should wait for him
at the radio station.

629
01:05:24,259 --> 01:05:26,988
That's where he'll go.
What's that?

630
01:05:29,197 --> 01:05:31,688
- I'm going to give you something.
- For what?

631
01:05:32,532 --> 01:05:36,366
Well, your skin's
been a little irritated.

632
01:05:36,871 --> 01:05:38,304
Yeah, a rash.

633
01:05:38,406 --> 01:05:42,205
It could be a rash,
but it could also be something else.

634
01:05:42,476 --> 01:05:45,036
- That's one of the main symptoms of...
- The comet? No.

635
01:05:45,146 --> 01:05:49,845
See, I always get rashes,
like, when I have a fight with Doris,

636
01:05:49,951 --> 01:05:52,510
or I break up with a boyfriend.
It's nerves.

637
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:55,644
And you know, the way things have
been going around here lately,

638
01:05:55,757 --> 01:05:58,850
I'm surprised I don't
look like strawberry Jell-O.

639
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:04,422
But if I do have that stuff,
this will get rid of it, right?

640
01:06:06,566 --> 01:06:09,057
- Yeah.
- God, you had me worried.

641
01:06:10,903 --> 01:06:13,895
Don't worry. Just a pinch now.

642
01:06:21,748 --> 01:06:24,340
Ow!
So, you guys are, like, geniuses, right?

643
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:28,152
Yeah, I thought so.

644
01:06:35,895 --> 01:06:38,294
We have a couple of
geniuses at my school.

645
01:06:38,698 --> 01:06:41,222
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

646
01:07:00,718 --> 01:07:01,981
Is...

647
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:05,387
Is that it?

648
01:07:07,526 --> 01:07:09,891
What did you want me to do, Oscar,

649
01:07:09,995 --> 01:07:12,861
take her out back
and shoot her in the head?

650
01:07:13,631 --> 01:07:17,726
I simply meant
I was glad it was painless.

651
01:07:19,604 --> 01:07:22,163
I don't think we have to stay around.

652
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:25,603
She didn't think that he was coming back.

653
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:27,637
I feel we can wait.

654
01:07:28,947 --> 01:07:30,072
But...

655
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:35,377
I feel the radio station
is the more logical place.

656
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:43,358
Listen, Oscar, you were right
about the condition being progressive.

657
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,552
But it is also accelerating,
apparently.

658
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:50,361
We don't have weeks.

659
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:52,995
We have maybe hours.
I don't know.

660
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:56,398
- We have a commitment.
- But I do know I don't have enough

661
01:07:56,506 --> 01:08:01,442
to debate the issue. I am not going to be
a party to taking anybody else back.

662
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,943
You have to live up to it.

663
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:09,080
What do you expect me to do, Oscar,
go for my gun?

664
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,042
Of course not.

665
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,595
It's 450 FM in the p.m.
I'm Steve LaBeau,

666
01:08:54,696 --> 01:08:58,095
and you're listening to 50,000 watts
of rock 'n'roll at the tower of power

667
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,167
over the City of Angels.

668
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:23,182
Reggie! Merry Christmas.

669
01:09:27,894 --> 01:09:29,088
Reggie?

670
01:09:35,401 --> 01:09:37,301
Samantha?

671
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:43,809
Hi.

672
01:09:45,044 --> 01:09:46,011
Hi.

673
01:09:49,716 --> 01:09:54,243
Did you happen to see two girls
running around here?
One is a cheerleader.

674
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,350
I'm not thinking straight.

675
01:09:58,323 --> 01:10:02,816
I wrote everything down,
but I think I misspelled it.

676
01:10:03,228 --> 01:10:05,162
That pad on the table.

677
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:11,067
- You need this?
- No, thanks. I have one.

678
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:16,270
It seems to be
the perfect Christmas gift this year.

679
01:10:17,276 --> 01:10:21,735
I'm going to miss Christmas,
permanently.

680
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:29,051
I want you to know that
I thought they were talking hypothetically,

681
01:10:29,353 --> 01:10:31,582
until they found the first survivors.

682
01:10:31,689 --> 01:10:33,623
Then they really did it.

683
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,028
Some of those survivors were just kids.

684
01:10:38,129 --> 01:10:40,892
Hey, wait a minute.
What's all this about blood?

685
01:10:44,302 --> 01:10:46,668
They think they can generate a serum.

686
01:10:47,471 --> 01:10:52,407
- A serum?
- We were exposed. Not a lot. Just enough.

687
01:10:53,878 --> 01:10:57,972
They left the ventilating ducts wide open.
The fans going.

688
01:10:58,216 --> 01:11:00,307
Very scientific.

689
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:01,946
Very stupid.

690
01:11:04,654 --> 01:11:09,590
In 36 hours,
you will be able to vacuum up

691
01:11:09,759 --> 01:11:11,590
the last of them from the carpet.

692
01:11:14,464 --> 01:11:17,864
Hey, you know what?

693
01:11:19,736 --> 01:11:23,035
She was right. You are cute.

694
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:27,274
Santa Claus.

695
01:11:39,588 --> 01:11:40,815
Hey.

696
01:11:58,973 --> 01:12:00,702
Have you ever had hepatitis?

697
01:12:00,808 --> 01:12:02,206
Darned tags.

698
01:12:02,677 --> 01:12:04,144
You have a pair of scissors?

699
01:12:05,246 --> 01:12:07,874
No. Have you ever had hepatitis?

700
01:12:10,985 --> 01:12:12,316
Cute kids.

701
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,018
They part of you guys?

702
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:19,423
No. They're survivors just like you are.

703
01:12:19,694 --> 01:12:22,322
- Neat girl, huh?
- If you like the type.

704
01:12:23,231 --> 01:12:25,095
Come on, kids. Come with me.

705
01:12:27,502 --> 01:12:29,525
Have you ever had hepatitis?

706
01:12:32,773 --> 01:12:37,539
No. I had mono once, though.
Caught it from this guy named Randy Sharp.

707
01:12:38,845 --> 01:12:40,971
- Anemia?
- No.

708
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:44,912
- Are you pregnant?
- No. Thought I was once, though.

709
01:12:46,754 --> 01:12:50,189
- That's not important.
- That's what you think.

710
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:53,156
It was the longest three weeks
of my life.

711
01:12:58,397 --> 01:12:59,728
You know, I can't remember.

712
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,959
How much blood were we expected
to get from these people?

713
01:13:03,136 --> 01:13:06,627
Oh, 300 ccs. Yes, that's it.

714
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:10,936
That can't be right. If we draw 300 ccs
a day, they'll expire altogether.

715
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:12,202
No, I don't think so,

716
01:13:12,311 --> 01:13:14,835
now that we've
terminated brain functions.

717
01:13:14,947 --> 01:13:16,574
I mean, they're brain-dead.

718
01:13:16,682 --> 01:13:19,878
All they can do now
is manufacture blood.

719
01:13:20,853 --> 01:13:23,048
Well, maybe.

720
01:13:23,956 --> 01:13:27,482
We aren't gonna get anything like 300 ccs
out of those children.

721
01:13:27,793 --> 01:13:29,555
No. But, we will out of that teenager.

722
01:13:29,661 --> 01:13:32,060
I hope she's just as healthy as she looks.

723
01:13:32,163 --> 01:13:36,258
Boy, did you see her hair?
What I'd give to have hair like that.

724
01:13:38,336 --> 01:13:39,802
What is this place?

725
01:13:41,507 --> 01:13:43,064
Do you have diabetes?

726
01:13:43,175 --> 01:13:47,543
I mean, is this some sort of,
I don't know, underground hospital
or what?

727
01:13:50,247 --> 01:13:52,909
You're a very strong-willed young lady.

728
01:13:53,485 --> 01:13:56,817
- Cancer.
- You have cancer?

729
01:13:57,088 --> 01:13:59,113
No, I am a Cancer.

730
01:13:59,456 --> 01:14:02,892
I just want to know where I am
and what I'm doing here.

731
01:14:16,574 --> 01:14:19,803
Oops. Oh, gosh.
Could you hand me that arterial...

732
01:14:19,911 --> 01:14:21,070
Got it.

733
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:31,486
Well, it's up to the respirators now.

734
01:14:31,989 --> 01:14:33,455
Why don't we prep the children?

735
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:36,683
When we're finished with them,
we can start on that girl.

736
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,895
They're so cute.
I love working with kids.

737
01:14:40,296 --> 01:14:42,991
Yeah. Don't forget the lights.

738
01:14:48,137 --> 01:14:50,367
Are you taking any medication?

739
01:14:55,977 --> 01:14:59,914
Have you had any medication
within the last 24 hours?

740
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:03,983
Where's my sister?

741
01:15:07,789 --> 01:15:09,915
Dr. Carter, may I see you a moment?

742
01:15:11,892 --> 01:15:13,190
All right.

743
01:15:13,295 --> 01:15:15,387
I mean, she should be here by now,
shouldn't she,

744
01:15:15,497 --> 01:15:17,021
even if Hector didn't show up?

745
01:15:17,132 --> 01:15:20,066
Your sister’s dead.

746
01:15:22,938 --> 01:15:26,271
- What?
- I realize this comes as a shock,

747
01:15:27,142 --> 01:15:30,837
but she had been exposed, and in 48 hours
she would have died anyway.

748
01:15:31,912 --> 01:15:34,380
It was quite painless,
I can assure you.

749
01:15:42,257 --> 01:15:44,588
You both have nice, strong hearts.

750
01:15:44,692 --> 01:15:47,421
- Are we going to get shots?
- No.

751
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:50,286
No shots. I promise.

752
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:52,492
- Audrey?
- They're not back yet.

753
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,124
Listen, we may have a situation
on our hands here.

754
01:15:55,236 --> 01:15:58,137
I can't locate Rogers
anyplace in the compound.

755
01:15:59,907 --> 01:16:04,205
I can't rule out the possibility that
he may already have gone into transition.

756
01:16:07,013 --> 01:16:08,775
We can't wait for Audrey.

757
01:16:09,215 --> 01:16:11,945
You're gonna have to start
with the children and that one in there.

758
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:14,451
We need blood to develop the serum.

759
01:16:14,554 --> 01:16:17,021
We don't have enough for everyone.

760
01:16:18,591 --> 01:16:22,890
We're not robots, Doctor. We're not
all going to fall over at one time.

761
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:24,896
Some of us will last a little longer.

762
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:28,057
While others of us
have more immediate needs.

763
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,894
You're smart.
You can figure that out.

764
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:33,028
Psychology is not an exact science,

765
01:16:33,138 --> 01:16:36,574
but, my God, man,
anybody can add two and two.

766
01:16:41,212 --> 01:16:45,842
I'm very sorry about your sister.
It's a tragedy.

767
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:48,144
It truly is.

768
01:16:54,994 --> 01:16:57,393
And I can understand your hostility.

769
01:16:57,496 --> 01:16:59,122
But no matter how upset you are,

770
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:03,029
breaking an expensive piece
of equipment won't solve anything.

771
01:17:03,533 --> 01:17:07,230
I mean, striking out at inanimate objects
is really quite childish.

772
01:17:07,872 --> 01:17:10,237
Even you should be able to realize that.

773
01:17:13,344 --> 01:17:14,311
Jerk.

774
01:17:43,174 --> 01:17:45,437
Howdy, partner. How you doing?

775
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:51,273
- Who are you?
- The name is Hec. Hec Gomez.

776
01:17:53,984 --> 01:17:57,750
Hey, them's real fine duds you got there.
You a Maytag repairman?

777
01:17:58,788 --> 01:18:01,222
How did you find this place?

778
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:04,688
Well ah, this lady back in LA sent me.

779
01:18:05,128 --> 01:18:08,995
Hey, you been to LA lately?
It's cleaned out, man, I'm telling you.

780
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:12,796
Hey, come here.
I want to show you something. Come on.

781
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:18,172
Hey, you know how the harbor freeway
is always bumper to bumper?

782
01:18:18,273 --> 01:18:21,071
Well, you can go 150 miles an hour
if you want to.

783
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,439
Me and this baby,

784
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:27,072
we go through them freeways
like turkey crap through a tin horn.

785
01:18:32,489 --> 01:18:33,511
Hey...

786
01:18:36,557 --> 01:18:38,548
You like girls?

787
01:18:40,094 --> 01:18:43,530
Look in here.

788
01:18:46,901 --> 01:18:49,164
- She's dead.
- She ain't dead.

789
01:18:49,437 --> 01:18:51,564
See, this lady shot her up
with sodium pentothal

790
01:18:51,673 --> 01:18:54,163
to make this fellow think
she was dead,

791
01:18:58,346 --> 01:19:01,042
So you wouldn't suck her blood out,
you asshole.

792
01:19:04,919 --> 01:19:06,818
Son of a bitch!

793
01:19:08,989 --> 01:19:09,956
Shit!

794
01:19:20,267 --> 01:19:21,962
Excuse me, everyone.

795
01:19:22,302 --> 01:19:24,964
I'm afraid our adolescent guest
has escaped.

796
01:19:25,305 --> 01:19:26,999
She's quite hostile.

797
01:19:27,207 --> 01:19:28,572
She may have already gone topside,

798
01:19:28,675 --> 01:19:31,439
so please take a moment
and look around you.

799
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,128
Check those rooms,
and I'll check this one.

800
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,945
Let's go.

801
01:22:04,525 --> 01:22:07,358
- Everything is under control.
- Good.

802
01:22:37,223 --> 01:22:38,849
You said no shots.

803
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:41,290
This isn't a shot, sweetheart.
It'll just...

804
01:22:42,828 --> 01:22:44,160
You'll just giggle

805
01:22:44,264 --> 01:22:46,095
and then you'll feel a little sleepy.

806
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:47,756
That's right.

807
01:22:47,867 --> 01:22:50,165
And when you wake up,
do you know where you'll be?

808
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:53,433
- Where?
- With Santa Claus at the North Pole.

809
01:22:53,539 --> 01:22:57,474
In fact, you'll live with Santa Claus
for the rest of your life.

810
01:22:57,709 --> 01:23:00,269
Hey, there's no such thing as Santa Claus.

811
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:04,679
What? You don't believe in Santa?

812
01:23:23,468 --> 01:23:25,459
Life support systems.

813
01:23:27,072 --> 01:23:30,802
- Wilson, come with me.
- Keep an eye on her.

814
01:23:30,909 --> 01:23:32,900
Yes.
Now, Wilson!

815
01:23:33,947 --> 01:23:36,107
Forget the door. Turn off the alarm.

816
01:23:51,662 --> 01:23:53,357
I don't know.

817
01:23:53,464 --> 01:23:56,864
My parents told me
never to breathe anything from strangers.

818
01:23:57,134 --> 01:23:58,101
Hey!

819
01:24:00,371 --> 01:24:02,201
Get your hands up.

820
01:24:08,144 --> 01:24:09,304
What are you guys doing?

821
01:24:09,412 --> 01:24:14,246
They said if we breathe this, we could go
to the North Pole and see Santa Claus.

822
01:24:14,484 --> 01:24:17,179
- That's so sick.
- Hey!

823
01:24:17,288 --> 01:24:19,687
- Holy shit!
- Whoa.

824
01:24:19,789 --> 01:24:21,882
- Sam?
- I give! I give!

825
01:24:22,425 --> 01:24:26,589
- They said you were dead.
- They were exaggerating totally.

826
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:31,294
- Hey, that's a great outfit.
- Thanks. Is that guy in the hallway dead?

827
01:24:32,335 --> 01:24:33,666
Don't.

828
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:46,345
Well?

829
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:53,148
You can give up if you want to, Wilson.

830
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:59,686
But we still have the two children
and that girl.

831
01:25:01,164 --> 01:25:02,460
I forgot my football.

832
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:05,862
- We'll get you another football.
- We'll get you a stadium.

833
01:25:07,903 --> 01:25:08,870
Now!

834
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:23,315
Get everybody topside, now!

835
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:26,581
- What about them?
- Screw them.

836
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:35,251
Okay, kids. Going up.

837
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:38,625
Put your hands down, kids.

838
01:25:38,765 --> 01:25:40,596
God, don't be so stupid.

839
01:25:52,913 --> 01:25:55,142
- Come on, kids.
- Who are the kids?

840
01:25:55,247 --> 01:25:56,771
- I'm Brian.
- I'm Sarah.

841
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:59,147
Yeah, and I'm Aunt Reg
and that's Aunt Sam

842
01:25:59,252 --> 01:26:00,446
and that's Uncle Hector.

843
01:26:00,553 --> 01:26:02,680
- Can I have my bunny?
- In a minute.

844
01:26:02,789 --> 01:26:05,417
- Beat feet, Uncle Hector.
- Uncle Hector?

845
01:26:05,591 --> 01:26:08,116
Hey, it's my bunny, you know.

846
01:26:15,935 --> 01:26:18,027
- Where have you been?
- Can we change this?

847
01:26:18,137 --> 01:26:21,629
- Arranging a hotfoot for your friends.
- I really hate this music.

848
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:23,138
Give me a break!

849
01:26:25,845 --> 01:26:27,938
- What are you doing?
- I'm not kidding.

850
01:26:28,046 --> 01:26:30,379
I get carsick without my bunny.

851
01:26:30,516 --> 01:26:34,748
- Come on, Reg. Give the kid the bunny.
- We've stopped. Why have we stopped?

852
01:26:34,855 --> 01:26:35,913
Son of a...

853
01:26:36,021 --> 01:26:37,716
Don't shoot them, you idiot.

854
01:26:37,823 --> 01:26:41,416
Okay, kids.
Cover your eyes for Uncle Hector.

855
01:26:43,795 --> 01:26:46,456
Hey! Think tank, huh?

856
01:26:47,298 --> 01:26:49,424
Look, couldn't we just, like, leave?

857
01:26:49,533 --> 01:26:51,229
Think over this.

858
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:56,371
- We can get them. We have to get them.
- Hey, we'll be taking off now.

859
01:26:56,474 --> 01:26:59,340
Look us up at Chasen's.
We'll party down, huh?

860
01:26:59,978 --> 01:27:02,468
- Come on.
- Come on. This is fun.

861
01:27:03,381 --> 01:27:05,848
The kids would like to say goodbye.
It's been fun.

862
01:27:05,949 --> 01:27:08,008
Hope to see you around real soon.

863
01:27:10,488 --> 01:27:12,284
Is that gasoline I smell?

864
01:27:17,027 --> 01:27:18,688
Wait. Wait, don't! Don't!

865
01:27:42,752 --> 01:27:45,152
Wow. All right, Hector.

866
01:28:01,136 --> 01:28:03,832
Let go of her!

867
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:07,001
Hector!

868
01:28:16,451 --> 01:28:17,644
It's okay.

869
01:28:18,653 --> 01:28:22,487
I got you. It's all right. It's okay.

870
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:24,651
I got you. Shhhhhh.

871
01:29:07,935 --> 01:29:11,598
Okay, kids. Smile. Come on.

872
01:29:12,705 --> 01:29:15,673
God, you're so cute.
You're just so cute. Wait.

873
01:29:16,908 --> 01:29:20,366
Mr. Bunny needs to be in this picture, too.
So, okay, that's great.

874
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,176
- Can I take this jacket off? It itches.
- No, you can't.

875
01:29:23,283 --> 01:29:24,874
I just want to take another picture.
all right?

876
01:29:24,984 --> 01:29:27,315
- Please?
- No. Now you just hold on to that.

877
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,444
- Stay there, okay? Perfect.
- Oh, brother.

878
01:29:29,555 --> 01:29:34,491
- There's still a few zombies around.
- Don't slouch. And, Sarah, hold that.

879
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:39,089
Smile.

880
01:29:40,366 --> 01:29:43,664
Did the flash go off?
You can't tell on these things.

881
01:29:43,768 --> 01:29:47,636
Hey, if you're gonna throw
those guns away, can I have one?

882
01:29:50,908 --> 01:29:54,435
Don't look at me. I mean, I don't know
where she gets that stuff.

883
01:29:57,684 --> 01:29:59,514
Smile, Hec.

884
01:30:02,455 --> 01:30:03,887
Handsome.

885
01:30:05,624 --> 01:30:08,058
Maybe I could be a nun or something.

886
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:10,558
I just love these pictures.

887
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:12,856
You've only taken about 30 of them.

888
01:30:12,964 --> 01:30:14,759
You know, we're going to need
more film soon.

889
01:30:14,865 --> 01:30:16,627
- Let me straighten your tie.
- Okay.

890
01:30:16,734 --> 01:30:18,860
God, they look like the Brady Bunch.

891
01:30:20,504 --> 01:30:22,233
What are you waiting for?

892
01:30:22,706 --> 01:30:24,173
Can I see them?

893
01:30:24,275 --> 01:30:28,268
- We're waiting for the light to change.
- We do not cross against the light.

894
01:30:31,315 --> 01:30:34,443
Are you nuts, ‘Auntie’ Regina?

895
01:30:35,186 --> 01:30:38,155
You may as well face the facts, Samantha.

896
01:30:38,255 --> 01:30:42,315
The whole burden of civiIization
has fallen upon us.

897
01:30:44,694 --> 01:30:46,889
What's that supposed to mean?

898
01:30:48,298 --> 01:30:51,027
It means we do not CROSS
against the light.

899
01:30:53,269 --> 01:30:55,237
That's totally stupid.

900
01:30:55,405 --> 01:31:00,341
There's nobody here. See?
We're talking ghost town!

901
01:31:08,651 --> 01:31:10,619
See what happens?

902
01:31:16,158 --> 01:31:19,821
God. I'm sorry, but you shouldn't cross
against the light like that.

903
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:25,157
- Hey, you guys are survivors, too, huh?
- Thank you.

904
01:31:27,803 --> 01:31:31,295
- What?
- Nothing. Great car.

905
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,702
Thanks. I have 23 of them.
You want to go for a ride?

906
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:37,141
More than you know.

907
01:31:40,048 --> 01:31:42,312
We don't know anything about this guy.

908
01:31:42,618 --> 01:31:44,677
Where's he from? What's his name?

909
01:31:44,851 --> 01:31:48,150
- What's your name?
- Danny Mason Keener.

910
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:50,257
Danny Mason Keener, okay?

911
01:31:51,458 --> 01:31:52,584
Yeah, all right.

912
01:31:52,694 --> 01:31:55,786
- Well, just be back by midnight, okay?
- Midnight?

913
01:31:56,963 --> 01:31:59,397
The burden of civilization is on us, okay?

914
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:02,833
Oh, yeah. Bitching, isn't it?
