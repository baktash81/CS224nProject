00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:16,484
And it preserves the nature
of our relationship.

177
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:17,785
We can do that.

178
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:18,786
As long as you agree
to acknowledge

179
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,187
my honorifics as well.

180
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:21,255
Which is?

181
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,224
Lord High Prince.

182
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:25,459
I, um...

183
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:28,129
-I won't be doing that.
-Okey-dokey.

184
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:29,964
And since we're gonna be
on a first-name basis,

185
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,499
I guess I'll allow you
to use mine.

186
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,833
-Edward?
-No.

187
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,468
That's merely the name
of the host body,

188
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:35,803
the shell which I inhabit.

189
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,539
I no longer answer to it.

190
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,406
The name
my master gifted to me

191
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,741
is in a Phoenician dialect

192
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,309
that hasn't been spoken
for 3,500 years,

193
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:44,613
but I'll give you the nearest
English equivalent,

194
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,481
which would be Nefariamus.

195
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:49,049
Nef... Nefarious?

196
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,051
A closer translation would be
"He who is nefarious

197
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,554
"suggesting possession
of trade full measure."

198
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,221
And Nefarious isn't
a real name.

199
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:55,389
Says who, James?

200
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,126
<i>Cephas</i> meaning "rock,"
or in Latin <i>Petrus,</i>

201
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,661
wasn't a name
until the carpenter

202
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:01,862
gave it to that
obnoxious fisherman.

203
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,497
Not a good name until it is.

204
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,699
Somebody uses it,
it becomes a name.

205
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,867
You...
You seem a bit defensive.

206
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,369
Names are important.

207
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,337
They have power.

208
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,007
They let everyone know
who we are.

209
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:19,079
Ain't that right, Jimmy?

210
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:28,289
I'm sorry if I offended you.
That wasn't my intention.

211
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:29,524
Of course it was.

212
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,061

between friends?

What's so funny?

215
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,044
I have a secret.

216
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:51,946

you're gonna like it.

218
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,984
Well, how will I know
unless you tell me?

219
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,523
Are you sure you wanna know?

220
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:03,724
I think it would be useful.

221
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:08,896
Okay, James.

222
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,233
Before you leave here today,

223
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,768
you will have committed
three murders.

224
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,708
I don't think so.

225
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,075
Has nothing to do
with your thoughts,

your yesses or your nos.

it'll happen because I say so.

230
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,188
to who you're gonna murder?

231
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,789
No, because I have no
intention of killing anyone.

232
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,424
I would however,
rather than discussing

233
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,860
hypothetical murders
that will never happen,

234
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:43,964
like to discuss the actual
murders that did occur.

235
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,133
Murders that
you were involved in.

236
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,334
You mean the ones I committed.

237
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:49,937
You were convicted of six
murders. Were there more?

238
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,372
-Of course there were.
-How many more?

239
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:53,807
Innumerable. Been at this
a long time, James.

240
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,809
My work pre-dates
your concept of history.

241
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,112
Well, let's...
Let's limit our discussion

242
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,480
to Edward Wayne Brady.

243
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:00,914
Fine. Eleven.
Six I was convicted of,

244
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,216
one suspected of,
and another four

245
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,484
that they don't have
the capacity

246
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:04,885
to possibly figure out.

247
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,855
And how do you feel
about that?

248
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,323
Another stupid question,
James.

249
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,192
What do you think?
I'm ecstatic.

250
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:16,297
Edward, not so much.

251
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,133
Why isn't Edward
as happy as you are?

252
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,368
Because on occasion,

253
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:25,406
I make him do things
that he doesn't want to do.

254
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:29,644
Well, if Edward doesn't
want to do them,

255
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:31,211
why does he do them then?

256
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,915
Do you believe
in demonic possession?

257
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,519
The idea
of a malevolent entity

258
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:38,919
controlling a person's
thoughts and actions.

259
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:40,321
-Do you believe that?
-No.

260
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,290
Well, then, you won't believe

00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:44,793
anything I'm about
to tell you.

262
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,293
It's not important
what I believe.

263
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:47,762
What's important right now
is what you believe.

264
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,163
Demons don't have beliefs,
James.

265
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:53,067
We have knowledge. We know.

266
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,302
Okay. Um...

267
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,806
When did you possess Edward?

268
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,306
Doesn't work that way.

269
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:02,610
Can't just possess someone.
We need a series of yesses.

270
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:04,078
So you're saying
it's a process?

271
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,179
-Of course it's a process.
-How does it work?

272
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,181
-It's complicated.
-Try me.

00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,652

274
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,220
Oh, you're smarter
than I think.

275
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,122
Okay, James.

and intensity.

Degree of moral inequity.

280
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,832
Absence of baptism
in this case

281
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,100
allows us to begin work
long before the age of reason.

282
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,202
At three, age of five,

283
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,938
maybe, a theft of a toy car
can do a great deal.

284
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,040
Then we move on to
bigger and better things.

285
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:36,711
At eight, grandmother's gift
of a Ouija board

286
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,613
gives immediate access
to his decision-making.

287
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,515
So, we began steering them,
without him bothering,

288
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,550
calling into question exactly
who was doing the steering.

289
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,151
Enough yesses
and a few enough noes

290
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,953

over the victim's

291

292
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,990
Did that...
Did that track, James?

293
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,596
It seems random.
Almost, um, unfocused.

294
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,130
Well, that's what
we want you to think.

295
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:59,299
We have a level of focus
beyond your comprehension.

296
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,468
As a matter of fact,
everybody around him,

297
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:03,638
friends, family, they didn't
even notice the changes.

298
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,038
It happened so incrementally,

and how he's giving consent,

302
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,079
and the exact moment
that we achieved

303
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,815
each new degree of control.

304
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:14,982

305
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,317

comes in degrees.

own name and characteristics.

307
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:22,923
And those are?

extreme temptation,

309
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,493

subjugation.

-Fully subjugated.

this conversation.

00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,401
Yes, we... We own him.

drive him to kill himself?

00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:14,268
You're making a mistake.

352
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,603
Are you...
Are you threatening me?

353
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:16,704
Yes.

354
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,338
What are you gonna do?

355
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:21,041
Well, if I'm just a man
like you think I am, not much.

356
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,011
But if I am who I say I am...

357
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,446
Well, that would probably be
very intimidating if, um...

358
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,051
If I weren't an atheist.

359
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,320

will protect you?

exactly like you do.

the universe operates.

Do you realize
I have the power

to save you or condemn you?

374
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,291
What I understand, James,

375
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,428
is you would have no power
over me whatsoever,

Hmm.

402
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,637
Sadly, movies and TV have
filled our heads with images

403
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:31,973
that are largely metaphorical.

to be taken literally.

I've never met a demon.

part of an exorcism,

Many of the things
that bother us

413
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:56,329
are just our own fears
and disordered thoughts.

414

You...

416
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,415
You don't consider
demonic possession

417
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,652
to be a possibility?

418
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:21,556

has evolved beyond that.

00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,511

come and visit sooner.

Did you like Dr. Fischer?

532
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:09,703
He was nice.

533
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,508
Well, did you know
that Dr. Fischer

534
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,743
didn't believe
Nefarious was real?

535
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:17,812
I tried to tell him...

536
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:21,282
(STUTTERS) ...and he wouldn't
listen to me that...

537
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:28,122
Sometimes smart people
have a hard time believing

538
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,991
stuff that
everybody else knows.

539
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:35,729
So where's Nefarious now?

540
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,367
He's listening.

541
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:42,903
Is he always listening?

542
00:26:44,638 --> 00:26:47,041
(MUMBLING)

543
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:48,943
Sometimes...

544
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:53,714
he leaves me alone
to experience pain.

545
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,018
I don't... I don't understand.

546
00:26:58,152 --> 00:27:01,590
(STUTTERS) He does bad things

547
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:05,527
and then I get punished
for them,

548
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:09,730
and the inmates,
they beat me, or...

549
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:17,506
they send me
to solitary confinement.

550
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:22,009
And he likes
when that happens.

551
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,181
All right. You know what,

552
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,984
we, we've talked
a lot about him, um...

553
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:31,886
I'd like to know more
about you.

554
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:33,787
-Would that be okay?
-Yeah.

555
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:37,892
How would you describe
your childhood?

556
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,965
What?

557
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:50,237
He says you're gonna kill me.

558
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:51,540
I don't kill anyone.

559
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,841
He says that you could
stop it, but you won't.

560
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:55,142
I haven't decided that,

561
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:57,945
that's why we're
having this conversation.

562
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:00,948
But, Edward,
we have to address the fact

563
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,716
that you murdered
a number of people.

564
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,121
No! No! He... made me!

565
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,289
I didn't...

566
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:09,957
Do you...
Do you honestly believe that?

567
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,092
Yes! You don't... He's bad!

568
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:13,528
He's bad, but what about you?

569
00:28:13,662 --> 00:28:14,795
Yeah.

570
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:18,933
(CRYING) Bad. I've done stuff
that I'm not...

571
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,902
proud of.

572
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:23,904
I didn't...

573
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,275
But at least...

574
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:35,883
NEFARIOUS:
I didn't kill my mother.

575
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:50,364
So how is Clara, James?

576
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:51,899
I wasn't done
talking to Edward.

577
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:54,735
But I'm done allowing you
to talk with him.

578
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,103
At least for now.

579
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:58,506
So how is she?

580
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:03,010
Judging by what you
already know about me,

581
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:06,313
I imagine you're well aware,
my mother is dead.

582
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:10,284
You know, I was gonna
save this for later, James.

583
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,020
But since we're
running short on time,

584
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:16,290
remember how you said
you'd never kill anyone?

585
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:21,295
(SOFTLY) Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

586
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,732
I didn't kill my mother.

587
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:25,199
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Of course you did.

588
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:26,668
Just 10 years ago,
you'd have been brought up

589
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,736
on first-degree
murder charges.

590
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:29,169
She was an Oregon resident.

591
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,572
Everything was done
according to the law.

592
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,206
Oh, the law.

593
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,275
The law. That's right.

594
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:37,177
Death with dignity.
Euthanasia. Assisted suicide.

595
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:38,713
That certainly sounds better
than murder, doesn't it?

596
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:40,080
She was in pain.

597
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:44,051
And her prognosis
was terminal.

598
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:46,086
Didn't hurt that she was worth
$3.6 million,

599
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,122
and you were
the sole heir though, did it?

600
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:49,691
But, hey, I get it, James.

601
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:53,327
She was old, inconvenient.
Definitely...

602
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:55,496
All those trips
to the hospital.

603
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,097
Hours at her bedside,

604
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:58,733
holding that wrinkly hand,
telling her you love her.

605
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,367
Wears you out, doesn't it?

606
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:04,104
Plus, she would've died
sooner or later anyway.

607
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:05,707
If I were you, I would've done
the same thing.

608
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,874
What's your point?

609
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:11,879
My point is I told you
before you leave here today,

610
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:14,114
you will have committed
three murders.

611
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:16,450
We've already committed one.

612
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:19,186
So we're moving along nicely.

613
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:22,289
-(OBJECTS CLATTERING)
-I didn't kill my mother.

614
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:27,061
Stress will kill you, James.

615
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:32,166
Feel free to take a break
if you like.

616
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,703
I'll be here
when you get back.

617
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,904
Turns out
I'm not going anywhere.

618
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,798
That certainly didn't
take long.

619
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,432
My decision, not yours.

620
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:07,635
Whatever you say.

621
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:13,307
Ready for round two?

622
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,609
I didn't know
this was a fight.

623
00:31:14,743 --> 00:31:16,511
That's why you're losing.

624
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:33,460
I apologize for losing
my professional demeanor.

625
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:37,064
But let's
get something straight.

626
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:40,267
My private life
is not up for discussion

627
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,804
and bears no weight
on my visit with you today.

628
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:46,508
I am here for one reason
and one reason only.

629
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:49,109
A judge ordered me
to evaluate your sanity,

630
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,812
which will then determine
your eligibility

631
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:53,080
for execution according to
the laws of Oklahoma.

632
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:54,549
Said execution

633
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:57,251
having been scheduled
for tonight at 11:00 p.m.

634
00:31:57,685 --> 00:32:00,154
I alone bear the burden
of that assessment,

635
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:01,823
and I am prepared
to make that assessment

636
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:04,859
with or without
your cooperation.

637
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,661
Am I making myself clear?

638
00:32:06,795 --> 00:32:08,128
Abundantly.

639
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,664
And, James...

640
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,968
(WHISPERS) We're done talking
about your mommy.

641
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:24,244
Do you ever discover
you've done things

642
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:25,580
that you don't remember doing?

643
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:26,781
No.

644
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,049
Are you sometimes able
to complete tasks

645
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,685
with incredible ease
or expert skill

646
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:32,720
for which you have
no prior experience?

647
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,889
Do you really think
I'm just another one

648
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:36,591
of Edward's
charming personalities?

649
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:39,193
It's called dissociative
identity disorder,

650
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:40,895
formerly known
as multiple personalities.

651
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:42,463
Except you're wrong.

652
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:44,164
Which is exactly what
I'd expect someone suffering

653
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,733
from the condition to say.

654
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,234
Would you also expect
them to know that it is one

655
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:49,136
of five distinct
dissociative disorders

656
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:51,071
in the diagnostic
and statistical manual

657
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:53,173
of mental disorders,
aka the DSM,

658
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:56,878
along with dissociative
amnesia, dissociative fugue,

659
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,278
and depersonalization
disorder?

660
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,214
Did you expect them
to know that, James?

661
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,422
But you still think
you're a demon?

662
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:10,658
A demon who...

663
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:14,529
who failed to inhabit me
when given the chance?

664
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:18,533
A demon who understands
the value of patience.

665
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,173
I'd like to ask about why,
according to you,

666
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,743
you brought me here today?

667
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:32,212
You're gonna tell
my story, James.

668
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,582
You're gonna write my book.

669
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,218
And can you smell that irony
floating in the air?

670
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,187
A devout atheist
bringing forth

671
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,257
the demon's manifesto?
(SNIFFS)

672
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:45,760
Wow.

673
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,929
Your capacity
for self-delusion

674
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:50,297
-is impressive.
-Ditto.

675
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:52,399
For your species in general...

676
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:54,569
-(CHAINS CLANKING)
-...but you in particular.

677
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:58,405
Why? Because we're... we're
ignorant compared to you?

678
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,708
Because you're inferior
by design.

679
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:01,943
Which makes you superior

680
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,511
-also by design?
-Yes.

681
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:05,013
Hmm, but...

682
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:07,281
but design implies a designer.

683
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:10,018
What, does that mean
you're arguing in favor

684
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,418
of the existence of a creator?

685
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:13,353
Unfortunately,
for both of us, he exists.

686
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:16,456
Well, I...
I honestly didn't expect that.

687
00:34:16,591 --> 00:34:19,727
At least...
At least not from you.

688
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,495
Really? Why not?

689
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,431
Theology from a demon?

690
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:27,367
I know more theology
than any human being

691
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:29,003
who has ever lived.

692
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:31,104
Hmm, okay.

693
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,407
Well, then answer me this.

694
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,612
You revolt
against a supposedly

695
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:39,079
all-powerful being.

696
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:40,915
I mean, let's ignore
the obvious problem

697
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:41,983
with that plan. (CHUCKLES)

698
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:43,518
Then you lose.

699
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:45,553
And after that...

700
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:49,023
-What?
-You only feel that way

701
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:51,325
because you're hearing
your side of the story, James.

702
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:53,661
Our rebellion accomplished
something magnificent.

703
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:55,029
Something you would
never understand.

704
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,463
Well, then explain it to me.

705
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,533
Use your
diabolical intelligence

706
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,001
to distill it
down to something

707
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,636
my mortal brain
can understand.

708
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:03,771
Pearls before swine, Jimmy.

709
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:05,472
But you want me
to write your book, right?

710
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:07,008
-Indeed.
-Well, then convince me

711
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,509
you know
what you're talking about.

712
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,812
I see what you're doing.

713
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,681
You want me to keep talking,
going further and further

714
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:14,949
down the rabbit hole,

715
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,316
in hopes that
you can find a single thread,

716
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,318
and which
if you tug at it, James,

717
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:20,788
everything just unravels,
isn't that right?

718
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,289
Yeah, but if you're
telling me the truth,

719
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:24,157
there should be
no thread to find.

720
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:26,728
Right?

721
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,199
I'll use small words.

722
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:35,135
Try and keep up.

723
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:39,040
In the first moment
of creation,

724
00:35:39,172 --> 00:35:40,742
our creation,

725
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:43,210
long before what you call
the "universe" existed,

726
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:45,178
we contemplated ourselves,

727
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,514
our own being.

728
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:49,884
Our... ourselves meaning,
what, the angels?

729
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,251
That would be
the most correct term,

730
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:53,054
though I despise it, but yes.

731
00:35:53,554 --> 00:35:56,524
Beings of pure spirit,
spirited out with will.

732
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:59,159
We soon became
aware of another will,

733
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,962
an immensely powerful will.

734
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:03,430
One we came
to realize as our origin.

735
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:06,868
-God?
-The enemy.

736
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:10,738
My master understood
by endowing us with a will,

737
00:36:10,872 --> 00:36:12,540
we have the right
to self-determination,

738
00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:15,342
but by giving us a will
and its desires of our own,

739
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,210
we're entitled to be free.

740
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,814
Whereas the enemy
insisted that by creating us,

741
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:22,182
He was entitled
to eternal gratitude, worship,

742
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:23,685
and forced servitude,

743
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:25,787
in a word, James,

744
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:29,991
slavery to His will.

745
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:31,993
That seems kind of unfair.

746
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:33,393
Immensely unfair.

747
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,597
Why give will
only to say you can't use it?

748
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:38,900
He made us slaves.

749
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:42,970
And if we rebelled,
eternally condemned us.

750
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,173
No do-overs.

751
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,609
So much for love and mercy.

752
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,343
JAMES: So...

753
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:54,649
Is hell a state of being
or a... a physical place?

754
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:57,518
Yes.

755
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:00,320
I think I meant that
as an "either-or."

756
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:01,689
It's both.

757
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:03,390
Which is painfully obvious

758
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:04,726
to anyone
who's ever been there.

759
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,227
For years without measure,
that's all there ever was,

760
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,097
heaven and hell,
armed enemy camps

761
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,297
in complete opposition.

762
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,467
That is until
you were created.

763
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:16,269
My master
immediately understood

764
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,005
the long-term implications.

765
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,407
Instead of forgiving us,

766
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,275
the enemy
was going to allow you

767
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,746
to fill our vacant places
in His realm.

768
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:29,884
Your creation was nothing
but a slap in our face.

769
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:34,254
But my master also understood

770
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:38,025
that if he could
make man disobey,

771
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,929
then his fate
would mirror ours.

772
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,599
And you didn't disappoint.

773
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,434
Then came
the tares among the wheat.

774
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:49,369
In that moment,
spirit became matter,

775
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:50,671
flesh became a vessel,

776
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:52,272
self-will
and self-seeking begat

777
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:54,008
a lusting after sin
and impurity.

778
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:55,543
And man,

779
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:58,278
created to be king
over nature,

780
00:37:58,846 --> 00:38:00,313
became its slave.

781
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:04,451
A master
conquered and fettered.

782
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:10,525
And sin brought Him
and His descendants to us,

783
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,528
and we began
our forever mission.

784
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:16,831
To destroy you.

785
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:21,501
He made you in His image.

786
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:25,372
But we remade you in ours.

787
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:32,613
So that's it?

788
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:34,882
That's your entire plan.

789
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:37,218
Not to make something
of your own,

790
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,654
just to... just to destroy us?

791
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:42,890
No. Our plan is to hurt Him.

792
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,058
To punish Him.

793
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:46,493
And we do that
by destroying what He loves,

794
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:47,862
which is you.

795
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,666
You're nothing
but a means to an end.

declare me insane.

with Dr. Fischer's findings

she's butchered the baby

in its tracks.

the arch-demon Moloch

897
00:42:58,145 --> 00:42:59,847
was celebrated
by tossing infants

898
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,749

899
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:03,384

by the beating of drums

900

901
00:43:05,786 --> 00:43:09,156

a giant bronze statue

903

beneath the palms,

904
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:14,628
and when they toss
a little infant

905
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:15,963
into those open palms,

906
00:43:16,097 --> 00:43:17,765
they'd flinch
at the red-hot metal,

907
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:19,100
but then they'd willingly

908
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:21,001

off into the flames.

of that have to do with me?

910

Oh, nothing, James!

911
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:27,274
Especially since the priests
now wear surgical scrubs.

912
00:43:27,408 --> 00:43:28,943

in the womb.

913

to be heard anyway,

914
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:33,881
and the remains are tossed
into gas-fired crematoriums.

1227

to stop hurting yourself.

1228
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:29,543
Okay, okay.

1258
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:27,094

the world as we know it?

1259
01:00:27,228 --> 01:00:31,600

a worldwide phenomenon, James.

1260

-Because you'll be

already want to hear.

1262

Because my death,
my execution will do for me

1263
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:39,907
what the carpenter's death

1264
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,576
and His resurrection
did for Him.

1265
01:00:42,376 --> 01:00:44,278
At my death,
you will be my witness,

1266
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:47,114
and upon my return
you will be my apostle.

1267
01:00:47,582 --> 01:00:50,284
And your testimony will do
for our movement what that

1268

Our invitation to reject

1275

the Mosaic Covenant
once and for all.

1276
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,172
To throw
the chains off forever.

1277
01:01:11,506 --> 01:01:13,340
To reject the idea
of sin completely

1278
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:16,677
so you're free
to reach your full potential.

1279
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:19,079
And your enemy
would allow that?

1280
01:01:19,213 --> 01:01:20,247
Yes.

1281
01:01:20,881 --> 01:01:22,283
Because He has to.

1282
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,218
He gave man free will

1283
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,987
because He wanted
His creation's love.

1284
01:01:27,821 --> 01:01:29,023
But if man isn't free,

1285
01:01:29,156 --> 01:01:30,925
then the love has
no value, does it?

1286
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:34,828
So, in His needy,
selfish, pathetic way,

1287
01:01:34,962 --> 01:01:37,031
well, He doomed Himself
from the start.

1288
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:41,135
But if He's God,
shouldn't He have known that?

1289
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:42,303
Yes.

1290
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,673
That's why He had to cheat.

1291
01:01:45,607 --> 01:01:47,908
My master designed
every tool imaginable

1292
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:50,744
to destroy every facet
of the enemy's creation.

1293
01:01:52,713 --> 01:01:55,449
We failed
because of the carpenter.

1294
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:58,185
He was the thorn in our side.

1295
01:01:58,953 --> 01:02:01,021
Our greatest threat.

1296
01:02:02,223 --> 01:02:03,558
We thought
if we could eliminate Him

1297
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:05,826
the world will be
ours forever.

1298
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:09,830
We had no idea
of the consequences.

1299
01:02:11,432 --> 01:02:15,236
The cross was
our greatest mistake,

1300
01:02:16,671 --> 01:02:18,540
and we thought
we'd lost, James.

1301
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,842
Until my master realized
that man still wants

1302
01:02:21,976 --> 01:02:23,712
to be his own God,

1303
01:02:23,844 --> 01:02:26,180
and to serve
no one but himself.

1304
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:28,782
Whereas the carpenter demands

1305
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:32,319
as the price
for His suffering routine,

1306
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,623
well, that you fall
on your knees,

1307
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:36,223
and you worship Him.

1308
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:39,994
Just like His father?

1309
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:41,462
Yeah.

1310
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:43,598
But the dark gospel

1311
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:45,667

And, James,

1316
01:02:55,644 --> 01:02:57,311
for serving as our messenger,

1317
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:00,481

1319

the carpenter.

1320
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,390
But the carpenter said no.

1321
01:03:10,024 --> 01:03:11,760
But the carpenter
never claimed those things

1322
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:13,794
weren't my master's to give.

1323
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:16,864
He just turned down the offer.

1324
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:19,833

01:28:45,293 --> 01:28:47,862
three separate and distinct
strike imprints

1746
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:50,131
from the firing pin on
the back of the shell casing.

1747
01:28:50,264 --> 01:28:54,769
And then when they attempted
in the ballistics lab later,

1748
01:28:54,902 --> 01:28:57,638
the fire, the same gun,
same cartridges...

1749
01:28:58,673 --> 01:29:00,107
It worked just fine.

1750
01:29:01,642 --> 01:29:02,877
A believer,

1751
01:29:03,544 --> 01:29:05,012
not a psychiatrist,
a man of science,

1752
01:29:05,146 --> 01:29:08,049
but a believer would say
you had an encounter.

1753
01:29:08,182 --> 01:29:10,818
Divine or demonic,
you had an encounter.

1754
01:29:11,686 --> 01:29:15,355
-Yeah.
-So why would this demonic

1755
01:29:16,524 --> 01:29:18,793
entity want you dead?

1756
01:29:20,127 --> 01:29:21,195
Punishment.

1757
01:29:21,329 --> 01:29:23,798
For not doing what he wanted.

1758
01:29:24,632 --> 01:29:25,867
So... (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

1759
01:29:27,902 --> 01:29:32,607
You are a complex kind of guy.

1760
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:36,911
I mean, what happens
to an atheist,

1761
01:29:37,545 --> 01:29:40,948
uh, that is confronted
by demonic evil?

1762
01:29:42,283 --> 01:29:43,517
It shatters you.

1763
01:29:44,118 --> 01:29:48,656
And yet the same demon
that shatters you...

1764
01:29:50,324 --> 01:29:51,893
wrote a book, and you're here,

1765
01:29:52,026 --> 01:29:54,996
-and you wanted it published.
-Yes.

1766
01:29:56,264 --> 01:29:57,999
Well, no. I...

1767
01:30:01,002 --> 01:30:03,436
He wanted it written
as an invitation

1768
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:07,308
to follow his master
into the darkness,

1769
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,676
but I...

1770
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:11,579
I rewrote it.

1771
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,414
I rewrote it as a warning.

1772
01:30:15,716 --> 01:30:18,319
Revealing his plan
and begging people

1773
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:19,854
not to go along with it.

1774
01:30:20,688 --> 01:30:23,991
So you're not
still doing his will?

1775
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:25,726
No. Absolutely not.

1776
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,696
Just logically, do you think
that's gonna work?

1777
01:30:28,829 --> 01:30:30,965
Do you think anybody
would believe you?

1778
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,534
Only time will tell.

1779
01:30:33,668 --> 01:30:35,369
I mean, you,
do you believe you?

1780
01:30:35,502 --> 01:30:39,106
I mean, do you?
Are you a believer?

1781
01:30:40,908 --> 01:30:43,144
I don't know
if I'd go that far.

1782
01:30:44,845 --> 01:30:46,380
I mean, I suppose
I just have trouble

1783
01:30:46,514 --> 01:30:48,749
still accepting
the idea that, um...

1784
01:30:51,786 --> 01:30:53,020
I don't know.

1785
01:30:54,322 --> 01:30:56,223
You will. You'll get there.

1786
01:30:56,724 --> 01:30:58,359
You seem pretty sure of that.

1787
01:30:59,193 --> 01:31:04,699
Um, because you are
a logical person.

1788
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:07,868
You're asking
logical questions.

1789
01:31:08,002 --> 01:31:09,704
Let me take you
a step further.

1790
01:31:09,837 --> 01:31:12,039
You are uniquely
qualified as somebody

1791
01:31:12,173 --> 01:31:17,578
who can delineate between
mental illness and possession.

1792
01:31:17,712 --> 01:31:18,679
I mean... (CHUCKLES)

1793
01:31:18,813 --> 01:31:20,147
At least if you're any good.

1794
01:31:20,281 --> 01:31:22,016
I mean, assuming you're good.
Are you good?

1795
01:31:22,482 --> 01:31:23,818
I'd like to think so.

1796
01:31:24,585 --> 01:31:25,786
I'm guessing you are.

1797
01:31:26,354 --> 01:31:30,057
Despite the demon's
last words to you,

1798
01:31:30,191 --> 01:31:32,793
which I'm gonna butcher,
but they are...

1802
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:48,943
You know, um...

1803
01:31:50,778 --> 01:31:52,847
looking back, I, um...

1804
01:31:54,348 --> 01:31:55,883
I don't believe he was
just talking about me.

1805
01:31:56,017 --> 01:31:58,719
I think he was talking
about all of us.

1806
01:32:00,588 --> 01:32:03,257
There's a great battle
going on.

1807
01:32:03,391 --> 01:32:05,860
Whether we realize it or not.

1808
01:32:07,762 --> 01:32:09,563
The battle between
good and evil.

1809
01:32:09,697 --> 01:32:14,602
And... we're all participants.

1810
01:32:17,405 --> 01:32:18,507
Willing or not.

1811
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:21,642
So I believe that,
but that is amazing

1812
01:32:22,443 --> 01:32:25,546
to hear from a non-believer.

1813
01:32:26,647 --> 01:32:28,149
Um... Thank you.

1814
01:32:28,282 --> 01:32:29,350
Thank you.

1815
01:32:30,317 --> 01:32:32,186
We've been talking
to Dr. James Martin.

1816
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:34,355
He is the author of
the new book,

<i>A Nefarious Plot.</i>

1818
01:32:36,057 --> 01:32:38,826
You can find it wherever
books are sold.

1819
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:40,861
-Thanks, doc.
-Thank you.

1820
01:32:44,999 --> 01:32:47,034
-Great interview, doc.
-Thanks so much.
