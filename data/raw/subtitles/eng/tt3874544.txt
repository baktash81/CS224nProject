  any work?

      (IMITATES CROWD CHEERING) 

871

 So once we find                
 the file on the new puppy...

877
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,960
   Wait. What's a memo?         

878
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,463
  A memo is something you write 
  to give people information.

            No, Templeton.      

882
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,972
              Memos are for     
              important things. 

883
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,641
         A memo can bring       
         people together.       

884
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,377
              A memo can be     
              a call to arms...

   A memo can change the world.

 Wow! When you                  
 explain it like that...        

888
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,855
 it still sounds boring.

     going to take us anywhere. 

902

 You're right. They think       
 we hate each other.            

903

           but still.

 that we're actual brothers.

1956
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:51,405
         Luckily for me         
         and my little brother, 
         it had a happy ending. 

1957
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:55,542
 Is that a true story, Daddy?   

1958
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:57,877
      Well, sweetie,            
      that's how I remember it. 

1959
01:26:57,912 --> 01:26:59,779
              But you know      
              what I found out? 
         What?                  

1960
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:02,349
         There's plenty of love 
         for everyone.

01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,523
  I wanted a horse.
