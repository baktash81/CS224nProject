1
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,191
Show them the courage of Allah!

2
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,430
He says you stole the bread.

3
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,640
It's a lie.

4
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,934
I caught him stealing ours.

5
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,187
Cut off the infidel's hand.

6
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,522
I took it!

7
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,941
That's not true.

8
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,526
They're not interested in truth.

9
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,860
But he's lying!

10
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,821
You're too weak to survive it.

11
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,114
As you wish.

12
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,408
Cut the other's hand off too.

13
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,202
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Robin.

14
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,487
This is English courage.

15
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,256
That's for five years of hell!

16
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,098
Behind you!

17
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,108
Come on, for God's sake!

18
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,654
Take us with you!

19
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,121
You can't save those people!

20
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,374
But you can save me!

21
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,670
Christian!

22
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,881
- Why should I?
- For pity's sake.

23
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,549
Mine is a sentence of death.

24
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,303
- He's a Moor! Don't listen!
- Set me free! I'll show you a way out.

25
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,807
- Why should we?
- If you do not, we are all dead men.

26
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,810
No, Robin, for God's sake!
They're coming!

27
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,235
I'm sorry.

28
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,912
This way!

29
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,672
Thanks. I misjudged you.

30
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,841
You are fast with a sword.

31
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,012
I waited five years for the smell of free air.
That makes a man fast.

32
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,353
It's mortal.

33
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,480
Leave me.

34
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,110
Give this ring to my sister, Marian.

35
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,571
Now swear you'll protect her.

36
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,657
His wound is by the heart.
We cannot save him.

37
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,617
Swear it, Robin!

38
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,829
- I swear it.
- They're coming!

39
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,623
Tell Marian I died a free Englishman.

40
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,763
Come, my friend.
Make his sacrifice an act of honor.

41
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,972
Come!

42
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,503
Why did you cut me free?

43
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,841
Whatever blood is in your veins,
no man deserves to die in there.

44
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,933
Farewell, friend.

45
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,185
Godspeed your way.

46
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,689
Our way lies together
with the speed of Allah.

47
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,483
You saved my life.

48
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,236
I vow to stay with you until I save yours.

49
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,032
But I go to England.
I relieve you of your obligation.

50
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,992
Only Allah can do that.

51
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,371
What if I say no?

52
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,540
You have no choice.

53
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,668
I am Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir.

54
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,878
You may call me Azeem.

55
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,800
Robin of Locksley.

56
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,691
Kindest sir...

57
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,278
it is rumored you fought
in King Richard's Crusade...

58
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,864
with my beloved son Robin.

59
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,743
I fear you have returned home
to desperate times...

60
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,705
when dark forces
plot against our absent King.

61
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,750
I am anxious for word of my son.

62
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,211
Were you present at his capture
near Jerusalem?

63
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,423
Do you know which potentate holds him?

64
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,593
Does he still bear me ill will?

65
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,554
A little news, please, sir.

66
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,932
I would give all I own for his release.

67
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,783
Help me!

68
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,911
You should have waited!

69
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,163
I'm sorry you were disturbed, master.

70
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,290
It's all right. Let him go.

71
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,755
They've taken my Gwen. My daughter!

72
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,964
Who?

73
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,009
Men! On horses. In masks.

74
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,096
We tried to stop them!

75
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,307
My son...is dead!

76
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,114
Master, stay.
There is an evil moon tonight.

77
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,991
Never fear, Duncan. Good will overcome.

78
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,660
Trust in that.

79
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,218
I'm sorry, my lord. I had no choice.

80
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,395
You!

81
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,942
The King shall hear of this!

82
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,068
Join us.

83
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,029
Never.

84
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,323
Join us...

85
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,783
or die.

86
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,040
God and King Richard!

87
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,302
Thank you, Lord.

88
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,142
I'm home!

89
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,311
I'm home!

90
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,358
You are strange, Christian.

91
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,276
But I'm free!

92
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,029
I beg you to free yourself of your vow.

93
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,698
Return with the boat.

94
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,118
I know how it feels to be far
from home and family.

95
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:28,623
Because I love them so much,
I cannot dishonor them.

96
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,628
I thought you'd say that.

97
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,398
No man controls my destiny.

98
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,318
Especially not one who attacks downwind
and stinks of garlic.

99
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,159
Come!

100
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,164
Our fighting days are done.

101
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,584
By nightfall, we'll celebrate with my father.

102
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,923
You understand, of course...

103
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,259
I had to try.

104
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,219
I would have succeeded.

105
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,103
Why must you walk in back of me?

106
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,440
In your country, am I not the infidel?

107
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:40,528
It seems safer to appear as your slave
rather than your equal.

108
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,782
For an infidel you have uncommon clarity
of thinking.

109
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,700
Tell me of yourself.

110
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,286
Your name, Azeem. What does it mean?

111
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,829
Great One.

112
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,208
Really? Did you give yourself this name?

113
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,253
It's a joke!

114
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,551
Azeem the Great One, I am home!

115
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,224
Look!

116
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,477
Mistletoe!

117
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,941
Many a maid has lost her resolve to me
thanks to this!

118
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,904
In my country, we talk to our women.

119
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,074
We do not drug them with plants.

120
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,493
What do you know of women?

121
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,832
Where I come from, Christian...

122
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,211
there are women of such beauty
they can possess a man's mind so...

123
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,964
that he would willingly die for them.

124
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,385
Wait. Is that why you were
to be executed?

125
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,971
Because of a woman?

126
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,393
That's it, isn't it?

127
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,186
That's it!

128
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,067
It is close to sunset.

129
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,486
You painted old dog! Who was she?

130
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,864
The mullah's daughter?

131
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,994
Another man's wife?

132
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,247
What's her name?

133
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,752
Is there no sun in this cursed country?

134
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,504
Which way is east?

135
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,006
- Her name?
- East!

136
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,425
Her name?

137
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,765
Jasmina.

138
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,933
That way.

139
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,102
You are sure?

140
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,938
I'd know blindfolded.
I'm five miles from home.

141
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,112
Was she worth it?

142
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,783
Worth dying for.

143
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,629
You're dog's meat, son!

144
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,680
You're not playing by the rules.

145
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,391
Deer don't climb trees.

146
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,602
Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird.

147
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,022
Shall we teach him to fly?

148
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,941
Cut it down.

149
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,527
Hold!

150
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:14,034
What manner of creature is so fearsome
it takes six men to attack it?

151
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,287
Stand down. It's no affair of yours.

152
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,205
Have we treed the devil?

153
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,665
Let's see.

154
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,961
A small boy, a truly dangerous animal.

155
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,506
This boy killed one of the Sheriff
of Nottingham's deer.

156
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,925
You starve us! We needed the meat.

157
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,888
I advise you to move on.
This is the Sheriff's land.

158
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,139
Wrong.

159
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,558
It's my land and my tree.

160
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,643
Whatever's in it belongs to me.

161
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,401
Might I have the pleasure of your name
before I have you run through?

162
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,154
Robin of Locksley.

163
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,247
Welcome home.

164
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,292
Kill him!

165
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,467
Time to redeem that vow!

166
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,178
Unleash the hounds!

167
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,848
Get off your damn knees!

168
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:43,498
Be so kind as to give me your name
before I run you through.

169
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,460
Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff's cousin.

170
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,715
That bastard poached deer.

171
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,049
Poached?

172
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,927
Isn't it a greater crime to starve a family?

173
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,722
Go on, Locksley.

174
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,307
Go on.

175
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,979
I've seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes.

176
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,565
Get off my land.

177
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,576
Tell Nottingham what happens
when his scum pick on children.

178
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:29,377
You travel 10,000 miles to save my life
then leave me to be butchered!

179
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,213
I fulfill my vows when I choose.

180
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,091
Which does not include prayer times...

181
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,844
or anytime I'm outnumbered six to one!

182
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,596
You whine like a mule.

183
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,724
You are still alive.

184
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,816
Have no fear. Come down.

185
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,699
Is it true? Did you kill a deer?

186
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,410
Hundreds.

187
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,209
You scared him.

188
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,133
Interesting place, this...

189
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,094
England.

190
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,617
The Sheriff's not to be disturbed.

191
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:52,919
Cousin!

192
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:57,048
I trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound value.

193
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:03,471
I met a hooded man today who bade me
warn you not to harm his people.

194
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,473
Who told you to cover up?

195
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,143
His name?

196
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,228
Robin of Locksley.

197
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,231
The prodigal son returns.

198
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,151
He's a whelp! This girl could best him.

199
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,819
Put it there!

200
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:25,827
This "whelp" bested four of my men.

201
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,997
Your men were probably drunk.

202
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,001
Yet you survived, Cousin.

203
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,086
I barely survived.

204
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:41,176
His companion is dark-skinned,
with a marked face of Islam.

205
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,261
He carries a Saracen sword.

206
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,182
I'm sure it would take an army
to match these rogues.

207
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,270
I trust Locksley visited his manor
and found the home fires still burning.

208
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,276
Father?

209
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,614
Father! Anyone here?

210
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:05,533
Duncan!

211
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,702
Father!

212
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,178
No!

213
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:28,056
Who is it?

214
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,641
My father.

215
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,398
Who's there?

216
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,818
Who's there?

217
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:41,820
Master Robin?

218
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,364
Is that you?

219
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:46,408
Duncan?

220
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,035
Praise be! I thought God...

221
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,745
had abandoned us.

222
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,330
Duncan, my father...

223
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,915
It's a miracle!

224
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,501
Why didn't you cut him down?

225
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,212
Are you deaf?

226
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,422
Easy!

227
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,090
Look at him.

228
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,261
I would have done if I could see.

229
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,600
Who did this to you?

230
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,603
Guy. Guy of Gisborne.

231
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,440
The Sheriff and his witch watched.

232
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:20,984
Why?

233
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:24,863
They say the Sheriff captured your father
worshipping the devil.

234
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,450
That he signed a confession
before the Bishop.

235
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,787
That's not possible.

236
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:36,041
Nottingham declared
all Locksley lands forfeit.

237
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,294
Did you believe the charges?

238
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,631
Not even when they took my eyes.

239
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,811
We must go.

240
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,567
He loved you to the end.

241
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,821
He never gave up hope of your return.

242
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,782
I should have been here.

243
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,245
He called the Crusades a foolish quest.

244
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:18,750
He said it was vanity to force others
to our religion.

245
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,753
But you must flee now.

246
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:25,382
Head south to safety.
Gisborne will surely seek revenge.

247
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,092
I hear you, Duncan.

248
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,012
You should go home.

249
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,516
My world is turned upside down here.

250
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,103
I cannot ask you to come with me.

251
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,856
Alone, Christian,
you will only get yourself killed.

252
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,317
Besides...

253
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,071
there is nothing left
for me to go home to.

254
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:56,121
I will not rest until my father is avenged!

255
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:01,793
I swear it...

256
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,629
by my own blood.

257
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,734
Mortianna?

258
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,006
You called, madam?

259
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,039
What do you see?

260
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:27,545
- The son of a dead man.
- Locksley!

261
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,464
Does he affect us?

262
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,925
He precedes the Lionheart.

263
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:37,681
King Richard returns from the Crusades.
It would soften the barons' spines.

264
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,642
- Soon?
- Make haste.

265
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,561
But my plan is still intact?

266
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,316
What's wrong?

267
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,319
I have seen our death.

268
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,532
The painted man! He haunts my dreams.

269
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,327
Adorned with strange foreign markings.

270
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:01,913
Locksley's companion.

271
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,582
Kill him.

272
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,043
Kill them both.

273
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,510
What is this place?

274
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,345
Peter's home.

275
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,432
It's nearly six years since we left together.

276
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,601
We'll find food and shelter here.

277
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,149
No beggars!

278
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,203
Tell the mistress Robin of Locksley's
at her door.

279
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,205
Her ladyship's not here.

280
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,667
Is the child Marian in?

281
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,712
Maybe she is, maybe she isn't.

282
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:57,469
The hospitality here is as warm
as the weather.

283
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,973
- It's a joke.
- Really?

284
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,892
Leave your weapons.

285
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:08,563
Just you!

286
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,205
Wait here.

287
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:27,999
Right here?

288
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,925
A curse on Moors and Saracens!

289
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:42,180
Were it not for their ungodly ways
Master Robin would never have left.

290
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:48,603
What manner of name is "Azeem"?

291
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,939
Irish? Cornish?

292
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,025
Moorish.

293
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,572
Who are you?

294
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,618
Robin of Locksley.

295
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,578
You lie. Robin is dead.

296
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:07,747
Step into the light.

297
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:14,879
Turn around.

298
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,136
Am I to dance next?

299
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:25,682
Who are you?

300
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,392
I am the maid Marian.

301
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,061
Show yourself,
for we knew each other well.

302
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,782
The years have...

303
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,285
been kind.

304
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:46,661
Thank you.

305
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:52,167
We must guard against outlaws
who would kidnap a relative of the King.

306
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,836
You can see I am not one of those.

307
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:56,671
Perhaps.

308
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,841
Now remove yourself from here.

309
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:04,679
I would, but I'm sworn to protect you.

310
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,265
Protect me?

311
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,685
Robin of Locksley was nothing
but a spoiled bully.

312
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:17,150
Besides, as you can see,
we have enough protection.

313
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:18,943
Marian, wait!

314
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:24,866
You are truly courageous
against an unarmed man.

315
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,130
Point me toward danger! I'm ready!

316
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,127
Hello, Marian.

317
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,137
His last thoughts were of you.

318
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,935
Oh, Peter!

319
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:39,399
I'm sorry, Marian.

320
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:41,901
I'm sorry.

321
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,699
How do I know you didn't abandon him
to save yourself?

322
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:51,202
No one feels his loss more than I.

323
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:55,123
Next time I'm in London,
I'll give my mother your condolences.

324
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,795
I would think for your safety
you would join her.

325
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:03,798
I have no interest in life at court.

326
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:06,885
All gossip-mongering and currying favor.

327
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:10,221
But you're alone here.

328
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:12,432
Hardly.

329
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:15,310
These years have left us many in need.

330
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:21,149
While you and my brother played hero,
Nottingham plundered the shire.

331
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,109
You still have your lands.

332
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,073
I give them no excuse to take them.

333
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:33,620
I am the King's cousin. I must look after
these people until his return.

334
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:48,927
My purpose in coming was not to hurt you.

335
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:53,932
I swore to your brother
I would protect you.

336
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,102
You cannot replace my brother.

337
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,690
I don't want to replace him.

338
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:05,443
I return to find my home destroyed
and my father murdered.

339
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:10,365
The only explanations for it
are the ramblings of an old, blind man.

340
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:15,537
All I remember of you is a spoiled bully...

341
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:18,540
who used to burn my hair as a child.

342
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:23,628
Please allow that years of war and prison
may change a man.

343
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:32,470
Whatever happened between you
and your father, you mustn't believe...

344
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:35,056
what they accused him of.

345
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:36,725
I don't.

346
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:49,404
Look!

347
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:17,265
How did your uneducated kind
ever take Jerusalem?

348
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,225
God knows.

349
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:20,560
What is it?

350
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,113
- What is it?
- Nottingham's soldiers.

351
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,282
Here? Is this your protection?

352
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,577
I killed some of the Sheriff's men.

353
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:40,914
I fear I have placed you in danger.

354
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,875
I can take care of myself. Just go!

355
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,960
No, that's my horse!

356
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:47,796
A magnificent animal!

357
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,889
- Go!
- I'm sworn to protect you.

358
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,642
No more boyish gestures.

359
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:02,310
I'm not leaving.

360
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:08,191
Stop them! They're stealing my horses!

361
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:11,277
You're so kind.

362
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,508
Sheltering outlaws?

363
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,093
They're thieves.

364
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,345
Lucky he didn't steal your virtue.

365
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:41,516
A crown to the man
who brings me Locksley's head!

366
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:26,186
Have we lost them?

367
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:28,146
No!

368
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,234
My horse carries two. Yours is lame.
We can't outrun them.

369
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:36,196
Leave me, Master Robin!
I slow your escape.

370
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,491
We'll lose them in the forest.

371
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:41,409
Sherwood Forest is haunted.

372
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,538
We take our chances with the ghosts,
or become ghosts ourselves.

373
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:09,270
Come on!

374
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:11,147
There're only three of them!

375
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,857
It's not the men we fear.

376
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,776
It's the evil spirits.

377
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:16,861
Robin of the Hood!

378
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:19,447
Son of a devil worshipper!

379
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,033
Your father died a coward...

380
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,869
cursing you and squealing
like a stuck pig!

381
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:28,623
You'll bring no justice
to your father by dying.

382
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,657
There are your ghosts.

383
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:05,326
Wind chimes.

384
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,996
A child's toy put to good use.

385
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,916
You scare easily, my painted Moor.

386
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,173
This forest has eyes.

387
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,175
I swear it.

388
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:42,864
In my dreams alone
have I imagined such a place.

389
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:47,035
Then imagine a way to cross it.

390
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:21,152
There's hope!

391
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,744
"There was a rich man from Nottingham
Who tried to cross the river

392
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:33,123
"What a dope
He tripped on a rope

393
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:35,333
"Now look at him shiver!"

394
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,336
Beg for mercy, rich man!

395
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,591
I beg of no man.

396
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:58,273
This is our river, and any man
who wishes to cross must pay a tax.

397
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,276
I will pay no tax.

398
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:05,030
As you can see, I have nothing.

399
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:07,699
Not even my sword.

400
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,075
Bollocks!

401
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,537
Any man who travels with two servants...

402
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:15,915
and claims he's got no money is either...

403
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:17,667
a fool or a liar.

404
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,627
Yeah, he's a liar!

405
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:21,671
Who are you?

406
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,465
John Little...

407
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:26,718
bestman of the woods.

408
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:34,225
Well, bestman, you lead this rabble?

409
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:37,771
Yes, I do, mate.

410
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:42,942
And if you want to travel through
Sherwood Forest, it'll cost you...

411
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,195
that gold medallion.

412
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:51,785
It's sacred to me.

413
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,454
It's sacred to us too, matey.

414
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,374
It will feed us for a month.

415
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,710
You must fight me for it.

416
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,797
Love to, mate.

417
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:11,638
Be careful, Father.

418
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,224
He walloped 12 of the Sheriff's men.

419
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:15,892
Is that so?

420
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,812
Reckon I'll enjoy this.

421
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:23,900
He's your father?

422
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:30,699
Help me!

423
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,768
He's drowning!

424
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,105
Lost something?

425
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:06,693
Thanks for the taxes.

426
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,863
The little rich boy's lost for words!

427
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:13,908
Any great ideas?

428
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,619
Get up! Move faster!

429
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,539
"Move faster". Great idea.

430
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:34,220
We're not through yet.

431
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,056
All right, my old cocker.

432
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,808
You want another good walloping?

433
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:40,435
You'll have it.

434
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:55,325
I've made it past the gate, John Little.

435
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:57,911
Or should I call you "Little John"?

436
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:24,521
Swimming time again, old chum.

437
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:41,871
Where is he? Do you see him?

438
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:56,302
It's a bloody shame!

439
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,972
He was a brave lad!

440
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:09,315
- Do you yield?
- I can't bloody swim!

441
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:13,653
- Do you yield?
- Yes!

442
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,823
Good. Now put your feet down.

443
00:44:22,662 --> 00:44:24,080
I'll be buggered!

444
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:28,710
- The medallion.
- Give me your name first.

445
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:31,338
Robin of Locksley.

446
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,090
Well, Robin of Locksley...

447
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:38,386
You got balls of solid rock. Come on.

448
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:45,852
That's Much, the miller's son,
Harold Brownwell...

449
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:50,440
that stumpy one is David of Doncaster,
but the lads call him "Bull".

450
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:53,610
Because you're short?

451
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:56,863
It's because I'm so long!

452
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:02,827
Save it!

453
00:45:03,036 --> 00:45:04,704
Save it for the ladies.

454
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:07,165
Give him some mead.

455
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,712
I made that myself.

456
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:17,967
Has English hospitality changed so
in six years...

457
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,970
that a friend of mine's not welcome?

458
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:23,139
But he's a savage, sire!

459
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:26,017
That he is.

460
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:30,021
But no more than you or I.

461
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:34,734
And don't call me "sire".

462
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,322
With regret, I must decline.

463
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:42,909
Allah forbids it.

464
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:44,411
Your loss!

465
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:47,163
Why are so many of you in hiding?

466
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,165
We're all outlaws.

467
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,084
Got prices on our heads.

468
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:52,836
Even the lad.

469
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:56,464
He's a blasted Sheriff.
He says we owe him taxes.

470
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:01,428
Your ghost will only keep his men
at bay so long.

471
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:05,015
They've worked so far.
You have a better idea?

472
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:12,605
We can fight back.

473
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,194
Did I crack your noble head?

474
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:21,531
These are all good lads here...

475
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:24,617
with hearts of oak, but they're farmers.

476
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,455
It'd be lambs to the slaughter.

477
00:46:29,205 --> 00:46:31,916
They say the Sheriff was raised by a witch.

478
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:35,378
She knows every man's thoughts.

479
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:37,714
- She flies.
- That's codswallop!

480
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:40,717
The rich son of a devil worshipper...

481
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,053
cares what happens to outlaw peasants?

482
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:45,138
My lord was kind and generous!

483
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:47,724
Who dares believe him capable?

484
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:50,894
My father was no devil worshipper.

485
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,315
I'll have words with any man
who says otherwise.

486
00:46:58,318 --> 00:46:59,611
But he's right.

487
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:03,907
I was a rich man's son.

488
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:08,661
But I killed the Sheriff's men.

489
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,374
So I'm an outlaw like you.

490
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:14,167
You are nothing like us.

491
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,505
That's Will Scarlet.

492
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:21,841
Take no notice. He's full of piss and wind.

493
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:24,803
Come on, drink up.

494
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,847
Stop talking so much rubbish.

495
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,685
This is the best we simple men can expect.

496
00:47:32,268 --> 00:47:33,687
Here we're safe.

497
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:37,190
Here we are kings.

498
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:04,843
Too much mead, friend?

499
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:06,970
Forgive me, I overslept.

500
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:08,972
Rest yourself.

501
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:20,150
What day is it?

502
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,068
Sunday, I think.

503
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:26,573
Do they still give alms
to the poor at mass?

504
00:48:26,656 --> 00:48:27,907
That they do.

505
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:31,494
Now the need for mercy
is greater than ever.

506
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:36,082
We beseech Thy blessing, Lord...

507
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:40,086
on all Your people, but most especially...

508
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:44,424
on our noble Sheriff of Nottingham.

509
00:48:45,508 --> 00:48:49,346
Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect...

510
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:51,473
our glorious city.

511
00:48:52,098 --> 00:48:54,351
Grant him also the strength...

512
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:57,687
to bring to justice the lawless men...

513
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:00,607
who would threaten its safety...

514
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:03,693
and prosperity...and the judgment...

515
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:05,528
to punish them...

516
00:49:06,112 --> 00:49:08,531
in Your name. Amen.

517
00:49:11,868 --> 00:49:13,078
Go in peace.

518
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,219
That's all I have.

519
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:50,490
Alms for a blind man, milady?

520
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:54,411
For one who cannot see your beauty?

521
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:00,583
What are you doing here?

522
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:03,086
Searching my soul.

523
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,673
I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.

524
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,509
You prefer Nottingham's company?

525
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,595
- There's a price on your head.
- How much?

526
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:14,347
One hundred gold pieces.

527
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:15,849
Is that all?

528
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:18,685
I shall have to annoy the Sheriff more.

529
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:20,603
Soon it will be 1,000.

530
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:23,106
For 1,000, I'd turn you in myself.

531
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,859
Nottingham is mounting an army.

532
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:29,863
He has every blacksmith in the county
making swords and armor.

533
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:32,365
- What's his plan?
- I don't know.

534
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:34,868
There's no limit to his ambitions.

535
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,040
- Thank you.
- Quickly. Go!

536
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,209
Do something for me.

537
00:50:43,793 --> 00:50:45,128
Take a bath.

538
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:46,463
A bath?

539
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:09,402
These are my private chambers, my son.

540
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:14,074
I have priests who would hear
your confession.

541
00:51:20,914 --> 00:51:24,334
I see the boy I knew in the man before me.

542
00:51:26,252 --> 00:51:27,796
Welcome home, Robin.

543
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,425
You shine like the sun, milady.

544
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:34,761
You've been meeting with Robin.

545
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:39,265
My cousin tells me the knave deprived you
of some horses.

546
00:51:40,183 --> 00:51:42,477
Yes, a most disagreeable experience.

547
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:45,188
And for inflicting that upon you...

548
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:48,274
I'll hang him from the walls
by his entrails.

549
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:49,693
I'd like to see that.

550
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:54,698
If you'd bring your household within
the city, I could attend to your needs.

551
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:58,785
Thank you, but I prefer to stay
in my family's home for now.

552
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,665
Then perhaps you'd do me the honor...

553
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:08,211
of accepting a token
of my undying devotion to your safety.

554
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:15,635
King Richard will be moved to hear
of your concern for my welfare.

555
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:22,058
I'm afraid the King has many enemies
abroad and at home.

556
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:24,352
I fear for his safe return.

557
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:27,063
Fear not, dear Sheriff. He will return.

558
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:31,484
And when he does, he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects.

559
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:40,243
I asked your father three times
if he worshipped the Dark One.

560
00:52:41,244 --> 00:52:45,248
Because his answer vexed me
so grievously.

561
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:47,667
He said...

562
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:52,422
he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

563
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:04,559
You lie!

564
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:14,819
On your souls, do not shed blood
in the house of God!

565
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:34,589
Locksley!

566
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:37,133
I'll cut your heart out...

567
00:53:37,425 --> 00:53:38,927
with a spoon!

568
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,012
Then it begins.

569
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,495
Close that gate!

570
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:30,770
What are you looking at?

571
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:52,375
Water!

572
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:55,128
- Thank you.
- For the animal.

573
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:59,299
How can I protect you
if I know not where you go?

574
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:02,469
You hardly raise a finger
when you do know...

575
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:04,554
Great One.

576
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:07,140
I prefer to have the choice.

577
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:09,309
You've stolen the Sheriff's horse?

578
00:55:09,392 --> 00:55:12,395
You've stirred up a hornet's nest now!

579
00:55:12,812 --> 00:55:15,398
- Are you afraid?
- Yeah, a little.

580
00:55:15,648 --> 00:55:19,652
So is the Sheriff. And today
I gave him a sting he'll not forget.

581
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:21,988
You fool! You started a war!

582
00:55:22,238 --> 00:55:23,907
We're already at war.

583
00:55:26,993 --> 00:55:27,994
Bread.

584
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:33,500
I say we strike back at the very man
who takes our homes...

585
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,627
and hunts our children.

586
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,213
You planning to join us?

587
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,716
No, to lead you.

588
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:50,016
These are simple people.

589
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:52,268
They are not warriors.

590
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:55,980
Be careful you do not do this
for your own purposes.

591
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:59,859
You forget yourself. I do not ask
for your company or council.

592
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:06,116
Why a spoon, Cousin? Why not an axe?

593
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:10,370
Because it's dull, you twit! It'll hurt more!

594
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:13,707
I want this brigand found.

595
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:16,042
Starve them out!

596
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:19,045
Slaughter their.... No, take their livestock.

597
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:22,465
I want Locksley's own people fighting
to bring his head in.

598
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:25,552
Perhaps we could create a name for him.

599
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:28,471
Something to drive fear into the populace.

600
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:31,558
Maybe "Locksley the Lethal"
or "Wreaking Robin".

601
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:35,729
I want him dead by the full moon,
before the barons come back.

602
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:37,731
Now, sew!

603
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:42,318
And keep the stitches small.

604
00:56:56,082 --> 00:56:57,292
He's not here.

605
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:01,588
Where's your mate, the man called Little?

606
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:04,299
- He died last winter.
- Burn it down!

607
00:57:12,265 --> 00:57:15,393
Leave the sow. Her young
will feed us through winter.

608
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:17,437
You've heard of the Sherwood Bandit?

609
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,272
Robin of the Hood? Yes.

610
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:22,442
Pray he is brought to us before winter.

611
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:30,408
Over here!

612
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:46,675
They burned it! All of it!

613
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:52,806
There!

614
00:57:54,182 --> 00:57:56,518
Look what they've done!

615
00:58:01,314 --> 00:58:03,650
If it's fame you seek, Christian...

616
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:06,194
I think you have it.

617
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:11,658
You brought this misery on us, Locksley.

618
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:13,785
Nottingham is trying to divide us.

619
00:58:13,868 --> 00:58:15,620
We are divided, rich boy.

620
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:18,456
I'm not as blind as that old man.

621
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,543
You're still trying to be lord of the manor.

622
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:24,629
I heard the Sheriff now values your neck...

623
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:26,756
at 500 gold pieces.

624
00:58:28,216 --> 00:58:30,218
I say we take him in.

625
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:36,349
You think the Sheriff will give everything
back after I'm gone?

626
00:58:36,891 --> 00:58:39,310
He'll give us the reward and our pardons.

627
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:40,395
Wrong!

628
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:45,400
He'll stretch your necks one by one.

629
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:48,028
What would you have us do?

630
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:51,448
Fight armored men on horseback
with rocks and bare hands?

631
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:53,908
If needs be.

632
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:58,538
But with the one true weapon
that escapes you.

633
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,207
Courage.

634
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:10,342
Look out!

635
00:59:25,273 --> 00:59:26,608
Thank you, Wulf.

636
00:59:28,109 --> 00:59:29,694
You wish to end this?

637
00:59:30,278 --> 00:59:31,863
You wish to go home?

638
00:59:32,614 --> 00:59:35,575
Then we must stop fighting
amongst ourselves...

639
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:38,745
and face that the price may be dear.

640
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:41,247
I would rather die...

641
00:59:41,664 --> 00:59:43,792
than spend my life in hiding.

642
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:46,378
The Sheriff calls us outlaws.

643
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:49,130
But I say we are free.

644
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:53,468
And one free man defending his home
is more powerful...

645
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:56,012
than ten hired soldiers.

646
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,308
The Crusades taught me that.

647
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,147
I'll make no promises save one:

648
01:00:08,316 --> 01:00:11,653
If you truly believe in your hearts
that you are free...

649
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:14,489
then we can win.

650
01:00:15,323 --> 01:00:16,616
They got armor!

651
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:19,536
They got armor, Bull?

652
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,123
Even this boy can learn
to find the chinks in armor.

653
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:25,166
But we ain't got no food!

654
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:29,379
What do we need that the forest
cannot provide? We have food.

655
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:31,256
Wood for weapons.

656
01:00:32,048 --> 01:00:34,342
We'll find safety in the trees.

657
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,219
What about our kin?

658
01:00:37,345 --> 01:00:39,139
Sheriff took all they got!

659
01:00:42,183 --> 01:00:44,352
Then, by God, we take it back.

660
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:31,292
What's the meaning of this?

661
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:35,255
A woman of your beauty
has no need for such decorations.

662
01:02:36,297 --> 01:02:37,632
How dare you!

663
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:50,520
Please don't take that! Don't take that!

664
01:02:50,812 --> 01:02:52,647
They belong to our Lord.

665
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:55,859
Now they belong to my Lord Sheriff!

666
01:03:09,664 --> 01:03:10,915
Give it back!

667
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:13,752
Good.

668
01:03:14,169 --> 01:03:19,007
Tell the Sheriff for every harm he does
these people I will repay him tenfold.

669
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:30,352
Something vexes thee?

670
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,281
What the devil?

671
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,158
It's a hot day, friend...

672
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:48,119
to burden your horse
with such a heavy purse.

673
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:50,205
The Sheriff will hear of this!

674
01:03:54,584 --> 01:03:56,002
I truly hope so.

675
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:07,806
Buy yourself a new sow.

676
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:09,557
God bless you, Fanny.

677
01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:12,310
And God bless Robin Hood!

678
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:16,815
We reckon he's nicked...

679
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:20,944
three to four million
in the last five months.

680
01:04:21,277 --> 01:04:24,114
Raise the bounty on his head.

681
01:04:24,572 --> 01:04:25,949
25,000 crowns.

682
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:29,244
Begging your pardon, it won't do no good...

683
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:30,995
how much you raise it.

684
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:32,580
Why is that?

685
01:04:32,914 --> 01:04:36,710
Because of the poor.
He gives them what he takes.

686
01:04:38,086 --> 01:04:40,755
Well, sire...they love him.

687
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,552
Just a minute.

688
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:49,097
Robin Hood steals money
from my pocket...

689
01:04:49,305 --> 01:04:51,975
forcing me to hurt the public...

690
01:04:52,308 --> 01:04:54,227
and they love him for it?

691
01:04:55,603 --> 01:04:56,438
Yes.

692
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:03,236
Cancel the food scraps
for lepers and orphans.

693
01:05:03,319 --> 01:05:05,655
No more merciful beheadings.

694
01:05:06,322 --> 01:05:08,450
And call off Christmas!

695
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:11,619
The treasury is empty.

696
01:05:11,953 --> 01:05:14,289
Day and night people plague my door...

697
01:05:14,497 --> 01:05:18,251
whining for tax relief and safe passage
through Sherwood Forest.

698
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,879
"We can't pay thee
what the highwayman's taken".

699
01:05:20,962 --> 01:05:23,131
It's the shortest route to London!

700
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,675
It's the only route to London.

701
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:30,305
Sir Guy's patrols have found nothing, sire?

702
01:05:30,513 --> 01:05:32,640
No camp. Nothing!

703
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:38,688
This hooded viper simply slithers
into the forest.

704
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:41,191
You, my room, 10:30 tonight.

705
01:05:41,483 --> 01:05:43,318
You, 10:45.

706
01:05:43,693 --> 01:05:45,153
And bring a friend.

707
01:05:51,826 --> 01:05:55,497
"What's the pleasure in this life
Laughter, love and drinking

708
01:05:55,747 --> 01:05:59,250
"Good King Richard, bless his soul
Loves his wine and warring

709
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:01,252
"But for us who stay at home

710
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:04,506
"There's only beer and whoring"

711
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,348
How many?

712
01:06:14,015 --> 01:06:15,183
Twenty.

713
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:18,603
How many?

714
01:06:19,854 --> 01:06:21,022
Five.

715
01:06:22,857 --> 01:06:24,275
They can't count.

716
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,486
Why scare them?

717
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:29,447
And they call me a barbarian.

718
01:06:38,623 --> 01:06:39,791
Quiet!

719
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:43,545
It will be difficult to sing
with a sword in your gullet.

720
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,172
Yes, my lord.

721
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:51,261
Shut up and help me move this log!

722
01:06:51,344 --> 01:06:53,221
This is a tree, not a log!

723
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,931
Shut up and help me!

724
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:57,017
I have to meet a girl!

725
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:07,402
Men in front, after me.
The rest stay with the wagon!

726
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:12,407
On to glory!

727
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:28,965
Bastards! Find them!

728
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:16,179
Welcome to Sherwood, Friar!

729
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,712
I'll be buggered!

730
01:08:49,379 --> 01:08:53,049
This treasure had a purpose.
We must find out what.

731
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:10,859
Good morning, my reverend friend.

732
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:15,071
Nottingham soldiers are poor company
to travel with.

733
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:17,240
Tax him!

734
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:23,038
I'm Robin of Locksley.
And my men are thirsty.

735
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:26,708
Robin Hood!

736
01:09:31,713 --> 01:09:34,132
I mistook you for common thieves!

737
01:09:35,216 --> 01:09:37,052
Kindly let me pass, sir.

738
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:41,765
Surely the Lord has the charity
to spare a few barrels for good Christians.

739
01:09:44,392 --> 01:09:46,061
We've much to celebrate.

740
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:50,940
If you wish them to share
in the good Lord's brew...

741
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:52,942
best me for it!

742
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:03,078
Confess, Robin Hood,
that Friar Tuck is a braver...

743
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:06,289
holier and wiser man than thou art!

744
01:10:23,598 --> 01:10:26,267
He giveth and He taketh away.

745
01:10:32,273 --> 01:10:33,525
Do you yield?

746
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:40,156
I'd rather roast in hell.

747
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:02,846
I think the Friar's taken us far enough.

748
01:11:07,475 --> 01:11:10,186
Thank you, Lord, for teaching me humility.

749
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:21,740
Thanks for the beer.

750
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:24,075
Are these not the meek of the earth?

751
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,370
We need an honest man to minister them.

752
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:29,956
What say you?

753
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:37,672
The Lord reveals Himself
in mysterious ways.

754
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:40,925
I accept.

755
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,262
You won't regret it.

756
01:11:44,888 --> 01:11:46,306
Aye, but you may!

757
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:20,590
We were ambushed, Cousin.

758
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:29,933
Spanish steel. Much stronger
than our native blades.

759
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:34,229
Any losses?

760
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:35,897
Some.

761
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:42,112
In truth, all of them.

762
01:12:42,946 --> 01:12:44,280
And the gold?

763
01:12:44,572 --> 01:12:45,573
Taken.

764
01:12:47,283 --> 01:12:48,410
Robin Hood?

765
01:12:49,452 --> 01:12:51,788
They were woodsmen, Cousin.

766
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:56,459
Robin Hood.

767
01:12:58,253 --> 01:12:59,629
I tried.

768
01:13:03,591 --> 01:13:05,093
I tried!

769
01:13:06,261 --> 01:13:07,929
We must be strong.

770
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:11,266
We can't allow an outlaw
to make fools of us.

771
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:14,144
And I can't allow a lieutenant...

772
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,604
to fail me.

773
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:33,955
At least I didn't use a spoon.

774
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,543
It's good steel.

775
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:51,264
Take the left one.

776
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:52,599
Which is left?

777
01:13:55,977 --> 01:13:58,021
- Which you taking?
- What do you mean?

778
01:13:58,104 --> 01:14:00,690
If you take the left one, I take the right.

779
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:02,734
Which one's that?

780
01:14:02,817 --> 01:14:04,319
The one next to....

781
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:07,197
Just grab them.

782
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:09,991
Now?

783
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:15,080
Donation, please.

784
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:17,999
Donation? For what?

785
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:23,963
For passage through Sherwood.

786
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:25,173
Very well.

787
01:14:26,174 --> 01:14:27,550
Come and get it.

788
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:36,226
You stunted shrub!
How dare you attack us!

789
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:38,061
It's me job, milady.

790
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:40,438
Who is your employer?

791
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:41,856
Robin Hood.

792
01:14:46,027 --> 01:14:47,737
I must see him at once.

793
01:14:50,281 --> 01:14:51,950
I'm trying to stop them!

794
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,035
You can't go down there!

795
01:14:57,038 --> 01:14:58,540
He's not expecting you!

796
01:14:58,623 --> 01:15:00,709
My lady's intrusion is tit for tat.

797
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:03,294
- Out of the way, old traps!
- Don't "old traps" me!

798
01:15:03,378 --> 01:15:05,296
You can't go down there!

799
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:14,723
What's there?

800
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:16,307
Cover your eyes.

801
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:30,321
You could've said!

802
01:15:35,243 --> 01:15:36,745
You have visitors!

803
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:42,876
It weren't my fault!

804
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:46,296
- It was Much!
- It weren't me!

805
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:57,265
What are you doing?

806
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,104
Taking a lady's advice.

807
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,233
What happened to your eye?

808
01:16:07,692 --> 01:16:09,861
- We was set upon by ten...
- Twelve!

809
01:16:09,944 --> 01:16:12,489
Fifteen! Large, big lads!

810
01:16:26,503 --> 01:16:28,004
You've been busy.

811
01:16:28,963 --> 01:16:30,674
We have guests!

812
01:16:43,478 --> 01:16:44,646
It works.

813
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:46,856
Kind of.

814
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:49,693
Of course it works.

815
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:55,699
Take your time.

816
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:03,832
Can you do it amidst distraction?

817
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:06,626
Can you make the shot when you must?

818
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:10,797
Show him, Wulf.

819
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:21,349
Can you?

820
01:17:23,893 --> 01:17:25,478
It was a dirty trick.

821
01:17:28,732 --> 01:17:30,483
Is your shirt coming off?

822
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:54,007
Well done!

823
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:59,971
This is grain, which any fool can eat...

824
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:05,143
but for which the Lord intended
a more divine means of consumption.

825
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:09,898
Let us give praise to our Maker
and glory to His bounty...

826
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:11,858
by learning about...

827
01:18:11,983 --> 01:18:13,318
beer!

828
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:22,077
Are you bragging?

829
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,333
This is blood money, Marian.

830
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:32,253
Intended to bribe King Richard's enemies
to unite against him.

831
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:35,173
We intercepted it.

832
01:18:36,758 --> 01:18:37,759
Who would...

833
01:18:37,842 --> 01:18:39,010
Nottingham.

834
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:42,430
Nottingham would not challenge the King.

835
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:44,683
The King's not here to be challenged.

836
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:47,352
While he's away he may lose his country.

837
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:55,026
You thought I was keeping it all.

838
01:18:56,861 --> 01:18:58,029
Didn't you?

839
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:03,368
A contribution to your cause.

840
01:19:03,618 --> 01:19:05,995
- Keep it.
- It will fetch a great price.

841
01:19:06,621 --> 01:19:08,206
It's not dear to me.

842
01:19:08,623 --> 01:19:09,582
It is.

843
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,042
It's not.

844
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:14,462
I'm saying everything wrong.

845
01:19:17,215 --> 01:19:18,216
Cheers.

846
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:26,725
How do I get down?

847
01:19:31,312 --> 01:19:32,564
Wait!

848
01:19:35,483 --> 01:19:37,444
We don't go that way anymore.

849
01:19:37,902 --> 01:19:39,612
I'm happy to hear that.

850
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:40,822
Grab on.

851
01:19:44,492 --> 01:19:46,327
We have a rule here.

852
01:19:46,661 --> 01:19:50,498
Once someone has seen the way
to our camp, that person cannot leave.

853
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:53,084
Too many lives are at stake.

854
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:56,921
That's why Sarah and I were blindfolded.

855
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:02,761
Will you join us for dinner?

856
01:20:03,928 --> 01:20:04,929
Perhaps.

857
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:25,200
Salaam, little one.

858
01:20:25,617 --> 01:20:26,951
Did God paint you?

859
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,870
Did God paint me?

860
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:32,999
For certain.

861
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:34,459
Why?

862
01:20:36,544 --> 01:20:38,046
Because...

863
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,299
Allah loves wondrous variety.

864
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:49,307
How is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman...

865
01:20:50,183 --> 01:20:53,812
has found contentment living rough
with the salt of the earth?

866
01:20:53,895 --> 01:20:57,315
I've seen knights panic
at the first hint of battle.

867
01:20:58,316 --> 01:21:02,987
And I've seen the lowliest unarmed squire
pull a spear from his own body...

868
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:05,240
to defend a dying horse.

869
01:21:06,908 --> 01:21:08,910
Nobility's not a birthright.

870
01:21:10,578 --> 01:21:12,580
It's defined by one's actions.

871
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:17,252
It's interesting to hear you say that.

872
01:21:17,752 --> 01:21:18,920
I didn't.

873
01:21:19,587 --> 01:21:21,006
My father did.

874
01:21:25,593 --> 01:21:28,263
Did the Holy Quest
erase your hatred of him?

875
01:21:28,513 --> 01:21:29,848
I don't know.

876
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:36,271
All I know is that our last words
in this world were spoken in anger.

877
01:21:38,189 --> 01:21:40,442
I was lost after my mother died.

878
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:44,362
My father too. And for a short time
he found comfort...

879
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,656
with another woman.

880
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:48,450
A peasant woman.

881
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:53,705
I felt he betrayed my mother's memory.

882
01:21:53,788 --> 01:21:55,081
He gave her up?

883
01:21:57,375 --> 01:22:00,920
For the love of a 12-year-old boy
who would never forgive him.

884
01:22:09,971 --> 01:22:11,556
Who says I'm content?

885
01:22:11,806 --> 01:22:14,309
I have my plans for the future.

886
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:18,313
A grander scheme than this?

887
01:22:18,563 --> 01:22:19,981
No, a simpler one.

888
01:22:21,649 --> 01:22:23,902
A home...family...

889
01:22:24,903 --> 01:22:25,904
love.

890
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:30,408
Men speak conveniently of love
when it serves their purpose.

891
01:22:30,825 --> 01:22:33,244
When it doesn't, 'tis a burden to them.

892
01:22:33,995 --> 01:22:35,538
Robin of the Hood...

893
01:22:35,663 --> 01:22:37,374
Prince of Thieves...

894
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,585
is he capable of love?

895
01:22:45,256 --> 01:22:46,508
Father!

896
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:52,931
It's Mother, she's dying!

897
01:23:03,942 --> 01:23:05,944
Your baby has not turned.

898
01:23:07,028 --> 01:23:09,781
It cannot be born without help.

899
01:23:11,032 --> 01:23:13,451
He's the devil's seed sent to lead us astray.

900
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:14,869
He'll kill her!

901
01:23:15,036 --> 01:23:17,038
If you do not listen to me...

902
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:20,083
she will die, and the child.

903
01:23:24,045 --> 01:23:25,964
The Friar's done all he can.

904
01:23:27,298 --> 01:23:29,300
I suggest you let the Moor try.

905
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:34,556
So be it.

906
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:36,391
Then be it on your head!

907
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:42,564
Get me a needle, thread, water.

908
01:23:43,064 --> 01:23:44,232
Hurry!

909
01:23:44,482 --> 01:23:46,484
Come with me, John!

910
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:51,406
What will you do?

911
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:55,493
I've seen it many times.

912
01:23:55,994 --> 01:23:57,245
With horses.

913
01:23:59,581 --> 01:24:00,999
With horses?

914
01:24:03,668 --> 01:24:04,878
Bite down.

915
01:24:07,505 --> 01:24:08,840
Help me.

916
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:17,599
It will be all right.

917
01:24:27,192 --> 01:24:30,028
I tell you, John, the barbarian is killing her.

918
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:37,118
Out of the way, boy!

919
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:39,120
Quick, take him.

920
01:24:47,128 --> 01:24:48,630
What is it?

921
01:24:57,305 --> 01:24:59,057
Your son, milady.

922
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:12,570
You truly are a Great One.

923
01:25:15,407 --> 01:25:17,075
My son!

924
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:22,247
Look at the lovely little baby.
Isn't he wonderful?

925
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,676
The Lord has taught me a fine lesson.

926
01:25:34,759 --> 01:25:37,929
Though I may think I am godly,
I am not worldly.

927
01:25:38,596 --> 01:25:40,598
Please.

928
01:25:45,186 --> 01:25:49,858
My barbarian friend, let's open a barrel
and try to save each other's souls.

929
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:51,860
Alas, I am not permitted.

930
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:54,195
Fine. You talk, I'll drink.

931
01:26:08,543 --> 01:26:10,211
May I have this dance?

932
01:26:10,378 --> 01:26:12,380
This lady is spoken for.

933
01:26:55,256 --> 01:26:56,591
Why this way?

934
01:26:57,759 --> 01:27:01,346
So you cannot return
or be forced to tell others the way.

935
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,686
It was good to see you, Marian.

936
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:10,939
It was good to be seen.

937
01:27:12,774 --> 01:27:14,526
I have two favors to ask.

938
01:27:17,153 --> 01:27:18,154
One.

939
01:27:18,947 --> 01:27:20,365
Take Duncan with you.

940
01:27:20,448 --> 01:27:22,784
I fear for his health.

941
01:27:24,869 --> 01:27:26,913
And I'm tired of his bellyaching.

942
01:27:26,996 --> 01:27:29,124
You wish me to leave?

943
01:27:29,457 --> 01:27:31,209
Old friend, listen to me.

944
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,295
Take Marian safely home.

945
01:27:34,963 --> 01:27:36,840
I fear for her safety.

946
01:27:37,132 --> 01:27:38,842
Of course, sire.

947
01:27:48,476 --> 01:27:49,352
Two?

948
01:27:54,524 --> 01:27:56,484
You're King Richard's cousin.

949
01:27:58,194 --> 01:28:00,864
You can get word to him
of Nottingham's plan.

950
01:28:02,032 --> 01:28:03,616
He would believe you.

951
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:07,203
If the Sheriff found out, I'd lose all I have.

952
01:28:09,998 --> 01:28:11,166
That's true.

953
01:28:13,168 --> 01:28:14,711
Do it for your King.

954
01:28:16,421 --> 01:28:17,255
No.

955
01:28:20,675 --> 01:28:22,177
I'll do it for you.

956
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:44,324
He fancies you, milady.

957
01:28:46,576 --> 01:28:50,080
I am blind, but some things I can still see.

958
01:29:08,598 --> 01:29:11,559
In ten days, the barons are coming.

959
01:29:12,435 --> 01:29:15,647
Robin Hood stole what I was to pay
for their allegiance.

960
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:19,776
I am surrounded by fools
who do not realize my obligations.

961
01:29:21,611 --> 01:29:23,279
Tell me, Mortianna...

962
01:29:24,406 --> 01:29:25,907
am I thwarted?

963
01:29:48,138 --> 01:29:50,974
Recruit the beasts that share our God.

964
01:29:52,726 --> 01:29:53,768
Animals?

965
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:56,187
From the North.

966
01:29:56,312 --> 01:30:00,108
You mean, Celts.
They drink the blood of the dead.

967
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:02,485
Yoke their strength.

968
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:08,116
Hired thugs.

969
01:30:11,828 --> 01:30:13,329
Brilliant!

970
01:30:17,959 --> 01:30:20,295
Put thine own issue on the throne.

971
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:24,007
A child? How?

972
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:25,967
Ally with royal blood.

973
01:30:28,303 --> 01:30:29,304
Who?

974
01:30:44,652 --> 01:30:47,947
It's a personal matter, my lord.
But of vital importance.

975
01:30:48,156 --> 01:30:50,158
I understand, milady.

976
01:30:51,326 --> 01:30:53,703
This is my most trusted emissary.

977
01:30:53,995 --> 01:30:58,375
He must travel to France immediately
and give this personally to the King.

978
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:00,960
My lady-in-waiting will accompany you.

979
01:31:01,044 --> 01:31:04,881
My dear, I could not vouch for her safety.

980
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:07,342
The journey is full of danger.

981
01:31:07,676 --> 01:31:12,347
I appreciate your concern, but Sarah's
a skilled rider and I insist she go.

982
01:31:13,556 --> 01:31:15,350
As you wish.

983
01:31:29,364 --> 01:31:30,699
What's wrong?

984
01:31:30,907 --> 01:31:33,410
My horse is favoring his foreleg.

985
01:31:58,601 --> 01:32:00,437
Duncan, is that you?

986
01:32:04,899 --> 01:32:06,067
Hello?

987
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,115
Rebecca?

988
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:19,622
Nicodemus! Go!

989
01:32:20,248 --> 01:32:21,916
Find mice.

990
01:32:25,628 --> 01:32:28,089
I've never seen a noblewoman's breasts.

991
01:32:40,435 --> 01:32:42,479
We couldn't hold them, milady!

992
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:44,773
Someone wants a word with you.

993
01:33:09,964 --> 01:33:11,299
Easy!

994
01:33:15,845 --> 01:33:18,848
Tonight I need your eyes, old friend.

995
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:07,939
It's the warning arrow!

996
01:34:09,941 --> 01:34:12,277
All is well! It's Duncan!

997
01:34:22,537 --> 01:34:23,788
What happened?

998
01:34:24,122 --> 01:34:26,458
I found you. Thank God, I did it.

999
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:29,794
- Nottingham's men attacked us.
- Marian?

1000
01:34:30,712 --> 01:34:32,213
They took her.

1001
01:34:41,431 --> 01:34:42,599
What is it?

1002
01:34:44,642 --> 01:34:46,311
Over there! Look!

1003
01:34:47,645 --> 01:34:48,813
On the hill!

1004
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,505
Allah, be merciful.

1005
01:35:14,005 --> 01:35:15,340
To the trees!

1006
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:17,759
To the trees!

1007
01:35:18,927 --> 01:35:20,762
They're coming!

1008
01:35:21,096 --> 01:35:23,431
The old fool led them straight to us.

1009
01:35:28,687 --> 01:35:30,438
Get me prisoners.

1010
01:35:43,284 --> 01:35:44,536
Children!

1011
01:35:44,619 --> 01:35:45,745
Come to me!

1012
01:38:01,589 --> 01:38:03,008
My God!

1013
01:38:34,789 --> 01:38:36,458
Save yourselves!

1014
01:38:40,378 --> 01:38:42,964
We better go, Robin! Now!

1015
01:38:59,314 --> 01:39:01,566
This way, my lambs. Come on!

1016
01:39:05,904 --> 01:39:07,197
Hold your fire!

1017
01:39:11,493 --> 01:39:13,745
Gold! Gold! It's gold!

1018
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,834
Fanny!

1019
01:39:27,592 --> 01:39:28,635
Come on!

1020
01:39:57,414 --> 01:39:59,040
Save yourself, John!

1021
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:01,793
No, Fanny, I won't leave you!

1022
01:40:02,711 --> 01:40:03,962
Go on, John.

1023
01:40:20,645 --> 01:40:22,522
- Hold the rope.
- I've got it.

1024
01:40:25,483 --> 01:40:27,068
John, catch her!

1025
01:40:36,578 --> 01:40:38,413
I got you, girl!

1026
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:47,088
Quick!

1027
01:40:56,765 --> 01:40:57,807
Come on!

1028
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:03,688
Go on!

1029
01:41:06,274 --> 01:41:07,734
Don't wait for me!

1030
01:41:08,026 --> 01:41:09,694
John, go on!

1031
01:41:09,944 --> 01:41:11,029
Hurry!

1032
01:41:38,807 --> 01:41:40,308
Corpus Christi.

1033
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:41,976
Amen.

1034
01:42:00,161 --> 01:42:01,621
My Lady Marian.

1035
01:42:03,665 --> 01:42:06,126
By what right do you keep me prisoner?

1036
01:42:07,002 --> 01:42:09,546
You misunderstand my intentions.

1037
01:42:10,171 --> 01:42:13,299
You've been brought here
for your own protection.

1038
01:42:14,634 --> 01:42:16,302
Protection from whom?

1039
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:18,138
From yourself.

1040
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:22,517
It seems you've been consorting
with outlaws.

1041
01:42:25,145 --> 01:42:27,522
Where do you hear such lies?

1042
01:42:28,648 --> 01:42:30,859
By your own hand, milady.

1043
01:42:36,531 --> 01:42:38,491
I'm sorry, my child.

1044
01:42:39,868 --> 01:42:42,328
I feared you were being led astray.

1045
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:46,541
Come.

1046
01:42:56,343 --> 01:42:57,469
It's over.

1047
01:42:58,678 --> 01:43:02,015
Today I return justice to this land.

1048
01:43:03,725 --> 01:43:06,519
I shall hang the ringleaders,
of course, but...

1049
01:43:06,895 --> 01:43:11,733
I'll be generous and give you the lives
of the woodsmen and their families.

1050
01:43:13,068 --> 01:43:14,527
The children.

1051
01:43:15,904 --> 01:43:17,322
And, of course...

1052
01:43:17,572 --> 01:43:20,241
your traitorous lady-in-waiting.

1053
01:43:23,203 --> 01:43:25,205
As a wedding gift.

1054
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:33,254
And just whom am I supposed to marry?

1055
01:43:39,386 --> 01:43:41,888
Search your heart, my child.

1056
01:43:42,764 --> 01:43:45,892
Why not a union
with the House of Nottingham...

1057
01:43:46,226 --> 01:43:48,561
and heal the wounds in our land?

1058
01:43:48,895 --> 01:43:51,898
Only one man can heal the wounds
of this land.

1059
01:43:52,232 --> 01:43:53,400
Robin Hood.

1060
01:44:06,913 --> 01:44:08,665
I'm truly sorry, milady.

1061
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:10,291
He wasted his life.

1062
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:12,752
How many lives would you waste?

1063
01:44:24,472 --> 01:44:26,182
What a beautiful child.

1064
01:44:29,644 --> 01:44:31,312
So young.

1065
01:44:32,105 --> 01:44:36,776
So alive, so unaware
of how precarious life can be.

1066
01:44:44,451 --> 01:44:47,912
I had a very sad childhood.
I'll tell you about it sometime.

1067
01:44:47,996 --> 01:44:51,624
I never knew my parents.
It's amazing I'm sane.

1068
01:45:01,509 --> 01:45:05,180
Our bonding would allow these children
to grow up as my allies.

1069
01:45:06,348 --> 01:45:07,849
You understand...

1070
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:12,312
I cannot allow them to grow up
as my enemies.

1071
01:45:15,315 --> 01:45:17,025
I have no choice.

1072
01:45:19,027 --> 01:45:20,362
That's true.

1073
01:46:00,735 --> 01:46:01,653
Look!

1074
01:46:07,575 --> 01:46:08,743
Christian!

1075
01:46:26,761 --> 01:46:31,057
I have heard that Robin Hood
may still be alive.

1076
01:46:32,517 --> 01:46:35,270
Either tell me where he may be hiding...

1077
01:46:36,312 --> 01:46:40,025
or we'll hang you, catch him anyway,
and do the same to him.

1078
01:46:40,233 --> 01:46:42,193
I'd love to kill him for you.

1079
01:46:46,573 --> 01:46:48,575
So he is alive, then.

1080
01:46:49,617 --> 01:46:51,286
I'm not really sure.

1081
01:46:51,745 --> 01:46:54,080
Then why would I need you?

1082
01:46:55,582 --> 01:46:59,586
Because, my lord, if he is alive
I can get close to him.

1083
01:46:59,794 --> 01:47:02,005
I'm one of his men.
He'd never suspect me.

1084
01:47:02,088 --> 01:47:04,132
- He knows you hate him!
- Shut up!

1085
01:47:06,092 --> 01:47:09,721
He's a trusting fool.
And if he doesn't believe me, he'll kill me...

1086
01:47:09,804 --> 01:47:11,723
then you've lost nothing.

1087
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,769
If you fail...

1088
01:47:17,312 --> 01:47:21,649
I will personally remove
your lying tongue.

1089
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:06,695
My pride brought us to this.

1090
01:48:08,697 --> 01:48:11,199
It's you who gave pride to these people.

1091
01:48:13,868 --> 01:48:15,203
I was a fool.

1092
01:48:17,038 --> 01:48:18,832
A fool to let him leave...

1093
01:48:20,375 --> 01:48:22,877
to believe I planned it so perfectly.

1094
01:48:26,673 --> 01:48:28,258
A wise man once said:

1095
01:48:30,677 --> 01:48:33,221
"There are no perfect men in this world...

1096
01:48:34,556 --> 01:48:36,516
"...only perfect intentions".

1097
01:48:41,896 --> 01:48:44,733
You were an honor
to your countrymen today.

1098
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:50,196
You fought better
than twenty English knights.

1099
01:49:22,228 --> 01:49:24,939
- I thought you were taken.
- I was.

1100
01:49:25,607 --> 01:49:27,025
How'd you escape?

1101
01:49:27,609 --> 01:49:28,651
Traitor!

1102
01:49:29,277 --> 01:49:31,613
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

1103
01:49:31,905 --> 01:49:33,239
Get in there!

1104
01:49:33,448 --> 01:49:36,743
Nobody escapes the Sheriff
unless he's lining his pockets.

1105
01:49:39,621 --> 01:49:41,122
Where's my son?

1106
01:49:43,124 --> 01:49:45,085
I'll have your hide, you toad!

1107
01:49:49,673 --> 01:49:50,799
Bugger me!

1108
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,551
Let him speak.

1109
01:49:56,596 --> 01:49:58,264
I bring a message...

1110
01:49:59,933 --> 01:50:01,434
from Nottingham.

1111
01:50:02,477 --> 01:50:05,438
Our men are to be hung in the square
at high noon tomorrow.

1112
01:50:05,522 --> 01:50:06,690
And my boy?

1113
01:50:07,816 --> 01:50:09,025
The boy too.

1114
01:50:09,317 --> 01:50:10,610
Ten men in all.

1115
01:50:11,945 --> 01:50:14,572
The hangings are part of the celebration...

1116
01:50:14,656 --> 01:50:16,658
for the Sheriff's marriage.

1117
01:50:17,784 --> 01:50:18,785
To whom?

1118
01:50:20,662 --> 01:50:21,871
Lady Marian.

1119
01:50:22,789 --> 01:50:24,457
A bride of royal blood.

1120
01:50:27,293 --> 01:50:29,254
And with King Richard gone...

1121
01:50:29,337 --> 01:50:31,297
he'll be after the throne.

1122
01:50:32,298 --> 01:50:35,802
You were to use this news to get near me,
then kill me, right?

1123
01:50:39,014 --> 01:50:40,765
What are your intentions?

1124
01:50:41,016 --> 01:50:43,184
It depends on you, Locksley.

1125
01:50:44,477 --> 01:50:47,022
I've never trusted you, that's no secret.

1126
01:50:47,856 --> 01:50:50,150
Will you finish what you started?

1127
01:50:50,483 --> 01:50:54,863
Or will he run like the spoiled rich boy
I always took him for?

1128
01:50:57,198 --> 01:51:00,368
Did I wrong you in another life,
Will Scarlet?

1129
01:51:02,037 --> 01:51:04,664
Where does this hatred for me come from?

1130
01:51:17,177 --> 01:51:18,762
From knowing that...

1131
01:51:19,054 --> 01:51:21,014
our father loved you best.

1132
01:51:24,684 --> 01:51:25,935
Our father.

1133
01:51:26,353 --> 01:51:27,896
We are brothers.

1134
01:51:29,064 --> 01:51:33,360
I'm the son of the woman who replaced
your dead mother for a time!

1135
01:51:33,902 --> 01:51:36,279
- Your anger drove them apart!
- It's a lie!

1136
01:51:36,363 --> 01:51:39,407
It's not a lie! You ruined my life!

1137
01:51:52,087 --> 01:51:55,590
I have more reason to hate you
than anyone.

1138
01:51:56,257 --> 01:51:58,718
But I dared to believe in you.

1139
01:52:00,428 --> 01:52:02,347
What I must know, Brother...

1140
01:52:02,555 --> 01:52:06,267
is will you stay with us
and finish what you started?

1141
01:52:11,439 --> 01:52:13,066
I have a brother?

1142
01:52:17,237 --> 01:52:18,738
I have a brother!

1143
01:52:22,909 --> 01:52:25,078
I will make my stand with you.

1144
01:52:25,453 --> 01:52:26,955
Side by side.

1145
01:52:27,914 --> 01:52:29,124
To the end.

1146
01:52:31,918 --> 01:52:33,253
To the end!

1147
01:52:35,797 --> 01:52:37,132
We're all in.

1148
01:52:38,133 --> 01:52:39,634
Daft buggers.

1149
01:52:44,264 --> 01:52:45,640
We finish this.

1150
01:52:48,518 --> 01:52:49,769
What was that?

1151
01:52:50,437 --> 01:52:52,439
Truly, you are a wizard!

1152
01:52:52,647 --> 01:52:55,150
The mystery is in the black powder.

1153
01:52:55,483 --> 01:52:58,236
Surely the Lord will grant us victory.

1154
01:53:01,197 --> 01:53:03,950
You'll be by the gate
to cut off reinforcements.

1155
01:53:04,034 --> 01:53:07,120
John, you sit on this wall
to protect our escape.

1156
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:10,040
I will hide below the scaffold...

1157
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:13,209
to cut our men from their nooses
at the signal.

1158
01:53:13,626 --> 01:53:16,046
No. I'll do that.
You cover us with your bow.

1159
01:53:16,129 --> 01:53:17,714
It's too dangerous.

1160
01:53:18,131 --> 01:53:19,632
So is your aim.

1161
01:53:22,218 --> 01:53:25,555
Whatever Azeem is concocting,
we must each be in place for it.

1162
01:53:25,638 --> 01:53:28,725
Now our success depends on total concert.

1163
01:53:28,975 --> 01:53:31,311
- We may be only six men...
- Seven.

1164
01:53:31,895 --> 01:53:35,732
- What? Where's the little ones?
- Safe with my mother.

1165
01:53:35,982 --> 01:53:38,276
You cracked? You'd get hurt.

1166
01:53:38,485 --> 01:53:41,696
I've had eight babies.
Don't tell me about getting hurt.

1167
01:53:41,821 --> 01:53:44,741
Anyway, I won't just sit
and let one of them die!

1168
01:53:44,991 --> 01:53:47,911
You should be bloody well minding
the other seven.

1169
01:53:48,495 --> 01:53:49,829
Tell her, Rob.

1170
01:53:56,419 --> 01:53:58,338
You will take position here.

1171
01:54:11,935 --> 01:54:15,522
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1172
01:54:15,939 --> 01:54:19,693
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1173
01:54:24,948 --> 01:54:26,616
What have you got there?

1174
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:31,121
The Lord's finest brew
for the good Sheriff's fighting men.

1175
01:54:31,371 --> 01:54:33,540
It has a mighty kick.

1176
01:55:34,726 --> 01:55:35,769
Hey, you!

1177
01:55:37,354 --> 01:55:40,440
- Do I know you?
- Please, sir, don't hurt me.

1178
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:42,442
Oh, my God, you stink.

1179
01:55:42,692 --> 01:55:45,278
Pardon my blindness. I'm always falling...

1180
01:55:49,991 --> 01:55:51,409
Careful, Friar.

1181
01:55:54,162 --> 01:55:55,663
What are you doing?

1182
01:55:55,914 --> 01:56:00,251
Distributing libations for the celebration
of the Sheriff's nuptials.

1183
01:56:00,502 --> 01:56:02,003
Is something amiss?

1184
01:56:02,087 --> 01:56:04,172
You are. Get this out of here!

1185
01:56:04,422 --> 01:56:08,426
Caesar has spoken, my leprous friend.
Let's collect our offerings and depart.

1186
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:10,011
Is this your finger?

1187
01:56:10,261 --> 01:56:12,847
Leper? Get out of here!

1188
01:56:13,098 --> 01:56:16,351
Leaving bits of himself all over England.

1189
01:56:25,276 --> 01:56:26,778
What are you doing?

1190
01:56:26,945 --> 01:56:30,031
I ain't doing no harm.
I likes a good hanging.

1191
01:56:30,198 --> 01:56:32,951
- What's in this bundle?
- That's firewood.

1192
01:56:38,206 --> 01:56:39,582
Hello, my lover.

1193
01:56:46,631 --> 01:56:49,467
Make way for the Lord's work!
No fighting here.

1194
01:56:49,884 --> 01:56:51,886
Make way for the Lord's work!

1195
01:56:52,053 --> 01:56:55,640
A benediction for these poor bastards
who are about to stretch.

1196
01:56:55,807 --> 01:56:57,976
God, receive them in Thy mercy...

1197
01:56:58,226 --> 01:57:01,396
and show them the love
they so richly deserve.

1198
01:57:04,482 --> 01:57:07,318
Hey! Nothing there but trouble, boy.

1199
01:57:27,422 --> 01:57:30,258
That's a little inappropriate,
don't you think?

1200
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,928
No more than your wedding present.

1201
01:57:38,099 --> 01:57:39,392
Bring them out!

1202
01:59:01,391 --> 01:59:02,434
Make way!

1203
01:59:15,447 --> 01:59:16,489
Traitor!

1204
01:59:26,958 --> 01:59:28,335
What's going on?

1205
01:59:30,628 --> 01:59:31,921
Bring him here!

1206
01:59:44,893 --> 01:59:46,561
Oh, the turncoat!

1207
01:59:47,479 --> 01:59:49,064
Did you succeed?

1208
01:59:50,815 --> 01:59:53,068
I found his lair, but...

1209
01:59:54,444 --> 01:59:55,737
he was dead.

1210
01:59:56,738 --> 01:59:58,907
You sure? You saw Hood's body?

1211
02:00:01,242 --> 02:00:02,285
No.

1212
02:00:02,702 --> 02:00:04,037
I saw a grave.

1213
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:07,165
We found this on him.

1214
02:00:11,670 --> 02:00:12,921
String him up.

1215
02:00:18,134 --> 02:00:19,386
Put me down!

1216
02:00:24,391 --> 02:00:25,517
Let me go!

1217
02:00:30,355 --> 02:00:32,774
- Leave him! He's only a boy.
- Shut up!

1218
02:00:34,192 --> 02:00:35,235
Bastard!

1219
02:00:36,736 --> 02:00:37,987
You all right?

1220
02:00:38,071 --> 02:00:38,905
Now?

1221
02:00:56,464 --> 02:00:58,550
It appears there's no more room!

1222
02:00:58,883 --> 02:01:01,094
I'll have to respectfully decline!

1223
02:01:01,177 --> 02:01:02,721
Come on, you. Down.

1224
02:01:08,643 --> 02:01:10,103
Hold your tongue!

1225
02:01:12,397 --> 02:01:15,066
There's always room for one more.

1226
02:01:49,267 --> 02:01:50,769
That's my boy!

1227
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:55,106
My boy!

1228
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:28,264
Locksley!

1229
02:02:28,348 --> 02:02:29,391
Robin!

1230
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:04,509
Get some troops in here!

1231
02:03:14,019 --> 02:03:15,812
What are you waiting for?

1232
02:04:06,988 --> 02:04:07,989
Father!

1233
02:04:12,911 --> 02:04:15,163
Come on, you milksops!

1234
02:04:15,830 --> 02:04:17,332
Fight your way free.

1235
02:04:25,173 --> 02:04:26,883
This way! To the wall!

1236
02:04:27,175 --> 02:04:28,426
Lord Sheriff...

1237
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:31,012
is this your idea of control?

1238
02:04:32,681 --> 02:04:34,849
Shut up, you twit!

1239
02:04:35,266 --> 02:04:36,184
Come!

1240
02:04:44,442 --> 02:04:45,944
English!

1241
02:04:46,403 --> 02:04:48,029
English!

1242
02:04:48,446 --> 02:04:51,783
Behold Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir!

1243
02:04:52,701 --> 02:04:54,703
I am not one of you...

1244
02:04:55,036 --> 02:04:56,705
but I fight!

1245
02:04:56,955 --> 02:04:59,290
I fight with Robin Hood...

1246
02:04:59,833 --> 02:05:01,292
against a tyrant...

1247
02:05:01,376 --> 02:05:03,461
who holds you under his boot!

1248
02:05:03,795 --> 02:05:06,131
If you would be free men...

1249
02:05:06,464 --> 02:05:09,634
then you must fight! Join us now!

1250
02:05:11,636 --> 02:05:13,013
Join Robin Hood!

1251
02:05:13,096 --> 02:05:14,139
Freedom!

1252
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:53,928
Close the gate!

1253
02:05:54,846 --> 02:05:57,015
Guard it with your life!

1254
02:05:57,265 --> 02:05:59,851
Bring the Bishop to my chapel!

1255
02:06:01,603 --> 02:06:02,854
Right there!

1256
02:06:10,612 --> 02:06:12,113
Is she worth it?

1257
02:06:12,781 --> 02:06:14,282
Worth dying for?

1258
02:06:30,382 --> 02:06:32,217
He cleared it!

1259
02:07:05,875 --> 02:07:07,127
We're doomed.

1260
02:07:12,757 --> 02:07:15,051
'Tis rebellion! We must escape!

1261
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,428
Marry us!

1262
02:07:17,429 --> 02:07:19,681
I will never marry you!

1263
02:07:22,267 --> 02:07:24,769
That's my wife, crone!

1264
02:07:26,354 --> 02:07:27,397
Get away!

1265
02:07:27,939 --> 02:07:29,190
She's ripe.

1266
02:07:29,441 --> 02:07:31,860
She'll give us a son. Take her now.

1267
02:07:32,944 --> 02:07:37,699
I will not take her
until we are properly wed!

1268
02:07:38,575 --> 02:07:42,120
For once, I will have something pure!

1269
02:07:43,621 --> 02:07:45,707
'Tis madness to delay.

1270
02:07:47,792 --> 02:07:48,877
Marry them...

1271
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:50,378
or face me!

1272
02:08:12,233 --> 02:08:13,568
Where is she?

1273
02:08:18,323 --> 02:08:19,574
Lady Marian?

1274
02:08:19,657 --> 02:08:21,993
Up the stairs, that way!

1275
02:08:31,670 --> 02:08:33,171
Get on with it!

1276
02:08:38,593 --> 02:08:39,678
Statue!

1277
02:08:41,846 --> 02:08:45,183
"Do you, George, Sheriff of Nottingham...

1278
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:47,852
"...take this woman to be your wife?

1279
02:08:56,111 --> 02:08:57,821
"To have and to hold...

1280
02:08:58,697 --> 02:09:02,033
"...in sickness and in health,
for better or for worse..."

1281
02:09:02,367 --> 02:09:04,160
Yes, yes! Come on!

1282
02:09:04,369 --> 02:09:05,620
Make haste!

1283
02:09:05,704 --> 02:09:09,708
"Do you, Marian, take this man
to be your husband?"

1284
02:09:10,875 --> 02:09:12,585
Yes, of course she does.

1285
02:09:20,218 --> 02:09:21,886
Damned English oak!

1286
02:09:24,055 --> 02:09:25,849
Let's try the other way.

1287
02:09:37,986 --> 02:09:39,404
What do you want?

1288
02:09:44,075 --> 02:09:47,078
I can't do this with all that racket!

1289
02:09:50,665 --> 02:09:51,958
How could you?

1290
02:10:09,851 --> 02:10:11,436
The painted man!

1291
02:10:11,686 --> 02:10:12,771
The witch!

1292
02:10:12,854 --> 02:10:17,275
I didn't know. I didn't know it was you.
Please, sire, have pity.

1293
02:10:17,484 --> 02:10:19,194
Don't harm an old woman.

1294
02:10:38,129 --> 02:10:42,926
You may take this body,
but it will not be me!

1295
02:10:43,802 --> 02:10:44,928
Not again!

1296
02:10:47,055 --> 02:10:50,392
"I pronounce you man and wife,
in the name of the Father...

1297
02:10:50,809 --> 02:10:52,143
"...the Son...

1298
02:10:52,394 --> 02:10:54,104
"...and the Holy Ghost".

1299
02:11:07,575 --> 02:11:09,577
Do you mind, Locksley?

1300
02:11:10,578 --> 02:11:12,414
We've just been married.

1301
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:26,761
Recognize this?

1302
02:11:29,097 --> 02:11:31,599
It belonged to your father.

1303
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:34,352
Appropriate, don't you think...

1304
02:11:34,436 --> 02:11:36,980
that I use it to send you to meet him?

1305
02:11:38,857 --> 02:11:41,276
I shall never fear my father's sword.

1306
02:11:42,777 --> 02:11:43,778
Really?

1307
02:11:47,282 --> 02:11:49,200
Now we're even.

1308
02:12:18,855 --> 02:12:21,483
If I must, I'll take you a piece at a time.

1309
02:12:25,653 --> 02:12:27,655
I'll do the only taking today.

1310
02:12:39,542 --> 02:12:42,837
You sold your soul to Satan, Your Grace.

1311
02:12:44,589 --> 02:12:47,842
You accused innocent men of witchcraft
and let them die.

1312
02:12:49,511 --> 02:12:54,516
Brother Friar, you would not strike
a fellow man of the cloth.

1313
02:12:56,351 --> 02:12:57,686
No, I wouldn't.

1314
02:12:59,354 --> 02:13:01,690
I'll help you pack for your journey.

1315
02:13:01,898 --> 02:13:04,776
You'll need lots of gold to help you
on your way.

1316
02:13:05,235 --> 02:13:06,945
You're a very rich man.

1317
02:13:07,070 --> 02:13:08,154
This too.

1318
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:10,156
And there!

1319
02:13:11,032 --> 02:13:13,326
Here's thirty pieces of silver...

1320
02:13:13,743 --> 02:13:16,746
to pay the devil on your way to hell!

1321
02:14:25,106 --> 02:14:26,816
Get ready.

1322
02:15:57,532 --> 02:15:59,868
I have fulfilled my vow, Sadiq.

1323
02:16:17,927 --> 02:16:19,596
You came for me.

1324
02:16:21,056 --> 02:16:22,599
You're alive.

1325
02:16:23,391 --> 02:16:25,226
I would die for you.

1326
02:16:33,902 --> 02:16:38,573
"By the power vested in me
by God's holy church, I say any man...

1327
02:16:38,782 --> 02:16:41,785
"with reason why these two
shouldn't be joined...

1328
02:16:42,577 --> 02:16:44,287
"let him speak now...

1329
02:16:44,788 --> 02:16:47,082
"or forever hold his peace.

1330
02:16:51,544 --> 02:16:53,505
- "I now pronounce you..."
- Hold!

1331
02:16:53,755 --> 02:16:54,798
I speak!

1332
02:17:05,141 --> 02:17:06,434
Richard!

1333
02:17:17,278 --> 02:17:19,781
I will not allow this wedding to proceed.

1334
02:17:20,115 --> 02:17:21,282
Unless...

1335
02:17:22,617 --> 02:17:24,994
I'm allowed to give the bride away.

1336
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:26,871
You look radiant, Cousin.

1337
02:17:30,291 --> 02:17:32,544
We are deeply honored, Your Majesty.

1338
02:17:32,627 --> 02:17:35,672
It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley.

1339
02:17:36,172 --> 02:17:38,591
Thanks to you, I still have the throne.

1340
02:17:39,718 --> 02:17:40,760
Proceed!

1341
02:17:48,685 --> 02:17:50,770
"Husband and wife".

1342
02:17:52,522 --> 02:17:54,232
You may kiss the bride.

1343
02:17:54,482 --> 02:17:55,817
I know that.

1344
02:18:21,885 --> 02:18:23,511
Get out of it.

1345
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:26,389
We waste good celebration time.
