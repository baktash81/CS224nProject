1
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,350
Alright folks, can we all settle down for a second?

2
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:06,113
Oops! I know that you... hey you settle down

3
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:08,302
On a high point everybody settle down

4
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:13,215
Sandy Gruber..c'mon..now now guys it is not
a time to make silly jokes ...

5
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,422
it's a time for a little bit of talking before
we really get to the important part.

6
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:19,222
Here we go, well it's been another
great year here at JAMS.

7
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:21,855
Who can forget Mr.Pinkus' haunted classroom

8
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:22,899
Thank you Sandy, for that.

9
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:26,094
And I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

10
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:28,379
Or the wild success of

11
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,187
the book drive for women's prison
which Mrs.Pavicic's class sponsored

12
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:38,469
Thank you Beth, but as summer draws upon us,
it's time not only to say goodbye to another school year

13
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,220
but sadly also to say goodbye
to one of our faculty members

14
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:46,623
Yes,..Elizabeth..is Elizabeth Halsey here?
There she is..

15
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:51,557
Elizabeth can you come on up here?
Yes that's appropriate applause, I think.

16
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:57,077
Elizabeth, even though you are
only with us for one short year..

17
00:02:57,207 --> 00:03:02,175
Please know that we will always
consider you part of the JAMS family.

18
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:04,985
And we got you a little something.

19
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,590
Oh! Thank you.

20
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,264
Wow..almost $40, thank you.

21
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,026
You're very welcome, speech?

22
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:19,031
Ok well, I'm really terrible at this types of thing
so, I'll make it quick

23
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,198
Ah, I know i've only been here a year,
but there's so much I will miss.

24
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,174
My students, probably most.

25
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:34,706
And I wish that I had gotten to know
all of you better.

26
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:44,045
But, between four classes and planning a wedding
my plate was full

27
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,710
still, I know that our students are
in good hands.

28
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,769
And even though I'll never teach again professionally.

29
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:58,497
I've realised that I dont need a blackboard or
a classroom to set an example.

30
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:19,201
Adios, bitches!

31
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:31,226
Baby doll..
I'm home.

32
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:32,662
In here..

33
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:36,665
Get yourself hot coz I'm gonna suck
your dick like I'm mad at it

34
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:41,417
Oh! Look, your moms here.
Hi Mom, what a fun surprise.

35
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,768
Suitcases, honey are we going on a trip?

36
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:47,961
Aah..Elizabeth, we need to talk.
- Sure.

37
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:51,472
I'm starting to think that
maybe we need to take a break

38
00:04:51,473 --> 00:04:52,331
Forever...

39
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,912
- Mom! Tell her what the accountant said.
- Mom!

40
00:04:55,998 --> 00:05:00,153
Steven said that you
spend $16,000 last month.

41
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:02,998
He thinks you're bad news
- I know women like you.

42
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:07,796
Damnit Mom! I told you I could handle this
- I just want to ask her something.

43
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:12,808
You truly love my son?
- I love him so much it hurts.

44
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:17,498
Alright then, when is his birthday?
- Mom...

45
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,398
I'm not..you know..that is just
offensive that you would even ask me that

46
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:23,955
It's today..

47
00:05:25,997 --> 00:05:32,016
I know..
That's why I got you this okay

48
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:34,548
honey, happy birthday

49
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:35,590
Austin Market?

50
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,096
Okay fine, I'll sign the prenup.

51
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,179
It's over, Elizabeth.

52
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:42,266
Mark, I'm pregnant.

53
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:43,999
- Bullshit
- No you're not

54
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:46,599
Okay fine, I'm not actually pregnant.

55
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:48,477
You know what, I'm starting to wonder ...

56
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:52,179
whether this is always been about the money.
You never loved me.

57
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:53,780
I dont love you?

58
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:56,438
I have been listening to you
whining about opera for the last year.

59
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:02,497
Okay, If the younger generation doesn't get into opera
then guess what? No more opera!

60
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:04,103
An art form has died

61
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:07,321
If opera goes away, we're fucked.

62
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:09,394
I want my ring back.

63
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:12,013
What am I supposed to do? Huh?
Where am I supposed to go?

64
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:15,363
3 MONTHS LATER

65
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:50,335
There she is, Elizabeth Halsey.
Wooooo...

66
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,806
I am so excited we're gonna be across-the-hall mates.

67
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:58,732
But I'm so sad..it's because
your relationship ended

68
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,483
Who are you again?
- Amy Squirrel.

69
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:05,462
Squirrel?
- Yeah, you know.

70
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:13,778
Don't worry, you were..kind of a long bolf last year
and so... busy planning the ... wedding

71
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:17,492
I found him in bed with somebody else
- Oh my Gosh

72
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:20,958
It was a another man
- shut the front door!

73
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:26,599
Look..I know you kinda skated by last year
doing the bare minimum thing

74
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:32,954
but I just wanna say, now you're back, I just know
you are gonna get your teaching on

75
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,923
I thought the teachers were supposed
to get the apples

76
00:07:39,957 --> 00:07:44,297
well, I think the students teach me
at least as much as I teach them

77
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:49,387
That's just something I say sometimes
- Stupid.

78
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:08,569
Uh sorry..I just wanted to know
if you wanted to grab some lunch

79
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:12,513
I'm kind of in the middle of something, Lynn
- my treat.

80
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,798
You know, Lynn
when I first started teaching

81
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,998
I thought that I was doing it
for all the right reasons

82
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,982
Shorter hours, summers off,
no account credibility...

83
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,416
oh, I love my summers...
fresh corn... mmmm

84
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:28,659
from now on, my full time job is finding
a guy who's gonna take care of me

85
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:30,816
God I pray for that

86
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:33,794
You know I spent my entire summer
hanging out at bars near where the Bulls practice

87
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:38,864
Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs
But those guys are not looking to settle down

88
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:43,800
i mean.. They all wear condoms..then, they take
the condoms with them, that's how paranoid they are

89
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:47,678
like it's so easy to get pregnant from
some dude nutting into a condom

90
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:53,305
yeaa... ugh! You're gonna find someone great
Right?

91
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:59,917
I've been thinking about it a lot, I'm like an 8,
8 and a half..but if I got a new pair of tits.. Right?

92
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:03,110
You!..don't wanna do that,
you're already so pretty

93
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:08,387
You have no idea how difficult it is to
compete against these Barbie doll types

94
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:15,893
yea..that's true, we're not getting any younger
yea..we should finish up

95
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:19,593
Wally's got that big orientation in
the auditorium

96
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,199
Yea, I'm not gonna hear that
- Oh..it's mandatory.

97
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:29,398
I'll probably won't go either.

98
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,998
Huh..no I might, I probably
going to sit in the back, maybe leave early

99
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:40,478
maybe stay the end half..play by ear
or just stay the end.

100
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:46,472
Okay..oh! This was fun, huh?

101
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:55,544
Welcome to Air 7th Grade Social Studies
I'll be your captain, Miss Squirrel.

102
00:09:55,598 --> 00:10:02,298
Crews announce tour for the world geography through
current events, we may have a way over in civics, so buckle up

103
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:06,197
cause it's gonna be a crazy ride

104
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:12,679
The photographer who was like... so nice
he made me feel like really really comfortable

105
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:15,498
I might get flown to Kansas City
for their Fashion Week

106
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:20,220
Kansas City.
- Stalk much?

107
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:23,214
Bhuhhrr!
Loser..

108
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:46,549
Hi, I'm Sasha Abernathy,
My mother baked these cookies for you..

109
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:49,838
Just leave them on the desk..

110
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:56,179
You need something?

111
00:10:57,998 --> 00:11:02,060
Anyone seen Stand and Deliver?
Show hands..

112
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:07,483
..You kidding me?
Edward James Olmos?

113
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:10,623
Lou Diamond Phillips?

114
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:15,727
Well, alright.. You... and you
grab the TV and roll it up front

115
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:19,098
we're watching a movie on the first day?
- I think it's awesome.

116
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:20,454
You rock!

117
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:26,705
These cookies suck

118
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:44,323
incoming..

119
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,252
Elizabeth
Hey,.. Russell

120
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:59,362
Russell Gettis, gym teacher
We did busted together last spring

121
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:03,601
Yea - So, I heard about the whole engagement thing ...
that blows.

122
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:08,422
Know I walked in on him trying to fuck his dog?
Peanut butter everywhere

123
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:11,397
that's gross...
anyway ...

124
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:15,997
hey, uh.. May be too soon, but
you wanna like..grab a bite or something sometime

125
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:18,823
you still a gym teacher?
- I am, yea

126
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:20,416
then No

127
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,886
I dont date coworkers
- I wont tell anyone

128
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:29,524
I also said no..
- Okay cool, well it's been awesome

129
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:33,804
something's got a
case of a sleepyss.

130
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:36,499
What?
- Did you see the colsaw of education?

131
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,997
Yea, one kid ..hit the
other kid with some colsaw..

132
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:44,342
You weren't at the orientation the other day.. Okay!

133
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:48,252
Boy, Elizabeth...
You missed a boat load of stuff

134
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:53,997
anyways, at the orientation I suggested
a new system for supervising lunch

135
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,421
it's a quadrant system

136
00:12:56,517 --> 00:13:00,861
I tell you what... why dont you just
send me memo and if I have any questions, I'll find you

137
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:05,102
Oh! OOh! Yeah
Meant to ask..

138
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:09,668
Did I hear you were showing a movie this
morning on the first day of school?

139
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,740
How do I know what you heard?

140
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:14,527
Listen, I dont wanna tell you
how to run your class but..

141
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,470
Maybe it might be fun to try
some icebreakers..

142
00:13:17,793 --> 00:13:21,626
Like telephone charades,
or this string game..

143
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:26,619
Are we gonna have a problem,
me and you?

144
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:33,898
No,..Eli.. If I gave you that impression
well.... ah!.. I'm so sorry

145
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,426
because ..actually I was really hoping we could be
more than just across the hall mates

146
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:42,298
I don't know what you heard
but I don't need muff pie (vagina)

147
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,225
No, of course not
I don't even know what that is..I..

148
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:53,766
Just meant friends
- tell you what, friend..I've gotta get going, cover me

149
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:58,517
Elizabeth, lunch isn't for
another seven ...minutes...

150
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:00,380
...whos gonna watch your quadrant?

151
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,193
Hi, there.. You look like Losty MC Losterson..

152
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,696
I know right?
Can you tell me where room 107 is?

153
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:19,514
I'll take you there
- Oh. You dont have to do that

154
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:21,296
Oh! Stop it, be my pleasure.

155
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:23,900
Scott Delacorte.
- Elizabeth Halsey.

156
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:26,036
I am the new sub.
- Welcome welcome

157
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,663
Thank you.
- Is that a Jaeger-LeCoultre?

158
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:30,754
Good eye

159
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:33,947
thanks, I love men's watches, it's kind of a hobby

160
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:36,025
you know sometimes I get self-conscious about it but...

161
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:39,298
My grandfather made it, so..
- Oh your grandfather designs watches?

162
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:43,055
The family business, yea my mother's
maiden name is Lecoultre

163
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:49,606
shut up! So did you and your wife just moved to town?
- I'm not married

164
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:53,123
I actually just got out of a relationship.
Catherine

165
00:14:54,138 --> 00:14:57,469
it's been a year, she's still
the wallpaper on my phone

166
00:14:57,913 --> 00:15:02,961
she has such a big heart
- Looks like enormous

167
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:11,169
As you can see the weight is evenly
distributed and there is minimal scar...

168
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:13,883
Dr. Vogel, best hands in Chicago

169
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:18,032
May I?
- Absolutely, take em' for a spin

170
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:26,099
God! Wow! Yea..these are amazing
- Thank you.

171
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:29,771
And the nipples..oh..
- I know

172
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:32,489
I'll take two

173
00:15:36,663 --> 00:15:41,925
the total is $9300 for the surgery,
plus one night stay at our facility

174
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:43,177
How would you like to pay?

175
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:46,728
That's absurd.. I'm a teacher
not a drug dealer

176
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:53,236
We accept all major credit cards
- yeah well.. My credit situation is little.. Complicated

177
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:57,294
I'm sorry, but if you can't pay,
then I can't schedule the appointment

178
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:00,655
I'll be back

179
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,139
I'm rooming with a guy I met on craigslist
all I'm asking you for is 10,000 dollars

180
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,435
you owe me for breaking off the engagement
you know how humiliating that was?

181
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:19,673
Lover... lover look, I dont wanna fight..
It's only $10,000... it would mean the world to me

182
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,341
Lover... are you there?!

183
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:28,313
Fucking troll
- did you call my name?

184
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:33,725
No, I said fucking troll
- Oh, I thought you said Kirk

185
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:39,048
Do you have 10 grand?
- Nope

186
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:44,468
And also I might be a little short on
rent this month, like a lot short

187
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:51,103
This might help. Wanna get wasted?
- Uh..Yea...

188
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,621
Cool, see ya.

189
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:01,428
We are in a state of emergency, and my word is law
There is only one boss in this place, and that's me

190
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,701
The HNIC

191
00:17:06,331 --> 00:17:09,665
Alright..We'll pick this up again tomorrow

192
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,014
Can I help you?

193
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:27,891
What?
- I am the student leader for the trip to Springfield

194
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,083
Shocker!
- We're having our carwash this weekend

195
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,636
If you're around, maybe we could
wash your car.

196
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,141
The Springfield trip is the best part of 7th grade...

197
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,744
...last year's car wash raised 6000 dollars

198
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:44,216
bringing these magazines to school is not the way
you are going to make friends, those 8th Grade boys..

199
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:45,863
Are just using you

200
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:49,434
so I go now?
- Yes, you go now.

201
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:52,082
But if I see these again,
I'm gonna call your parents

202
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:53,691
Do you understand?

203
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,173
Go to class.

204
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:02,932
Hey hey..Hey! Go to class.

205
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:08,882
Another exciting day in the Principal's office

206
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:10,697
Do you have a second?

207
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:16,754
Uhh yeah. Oh! You know what I wanna talk to you too, did I hear
that right, that you were showing movies all last week?

208
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:19,036
Hmm.. Some clips, maybe

209
00:18:19,071 --> 00:18:23,096
But you know in a lot of ways
I think that movies are the new books

210
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:37,126
Is this new?
I love it

211
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:40,893
You know,I've always said that
dolphins are the humans of the sea

212
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:45,383
I have a bumper sticker that says that
- No way?

213
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:48,249
I'm not kidding.
It's on my car.

214
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:51,481
Come on...

215
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,365
Hold on a sec...

216
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:05,106
His name is Simon and he lives
in the Cayman Islands..

217
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:09,642
With his brother, Ajack

218
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:14,898
What a great story.
- What did you wanna talk about?

219
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:17,834
I was thinking that I wanna get more involved

220
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:23,673
You know..I don't know... Something like ...maybe..
Supervising the 7th grade car wash.

221
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:29,223
Uhh..you know Amy has been running after like..
Two years - Yea, but she does so much already.

222
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:31,964
It might be nice to give her a little rest

223
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:36,905
It's so nice to see you becoming a real
member of the JAMS family.

224
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:39,988
It just feels so good to help.

225
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:00,702
Holy shit!
- Alright, let's do this.

226
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:57,450
Hey, Mr. Delacorte, yes!

227
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,440
Hey, kids.
- Hey..

228
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,985
Hey, You better not take it for a joyride

229
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:04,698
- Are you sure?
- I'm watching you.

230
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:08,598
Miss Halsey..I'm impressed.
- Thanks, I've been working out.

231
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:12,882
What a turn out.
- Oh yeah, the kids are just having a blast

232
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,420
Well, that's what it's all about.

233
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,419
God, you know we should go get a drink tonight
I feel like getting drunk

234
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:22,686
I mean not "drunk" drunk, strong buzz
still be able to drive.

235
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:27,775
I'm sorry... I can't get em'.. Just not ready
but if you're patient..

236
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:29,369
I think I might be worth your while

237
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:34,331
- You're worth the wait
- I think so too

238
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:03,287
Wally, it's Amy Squirrel.
- Amy? What are you do...? Get out of here!

239
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:05,090
This will just take a sec...

240
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,683
Umm..I happen to be pedalling past
the 7th Grade car wash this Saturday

241
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:14,316
- Kill it! Can we talk about this later?
- Later we'll all die said the gator to the fly

242
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:18,581
Fuckk! What?
- Just go

243
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:26,397
Now, I don't want to speak out of school
but ..from where I was sitting, I think ...

244
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:32,817
It seemed like Miss Halsey was getting
pretty chummy with the money

245
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,398
Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling
from the 7th grade car wash?

246
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:44,991
Wally..we barely know anything about her
- Hey, you know what they raised almost $7000.

247
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:50,498
So whatever she did, worked. Lee Mathews dad called,
he said the car wash was a raging success.

248
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:54,641
And Lauren Lisman's dad called and he said
we should have car wash every weekend.

249
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:58,541
So instead of accusing her,
you might wanna ask her for some pointers.

250
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:02,757
Well if those pointers include
wearing provocative beach wear..

251
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,863
..For money, I think I'll pass.

252
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:09,798
This is ridiculous, this is the one place in this building
where I'm allowed to be alone with my thoughts

253
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:13,984
I only had this once a day..
If I'm lucky.

254
00:23:13,984 --> 00:23:18,348
Next time you accuse one of my teachers of stealing,
you better have some evidence.

255
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:21,352
God damnit! We are done here.

256
00:23:23,183 --> 00:23:28,083
Alrighty, have a super awesome day, you two.

257
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,482
Holy fuck! I thought she was never gonna leave.

258
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:44,658
What's going on with you?
Need a tissue? Huh?

259
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:49,201
She is such a phony.
- Yeah, major phony

260
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,549
But she also cares a lot too.

261
00:23:56,387 --> 00:24:01,294
I love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles.
- I wanna sit on his face.

262
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:03,148
Hey, guys.
- Heyy.

263
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:07,378
Lynn, will you go grab me some milk?
- What kind of milk do you want?

264
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:10,946
The skim, whole, 2 %, chocolate?

265
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:14,046
Surprise me.
- Okay, I'll get you skim, no 2 %..

266
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:20,831
So...
- Holla, fellow educators..

267
00:24:23,674 --> 00:24:25,811
Is everything okay with Gaby?
- She will be fine.

268
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,807
I told her, Gaby if you're not happy with yourself,
you can't expect others to be happy with you.

269
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,489
It starts with you.
- I'm sure she appreciated that.

270
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:41,840
And it's exactly what I told Elizabeth when she
told me about this upcoming fake breasts job.

271
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:47,451
Sorry... sorry I thought you were telling everyone.

272
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:48,658
Did you?

273
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:51,997
Well I'm prochoice, I believe everyone should choose
whatever makes them happiest..

274
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:54,268
Except abortion, of course.

275
00:24:54,302 --> 00:24:56,250
Of course.
- Of course.

276
00:24:56,729 --> 00:25:00,827
Looks like algebra is calling.
I hate math. Wish me luck.

277
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,157
Hi, I'm a math terrortist
with close ties to algebra

278
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:08,850
I have weapons of
maths instruction

279
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:18,972
Here, I'll walk you.
- Man..Everyone is so nice around here.

280
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:22,598
Of course, hey watch my quadrant!

281
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:24,939
Here you go.. 1 %... Surprise!

282
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:30,082
Hi, my name is Elizabeth Halsey.
Any questions?

283
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:33,079
Hi, I'm Sasha's mother.

284
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,179
I am a little concerned at the importance you're
placing on movies.

285
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:40,615
I was just wondering whats your plans
were for the state test?

286
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:44,386
Listen, the school hired me because...
I'm amazing at what I do

287
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,998
I use movies as one of my tools

288
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,763
but I also use a variety of
other multimedia techniques

289
00:25:51,764 --> 00:25:55,927
Listen, I could take you day by day through
my entire syllabus, but that's not just how I do things.

290
00:25:56,308 --> 00:26:00,544
So, that's my spiel, as the Jews say.

291
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:04,537
Please, help yourself to some
delicious snacks and drinks in the back.

292
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,994
Class dismissed.
- Excuse me, Miss Halsey.

293
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:11,466
Hi, I'm Morgan's dad.

294
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:14,747
Morgan.

295
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:19,865
Great kid, so precautious.
- I just wish Morgan's grades were reflected.

296
00:26:19,865 --> 00:26:24,874
If I know Morgan, and I think I do.
Ah!... Morgan will get there.

297
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:28,169
Listen, I'm sure you have full paid
along with a rocking hot body.

298
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:32,804
But if you could just keep an eye on Morgan?
My wife and I would really appreciate it.

299
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:37,260
For supplies and whatever.

300
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:42,516
Supplies?
You're Chase's parents?

301
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:48,019
You know a student like Chase would
benefit so much from some extra attention?

302
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:50,997
So you think we should hire a tutor?

303
00:26:50,998 --> 00:26:54,476
You know I'd be happy to do it myself,
but it's just so hard with a class of 20..

304
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:59,177
25 or 30, whatever.
- To be a teacher?

305
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,810
God, it is so hard on my salary
to have to pay for my own supplies

306
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:05,938
and my fiance, he cheated on me with his sister

307
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:10,800
as your personal tutor, I guarantee
personally that she will get an A.

308
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:14,549
Or your money back

309
00:27:16,223 --> 00:27:18,683
Say no more.

310
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,534
Make it out to cash.

311
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,593
Scott...Scott...Scott

312
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:14,993
Amy, hi.
- Hi, I got you something.

313
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,640
What? You don't have to do that.
- It's nothing, it's my favorite book.

314
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:29,313
Eat, Pray, Love?
This is my favourite book too.

315
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:35,288
What's your favourite part?
- Love.

316
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:52,598
What do you want?
- Is that marijuana?

317
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,797
No, it's medical marijuana.

318
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:56,653
I have a prescription and everything.

319
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:59,998
And I'm not gonna tell you why because,
it's between me and my doctor.

320
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,717
Oh..ok.. Well feel better.

321
00:29:03,718 --> 00:29:04,998
Thanks.

322
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:07,512
My mom and I made some holiday cookies.

323
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:10,794
Those oatmeal rasin again?
- Gingerbread.

324
00:29:13,592 --> 00:29:15,693
Let have it.

325
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:16,936
Watch the bowl

326
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:22,356
Do you have anything to drink?

327
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:26,379
Listen, word to the wise

328
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,998
Stop dressing like you're running for Congress

329
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,837
I don't wanna run for Congress.
I wanna be President.

330
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:35,893
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Keep saying shit like that you're gonna get punched.

331
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:40,421
You really wanna be a President
or is that something your parents want?

332
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:45,331
Look you don't have to decide right now.

333
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:48,997
Then who knows one day you wakeup
you decide you want to be a masseuse.

334
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:50,998
Salary plus tips.

335
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,064
Think about it.

336
00:29:53,065 --> 00:29:56,155
If I think about it,
Will I get extra credit?

337
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:59,525
Hopeless.
Watch your feet.

338
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:19,979
This is indeed a winter wonderland.

339
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:26,220
Wanna get high?
- Yeaaah.

340
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:29,642
Give me a nug..
I'll go smoke it in my car.

341
00:30:29,998 --> 00:30:34,605
Wow..No, I meant
Do you wanna get high with me?

342
00:30:45,128 --> 00:30:47,998
Hey, they don't make songs like this anymore, right?

343
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:50,104
You know that's not actually true Scott?

344
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:55,753
I'm writing a song right now called
855-824-1777.

345
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,830
Extension 777.

346
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:02,101
So you guys having an awesome time?

347
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:05,351
Yes, Oh my God!
I love to dance, I could dance all night.

348
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:07,220
Hey can we go somewhere and talk?

349
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:09,256
I'll totally go for a talk right now

350
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:17,997
What's up?
- Okay..whoo

351
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,762
I do not know how to say this.
I'm a kind of nervous.

352
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:22,653
Feels it's all happening so quickly.

353
00:31:22,653 --> 00:31:26,295
You can tell me anything Scott,
you're one of my best friends

354
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:28,348
I'm crushing on someone

355
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:31,513
I think you're pretty great too
- Thanks. It's Amy.

356
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:35,664
No running in the hall!

357
00:31:36,744 --> 00:31:38,552
Kids.

358
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:40,857
She's been amazing helping me do with my breakup.

359
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,872
Yeah, I don't know her that well I know all the
other teachers really hate her fucking guts ...

360
00:31:43,873 --> 00:31:45,998
But I stay above all that stuff

361
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:49,205
Can I be honest with you?
- Of course.

362
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:53,163
It's nothing personal, but ...

363
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,810
I don't think that you're Amy's type.

364
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,403
Really?
- Yea

365
00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:01,998
She seem so..I don't know... sympathyco.

366
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:05,588
Trust me
She's only using you for your money.

367
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,254
What?

368
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:14,126
Well I feel stupid.
- No, Scott... Scott

369
00:32:14,128 --> 00:32:17,442
Look at me. I'm gonna get my breasts enlarged
in a couple of months..

370
00:32:17,443 --> 00:32:18,995
...and when I recover from my surgery...

371
00:32:18,996 --> 00:32:23,430
...you and I are gonna go out and we are gonna
find awesome people for each other.

372
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,218
That sounds nice.

373
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:27,498
You're out of your mind.

374
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,530
There is no one in the LeBron who'll ever be Jordan.
Nobody will ever be Jordan.. Okay?

375
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:33,788
Ok, Lebron is a better rebounder and passer

376
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:36,715
Will you let me finish?
Can?..Can you let me finish?

377
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:39,819
Call me when Lebron has six championships
- That's the only arguement?

378
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,153
It's the only argument I need, Shawn!

379
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,766
Let's get baked.

380
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:53,266
Goods... we're gonna go get some baked goods

381
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:57,487
You got this?

382
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:02,713
Just try it..try it!
- Just..please stop pressuring her

383
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,988
How does she know she doesn't like it
if she has never tried it before?

384
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:10,279
You know, we should probably be getting back.
- Just fuckin do it.. Weed is awesome.

385
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:23,594
Hold it in. - Just blow it out
Hold it in. - Blow it out

386
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:29,369
Okay..Lynn, I'm gonna take this.

387
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:32,253
I'm gonna go find a hot dog.

388
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:37,997
Well, that's definitely impressive
- Like you can do better?

389
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:41,029
Really? You sure you wanna do this?
- Yea, gym teacher.

390
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:47,513
You understand this's what I do?
- Yea I got it - Like for a living

391
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:02,108
You have no upper body strength.
- Yes, I do..

392
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:04,998
Just not in my arms or my chest.

393
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:08,000
Well I have cat like reflexes accept for it

394
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,332
So, all this is mine, by the way
As far as the eye can see.

395
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:28,796
Really love with what you've done with the place - Ya if you notice
the nets, that's brand new nets I had installed

396
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:30,998
This's original wood.

397
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:33,108
See those championship banners?

398
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:35,998
When I first came to the school, they weren't here.

399
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:39,786
They were over there,
I have moved over there

400
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:48,267
So.. Russell, what has to go wrong in someone's life for
them to end up being a middle school gym teacher?

401
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:53,628
Well ah.. Granted it wasn't the original plan
As a young boy I wanted to be a professor..

402
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:56,174
..Of physical education.

403
00:34:56,675 --> 00:34:58,942
At Harvard, but ...

404
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,767
I don't know... I like it here.

405
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:05,221
What went so wrong in your life
that you ended up educating children?

406
00:35:05,222 --> 00:35:09,562
I don't know. Maybe I was a bad person in another life.

407
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:14,321
We should like.. Go have a drink.. Sometime.. Together.

408
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,331
Like over winter break.

409
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:20,553
Naah.. Got something brewing.
- Can I say something for the record?

410
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:24,263
Fine.
- It's about ...your... ttt

411
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,695
The big fake titties
Are you really gonna do that?

412
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,221
Why would you do that?
Your tits are fine.

413
00:35:31,222 --> 00:35:34,220
I like your tits..
Ask my roommate.

414
00:35:40,998 --> 00:35:43,342
Seriously?

415
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,157
Seriously?

416
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:51,882
Come on.

417
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:54,185
Seriously?

418
00:35:56,168 --> 00:35:59,982
Hey... Why are they closed?
- It's Christmas?

419
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,724
Whatever...
Hey you got a lighter?

420
00:36:02,914 --> 00:36:07,997
Miss Halsey, it's me Garrett from school
- It's Garrett. Having a nice Christmas?

421
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:09,321
Aces..

422
00:36:09,322 --> 00:36:11,905
Ahh! What're you doing rest of day
you gonna see your family?

423
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:16,775
Ahh... Yeah I'm gonna go see some people
We're having like a big..pot luck so..

424
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:22,156
Miss Halsey? Would you like to come
and spend Christmas with us?

425
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:42,220
That we remembered
Have we ever forget.. What is that? Haaha

426
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:47,220
Guys, I'm really sorry I have to eat and run
I gotta head over to the shelters so..

427
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:50,419
Awww..
- The shelter, Ah, that's so inspiring.

428
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,920
Yeah, I really love helping bums.

429
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:55,833
But you'd have to wait for dessert
we have a real treat.

430
00:36:55,834 --> 00:37:00,632
Garrett, why don't you run and get
some of your new poetry.. - I don't want to hear it

431
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:04,416
God..I'm so embarrassed
- Don't be shy, marbles.

432
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,976
This is called the The Chase by Garrett Tiara.

433
00:37:09,164 --> 00:37:14,418
XOXO, my love for you is XOXO.

434
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:17,853
About her smile
that I would walk a mile for.

435
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:22,885
About her personality
that makes me see the best in me.

436
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:30,754
One glance, one dance
because together we can achieve... balance

437
00:37:30,755 --> 00:37:32,382
Thank you.

438
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:38,025
I loved it
and I usually hate poetry.

439
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:41,924
Oh Philip, hate on Christmas?
- Oops..Sorry, Santa.

440
00:37:41,925 --> 00:37:43,747
Sorry, Jesus.

441
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:50,055
Umm..why don't you two give me a hand with dessert?
And we can let these two ..discuss.

442
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,598
Fuck!

443
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:57,794
So, the poem's about that girl?
- Yea, Chase.

444
00:37:58,598 --> 00:38:02,013
I could just talk to her and tell her how I feel

445
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:03,862
I knew she'd understand

446
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:07,868
Listen, that's not gonna happen, buddy

447
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,626
I was that hot girl, hotter... even
and I would never've gone out with you

448
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:15,378
And I'm not saying that to be mean,
I'm saying that to be helpful.

449
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:17,597
What do you know?
You don't even know our names

450
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:21,311
I'll tell you what I know ...a kid who wears
the same gymnastic sweat shirt 3 days a week....

451
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:24,055
...isn't getting laid until he's 29
that's what I know..

452
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:27,895
Sweat shirt was my dad's.
That's all he left me.. When he left me

453
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:30,509
There's a reason... he didn't pack it.

454
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:32,747
Just saying.

455
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:37,528
Welcome to the number one
New Year's Eve Party in the entire world.

456
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:42,630
This is literally the biggest party ...
- Aren't you going out with the other nurses?

457
00:38:42,631 --> 00:38:44,548
I'm not a nurse.

458
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,585
I thought you were a nurse.

459
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:48,361
I am a teacher.

460
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:24,928
Hey
Welcome back.

461
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:29,685
Many of us are going out tonight
to see Period 5 play, Do you wanna come?

462
00:39:29,897 --> 00:39:32,268
Period 5?
- Yeah the teacher band.

463
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,997
I already got shot on the face.

464
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:45,102
So, are you guys coming to the palace tonight?
My band's gonna do few songs...

465
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:50,034
You are in Period 5? - You're looking at the
new rhythm guitarist and backup vocalist.

466
00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:53,314
Should be fun.
- Should be amazing. Lynn you wanna come?

467
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:55,294
Yes..yes

468
00:40:20,455 --> 00:40:24,749
Like you guys..
You should go talk to someone, Lynn.

469
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,998
I'm fine ...here.

470
00:40:26,998 --> 00:40:31,275
Come on Lynn, you need to loosen up and live a little.
When's the last time you had a good dicking?

471
00:40:31,276 --> 00:40:34,575
A good dicking?
- Go talk to those guys over there.

472
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:37,999
With the cowboy hats?
- Yea.

473
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:41,170
Come on.
- You come on...

474
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:44,107
Go talk to them.
- What am I gonna talk about?

475
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,054
It doesn't matter.

476
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:50,490
You go... you start with one of em' and you start talking
to the other one... and then you go back to the first one

477
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:54,783
but still be touching the other one
and then you just choose.. Text book.

478
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,447
Yea, from the world's weirdest text book

479
00:40:57,498 --> 00:41:01,190
Lemme finish my drink.
- Now Lynn! -Second

480
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:02,998
Now..Go!
- I like it here.

481
00:41:02,998 --> 00:41:07,309
It is really fun over here.
- Lynn, get your ass over to those cowboys.

482
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:12,167
Oooo..well..Glad I wore my fun underwear

483
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:22,553
So, call me crazy, but this might be the
best Period 5 show of all time.

484
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:24,998
What are you doing here, anyway?

485
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:27,331
I thought it was poetry slam night.

486
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:31,109
I was gonna get drunk and mock them.
- Sounds fun, actually

487
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:34,782
I'll let you know, next time I go.
- Not that fun.

488
00:41:34,998 --> 00:41:39,109
Okay..just so you know..
That shit does not face me at all

489
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:43,183
I'm like the fuckin Terminator dude.
I'm just gonna keep coming after you.

490
00:41:43,184 --> 00:41:45,065
Just so we're clear.

491
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:46,758
Good luck with that.

492
00:41:47,401 --> 00:41:50,731
Oh Shit!
Check it out.

493
00:41:51,044 --> 00:41:53,961
I'll be damned.

494
00:41:53,962 --> 00:41:56,050
That shit worked!

495
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:58,264
Super fast

496
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:09,205
Wow, thank you guys for coming out
What a turnout, right? Umm...

497
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:16,889
I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank the
guys from Period 5 for letting me join the band and

498
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,750
Also I have an original song

499
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:25,181
It is my first cracket song writing so.. Be kind.

500
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:29,667
And it goes out to someone very special.

501
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:36,841
There was a girl I met sometime ago

502
00:42:36,998 --> 00:42:43,998
Sympatheco
She helped me heal, she helped me grow

503
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:51,251
Sympatheco how do you know and
you know and again you just know

504
00:42:51,622 --> 00:42:53,518
Sympatheco

505
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:03,998
Sympatheco
Exotico

506
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,591
Erotico

507
00:43:06,592 --> 00:43:10,130
You're my narcotic, Ohhh...

508
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:16,784
Ask me how much I feel
I'll say ..a lot-a-co..

509
00:43:17,424 --> 00:43:22,027
We can never in the world be too much...

510
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:25,070
...before I met you...

511
00:43:25,923 --> 00:43:27,397
fuck!

512
00:43:27,398 --> 00:43:31,932
Is it me? I mean there's something wrong with me?
- I don't think so.

513
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:35,174
I mean, sometimes you talk to people and...
- Thank you.

514
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:40,195
Forget him, at least now you can stop
worrying about him and be the best teacher you can be..

515
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:42,602
Who knows.. Maybe you'll win the bonus.

516
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:45,309
What bonus?
- For the state test

517
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:50,605
Which ever teacher has the highest scoring class
gets a bonus. Amy wins every year.

518
00:43:50,606 --> 00:43:53,589
How much?
- $5700.

519
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,137
Son of a bitch... 5700.
Yea..Goddamn it! Lynn.

520
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:00,353
You never tell me anything
- Yea..

521
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:10,579
Come on.
C'mon c'mon c'mon...

522
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:13,860
Let's go, We had a lot to go over.
Everybody sitdown, come on..

523
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,453
Where is the TV? - Now everybody open
your "To kill a mockingbird" to page 1.

524
00:44:21,129 --> 00:44:22,713
Good, now..

525
00:44:22,714 --> 00:44:27,469
Who can tell me why Jem cries when the hole
in the tree is filled with cement?

526
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,987
Because he's a crybaby?

527
00:44:30,225 --> 00:44:31,474
Get out!

528
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:37,550
We're here to learn

529
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:40,393
Anybody else have a problem with that?

530
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:44,047
Good
Now who has the answer to my question?

531
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,095
Nobody's read this book?

532
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:52,105
It's on the syllabus.
- Well..You never asssign it to us.

533
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,905
Well now..
I am

534
00:44:53,906 --> 00:44:56,213
And we have a quiz tomorrow.
- What?!

535
00:44:56,214 --> 00:44:58,251
On the first 100 pages.

536
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,998
You can't do that
I have band and jazz band tonight

537
00:45:04,998 --> 00:45:07,331
We haven't had
homework all year

538
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:08,988
o

539
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:12,372
Things are about to change around here.

540
00:45:12,373 --> 00:45:14,998
Recess is over.

541
00:45:14,998 --> 00:45:17,539
Because bird symbolize freedom?

542
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:19,886
Good.
Good okay..

543
00:45:19,886 --> 00:45:22,673
Is anyone have anything to add
to what that girl just said?

544
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:29,369
So, what are the limitations of having
Scott as the narrator?

545
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:31,880
You, Chapz.

546
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:34,886
Because he ...

547
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:48,048
Don't flinch... seriously..
You and you.. Hold his arms down

548
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:51,836
Next question.

549
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:57,212
Because Atticus is always the voice of
reason and justice?

550
00:45:58,178 --> 00:46:00,590
Correct..here

551
00:46:00,598 --> 00:46:02,901
Nothing in the face

552
00:46:03,398 --> 00:46:06,250
Woooh!
Wait!

553
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:10,243
Miss Halsey.. Really?
Wow!

554
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,075
I never ...
- We're in the middle of a lesson.

555
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:16,720
Twilight, look at me

556
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:19,104
What do we talk about in class?

557
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:23,565
Your weight should be evenly distributed
You have to throw off the back foot

558
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:26,538
Don't throw at her
Throw through her

559
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:28,658
Hit her!
Hit her!

560
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:29,849
Nail her!

561
00:46:31,442 --> 00:46:36,498
This is so funny, cause I love
raisins and he hates rasins.

562
00:46:36,498 --> 00:46:38,628
Ying and Yang.

563
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,331
You guys are so cute.
- So cute?

564
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,220
It's like ..too cute almost

565
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,134
Last week when we went for a drive

566
00:46:46,629 --> 00:46:51,597
We had no idea where we were going,
We left the maps at home ...

567
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:56,735
What! No way..
- It was fine. I have a GPS navy system.

568
00:46:56,798 --> 00:47:01,998
Oh, Thank God.
- And we discovered this new Ethiopian restaurant

569
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:05,602
They finally got their own cuisine
Progress..

570
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:14,563
Your shirt's misbuttoned
Her shirt is misbuttoned

571
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:19,225
Thank you Amy, for pointing that out
- You're so welcome.

572
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:24,220
Gosh! Its been such a mess this week.
You know, Just working myself to the bone

573
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,109
Yeah, it's been quite a change.
- Well I think it's great.

574
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:32,998
I just love people who are so passionate
about what they do.. It's so inspirational

575
00:47:32,998 --> 00:47:37,077
Thanks. Yea you know, some teachers
just sail by doing that bare minimum thing...

576
00:47:37,078 --> 00:47:40,072
I don't know, it's just not me..

577
00:47:40,109 --> 00:47:43,576
It's good to know there's still some
actual educators out there

578
00:47:45,331 --> 00:47:48,208
What else, Sasha?
- I think I've told you everything.

579
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:52,220
Anyone know where Danny Morebox is?
- Any more movies in class?

580
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:57,220
No, we're actually learning. Hey do you know
Animal Farm isn't even really about animals?

581
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,220
Animal Farm?
Sasha, that's not even on the syllabus.

582
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,898
Yeah, I know you're forgetting something.

583
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:09,220
One extra credit on your diagram, want or not?
- I do I want it.

584
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,999
Okay, okay think.
- Let me think.

585
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,998
Well there was... Never mind.
- What?

586
00:48:15,998 --> 00:48:18,876
Well it was okay..It was medicinal.

587
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:25,726
And if she claims it's medicinal,
I would demand to see a prescription.

588
00:48:25,727 --> 00:48:27,513
That's what I would do if I were you, Wally.

589
00:48:27,514 --> 00:48:31,497
Do you have any proof other than what one student
thought she saw?

590
00:48:31,498 --> 00:48:37,150
Well this one student is in line to be editor
of The Daily Musket next year.

591
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:39,717
She's got a lot to loose
going public with this

592
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:44,404
If the Teacher's Union found out that I was administering
a drug test to a teacher with this little proof...

593
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:46,796
They would make my life a living hell, Amy..

594
00:48:46,797 --> 00:48:48,891
So, you're just gonna let her walk free?

595
00:48:50,006 --> 00:48:52,359
That's it!

596
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:58,415
Amy, Stop that
Stop it!

597
00:48:58,416 --> 00:48:59,653
Sorry.

598
00:48:59,654 --> 00:49:01,751
Sorry.
- Sit down.

599
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:09,400
Amy, Do you see this beautiful
little glass dolphin figurine?

600
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:11,014
Mmmm...
Look at it

601
00:49:11,757 --> 00:49:13,383
Yeah.
- Look at it.

602
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:16,601
Looking at it!
- Elizabeth gave this to me.

603
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:20,864
She is a thoughtful young woman
and she is teaching for all the right reasons.

604
00:49:21,023 --> 00:49:26,500
Wally! Can't you see? She is
manipulating you through the use of dolphins?

605
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,256
No, what I see is that you are getting worked up
And what I would hate to see...

606
00:49:31,257 --> 00:49:34,943
....is for you to get overwhelmed...

607
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:37,848
...like you did in 2008

608
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,744
Gotcha! Thanks Wally,
for bringing that up.

609
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:45,552
For I'm all about that.

610
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:50,446
Do not do that with your mouth.

611
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,435
Regular mouth.

612
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:03,442
"Atticus Finch is a good lawyer because
he is a good person...

613
00:50:03,442 --> 00:50:05,344
...who's a lawyer."

614
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:12,208
Stupid point, misspelled.

615
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:16,326
"Stupider"

616
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:19,605
Is this English?

617
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:29,524
Are you fucking kidding me?

618
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:35,716
Pathetic. This is why the Japs are overtaking us.

619
00:50:35,717 --> 00:50:37,441
And believe me I don't mean you.

620
00:50:38,889 --> 00:50:41,223
But, we're working really hard.

621
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:45,318
You're not working hard enough.
I need results.

622
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:47,077
Class dismissed.

623
00:50:55,163 --> 00:50:58,133
OFFICIAL PRACTICE TEST MANUAL

624
00:50:58,134 --> 00:50:59,851
I need that test!

625
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:11,553
Good afternoon, Illinois standard student test
How may I direct your call?

626
00:51:11,553 --> 00:51:15,331
Hi, my name is Marjarie Goodman and
I'm calling from the Chicago Tribune

627
00:51:15,331 --> 00:51:20,927
Who could I speak to regarding the allegations
of racial bias on your standardised tests?

628
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:22,617
Please hold..

629
00:51:32,109 --> 00:51:34,062
Marjarie?

630
00:51:34,331 --> 00:51:36,320
You must be Carl?

631
00:51:36,331 --> 00:51:40,880
Thank you for meeting me on such short notice
- Of course. Sure..

632
00:51:41,115 --> 00:51:44,903
Did you find the boys okay?
Was it a good drive? - Great drive

633
00:51:44,997 --> 00:51:49,998
Listen Carl, I know that you are a very busy man
So, I'm just gonna get right down to it

634
00:51:49,998 --> 00:51:54,998
I've been speaking to various....
ah..black... citizens... who

635
00:51:54,998 --> 00:51:59,220
..alleged that your test are biased
towards white people and orientals.

636
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:04,553
Okay..lemme tell you something right away
A: Orientals tests better ...

637
00:52:04,553 --> 00:52:10,036
B: Every couple of years we get these cockamamy
charges coming in from various parts of the state

638
00:52:10,037 --> 00:52:13,331
Lemme dat daa..
Usually here, the things that they call me

639
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:17,998
Racist, faggotron, faggy Hitler, dick breath ...
Okay..?

640
00:52:17,998 --> 00:52:23,109
But I am not racist. I voted for Obama,
you can quote me on that in your article

641
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:25,018
You know what I think would help..Carl..?

642
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:27,395
For me to see one of
this year's tests

643
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:30,646
Oh! Sure, I can get you one easy
No problem

644
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,267
Great... great!

645
00:52:32,268 --> 00:52:36,998
Umm..The day after the schools administers them,
I will shoot one right over to you.

646
00:52:36,998 --> 00:52:39,682
I was hoping to see it sooner.
I'm on a bit of a deadline.

647
00:52:39,683 --> 00:52:45,403
No, no... that is absolutely classified Unless,
..unless you have one of these bad boys, right here

648
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:50,623
Wow! You know Carl..
Enough business for one night, don't you think?

649
00:52:50,624 --> 00:52:55,310
Oh..oh tell me bout that.. - I think I'm gonna
have another drink before I hit the road

650
00:52:55,875 --> 00:53:00,588
..It's like the freedom and the wind in your hair
obviously the image... you don't wanna...

651
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:04,109
But then there were others like..just..
Like hopeless or scary..so I..count me out

652
00:53:04,175 --> 00:53:07,878
But you seem like such a wild man Carl..

653
00:53:09,508 --> 00:53:12,419
What turns you on Carl?

654
00:53:13,452 --> 00:53:17,844
Eh..Everything.
- You wanna know what turns me on?

655
00:53:17,997 --> 00:53:19,442
Sex in an office.

656
00:53:19,668 --> 00:53:24,543
Getting fucked really hard against a wooden desk

657
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,851
Mine's metal.
- Even better.

658
00:53:29,285 --> 00:53:31,864
And voila.
So..

659
00:53:34,826 --> 00:53:35,997
This is the desk.

660
00:53:37,553 --> 00:53:39,498
Do you have anything to drink?

661
00:53:39,776 --> 00:53:43,684
Uh Uhh! Yes I do!

662
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:46,299
Voila.

663
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,987
White wine in the office? Bad Boy...

664
00:53:49,988 --> 00:53:53,244
Do you have any music Carl?
- I have the Internet radio.

665
00:53:53,515 --> 00:53:56,570
I love Internet radio

666
00:53:57,147 --> 00:53:59,803
You.ve..come to.. The right place.

667
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:01,541
Cause I have that

668
00:54:02,174 --> 00:54:04,942
See, I am not a wiz' at this computer here

669
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:12,437
Umm.. It's relatively new and Grace who is ah..
Works with me on Mondays and Wednesdays and Thursday and...

670
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:18,288
I share her with Greg across the way
Greg across is actually the guy who got me into spinning

671
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:20,379
Oh, there we go.

672
00:54:23,687 --> 00:54:25,998
Shall we toast?

673
00:54:25,998 --> 00:54:28,921
To new friends
And new lovers

674
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:48,384
I'm gonna take off my shoes, is that okay?
- Whatever man. I'm gonna go hit the ladies room.

675
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:52,488
Okay..There's a handicapped one..which is way closer
use the handicapped one, it's way closer

676
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:21,633
I took off my shoes?
- Oh Carl...

677
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,556
I wanna fuck you baaside desk

678
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,206
I wanna fuck you against the desk

679
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:30,149
Carl..I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out

680
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:35,655
Marji..I am going to rock your vagina

681
00:55:37,018 --> 00:55:39,332
Ohh..The wine is good

682
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:51,644
Hello titties..

683
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:54,009
ONE MONTH LATER

684
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:58,109
If anyone has any information
regarding the missing Anne wig...

685
00:55:58,109 --> 00:56:00,998
...please..let me know ASAP

686
00:56:00,998 --> 00:56:04,102
Come on, guys.
There's a wig missing

687
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:10,797
Because if that wig isn't found, you can bet your
bottom dollar the sun will not come out tomorrow.

688
00:56:11,331 --> 00:56:13,220
Back to you, Wally.

689
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:17,553
Ahh..Okay thank you, Amy. I'm sure everybody
wants to get home so I'm gonna be quick

690
00:56:17,553 --> 00:56:20,572
Four scores, seven years ago.

691
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:27,220
That's a ..Goddamn it! Sandy..

692
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:29,605
Sandy's so funny.

693
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:34,998
Huh... I have here
I have here the results of the state exam

694
00:56:34,998 --> 00:56:39,442
And I'm happy to announce that the..
John Adams Middle School, that's us ...

695
00:56:39,442 --> 00:56:42,725
Scored in the top 5 %
of the whole state

696
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:48,220
Nice..
Good job, guys..

697
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,442
And I wanna single out
I wanna single out one of our own

698
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:54,109
Who show that with hard work and dedication ...

699
00:56:54,109 --> 00:56:57,375
One teacher can make a difference.

700
00:56:57,553 --> 00:57:01,775
And this teacher is now
$5700 richer

701
00:57:01,775 --> 00:57:05,513
With the highest scores in Cookcounty
That's the whole county

702
00:57:05,879 --> 00:57:09,733
I want everyone to give a big round of applause

703
00:57:09,734 --> 00:57:11,876
To Elizabeth Halsey.

704
00:57:17,306 --> 00:57:20,437
Well done
- Thank you.

705
00:57:23,998 --> 00:57:26,677
Congratulations, Miss. Halsey.

706
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:28,623
Thanks dude.

707
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:34,231
Well if it isn't Professor Smarty pants?
- Don't mess with me, I'm a lot stronger than I look.

708
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:39,659
Elizabeth, I am so proud of you.

709
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:45,949
I mean if someone told me at the beginning of the year
that you..'you'... will get the bonus ...

710
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:51,998
Won't have had to say to whomever
it was "No way".."Absolutely not" and..

711
00:57:51,998 --> 00:57:54,998
Now, here we are..

712
00:57:54,998 --> 00:57:57,368
We should go out and celebrate.
Your treat?

713
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:04,170
Yea, unfortunately Elizabeth, Scott and I have to go
over the itenerary for the Springfield trip

714
00:58:04,221 --> 00:58:07,636
We're the chaperones
we're going together.

715
00:58:07,687 --> 00:58:10,817
We're dating..so..
It'll also be romantic.

716
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:16,211
Have fun.
- Yea, You're not seeing anyone now, right?

717
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:21,346
Almost... done..

718
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:25,997
Okay..so that's endorsed
And put the rest on these

719
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:27,997
Just put it
- Alrighty

720
00:58:28,698 --> 00:58:31,304
Okay.

721
00:58:32,886 --> 00:58:34,518
"Ms. Squirrel says reading is fun"

722
00:58:52,501 --> 00:58:54,998
"Learning is Fun-tastic"

723
00:59:02,261 --> 00:59:04,453
Who did this?

724
00:59:04,553 --> 00:59:10,702
Aww... Come on.
Anyone wants extra sticker on their wall star board?

725
00:59:10,702 --> 00:59:15,389
What brings you here?
Mr. Apple.

726
00:59:18,479 --> 00:59:21,500
What was that, Mr. Apple?

727
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,916
You want me to take a bite?

728
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:27,724
Alrighty roo..

729
00:59:30,998 --> 00:59:34,442
Elizabeth, I just want to thank you again
for stepping in today, you really saved us here

730
00:59:34,442 --> 00:59:37,654
No problem.
Is Amy gonna be okay?

731
00:59:37,655 --> 00:59:41,805
Yea, Amy's gonna be fine
- Well, let her know she's in my prayers

732
00:59:48,316 --> 00:59:51,555
Someone's calling my name.

733
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:55,898
I dare you.
- I'm not afraid of your dare, Fabrigo

734
00:59:59,827 --> 01:00:02,053
That's really dangerous, Russell

735
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:05,220
I'll call you from the hotel.
- Bye, Amy.

736
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:08,552
Yea, she's sitting right next to me
- No

737
01:00:08,553 --> 01:00:11,435
Thanks for calling again

738
01:00:12,262 --> 01:00:16,336
Amy says "hi"
- Well she sure calls a lot

739
01:00:16,337 --> 01:00:19,483
So, are you excited about your surgery?

740
01:00:19,553 --> 01:00:22,003
I've never been more excited
about anything

741
01:00:22,003 --> 01:00:25,053
It's a pretty inspiring message
to the kids

742
01:00:25,075 --> 01:00:27,998
We should never stop working on ourselves.

743
01:00:27,998 --> 01:00:33,265
Like you, with your little boobs
or me experimenting with ethnic food.

744
01:01:13,093 --> 01:01:15,813
Gosh!
I never loose my keys.

745
01:01:16,992 --> 01:01:20,109
Such a dingaling

746
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:23,327
What's wrong with your face?
- What is wrong with your face?

747
01:01:23,362 --> 01:01:26,073
Hey..I'm
Just trying to make conversation.

748
01:01:26,074 --> 01:01:30,075
We're all done
- Super, thanks a bunchames

749
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:41,216
I knew it.

750
01:01:51,228 --> 01:01:56,669
Well that is definitely Marjarie, only with kind of
weird hair here in real life she's actually very pretty.

751
01:01:56,846 --> 01:02:02,685
She in some kind of trouble? - Marjarie? I think
you're the one who might be in some kind of trouble.

752
01:02:02,897 --> 01:02:06,870
Did you or did you not give her
a copy of the state test?

753
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:11,982
No, no... no
absolutely not, no I..

754
01:02:11,983 --> 01:02:15,447
I did give her some quotes for her article

755
01:02:15,447 --> 01:02:20,122
What article? - Her..article for the Tribune.
She's a reporter there, right?

756
01:02:22,998 --> 01:02:26,109
Test tampering?
At JAMS?

757
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:29,810
This time I have a witness and
like I said Wally, she stole the Anne wig

758
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:32,998
We're dealing with
a criminal mastermind

759
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:36,159
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news Wall..

760
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:39,880
You know.. How much we all love her.

761
01:02:40,618 --> 01:02:43,240
Okay, well ..You know
I have to call the superintendent

762
01:02:43,241 --> 01:02:46,998
We're gonna have to cross check
her entire class's scores

763
01:02:46,998 --> 01:02:49,193
This is a real shit sandwich!

764
01:02:49,863 --> 01:02:52,059
Course, you know what scares me the most, Wall?

765
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,066
This is just what we know, right?

766
01:02:54,678 --> 01:02:58,241
Who knows what else she's capable of?

767
01:03:00,702 --> 01:03:02,499
So aweful

768
01:03:10,047 --> 01:03:11,704
Fruit Roll-Up?

769
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:14,019
You know, when President Lincoln
abolish slavery ...

770
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:17,577
It was not a popular opinion

771
01:03:17,609 --> 01:03:21,561
- Hmmm
- I just hate slavery so so much.

772
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:24,231
Slavery's the worst

773
01:03:24,232 --> 01:03:27,888
If I could go back in time
and undo slavery? I would.

774
01:03:28,997 --> 01:03:30,655
I hate it.

775
01:03:30,656 --> 01:03:31,731
I hate it.

776
01:03:31,732 --> 01:03:36,904
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt you guys, but...
I couldn't help it over hear your conversations

777
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:38,657
Can I tell you guys what I hate?

778
01:03:38,658 --> 01:03:43,749
Sharks.
- Well sharks can tear families apart.

779
01:03:44,244 --> 01:03:47,346
But they're also so majestic.
- They are beautiful creatures.

780
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,718
But they're also so ferocious
- So ferocious

781
01:03:50,935 --> 01:03:54,481
One of nature's
cruel jokes I guess..

782
01:03:58,622 --> 01:04:01,169
Thank you, Elizabeth, for listening.

783
01:04:01,745 --> 01:04:05,659
Scott, I want you to know
You can talk to me about anything.

784
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,367
Your jeans feels so good
against my jeans.

785
01:04:29,478 --> 01:04:33,786
Totally
- Hey, your body feels so good.

786
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:36,300
Oh, I need some water.

787
01:04:57,042 --> 01:05:01,934
Oh I'm dryin' the shit out of you
- Oh Dry Fuck the fuck outta me, Scott.

788
01:05:01,988 --> 01:05:05,751
Just stop talking.

789
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:10,538
I'm close.
Don't move.

790
01:05:11,109 --> 01:05:15,220
Here I go. ..Almost.

791
01:05:15,324 --> 01:05:16,473
Wait for it.

792
01:05:18,474 --> 01:05:21,914
Really close.. Ready?
- Mmmm..Yea.

793
01:05:21,915 --> 01:05:23,151
Just stop talking

794
01:05:25,868 --> 01:05:29,585
Almost there.

795
01:05:36,921 --> 01:05:40,008
That was great
- More like amazing

796
01:05:40,511 --> 01:05:46,198
Well, I'm gonna get going
I don't want the kids to see me leaving your room - Yea

797
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:52,347
You're so symphatico.

798
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:56,453
Maybe next time
we can dry hump without our clothes on.

799
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:59,947
I'm pretty sure I'd like that

800
01:06:07,407 --> 01:06:09,907
Even your forehead is sexy.

801
01:06:11,229 --> 01:06:13,626
Oh, time for bed

802
01:06:14,272 --> 01:06:18,086
All right then
- See you in the mañana

803
01:06:19,162 --> 01:06:23,859
Elizabeth, don't let the bed bugs bite

804
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:37,527
I was just going over some stuff for tomorrow.

805
01:06:37,665 --> 01:06:39,755
Yeah, cool..

806
01:06:40,442 --> 01:06:43,405
I'm serious.
- Okay

807
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:46,633
Cheers.

808
01:06:48,746 --> 01:06:53,322
They forgot to re-stuffed my minibar.
How's yours lookin'?

809
01:06:53,418 --> 01:06:57,650
You know, I'm super tired
I'm just getin' in the sack

810
01:06:57,819 --> 01:07:02,221
I'll see you tomorrow then
- Good night

811
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:07,785
And 17.

812
01:07:07,868 --> 01:07:15,338
Oh, hold on. Shelly ...Ooo
Shelly, someone's got a message.

813
01:07:16,885 --> 01:07:22,473
Ah! Dry humpin' the shit out of you
- Yeah, Dry Fuck the fuck outta me, Scott.

814
01:07:24,228 --> 01:07:27,581
I wasn't always president.
Oh! No!

815
01:07:27,582 --> 01:07:32,098
I had many jobs when I
lived here in New Salem

816
01:07:32,098 --> 01:07:36,555
My fave..My favorite job was,
'Splitting rails'.

817
01:07:36,555 --> 01:07:40,397
Which is why they call me 'rail splitter'.

818
01:07:41,547 --> 01:07:44,643
Anybody know... anybody know
any of my other nick names?

819
01:07:44,702 --> 01:07:49,527
"Honest Abe".
- Yes, obviously. Honest Abe.

820
01:07:49,527 --> 01:07:51,772
That was the big one
Honest Abe

821
01:07:51,805 --> 01:07:55,199
They always called me that because
I said what was on my mind

822
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,170
Even if it made me unpopular.

823
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:05,246
Remember, a great man always has the courage
to say what is in his heart.

824
01:08:05,747 --> 01:08:07,544
Yea?

825
01:08:08,899 --> 01:08:15,393
I love Chase Rubin Rossy
- Great.

826
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:18,688
Who would like to see Mary Tod churn butter?
Churn butter?

827
01:08:18,784 --> 01:08:22,632
I love you, Chase.
I wanna yell it from the mountain tops.

828
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:28,440
And even though you pretty much stop talking
to me in fifth grade... I don't care

829
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:31,336
I remember the Chase
that wrote me a card

830
01:08:31,336 --> 01:08:34,684
When my dad was overweight and
had to go to the hospital because of his heart

831
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:38,668
And a year later, when he left my
mom and moved in with his trainer ...

832
01:08:38,669 --> 01:08:40,693
You wrote me another card.

833
01:08:40,751 --> 01:08:42,875
What happened to us?

834
01:08:42,876 --> 01:08:47,025
Remember, in the second grade when we
had a sleep over and you wet the bed?

835
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:51,370
And you were so embarassed, and you made me
promise never to tell anyone?

836
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:55,586
Well, I never have
and I never will

837
01:08:55,657 --> 01:08:59,460
So there it is
My heart honestly

838
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:02,080
Don't let me leave
- Oh! Please don't

839
01:09:02,426 --> 01:09:06,049
Always
believe

840
01:09:06,724 --> 01:09:08,934
Gross..

841
01:09:08,967 --> 01:09:12,119
Buuhhr!
Loser.

842
01:09:13,078 --> 01:09:14,438
Guys, c'mon
settle down

843
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:18,425
Okay..Let's see how Mary Tod's
doing with that butter

844
01:09:18,498 --> 01:09:21,553
Okay..That's enough.
We get it, you're crying

845
01:09:21,553 --> 01:09:23,401
She just laughed at me
and called me 'gross'

846
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:27,860
Yeah! Did you hear your speech? Come on lets go back.
- No

847
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:29,603
No, I'm not going back.
- Come on.

848
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:32,455
Just leave me alone.

849
01:09:37,305 --> 01:09:39,796
Get your ass back here

850
01:09:48,027 --> 01:09:49,998
We done running?

851
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:54,858
Ah? Everything okay in here?
- It's okay, I'm his teacher.

852
01:09:54,955 --> 01:09:56,971
Oh Okay
Take your time.

853
01:09:57,453 --> 01:09:59,443
She's never gonna like me, is she?

854
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:02,438
Are we still on this?
- She's my everything

855
01:10:04,404 --> 01:10:11,112
Here is the deal man..I cannot keep sugar coating this
for you. This girl is never gonna be interested in you.

856
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:18,009
Never. You clearly have a... rich
interior life with the poems and the whatever but..

857
01:10:18,105 --> 01:10:23,104
She wants a guy like Ian.. What's his face?
- Ian Mentelbaum? The rapper?

858
01:10:23,188 --> 01:10:26,024
He's an idiot.
- Yea, he's a fuckin' moron.

859
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,661
But she doesn't care

860
01:10:27,662 --> 01:10:30,154
She's superficial and
her priorities are all fucked up

861
01:10:32,825 --> 01:10:36,690
She likes him because he's
hot and popular dude. You...

862
01:10:37,515 --> 01:10:40,437
...are sensitive.
- Yes, thank you

863
01:10:40,472 --> 01:10:42,874
It's not a compliment.

864
01:10:43,393 --> 01:10:45,536
You have some rough road ahead of you

865
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:49,239
Seventh grade is not your moment.
- Yeah, eighth grade will be better.

866
01:10:49,335 --> 01:10:51,997
Probably not.
I think in college

867
01:10:52,211 --> 01:10:55,653
That's your window
be ready.

868
01:10:59,558 --> 01:11:02,338
..If I go back out there
everyone's gonna laugh at me.

869
01:11:10,091 --> 01:11:12,563
Maybe this will help.
- What are you doing?

870
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:16,190
I'm giving you a gift.
Oh wow..

871
01:11:16,608 --> 01:11:19,978
We are gonna change the new cycle

872
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,898
Trust me on this.

873
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:27,194
I thought it would be heavier.

874
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:32,065
Don't be weird, and take this off
never fucking wear it again, what are you, crazy?

875
01:11:36,141 --> 01:11:39,579
Everything okay with Garrett?
- No, it's not

876
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:44,362
I found him hooking up with an eighth-grader
from another school. She was jerking him off

877
01:11:44,459 --> 01:11:49,817
Yea, I'm gonna give him detention when we get back
- That's probably a good idea.

878
01:11:49,919 --> 01:11:52,613
Garrett Portman, I was a kid from
an old boys school.

879
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:56,002
Yea, and he was wearing this
- What?

880
01:11:56,736 --> 01:12:00,468
Awesome
- It's real..

881
01:12:02,623 --> 01:12:07,175
It's a nice thing you did.
- I don't know what you're talking about?

882
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:11,900
Really? Cause I couldn't help but
notice that you're not wearing a bra

883
01:12:11,922 --> 01:12:14,919
And those...
Those kids are there playing with it

884
01:12:15,907 --> 01:12:20,389
Much people don't wear bras.
- Definitely. Much teachers.

885
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:23,998
Well if you must know, I was helping
a student through a tough time

886
01:12:24,143 --> 01:12:26,405
I'm going through such a tough time.

887
01:12:26,502 --> 01:12:30,625
Can I have your panties?
- I'm not wearing any..

888
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:43,146
Amy, what are you doing here?
- Scott, talk to the hand.

889
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:46,585
Amy?
- I know ...

890
01:12:46,652 --> 01:12:49,245
Ev-ery-thing.

891
01:12:49,246 --> 01:12:51,564
Carl Halabi.
The state test.

892
01:12:51,565 --> 01:12:54,319
The blating disregard for the school syllabus

893
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,947
And lets not forget..
The sleeping with my boyfriend

894
01:12:59,244 --> 01:13:01,842
Scott, your phone accidentally
called me last night

895
01:13:02,483 --> 01:13:06,014
I can't believe you
let her take advantage of you like that

896
01:13:06,696 --> 01:13:12,647
You are too trusting
- I am. I didn't know what was happening

897
01:13:12,742 --> 01:13:16,064
I hope you haven't spent that bonus check
on anything because you're about to give it back

898
01:13:16,064 --> 01:13:20,566
And then some...
jail time..Jail time!

899
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:26,994
Did you ever think that maybe ... - Save it doll face
you can explain it all tomorrow to the principal

900
01:13:26,997 --> 01:13:28,141
And the superintendent.

901
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:33,968
When you got your meeting with the principal and
the superintendent tomorrow... At the meeting ...tomorrow

902
01:13:44,392 --> 01:13:48,619
I need you to go to this guy's office
and scare the shit out of him

903
01:13:48,998 --> 01:13:50,696
Tell me my mission again

904
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:55,255
Hand him the envelope.
- I'm gonna need a couple bucks for gas

905
01:13:58,593 --> 01:14:01,599
And a couple bucks for snacks

906
01:14:24,746 --> 01:14:28,044
Oh my God!
Sir?

907
01:14:28,282 --> 01:14:31,056
Oh my God, are you okay?
- I got fucked up my knee.

908
01:14:31,441 --> 01:14:34,354
Easy
Easy does it, easy...

909
01:14:35,414 --> 01:14:38,093
You need an ambulance?
- Ambulance is not necessary.

910
01:14:38,185 --> 01:14:41,548
I walking on - Walking on is number one
worst thing you would probably do

911
01:14:43,943 --> 01:14:45,729
Please don't touch my mirror.

912
01:14:45,827 --> 01:14:50,753
Please sir? What the ff? What the fuck, who does that?
- I'm a friend of Marjorie's

913
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:55,286
Oh! Friend of Marjorie?
Well get then... Fuck you man

914
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:59,998
Huh fuck you..fuck... You like that?
- Stop kicking it..You stop fucking kicking it

915
01:14:59,998 --> 01:15:04,843
Fuck your scooter and fuck Marjorie. She drugged
me and she stole from me.. Then she's going down

916
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:07,640
Let me think.

917
01:15:11,322 --> 01:15:16,928
Take it.
And open up..open up

918
01:15:18,189 --> 01:15:24,193
Ya, not bad... for a camera phone Huh?
You can keep those too -Fuck!

919
01:15:25,022 --> 01:15:28,886
And I was never here.
You hear me? -Fuck

920
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:33,639
Don't... Stop fucking with my car.

921
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:41,090
They're ready for you.

922
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:47,612
Learning is fun-tastic.
- What did you say to me?

923
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:50,790
Your desk?

924
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:57,486
Yea, I forgot that was there.
Such a dick sometimes

925
01:15:58,998 --> 01:16:05,130
This is very very bad, Elizabeth
- Incredibly very bad, Elizabeth

926
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:07,672
..and observe it
Amy, you said you wouldn't speak

927
01:16:09,028 --> 01:16:12,100
Bring him in

928
01:16:17,245 --> 01:16:21,336
Mr. Halabi, thank you for your time.
- Most welcome.

929
01:16:21,345 --> 01:16:28,666
I guess I should begin by saying that my
statement from earlier in the week was not true

930
01:16:29,716 --> 01:16:32,178
What part of it, exactly?

931
01:16:32,243 --> 01:16:35,258
All of it..
Pretty much

932
01:16:35,975 --> 01:16:37,672
I've never seen this woman before in my life

933
01:16:37,768 --> 01:16:43,146
Baloney
- You seem..very certain a couple of days ago?

934
01:16:43,152 --> 01:16:47,581
I did, because ...umm...

935
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:50,645
I'm a casual drug user

936
01:16:50,743 --> 01:16:54,498
That's my thing, and everybody
knows it. So..

937
01:16:54,499 --> 01:16:59,813
That explains me, making
absolutely no sense

938
01:17:01,457 --> 01:17:03,291
Thank you.

939
01:17:03,389 --> 01:17:06,904
You realise it..if we found out you're lying,
You're gonna lose your job.

940
01:17:06,905 --> 01:17:08,068
Plus jail time

941
01:17:08,164 --> 01:17:15,114
Yes I understand. I just don't want to see
an innocent teacher get hurt

942
01:17:15,806 --> 01:17:21,011
Thank you, sir.
- I don't want to see anybody get hurt

943
01:17:29,558 --> 01:17:34,548
What the hell was that?
- So, there you go. I guess that explains everything

944
01:17:34,548 --> 01:17:37,182
Retest!
Retest! Retest!

945
01:17:37,277 --> 01:17:41,009
Damn it! Squirrel.. I am not going
to have a repeat of 2008!

946
01:17:41,013 --> 01:17:43,776
Sit your ass down!

947
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:46,498
A retest on? C'mon

948
01:17:46,498 --> 01:17:48,520
Do we really wanna tell our
young people ...

949
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,921
...that if they study, sacrifice ...

950
01:17:49,922 --> 01:17:52,737
...and achieve the highest scores
in the state...

951
01:17:52,737 --> 01:17:56,308
...that they're rewarded
with suspicion?

952
01:17:57,309 --> 01:17:59,205
I don't!

953
01:17:59,205 --> 01:18:01,990
I find these kind of accusations troubling

954
01:18:01,991 --> 01:18:05,685
And quite frankly, reckless.

955
01:18:05,998 --> 01:18:07,793
I worked my ass off for this school.

956
01:18:07,794 --> 01:18:12,666
And I know I am not perfect.
But show me the perfect teacher.

957
01:18:12,709 --> 01:18:14,281
You can't.

958
01:18:14,281 --> 01:18:19,440
There are even teachers in
this very school who use drugs.

959
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:24,782
They do, they do use drugs
- They do -They do -They do

960
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:30,299
Wally, do you remember how I told you,
there are teachers here who use and abuse drugs?

961
01:18:30,311 --> 01:18:34,806
God damn it!
And I'm hearing about this now?

962
01:18:38,475 --> 01:18:40,140
Where is it Axle?
Where's it boy?

963
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:44,036
No, no, no that's my class.
Axle's barking at the wrong tree there

964
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:49,052
Ma'am! Please don't touch the dog.
- Your dog is mistaken

965
01:18:49,497 --> 01:18:54,085
We've got desk..
- He's not gonna find anything in here.

966
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:01,987
Clean!
- Haa! I told you

967
01:19:02,309 --> 01:19:04,941
Maybe there's a false bottom.

968
01:19:14,882 --> 01:19:20,480
That is not mine.
This... ss thiszzz..This isn't even my desk, it's hers!

969
01:19:20,514 --> 01:19:24,360
Don't worry Amy..
We'll get you the help you need.

970
01:19:26,454 --> 01:19:27,650
You monster!

971
01:19:27,687 --> 01:19:33,998
Wow wooo woo wow Amy.... Calm down, Amy.
- Fucking damn it! What the fuck!?

972
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:38,108
I stole her desk.
You can check my urine.

973
01:19:38,257 --> 01:19:40,998
Check it
Check my urine.

974
01:19:42,054 --> 01:19:45,195
Well it's been another great year
here at JAMS

975
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:49,587
With summer round the corner, it's time to say
goodbye not only to another school year..

976
01:19:49,588 --> 01:19:52,352
...but also to one of our own.

977
01:19:53,075 --> 01:19:59,109
Amy Squirrel, after six short years,
Amy is transferring out of the district

978
01:19:59,111 --> 01:20:01,658
Speech, speech
- Well..

979
01:20:02,126 --> 01:20:06,657
Aaah! Wally thank you for those kind words,
and thank you all

980
01:20:06,691 --> 01:20:11,326
My decision that I made myself to leave
was super difficult.

981
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:16,917
But when the superintendent personally ask you to work
at one of the worst school in the state?

982
01:20:16,917 --> 01:20:18,646
Well... you say 'YES'

983
01:20:19,646 --> 01:20:25,668
Boy, I am looking forward to bringing
my brand of genie energy..

984
01:20:25,668 --> 01:20:29,301
..To those underprivileged students
at Malcolm X High School.

985
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:33,082
Thank you.

986
01:20:33,294 --> 01:20:40,646
Hey, Elizabeth..Listen, since Amy's transferring,
maybe the two of us can start over

987
01:20:45,305 --> 01:20:51,128
Oh, hey there..Scott Delacorte. And you are?
- Leaving.

988
01:21:06,564 --> 01:21:11,198
- Elizabeth?
- Here.

989
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:15,047
- Sign my yearbook.
- Hold my ball sack

990
01:21:16,386 --> 01:21:20,003
I'll write my number down
just in case you need a lift...

991
01:21:20,046 --> 01:21:21,709
..after the surgery.

992
01:21:21,807 --> 01:21:24,852
For second, an extra set of hands to make sure
the implants are settling properly

993
01:21:24,886 --> 01:21:26,005
Thanks

994
01:21:26,271 --> 01:21:30,006
Hey, aah!..You're not gonna teach
again next year, are you?

995
01:21:30,006 --> 01:21:32,233
I don't know..
It's the only thing I'm good at

996
01:21:32,234 --> 01:21:37,327
I'm just saying maybe.. To consider doing
something else ... like anything else

997
01:21:37,372 --> 01:21:40,749
Like any other job ... in the entire world

998
01:21:41,852 --> 01:21:47,135
You know? The two of us...
It's never gonna happen.

999
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:50,403
- Clearly?
- How would that even work?

1000
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:55,113
Where do you even live? In some weird
apartment with some creepy roommate?

1001
01:21:55,113 --> 01:21:59,423
No,..My creepy roommate moved out.
So now it's just..just me ..and the dogs

1002
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:01,311
How many dogs do you have?
- Four.

1003
01:22:01,311 --> 01:22:04,415
Four dogs?
- Four Dobermans

1004
01:22:04,425 --> 01:22:06,456
Any family money?
- Yea, you bet?

1005
01:22:06,457 --> 01:22:11,896
We're talking like three figures..
Almost 700 bucks

1006
01:22:12,107 --> 01:22:15,400
So, basically, if I was gonna go out with you,
I would be making the conscious choice...

1007
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:19,202
..to be dating a Gym Teacher
who lives in a shack with four dogs?

1008
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:24,049
I prefer to think of it as two people
with amazing bodies...

1009
01:22:24,087 --> 01:22:27,181
...sharing those bodies with each other

1010
01:22:27,194 --> 01:22:29,027
Giving each other the gift of these bodies

1011
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:36,625
Anyway, actually none of these really matters
Umm... I sort of ..started seeing somebody

1012
01:22:39,909 --> 01:22:44,136
Really that's..Congratulations
I didn't..I didn't realize that so....

1013
01:22:46,236 --> 01:22:50,809
- Those stupid... so..
- I'm just fucking with you

1014
01:22:51,358 --> 01:22:54,273
Guess I deserve that one..?
- Yea, you must certainly did

1015
01:22:54,378 --> 01:22:58,820
I think it's about time you realize,
that the whole world's just...

1016
01:23:06,415 --> 01:23:10,081
See you around Gym teacher.

1017
01:23:18,053 --> 01:23:23,325
Hey..
Let's do that again.

1018
01:23:28,098 --> 01:23:31,630
THREE MONTHS LATER.

1019
01:23:40,546 --> 01:23:43,967
Hey, Elizabeth.
- Hey Lynn, how was your summer?

1020
01:23:43,997 --> 01:23:47,410
Oh it was great. I went to the zoo
almost every weekend

1021
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:49,019
Wow! Sounds great.

1022
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:52,368
Oh!..You didn't get your..
Your titties..?

1023
01:23:52,464 --> 01:23:55,123
Yea..I thought about it, you know
Cause I don't even need them.

1024
01:23:55,206 --> 01:23:59,998
Plus they're really expensive, you know..per tit
- Yea, and you got to get two of them

1025
01:24:01,721 --> 01:24:04,778
And I met a guy.
- Oh! Tell me everything.

1026
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:08,514
Did you find your Prince Charming?

1027
01:24:08,745 --> 01:24:12,598
Something like that

1028
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:16,486
Hey, you wanna grab lunch later?
- Oh! Oh sure, yea, my treat.

1029
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:19,121
Oh! You got it last time.
We'll split it. -Oh! Okay yeah

1030
01:24:23,464 --> 01:24:27,947
Hey, you in the cape
You're up first. Let's go.
