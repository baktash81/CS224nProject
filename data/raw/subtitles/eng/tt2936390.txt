1
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,926
Salem Alcazar, the heir

2
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:55,055
apparent to the free republic

3
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,097
of Alcazar.

4
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,641
Heir apparent?

5
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,434
So much for the election process.

6
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,102
Who said anything about an election?

7
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,855
This guy's buying up ordnance to suppress

8
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,858
the latest rebellion against his father.

9
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:06,901
Dead or alive?

10
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,402
Alive.

11
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,571
The guy he's working for however...

12
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,239
Victor Gobefren.

13
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,365
You know him?

14
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,533
He tried to hire me.

15
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,826
Well fortunately for us,

16
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:16,952
you've got integrity Grigori.

17
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,203
Pay was terrible.

18
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,329
Well it shouldn't have been.

19
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,956
This guy's probably

20
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,082
the biggest arms dealer in the world today.

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,876
Besides Uncle Sam.

22
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,544
I'll tell you what Val, while you're contemplating

23
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,588
running for office, we're gonna kill Victor,

24
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,548
grab Salem, and take home a healthy paycheck,

25
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,548
all right guys?

26
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:30,841
We're just...

27
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,427
Were just gonna kill him?

28
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,595
Not even talk to him?

29
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,804
Ask him a few questions?

30
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,890
Get his side of the story?

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,809
Hey Dax.

32
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,936
Yeah?

33
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,562
Who's flying the plane?

34
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,563
Right.

35
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,773
Right.

36
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,446
He's a liability.

37
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,822
We're all a liability.

38
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,074
He's a bloody time bomb.

39
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,241
You wanna do what he does?

40
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,826
No.

41
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,994
I don't want anyone to do what he does.

42
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,829
Yeah that's right.

43
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,289
That's not the kind of world we live in Blackwood.

44
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,457
Alright?

45
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,506
All this used to belong to the KGB.

46
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,217
Not bad for a poor boy from Ukraine, huh?

47
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,053
A man in your position must have many enemies.

48
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,222
I suppose I've made a few.

49
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,766
You don't worry about living in such open space?

50
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,560
We are in the heart of Moscow.

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,647
What could I possibly have to worry about?

00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,501

00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,506
Do you know who I am?

78
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,633
No, I'm just pointing this gun at you by accident.

79
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,845
Any problems?

80
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,972
Nope!

81
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,307
No?

82
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,599
Dax killed the bloody Kaydrum.

83
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,726
The Kaydrum?

84
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,894
He was a spy.

85
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,021
Who was he spying for?

86
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,022
The Russians.

87
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,523
The Russians.

88
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,524
You have any idea where we are?

89
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,608
Russia!

90
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,651
Yeah, we're surrounded.

91
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,652
Yeah.

92
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,778
Do me a favor.

93
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,946
Keep an eye on him.

94
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,239
Tie him up, kill him.

95
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,866
Wait!

96
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,950
No, no, you already killed the Kaydrum.

97
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,118
But--

98
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,494
You know the deal Dax.

99
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,704
Um...

100
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,166
He could be my next employer.

101
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,250
Integrity.

102
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,376
Huh...

103
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,550
To assure--

104
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,843
You should have offered me more money last time.

105
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,682
Wasn't expecting it this soon.

106
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,017
We need a new exit strategy.

107
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,392
Anyone?

108
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,602
I'll give you anything.

109
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,939
Catering truck?

110
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,319
Anything.

111
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:12,140
<i>♪ There ain't no good</i> <i>without evil ♪</i>

112
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:23,693
<i>♪ There ain't no</i> <i>good without evil ♪</i>

113
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,534
<i>♪ There ain't no good ♪</i>

114
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,544
How you feeling?

115
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,545
Oh thanks--

116
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,592
You happy?

117
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,593
What about Victor?

118
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,179
Oh, he's dead.

119
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,765
Pay the man.

120
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,523
That was festive.

121
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,362
Well I must say,

122
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,281
it's a pleasure doing business with the both of you two.

123
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,532
You have an interesting definition of pleasure,

124
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,700
Mister Rekker.

125
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,785
As do you, Mister Smith.

126
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,621
I don't think she likes you very much.

127
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,789
You can't be serious.

128
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:08,131
Please, let me go. Please, I beg you.

129
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,761
Hello?

130
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,275
Is there something on your mind Agent Hayes?

131
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,943
I don't see why we're paying that traitor

132
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,778
to do our dirty work.

133
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,780
That's because you spend too much time in the field

134
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,283
and not enough in the capitol.

135
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,327
Plausible deniability.

136
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,083
Kidnapping the son of a supposed ally in the heart of Moscow

137
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,503
is not something we can afford to have our fingerprints on.

138
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,088
What if he was captured?

139
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,048
Well if the Russians had captured Rekker,

140
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,425
they would think they were doing us a favor, right?

141
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,093
I would agree with that.

142
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,303
So would half the pentagon, that's the point.

143
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,971
So now that we got what we wanted

144
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,932
what keeps them from selling us out?

145
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,600
More money.

146
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,809
And what happens when someone comes along

147
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,520
with a better offer?

148
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,022
Then we make sure that someone works for us.

149
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,485
Somehow that doesn't make me feel any better.

150
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,739
It should.

151
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,558
Vincent Rekker.

152
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,934
Do I know you?

153
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,437
Carl Kess.

154
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,065
The arms dealer?

155
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,733
I prefer diplomat.

156
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,903
I'm sure a lot of people would disagree.

157
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,656
Yeah, a lot of people are naive.

158
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,952
What do you want?

159
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,703
To make a lot of money.

160
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm hoping you'll help me finish what you started.

161
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,167
I don't know what you're talking about.

162
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,752
Rare Earth elements.

163
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,680
Pardon me?

164
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,764
There's only two countries with concentrated deposits.

165
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,934
One's China, you wanna guess who the other one is?

166
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,021
The Republic of Alcazar.

167
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,024
Never heard of them.

168
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,942
Right.

169
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,028
The United States can't be seen in support of a dictator

170
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,946
that routinely uses genocide

171
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,907
as a means of holding onto power

172
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,035
but it can't afford to alienate the only non-Chinese

173
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,288
source of material its economy is so dependent on.

174
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,375
So this guy loses his son in Moscow,

175
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,253
blames the Russians,

176
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,753
and then his army doesn't get the weapons it needs

177
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,838
to suppress the local rebellion. That's nice Miser Kess.

178
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,675
Well played out. Yeah, unless the

179
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,427
rebellion fails, then what?

180
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,470
That'd be a shame, but it's none of my business.

181
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,931
The moment when you put a bullet in Victor Gobefren's head

182
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,807
it became your business.

183
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,355
Like I said, I don't know what you're talking about.

184
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,024
There's an abandoned power plant filled with ordnance,

185
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,027
that was destined for Alcazar regime,

186
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,613
but our mutual acquaintances

187
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,531
would like it to go to the other side.

188
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,616
I'm not a gun runner.

189
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,117
Well, but I am,

190
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,035
and all I need are the guns to run.

191
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,995
No, what you need is for someone to go get them for you.

192
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,082
Look, if I don't sell those guns to the rebels,

193
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,000
Gobefren's cronies are gonna grow a pair

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,670
and hold firm on the original deal.

195
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,632
Either way, a lot of innocent people are gonna die.

196
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,049
True, but one way is a fight,

197
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,260
the other way is a slaughter.

198
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,057
Look, I've done some digging.

199
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,560
Despite your less than sterling reputation

200
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,771
you care about more than just money.

201
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,898
Even if that were true, you don't.

202
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,567
How do I know I can trust you?

203
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,486
Yeah, selling someone else's guns to a group

204
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,071
that's backed by an off the books credit line

205
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,906
from the United States,

206
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,075
that might be the sweetest deal I've ever made.

207
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,620
Ever sweeter if you're dealing to both sides.

208
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,246
But said creditors,

209
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,456
they're sending along an observation group

210
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,166
just to make sure

211
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,460
that everything goes where it's supposed to go.

212
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,257
Okay, I'll make a few calls, I'll verify some things.

213
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,841
Fair enough.

214
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,469
Maybe we'll talk terms tomorrow, okay?

215
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,929
I was hoping you'd be leaving tomorrow.

216
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,723
Leaving?

217
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:09,932
Where to?

218
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,436
Chernobyl.

219
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,440
Chernobyl?

220
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,857
Chernobyl?

221
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,527
That's crazier than I am.

222
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,986
Yep.

223
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,738
What's Chernobyl?

224
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,615
That's right, history wasn't your strong point,

225
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,200
was it darling?

226
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,201
Or reading. Or maths.

227
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,578
Or thinking.

228
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,415
Nuclear meltdown.

229
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,459
It was a long time ago, so don't worry.

230
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,085
It's the one place

231
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,754
you can fill with enough illegal ordnance

232
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,756
to supply an entire third world country

233
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,342
and pretty much be guaranteed no one's gonna bother you.

234
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,177
Yeah, that is until you grow an extra arm

235
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,095
and a second asshole,

236
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,056
then every circus in town comes knocking at your door.

237
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,975
How long?

238
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,061
Long enough to where getting in and out's

239
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,937
not gonna be any worse than Dax working on his sun tan.

240
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,191
So what's the catch?

241
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,027
Who says there's a catch, Shiro?

242
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,654
There's always a catch.

243
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,869
CIA's bringing in an observation team

244
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,453
to keep an eye on us,

245
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,540
just in case anything goes missing.

246
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,166
They don't trust Kess

247
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,793
and they don't trust us,

248
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,880
and I sure as hell don't trust them.

249
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,136
Well, that's bloody fantastic.

250
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,055
So now we're babysitting?

251
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,682
I like babies.

252
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,267
Oh don't go there.

253
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,936
-Seriously. -Guys!

254
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,153
Bloody hell.

255
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,407
As your captain,

256
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,576
I advise you all to fasten your seat belts.

257
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,036
This is gonna be one bumpy ride.

258
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,416
You're not a captain.

259
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,793
Oh yes I am.

260
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,872
Why are we here?

261
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,167
They have their own strip team.

262
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,794
It's our plane.

263
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,673
You know what I mean.

264
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,885
Probably to kill us once we secure the ordnance.

265
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:51,928
What?

266
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,137
Why?

267
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,015
To send a message to Kess.

268
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,225
Patch things up with the Russians.

269
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,479
Tie up loose ends in Alcazar.

270
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,147
Plenty of reasons.

271
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,817
You don't seem very concerned about this.

272
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,610
It is what it is.

273
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,697
We should tell Rekker.

274
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,283
I'm sure he's already figured it out.

275
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,420
The captain would like to have a word with you ma'am.

276
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,547
Captain?

277
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,298
He used to be a captain.

278
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,884
Used to be?

279
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,510
The guy who's flying the plane

280
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,261
would like to have a word with you ma'am.

281
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,937
Take a load off, we've got some time.

282
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,480
Then why am I up here?

283
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,316
Because I wanna discuss logistics.

284
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,527
There nothing to discuss.

285
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,529
She's got pretty eyes.

286
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,822
You run your mission however you see fit.

287
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,114
That's why you were hired.

288
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,658
You've got pretty eyes too.

289
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,577
Let me get this straight.

290
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,453
You're gonna be standing right behind us, fully armed,

291
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,748
while we're engaged in multiple fire fights, yeah?

292
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,751
Every one of my men is an experienced combat veteran.

293
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,004
You don't have to worry about friendly fire.

294
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,715
Who said anything about it being friendly?

295
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,468
What are you implying?

296
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,305
I've done enough dirty work over the years

297
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,392
to become a serious liability, I admit that.

298
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,228
Plenty of my colleagues wanna see me dead

299
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,607
and I got the strangest feeling that you wouldn't mind

300
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,776
being first in line to pull the trigger.

301
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,736
What possible reason do I have to think

302
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,781
that there's not a target strapped to the back of my head?

303
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,532
Securing a politically stable Alcazar

304
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,201
outweighs anything you or I mean to them.

305
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,120
They only want my men and me alive

306
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,163
because we're taking those guns straight into the war zone

307
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,415
and fighting with the rebels.

308
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,000
And after you get them?

309
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,710
You think we'll try to take you out?

310
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,545
I think there's a high probability

311
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,589
I eat a bullet when the dust settles, so yeah.

312
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:55,134
I'd like nothing more than to feed it to you myself,

313
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,761
but if you're half as good as they say you are

314
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,429
it simply won't be worth the price.

315
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,015
Right, I'm glad we're clear on one thing.

316
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,433
We're clear.

317
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,644
Hey.

318
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,772
Let me ask you a question.

319
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,238
Why is it you hate me so much?

320
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,867
Because you betrayed your country.

321
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,997
They betrayed me first.

322
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,062
What's in there?

323
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,605
Shit.

324
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,648
Shit?

325
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,441
Yeah.

326
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,567
Burn reactor shit?

327
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,568
Yeah.

328
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,653
Ooh.

329
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,574
You're probably gonna grow an eye there now.

330
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,160
That'll be good.

331
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,953
I need another one to keep one on you.

332
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,000
It's a little too quiet.

333
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,210
Val.

334
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,672
See if you can get eyes on anything.

335
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:15,942
Nothing.

336
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,571
Head on in.

337
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,115
Don't engage.

338
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,700
Just give me numbers and positions.

339
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,874
You're sending him in alone?

340
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,334
It works better that way. What if he's spotted?

341
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,171
If they spot Shiro we're dead before we get started.

342
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,930
Isn't it about time we got this show on the road?

343
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,432
I didn't realize you were in such a hurry general.

344
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,184
Let's just say I've been waiting for this

345
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,645
for a very long time.

346
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,230
So it's not strictly business?

347
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,816
Bloodshed is never strictly business.

348
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,025
I beg to differ.

349
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,526
Of course you do.

350
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,945
That's what's the matter with men like you.

351
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:01,904
General...

352
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,739
It's okay.

353
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,449
You know, everyone who comes knocking at my door

354
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,827
has a speech about God and country.

355
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,204
It makes them feel better about why they're there,

356
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,666
and a big bag of money all the same.

357
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,793
You know, you're no better than him?

358
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,297
Never said I was.

359
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,632
Send in the pilots kid.

360
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,217
Let's get this show on the road.

361
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,641
-Clear.

362
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:33,311
At least for the first couple of buildings.

363
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,521
You mean that Kess was wrong?

364
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,439
This is an ambush.

365
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,607
If it is, we'll be right here in the middle with you.

366
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,193
It looks you will be

367
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,443
because we're changing marching orders.

368
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,361
You're coming with me

369
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,571
and every one of your men is going with one of mine.

370
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,656
We're going in together.

371
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,991
That's not the deal.

372
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,784
None of this is the deal.

373
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,287
You want your guns, you gotta earn them.

374
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,080
We go in together or you can go in alone

375
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,957
and find a new ride home.

376
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,250
He's right.

377
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,918
It doesn't matter.

378
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,795
It does if we wanna do what we came here to do.

379
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,838
Let's go.

380
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,380
Good.

381
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,423
Pick a partner and watch your back.

382
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,717
You and me.

383
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,426
Who wants to be my bitch?

384
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,931
Looks like it's you and me big boy.

385
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,099
Oh shit.

386
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,130
Right!

387
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,783
Got it.

388
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,910
Whatever the hell that was.

389
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:56,787
You sure?

390
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,247
I don't miss.

391
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,513
Ron!

392
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,017
Hey buddy, you'll get hit by him!

393
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,521
Move!

394
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,420
Go.

395
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,550
Shit.

396
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,396
God almighty.

397
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,277
Give me your hand.

398
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,362
Let's put him down.

399
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,405
Here I've got you.

400
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,447
Okay.

401
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,990
-Okay. -Okay.

402
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,116
-Nice and easy. -Okay I've got it.

403
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,159
Got you.

404
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,286
Get back.

405
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,121
Okay, get this off him.

406
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,792
Okay Val, get me an in and out of the perimeter ASAP.

407
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,170
You shouldn't stare at things like that.

408
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,589
You'll never get it out of your head.

409
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,678
Keeping my observation team alive

410
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,680
is part of this exercise.

411
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,642
He paired his men with yours, clever.

412
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,936
It's hostile territory.

413
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,521
He was expecting an ambush.

414
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,731
No he was expecting your men to betray him.

415
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,899
He's cautious.

416
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,484
Or he was tipped off. They don't know enough

417
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,069
to tip him off.

418
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,029
Most of them, anyway.

419
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,072
If you think he can change the rules to get a better deal,

420
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,656
forget it.

421
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,367
If your people can't tell the difference

422
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,993
between combatants and non combatants,

423
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,579
then we should stick to what we've got.

424
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,122
It's cheaper to drop bombs anyway.

425
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,082
Let me tell you something.

426
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,543
My people are capable of surgical precision, literally.

427
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,379
Good, because I'd rather not lose any more of mine.

428
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,676
Okay you're wearing your vest.

429
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,011
Good man.

430
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,013
What the hell hit me?

431
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,599
Is it tank?

432
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,016
Yeah, a tank.

433
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,936
Rest up for a sec.

434
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,314
Val, what the hell was it?

435
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:31,609
That's the question.

436
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,612
He's one of the guards that the kids told us about.

437
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,946
Guards?

438
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,115
I nailed it twice.

439
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,741
He nailed with that thing.

440
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,368
I don't care what they're wearing for armor.

441
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,369
Nothing survives that.

442
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,870
No kidding.

443
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,080
Obviously there was more than one.

444
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,458
No, not obviously.

445
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,042
Only one line of gunfire.

446
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,544
It swept left to right, changed positions,

447
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,171
then swept right to left.

448
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,797
If there were two more of those things up there

449
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,049
we'd already be dead, all of us.

450
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,635
How is that possible?

451
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,386
How in the hell should I know?

452
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,721
Let's not stick around here to find out.

453
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,308
Big man, I'm gonna need you.

454
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,684
Up, up.

455
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,147
Good, okay.

456
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,983
Listen up, I need more cover.

457
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,568
I need more intel

458
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,236
and I need to get a beat on whatever the hell

459
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,946
that thing is that's trying to take us out.

460
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,241
Wait, where's Shiro?

461
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,410
Never can tell.

462
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,662
This way.

463
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,088
Blackwood. Okay.

464
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,720
We breach, Grigori, you're gonna clear.

465
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,847
Stay back. Dax?

466
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,058
Yeah.

467
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,942
Three, two, one.

468
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,642
What is this place?

469
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,436
Fuel depot?

470
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:57,481
Oh, radioactive gasoline, great.

471
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,579
What the hell is this?

472
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,549
Down!

473
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,896
He's tough.

474
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,464
Why aren't you shooting at it?

475
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,674
Shoot it?

476
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,342
That thing's unstoppable!

477
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,636
Especially when you're not shooting at it.

478
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,532
Shit.

479
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,340
Okay, you want some more?

480
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,551
Okay.

481
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,649
Run!

482
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,994
Well played.

483
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:59,120
I thought you said your drones were damn near unstoppable.

484
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,372
I'm sorry general.

485
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,790
Was one of them stopped?

486
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,124
Definitely slowed down a little.

487
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,002
A little bit,

488
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:08,254
but they're up against the best of the best, aren't they?

489
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,048
They can handle themselves in a firefight.

490
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,633
I'll give them that.

491
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,259
They also have numbers on their side,

492
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,720
don't have to worry about friendlies,

493
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,971
and they're still on the run.

494
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,891
He does have a point general.

495
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,936
Besides, we're just getting started here.

496
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,187
Come on.

497
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,566
Move, come on, run!

498
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,568
Go!

499
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,569
Move!

500
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,695
Go!

501
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,063
Go!

502
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,523
Down the hall.

503
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,217
Shh...

504
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:39,972
What the hell are you doing?

505
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,139
You tell me,

506
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,849
because I'm pretty sure

507
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,018
we're not recovering a rouge weapons shipment.

508
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,561
Tell me.

509
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,354
I don't know.

510
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,815
That's a wrong answer.

511
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,195
Rekker, please, I just saved your life.

512
00:35:56,195 --> 00:36:00,450
Which is the only reason you're still breathing.

513
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,578
I know how this looks, but we're in this together.

514
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,124
Tell me, why is it that thing goes after both of our men?

515
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,708
Not mine, and mine alone.

516
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,961
I've already lost men today.

517
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,338
Who happened to be in the line of fire,

518
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:17,759
a mistake those things did not make a second time.

519
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,473
You're right.

520
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,975
You were set up.

521
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,226
But I was set up too.

522
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,146
They told me the same thing.

523
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:34,651
Alcazar, weapons retrieval, strictly observation, all of it.

524
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,863
Strictly observation?

525
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,494
So if you're not lying to me

526
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,954
that means your hand must be lying to you.

527
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,747
How do you know?

528
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,708
Mission parameters.

529
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,170
Yeah, you were sent to observe,

530
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,421
to observe us getting fed to those...

531
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,758
What are they?

532
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,136
I don't know.

533
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,889
Some kind of robot.

534
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,431
Robots don't bleed.

535
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,979
That's so the liquid doesn't look like blood.

536
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,107
Too fluid, too organic.

537
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,026
People can't survive a bullet to the head.

538
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,986
I didn't say they were people.

539
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,321
Looks like you've seen them up close and personal Shiro.

540
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,948
Close enough.

541
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,949
Where are the others?

542
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,659
On the run.

543
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,452
As far as I can tell there's only two of them.

544
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,997
One of them's already heavily damaged.

545
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,582
Well we should go after the other one.

546
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,333
-Yeah.

547
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,835
-Take it apart.

548
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,378
See what they're made of.

549
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,338
And find out what we're really up against.

550
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,093
You coming?

551
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,805
I'm gonna die.

552
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,043
Why'd you stop?

553
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,628
This is the perfect place for an ambush.

554
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,463
Exactly, so we're gonna keep moving.

555
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,007
No, no, we're gonna draw its attention first.

556
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,135
What?

557
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,261
Give me your gun.

558
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,386
What?

559
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,679
Your gun, mine's empty.

560
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,601
Do you wanna get out of this alive or not?

561
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,817
Thanks.

562
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,281
That's great, keep yelling.

563
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,324
Defector!

564
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,993
Hey, that really hurts.

565
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,644
Get off me you idiot, I'm an observer.

566
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,067
There, he's in the shed!

567
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:26,072
The shed, he's in the shed, there!

568
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,962
Take this.

569
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,486
Let's see how you like depleted uranium you son of a bitch.

570
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,868
Sorry!

571
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,272
That wasn't so bad.

572
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:52,117
That was possibly the most ruthless thing I've ever seen.

573
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,327
It was ruthless, reckless,

574
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,704
pretty impressive.

575
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,165
Surprised?

576
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,750
Considering how often I've used them

577
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,710
to tie up my loose ends, I shouldn't be.

578
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,214
They always find a way though.

579
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,968
But you're willing to sacrifice them now?

580
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,594
So who's the ruthless one?

581
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,012
Well if you tie up too many loose ends

582
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,931
then you become one yourself,

583
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,891
especially if you know where all the bodies are buried.

584
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,893
I'll remember that next time we do business.

585
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,230
If there is a next time.

586
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,318
This isn't much of a sacrifice if they don't all go down.

587
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,611
That drone was barely functioning.

588
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,113
The next one will finish them

589
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,697
as soon as it's done with Rekker.

590
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,241
That's assuming Rekker's dumb enough

591
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,451
to let himself be found.

592
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,618
Rekker?

593
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:38,704
He's dumb enough.

594
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,380
Yeah, didn't think that was gonna work.

595
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,113
You were saying?

596
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,491
That clever bastard.

597
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:57,575
He figured it out.

598
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,743
Figured what out?

599
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,370
The setup, us.

600
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,039
She used herself as a shield

601
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,416
because she knew it wouldn't shoot her.

602
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,958
And, considering how much

603
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,710
you wanna charge for those things,

604
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,837
I pretty much expect them to work miracles.

605
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,131
You know, miracles are overthrowing

606
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,131
a hostile government

607
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,674
with no American casualties,

608
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,301
not sparing every civilian

609
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,554
that throws himself in the line of fire.

610
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:21,433
Fine, take her off the friendly list,

611
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,017
but keep Barns.

612
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,727
I need at least one on ground assessment

613
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,229
before this thing is over.

614
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,731
That's assuming he doesn't bleed out first.

615
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,746
So...

616
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,375
He shot him in the foot?

617
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,422
It's not like he was any help,

618
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,923
until he started screaming.

619
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,592
Then at least he got its attention.

620
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:56,801
In...

621
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,762
Dax's defense,

622
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,724
he seemed to be trying to identify himself

623
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,269
and it pretty much ignored him after that.

624
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,523
I was unarmed and injured

625
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:11,816
while you people were shooting at it.

626
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,359
Of course it ignored me.

627
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,777
That was before we started shooting.

628
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,749
You wanna tell me what the hell is going on here Barns?

629
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,294
You're way out of line agent.

630
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,212
I'm out of line

631
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,465
We walked into the middle of a god damn blood bath

632
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,634
and every single one of my men died because of it.

633
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,927
That's on you, not me.

634
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,013
You let him pair your people with his.

635
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,641
I did what I had to do to accomplish the mission.

636
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:47,726
Unfortunately, I didn't know what the real mission was.

637
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,770
The question is, did you? Oh if you think I did,

638
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,814
I could tell you?

639
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:55,360
Or do clearance levels not even matter anymore, Agent Hayes?

640
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,861
Between you, me, and this gun,

641
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,113
very little matters anymore.

642
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,871
Put the gun down.

643
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,297
Come on. We're not gonna get any

644
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,297
answers from a dead man.

645
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,257
Come on, put it down.

646
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,262
There you go.

647
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,224
Good.

648
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,850
But we can get answers

649
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,477
from the remains of those things out there.

650
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,646
Val, do me a favor and guard the door.

651
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,147
On it.

652
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:35,941
Dax?

653
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,109
Yeah, no.

654
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,194
Yes.

655
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,946
-Rekker.

656
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,657
We're out of time and we're out of options Blackwood.

657
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,909
Dax, I need you to look after Agent Barns.

658
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,661
What?

659
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,496
You can't leave me in here with this psychopath.

660
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,415
I can do whatever I want.

661
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,834
I'm taking the guns for now.

662
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,130
I need him alive, you got that?

663
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,298
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,799
Alive, I got it.

665
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,094
Dax?

666
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,972
Good, let's go.

667
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,656
I swear to god.

668
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:27,368
Oh, are you a religious man, Agent Barns?

669
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,833
Does it even matter?

670
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,713
I think it does.

671
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,007
Lots of friendly people.

672
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,761
You get to drink wine when you're underage,

673
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:47,012
even if the priest sometimes...

674
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,725
Do bad things.

675
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,105
But that's enough about me.

676
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:00,735
Let's talk about you for a little while.

677
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,995
For keeping me from killing him.

678
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,038
Doesn't mean he's not gonna die.

679
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,843
Hey, you okay?

680
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:29,681
Just give me a minute.

681
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,392
Is he always like this?

682
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,020
More or less,

683
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,022
but he is trying to save our lives.

684
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,483
I thought he was pretty much the devil incarnate.

685
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,694
Until you walk a mile in his shoes.

686
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,489
Afghanistan, don't you know the story?

687
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,574
He lost a bunch of men in a botched raid

688
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,409
and then killed his commanding officer to cover it up.

689
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,412
I meant the real story, not the official one.

690
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,080
There's an unofficial one?

691
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,711
His unit was sold out for political capitol.

692
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,755
Some paper pushers up the line wanted more troops

693
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,133
and they needed some spectacular failure

694
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,761
with a bunch of casualties to justify it.

695
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,473
When Rekker found out he went AWOL

696
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,142
and he killed as many of them as he could find.

697
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,102
How do you know?

698
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,271
Because I helped him do it.

699
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,778
I was in the unit assigned to run his backup for him.

700
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,870
We should go.

701
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:38,249
You don't wanna go in there, and neither do I.

702
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,044
We need answers.

703
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:53,972
We're gonna bring a few more online.

704
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,224
Bring as many as you need.

705
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,392
I just wanna see results. Get out of the way kid.

706
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,439
I'm bringing them all out.

707
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,445
All right.

708
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,654
All of them.

709
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,719
It stinks.

710
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,144
You stink.

711
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,398
I smell like a real man should smell.

712
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,858
Pull back the skin real man.

713
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:06,879
This is so sick.

714
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,547
You're worse than Dax.

715
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,717
It feels like muscle.

716
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,928
Because it is, sort of.

717
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:16,305
Synthetic muscle.

718
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,391
It was big news a few years ago.

719
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:23,103
Some company created biologically compatible tissue

720
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,189
that responded to nerve and pulses.

721
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:28,359
It was supposed to be the holy grail for wounded vets.

722
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,821
Wow, Russia never had anything like this.

723
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:34,030
Unfortunately, neither did America.

724
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,950
The company that created this kind of disappeared

725
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,118
and the news dried up.

726
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:42,164
I just figured it was something that didn't

727
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:42,164
work out, until now.

728
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,209
Somebody seems to have found a more lucrative use for it.

729
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,043
I'm not sure killing us is all that lucrative.

730
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,296
Yeah, but watching us die might be.

731
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:55,302
They say you were an arms dealer like Carl Kess.

732
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,138
How would you demo your newest, most expensive product?

733
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,598
Line of fire.

734
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,766
Line?

735
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,727
And tie up loose ends

736
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,395
with the people you're trying to impress while you're at it.

737
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,981
Huh, he set us up.

738
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,273
No, not him.

739
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,692
Everyone Shiro.

740
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,945
Everyone set us up. What about the girl?

741
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,532
Is she in on it?

742
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,661
I don't think so, for what it's worth.

743
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,206
All right guys, any idea?

744
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,499
What are these things?

745
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,338
I'll tell you what Grigori,

746
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,089
I'm about to find out.

747
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:50,357
I told you to keep him alive Dax.

748
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,068
You tell me a lot of things.

749
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:53,444
Yeah I do, but you never listen.

750
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,737
I listen.

751
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:57,073
I don't always do, but I listen.

752
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,868
Did you learn anything?

753
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:03,704
Plenty, I can tell you all about the girl he molested

754
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,289
behind a tree in the 3rd grade.

755
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,833
Anything about our current situation Dax?

756
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:08,918
Oh, you mean the drones?

757
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,628
Jesus Christ.

758
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,379
Forget about the drones.

759
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,882
What about the things that are trying to kill us?

760
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,092
Yeah, the drones.

761
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:17,217
That's what they're called.

762
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,510
Oh.

763
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:21,806
Well, what are they?

764
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,682
Biosynthetic shock troops,

765
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,017
genetically engineered tissue

766
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,644
grown in a cybernetic skeleton.

767
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,354
Kind of a combination of man and machine,

768
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,107
but just the scary parts.

769
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,233
Well that's horrifying.

770
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,944
It is.

771
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:36,528
It really is, and this a lot coming from me.

772
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,947
The fact that they're called drones

773
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,824
implies that there's a pilot.

774
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,283
Sitting in a room somewhere, hopped up on caffeine,

775
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,827
playing us like a video game.

776
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,954
Well that's terrific.

777
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:46,330
How many are there Dax?

778
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,748
Agent Barnes didn't know,

779
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,458
and believe me...

780
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,626
I asked.

781
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:57,215
-I believe him. -So do I.

782
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,718
He seemed to think there was a hell of a

783
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,718
lot more than two though.

784
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:03,014
That means this little demonstration isn't over.

785
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:07,601
If I had to take a guess I'd say not only is it not

786
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:07,601
over, but all bets are off.

787
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,395
The original plan was to see how well they

788
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,395
function under pressure

789
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,440
against experienced opponents.

790
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,862
Now, we're a serious liability, Agent Hayes included.

791
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,697
They needed us dead, and since there aren't any

792
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,532
more friendlies in the mix

793
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,951
they will not be pulling any more punches.

794
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,286
Why don't we just make a run for the plane?

795
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,830
Yeah, that's not a good idea.

796
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,123
Why not?

797
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,666
Because you put a bomb on it.

798
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,292
Yeah, all that equipment you were carrying,

799
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,252
or Barnes or whoever, it doesn't matter.

800
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,172
The point is, if we try to disarm it, they'll know

801
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:37,673
and they'll detonate it.

802
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:39,299
Forget about the plane,

803
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,718
just run for the nearest hooch.

804
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,218
They thought of that too.

805
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,512
Humans get tired.

806
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:45,056
They need food, water, rest.

807
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:47,766
Drones just swap pilots and keep on going.

808
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,019
Plus they can see in the dark and have areal support.

809
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,645
The only reason we're still alive

810
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,732
is they can't see through walls, yet.

811
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,358
They're working on this new form of sonar--

812
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,985
Not important.

813
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,277
Right.

814
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,946
So what's the play?

815
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,407
The only play we have Shiro, to fight.

816
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,992
How do we fight those things?

817
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,535
One at a time.

818
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,495
You see, they don't know where we're at

819
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,206
and they have a lot of ground to cover,

820
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:11,540
which means they're gonna have to split up

821
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,167
and search one by one.

822
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,835
How the hell do you know?

823
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,754
If you were piloting one of these things

824
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,463
what's the worse that could happen?

825
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,216
It gets destroyed.

826
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:21,592
Right, then you just grab another bag of chips

827
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,885
and you try again.

828
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:25,763
No fear makes people stupid.

829
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,432
Listen up, we hit them fast,

830
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,643
we hit them hard, and we can take these things out.

831
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,146
We'll need to stay on the move once the fighting starts.

832
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,773
Every one of those things is gonna know

833
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,482
exactly where we're at.

834
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,611
Lock and load, clocks ticking.

835
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,820
Nice work.

836
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,065
You think he saw us?

837
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,026
Nah.

838
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,194
Really?

839
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,696
Bloody hell!

840
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,580
Nice shot.

841
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,707
I know.

842
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,086
Let's move.

843
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,183
Now they know what they're up against.

844
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,726
Doesn't matter.

845
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,019
They'll still be overwhelmed.

846
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,354
It's just a matter of time.

847
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:41,666
You see them?

848
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,834
Yeah.

849
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:43,919
Good, do what you do.

850
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,129
Yeah.

851
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,391
Nice.

852
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,980
Remind me to start carrying more of these.

853
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,400
When we get through this Val, don't you worry, I will.

854
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,572
Three teams.

855
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,615
You sure we should split up?

856
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,492
They're onto us.

857
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,161
We need to change tactics to keep them off balance.

858
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,870
You two with Grigori.

859
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,538
You two, you're with me.

860
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,832
Let's move!

861
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,792
Watch your backs, let's go.

862
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:14,486
I just love killing strong droids like you.

863
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,039
Listen up.

864
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,500
First pilot to make a kill gets an extra $100,000.

865
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:35,632
Find another one?

866
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:40,845
You jump next time.

867
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,055
Nope.

868
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:52,399
We don't have enough fire power

869
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:53,858
to take out one of those things.

870
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,277
Yes we do, just not on us.

871
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,362
Fuel depot?

872
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,448
Yeah.

873
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:00,698
How much time do you need?

874
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:01,699
How much can you give me?

875
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,826
Not much.

876
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,356
You okay?

877
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:15,440
Been better.

878
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,483
You think it's down?

879
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,693
Yeah.

880
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,777
Maybe.

881
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,488
Hell I don't know.

882
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,656
Let's just get out of here, what do you say?

883
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:23,865
Yeah.

884
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,327
Actually I've changed my assessment.

885
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,995
The drones are fine.

886
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,039
It's your pilots that need work.

887
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,000
They're not up to dealing with experienced field operatives.

888
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,044
I couldn't agree with you more general,

889
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,381
but field experience,

890
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,634
that's another reason for this little demonstration.

891
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,261
So your men get better on our nickel?

892
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,012
They could be your men.

893
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,138
Their services are for hire like everything else.

894
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,432
Hire?

895
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:49,558
Why the hell would I bother?

896
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:51,226
They're quick learners.

897
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:52,810
You better hope so, for all of our sakes.

898
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,771
Don't worry, they'll run out of bullets

899
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,565
before I run out of drones.

900
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:03,905
We need to find a loner.

901
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,574
I'm down to my last round.

902
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,664
Hey, up there.

903
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:45,697
Hey.

904
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,210
What now?

905
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,464
Whenever he's settled, I'm ready.

906
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,480
Val!

907
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,774
Get her out of here!

908
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,696
Forget about me.

909
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:13,947
Stay with Shiro.

910
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,365
It's too late.

911
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,560
They're gonna die in there.

912
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,646
Probably, but there's nothing we can do about it.

913
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,192
I can die with them.

914
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,777
You do that, they win.

915
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:55,279
Who's they?

916
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,532
Kess, Smith.

917
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:59,116
Everyone who sold us out.

918
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,245
Don't let them get away with it.

919
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:08,334
They already have, because I don't know how to beat them.

920
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:12,065
What is this place?

921
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:14,943
Some kind of pressure chamber.

922
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:17,988
You think they'll make it through that door?

923
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,741
Not before we run out of air.

924
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:25,369
You should've stayed with Shiro.

925
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,705
Nah, I'd have just been in the way.

926
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:33,128
Besides, if anybody's gonna make it out of here alive

927
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:34,462
it'll be him.

928
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:40,301
And if anyone doesn't, it will be me.

929
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:47,475
If anyone shouldn't, it would be me.

930
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:49,602
Dax...

931
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,187
No, it's true.

932
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,524
I'm worse than those things out there

933
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:58,194
and the sad part about it is,

934
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,570
I know it too.

935
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:15,670
Maybe, but I'm glad you're here with me.

936
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,877
Didn't I tell you?

937
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:57,294
Just a matter of time now.

938
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:58,504
It's not over yet.

939
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,381
It might as well be.

940
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,883
Actually, how many drones has Rekker and his team

941
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,093
cost you though?

942
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:04,886
I prefer to think of it as

943
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,637
how many drone pilots just had the best training

944
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:07,847
money can buy?

945
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,462
We've gotta do something.

946
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,338
We can't fight them if we can't hurt them,

947
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:43,382
and even if we could, there are too many now.

948
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,551
They're too strong, too fast.

949
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:48,721
Too fast?

950
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,431
We can't even outrun them.

951
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,433
Even for a satellite, really there's no lag.

952
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:53,810
What?

953
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,728
Areal drones.

954
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,230
They can afford a second or two

955
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:58,815
of lag time in between commands.

956
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,858
Their targets don't change that quickly,

957
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,735
but when engaged in hand to hand combat...

958
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,862
Their pilot has to be nearby.

959
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,739
Yeah. We need to get to

960
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,616
the closest rooftop.

961
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,326
Why?

962
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,870
Because it's time to put an end to this thing.

963
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,581
Hey, how fast can you run?

964
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,708
Dammit!

965
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,102
They're catching up.

966
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,022
I have no idea.

967
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,148
Buy me some time.

968
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,520
This door isn't gonna hold!

969
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,563
I know!

970
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:03,564
I know.

971
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,535
You can't make that shot!

972
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,914
No one can make that shot.

973
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,082
Rekker! Rekker!

974
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:26,003
Rekker!

975
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:33,089
What's going on?

976
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:08,749
Rekker.

977
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:15,923
What happened?

978
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:17,841
Interrupted their signal.

979
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:19,676
Lights are on but no one's home.

980
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:21,720
So it's over?

981
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,515
Oh hell no.

982
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,601
I'm gonna have a little word with Kess,

983
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,186
and whoever else is with him.

984
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,948
No way.

985
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:42,825
What in the hell just happened?

986
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:43,909
He cut the feed.

987
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,202
Well get it back on.

988
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,870
I can't,

989
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,705
not without putting another dish up there.

990
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:49,957
I think it would be more prudent at this point

991
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,208
to cut our losses.

992
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,127
Are you suggesting we run?

993
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:54,462
Are you suggesting we stay and wait for him to find us?

994
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:55,963
I got a chopper waiting.

995
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:57,507
You might wanna continue this debate on it.

996
01:17:57,507 --> 01:17:59,467
He'll come after us.

997
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:01,469
Not if this entire complex is wired with enough C4

998
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:03,179
to blow it back on the map.

999
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,600
It won't detonate until we're safely out of range.

1000
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:10,686
But what about them?

1001
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:13,814
We train more.

1002
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,525
You're a cold blooded bastard.

1003
01:18:15,525 --> 01:18:17,568
Hey, feel free to give up your seat

1004
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,445
if it will make you feel better about yourself general.

1005
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,868
What the hell?

1006
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,286
Hurry up! Why's it so quiet?

1007
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,257
I don't know.

1008
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,386
You think it's a trick?

1009
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:46,556
Probably.

1010
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:50,643
Maybe...

1011
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:53,979
Maybe we should fall for it.

1012
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:57,107
It would be faster that way.

1013
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:00,152
Yeah.

1014
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,823
I'd rather die on my feet.

1015
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:07,159
Okay.

1016
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:45,281
You guys okay?

1017
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,451
Not really.

1018
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:49,660
You?

1019
01:19:52,747 --> 01:19:54,540
Oh yeah, bloody fantastic.

1020
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,167
What happened?

1021
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:59,002
Rekker, I think.

1022
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:00,755
I'll see what I can find for bandages.

1023
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:03,048
Okay.

1024
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,802
Find Rekker and make sure this nightmare is really over.

1025
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,638
I'll stay with her.

1026
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:10,306
Suit yourself.

1027
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,808
Probably lots of people to kill.

1028
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,644
I'll go with him.

1029
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,248
Rekker.

1030
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,085
General Callahan.

1031
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,545
I should've known your grubby little fingerprints

1032
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:43,088
were all over this.

1033
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,674
Where is Agent Hayes?

1034
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:46,717
Making sure no one fixes the data link

1035
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:49,386
to those little monstrosities you tried to feed us to.

1036
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,598
For the record, they don't actually eat.

1037
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:55,559
Just for the record, I don't actually give a damn.

1038
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:58,437
You know Rekker, that's what made you so good.

1039
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:00,648
Makes.

1040
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,066
That and the steady hand.

1041
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:04,276
Relax.

1042
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,195
I was surrendering.

1043
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:08,238
It's not hard to know which way the wind's blowing here.

1044
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:10,574
Or smell the subtle hint of bullshit that it's carrying.

1045
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,159
I didn't choose your team.

1046
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,786
But you didn't mind

1047
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,705
sending us to the slaughter, Mister Kess.

1048
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:18,874
Business is business, you know that as well as I do.

1049
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,376
Business is business.

1050
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,587
Ain't that right, general?

1051
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:27,842
This is the second time you've sent me and my men to die.

1052
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:31,220
And it won't be the last, not if I can help it.

1053
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,388
You can't!

1054
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,939
Well as much as I'd like to

1055
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:44,900
mourn the loss of a good general,

1056
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,110
it appears that he's taken your last bullet with him.

1057
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:49,488
True.

1058
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:55,994
But not my men.

1059
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:57,204
Not all of them.

1060
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:03,878
Grigori...

1061
01:22:03,878 --> 01:22:05,504
I know, fell?

1062
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,718
Looking to vent a little pent up aggression.

1063
01:22:10,718 --> 01:22:12,595
Excellent. So am I.

1064
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:14,304
Rekker, I think you and I

1065
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,890
can come to a more equitable agreement here.

1066
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17,558
You see, it's the negotiation process

1067
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:19,518
that I'm looking forward to Mister Kess.

1068
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,061
Suit yourself.

1069
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:23,980
That's the problem with you mercs,

1070
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,608
you're always so full of yourselves.

Damn!

1085
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:36,720
You still trying to surrender?

1086
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,388
It's an expensive gun.

1087
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:39,723
I don't wanna leave it just laying around.

1088
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:41,433
You know what I mean?

1089
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:45,354
You know what's more expensive?

1090
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,105
Life.

1091
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:50,901
If you kill me, you'll never stop Langley.

1092
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,069
You'll never stop Langley.

1093
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:54,154
You'll never stop--

1094
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:55,197
Talking?

1095
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:57,032
Oh wait, that's you.

1096
01:23:58,742 --> 01:23:59,910
Was you.

1097
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,085
How much?

1098
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:10,295
10 million.

1099
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,338
10 million?

1100
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:12,464
No way.

1101
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:14,008
Okay, you make it 20.

1102
01:24:14,008 --> 01:24:15,009
20 million dollars?

1103
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:16,218
U.S.

1104
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,013
You gonna let him live?

1105
01:24:19,013 --> 01:24:20,389
If the price is right.

1106
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,224
Even after he set us up?

1107
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:24,643
He never really promised to be on our side though,

1108
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:26,436
which is why I'm willing to give him a chance

1109
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:29,105
to buy his way out of it for 20 million dollars.

1110
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:31,149
Rekker, I don't have that kind of money.

1111
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,777
You couldn't have built a drone for a single penny less.

1112
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:35,362
It was a lot more than one.

1113
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:38,448
Yeah but, other people paid for that.

1114
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:41,201
Other people that are now laying around here dead.

1115
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:43,453
Think you can skim a little off the top Kess?

1116
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,873
Being that true patriot that you are.

1117
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,919
15 million.

1118
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:51,086
18.

1119
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,088
16?

1120
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,757
Okay, back to 20.

1121
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,301
But I'm buying my life,

1122
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:00,012
before and after you get paid.

1123
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:01,847
Only if you don't come back.

1124
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:06,852
Listen, I think I just wanna be a gun runner.

1125
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,228
Good idea.

1126
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:09,980
Hell of a world we live in.

1127
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,899
Top speed Rich,

1128
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,694
I'm keeping this.

1129
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:17,112
Hey but, my first wife gave me that.

1130
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,655
Come on, Rekker?

1131
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:44,681
You alive?

1132
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:50,062
You indestructible son of a bitch.

1133
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,105
You're alive?

1134
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:01,197
What did you save this time?

1135
01:26:01,197 --> 01:26:02,491
The planet.

1136
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:09,915
I need a drink.

1137
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:11,583
Me too big guy.

1138
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:12,751
Me too.

I figured I'd give everybody some space.

1150
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,468
Yeah, I hear you.

1151
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:53,936
So...

1152
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:56,312
What's next?

1153
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,149
I don't know.

1154
01:28:00,483 --> 01:28:02,652
Aside from trying to avoid prison?

1155
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,906
My life is over.

1156
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:11,995
You know, I used to think that once.

1157
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:14,581
Not anymore.

1158
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,960
What got you through it?

1159
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,674
This.

1160
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,136
The people.

1161
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,889
Not having to work for a chain in command anymore

1162
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:33,433
and just, waking up every morning,

1163
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:36,853
deciding for myself what's right and what's wrong.

1164
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:40,023
Just make me feel better about everything.

1165
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:43,777
I never even thought about that.

1166
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,324
Give it a shot.

1167
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:55,705
Is that an offer?

1168
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,716
Well I'd have to give that some thought captain.

1169
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:09,052
I was never really a captain.

1170
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:16,351
