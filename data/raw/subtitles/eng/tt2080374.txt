1
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,761
And with that movie
2001, you're projecting us

2
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,370
into the 21st century.

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,249
I brought along
my son, Jonathan,

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,041
who, in the year 2001, will
be the same age as I am now.

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,090
Maybe he will be better
adjusted to this kind of world

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,083
that you're trying to portray.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,924
The big
difference, when he grows up...

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,367
In fact, if we wanted to
wait until the year 2001,

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,086
is that he will have,
in his own house,

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,571
not a computer as big as this,

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,325
but at least a console

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,250
through which he can talk to
his friendly local computer

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,051
and get all the information he
needs for his everyday life,

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,243
like his bank statements,
his theater reservations,

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,051
all the information you need

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,726
in the course of living
in a complex modern society.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,930
This will be in a compact
form in his own house.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,570
He'll have a television screen,

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,250
like these here, and a keyboard,

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,448
and he'll talk to the computer,
and get information from it.

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,444
And he'll take it as much for
granted as we take the telephone.

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,806
I wonder, though,
what sort of a life

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,406
would it be like,
in social terms?

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,403
If our whole life is built
around the computer,

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,568
do we become
a computer-dependent society?

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,769
In some ways, but they will
also enrich our society

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,444
because it will
make it possible for us

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,329
to live, really,
anywhere we like.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,281
Any businessman and executive could
live almost anywhere on Earth

30
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,761
and still do his business
through a device like this.

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,367
And this is a wonderful thing, it means
we won't have to be stuck in cities.

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,603
We'll be able to live out in the
country, or wherever we please.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,004
Screen says
it's an unimplemented trap,

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,481
but the error code is wrong,
it's a system error.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,807
- So what's the upshot?
- It's not gonna say, "Hello."

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,166
It absolutely is
gonna say "Hello."

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,605
It's nobody's fault, it's a system error.

38
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,681
You built the voice demo.

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,046
- The voice demo is flaky...
- Keep your voices down.

40
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,361
I've been telling you that for...
This thing is overbuilt.

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,811
It worked last night.

42
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,167
It worked the night before that.
It worked three hours ago.

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,481
It's not working now, so just
skip over the voice demo.

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,608
- Fuck you.
- Everything else is working.

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,886
Skip over the voice demo.

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,883
We need it to say, "Hello."

47
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,849
You're not hearing me, it's
not going to say, "Hello."

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,331
Just fix it.

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,606
- Fix it?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,566
- In 40 minutes?
- Fix it.

51
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,170
- I can't.
- Who's the person who can?

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,686
I'm the person who can,
and I can't.

53
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,524
- How bad are you saying?
- It's pretty bad.

54
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,806
I don't know what that means.

55
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,962
It means the demo is more
than likely gonna crash.

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,610
You have to keep
your voices down,

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,165
Joel Pforzheimer is
sitting out in the house.

58
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,526
I don't care if...

59
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,244
Who's Joel Pforzheimer?

60
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,120
GQ. He's been shadowing you
for a week, did you notice?

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,168
Just look like
everything's fine,

62
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,605
he's sitting out in the house.

63
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,881
Hey.

64
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,323
What are you guys saying?

65
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,207
Some kind of race condition, but we
haven't been able to track it down yet.

66
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,884
Is the synthesizer
sampling fast enough?

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,611
No, so the rates are
off, and it keeps crashing.

68
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,650
It's 20 seconds out of a
two-hour launch, why not just cut it?

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,290
- We can't cut it.
- Yeah, you just cut it.

70
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,249
Two days ago,
we ran a Super Bowl ad

71
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,288
that could've won the Oscar
for Best Short Film.

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,203
There are more people
who can tell you about the ad

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,441
than can tell you
who won the game.

74
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,330
I understand, but the ad said the
Mac was gonna save the world.

75
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,721
It didn't say it was
gonna say, "Hello."

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,325
We open the house in five.

77
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,686
Don't open the house.

78
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,291
We're taking a quick break.

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,761
Part of the problem is, we
can recompile... What?

80
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,969
...but if it's a hardware problem
, we can't get into the back.

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,530
Why not?

82
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,011
Do you wanna tell her,
or should I?

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,366
Don't start with me, man.

84
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,680
Why can't he get
into the machine?

85
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,250
You need special tools.

86
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,561
What kind of special tools?
Just take a screwdriver.

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,529
He didn't want users
to be able to open it.

88
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,329
You need special tools.

89
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,081
Is this for real?

90
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,050
There are 100 engineers walking around
here. None of them have the tools?

91
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,441
In fairness, not many
of them were issued the tools.

92
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,760
What about you?

93
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,047
I left them at the office,
it was 3:00 a.m. when I...

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,203
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Cut "Hello." No!

95
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,566
What's the first
rule of a launch?

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,761
It's not gonna crash.

97
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,046
It just did.

98
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,561
Andy!

99
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,927
Which one?

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,923
The other Andy. You're right
there, why would I be calling out?

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,081
He needs to talk to you.

102
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,127
Yeah.

103
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,611
The exit signs need to be off,

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,681
or we're not gonna
get a full blackout.

105
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,250
We've spoken
to the building manager

106
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,805
- and the fire marshal.
- And?

107
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,531
There's absolutely no way they're
gonna let us turn the exit signs off.

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,090
I'll pay whatever the fine is.

109
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,282
The fine is, they're gonna come
in and tell everyone to leave.

110
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,600
You explained to
the fire marshal

111
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,761
that we're in here
changing the world?

112
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,649
I did, but unless we can
also change

113
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,085
the properties of fire,
he doesn't care.

114
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,127
Steve...

115
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,248
If a fire causes a stampede
to the unmarked exits,

116
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,561
it'll have been well worth it
for those who survive.

117
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,291
For those who don't, less so,
but still pretty good.

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,408
Look, I... I need it to go black.
Real black.

119
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,563
Get rid of the exit signs and
don't let me know how you did it.

120
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,489
Fix the voice demo.

121
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,882
You need special
tools to open the Mac?

122
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,325
You knew it was a closed system.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,526
- I didn't know literally.
- Jesus.

124
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,921
And if you keep alienating
people for no reason,

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,321
there's gonna be no one left
for it to say "Hello" to.

126
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,686
It's not for no reason.

127
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,401
We blow this, and IBM will own the
next 50 years like a Batman villain.

128
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,481
Remember the phone company?

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,688
That's what Bell was called,
"the phone company."

130
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,524
IBM will be
the computer company.

131
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,365
Ten years later, they'll be
the information company,

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,761
and that's very bad
for the human race.

133
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,611
So we don't have time
to be polite or realistic,

134
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,160
because if we are, this
company's next product launch

135
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,810
will be held
in front of 26 people

136
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,406
and a stringer from the Alameda
County Shoppers' Guide.

137
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,608
We haven't advertised
the voice software.

138
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,569
We could pull it
out of the demo,

139
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,569
and no one would
be disappointed.

140
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,122
Do you want to try being
reasonable, just, you know,

141
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,450
see what it feels like?

142
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,404
Okay. Pull the voice demo.

143
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,967
Thank you.

144
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,644
And then cancel the launch.

145
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,687
I see.

146
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,841
You just tricked me a little.

147
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,251
You can tell me
how unimportant it is,

148
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,004
but if the computer
doesn't say, "Hello,"

149
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,770
then neither will John Sculley,

150
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,808
who, I promise you,
agrees with me.

151
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,527
Sculley's not gonna cancel the
launch because he's not insane.

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,681
He's also not a hack,

153
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,881
and when it comes
to the Macintosh,

154
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,371
he's gonna do
what I ask him to do.

155
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,566
What's in this box?

156
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,286
Nothing you need to worry
about, don't even open it.

157
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,885
What the fuck?

158
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,323
Why is there a carton of...
Who did this?

159
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,887
- Somebody thought...
- Who?

160
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,927
Doesn't matter.

161
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,525
Thought it would be a good idea

162
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,887
to have copies
of that Time cover

163
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,121
available at everyone's seat.

164
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,043
It was nipped in the bud,
and all the copies

165
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,167
are being taken
out of the building,

166
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,691
so, problem solved.

167
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,205
This isn't a Macintosh.

168
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,361
I understand.

169
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,283
Somebody thought it
would be a good idea

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,364
to, like, enthusiastically
hand over copies of Time

171
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,283
with a not-a-Macintosh
on the cover

172
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,169
at the launch of the Macintosh?

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,083
What are they handing out
at Hewlett-Packard?

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,685
A bushel of apples
with my face on them?

175
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,683
- I'm sure the thinking was...
- Yeah?

176
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,768
...that since the computer
is Man of the Year

177
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,921
that that's good
for our business,

178
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,526
but like I said, I'm having
them removed from the building.

179
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,880
What I'd like you
to do with them

180
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,803
is to take them,
all 2,600 copies,

181
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,644
and stack them on Kottke's desk,

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,768
and tell him Steve says,
"Happy New Year to you ."

183
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,841
Okay.

184
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,764
I gave Time magazine full
access, the whole campus.

185
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,969
Bandley, Apple II, Lisa. I
gave him Sculley, Markkula.

186
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,168
I gave him Woz,
I gave him everybody.

187
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,925
What should I call
the person who thought

188
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,445
it would be a good idea
to hand these out?

189
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,648
I'm not telling you who it was.

190
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,291
It was done without malice,
it's been taken care of.

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,886
You have a half hour, and we
have things to talk about.

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,126
Like what?

193
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,407
Like a million
in the first 90 days.

194
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,010
Joanna... 20,000
a month after that.

195
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,684
Look. Those are the forecasts.
I'm begging you.

196
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,484
Because this is my field,

197
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,962
I'm begging you to manage
expectations out there.

198
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,121
I'm fanning expectations.

199
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,568
We're not gonna sell a million
in the first 90 days.

200
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,087
Everyone, everyone, everyone.

201
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,004
Everyone is waiting for the Mac.

202
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,641
Maybe.

203
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,610
But what happens when they
find out that for $2,495,

204
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,762
there's nothing
you can do with it?

205
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,320
We were competitive at $1,500,

206
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,121
but once you replaced the
Motorola 6809 with the 68000...

207
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,248
Which is what
supports menus, windows,

208
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,606
point and click,
high-res graphics...

209
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,048
Yeah, because everyone needs
rectangles with rounded corners.

210
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,321
Coach lands on the runway at the
exact same time as first class.

211
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,163
I don't have the first fucking
idea what that means,

212
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,322
but this is how
it got to $2,500,

213
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,085
which is the price point on the
PC, which can do a lot more!

214
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,571
Who's gonna want a PC?

215
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,961
What idiot is gonna want...

216
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,849
If I wanna tell you
there's a spot

217
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,649
on your shirt,
I point to the spot.

218
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,564
I don't say there's a spot 14
centimeters down from the collar

219
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,404
and three centimeters to the
right of the second button,

220
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,484
while I try to remember what
the command is for club soda.

221
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,528
That's not how
a person's mind works.

222
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,446
If the goal was ease of use, maybe
you should've given it some memory.

223
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,244
You can complain about memory,
or you can complain about price,

224
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,164
but you can't do both
at the same time.

225
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,322
Memory is what costs money.

226
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,846
And I'm glad you're telling me
your feelings about the Mac now

227
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,365
because we have
a half hour left.

228
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,010
We can redesign it.

229
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,401
I'm just asking you
to manage expectations.

230
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,721
Look at their faces
when they see what it is.

231
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,126
They won't know what they're
looking at or why they like it,

232
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,440
but they'll know they want it.

233
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,931
Not instantly.

234
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,002
When people heard
Rite of Spring,

235
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,088
they tore the chairs
out of the theater,

236
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,525
they didn't buy the record.

237
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,409
Rite of Spring happens to be

238
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,687
the most revolutionary and provocative
symphony of the last century.

239
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,569
- Ballet.
- It was a ballet.

240
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,043
But Igor Stravinsky didn't say he was
gonna sell 20,000 units a month.

241
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,122
I don't know why we're
talking about Stravinsky,

242
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,806
when what I care about
is Dan Kottke

243
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,922
sodomizing me in Time magazine.

244
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,128
Look. Obviously...

245
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,923
Let me say this.

246
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,004
Obviously, Daniel didn't think
he was doing anything wrong.

247
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,809
By talking to Time about it?

248
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,881
Yeah.

249
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,765
I don't know what that means.

250
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,601
You said, when you told me the story.
. . You said, you said to Dan,

251
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,445
"Did Time magazine ask you if
I had a daughter named Lisa?"

252
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,851
And Dan said, "Yeah."

253
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,762
My point was that he answered
you simply and honestly

254
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,127
because he didn't think
he'd done anything wrong.

255
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,726
Except, Joanna, except,

256
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,087
I don't have
a daughter named Lisa.

257
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,767
And this story is now about how I'm
denying paternity and took a blood test.

258
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,405
And that's why
there's a picture of...

259
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,045
I don't know what
the fuck that is.

260
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,481
That's why there's a picture
of a PC on the cover

261
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,530
instead of a picture of me
and the Mac.

262
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,567
I don't know what to tell you.

263
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,450
I was supposed to be Time
magazine's Man of the Year.

264
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,368
And then Dan Kottke was born.

265
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,801
Well...

266
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,847
What?

267
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,649
She's waiting for you.

268
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,801
Who?

269
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,330
Chrisann.

270
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,481
Brennan?

271
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,561
They're out in the hall.

272
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,801
They've been sitting in the back

273
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,689
of the auditorium
since 7:00 this morning.

274
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,366
I'm not having a session
with Chrisann right now.

275
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,727
We issued 335 press
credentials for the launch.

276
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,605
Steve, you piss off Chrisann,

277
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,048
she's gonna stand in the lobby
and give 335 interviews,

278
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,682
and you, pal, will be longing for
the halcyon days of Dan Kottke.

279
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,850
Let me get this over with.

280
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,241
But don't leave.
You're gonna stay here.

281
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,010
What? No, I'm not.

282
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,650
No. There's less of
a chance of a scene

283
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,330
if you stay here,
she'll be cool.

284
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,881
I find all this excruciatingly
personal and...

285
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,720
I'm not staying.

286
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,321
Come on.

287
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,928
I don't wanna be in a room
alone with Chrisann.

288
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,805
This is me and you.

289
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,361
Fine.

290
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,641
Hey.

291
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,641
Steve.

292
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,210
This is a surprise.

293
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,051
Why don't you come on in?

294
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,646
Thank you.

295
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,841
You coming too?

296
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,365
Yes, I'm not gonna
leave her in the hallway.

297
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,488
Okay. It's a safe hallway,
but anyway.

298
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,771
You remember Joanna Hoffman? She's
the head of marketing for the Mac.

299
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,841
Good to see you.

300
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,331
Nice to see you.

301
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,561
Hello, Lisa.

302
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,564
We've met before, and you told
me you like the way I talk,

303
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,530
and that was my favorite thing
anyone's ever said to me.

304
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,086
You're from Poland.

305
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,208
Yes, I am. Do you
know where that is?

306
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,881
The top of the Earth.

307
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,844
I think you're thinking
of the North Pole.

308
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,922
Well, we're a little
pressed for time, so...

309
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,206
I'll leave you guys alone.

310
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,770
Why do you wanna leave
when you just said...

311
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,205
I'm gonna check in
with Hertzfeld.

312
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,321
We're trying to get
a computer to say "Hello,"

313
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,727
but right now
it's being very shy.

314
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,848
Would you come help me?
Is that okay?

315
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,327
Sure.

316
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,606
Thank you.

317
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,803
My dad named
a computer after me.

318
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,251
I'm not your...

319
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,721
Actually, do you know
what a coincidence is, Lisa?

320
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,006
No.

321
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,930
Like if you met someone.

322
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,282
You made a new friend
and her name was Lisa, too.

323
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,044
That would be a coincidence.

324
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,483
"Lisa" stands for "local
integrated systems architecture."

325
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,050
L-I-S-A.

326
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,085
It's a coincidence.

327
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,721
You about done?

328
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,609
- Yeah.
- Okay.

329
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,321
Come.

330
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,331
Let's make that
computer say "Hi."

331
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,809
Go ahead, Lisa.

332
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,168
So it was the other way around.

333
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,330
I was named after the computer?

334
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,802
Nothing was named after anybody.
It's a coincidence.

335
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,201
Come on.

336
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,121
What's the matter with you?

337
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,202
What's the matter with you? Why
are you telling her these things?

338
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,169
Why are you still telling
her I'm her father?

339
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,203
A judge told her you're her father.
No, he didn't.

340
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,361
And where the hell
do you get off

341
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,091
telling Time magazine I've slept
with 28% of the men in America?

342
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,924
That's not...
Where do you get off?

343
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,606
That's not remotely what I said.

344
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,885
It's right here.

345
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,002
First of all, can I tell you
something about Time magazine?

346
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,811
I believe it's a training
facility for paid assassins.

347
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,049
"Jobs insists," I am quoting...

348
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,201
I didn't invent math.

349
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,604
"28% of the male population of the
United States could be the father."

350
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,450
I wasn't saying you've slept
with 28% of American men.

351
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,364
I was using an algorithm
based on the blood test,

352
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,001
which said there was a 94.1%
chance that I'm the father.

353
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,846
You're trying to publicly paint
me as a slut and a whore.

354
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,048
Believe me, I'm not trying to
publicly do anything with you.

355
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,600
Two million people read Time.
How am I supposed...

356
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,045
It would be more if they'd
put me on the cover,

357
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,690
but Dan Kottke decided
to kidney-punch me.

358
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,842
I applied for welfare yesterday.

359
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,280
- I'm sorry?
- Hello!

360
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,249
I said I applied
for welfare yesterday.

361
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,680
The Time article said your Apple
stock was worth $441 million.

362
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,568
And I wanted to ask you
how you felt about that.

363
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,723
Well, I feel like Apple stock has
been dramatically undervalued.

364
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,365
This would be
a good time to get in.

365
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,048
Your daughter and her mother...

366
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,328
- Chrisann.
- ...are on welfare.

367
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,006
We're living in
a hovel in Menlo Park.

368
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,445
We can't pay the heating bills.

369
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,564
She sleeps in a parka.
Your daughter...

370
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,404
She's not my daughter!

371
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,404
Because, as reported
by Time magazine,

372
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,687
I've slept with 28%
of the men in America?

373
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,761
- No.
- All of them,

374
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,571
exactly nine months
before Lisa was born!

375
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,169
I've got Andy here.

376
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,131
Excuse me.

377
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,321
We're there?

378
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,526
Hey, Chris.

379
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,886
- Hey, Andy.
- How are you doin'?

380
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,121
Terrible.

381
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,281
You guys caught up now?

382
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,966
Excuse me for saying hello to my
friend who thinks you're a dick.

383
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,371
I don't think you're a...
We're there?

384
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,488
No. It's got a one-in-six
chance of working.

385
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,561
God damn it.

386
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,804
We're not a pit crew at Daytona.

387
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,326
This can't be fixed in seconds.

388
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,006
You didn't have seconds,
you had three weeks.

389
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,203
The universe was created
in a third of that time.

390
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,601
Well, someday you'll have to
tell us how you did it.

391
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,410
Here's what I'm gonna do.

392
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,802
I'm gonna announce the names of
everyone who designed the launch demo.

393
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,491
I'm gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up.

394
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,722
The bag was designed
by Susan Kare.

395
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,962
The Macintosh font that's
scrolling across the screen

396
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,690
was designed by Steve Capps.

397
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,843
The starry night and
skywriting was Bruce Horn.

398
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,720
MacPaint, MacWrite, Alice...

399
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,529
Down to the calculator.

400
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,649
And then I'm gonna say, the
voice demo that didn't work

401
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,961
was designed by Andy Hertzfeld.

402
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,249
Steve...
Five in six is your chance

403
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,209
of surviving the first round
of Russian roulette,

404
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,044
and you've reversed those odds.

405
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,485
So unless you wanna be disgraced

406
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,846
in front of
your friends, family,

407
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,605
colleagues, stockholders,
and the press,

408
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,370
I wouldn't stand here arguing.

409
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,807
I'd go try and get some more
bullets out of the gun.

410
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,325
Do it, Andy!

411
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,327
Stop. You.

412
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,003
What size shirt do you wear? Me?

413
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,411
Does anyone know
what size shirt he wears?

414
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,686
Does anyone know
what size shirt I wear?

415
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,683
Does anyone know where
the closest psychiatrist is?

416
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,762
The disk fits in your pocket.

417
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,246
I need a shirt with a breast
pocket, I can take it out onstage.

418
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,765
- A shirt?
- The disk!

419
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,730
I need a white shirt in my
size with a breast pocket.

420
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,963
Yes. Which one of the no
stores that are open at 8:45

421
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,522
do you want me to have someone run
to and return from in 15 minutes?

422
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,446
Go out in the lobby, find someone my
size who's wearing a white shirt,

423
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,568
tell them I'll trade them
for a free computer,

424
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,444
and they get to keep my shirt.

425
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,921
Does it have to be a white shirt?
Is blue okay?

426
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,082
- No. The Mac is beige,
- I'm beige,

427
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,561
the disk is blue,
the shirt has to be white.

428
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,641
Andy?

429
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,640
Hello, I'm Macintosh.

430
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,371
Bring me the head
of Andy Hertzfeld.

431
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,851
I tried to get it to say,
"Hello," but it's shy.

432
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,445
Yeah.

433
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,170
So that's it?

434
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,480
That's it.

435
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,961
I don't get it.

436
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,610
I know.

437
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,409
What are people
going to do with it?

438
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,126
Lisa, how old are you now?

439
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,964
You know how old she is.
How old are you, Lisa?

440
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,565
Five.

441
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,008
Come sit here for a minute.

442
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,163
Do you know what this is?

443
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,289
It's a computer.

444
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,089
Can I borrow
your hand for a second?

445
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,441
Point that arrow and click.

446
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,809
You don't have to, but if you
want, you can play with it.

447
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,086
Nothing you can do
will break it,

448
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,321
so just do
whatever you want with it.

449
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,401
What are you doing?

450
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,642
I'm paying you exactly what the
court ordered me to pay you.

451
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,485
$385 a month.

452
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,648
I'm not the one who
decided on that amount.

453
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,688
And I'm asking you how you feel.

454
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,966
If you feel all right.

455
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,441
If it feels all right to
you that your daughter...

456
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,329
She's not my...
That your daughter

457
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,209
and her mother are on welfare

458
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,046
while you're worth $441
million for making that.

459
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,329
I'm proud to say Apple donates
computers to underfunded schools,

460
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,686
and we'll be doing more of
the same with the Mac...

461
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,761
What?

462
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,690
Apple donates millions of dollars'
worth of computers to schools.

463
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,688
What does that
have to do with...

464
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,567
Imagine an underprivileged kid that has
their favorite teacher with them 24 hours.

465
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,364
We're minutes away
from being able to do that.

466
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,091
In your head, was that
an answer to my question?

467
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,764
Tell me the question again.

468
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,087
I wasn't the one who sued
you for child support.

469
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,969
No, let...
San Mateo County sued you.

470
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,403
No, let me explain
what happened,

471
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,720
because I have
plenty of time right now.

472
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,843
- Excuse me.
- You have a visitor.

473
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,366
Just wanted to say good luck!
Hey, Chrisann.

474
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,407
Hello, Woz.

475
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,481
Hang on.

476
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,287
Just wanted to say good luck.

477
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,407
Thanks. You, too.

478
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,720
- It's a big morning.
- Yeah.

479
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,404
You should see
this crowd out there.

480
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,448
This crowd, it's like, um...

481
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,250
I can't really wait for you to
come up with a metaphor, man.

482
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,926
Yeah. So, uh, listen, I
want to ask you a favor. Yeah?

483
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,287
Can you acknowledge the Apple II
team in your remarks?

484
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,361
I cannot.

485
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,091
Just an acknowledgment.
Have them stand up.

486
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,481
We're launching the Mac.

487
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,130
It'd be a morale booster,
just a mention

488
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,361
so they could get
a round of applause.

489
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,566
- Woz...
- Just a mention.

490
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,721
Can we stick a pin
in this for a minute?

491
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,086
- Sure, yep.
- Thank you.

492
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,367
Just talking about an
acknowledgment for the team.

493
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,920
I've got Chrisann in there.
I'll see you in just a second.

494
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,206
Yep.

495
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,841
That.

496
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,607
What?

497
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,610
You asked me what
people are gonna do with it.

498
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,681
They're gonna do that.

499
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,803
One of the engineers.

500
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,245
Thank you.

501
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,366
Do you like it?

502
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,006
I'm sorry?

503
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,889
It's an abstract.

504
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,563
You used MacPaint.

505
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,125
Push that key and the "S"
at the same time.

506
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,405
Now type your name.

507
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,965
Do you know
which box says "Save"?

508
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,206
Right. Go ahead and click on it.

509
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,364
I'll put some money
in your account.

510
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,727
And buy you a new house,
someplace near a decent school.

511
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,244
Thank you.

512
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,642
Woz wants a minute.

513
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,011
And Sculley's asking for you.

514
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,127
We're done?

515
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,088
Could you teach me more things?

516
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,286
On the computer?

517
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,964
Lisa, wait for me
in the hall, please.

518
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,489
You can put your coat on
in the hall.

519
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,481
Bye, Lisa.

520
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,007
Bye.

521
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,650
Lisa, in the hall. Now.

522
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,446
I just wanna know, when you say

523
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,601
you're gonna put
money in my account,

524
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,841
how much we're talking about.

525
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,604
It's a school day.
She needs to be in school.

526
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,209
I'm gonna give you
whatever you need.

527
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,325
Woz wants me to acknowledge
the Apple II team.

528
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,047
You must be able to see
that she looks like you.

529
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,281
I don't want to insult Woz.

530
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,966
I just think it's backward-looking
at exactly the wrong moment.

531
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,566
I know you heard what I said.

532
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,244
I heard what you said, Joanna.

533
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,163
It's just, we're about to
do this thing.

534
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,208
At 9:41, the planet's gonna shift
on its axis, nigh and forever.

535
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,287
Two most significant events
of the 20th century.

536
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,840
The Allies win the War,
and this.

537
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,521
This.

538
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,922
So maybe right now isn't the
very best time to scold me

539
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,089
for not being a better father
to a kid who's not my kid.

540
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,282
The test said I... I don't
care what the test said.

541
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,285
I don't care about 94.1%, or
the insane algorithm you used

542
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,441
to get to 28% of American men.

543
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,601
I'm buying her a new house.

544
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,761
I'm giving her money.

545
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,081
There's a small girl who
believes you're her father.

546
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,201
That's all . That's all
the math there is.

547
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,681
She believes it. What are
you gonna do about that?

548
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,811
God sent his only son
on a suicide mission,

549
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,451
but we like him anyway
because he made trees.

550
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,564
We're gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days,

551
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,802
20,000 a month after that.

552
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,689
So maybe you could give me
a break, Ms. Hoffman?

553
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,321
Woz.

554
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,367
Hey.

555
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,681
There's nothing in that vending
machine that won't kill you.

556
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,767
Just browsing.

557
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,921
Let's take a walk.

558
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,161
Can I tell you something?

559
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,363
Yeah. After the
meeting in Maui,

560
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,250
the Apple II team was upset and angry
and down, and do you know why?

561
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,049
Because the Apple II
wasn't mentioned even once?

562
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,327
The Apple II wasn't mentioned...

563
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,050
Yes, that's it.
You have it, yes.

564
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,326
That wasn't an oversight.

565
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,602
They know that.
They know it wasn't.

566
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,523
Look, I don't wanna make
a big deal out of this...

567
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,045
That's entirely
within your power.

568
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,281
The Apple II is...

569
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,885
The Apple II is
what was, my friend.

570
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,043
The Apple II is what pays the bills
around here and has for seven years.

571
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,525
And if you
embarrass these people,

572
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,967
you are going to see a brain drain
at this company, my brother.

573
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,490
Markkula took you off the Lisa,

574
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,244
not them and not me,
so don't blame...

575
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,129
Markkula took me off the Lisa
because of his strong religious

576
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,049
objection to making it good.

577
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,964
Now, I gave you everything
you wanted on the Apple II.

578
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,761
You don't ask for a lot? There
wasn't a single fight you lost.

579
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,080
Do you concede the slots
are the reason

580
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,241
for the success of the Apple II?

581
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,651
We can't possibly still be
talking about the slots.

582
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,721
I have a point.

583
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,569
It's been seven years. The eight
slots on the Apple II...

584
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,085
You're still doing it, you're
talking about the slots.

585
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,241
There's something
wrong with you.

586
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,845
This argument
started in the garage.

587
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,371
What are you talking about? Why
would you only want two slots?

588
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,408
A printer and a modem.

589
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,209
With eight slots, you...

590
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,124
This is a huge deal that we
were able to add eight slots.

591
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,010
I appreciate the engineering,
but it's not what we're doing.

592
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,929
- And thank God I won that argument.
- Woz.

593
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,407
...because the open system is what
people love about the machine,

594
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,209
and it's why it sold
and still sells.

595
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,362
An open system. We're not
doing an open system.

596
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,601
Of course we are.

597
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,524
That's what people want, and the
breakthrough on the Apple II...

598
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,603
People don't know what they want
until you show it to them.

599
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,251
Serious users want to customize,

600
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,288
they wanna modify,
they wanna jack it up.

601
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,805
They want hardware
engineers like me

602
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,644
to expand its capabilities,
okay?

603
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,922
Keyboards for music,
better sound board,

604
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,650
better display boards,
improved memory cards.

605
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,121
And it's why there are
3,000 people here right now.

606
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,050
The slots are what allowed
the Apple II to run,

607
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,407
for just one example, VisiCalc,
which, from my guess,

608
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,167
single-handedly sold between
200,000 and 300,000 machines.

609
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,526
They want slots.

610
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,170
They don't get a vote.

611
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,526
When Dylan wrote
Shelter from the Storm,

612
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,090
he didn't ask people
to contribute to the lyrics.

613
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,528
Plays don't stop so the
playwright can ask the audience

614
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,965
what scene they'd like
to see next.

615
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,560
Painters... We're on the verge of
a tectonic... Hobbyists are...

616
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,563
Hobbyists?

617
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,244
A printer and a modem,
two slots.

618
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,763
The Apple II team
has my affection,

619
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,003
but I'm not loving up a 7-year-old
product at the Mac launch.

620
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,570
Computers aren't paintings.

621
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,609
Fuck you.

622
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,808
I'm gonna say "fuck you"
every time you say that

623
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,325
until you either die or stop.

624
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,680
- Steve...
- Try it.

625
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,841
- Steve.
- Say it.

626
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,685
Computers aren't paintings.
Fuck you.

627
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,764
Yes, they are, and what I
want is a closed system.

628
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,001
End-to-end control.

629
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,526
Completely incompatible
with anything.

630
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,400
Computers aren't supposed
to have human flaws.

631
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,961
I'm not going to build
this one with yours.

632
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,801
Steve!

633
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,681
Hey.

634
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,450
Today is about the Macintosh.

635
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,205
And the Mac is mine.

636
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,281
I give you that.

637
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,606
- Thank you.
- I give you that.

638
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,444
Just publicly acknowledge
the Apple II team

639
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,965
because it's
the right thing to do.

640
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,488
We'll know soon enough if you are
Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are,

641
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,244
but in the meantime,
it would be great...

642
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,766
In the meantime,
the Apple II is done.

643
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,002
Seven years. 
It was a great run.

644
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,929
You should go out in the
house and take your seat.

645
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,165
The Mac is Jef Raskin's.

646
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,969
Say it for me.

647
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,246
- Computers aren't...
- Fuck you.

648
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,321
All right.

649
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,804
- We're there?
- I need more time.

650
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,041
You can't have it.

651
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,770
- Twenty minutes.
- It's 8:58.

652
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,251
We can start late.

653
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,005
Hear me. We're a computer company.
We can't start late.

654
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,010
- Then I have another idea.
- What?

655
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,766
It's deceptive and
borderline unethical.

656
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,729
I'm listening.
It'll run on the 512.

657
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,040
- You tested it?
- Yeah.

658
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,086
Wait.

659
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,521
You're gonna demo
a 128 computer on a 512?

660
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,647
Nobody's gonna know.

661
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,768
And you think that's
"borderline" unethical?

662
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,649
Name my other choices, please.

663
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,526
Please, you have to tell me why it's
so important for it to say "Hello."

664
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,446
Hollywood, they made
computers scary things.

665
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,204
See how this reminds you
of a friendly face?

666
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,170
That the disk slot
is a goofy grin?

667
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,770
It's warm and it's playful,
and it needs to say "Hello."

668
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,321
It needs to say "Hello"
because it can.

669
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,010
We're not committing fraud.

670
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,323
The 512 is gonna ship
in under a year.

671
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,171
Will you absolve me of your
Eastern European disapproval?

672
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,686
The computer in 2001
said "Hello" all the time,

673
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,489
and it still scared
the shit out of me.

674
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,925
Absolve me.

675
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,885
Just for this.

676
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,331
And just for now.

677
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,801
Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

678
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,287
founding board member,
Mike Markkula.

679
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,080
All right. Okay.

680
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,042
Go make a dent
in the universe, Steven.

681
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,364
See you in a couple of hours.

682
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,285
And I'm going to take us
through the formal part of the meeting.

683
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,601
The legal part, if you will.

684
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,445
Thank merciful God.
The cavalry's shown up.

685
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,842
Because I hear you've been
worse than usual this morning.

686
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,160
I didn't think
that was possible,

687
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,961
so I've been dispatched
as the "Steve Whisperer."

688
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,407
This is a '55 Margaux.

689
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,561
It's 9:00 in the morning.

690
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,120
This is a '55 Margaux.

691
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,205
Is it my imagination, or have
you started to dress like me?

692
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,610
It was a bad idea to have Markkula
open with quarterly reports.

693
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,648
Instead we should have just
dropped water on the audience.

694
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,486
Just big 10,000-gallon tanks of cold
water, dropped from the ceiling.

695
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,244
Save Mike some money
on index cards.

696
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,566
Oh, just relax.

697
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,801
Why?

698
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,645
I don't know. No one's ever
asked me that question.

699
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,811
There you go.

700
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,251
You're the only one who sees
the world the same way I do.

701
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,482
No one sees the world
the same way you do.

702
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,050
I'm like Julius Caesar, John.

703
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,321
I'm surrounded by enemies.

704
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,561
No, you're not.

705
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,846
The board...

706
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,843
Oh, "The board ."
The board's behind you.

707
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,410
Only because you see
to it they are.

708
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,801
Oh, I think it's a good board,

709
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,405
but if you want me to
push them out one by one,

710
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,925
we can talk about that.

711
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,968
I want you to
push them out all at once

712
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,850
through a window,
if it's the nearest exit.

713
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,763
The look on their faces
when we showed them the spot.

714
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,844
I couldn't see their faces, because they
were banging their heads on the table.

715
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,404
Yesterday, the day after
it airs once,

716
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,450
the publisher of Adweek calls it
the best commercial of all time.

717
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,646
Of all time!

718
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,801
And it is.

719
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,961
And if anyone does one better,

720
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,651
it's gonna be Chiat/Day, who
the board wanted to replace,

721
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,200
and it's gonna be Lee Clow, who the
board thought was out of his mind.

722
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,681
Ladies and gentlemen, 1984.

723
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,527
We have created,
for the first time in all history,

724
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,371
a garden of pure ideology

725
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,605
where each worker may bloom
secure from the pests

726
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,570
of any contradictory
true thoughts.

727
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,563
Our unification of thoughts

728
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,885
is more powerful a weapon than
any fleet or army on Earth.

729
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,121
We are one people...

730
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,004
Did we use skinheads as extras?

731
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,411
A couple of people
have told me that.

732
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,481
Yeah.

733
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,801
We paid skinheads? I've got
skinheads on my payroll?

734
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,325
They had a look you wanted.

735
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,731
- The skinheads?
- Yeah.

736
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,083
Okay, let's keep
that to ourselves.

737
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,561
We shall prevail!

738
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,241
On January 24th,

739
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,768
Apple Computer will
introduce Macintosh.

740
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,128
Who else knows?
Who else knows what?

741
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,647
That we paid terrorists
to be in our TV commercial.

742
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,404
John.
They were wrong about the ad,

743
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,125
but they're a good board.
Good people.

744
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,682
Their only problem... Their
problem is that they're people.

745
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,000
People.

746
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,924
The very nature of people
is something to be overcome.

747
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,761
When I was running Pepsi,

748
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,003
we had a lot of success
focusing on 18-to 55-year-olds

749
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,969
who weren't members
of violent hate groups.

750
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,162
I get it. You're not
surrounded by enemies.

751
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,444
We're almost there.

752
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,251
I'm back and forth on the Dylan.

753
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,606
I might quote a different verse.

754
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,921
What are the choices?

755
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,288
"For the loser now will be later
to win," which is what we have.

756
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,851
Or?

757
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,287
"Come mothers and fathers
throughout the land,

758
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,124
"and don't criticize
what you can't understand.

759
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,725
"Your sons
and your daughters..."

760
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,961
"...are beyond your command ."

761
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,650
I just lost a hundred bucks
to Andy Hertzfeld.

762
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,210
He said you'd change it
to that verse.

763
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,124
We got 45 seconds. I want to
use it to ask you a question.

764
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,282
Why do people who are adopted

765
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,681
feel like they were rejected
instead of selected?

766
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,411
That came out of nowhere.

767
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,323
"Your sons and your daughters
are beyond your command.

768
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,369
"Your old road
is rapidly aging."

769
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,126
So go fuck yourself, because
my name is Steve Jobs,

770
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,805
and "the times
they are a-changing ."

771
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,930
I don't feel rejected.

772
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,923
- You're sure?
- Very sure.

773
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,606
Because it's not like the baby is
born and the parents look and say,

774
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,286
"Nah, we're not interested
in this one."

775
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,010
On the other hand,
someone did choose you.

776
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,484
It's having no control.

777
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,606
You find out
you were out of the loop

778
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,445
when the most crucial events in
your life were set in motion.

779
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,683
As long as you have control.

780
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,649
I don't understand people
who give it up.

781
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,445
What inspired Hertzfeld
to make that bet?

782
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,721
He was warning me

783
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,123
that being your father figure
could be dangerous.

784
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,450
Keep your 100 bucks.

785
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,521
I'm sticking with
the first verse.

786
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,681
Good.

787
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,689
What the hell does he mean?
Nothing.

788
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,481
I'm proud of you.

789
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,881
Thank you, boss.

790
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,368
It's my pleasure to
introduce my friend

791
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,289
and the CEO of Apple,

792
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,488
John Sculley.

793
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,928
- John?
- Yeah?

794
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,963
Lisa made a painting on the Mac.

795
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,889
The Macintosh, Apple's
near-mythological home computer,

796
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,610
has gotten off to a rocky start

797
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,324
in its battle with
industry titan IBM.

798
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,164
With sales originally projected

799
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,810
to be 1,000,000 in
the first quarter,

800
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,566
Apple has sold only 35,000 of
the user-friendly machines.

801
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,682
The insistence
by Steve Jobs that it'd have

802
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,649
what's called
"end-to-end control,"

803
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,768
which is a way of saying
that it's not compatible

804
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,922
with most outside
hardware or software

805
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,322
is the Shakespearean flaw in a
machine that had potential.

806
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,085
Apple Computers
closed two of its factories today

807
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,889
in the wake of
disappointing sales.

808
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,644
Do you know how
many Macs were sold last month?

809
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,006
500.

810
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,004
In a move that surprised
some, but not all, on Wall Street,

811
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,525
the board of directors
of Apple Computers

812
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,002
voted today to fire
its co-founder, Steve Jobs.

813
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,003
Did he jump, or was he pushed?

814
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,880
His ex-boss, Apple CEO John
Sculley, refused to comment.

815
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,724
However,
in an exclusive interview,

816
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,010
Steve Wozniak has slammed the integrity
of his old friend Steve Jobs.

817
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,924
He calls Jobs "an insulting
and hurtful guy."

818
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,322
Jobs is hitting back with
a new company and a new computer.

819
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,482
Apple has a new competitor.

820
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,484
Steve Jobs' Black Cube is aimed
at the education market.

821
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,528
Few people have the
ability to make the world wait,

822
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,769
but that is just what Jobs is
doing with his new company, NeXT.

823
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,762
Focus seems kind of sharp.

824
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,966
On the slide?

825
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,851
The floor. The pin spot.

826
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,729
I think we want a sharp focus.

827
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,801
Don't take it personally.

828
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,370
Just not a fan of
the circus aesthetic.

829
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,241
All right, let's hold here.

830
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,246
We're gonna have to go up
and refocus the instruments.

831
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,641
Just one, the 30 is fine.

832
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,883
While we're holding, there are
well-wishers in the VIP room.

833
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,371
And Woz is here.

834
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,523
Steve Wozniak. Yes,
hey, thank you very much.

835
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,840
And Andy Hertzfeld.

836
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,650
- Andy Hertzfeld.
- Thank you.

837
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,004
John Sculley is here, too.

838
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,331
It's nice that he's here.

839
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,522
Really? I don't think
it's very nice at all.

840
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,081
You have to see them.
They wanna pay their respects.

841
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,369
If they were respectful, we'd
all still be at Apple right now.

842
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,567
Look...

843
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,529
If they really wished me well,
they'd keep it to themselves.

844
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,927
Can I tell you something? I don't
think they do wish me well.

845
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,446
But I'm all right with that.
I'm over Apple.

846
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,329
I got over the Mac,
and Woz and Sculley,

847
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,847
the same way you get over
your high-school sweetheart.

848
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,121
Build a new one.

849
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,407
- Can I tell you something?
- Yes.

850
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,403
You said you wouldn't
compete with them,

851
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,723
but you designed a computer
specifically for the education market,

852
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,888
which they putatively own.

853
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,731
So, I think it's cool
they're here.

854
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,802
They're suing me.

855
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,405
Still.

856
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,209
It was nice they came.

857
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,202
They're not being magnanimous.

858
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,964
They want it to look
like an amicable divorce.

859
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,726
History doesn't remember Joe
DiMaggio kindly for dumping Marilyn.

860
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,801
Steve.

861
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,286
What's your problem?

862
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,411
I don't know, but I'm sure
it can be traced back to you.

863
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,525
You know, I'm the one who has
to explain you to people.

864
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,285
$100,000 to Paul Rand
for a corporate logo,

865
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,761
when we didn't even know
what our company made.

866
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,402
A $650,000 mold for the Cube

867
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,281
because God forbid the angles be
90.1 instead of 90.

868
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,204
I forbid the angles to
be 90.1 instead of 90.

869
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,009
That box could be on display
at the Guggenheim.

870
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,641
Don't give them reason
to say to the press

871
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,802
you have a chip
on your shoulder.

872
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,484
Will you do that for me?

873
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,050
I don't have a chip
on my shoulder.

874
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,645
Okay, okay.

875
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,520
But don't give them
a reason to say you do.

876
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,090
I don't.

877
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,161
That's the right attitude.

878
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,406
That's not an attitude.

879
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,323
They're gonna call me back in a
minute to look at the light.

880
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,845
Get one out of the way.

881
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,046
Fine!

882
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,844
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

883
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,281
One more thing.

884
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,441
Sure.

885
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,682
No questions from
the press after.

886
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,161
No? Why?

887
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,890
Until I have better answers,

888
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,326
no press avail.

889
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,847
If somebody asks where I am, you
just saw me, and I'll be right back.

890
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,201
Okay.

891
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,721
Who do you want first?

892
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,451
Bring me the face
of Steve Wozniak.

893
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,407
Hang on.

894
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,967
I thought you went to school.
Hang on.

895
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,721
You were supposed to go to school
an hour ago. I thought you left.

896
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,087
I didn't wake up my mom
on time this morning.

897
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,844
It's happened before, too.

898
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,009
I wake up with the alarm, and then
I get dressed and eat breakfast,

899
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,090
but sometimes I forget to see
what time it is after that.

900
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,525
Why doesn't your mom just
set her own alarm clock?

901
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,601
It's one of my chores.

902
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,451
I don't understand what that has
to do with why you're still...

903
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,121
Where's your mother?

904
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,804
She went to find a payphone.

905
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,010
An hour ago, she said...

906
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,845
You don't have to
raise your hand.

907
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,921
You said it was off by a little.

908
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,240
It is.

909
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,401
I just measured it.

910
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,081
Joanna...

911
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,571
Exactly a foot
on all four sides.

912
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,684
There are six sides. But you're
not supposed be here right now.

913
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,483
We know if four of the sides
are equal to each other,

914
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,800
the other two must be
equal as well.

915
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,608
The top, bottom, right, and left

916
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,489
are about a millimeter shorter
than the front and back.

917
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,210
They're not, I measured them.

918
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,728
Lisa, I'm kind of
an expert in design.

919
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,605
And that's a 20-cent ruler. You think
there's a chance it could be off?

920
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,206
If I had another ruler,
I would measure this ruler,

921
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,566
but I really doubt it's off.

922
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,806
When your mother comes back,

923
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,360
you have to go to school.
Because it's a ruler!

924
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,726
Why is it off?

925
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,444
Did you hear what I just said?
Yes.

926
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,971
Because sometimes
it seems like you just

927
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,883
keep saying what you want
without listening.

928
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,731
I'm listening.

929
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,001
Is there something you need?

930
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,961
No.

931
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,891
Why isn't it a perfect cube?

932
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,208
You've asked me before.
I forget what it is.

933
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,721
It's an optical anomaly.

934
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,646
To the human eye, a perfect
cube doesn't look like a cube,

935
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,207
so we made it roughly a millimeter
shorter than a foot on two sides.

936
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,766
What's an anomaly?

937
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,451
You've asked me
that before, too.

938
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,050
I don't know why
you keep doing that.

939
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,281
It's an exception. Something
that doesn't fit a pattern.

940
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,164
You have to go to school.
Come in!

941
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,522
I think you two have met.

942
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,601
Hello, old friend.

943
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,841
- You look well.
- So do you.

944
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,201
So do you.

945
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,887
And they're telling me George is
ready for you to look at the focus.

946
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,246
Take a walk with me.

947
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,084
- Is this Lisa?
- Yeah.

948
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,730
- This can't be Lisa.
- It is.

949
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,848
Lisa's this big. They get taller.
Come on.

950
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,280
- Do you remember me?
- She doesn't.

951
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,601
I'm your dad's friend,
Steve Wozniak.

952
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,921
I apologize,
I don't remember you.

953
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,327
You're very polite.

954
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,011
- Woz?
- Yeah.

955
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,525
Chrisann's at a payphone.
Would you find her?

956
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,529
Yeah.

957
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,971
- Good turnout.
- Great turnout.

958
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,167
Yeah.

959
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,050
"Insanely great."
Insanely great.

960
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,487
You know, this is the first time we
haven't played for the same team.

961
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,961
It's like you're releasing
your first solo album.

962
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,890
I appreciate your
inviting me to the launch.

963
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,371
I just want to wipe
the slate clean.

964
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,727
That's exactly what I want.
That's why I came backstage.

965
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,690
I want you to know
I'll be out there with you.

966
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,967
Any chance I can get you to
go out there instead of me?

967
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,481
- I love you, Steve.
- I love you, too, Woz.

968
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,528
You know, some
things were said. They were.

969
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,921
They were said in public.
They were published.

970
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,240
Were you pressured to do it?

971
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,651
Was I what?

972
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,482
Check it out.

973
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,370
It's the orchestra pit
for the San Francisco Opera.

974
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,401
Was I pressured to do it?

975
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,171
I once met Seiji Ozawa
at Tanglewood.

976
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,004
A thunderous conductor.

977
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,808
Godly artfulness and nuance.

978
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,361
And I asked him what exactly a
conductor does that a metronome can't.

979
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,601
Surprisingly, he...

980
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,091
He didn't beat
the living shit out of you?

981
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,805
That's right. No, he said,

982
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,770
"The musicians play
their instruments.

983
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,524
"I play the orchestra."

984
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,966
That feels like something that sounds
good, but doesn't mean anything.

985
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,129
Markkula, Sculley. They ask you
to slag me off in the press?

986
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,090
I had reason to be angry.

987
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,480
- Did they?
- Absolutely not.

988
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,601
But they asked you to talk.

989
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,128
Apple was under siege,
you'd just left the company.

990
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,531
Someone had to talk
to the press.

991
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,961
I'm right here, Woz.
The company left me.

992
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,801
I begged you.
I begged you.

993
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,121
The Apple II accounted
for 70% of the revenue.

994
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,811
What did you think
was gonna happen?

995
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,441
You didn't care enough about
the Apple II or the Lisa.

996
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,851
Let's be really clear.

997
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,207
I didn't care at all about
the Apple II or the Lisa.

998
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,923
I wasn't pressured to do it.

999
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,526
What I said to the press

1000
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,400
was an honest, if tempered,
reflection of what I believed.

1001
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,086
- Woz.
- Yeah?

1002
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,681
What the fuck is on your wrist?

1003
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,123
You wanna know?
I literally can't wait.

1004
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,483
Everyone's gonna be
wearing these in 10 years.

1005
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,722
It's a Nixie Watch,
made using Nixie tubes.

1006
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,723
This is actually
40-year-old technology.

1007
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,164
Cold-cathode tubes. They're
operating at 140 volts.

1008
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,288
I tilt my wrist 45 degrees,
it's right there.

1009
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,850
Hours, minutes, and seconds.

1010
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,206
The way our minds work.

1011
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,850
Look at that.

1012
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,921
Do me a favor.

1013
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,480
Set the watch ahead like you're on a
plane and just changed time zones.

1014
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,284
Not a problem.

1015
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,961
Unscrew that,

1016
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,481
just hit the button.

1017
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,801
Excuse me, flight attendant,

1018
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,451
the man next to me would appear
to be detonating a bomb.

1019
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,284
You think this looks
like a bomb.

1020
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,727
Even right now,
I'm not 100% sure it isn't.

1021
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,726
I think maybe once people
get used to it...

1022
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,041
No.

1023
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,566
I was angry.

1024
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,930
You were saying things
about the Apple II,

1025
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,610
and the way you were
treating the team...

1026
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,045
Woz.

1027
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,122
You get a free pass for life.

1028
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,326
I got to get back onstage.

1029
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,568
We got, like, two minutes
of rehearsal time left.

1030
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,644
Do you understand how
condescending that just was?

1031
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,001
Maybe you don't.

1032
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,286
I don't want to see you
get dragged off

1033
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,561
an airplane in
plastic handcuffs.

1034
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,051
I get a free pass
for life from you?

1035
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,284
You give out the passes?

1036
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,407
You give them to me?

1037
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,766
You're gonna have a stroke,
little buddy.

1038
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,049
What did you do?

1039
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,925
Why has Lisa not heard of me?

1040
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,128
Shit, man, how many
fourth-graders have heard of you?

1041
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,966
You can't write code.

1042
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,931
You're not an engineer.
You're not a designer.

1043
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,241
You can't put
a hammer to a nail.

1044
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,731
I built the circuit board.

1045
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,643
The graphical
interface was stolen

1046
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,721
from Xerox PARC.

1047
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,006
Jef Raskin was the leader
of the Mac team

1048
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,923
before you threw him off
his own project.

1049
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,970
Everything! Someone else
designed the box.

1050
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,688
So, how come 10 times in a day I
read "Steve Jobs is a genius"?

1051
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,684
What do you do?

1052
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,007
I play the orchestra.

1053
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,531
And you're a good musician.

1054
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,523
You sit right there. You're
the best in your row.

1055
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,809
I came here to clear the air!

1056
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,047
Do you know why I came here?

1057
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,281
Didn't you just answer that?

1058
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,204
I came here because
you're gonna get killed.

1059
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,004
Your computer's gonna fail.

1060
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,481
You had a college and
university advisory board

1061
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,644
telling you they need a powerful
workstation for $2,000 to $3,000.

1062
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,643
You've priced NeXT at $6,500.

1063
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,406
And that doesn't include the
optional $3,000 hard drive,

1064
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,887
which people will discover
isn't optional.

1065
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,089
Because the optical disk
is too weak to do anything.

1066
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,844
And the $2,500 laser printer

1067
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,281
brings the total to $12,000.

1068
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,521
And, in the entire world,

1069
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,241
you are the only person who cares
that it's housed in a perfect cube.

1070
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,405
You're gonna get killed.

1071
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,642
And I came here to stand next
to you while that happens

1072
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,848
because that's what friends do.

1073
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,288
That's what men do.
I don't need your "pass."

1074
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,122
We go back, so don't talk to
me like I'm other people.

1075
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,680
I'm the only one that knows

1076
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,121
that this guy here
is someone you invented.

1077
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,244
I'm standing by you because that
perfect cube, that does nothing,

1078
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,926
is about to be
the single biggest failure

1079
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,368
in the history of
personal computing.

1080
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,563
Tell me something else
I don't know.

1081
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,041
Back onstage?

1082
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,169
We're out of time. They've got to
mop the stage and open the house.

1083
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,602
If it crashes,
it crashes, right?

1084
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,405
You'll make a joke.

1085
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,209
I'll make a joke.

1086
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,601
If it crashes, it crashes.

1087
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,241
It's a good slogan.
"NeXT. If it crashes, it crashes."

1088
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,442
I'm not just talking
about the demo, Steve.

1089
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,807
If it tanks,
we don't swallow cyanide.

1090
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,530
We go back to the drawing board.

1091
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,806
No more drawing boards.

1092
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,121
Invent the Edsel twice, you don't
get any more drawing boards.

1093
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,884
Tell me what the plan is.

1094
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,042
You have to tell me the plan,
because I don't know.

1095
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,124
You're walking around like
you've got "can't lose" cards.

1096
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,487
The plan will reveal itself to
you when you're ready to see it.

1097
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,803
Will I have to drop acid?

1098
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,885
Couldn't hurt.

1099
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,564
Is there a plan?

1100
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,244
Have I ever let you down?

1101
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,810
Every single goddamn time.

1102
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,007
Then I'm due.

1103
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,406
Is there?

1104
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,005
Joanna, there's a plan.

1105
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,283
I just don't wanna put you in a
position where you're lying to people.

1106
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,766
Start 15 minutes late
so Avie can recompile

1107
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,126
and give us a fighting chance.

1108
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,804
Jesus Christ! How many times
are we gonna have this...

1109
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,251
We're not starting late ever!
Fine!

1110
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,324
We're not ever starting late!
"...ever starting late."

1111
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,081
But where do you come down
on starting late?

1112
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,166
Lisa's been doing this thing

1113
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,489
where she asks me about stuff
I've already told her.

1114
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,609
She asks me questions, and I know
she already knows the answers.

1115
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,681
What's that about?

1116
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,926
Kids do that when they're scared

1117
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,849
one of their parents
is in a bad mood.

1118
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,282
They try to get you talking
about something you like.

1119
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,771
It's very common
and can be treated

1120
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,202
by talking to her
about things she likes.

1121
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,047
Do you have any experience
or training in this field?

1122
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,241
No.

1123
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,564
Tell them to open the house.

1124
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,921
Where's Lisa?

1125
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,561
She's around.

1126
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,561
What does that mean?

1127
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,803
She's running
around the building.

1128
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,451
An hour ago, you said you
were taking her to school.

1129
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,806
She begged me to let her stay.

1130
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,164
There are fathers
who would so love...

1131
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,403
It is wrong, okay? It is morally
wrong, it's parentally wrong.

1132
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,324
It is wrong for you to use Lisa as
a way of getting money from me.

1133
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,051
She'll know,
if she doesn't already,

1134
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,849
that that is your
primary use for her.

1135
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,445
And she will hate you
for the rest of your life.

1136
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,760
She will see,
if she doesn't already,

1137
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,326
that her mother is a woman who stands
up to men.

1138
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,004
By living off of them.

1139
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,890
By not letting myself be
imprisoned and degraded by them.

1140
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,448
Imprisoned?
I can't get rid of you.

1141
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,161
I need a doctor,
and I need a dentist.

1142
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,210
I dropped out of college after a
semester, but, okay, let's have a look.

1143
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,924
You will support your
daughter and her mother.

1144
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,161
Did you pay someone $1,500
to bless your house?

1145
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,806
Did you hear what I said?
Did you?

1146
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,609
I don't remember
how much it was, Steve.

1147
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,881
It was $1,500.

1148
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,200
They don't do it for free.

1149
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,089
- They don't.
- They charge $1,500.

1150
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,161
How I spend...

1151
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,886
Fuck. You know what?
I'm not even...

1152
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,611
Were you about to say, "How I spend
my money is none of your business"?

1153
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,723
I have a sinus infection, and
I need to see a dentist, too.

1154
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,485
So you can see how your "blessing"
budget could have been better spent.

1155
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,244
Like on a perfect cube?

1156
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,848
- Look at me, Chrisann.
- What?

1157
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,007
You know who I am, right?

1158
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,081
Yes.

1159
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,480
And you know I know people.

1160
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,562
What are you talking about?
Look at me.

1161
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,325
And you know the people I
know, they know people.

1162
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,887
What is this?

1163
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,088
If I ever hear again
that you've thrown

1164
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,361
a cereal bowl at Lisa's head...

1165
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,687
What?... my private
line's gonna ring.

1166
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,650
And a voice on the other end
is gonna say, "We're all set."

1167
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,842
That's how I'll learn that you're dead.
Are you...

1168
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,970
I threw the bowl on the floor.

1169
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,769
I didn't throw it at her head.

1170
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,531
She wasn't even in the room!

1171
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,886
She was nowhere...

1172
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,325
I threw the bowl on the floor.

1173
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,566
She's a little girl.
You're scaring her.

1174
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,120
I'm a grown man.
You're scaring me.

1175
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,202
Taking out the garbage
is a chore.

1176
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,362
Clearing the table is a chore.

1177
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,046
Waking you up in the morning
is just fucking creepy.

1178
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,649
Please teach me more
about being a parent.

1179
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,801
We're all done here.

1180
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,360
It means so much coming from
someone who won't admit he is one.

1181
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,403
Stop screaming at Lisa.
I give her responsibilities!

1182
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,682
Got it. And one day she's
gonna thank me for it!

1183
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,410
Probably in your sleep.
Fuck off!

1184
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,726
Okay.

1185
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,411
I never... I never
threw anything at her head!

1186
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,960
Steve...

1187
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,524
I never would.

1188
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,689
Things don't become so
because you say so.

1189
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,522
There'll be more money in your
account by the end of business.

1190
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,367
Were you being nice?

1191
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,521
Oh, yeah.

1192
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,561
Andy's next.

1193
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,284
Hertzfeld or Cunningham?

1194
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,481
Hertzfeld.

1195
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,564
He's playing with Avie Tevanian
on the computer backstage.

1196
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,731
Ladies and gentlemen,
the house is now open.

1197
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,683
...playing in front
of thousands of people.

1198
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,761
Steve!

1199
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,605
Can he do it later, Joel?
We go in eight minutes.

1200
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,603
Can I just get a quick reaction
to the press this morning?

1201
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,569
What about it? The size
of it, the volume.

1202
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,801
I'll tell you on background...

1203
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,961
I was hoping for
a quote from Steve.

1204
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,405
I'll tell you on background

1205
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,847
that I've never seen anything
like it in the tech industry.

1206
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,251
I called The Wall Street Journal

1207
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,685
to take out
a full-page ad for today,

1208
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,127
and do you know what
their sales guy said?

1209
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,524
"Why bother? It'd be like notifying
Macy's that tomorrow is Christmas."

1210
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,125
You saw the Stewart Alsop
newsletter?

1211
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,201
I did.

1212
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,009
I'm sorry, Joanna, I need to
get Steve on the record.

1213
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:20,369
The headline was, "Dear NeXT,
when can I get my machine?"

1214
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,601
When can he?

1215
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,809
We'll announce the ship date
in the next eight to 10 weeks.

1216
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,245
Alsop's not talking
about the ship date.

1217
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,402
He wants to know when he
can get one to play with.

1218
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,721
We have a lot of
respect for Stewart Alsop,

1219
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,404
and we want to get
a machine into his hands

1220
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,249
so he can tell
his subscribers about it.

1221
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,130
- When will that be?
- Very soon.

1222
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,886
A couple of days?
A week? Off the record.

1223
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,127
- Off the record?
- Completely.

1224
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,241
We think...

1225
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,481
He'll get it when it's finished.

1226
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,970
It's not finished?

1227
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,411
It's almost finished.

1228
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,244
I've been watching you rehearse
the demo for three weeks.

1229
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,287
Yeah.

1230
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,771
- What's left?
- A little thing.

1231
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,604
- What?
- I think that's...

1232
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,650
We're off the record, and Joel's always
been good at understanding nuance.

1233
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,961
What's left to finish?

1234
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,567
I guess, in layman's terms, you'd
have to say we don't have an OS.

1235
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,002
- An operating system?
- Yeah.

1236
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,521
What do you mean?

1237
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,922
Well, the OS is
what runs the computer.

1238
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,088
In fact, it sort of
is the computer.

1239
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,401
How has it been running? How's
it gonna run this morning?

1240
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,091
What do you mean,
you don't have an OS?

1241
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,764
It's like this.

1242
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,683
Avie Tevanian is our
Chief Software Designer,

1243
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,091
and he wrote a demo program.

1244
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,486
It's like we built a great car,

1245
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,806
but we haven't built the engine.

1246
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,929
So we put a golf-cart battery in there
to make it go for a little bit.

1247
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,850
All this computer knows how to do
right now is demonstrate itself.

1248
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,247
You're telling me the only thing
you've built is a black cube?

1249
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,322
Yes. Yeah.

1250
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,368
But isn't it the coolest
black cube you've ever seen?

1251
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,044
- Is this...
- We're off the record.

1252
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,521
Is this a strategy or a problem
, because if it's a problem...

1253
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,410
Do not share proprietary
knowledge with that man.

1254
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,802
It's not a problem.

1255
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,564
I wouldn't understand it anyway.

1256
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,041
I don't understand it either,
and my name's on the patents.

1257
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,121
It's got email.

1258
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,807
Well, email's not just
for tech specialists anymore.

1259
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,120
Well, it is, but it won't be.

1260
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,885
And I assume an email sent
on a NeXT computer

1261
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,281
can only be received
by a NeXT computer?

1262
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,647
Closed, end-to-end.

1263
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,687
The new trash can is wrong.

1264
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,649
I wanna tell you I appreciate
all the hours you put into it,

1265
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,121
but I can't because
of how terrible it is.

1266
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,845
Go back to the other one.

1267
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,281
And why are we still giving
three options on the clock?

1268
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,526
How many options
do you wanna give?

1269
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,122
Two. "Buy it" or "Don't."

1270
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,368
Can I talk to you for a second?
Abso-fruitly.

1271
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,681
Uh, look, man,

1272
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,250
Avie's been recompiling,
but he says

1273
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,163
there may be some
glitches this morning.

1274
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,844
If all there are,
are some glitches,

1275
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,605
it'll be a triumph of
miraculous magnitude.

1276
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,842
Why are you
translating for Avie?

1277
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,763
I didn't want him
to find out the hard way

1278
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,763
your position on
glitches in a demo,

1279
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,763
but it sounds like
you've mellowed.

1280
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,810
I've been growing, Andy. I've
been learning to love myself.

1281
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,526
Mmm, I wouldn't have ever
dreamed that was a problem.

1282
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,365
Fantastic burn.
You need to go to your seat.

1283
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,364
How about Lisa, getting into
a school for gifted kids?

1284
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,442
Yeah, she was tested,
and it turns out she can fly.

1285
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,885
But, seriously, it's a big deal.

1286
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,731
I know it's a big deal . That's why
I built the school a building.

1287
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,687
Well, I'm sure
that's not why she got in.

1288
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,450
Really?

1289
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,841
Can I show you something
funny from Macworld?

1290
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,450
I can't think of anything
I have to do right now.

1291
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,289
It'll make you feel good.

1292
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,600
Joanna! Look at this!

1293
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,603
Oh, Andy, he's only got
a couple of minutes.

1294
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,604
It's Guy Kawasaki writing in Macworld.
You're gonna like this.

1295
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,205
Well, can we all enjoy it later?

1296
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:31,042
He wrote a parody press release about
Apple buying NeXT for your OS.

1297
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,044
He imagines a near future,
where Apple needs your OS

1298
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,687
and has to buy NeXT,
and you come back as CEO.

1299
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,806
He has Gates saying, "There would
now be more innovations from Jobs

1300
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,530
"that Microsoft could copy."

1301
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,724
You can read it later.

1302
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,763
Thanks.

1303
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,411
She would've gotten in without
you donating a building.

1304
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,684
Still, it's something to
talk about in the interview.

1305
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,125
All right. Good luck.

1306
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,681
Thanks.

1307
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,008
Give that to me. I'll
throw it out for you.

1308
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,486
I'm gonna hang on to it.

1309
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,091
What?

1310
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,361
What?

1311
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,607
You ready for Sculley?

1312
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,725
Excuse me! Lisa!

1313
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,041
You can't shout!

1314
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,681
Lisa?

1315
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,251
You have to go.

1316
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,843
It's dangerous up here. That's
why I make other people do it.

1317
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,923
Who are you hiding from,
me or your mom?

1318
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,524
I'm not hiding.

1319
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,401
Let's go.

1320
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,085
What were you listening to?

1321
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,602
I'm listening to two
versions of the same song.

1322
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,886
And then, when I get to the end,

1323
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,281
I rewind to listen
to them again.

1324
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,648
It's the same song, but the
versions are different.

1325
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,209
- What's the song?
- Okay.

1326
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,284
So, it's a really old song, and
it's called Both Sides, Now.

1327
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,890
"Both Sides, Now"?

1328
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,689
Yeah.

1329
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,808
What's it about?

1330
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,124
It's about... There are three verses.
Clouds, love, and life.

1331
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,802
And the person singing is singing
that they used to think of...

1332
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,689
That they used to think about...

1333
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,444
Clouds, love, and life?

1334
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,844
Right. One way, yeah, but now they
look at them another way, and they...

1335
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,405
They've come to
the conclusion that

1336
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,404
they really don't know clouds,
love, or life at all.

1337
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,326
Those are the exact words.

1338
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,845
Yeah, Joni Mitchell,

1339
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,686
'cause it's not a really old song,
unless I'm a really old guy.

1340
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,411
You have to go to school now.

1341
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,290
Do you want me to tell you the
differences between the two versions?

1342
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,089
Right now.

1343
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,403
The first version is the kind of
thing that you would call girlish.

1344
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,528
I didn't mean I want to know
the difference right now.

1345
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,126
I meant you have to
go to school right now.

1346
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,844
I can stay and watch.

1347
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,366
You are truant.
You're committing a crime.

1348
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,761
I'm not gonna miss
anything important.

1349
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,251
How do you know?

1350
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,526
I read ahead.

1351
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,925
The Pilgrims make it
to the New World.

1352
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,809
Then, the Declaration
of Independence.

1353
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,684
Yeah, you skipped
a couple of centuries.

1354
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,927
Steve?

1355
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,651
Chrisann's out there.

1356
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,245
Let's go!

1357
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,011
Can I make my case for staying?

1358
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,367
Nope.

1359
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,881
She was with me.

1360
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,604
Come on. Your dad
doesn't want us to stay.

1361
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,809
That's not true. That's not...

1362
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,330
You have to be
in school, is all.

1363
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,685
I'm committing
a crime right now,

1364
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,802
and I don't
wanna get in trouble.

1365
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,405
You're not in trouble.
I was kidding.

1366
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,891
Okay.

1367
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,647
Hey. What was
the second version?

1368
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,291
You said the first version was girlish,
what was the second version?

1369
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,805
I can't really
think of the word.

1370
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,526
Okay. Well,
have a good day at school.

1371
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,601
"Regretful."

1372
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,041
What?

1373
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,248
Like, wishing you could go
back and do things different.

1374
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,411
You're too young
to be regretful.

1375
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,769
Not me.

1376
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,569
The person singing the song.

1377
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,484
Got it. "Regretful."
That makes sense because...

1378
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,845
I wanna live with you.

1379
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,411
Six minutes.

1380
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,967
- You want to see Sculley?
- No.

1381
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,965
You know all those times
I told you, you needed security?

1382
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,641
Here's why.

1383
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,531
I don't know how it is I've
gotten older and you haven't.

1384
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,640
Some deal with the devil
I was never offered.

1385
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,851
So, you know what I've been
thinking for the last four years?

1386
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,327
As it turns out, John, I've never
known what you were thinking.

1387
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,687
No newborn baby has control.

1388
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,089
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

1389
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,288
In '84, before the Mac launch.
You said...

1390
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,361
Yeah.

1391
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,881
You said that being adopted
meant you didn't have control.

1392
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,200
We're starting
in a minute, so...

1393
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,408
Why do people think I fired you?

1394
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,608
It's fine, John.
It's all behind us.

1395
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,441
Is it?

1396
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,760
Hmm?

1397
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,127
Don't play stupid.
You can't pull it off.

1398
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,490
You came here to ask me why
people think you fired me?

1399
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,483
Why do people think I fired you?

1400
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,321
Just confirm
something for me, okay?

1401
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,090
You liked the ad.

1402
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,481
Right? The commercial,
1984. You liked it.

1403
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,330
When are you
gonna get furniture?

1404
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,965
It's not an easy process.

1405
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,448
It is. You buy a
couch, take it from there.

1406
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,926
I'd be really surprised
if you came here

1407
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,490
to talk about
interior decorating.

1408
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,766
I liked the ad very much.

1409
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,080
- You did?
- You know I did.

1410
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,242
You're a lying son of a
bitch who tried to kill it.

1411
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,964
It's time to take
a hard look at the Mac.

1412
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,121
It's past time.

1413
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,691
It's overpriced.

1414
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,165
We need to drop it to $1,995. We
need to double the marketing budget,

1415
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,483
put more bodies on an internal hard
drive and invest in FileServer.

1416
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,289
Where the hell did you get the
idea that I tried to kill...

1417
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,805
- Lee Clow.
- Lee's wrong.

1418
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,484
- He's lying?
- He's mistaken.

1419
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,925
Where would the money come from?

1420
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,287
It would come from finally
getting rid of the Apple II.

1421
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,249
The Apple II is the
only thing making money.

1422
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,401
You agreed with the board.

1423
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,289
I understood the board's
concerns, but I...

1424
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,328
The board's concerns that
we didn't show the product?

1425
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,811
Among other things,
but my question was...

1426
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,281
What other things? Honestly, I'm
just asking 'cause I'm curious.

1427
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,441
You said "among other things."

1428
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,166
Among other things. It was
set in a dystopian galaxy.

1429
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,129
It took place on a planet
where we don't live.

1430
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,282
It was dark, and the
opposite of our brand.

1431
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,368
And we didn't show the product.

1432
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,127
People talked about the ad, but most of
them didn't know what we were selling.

1433
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,448
The Mac needs
to sell for $1,995.

1434
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,363
There is no market
research telling us

1435
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,522
that the Mac is failing
because it's overpriced.

1436
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,409
It's telling us that
people don't like it

1437
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,284
because they think it
doesn't do anything.

1438
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,124
It's closed, end-to-end.

1439
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,121
We didn't know it wasn't what
people wanted, but it isn't.

1440
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,248
They want slots, they want
choices, they want options.

1441
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,681
The way we buy stereos,
mix and match components.

1442
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,881
John, listen to me.

1443
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,644
Whoever said the customer
is always right was,

1444
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,886
I promise you, a customer.

1445
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,166
It had skinheads in it.

1446
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,208
She was liberating them.
Liberating the skinheads.

1447
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,521
The ad didn't have anything to
do with fucking skinheads!

1448
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,090
We used them as fucking extras.

1449
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,650
Nobody even knows
they were skinheads!

1450
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,210
I'm just saying,
the board had concerns...

1451
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,487
You invented
lifestyle advertising.

1452
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,768
And "our brand" was my brand.

1453
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,451
My job is to make a
recommendation to the board.

1454
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,090
We showed a lot of happy
people drinking Pepsi.

1455
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,250
We didn't say the world was going
to end if you bought a Dr. Pepper!

1456
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,560
Recommend that we drop the price

1457
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,846
and double the marketing budget.

1458
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,921
I can't.

1459
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,724
And we showed the product!

1460
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,087
We showed it being opened,
we showed it being poured,

1461
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,241
being consumed!

1462
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,448
What are you gonna do? Recommend
that we kill the Mac?

1463
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,443
I already have, Steve.

1464
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,921
What?

1465
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,767
When?

1466
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,205
You think the secret to
your success

1467
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,726
was not assuming people knew
what to do with a can of soda?

1468
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,723
I didn't kill the ad, Steve!

1469
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,325
I'm the only reason
it made it on the air!

1470
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,846
Just now.

1471
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,127
An hour ago, I'm coming
from Markkula's house.

1472
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,721
What did he say?

1473
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,242
What did he say?
Invent something new.

1474
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,930
I'll give you a team,
you can sit in Maui.

1475
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,604
The resorts come with couches.

1476
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,808
Wait a minute. Are you saying you
recommended terminating the Mac?

1477
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,603
Or you recommended taking me
off the Mac team?

1478
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,603
We bought three spots
in the Super Bowl.

1479
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,841
Two 30s and a 60.

1480
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,649
And after we screened it, the
board wanted that money back,

1481
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,404
and they asked me to
sell off the spots.

1482
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,721
Chiat/Day sold off the
two 30s, but not the 60,

1483
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,126
and I let it be known
to Lee Clow

1484
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,690
that if he didn't try very hard

1485
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,201
to sell the last spot,
I wouldn't be unhappy.

1486
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,805
If we drop the price
and double the budget...

1487
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,769
You can't drop the price
or double the budget!

1488
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,605
I mean, the only way to do that is
to take money out of the Apple II.

1489
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,365
The Apple II should embarrass you.
It embarrasses me.

1490
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,885
It doesn't embarrass
the shareholders.

1491
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,564
I don't give a shit
about the shareholders!

1492
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,120
That's why I hired you, so I don't
ever have to hear about shareholders!

1493
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,611
The shareholders are my problem,

1494
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,762
and the board represents
the shareholders!

1495
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,444
That's how it works!

1496
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,046
You sure it wasn't Lee Clow who
dragged his feet selling the 60?

1497
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,322
At my direction, Steve.

1498
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,290
You think he would have done that
on his own, taken it on himself?

1499
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,125
Yeah. I think he would've done
what it took to save it from you.

1500
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,964
I was the only thing
protecting it!

1501
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,007
You didn't want the ad

1502
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,606
because you were trying to kill the
Mac two months before it launched!

1503
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,205
You are fucking delusional!

1504
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,609
Can I mention something to you?
Sure.

1505
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,768
I have no earthly idea
why you're here.

1506
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,849
The story of why
and how you left Apple,

1507
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,764
which is quickly becoming
mythologized, isn't true.

1508
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,325
I'm gonna take this
to the board myself.

1509
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,965
- Don't do that.
- I am doing that.

1510
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,041
You can't.

1511
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,121
Why?

1512
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,570
They believe you're no longer
necessary to this company.

1513
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,081
I get hate mail.

1514
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,281
Death threats.

1515
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,562
I get death threats!

1516
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,290
My kids are getting taunted.

1517
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,206
Why do people think I fired you?

1518
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,809
Joanna's gonna call
my name in a second.

1519
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,724
- Steve?
- That was unrehearsed.

1520
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,325
Yeah, I'll be there
in just a second!

1521
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,970
I gave you your day in court.

1522
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,648
You "gave" me? I gave the
board a clear choice.

1523
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,643
I said, "Do you want to invest
in the Apple II or the Mac?"

1524
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,886
And they chose the Apple II.

1525
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,849
The same people who wanted
to dump the Super Bowl spot.

1526
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,888
And then I got on
a plane to China.

1527
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,451
Mr. Sculley, there's a call
for you on Line 1.

1528
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,571
Or I almost got on a plane, because
I got a call in the lounge.

1529
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,051
Who made that call?
Doesn't matter.

1530
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,969
It matters to me.
Who made the call?

1531
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,047
John Sculley.

1532
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,929
John, if you get on that plane,

1533
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,530
you'll have lost your job
by the time it lands.

1534
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,724
Steve's been calling the board.
He wants you out.

1535
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,686
I left my bags on the plane.

1536
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,290
My shit's still somewhere
in Beijing.

1537
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,284
I took a car back to Cupertino in
the middle of the fucking night.

1538
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,441
I know what time it is.

1539
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,649
I need a quorum here in one hour,
and I want Steve here, too.

1540
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,760
You took me off the
Mac, and it was bad business.

1541
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,690
The quorum call was a homicide.

1542
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,161
Right there! That's the part
that's bullshit, my friend.

1543
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,210
It was a suicide, because
you knew your cards,

1544
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,406
and I showed you mine.

1545
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,370
I showed you mine,
and you did it anyway.

1546
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,886
What did you think
I was going to do?

1547
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,486
I'm okay losing,
but I'm not gonna forfeit.

1548
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,843
I'm not okay losing.

1549
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,081
We're losing market share,

1550
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,650
and the Mac is losing money.

1551
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,406
Our only hope is the Apple II,
which is stagnating

1552
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,482
because of its
soon-to-be obsolete DOS.

1553
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,087
Users are already rigging their machines
to run with a CP/M operating system

1554
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,650
that's been built
to run on Intel.

1555
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,645
I can't put it
more simply than this.

1556
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,804
We need to put our resources
into updating the Apple II.

1557
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,247
By taking resources
from the Mac.

1558
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,810
- It's failing.
- That's a fact.

1559
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,803
It's overpriced. There's
no evidence that it's...

1560
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,041
I'm the evidence!

1561
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,648
I'm the world's leading
expert on the Mac, John.

1562
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,721
What's your resume?

1563
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,483
You're issuing
contradictory instructions,

1564
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,608
you're insubordinate,
you make people miserable,

1565
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,650
our top engineers are fleeing
to Sun, Dell, HP.

1566
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,961
Wall Street doesn't know
who's driving the bus.

1567
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,202
We've lost hundreds
of millions in value,

1568
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,850
and I'm the CEO of Apple, Steve.

1569
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,967
That's my resume.

1570
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,050
But before that, you sold
carbonated sugar water, right?

1571
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,121
I sat in a fucking garage with
Wozniak and invented the future.

1572
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,647
Because artists lead and hacks
ask for a show of hands!

1573
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,566
All right. Well,
this guy's out of control.

1574
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,291
I'm perfectly willing to hand
in my resignation tonight,

1575
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,362
but if you want me to stay,
you can't have Steve.

1576
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,565
Settle him out.

1577
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,081
He can keep a share of stock,
so he gets our newsletter.

1578
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,081
He'll have to sever
his connection to Apple.

1579
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:57,164
I'm dead serious. I want the
secretary to call for a vote.

1580
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,525
I fucking dare you.

1581
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:07,251
You have done an outstanding
job over the years

1582
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,404
of cultivating the press, and by
that I mean manipulating them

1583
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,528
because none of them,
none of their editors,

1584
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,444
none of their editors'
publishers, to this day,

1585
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,965
know that you forced it.

1586
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,969
That you forced the board.

1587
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,963
Even after I told you
exactly what they'd do,

1588
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,923
which is exactly what they did.

1589
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,520
Unanimously.

1590
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,047
I don't have any trouble
remembering that, John,

1591
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,931
because of it being
the worst night of my life.

1592
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,924
And I forced the vote because
I believed I was right.

1593
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,606
I still believe I'm right.
And I'm right.

1594
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,521
Now, I bled that night.

1595
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,770
And I don't bleed.

1596
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,481
But time's done its thing.

1597
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,924
And I really haven't thought
about it in a while.

1598
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,448
I absolutely understand
why you're upset.

1599
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,523
And I want people
to know the truth, too.

1600
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,601
It's time.

1601
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,081
Got it.

1602
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,482
You're gonna end me, aren't you?

1603
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,010
You're being ridiculous.

1604
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,044
I'm gonna sit center court
and watch you do it yourself.

1605
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,805
Then I'm gonna order a nice
meal with a '55 Margaux,

1606
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,928
and sign some autographs.
Jesus Christ...

1607
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,604
You want some advice,
Pepsi Generation?

1608
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,206
Don't send Woz out to slap me
around in the press.

1609
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,045
Anybody else.
You, Markkula, Arthur Rock.

1610
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,610
Anyone but Rain Man.

1611
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,489
Don't manipulate him like that.

1612
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:24,323
Whatever you may think,
I'm always gonna protect him.

1613
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,531
Come on, Steve.

1614
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,931
That's what men do.

1615
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,165
We can't start late.

1616
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,003
I don't think there was any way
to detect a chip on my shoulder.

1617
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,248
Did you know, back at Bandley

1618
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,607
the Mac team gave
an award every year

1619
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,409
to the person who could
stand up to you?

1620
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,521
No.

1621
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,601
I won.

1622
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,049
Three years in a row.

1623
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,361
Cool.

1624
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,048
This... This...

1625
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,011
This Guy Kawasaki in Macworld...

1626
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,126
He accidentally
got it right, didn't he?

1627
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,203
You've been dragging
your feet on the NeXT OS

1628
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,011
until you can figure out
what Apple's going to need.

1629
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,442
Even if that were true, it doesn't
sound that diabolical to me.

1630
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,965
Hey. We're ready for you!

1631
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,282
I'm your closest confidante,
your best friend.

1632
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,886
Your thing...
What do you call it?

1633
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,361
Your "work wife."

1634
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,922
The whole time!
The last three years...

1635
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,246
When did you change your mind

1636
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,210
and start building the Steve
Jobs Revenge Machine?

1637
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,241
House to half.

1638
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,491
Do you remember Skylab?

1639
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,050
It was an unmanned satellite
NASA sent up in the early '70s

1640
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,929
on a data-gathering mission.

1641
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,326
The thing is,
when they sent it up,

1642
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,006
they didn't know yet how they
were going to get it back.

1643
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,522
But they felt like
they were close enough

1644
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,251
that in the eight years it was going
to be up there, they'd figure it out.

1645
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,885
They're on their way now.

1646
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,571
They didn't.

1647
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,760
So, after eight years,

1648
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,322
it came crashing down in a 1,000-mile
swath across the Indian Ocean.

1649
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,763
A little to the left,
a little to the right,

1650
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,763
somebody could have gotten hurt.

1651
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,329
I really wanted to build
a computer for colleges.

1652
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,446
The technology just didn't catch
up as fast as I needed it to.

1653
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,246
And you know we're out of money.

1654
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,971
Ladies and gentlemen, the
program will be starting momentarily.

1655
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,363
But then, Apple stopped
innovating, and I saw something better.

1656
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,727
Joanna, I know schools
aren't going to buy

1657
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,371
a $13,000 dictionary
with good speakers.

1658
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,283
You know I know that.

1659
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,924
But Apple will.

1660
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,567
Because Avie Tevanian is going to
build them exactly the OS they need.

1661
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,449
They're going to
have to buy me, too.

1662
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,526
For half a billion
dollars in stock,

1663
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,120
and end-to-end control
on every product.

1664
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,649
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

1665
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,842
More than a
year after it was first unveiled

1666
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,285
to industry insiders,

1667
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,841
the NeXT Computer is finally
available in stores.

1668
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,368
And it appears to be two
strikes in a row for Steve Jobs.

1669
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,921
Students and educators
are finding it difficult

1670
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,202
to justify
the machine's high cost.

1671
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,930
So much for the Black Cube.

1672
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,247
NeXT just sold
its factory to Canon,

1673
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,647
and laid off half its employees.

1674
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,042
In the world of computers,
it's kill or be killed.

1675
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,202
Apple Computer has
fallen on hard times.

1676
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,761
It is laying off
about 2,500 people.

1677
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,042
Apple is
continuing to lose market share

1678
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,168
with no new innovations
in the pipeline

1679
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,164
except the Newton, a pet
project of CEO John Sculley.

1680
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:30,562
If you really want to
be mobile, you want a Newton PDA.

1681
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,210
But, then again,
maybe you don't.

1682
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,767
It turns handwriting
into computer text.

1683
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,565
Hey, Dolph, take a memo on your Newton.
"Beat up Martin."

1684
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,565
In 1980, Apple
had 30% of the market.

1685
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,405
Today, Apple has only 3.2%.

1686
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,962
That's it. John Sculley
has been fired from Apple.

1687
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,166
And what
about this internet thing?

1688
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,287
Do you know anything about that?

1689
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,602
Uh, it is the big, new thing.

1690
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,681
Rumors are flying around
Apple Computer once again,

1691
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,410
over who will
take over the helm.

1692
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,126
In the news at this hour, a
remarkable high-tech reunion.

1693
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,281
Well, it's happening.

1694
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,686
In a billion-dollar shake-up,

1695
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,808
Apple is purchasing
NeXT Computer's

1696
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,086
operating system,
which may mean...

1697
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,288
ls the prodigal
son returning? Bet on it.

1698
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,169
Guess what. Mac is back.

1699
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,771
Apple co-founder Steven Jobs...

1700
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,968
Steve Jobs... Steve Jobs...

1701
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,764
Steve Jobs
is returning to Apple.

1702
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,365
If you want to beam your digital
photographs from your digital camera,

1703
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,330
it's built into every product. We're
going to the new generation of I/O.

1704
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,841
12-megabyte USB. Two ports.

1705
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,361
We're leaving
the old Apple I/O behind.

1706
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,000
Stereo surround sound
built into every product.

1707
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:43,165
A great keyboard, and the
coolest mouse you've ever seen.

1708
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:47,202
This time, we used actual mice.

1709
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,290
We're opening the house
in 10 minutes. Steven?

1710
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,529
Do you want to stop
horsing around?

1711
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,005
Bless my eyes.

1712
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,971
That's Steve Wozniak,
sitting out there.

1713
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,523
Give yourselves
a treat and ask Woz

1714
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,931
if he happens to have
the correct time.

1715
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,085
I have the correct time,
and we're running out of it.

1716
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,241
"A great keyboard."

1717
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,204
A great keyboard and the coolest
mouse you've ever seen.

1718
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,563
This is what those things
look like today.

1719
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:19,248
And now, I'd like to show you what
they're going to look like tomorrow.

1720
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,081
This is the iMac.

1721
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,205
That was cool.

1722
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,204
Why did I like that
better than I usually do?

1723
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,362
I don't know.
Something was different.

1724
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,045
Hey, stupid!

1725
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,248
I think she's talking to one of you guys.

1726
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,488
- Did you notice a difference?
- That's what I'm...

1727
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,441
The exit signs were off.

1728
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,601
Full blackout.

1729
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,886
You did it!

1730
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,885
We wired all the exit
lights to our board.

1731
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,804
They go out with the cue
for seven seconds,

1732
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,120
then come back on again,
in theory.

1733
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,241
We think that's legal?

1734
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,050
No, we're very certain it's not.

1735
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:18,925
You want to see some quotes?

1736
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,048
Let's hold off on those.
No, he'll like them.

1737
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,281
I'll show them to you later.

1738
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,691
I'll take them now.

1739
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,641
I'm sorry.

1740
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:28,881
Pick it up from there, please.

1741
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,804
We only have a couple of minutes,
so let's just do the 360.

1742
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:35,168
We're going to bring out a
wireless camera we stole from Panasonic.

1743
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,243
I'll show you
what this looks like.

1744
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,085
The whole thing is translucent.
You can see into it.

1745
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,765
How's that
for a compromise, Woz?

1746
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,446
You still can't get into it,
but you can see into it.

1747
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,487
Fair enough.

1748
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,241
We put stereo speakers in
front, infrared right up here.

1749
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,004
CD-ROM drive in the middle.

1750
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,081
Nice.

1751
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,764
Dual stereo headphone jacks,

1752
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,365
and all the connectors
are inside

1753
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,885
one beautiful little door, here.

1754
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,368
Ethernet, USB.

1755
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,525
Even though this is a full-blooded
Macintosh, we're targeting it

1756
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,763
for the number-one use the consumers
tell us they want a computer for.

1757
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,331
- Which is...
- Let's hold it, please!

1758
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,601
Hold it.

1759
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,366
The answer was "the Internet."

1760
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,044
- Joanna?
- Yeah.

1761
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,086
Just stand in front of me.

1762
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,083
I want to look at these quotes,
but I don't want Joel to know.

1763
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,685
They're all great.

1764
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,885
"It is not only the coolest-looking
computer introduced in years,

1765
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,644
"but a chest-thumping statement

1766
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:34,282
"that Silicon Valley's original dream
company is no longer somnambulant."

1767
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,760
- It's a word. It means "sleepwalking."
- Steve?

1768
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,127
I'm sorry, we have to clear the house
if we're going to start on time.

1769
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,328
We're absolutely starting on time.
We're going to start on time.

1770
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,731
Here, take this.

1771
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:46,401
Everybody, that's it.

1772
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,051
They've got to mop the stage,
reset, and open the house.

1773
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,480
I love you guys.

1774
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,330
Andy, come on back a minute.

1775
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,641
- Which one?
- Hertzfeld.

1776
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,091
Forbes calls it
an industry-altering success.

1777
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,011
Look here.

1778
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,324
Why haven't we ever
slept together?

1779
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,611
We're not in love. Look.

1780
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,361
Sculley.

1781
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,931
Look what he said.

1782
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,010
"He has implemented
the same simple strategy

1783
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,845
"that made Apple so
successful 15 years ago.

1784
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,243
"Make hit products and promote
them with terrific marketing."

1785
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,726
That was nice of him.

1786
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,081
It was.

1787
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,287
I meant it.

1788
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:44,001
Sightings of J.D. Salinger are
more common than John Sculley.

1789
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,651
I wasn't being sarcastic.
It was nice of him.

1790
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,761
Do you talk to him?

1791
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:50,841
No.

1792
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,968
You haven't talked
to him since '88?

1793
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,565
I'd have told you if I did.

1794
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,726
Doesn't matter.

1795
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,370
I don't want people thinking
they can cross me

1796
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,962
and then, boom, 15 years
later, I'm cool with it.

1797
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,971
I was kidding.

1798
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,809
What's wrong with you
this morning?

1799
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,484
Let's get off the stage.

1800
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,564
"The only thing Apple's providing
now is leadership in colors."

1801
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,926
Don't worry about it.

1802
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,605
What does Bill Gates
have against me?

1803
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,922
I don't know. You're both
out of your minds.

1804
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,286
Listen to me.

1805
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,169
He dropped out of a better
school than I dropped out of.

1806
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,243
But he's a tool bag.
I'll tell you why.

1807
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,082
Make everything
all right with Lisa.

1808
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,402
- You know, Joanna?
- Boundaries.

1809
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:35,084
You've come to my apartment at 1:00 a.m.
and cleaned it.

1810
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,571
So tell me where
the boundary is.

1811
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,330
There. Let's say it's there.

1812
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,480
If I give you some
real projections,

1813
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,968
will you promise not to
repeat them from the stage?

1814
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,681
What do you mean,
"Real projections"?

1815
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,726
What have you been giving me?

1816
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,211
Conservative projections.

1817
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,965
Marketing's been lying to me?

1818
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:57,607
We've been managing expectations
so that you don't not.

1819
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,610
What are the real projections?

1820
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,287
We're going to sell a million
units in the first 90 days.

1821
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,604
20,000 a month after that.

1822
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,331
- Holy shit!
- Yeah.

1823
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,970
You see? You wait
long enough, and...

1824
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,043
What's more, 32% of the sales

1825
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:15,449
are going to go to people buying
a computer for the first time.

1826
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:20,168
And 12% are going to people using
some kind of Windows machine.

1827
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,210
That's what Bill Gates
has against you.

1828
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,410
And it'll be the fastest-selling
computer in history.

1829
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,169
You brought the company
back from life support

1830
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,245
after going through the misery
of laying off 3,000 people

1831
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,323
and cutting 70% of
the product line.

1832
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,481
So, Steven,

1833
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,890
it's over.

1834
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,244
You're going to win.

1835
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,406
It would be criminal
not to enjoy this moment.

1836
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,641
I'm enjoying it.

1837
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,171
Make things all right with Lisa.

1838
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,402
- You know...
- Come on.

1839
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,689
I don't like having less privacy
than other people have.

1840
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,885
Does being a multi-billionaire
take some of the sting off that?

1841
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,007
No.

1842
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,010
All Lisa did... All Lisa
did was give her blessing.

1843
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,923
Chrisann sold the house and...

1844
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,525
And Lisa could have done what?

1845
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,921
How was she supposed to stop her
mother from selling her own house?

1846
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,610
That I bought
for the two of them.

1847
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,091
How was she supposed
to stop her?

1848
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,447
Voicing an objection would have been
a step in the right direction.

1849
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,888
You don't think you're having
a bizarre overreaction

1850
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,851
to a 19-year-old girl allowing her
mother to list her own house?

1851
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,081
She could've tried.

1852
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,369
How is she supposed to stop her
mother, that particular mother...

1853
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,329
She gave Chrisann her
blessing to sell the house,

1854
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,640
and she did it to spite me!

1855
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:33,361
I don't care if she put a pipe
bomb in the water heater!

1856
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:36,086
You're going to fix it, now.

1857
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,369
She's been acting weird for months.
She's turned on me.

1858
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,564
- Fix it.
- What the...

1859
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,809
- Fix it, Steve.
- Take it easy!

1860
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,325
Fix it or I quit.
How about that?

1861
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:48,404
I quit and you never see me again.
How about that?

1862
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,407
Tell me what's wrong
with you this morning.

1863
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,606
What's been wrong
with me for 19 years.

1864
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:02,241
I've been a witness, and I
tell you I've been complicit.

1865
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,129
I love you, Steve.
You know how much.

1866
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,764
I love that you don't care how
much money a person makes,

1867
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,450
you care what they make.

1868
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:16,283
But what you make isn't supposed
to be the best part of you.

1869
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,529
When you're a father,

1870
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,007
that's what's supposed to be
the best part of you.

1871
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:26,608
And it's caused me two decades of
agony, Steve, that it is for you

1872
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,840
the worst.

1873
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,606
It's a little thing.
It's a very small thing.

1874
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,050
Fix it.

1875
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:45,282
Fix it now, or you can
contact me at my new job,

1876
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,204
working anywhere I want.

1877
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,368
I don't happen to think
it is a little deal.

1878
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,566
- She knew that...
- No.

1879
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,688
- I bought the house for the two of.
- No.

1880
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,802
What do you mean, "No"?
I mean, no.

1881
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,442
The house has nothing to do
with why you're angry at Lisa.

1882
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,363
I assure you,
the house has everything

1883
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,601
to do with why
I'm angry at Lisa.

1884
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:09,129
Have you ever heard the phrase
"reality distortion field"?

1885
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:10,727
Yes.

1886
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,406
As in, "Steve's
reality distortion field"?

1887
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,641
- I've heard it.
- I've read it.

1888
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,210
It's been sung
to me by Joan Baez.

1889
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,049
What you call
a reality distortion field,

1890
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,361
and I'm pretty sure you're the
one who coined the phrase,

1891
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:21,521
is the reason we're here.

1892
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,601
I know that.

1893
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,728
If I traded in my
bank account for a dollar

1894
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,609
every time somebody told me
something was impossible,

1895
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,727
I'd come out ahead.

1896
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,643
I know that, too.
What's the problem?

1897
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,484
My problem?
It sure isn't the house.

1898
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,561
Jo, I...

1899
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:37,009
It's that you told her you weren't
going to pay for Harvard.

1900
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:41,484
That child. That
earnest, un-ironic kid.

1901
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,409
She told you I wasn't
paying her tuition?

1902
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,960
I should have hit you with
something heavy a long time ago.

1903
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,805
Lisa told you I wasn't
paying her tuition?

1904
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,008
Andy told me that.

1905
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,241
Which one?

1906
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,445
Hertzfeld.

1907
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,525
How would Hertzfeld know?

1908
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,924
He wrote Harvard a check for
$25,000 to cover the semester.

1909
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,525
Are you fucking...

1910
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,761
He paid her tuition?

1911
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,601
Isn't that why you
just asked to see him?

1912
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,170
No, I asked to see him
about something...

1913
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,846
Did you tell her you weren't
going to pay for college?

1914
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,489
Yes, because...
How could you do that?

1915
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:16,609
Because her mother,
who is also her landlord...

1916
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,728
Hertzfeld? I was ranting!

1917
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,366
I was just talking!
You think I would...

1918
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,283
I was pissed off because Lisa was
trying to piss me off, Joanna.

1919
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,124
That was her intent!

1920
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,089
You obviously scared
the hell out of her!

1921
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:32,642
- Hertzfeld wrote a check to Harvard.
- Pay for...

1922
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,081
Is she here yet?

1923
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,201
I'm sure she is.

1924
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,561
Can you have someone
bring her back?

1925
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,201
Yes.

1926
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:42,921
Thank you.

1927
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,806
You know,

1928
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,484
my grandmother always
used to say to me...

1929
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:53,244
I don't give a shit, Yentl.

1930
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,602
I'll have someone get Lisa.
Thank you.

1931
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,921
And if you see Hertzfeld...

1932
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,401
It's Andy!

1933
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,162
Speak of
the devil's chief engineer.

1934
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,930
Go. Come on in.

1935
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,083
You look great today.

1936
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,685
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she?

1937
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,763
She looks fantastic.
Always does.

1938
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:16,921
Get out.

1939
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,844
Well, I think I know
why I'm here.

1940
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,764
- Do you?
- Steve...

1941
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,285
Did you send the check yet?

1942
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,441
Yes.

1943
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,683
So Harvard got a tuition check from
Andy Hertzfeld to pay for Lisa?

1944
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,644
I don't think
they look that carefully.

1945
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,491
I don't think they'd notice the
check didn't come from you.

1946
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,761
Close one.

1947
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,450
This was almost
embarrassing for me.

1948
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,608
I understand how... I'll
wire you the money today.

1949
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:43,526
I understand how you feel.
And I do apologize, I do.

1950
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,728
But, let me tell you
my thinking.

1951
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:48,281
I can't even think of an appropriate
analogy to describe what you did.

1952
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,841
I knew you guys would fix things.
You always do.

1953
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,923
But in the meantime,
if the money wasn't there,

1954
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,729
she'd miss a semester of school.

1955
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,767
Yeah.

1956
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,888
And she'd have to
tell her friends why.

1957
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,927
And she needed things.
She needed socks.

1958
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,047
What?

1959
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:05,124
It's cold in Cambridge.
She needed warm socks.

1960
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,481
You gave her socks?

1961
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,962
Well, I gave her money
for socks.

1962
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,845
You don't get to deputize
yourself as her interim.

1963
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:15,687
You don't get to override my decisions.
Do you understand?

1964
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,081
You don't get to act
like you're her father.

1965
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,685
Somebody had to.

1966
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,482
What the fuck did you
just say to me?

1967
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:25,211
I've known her
since she was six.

1968
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,323
I also consider...

1969
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,491
Chrisann's my friend,
outside of what you and I...

1970
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,842
Outside of our relationship.

1971
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,240
So you're like a family advisor.

1972
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,560
I'm a family friend.

1973
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:39,246
Then you probably know that
Lisa's been seeing a therapist.

1974
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,441
Yeah.

1975
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,726
- For many years.
- Yeah.

1976
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:42,881
Without my knowledge.

1977
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,684
That really wasn't my business.

1978
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,009
I'm fascinated by what you
think is and isn't your business.

1979
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,890
Lisa's been going to a
therapist, and she likes it.

1980
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,686
And would love for you and
Chrisann to go with her.

1981
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,361
And the reason
you know that is because

1982
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,204
you're the one that
recommended the therapist.

1983
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,726
Well, I know a guy.

1984
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,049
No, I mean you're the one who
recommended that she see a therapist.

1985
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,281
You know what?

1986
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,803
It was a while ago, and I don't
remember how the whole...

1987
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,884
You told Chrisann that Lisa
should see a therapist.

1988
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,964
Steve, you're stigmatizing.
It's a perfectly norm...

1989
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,489
It's not... My thing was,
how can it hurt?

1990
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,766
Let's find out.

1991
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,761
Chrisann is my friend.

1992
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:29,887
What was the reason you gave?

1993
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,327
You mean...

1994
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:36,246
What was the reason you gave Chrisann
why Lisa should see a therapist?

1995
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,641
I don't remember. We were
talking and I said...

1996
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,960
It's pretty much
what I just said,

1997
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,405
that it certainly couldn't hurt.

1998
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,564
You didn't say that Lisa needed
a strong male role model?

1999
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,161
I did.

2000
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,163
I think it's a miracle
she's not robbing banks

2001
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,083
with the Symbionese
Liberation Army.

2002
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:14,285
There is no reason in the
world why she should be nice.

2003
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,486
But she is.

2004
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,285
So I helped.

2005
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,010
Because somebody had to.

2006
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:33,051
I'll wire the money
to you this afternoon.

2007
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,281
You threatened me
a long time ago.

2008
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,121
Sorry?

2009
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,046
A long time ago,
you threatened me once.

2010
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,728
People are attracted
to people with talent.

2011
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,529
People without it
find that threatening.

2012
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,684
Maybe you should see a therapist.
Certainly couldn't hurt.

2013
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,806
I meant you literally
threatened me.

2014
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,247
At Flint,
right before the Mac launch.

2015
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,926
I was recompiling . I was
trying to debug the voice demo.

2016
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,241
And you said if I couldn't
find a solution,

2017
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,163
you'd call me out
in front of the audience.

2018
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:16,685
Did it say "hello"?

2019
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:17,841
It did.

2020
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,002
No need to thank me.

2021
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,760
Why do you want people
to dislike you?

2022
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,651
I don't want people
to dislike me.

2023
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,686
I'm indifferent to whether
they dislike me.

2024
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:35,485
Since it doesn't matter,
I always have.

2025
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,126
Really?

2026
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,209
I've always liked you a lot.

2027
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,127
That's too bad.

2028
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,005
Knock 'em dead.

2029
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,321
Thank you.

2030
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,928
What is remarkable, what's
hard to fathom but true

2031
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,970
is that for a given
clock rate, a PowerPC chip

2032
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,970
is twice as fast
as a Pentium II chip.

2033
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:41,169
In other words,
a 266 megahertz G3 chip

2034
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:46,360
is twice as fast
as a 266 megahertz Pentium II.

2035
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,926
Or...

2036
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,770
a 266 G3 is equal to
about 500 megahertz.

2037
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:05,166
Take a look at BYTE magazine's BYTE
Marks, the gold standard for any...

2038
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,681
Come in.

2039
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,727
I sent someone into the lobby.
They found her and she...

2040
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:21,881
Where is she?

2041
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,441
She said she'd rather
not come back.

2042
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:25,567
Why?

2043
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,161
That was it.

2044
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,170
I'm going out there myself.
You can't.

2045
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,686
You can't. It'll be a scene
out of Hard Day's Night.

2046
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:35,721
Excuse me?

2047
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,041
Hey, Joel.

2048
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:38,924
Andy said it was okay
to come back.

2049
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,125
- Which one?
- Andy Cunningham.

2050
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,766
I can't do this forever.

2051
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,410
I need one of them
to change their name.

2052
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,482
You call
Andy Cunningham "Andrea."

2053
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:48,880
It doesn't matter
what I call them.

2054
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,604
I know who I'm talking about
when I'm talking.

2055
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,648
I need everyone else to
call them different names.

2056
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,691
Give me one second.

2057
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,048
Can you go get her
for me, please?

2058
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:04,484
I just talked to Andy Hertzfeld.

2059
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:08,003
I'm just trying to scrub this
out of my brain with Drano.

2060
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,163
But I do want to talk to Lisa.

2061
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,050
Okay, just...

2062
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,367
- Stay cool.
- Okay.

2063
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,921
Thank you.

2064
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,241
Hey, Steve.

2065
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,367
How are you feeling?

2066
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,323
I'm feeling good, Joel.
How about you?

2067
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,086
I don't think I could be in your business.
It changes too quickly.

2068
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,083
Well, I'd hang on,
'cause yours is about to

2069
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,446
start changing
pretty quickly, too.

2070
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,729
This is the third time in 14
years I'm writing about you.

2071
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:55,771
What do you think so far?

2072
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:58,480
Excuse me.

2073
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,524
Uh, Avie's looking for you.
He has a new shark.

2074
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,886
Want to come backstage
for a second?

2075
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,041
Sure.

2076
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,561
Who's this one?

2077
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,926
Alan Turing.

2078
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:11,724
Single-handedly won
World War II and,

2079
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,484
for an encore,
invented the computer.

2080
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,005
He won't be part of
the campaign, though.

2081
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,081
Why not?

2082
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,367
Because you just had
to ask me who he was.

2083
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,444
Can I see new shark?

2084
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,602
- I like it better than the old shark.
- Sharks.

2085
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,721
Sharks.

2086
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:28,926
How many sharks
did you go through?

2087
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,480
- A couple.
- This is the 39th.

2088
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,206
We're on the record.

2089
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:35,210
Thirty-nine sharks.

2090
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,441
Okay.

2091
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,528
You know what's special
about this shark? What?

2092
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,807
No, I'm really asking,
because it looks exactly

2093
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,962
like the other 38 sharks to me.

2094
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,963
Let me see it with the cue.
From the profile.

2095
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,884
This is Cue 92-B.

2096
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,883
This is a profile here.

2097
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,970
And this is what
it looks like from the back.

2098
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:54,881
And one more thing . It eats Pentium
notebooks as a light snack.

2099
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,724
This is the shark.

2100
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,241
I really like it.

2101
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,601
Nobody gets it right
the first time,

2102
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:05,326
but I should have been shown
this shark 15, 20 fish ago.

2103
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,481
You probably were.

2104
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:07,766
Lock it in.

2105
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:08,921
10 minutes.

2106
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:12,847
He killed himself by taking a bite
of a poison apple. Alan Turing.

2107
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:17,201
Yeah. There should be
statues of that man.

2108
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,648
His name should be on the
lips of schoolchildren.

2109
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,927
The rainbow flag Apple
with a bite taken out.

2110
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,365
That's where it came from?

2111
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,171
No, we picked it off a list
of friendly-sounding words.

2112
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:29,329
But wouldn't it be great if that
had been the story behind it?

2113
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,526
Steve.

2114
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,600
Kinda liked the last shark.

2115
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:33,886
Fuck you.

2116
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,085
I wanted to ask you a favor.

2117
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,851
My friend, a long time ago,

2118
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,566
you asked me a favor before a
product launch, and I said no.

2119
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:41,846
- You wanted me to acknowledge.
- Hang on.

2120
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,204
If you're about to say
you were wrong,

2121
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,521
I want to prepare
this journalist.

2122
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,411
I was 100% right.

2123
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,006
And you were
spectacularly wrong.

2124
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,168
But I still owe you a
favor, so name it.

2125
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,601
Steve.

2126
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,091
But it can't be about acknowledging
the Apple II team.

2127
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,525
Acknowledge the Apple II team.

2128
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:01,401
How about in private?

2129
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,130
- No. No.
- Is this a prank?

2130
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,681
Because I'm trying to remember
that a 300 megahertz G3 chip...

2131
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,489
Just the top guys.

2132
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:10,881
Steve.

2133
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,529
- Excuse me, okay?
- Yep.

2134
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,840
One second.

2135
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,206
She said she'd rather not.

2136
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:25,646
What do you mean?

2137
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,330
She's sitting with her friends,

2138
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,164
and she said she'd
rather not come back.

2139
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,367
Okay. Tell her...

2140
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:31,686
Take her aside, I don't want to

2141
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,046
embarrass her
in front of her friends,

2142
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,566
but tell her I just scared
the shit out of Andy,

2143
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,961
and this time, nobody's
paying her fucking...

2144
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,089
- All right.
- Don't say that.

2145
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,766
But do your thing, where
you sound old and wise

2146
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,924
because of the broad, tragic
European canvas of your life.

2147
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,845
You know I wasn't born in a
19th century shtetl, right?

2148
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,968
Please tell her it's important.

2149
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,368
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

2150
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,171
There are people
around here, man,

2151
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:57,520
including a member of the press.

2152
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,601
I see him.

2153
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:01,841
Woz.

2154
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:04,281
Just the top guys, the ones
who are getting laid off.

2155
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:12,086
Listen, okay? Last year, Apple
lost one billion dollars.

2156
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,929
I don't even know
how that's possible.

2157
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,606
You were less than 90 days
from being insolvent.

2158
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:20,763
I had three different accountants
try to explain it to me.

2159
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:23,242
The whole place has
to be streamlined.

2160
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,362
Start with two of the accountants.
I started with the...

2161
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,930
Joel, could you come off-stage?

2162
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,048
We're going to go backstage.
Leave him right there.

2163
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,448
I started with the Apple II team
because we don't make that anymore.

2164
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,210
Just acknowledge the top guys.

2165
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,250
Have a mimosa and relax.

2166
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,563
You will not blow me off
right now, Steve!

2167
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:40,846
The top guys...

2168
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,530
There are no top guys.
All right?

2169
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,762
On the Apple II team,
there are no top guys.

2170
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,086
They're B players.

2171
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,527
And B players discourage
the A players.

2172
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,409
And I want A players
at Apple, and not Dell.

2173
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,483
They're not B players, and
I'm a better judge of that!

2174
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,122
Less than 90 days
from insolvency.

2175
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,886
In part, because somebody thought
the Newton wasn't a box of garbage.

2176
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,565
Joel, could you come off stage please?
Leave him!

2177
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:01,687
I'm talking about...

2178
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:04,570
You guys designed and shipped a little
box of garbage while I was gone.

2179
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,449
I'm talking about the Apple II!

2180
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,171
Which is not just a crucial
part of this company's history,

2181
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,811
it is a crucial part of the
history of personal computing!

2182
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:13,325
For a time.

2183
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:16,211
The least you can do, if you're
going to downsize these people...

2184
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:17,691
They're going to live in the
biggest houses of anyone

2185
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,091
on the unemployment line.

2186
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,161
...is to acknowledge them!

2187
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,490
Acknowledge them and the
Apple II during this launch!

2188
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,170
This is a new animal.

2189
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,328
This whole place
was built by the Apple II.

2190
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,851
You were built by the Apple II.

2191
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,411
As a matter of fact,
I was destroyed

2192
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,925
by the Apple II
and its open system,

2193
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,528
so that hackers and hobbyists could
build ham radios, or something!

2194
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,124
And then,
it nearly destroyed Apple

2195
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,004
when you spent
all your money on it

2196
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:43,566
and developed a grand total
of no new products.

2197
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,330
The Newton.
The little box of garbage.

2198
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,090
You guys came up
with the Newton.

2199
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,447
You, like,
want people to know that?

2200
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:55,444
This is a product launch,
not a luncheon.

2201
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,888
And the last thing I want to
do is connect the iMac to...

2202
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:01,010
To the only successful product
that this company has ever made.

2203
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:04,283
I'm sorry to be blunt, but
that happens to be the truth.

2204
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:07,205
The Lisa was a failure.
The Macintosh was a failure.

2205
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,368
I don't like talking like this,

2206
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:14,161
but I am tired of being Ringo
when I know I was John.

2207
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,526
Everybody loves Ringo.

2208
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:19,171
And I'm tired of
being patronized by you!

2209
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:24,086
You think John became John
by winning a raffle, Woz?

2210
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:25,650
You think he tricked somebody,

2211
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,848
or hit George Harrison
over the head?

2212
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,889
He was John because he was John.

2213
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,691
He was John because he
wrote Ticket to Ride.

2214
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,330
And I wrote the Apple II.

2215
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,401
Everybody?

2216
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,568
I want to clear the auditorium.
Nobody moves!

2217
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,721
You made a beautiful board
which, by the way,

2218
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,881
you were willing to
give out for free,

2219
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:46,167
so don't tell me
how you built Apple.

2220
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,721
If it weren't for me, you'd be the
easiest "A" at Homestead High School.

2221
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,964
These people live and die by your
praise, so here's your chance.

2222
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,600
Acknowledge that
something good happened

2223
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:57,842
that you weren't
in the room for.

2224
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,362
- No.
- Steve!

2225
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,681
Do it.

2226
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,648
It's right. It's...

2227
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,170
It's right.

2228
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,250
Sorry, but no.

2229
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,762
Then let me put it another way.

2230
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,041
I don't think there's a man
who's done more

2231
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,168
to advance the
democratization that comes

2232
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,322
with personal computing
than I have,

2233
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,330
but you've never had any respect for me.
Now why is that?

2234
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,489
I'd at least consider
the possibility

2235
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:31,403
that it's because you've
never had any for me.

2236
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,603
What the hell is going on here?

2237
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:37,121
Nothing.

2238
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,845
Thank you for your time.

2239
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,164
- It's done.
- She's coming back.

2240
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,089
You came a half-inch from putting
this company out of business.

2241
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,209
Now, who do I see about that?

2242
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,361
I'm letting you keep your job.

2243
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,131
You get a pass.

2244
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:01,725
You know,
when people used to ask me

2245
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:04,121
what the difference was
between me and Steve Jobs,

2246
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:07,329
I would say Steve
was the big-picture guy

2247
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,129
and I liked a solid workbench.

2248
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,250
When people ask me what the
difference is now, I say

2249
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,731
Steve's an asshole.

2250
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:16,525
Your products are better
than you are, brother.

2251
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,888
That's the idea, "brother."

2252
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:22,363
And knowing that,
that's the difference.

2253
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,481
It's not binary.

2254
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:29,602
You can be decent and gifted
at the same time.

2255
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,085
He didn't mean it.

2256
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,130
Yeah, he did.

2257
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,043
He's a temperamental guy.

2258
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:02,851
No, he's not.

2259
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:10,130
It's like, five minutes
before every launch,

2260
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,850
everyone goes to a bar,
gets drunk,

2261
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,888
and tells me
what they really think.

2262
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:16,889
She's coming
to your dressing room.

2263
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,321
I told you to make
things all right with Lisa.

2264
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:33,609
I didn't say you had to settle
every blood feud you have.

2265
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:37,321
The last time blood feuds weren't
settled, I lost the cover of Time.

2266
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,404
Though, for the life of me,
I still don't know

2267
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:41,209
what the hell Dan Kottke
was mad at me about.

2268
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,009
Kottke didn't lose you
the cover of Time.

2269
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:44,161
Of course he did.

2270
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:46,766
Would you like me to demonstrate
your capacity to be wrong

2271
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:47,966
when you're certain
you're right?

2272
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:50,725
Dan Kottke told Time magazine
that I was denying...

2273
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,290
Do you remember the cover?

2274
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,361
Of Time?

2275
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,566
- Yes.
- Yes.

2276
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:55,687
What was it?

2277
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:56,966
What are you talking about?

2278
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,121
What was on the cover?

2279
01:42:58,200 --> 01:42:59,201
A computer.

2280
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,566
No, it was a sculpture
of a computer.

2281
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,290
It was a sculpture.

2282
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,410
Time would have had to have
commissioned it months in advance.

2283
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,927
You were never in the
conversation for Man of the Year.

2284
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:12,565
Nobody lost you anything.

2285
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,289
So, what else
are you sure about?

2286
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,602
I don't know how
I could've missed that.

2287
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,606
Reality distortion.

2288
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:23,609
- No, seriously.
- Seriously.

2289
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,287
Don't try to win
an argument with Lisa.

2290
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:27,726
Just say you were wrong.

2291
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,246
Come on in, honey!

2292
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,767
It's not "honey."

2293
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,447
John! Get in, get in.
Get out of the hall.

2294
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,841
I was taken in the side entrance.
I'll go out the same way.

2295
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,968
No one will see me.
How are you, Joanna?

2296
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:45,602
I'm good, John. I'm
just surprised to see you.

2297
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,286
Everyone here really appreciates
the quote you gave to Forbes.

2298
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:49,771
You didn't have to do that.

2299
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,206
My pleasure.

2300
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,411
If you want, I can slip you in
the back once the house lights go out.

2301
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:57,006
I'm just here
to say "good luck." Okay.

2302
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,530
You just have
a couple of minutes.

2303
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:01,601
Would you try to find...

2304
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:02,681
Yeah.

2305
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,210
You're a good man, John.

2306
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,842
So, I brought you a present.

2307
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,121
The Newton.

2308
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,128
If you don't take it out of the
box, you'll be able to sell it.

2309
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:31,163
Which is more than I can say.

2310
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,845
Everything all right there?

2311
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,368
- What? No.
- Yeah.

2312
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:39,490
Just something
Joanna pointed out to me.

2313
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,529
I missed something
so obvious about...

2314
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,161
It doesn't matter.

2315
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,962
Look, Wall Street's gonna sit back
and wait to see how you do as CEO,

2316
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:52,964
so don't let any fluctuation bother
you for the first 12 months.

2317
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,883
Day traders are gonna respond.

2318
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,725
I don't need to school you.

2319
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,607
Is this your way of telling me I
shouldn't have killed the Newton?

2320
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,729
The most efficient animal on
the planet is the condor.

2321
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,931
The most inefficient animals
on the planet are humans.

2322
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,771
Well, you shouldn't
have killed it for spite.

2323
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,723
That's bad business.
Don't do that.

2324
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:19,728
But a human with a bicycle becomes
the most efficient animal.

2325
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,243
And the right computer...

2326
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,449
A friendly, easy computer
that isn't an eyesore,

2327
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:29,081
but rather sits on your desk with
the beauty of a tensor lamp,

2328
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:33,129
the right computer will be
a bicycle for the mind.

2329
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,406
Do you like it?

2330
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,090
I was given back.

2331
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:43,885
And what if, instead of it
being in the right hands,

2332
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,042
it was in everyone's hands?

2333
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,089
Everyone in the world.

2334
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,730
We'd be talking about the most
tectonic shift in the status quo since...

2335
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,801
Ever.

2336
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:56,966
I don't know why you've always been
interested in my adoption history,

2337
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:01,011
but you said, it's not like someone
looked at me and gave me back.

2338
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:02,800
But that is what happened.

2339
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,281
You're telling me
you have the right computer?

2340
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,601
It's called Macintosh.

2341
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:10,968
A lawyer couple
adopted me first,

2342
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:13,168
then gave me back after a month.

2343
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,490
They changed their mind.

2344
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:20,327
Then my parents adopted me.

2345
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:23,205
My biological mother had
stipulated that whoever took me

2346
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:26,489
had to be college-educated,
wealthy, and Catholic.

2347
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,167
Paul and Clara Jobs
were none of those things,

2348
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:33,450
so my biological mother wouldn't
sign the adoption papers.

2349
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,041
What happened?

2350
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:37,805
There was a legal battle
that went on for a while.

2351
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:41,330
My mother said she refused to
love me for the first year.

2352
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:43,530
You know, in case
they had to give me back.

2353
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,561
You can't refuse to
love someone, Steve.

2354
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:49,041
Yeah, it turns out you can.

2355
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,684
What the hell can
a one-month-old do

2356
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,569
that's so bad that his
parents give him back?

2357
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:56,564
There's nothing
a one-month-old can do.

2358
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:59,809
Have you ever thought about trying
to find your biological father?

2359
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,644
I've met my biological father.

2360
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:03,006
For that matter, so have you.

2361
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:07,966
It's called Macintosh.

2362
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,451
Mr. Steve Jobs!

2363
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,761
Jandali.
Say hello to John Sculley.

2364
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,205
Jandali owns the place,

2365
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:15,765
and John's the CEO of Pepsi,

2366
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,444
but I'm trying to get him
to move to Cupertino.

2367
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,010
Put a dent in the universe.

2368
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,920
You eat vegan as well?

2369
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,561
You're kidding me.

2370
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:23,881
No, I'll eat anything.

2371
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:25,166
Why don't you start us off with

2372
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,527
the Mediterranean lettuce
salad with purslane, mint...

2373
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,525
My sister found him.

2374
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:32,921
Does he know?

2375
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,445
No. In fact, he bragged to Mona

2376
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,887
that Steve Jobs comes in the
restaurant all the time.

2377
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,682
- You don't want to...
- No.

2378
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,362
Don't you think
you should talk to him?

2379
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,362
He'd probably find
a reason to sue me.

2380
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:48,891
Oh, Steve...

2381
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:52,291
John, if you're here
about your legacy,

2382
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,289
you need to form
a line behind Wozniak.

2383
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:58,840
Wozniak's gonna be fine.
I'm the guy who fired Steve Jobs.

2384
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:02,889
"Rich, college-educated,
and Catholic."

2385
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:06,567
Steve, it's time.

2386
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,089
I've gotta go.

2387
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,603
- Did I do this?
- Screw it up?

2388
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,809
Let's let it go now.

2389
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,241
It has to be time.

2390
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:34,247
Come be our CEO.

2391
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:37,280
Yeah, okay.

2392
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,522
It was the stylus, John.

2393
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:50,567
What?

2394
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,961
I killed the Newton
because of the stylus.

2395
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:54,926
If you're holding a stylus,

2396
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,287
you can't use the other five
that are attached to your wrist.

2397
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,811
Things we could have
done together.

2398
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,329
God, the things
we could've done.

2399
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,845
I'm paying your tuition.

2400
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,168
Are you crazy? Of course
I'm paying your tuition.

2401
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:34,802
I must have misunderstood you when you
said you weren't paying my tuition.

2402
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,440
You and your mom selling the
house was a hostile thing to do.

2403
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,010
She needed the money.

2404
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:40,811
She always needs the money.

2405
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:44,164
She needs a doctor.
She has a sinus infection.

2406
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:48,447
She's had the same
sinus infection since 1988.

2407
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,890
I'm gonna take care of my mother.
I'm sorry if that angers you.

2408
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:53,849
It does anger me,
because you're a kid

2409
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:56,088
and it's not your job
to take care of your mother.

2410
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:57,844
Is that how yours died?

2411
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:01,409
Guys, um, step away, please.
Give them some room.

2412
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:06,690
When your mom is 90 and can't feed
herself, you can take care of her.

2413
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:11,368
But right now, she's 45, perfectly
healthy, and can't feed herself.

2414
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:15,522
You're supposed to work hard at
school and be 19, and that's it.

2415
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,047
I'll take care of your mother.

2416
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,531
Well, keep up the good work.

2417
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:20,927
What the hell do you want from me?
I was sent for.

2418
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,441
I bought her
a house for $400,000.

2419
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,329
It's worth twice
that much today!

2420
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,767
She sold it for two magic
rocks and a bowl of soup.

2421
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,006
It was her house.

2422
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,844
She used that money
to travel through Europe.

2423
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,285
Money which you
make her beg for.

2424
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:34,727
- Steve...
- Don't even start with that.

2425
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,168
Going to Andy
and asking for the money?

2426
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,480
That was so off-the-charts
over the line...

2427
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,607
I did not do that.

2428
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:40,841
Andy came to me.

2429
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,289
Everybody have an opinion
on this?

2430
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:48,125
I'm sorry, guys. In 30 seconds,
you're going to be late.

2431
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:50,248
She spends
the money on antiques,

2432
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,641
and then sells them for
a fraction of what she paid.

2433
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:55,007
And she does it with money
I gave to her for you!

2434
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:56,081
Steve...

2435
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:57,810
You came to me hysterical
when you were 13,

2436
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,046
asking if you could
live with me...

2437
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,326
I was not hysterical.

2438
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,811
...because your mom was
screaming at you every day.

2439
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,922
And 13 was the second
time I asked you.

2440
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:05,565
The stress of her life
as a spiritual healer.

2441
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:09,520
I don't believe I said you're a bad guy.
But if I did, I am sorry.

2442
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,603
Something happened
to you at school.

2443
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:20,647
Some first semester core class that
all freshmen are required to take...

2444
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,086
I read Time.

2445
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:23,601
What?

2446
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,131
I have Internet access
at school.

2447
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,446
I read an old copy of Time,

2448
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,649
and I asked my mom some questions
about my family history.

2449
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:35,329
That was... Time wrote
a mangled piece of journal.

2450
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,680
You were never
supposed to read that.

2451
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,842
I had two different
Harvard statisticians

2452
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,200
try to reverse-engineer
the equation

2453
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:43,329
that you came up with
to prove that 28%

2454
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:45,289
of American men
could be my father!

2455
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,801
Honey, I...

2456
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,724
You know, my mother might
be a troubled woman,

2457
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,290
but what's your excuse?

2458
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,886
That's why I'm not impressed
with your story, Dad!

2459
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:56,201
It's that you knew
what I was going through,

2460
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:57,964
and you didn't do
anything about it.

2461
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:01,766
And that makes you
an unconscionable coward.

2462
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,204
And not for nothing, but
"think" is a verb, all right?

2463
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,446
Making "different" an adverb.

2464
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,568
You're asking people
to think differently,

2465
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:11,371
and you can talk about the
Bauhaus movement and Braun

2466
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:14,563
and "Simplicity is sophistication,"
and Issey Miyake uniforms,

2467
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:17,763
and Bob Dylan lyrics all
you want, but that thing

2468
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:21,211
looks like Judy Jetson's
Easy-Bake oven.

2469
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,167
Hey!

2470
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,524
Oh, gee,
you're gonna start late.

2471
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:45,246
You know what "Lisa" stood for?

2472
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:46,361
What?

2473
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,323
The computer. The Lisa. Do
you know what it stood for?

2474
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:51,563
I'm sorry I said that about the iMac.
It's not what I really think.

2475
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,166
Behind my back, at the office,
you know what it stood for?

2476
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,330
Local Integrated
System Architecture.

2477
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:00,290
I was five!
Why couldn't you just lie?

2478
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:01,361
I did.

2479
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,563
Of course it was named
after you.

2480
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:08,681
"Local Integrated System Architecture"
doesn't even mean anything.

2481
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,525
Why'd you say it wasn't
all those years?

2482
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,371
I honestly don't know.

2483
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,202
Why'd you say
you aren't my father?

2484
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,689
I'm poorly made.

2485
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:36,249
It's after 9:00,
you're gonna be late.

2486
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,731
I don't care.

2487
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,283
You're writing for the Crimson.
What?

2488
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,602
The Apple chapter of the
Harvard Alumni Association

2489
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:49,205
tells me you're writing
for the Crimson.

2490
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,722
Oh, yeah,
a little bit. Essays...

2491
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:53,926
I'd like to read one.

2492
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:55,807
Sure.

2493
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,968
No, I mean now. I'd like to
read one of your essays now.

2494
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:00,122
Come on,
you've got to go on stage.

2495
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:05,050
The iMac will not be launched until
you give me one of your essays,

2496
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:08,044
so the world is waiting for you.

2497
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:17,887
I'm really sorry, guys!

2498
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:19,721
Good luck.

2499
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,610
Gonna put music in your pocket.

2500
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:35,921
What?

2501
01:54:38,440 --> 01:54:42,445
100 songs.
1,000 songs. 500 songs.

2502
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:46,770
Somewhere between 500 and 1,000
songs, right in your pocket,

2503
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:50,322
because I can't stand looking at
that inexplicable Walkman anymore.

2504
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:52,642
You're carrying around a brick
playing a cassette tape.

2505
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:54,445
We're not savages.

2506
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,966
So I'm gonna put
1,000 songs in your pocket.

2507
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:58,926
You can do that?

2508
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,161
Mmm-hmm.

2509
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,649
You want to watch
from backstage?

2510
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:15,847
Okay.

2511
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,001
Go, Cue 1.

2512
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:34,731
You remember that painting
you did on the original Mac?

2513
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:38,601
I do.

2514
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:43,606
Ladies and gentlemen,

2515
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,888
Steve Jobs.

2516
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,041
Woz.

2517
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:32,966
Whoo!
