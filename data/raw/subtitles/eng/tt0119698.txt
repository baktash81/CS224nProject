Yakul!

8
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:51,731
Ashitaka!

9
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:55,546
Oracle says to get back to the village.

10
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:57,478
The Old Man, too.

11
00:01:57,582 --> 00:02:00,176
- He says something's wrong.
- No birds.

12
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:01,240
No animals...

13
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:06,016
I'll go to him. You get back home.

14
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:45,920
Something's coming!

15
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,136
What is it?

16
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,639
It's not a person...

17
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,939
Oracle's called everyone in.

18
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:02,078
There!

19
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:33,405
A demon god!

20
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,631
Yakul, run!

21
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:23,953
It'll attack the village!

22
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:25,756
Ashitaka!

23
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:29,299
Don't touch it! Its
curse will be on you!

24
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,532
Yakul!

25
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,850
Quiet your rage, I beg you!

26
00:04:56,961 --> 00:05:01,728
O forest god who cannot be without
name, why do you rampage so?

27
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:20,716
- A monster!
- Run!

28
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,255
Stop! Do not destroy our village!

29
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,256
Stop! Still your rage!

30
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:32,956
Get up!

31
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,947
- It's down!
- Ashitaka!

32
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,182
Bring Oracle!

33
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:33,450
Watch the fire!

34
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:36,252
Ashitaka!

35
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,365
Don't touch it! It's no ordinary wound!

36
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:45,425
He's hurt! Where's Oracle?!

37
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:48,198
All of you, stay back!

38
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:49,832
Oracle!

39
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:53,308
Rour this water over it... slowly.

40
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,749
O raging god unknown to us...

41
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:13,661
...I bow before you.

42
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:19,327
Where you have fallen we will
raise a mound and perform rites.

43
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:22,167
Bear us no hate, and be at peace.

44
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:27,073
You loathsome rabble!

45
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,015
You shall know my hatred and my grief!

46
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:14,589
This is very, very bad.

47
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:18,594
The boar-spirit came
from far to the west.

48
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:22,758
A poison within him goaded
him on, rotting his fesh...

49
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:28,829
...drawing evil as he ran,
making a monster of him.

50
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,176
Rrince Ashitaka...

51
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:34,909
Show your right arm.

52
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:44,410
Oracle!

53
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:50,717
Rrince Ashitaka, are you
steeled to gaze upon your fate?

54
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:54,457
Yes. I was resolved
when I let my arrow fy.

55
00:08:56,768 --> 00:09:01,000
The scar will seep into
your bones and you will die.

56
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,972
Can nothing be done?!

57
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:11,413
He was defending the
girls, and the village!

58
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,677
Can we but sit and wait?

59
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,012
You cannot change your fate.

60
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:21,525
You can, though, rise to meet it.

61
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:23,083
Look.

62
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:28,088
This was inside the boar's body.

63
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:34,204
He was in agony. It shattered
his bones, tore at his entrails...

64
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:38,106
What else could have made him that way?

65
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,076
Calamity has befallen
the land of the west.

66
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:47,777
<i>Journey there, and see
with eyes unclouded.</i>

67
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:52,187
There might be a way to lift the curse.

68
00:09:54,359 --> 00:10:01,162
More than 500 years have gone since
the Mikado drove us into this land.

69
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:04,998
Now we hear how his power fades...

70
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:08,835
...and the fangs of
his Shoguns are broken.

71
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:13,570
But the blood of our
tribe likewise grows thin.

72
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:19,209
And now, bitter fate... the youth
who was one day to lead us...

73
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:22,481
...must journey far to the west.

74
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:42,729
The law forbids that we
watch as you go. Farewell.

75
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:13,896
Brother!

76
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:16,132
Kaya, you can't be here!

77
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:20,642
I don't care. Remember me by this.

78
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,383
But it's your jeweled dagger!

79
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:30,484
Keep it with you to guard you.

80
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:35,117
I'll think of you... be sure of that.

81
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:38,457
As will I, Kaya.

82
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:09,247
Fighting?

83
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:18,986
Move up!

84
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,793
A warrior!

85
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,892
His head is mine!

86
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:37,708
Stop!

87
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,618
My arm!

88
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,260
Don't let him get away!

89
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,829
Let me pass!

90
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,269
A demon!

91
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:25,461
The scar's growing...

92
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:39,537
This gruel tastes like hot water!

93
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:45,705
There he is!

94
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:53,451
Will this do?

95
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,651
This isn't money!

96
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:58,022
Give back my rice!

97
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:01,087
Could I see that, please?

98
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,328
Hm?!

99
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:07,531
Woman, this is pure gold!

100
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:12,001
Is it coins you want? I'll pay you.

101
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,304
Give me this.

102
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:17,641
Is there a money-changer here?

103
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:19,842
No?

104
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:25,746
I'm just a simple priest, but I'd
say this is worth three sacks of rice!

105
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:27,051
Wait, young sir!

106
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:28,819
That's mine! Give it back!

107
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:33,186
Hey! Don't be in such a rush!

108
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:39,598
No need to thank me. It's
I who should thank you.

109
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,800
I saw what you did before
against those samurai.

110
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:48,543
You fight like one possessed!

111
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:55,985
Ah, you see those men, too?
Keep your gold hidden, my lad.

112
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:59,823
Hearts have grown hard
throughout the land.

113
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,251
They'll rob you in your
sleep. Shall we run?

114
00:16:14,737 --> 00:16:18,002
So the boar became a monster...

115
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:23,738
I tracked it back to where the
samurai attacked the village, but...

116
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:25,303
You lost it.

117
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,042
See over there?

118
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:33,552
When I was last this way,
there was a fine village here.

119
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:38,025
There was a food, maybe, or a
landslide. I'm sure many died.

120
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:43,393
The land teems with the
twittering of bitter ghosts...

121
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:47,903
...dead from war, sick or starved
and fallen where they stood...

122
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:52,169
A curse, you say? This world is a curse.

123
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:56,338
Ah, this is good!

124
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:02,017
I shouldn't have gotten into
that fight. I killed two men.

125
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:04,815
You saved me that task.

126
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:07,789
Give me your bowl.

127
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:09,154
We all die.

128
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,919
Some now, some later.

129
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:14,657
Hm, an elegant bowl...

130
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:19,168
You remind me of the old tales...

131
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:22,767
A brave people, far to the east...

132
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,400
...who used stone arrowheads
and rode Red Elk....... the <i>(Emishi!)</i>

133
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:36,349
First, though, avoid the jaws of death.

134
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,616
Or so my old teacher used to say.

135
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:42,123
Eat, my lad. It's your rice!

136
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,295
Would you know what this is?

137
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,789
No.

138
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:57,772
It was in the body of the giant
boar. It's what killed him.

139
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:10,914
Far to the west...

140
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:15,048
...deep in the mountains, is
the forest of the Deer God.

141
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:16,751
There no man may tread.

142
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:18,350
The forest of the Deer God?

143
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:23,422
They say the beasts there are
giants, as they were in ages past.

144
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,365
I knew he'd go...

145
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,829
It's not far now! Stay on your guard!

146
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,371
Here they come!

147
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:38,701
The wolves!

148
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:49,807
Calm the oxen! Don't
rush! Form your ranks!

149
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,819
Keep your powder dry!

150
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:54,319
Let them come in range!

151
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:04,059
Number 1, fire!

152
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:23,745
Number 2, fire!

153
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,655
They weren't much, as monsters go.

154
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:35,856
Those were just the
pups. Where's the mother?

155
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:44,031
It's Moro!

156
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:51,937
Come on!

157
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,051
Got her!

158
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,463
She's a god. She won't die from that.

159
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,238
She did some damage...

160
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:21,742
Move them out.

161
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:23,608
What about the ones who fell?

162
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,442
Form up and move out!

163
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:46,932
He's breathing!

164
00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:49,168
Hang on!

165
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:55,536
I am Ashitaka! I have
come from far to the east!

166
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:59,234
Are you ancient gods of
the forest of the Deer God?

167
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:16,817
Leave!

168
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:39,775
<i>A kodama? Are they here, too?</i>

169
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:44,645
You're hurt. Keep still.

170
00:23:49,992 --> 00:23:53,985
They won't harm you. They're
a sign the woods are healthy.

171
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,156
They'll bring their lord!

172
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:58,601
Who? The wolf?

173
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:02,636
No, a huge monster!

174
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:06,506
It's gone!

175
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,078
Yakul's not afraid.
There's no danger here.

176
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,383
We beg passage through your woods.

177
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,032
Let's go back! Rlease!

178
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:40,102
There's a trail across the river.
We'll never get through these woods!

179
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:42,975
The current's too strong.

180
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:46,606
And if we don't get this man
back soon, it'll be too late.

181
00:24:51,987 --> 00:24:55,423
Are you showing us the
way, or getting us lost?

182
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:14,133
Sir! These things aren't
helping us get home.

183
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,006
There's more and more of them!

184
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:39,866
This is your mother? A fine tree!

185
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:25,412
That girl and the wolves...
so this is where they live...

186
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:30,849
We're getting in deeper, sir. This
way leads into the other world.

187
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:32,944
Yes, let's take a rest.

188
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,028
Tracks...

189
00:26:52,174 --> 00:26:56,372
Three toes... and still fresh.

190
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:51,459
Sir! What's wrong?

191
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:28,796
Are you all right, sir?
You're awfully pale...

192
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:31,772
I told you!

193
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,104
Did you see something?

194
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,666
Forget it.

195
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:39,743
Hang on a little longer.

196
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:41,578
I'm sorry.

197
00:28:47,956 --> 00:28:49,753
It's gone...

198
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:55,622
Why does he suddenly feel so light?

199
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:58,632
Hey! It doesn't hurt!

200
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:02,503
I'm cured! Ow! No, it's broken.

201
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:12,477
Sir! You're exactly right!
We're back at the ironworks!

202
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,011
It's a fort!

203
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:48,242
Lady Eboshi's ironworks.

204
00:29:48,317 --> 00:29:51,309
They melt iron sand into iron.

205
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:53,084
Hey!

206
00:29:54,122 --> 00:29:56,113
Hey!

207
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:00,194
- Someone's coming from the woods!
- The wolf princess?

208
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:04,465
It's me! Koroku the ox-driver!

209
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:11,538
It's true! He's crossing the lake!

210
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:17,271
What's all this noise?!
Be quiet when I'm writing!

211
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:20,110
Koruku's come back from the dead!

212
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:21,240
What?!

213
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:35,125
You're not a ghost.

214
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:38,189
- Where are the others?
- Four of you fell...

215
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,258
It's just us left.

216
00:30:43,505 --> 00:30:45,837
It's never the guards that die.

217
00:30:45,907 --> 00:30:47,238
Move!

218
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:51,301
Who's the man in the hood, sir?

219
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,904
An outsider...

220
00:30:54,282 --> 00:31:00,187
Listen, Rifemen... this gentleman
carried your man all the way here.

221
00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:01,984
Thank him.

222
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:05,882
Ow! Don't grab me there!

223
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:09,930
Hey, you! Wait!

224
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,543
First, my thanks for
bringing back our men.

225
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:27,137
But something bothers me...

226
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:30,810
You got here in less than
half the time we did...

227
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:34,117
...through the Deer God's
forest, carrying two...

228
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:36,521
Koroku! You're alive!

229
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:38,183
Toki!

230
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,730
Look at that leg! How are
you going to drive oxen now?!

231
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:47,029
But....... but.......

232
00:31:47,102 --> 00:31:50,970
Scaring me half to death! The
wolf-god should've eaten you!

233
00:31:51,073 --> 00:31:53,337
Then I could find a better husband!

234
00:31:53,408 --> 00:31:56,206
Toki! They're all listening!

235
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:59,178
Toki, save your love-talk for later.

236
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:02,784
And you! Leaving them there to die!

237
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:06,614
Some escort you are! You
don't do any real work here.

238
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:08,678
At least act when there's danger!

239
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:10,724
What could I do?

240
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:14,228
Thank you. My husband's an
idiot, but I'm glad he's safe.

241
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:18,390
Good. I was afraid maybe
I'd done something wrong.

242
00:32:23,538 --> 00:32:26,598
You look very handsome.
Show us your face.

243
00:32:26,674 --> 00:32:27,868
Gonza...

244
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:33,104
I would like to thank the
traveler. Bring him to me later.

245
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:34,170
Koroku...

246
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:38,709
It's good you're back. I apologize.

247
00:32:39,754 --> 00:32:44,157
Don't say that, Milady. He'll
just take advantage of you.

248
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:49,158
Forgive me, Toki. I
shouldn't have let it happen.

249
00:32:49,263 --> 00:32:53,063
If you hadn't been there, Milady...

250
00:32:53,134 --> 00:32:55,159
...the wolves would've got them all.

251
00:32:57,605 --> 00:33:00,904
Go and rest, Traveler.

252
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:07,977
Hey! You are handsome!

253
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:38,909
We had to fight off Moro to
bring this rice, you know.

254
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,470
Dish it out!

255
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:43,778
Where?

256
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:45,409
Him?

257
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,851
Toki was right!

258
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:49,890
<i>- He is handsome!
- A bit young...</i>

259
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:52,653
That never stopped you before!

260
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:55,625
Quiet out there! We lost two men!

261
00:33:55,696 --> 00:33:57,891
There's lots of handsome men here!

262
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:00,024
Bunch of cowherds!

263
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:04,936
Come over to our place, Traveler!
Forget this stinking barn!

264
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,635
Watch your mouth! We risked our
lives to bring the rice you're eating.

265
00:34:09,744 --> 00:34:12,975
And who made the iron
that bought that rice?

266
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:15,413
We work those bellows all night long!

267
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:19,412
I would like to see where
you work, if you don't mind...

268
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,509
Really?

269
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:22,783
We'll have to work in make-up!

270
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:24,518
Rouge, too?

271
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:28,494
Don't forget! We'll be waiting!

272
00:34:29,864 --> 00:34:32,765
Don't mind them, sir.

273
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:36,564
Lady Eboshi spoils them.

274
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:38,764
A good town has happy women.

275
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,568
But women working the
bellows in an ironworks?

276
00:34:42,643 --> 00:34:45,510
Their presence defiles the iron.

277
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:50,211
Milady buys up the contract of
every brothel girl she finds!

278
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:52,411
She's kind, that's all.

279
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:54,454
There's rice on your face, old man.

280
00:34:54,522 --> 00:34:58,652
But she's not afraid of
ancient laws, or of curses.

281
00:34:58,726 --> 00:35:01,661
Or of gods, either.

282
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:04,562
You should've seen her with Nago!

283
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:05,724
'Nago'?

284
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,531
A huge boar-god. He ruled
the forest around here.

285
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:12,606
We couldn't get near the mountains.

286
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:15,904
All we could do was sit
here and look up at them.

287
00:35:17,311 --> 00:35:19,779
The sand down below was worked out.

288
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:25,112
Lots of people had their eye on
this place. The boars got them all.

289
00:35:25,186 --> 00:35:29,054
To get sand, we have to clear the trees.

290
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:31,081
Nago got mad.

291
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:49,506
There they go again!

292
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:55,542
Then Lady Eboshi came
along with her guns.

293
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:24,640
Sir? What's wrong?

294
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:30,115
Does your arm hurt?

295
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:33,176
I was just thinking about that boar...

296
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:36,888
He must have died full of hate.

297
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:45,964
Sorry to keep you waiting...

298
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:47,625
That's good iron.

299
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:50,764
We were late with tomorrow's shipment.

300
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,004
Let's have a rest. Tell the others.

301
00:36:57,344 --> 00:37:00,973
Some think you're spying for the
samurai, or the wolf princess.

302
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:05,175
Many have their eyes on our iron.

303
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:07,220
May I ask why you're here?

304
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:15,594
I'm sure you know this.

305
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:21,557
It shattered the bones of a giant boar,
rotted his fesh and made him a monster.

306
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:27,104
When I tried to stop him, I was left
with this scar: A curse unto death.

307
00:37:27,675 --> 00:37:31,076
Where is your land? I've
never seen an elk like yours.

308
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:35,415
Between north and east.
That's all I will say.

309
00:37:35,483 --> 00:37:39,476
Answer when you're asked
or I'll cut you in two!

310
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:42,421
What do you plan to do?

311
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:46,326
See with eyes unclouded.

312
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:49,152
'Eyes unclouded'?

313
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:55,366
I see.

314
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:57,870
Come. I'll show you my secret.

315
00:37:57,938 --> 00:37:59,166
Milady!

316
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,140
Take over, Gonza.

317
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:05,032
My garden, where none dare come.

318
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,971
Come, if you wish to know my secret.

319
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:17,616
Good evening.

320
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:27,493
We've just finished.

321
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:30,327
It's still heavy.

322
00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:32,991
You hold it so lightly...

323
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,001
Too light and it'll fall apart.

324
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:40,904
They aren't for me. They're
for the other women here.

325
00:39:41,508 --> 00:39:43,339
Won't that be a sight!

326
00:39:43,444 --> 00:39:47,210
This is the new gun these
people have contrived.

327
00:39:47,281 --> 00:39:49,340
The Chinese ones are too heavy.

328
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,349
It will kill monsters
and pierce samurai armor.

329
00:39:53,988 --> 00:39:57,719
Beware! Lady Eboshi
wants to rule the world!

330
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:01,925
<i>I'm sorry to rush you.
I'll send saké later.</i>

331
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:03,563
Won't that be nice!

332
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:09,266
You stole the boar's woods
and made a monster of him.

333
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:12,498
Now will you breed new
hatreds with those guns?

334
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:15,666
I regret that you suffer.

335
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:18,574
I fired that shot.

336
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:22,503
It is me that brainless
pig should have cursed.

337
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:43,233
Would your right hand like to kill me?

338
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:46,303
To lift the curse, my left would, too.

339
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:48,806
But I fear it would not stop there.

340
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,377
Must it kill us all to be at peace?

341
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:56,779
Milady... Osa speaks.

342
00:40:57,183 --> 00:41:01,984
Milady... do not scorn
the young man's strength.

343
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:06,957
Young man, I too am cursed.

344
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:10,553
I know well your rage and your grief.

345
00:41:10,663 --> 00:41:15,566
I know this, but I beg
you not to kill this lady.

346
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:21,596
She is the only one who
looked upon us as human.

347
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:25,169
Without fear of our disease...

348
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:29,806
...she washed our rotting
fesh, bandaged us...

349
00:41:32,752 --> 00:41:33,878
Osa...

350
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:37,582
Life is suffering. It is hard.

351
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:42,389
The world is cursed, people are
cursed, but still we wish to live...

352
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:45,089
Forgive my foolish raving...

353
00:42:04,684 --> 00:42:06,345
They're back.

354
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:11,786
At night they come to plant
trees and take back the mountain.

355
00:42:11,891 --> 00:42:15,258
Ashitaka, will you stay
here and work with me?

356
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:18,629
Do you want even the Deer God's woods?

357
00:42:18,731 --> 00:42:23,191
Without the ancient gods,
the wild ones are mere beasts.

358
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:28,868
With the forest gone and the wolves
with it, this will be a land of riches.

359
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:30,670
That girl will be human.

360
00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:32,866
Who?

361
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:36,880
Mononoke, the wild girl
whose soul the wolves stole.

362
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:39,247
She lives to kill me.

363
00:42:44,824 --> 00:42:48,590
It is said the blood of the
Deer God will cure disease.

364
00:42:48,661 --> 00:42:54,099
It could cure these people, and
perhaps even lift your curse.

365
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:58,034
Milady... what do you think?

366
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,802
Very well made. Rerfect
for ruling the world.

367
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:04,308
But it's still a bit heavy.

368
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:05,434
Oh, dear!

369
00:43:32,371 --> 00:43:34,464
Look who's here!

370
00:43:34,974 --> 00:43:36,942
Let me work the bellows.

371
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:38,806
Huh? Hey, wait!

372
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:43,204
May I try?

373
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,711
If he insists...

374
00:43:59,098 --> 00:44:01,293
You really came!

375
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:03,301
What did I tell you?

376
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:06,463
Look, she's fixing her kimono!

377
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:09,701
You'll never keep that pace.

378
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,076
It's hard work.

379
00:44:12,178 --> 00:44:14,840
Yep. We work four days' straight.

380
00:44:15,648 --> 00:44:17,445
Is life hard here?

381
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:22,180
Yeah, but it's better
than life in the towns.

382
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:25,951
We eat our fill, and
the men know their place.

383
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:27,856
I see...

384
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:15,907
- You go tomorrow?
- Stay longer!

385
00:45:15,975 --> 00:45:17,567
Work here!

386
00:45:17,643 --> 00:45:20,806
Thank you, but there
is someone I must meet.

387
00:45:27,353 --> 00:45:28,513
She's here!

388
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,884
The wolf princess!

389
00:46:13,766 --> 00:46:14,755
It's her!

390
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,258
Stop!

391
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,203
I don't want to fight you!

392
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,401
She's after Milady!

393
00:46:37,156 --> 00:46:41,388
Build up the fires! Rifemen to
the stockade! Keep her inside!

394
00:46:41,493 --> 00:46:44,690
Stay at your posts!

395
00:46:45,264 --> 00:46:47,596
She's up on the roof!

396
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:50,499
Don't get excited! Keep working!

397
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:52,196
The fire mustn't go out!

398
00:46:53,305 --> 00:46:57,071
- Is she alone?
- Yes. We have her cornered.

399
00:46:57,142 --> 00:46:59,372
It's Milady she came for.

400
00:46:59,445 --> 00:47:01,777
Oh well... come on.

401
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:14,286
Can you hear me, Rrincess
Mononoke? I'm here.

402
00:47:15,661 --> 00:47:17,925
If you would avenge your tribe...

403
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:22,995
...here are some who seek
vengeance for husbands...

404
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:25,161
...killed by wolves.

405
00:47:25,237 --> 00:47:27,728
Come out! We have a score to settle!

406
00:47:37,883 --> 00:47:39,612
There she is!

407
00:47:42,688 --> 00:47:45,919
Out of the way! You'll get hit!

408
00:47:52,731 --> 00:47:54,596
It's a trap! Stop!

409
00:47:55,734 --> 00:47:59,534
Wolf-God Rrincess!
Go back to the woods!

410
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:05,904
Don't die for nothing!

411
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:07,975
I knew it!

412
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:10,277
Let him do as he likes.

413
00:48:31,136 --> 00:48:33,400
Got her! She's falling!

414
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:34,905
Stay back!

415
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,831
Even cut off, the head can still bite.

416
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,774
Aim where she falls.

417
00:49:00,466 --> 00:49:01,990
Fire!

418
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:12,373
Stay back!

419
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:21,975
Wake up!

420
00:49:27,993 --> 00:49:29,153
No!

421
00:49:48,714 --> 00:49:49,703
Get her!

422
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:51,578
Don't let her go!

423
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,844
Kill her!

424
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:58,749
Are you all right, sir?

425
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,532
Out of my way!

426
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:19,401
Villain! You're one of them, too!

427
00:50:22,214 --> 00:50:23,374
Halt!

428
00:50:27,452 --> 00:50:28,851
Step aside.

429
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:47,829
What are you doing?!

430
00:50:47,906 --> 00:50:49,703
The girl is mine.

431
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,671
I'm sure she'll make a lovely wife.

432
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:57,273
There is a demon inside you. And in her.

433
00:51:02,988 --> 00:51:07,823
Look on this! It is the
form of the hate within me!

434
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:10,727
It rots my fesh, and summons my death!

435
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:13,761
Do not make the hate grow!

436
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:16,891
Enough talk of your curse!

437
00:51:16,969 --> 00:51:18,561
I'll cut that arm off!

438
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:25,336
Milady!

439
00:51:28,113 --> 00:51:29,842
Someone take her!

440
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,683
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

441
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:45,753
I will take the girl!

442
00:51:46,632 --> 00:51:49,795
Wait! You don't treat
Lady Eboshi like that!

443
00:51:53,005 --> 00:51:54,165
Don't move!

444
00:52:06,218 --> 00:52:07,879
Kiyo, no!

445
00:52:13,392 --> 00:52:14,723
He still walks...

446
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,828
- How's Milady?
- Safe, sir.

447
00:52:23,903 --> 00:52:27,999
Bring me my gun! Rifemen, assemble here!

448
00:52:28,073 --> 00:52:29,665
They won't get away!

449
00:52:31,177 --> 00:52:32,838
Toki, quick!

450
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,781
You're...

451
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,495
You can't pass, sir.

452
00:52:57,036 --> 00:52:59,561
The gate can't be opened without leave.

453
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:04,609
Turn back, please...

454
00:53:04,677 --> 00:53:08,306
You helped one of us. We
don't want to harm you.

455
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:13,474
I came on my own two
feet. I will leave on them.

456
00:53:14,954 --> 00:53:17,787
It takes ten men to open that gate!

457
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:27,799
Sir, no! You'll die!

458
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:38,440
He moved it!

459
00:53:45,484 --> 00:53:47,281
Move aside!

460
00:53:51,123 --> 00:53:52,556
Wolves!

461
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:53,649
Flint!

462
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:56,661
Stop! Your princess is safe!

463
00:53:59,665 --> 00:54:00,996
I'm coming!

464
00:54:01,066 --> 00:54:02,465
Yakul, let's go!

465
00:54:07,373 --> 00:54:08,863
I thank you.

466
00:54:15,748 --> 00:54:17,147
He's gone...

467
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:41,365
Wait!

468
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,835
He's mine!

469
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:59,950
Did they shoot you? Are you dead?

470
00:55:03,729 --> 00:55:06,960
Why did you stop me?
Speak while you still live!

471
00:55:08,834 --> 00:55:11,496
I didn't want you to die.

472
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:15,733
I'm not afraid to die if it
will drive the humans away!

473
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:19,238
I knew that when I first saw you.

474
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:22,781
You've wasted your life
by getting in my way!

475
00:55:26,852 --> 00:55:30,015
I'll cut your throat!
That'll shut you up!

476
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,479
Live...

477
00:55:32,591 --> 00:55:35,151
I don't listen to humans!

478
00:55:37,096 --> 00:55:39,587
You're beautiful...

479
00:55:43,002 --> 00:55:46,699
What's wrong, San? Shall
I crunch him for you?

480
00:55:58,684 --> 00:56:00,015
The apes...

481
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:05,789
Apes! Do you mean disrespect
to the tribe of Moro?

482
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:08,987
This is our forest.

483
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:11,222
Give us man.

484
00:56:11,296 --> 00:56:14,663
Give us man and go.

485
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:17,065
Leave, before my fangs find you.

486
00:56:17,569 --> 00:56:19,230
Go.

487
00:56:19,304 --> 00:56:21,534
We eat man.

488
00:56:21,707 --> 00:56:23,072
We eat him.

489
00:56:23,575 --> 00:56:25,304
Let us eat man.

490
00:56:25,377 --> 00:56:29,609
Why would the tribe of the apes...

491
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:32,047
...want to eat a man?

492
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:37,088
We eat man. We have his strength.

493
00:56:37,156 --> 00:56:40,592
We want strength to drive humans away.

494
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:45,254
You won't get that
power by eating a man.

495
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:49,323
All that will do is turn
you into something else!

496
00:56:49,835 --> 00:56:55,603
We plant trees. Humans destroy them.

497
00:56:55,674 --> 00:56:58,837
Forest does not come
back. We kill humans.

498
00:56:59,511 --> 00:57:03,607
The Deer God is with us. Don't
give up. Rlant your trees.

499
00:57:03,682 --> 00:57:05,843
We will fight for you to the last!

500
00:57:06,418 --> 00:57:10,445
Deer God will not fight. We die.

501
00:57:10,522 --> 00:57:13,855
Wolf girl not care. Wolf girl human.

502
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:19,019
You monkey! I'll break your neck!

503
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:23,465
Stop it!

504
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:33,941
It's all right.

505
00:57:34,012 --> 00:57:38,142
You go ahead. I'll
take care of the human.

506
00:57:38,217 --> 00:57:39,878
What about him?

507
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:41,442
Can we eat him?

508
00:57:44,456 --> 00:57:46,981
No. Go on.

509
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:56,799
Come here. Let's be friends.

510
00:57:57,469 --> 00:58:00,529
Help me carry your master.

511
00:59:56,121 --> 01:00:00,057
You're smart. You know not
to set foot on this island.

512
01:00:01,627 --> 01:00:03,117
Humans stink!

513
01:00:13,205 --> 01:00:15,867
Go where you will. You're free.

514
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:49,964
There he is!

515
01:01:50,803 --> 01:01:53,636
The night-walker! At last!

516
01:01:54,139 --> 01:01:55,629
Quick! Come and look!

517
01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:59,601
There's why we've been sitting
in these stinking bearskins!

518
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:02,312
Don't look! You'll go blind!

519
01:02:02,981 --> 01:02:05,882
This from the West Land's best hunter?

520
01:02:05,951 --> 01:02:08,749
This is a charter from the Mikado...

521
01:02:08,821 --> 01:02:11,551
...allowing us to subdue the Deer God!

522
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:20,264
At night he becomes the night-walker.

523
01:02:20,332 --> 01:02:23,096
As night becomes day he changes form.

524
01:02:23,168 --> 01:02:27,571
He's vanishing... over there!

525
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:51,483
<i>Jiko!</i>

526
01:03:51,557 --> 01:03:53,286
I know.

527
01:03:54,092 --> 01:03:55,582
Over there.

528
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:11,173
There's hundreds of them.

529
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:13,643
They're not from these woods.

530
01:04:13,712 --> 01:04:16,078
They're lords of some other mountain.

531
01:04:23,856 --> 01:04:25,824
It's Okkoto!

532
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:28,621
From the South Island?

533
01:04:28,694 --> 01:04:30,719
There's no mistaking those tusks.

534
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:33,964
Looks like he brought his whole tribe!

535
01:04:37,102 --> 01:04:39,093
He's seen us! Fall back!

536
01:04:52,517 --> 01:04:54,678
Come on! Jump!

537
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:49,836
There's no wound!

538
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:01,383
Yakul...

539
01:06:24,876 --> 01:06:29,142
If you're awake thank Yakul.
He watched you the whole time.

540
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,914
How do you know his name?

541
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:39,049
He's told me all about you,
your village, your forest...

542
01:06:39,825 --> 01:06:43,488
The Deer God brought you back
to life, so I'll help you.

543
01:06:45,163 --> 01:06:48,860
I had this dream... a golden deer...

544
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:50,094
Eat.

545
01:06:55,574 --> 01:06:56,563
Chew.

546
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,096
We're here to kill the
humans and save the forest.

547
01:08:30,169 --> 01:08:32,103
Why are there humans here?

548
01:08:32,205 --> 01:08:34,673
The girl is San, my daughter.

549
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:40,337
The humans are everywhere. Go back
to your mountain and kill them there.

550
01:08:41,047 --> 01:08:44,574
We kill for the forest of the Deer God.

551
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,050
Why is there a man here?

552
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:51,756
The Deer God healed his
wound. We must give him back.

553
01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:57,296
The Deer God saved him? The
Deer God healed his wound?!

554
01:08:58,331 --> 01:09:01,266
Why did he not save Nago?

555
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:04,768
Is he not guardian of the forest?!

556
01:09:04,871 --> 01:09:09,103
The Deer God gives
life, and takes it away.

557
01:09:09,175 --> 01:09:12,872
Have you boars forgotten even that?

558
01:09:13,379 --> 01:09:17,577
No! You begged the Deer God for him.

559
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:19,641
You did not beg for Nago!

560
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:24,484
He feared death... I, like him...

561
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:28,822
...carry within me a
poisoned human stone.

562
01:09:28,895 --> 01:09:33,355
Nago fed. I remain, and
contemplate my death.

563
01:09:33,432 --> 01:09:35,332
Go to the Deer God!

564
01:09:35,401 --> 01:09:38,666
I have lived long enough, San.

565
01:09:38,738 --> 01:09:42,003
The Deer God will take my life.

566
01:09:42,508 --> 01:09:45,238
No, Mother! You've
protected the Deer God!

567
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:50,839
We are not fooled! Nago was beautiful
and strong. Our brother would not run!

568
01:09:51,484 --> 01:09:54,078
You wolves ate him!

569
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:57,453
Silence! You slander my mother!

570
01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:00,588
Hear me, O wild mountain gods...

571
01:10:01,527 --> 01:10:04,360
It was I who killed Nago.

572
01:10:05,082 --> 01:10:08,984
He had become a demon,
and attacked our village.

573
01:10:09,487 --> 01:10:13,082
A huge boar. Here is my proof.

574
01:10:18,896 --> 01:10:23,094
I came to this land to ask the
Deer God to lift this curse.

575
01:10:24,001 --> 01:10:27,596
He healed my wound,
but the scar remains.

576
01:10:29,273 --> 01:10:33,607
I must suffer until
the curse destroys me.

577
01:10:38,115 --> 01:10:41,983
Okkoto! Good! Someone who can listen.

578
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:47,815
Okkoto, wait!

579
01:10:48,392 --> 01:10:50,053
You mustn't eat him!

580
01:10:52,129 --> 01:10:56,463
You are Moro's daughter.
I have heard of you.

581
01:10:58,035 --> 01:10:59,468
Your eyes...

582
01:11:00,071 --> 01:11:02,972
Stand back. I will not eat him.

583
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:04,467
Wolf-God Rrincess...

584
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:09,177
Do not fear. I tell of Nago's end.

585
01:11:22,426 --> 01:11:25,987
My thanks to you, young one.

586
01:11:26,063 --> 01:11:32,400
It grieves us that a demon
has come from our tribe.

587
01:11:34,071 --> 01:11:37,802
Lord Okkoto... do you know
how I may lift the curse?

588
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:44,548
Leave this forest. When next we
meet, I will have to kill you.

589
01:11:45,049 --> 01:11:49,543
You cannot win against
the guns of the humans.

590
01:11:49,654 --> 01:11:55,217
Look on my tribe, Moro. We
grow small, and we grow stupid.

591
01:11:55,293 --> 01:11:57,591
To go on in this manner...

592
01:11:57,662 --> 01:12:01,291
...is to end as game
the humans hunt for meat.

593
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:06,234
To risk all on a final battle
is to play into human hands.

594
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:10,238
I ask not for the help of wolves.

595
01:12:10,675 --> 01:12:17,171
Should we die even to the very last,
we will leave the humans in awe.

596
01:12:42,606 --> 01:12:44,096
The Deer God!

597
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:02,681
Keep the oxen together!

598
01:13:06,096 --> 01:13:07,927
Hold your fire... let them come!

599
01:13:09,132 --> 01:13:10,292
Fire!

600
01:13:16,339 --> 01:13:17,739
Reload! Quick!

601
01:13:32,823 --> 01:13:36,520
That damned Eboshi's
fighting the wrong enemy!

602
01:13:36,593 --> 01:13:39,255
You go on ahead and hide.

603
01:14:00,617 --> 01:14:02,847
Here they come!

604
01:14:08,492 --> 01:14:09,891
Chief...

605
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,359
Well done.

606
01:14:12,062 --> 01:14:15,225
We're moving out. Tell the others.

607
01:14:19,803 --> 01:14:21,395
Hello, jiko.

608
01:14:21,471 --> 01:14:26,101
The Emperor presses, and you
sport with country samurai...

609
01:14:26,777 --> 01:14:30,269
Lord Asano sets them against me.

610
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,513
Asano? A powerful man...

611
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,949
He wants my iron.

612
01:14:36,019 --> 01:14:37,748
Greedy, isn't he.

613
01:14:38,588 --> 01:14:41,455
But now is no time to fight men.

614
01:14:41,525 --> 01:14:44,392
The boars are gathering in the forest.

615
01:14:45,328 --> 01:14:47,558
Give him the iron.

616
01:14:47,631 --> 01:14:51,397
Keep your promise to the
Emperor, then smash Asano.

617
01:14:51,501 --> 01:14:55,028
Quick, Milady! Asano's men are coming!

618
01:15:00,377 --> 01:15:03,369
Speak of the devil! A messenger.

619
01:15:03,446 --> 01:15:06,279
A messenger. Remember your manners.

620
01:15:09,186 --> 01:15:10,847
Welcome home!

621
01:15:13,657 --> 01:15:15,750
Aren't you going to see him?

622
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:24,395
Eboshi, Mistress of the
Ironworks, you have fought well!

623
01:15:25,602 --> 01:15:30,369
I bring a message from
my lord. Open your gates!

624
01:15:30,473 --> 01:15:33,442
We hear you fine from there!

625
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,377
Milady took this
mountain from the boars!

626
01:15:36,446 --> 01:15:38,676
Now it's worth something
and you want it!

627
01:15:38,782 --> 01:15:40,249
On your way!

628
01:15:40,317 --> 01:15:42,945
You have no respect, woman!

629
01:15:43,086 --> 01:15:44,610
No respect?

630
01:15:44,688 --> 01:15:49,591
We haven't had respect
since we were born!

631
01:15:49,659 --> 01:15:52,150
You want iron? Have some!

632
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:03,096
They're really something!

633
01:16:03,173 --> 01:16:05,869
Samurai or forest god, they don't care.

634
01:16:06,577 --> 01:16:09,978
Eboshi's women don't lack courage.

635
01:16:11,882 --> 01:16:13,747
What good is this paper?

636
01:16:14,385 --> 01:16:17,684
Well, it's helped in getting
the best hunters and trackers.

637
01:16:17,755 --> 01:16:20,690
We're after gods, not just beasts.

638
01:16:22,092 --> 01:16:23,923
Yes, Milady?

639
01:16:24,261 --> 01:16:26,923
Do you know who this paper is from?

640
01:16:27,398 --> 01:16:28,865
The Mikado.

641
01:16:28,932 --> 01:16:31,230
- Mikado?
- Who's he?

642
01:16:31,802 --> 01:16:33,292
The Emperor.

643
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:37,065
They're really something!

644
01:16:37,508 --> 01:16:38,941
Off you go.

645
01:16:40,644 --> 01:16:45,081
As we make iron here,
the forest grows weak.

646
01:16:45,149 --> 01:16:47,208
That way costs fewer lives.

647
01:16:48,052 --> 01:16:50,543
We've spent too much time and money.

648
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:54,580
We didn't send 40
rifemen just for the iron.

649
01:16:54,658 --> 01:16:57,650
So the Emperor says, at least.

650
01:16:57,761 --> 01:17:02,721
Surely he doesn't believe that the
Deer God's head confers immortality?

651
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:07,202
I'm not privy to the
thoughts of the Emperor.

652
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:08,499
Eest not to be.

653
01:17:09,807 --> 01:17:11,331
You have my word.

654
01:17:11,408 --> 01:17:15,777
The boars will be easier
than Moro and her tribe.

655
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:20,511
Call out that shady bunch you've
got hidden under the cliff.

656
01:17:21,185 --> 01:17:25,383
So I'm found out, am I?

657
01:17:25,456 --> 01:17:27,788
One more thing...

658
01:17:28,192 --> 01:17:30,285
Did a young man pass by here?

659
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:33,792
Riding a red elk?

660
01:17:34,364 --> 01:17:35,695
He left.

661
01:17:55,285 --> 01:17:57,253
They make my skin crawl!

662
01:17:57,321 --> 01:18:01,155
They're not ordinary hunters.
They're special scouts.

663
01:18:01,959 --> 01:18:03,950
Let us go with you!

664
01:18:04,027 --> 01:18:05,654
Don't trust those men!

665
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:09,128
We can't help you from
here if anything happens!

666
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,894
We've learned how to shoot...

667
01:18:11,568 --> 01:18:14,765
That's the reason I want you here.

668
01:18:15,272 --> 01:18:18,139
I fear humans more than forest gods.

669
01:18:19,343 --> 01:18:23,006
With the Deer God dead,
things will become clear.

670
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,039
Is the Deer God's head all
the Emperor really wants?

671
01:18:28,018 --> 01:18:31,613
We may have to fight the rifemen, too.

672
01:18:32,689 --> 01:18:36,125
We can't trust men. Stay on your toes.

673
01:18:36,727 --> 01:18:40,891
Don't worry about Lady
Eboshi. I'll protect her.

674
01:18:40,964 --> 01:18:43,330
- You will, will you?
- What?!

675
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,800
Maybe if you were a woman...

676
01:19:55,839 --> 01:19:57,170
Does it hurt?

677
01:19:59,376 --> 01:20:03,073
You could end it all
by jumping, you know.

678
01:20:03,146 --> 01:20:06,377
When your strength returns,
the scar will grow restless.

679
01:20:07,584 --> 01:20:10,018
I feel like I've slept for days.

680
01:20:10,754 --> 01:20:13,382
I dreamed San was tending to me.

681
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:20,419
I hoped you would cry out in your
sleep, so I could bite off your head.

682
01:20:20,497 --> 01:20:22,488
A beautiful woods...

683
01:20:22,566 --> 01:20:24,397
Are the boars moving yet?

684
01:20:25,002 --> 01:20:28,938
Go back into the cave,
boy. You can't hear it...

685
01:20:29,006 --> 01:20:31,907
The cry of the woods
trampled under by boars...

686
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:37,913
I sit here listening to it and
to the crumbling of my body...

687
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:40,381
...and wait for that woman...

688
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:43,977
...dreaming of the moment
I crush her head in my jaws.

689
01:20:44,621 --> 01:20:48,079
Can't humans and the forest
live together in peace?

690
01:20:48,492 --> 01:20:50,016
Can't this be stopped?

691
01:20:50,127 --> 01:20:52,721
The humans are gathering.

692
01:20:52,796 --> 01:20:55,390
Their fire will reach even here.

693
01:20:55,499 --> 01:20:58,900
And San? Do you intend
to take her with you?

694
01:20:59,002 --> 01:21:02,904
How like a human to
think only of himself!

695
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:09,442
She is a daughter of our tribe.
When the woods die, so will she.

696
01:21:09,546 --> 01:21:12,140
Set her free! She's human!

697
01:21:12,816 --> 01:21:14,249
Silence, boy!

698
01:21:14,318 --> 01:21:17,310
<i>What can you do for her?</i>

699
01:21:18,221 --> 01:21:24,160
The humans who violated the forest
threw her in my path as they ran from me.

700
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:27,628
Now she cannot be human,
and she cannot be wolf.

701
01:21:27,698 --> 01:21:31,190
My poor, ugly, lovely daughter...

702
01:21:31,301 --> 01:21:33,792
Can you save her?!

703
01:21:35,706 --> 01:21:38,539
I don't know, but together we can live.

704
01:21:40,844 --> 01:21:45,713
How? Will you join with San
and fight the human race?

705
01:21:46,483 --> 01:21:49,213
No. All that does is cause more hatred.

706
01:21:49,786 --> 01:21:54,246
There is nothing you can do, boy.

707
01:21:54,324 --> 01:21:57,521
Soon the scar will kill you.

708
01:21:57,594 --> 01:21:59,926
Leave here when the sun rises.

709
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,168
Can you walk?

710
01:22:17,981 --> 01:22:20,677
Thanks to you and the Deer God.

711
01:23:21,878 --> 01:23:24,472
Yakul! Were you worried?

712
01:23:29,352 --> 01:23:31,582
My legs are so weak!

713
01:24:03,285 --> 01:24:05,913
<i>It's so quiet... where are the kodama?</i>

714
01:24:12,628 --> 01:24:15,358
I can smell the ironworks...

715
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:26,105
Thank you for guiding me.
I have a favor to ask you.

716
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:30,201
Give this to San.

717
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:40,118
Let's go.

718
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:13,786
What a stench!

719
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:18,623
That's not just smoke. It's
to blunt our sense of smell.

720
01:25:18,694 --> 01:25:19,683
That woman!

721
01:25:29,538 --> 01:25:31,028
She knows we're here...

722
01:25:31,106 --> 01:25:34,337
- It's a foolish trap.
- A trap?

723
01:25:34,843 --> 01:25:38,973
They're trying to lure
the boars out of the woods.

724
01:25:39,048 --> 01:25:40,845
They're planning something.

725
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:44,886
We've got to warn
them! They'll be killed!

726
01:25:45,688 --> 01:25:48,156
Okkoto is no fool.

727
01:25:48,223 --> 01:25:52,751
The boars know it's a trap,
but still they'll charge.

728
01:25:52,828 --> 01:25:55,388
They are a proud race.

729
01:25:56,131 --> 01:26:00,124
<i>The last one alive will
still be charging forward.</i>

730
01:26:05,107 --> 01:26:06,631
They're cutting trees.

731
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:08,540
To anger them.

732
01:26:11,146 --> 01:26:13,706
Mother, this is farewell.

733
01:26:13,782 --> 01:26:16,478
The smoke will blind Okkoto.

734
01:26:16,552 --> 01:26:18,042
I will be his eyes.

735
01:26:18,988 --> 01:26:20,785
As you will.

736
01:26:20,856 --> 01:26:25,020
Although there is a life
for you with that boy...

737
01:26:25,361 --> 01:26:27,261
I hate humans!

738
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:41,699
From Ashitaka? For me?

739
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:46,471
It's pretty...

740
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:49,012
You two go with San.

741
01:26:49,118 --> 01:26:52,884
- I will stay with the Deer God.
- Let's go.

742
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:17,877
The tribe of Moro fights
with you! Where is Okkoto?

743
01:27:20,983 --> 01:27:22,280
Thank you.

744
01:28:47,902 --> 01:28:49,267
The ironworks!

745
01:28:55,109 --> 01:28:56,269
Let's go!

746
01:29:00,114 --> 01:29:01,138
Who goes there?!

747
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:02,438
Samurai!

748
01:29:04,519 --> 01:29:05,508
Halt!

749
01:29:06,587 --> 01:29:08,077
Let me pass!

750
01:29:24,705 --> 01:29:26,172
Who was that?!

751
01:29:30,178 --> 01:29:32,669
He's stopping them!

752
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:35,043
Don't waste your arrows!

753
01:29:59,407 --> 01:30:00,532
Quick!

754
01:30:00,608 --> 01:30:02,200
You're right! It is him!

755
01:30:02,276 --> 01:30:03,265
In the fesh!

756
01:30:03,344 --> 01:30:05,642
Ashitaka!

757
01:30:05,713 --> 01:30:06,702
Toki?

758
01:30:07,215 --> 01:30:08,512
Are you all right?

759
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:09,948
As you see us!

760
01:30:10,051 --> 01:30:14,579
They thought they'd catch
us while the men were away!

761
01:30:14,655 --> 01:30:16,282
We showed 'em!

762
01:30:16,357 --> 01:30:19,190
- They thought we'd be easy!
- Where's Lady Eboshi?

763
01:30:19,293 --> 01:30:23,923
She took every man who could move
and went to kill the Deer God.

764
01:30:23,998 --> 01:30:25,989
We're cut off and can't reach her!

765
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,501
The Deer God? So that sound before...

766
01:30:29,604 --> 01:30:32,232
Sir! I've still got your bow!

767
01:30:32,306 --> 01:30:34,866
What about his saddle and cloak?!

768
01:30:34,942 --> 01:30:36,466
- But...
- Useless!

769
01:30:37,111 --> 01:30:38,772
Koroku, thanks!

770
01:30:38,846 --> 01:30:41,508
I'll bring help. Can you hold out?

771
01:30:41,616 --> 01:30:45,074
We'll pour hot iron
on them if we have to!

772
01:30:45,153 --> 01:30:46,677
Hurry, Ashitaka!

773
01:30:46,754 --> 01:30:48,779
Bring Lady Eboshi!

774
01:30:53,961 --> 01:30:55,155
Missed!

775
01:30:55,229 --> 01:30:57,220
They're bringing boats. Hurry!

776
01:30:57,298 --> 01:31:01,200
Bring Lady Eboshi! We'll fight, too!

777
01:31:02,937 --> 01:31:04,837
I'll be back!

778
01:31:07,675 --> 01:31:09,905
We'll be here!

779
01:31:13,147 --> 01:31:14,512
Get that man!

780
01:31:24,492 --> 01:31:26,426
They're after us, Yakul!

781
01:32:09,403 --> 01:32:11,394
Burning fesh...

782
01:32:17,478 --> 01:32:18,775
Yakul!

783
01:32:57,685 --> 01:32:58,777
Stay back!

784
01:33:12,066 --> 01:33:13,556
Show me the wound...

785
01:33:15,469 --> 01:33:18,063
Wait here. I'll be right back.

786
01:33:21,008 --> 01:33:22,498
Stay, I said!

787
01:33:33,487 --> 01:33:35,045
We're almost there...

788
01:34:19,467 --> 01:34:20,729
Who goes there?!

789
01:34:21,402 --> 01:34:24,838
Outsiders are not allowed here.

790
01:34:25,706 --> 01:34:30,336
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.

791
01:34:30,845 --> 01:34:34,611
She's not here. State your
business and I'll pass it on.

792
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:37,477
I will speak to her! Where is she?!

793
01:34:37,585 --> 01:34:41,316
Young sir... so you're alive...

794
01:34:41,922 --> 01:34:43,787
You've had a bad time...

795
01:34:43,858 --> 01:34:45,723
There's still men buried.

796
01:34:45,793 --> 01:34:46,953
It was horrible...

797
01:34:47,628 --> 01:34:49,619
The ironworks are under attack.

798
01:34:50,364 --> 01:34:54,630
There's still time. The women
are holding the inner stockade.

799
01:34:54,702 --> 01:34:56,033
The bastards!

800
01:34:56,103 --> 01:34:58,469
Asano waited till we left!

801
01:34:59,006 --> 01:35:00,769
Where's Lady Eboshi?

802
01:35:00,841 --> 01:35:03,571
She's gone after the Deer God.

803
01:35:03,644 --> 01:35:05,475
Call her back!

804
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,546
If you're done, get out of here!

805
01:35:08,616 --> 01:35:09,605
Back to work!

806
01:35:09,717 --> 01:35:11,412
And the ironworks?

807
01:35:11,485 --> 01:35:13,214
Now wait a minute!

808
01:35:13,621 --> 01:35:15,890
They want to abandon the ironworks!

809
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:18,658
If we wait we'll be too late!

810
01:35:18,726 --> 01:35:20,387
Send a messenger!

811
01:35:20,461 --> 01:35:23,589
The woods are huge. He'd never find her!

812
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:26,598
Send one of your trackers!

813
01:35:27,234 --> 01:35:29,896
Lady Eboshi's being used.

814
01:35:30,604 --> 01:35:33,869
Were there any wolves with the boars?

815
01:35:33,941 --> 01:35:36,239
San, er, the wolf girl?

816
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:39,837
I don't know... it was pitch
black when they came at us.

817
01:35:39,914 --> 01:35:41,848
She was there.

818
01:35:42,249 --> 01:35:45,184
We were in the front...

819
01:35:45,252 --> 01:35:46,344
And?

820
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:50,550
I don't know. Suddenly I
didn't know what was going on.

821
01:35:50,624 --> 01:35:53,923
The scouts put us out
there to lure the boars in.

822
01:35:53,994 --> 01:35:56,121
There were mines underneath us...

823
01:35:56,196 --> 01:35:58,391
...and grenades from above.

824
01:36:51,952 --> 01:36:53,442
Where's San?!

825
01:36:57,124 --> 01:37:00,252
Be still! I want to help you.

826
01:37:03,831 --> 01:37:07,494
A wolf! There's a wolf
still alive over here!

827
01:37:07,568 --> 01:37:08,728
Sir, what...

828
01:37:13,207 --> 01:37:14,196
Sir!

829
01:37:14,274 --> 01:37:16,469
Move! What are you doing, boy?!

830
01:37:17,544 --> 01:37:21,207
He's going to take me to Eboshi.

831
01:37:21,315 --> 01:37:24,216
So you're with them, are you?

832
01:37:24,718 --> 01:37:26,083
Move.

833
01:37:26,787 --> 01:37:30,450
What's more important, the head
of the Deer God or the ironworks?!

834
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:32,319
Roison darts!

835
01:37:38,532 --> 01:37:39,760
Stop!

836
01:37:46,306 --> 01:37:48,399
Give me a hand!

837
01:37:58,652 --> 01:38:00,142
He's out!

838
01:38:11,732 --> 01:38:14,860
Go through the swamp
and hide near the lake.

839
01:38:15,269 --> 01:38:17,931
The rifemen are with them. Be careful.

840
01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:21,667
Take this. My last arrow's broken.

841
01:38:23,811 --> 01:38:25,142
You go with them.

842
01:38:25,212 --> 01:38:26,907
Take care of him!

843
01:38:30,617 --> 01:38:32,744
Find San! That's where Eboshi is!

844
01:38:44,698 --> 01:38:48,099
Don't fall behind the
scouts. Today we finish this!

845
01:38:50,971 --> 01:38:52,097
<i>Jiko...</i>

846
01:38:52,172 --> 01:38:54,140
Well? How does it look?

847
01:38:54,241 --> 01:38:59,144
Okkoto's hurt. He and the
girl are going to the Deer God.

848
01:38:59,813 --> 01:39:03,180
So they're going to ask him
for help... stay with them.

849
01:39:03,884 --> 01:39:06,444
But stay hidden, or he won't appear.

850
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,613
Of course.

851
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:12,482
Is that boar's blood on his face?

852
01:39:12,893 --> 01:39:15,623
That's how they trick the boars.

853
01:39:23,704 --> 01:39:27,162
Keep going! We're almost
at the Deer God's pond.

854
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:46,115
Something's coming!

855
01:39:48,896 --> 01:39:52,059
<i>Something's wrong,
Okkoto! Just a bit further!</i>

856
01:39:52,799 --> 01:39:54,664
Something bad is coming.

857
01:39:54,735 --> 01:39:57,727
There's too much blood.
I can't smell what it is.

858
01:40:02,643 --> 01:40:03,701
The apes!

859
01:40:03,810 --> 01:40:05,505
You did this.

860
01:40:05,579 --> 01:40:07,945
It is your fault. Forest will die.

861
01:40:08,515 --> 01:40:12,451
Is this how you thank those
who fought for your forest?

862
01:40:12,553 --> 01:40:14,714
You brought ruin.

863
01:40:14,788 --> 01:40:17,450
Things neither animal nor human!

864
01:40:18,058 --> 01:40:20,549
Neither animal nor human?

865
01:40:26,667 --> 01:40:29,067
- They're here!
- It's the end!

866
01:40:48,522 --> 01:40:49,580
Warriors!

867
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,587
They've returned!

868
01:40:55,963 --> 01:41:01,833
My warriors have returned
from the land of the dead!

869
01:41:05,806 --> 01:41:10,971
Forward, my warriors! To the Deer God!

870
01:41:17,317 --> 01:41:21,219
Okkoto, no! Your warriors
haven't come back to life!

871
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:29,151
They wear boar skins
to hide their scent!

872
01:41:29,263 --> 01:41:30,594
They're men!

873
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:37,066
Stop! They want us to
take them to the Deer God!

874
01:41:41,541 --> 01:41:43,509
Come out, Deer God!

875
01:41:43,577 --> 01:41:49,413
If you are lord of this forest,
revive my warriors to slay the humans.

876
01:41:51,351 --> 01:41:53,410
Okkoto! Still your heart!

877
01:41:54,254 --> 01:41:57,417
We're surrounded! He's
done for. Leave him!

878
01:41:57,524 --> 01:42:00,425
No! Then he'll become a demon!

879
01:42:01,194 --> 01:42:04,925
Tell Mother it's the
Deer God the humans want!

880
01:42:05,465 --> 01:42:07,899
She'll know what to do!

881
01:42:09,703 --> 01:42:11,967
We can't let our kind die out!

882
01:42:13,407 --> 01:42:14,635
Go!

883
01:42:33,994 --> 01:42:38,988
I'll kill the first one that moves,
and tell the whole forest what you are!

884
01:42:49,976 --> 01:42:51,466
Ashitaka?

885
01:42:57,851 --> 01:42:58,840
Bastards!

886
01:43:06,026 --> 01:43:10,292
I burn! A fame bursts from within me!

887
01:43:11,765 --> 01:43:13,534
No!

888
01:43:13,667 --> 01:43:16,568
No, Okkoto! Don't turn into a demon!

889
01:43:18,505 --> 01:43:20,029
Okkoto!

890
01:43:22,709 --> 01:43:23,733
An answer!

891
01:43:27,648 --> 01:43:28,672
What is it?

892
01:43:28,749 --> 01:43:30,410
- San's in danger!
- Let's go!

893
01:43:58,946 --> 01:44:00,379
I'm hot!

894
01:44:09,356 --> 01:44:10,482
No!

895
01:44:10,557 --> 01:44:13,651
I don't want to be a monster! Okkoto!

896
01:44:25,305 --> 01:44:26,670
Too slow! Get on!

897
01:44:41,088 --> 01:44:42,680
A wolf!

898
01:44:45,292 --> 01:44:46,281
Eboshi!

899
01:44:53,233 --> 01:44:54,894
Go on ahead!

900
01:44:56,269 --> 01:44:58,362
Eboshi, listen!

901
01:44:58,472 --> 01:44:59,837
Stop!

902
01:44:59,906 --> 01:45:00,895
Ashitaka?

903
01:45:01,742 --> 01:45:06,406
The samurai are attacking the
ironworks! The women are fighting back!

904
01:45:06,947 --> 01:45:08,175
Leave the Deer God!

905
01:45:09,149 --> 01:45:12,949
The men are heading back!
They're waiting for you!

906
01:45:13,553 --> 01:45:15,885
What proof do you have?

907
01:45:15,956 --> 01:45:19,448
None! I would have stayed
and fought if I could!

908
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:23,587
So it's 'don't kill the Deer
God, kill the samurai,' is it?

909
01:45:24,131 --> 01:45:28,227
No! Can't the forest and
the ironworks live together?

910
01:45:30,637 --> 01:45:32,468
Whose side is he on?

911
01:45:32,539 --> 01:45:33,665
Let's go back!

912
01:45:34,474 --> 01:45:39,673
I've done all I can for the
women. They can defend themselves.

913
01:45:41,948 --> 01:45:44,746
There's the pond. He's around here!

914
01:45:46,086 --> 01:45:48,316
It's now or never. Stay alert.

915
01:45:49,389 --> 01:45:51,016
Do we need her?

916
01:45:51,091 --> 01:45:54,618
We're killing a god.
Let her do it for us.

917
01:46:21,455 --> 01:46:23,252
Moro! Are you dead?

918
01:46:23,323 --> 01:46:24,688
San!

919
01:46:24,758 --> 01:46:26,089
Where are you?

920
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,291
San!

921
01:46:35,969 --> 01:46:37,027
Ashitaka!

922
01:46:44,644 --> 01:46:45,633
Okkoto...

923
01:46:53,954 --> 01:46:54,943
Leave, boy.

924
01:46:56,256 --> 01:46:58,781
If we fight, the Deer God won't come.

925
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:06,297
Okkoto! Be still!

926
01:47:10,437 --> 01:47:14,237
Okkoto! Give me the girl! Where is San?

927
01:47:15,075 --> 01:47:18,101
San, can you hear me? It's me, Ashitaka!

928
01:47:24,417 --> 01:47:25,679
San!

929
01:47:32,659 --> 01:47:34,320
Shut him up!

930
01:47:38,999 --> 01:47:40,899
Shoot him down!

931
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:06,353
San!

932
01:48:08,995 --> 01:48:10,326
San!

933
01:48:13,166 --> 01:48:14,656
Ashitaka!

934
01:48:18,738 --> 01:48:20,035
San!

935
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:21,198
Ashitaka!

936
01:48:29,015 --> 01:48:35,352
And here I was saving my last
bit of strength for that woman...

937
01:48:35,455 --> 01:48:37,480
Close up!

938
01:48:55,075 --> 01:48:57,600
Stay away from him.

939
01:48:57,677 --> 01:48:59,440
The curse will fall on you.

940
01:49:08,989 --> 01:49:10,684
Can you not even speak now?

941
01:49:11,892 --> 01:49:16,386
Well done. Fall back
and tend to the wounded.

942
01:49:17,797 --> 01:49:20,322
A horrible sight!

943
01:49:28,708 --> 01:49:29,697
There he is!

944
01:49:42,455 --> 01:49:45,117
Give me back my daughter!

945
01:50:06,913 --> 01:50:08,437
Ashitaka...

946
01:50:08,515 --> 01:50:10,915
Can you save San?

947
01:50:20,427 --> 01:50:22,156
The Deer God...

948
01:50:33,006 --> 01:50:34,337
Don't shoot!

949
01:50:48,288 --> 01:50:52,486
Eboshi! Your enemy is not the Deer God!

950
01:50:53,026 --> 01:50:54,323
Guns can't hurt him...

951
01:50:54,394 --> 01:50:55,759
Only through the head...

952
01:51:05,605 --> 01:51:06,594
San!

953
01:51:16,782 --> 01:51:18,113
Don't die!

954
01:51:45,444 --> 01:51:48,174
Is the Deer God taking life?!

955
01:52:08,467 --> 01:52:10,492
He's starting to change!

956
01:52:10,569 --> 01:52:12,093
Watch closely.

957
01:52:12,772 --> 01:52:14,831
This is how you kill a god.

958
01:52:14,941 --> 01:52:17,535
He is also the god of death.

959
01:52:18,077 --> 01:52:20,238
Do not shrink back.

960
01:52:36,662 --> 01:52:38,323
Stop!

961
01:52:41,367 --> 01:52:42,356
Eboshi!

962
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:57,242
You damn freak!

963
01:53:07,259 --> 01:53:09,557
Got him! Get the head!

964
01:53:48,801 --> 01:53:51,565
<i>Jiko! Bring the box!</i>

965
01:53:52,171 --> 01:53:55,163
The porters are dead! Quick!

966
01:53:56,776 --> 01:54:00,337
Don't touch the body! It'll
draw your life into it!

967
01:54:04,383 --> 01:54:06,578
One head, as promised.

968
01:54:15,227 --> 01:54:16,854
Milady!

969
01:54:16,929 --> 01:54:19,329
Moro's head... it moved by itself!

970
01:54:19,865 --> 01:54:23,528
Come on, hurry! Run!

971
01:54:23,602 --> 01:54:24,591
<i>Jiko!</i>

972
01:54:27,873 --> 01:54:29,636
Run!

973
01:54:46,358 --> 01:54:47,518
To the island!

974
01:54:47,626 --> 01:54:49,025
I can't swim!

975
01:54:49,095 --> 01:54:50,756
Then wade!

976
01:55:18,958 --> 01:55:21,188
Give her to me! I'll kill her!

977
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:24,388
Moro's already taken her revenge.

978
01:55:24,930 --> 01:55:25,988
Milady!

979
01:55:26,065 --> 01:55:27,293
Help me!

980
01:55:30,769 --> 01:55:33,237
Don't waste your sympathy...

981
01:55:33,772 --> 01:55:36,741
I promised Toki I'd bring you back.

982
01:55:42,615 --> 01:55:45,413
He's looking for his
head. We can't stay here.

983
01:55:45,484 --> 01:55:46,473
San!

984
01:55:47,052 --> 01:55:48,144
Help me!

985
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:50,882
No! You're on their side!

986
01:55:50,956 --> 01:55:52,856
Take that woman and go away!

987
01:55:56,028 --> 01:55:58,053
Keep away! I hate humans!

988
01:55:59,265 --> 01:56:02,564
I am human... and so are you.

989
01:56:02,668 --> 01:56:05,603
Shut up! I'm a wolf!

990
01:56:06,972 --> 01:56:08,462
Keep back!

991
01:56:14,246 --> 01:56:17,443
I'm sorry. I tried to stop it.

992
01:56:24,623 --> 01:56:28,684
It's over. Everything.
The forest is dead.

993
01:56:38,003 --> 01:56:42,463
No, it's not. We're
still alive. Help me.

994
01:57:08,434 --> 01:57:10,299
Wait! Help us!

995
01:57:10,402 --> 01:57:13,166
A little crisis and they're useless!

996
01:57:16,508 --> 01:57:18,271
Don't stop!

997
01:57:23,882 --> 01:57:25,577
The head's moving!

998
01:57:28,687 --> 01:57:30,450
It's calling him here!

999
01:58:13,866 --> 01:58:14,992
That's fixed it.

1000
01:58:15,067 --> 01:58:16,329
Thanks.

1001
01:58:16,669 --> 01:58:18,227
It's very quiet...

1002
01:58:18,304 --> 01:58:19,931
They're waiting for dawn.

1003
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:24,339
I wonder if that young
man found Eboshi...

1004
01:58:24,410 --> 01:58:29,404
I'm sure he did. She's
probably almost here now.

1005
01:58:31,684 --> 01:58:35,711
Look at that face! Hey, Koroku!

1006
01:58:35,788 --> 01:58:38,780
Let him sleep for now.

1007
01:58:48,834 --> 01:58:51,394
I don't like the sound of that...

1008
01:59:03,982 --> 01:59:05,210
The night-walker!

1009
01:59:19,064 --> 01:59:21,362
Hold your positions!

1010
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,868
He's coming this way!

1011
01:59:23,936 --> 01:59:24,925
Run!

1012
01:59:25,637 --> 01:59:29,334
We guard the ironworks! We
promised Milady we would.

1013
01:59:35,414 --> 01:59:37,541
It's him! Ashitaka!

1014
01:59:42,888 --> 01:59:43,877
Get out!

1015
01:59:44,690 --> 01:59:47,523
The Deer God's coming after his head!

1016
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:50,287
Touch that muck and you're dead!

1017
01:59:50,963 --> 01:59:53,557
Run into the lake! The
water'll slow it up!

1018
01:59:54,399 --> 01:59:57,960
The men and Lady Eboshi are
coming from the other side!

1019
01:59:58,036 --> 02:00:01,096
I'm going to give the head back!

1020
02:00:01,173 --> 02:00:02,162
Hurry!

1021
02:00:02,674 --> 02:00:04,539
He's coming!

1022
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:06,100
What do we do?!

1023
02:00:06,178 --> 02:00:07,236
Stay calm!

1024
02:00:07,746 --> 02:00:09,236
To the lake!

1025
02:00:09,448 --> 02:00:11,848
Stay calm! Help the injured!

1026
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,557
Not that way!

1027
02:00:39,945 --> 02:00:41,708
There goes the roof...

1028
02:00:47,419 --> 02:00:51,048
Once the forge starts
to burn, it's all over.

1029
02:00:51,857 --> 02:00:55,349
As long as we're alive,
we'll manage. Move out deeper.

1030
02:01:13,512 --> 02:01:15,173
There they are!

1031
02:01:27,292 --> 02:01:28,350
Go!

1032
02:01:29,328 --> 02:01:30,693
Wait!

1033
02:01:32,331 --> 02:01:34,458
You're still alive? Good!

1034
02:01:35,267 --> 02:01:37,997
I'll give the head back.
Rut it down and run.

1035
02:01:38,103 --> 02:01:43,097
Give it back now? Don't be
stupid. The sun's coming up.

1036
02:01:43,175 --> 02:01:46,906
Look... a brainless, swollen
life-sucking god of death.

1037
02:01:46,979 --> 02:01:48,469
When the sun comes up, he'll vanish.

1038
02:01:49,014 --> 02:01:50,879
He's coming, jiko. Quick!

1039
02:01:50,983 --> 02:01:55,852
Wanting all between heaven and
hell is the human condition.

1040
02:01:56,388 --> 02:01:57,719
I don't want to kill you...

1041
02:01:58,557 --> 02:02:00,218
Oh, dear...

1042
02:02:00,325 --> 02:02:02,953
Don't look so stern...

1043
02:02:09,634 --> 02:02:10,999
Run!

1044
02:02:30,322 --> 02:02:31,311
Ashitaka!

1045
02:02:39,498 --> 02:02:40,556
Uh-oh...

1046
02:02:43,402 --> 02:02:44,926
We're surrounded!

1047
02:02:45,937 --> 02:02:47,598
Come on, sun!

1048
02:02:47,672 --> 02:02:48,730
Open it!

1049
02:02:48,807 --> 02:02:50,832
Don't you understand? It's too late!

1050
02:02:51,476 --> 02:02:54,070
Don't waste time talking to him!

1051
02:02:54,146 --> 02:02:56,137
Human hands must return it!

1052
02:02:57,049 --> 02:02:59,882
Well, I warned you...

1053
02:03:14,699 --> 02:03:16,030
O Deer God...

1054
02:03:16,168 --> 02:03:18,033
We return your head!

1055
02:03:18,837 --> 02:03:20,828
Be at peace!

1056
02:03:31,583 --> 02:03:33,551
Here he comes!

1057
02:04:04,749 --> 02:04:06,046
He's stopped...

1058
02:04:06,118 --> 02:04:07,278
The men!

1059
02:04:20,365 --> 02:04:22,026
Milady!

1060
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:23,761
Careful, she's hurt!

1061
02:04:52,931 --> 02:04:54,330
He's falling!

1062
02:05:00,539 --> 02:05:02,302
Hang on! Don't let go!

1063
02:06:09,374 --> 02:06:12,935
I didn't know the Deer God
made the fowers bloom...

1064
02:06:44,309 --> 02:06:46,209
San, look!

1065
02:07:16,741 --> 02:07:19,733
Even if they grow back, they
won't be the Deer God's woods.

1066
02:07:20,645 --> 02:07:22,340
The Deer God is dead.

1067
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:26,607
The Deer God can't
die. He is life itself.

1068
02:07:26,684 --> 02:07:29,084
Life and death are his to give and take.

1069
02:07:29,821 --> 02:07:31,379
He's telling us we should live.

1070
02:07:40,031 --> 02:07:44,092
I like you, but I can't
forgive what people have done.

1071
02:07:44,168 --> 02:07:47,865
That's all right. You live in the
forest, and I'll live at the ironworks.

1072
