They closed
the accident report already?

177
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,558
Well, neither driver had drugs
or alcohol in their system.

178
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,603
That's usually
the end of it.

179
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,214
They never even
interviewed me.

180
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:22,610
You said you didn't remember
anything about the accident?

181
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:28,355
- I don't.
- Maybe that's for the best.

182
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:49,768
[Dr. Sarkisian]
I'm very encouraged, Tessa.

183
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:51,291
The scan shows
your right ventricle

184
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:53,293
is functioning quite well,
despite the tear.

185
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,295
Finally, some good news.

186
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:57,253
It is more than good.

187
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:00,344
Ninety-nine out of 100 with this
same injury die on my table.

188
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,736
I did die.

189
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,738
Only for a short time.

190
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:06,741
I could see Skylar.

191
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:10,876
Like, he was in this...
this crazy white light.

192
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,226
What is that?
Was she, you know, hallucinating?

193
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,359
When the body undergoes
severe trauma...

194
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,752
- [heartbeat thumping]
- ...the hypothalamus can flood the brain

195
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:20,712
- with pain relieving endorphins.
- [Vickie] So when can we take her home?

196
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:24,846
[Dr. Sarkisian] End of the week. Tessa needs
to be extremely careful these next few months.

197
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,805
Any chest pains
or shortness of breath,

198
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:30,286
you call 911 immediately.
Understand?

199
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,550
[shower running]

200
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,553

[crying continues]

203
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:18,639
[knocking on door]

204
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,691
Jazz? Just give me a second.

205
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,695
Jazz?

206
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:41,532
[electrical crackling]

207
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,493
[phone chimes, buzzes]

208
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:14,826
[Skylar]
You watch, I'll translate.

209
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:26,490
[indistinct PA announcement]

210
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,592
Hi, excuse me.
Are you Doris?

211
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:46,031
[exhales] I am going to take
a wild guess here.

212
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:53,386
Room B424,
girl with the broken heart?

213
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:57,042
[laughing] Relax.

214
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:58,043
I'm not psychic.

215
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:01,525
- Jasmine told me you might come looking for me.
- Oh.

216
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,963
My condolences.

217
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,660
Thank you.

218
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:08,314
Are your hands injured?

219
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:09,402
Excuse me?

220
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,971
From the accident.
Did you hurt your hands at all?

221
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:16,104
- No, why?
- Ta-da! Huh?

222
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,238
Oh, come on. Come on.
[chuckles]

223
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:23,329
So, what is your book about?

224
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:25,853
It's about ADC's.

225
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:27,899
After Death Communication.

226
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:32,643
Okay, so you believe that
dead people can contact us?

227
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:35,471
Along with billions
of other people

228
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:39,171
from faiths
that span the globe.

229
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,958
Sometimes, the departed,

230
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:48,136
they call out
to us in voice.

231
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:55,274
And other times, we can smell their
cologne or perfume in the air.

232
00:20:56,667 --> 00:21:00,975
No matter how they communicate,
the message is the same.

233
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,804
"I'm still here.

234
00:21:03,848 --> 00:21:06,459
And your grief,
like a beacon,

235
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:08,243
calls me to your side."

236
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:12,987
And when the separation
has been traumatic,

237
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:15,207
like with you
and your boyfriend,

238
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,253
there's often
unfinished business.

239
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:21,039
Like regrets or something?

240
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:25,434
Like things left undone
or unsaid.

241
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:27,132
- [door opens]
- [Vickie] Tessa.

242
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,308
We signed you out.
It's time to go.

243
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,354
He's in the in-between.

244
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:35,575
But he won't be there for
long, a few weeks at most.

245
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:37,316
And when he moves on...

246
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:40,667
he's gone for good.

247
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:43,365
- I gotta go.
- Oh, wait, wait.

248
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:45,977
Here, take this.
It's my first book.

249
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,240
- It's a good place to start.
- That's okay.

250
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:50,982
He's reaching out to you.

251
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:53,985
Reach back.

252
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,379
It's too late for that.

253
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:12,220
[teacher]
Tessa, you're up.

254
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:15,876
[clears throat]

255
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:30,717
Um, this is a photo that
I took back in February.

256
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:34,199
Is that how you spend your free
time, taking pictures of trees?

257
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,724
Well, it's actually
not a tree, asshole.

258
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:39,421
- [class laughs]
- It's a cell phone tower,

259
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:40,901
disguised as a tree.

260
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:46,733
It is an allegory for the
artificiality of modern life.

261
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:49,127
[school bell rings]

262
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:53,566
It's a lovely photo, Tessa.

263
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,960
Your technical skills have
taken huge leaps this year.

264
00:22:56,003 --> 00:22:58,092
- Oh, thank you.
- I know you're still a junior,

265
00:22:58,136 --> 00:23:01,487
but I think you have a good shot of getting
into the Rhode Island School of Design.

266
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,576
I'd be happy to write you
a letter of recommendation.

267
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:06,187
Thank you. I just...
My work's not ready for that yet.

268
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:09,060
Oh? What do you feel
is missing?

269
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,149
Just like a point of view.

270
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:13,238
You know, something to say
that's my own.

271
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:16,937
Well, maybe it's time for
your subject matter to evolve.

272
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:20,288
After all, there is something
notably missing from all your photos.

273
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,899
Yeah, I know. Color.

274
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,553
No. People.

275
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:27,774
You know, Tessa,
before an artist can find her voice,

276
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:30,037
she has to find
a subject she loves.

277
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:33,084
Who or what
do you love, Tessa?

- Hi, Cortez.
- Hey, uh, do you have plans this weekend?

301
00:25:12,357 --> 00:25:16,840
As it happens, I actually work
as Tessa's full-time scheduler,

302
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:20,669
so I can say, with absolute authority,
that she does not have any plans

303
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:22,802
- this weekend.
- What are you saying? What are you doing?

304

Well, the final crew meet of
the season is this Saturday.

I was kind of wondering if you
'd come out and take some photos.

Uh, sorry. I don't really do
sports photography.

for our souls.

864
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,297
Okay, so you think Skylar

865
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:30,082
is reaching out to you
from this waiting room?

866
01:08:30,126 --> 01:08:33,869
They were color photos, Shannon.
I don't... I don't shoot in color.

867
01:08:33,912 --> 01:08:36,480
I don't even own
the chemicals to develop it.

868
01:08:36,524 --> 01:08:39,831
- But you can't show me the photos?
- No, I told you.

869
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:42,138
The fixer didn't work.
I don't know why.

870
01:08:42,181 --> 01:08:46,621
But maybe spirits can't be captured
on film or something. I don't know.

871
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:48,710
All right.

872
01:08:50,886 --> 01:08:52,931
Tess, I want to believe
you, I swear,

873
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:56,631
but messages
from the other side?

874
01:08:57,849 --> 01:08:59,982
I just think he wants
the same thing I want.

875
01:09:01,766 --> 01:09:06,684
To see me one last time so that we can
actually say goodbye to each other.

876
01:09:07,598 --> 01:09:09,861
You loved him,
and he knew that.

877
01:09:09,905 --> 01:09:11,428
What more is there to say?

878
01:09:11,472 --> 01:09:13,430

Two-minute warning.

Dude, we need
to focus, okay?

You're not even
listening to me.

883
01:09:20,132 --> 01:09:22,395
Yes, I am!
I just don't think

884
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:25,834
this is about color photos or
waiting rooms or the in-between.

885
01:09:25,877 --> 01:09:29,098
- Then what is it about?
- A girl who won't let go.

886
01:09:31,056 --> 01:09:33,929
Just think about it.
Okay?

This negative's made of glass.
It's coated in collodion,

904
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:02,817
then dipped in silver
nitrate, which is crazy.

905
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,776
Because after that, you only ave
a few minutes to take the photo

No. Julian, hi.

Nice to meet you.

Okay, kids, follow me.
I wanna show you something.

Doesn't it look amazing

This was a gift to Skylar.

another one?

anyone looking at it.

That's exactly why
I brought you here,

01:13:50,838 --> 01:13:54,276
to prove that your photos are
great, even Julian thinks so.

941
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:56,539
I don't want this photo
hanging on the wall

942

of some random stranger.

943
01:13:58,846 --> 01:14:00,282
This is my photo.

944
01:14:00,325 --> 01:14:02,501
That means I get to decide
who I share it with

945
01:14:02,545 --> 01:14:04,199
and I shared it with you.

946
01:14:05,809 --> 01:14:06,810
You're right.

947
01:14:07,332 --> 01:14:09,291
I'm sorry. I should have
asked you first.

948
01:14:09,334 --> 01:14:11,206
I just wanted you to see
how amazing you are.

949
01:14:11,249 --> 01:14:14,470
And that you can
get into RISD.

950
01:14:15,688 --> 01:14:17,342
Who said anything
about RISD?

951
01:14:17,865 --> 01:14:22,304
Shannon said your art teacher
thought you could get in.

952
01:14:22,347 --> 01:14:26,003
- I'm gonna kill her.
- It is the best art college in the country.

953
01:14:26,047 --> 01:14:29,311
And it's in Providence,
which is in the same city as Brown.

954
01:14:29,354 --> 01:14:31,530
Which if you get in,
we could be together.

955
01:14:31,574 --> 01:14:33,881
- I...
- For real. Without a ticking clock.

956
01:14:33,924 --> 01:14:36,535
Even if I could
get into RISD,

957
01:14:36,579 --> 01:14:38,450
which I totally doubt,

958
01:14:38,494 --> 01:14:41,627
- I cannot afford that.
- You're going to get into RISD.

959
01:14:41,671 --> 01:14:43,978
- No.
- And you could just get a scholarship.

960
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:47,155
Skylar, Jesus,
just give it up.

961
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:49,897

You can't fix everything.

Your parents' marriage
and me.

964
01:14:54,466 --> 01:14:56,599
Some things are
just beyond repair.

965
01:14:56,642 --> 01:14:58,340
Is that why you
won't say you love me?

966
01:15:01,169 --> 01:15:04,563
Because you're...
beyond repair.

967
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:11,092
Okay.

like you asked. What's up?

01:16:58,112 --> 01:17:00,244
I would like to take
your portrait.

975
01:17:01,463 --> 01:17:05,946
- Uh... can I change first?
- No, you don't have to. You can just put that on.

What's that?

back to college.

01:17:21,135 --> 01:17:25,530
I had a boyfriend who was an art major.
Made me pose for him.

980
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:31,449
So... Mel isn't the first person
that you've been in love with.

981
01:17:33,538 --> 01:17:36,367
Gosh, no.
I've loved a few men.

982
01:17:36,411 --> 01:17:39,240
Maybe even one woman.

983
01:17:41,938 --> 01:17:46,856
Did you love any of them
more than they loved you?

984
01:17:46,899 --> 01:17:48,945
Oh, probably.

985
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:50,294
Didn't that scare you?

986
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:55,908
Knowing that someone could you hurt
you more than you could hurt them?

987
01:17:55,952 --> 01:17:57,954
Yeah. Maybe at first.

988
01:17:57,998 --> 01:18:01,305
But then I think I realized if you
protect yourself from the lows,

989
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:05,005
you just end up missing
all the highs too.

990
01:18:08,356 --> 01:18:10,271
You love Skylar. Don't you?

991
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:17,669
I think I'm screwing it up.

992
01:18:18,975 --> 01:18:23,458
Yeah. If it's not opening old
wounds, it's probably not true love.

993
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,765
I just don't
know what to do.

994
01:18:28,115 --> 01:18:31,292
How do I get Skylar
to understand that...

995
01:18:32,902 --> 01:18:34,643
I love him. [chuckles]

996
01:18:36,993 --> 01:18:38,821
You start by saying it.

997
01:18:41,345 --> 01:18:43,652
You need to hear
the words, Tessa.

998
01:18:44,392 --> 01:18:46,263
You mean, he needs
to hear the words.

999
01:18:46,307 --> 01:18:49,788
No. You need to hear
yourself say them.

1000
01:18:51,703 --> 01:18:53,053
Out loud.

1001
01:18:54,184 --> 01:18:56,795
So the world knows
your feelings count.

1002
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,842
That you count.

01:19:05,978 --> 01:19:07,502
Vickie, I'm sorry.

1004
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,071
For how I've treated you.

1005

Hey Google, dim the lights.

1006
01:19:28,088 --> 01:19:30,568
- Yes!
- Oh, man. No smoke machine?

1007
01:19:30,612 --> 01:19:31,656
Shh!

1008
01:19:32,396 --> 01:19:34,224
We begin this invocation

1009
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:36,661
by asking the
Archangel Michael

1010
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:39,186
to protect us against
any malevolent spirits

1011
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:42,928
- that may be seeking a gateway into this earthbound sphere.
- You wrote this?

1012
01:19:43,538 --> 01:19:45,496
- You're interrupting my invocation.
- I'm sorry!

1013
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,150
It's just... This is crazy.

1014
01:19:47,194 --> 01:19:48,934
Did you read all of
these books in two days?

1015
01:19:48,978 --> 01:19:52,155
Bitch, yes! You know speed
reading is my super power.

1016
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:55,245
Enjoy Your Own Funeral.

1017
01:19:55,289 --> 01:19:58,422
Yeah. That happens
to be a classic

1018
01:19:58,466 --> 01:20:01,469
of the paranormal
metaphysical genre.

1019
01:20:01,512 --> 01:20:03,166
- Now hush.
- Okay.

01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:06,038
[pop music playing]

1021
01:20:06,082 --> 01:20:07,866
We seek to communicate

1022
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:12,132
only with the disembodies spirit
formerly known as Skylar Adams.

1023
01:20:13,307 --> 01:20:15,178
No other spirits, please.

1024
01:20:16,701 --> 01:20:17,702
Okay.

1025
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:23,099
- A Ouija board?
- Please, Tess. This is a planchette.

1026
01:20:23,143 --> 01:20:25,928
There's a pencil tip
attached to the bottom.

1027
01:20:25,971 --> 01:20:29,279
We ask questions and Skylar
communicates by moving our hands.

1028
01:20:29,323 --> 01:20:31,325
Just like he did in the gym.

1029
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,370
Here. Fingers right there.

1030
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,894
Okay.

1031
01:20:35,938 --> 01:20:37,548
Close your eyes.

1032
01:20:40,334 --> 01:20:44,207
- [gasps] Oh, my God, it moved.

It wasn't just that my camera was
a way for me to express myself.

I believed that,

if I just ignored
these ghosts,

01:50:34,256 --> 01:50:36,519
they would
eventually go away.

to be a mistake.

01:50:57,279 --> 01:50:58,802
What are we supposed to do?

1373
01:51:02,023 --> 01:51:03,677
It has taken...

1374
01:51:04,852 --> 01:51:07,420
great personal loss

1375
01:51:08,073 --> 01:51:10,379
for me to discover the
answer to this question.

1376
01:51:13,469 --> 01:51:16,298
We must attend
to our ghosts.

1377
01:51:17,169 --> 01:51:21,042
We must welcome them
into our lives

1378
01:51:21,086 --> 01:51:25,220
as though they are part of us,
because they are part of us.

1379
01:51:29,616 --> 01:51:34,316
It's only when we acknowledge their presence
will they make room for new possibilities.

1380
01:51:36,449 --> 01:51:40,148
In the end, I've learned that our
ghosts are part of who we are,

1381
01:51:40,192 --> 01:51:41,715
part of who we hope to be.

1382
01:51:43,412 --> 01:51:46,198
These hauntings
stay inside us,

1383
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:49,070
tethered to our
hearts forever.

1384
01:51:50,898 --> 01:51:52,291
In life.

1385
01:51:53,901 --> 01:51:55,163
In death.

1386
01:51:56,077 --> 01:52:00,125

in-between.
