1
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,344
How lovely she is.

2
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,188
So much of her mother.

3
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,023
Do not be afraid.

4
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,027
I am here to take
you to a good life.

5
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,901
A life that you were born to.

6
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,061
Here.

7
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,639
Elizabeth Murray! Bring yourself
back here this very moment!

8
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,142
Her mother is dead.

9
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,639
I beg you, Uncle... love her,
as I would were I here...

10
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,559
and ensure that she is in receipt

11
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,479
of all that is due to
her as a child of mine.

12
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,239
That is simply impossible.

13
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,465
What is right... can
never be impossible.

14
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,759
She is black.

15
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,319
She is my blood.

16
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,879
But she is black.

17
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,309
A detail you chose not
to share with us.

18
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,759
In a few hours I am to captain a voyage
to the Indies on a longitude experiment.

19
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,279
After that, who knows?

20
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,359
It is not in my gift to question
the King and his Royal Navy.

21
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,679
Do you have in mind my
position, my reputation?

22
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,879
- Sir.
- I am the Lord Chief Justice.

23
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,663
Have some sense of propriety, boy, and
understand what it is you are asking.

24
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,823
She is a mulatto.

25
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,389
What has she been named?

26
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,188
She is Belle. After her mother.

27
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,505
Dido Elizabeth Belle Lindsay.

28
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,239
She takes your name?

29
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,349
I am not ashamed.

30
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,742
We will call her Dido.

31
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,079
Good Lord, she is thin.

32
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,543
Mary, find her some food.

33
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,904
Sweet child.

34
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,064
A ship is...

35
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,546
no place for one so
precious as you.

36
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,384
In these walls...

37
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,261
yours will be a life
equal to my blood.

38
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,279
And you will not understand
in this moment...

39
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,141
but know in your
heart you are loved.

40
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,427
Just as I loved your mother.

41
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,119
Are you what they call a 'negro'?
I heard them talking.

42
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,159
Questions, Elizabeth. A most irritating
trait you share with your father.

43
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,519
Papa M?

44
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,679
No! Your birth papa,
Sir David Murray.

45
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,919
You should not always insist on
speaking your mind, you know.

46
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,399
You'll end up an old maid, with only
your own company as entertainment.

47
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,182
Like you, Aunt Mary?
That's what the maids say.

48
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,959
Oh, you little...

49
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,079
Just wait till I catch you.

50
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,189
Elizabeth, come back
here this moment!

51
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,186
There's one of me, too.
Would you like to see it?

52
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,901
William Murray.
1st Earl of Mansfield.

53
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,581
Now...

54
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,799
this is my nephew.
Do you understand?

55
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,599
It's your uncle...
Sir David Murray.

56
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,719
Elizabeth's papa?

57
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,627
Yes, that's right.
You're very sharp.

58
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,743
7th Viscount Stormont
who will inherit...

59
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,705
everything we are standing on...
when I am gone.

60
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,079
Born on English soil.

61
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,381
Indeed.

62
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,599
He discovered her mother aboard
a captured Spanish slave ship.

63
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,542
So... now we have 2 nieces
in our guardianship.

64
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,066
Well, Elizabeth was in
much need of a companion.

65
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,222
And that is what we shall say
when questions are asked.

66
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,519
We shall say that, in accordance
with her birthright...

67
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,426
she is entitled to live
beneath this roof.

68
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,742
That is the nature of order.

69
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,621
And where in that order
should her color be placed?

70
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,749
Above or below her
Murray bloodline?

71
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,582
- Marriage?
- Impossible.

72
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,839
Any match her 'other origins'
would attract would...

73
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,940
surely disgrace her and
the family's rank.

74
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,667
And when we are no longer here?

75
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,102
No husband... who will
take care of her then?

76
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,462
<i>Ring a ring o' roses
A pocket full of posies</i>

77
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,439
<i>Atishoo, atishoo We all fall down!</i>

78
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,981
Girls!

79
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,879
Will you refrain from shrieking!
Like the blessed French!

80
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,745
I have no experience in the ways
of breaking grave news to you.

81
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,341
I had thought I should one day...

82
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,707
have the opportunity to make
his better acquaintance.

83
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,261
Yes.

84
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,030
Yes, I know.

85
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,581
£2,000 a year?

86
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,705
Then you are an heiress.
He has left you your fortune.

87
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,066
My father's new wife wishes him
to leave me not a thing...

88
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,742
and he obliges her.

89
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,106
I think he might have loved
me more if mama had not died.

90
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,065
I think... love must be a
very complicated thing.

91
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,999
With such a dowry,

92
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,986
you may marry into any
good family you wish.

93
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,188
We shall be receiving
visitors for dinner.

94
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,946
Visitors? Whoever bothers
to visit us here?

95
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,199
Or leave, except the dead.

96
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,025
Once again, Dido?

97
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,302
Beds... Aunt Mary.

98
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,639
We should prepare some extra beds
in case our visitors are to stay.

99
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,119
- May we wear the new silk?
- I will do your hair, Bette.

100
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,519
Say we may wear them, Aunt Mary.

101
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,505
You will not be
dining with us, Dido.

102
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,386
Of course.

103
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,999
But I may join after
dinner, may I not?

104
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,782
Yes. Such are the rules
and you know them well.

105
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,319
Papa, how may I be too high in
rank to dine with the servants...

106
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,624
and too low to dine with my family?

107
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,985
Dinner with guests is a
formal proceeding, Dido.

108
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,239
We simply can't impose upon visitors
our disregard of those formalities.

109
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,225
But... am I not wealthy now?

110
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,399
An heiress? Surely
that changes matters.

111
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,704
Oh, my dear. If it were so simple.

112
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,199
Finance may go some way but...

113
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,679
society has a habit of disregarding
even one of its own...

114
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,519
when opportunity provides.

115
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,079
But after dinner,

116
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,119
when formality is of
less consequence...

117
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,039
well...

118
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,389
your presence can raise
no defendable objections.

119
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,181
As you wish... sir.

120
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,959
I would rather dine with Dido.

121
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,319
What a great pity. Our young gentlemen
guests will miss you, Elizabeth.

122
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,719
Young gentlemen?

123
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,239
Very good connections.

124
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,905
And most agreeable by all accounts.

125
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,439
Now close your mouth
and understand.

126
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,267
There shall be no discussion tonight
in any language but English.

127
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,559
No whispering in gentlemen's
ears, not in Latin, Italian...

128
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,431
and certainly not in French.

129
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,639
I must say, the entire
country barely breathes...

130
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,944
awaiting your judgment
on the <i>Zong</i> appeal.

131
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,590
Terrified you will destroy
England, no doubt.

132
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,519
I know Lord Ashford is.

133
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,303
He does wonder, however, what
might be taking you so long.

134
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,385
The law, Lady Ashford, it is to be
interpreted not merely administered.

135
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,151
Your husband, of all
people, knows this.

136
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,039
Oh, what a lot of
fuss over dead cargo.

137
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,959
It is a fuss over the
bread and butter of...

138
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,185
a great many people in this
country, Lady Ashford.

139
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,780
Why, what wonderful French.

140
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,989
Though I have not an
idea of what you said.

141
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
- Wimbridge.
- Miss Lindsay?

142
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,307
There are poachers wandering.

143
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,119
Good evening to you. Uh...
My name is John Davinier.

144
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,159
I believe I may have disturbed a lady
of this house. Ah! There she is.

145
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,319
Please, forgive me,
though you barely...

146
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,519
Sir, I do not believe we
have been introduced.

147
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,821
Indeed.

148
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,839
Please inform the lady of my
apologies for startling her.

149
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,510
I took a shortcut to deliver this
to Lord Mansfield. From my father.

150
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,981
Sir?

151
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,519
Reverend... Davinier.

152
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,679
I will see that he
gets it immediately...

153
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,959
You shall not interrupt
him at dinner.

154
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,199
Immediately after dinner, sir.

155
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,741
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.

156
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,670
Dido, my dear.

157
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,959
Papa?

158
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,519
Good Lord, it's the negro.
She really is...

159
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,719
- A lady.
- Capital.

160
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,024
I had no idea she
would be so... black.

161
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,079
Did you not listen to the rumors
when you were spreading them, Mama?

162
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,039
May I present the second of my
two nieces: Miss Dido Lindsay.

163
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,388
A pleasure, Miss Lindsay.

164
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,919
James is the eldest.

165
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,383
To inherit the entire
Ashford fortune.

166
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,719
He's also to inherit
from his uncle...

167
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,519
a healthy man, who shows
little sign of departure.

168
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,300
She is intriguing, is she not?

169
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,382
I find her repulsive.

170
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,071
Well, I suppose she is... if you find
a most rare and exotic flower so.

171
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,821
He has much to recommend him.

172
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,588
And a second fortune in life
should please any wife.

173
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,719
Dido. You are not to be
a coquette with him.

174
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,239
You already have your fortune.

175
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,704
One does not make a wife of
the rare and exotic, Oliver.

176
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,559
One samples it on the
cotton fields of the Indies.

177
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,959
Why so far when it
is right at my door?

178
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,119
Good Lord, they are appraising me.

179
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,790
Then find a pure English rose
to decorate one's home.

180
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,108
<i>Britain hail
O hail to thee</i>

181
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,909
<i>Fairest island in the sea</i>

182
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,020
<i>Though my favorite land shalt be</i>

183
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,623
Is she 'out'?

184
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,590
Not quite.

185
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,144
Any day now.

186
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,942
<i>Though my favorite land shalt be</i>

187
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,079
<i>Britain hail All hail to thee</i>

188
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,430
<i>Fairest island in the sea?</i>

189
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,302
You will refrain from any
intercourse with the negro.

190
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,599
They may find it fascinating to have a Lady
mulatto running around in their house...

191
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,519
but I will not have one
running around in mine.

192
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,189
- She is an heiress.
- Although exceptions can be made.

193
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,460
It is said her father left
her a rather vast fortune.

194
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,039
I mean to say, if that
is your inclination.

195
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,028
She is rather soft on the eye.
I have thought no further of it, Mama.

196
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,599
Where do you get your information?

197
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,824
Her sister-cousin has
a rather fast tongue.

198
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,707
And what of you, Miss Lindsay?

199
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,780
Are we to hear you play tonight?

200
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,461
Well...

201
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,039
Papa?

202
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,344
Oh, do not be selfish with
your good fortune, m'Lord.

203
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,999
This will be most interesting.

204
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,825
She's never played in company.

205
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,584
She is... most accomplished.

206
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,505
Hers was a most diligent governess.

207
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,879
His family name will no doubt
induce her to take him seriously.

208
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,399
She must not delude herself. Such
decisions are not hers to make.

209
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,719
Well, then spell it out to her...

210
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,599
before she renders herself sport
to some 'gent' of cruel promises.

211
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,399
She has no reason. Her inheritance
leaves her free to marry.

212
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,623
That at least is true.

213
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,783
It is Elizabeth who must
secure her bread and butter.

214
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,439
A portrait? Are you sure?

215
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,919
Yes. Aunt Mary has confirmed it.

216
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,399
Good Lord, how truly wonderful.

217
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,399
- But...
- But what?

218
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,466
Papa, should he not have wished
to see me before deciding?

219
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,301
Sorry, I did not know you...

220
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,839
Mr. Davinier, I believe you've
already had the pleasure.

221
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,508
In some way, yes. Miss Lindsay.

222
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,799
Decide what?

223
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,999
If he should... should
want to paint me.

224
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,759
The man is to be paid a fortune.
What is there to decide?

225
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,668
You are simply to sit still, Dido.
Not a very challenging task.

226
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,319
Next to Elizabeth?

227
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,464
As you always are,
right beside each other.

228
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,879
Should not any lady be flattered
to be such a subject?

229
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,519
How should any male
know the ways of a lady

230
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,879
when he has not even mastered
the ways of a gentleman?

231
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,559
Quite. Though one should be
forgiven for thinking...

232
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,159
he is in the presence of a lady

233
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,799
when she is, in fact,
still a juvenile.

234
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,879
- Papa! May we do this in private?
- No, not now.

235
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,865
You may take the books
back to the library.

236
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,399
Upon the death of her husband,
a widow may receive...

237
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,359
her marriage portion and
her inheritance at once.

238
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,159
She has 40 days to leave
her husband's home.

239
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,159
Mr. Davinier, what is the purpose
of the law, in your eyes?

240
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,079
To provide certainty where
there otherwise might be none.

241
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,381
Example?

242
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,906
The <i>Zong</i> ship and those drowned.

243
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,839
The law is one of the few trades
acceptable to a gentleman.

244
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,759
I have little...

245
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,399
but where my father
relies on the Bible,

246
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,919
I wish to rely on the law courts.

247
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,919
And you aspire to the judiciary?

248
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,079
One day, yes, my Lord.

249
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,420
I wish to make the laws, for that is
how I may truly change this world.

250
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,191
That is I... I mean to say...

251
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,868
make it a better place.

252
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,423
You have grand ambitions.

253
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,588
A country lawyer you may make if you
pay attention to what you are taught.

254
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,279
But you have neither the rank
nor the finances for any more.

255
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,265
Well if I may, my Lord,
neither did you.

256
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,582
I beg your pardon?

257
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,421
Well...

258
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,103
as a fourth son...

259
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,719
you had rank but not the income

260
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,079
to pay for your
qualification to the Inns.

261
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,559
Without the sponsorship of Lord
Foley and William Hamilton...

262
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,599
the English courts might not have
benefited from your brilliance...

263
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,542
and the title Lord Chief Justice
could not be yours today... my Lord.

264
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,639
And you think you are worthy
of such considerations?

265
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,519
Of that I do not know, my Lord,

266
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,439
but I do know that a country
life does not suit me.

267
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,741
Dido...

268
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,109
the Reverend Davinier has asked me
to take his son under my tutelage.

269
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,590
What do you think?

270
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,628
Thank you for your
gracious support.

271
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,199
I neither spoke for or against
you since neither is my place.

272
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,946
Silence speaks volumes.

273
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,039
Papa's new student.

274
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,879
Mr. Davinier...
my cousin, Elizabeth.

275
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,199
A pleasure.

276
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,679
Papa has never taken a
pupil, you realize?

277
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,279
Someone to keep you company while
you take papa's dictation, Dido.

278
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,347
Truth is, there have been more men here
this week than I've seen in my entire life.

279
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,021
Hopefully we have not disappointed.

280
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,024
On the contrary.

281
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,146
Mr. Davinier, what...

282
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,519
what is the importance of the <i>Zong?</i>

283
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,382
Why is the case before papa's
court, the Supreme Court?

284
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,701
Well...

285
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,064
it is a ship.

286
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,703
I am aware of that.

287
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,226
It is... a human cargo ship.

288
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,261
Oh.

289
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,986
It... it lost most of its slaves
before arriving at its destination.

290
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,906
Drowned by the crew,
on the captain's orders.

291
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,589
But... why?

292
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,559
Miss, your supper is served
now in the ladies' parlor.

293
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,225
Thank you.

294
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,584
Will you be joining us for
dinner, Mr. Davinier?

295
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,879
Uh... Thank you, madam,
but I am promised to

296
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,639
the company of my
aunt this evening.

297
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,022
Very well, as you wish.

298
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,708
Permit me to ask, but...

299
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,479
why do you not dine
with your family ever?

300
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,319
That is not correct.

301
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,919
Forgive me but twice now I have seen
you separated from the gathering.

302
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,479
I am confounded.

303
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,599
And well you might be...

304
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,950
when the son of clergy is permitted to
the table before a lady of the house.

305
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,359
Is that a reminder of my place?

306
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,311
No. It is a statement of mine.

307
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,839
<i>132 drowned en route from
Africa to the West Indies.</i>

308
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,079
Your ruling could bring the
slave trade to its knees...

309
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,399
entirely destroying an economic
foundation of this land.

310
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,239
Is that pressure not
maddening, my Lord?

311
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,749
<i>"Justitia fiat, ruat
coelum</i>, " Mr Davinier.

312
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,827
"Let justice be done, though
the heavens may fall."

313
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,279
The insurance claim states

314
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,399
the slaves were thrown overboard
for the safety of the ship.

315
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,559
That there wasn't sufficient water
to survive the rest of the voyage.

316
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,919
- It does.
- Then, if I'm correct, the case hangs on...

317
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,199
it hangs on 'absolute necessity'.

318
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,039
If the killing of the negroes
was truly necessary...

319
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,359
to save the ship, as
the captain contends.

320
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,959
But is that where it hinges?

321
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,740
No man happily
disposes of his cargo.

322
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,119
Let me ask you: were
you to enter a port...

323
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,108
with barely one piece of merchandise
left to trade, what would you do?

324
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,103
Swallow financial ruin or seek
recompense from your insurer?

325
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,064
With due respect...

326
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,424
I should question whether human life
should be insurable as cargo at all.

327
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,423
A gentleman rather like him
once showed me great interest.

328
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,999
Mr. Davinier?

329
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,479
Really, Mary?

330
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,942
Well, don't look at me like that.

331
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,461
It was my mama who intervened.

332
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,469
I thought he had a very
great sense of duty.

333
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,119
A little over-kind at times but...

334
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,990
He is engaged, you know?

335
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,639
- Is he?
- Engaged.

336
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,519
Mr. Beresford's daughter.

337
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,825
The carriage-maker? He might have
set his sights a little higher.

338
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,759
I do love roses.

339
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,427
Everything's a little
late this year.

340
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,359
For it is the power of
God unto salvation...

341
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,664
so sayeth Christ the Lord. Amen.

342
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,421
Hymn number 76.

343
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,870
Mr. Davinier.

344
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,741
Wait.

345
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,429
I was curious.

346
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,581
Quite a task... to sit
for so many hours.

347
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,711
Of course.

348
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,062
I appear the only one to have
just learned of the <i>Zong</i> case.

349
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,399
Perhaps yours is a life less
concerned with such matters.

350
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,270
Why do you judge me so?

351
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,790
It is a fact that I have contemplated
on the matter for many hours and I...

352
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,439
I do not think the
slaves could have been

353
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,720
drowned in the way that you say.

354
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,631
Are you at utter disconnect
from everything?

355
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,624
Mr. Davinier, please.

356
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,068
Tell me what you know.

357
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,871
Tell me.

358
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,941
Do not render me your amusement.

359
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,239
I can only tell you what I believe.

360
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,147
And what... what is that?

361
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,665
The slaves were thrown
into the waters...

362
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,231
chained together as one.

363
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,823
They were diseased...

364
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,985
worth more as dead insured merchandise,
than as alive spoiled goods.

365
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,266
Miss Lindsay...

366
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,199
But the insurers are appealing?

367
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,663
They are refusing to pay
for murdered slaves.

368
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,670
Thank you.

369
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,639
You told her they were
wantonly drowned?

370
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,879
They were diseased, but it was essential
that they die on the journey...

371
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,559
or they would not come under
the insurance consideration.

372
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,639
Neither, too, if they had expired of their
diseases. That is why they were killed.

373
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,079
You have taken advantage of
confidential matters afforded you.

374
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,829
These 'matters' have been for
public consumption for months.

375
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,159
Miss Lindsay is
no child... no fool.

376
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,199
Her precious care is in my hands...

377
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,039
and I will decide when she is
ready for such realities...

378
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,468
not the son of a vicar!

379
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,839
I will gather my belongings.

380
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,380
Do so.

381
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,742
Your Lordship, a question.

382
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,227
Well?

383
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,959
As the mere son of a vicar...

384
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,221
I wonder whether the value you extend
to your very precious mulatto niece...

385
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,119
amounts to the £30 insurance

386
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,344
the traders are asking for
each life they murdered?

387
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,479
Good day, my Lord.

388
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,020
Mr. Davinier...

389
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,239
find yourself in her
vicinity again...

390
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,262
and I will make you rue the
day you ever set eyes on me.

391
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,105
John Davinier is leaving
very early today.

392
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,999
There you are. We are requested.

393
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,799
You: drawing room. I relegated
to the ladies' parlor.

394
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,479
We are to attend
London for the season.

395
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,831
We are to finally 'come out'?

396
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,303
Elizabeth is to come out.

397
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,744
Dido is not.

398
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,519
But... why?

399
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,039
You understand the ways of
the world for a female, Dido.

400
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,719
Elizabeth has no income.

401
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,599
You are to meet as many gentlemen as
possible before we make the match.

402
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,799
When all this has gone to her father,
there'll be nothing left for her.

403
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,399
And... me?

404
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,399
Any gentleman of good breeding...

405
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,279
would be unlikely to form a
serious attachment to Dido.

406
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,187
And a man without would lower
her position in society.

407
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,759
She's not merely my cousin, Mama.

408
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,999
- Papa, please.
- She is my sister.

409
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,999
These are the keys of the house.

410
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,039
I cannot attend London without her.

411
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,342
They have hung at your
aunt's waist for 30 years.

412
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,999
I am not Lady Mary.
I am not an unwanted maid.

413
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,639
Lady Mary is too old to continue
in charge of the house.

414
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,679
You may take up your
duties on your return.

415
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,109
Lord knows I'll need the two of you
to keep each other out of trouble.

416
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,143
Are you punishing me?

417
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,024
Punishing you?

418
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,703
You are most cherished.

419
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,704
Most loved.

420
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,381
I'm so very sorry.

421
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,104
Do you think I may see
Mr. James in town?

422
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,821
Perhaps.

423
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,304
I could fall in love
with such a man, Dido.

424
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,027
Love?

425
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,225
Hmm.

426
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,159
Bette, you shall feel
no such sentiment...

427
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,782
for you shall either end
poor or broken-hearted.

428
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,959
Aren't you quietly relieved...

429
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,559
that you shan't be at the caprice

430
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,828
of some silly Sir and his fortune?

431
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,781
The rest of us haven't the choice.

432
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,959
Not a chance of inheritance
if we have brothers...

433
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,424
and forbidden from any activity that
allows us to support ourselves.

434
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,461
We are but their property.

435
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,386
Girls! Come along now.

436
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,839
Light the fires for
dinner, will you, Thomas?

437
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,346
Certainly, ma'am.

438
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,945
Thank you.

439
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,665
Some bed-socks for
you, Miss Murray.

440
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,919
Miss Lindsay.

441
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,959
Thank you, Mabel. How kind.

442
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,740
It's not as warm as
we'd hoped tonight.

443
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,227
Can I help you with
that, Miss Lindsay?

444
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,227
You must start from the ends, miss.

445
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,703
My mam taught me.

446
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,741
See?

447
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,199
Promise me you will do something
about that vulgar teal paint...

448
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,799
if you ever become
lady of this house.

449
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,039
It is positively
wanting, Elizabeth.

450
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,719
Lady Mansfield, Lady Mary
and their nieces, madam.

451
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,102
- Ladies.
- Lady Ashford.

452
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,479
And the gentlemen? Mr. James?

453
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,399
Here, of course.

454
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,025
Nothing could have prevented him knowing
that Miss Murray was visiting today.

455
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,621
Papa.

456
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,626
Lord Mansfield's infamous mulatto.

457
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,824
No wonder our Lord Chief Justice knows
not whether he's coming or going.

458
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,025
Well she cannot know your thoughts
unless you offer them to her.

459
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,999
Ah, the Ladies Mansfield.

460
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,382
Come here.

461
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,999
Careful.

462
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,919
Oh, Dido, look, Mr. James has made
me a boat and it has capsized.

463
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,222
What a dreadful shame.

464
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,271
For you.

465
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,508
Miss Lindsay, would you do me the honor
of taking some air with me... sometime?

466
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,599
Don't you care what
people will say?

467
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,439
What is that to mean, Mr. James?

468
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,663
What should anyone say?

469
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,959
That he would compromise
a lady's reputation...

470
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,359
by stepping out with her scarcely
having made her acquaintance.

471
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,759
I think you are a great
deal too anxious, brother.

472
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,745
We should merely take a
turn around Vauxhall.

473
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,985
I should be delighted, Mr. Oliver.

474
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,270
Most delighted.

475
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,347
Are you really to defy papa?

476
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,799
I did not think I would
ever find a lady

477
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,706
who was not to be
conquered or ignored...

478
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,199
until you.

479
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,159
I am not at ease with this. Lord
Mansfield would be most aggrieved.

480
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,919
Oh... it can do no harm.

481
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,999
We are just two families
spending some time together.

482
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,279
Although, if a desirable match

483
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,981
were a possibility...

484
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,983
your dear husband could have
no objection, could he?

485
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,425
Oh, they've disappeared. People
will think she has no family.

486
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,263
People will think
they are courting.

487
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,959
See how my heart beats?

488
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,867
I am utterly taken with
you, Miss Lindsay.

489
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,519
Despite such pronounced
protestations from your brother?

490
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,022
He cannot overlook your
mother's origins as I do.

491
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,951
Foolish.

492
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,959
Why should anyone even
pay her regard...

493
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,519
when your better half has
equipped you so well with...

494
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,119
with loveliness and privilege?

495
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,384
What a lovely sound.

496
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,151
You are unrelentingly cultured.
Come, let's find it.

497
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,304
I do hope you know how
well I think of you.

498
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,705
As I do you.

499
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,787
I might have only dreamed of
these moments, at one time.

500
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,199
Really?

501
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,822
Then I hope you plan to
honor your attentions...

502
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,186
as not to would leave me
looking quite foolish.

503
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,991
And I should not call
myself a gentleman.

504
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,026
You are much of the
conqueror, Mr. Oliver.

505
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,999
- Mr. Davinier.
- Miss Lindsay.

506
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,301
How...

507
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,879
how nice to see you.

508
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,830
And you, Miss Lindsay.

509
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,384
Forgive me. Uh...

510
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,864
Mr. Ashford, may I
present to you...

511
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,587
Mr. Davinier. He is the son
of our vicar at Hampstead.

512
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,104
A clergyman.

513
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,788
Good evening to you, sir.

514
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,941
Sir.

515
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,239
Miss Lindsay. You are alone.

516
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,199
I did not have the chance to see you
before you left to convey my apologies.

517
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,039
- Apologies?
- Your pupillage.

518
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,959
Father would never have ended it, you
never would have had to leave Kenwood...

519
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,310
He would make mine a living hell
were he to know of us speaking.

520
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,942
I have tried to keep
up with the <i>Zong</i>...

521
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,107
Forgive me.

522
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,559
I have tried to keep up...
with the <i>Zong</i>.

523
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,959
'Tis pitiful. Such
inability to simply know

524
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,399
what value to put
on another's life.

525
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,519
What price a worthless negro?

526
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,679
You utterly misunderstand me.

527
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,631
I am saying that no man may
have the value of cargo.

528
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:26,879
Human beings cannot be priced since we
are priceless. Freemen and slaves alike.

529
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,159
I am with others here.
All students in law...

530
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,159
applying pressure on the
insurance companies...

531
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,159
to refuse from hereon to
insure slaves on any ship.

532
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,519
But that would require
a change in law.

533
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,462
How can we expect to be civilized when
we live in such a barbaric world?

534
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,999
It is the utter injustice.

535
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,064
It is more than that.

536
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,279
It is the shame of a
law that would uphold

537
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,559
a financial transaction
upon that atrocity.

538
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,942
That is indeed the truth.

539
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,759
I have never heard
anyone speak like you.

540
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,381
Nor I you, Miss Lindsay.

541
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,024
You should return.
They will be anxious.

542
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,303
Goodbye, Miss Lindsay.

543
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,304
Goodbye... Mr. Davinier.

544
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,705
Miss Lindsay...

545
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,263
we commune at the coaching
inn, Kentish Town...

546
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,709
most evenings.

547
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,661
Quite.

548
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,305
Elizabeth is a determined spirit.

549
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,466
She will need a gentleman
who can temper her.

550
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,439
Quite a task.

551
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,839
Do I sense that an address
is finally to be made?

552
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,427
She is an exquisite girl.

553
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,359
And since there is no male heir...

554
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,559
it will fall upon Elizabeth
and her husband...

555
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,626
eventually, to inherit
Kenwood and all its lands.

556
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,028
I realize that there will be many
worthy addresses to consider.

557
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,862
Lady Mansfield, what is it?

558
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,559
Penniless?

559
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,306
Without an inch of property
or a shilling to her name.

560
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:37,599
Do you hear that, James? A lady's
good breeding alone will not do.

561
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,799
Your brother needs a wife who
can bring him more land...

562
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,549
if he is ever to exert more political
influence than your father has!

563
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,999
But what of her own father?

564
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,021
The 7th Viscount
Stormont is a scoundrel.

565
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,839
Ensconced in Vienna with that girl's
vicious step-mama and his new offspring...

566
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,508
who, I am told,
is to inherit everything.

567
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,704
I must say, pen-ni-less!

568
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,279
Though, thankfully,
her cousin is not.

569
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,319
Each time I set eyes on that
girl she becomes more beautiful.

570
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,759
She has the coloring of a farmer.

571
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,079
James, you are my first boy... blessed
by law to inherit your father's wealth.

572
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,399
Be sympathetic to your brother.

573
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,799
Like the unfortunate Miss Murray...

574
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,469
good family name and empty pockets
will only get him so far.

575
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,308
Is Mabel a slave?

576
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,064
I beg your pardon?

577
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,907
Is Mabel a slave?

578
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,799
She is free and under
our protection.

579
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,341
Oh, like me.

580
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,545
Hardly, Dido.

581
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,870
And paid a very respectable wage.

582
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,839
How is the fraud appeal, Papa?

583
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,141
Fraud?

584
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,506
The marine insurance.
It is a fraud case, is it not?

585
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,279
It depends on who you speak to.

586
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,786
To cull your 'cargo'?

587
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,799
Solely to claim insurance...

588
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,199
because it was too diseased to
achieve a good price at market...

589
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,719
if not fraud, then what?

590
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,181
Do you speak on my behalf?

591
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,827
Will you please stop!

592
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,342
This is a vulgar subject
to discuss at breakfast.

593
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,986
I learned yesterday...
Mr. Davinier is in town.

594
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,266
I'm not surprised Dido is beginning
to sound very much like him.

595
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,911
Excuse me.

596
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,825
I had the pleasure of laying
eyes on your adopted girl.

597
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,870
You have raised a lovely young lady and
though I understand she is kept under...

598
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,839
interesting rules, she
raises questions.

599
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,439
Oh?

600
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,399
Her introduction to society comes at
a key time in the insurance appeal.

601
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,559
Parliament is nervous
that the situation

602
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,759
in your family will
color your judgment.

603
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,199
I will not have pressure put on me,

604
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,519
either from the inside
or the outside.

605
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,319
You are the highest
judge in the land.

606
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,159
In you they see a man who is of the
persuasion and the power to bring down...

607
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,879
the greatest trade of our time and the
commercial health of this country.

608
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,799
Some will say that,
next to our King,

609
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,719
you're the most powerful
man in England.

610
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,399
And the same will ask how you,
our Chief Justice, can be fair?

611
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,759
There are rules in place
which dictate how we live.

612
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,839
If that were not the case...

613
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,119
I would not have had the mandate

614
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,239
to give shelter to my
nephew's daughter.

615
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,759
She is his blood and mine...

616
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,559
and is rightfully entitled to be
brought up on the family estate.

617
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,999
If the law supports the
<i>Zong</i> slave owners...

618
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,199
as strongly as Murray blood runs
through the veins of Dido Belle...

619
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,188
then make no mistake, the
insurers will be forced to pay.

620
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,189
I believe you.

621
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,399
I, uh, have reason to speak
with you on another matter.

622
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,826
Yes?

623
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,948
I have a wish to seal the bond between
the Ashford and Mansfield names.

624
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,719
Whatever did happen in
the end, Aunt Mary?

625
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,740
With your gentleman friend.

626
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,349
He never married.

627
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,149
He died last year...

628
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,263
after a long illness.

629
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,663
Oh, Aunt Mary.

630
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,630
Pardon me.

631
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,461
Mr. Ashford is here for you, miss.

632
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,629
Which Mr. Ashford?

633
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,226
You need worry about nothing.
Papa has been dealt with.

634
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,910
Miss Lindsay.

635
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,790
Mr. Oliver.

636
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,750
I think...

637
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,279
well, I know...

638
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,199
that we make a rather good match.

639
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,439
Father has purchased me a
commission in the Navy as Captain.

640
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,424
All that remains...

641
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,719
Uh, I cannot offer you a title
for the next Lady Ashford...

642
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,149
well that title must fall
to my brother's wife.

643
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,982
What I'm trying to say is, uh...

644
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,861
is I can, without doubt...

645
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,359
offer you all that is due
to Mrs. Oliver Ashford...

646
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,028
and trust that this will
be acceptable to you...

647
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,543
since it would very
much be my privilege...

648
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,541
my honor, if you would
agree to become my wife.

649
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,190
- I cannot see!
- Shh!

650
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,185
Good Lord.

651
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,029
Mrs. Ashford.

652
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,861
I...

653
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,705
cannot...

654
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,549
- What are you doing?
- Quiet, Elizabeth.

655
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,227
cannot think of anything...

656
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,744
more wonderful.

657
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,383
Oh! She has agreed.

658
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,549
Mama, we are engaged.

659
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,999
Oh, my darling.

660
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,340
It is a good thing,
is it not, Mama?

661
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,271
Oh, it is a wonderful thing.

662
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,186
Dido.

663
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,106
Yes?

664
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,227
Was there any message for me?

665
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,910
No, Bette.

666
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,427
But I'm sure it won't be long.

667
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,901
What does it feel like, Dido?

668
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,709
To be engaged?

669
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,990
Perfect, Bette.

670
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,061
Perfect.

671
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,065
Papa?

672
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,465
Thank you.

673
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,559
We are to make many
calls today, Elizabeth.

674
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,468
Acquainting oneself with the most
eligible gentlemen is not light business.

675
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,679
Should we not wait a day
or two... for Mr. James?

676
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:13,144
Elizabeth, a word of advice.
Wait for no man, dear.

677
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,823
Will you join us, Dido?

678
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,141
Dido?

679
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,559
Oh. I am terribly light-headed
this morning, Mama.

680
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,159
I should like to take rest,
if it would not displease you.

681
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:38,182
Oh, dear. Unwell? And just as we're
about to announce your news.

682
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,701
Papa.

683
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,027
Let's see that smile. Come along.

684
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,069
Harry. Harry, I need your help.

685
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,239
- I need you to take me somewhere.
- Alone, miss?

686
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,907
I shall not be alone.
I shall be with you.

687
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,239
This is written anonymously.

688
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,759
I have a list of those who have
not yet indicated their position.

689
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,425
Mr. Davinier?

690
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,626
Mr. Davinier.

691
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,119
Miss Lindsay. I...

692
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,879
it is said all of the ship's
papers have been lost. But here...

693
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,479
I found these in papa's library.

694
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,305
What are they?

695
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,140
Papa's notes on the ship's log.

696
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,199
It seems the first mate
has come forward with it

697
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,946
one Mr. Stubbs.

698
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,639
I could not find the log itself

699
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,039
but look at papa's markings.

700
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,159
See the map positions.

701
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,519
Captain Collingwood and his men directed
the ship past no less than 8 ports...

702
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,719
where there was every opportunity

703
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,879
to replenish the
ship's water supplies.

704
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,319
- Good Lord.
- And they did not.

705
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,942
They either ignored the possibilities
or they were never in need.

706
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,504
This is remarkable.

707
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,119
Perhaps if you could

708
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,359
make these facts
known, Mr. Davinier.

709
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,439
This places you in an
impossible position

710
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,504
with Lord Mansfield.

711
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,188
What is the alternative?

712
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,399
Walk with me, Miss Lindsay.

713
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,239
The back of the inn is safe from
anyone who may know you.

714
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,225
There's no-one but blind
and crying drunks.

715
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,199
Papa would rather I
see no ill, as though

716
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,759
by ignoring it, it
somehow escapes me.

717
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,540
Perhaps by position but not...

718
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,185
not by blood.

719
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,542
The fault was never with you.

720
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,266
Just as in life, we are no
better in paintings.

721
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,065
You were afraid.

722
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,919
Afraid?

723
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,759
To be painted beside Miss Murray,

724
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,222
and I ridiculed you.

725
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,039
I feel ashamed.

726
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,342
Do not feel ashamed.

727
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,903
Elizabeth said something
when we arrived in London.

728
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,279
"We women are but the
property of gentlemen."

729
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,839
But it came into my
head that I have been

730
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,586
blessed with freedom twice over.

731
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,940
As a negro and as a woman.

732
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,279
I suppose you have.

733
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,866
Or have I?

734
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:46,110
Must not a lady marry even
if she is financially secure?

735
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,959
For who is she without a
husband of consequence?

736
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,199
It seems silly... like a free negro

737
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,839
who begs for a master.

738
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,141
Well...

739
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,265
unless... she marries her equal.

740
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,262
Her true equal.
A man who respects her.

741
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,940
I remember my father's eyes.

742
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,465
They were kind, gentle.

743
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,502
- A little like yours.
- Mine?

744
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,267
I mean... in color.

745
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,905
He showed me much love though
I only knew him a few hours.

746
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,630
What of your own mother?

747
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,359
I know very little of her

748
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,519
other than the color

749
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,981
she has given me.

750
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,945
Well then, at least you
know she was beautiful.

751
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,502
I am to marry... shortly.

752
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,344
Mr. Ashford.

753
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,101
Oh.

754
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,541
He is amiable and of good family.

755
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,866
Is it... what you want?

756
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,199
The alternative is
to replace Lady Mary

757
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,999
in her responsibilities at Kenwood.

758
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,159
But she's a spinster.

759
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,079
Papa did not trust I
could achieve a match

760
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,986
that would raise my
rank or even equal it.

761
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,906
You are above reducing
yourself for the sake of rank.

762
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,268
I pray he would marry you
without a penny to your name...

763
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,270
for that is a man who
would truly treasure you.

764
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,750
What if I shall never find someone
so incomparably suitable?

765
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,784
And wealthy?

766
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,919
What if he is suitable but you
do not feel 'yourself' with him?

767
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:09,020
Oh, Dido. He understood me.

768
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,799
And whenever he looked at me I
somehow felt better in this world.

769
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,759
I am convinced his
affections are growing

770
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,759
and I feel certain of my own love.

771
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,639
Oh, stop it! It is not love.

772
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,749
You stop it.

773
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,547
You know no more of love
than I myself, do you?

774
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,749
Do you, Dido?

775
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,461
No.

776
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,988
Oliver and Miss Lindsay
make a blissful match.

777
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,279
Exactly when is she due to
receive her inheritance?

778
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,106
And tell me, are you an only son?

779
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,079
I have 6 brothers, madam.

780
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,510
Six? Goodness. And...
are they all...

781
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,467
Older, madam? Yes.

782
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,825
Oh, do look. Here comes
the Baroness in her boat.

783
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,999
Oh, how dreadfully
wonderful, Lady M.

784
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,359
Your girl is a picture. An utter
picture. With her intended?

785
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,679
Indeed, Baroness Vernon.

786
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,119
And I see the other
does not give up.

787
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,479
So terribly endearing.

788
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,599
You must meet the Mansfield girl.

789
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,823
Still available.

790
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,519
Mama, Mr. Vaughn approaches.

791
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,199
I have checked, he has
no London home...

792
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,879
but he achieves an income of
no less than £4,000 a year.

793
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,182
Miss Murray. Lady Mansfield.

794
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,359
I trust your stay in London is
proving pleasant, Miss Murray.

795
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,469
Oh, most certainly.

796
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:48,311
I wonder if you might permit me to
call upon you at home... some time?

797
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,021
Oh.

798
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,999
With her Ladyship's permission?

799
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,302
I will make arrangements.

800
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,385
Miss Lindsay.

801
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,542
Not husband hunting, are we?

802
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,982
Good Lord, I forgot...

803
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,661
you have ensnared my brother.

804
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,908
Tell me, are you to share his
dining room as well as his bed?

805
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,959
Oh, Mr. James, your manners are as
poor as your brother's finances.

806
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,959
And you are foolish enough to
marry him. I, on the other hand...

807
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,264
have no further use for
your impoverished cousin.

808
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,222
Though she does make for
rather amusing sport.

809
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,119
That is painful, sir!

810
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,599
Have you never been manhandled?

811
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,759
It is not in my repertoire

812
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,381
to keep company with beasts.

813
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,463
How dare you!

814
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,110
With ease.

815
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,943
You will destroy us.

816
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:59,460
You will destroy the entire
order of our family.

817
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:13,631
<i>I'd never imagined myself to be
married, but my aunt is determined.</i>

818
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:19,946
If one were to count, I have not even
been acquainted with Miss Beresford on...

819
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,839
3 occasions.

820
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,999
Is she not terribly disappointed that
you will not return to Hampstead?

821
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,870
My aunt?

822
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,199
Well, I doubt Miss Beresford has any
more wish to marry me than I her.

823
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,879
I should rather make a nuisance
of myself alone in London...

824
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,309
than in an unwanted
marriage in Hampstead.

825
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,719
Where is everyone, Mabel?
All the carriages are gone.

826
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:48,039
The ladies and Miss Murray are
out calling, Your Lordship.

827
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,149
Is Dido with them?

828
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,104
- Um...
-  Shh.

829
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,144
I believe so.

830
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,469
Were you a curious child?

831
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,746
Completely. Elizabeth always
asked the questions for me.

832
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,546
Dear, dear Bette.

833
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,959
Papa is to finally speak
in a few days and...

834
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,559
I fear, despite persuasive argument,
your papa has not been moved.

835
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,039
I'm not certain he is ready
to go against the traders.

836
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,599
They are some of the most
powerful in these isles...

837
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,439
and theirs are the finances that
hold up England, after all.

838
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,711
The enemies of any man who stood
against the trade would be vicious.

839
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,429
And yet, if he does... stand up...

840
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,945
if he speaks the words and
condemns the trade...

841
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,279
<i>the Lord Chief Justice of England,
then it may be impossible...</i>

842
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,799
for the slave laws of England and
its colonies to remain absolute.

843
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,625
That is a fact.

844
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,869
I've heard nothing from
him since Vauxhall, Dido.

845
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:47,830
I was certain an announcement was to be
made any day... that he meant it this time.

846
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,985
Then he is not a man of his word.

847
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,159
I will help you find the kindest,
most wonderful of husbands.

848
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,301
And...

849
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:11,626
I shall ask papa to use a portion
of my inheritance for your dowry.

850
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,399
You would do that?

851
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,068
Bette... anything for you.

852
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,905
Dido...

853
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,519
I have been of the mind
these last few days that...

854
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,825
it is my little means that has delayed
James in making his approach.

855
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,239
I think you may be right.

856
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,559
Then I cannot thank you enough.

857
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,759
Bette?

858
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,279
I will ask papa to write
immediately to Lady Ashford.

859
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,581
No?

860
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:50,348
James Ashford is not kind.
He is not appropriate.

861
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,431
Appropriate?

862
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,959
The brother of the man you are to
marry is not appropriate for me?

863
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,786
He does not desire you, Bette!

864
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:06,028
Or at least, even if he does, you
would regret such a mistake.

865
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,787
He...

866
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:14,879
laid his hands on me, Bette... in
the most ungentlemanly fashion.

867
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,199
Why should you say such a thing?

868
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,319
He hurt me.

869
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,270
You are a liar!

870
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,306
- Why would I lie to you?
- I don't know.

871
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,319
Have you never been able to see?
He would never touch you!

872
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,941
- Bette...
- You are beneath him!

873
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,839
I am beneath him?

874
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,221
Yes.

875
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,279
- Yes! You are...
- What?

876
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,039
Tell me what I am, Bette!

877
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,342
You are...

878
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,942
you are illegitimate!

879
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,826
Have you never wondered why you were
not permitted to eat with our guests?

880
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,664
My mother and father never
married, you are correct.

881
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,144
But my father acknowledged
me as his child.

882
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,479
It is yours who refuses to legitimize your
position and that is why you are poor.

883
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:13,820
And that is why it is not me who is
beneath Mr. James. It is not me.

884
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,279
Whoa.

885
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,239
- Papa.
- This man's ambition includes you.

886
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:37,439
You will endure shame and risk your
position for a man without name...

887
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:41,079
who will sully yours and drag
your reputation into the gutter.

888
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,279
I take great offense at your summation
of my character without even knowing me.

889
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,199
- Where is your right?
- I have every right.

890
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:50,719
Not until you cease from
judging the entire world

891
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,479
as those above and those below...

892
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,639
and begin to see people as people.

893
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,079
Human beings who think

894
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,239
and feel no more or
less than you do.

895
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,599
I know there is a lady in Belsize

896
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,799
who is waiting to be your wife.

897
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,119
No, I have an ambitious
aunt in Belsize...

898
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,799
who, like you, assumes that
wealth and reputation...

899
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,879
are all that life depends on...

900
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,999
and despises love

901
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,079
as though it were

902
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,159
the devil's own creation!

903
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,066
- You claim love...
- Yes! Yes...

904
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,269
I love her!

905
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,584
I love her with every
breath I breathe!

906
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,824
Go, John.

907
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,941
You do not deserve this.

908
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,799
Captain Sir John Lindsay would
never have behaved like this.

909
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,140
He would never have behaved like
this because he was never here!

910
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,439
You are destroying
your possibilities

911
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,108
with the only gentleman
who will consider you.

912
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,148
Is that what you want?

913
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,830
Arrogant parasite!

914
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,439
Fills her head with
worthless ideals.

915
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,879
Wants to 'make the
world a better place'.

916
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:24,399
And his childish campaign simply
adds to the ridicule aimed at me...

917
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,319
in those contemptible pamphlets.

918
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,239
And now, like some kind of
saint, immune from reproach...

919
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:33,191
You said something
identical once...

920
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,951
that you wanted to
change the world.

921
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:41,388
Quite some time before you entered
your chambers, of course.

922
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,479
Defiant, principled...

923
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:49,719
desperate to secure your position
amongst the Establishment but...

924
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,559
always a little
too radical for them.

925
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,319
I never broke the rules.

926
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,988
You simply became powerful
enough to make new ones.

927
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,865
I always felt that you
already loved me...

928
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,381
when I gave you my hand.

929
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,911
That we were a good match
was never a doubt...

930
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:24,108
but I don't think I could
have married a gentleman...

931
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,106
without that light in his eye.

932
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:32,389
Without knowing, privately, that
my heart stopped a moment...

933
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,101
each time that he looked at me.

934
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,944
It is possible that even you...

935
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:51,111
cannot fight change, my darling.

936
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,586
Sometimes you cannot fight it
because you are a part of it.

937
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,624
Do you love her?

938
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,943
As though she were
created of you and me.

939
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,824
And that is why...

940
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,306
I simply will not
see her diminished.

941
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:27,743
The niece of the
Marquis of Winchester.

942
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:34,944
Mr. James Ashford is to marry the
niece of the Marquis of Winchester.

943
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,349
I'm reading it here.

944
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,669
Well, that will render your future
mother-in-law ecstatic, Dido.

945
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,351
Shh.

946
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,861
Don't you dare say a word.

947
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,719
I won't.

948
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,861
Why...

949
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,351
why do they always do that?

950
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,719
Who, Bette?

951
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,021
Men.

952
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,024
They just leave and
never come back.

953
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,345
I saw you with Mr. Davinier...

954
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,828
at the pleasure garden.

955
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,030
You said nothing.

956
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,621
I wanted you to tell me.

957
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,984
To trust me.

958
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,710
I should have.

959
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,065
You know...

960
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,822
if I had your choice...

961
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,427
I would choose the man I loved.

962
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,060
I simply hope he's worth it.

963
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,439
I am not in the habit of requiring
an explanation more than twice...

964
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,799
but on this occasion you
will have to forgive me.

965
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,439
There is little point
in repetition.

966
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,519
Then let me be clear I understand.

967
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,439
Your charge, your mulatto charge...

968
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,359
- That is enough!
- Is it not true, Your Ladyship?

969
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,679
whose unfortunate circumstances,

970
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,959
at birth, we chose to forgive...

971
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:27,759
has decided she no longer
wishes the match with my son...

972
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,381
a gentleman and an officer?

973
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,745
Why...

974
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,865
Miss Lindsay?

975
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:44,945
Do you feel I have any lesser need to ensure
my child's wellbeing and future than you?

976
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,599
Does she still have a tongue?

977
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,710
I have a tongue... madam.

978
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:57,226
Though yours explains well enough
why I may not marry your son.

979
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,319
You view my circumstances
as unfortunate...

980
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,999
though I cannot claim even a
portion of the misfortune...

981
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,985
to those whom I most
closely resemble.

982
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,839
My greatest misfortune would
be to marry into a family...

983
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,507
who would carry me
as their shame...

984
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,783
as I have been required
to carry my own mother.

985
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:25,345
Her apparent crime
to be born negro...

986
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,342
and mine to be the evidence.

987
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,199
Since I wish to deny her no more
than I wish to deny myself...

988
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,879
you will pardon me for
wanting a husband...

989
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,479
who feels 'forgiveness'
of my bloodline...

990
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,227
is both unnecessary
and without grace.

991
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,269
It will hang at Kenwood.

992
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,865
Will it?

993
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,462
Why should that surprise you?

994
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,263
Why should it not?

995
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,079
What are you reading?

996
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,639
A gentleman named Thomas Day.

997
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:41,387
He speaks of a slave who agreed
to marry an English lady.

998
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,062
A voice for people...

999
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,142
people like my mother...

1000
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,304
who do not have one.

1001
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,305
Do you find yourself
in such writing?

1002
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,825
I don't know that I
find myself anywhere.

1003
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,622
What do you want, Dido?

1004
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,985
What precisely are you looking for?

1005
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,479
I have enabled every
rule of convention...

1006
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:17,068
so that you would know
exactly where you belong...

1007
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,584
and yet little appears
enough for you.

1008
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,671
And what if there were
not a rule, Papa?

1009
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:30,425
What if the rule that allowed
you to take me did not exist?

1010
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,991
Would you have returned
me to the slums?

1011
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,982
You are courageous.

1012
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,839
When it comes to the matters you believe
in, society is inconsequential.

1013
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,350
You break every rule when it matters
enough, Papa. I am the evidence.

1014
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,785
This painting is the evidence.

1015
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,221
Look at them. For and Against
at each other's throats.

1016
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:17,502
How on earth did the damn
Quakers find their way in here?

1017
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,719
You are a brave man, negotiating these
quarters on the eve of your judgment.

1018
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,799
Finally you are to speak. If England
is destroyed, we shall blame you.

1019
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,399
religion not being the only
guardian of our morality.

1020
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,799
Of course not. There is
self-responsibility.

1021
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,119
And failing that, does
the law not have a duty?

1022
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:41,399
Does the Bench and Parliament not have
a duty to uphold and create the laws...

1023
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,639
that progress our
morality not retard it?

1024
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:48,959
If not to protect us from others
then to protect us from ourselves.

1025
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:54,079
Laws that allow us to diminish the
humanity of anybody are not laws.

1026
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,279
They are frameworks for crime.

1027
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:01,119
I do not care if you, as an individual,
are without character or conscience.

1028
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,359
But a land whose laws
sanction, not control...

1029
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,559
the barbarous among its citizens,

1030
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,679
that is a country
whose hope is lost.

1031
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,746
Why does it matter to you so much?

1032
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,463
M'lord... I have seen your notes!

1033
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,311
If they had wanted water,
they could have had it.

1034
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,150
Dido took them.

1035
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,039
M'lord! If you find
for the traders...

1036
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:04,199
you will be formalizing in law the
concept of insuring human cargo.

1037
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,990
That's correct.

1038
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,661
Drive.

1039
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,919
Then know that when you are gone, your
legacy will be to have left Miss Lindsay...

1040
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,159
in a world where she may be
worth more dead than alive.

1041
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,159
Miss Lindsay is not a slave.

1042
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,462
By the very grace of God.

1043
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,879
This is not about Miss Lindsay.

1044
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,705
Of course it is.

1045
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,022
It's about all of us.

1046
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:33,501
It's about everything.
Everything that's important.

1047
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,024
Mr. Davinier...

1048
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:47,230
the world is a devastating place.

1049
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,239
You must learn to protect
your emotions...

1050
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:55,225
if you wish to prevent
matters both of law...

1051
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,749
and love, from devastating you.

1052
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,984
Good to see you, John.

1053
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:08,665
Silence in the court! Silence!

1054
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,159
The Appeal Court of
the King's Bench

1055
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,940
case of Gregson versus Gilbert.

1056
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,309
I am here today...

1057
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:22,319
to rule on certain matters...

1058
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,305
referred to me from
the Lower Court...

1059
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,664
in the case of the slave ship <i>Zong</i>.

1060
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:31,119
How kind of you to
come, Mr. Vaughn.

1061
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,999
I have thought of nothing
else but showing

1062
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,359
you Aunt Mary's chrysanthemums.

1063
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,662
What a pleasure, Miss Murray.

1064
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,705
You too, Mama.

1065
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,391
Aunt Mary?

1066
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:57,359
Whether the enslaved cargo was
jettisoned in emergency...

1067
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:01,460
to save captain and crew
from certain death...

1068
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:06,999
when the extended journey threatened
shortage of drinking water.

1069
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,879
No. Never again.

1070
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,759
Then allow me to take the reins.

1071
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,879
Now let me be clear...

1072
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:18,346
the loss of water on a ship constitutes
a singularly dangerous affair.

1073
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,279
Insurrection of thirsty
and hostile slaves...

1074
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,719
<i>at its extreme, and
an impossible task...</i>

1075
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:33,390
<i>to share diminished water reserve
amongst all those living, at best.</i>

1076
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:40,079
Each implies a severe threat
to the lives of the seamen.

1077
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,959
And in such emergency
circumstances...

1078
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,743
our law is transparent
and unequivocal.

1079
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:55,359
The jettisoning of
enslaved cargo is legal!

1080
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:01,347
And it beholds the
insurers to pay losses.

1081
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:02,861
No!

1082
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,079
Silence in court!

1083
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,239
Gentlemen, silence in court!

1084
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,541
However...

1085
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,425
these were not the
circumstances of the <i>Zong</i>.

1086
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:18,589
Slaves were not jettisoned
because water supplies ran low.

1087
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:25,150
Indeed, evidence shows the
ship sailed past 8 ports...

1088
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,359
without pausing to
restore water supplies.

1089
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:35,079
My finding is that the slaves...

1090
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:40,319
were jettisoned, killed, because
the <i>Zong</i> ship's owners...

1091
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:45,262
chose a tight packing fashion
to transport their slaves.

1092
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:49,599
They knew the risk since this
fashion of transportation...

1093
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,588
is well-known to cause
disease in slaves.

1094
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,199
Disease that rendered
the <i>Zong</i> slaves

1095
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,199
impossible to sell.

1096
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:02,479
Silence in the court!
Gentlemen, silence!

1097
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,670
It is not legal...

1098
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,119
to discharge lives from
a ship into the waters...

1099
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:13,719
to facilitate insurance
compensation.

1100
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,705
Whether they be the
lives of horses...

1101
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:22,861
or human beings,
slaves or otherwise...

1102
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,504
it is not legal...

1103
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:30,989
neither is it right.

1104
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:40,039
It is clear that a fraud
has been committed...

1105
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:44,664
in claiming insurance on
slaves who were drowned...

1106
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,439
solely for financial gain.

1107
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:55,505
It is my opinion...

1108
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,865
that the state of slavery...

1109
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,711
is so odious a position...

1110
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:12,599
that nothing may support it.

1111
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,701
Let justice be done...

1112
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:28,031
though the heavens may fall.

1113
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:33,839
I find in favor of the insurers...

1114
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,919
Ah!

1115
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,239
and overturn the decision
of the Lower Court.

1116
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,224
All rise!

1117
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,941
You may not blame Mr. Davinier.

1118
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,946
My attendance today is
absolutely at my own volition.

1119
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,439
I'm fully aware, Dido.

1120
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:42,062
My Lord, I am inspired
by your decision today.

1121
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,942
We will not go backwards from here.

1122
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:49,306
History will judge whether
your optimism is warranted.

1123
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,422
You're a man of conviction.

1124
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,584
I'm trying to be.

1125
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:05,668
I've not changed my mind.
She is to marry a gentleman.

1126
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,510
And Mr. Davinier is
not a gentleman?

1127
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,239
He is, indeed.

1128
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,999
My affections are with him, Papa.

1129
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,719
And that is why he should have
an occupation befitting one.

1130
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:20,024
I wish for nothing if
not to be his wife.

1131
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:29,879
Mr. Davinier, I would like you to
attend my chambers in the morning.

1132
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,319
There are some matters
you can assist me with.

1133
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:35,559
- Your Lordship?
- And, if you think it's a good idea...

1134
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:39,865
I would like to facilitate your
entry into the Inns of Court.

1135
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:43,705
I think it is a very
good idea, my Lord.

1136
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:00,025
Can it be true?

1137
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:04,559
Of course. He sees what I see.
His words were as clear as...

1138
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,861
No.

1139
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:11,870
No, that your feelings
for me are so?

1140
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,710
That you would be my wife?

1141
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:20,945
Because I cannot conceive
of a life without you.

1142
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,184
I love you...

1143
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,627
for all that you are...

1144
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,070
and with all...

1145
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,944
all that I am.
