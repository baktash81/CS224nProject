1
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,529
Stop now.

2
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:18,695
Tell me where it is.

3
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:28,371
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

4
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:32,918
I don't know what
you are talking about.

5
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:35,962
Is it a secret you will die for?

6
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,424
- Please.
- As you wish.

7
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,217
Wait!

8
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,515
My God, forgive me.

9
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:50,977
In the sacristy...

10
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,648
...the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

11
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:56,983
Beneath the Rose.

12
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:02,530
Thank you.

13
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:54,165
Symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past.

14
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:59,045
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words...

15
00:03:59,212 --> 00:04:02,257
...but which words?

16
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,595
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind.

17
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:09,097
- Hatred, racism.
- Ku Klux Klan.

18
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:14,561
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would
disagree with you in Spain.

19
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:18,231
There, they are robes
worn by priests.

20
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:20,567
Now this symbol. Anyone?

21
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:21,943
Evil.

22
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:24,362
In English, please.

23
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,614
Devil's pitchfork.

24
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,991
Poor, poor Poseidon.

25
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:33,705
That is his trident. A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

26
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,081
Now this symbol.

27
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:38,585
- Madonna and child.
- Faith. Christianity.

28
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:42,547
No. No, it's the pagan god
Horus and his mother, Isis...

29
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:45,300
...centuries before
the birth of Christ.

30
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:49,220
Understanding our past
determines actively...

31
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:52,474
...our ability to understand
the present.

32
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:57,312
So how do we sift truth from belief?

33
00:04:57,562 --> 00:05:01,107
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally...

34
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:03,401
...and thereby define ourselves?

35
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:07,948
How do we penetrate years,
centuries, of historical distortion...

36
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:11,201
...to find original truth?

37
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:14,621
Tonight, this will be our quest.

38
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:18,124
I still think that his whole take on phi
was a little far-fetched.

39
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:24,506
I don't think so. I think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature.

40
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:26,967
Sure, I can do that.

41
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:30,136
My son is a student
of yours at Harvard.

42
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:32,555
- Michael Culp? He adores you.
- Oh, yeah.

43
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:34,808
He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.

44
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:38,979
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.

45
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:40,564
He told me. Thank you.

46
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,065
Mr. Langdon?

47
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,109
Hi.

48
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:45,652
Bonjour, professor.

49
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:51,866
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBI.

50
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:54,953
Will you take a look
at this photo, please?

51
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,998
My police chief, Capitaine Fache,
had hoped...

52
00:05:58,164 --> 00:06:01,793
...considering your expertise
and the markings on the body...

53
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,461
...you might assist us.

54
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,264
Will you excuse me a moment?

55
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:19,352
I was supposed to have
drinks with him.

56
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,770
Yes, we know.

57
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,232
We found your name
in his daily planner.

58
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:28,111
He never showed.
I waited for over an hour.

59
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:34,075
Why would someone do this to him?

60
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:37,370
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.

61
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:39,831
He was shot, yes.

62
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,709
But what you see
in the photograph...

63
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:45,503
...Monsieur Saunière did to himself.

64
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,886
Teacher, all four are dead.

65
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:56,848
The Sénéchaux and the
Grand Master himself.

66
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:00,101
Then I assume
you have the location.

67
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:03,396
Confirmed by all.

68
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:05,982
Independently.

69
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:11,071
I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.

70
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:18,745
The prospect of death
is strong motivation.

71
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:24,584
It is here.

72
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:27,254
In Paris, Teacher.

73
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:33,677
It hides beneath the Rose
in Saint-Sulpice.

74
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:36,930
You will go forth, Silas.

75
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:53,340
I chastise my body.

76
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:33,255
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.

77
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:42,889
Okay.

78
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,652
- Mr. Langdon.
- Yes.

79
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:58,071
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

80
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,532
You like our pyramid?

81
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:01,783
It's magnificent.

82
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:04,536
A scar on the face of Paris.

83
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:07,497
After me, please.

84
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:17,299
It's the pairing
of those two pyramids.

85
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:19,092
It's unique.

86
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:21,428
The two are geometric echoes.

87
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:22,637
Fascinating.

88
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:28,894
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

89
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,483
How well did you know the curator?

90
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,904
Not at all. We met only once.

91
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,406
We were on a...

92
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:43,783
On a panel together.

93
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,578
Something is funny?

94
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:48,455
We didn't agree on much.

95
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:52,208
Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.

96
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:02,636
Could we take the stairs?

97
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:20,487
So Saunière requested
tonight's meeting.

98
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:21,821
Yes.

99
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:23,490
How? Did he call you?

100
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:28,411
E- mail. He heard I was in Paris.

101
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,289
Had something to discuss.

102
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,582
What?

103
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:40,882
You seem uncomfortable.

104
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:59,651
- Are any of those real?
- Of course not.

105
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:03,572
So you know something
of security procedures.

106
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:07,993
Well, I know video surveillance in
a museum this size is cost-prohibitive.

107
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,704
Most now rely on containment.

108
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,082
Yes, forget about
keeping the criminals out.

109
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:16,459
Now we keep them in.

110
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:26,094
The Grand Gallery.
This is where you found the body.

111
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:28,054
How would you know that?

112
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:34,019
I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.

113
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:44,738
Dear God.

114
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:50,827
Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

115
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:53,914
Many call Opus Dei
a brainwashing cult.

116
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,250
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

117
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:00,170
- We are a simple Catholic church.
- Simple?

118
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:03,089
With a brand-new $47-million
headquarters in Manhattan.

119
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:06,384
Our followers are generous,
should we apologize for that?

120
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,887
Perhaps a less defensive tack,
Your Eminence.

121
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,222
The press continue
to be harsh with us.

122
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:17,187
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

123
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:19,439
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

124
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:22,275
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

125
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:26,780
Does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity, tithing...

126
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:30,116
...and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?

127
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,788
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

128
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:37,916
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetically...

129
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,710
...in the cloisters
of our residential halls.

130
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:44,214
But we are all united in God's work
around the world.

131
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:48,218
Surely that is an admirable way
to lead one's life.

132
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:51,304
Why are some media referring
to Opus Dei as "God's mafia"?

133
00:13:51,471 --> 00:13:55,225
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

134
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,312
And because the war finally
draws to a close.

135
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:03,525
- Bishop, we need to stay on message.
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.

136
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:04,943
Aringarosa.

137
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:09,781
Silas has succeeded.
The legend is true.

138
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:11,992
It hides beneath the Rose.

139
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,328
My part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled.

140
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,915
I meet the council in an hour.

141
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:22,961
I will have your money tonight,
Teacher.

142
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:26,006
The Vitruvian Man.

143
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:29,426
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous sketches.

144
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:31,553
And the star on his skin?

145
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,013
A pentacle.

146
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,848
And its meaning?

147
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:36,433
The pentacle is ancient.

148
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,522
Symbols carry different meanings
in different settings.

149
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:45,317
This symbol, professor.
This setting.

150
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:47,694
The pentacle is
a pagan religious icon.

151
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:49,946
Devil worship.

152
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:54,910
No. No, no, no.
The pentacle before that.

153
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:57,579
This is a symbol for Venus.

154
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:00,582
It represents the female half
of all things.

155
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:03,960
It's a concept called "the divine
goddess" by religious historians.

156
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:08,715
You are telling me that
Saunière's last act on earth...

157
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:13,345
...was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?

158
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:17,974
Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.

159
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,479
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol...

160
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:25,398
...and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

161
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:26,983
- Is that so?
- Yes.

162
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,401
Then...

163
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:31,571
...what do you make of this?

164
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:36,243
"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint."

165
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:39,621
It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.

166
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:43,500
What would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message?

167
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,589
Well, I suppose
I'd try to identify my killer.

168
00:15:50,257 --> 00:15:53,760
Precisely.

169
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:55,053
So, professor...

170
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,598
Officer Neveu.

171
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,267
Please, pardon the interruption.

172
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:01,476
This is not the time.

173
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:03,770
I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

174
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:05,772
...and I've deciphered the code.

175
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:07,691
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

176
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:10,277
That's the code Saunière
left on the floor.

177
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,737
Headquarters sent me
to explain, captain.

178
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:14,197
It is the Fibonacci sequence.

179
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:15,865
The numbers are out of order.

180
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:18,868
But before that, I have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.

181
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:20,495
Right?

182
00:16:20,662 --> 00:16:21,955
Pardon me?

183
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,377
I'm Sophie Neveu,
French police, Cryptology.

184
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:29,588
Your embassy called Division.

185
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:38,638
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

186
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:42,976
This is the number of your
embassy's messaging service.

187
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,978
Well, thank you.

188
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:54,446
Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

189
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:58,074
Miss Neveu? This...

190
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:59,826
No. That's the right number.

191
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:02,495
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

192
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:03,705
But I'm getting...

193
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:06,791
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.

194
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,845
Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.

195
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:22,307
You must follow my directions
very closely and, above all...

196
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,809
...reveal nothing to Captain Fache.

197
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,062
You are in grave danger.

198
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,910
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

199
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,787
Good evening, Sister.

200
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:48,583
I need you to show someone
our church tonight.

201
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,418
Of course, Father.

202
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:52,671
But so late?

203
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,923
Wouldn't tomorrow...?

204
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,844
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

205
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:03,014
It would be my pleasure.

206
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:30,000
There's been an accident. A friend.

207
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,210
I have to fly home in the morning.

208
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,670
I see.

209
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:37,924
Is there a restroom I could use? I just
wanna splash some water on my face.

210
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:39,259
Yes.

211
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,723
She said it is meaningless.

212
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:46,808
Mathematical joke.

213
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:49,644
Is it meaningless?

214
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:54,357
I'll take another look
when I come back.

215
00:18:58,236 --> 00:19:00,697
I'm sorry. Of course.

216
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,717
Do you have a message
from Saunière?

217
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:23,053
What are you talking about?

218
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:25,639
Crazy old man.

219
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:28,433
You have me confused with
someone else.

220
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,393
I was asked to come here
and consult.

221
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,479
No, you are
sous surveillance cachée.

222
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:34,272
Yes, and...

223
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,066
What?

224
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:40,153
Bring the suspect to the crime scene
and hope he incriminates himself.

225
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,404
Suspect?

226
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:43,657
Check your jacket pocket.

227
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:46,243
Just look.

228
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,998
GPS tracking dot.

229
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:55,252
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

230
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:59,005
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket...

231
00:20:00,423 --> 00:20:02,509
...in case you tried to run.

232
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,721
We have you on a little leash,
professor.

233
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,275
Why would I try to run?
I didn't do anything.

234
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:22,529
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text...

235
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:25,574
...Fache wiped clean
before you arrived?

236
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:35,584
He brought you here to force a
confession, Professor Langdon.

237
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:41,172
He's still in there?
What's he doing?

238
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:49,306
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

239
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,016
He is sure you're guilty.

240
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:57,272
When did Saunière contact you?

241
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,523
- Today?
- Yes, yes.

242
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,775
What time? What time?

243
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:02,819
At 3. Around 3. Three.

244
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:05,739
The gallery alarm was triggered at 8.
You were...

245
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:07,616
- I was giving a lecture.
- At 9.

246
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:12,579
You had the privacy light on
in your hotel room until 8:30, right?

247
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:16,499
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

248
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,878
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

249
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,423
And by then whatever Saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

250
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,717
Stop it! Just stop!

251
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:27,844
Who are you?

252
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:30,388
What are you talking about?
Tell you what?

253
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:33,934
Maybe who really killed him.

254
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,151
The Fibonacci sequence.

255
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:45,528
I believe Saunière wrote it...

256
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:48,615
...so his investigation would
include cryptographers.

257
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:54,454
That's quite a leap, isn't it?

258
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:56,081
No.

259
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:59,000
And the letters.

260
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,293
"P.S."

261
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,128
P.S., postscript.

262
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:10,053
"Princess Sophie."
Yeah. Silly, I know.

263
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,139
But I was only a girl
when I lived with him.

264
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:21,231
Jacques Saunière
was my grandfather.

265
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:29,739
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

266
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:33,743
If you help me understand why...

267
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,622
...I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

268
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:41,626
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

269
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:43,670
No.

270
00:22:44,504 --> 00:22:48,341
If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

271
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:01,688
What exactly do you propose?

272
00:23:11,197 --> 00:23:14,034
Saunière was reading his book.

273
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:16,369
"Blood trail."

274
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:20,123
Excuse me, captain.

275
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,377
Crypto called.
They identified the code.

276
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:26,379
Neveu told us already.

277
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:30,383
I should have fired her on the spot,
barging in like that.

278
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,510
Yes.

279
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,221
Except they didn't send Neveu.

280
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:38,808
What?

281
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:42,395
Captain, look at this.

282
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:45,357
He jumped!

283
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:46,816
Shit.

284
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,239
He's moving again. And fast.

285
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:54,616
He must be in a car.

286
00:23:56,034 --> 00:24:00,247
He's going south
on Pont du Carrousel.

287
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:10,257
Bastard.

288
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,866
That cop will check
the whole lower floor.

289
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:42,789
I will only take a moment.

290
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,583
Of course.

291
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,468
He is much older than I remember.

292
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:10,609
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

293
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:23,663
He phoned my office today.
Several times.

294
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:27,876
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

295
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:31,755
I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

296
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:37,344
It seems when
he couldn't speak to me...

297
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:40,472
...he reached out to you.

298
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,356
Whatever he needed
so badly to say...

299
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:53,235
...he found neither of us in time.

300
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:21,888
- Wait a minute.
- Professor?

301
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,641
Come on.

302
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,560
It can't be that easy.

303
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,772
This is wrong.
Yeah. See? This is wrong.

304
00:26:32,274 --> 00:26:35,944
The Fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they're in order.

305
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:37,612
These are scrambled.

306
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:41,575
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

307
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:43,618
Would you hold this, please?

308
00:26:45,745 --> 00:26:47,914
This phrase is meaningless.

309
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:54,546
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

310
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:55,880
An anagram.

311
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:09,394
You have eidetic memory?

312
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:13,273
Not quite. But I can pretty much
remember what I see.

313
00:27:34,628 --> 00:27:36,630
Anagram is right.

314
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:40,592
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint"
becomes:

315
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,428
"Leonardo da Vinci.
The Mona Lisa."

316
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,307
Professor, the Mona Lisa
is right over here.

317
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:58,526
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

318
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,487
Smart to hit the truck.

319
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:04,407
What, you admire him now?

320
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:08,119
We're stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?

321
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,039
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

322
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:14,459
Her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies.

323
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:18,255
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

324
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:19,506
Why?

325
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:23,009
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

326
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:26,304
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

327
00:28:27,097 --> 00:28:28,598
The sacred feminine.

328
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:31,351
Why do you say that?

329
00:28:31,518 --> 00:28:35,814
Something Saunière said
the first time we came here.

330
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,360
There. Blood.

331
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:53,748
Hey.

332
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:58,128
"So dark the con of man."

333
00:28:58,878 --> 00:29:02,215
No. It doesn't say that.

334
00:29:02,382 --> 00:29:04,676
Is it another anagram?
Can you break it?

335
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:12,100
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

336
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:16,646
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

337
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:20,901
Demons. Omens. Codes.
Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

338
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:22,152
Madonna of the Rocks.

339
00:29:22,944 --> 00:29:24,029
Da Vinci.

340
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:36,207
Careful. Careful.

341
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,510
This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.

342
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:07,405
Stay where you are!

343
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,742
Let go of the painting...

344
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,702
...and put it on the ground.

345
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:18,875
No. You put your gun down.

346
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:21,169
Now!

347
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:22,963
Or else I will destroy the painting.

348
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,300
Hurry up!

349
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:29,302
Slide your gun to me.

350
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:33,640
Be careful.

351
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:35,767
I never really liked this painting.

352
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,998
Run.

353
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:29,779
It was Saunière's.

354
00:31:30,363 --> 00:31:33,366
I remember finding it once
when I was a girl.

355
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,453
He'd promised
he'd give it to me one day.

356
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:39,456
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

357
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:41,041
"So dark the con of man"?

358
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:42,876
No. Have you?

359
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:46,504
When you were a child, were you
aware of any secret gatherings?

360
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,050
Anything ritualistic in nature?

361
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:53,511
Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?

362
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,140
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

363
00:31:57,307 --> 00:32:00,268
The what? Why are you
asking these things?

364
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:02,938
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

365
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:07,609
One of the world's oldest and most
secret societies, with leaders like...

366
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:10,320
...Sir Isaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

367
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,572
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

368
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:15,283
They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to...

369
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,661
...as "the dark con of man."

370
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:19,704
But what secret?

371
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:25,543
The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God's power on earth.

372
00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:36,346
I can't do this by myself.

373
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:39,808
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.

374
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:41,101
Please.

375
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:42,769
Even if we could get out of this...

376
00:32:42,936 --> 00:32:44,437
Okay.

377
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:24,144
No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

378
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:33,111
Well, that was...

379
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,125
We won't last long in this car.

380
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:50,170
Fache doesn't like to be eluded,
even on a good day.

381
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:52,172
We need to get out of sight.

382
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:12,859
Christ, give me strength.

383
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:29,417
You are a ghost.

384
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:34,047
Christ, give me strength.

385
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:11,603
Stealing in a house of God!

386
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,953
You are an angel.

387
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,666
Christ, give me strength.

388
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:00,318
You have powerful friends.

389
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:04,197
Bishop Aringarosa
has been kind to me.

390
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:08,785
I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

391
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:12,122
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.

392
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:14,291
The light is not ideal.

393
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:19,296
Tell me, Sister, please,
of the Rose Line.

394
00:37:19,713 --> 00:37:24,884
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

395
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:30,015
Set into the streets of Paris,
135 brass markers...

396
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,726
...mark the world's
first prime meridian...

397
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:35,395
...which passed through
this very church.

398
00:37:35,562 --> 00:37:37,397
It hides beneath the Rose.

399
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:38,815
I'm sorry?

400
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:41,318
Sister.

401
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:47,324
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.

402
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:51,661
I insist.

403
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:58,835
May the peace of the Lord
be with you.

404
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,130
And with you.

405
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:27,864
Gray Smart Car. Black roof.

406
00:38:28,031 --> 00:38:31,618
Corner of Denain Boulevard
at the train station.

407
00:38:31,785 --> 00:38:33,065
How could you let them get away?

408
00:38:33,203 --> 00:38:36,164
Why not just shoot the damn painting?
Imbecile!

409
00:38:36,331 --> 00:38:39,209
You should put his cigar
out in your hand!

410
00:38:39,376 --> 00:38:40,752
Get out of here!

411
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:48,510
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

412
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,932
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.

413
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,642
A decoy, I'm sure.

414
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:58,270
All the same,
send an officer to the station.

415
00:38:58,478 --> 00:39:01,147
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

416
00:39:01,314 --> 00:39:04,067
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

417
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:08,280
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

418
00:39:08,488 --> 00:39:11,408
Robert Langdon is guilty.

419
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,127
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

420
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:25,171
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

421
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:45,191
Your police don't patrol this park.

422
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:40,538
Stay here.

423
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:43,458
Police.

424
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,211
What do you want?

425
00:41:01,017 --> 00:41:03,103
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

426
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:07,440
Go and get something to eat.

427
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:29,629
Did it occur to you
that could be dangerous?

428
00:41:29,796 --> 00:41:33,049
No. And now we have
a place to think.

429
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:35,260
Any ideas, professor?

430
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:40,015
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

431
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:44,519
"What's the next step?"

432
00:41:44,686 --> 00:41:46,354
With him, it's always:

433
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:49,649
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

434
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:51,735
Puzzles.

435
00:41:51,902 --> 00:41:53,320
Codes.

436
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:55,405
A treasure hunt.

437
00:41:59,826 --> 00:42:01,119
To find his killer.

438
00:42:05,332 --> 00:42:08,793
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

439
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,003
I hope not.

440
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:15,008
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

441
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:18,595
It all started over a thousand
years ago when a French king...

442
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:21,222
...conquered the holy city
of Jerusalem.

443
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:24,726
This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history...

444
00:42:24,893 --> 00:42:28,438
...was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood...

445
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:30,023
...the Priory of Sion...

446
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,277
...and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.

447
00:42:34,694 --> 00:42:37,781
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

448
00:42:37,948 --> 00:42:41,993
That was a cover to hide their
true goal, according to this myth.

449
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:45,664
Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact...

450
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,707
...lost since the time of Christ.

451
00:42:47,874 --> 00:42:52,045
An artifact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.

452
00:42:52,212 --> 00:42:54,839
Did they find it,
this buried treasure?

453
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,300
Put it this way:

454
00:42:57,467 --> 00:43:00,387
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

455
00:43:00,553 --> 00:43:04,057
They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.

456
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:06,142
Whether they blackmailed
the papacy...

457
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:08,770
...or the Church bought their silence,
no one knows.

458
00:43:08,937 --> 00:43:13,358
But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights...

459
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:17,195
...these Knights Templar,
of limitless power.

460
00:43:17,821 --> 00:43:21,199
By the 1300s, the Templars
had grown too powerful.

461
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:22,784
Too threatening.

462
00:43:23,118 --> 00:43:25,245
So the Vatican
issued secret orders...

463
00:43:25,412 --> 00:43:28,373
...to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.

464
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:33,128
The Pope had declared the
Knights Templar Satan worshipers...

465
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:37,882
...and said God had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics.

466
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:40,510
The plan went off like clockwork.

467
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:43,680
The Templars
were all but exterminated.

468
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:48,101
The date was October 13th, 1307.
A Friday.

469
00:43:48,268 --> 00:43:50,228
Friday the 13th.

470
00:43:50,437 --> 00:43:53,481
The Pope sent troops
to claim the Priory's treasure...

471
00:43:53,648 --> 00:43:55,275
...but they found nothing.

472
00:43:55,442 --> 00:43:58,737
The few surviving
Knights of the Priory had vanished...

473
00:43:58,904 --> 00:44:01,781
...and the search for their
sacred artifact began again.

474
00:44:01,948 --> 00:44:06,119
What artifact? I've never
heard about any of this.

475
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:07,829
Yes, you have.

476
00:44:08,163 --> 00:44:10,582
Almost everyone on earth has.

477
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:14,085
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

478
00:44:19,674 --> 00:44:23,845
Please, Saunière thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

479
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,139
Maybe more than that.

480
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:30,268
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

481
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:35,690
This metal here underneath is much
newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.

482
00:44:35,857 --> 00:44:37,776
"Haxo 24."

483
00:44:39,694 --> 00:44:43,114
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

484
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:46,993
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

485
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:49,829
He left us, professor.

486
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:55,585
And vingt-quatre Haxo,
it's not an ID stamp.

487
00:44:56,211 --> 00:44:58,129
It's a street address.

488
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:04,552
This is Jacques Saunière.

489
00:45:04,928 --> 00:45:07,764
Please leave a message
after the tone.

490
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:10,850
Please, Monsieur Saunière,
pick up the phone.

491
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:12,602
This is Sandrine Bieil.

492
00:45:12,852 --> 00:45:15,105
I have called the list.

493
00:45:15,522 --> 00:45:17,440
I fear the other guardians are dead.

494
00:45:18,024 --> 00:45:19,943
The lie has been told.

495
00:45:20,277 --> 00:45:22,195
The floor panel has been broken.

496
00:45:22,404 --> 00:45:25,865
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

497
00:45:26,032 --> 00:45:28,285
Job 38, verse 11.

498
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:31,621
Do you know it, Sister?

499
00:45:33,373 --> 00:45:35,166
Job 38:11.

500
00:45:36,793 --> 00:45:39,045
Hitherto shalt thou come...

501
00:45:39,879 --> 00:45:41,631
...but no further.

502
00:45:41,798 --> 00:45:43,216
"But no further."

503
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,222
Do you mock me?

504
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:54,436
Where is the keystone?

505
00:45:55,228 --> 00:45:57,022
I do not know.

506
00:45:58,023 --> 00:45:59,190
No.

507
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:04,237
You are a sister of the Church...

508
00:46:06,156 --> 00:46:09,576
...and yet you serve them:
The Priory.

509
00:46:09,743 --> 00:46:13,788
Jesus had but one true message.
That...

510
00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:36,686
Come, you saints of God.

511
00:46:37,604 --> 00:46:40,273
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

512
00:46:40,982 --> 00:46:43,777
To receive her soul.

513
00:46:44,194 --> 00:46:48,782
And bring her to the sight
of the Almighty.

514
00:46:52,702 --> 00:46:57,332
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

515
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,240
Welcome, bishop.

516
00:47:33,577 --> 00:47:34,995
May Christ be with you.

517
00:47:35,161 --> 00:47:36,955
And also with you.

518
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:39,791
It's been too long, Manuel.

519
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:43,336
I saw your press conference.

520
00:47:43,503 --> 00:47:44,963
Very priestly.

521
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,506
Vultures.

522
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:50,010
But you need a good cover
to fly into Italy these days.

523
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:55,056
So how are things in Rome?

524
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:57,726
We serve at his pleasure.

525
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:02,188
Today is today.

526
00:48:02,689 --> 00:48:05,275
But there are many tomorrows.

527
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:09,863
Vatican cellars.

528
00:48:10,447 --> 00:48:12,657
1976.

529
00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:16,828
Seventy-six, a year of independence.
How fitting.

530
00:48:19,205 --> 00:48:21,625
I thought you'd like it.

531
00:48:22,876 --> 00:48:24,336
I'll fetch the others.

532
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,691
Welcome, bishop.

533
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:52,280
This council is convened.

534
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:04,251
Our words shall never
pass these walls.

535
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:12,842
What business, say you?

536
00:49:14,803 --> 00:49:16,888
As you know, my request for funds...

537
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:21,351
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

538
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:24,729
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, bishop?

539
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:28,149
The endeavor is complex.
Freedom has a high cost.

540
00:49:28,358 --> 00:49:30,360
And, of course, you will deliver us.

541
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:33,071
How fortunate we are.

542
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:37,909
I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

543
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:39,369
How humble.

544
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:42,080
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

545
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:44,374
Were we to grant your request...

546
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:47,961
...when would
this mission commence?

547
00:49:48,128 --> 00:49:49,963
- Actually, tonight.
- What?

548
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,090
- It has begun.
- We have not agreed.

549
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:53,800
How dare you presume to...

550
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:55,760
I do not presume, I act!

551
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:58,138
The Vatican's unwillingness
to support us...

552
00:49:58,305 --> 00:49:59,931
...is both impious and cowardly.

553
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:04,269
Blood is being spilled because true
Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

554
00:50:04,853 --> 00:50:08,148
This council has forgotten
its very purpose.

555
00:50:10,817 --> 00:50:11,985
Tonight...

556
00:50:12,986 --> 00:50:15,447
...the Grail will be destroyed.

557
00:50:15,614 --> 00:50:19,576
The Priory's few remaining members
will be silenced.

558
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,755
I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."

559
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:35,342
He knows a great deal
about this council.

560
00:50:35,926 --> 00:50:38,261
And about the Priory.

561
00:50:53,693 --> 00:50:56,238
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

562
00:50:56,404 --> 00:50:58,657
...getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.

563
00:51:13,296 --> 00:51:15,257
Because of your expertise?

564
00:51:16,383 --> 00:51:17,884
- I'm sorry?
- About the Priory.

565
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:20,553
Do you think that's why
Saunière sought you out?

566
00:51:21,096 --> 00:51:24,224
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

567
00:51:24,391 --> 00:51:28,520
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

568
00:51:29,145 --> 00:51:32,607
Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

569
00:51:32,774 --> 00:51:34,150
What was it?

570
00:51:47,372 --> 00:51:49,165
How may I help you?

571
00:51:55,046 --> 00:51:57,340
The door to the right, please.

572
00:52:08,268 --> 00:52:10,854
That was quite a performance.

573
00:52:12,606 --> 00:52:15,775
The little shit should know better
than to play politics with me.

574
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:23,366
I know I got in front of you,
old friend.

575
00:52:25,327 --> 00:52:27,287
I did what I thought was best.

576
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,463
So...

577
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:37,714
...now what?

578
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:42,469
Now we wait for the Teacher's call.

579
00:52:54,856 --> 00:52:57,525
Good evening. I am André Vernet,
the night manager.

580
00:52:59,027 --> 00:53:02,322
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

581
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:04,491
Yes.

582
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:06,701
Understood.

583
00:53:07,452 --> 00:53:09,829
Keys are often passed on
and first-time users...

584
00:53:09,996 --> 00:53:12,707
...are sometimes
uncertain of protocol.

585
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:17,545
Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.

586
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,466
Often willed through generations.

587
00:53:24,344 --> 00:53:26,846
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

588
00:53:28,932 --> 00:53:31,977
The shortest safety-deposit-box
lease is 50 years.

589
00:53:32,936 --> 00:53:35,021
And what's your longest account?

590
00:53:35,188 --> 00:53:36,815
Quite a bit longer.

591
00:53:37,232 --> 00:53:39,901
Technologies change,
keys are updated.

592
00:53:40,193 --> 00:53:44,197
But our accounts date back
to the beginning of banking itself.

593
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,787
Once the computer
confirms your key...

594
00:53:50,954 --> 00:53:54,374
...enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

595
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:57,252
The room is yours,
as long as you like.

596
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,552
What if I lost track
of my account number?

597
00:54:06,094 --> 00:54:07,596
How might I recover it?

598
00:54:09,848 --> 00:54:12,434
I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 10-digit number...

599
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:14,686
...known only to the account bearer.

600
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:16,938
I hope you manage to remember it.

601
00:54:17,564 --> 00:54:20,233
A single wrong entry
disables the system.

602
00:54:27,115 --> 00:54:28,199
- Ten.
- Ten.

603
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,911
Your grandfather's
Fibonacci sequence.

604
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,458
Scrambled, unscrambled?

605
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,710
Unscrambled.

606
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:41,046
It's your key.

607
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,471
Funny, I don't even like history.

608
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:57,103
I've never seen much good come
from looking to the past.

609
00:55:04,569 --> 00:55:06,112
Moment of truth.

610
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:53,285
My God. I don't believe this.

611
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,869
A rose.

612
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:01,543
The rose was a symbol
for the Holy Grail.

613
00:56:04,379 --> 00:56:06,006
Forgive the intrusion.

614
00:56:06,172 --> 00:56:09,759
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than I anticipated.

615
00:56:10,677 --> 00:56:12,512
You must follow me, please.

616
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:14,055
For your own safety.

617
00:56:14,389 --> 00:56:16,016
You knew they were coming?

618
00:56:16,182 --> 00:56:18,977
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

619
00:56:19,144 --> 00:56:22,022
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

620
00:56:22,188 --> 00:56:24,482
It includes a safe-passage clause.

621
00:56:24,649 --> 00:56:25,859
Safe passage?

622
00:56:26,693 --> 00:56:30,697
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

623
00:56:33,074 --> 00:56:34,367
In there?

624
00:56:49,549 --> 00:56:51,343
Hey, is there a problem?

625
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:54,179
Good evening, sir. Police.

626
00:56:54,596 --> 00:56:58,725
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

627
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:00,227
- English?
- Yes.

628
00:57:01,603 --> 00:57:04,272
We are looking for two criminals.

629
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,360
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

630
00:57:10,111 --> 00:57:12,489
Would you mind opening the hold?

631
00:57:12,989 --> 00:57:16,576
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?

632
00:57:16,743 --> 00:57:18,620
You don't have keys
to your own truck?

633
00:57:18,787 --> 00:57:21,539
It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

634
00:57:21,706 --> 00:57:23,792
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

635
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:31,758
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

636
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:33,301
What?

637
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,264
This piece of shit.

638
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,266
Forty euros in Barbès.

639
00:57:39,432 --> 00:57:40,600
Yours for 35.

640
00:57:41,142 --> 00:57:42,185
No, no, no.

641
00:57:42,352 --> 00:57:44,145
- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.

642
00:57:44,312 --> 00:57:45,605
Come on, 30, eh?

643
00:57:45,772 --> 00:57:47,107
I said, no!

644
00:57:47,649 --> 00:57:48,817
Move along!

645
00:58:02,163 --> 00:58:03,331
Now we wait.

646
00:58:03,498 --> 00:58:06,126
The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

647
00:58:06,293 --> 00:58:09,713
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

648
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:14,301
Yes, I have. And I have given him
an angel to do his will.

649
00:58:14,634 --> 00:58:18,054
For surely there is no better
soldier for God than my Silas.

650
00:58:18,972 --> 00:58:22,684
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

651
00:58:36,907 --> 00:58:39,492
...to do penance
and to amend my life.

652
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:40,952
Amen.

653
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:03,558
I chastise my body.

654
00:59:19,574 --> 00:59:21,201
The Holy Grail.

655
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:26,873
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.

656
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,375
It's nonsense.

657
00:59:29,292 --> 00:59:31,253
You don't believe in God.

658
00:59:32,087 --> 00:59:33,255
No.

659
00:59:34,047 --> 00:59:39,552
I don't believe in some magic
from the sky.

660
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:41,221
Just people.

661
00:59:41,888 --> 00:59:44,474
Sometimes that they can be kind.

662
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,601
And that's enough?

663
00:59:46,935 --> 00:59:50,313
Well, I think it has to be.
I think it's all we have.

664
00:59:52,899 --> 00:59:55,485
Are you a God-fearing man,
professor?

665
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:58,405
I was raised a Catholic.

666
00:59:59,072 --> 01:00:01,658
Well, that's not really an answer.

667
01:00:03,493 --> 01:00:05,453
Professor, are you okay?

668
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,248
Go ahead, open it.

669
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:10,083
Go on.

670
01:00:17,132 --> 01:00:18,508
A cryptex.

671
01:00:19,801 --> 01:00:22,345
They are used to keep secrets.

672
01:00:23,096 --> 01:00:25,265
It's da Vinci's design.

673
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:29,185
You write the information
on a papyrus scroll...

674
01:00:29,352 --> 01:00:34,482
...which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

675
01:00:34,649 --> 01:00:37,903
If you force it open, the vial breaks...

676
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:40,780
...vinegar dissolves papyrus...

677
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:45,118
...and your secret is lost forever.

678
01:00:45,452 --> 01:00:47,537
The only way
to access the information...

679
01:00:47,704 --> 01:00:50,123
...is to spell out the password...

680
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:53,793
...with these five dials,
each with 26 letters.

681
01:00:54,628 --> 01:00:58,381
That's 12 million possibilities.

682
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:02,636
I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.

683
01:01:03,845 --> 01:01:06,139
Saunière made one for me once.

684
01:01:14,064 --> 01:01:17,317
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

685
01:01:19,819 --> 01:01:22,155
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

686
01:01:25,992 --> 01:01:27,202
Come on.

687
01:01:27,452 --> 01:01:28,954
Please, you're not all right.

688
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,084
May I try something?

689
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:36,336
I don't know why it works.

690
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,590
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

691
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,175
You think?

692
01:01:42,926 --> 01:01:44,052
Yes.

693
01:01:56,022 --> 01:01:57,899
Feeling better, Sophie?

694
01:02:09,703 --> 01:02:14,541
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

695
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,876
I was 4.

696
01:02:18,712 --> 01:02:20,088
I'm sorry.

697
01:02:21,423 --> 01:02:23,383
It was many years ago.

698
01:02:39,024 --> 01:02:40,317
Better?

699
01:02:42,986 --> 01:02:44,029
Yeah.

700
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:45,989
Okay.

701
01:03:12,098 --> 01:03:14,726
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box...

702
01:03:14,893 --> 01:03:17,437
...and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

703
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,940
I don't know what
you're talking about.

704
01:03:21,107 --> 01:03:23,109
All right! Okay!

705
01:03:23,777 --> 01:03:24,819
Right now!

706
01:03:35,247 --> 01:03:36,289
Step back!

707
01:03:40,168 --> 01:03:42,629
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

708
01:03:45,799 --> 01:03:47,342
Turn around.

709
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:49,970
Turn around!

710
01:03:50,262 --> 01:03:51,972
You too, mademoiselle.

711
01:04:14,536 --> 01:04:16,079
Sophie!

712
01:04:16,496 --> 01:04:17,914
Get in the truck!

713
01:04:18,707 --> 01:04:20,083
I'll drive! Hurry!

714
01:04:58,204 --> 01:05:01,458
- Better?
- Always, if I got too nervous...

715
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:04,753
...I had to put my head out
of the window not to be sick.

716
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:08,131
Saunière used to say
I was like a dog.

717
01:05:09,382 --> 01:05:13,720
A cute dog. You know, a little dog.

718
01:05:22,812 --> 01:05:26,358
What happened between you
and your grandfather, Sophie?

719
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:32,739
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

720
01:05:32,906 --> 01:05:34,532
I need to know.

721
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:38,203
You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.

722
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:40,372
You call him by his last name.

723
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:43,208
You say you hate history.

724
01:05:43,375 --> 01:05:45,669
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

725
01:05:45,835 --> 01:05:47,879
So now you're a psychologist too?

726
01:05:48,213 --> 01:05:52,425
What if Saunière had started
to groom you for the Priory?

727
01:05:52,592 --> 01:05:54,386
What do you mean, groom me?

728
01:05:54,552 --> 01:05:57,889
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.

729
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,936
Say Saunière was hoping one day
you would join him in the Priory.

730
01:06:03,103 --> 01:06:05,230
Still, years later,
when he imagines...

731
01:06:06,022 --> 01:06:08,858
...the Grail is in danger,
he reaches out to you.

732
01:06:09,025 --> 01:06:13,113
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?

733
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,449
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

734
01:06:16,616 --> 01:06:18,743
- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?

735
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:27,502
I'm out of my field here.

736
01:06:29,921 --> 01:06:34,634
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

737
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:37,971
An Englishman,
lives here in France.

738
01:06:38,263 --> 01:06:39,890
Do you trust this man?

739
01:06:40,974 --> 01:06:42,559
I hope you can.

740
01:06:48,648 --> 01:06:50,483
Vernet, André.

741
01:06:52,152 --> 01:06:54,988
It seems you're not a driver at all.

742
01:06:56,823 --> 01:07:01,620
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

743
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:09,044
Aiding and abetting
two murder suspects.

744
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:11,588
That carries jail time.

745
01:07:12,172 --> 01:07:13,965
Speak to my lawyer.

746
01:07:15,634 --> 01:07:21,598
All this confusion, violence,
vanishing property...

747
01:07:22,807 --> 01:07:29,022
It might get around that your bank is
less than ideal, don't you think?

748
01:07:31,107 --> 01:07:33,818
You think you're in pain now,
André Vernet?

749
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:38,198
My cause is worth your life.
Understand?

750
01:07:42,535 --> 01:07:44,162
What do you want?

751
01:07:44,454 --> 01:07:49,709
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

752
01:07:57,634 --> 01:08:00,387
Please wait.
I'll see if he's available.

753
01:08:00,553 --> 01:08:02,222
It's on the wrong side.

754
01:08:02,389 --> 01:08:04,891
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

755
01:08:05,058 --> 01:08:08,228
Robert! Do I owe you money?

756
01:08:09,062 --> 01:08:11,898
Leigh, my friend...

757
01:08:12,148 --> 01:08:15,485
...care to open up
for an old colleague?

758
01:08:15,652 --> 01:08:17,404
- Of course.
- Thank you.

759
01:08:17,696 --> 01:08:20,115
But first, a test of honor.

760
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:22,409
Three questions.

761
01:08:25,704 --> 01:08:26,913
Fire away.

762
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,582
Your first:

763
01:08:28,748 --> 01:08:31,418
Shall I serve coffee or tea?

764
01:08:32,252 --> 01:08:33,670
Tea, of course.

765
01:08:33,837 --> 01:08:34,921
Excellent.

766
01:08:35,088 --> 01:08:37,424
Second: Milk or lemon?

767
01:08:38,425 --> 01:08:39,509
Milk?

768
01:08:40,844 --> 01:08:43,179
That would depend on the tea.

769
01:08:43,346 --> 01:08:44,389
Correct.

770
01:08:45,348 --> 01:08:49,603
And now the third
and most grave of inquiries:

771
01:08:49,769 --> 01:08:55,108
In which year did a Harvard sculler
outrow an Oxford man at Henley?

772
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:06,369
Surely such a travesty
has never occurred.

773
01:09:06,953 --> 01:09:08,872
Your heart is true.

774
01:09:09,706 --> 01:09:11,124
You may pass.

775
01:09:12,918 --> 01:09:15,295
Welcome to Château Villette.

776
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:22,844
Leigh Teabing has spent
his entire life...

777
01:09:23,011 --> 01:09:25,889
...studying the Grail.
That thing is one hot tamale.

778
01:09:26,056 --> 01:09:27,474
Sorry?

779
01:09:27,641 --> 01:09:30,769
The cryptex, it's a hot coal.

780
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:33,980
A hot potato?

781
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:39,819
So you want to keep our chest
close to our cards, yes?

782
01:09:41,446 --> 01:09:43,323
Very close.

783
01:10:04,511 --> 01:10:07,180
The truck's signal is coming online.

784
01:10:07,347 --> 01:10:08,807
It's about time.

785
01:10:12,519 --> 01:10:14,187
Locked on and tracking, sir.

786
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:20,402
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

787
01:10:20,944 --> 01:10:25,490
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Château Villette.

788
01:10:26,366 --> 01:10:29,703
The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.

789
01:10:46,219 --> 01:10:47,554
Aringarosa.

790
01:10:58,481 --> 01:11:01,568
I still don't know why
he put you into this...

791
01:11:02,235 --> 01:11:04,154
...and I'm sorry.

792
01:11:09,242 --> 01:11:10,452
But...

793
01:11:11,244 --> 01:11:13,079
...I'm also very glad.

794
01:11:31,306 --> 01:11:34,017
You are requested
to make yourself at home.

795
01:11:42,275 --> 01:11:43,485
Robert!

796
01:11:44,569 --> 01:11:47,155
And you travel with a maiden,
it seems.

797
01:11:47,322 --> 01:11:50,617
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.

798
01:11:50,784 --> 01:11:52,953
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

799
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:56,957
It's an honor to welcome you...

800
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,626
...even though it's late.

801
01:11:59,918 --> 01:12:03,797
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.

802
01:12:05,006 --> 01:12:08,051
So late, mademoiselle,
it's almost early.

803
01:12:10,637 --> 01:12:12,305
What a lovely smile you have.

804
01:12:14,307 --> 01:12:15,350
Earl Grey?

805
01:12:16,309 --> 01:12:17,435
Lemon.

806
01:12:18,144 --> 01:12:19,312
Correct.

807
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,210
Château Villette. Yes.

808
01:12:48,341 --> 01:12:50,051
- No.
- Oh, you must.

809
01:12:50,218 --> 01:12:53,013
Remy is from Lyons,
but nevertheless...

810
01:12:53,179 --> 01:12:54,681
...he is fantastic with sauces.

811
01:12:54,848 --> 01:12:57,058
- Thank you.
- No, I can't.

812
01:13:01,855 --> 01:13:03,982
A dramatic late-night arrival.

813
01:13:05,317 --> 01:13:07,736
Mention of life and death.

814
01:13:08,737 --> 01:13:11,406
What can an old cripple
do for you, Robert?

815
01:13:12,365 --> 01:13:16,077
We wanna talk about
the Priory of Sion.

816
01:13:16,494 --> 01:13:17,746
The keepers?

817
01:13:18,663 --> 01:13:20,040
The secret war?

818
01:13:20,206 --> 01:13:22,208
Sorry for all the mystery.

819
01:13:22,918 --> 01:13:25,962
Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.

820
01:13:26,379 --> 01:13:27,505
You?

821
01:13:28,298 --> 01:13:31,718
- Really?
- Not without your help.

822
01:13:32,093 --> 01:13:35,221
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

823
01:13:35,388 --> 01:13:36,598
Not if it works.

824
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:41,394
There are always four:

825
01:13:42,145 --> 01:13:45,315
The Grand Master
and the three Sénéchaux...

826
01:13:45,482 --> 01:13:48,902
...make up the primary
guardians of the Grail.

827
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,614
Thank you, Remy.
That'll be all for now.

828
01:13:59,371 --> 01:14:02,749
The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.

829
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:07,379
Philippe de Chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

830
01:14:07,545 --> 01:14:09,506
And that is what
they want you to believe.

831
01:14:10,423 --> 01:14:13,260
The Priory is charged
with a single task:

832
01:14:13,426 --> 01:14:16,763
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

833
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,474
The source of God's power
on earth.

834
01:14:19,641 --> 01:14:21,268
No, that's a common
misunderstanding.

835
01:14:21,434 --> 01:14:26,439
The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on earth:

836
01:14:27,107 --> 01:14:28,441
The Holy Grail.

837
01:14:28,942 --> 01:14:30,610
I don't understand.

838
01:14:30,777 --> 01:14:34,948
What power? Some magic dishes?

839
01:14:35,615 --> 01:14:39,786
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

840
01:14:42,372 --> 01:14:44,165
To understand the Holy Grail,
my dear...

841
01:14:44,332 --> 01:14:47,669
...you must first understand
the Holy Bible.

842
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:07,439
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

843
01:15:08,148 --> 01:15:12,652
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man:

844
01:15:12,819 --> 01:15:14,613
The pagan emperor Constantine.

845
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:17,157
I thought Constantine
was a Christian.

846
01:15:17,324 --> 01:15:20,327
Oh, hardly, no.
He was a lifelong pagan...

847
01:15:20,493 --> 01:15:23,163
...who was baptized
on his deathbed.

848
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:26,666
Constantine was Rome's
supreme holy man.

849
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,501
From time immemorial...

850
01:15:28,668 --> 01:15:33,173
...his people had worshiped a balance
between nature's male deities...

851
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:36,885
...and the goddess,
or sacred feminine.

852
01:15:37,677 --> 01:15:41,222
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

853
01:15:41,848 --> 01:15:43,767
Three centuries earlier...

854
01:15:43,934 --> 01:15:46,937
...a young Jew named Jesus
had come along...

855
01:15:47,103 --> 01:15:49,439
...preaching love and a single God.

856
01:15:49,606 --> 01:15:52,776
Centuries after his crucifixion...

857
01:15:53,193 --> 01:15:56,029
...Christ's followers
had grown exponentially...

858
01:15:56,196 --> 01:15:58,782
...and had started a religious war
against the pagans.

859
01:16:03,828 --> 01:16:07,249
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

860
01:16:07,874 --> 01:16:11,169
Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

861
01:16:11,336 --> 01:16:14,297
We can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions...

862
01:16:14,464 --> 01:16:17,050
...that it threatened
to tear Rome in two.

863
01:16:17,217 --> 01:16:20,553
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan...

864
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,555
...but he was also a pragmatist.

865
01:16:22,722 --> 01:16:24,891
And in 325 anno Domini...

866
01:16:25,058 --> 01:16:30,188
...he decided to unify Rome under
a single religion, Christianity.

867
01:16:30,355 --> 01:16:34,568
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.

868
01:16:34,734 --> 01:16:38,029
And to strengthen this new
Christian tradition...

869
01:16:38,196 --> 01:16:40,490
...Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering...

870
01:16:40,657 --> 01:16:43,535
...known as the Council of Nicaea.

871
01:16:43,702 --> 01:16:45,203
And at this council...

872
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:50,292
...the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well...

873
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:54,421
...everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels...

874
01:16:54,588 --> 01:16:56,131
...to the date for Easter...

875
01:16:56,298 --> 01:16:59,426
...to the administering
of the sacraments, and of course...

876
01:16:59,593 --> 01:17:01,595
...the immortality of Jesus.

877
01:17:02,095 --> 01:17:03,388
I don't follow.

878
01:17:03,763 --> 01:17:06,433
Well, ma chère,
until that moment in history...

879
01:17:06,975 --> 01:17:11,605
...Jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet...

880
01:17:11,771 --> 01:17:15,650
...as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

881
01:17:16,818 --> 01:17:18,695
A mortal man.

882
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:22,198
Some Christians held
that Jesus was mortal.

883
01:17:22,365 --> 01:17:25,118
Some Christians believed
he was divine.

884
01:17:25,285 --> 01:17:26,620
Not the Son of God?

885
01:17:26,786 --> 01:17:29,205
Not even his nephew twice removed.

886
01:17:29,372 --> 01:17:33,293
Hold on, you're saying
Jesus' divinity came from a vote.

887
01:17:33,627 --> 01:17:36,504
Well, remember, in those days,
gods were everywhere.

888
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,092
By infusing Jesus the man
with the divine magic...

889
01:17:41,259 --> 01:17:44,804
...by making him capable
of earthly miracles...

890
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:49,100
...as well as his own resurrection,
Constantine turned him into a god...

891
01:17:49,267 --> 01:17:51,478
...but within the human world.

892
01:17:51,645 --> 01:17:55,065
And he basically knocked the more
distant gods out of the game.

893
01:17:55,232 --> 01:17:58,735
Constantine did not create
Jesus' divinity.

894
01:17:58,902 --> 01:18:02,906
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

895
01:18:03,073 --> 01:18:04,741
- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.

896
01:18:04,908 --> 01:18:07,953
You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

897
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:12,916
Fact: For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.

898
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:15,168
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

899
01:18:15,335 --> 01:18:17,837
Absurd. There was a formal
announcement of his promotion.

900
01:18:18,004 --> 01:18:20,006
They couldn't even agree
on the Nicene Creed!

901
01:18:20,173 --> 01:18:23,593
Excuse me.
"Who is God, who is man?"

902
01:18:27,931 --> 01:18:30,850
How many have been murdered
over this question?

903
01:18:31,643 --> 01:18:34,604
As long as there has been
a one true God...

904
01:18:34,771 --> 01:18:36,982
...there has been killing
in his name.

905
01:18:45,532 --> 01:18:48,159
Now let me show you the Grail.

906
01:18:56,293 --> 01:18:59,379
This used to be the ballroom.

907
01:18:59,546 --> 01:19:01,673
I have little occasion to dance
these days.

908
01:19:02,215 --> 01:19:04,926
I trust you recognize
The Last Supper...

909
01:19:05,468 --> 01:19:09,514
...the great fresco by
Leonardo da Vinci.

910
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:14,519
Now, my dear,
if you would close your eyes.

911
01:19:14,686 --> 01:19:16,938
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

912
01:19:17,105 --> 01:19:19,482
You asked for my help, I recall.

913
01:19:19,649 --> 01:19:22,319
Allow an old man his indulgences.

914
01:19:26,573 --> 01:19:30,035
Now, mademoiselle,
where is Jesus sitting?

915
01:19:30,577 --> 01:19:32,329
- In the middle.
- Good.

916
01:19:32,495 --> 01:19:35,373
He and his disciples
are breaking bread.

917
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,959
And what drink?

918
01:19:38,293 --> 01:19:40,211
Wine. They drank wine.

919
01:19:40,378 --> 01:19:42,714
Splendid. And one final question:

920
01:19:42,881 --> 01:19:45,926
How many wineglasses
are there on the table?

921
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,179
One? The Holy Grail?

922
01:19:49,346 --> 01:19:50,388
Open your eyes.

923
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:55,018
No single cup.

924
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,811
No chalice.

925
01:19:56,978 --> 01:19:59,773
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

926
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:03,109
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend...

927
01:20:03,276 --> 01:20:07,572
...celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

928
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:12,869
Now, Robert,
you could be of help to us.

929
01:20:13,036 --> 01:20:16,957
If you'd be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman, please.

930
01:20:17,123 --> 01:20:20,877
No balloon animals.
I can make a great duck.

931
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:28,051
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.

932
01:20:28,218 --> 01:20:30,387
- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.

933
01:20:30,553 --> 01:20:32,639
This is known as the blade.

934
01:20:32,806 --> 01:20:34,724
It represents aggression
and manhood.

935
01:20:34,891 --> 01:20:37,686
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

936
01:20:37,852 --> 01:20:41,940
Yes, the more penises you have, the
higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

937
01:20:42,107 --> 01:20:46,444
Now, as you would imagine, the
female symbol is its exact opposite.

938
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:48,071
This is called the chalice.

939
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:53,076
And the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or, more importantly...

940
01:20:53,243 --> 01:20:55,453
...the shape of a woman's womb.

941
01:20:56,621 --> 01:20:59,624
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

942
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:04,796
It is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanhood.

943
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:11,052
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful...

944
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:15,557
...that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

945
01:21:15,724 --> 01:21:17,017
Wait, please.

946
01:21:17,183 --> 01:21:21,730
You're saying the Holy Grail
is a person? A woman?

947
01:21:22,564 --> 01:21:26,568
And it turns out, she makes
an appearance right there.

948
01:21:27,152 --> 01:21:28,820
But they are all men.

949
01:21:28,987 --> 01:21:30,113
Are they?

950
01:21:30,322 --> 01:21:32,741
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord...

951
01:21:32,908 --> 01:21:35,660
...seated in the place of honor?

952
01:21:36,453 --> 01:21:38,330
Flowing red hair.

953
01:21:39,414 --> 01:21:41,708
Folded feminine hands.

954
01:21:42,876 --> 01:21:45,337
Hint of a bosom. No?

955
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,220
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

956
01:21:54,512 --> 01:21:55,889
Who is she?

957
01:21:57,182 --> 01:21:59,059
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

958
01:21:59,434 --> 01:22:00,477
The prostitute?

959
01:22:01,436 --> 01:22:02,938
She was no such thing.

960
01:22:03,313 --> 01:22:07,943
Smeared by the Church
in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.

961
01:22:10,362 --> 01:22:13,198
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

962
01:22:20,205 --> 01:22:22,207
This is an old wives' tale.

963
01:22:22,374 --> 01:22:23,833
The original one, in fact.

964
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,127
There's virtually no empirical proof.

965
01:22:26,294 --> 01:22:29,506
He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.

966
01:22:29,673 --> 01:22:31,383
Theories. There are theories.

967
01:22:31,549 --> 01:22:34,761
Notice how Jesus and Mary
are clothed.

968
01:22:36,137 --> 01:22:38,223
Mirror images of each other.

969
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:40,892
The mind sees
what it chooses to see.

970
01:22:41,059 --> 01:22:45,522
And venturing into the even more
bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...

971
01:22:45,689 --> 01:22:49,234
...appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other...

972
01:22:49,401 --> 01:22:53,989
...as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them.

973
01:22:54,948 --> 01:22:58,326
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

974
01:23:00,829 --> 01:23:03,456
Yes. Oh, and Robert,
notice what happens...

975
01:23:03,623 --> 01:23:06,793
...when these two figures
change position.

976
01:23:07,627 --> 01:23:10,964
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.

977
01:23:11,131 --> 01:23:13,049
No. But history...

978
01:23:13,425 --> 01:23:15,260
...she does make it true.

979
01:23:15,427 --> 01:23:18,680
Now, listen to this. It's from
the Gospel according to Philip.

980
01:23:18,847 --> 01:23:19,890
Philip?

981
01:23:20,056 --> 01:23:22,934
Yes, it was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea...

982
01:23:23,101 --> 01:23:25,145
...along with any other gospels
that made...

983
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,814
...Jesus appear human
and not divine.

984
01:23:27,981 --> 01:23:32,944
"And the companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene.

985
01:23:33,278 --> 01:23:37,032
Christ loved her more
than all the disciples...

986
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:39,117
...and used to kiss her on the..."

987
01:23:39,284 --> 01:23:41,161
But this says nothing of marriage.

988
01:23:41,328 --> 01:23:44,039
Well, actually...

989
01:23:44,205 --> 01:23:45,248
Robert.

990
01:23:45,874 --> 01:23:50,545
Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."

991
01:23:50,712 --> 01:23:55,175
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

992
01:23:55,342 --> 01:23:58,053
- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.

993
01:23:58,219 --> 01:24:01,181
- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.

994
01:24:01,348 --> 01:24:05,352
"And Peter said,
'Did he prefer her to us?'

995
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:07,604
And Levi answered:

996
01:24:07,771 --> 01:24:11,900
'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

997
01:24:12,067 --> 01:24:16,571
If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'

998
01:24:16,738 --> 01:24:21,243
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...

999
01:24:21,409 --> 01:24:25,288
...that it's up to her
to continue his Church.

1000
01:24:26,373 --> 01:24:29,084
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

1001
01:24:29,876 --> 01:24:33,713
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

1002
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:38,885
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

1003
01:24:39,427 --> 01:24:44,683
Now, my dear, the word
in French for Holy Grail.

1004
01:24:46,101 --> 01:24:49,271
From the Middle English
"Sangreal"...

1005
01:24:49,437 --> 01:24:52,065
...of the original Arthurian legend.

1006
01:24:52,232 --> 01:24:57,404
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

1007
01:24:59,072 --> 01:25:02,576
Sang real, it means "royal blood."

1008
01:25:03,243 --> 01:25:07,497
When the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of Christ...

1009
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:13,378
...it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

1010
01:25:14,337 --> 01:25:17,215
But how could Christ
have a bloodline, unless...?

1011
01:25:17,382 --> 01:25:20,218
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.

1012
01:25:28,768 --> 01:25:33,148
For her own safety and for that
of Christ's unborn child...

1013
01:25:33,315 --> 01:25:36,443
...she fled the Holy Land
and came to France.

1014
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:41,740
And here, it is said,
she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.

1015
01:25:42,866 --> 01:25:45,285
They know the child's name.

1016
01:25:46,202 --> 01:25:48,121
- A little girl.
- Yes.

1017
01:25:48,288 --> 01:25:50,415
If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.

1018
01:25:50,582 --> 01:25:51,666
Why?

1019
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:55,503
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

1020
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:57,422
People found God through sex?

1021
01:25:57,589 --> 01:26:00,467
In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven...

1022
01:26:00,634 --> 01:26:03,470
...but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that...

1023
01:26:03,637 --> 01:26:05,931
...in salvation through Jesus Christ.

1024
01:26:06,097 --> 01:26:08,850
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

1025
01:26:09,017 --> 01:26:12,229
Women, then, are a huge threat
to the Church.

1026
01:26:12,395 --> 01:26:14,272
The Catholic Inquisition
soon publishes...

1027
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:17,776
...what may be the most
blood-soaked book in human history.

1028
01:26:17,943 --> 01:26:20,362
The Malleus Maleficarum.

1029
01:26:21,446 --> 01:26:23,114
The Witches' Hammer.

1030
01:26:23,406 --> 01:26:27,160
It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill...

1031
01:26:27,327 --> 01:26:29,621
...all freethinking women.

1032
01:26:32,749 --> 01:26:34,960
In three centuries of witch hunts...

1033
01:26:35,377 --> 01:26:39,130
...50,000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.

1034
01:26:39,297 --> 01:26:41,925
Oh, at least that.
Some say millions.

1035
01:26:42,509 --> 01:26:44,261
Imagine, then, Robert...

1036
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:48,640
...that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.

1037
01:26:49,599 --> 01:26:52,644
You asked what would
be worth killing for.

1038
01:26:53,103 --> 01:26:56,815
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

1039
01:26:57,566 --> 01:26:59,859
This is the secret
that the Priory of Sion...

1040
01:27:00,026 --> 01:27:02,445
...has defended
for over 20 centuries.

1041
01:27:02,612 --> 01:27:05,824
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

1042
01:27:06,324 --> 01:27:09,828
The keepers of the proof
of our true past.

1043
01:27:09,995 --> 01:27:14,499
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ...

1044
01:27:16,126 --> 01:27:17,877
...and Mary Magdalene.

1045
01:27:27,637 --> 01:27:28,888
Sir Leigh?

1046
01:27:29,681 --> 01:27:33,018
Sometimes I wonder
who is serving whom.

1047
01:27:33,685 --> 01:27:36,730
His sauces are not that fantastic.

1048
01:27:39,107 --> 01:27:40,609
Yes, can I help you?

1049
01:27:40,775 --> 01:27:42,861
Yes. They're on the news now.

1050
01:27:45,864 --> 01:27:49,200
Living descendants? Is it possible?

1051
01:27:49,367 --> 01:27:51,036
It's not impossible.

1052
01:27:52,245 --> 01:27:55,832
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

1053
01:27:55,999 --> 01:27:57,918
You are wanted for four murders!

1054
01:27:58,335 --> 01:28:00,629
That's why Vernet said
"killing spree."

1055
01:28:00,795 --> 01:28:04,257
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

1056
01:28:04,424 --> 01:28:06,927
- That's why he needed you.
- You will leave my house!

1057
01:28:07,093 --> 01:28:09,137
- Leigh, listen!
- No, I'm calling the police.

1058
01:28:09,304 --> 01:28:11,681
Jacques Saunière
was her grandfather.

1059
01:28:14,517 --> 01:28:16,186
You're the obsessive Priory scholar.

1060
01:28:16,353 --> 01:28:18,605
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

1061
01:28:19,773 --> 01:28:22,651
I'll bet Jacques Saunière
was on one of those lists.

1062
01:28:24,569 --> 01:28:27,113
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn't he?

1063
01:28:27,405 --> 01:28:29,991
- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.

1064
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:35,372
Consider: Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

1065
01:28:35,538 --> 01:28:38,833
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other Sénéchaux dead?

1066
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,127
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

1067
01:28:41,753 --> 01:28:45,257
You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

1068
01:28:45,423 --> 01:28:47,133
Someone outside the society.

1069
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:52,597
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

1070
01:28:54,891 --> 01:28:57,435
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

1071
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,938
Not really.

1072
01:29:01,481 --> 01:29:03,733
No, that's impossible.

1073
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:08,488
Can that really...?

1074
01:29:10,865 --> 01:29:12,200
Is it the keystone?

1075
01:29:15,537 --> 01:29:17,914
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

1076
01:29:18,248 --> 01:29:20,458
Will you just tell us
what the hell it's for?

1077
01:29:38,351 --> 01:29:40,061
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

1078
01:29:40,312 --> 01:29:44,399
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

1079
01:29:53,158 --> 01:29:54,326
Yes.

1080
01:29:54,492 --> 01:29:57,329
As the legend foretold:

1081
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,291
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1082
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:03,126
Oh, my.

1083
01:30:09,966 --> 01:30:11,468
Leigh.

1084
01:30:14,846 --> 01:30:16,348
Leigh?

1085
01:30:17,224 --> 01:30:18,266
Please.

1086
01:30:18,433 --> 01:30:20,477
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

1087
01:30:22,854 --> 01:30:24,898
Inside the keystone...

1088
01:30:26,233 --> 01:30:27,776
...there'll be a map.

1089
01:30:27,943 --> 01:30:30,779
A map that will lead us
to the Holy Grail.

1090
01:30:34,699 --> 01:30:37,661
To be trained by
the Grand Master himself.

1091
01:30:38,078 --> 01:30:41,957
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

1092
01:30:44,459 --> 01:30:47,379
And he must have sung you
the riddle songs.

1093
01:30:47,545 --> 01:30:49,089
I know some of them.

1094
01:30:58,348 --> 01:31:00,225
Can you keep secrets?

1095
01:31:01,768 --> 01:31:04,688
Can you know a thing
and never say it again?

1096
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:06,815
And codes?

1097
01:31:08,066 --> 01:31:12,112
I imagine they lie down
for you like lovers.

1098
01:31:15,073 --> 01:31:19,995
A Sénéchal. A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

1099
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:23,081
Tell him, please.
I don't know any of this.

1100
01:31:23,248 --> 01:31:26,126
Leigh, it's not that simple.
She doesn't rem...

1101
01:31:27,669 --> 01:31:28,962
Robert!

1102
01:31:34,259 --> 01:31:35,635
Do not move, woman.

1103
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:40,932
Cripple.

1104
01:31:43,268 --> 01:31:45,312
Put the box on the table.

1105
01:31:45,979 --> 01:31:47,772
What, this trifle?

1106
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:51,943
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

1107
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:55,155
Put the keystone on the table.

1108
01:31:56,114 --> 01:31:57,782
You will not succeed.

1109
01:32:00,035 --> 01:32:03,246
Only the worthy
can unlock the stone.

1110
01:32:32,609 --> 01:32:35,028
Rip the gate down.

1111
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:40,200
Well, well, my dear.

1112
01:32:44,371 --> 01:32:45,705
Sit down.

1113
01:32:45,872 --> 01:32:47,332
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1114
01:32:47,499 --> 01:32:49,668
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1115
01:32:49,834 --> 01:32:52,212
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

1116
01:32:52,379 --> 01:32:54,547
Get something
to restrain this monster.

1117
01:32:59,552 --> 01:33:01,179
Above the joint.

1118
01:33:02,013 --> 01:33:06,601
Fortunately,
a dragon most easy to slay.

1119
01:33:06,768 --> 01:33:08,228
He's wearing a cilice.

1120
01:33:08,979 --> 01:33:11,231
- A what?
- Well, look.

1121
01:33:13,692 --> 01:33:16,194
Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

1122
01:33:19,698 --> 01:33:22,450
Not so common these days.

1123
01:33:22,867 --> 01:33:24,786
Opus Dei.

1124
01:33:24,953 --> 01:33:27,455
Remy, take care of this.

1125
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:33,253
Fache is Opus Dei.

1126
01:33:34,504 --> 01:33:37,507
The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

1127
01:33:37,674 --> 01:33:39,342
Robert.

1128
01:33:41,636 --> 01:33:44,931
Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.

1129
01:33:46,224 --> 01:33:47,267
Leigh?

1130
01:33:49,394 --> 01:33:51,354
You want what's in this box?

1131
01:33:52,439 --> 01:33:54,232
We need a way out of here.

1132
01:33:54,399 --> 01:33:56,443
Well, actually...

1133
01:33:57,485 --> 01:33:59,237
...I do have a plane.

1134
01:34:09,748 --> 01:34:11,625
- Robert! Where do we go?
- Come along.

1135
01:34:11,791 --> 01:34:13,627
- In here. Come in.
- Over here.

1136
01:34:13,793 --> 01:34:16,296
Get the door. Hurry.

1137
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:20,300
Over here. Over here. Sophie.

1138
01:34:20,467 --> 01:34:21,760
Watch out!

1139
01:34:23,219 --> 01:34:24,971
Be careful.

1140
01:34:25,138 --> 01:34:26,806
Come, Rem...

1141
01:34:33,897 --> 01:34:35,273
Shit.

1142
01:34:38,276 --> 01:34:39,319
Easy.

1143
01:35:02,259 --> 01:35:03,301
Jesus!

1144
01:35:03,468 --> 01:35:04,511
Apropos.

1145
01:35:07,347 --> 01:35:09,224
I can't imagine
what your complaint is.

1146
01:35:09,391 --> 01:35:12,435
I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

1147
01:35:12,602 --> 01:35:15,021
Put that away. We might need him.

1148
01:35:15,605 --> 01:35:16,773
Better.

1149
01:35:23,697 --> 01:35:25,365
Opus Dei.

1150
01:35:26,324 --> 01:35:28,868
- What is it?
- A conservative Catholic sect.

1151
01:35:29,035 --> 01:35:30,912
Opus Dei is a prelature
to the Vatican.

1152
01:35:31,079 --> 01:35:34,457
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

1153
01:35:34,624 --> 01:35:36,585
No, no, no. Not the Vatican...

1154
01:35:36,751 --> 01:35:39,296
...and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

1155
01:35:39,462 --> 01:35:41,923
And one that has been
going on forever.

1156
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:44,384
On the one side stands the Priory...

1157
01:35:44,551 --> 01:35:47,220
...and on the other
an ancient group of despots...

1158
01:35:47,387 --> 01:35:49,681
...with members hidden
in high-ranking positions...

1159
01:35:49,848 --> 01:35:51,641
...throughout the Church.

1160
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:56,479
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1161
01:35:56,646 --> 01:35:59,357
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill...

1162
01:35:59,524 --> 01:36:01,484
...the living descendants
of Jesus Christ.

1163
01:36:01,651 --> 01:36:03,361
- That's insane.
- Is it?

1164
01:36:03,570 --> 01:36:06,156
How many atrocities and scandals
has the Catholic Church...

1165
01:36:06,323 --> 01:36:08,450
...rationalized in its time?
And what happens...

1166
01:36:08,617 --> 01:36:11,411
...if some persuasive scientific
evidence emerges that shows...

1167
01:36:11,578 --> 01:36:14,706
...that the Church's version of Christ
is inaccurate?

1168
01:36:16,374 --> 01:36:17,709
What if the world discovers...

1169
01:36:17,876 --> 01:36:20,629
...that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

1170
01:36:20,795 --> 01:36:24,507
The Vatican faces a crisis of faith
unprecedented.

1171
01:36:25,216 --> 01:36:27,886
I've got a signal now, sir.
It's ringing.

1172
01:36:30,013 --> 01:36:34,768
Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got
tired of the weather here in France...

1173
01:36:35,143 --> 01:36:38,104
...and could you make
the plane ready for...

1174
01:36:40,023 --> 01:36:41,233
...Zurich.

1175
01:36:41,775 --> 01:36:43,276
Yes. No, we love Zurich.

1176
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:53,787
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

1177
01:36:55,872 --> 01:36:57,332
You're the one who lost them.

1178
01:36:57,707 --> 01:37:01,836
You control every step of this investigation.
You don't let anybody breathe.

1179
01:37:02,337 --> 01:37:05,048
You're acting like
you lost your mind.

1180
01:37:08,426 --> 01:37:11,304
What is it with these two birds?

1181
01:37:14,891 --> 01:37:17,769
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1182
01:37:18,645 --> 01:37:21,898
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1183
01:37:49,843 --> 01:37:55,098
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1184
01:37:58,143 --> 01:37:59,978
I am the messenger of God.

1185
01:38:03,815 --> 01:38:06,026
Did you kill my grandfather?

1186
01:38:09,112 --> 01:38:10,822
I am the messenger...

1187
01:38:11,239 --> 01:38:15,327
Each breath you take is a sin.

1188
01:38:16,786 --> 01:38:19,205
No shadow will be safe again.

1189
01:38:19,372 --> 01:38:24,169
For you will be hunted by angels.

1190
01:38:25,545 --> 01:38:27,547
You believe in God?

1191
01:38:28,798 --> 01:38:31,343
Your God doesn't
forgive murderers.

1192
01:38:34,846 --> 01:38:36,723
He burns them.

1193
01:38:47,859 --> 01:38:48,902
Sophie.

1194
01:39:30,277 --> 01:39:31,861
The Teacher will be pleased.

1195
01:39:32,028 --> 01:39:34,281
What will you do
once you have the Grail?

1196
01:39:34,447 --> 01:39:35,740
Destroy it.

1197
01:39:35,907 --> 01:39:39,578
The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.

1198
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:42,289
And the heir?

1199
01:39:46,084 --> 01:39:49,588
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

1200
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:51,631
There will be no need.

1201
01:39:51,798 --> 01:39:56,553
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1202
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,472
There is no way to prove
a living bloodline.

1203
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:01,808
But if you had to...

1204
01:40:03,435 --> 01:40:06,479
...would you do as councils
have done before us?

1205
01:40:15,447 --> 01:40:16,781
Christ...

1206
01:40:21,661 --> 01:40:25,999
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

1207
01:40:29,377 --> 01:40:32,339
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1208
01:40:41,932 --> 01:40:43,475
Robert.

1209
01:40:43,642 --> 01:40:47,646
When we land, you must go
straight to your embassy.

1210
01:40:48,939 --> 01:40:50,440
Is that so?

1211
01:40:52,359 --> 01:40:54,486
Don't you see it?

1212
01:40:54,653 --> 01:40:56,404
They never wanted you.

1213
01:40:57,197 --> 01:40:59,950
Maybe even Fache didn't.

1214
01:41:00,116 --> 01:41:03,203
It's all about this...

1215
01:41:03,370 --> 01:41:05,080
...idiotic little box.

1216
01:41:09,876 --> 01:41:11,878
That's not too flattering.

1217
01:41:12,504 --> 01:41:14,881
Crazy old man.

1218
01:41:15,215 --> 01:41:17,467
Why leave me with this?

1219
01:41:17,842 --> 01:41:20,470
I should just throw it away.

1220
01:41:24,724 --> 01:41:26,560
He trusted you, Sophie.

1221
01:41:27,561 --> 01:41:30,897
A guardian of the Holy Grail.

1222
01:41:32,482 --> 01:41:34,901
It sounds so stupid.

1223
01:41:36,069 --> 01:41:40,490
It's quite an honor,
if you think about it...

1224
01:41:40,657 --> 01:41:41,992
...and take it seriously.

1225
01:41:42,409 --> 01:41:45,161
He took it seriously enough
to get himself killed.

1226
01:41:45,829 --> 01:41:47,956
Not him. You.

1227
01:41:50,834 --> 01:41:53,545
He was the only family I knew.

1228
01:41:54,004 --> 01:41:56,339
And maybe I didn't know him at all.

1229
01:41:57,924 --> 01:41:59,926
I'm his marionette, Robert.

1230
01:42:00,093 --> 01:42:03,263
Like a girl again,
just with no gift at the end.

1231
01:42:08,935 --> 01:42:10,896
But you've done enough.

1232
01:42:13,565 --> 01:42:18,278
I don't know why Saunière
picked me to help you, Sophie.

1233
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:23,950
But I won't leave you alone
in all this.

1234
01:42:30,206 --> 01:42:31,875
Two marionettes, then.

1235
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:37,881
Maybe this is why he chose you.

1236
01:42:40,967 --> 01:42:43,345
Because you will stay.

1237
01:42:58,818 --> 01:43:00,612
I need the flight plan.

1238
01:43:00,904 --> 01:43:01,947
Ten minutes.

1239
01:43:02,906 --> 01:43:05,283
I asked you to get it for me.

1240
01:43:06,409 --> 01:43:08,328
I'm on break.

1241
01:43:09,788 --> 01:43:11,373
Come back in 10 minutes.

1242
01:43:13,375 --> 01:43:15,543
My nose! My nose!

1243
01:43:16,127 --> 01:43:17,504
The flight plan, please.

1244
01:43:17,671 --> 01:43:18,713
You asshole!

1245
01:43:31,977 --> 01:43:33,728
It's not "cross."

1246
01:43:34,938 --> 01:43:36,273
"Spear"?

1247
01:43:43,238 --> 01:43:44,823
What happened to her?

1248
01:43:45,532 --> 01:43:47,200
No one knows.

1249
01:43:47,576 --> 01:43:50,954
Mary Magdalene lived out
her days in hiding.

1250
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:55,041
And the zealots pursued her still...

1251
01:43:55,584 --> 01:44:00,005
...even in death, trying to destroy
proof of her existence.

1252
01:44:00,964 --> 01:44:03,341
But she always had her Knights.

1253
01:44:03,508 --> 01:44:05,969
Brave men sworn to defend her.

1254
01:44:06,136 --> 01:44:08,722
You see, to worship
before her sarcophagus...

1255
01:44:09,222 --> 01:44:12,517
...to kneel before the bones
of Mary Magdalene...

1256
01:44:12,684 --> 01:44:15,854
...was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power...

1257
01:44:16,021 --> 01:44:17,063
...who were oppressed.

1258
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:21,902
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline...

1259
01:44:22,068 --> 01:44:24,738
...until most believed
her sarcophagus...

1260
01:44:25,739 --> 01:44:27,407
...the Holy Grail...

1261
01:44:28,408 --> 01:44:31,411
...was finally lost in time.

1262
01:44:42,297 --> 01:44:43,340
What are you doing?

1263
01:44:43,506 --> 01:44:46,176
At the chateau, you said,
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1264
01:44:46,343 --> 01:44:47,761
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1265
01:44:47,928 --> 01:44:51,556
In Latin, Sub rosa.
Literal translation...

1266
01:44:51,723 --> 01:44:53,350
"Beneath the rose."

1267
01:45:06,321 --> 01:45:07,822
We need a mirror.

1268
01:45:07,989 --> 01:45:10,867
Backwards. In the style
of Leonardo himself.

1269
01:45:11,034 --> 01:45:12,744
Thank you.

1270
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:21,044
In London lies a knight
a Pope interred

1271
01:45:21,211 --> 01:45:24,965
His labor's fruit
a Holy wrath incurred

1272
01:45:25,298 --> 01:45:28,301
You seek the orb
that ought be on his tomb

1273
01:45:28,635 --> 01:45:32,305
It speaks of Rosy flesh
and seeded womb

1274
01:45:32,472 --> 01:45:36,476
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred"?

1275
01:45:36,643 --> 01:45:40,480
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

1276
01:45:40,647 --> 01:45:43,817
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1277
01:45:43,984 --> 01:45:45,026
Templars.

1278
01:45:45,193 --> 01:45:48,321
And there's just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

1279
01:45:48,488 --> 01:45:49,656
Temple Church.

1280
01:45:49,823 --> 01:45:51,992
Temple Church.
If you'll excuse me, my dear...

1281
01:45:52,158 --> 01:45:55,036
...Roger and I must discuss
a change in flight plan.

1282
01:45:55,203 --> 01:45:56,621
Leigh.

1283
01:45:58,331 --> 01:46:00,750
Harboring and transporting
fugitives?

1284
01:46:01,501 --> 01:46:04,087
You are already implicated enough.

1285
01:46:05,255 --> 01:46:08,883
You and I, Robert,
have observed history.

1286
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:11,344
Time has been our glass.

1287
01:46:11,845 --> 01:46:15,098
We are in history now. Living it.

1288
01:46:16,766 --> 01:46:18,435
Making it.

1289
01:46:19,102 --> 01:46:20,562
"Implicated"?

1290
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:23,356
I am on a Grail quest.

1291
01:46:24,941 --> 01:46:26,484
Forgive me, Robert...

1292
01:46:26,651 --> 01:46:28,987
...but you two may well
have given this old man...

1293
01:46:29,154 --> 01:46:31,531
...the greatest night of his life.

1294
01:46:33,366 --> 01:46:34,534
Thank you.

1295
01:46:36,578 --> 01:46:38,747
He's going to want more money.

1296
01:46:55,847 --> 01:46:59,976
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

1297
01:47:00,143 --> 01:47:05,273
I've lost them.
They flew to Switzerland.

1298
01:47:05,523 --> 01:47:07,734
No extradition.

1299
01:47:10,487 --> 01:47:15,742
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

1300
01:47:20,872 --> 01:47:23,959
What's going on, Bezu?

1301
01:47:26,962 --> 01:47:29,839
You know that I am Opus Dei?

1302
01:47:30,215 --> 01:47:31,758
Yes.

1303
01:47:37,055 --> 01:47:40,600
A bishop of my order called me.

1304
01:47:40,892 --> 01:47:43,019
He said a killer
came to him in confession.

1305
01:47:43,186 --> 01:47:45,939
His name was Robert Langdon.

1306
01:47:47,107 --> 01:47:50,277
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this man's heart.

1307
01:47:50,443 --> 01:47:53,154
That he would keep killing.

1308
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:55,991
He said I had to stop him.

1309
01:47:58,034 --> 01:48:01,871
The bishop broke his vows
to tell me this.

1310
01:48:02,038 --> 01:48:05,458
He charged me
to stop Robert Langdon.

1311
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:13,174
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1312
01:48:13,967 --> 01:48:15,802
The bishop?

1313
01:48:17,095 --> 01:48:19,180
God himself?

1314
01:48:27,814 --> 01:48:30,942
They've changed their flight plan
to London.

1315
01:48:36,823 --> 01:48:41,328
Go on, Fache.
I'll take care of the controller.

1316
01:48:41,494 --> 01:48:46,625
Maybe he needs a few extra euros.

1317
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:51,254
Just tell me next time.

1318
01:49:15,362 --> 01:49:19,157
I have them, tower. Relay Hawker
to land and hold on tarmac.

1319
01:50:16,423 --> 01:50:18,633
- Secure the area!
- Wider!

1320
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,927
- Armed police!
- You two, round the back!

1321
01:50:21,261 --> 01:50:24,514
Armed police!
Put your hands in the air!

1322
01:50:24,681 --> 01:50:26,641
- Three men up!
- Ready!

1323
01:50:26,808 --> 01:50:29,436
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1324
01:50:29,603 --> 01:50:32,063
I'm afraid that's
easier said than done in my case.

1325
01:50:34,107 --> 01:50:35,442
Oh, good morning.

1326
01:50:35,609 --> 01:50:38,486
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

1327
01:50:38,653 --> 01:50:41,406
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives...

1328
01:50:41,573 --> 01:50:43,366
...and you may have
a hostage onboard.

1329
01:50:43,533 --> 01:50:45,118
I'm to take you all into custody.

1330
01:50:45,285 --> 01:50:48,622
Sadly, I have an important medical
appointment which I can't miss.

1331
01:50:48,788 --> 01:50:50,081
I'll fetch the car, sir.

1332
01:50:50,248 --> 01:50:53,126
This is serious, sir. The French police
are on their way. Stop!

1333
01:50:53,668 --> 01:50:56,963
Inspector, I can't afford the time
to indulge your games.

1334
01:50:57,130 --> 01:50:58,506
I'm late and I'm leaving.

1335
01:50:58,673 --> 01:51:00,550
If it's so important
for you to stop us...

1336
01:51:00,717 --> 01:51:02,969
...then you're just going
to have to shoot us.

1337
01:51:03,470 --> 01:51:05,138
You can start with him.

1338
01:51:10,518 --> 01:51:12,145
Search the plane.

1339
01:51:12,312 --> 01:51:13,563
All right.

1340
01:51:25,742 --> 01:51:27,452
I could run them over.

1341
01:51:32,916 --> 01:51:34,042
Bad tip.

1342
01:51:36,044 --> 01:51:37,462
Let him go.

1343
01:51:41,925 --> 01:51:44,344
The French cannot be trusted.

1344
01:51:52,936 --> 01:51:53,979
Everyone comfy?

1345
01:51:56,356 --> 01:51:57,399
Biscuits?

1346
01:51:57,983 --> 01:51:59,651
They didn't notice anything?

1347
01:52:00,026 --> 01:52:04,531
Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don't you find?

1348
01:52:18,587 --> 01:52:21,172
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

1349
01:52:21,381 --> 01:52:22,632
Yes, I do, Teacher.

1350
01:52:22,799 --> 01:52:26,136
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

1351
01:52:26,303 --> 01:52:27,762
I am honored.

1352
01:52:28,013 --> 01:52:32,851
By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.

1353
01:52:35,395 --> 01:52:38,398
- I take it the news is good, then.
- I fly to London.

1354
01:52:38,565 --> 01:52:40,609
The Teacher is waiting for me there.

1355
01:52:40,775 --> 01:52:44,404
He has chosen a house of Opus Dei
to make the exchange.

1356
01:52:44,571 --> 01:52:48,992
Mere currency
for the location of the Grail.

1357
01:52:49,159 --> 01:52:51,161
Imagine it.

1358
01:52:57,042 --> 01:53:02,088
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

1359
01:53:02,255 --> 01:53:05,258
- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.

1360
01:53:06,384 --> 01:53:08,094
This council does not exist.

1361
01:53:09,054 --> 01:53:10,805
As it never has.

1362
01:53:13,642 --> 01:53:17,437
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1363
01:53:24,903 --> 01:53:26,905
Keep an eye out for the police.

1364
01:53:40,001 --> 01:53:42,671
I must say, Robert,
I'm quite impressed...

1365
01:53:42,837 --> 01:53:46,132
...by the way you withstood
my little aeroplane.

1366
01:53:47,759 --> 01:53:49,302
Did he never tell you?

1367
01:53:49,469 --> 01:53:52,806
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1368
01:53:52,973 --> 01:53:54,641
How old were you?

1369
01:53:54,808 --> 01:53:55,976
Seven.

1370
01:53:58,645 --> 01:54:01,773
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out...

1371
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,984
...to the echoes screaming back.

1372
01:54:04,150 --> 01:54:06,653
When they found him,
he was nearly catatonic.

1373
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:07,946
Help!

1374
01:54:08,989 --> 01:54:10,365
It was a long time ago.

1375
01:54:10,532 --> 01:54:12,158
Oh, now, now, Robert.

1376
01:54:12,325 --> 01:54:16,871
You above all people shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

1377
01:54:22,043 --> 01:54:25,380
Temple Church.
I always forget it's right here.

1378
01:54:25,547 --> 01:54:31,261
Built 1185 and modern London
just sprang up right around it.

1379
01:54:34,347 --> 01:54:38,602
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?

1380
01:54:38,768 --> 01:54:39,811
I don't know.

1381
01:54:40,186 --> 01:54:42,856
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself...

1382
01:54:43,023 --> 01:54:44,816
...which is especially odd...

1383
01:54:44,983 --> 01:54:48,361
...since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity.

1384
01:54:56,286 --> 01:54:57,329
Hello?

1385
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:00,749
Why do they make them so scary?

1386
01:55:06,379 --> 01:55:07,505
Oh, it's cold.

1387
01:55:07,672 --> 01:55:11,009
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1388
01:55:20,852 --> 01:55:24,272
So which tomb has an orb?

1389
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:43,833
Those knights
with their legs crossed...

1390
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,086
...means they'd been
to the Holy Land.

1391
01:55:46,253 --> 01:55:49,547
Two wear tunics over their armor...

1392
01:55:49,714 --> 01:55:52,884
...and two have full-length robes.

1393
01:55:53,927 --> 01:55:55,679
Two are grasping swords.

1394
01:55:56,096 --> 01:55:59,766
And one... Two are praying.

1395
01:56:01,685 --> 01:56:03,687
This one has his arms at his sides.

1396
01:56:03,853 --> 01:56:07,566
Oh, and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

1397
01:56:07,732 --> 01:56:12,445
I don't see any orb
that ought be on a tomb.

1398
01:56:13,321 --> 01:56:16,116
"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?

1399
01:56:16,283 --> 01:56:18,201
Maybe.

1400
01:56:28,962 --> 01:56:30,547
These aren't tombs.

1401
01:56:30,714 --> 01:56:33,133
- What? Yes, of course they are.
- No.

1402
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:35,302
- They're effigies.
- What?

1403
01:56:35,468 --> 01:56:37,554
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

1404
01:56:37,762 --> 01:56:39,222
This place is wrong.

1405
01:56:41,224 --> 01:56:44,603
Can we go now? We should go.

1406
01:56:47,772 --> 01:56:49,482
Sophie! No!

1407
01:56:51,192 --> 01:56:52,652
Where is the keystone?

1408
01:56:53,778 --> 01:56:54,946
Do not test me!

1409
01:56:55,113 --> 01:56:56,406
- Let her go!
- Don't hurt her.

1410
01:56:56,573 --> 01:56:58,658
Give me the keystone! Give it to me!

1411
01:56:58,825 --> 01:57:00,577
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1412
01:57:00,744 --> 01:57:04,414
Just let her go, and you and I can...
We'll come to some agreement.

1413
01:57:04,998 --> 01:57:06,458
Remy.

1414
01:57:09,794 --> 01:57:12,339
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1415
01:57:13,632 --> 01:57:16,885
Put it away. They're too close
together. You don't have a clear shot.

1416
01:57:17,052 --> 01:57:19,471
- Yes, I do.
- What do you think you're doing?

1417
01:57:21,681 --> 01:57:26,144
Thank you, professor. For a moment,
this was getting complicated.

1418
01:57:26,311 --> 01:57:28,396
Oh, this is absurd.
Oh, for God's sake, man!

1419
01:57:31,691 --> 01:57:33,860
That was satisfying.

1420
01:57:34,027 --> 01:57:35,904
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

1421
01:57:39,115 --> 01:57:40,867
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1422
01:57:41,034 --> 01:57:42,327
What?

1423
01:57:47,707 --> 01:57:49,709
Here. You okay?

1424
01:57:55,131 --> 01:57:56,216
Sorry.

1425
01:58:37,173 --> 01:58:39,009
I don't think he's following.

1426
01:58:47,183 --> 01:58:51,104
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1427
01:58:53,189 --> 01:58:56,401
- So we have to find it before they do.
- I have to get to a library, fast.

1428
01:59:04,367 --> 01:59:06,077
Lieutenant!

1429
01:59:06,244 --> 01:59:07,829
One flag off the prints.

1430
01:59:11,499 --> 01:59:13,668
Remy Legaludec.

1431
01:59:13,835 --> 01:59:15,420
Petty theft.

1432
01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:20,926
Skipped out on a hospital bill
for a tracheotomy.

1433
01:59:22,802 --> 01:59:24,638
Peanut allergy.

1434
01:59:26,056 --> 01:59:27,474
Like Marie.

1435
01:59:27,641 --> 01:59:29,726
This way. Marie?

1436
01:59:29,893 --> 01:59:32,145
My daughter.

1437
01:59:32,312 --> 01:59:33,939
Over here.

1438
01:59:40,612 --> 01:59:41,696
Where?

1439
01:59:41,863 --> 01:59:43,156
Up there.

1440
02:00:00,507 --> 02:00:02,175
What's all that?

1441
02:00:02,342 --> 02:00:04,719
Very advanced surveillance.

1442
02:00:09,432 --> 02:00:10,767
It's a listening post.

1443
02:00:20,193 --> 02:00:22,404
Get me Fache.

1444
02:00:22,571 --> 02:00:27,534
Four of these names are
the men killed last night.

1445
02:00:35,625 --> 02:00:40,589
He once whined to me about the
wasted space of so large a trunk.

1446
02:00:41,047 --> 02:00:43,174
Let's see if he complains so now.

1447
02:00:44,217 --> 02:00:46,219
Are you the Teacher?

1448
02:00:49,389 --> 02:00:50,473
I am.

1449
02:00:52,225 --> 02:00:56,771
Superbly done.
You've been of great service.

1450
02:01:00,233 --> 02:01:03,069
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.

1451
02:01:03,236 --> 02:01:05,405
You've done enough.

1452
02:01:08,575 --> 02:01:12,287
We cannot let ego
deter us from our goal.

1453
02:01:13,413 --> 02:01:15,415
I understand.

1454
02:01:16,416 --> 02:01:17,584
Good.

1455
02:01:20,754 --> 02:01:25,592
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1456
02:01:25,759 --> 02:01:27,969
I will dispose of the old man.

1457
02:01:29,095 --> 02:01:30,764
Bless you, Silas.

1458
02:01:32,766 --> 02:01:34,059
Teacher.

1459
02:01:42,234 --> 02:01:43,985
Christ be with you.

1460
02:01:46,696 --> 02:01:51,868
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1461
02:01:52,118 --> 02:01:54,162
If we're gonna help Leigh,
that's too long.

1462
02:02:05,882 --> 02:02:07,300
Where you going?

1463
02:02:07,467 --> 02:02:09,636
Getting you a library card.

1464
02:02:13,223 --> 02:02:15,308
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

1465
02:02:15,475 --> 02:02:17,978
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1466
02:02:26,486 --> 02:02:27,821
That's great.

1467
02:02:28,738 --> 02:02:30,991
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

1468
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:34,995
Thanks.

1469
02:02:35,579 --> 02:02:38,915
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

1470
02:02:39,082 --> 02:02:42,502
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1471
02:02:42,669 --> 02:02:44,504
Compounding keywords:

1472
02:02:44,671 --> 02:02:47,549
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1473
02:02:48,174 --> 02:02:52,178
Your precious treasure was
almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1474
02:02:56,558 --> 02:02:58,852
Can you believe how well I did?

1475
02:03:00,395 --> 02:03:02,564
I even convinced the monk.

1476
02:03:03,398 --> 02:03:05,358
I should be in theater.

1477
02:03:12,032 --> 02:03:17,579
A toast to our success, Teacher.
The end of the journey is near.

1478
02:03:20,081 --> 02:03:23,418
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

1479
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:32,469
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

1480
02:03:32,886 --> 02:03:35,055
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings...

1481
02:03:35,221 --> 02:03:38,225
...of some bloke named
Alexander Pope.

1482
02:03:38,391 --> 02:03:39,643
"A. Pope."

1483
02:03:41,228 --> 02:03:43,021
Your grandfather was a genius.

1484
02:03:47,901 --> 02:03:48,985
Come on.

1485
02:04:23,603 --> 02:04:25,355
Emergency.
Which service do you require?

1486
02:04:25,522 --> 02:04:30,652
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

1487
02:04:34,531 --> 02:04:36,658
We've just had a 999 call.

1488
02:04:36,825 --> 02:04:39,202
Triangulation leads back
to Docklands.

1489
02:04:39,369 --> 02:04:41,454
Caller was male.
Claimed your two murderers...

1490
02:04:41,621 --> 02:04:44,291
...are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1491
02:04:53,383 --> 02:04:57,512
The knight we're looking for
is Sir Isaac Newton.

1492
02:04:59,014 --> 02:05:02,767
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

1493
02:05:03,226 --> 02:05:05,520
Gravity, for God sakes.

1494
02:05:06,855 --> 02:05:09,983
And if you choose to believe...

1495
02:05:10,150 --> 02:05:14,571
...he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

1496
02:05:25,123 --> 02:05:27,751
But if he offended
the Catholic Church...

1497
02:05:27,918 --> 02:05:31,713
...the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

1498
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:34,132
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

1499
02:05:34,299 --> 02:05:37,218
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1500
02:05:37,385 --> 02:05:40,513
Sir Isaac Newton's funeral
was presided over...

1501
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:44,351
...by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

1502
02:05:44,517 --> 02:05:48,980
A. Pope. His first initial.
How did I miss that?

1503
02:05:49,397 --> 02:05:50,523
Here.

1504
02:05:50,857 --> 02:05:54,027
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

1505
02:05:55,111 --> 02:05:56,363
An orb.

1506
02:05:56,529 --> 02:06:01,493
Yes. Which one? It's not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing.

1507
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:05,205
"An orb with Rosy flesh
and seeded womb."

1508
02:06:05,372 --> 02:06:10,001
Solar system. The planets.
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1509
02:06:10,543 --> 02:06:12,712
See, our moon is missing.

1510
02:06:12,879 --> 02:06:15,715
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

1511
02:06:16,049 --> 02:06:18,635
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1512
02:06:20,595 --> 02:06:23,557
Robert. These tracks.

1513
02:06:24,391 --> 02:06:26,726
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

1514
02:06:29,771 --> 02:06:31,231
Teabing was here.

1515
02:06:32,566 --> 02:06:33,775
He was alone.

1516
02:06:35,735 --> 02:06:39,906
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did...

1517
02:06:40,991 --> 02:06:43,827
...others might call it God's will.

1518
02:06:44,703 --> 02:06:47,247
I believed that if I had the cryptex...

1519
02:06:47,581 --> 02:06:50,625
...I could solve the riddle alone.

1520
02:06:51,501 --> 02:06:53,003
But I was unworthy.

1521
02:06:53,169 --> 02:06:54,462
But you...

1522
02:06:55,255 --> 02:06:57,757
You have a reason to be here.

1523
02:06:57,924 --> 02:07:01,595
You're the last remaining
guardian of the Grail.

1524
02:07:01,761 --> 02:07:03,930
Your grandfather
and the other Sénéchaux...

1525
02:07:04,097 --> 02:07:06,099
...would not have lied
with dying breath...

1526
02:07:06,266 --> 02:07:09,102
...unless they knew
their secret was preserved.

1527
02:07:11,521 --> 02:07:14,232
How could you know
Saunière's last words?

1528
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:15,442
Leigh.

1529
02:07:16,610 --> 02:07:18,904
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1530
02:07:19,446 --> 02:07:20,780
You are a murderer.

1531
02:07:20,947 --> 02:07:24,034
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1532
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:28,038
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1533
02:07:30,123 --> 02:07:32,167
You self-righteous bastard!

1534
02:07:32,334 --> 02:07:33,668
We need to just walk away.

1535
02:07:33,835 --> 02:07:35,670
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

1536
02:07:38,965 --> 02:07:40,508
I'll do what I have to now.

1537
02:07:45,847 --> 02:07:47,015
Anything.

1538
02:07:51,144 --> 02:07:52,604
Do you understand?

1539
02:07:54,272 --> 02:07:55,941
So now...

1540
02:07:57,150 --> 02:07:59,236
...can't we all be friends again?

1541
02:08:00,487 --> 02:08:01,821
This way.

1542
02:08:38,024 --> 02:08:41,861
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

1543
02:08:43,697 --> 02:08:44,906
I'm listening now.

1544
02:08:45,532 --> 02:08:46,908
For 2000 years...

1545
02:08:47,534 --> 02:08:51,454
...the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind...

1546
02:08:52,247 --> 02:08:57,210
...crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.

1547
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:01,881
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering...

1548
02:09:02,382 --> 02:09:05,302
...drive this church of lies
to its knees.

1549
02:09:06,928 --> 02:09:08,555
Armed police!

1550
02:09:08,763 --> 02:09:10,098
Drop your weapon!

1551
02:09:13,643 --> 02:09:14,686
Stop, Silas!

1552
02:09:27,490 --> 02:09:30,660
We are betrayed, my son.

1553
02:09:31,244 --> 02:09:33,872
The living heir must be revealed.

1554
02:09:34,331 --> 02:09:36,583
Jesus must be shown
for what he was.

1555
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:40,003
Not miraculous, simply man.

1556
02:09:41,087 --> 02:09:42,589
I'm sorry.

1557
02:09:44,716 --> 02:09:46,343
Armed police!

1558
02:09:46,676 --> 02:09:49,804
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1559
02:09:59,231 --> 02:10:01,733
Put it down now! Put it down!

1560
02:10:09,449 --> 02:10:11,493
I am a ghost.

1561
02:10:12,661 --> 02:10:15,288
The dark con can be exposed.

1562
02:10:15,455 --> 02:10:20,794
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

1563
02:10:22,045 --> 02:10:23,630
The three of us.

1564
02:10:41,481 --> 02:10:42,941
How is Silas?

1565
02:10:43,108 --> 02:10:45,485
Is he...? Is he alive?

1566
02:10:45,819 --> 02:10:46,945
The monk?

1567
02:10:50,490 --> 02:10:53,451
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

1568
02:10:54,995 --> 02:10:56,705
Get me out of here, Fache.

1569
02:10:57,247 --> 02:10:58,290
Wait.

1570
02:11:01,751 --> 02:11:04,754
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

1571
02:11:05,505 --> 02:11:09,718
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

1572
02:11:10,594 --> 02:11:15,599
I cannot be implicated here. There are
still important works to be done.

1573
02:11:17,350 --> 02:11:18,685
You used me.

1574
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:22,606
God uses us all.

1575
02:11:23,356 --> 02:11:24,941
Help me, Fache.

1576
02:11:26,067 --> 02:11:27,193
Take him.

1577
02:11:31,865 --> 02:11:33,700
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

1578
02:11:33,867 --> 02:11:35,952
I'm going to need a trace.

1579
02:11:38,788 --> 02:11:40,624
Your Silas is dead.

1580
02:11:47,714 --> 02:11:49,507
The Priory's sacred charge...

1581
02:11:49,674 --> 02:11:52,719
...was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

1582
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:58,892
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1583
02:11:59,059 --> 02:12:02,979
The Priory failed
in their sacred charge.

1584
02:12:03,730 --> 02:12:05,815
So, what choice did I have?

1585
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:11,905
I sought out the enemy.

1586
02:12:13,323 --> 02:12:17,744
I persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that I was an ally.

1587
02:12:18,286 --> 02:12:22,040
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1588
02:12:22,499 --> 02:12:25,502
Rector, I made them call me.

1589
02:12:26,002 --> 02:12:27,045
"Teacher."

1590
02:12:27,212 --> 02:12:28,505
- Why don't you and I...
- No.

1591
02:12:28,672 --> 02:12:31,299
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1592
02:12:31,758 --> 02:12:32,926
Do it.

1593
02:12:33,468 --> 02:12:34,886
No, I mean it. Down.

1594
02:12:35,929 --> 02:12:38,765
Not you. No, my dear, you...

1595
02:12:41,393 --> 02:12:43,853
You're my miracle, Sophie.

1596
02:12:44,437 --> 02:12:46,898
You're the guardian of the Grail.

1597
02:12:47,816 --> 02:12:51,361
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless...

1598
02:12:51,528 --> 02:12:54,447
...of those of different skin,
of women.

1599
02:12:54,614 --> 02:12:57,867
You can put an end to all that.

1600
02:12:58,034 --> 02:13:01,788
You must explode the truth
onto the world.

1601
02:13:02,539 --> 02:13:04,040
It's your duty.

1602
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:09,713
You know the answer to this riddle.

1603
02:13:11,131 --> 02:13:12,674
Open the cryptex...

1604
02:13:14,301 --> 02:13:15,969
...and I'll put down the gun.

1605
02:13:34,154 --> 02:13:36,156
I have no idea how.

1606
02:13:36,323 --> 02:13:38,199
I don't know the code.

1607
02:13:38,366 --> 02:13:41,077
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1608
02:13:46,666 --> 02:13:49,002
Like your grandfather, then.

1609
02:13:49,711 --> 02:13:52,756
Willing to die for your secret.

1610
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:57,385
But by the way you've been
looking at your hero...

1611
02:13:57,552 --> 02:14:02,349
...I wonder, would you
let him die for you?

1612
02:14:02,682 --> 02:14:04,935
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1613
02:14:05,101 --> 02:14:07,229
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

1614
02:14:07,896 --> 02:14:08,939
I don't know how.

1615
02:14:09,105 --> 02:14:11,024
Open it or he dies.

1616
02:14:11,191 --> 02:14:13,151
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

1617
02:14:13,318 --> 02:14:14,653
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

1618
02:14:14,819 --> 02:14:16,196
Stop it!

1619
02:14:21,701 --> 02:14:23,745
She can't do it, Leigh.

1620
02:14:35,757 --> 02:14:37,592
But give me a moment.

1621
02:14:47,727 --> 02:14:49,396
Robert.

1622
02:15:02,534 --> 02:15:03,702
What are you doing?

1623
02:15:04,494 --> 02:15:05,704
Please.

1624
02:16:25,867 --> 02:16:30,372
I'm sorry.

1625
02:16:41,591 --> 02:16:43,051
No!

1626
02:16:51,059 --> 02:16:52,269
No, Robert!

1627
02:16:53,228 --> 02:16:54,521
No!

1628
02:16:55,397 --> 02:16:56,439
No.

1629
02:16:56,856 --> 02:16:59,109
Oh, the map. It's ruined.

1630
02:17:06,533 --> 02:17:08,034
The map is ruined.

1631
02:17:08,910 --> 02:17:10,287
The Grail.

1632
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:12,038
It's lost.

1633
02:17:12,706 --> 02:17:14,207
The Grail is gone.

1634
02:17:14,541 --> 02:17:17,294
Only the worthy
find the Grail, Leigh.

1635
02:17:18,378 --> 02:17:19,963
You taught me that.

1636
02:17:23,466 --> 02:17:24,593
Armed police!

1637
02:17:24,759 --> 02:17:27,137
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1638
02:17:27,387 --> 02:17:32,851
Put the gun down.

1639
02:17:38,648 --> 02:17:41,401
That one. The old man.

1640
02:17:41,568 --> 02:17:42,611
You're under arrest!

1641
02:17:42,777 --> 02:17:45,277
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...

1642
02:17:45,377 --> 02:17:47,183
...if you do not mention,
when questioned...

1643
02:17:47,283 --> 02:17:49,326
...something which you
later rely on in court.

1644
02:17:49,492 --> 02:17:52,162
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1645
02:18:02,839 --> 02:18:05,175
I'll have some questions for you.

1646
02:18:40,543 --> 02:18:43,046
Big crowd out there now.

1647
02:18:43,630 --> 02:18:47,092
Thank you for your statements.
You are free to go, of course.

1648
02:18:56,142 --> 02:18:58,812
I'm sorry. You thought
he was your friend, no?

1649
02:18:59,020 --> 02:19:01,481
It wasn't only us, was it?

1650
02:19:03,108 --> 02:19:04,818
He used you too.

1651
02:19:06,903 --> 02:19:12,659
Leave us, please.

1652
02:19:24,129 --> 02:19:26,715
I should have been smarter.

1653
02:19:26,881 --> 02:19:29,259
I acted on faith, I suppose.

1654
02:19:30,135 --> 02:19:31,511
I'm sorry.

1655
02:19:32,762 --> 02:19:34,389
How many?

1656
02:19:34,556 --> 02:19:37,767
Your grandfather, the other three,
maybe more.

1657
02:19:39,019 --> 02:19:43,523
The monk was given to Teabing
as a gift, it seems.

1658
02:19:44,816 --> 02:19:47,027
To do as he asked.

1659
02:19:47,319 --> 02:19:50,572
Teabing killed the servant himself,
you know.

1660
02:19:50,739 --> 02:19:53,575
- Remy?
- Yes.

1661
02:19:53,742 --> 02:19:54,826
By poison.

1662
02:19:57,579 --> 02:20:00,123
How much of it
have you been able to figure out?

1663
02:20:01,166 --> 02:20:05,045
Some. Not enough for it
to make sense.

1664
02:20:06,129 --> 02:20:07,714
It won't ever make sense.

1665
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:20,310
I'm sorry.

1666
02:20:35,242 --> 02:20:38,328
He forgot everything we've learned.

1667
02:20:38,995 --> 02:20:41,081
Everything we teach.

1668
02:20:44,251 --> 02:20:47,045
It's why we study history.

1669
02:20:47,796 --> 02:20:50,882
So we'll stop killing each other.

1670
02:21:12,946 --> 02:21:16,658
Robert! Robert! Robert!
How could you do it?

1671
02:21:16,825 --> 02:21:19,035
How could you? Robert!

1672
02:21:19,452 --> 02:21:21,788
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1673
02:21:22,122 --> 02:21:25,458
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1674
02:21:25,625 --> 02:21:26,876
How could you?

1675
02:21:31,590 --> 02:21:33,550
You couldn't! You solved it.

1676
02:21:35,969 --> 02:21:39,472
You took the scroll out
before it broke!

1677
02:21:39,639 --> 02:21:43,643
You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert.
You'll find it. You know what to do.

1678
02:21:43,810 --> 02:21:46,104
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her...

1679
02:21:46,271 --> 02:21:48,315
...and you'll set her free
upon the world!

1680
02:21:48,481 --> 02:21:51,943
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

1681
02:22:02,412 --> 02:22:07,334
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one:

1682
02:22:08,251 --> 02:22:12,464
The orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired Newton's life's work.

1683
02:22:12,631 --> 02:22:17,510
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1684
02:22:20,764 --> 02:22:22,265
A- P- P- L- E.

1685
02:22:23,350 --> 02:22:24,643
Apple.

1686
02:22:39,157 --> 02:22:42,160
The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits

1687
02:22:42,327 --> 02:22:44,704
The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates

1688
02:22:44,871 --> 02:22:46,998
Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies

1689
02:22:47,165 --> 02:22:51,044
She rests at last
beneath the starry skies

1690
02:22:52,671 --> 02:22:54,631
I think I know where she's gone.

1691
02:22:55,507 --> 02:22:58,051
I think the Grail has gone home.

1692
02:23:17,904 --> 02:23:22,742
Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.

1693
02:23:22,909 --> 02:23:24,828
Rosslyn Chapel.

1694
02:23:25,912 --> 02:23:27,747
So this is it.

1695
02:23:28,707 --> 02:23:30,584
The gift at the end.

1696
02:23:31,543 --> 02:23:35,297
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."

1697
02:23:36,214 --> 02:23:39,467
You never told me the joke
Saunière made of you.

1698
02:23:39,718 --> 02:23:41,052
What was it?

1699
02:23:41,553 --> 02:23:43,471
He called me a flatfoot.

1700
02:23:43,763 --> 02:23:46,057
A beat cop of history.

1701
02:23:46,766 --> 02:23:48,852
Oh, a dumb policeman...

1702
02:23:49,019 --> 02:23:52,439
...who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1703
02:23:52,606 --> 02:23:56,443
You know, his father was one.
A policeman.

1704
02:23:57,027 --> 02:24:01,781
Saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

1705
02:24:05,619 --> 02:24:08,330
We are who we protect, I think.

1706
02:24:09,247 --> 02:24:10,999
What we stand up for.

1707
02:24:22,886 --> 02:24:24,304
Jewish...

1708
02:24:25,388 --> 02:24:28,141
...Christian, Egyptian...

1709
02:24:29,434 --> 02:24:31,853
...Masonic, pagan...

1710
02:24:32,896 --> 02:24:34,648
...Templar crosses...

1711
02:24:35,232 --> 02:24:36,650
...pyramids.

1712
02:24:44,366 --> 02:24:48,161
I think I've been here before.

1713
02:24:48,328 --> 02:24:49,496
Sophie.

1714
02:25:09,349 --> 02:25:11,101
A very long time ago.

1715
02:25:13,436 --> 02:25:15,230
Come along, Sophie.

1716
02:25:30,453 --> 02:25:31,538
Sophie.

1717
02:25:32,539 --> 02:25:33,707
Over here.

1718
02:25:41,423 --> 02:25:45,051
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates."

1719
02:25:45,385 --> 02:25:47,887
Pagan symbols for
male and female.

1720
02:25:49,848 --> 02:25:51,641
Fused as one.

1721
02:25:52,058 --> 02:25:54,185
As the pagans would have wanted.

1722
02:25:55,770 --> 02:25:57,522
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

1723
02:26:03,737 --> 02:26:06,114
We're just gonna be a moment.

1724
02:26:55,288 --> 02:26:56,623
Robert.

1725
02:27:29,823 --> 02:27:31,658
I've never seen that before.

1726
02:27:36,871 --> 02:27:39,249
The style is...

1727
02:27:40,709 --> 02:27:42,335
It's unmistakable.

1728
02:27:51,553 --> 02:27:53,847
These could have been painted by
Leonardo da Vinci.

1729
02:27:55,974 --> 02:27:59,102
"Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies."

1730
02:27:59,644 --> 02:28:05,483
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."

1731
02:28:24,210 --> 02:28:25,962
The fleur-de-lis.

1732
02:29:17,013 --> 02:29:18,056
She was here.

1733
02:29:21,101 --> 02:29:22,727
Her sarcophagus.

1734
02:29:24,813 --> 02:29:26,439
Mary Magdalene.

1735
02:29:28,108 --> 02:29:30,193
The Holy Grail herself.

1736
02:29:31,736 --> 02:29:33,280
She was here.

1737
02:29:40,495 --> 02:29:44,708
With modern DNA testing,
those bones...

1738
02:29:44,874 --> 02:29:48,420
...could have shown definitive proof
of a bloodline.

1739
02:29:50,589 --> 02:29:52,257
Where did she go?

1740
02:29:53,258 --> 02:29:55,635
Did the Church finally get her?

1741
02:30:10,191 --> 02:30:12,777
This is incredible. Look at this.

1742
02:30:12,944 --> 02:30:16,281
Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.

1743
02:30:17,490 --> 02:30:20,368
They date back
to the death of Christ.

1744
02:30:22,662 --> 02:30:26,041
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1745
02:30:48,063 --> 02:30:52,359
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1746
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:56,071
How was I ever supposed
to figure all this out?

1747
02:30:56,488 --> 02:30:58,907
When you and your
grandfather fought...

1748
02:30:59,074 --> 02:31:01,826
...was it something about your past?

1749
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:05,413
How could you know that?

1750
02:31:06,081 --> 02:31:08,875
About how your parents died?

1751
02:31:09,834 --> 02:31:11,544
Sophie?

1752
02:31:13,755 --> 02:31:16,049
It was during primary school.

1753
02:31:17,592 --> 02:31:19,636
I was in his library.

1754
02:31:21,388 --> 02:31:22,931
Doing research.

1755
02:31:23,098 --> 02:31:25,767
I was trying to find out
about my family.

1756
02:31:25,934 --> 02:31:28,228
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1757
02:31:29,020 --> 02:31:31,356
I wanted to know about them.

1758
02:31:32,023 --> 02:31:34,067
But I couldn't find any records.

1759
02:31:35,193 --> 02:31:37,112
Not of their death...

1760
02:31:38,572 --> 02:31:40,448
...not of the accident.

1761
02:31:41,074 --> 02:31:43,451
I'd asked him for as long
as I could remember...

1762
02:31:43,618 --> 02:31:44,953
...but he would never tell me.

1763
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:46,830
I told you, no.

1764
02:31:49,249 --> 02:31:50,750
But why can't I?

1765
02:31:51,084 --> 02:31:52,919
He stood over me...

1766
02:31:54,629 --> 02:31:56,715
...and he wouldn't let me leave.

1767
02:31:56,881 --> 02:31:58,717
They're dead. Dead and buried.

1768
02:31:59,217 --> 02:32:00,885
Never look for them, Sophie.

1769
02:32:01,136 --> 02:32:02,345
Promise me.

1770
02:32:03,805 --> 02:32:04,931
Swear it!

1771
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:06,766
Swear it to me!

1772
02:32:17,444 --> 02:32:19,446
I kept my promise.

1773
02:32:23,033 --> 02:32:25,869
The next week he sent me
to boarding school.

1774
02:32:27,537 --> 02:32:30,957
One weekend
I came home unexpectedly.

1775
02:32:32,042 --> 02:32:34,878
And what I saw
my grandfather doing...

1776
02:32:35,795 --> 02:32:37,464
Some ritual.

1777
02:32:39,466 --> 02:32:41,051
I was so frightened.

1778
02:32:45,722 --> 02:32:47,933
We hardly ever spoke again.

1779
02:32:51,645 --> 02:32:56,691
Do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident?

1780
02:32:57,734 --> 02:32:59,986
Before your parents were killed?

1781
02:33:00,654 --> 02:33:03,240
Yeah. No. I don't know.

1782
02:33:04,366 --> 02:33:05,492
Why?

1783
02:33:08,245 --> 02:33:10,622
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

1784
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:32,102
These are my parents.

1785
02:33:34,229 --> 02:33:35,605
My brother.

1786
02:33:37,274 --> 02:33:39,067
And this is you, isn't it?

1787
02:33:44,030 --> 02:33:47,742
The paper says
the entire family was killed.

1788
02:33:48,201 --> 02:33:52,080
The mother, the father, the boy, 6...

1789
02:33:53,873 --> 02:33:56,209
...and the girl, 4.

1790
02:33:57,794 --> 02:34:02,382
But your name was never Saunière.
It's Saint-Clair.

1791
02:34:05,802 --> 02:34:08,138
It's one of the oldest families
in France.

1792
02:34:08,805 --> 02:34:12,559
It's from a line of the
Merovingian kings.

1793
02:34:21,151 --> 02:34:22,986
Royal blood.

1794
02:34:24,988 --> 02:34:26,615
I was so wrong.

1795
02:34:28,241 --> 02:34:32,537
Saunière didn't want you to help guard
the secret of the Holy Grail.

1796
02:34:34,247 --> 02:34:35,582
Sophie...

1797
02:34:38,084 --> 02:34:40,253
...you are the secret.

1798
02:34:41,588 --> 02:34:44,090
You survived the accident.

1799
02:34:44,341 --> 02:34:47,010
If it even was an accident.

1800
02:34:47,177 --> 02:34:49,137
The Priory found out.

1801
02:34:49,763 --> 02:34:52,933
Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.

1802
02:34:53,516 --> 02:34:56,853
They hid you with the
Grand Master himself...

1803
02:34:57,354 --> 02:34:59,564
...who raised you as his own.

1804
02:35:00,607 --> 02:35:02,442
According to all of this...

1805
02:35:03,944 --> 02:35:05,612
...Princess Sophie...

1806
02:35:09,324 --> 02:35:10,825
...you are the heir.

1807
02:35:13,119 --> 02:35:15,038
The end of the bloodline.

1808
02:35:16,665 --> 02:35:19,960
You are the last living descendent...

1809
02:35:21,127 --> 02:35:23,004
...of Jesus Christ.

1810
02:36:08,425 --> 02:36:09,801
What is this?

1811
02:36:11,845 --> 02:36:13,096
Sophie?

1812
02:36:16,266 --> 02:36:17,392
Who are you?

1813
02:36:17,559 --> 02:36:20,061
There have been many names.

1814
02:36:20,562 --> 02:36:22,397
The keepers.

1815
02:36:23,231 --> 02:36:24,733
Guardians.

1816
02:36:25,108 --> 02:36:27,402
The Priory of Sion.

1817
02:36:27,736 --> 02:36:33,074
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you:

1818
02:36:33,533 --> 02:36:35,160
Jacques Saunière.

1819
02:36:37,537 --> 02:36:42,876
He would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much.

1820
02:36:43,793 --> 02:36:47,797
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now...

1821
02:36:47,964 --> 02:36:51,176
...as they have always
protected our family.

1822
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:55,847
I gave you up once...

1823
02:36:56,598 --> 02:36:59,684
...knowing I might
never see you again.

1824
02:37:03,104 --> 02:37:05,065
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

1825
02:37:06,233 --> 02:37:11,571
I have prayed for this moment
for a very long time.

1826
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:15,408
Welcome home, child.

1827
02:37:39,432 --> 02:37:40,517
Hey.

1828
02:37:42,978 --> 02:37:44,604
No more strings.

1829
02:37:49,109 --> 02:37:52,529
His last breath to keep me safe.

1830
02:37:56,825 --> 02:38:01,079
She has some things
she wants to tell me.

1831
02:38:01,830 --> 02:38:04,249
About my family.

1832
02:38:10,589 --> 02:38:11,756
What will you do?

1833
02:38:12,841 --> 02:38:16,636
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1834
02:38:17,387 --> 02:38:19,848
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1835
02:38:23,143 --> 02:38:24,895
She said when Saunière died...

1836
02:38:25,061 --> 02:38:28,857
...he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

1837
02:38:29,024 --> 02:38:32,986
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

1838
02:38:35,155 --> 02:38:37,115
What would you do, Robert?

1839
02:38:38,033 --> 02:38:42,329
Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1840
02:38:42,495 --> 02:38:46,750
But, Sophie, the only thing that
matters is what you believe.

1841
02:38:47,709 --> 02:38:50,795
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man...

1842
02:38:50,962 --> 02:38:52,964
...a human inspiration. That's it.

1843
02:38:53,757 --> 02:38:56,509
That's all the evidence
has ever proved.

1844
02:38:58,011 --> 02:38:59,137
But...

1845
02:39:00,055 --> 02:39:01,973
...when I was a boy...

1846
02:39:04,351 --> 02:39:08,855
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about...

1847
02:39:11,399 --> 02:39:14,194
...I thought I was going to die,
Sophie.

1848
02:39:16,154 --> 02:39:17,614
What I did...

1849
02:39:18,323 --> 02:39:19,699
...I prayed.

1850
02:39:21,201 --> 02:39:25,330
I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...

1851
02:39:25,497 --> 02:39:27,249
...so I could see my parents again...

1852
02:39:27,415 --> 02:39:30,043
...so I could go to school again...

1853
02:39:30,418 --> 02:39:32,712
...so I could play with my dog.

1854
02:39:34,089 --> 02:39:37,425
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.

1855
02:39:39,302 --> 02:39:42,055
Why does it have to be
human or divine?

1856
02:39:42,222 --> 02:39:44,182
Maybe human is divine.

1857
02:39:45,433 --> 02:39:47,310
Why couldn't Jesus
have been a father...

1858
02:39:47,477 --> 02:39:50,313
...and still been capable
of all those miracles?

1859
02:39:50,730 --> 02:39:53,275
Like turning water into wine?

1860
02:39:53,650 --> 02:39:57,279
Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.

1861
02:39:57,445 --> 02:40:00,615
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1862
02:40:01,199 --> 02:40:04,244
Maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands.

1863
02:40:04,411 --> 02:40:07,581
And maybe you're
a knight on a Grail quest.

1864
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:13,003
Well, here's the question:

1865
02:40:13,753 --> 02:40:16,464
A living descendent
of Jesus Christ...

1866
02:40:17,966 --> 02:40:20,552
...would she destroy faith?

1867
02:40:21,052 --> 02:40:24,764
Or would she renew it?

1868
02:40:26,558 --> 02:40:29,853
So again I say, what matters
is what you believe.

1869
02:40:32,063 --> 02:40:33,398
Thank you.

1870
02:40:35,483 --> 02:40:36,776
For bringing me here.

1871
02:40:38,945 --> 02:40:41,448
For letting him choose you...

1872
02:40:42,115 --> 02:40:43,366
...Sir Robert.

1873
02:40:53,585 --> 02:40:54,628
You take care.

1874
02:40:56,171 --> 02:40:57,339
Yes.

1875
02:41:21,988 --> 02:41:23,156
Hey.

1876
02:41:36,086 --> 02:41:37,128
Nope.

1877
02:41:38,380 --> 02:41:40,674
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

1878
02:41:44,177 --> 02:41:45,595
Godspeed.

1879
02:42:44,321 --> 02:42:45,655
Bloodline.

1880
02:42:49,159 --> 02:42:50,577
Rose Line.

1881
02:42:57,292 --> 02:42:59,169
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1882
02:44:57,913 --> 02:45:01,541
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits.

1883
02:45:04,586 --> 02:45:08,048
Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies.

1884
02:45:24,064 --> 02:45:27,734
The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates.

1885
02:46:07,190 --> 02:46:11,679
She rests at last
beneath starry skies."
