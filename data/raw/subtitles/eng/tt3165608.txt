1
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:51,968
Yeah, that's it.

2
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,742
<i>I was out there on the road</i>

3
00:01:54,743 --> 00:01:56,810
<i>Life out of control</i>

4
00:01:56,811 --> 00:02:00,343
<i>She became a victim</i>
<i>to my busy schedule</i>

5
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:01,910
<i>And I know that it's not fair</i>

6
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:04,309
<i>That don't mean</i>
<i>that I don't care</i>

7
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,743
<i>This one's dedicated</i>
<i>to the girl out there</i>

8
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,211
- Okay. Good job.
- Thank you.

9
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,911
No.

10
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,907
If I shaved right now...

11
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:19,677
Shave it.

12
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:21,310
No, I'm not doing this, bro.

13
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:23,477
But why the mustache?

14
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:24,844
I wanna feel
I'm grown up, you know.

15
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,343
There's a phase you go
through when you think

16
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:29,610
that the mustache actually
looks good on you.

17
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,609
But, um...

18
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,444
It's delusional. It's just all...
It's all delusional.

19
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,377
Basically this 'stache
is to make me think

20
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:40,375
or feel a little bit older.

21
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:43,745
See, when I can grow a full beard
like that, I'm gonna be rocking.

22
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,278
But this right here,
it's coming.

23
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,577
- So, um...
- You should slate this.

24
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:51,577
Okay, let's slate it.

25
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,212
<i>When you've reached</i>
<i>a certain point in your life,</i>

26
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:03,581
<i>there are people out there</i>
<i>who sit waiting,</i>

27
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,150
<i>wanting to see you fall.</i>

28
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:12,712
<i>But rather than let gravity</i>
<i>take you down,</i>

29
00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:16,917
<i>sometimes you have to take
matters into your own hands...</i>

30
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:22,347
<i>...and fly.</i>

31
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:58,522
<i>Let's go!</i>

32
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,187
<i>What's up, Miami?</i>

33
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,851
<i>How you feeling tonight?</i>

34
00:05:07,852 --> 00:05:11,388
<i>If you're ready to believe,</i>
<i>let's make some noise.</i>

35
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:17,719
<i>You're beautiful, beautiful</i>
<i>you should know it</i>

36
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,451
<i>You're beautiful, beautiful</i>
<i>you should know it</i>

37
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:23,485
<i>I think it's time</i>
<i>Think it's time</i>

38
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:25,219
<i>That you show it</i>

39
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,356
<i>You're beautiful, beautiful</i>

40
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:32,485
<i>Baby, what you doin'?</i>
<i>Where you at, where you at?</i>

41
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:36,153
<i>Why you actin' so shy?</i>
<i>Holdin' back, holdin' back</i>

42
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:37,653

<i>Beyond all the lights</i>

74
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,727
<i>and, you know, the hype
and all the scrutiny</i>

75
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:11,594
<i>and the pressure,</i>
<i>at the end of the day,</i>

76
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:17,229
it comes down to a young man
in a room writing a song.

77
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:20,728
I don't know about you...

78
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,164
<i>That's where it all starts.</i>

79
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:29,728
<i>And with Justin, it starts</i>
<i>with a pad of paper and a pen</i>

80
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:32,427
<i>and a melody in his head that's
probably been there a very long time</i>

81
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,495
<i>and he just needs to get it out.</i>

82
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:37,328
<i>Music is his therapy.</i>

83
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:39,365
<i>Music is his release.</i>

84
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:42,662
<i>If I was your boyfriend...</i>

85
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:43,860
<i>There?</i>

86
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:46,529
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>
<i>I'd never let you go</i>

87
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,228
<i>I can take you places</i>
<i>you ain't never been before</i>

88
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,395
<i>Baby, take a chance</i>
<i>or you'll never ever know</i>

89
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,528
<i>I got money in my hands</i>
<i>that I'd really like to blow</i>

90
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,795
<i>Swag, swag, on you</i>

91
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:58,295
<i>Chillin' by the fire</i>
<i>while we eatin' fondue</i>

92
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:00,694
<i>I don't know about me</i>
<i>but I know about you</i>

93
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:02,832
<i>So say hello to falsetto</i>
<i>in three, two</i>

94
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,362
<i>Let me hear that pass.</i>

95
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:08,121
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

96
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,930
I've known him
for four years now.

97
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,829
And when I met him,
he was just a little kid.

98
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,695
Yeah, man,
yeah, man, yeah. Ready?

99
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:17,596
It'll look like I'm gonna die.
But I'm really not gonna die.

100
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:18,598
Just watch.

101
00:09:21,698 --> 00:09:23,897
- I'm gonna do it again.
- No, no, no. You gotta shower.

102
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,829
- Get in the shower.
- One more time.

103
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,631
Here, you take this.
I gotta go do something.

104
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:30,696
<i>It was just us, you know, in a
van going around the country.</i>

105
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:33,330
<i>And really it started as me,</i>
<i>Ryan, Pattie and Justin.</i>

106
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:34,698
- Last one. Go.
- Ready?

107
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:38,663
Fantastic.

108
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:41,265
<i>Then it went to
the</i> My World <i> tour.</i>

109
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:45,364
And in that tour, he went
from being a kid on a stoop

110
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:47,733
who sang on YouTube to being

111
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:51,200
a worldwide arena veteran.

112
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:57,266
<i>I'd like to be</i>
<i>everything you want</i>

113
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:01,631
<i>Hey, girl, let me talk to you</i>

114
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:06,765
Man, the trials of
being a teenager, period.

115
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:10,166
I mean, it's tumultuous, but,
I mean, you just add on top

116
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:14,633
<i>of being one of the most sought
after young icons of our time.</i>

117
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:17,499
It's like a Pandora's Box.

118
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,532
<i>Justin feels a lot of pressure,</i>

119
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:24,299
a lot of unseen pressure,
to keep outdoing himself.

120
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,866
<i>There's a lot of</i>
<i>expectation on him.</i>

121
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:27,933
<i>You know, part of his childhood</i>

122
00:10:27,934 --> 00:10:30,332
was taken away from him
from working very early on,

123
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,236
and, you know,
he's constantly being judged.

124
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,767
<i>He's in a constant</i>
<i>search for validation</i>

125
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:38,600
<i>'cause everyone's just waiting.</i>

126
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,999
You know, they're constantly
just waiting for it to stop.

127
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:44,234
<i>In a weird way</i>
<i>because of doubts,</i>

128
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:45,993
<i>we keep finding ourselves</i>
<i>the underdog.</i>

129
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:58,333
<i>Hey, what's the situation?</i>

130
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,768
<i>Whoa</i>

131
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,902
<i>I'm just trying to make
a little conversation</i>

132
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:06,201
<i>Why the hesitation?</i>

133
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:07,635
<i>Whoa</i>

134
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:09,568

<i>You know you're right</i>

00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,673
Ever since those videos
on YouTube before <i> One Time.</i>

172
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:02,507
That was us.
We were the comments.

173
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:04,707
I loved him from,
like, the beginning

174
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,607
when he was making
videos on YouTube.

175
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:09,807
And, oh, my gosh, I don't know.
He's just so amazing.

176
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:11,341
He's so hot.

177
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:12,674
The haters are just jealous.

178
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,341
Yeah.
And they don't...

179
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:16,408
I don't think... They just
don't understand his music.

180
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:17,608
They don't.
Yeah, they just think,

181
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:20,575
"Oh, it's Justin Bieber, he's
a guy, we can't like him."

182
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:22,742
But, like, that's not it. He's
a musician, not just a guy.

183
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:24,775
I thought he was cute last year,

184
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,642
but, like, as I'm getting older

185
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:28,942
and as he's getting older,
like, oh, my God,

186
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:30,742
he's just getting
even more cuter every day.

187
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,780
He's an idol for me
and really talented, so...

188
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:46,814
- Pull up that acoustic for me, Brent.
- All right.

189
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,608
<i>You know, we have</i>
<i>different relationships</i>

190
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,210
<i>with different producers,</i>

191
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:53,642
<i>the people that he goes in with
and sees if he vibes with.</i>

192
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:57,476
<i>Mike Posner, Max Martin...</i>

193
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:59,742
- <i> ...Will.i.am.</i>
- Can you feel it in this beat?

194
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:01,509
Okay.
No, that's my heart, girl.

195
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,508
<i>And Rodney Jerkins.</i>

196
00:14:09,377 --> 00:14:11,735
<i>Working with Justin, he'll
play me 20, 30 ideas and say,</i>

197
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:15,476
"No, man, I got ideas. I got
ideas I gotta get out of me."

198
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:17,509
And I thrive off of that
because that just shows me

199
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,844
how much he loves music.

200
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,845
You know, Rodney Jerkins,
that's like Michael Jackson,

201
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:33,744
that's Mariah Carey.

202
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:35,878
Like those are,
like, the top of the top.

203
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,347
<i>Like, Rodney Jerkins,</i>
<i>he's a legend.</i>

204
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:43,646
<i>They start working and
Rodney just has this beat.</i>

205
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:46,550
<i>And he's hitting the drums</i>
<i>and he's hitting the piano.</i>

206
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:52,845
<i>He's going back and forth</i>
<i>with the drums and the piano,</i>

207
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:54,878
<i>and Justin's vibing out
and then Justin starts,</i>

208
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,546
<i>"Can I try something?</i>
<i>Can I try something?"</i>

209
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,548
<i>And Rodney's like,</i>
<i>"Go, go, go."</i>

210
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,412
<i>And then Justin starts trying to
figure out hooks and melodies,</i>

211
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:09,412
<i>and then Rodney's doing</i>
<i>his hooks and his melodies.</i>

212
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:12,914
<i>And then it just kept growing
and growing and growing.</i>

213
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:17,783
<i>We have a responsibility
to our journey.</i>

214
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:18,950
<i>Even though</i>
<i>you're singing a song</i>

215
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:21,750
<i>and it's about</i>
<i>your situation in your life,</i>

216
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:23,682
<i>you're singing it for
everyone else to connect to.</i>

217
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,183
So what you're
going through, tell it,

218
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,883
tell the story,
make it come to life,

219
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:29,849
<i>'cause that's what it's about.</i>

220
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,517
Just take them
on this crazy journey.

221
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:34,651
To get them second-guessing

222
00:16:34,652 --> 00:16:36,550
and be like, "I already know
how the song's gonna end,"

223
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:38,517
then boom, you smack them in
the face with a Filet-O-Fish,

224
00:16:38,518 --> 00:16:39,883
you know what I'm saying,

225
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:41,583
you get white stuff all up
the side of their head.

226
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,417
So, like, that's what you wanna
do, you know what I'm saying,

227
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:45,656
'cause they think you're hitting
them with French fries.

228
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:51,816
A lot of times,
he kinda just starts rapping,

229
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:53,884
and he'll just start rapping
his verses.

230
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:55,652
And then the verses will
start coming onto the songs.

231
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,718
<i>Take it slow, girl</i>

232
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,751
<i>'Cause things get...</i>
<i>No, girl</i>

233
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,318
<i>'Cause things get crazy
up on that road</i>

234
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,350
<i>He'll get a track and then</i>
<i>he'll start getting an idea.</i>

235
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:08,419
<i>He'll write down a little bit</i>
<i>or write it down on his phone</i>

236
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,419
<i>in his notepad.</i>

237
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,555
<i>Hey, you are the one thing</i>

238
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:17,951
<i>It would be that I just...</i>

239
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,586
And then go into, like...

240
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:25,319
<i>I... I... I want,</i>
<i>want, want you, you, you</i>

241
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,220
<i>And then he'll</i>
<i>go back on it again</i>

242
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:28,899
<i>and he'll start putting
more words to it.</i>

243
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,720
<i>I want you, you, you</i>

244
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:40,620
<i>I want you, you, you</i>

245
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:43,920
<i>I want you, you, you</i>

246
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:45,223
Okay. I just...

247
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:54,422
<i>Don't let it get in the way</i>

248
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:57,290
<i>Let's take it easy</i>

249
00:17:58,289 --> 00:17:59,555
<i>Oh, oh</i>

250
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:03,288
<i>Don't let it get in the way</i>

251
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,788
You know, it just
naturally kinda happened.

252
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,421
You know, the song
started flowing and...

253
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,354
<i>And the kids have been waiting
for</i> Believe <i> for so long.</i>

254
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:14,421
<i>We revved up the first single, and all
they know is the name is</i> "Boyfriend."

255
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:16,489
- I can just guess how it goes.
- How does it go?

256
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,422
<i>If I was your boyfriend...</i>

257
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:19,354
That's exactly how it...

258
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:20,488
<i>Never let you go</i>

259
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:21,921
That's exactly how it goes.

260
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:23,789
<i>Ever, ever, ever let you go</i>

261
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,955
That's exactly...

262
00:18:24,956 --> 00:18:26,388
<i>Girl</i>

263
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:27,888
How did you know that?

264
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:29,727
I'm just guessing that
that's how it would go.

265
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:34,923
<i>I worked on</i>
<i>the record</i> Boyfriend,

266
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:37,490
<i>and originally</i>
<i>the song was gonna be called</i>

267
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:41,689
<i>"Inside of Your Bedroom,"</i>
and I always hated that.

268
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,756
<i>Then we were in the studio with
Justin and, like, really hit a wall.</i>

269
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,823
Like, what can we say
instead of that?

270
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:51,657
<i>Finally we came up with,
"If I was your boyfriend."</i>

271
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:53,423
And I loved that.
I knew that was it.

272
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,323
Let's do this!

273
00:18:55,324 --> 00:18:57,082
<i>And we're just in</i>
<i>full-on countdown mode.</i>

274
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:03,390
<i>One day, 12 hours,</i>
<i>six hours, 30 minutes,</i>

275
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:05,029
<i>seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.</i>

276
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:08,457
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>
<i>I'd never let you go</i>

277
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,891
<i>I can take you places</i>
<i>you ain't never been before</i>

278
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:13,257
<i>Baby, take a chance</i>
<i>or you'll never ever know</i>

279
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:15,491
<i>I got money in my hands</i>
<i>that I'd really like to blow</i>

280
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:18,258
<i>Swag, swag, swag, on you</i>

281
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,624
<i>Chillin' by the fire</i>
<i>while we eatin' fondue</i>

282
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,890
<i>I don't know about me</i>
<i>but I know about you</i>

283
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:24,425
<i>So say hello to falsetto</i>

284
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:26,392
<i>In three, two...</i>

285
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:31,257
<i>I'd like to be</i>
<i>everything you want</i>

286
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:34,524
<i>Hey, girl, let me talk to you</i>

287
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:39,259
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

288
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,928
<i>Keep you on my arm, girl
You'd never be alone</i>

289
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:46,493
<i>I can be a gentleman</i>

290
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,660
- Your new song, that's pretty sexy.
- Oh, you like it?

291
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:50,459
I tell everybody that you're
not the Biebs anymore, man,

292
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,093
you are Mr. Bieber.

293
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:54,959
<i>Tell me about picking</i> Boyfriend
<i>as your first single.</i>

294
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,393
<i>I feel like every single that's
dropping is like this...</i>

295
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:58,660
<i>Right, right.</i>

296
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:00,094
<i>So I wanted to do</i>
<i>something a little different,</i>

297
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:03,227
<i>slow it down, something a
little bit more mature.</i>

298
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:06,660
When the faders are up and you
pull all that music down,

299
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,860
and all you have is that vocal,

300
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:13,526
if it's a hit then,
then it'll be a hit always.

301
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:14,694
<i>People absolutely</i>
<i>love the record.</i>

302
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:17,327
<i>It debuted number one
on the Billboard charts,</i>

303
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:22,428
and everyone really received
how his voice had matured.

304
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,793
<i>Let me talk to you</i>

305
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:28,627
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

306
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:33,695
<i>Keep you on my arm, girl
You'd never be alone</i>

307
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:38,595
<i>I can be a gentleman</i>
<i>anything you want</i>

308
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:42,264
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

309
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:45,301
<i>Never let you go</i>

310
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:50,333
<i>Yeah, girl</i>

311
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,332
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>

312
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,529
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>

313
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:10,630
<i>There was so much talk about
what you were going to do next.</i>

314
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:12,430
<i>I mean, everybody
in the music business,</i>

315
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:15,729
<i>everybody in the world</i>
<i>had an opinion about it.</i>

316
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,797
<i>Did you listen to all that?</i>

317
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:19,230
<i>Did you shut the door and say,</i>

318
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:20,463
<i>"You know what, I'm not
gonna hear any of them,</i>

319
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:21,896
<i>"I'm just gonna focus</i>
<i>on what's inside of me?"</i>

320
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:25,930
<i>I'm the only one who can
ultimately make those decisions</i>

321
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:28,797
<i>because, like, I'm gonna have to live
with my career for the rest of my life,</i>

322
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:30,397
<i>so I have to make</i>
<i>those decisions,</i>

323
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:32,632
<i>where I want my career to go.</i>

324
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,730
So she was sleeping and I was
waiting till, like 12:00 a.m.,

325
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:45,464
like, for when it
was released on iTunes.

326
00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:47,464
And right when it was released,
I called her and I was like,

327
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:49,398
"We have to buy it.
We have to buy it right now."

328
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:50,831
So we bought it
and we just listened to it

329
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:52,666
together on the phone,
like, the whole time.

330
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:57,592
<i>Justin Bieber's album</i> Believe

331
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,079
<i>scored the number one spot</i>
<i>on the Billboard 200 Chart,</i>

332
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,637
<i>selling 374,000 copies</i>
<i>in the first week.</i>

333
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:11,232
It was about making music
that was real to him,

334
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:13,466
but that was also
real to the fans.

335
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,466
You know, it had to
connect emotionally.

336
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,600
We were on the phone together

337
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,933
and we were both crying
listening to <i> Be Alright,</i>

338
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:19,266
and we're like,
"This is the best song."

339
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:20,465
Best song ever.

340
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:21,799
<i>As Long As You Love Me,</i>
it's definitely the best.

341
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,799
Yeah.

342
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,605
<i>Thought of You,</i> I love that song.
That's a personal favorite.

343
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,980
Oh, my God, that's his bus.

344
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:48,568
<i>I'm psyched to play it on the radio.
This is a massive, monster hit.</i>

345
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:49,868
<i>It feels good.</i>

346
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,267
<i>Girl, I'm in love</i>
<i>with the thought of you</i>

347
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:55,601
<i>The album was out.</i>
<i>It's number one.</i>

348
00:22:55,602 --> 00:22:59,367
But at the end of the day, Justin
wants to be known as an entertainer.

349
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:01,602
<i>You wanna be one of those artists
that every generation waits</i>

350
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:03,201
<i>for that concert
to come to town.</i>

351
00:23:03,202 --> 00:23:06,569
<i>And we needed someone that
Justin really trusted creatively</i>

352
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,769
to direct our tour.

353
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,935
<i>That person was</i>
<i>shooting a movie.</i>

354
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:14,634
One morning I got a call
from Scooter, and he said,

355
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:17,969
<i>"You know, last time you did a
little enhancement on his show.</i>

356
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,769
"What if this time you got it
from the ground up

357
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,236
"where there is
no show right now

358
00:23:22,237 --> 00:23:24,476
<i>"and you would work with
Justin to create the show?"</i>

359
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,869
And we were going to force him

360
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,869
<i>one way or another</i>
<i>to commit to us.</i>

361
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,536
Justin called me and Scooter
kept calling me and...

362
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,570
Me and Justin had a plan.

363
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:36,303
And I said, "Hey, me and
Justin are over here,

364
00:23:36,304 --> 00:23:38,302
"we're hanging out,
come over and see us."

365
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:40,737
I'm, I'm hanging out right now.

366
00:23:40,738 --> 00:23:42,873
And, I have my friend
Nick DeMoura here.

367
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,970
Hello.

368
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:47,771
And we have
a special announcement.

369
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:50,971
Um, Tom is back,
our production manager.

370
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:54,404
And, um, uh... Oh, oh,
this is Justin Bieber.

371
00:23:54,405 --> 00:23:56,837
What's up, everybody?
I'm Justin.

372
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:59,837
And as soon as he got there, Justin
and I just completely cornered him.

373
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,337
They said, "You're not
leaving this house

374
00:24:01,338 --> 00:24:03,572
"until you agree
to do this show."

375
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:04,872
And, Justin, we have
a special announcement

376
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:06,737
- about the <i> Believe</i> tour.
- What is it?

377
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,297
Well, I think
someone's just joining on

378
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:10,939
officially to come and help
us creatively direct it.

379
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,239
No, really?

380
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,371
Yeah, yeah,
to creatively direct it.

381
00:24:13,372 --> 00:24:14,838
- No. Who did?
- Who did what?

382
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,938
- Why don't you sit down over there.
- Maybe it's Jon Chu.

383
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,505
- Jonathan M. Chu.
- Hello.

384
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:20,271
What's up, everybody?

385
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:23,206
And then Justin was like, "So
are you in or are you not?"

386
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:24,527
I said, "Well, I don't know yet.

387
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:25,473
"I gotta figure out my schedule.

388
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:27,505
"I gotta see
your guys' schedule."

389
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:29,472
He's like, "Jon, you're not leaving
this until you say you're in."

390
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:32,541
Jon has a problem
saying no to Justin.

391
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,473
Oh, my God.

392
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:51,575
Can I open this one now?

393
00:24:57,774 --> 00:24:59,772
What do you got?

394
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,242
She's crying
with tears of joy, right?

395
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,240
Let me see.

396
00:25:14,374 --> 00:25:16,477
Tears of joy.

397
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,511
Oh, my God.

398
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,975
Catherine, let me see.

399
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:26,277
- Live Justin Bieber tickets.
- What is it?

400
00:25:38,743 --> 00:25:40,709
<i>Say you love me</i>

401
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,942
<i>As much as I love you, yeah</i>

402
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:47,209
<i>Would you hurt me, baby?</i>

403
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,710
<i>Could you do that to me, yeah?</i>

404
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:52,742
<i>Would you lie to me, baby?</i>

405
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:55,310
<i>'Cause the truth hurts</i>
<i>so much more</i>

406
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:57,579
<i>Would you do the things
that drive me crazy?</i>

407
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:00,910
<i>Leave my heart</i>
<i>still at the door?</i>

408
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:03,777
<i>Oh, I can't help it</i>
<i>I'm just selfish</i>

409
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:06,776
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>that I could share you</i>

410
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:09,410
<i>That would break</i>
<i>my heart to pieces</i>

411
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:11,543
<i>Honestly the truth is</i>

412
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:14,713
<i>If I could just die in your arms</i>

413
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:19,844
<i>I wouldn't mind</i>

414
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,477
<i>'Cause every time you touch me</i>

415
00:26:22,478 --> 00:26:27,445
<i>I just die in your arms</i>

416
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:30,978
<i>Ooh, it feels so right</i>

417
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:33,315
<i>So, baby, baby,
please don't stop, girl</i>

418
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:36,916
<i>Music is
what brings us together.</i>

419
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:43,478
<i>I can't tell you how many friends
I've made because of music.</i>

420
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:45,911
<i>Oh, if there is a reason...</i>

421
00:26:45,912 --> 00:26:47,513
<i>Music is a universal language</i>

422
00:26:47,514 --> 00:26:49,945
that could describe
any moment in life.

423
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:51,379
<i>I hear a certain song,</i>

424
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,412
<i>it reminds me of my first
heartbreak, first love.</i>

425
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,880
<i>As any human being,</i>
<i>you've heard a song</i>

426
00:26:57,881 --> 00:27:00,913
and it catches you
and it's a visceral reaction.

427
00:27:00,914 --> 00:27:03,379
<i>Your mind isn't doing
any work, but your gut,</i>

428
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,645
<i>your heart, your soul,</i>
<i>whatever you wanna call it,</i>

429
00:27:05,646 --> 00:27:06,713
<i>it feels it.</i>

430
00:27:06,714 --> 00:27:08,514
<i>Oh, I can't help it</i>
<i>I'm just selfish</i>

431
00:27:09,514 --> 00:27:11,515
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>that I could share you</i>

432
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:14,813
<i>That would break</i>
<i>my heart to pieces</i>

433
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:17,313
<i>Honestly the truth is</i>

434
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:18,833
<i>If I could just</i>
<i>die in your arms...</i>

435
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:22,279
<i>I love music.</i>
<i>I love making music.</i>

436
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,314
I like making music that
travels all around the world.

437
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:27,947
<i>And people are all in</i>
<i>different countries,</i>

438
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:31,248
<i>Mexico, London, France,
all over the world</i>

439
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,814
<i>are singing the lyrics.</i>

440
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:34,582
<i>They might not even</i>
<i>know how to speak English,</i>

441
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,980
but they're singing
those lyrics.

442
00:27:36,981 --> 00:27:38,417
That's what it's about.

443
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:44,756
<i>If I could die...</i>

444
00:27:56,815 --> 00:27:58,853
<i>Don't stop, baby, no</i>

445
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:05,382
<i>It's what you do to me</i>

446
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:08,418
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

447
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:22,916
<i>Have you been in love?</i>

448
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,417
Have I been...
Of course I've been in love.

449
00:28:25,418 --> 00:28:29,352
Um, I think being in love is
the most powerful thing ever.

450
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:33,683
It's an extreme feeling,
being in love.

451
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:35,585
Have you ever had heartbreak?

452
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:39,484
Yes, yes, definitely.

453
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:41,617
That's...

454
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:44,421
That's even, I would say, it's
about just the same feeling.

455
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:48,519
As much as it is
to fall in love,

456
00:28:49,518 --> 00:28:50,919
like, in that...

457
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:54,550
It's that explosiveness,
that fire,

458
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:58,353
just when you break up from that,
if you give them everything,

459
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:01,487
and you break up
from that, you're...

460
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:04,818
It's the same type...

461
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:07,819
It's like that
clenching feeling like...

462
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,819
Oh, like, when you...
This is my feeling.

463
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,418
Like, "Oh, I love her
so much."

464
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,988
But then that's the same feeling
when we break up, it's like,

465
00:29:16,987 --> 00:29:20,285
"Oh, like, this hurts.
This hurts so deep."

466
00:29:20,286 --> 00:29:23,221
It's just the same emotion,
but, uh, flipped backwards.

467
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,856
<i>I'm here at Justin Bieber's
world tour audition.</i>

468
00:30:29,857 --> 00:30:31,289
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>he's using girls,</i>

469
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:36,555
so I feel pretty honored to hopefully
be one of the first to do that.

470
00:30:36,556 --> 00:30:41,856
<i>Over there are a bunch of lovely
ladies fighting for the gig.</i>

471
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:44,655
<i>And there's limited spots,</i>
<i>so it's pretty nerve-racking</i>

472
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:46,257
<i>standing next to a good friend</i>

473
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,423
<i>and knowing that one of you may
make it, and one of you may not.</i>

474
00:30:48,424 --> 00:30:52,523
Move, cha, pa, boom, boom, hold!
Move, ba, da, da, hold.

475
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:54,825
Pop, pop, shoo, pop, pop,
pop, pop, pop, hold.

476
00:31:04,225 --> 00:31:05,224
Let's go!

477
00:31:06,358 --> 00:31:07,990
Let's go!

478
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,426
Five, six... Eight.

479
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,824
Hold... Whoa!

480
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:23,924
This is something that has
been itching on the inside.

481
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,757
Like, I've never really
been on a tour before.

482
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:29,659
And this would be
such a dream come true.

483
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,725
<i>I'm getting older</i>
<i>and I feel like</i>

484
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:32,693
<i>if there's one time to do it,</i>

485
00:31:32,694 --> 00:31:34,491
<i>if there's one moment to have,</i>

486
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,893
it'd be this one here.

487
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,693
Here we go.
Let's get cracking.

488
00:31:54,394 --> 00:31:57,371
Justin just came in. Yeah,
so no pressure, you know.

489
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:09,959
I just was, like, so in there. I
was like, "I want this so bad."

490
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:15,627
<i>So I was really nervous,</i>

491
00:32:15,628 --> 00:32:17,796
<i>but I worked so hard</i>
<i>at that audition.</i>

492
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:37,995
<i>I was fortunate enough
to work with him before</i>

493
00:32:37,996 --> 00:32:40,329
on the promo tour,
and I see how he works

494
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,928
and how dedicated he is

495
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,729
<i>and how involved he</i>
<i>is with his music.</i>

496
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,561
<i>It's not people just
telling him what to do.</i>

497
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:47,394
<i>It's really coming from him.</i>

498
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:49,896
<i>So it'd be such an honor</i>
<i>to be a part of his growth</i>

499
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:52,263
<i>and watch his journey.</i>

500
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,530
<i>Here, brother.</i>

501
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:56,697
Hey, CJ. It's, uh, Jon Chu.

502
00:32:56,698 --> 00:32:58,863
Most jobs, you don't get a
personal call like that.

503
00:32:58,864 --> 00:33:00,729
So when that happened,
it really, like,

504
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,496
I really feel like
I earned my spot.

505
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:15,364
I remember your exact words.
You were like...

506
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:17,365
You got the job.
You're going on the tour.

507
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:19,564
<i>Are you serious?</i>

508
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:20,831
I was, like, screaming.

509
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,798
I was like, uh, just tears.

510
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,330
<i>I'm so excited</i>
<i>to work with you, Jon.</i>

511
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:26,396
<i>- I'm so excited.</i>
- Me, too.

512
00:33:26,397 --> 00:33:29,663
And then that moment that
it became ours, it was,

513
00:33:29,664 --> 00:33:32,399
I mean, yeah,
completely indescribable.

514
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,298
I think he just started crying.

515
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,298
I think he was crying.

516
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,865
We made him cry, yes.

517
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:49,365
<i>- Make your dreams come true
- True</i>

518
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:51,299
<i>Miami...</i>

519
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,564
<i>I need you to put</i>
<i>your hands in the air,</i>

520
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,308
<i>right now, hands up!</i>

521
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,701
<i>Show you off</i>

522
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,367
<i>Tonight I wanna show you off</i>

523
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:14,366
<i>What you got</i>

524
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:15,805
<i>A billion could've never bought</i>

525
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:23,333
<i>We gonna party</i>
<i>like it's 3012 tonight</i>

526
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:26,866
<i>I wanna show you</i>
<i>all the finer things in life</i>

527
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:28,933
<i>So just forget about the world</i>

528
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,801
<i>We're young tonight</i>

529
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,334
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>

530
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:38,003
<i>'Cause all I need</i>

531
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:42,701
<i>Is a beauty and a beat</i>

532
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:44,835
<i>Who can make my life complete</i>

533
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:46,470
<i>Once again, Miami,
hands up right now.</i>

534
00:34:48,468 --> 00:34:49,500
<i>Let's go.</i>

535
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:52,434
<i>It's all about you</i>

536
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:54,235
<i>Hands up.</i>

537
00:34:54,236 --> 00:34:56,670
<i>When the music makes you move</i>

538
00:34:57,669 --> 00:35:01,572
<i>Baby, do it like you do...</i>

539
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,302
<i>We had about eight or 12 weeks
to put this show together.</i>

540
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:10,768
<i>We had to build custom sets</i>
<i>and design the costumes</i>

541
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:12,668
<i>and the music.
In the middle of it all,</i>

542
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:14,135
<i>Scooter and Justin</i>
<i>came to me, they're like,</i>

543
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:17,401
"Hey, we're gonna shoot this music
video for <i> Beauty and A Beat."</i>

544
00:35:17,402 --> 00:35:19,269
"Oh, that's great,
have fun."

545
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,569
<i>Scooter said, "I don't
think you understand.</i>

546
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,704
<i>"We'd really love it if you
were to help Justin direct it."</i>

547
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:28,737
I said, "What?"

548
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:30,403
<i>All right.</i>
<i>No peeing in the water.</i>

549
00:35:30,404 --> 00:35:32,908
So five, six, seven, eight.

550
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,569
One more time, sorry.

551
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:43,875
One, two, three, four.

552
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:50,504
It's all in his hands
'cause he's the one

553
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:52,471
<i>who's holding the camera,</i>
<i>shooting the thing,</i>

554
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:53,805
<i>directing the thing.</i>

555
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:55,771
<i>And he's dancing
in between all of that.</i>

556
00:35:55,772 --> 00:35:57,270
<i>Yes.</i>

557
00:35:57,271 --> 00:35:58,304
<i>And we have, like, 50 dancers,</i>

558
00:35:58,305 --> 00:35:59,738
<i>synchronized swimmers</i>
<i>on the side,</i>

559
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:01,471
<i>people flipping into the water.</i>

560
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:04,972
<i>We gonna party</i>
<i>like it's 3012 tonight</i>

561
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:08,770
<i>I wanna show you</i>
<i>all the finer things in life</i>

562
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:10,771
<i>So just forget about the world</i>

563
00:36:10,772 --> 00:36:12,671
<i>We're young tonight</i>

564
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,605
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>

565
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:16,605
<i>'Cause all...</i>

566
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,705
Nicki Minaj will be there.

567
00:36:18,706 --> 00:36:19,938
We're gonna throw her
in the water.

568
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:21,205
Uh, I'm just kidding.

569
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:23,913
I wanna know how Nicki Minaj
is gonna get on that platform.

570
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,839
I feel like there's a lot of things
we haven't thought about yet.

571
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,607
We should probably
harness her in somehow.

572
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:36,006
- Just lift her.
- Yeah.

573
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:38,440
<i>When the music makes you move</i>

574
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:42,576
<i>Baby, do it like you do</i>

575
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:46,474
<i>In time, ink lines</i>

576
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:48,306
<i>Bitches couldn't get</i>
<i>on my incline</i>

577
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:50,307
<i>World tours, it's mine</i>

578
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,907
<i>Ten little letters on a big sign</i>

579
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:55,674
<i>Justin Bieber, you know</i>
<i>I'mma hit 'em with the ether</i>

580
00:36:55,675 --> 00:36:57,574
<i>Buns out, wiener</i>

581
00:36:57,575 --> 00:36:59,574
<i>But I gotta keep</i>
<i>an eye out for Selena</i>

582
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:00,674
<i>Beauty, beauty and the beast</i>

583
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:01,740
<i>Beauty from the east</i>

584
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:03,407
<i>Beautiful confessions</i>
<i>of the priest</i>

585
00:37:03,408 --> 00:37:04,674
<i>Beast, beauty from the streets</i>

586
00:37:04,675 --> 00:37:05,673
<i>We don't get deceased</i>

587
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:07,342
<i>Every time a beauty on the beats</i>

588
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:09,607
<i>Body rock, oh</i>

589
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:12,907
<i>I wanna feel your body rock</i>

590
00:37:12,908 --> 00:37:14,474
<i>Raise your hands up, let's go.</i>

591
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:15,677
<i>'Cause all</i>

592
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:22,310
<i>I need is a beauty and a beat</i>

593
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:26,677
<i>Who can make my life complete</i>

594
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:29,674
<i>'Cause...</i>

595
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:46,876
Here he comes,
here he comes. Yeah.

596
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:54,310
<i>And everyone's</i>
<i>cheering at the end.</i>

597
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:56,344
<i>That is true, true joy</i>

598
00:37:56,345 --> 00:37:59,377
because everyone's
so tired and excited

599
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,477
<i>that Justin got to direct</i>
<i>his first music video.</i>

600
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:02,977
That's awesome.

601
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:07,973
<i>Justin Bieber.</i>

602
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:30,812
Yeah!

603
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:41,986
Oh, my God.

604
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:51,746
- Hannah?
- Hey, that's enough.

605
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,982
You got me tickets
to Justin Bieber!

606
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:57,546
Okay. That's enough.

607
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:12,847
<i>When I start choreographing,</i>

608
00:39:12,848 --> 00:39:15,417
<i>I just try to hear
what the song is about.</i>

609
00:39:17,196 --> 00:39:19,713
<i>I try not to, like, control the
song, what I want it to do.</i>

610
00:39:19,714 --> 00:39:21,547
The song was there before I was,

611
00:39:21,548 --> 00:39:22,948
<i>so I let it move me.</i>

612
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:25,715
<i>I try to, like, show you what</i>
<i>the song should look like.</i>

613
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:40,482
This show is crazy.
We rehearsed, you know,

614
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:42,616
12-hour days, you know, for
about two months straight

615
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:43,616
<i>with Justin.</i>

616
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,651
Hey, not like that.

617
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,315
- Zoop. Zoop.
- Yeah!

618
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:52,414
- All right. I'm good.
- Zoop, yeah.

619
00:39:52,415 --> 00:39:54,413
Hoorah, baby.

620
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,915
I think the hardest
part was taking it

621
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:01,415
from the dance studio
to the actual set,

622
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:04,550
<i>and the actual toaster lifts</i>
<i>and the actual fly gags</i>

623
00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:06,649
<i>and timing-wise and
transitioning everything,</i>

624
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,682
<i>I think that was</i>
<i>the hardest part.</i>

625
00:40:08,683 --> 00:40:09,983
And I'm going up
while this is playing?

626
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,582
<i>Justin, he had a lot more input.</i>

627
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,850
<i>Here he had his own ideas</i>
<i>he wanted to contribute,</i>

628
00:40:14,851 --> 00:40:17,515
so it's a lot more of him
giving himself to his fans,

629
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,634
um, which makes the show
a lot more personal to him.

630
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:27,684
Being young and in the industry,

631
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:30,720
there's a lot of things that
people tell you to say, right?

632
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:32,751
The music that I'm making now,

633
00:40:32,752 --> 00:40:34,517
it's all creatively
coming from me,

634
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:35,951
and I wanna do what I want.

635
00:40:35,952 --> 00:40:38,818
Like, if I'm not happy
with what I wanna do

636
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:40,987
and who I wanna be, then who...

637
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:45,586
I'm not gonna be happy.

638
00:40:46,585 --> 00:40:48,852
<i>We talked a lot about</i>
<i>what does this album mean.</i>

639
00:40:48,853 --> 00:40:51,485
And he says, "You know what, a
lot of people want me to fail."

640
00:40:51,486 --> 00:40:52,585
But he's like,
"That doesn't bother me.

641
00:40:52,586 --> 00:40:54,585
<i>"'Cause no matter what,
my fans are there</i>

642
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:55,986
<i>"and they'll make me fly."</i>

643
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,651
And that really triggered,
in my mind, like,

644
00:40:57,652 --> 00:40:59,212
"All right, we're gonna
make you fly."

645
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:02,386
<i>You're gonna come in</i>
<i>and you're gonna fly.</i>

646
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:04,785
<i>With the cheers of your audience,
they're gonna keep you up,</i>

647
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:08,852
<i>and you're gonna fly in on wings made of
instruments because it's your talent.</i>

648
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:10,519
<i>And instruments,</i>
<i>not just random instruments,</i>

649
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,985
<i>but instruments that you play.</i>

650
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:13,819
<i>So we have drums.</i>
<i>We have keyboards.</i>

651
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,853
<i>We have all these things
that he plays</i>

652
00:41:15,854 --> 00:41:17,987
<i>built into these wings</i>
<i>to symbolize</i>

653
00:41:17,988 --> 00:41:20,653
<i>that he's built of</i>
<i>many, many parts.</i>

654
00:41:20,654 --> 00:41:22,853
<i>That's what makes him</i>
<i>Justin Bieber.</i>

655
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:28,959
<i>As long as you love me</i>

656
00:41:33,955 --> 00:41:36,520
<i>As long as you love me</i>

657
00:41:36,521 --> 00:41:38,654
<i>We're under pressure</i>

658
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:42,322
<i>Seven billion people in the
world trying to fit in</i>

659
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:45,520
<i>Keep it together</i>

660
00:41:45,521 --> 00:41:49,721
<i>Smile on your face even</i>
<i>though your heart is frowning</i>

661
00:41:49,722 --> 00:41:52,987
<i>But hey now, you know, girl</i>

662
00:41:52,988 --> 00:41:56,555
<i>We both know it's a cruel world</i>

663
00:41:56,556 --> 00:42:00,523
<i>But I will take my chances</i>

664
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:02,657
<i>As long as you love me</i>

665
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:06,788
<i>We could be starving</i>
<i>We could be homeless</i>

666
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:08,588
<i>We could be broke</i>

667

<i>As long as you love me</i>

668
00:42:10,556 --> 00:42:13,622
<i>I'll be your platinum</i>
<i>I'll be your silver</i>

669
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:15,456

672
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:29,827
<i>Love me</i>

673
00:42:32,824 --> 00:42:35,322
<i>I'll be your soldier</i>

674
00:42:35,323 --> 00:42:37,489
<i>Fighting every second of the day</i>

675
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,456
<i>For your dreams, girl</i>

676
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:41,990
<i>I'll be your Hova</i>

677
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:44,323
<i>You could be my Destiny's Child</i>

678
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:46,422
<i>On the scene, girl</i>

679
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:47,890
<i>But don't stress</i>

680
00:42:47,891 --> 00:42:49,458
<i>And don't cry</i>

681
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:53,324
<i>No, we don't need</i>
<i>no wings to fly</i>

682
00:42:53,325 --> 00:42:57,393
<i>Just take my hand</i>

683
00:42:58,392 --> 00:42:59,957
<i>As long as you love me</i>

684
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:03,558
<i>We could be starving</i>
<i>We could be homeless</i>

<i>Yo, B-I-G</i>

692
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,826
<i>I don't know if this makes sense</i>

693
00:43:28,827 --> 00:43:31,658
<i>But you're my hallelujah</i>

694
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:33,591
<i>Give me a time and place,</i>
<i>I'll rendezvous it</i>

695
00:43:33,592 --> 00:43:35,360
<i>I'll fly you to it,</i>
<i>I'll beat you there</i>

696
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:36,825
<i>Girl, you know I got you</i>

697
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:37,825
<i>Us, trust...</i>

698
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:40,326
<i>A couple of things</i>
<i>I can't spell without "u"</i>

699
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,627
<i>Now we are on top of the world</i>

700
00:43:41,628 --> 00:43:43,426
<i>'Cause that's just how we do</i>

701
00:43:43,427 --> 00:43:44,892
<i>Used to tell me sky's the limit</i>

702
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:46,827
<i>Now the sky's our point of view</i>

703
00:43:46,828 --> 00:43:48,827
<i>We'll be stepping out like, whoa</i>

704
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:50,426
<i>Cameras point and shoot</i>

705
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,860
<i>Ask me what's my best side</i>

706
00:43:51,861 --> 00:43:53,892
<i>I stand back and point at you</i>

707
00:43:53,893 --> 00:43:55,326
<i>You, you the one</i>
<i>that I argue with</i>

708
00:43:55,327 --> 00:43:57,493
<i>I feel like I need a new
girl to be bothered with</i>

709
00:43:57,494 --> 00:43:59,561
<i>But the grass ain't always
greener on the other side</i>

710
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:00,827
<i>It's green where you water it</i>

711
00:44:00,828 --> 00:44:02,493
<i>So I know we got issues, baby</i>

712
00:44:02,494 --> 00:44:03,894
<i>True, true, true</i>

713
00:44:03,895 --> 00:44:05,454
<i>But I'd rather work</i>
<i>on this with you</i>

714
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:07,327
<i>Than to go ahead
and start with someone new</i>

715
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:08,761
<i>As long as you love me</i>

716
00:44:08,762 --> 00:44:11,894
<i>We could be starving</i>
<i>We could be homeless</i>

717
00:44:11,895 --> 00:44:12,894

<i>As long as you love me</i>

735
00:45:48,966 --> 00:45:51,532
<i>We could be starving</i>

<i>We could be homeless</i>

737
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:55,569
<i>We could be broke</i>

738
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:00,620
Justin!

739
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:24,567
<i>Baby, baby, baby, oh</i>

740
00:46:24,568 --> 00:46:27,671
<i>Six-year-old Avalanna Routh</i>
<i>is a huge Justin Bieber fan.</i>

741
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:32,868
<i>And now there's a Facebook page</i>

742
00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:37,367
<i>dedicated to trying to get her
to meet the pop superstar.</i>

743
00:46:37,368 --> 00:46:40,567
<i>Avalanna had become</i>
<i>Mrs. Bieber at her hospital.</i>

744
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:42,534
<i>She had a rare disease.</i>

745
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:45,534
She loved Justin and they got
a cardboard cutout of Justin.

746
00:46:45,534 --> 00:46:47,801
<i>And she had a whole fake
wedding at her hospital</i>

747
00:46:47,802 --> 00:46:48,961
<i>with this cardboard cutout.</i>

748
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,535
<i>And it was</i>
<i>on the news in Boston.</i>

749
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:54,269
<i>And I was just blown away.</i>
<i>She was adorable.</i>

750
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,902
<i>So I called Justin.</i>
<i>He said, "Let's meet her.</i>

751
00:46:55,903 --> 00:46:57,601
<i>"I'm gonna be</i>
<i>in New York next week.</i>

752
00:46:57,602 --> 00:47:00,002
<i>"Let's bring her</i>
<i>down from Boston."</i>

753
00:47:00,003 --> 00:47:02,003
<i>And, you know, it was supposed
to be a quick meet and greet,</i>

754
00:47:02,004 --> 00:47:03,906
<i>and he ended up
spending hours with her.</i>

755
00:47:06,737 --> 00:47:08,735
I met with her and it wasn't...
It wasn't normal.

756
00:47:08,736 --> 00:47:10,269
It was different.

757
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,035
It wasn't like I was
just meeting another fan.

758
00:47:12,036 --> 00:47:13,836
It was like...
It was so special.

759
00:47:13,837 --> 00:47:15,836
<i>I sat down. I played</i>
<i>board games with her.</i>

760
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:18,271
I thought she was
super adorable.

761
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,769
<i>It is.</i>

762
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,837
<i>And they got really, really
close like a big brother,</i>

763
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:25,870
<i>but she called him her husband.</i>

764
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:27,670
<i>And he called her</i>
<i>Mrs. Bieber.</i>

765
00:47:27,671 --> 00:47:29,031
- Name is?
- She is Mrs. Bieber.

766
00:47:29,337 --> 00:47:31,136
And basically she had
her own little wedding

767
00:47:31,337 --> 00:47:33,004
- at the hospital.
- Yeah.

768
00:47:33,005 --> 00:47:35,303
She was like,
"You're my husband,

769
00:47:35,304 --> 00:47:37,370
"so my mom's
your mother-in-law."

770
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:41,274
And she's so little and it's
like, "Wow, she's so cute."

771
00:47:47,372 --> 00:47:49,903
Ducks, ducks, ducks.
Quack, quack, quack.

772
00:47:49,904 --> 00:47:51,938
Smooth.

773
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:26,506
Avalanna put her hands over her
ears and he was singing to her.

774
00:48:26,507 --> 00:48:27,706
And then he goes, "What's
wrong?" And she goes,

775
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:29,905
"It's so loud in here.
Why are they screaming?

776
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,839
"You're my husband."

777
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,875
<i>What, are they...
Are they just really loud?</i>

778
00:48:34,874 --> 00:48:36,473
<i>They're very loud.</i>

779
00:48:36,474 --> 00:48:37,740
<i>They're very loud.</i>

780
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:39,707
<i>But that's a good thing.</i>

781
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,073
<i>That's a good thing</i>
<i>because that just means</i>

782
00:48:41,074 --> 00:48:43,072
<i>they're really supportive fans.</i>

783
00:48:44,408 --> 00:48:46,673
<i>Yeah.</i>

784
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,752
<i>So, we're gonna get</i>
<i>you back over there to Mom.</i>

785
00:48:49,275 --> 00:48:50,807
<i>But did you have fun up here?</i>

786
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:54,007
<i>Yeah, I have to wear earphones.</i>

787
00:48:54,008 --> 00:48:55,807
<i>Okay.</i>

788
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:59,040
<i>Okay. Well, we'll get you another
pair of earphones side stage, okay,</i>

789
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:01,574
<i>and you can watch</i>
<i>the rest of the show?</i>

790
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:03,275
<i>Is that gonna be cool?</i>

791
00:49:03,276 --> 00:49:04,441
<i>Yeah?</i>

792
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,508
<i>Wanna give me a hug?</i>

793
00:49:08,409 --> 00:49:10,474
<i>Okay. We'll get you</i>
<i>some earphones, sweetie.</i>

794
00:49:10,475 --> 00:49:12,907
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

795
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,507
I love him.

796
00:49:14,508 --> 00:49:15,508
That was so cute.

797
00:49:17,377 --> 00:49:19,542
That was adorable.
Oh, my God.

798
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:33,475
<i>And, uh...</i>

799
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:37,509
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

800
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,845
Oh, my God.

801
00:49:40,843 --> 00:49:43,026
<i>It's just like...</i>

802
00:49:59,011 --> 00:50:02,312
<i>But... Give a round of
applause for Avalanna.</i>

803
00:50:04,812 --> 00:50:05,811
<i>Then slowly...</i>

804
00:50:08,712 --> 00:50:10,283
...her talking,
her speech...

805
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,910
...started to slow down.

806
00:50:16,911 --> 00:50:20,415
And her eye started
shutting on her left side.

807
00:50:22,413 --> 00:50:23,412
<i>And, um...</i>

808
00:50:31,313 --> 00:50:32,686
<i>It was just...</i>

809
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,654
It was just hard to see.

810
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:48,647
But...

811
00:50:56,514 --> 00:50:58,483
I miss her, bro.

812
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:17,781
<i>Our first show, Avalanna unfortunately
died just four days earlier,</i>

813
00:51:17,782 --> 00:51:19,848
<i>and all of us were feeling it.</i>

814
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:23,349
<i>Tonight's</i> Lonely Girl
<i>is super special</i>

815
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:25,585
<i>because, um...</i>

816
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,584
<i>This song is dedicated</i>

817
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:32,487
<i>to, um, to sweet Avalanna.</i>

818
00:51:36,483 --> 00:51:38,949
<i>So, um...</i>

819
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:43,051
<i>Avalanna, if you're listening,
I love you.</i>

820
00:51:45,049 --> 00:51:48,316
<i>And everyone... Everyone
in here loves you as well.</i>

821
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:52,684
<i>So, um, this one's for you.</i>

822
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:58,583
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

823
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:01,650
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

824
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,416
<i>And Justin didn't feel like</i>
<i>it was right to sing</i>

825
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:07,283
<i>to a girl that night 'cause he
had just shared the last time</i>

826
00:52:07,284 --> 00:52:10,850
<i>he performed</i> One Less Lonely
Girl,<i> it was her in the chair.</i>

827
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:14,584
<i>We took a bunch of pictures. We
put them into a huge montage.</i>

828
00:52:14,585 --> 00:52:16,584
<i>During</i> One Less Lonely Girl,
<i>we put them up on the screen.</i>

829
00:52:16,585 --> 00:52:17,550
<i>How many bags you packed</i>

830
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,884
<i>Just to take them back?</i>

831
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,416
<i>Tell me that</i>
<i>How many either or's?</i>

832
00:52:21,417 --> 00:52:25,883
<i>But no more if you let me</i>
<i>inside of your world</i>

833
00:52:25,884 --> 00:52:28,384
<i>There'll be one</i>
<i>less lonely girl...</i>

834
00:52:28,385 --> 00:52:30,018
<i>And he didn't walk to the chair.</i>

835
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:32,917
<i>He walked to the top and he
stared and he sang to the screen.</i>

836
00:52:32,918 --> 00:52:33,917
<i>Before I saw you</i>

837
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:35,755
<i>Now all I see is you</i>

838
00:52:38,752 --> 00:52:43,851
<i>Oh, no, don't need</i>
<i>these other pretty faces</i>

839
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:45,918
<i>'Cause when you're mine,
in the world...</i>

840
00:52:45,919 --> 00:52:49,286
<i>I think that was</i>
<i>his way of saying goodbye.</i>

841
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:50,752
<i>There's gonna be
one less lonely girl</i>

842
00:52:50,753 --> 00:52:53,686
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

843
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:56,285
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

844
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:58,518
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

845
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:00,618
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>one less lonely girl</i>

846
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:01,586
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

847
00:53:01,587 --> 00:53:04,552
<i>I'm gonna put you first</i>

848
00:53:04,553 --> 00:53:06,021
<i>I'll show you what you're worth</i>

849
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,886
<i>If you let me inside</i>
<i>of your world</i>

850
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:12,785
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>one less lonely girl</i>

851
00:53:12,786 --> 00:53:15,553
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

852
00:53:15,554 --> 00:53:18,353
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

853
00:53:18,354 --> 00:53:20,720
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

854
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:23,686
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>one less lonely girl</i>

855
00:53:23,687 --> 00:53:24,921
<i>She touched all of</i>
<i>us in her short time</i>

856
00:53:24,922 --> 00:53:27,586
<i>on this planet, and, you know,
those are the things</i>

857
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:29,487
<i>that make the job real.</i>

858
00:53:29,488 --> 00:53:31,454
<i>We'll never forget her.</i>

859
00:53:40,856 --> 00:53:43,554
That's row four,
seat one. Hot seats.

860
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,955
<i>So things have changed since the
last tour and</i> Never Say Never.

861
00:53:49,956 --> 00:53:52,455
<i>It was an amazing experience</i>
<i>and something that</i>

862
00:53:52,456 --> 00:53:54,288
we'll all be proud of
the rest of our lives,

863
00:53:54,289 --> 00:53:55,622
but now we can't go outside.

864
00:53:55,623 --> 00:53:58,622
- You guys need tickets?
- No, no, we've got tickets.

865
00:53:59,757 --> 00:54:01,954
<i>Kenny goes
outside and gets mobbed.</i>

866
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:03,855
Kenny!

867
00:54:03,856 --> 00:54:05,922
<i>Dan Kanter</i>

868
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:08,455
<i>We wrote this song for you</i>

869
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:10,055
<i>We hope you like it</i>

870
00:54:10,056 --> 00:54:13,053
<i>We really do</i>

871
00:54:13,192 --> 00:54:15,789
<i>You know, Allison can't choose the
</i> One Less Lonely Girl <i> anymore,</i>

872
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,556
<i>so when I go outside now</i>

873
00:54:17,557 --> 00:54:20,355
<i>I have to literally
disguise myself or hide</i>

874
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:24,723
to navigate the giveback
that we do every show,

875
00:54:24,724 --> 00:54:26,024
<i>'cause we still give</i>
<i>away those tickets.</i>

876
00:54:26,025 --> 00:54:27,689
Can we have a picture with you?

877
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:29,823
Would you mind if I hug you?

878
00:54:29,824 --> 00:54:31,656
All right.
So here's my problem...

879
00:54:31,657 --> 00:54:33,556
Yeah.

880
00:54:33,557 --> 00:54:36,491
- I don't have enough tickets to take care of everybody.
- Aw.

881
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:38,989
Who's gonna stay outside out of your six?
You gotta pick one person.

882
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,690
Can we have a minute
to talk about it?

883
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:44,128
- You wanna have a minute to talk about it?
- Yeah, a minute.

884
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:49,356
I can't do that.
I want, like, you don't...

885
00:54:49,357 --> 00:54:50,356
I can't.

886
00:55:08,993 --> 00:55:11,027
No, no,
you were like one of the...

887
00:55:12,026 --> 00:55:13,561
What? So you won't go?

888
00:55:16,558 --> 00:55:18,792
All right.

889
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:20,991
She's gonna stay. Hug her
'cause you guys get to go in.

890
00:55:20,992 --> 00:55:22,626
No, no.

891
00:55:22,627 --> 00:55:24,961
Hey, wait, come here,
come here, come here...

892
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:51,863
You guys trying to buy tickets?

893
00:55:52,862 --> 00:55:54,926
You have tickets?
You have any?

894
00:55:54,927 --> 00:55:56,993
- Yeah, we did.
- What happened to them?

895
00:55:56,994 --> 00:55:58,893
They're fraud?

896
00:55:58,894 --> 00:56:00,360
And they said they're
fraud at the box office?

897
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:01,927
- Yeah.
- Are you upset?

898
00:56:01,928 --> 00:56:03,697
Yeah.

899
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,397
- Oh, my God.
- Shh. Shh.

900
00:56:09,395 --> 00:56:11,695
Oh, my God.

901
00:56:11,696 --> 00:56:13,496
I can't breathe.
Oh, my God.

902
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:17,560
I'm gonna cry.

903
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:18,661
Guys?

904
00:56:18,662 --> 00:56:20,660
Yes.

905
00:56:29,463 --> 00:56:31,781
Girls, you have to hurry to get
to your front row tickets.

906
00:56:36,663 --> 00:56:38,230
Front row!

907
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:40,928
<i>We still go outside and make
sure kids are taken care of.</i>

908
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:43,462
We still go up to the top
deck and upgrade people.

909
00:56:43,463 --> 00:56:45,221
And there's no better
feeling in the world.

910
00:56:46,964 --> 00:56:49,598
We just gotta be
a little sneakier about it.

911
00:56:50,597 --> 00:56:51,729
You don't owe me anything.

912
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:52,729
We're good.
We're good.

913
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:12,497
<i>Watch the cables
and watch your fingers,</i>

914
00:57:12,498 --> 00:57:14,668
video wall coming in.

915
00:57:17,665 --> 00:57:19,183
Okay. Lock number
one set, everybody.

916
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,999
<i>Being on tour,
we go to city to city to city,</i>

917
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,533
<i>that schedule, it's so draining.</i>

918
00:58:07,534 --> 00:58:09,866
<i>He would just be on the bus</i>

919
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:12,403
and he'll just be
in a stare, just like...

920
00:58:14,401 --> 00:58:15,933
And I'll just
be like, "Hey."

921
00:58:15,934 --> 00:58:19,433
<i>It's 7:00 a.m., barely slept
anything, just had a show,</i>

922
00:58:19,434 --> 00:58:21,868
<i>three shows in a row,</i>
<i>so exhausted.</i>

923
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:25,635
<i>You just wanna run in the
hotel and just go to sleep.</i>

924
00:58:29,223 --> 00:58:31,301
This go round is way more
popular than in my world.

925
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:32,667
There's a lot more
people outside.

926
00:58:32,668 --> 00:58:35,266
There's a lot more people at the
bus, so it's hard to be normal.

927
00:58:36,968 --> 00:58:40,301
<i>We can sneak off and try to
be as normal as possible.</i>

928
00:58:40,302 --> 00:58:42,704
<i>But feeling normal,
I don't think that's possible.</i>

929
00:58:43,703 --> 00:58:46,768
When he's hiding in the trunk of a
car so we can go get ice cream,

930
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:49,801
sticking his hand out
of the trunk just to feel air

931
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:52,769
<i>so he doesn't, like,</i>
<i>go crazy of claustrophobia,</i>

932
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,369
<i>and we're doing all of this</i>
<i>just to sneak to go grab</i>

933
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:56,769
<i>some ice cream.</i>

934
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,330
How can that even
feel halfway normal?

935
00:59:04,304 --> 00:59:07,436
He's gotta go through things with everyone
watching every step that he makes.

936
00:59:07,437 --> 00:59:08,903
Justin, do you love your fans?

937
00:59:08,904 --> 00:59:10,935
Do you love your fans, Justin?

938
00:59:10,936 --> 00:59:14,537
There's somewhat of a gift
and a curse in being popular.

939
00:59:14,538 --> 00:59:16,470
Move out of the way, man.

940
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:17,709
You gotta move out of the way.

941
00:59:24,371 --> 00:59:25,370
What'd you say?

942
00:59:27,904 --> 00:59:31,404
I'd been chased by those
same people that whole trip,

943
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:33,364
and they were talking
nonsense the whole time,

944
00:59:33,872 --> 00:59:36,004
like verbally assaulting me.

945
00:59:38,405 --> 00:59:39,764
As a human being,
rage comes out,

946
00:59:40,638 --> 00:59:43,304
and I happened to snap,
and I opened the door

947
00:59:43,305 --> 00:59:44,338
and I was like, "What do you...

948
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:46,337
"What are you guys..."
I really wanted to hit him.

949
00:59:48,906 --> 00:59:49,905
<i>We ended up peeling off.</i>

950
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:55,072
I learned from that.

951
00:59:55,073 --> 00:59:56,737
That's what they wanted.

952
00:59:56,738 --> 00:59:58,871
They wanted to get
a reaction out of me

953
00:59:58,872 --> 01:00:00,305
<i>so that they could print that,</i>

954
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:02,905
so that they could
make me seem like this,

955
01:00:02,906 --> 01:00:05,773
"Oh, I'm out of control."
But really I'm just...

956
01:00:05,774 --> 01:00:08,471
I have a heart
and I have feelings.

957
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:11,072
And when people...
When people...

958
01:00:11,073 --> 01:00:14,306
...like hurt my heart,
I'm gonna get angry, upset

959
01:00:14,307 --> 01:00:16,265
and lash out sometimes
'cause I'm a human being.

960
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,340
<i>Here we go.</i>

961
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:47,790
<i>Here we go.</i>

962
01:01:01,776 --> 01:01:02,775
<i>Here we go.</i>

963
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:10,786
<i>Here we go.</i>

964
01:01:22,709 --> 01:01:24,501
<i>Here we go.</i>

965
01:01:53,611 --> 01:01:55,677
<i>Here we go.</i>

966
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:58,411
<i>She don't like the flash</i>

967
01:01:58,412 --> 01:02:00,515
<i>Wanna keep us in the dark</i>

968
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,877
<i>She don't like the fame</i>

969
01:02:05,878 --> 01:02:09,577
<i>Hate it when we're miles apart</i>

970
01:02:09,578 --> 01:02:11,377
<i>Here we go.</i>

971
01:02:11,378 --> 01:02:15,312
<i>It's getting to the point</i>
<i>where it's too much for her</i>

972
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:18,644
<i>Throw us all away</i>
<i>'cause it's too much for her</i>

973
01:02:18,645 --> 01:02:21,679
<i>She can't hide away</i>

974
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,578
<i>'Cause the world</i>
<i>knows who we are</i>

975
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:26,513
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:32,613
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

977
01:02:32,614 --> 01:02:34,546
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

978
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,612
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

979
01:02:40,613 --> 01:02:42,845
<i>Don't wanna share</i>
<i>with no one else</i>

980
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:44,546
<i>Want me to herself</i>

01:02:44,547 --> 01:02:47,980
<i>Don't want no love</i>

01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:49,581
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

983
01:02:53,846 --> 01:02:55,647
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

984
01:02:55,648 --> 01:02:57,179
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

985
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,880
<i>Bieber is no stranger
to flipping off photographers,</i>

986
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:01,914
<i>but is his behavior</i>
<i>becoming more erratic?</i>

987
01:03:01,915 --> 01:03:03,579
<i>He's out of control.</i>

988
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,916
<i>She's giving ultimatums</i>

989
01:03:06,914 --> 01:03:09,882
<i>She don't like this life</i>

990
01:03:10,881 --> 01:03:14,614
<i>She said if I loved her</i>

991
01:03:14,615 --> 01:03:16,816
<i>I'd give it up,</i>
<i>won't think twice</i>

992
01:03:19,516 --> 01:03:21,381
<i>I can't do that</i>

993
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:23,621
<i>It's getting to the point</i>

1006
01:04:05,584 --> 01:04:06,916
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

1007
01:04:06,917 --> 01:04:11,084
<i>How can I choose between the two</i>

1008
01:04:11,085 --> 01:04:14,884
<i>When all the lights</i>

1009
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:18,884
<i>I wish she could see</i>
<i>how good this can be</i>

1010
01:04:18,885 --> 01:04:22,584
<i>I hope that she waits</i>

1011
01:04:22,585 --> 01:04:26,451
<i>'Cause I don't wanna live life</i>

1012
01:04:26,452 --> 01:04:30,851
<i>Without her by my side</i>

1013
01:04:30,852 --> 01:04:34,553

1014
01:04:35,553 --> 01:04:37,758

1015
01:04:43,753 --> 01:04:45,891

01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:51,652

1022
01:05:15,055 --> 01:05:16,788
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

1023
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,854
People on the outside
look in at celebrities,

1024
01:05:28,855 --> 01:05:31,323
especially people like Lindsay
Lohan, Britney, almost...

1025
01:05:32,322 --> 01:05:33,653
They feel sad.

1026
01:05:33,654 --> 01:05:34,953
You look at Michael Jackson,
you feel sad

1027
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:36,621
because they're like,
you can't...

1028
01:05:36,622 --> 01:05:38,055
- Yes.
- ...escape this.

1029
01:05:38,056 --> 01:05:41,988
It is an inevitability that a young
person will become a train wreck.

1030
01:05:41,989 --> 01:05:43,722
Do you think about that?

1031
01:05:43,723 --> 01:05:46,388
And are you conscious that you
are the perfect candidate

1032
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:48,387
to become a train wreck?

1033
01:05:48,389 --> 01:05:49,689
You are.

1034
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:50,822
- We talk about this all the time.
- Um.

1035
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:53,056
What? We talk about
this all the time.

1036
01:05:53,057 --> 01:05:54,189
There's no train wreck.

1037
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:57,522
What... I'm living here,
I'm 19, by myself in this...

1038
01:05:57,523 --> 01:05:59,855
In this great house, just...

1039
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,089
But that's where
the train wreck can start.

1040
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,556
- How can... How?
- 'Cause it's safe.

1041
01:06:02,557 --> 01:06:03,755
- 'Cause it's a bubble.
- But there's no...

1042
01:06:03,756 --> 01:06:06,055
No one can tell you no.
So now what?

1043
01:06:06,056 --> 01:06:07,954
Now what are you gonna do
when no one can say no?

1044
01:06:07,955 --> 01:06:09,927
No one can say no,
but here's the thing,

1045
01:06:12,924 --> 01:06:15,389
for me, I've seen it happen.

1046
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:16,955
I can't...

1047
01:06:16,956 --> 01:06:20,588
I'm not gonna be
stupid enough to...

1048
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:22,856
For me to let
that happen to myself

1049
01:06:22,857 --> 01:06:25,624
because I have a good
head on my shoulders.

1050
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,424
Maybe I might make a few
mistakes, sure, I'm 19.

1051
01:06:28,425 --> 01:06:31,022
But I was raised, like,
Sunday school every Sunday,

1052
01:06:31,023 --> 01:06:33,524
like, I was the... My mom
broke it down to me,

1053
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:36,691
like, this is who you are,
you're gonna be a good person,

1054
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,890
you're gonna help people, you're
gonna be quick to forgive,

1055
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:42,058
you're gonna be a humble,
genuine person.

1056
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:45,956
And if you're not, there's
gonna be consequences.

1057
01:06:45,957 --> 01:06:48,956
She doesn't agree with some
of the decisions that I make.

1058
01:06:48,957 --> 01:06:52,024
Sometimes... Well, all
moms don't agree with...

1059
01:06:52,025 --> 01:06:54,524
But she knows that I got
a good head on my shoulders.

1060
01:06:54,525 --> 01:06:56,625
She did what she
had to do to raise me.

1061
01:06:56,626 --> 01:06:58,092
And she did a wonderful,
wonderful job.

1062
01:06:58,093 --> 01:07:02,059
And I'm super,
super grateful for her.

1063
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,693
You know what, I don't like your
attitude, to be quite honest.

1064
01:07:06,692 --> 01:07:07,924
You're mad.

1065
01:07:07,925 --> 01:07:10,391
Because, you know what,
you're too young

1066
01:07:10,392 --> 01:07:12,559
to be peepeeing in buckets
and driving up and down

1067
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,425
the highway fast.

1068
01:07:14,426 --> 01:07:17,926
I don't think your mom would really
mind if a stranger whipped her son.

1069
01:07:17,927 --> 01:07:19,593
You ain't spanking me, man.

1070
01:07:20,592 --> 01:07:21,992
Ow! What are you doing?

1071
01:07:21,993 --> 01:07:23,396
What are you doing?

1072
01:07:26,393 --> 01:07:27,392
Whoo!

1073
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:35,866
So who are you dating now?

1074
01:07:40,861 --> 01:07:44,907
So I'm backstage at,
um, my concert.

1075
01:07:56,896 --> 01:07:59,727
I just wanted to make this video

1076
01:07:59,728 --> 01:08:01,802
because I just saw Justin's VD.

1077
01:08:08,795 --> 01:08:12,461
You really inspire me.
I really, like...

1078
01:08:12,462 --> 01:08:15,802
You're the reason why I wake up with
a smile on my face every morning.

1079
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:23,370
Yes, I will stay
with you forever.

1080
01:08:30,364 --> 01:08:32,463
I just love you so much, Justin,

1081
01:08:32,464 --> 01:08:34,529
and hope you're
gonna see this video

1082
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:37,396
'cause otherwise I'm
really gonna look stupid.

1083
01:08:37,397 --> 01:08:39,529
Yeah.

1084
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:42,462
Thank you for everything
you've done for us,

1085
01:08:42,463 --> 01:08:44,630

1088
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:50,097
<i>is what keeps him alive I think,</i>

1089
01:08:50,098 --> 01:08:52,029
because if he gets
too far off track,

1090
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:53,662
they're there to kinda
be that moral compass

1091
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:54,865
that brings him back always.

1092
01:08:55,864 --> 01:08:57,997
Oh, my...
Look, how close we are.

1093
01:08:57,998 --> 01:08:59,531
Oh, my God.

1094
01:08:59,532 --> 01:09:02,698
It all started... It all
stemmed off from my fans

1095
01:09:02,699 --> 01:09:04,933
showing up at
each radio station.

1096

it's gotta end up with the fans.

I might cry a little bit 'cause
that was so cute. Oh, my gosh.

1102
01:09:20,566 --> 01:09:21,865

01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:36,678
'Cause that journey, by the way,

1173
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:39,515
is gonna help someone
make it through their journey.

1174
01:14:40,514 --> 01:14:43,048
<i>I need some space</i>

1175
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:46,612
<i>To come around you</i>

1176
01:14:46,613 --> 01:14:50,449
<i>Around, around,</i>
<i>around, around, around</i>

1177
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:55,380
You know, if you're an
artist that is after fame,

1178
01:14:55,381 --> 01:14:56,715
after money,

1179
01:14:57,714 --> 01:14:59,914
and you achieve those things,

1180
01:14:59,915 --> 01:15:02,347
then you have no
reason to go forward.

1181
01:15:02,348 --> 01:15:04,613
<i>If your goals are</i>
<i>to make great music,</i>

1182
01:15:04,614 --> 01:15:06,881
to be a better
and better singer,

1183
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:10,614
to be a better and
better writer every day,

1184
01:15:10,615 --> 01:15:12,733
then that's a lifelong journey
and that doesn't end.

1185
01:15:16,748 --> 01:15:19,387
<i>It's a weird position to be in
when you've only been winning,</i>

1186
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:23,014
but he doesn't really understand
what the loss looks like.

1187
01:15:23,015 --> 01:15:25,348
That's why it's important for
him to just stay humble,

1188
01:15:25,349 --> 01:15:26,881
stay on that humble path,

1189
01:15:26,882 --> 01:15:30,582
because the minute
something goes wrong,

1190
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:33,683
everybody's gonna
try to tear him apart.

1191
01:15:34,682 --> 01:15:38,815
You know, and he has to always
remember what got him there.

1192
01:15:38,816 --> 01:15:40,350
You gonna get through
the whole time this time?

1193
01:15:40,351 --> 01:15:41,350
I'll try.

1194
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:42,750
All right. Go ahead.

1195
01:15:56,651 --> 01:16:00,017
Um, yeah.

1196
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:03,383
If I wasn't scared
that'd be a bad thing.

1197
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:04,849
We've had moments
over the last year

1198
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:07,049
where it's just been
straight yelling, screaming,

1199
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:09,517
tears, hugs.

1200
01:16:09,518 --> 01:16:11,383
I mean, we're going like this
and he'll call me and be like,

1201
01:16:11,384 --> 01:16:12,783
- "You just need to come here."
- Just come here.

1202
01:16:12,784 --> 01:16:15,050
And you need to spend time,
you need to be around me,

1203
01:16:15,051 --> 01:16:17,451
and I want you to be
around me 'cause I want...

1204
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:20,384
I want you in my life and I want
you to see what's going on.

1205
01:16:20,385 --> 01:16:21,384
And...

1206
01:16:21,519 --> 01:16:24,384
No, but it's always
gonna be that way,

1207
01:16:24,385 --> 01:16:26,752
and honestly I'm a better man
because he's in my life

1208
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:28,352
and because I'm going through
these struggles with him.

1209
01:16:28,353 --> 01:16:30,418
- That's so sweet...
- Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

1210
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,984
That's one of the sweetest
things you've ever said.

1211
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:34,085
But, you know, we're gonna
keep going through...

1212
01:16:34,086 --> 01:16:35,784
Hey, man. Um...

1213
01:16:35,785 --> 01:16:38,018
We're gonna keep going
through these struggles

1214
01:16:38,019 --> 01:16:38,952
and it's not
gonna get any easier,

1215
01:16:38,953 --> 01:16:41,552
but at the end of the day,
he's worth it.

1216
01:16:50,787 --> 01:16:52,119
<i>You guys seem to help.</i>

1217
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:55,853
Believe, believe, believe.

1218
01:16:55,854 --> 01:16:59,552
It's our last show.
Time has gone by fast.

1219
01:16:59,553 --> 01:17:01,786
I remember thinking about
this day in the rehearsal.

1220
01:17:01,787 --> 01:17:03,554
I can remember the first show.

1221
01:17:04,554 --> 01:17:05,689
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1222
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:10,821
Just feeling that energy
that his fans just, like,

1223
01:17:10,822 --> 01:17:13,087
<i>give to us for the first time,</i>

1224
01:17:13,088 --> 01:17:16,721
<i>that realization that
I'm fulfilling my dream</i>

1225
01:17:16,722 --> 01:17:18,354
and I'll never
forget that feeling.

1226
01:17:18,355 --> 01:17:20,054
I've always dreamed
to be a choreographer.

1227
01:17:20,055 --> 01:17:22,587
Like, from the day
I started dancing

1228
01:17:22,588 --> 01:17:25,887
<i>when the first show happened,</i>
<i>I sat down against a wall</i>

1229
01:17:25,888 --> 01:17:28,821
<i>and I just, like, really</i>
<i>started crying to myself.</i>

1230
01:17:28,822 --> 01:17:31,053
Oh, my gosh, no,
how about the audition?

1231
01:17:31,054 --> 01:17:32,957
<i>Yeah, so no pressure, you know.</i>

1232
01:17:34,956 --> 01:17:37,055
<i>It was so surreal.</i>
<i>It was something</i>

1233
01:17:37,056 --> 01:17:38,787
that we had all been
working really hard towards

1234
01:17:38,788 --> 01:17:40,855
and something we
had wanted so badly.

1235
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,189
<i>I remember being,</i>
<i>like, 10 years old</i>

1236
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,788
<i>and going to concerts and,</i>
<i>like, watching the dancer</i>

1237
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:47,421
and I always knew
that I wanted to do this.

1238
01:17:47,422 --> 01:17:50,021
<i>I'm really, really grateful because
I got to dance with him on stage.</i>

1239
01:17:50,022 --> 01:17:53,394
It's amazing and I'm so thankful
that I got the opportunity.

1240
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:59,556
Being right now in my home city

1241
01:17:59,557 --> 01:18:01,688
where dancing
all started for me,

1242
01:18:01,689 --> 01:18:03,455
<i>seeing my mom out</i>
<i>there and, like,</i>

1243
01:18:03,456 --> 01:18:05,622
<i>thinking about how</i>
<i>much she sacrificed for me</i>

1244
01:18:05,623 --> 01:18:06,822
<i>to do what I love to do,</i>

1245
01:18:06,823 --> 01:18:08,655
<i>and I'm here with my boys</i>

1246
01:18:08,656 --> 01:18:11,055
and I'm here with one of the best
artists I've ever worked with,

1247
01:18:11,056 --> 01:18:13,558
yeah, it's amazing.
It's amazing.

1248
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:15,956
<i>I think that believing</i>

1249
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:18,089
<i>is the most powerful thing</i>
<i>that you can do in this life.</i>

1250
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:20,889
You can come from absolutely
nothing to something,

1251
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:23,623
to be standing right here,
so I think that,

1252
01:18:23,624 --> 01:18:26,102
I'm ready to share that with the
world just like Justin does.

1253
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:30,623
<i>And now here we are
doing the last show.</i>

1254
01:18:30,624 --> 01:18:32,757
Oh, my gosh.
I might cry tonight.

1255
01:18:32,758 --> 01:18:34,090
- Oh, for sure.
- We might cry.

1256
01:18:34,091 --> 01:18:35,171
You might see some tears.

1257
01:18:35,524 --> 01:18:37,060
- In <i> Believe.</i>
- In <i> Believe.</i>

1258
01:18:39,058 --> 01:18:40,991
<i>The music plays until it stops.</i>

1259
01:18:40,992 --> 01:18:43,657
And when it does,
what have you learned

1260
01:18:43,658 --> 01:18:45,691
and what do you believe?

1261
01:18:45,692 --> 01:18:47,591
Do you believe this hype,

1262
01:18:47,592 --> 01:18:50,358
<i>or are you creating</i>
<i>something greater,</i>

1263
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:53,125
<i>a deeper passion that will</i>

1264
01:18:53,126 --> 01:18:56,092
<i>not only help to articulate</i>
<i>who you are as an artist,</i>

1265
01:18:56,093 --> 01:18:59,925
<i>but also help people to be</i>
<i>able to identify with you?</i>

1266
01:18:59,926 --> 01:19:02,492
<i>Believe</i> means,
like, be all you wanna be,

1267
01:19:02,493 --> 01:19:04,058
do what you wanna do and don't
stop believing in yourself,

1268
01:19:04,059 --> 01:19:05,226
just go for it.

1269
01:19:05,226 --> 01:19:08,093
I would listen to it when I
was really upset and it was,

1270
01:19:08,094 --> 01:19:10,373
like, I don't know, it's
just really helped me, like,

1271
01:19:10,525 --> 01:19:12,004
pull through and,
like, not give up.

1272
01:19:14,594 --> 01:19:16,991
<i>Justin,</i>
<i>in a lot of our car rides,</i>

1273
01:19:16,992 --> 01:19:18,727
<i>he'd be singing in the back</i>

1274
01:19:18,728 --> 01:19:19,892
and I'd be
telling him to shut up

1275
01:19:19,893 --> 01:19:22,093
because he'd never stop.

1276
01:19:22,094 --> 01:19:24,459
<i>But I didn't know this was
gonna happen obviously, right,</i>

1277
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,859
<i>so this is his life,
this is what he loves,</i>

1278
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:30,027
nothing's been
given to him and, yeah,

1279
01:19:30,028 --> 01:19:31,096
I'm very proud of him.

1280
01:19:33,094 --> 01:19:36,727
<i>I was just looking
at him the other day,</i>

1281
01:19:36,728 --> 01:19:39,394
and he had such a baby face,
and he's my baby,

1282
01:19:39,395 --> 01:19:41,593
and just to look at him now

1283
01:19:41,594 --> 01:19:44,394
<i>with, like,
his little chiseled jaw</i>

1284
01:19:44,395 --> 01:19:45,894
<i>and his attempts at facial hair.</i>

1285
01:19:48,029 --> 01:19:50,127
He's just...
He's growing so much.

1286
01:19:50,128 --> 01:19:53,362
<i>And as busy as he is</i>
<i>and as much as he has on him,</i>

1287
01:19:53,363 --> 01:19:56,462
<i>he still continues to give back.</i>

1288
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:58,760
And, you know, as a mom and
just seeing his character grow,

1289
01:19:58,761 --> 01:20:03,428
I think that's one of the biggest,
um, achievements, in my mind.

1290
01:20:03,429 --> 01:20:06,129
But, Justin, I still want you
to pull your pants up.

1291
01:20:06,649 --> 01:20:08,128
...of a night that
they can't believe.

1292
01:20:08,129 --> 01:20:10,628
I pray that you will be
with everyone on stage,

1293
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:13,961
bless them all, help everyone
just to have the best show...

1294
01:20:13,962 --> 01:20:16,961
<i>No matter what religion,
no matter what race,</i>

1295
01:20:16,962 --> 01:20:19,465
<i>not matter what you are,
you can always believe.</i>

1296
01:20:20,464 --> 01:20:21,695
It's all about positivity,

1297
01:20:21,696 --> 01:20:23,465
all about believing
in something great,

1298
01:20:24,464 --> 01:20:27,763
believing in a higher power,
believing in yourself,

1299
01:20:27,764 --> 01:20:30,895
believing that
you can do anything

1300
01:20:30,896 --> 01:20:31,976
if you set your mind to it.

1301
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:40,467
<i>I don't know how I got here</i>

1302
01:20:42,465 --> 01:20:45,633
<i>I knew it wouldn't be easy</i>

1303
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:52,933
<i>But your faith in me</i>
<i>was so clear</i>

1304
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,830
<i>It didn't matter how many times</i>

1305
01:20:55,831 --> 01:21:00,031
<i>I got knocked on the floor</i>

1306
01:21:00,032 --> 01:21:05,067
<i>But you knew one day</i>
<i>I would be standing tall</i>

1307
01:21:07,065 --> 01:21:09,932
<i>Just look at me now</i>

1308
01:21:09,933 --> 01:21:13,032
<i>'Cause everything
starts from something</i>

1309
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:15,998
<i>But something would be nothing</i>

1310
01:21:15,999 --> 01:21:20,866
<i>Nothing if your heart</i>
<i>didn't dream with me</i>

1311
01:21:21,865 --> 01:21:26,770
<i>Where would I be, oh</i>

1312
01:21:29,767 --> 01:21:32,666
<i>Where would I be</i>

1313
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:36,733
<i>If you didn't believe</i>

1314
01:21:36,734 --> 01:21:38,099
<i>Would I know how it feels</i>

1315
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,698
<i>To touch the sky, yeah</i>

1316
01:21:40,699 --> 01:21:42,532
<i>If you didn't believe</i>

1317
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:44,770
<i>Believe, believe</i>

1318
01:21:47,768 --> 01:21:49,766
<i>It didn't matter how many times</i>

1319
01:21:49,767 --> 01:21:53,036

<i>But you knew one day</i>
<i>I would be standing tall</i>

1321
01:22:00,935 --> 01:22:03,102
<i>Look at us now</i>

1322
01:22:04,101 --> 01:22:06,900
<i>'Cause everything</i>
<i>starts from something</i>

1323
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:10,533

01:22:56,037 --> 01:23:00,869
<i>Oh</i>

1337
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:04,137
<i>When you've reached</i>
<i>a certain point in your life,</i>

1338
01:23:04,138 --> 01:23:08,605
<i>there are people out</i>
<i>there who sit waiting,</i>

1339
01:23:09,605 --> 01:23:11,607
<i>wanting to see you fall.</i>

1340
01:23:13,605 --> 01:23:17,570
<i>But rather than let</i>
<i>gravity take you down,</i>

1341
01:23:17,571 --> 01:23:21,906
<i>sometimes you have to take</i>
<i>matters into your own hands</i>

1342
01:23:22,905 --> 01:23:23,904
<i>and fly.</i>

1343
01:24:03,741 --> 01:24:06,906
<i>I'm Justin Bieber.
Thank you for believing in me.</i>

1344
01:24:06,907 --> 01:24:09,441
<i>'Cause I believe in you.</i>

1345
01:24:21,574 --> 01:24:22,973
This was me.

1346
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:24,806
My pants were like this, guys.

1347
01:24:24,807 --> 01:24:25,974
- Normal, normal.
- Higher, higher.

1348
01:24:25,975 --> 01:24:27,941
And he said...
He said to me, he said,

1349
01:24:27,942 --> 01:24:29,474
"You can't let
the pants wear you,

1350
01:24:29,475 --> 01:24:30,773
"you got to
wear the pants."

1351
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:32,141
That's when I started sagging.

1352
01:24:32,142 --> 01:24:34,006
- That's true. Hey...
- And that's your fault.

1353
01:24:34,007 --> 01:24:36,607
No, listen, I will
tell you one thing though,

1354
01:24:36,608 --> 01:24:38,574
I've lost a pair of pants,
bro, walking.

1355
01:24:38,575 --> 01:24:39,874
- Yeah?
- Lost a pair of pants walking.

1356
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,141
No.

1357
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:42,574
And it's not like, you know,

1358
01:24:42,575 --> 01:24:43,975
like, you're out at a bookstore

1359
01:24:43,976 --> 01:24:45,375
just browsing
the nonfiction section.

1360
01:24:45,376 --> 01:24:46,941
- Yeah.
- The nonfiction section.

1361
01:24:46,942 --> 01:24:48,707
And your pants are
a little bit low.

1362
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:51,375
I'm just saying that one day,
just be careful, bro,

1363
01:24:51,376 --> 01:24:52,908
because I've lost
a pair of pants.

1364
01:24:52,909 --> 01:24:54,108
- Okay. I'm just saying...
- The nonfiction section...

1365
01:24:54,109 --> 01:24:56,476
- You were the... You were the one...
- ...at Barnes & Noble.

1366
01:24:56,477 --> 01:24:57,875
You were the one that said,

1367
01:24:57,876 --> 01:25:00,008
"Hey, don't let
the pants wear you,

1368
01:25:00,009 --> 01:25:01,743
- "wear the pants."
- That's right.

1369
01:25:01,744 --> 01:25:03,041
That's why...

1370
01:25:03,042 --> 01:25:04,976
But they... Hey...

1371
01:25:04,977 --> 01:25:06,408
- Wear them though.
- Yeah, wear them.

1372
01:25:06,409 --> 01:25:07,908
When they're on the ground,
bro, they're off.

1373
01:25:07,909 --> 01:25:09,508
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nobody's wearing them.

1374
01:26:14,779 --> 01:26:15,778
Oh, no.

1375
01:26:24,747 --> 01:26:25,979
Smile big!

1376
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:26,979
One, two! Perfect, yeah.

1377
01:26:30,614 --> 01:26:31,613
Don't cry too much.

1378
01:26:40,713 --> 01:26:41,793
Told them he's gonna fall.

1379
01:26:53,115 --> 01:26:56,481
<i>When I was 13,</i>
<i>I had my first love</i>

1380
01:26:56,482 --> 01:26:58,048
<i>There was nobody</i>
<i>that compared to my baby</i>

1381
01:26:58,049 --> 01:27:00,447
<i>And nobody came between us</i>
<i>or could ever come above</i>

1382
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:04,047
<i>She had me going crazy</i>
<i>oh, I was star struck</i>

1383
01:27:04,048 --> 01:27:07,647
<i>She woke me up daily</i>
<i>don't need no Starbucks</i>

1384
01:27:07,648 --> 01:27:09,448
<i>She made my heart pound</i>

1385
01:27:09,449 --> 01:27:10,848
<i>It skipped a beat</i>
<i>when I see her in the street</i>

1386
01:27:10,849 --> 01:27:12,208
<i>And at school on the playground</i>

1387
01:27:13,082 --> 01:27:15,447
<i>But I really wanna</i>
<i>see her on the weekend</i>

1388
01:27:15,448 --> 01:27:19,297
<i>She knows she got me dazing</i>
<i>'cause she was so amazing</i>

1389
01:27:19,298 --> 01:27:21,862
<i>And now my heart is breaking</i>
<i>but I just keep on saying...</i>

1390
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:35,849
Hi.

1391
01:27:52,585 --> 01:27:53,933
Oh!

1392
01:28:08,918 --> 01:28:10,787
Does this look like
I'm walking downstairs?

1393
01:28:13,785 --> 01:28:15,451
<i>My man, Ludacris, everybody.</i>

1394
01:28:15,452 --> 01:28:16,823
<i>Give it up for Ludacris!</i>
