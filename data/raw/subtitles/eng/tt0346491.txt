1
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,341
Our world is gone now.

2
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,569
Smashed by the wars.

3
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:54,049
Now I am the keeper of his body...

4
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:58,369
...embalmed here, in the Egyptian ways.

5
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:02,409
I followed him as Pharaoh
and have now ruled 40 years.

6
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:03,769
Hello, Papa.

7
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:06,169
I am the victor...

8
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:10,049
...but what does it all mean, when
there is no one left to remember...

9
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,929
...the great cavalry charge at Gaugamela...

10
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:16,409
...or the mountains of the Hindu Kush...

11
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:22,249
...when we crossed
a 100,000-man army into India?

12
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:31,289
He was a god, Cadmos...

13
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,009
...or as close as anything I've ever seen.

14
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,849
"Tyrant!" they yell so easily. I laugh.

15
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,609
No tyrant ever gave back so much.

16
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,729
What do they know of the world,
these schoolboys?

17
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,809
It takes strong men to rule.

18
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:54,169
Alexander was more, he was a Prometheus,
a friend to man. He changed the world.

19
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,729
Before him, there were tribes...

20
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:02,049
...and after him, all was possible.

21
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,849
There was suddenly a sense the world
could be ruled by one king...

22
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,409
...and be better for all.

23
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:12,329
Eighteen great Alexandrias he built.

24
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,529
It was an empire, not of land
and gold, but of the mind.

25
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:20,649
A Hellenic civilization...

26
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:24,849
...open to all.

27
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,489
But how can I say it?
How can I tell you what it was like...

28
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:36,009
...to be young, to dream big dreams?

29
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:40,849
To believe when Alexander looked you
in the eye, you could do anything.

30
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:42,809
Anything.

31
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:50,849
In his presence, by the light of Apollo,
we were better than ourselves.

32
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:54,249
Truly...

33
00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:01,049
...I've known many great men
in my life, but only one colossus.

34
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:03,969
And only now, when old,
do I understand...

35
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:08,449
...who this force of nature really was.

36
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,849
Or do I?

37
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:19,449
Did such a man as Alexander exist?
Of course not.

38
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:22,809
We idolize him,
make him better than he was.

39
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,609
Men, all men, reach and fall...

40
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:30,889
...reach and fall.

41
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:42,089
In the East, the vast Persian Empire
ruled almost all the known world.

42
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:46,329
In the West,
the once great Greek city-states...

43
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:51,649
...Thebes, Athens, Sparta,
had fallen from pride.

44
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:56,209
For 100 years now, the Persian kings
had bribed the Greeks...

45
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:59,489
...with their gold to fight as mercenaries.

46
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,809
It was Philip, the one-eyed,
who changed all this...

47
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:09,569
...uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders
from the high and lowlands.

48
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,729
With his blood and guts,
he built a professional army...

49
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,529
...that brought the devious Greeks
to their knees.

50
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,929
He then turned his eye on Persia...

51
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:25,009
...where it was said
the new Great King Darius himself...

52
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,249
...on his throne in Babylon, feared Philip.

53
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:39,609
It was from these loins of war
that Alexander was born, in Pella.

54
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:53,849
Some called his mother,
Queen Olympias, a sorceress...

55
00:06:54,049 --> 00:07:00,249
...and said that Alexander was the
child of Dionysus. Others, Zeus.

56
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:06,329
But truly, there was not a man
in Macedonia who didn't look...

57
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:11,089
...at father and son, side by side,
and wonder.

58
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:17,489
Fortune follows bold ones

59
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:25,129
Trust the ones who give you love

60
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:31,769
Life has just begun, son

61
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:35,489
Her skin is water.

62
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,849
Her tongue is fire.

63
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,329
She is your friend.

64
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,089
Take it.

65
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:54,849
If you hesitate, she will strike.
Remember that.

66
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,849
Never hesitate.

67
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,889
Yes.

68
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:06,809
They are like people.

69
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:14,129
You can love them for years.
Feed them, nurture them...

70
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:19,209
...but still, they can turn on you.

71
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,769
Don't hurt her.

72
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,889
Good.

73
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,609
Come.

74
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,489
He calls me a barbarian.

75
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,329
Philip makes a mockery
of Dionysus every night.

76
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:17,289
Women are the only ones
who know Dionysus.

77
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:51,009
My little Achilles.

78
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:14,489
Stay, Alexander, down. Down.

79
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,849
What is it you want?

80
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:19,769
Six months. Did you miss me?

81
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:23,449
- No. Not here!
- Proud bitch. I'm still your king.

82
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:26,529
King of what? Sheepherders?

83
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:36,009
- I am of Achilles' royal blood.
- The blood of Herakles runs in my veins.

84
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,009
- You are nothing but a drunken whore.
- Shut your mouth.

85
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:40,889
You 10-titted bitch from Hades!

86
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,409
Which god could I curse to
have ever laid eyes on you!

87
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:47,289
Do you think people respect you?

88
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:50,209
You think they don't know your bastards?

89
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:01,609
Damn your sorceress soul! You keep him
here like one of your snakes!

90
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,609
I told you not!
I told you not.

91
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:07,329
- You'll obey me.
- I will not.

92
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:11,649
You'll obey me, or I'll kill you
with my own hands.

93
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:18,089
No! No! Stop! Papa!

94
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:23,369
- Obey me!
- Your Majesty! No!

95
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,809
In the name of the gods.

96
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:31,929
He will never be yours! Never!

97
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,569
In my womb, I carried my avenger!

98
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:48,769
In the world he grew up to...

99
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:53,689
...I've come to believe it was in
friendship that Alexander found his sanity.

100
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:57,129
You don't need much to fight.

101
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:03,449
When you're in the front ranks of a battle,
facing some Northern barbarian tribe...

102
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:07,529
...courage won't be in the lining
of your stomach, Nearchus.

103
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:11,489
It's in the heart of a man.

104
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,769
You don't need to eat every day
or until you're full, Ptolemy.

105
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:18,209
You don't need to lie in bed
in a morning...

106
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:22,409
...when you can have some good bean soup,
Cassander, after a forced night march.

107
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:27,449
Come on, Alexander. Come on.

108
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,409
Who will respect you as a king?
You think because of your father?

109
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:36,489
The first rule of war is to do what you
ask your men to do. No more, no less.

110
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:41,409
Good. That's it.

111
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:45,929
Well done, Hephaistion. Good wrestling.
That's what I want.

112
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:47,569
Come, come, come.

113
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:49,449
You did well, but you lost.

114
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:54,889
Now, both of you, congratulate
the other. Go on.

115
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:57,689
Would you want me to let you win,
Alexander?

116
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,809
You're right.

117
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:04,889
But I promise you, I will beat
you one day, Hephaistion.

118
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:11,849
It was said later that Alexander
was never defeated...

119
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,329
...except by Hephaistion's thighs.

120
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:18,969
Although an inferior race...

121
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:23,689
...the Persians control at least
four-fifths of the known world.

122
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:28,889
But is it possible that the source
of Egypt's mighty River Nile...

123
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:32,569
...could rise in these distant
mountains of the outer earth?

124
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:38,569
If so, an experienced navigator
could find his way here...

125
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:43,209
...by this river east, down
into the great plains of India...

126
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:47,769
...out into the eastern ocean
at end of the world...

127
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:51,689
...and by this route up the Nile...

128
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:57,689
...back to Egypt, into the Middle Sea
and home to Greece.

129
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:01,089
Now, if only these frogs
could look outward...

130
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:04,209
...and act on their favored position
at the center...

131
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,209
...Greece could rule the world.

132
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:11,849
Why is it, master, in myth,
these lands you speak of are known?

133
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:18,049
India, where Herakles
and Dionysus traveled.

134
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:23,249
All these men who went east,
Theseus, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.

135
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,289
From generation to generation,
their stories have been passed on.

136
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,969
Why? Unless there was truth to them?

137
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:33,769
Tales of Amazons? No, Alexander.

138
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:37,529
Only common people believe these tales,
as they believe most anything.

139
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:42,169
We are here precisely to educate
ourselves against such foolish passions.

140
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,249
But if we are superior to the Persians,
as you say, why do we not rule them?

141
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:53,569
It is... It has always been
our Greek dream to go east.

142
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:59,529
The East has a way of swallowing
men and their dreams.

143
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,729
Master?

144
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:04,089
- Master?
- Yes?

145
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:05,529
- Master!
- Out with it!

146
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:08,489
- Why are the Persians so cruel?
- Oh, come on, Nearchus.

147
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,809
That is not the subject for today,
Nearchus.

148
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:15,449
But it is true that the Oriental races
are known for their barbarity...

149
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,329
...and their slavish devotion
to their senses.

150
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:22,169
Excess in all things is the undoing of men.

151
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:24,809
That is why we Greeks are superior.

152
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:27,449
We practice control of our senses.

153
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:29,849
Moderation, we hope.

154
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:32,329
And what of Achilles at Troy, master?

155
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:37,249
- Was he not excessive?
- Achilles simply lacks restraint.

156
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:41,209
He dominates others so completely that
even when he withdraws from battle...

157
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,489
...crazed with grief over
his dead lover, Patroclus...

158
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:49,369
...he seriously endangers his own army.
He is a deeply selfish man.

159
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:53,249
Would you say the love between Achilles
and Patroclus is a corrupting one?

160
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:57,729
When men lie together in lust,
it is a surrender to the passions...

161
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,569
...and does nothing
for the excellence in us.

162
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:06,009
Nor does any other excess, Cassander,
jealousy among them.

163
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:11,329
But when men lie together, and knowledge
and virtue are passed between them...

164
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:14,969
...that is pure and excellent.

165
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:19,129
When they compete to bring out the good,
the best in each other...

166
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:23,049
...this is the love between men that
can build a city-state...

167
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,609
...and lift us from our frog pond.

168
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:34,689
Philip brought such as Aristotle from
Athens to educate our rough people.

169
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:39,129
And growing more ambitious, he now
planned the invasion of Persia.

170
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,289
The best you can do, Cleitus? Back
to the phalanx with you, I'll ride him myself.

171
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:51,729
No one will ride that beast, Your Majesty.

172
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:53,809
Not with your leg.

173
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:56,729
He's been beaten far too often.

174
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,449
My noble king,
he's a high-spirited animal, yes.

175
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:04,249
High-spirited and worthy
of Philip of Macedon.

176
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,489
For three and a half talents...

177
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,209
...I couldn't make a profit
on him, but for you...

178
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:12,049
Why would I want such a beast?
I already have a wife.

179
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,489
Do I seem so old?

180
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,689
- Stay down, stay down.
- Hold him!

181
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:42,489
A broken neck comes free. He's
too nervous for battle. Sell him for meat.

182
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:45,889
Buy him for me, Father. I'll ride him.

183
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:51,649
And if you don't?

184
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:55,289
- I'll pay for him myself.
- With what, your singing voice?

185
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,129
I'll pay you!

186
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,609
I tell you, that horse can't be ridden,
lad. His mind is broken.

187
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:06,249
He can be ridden. By me.

188
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,049
If you can rule that horse,
I'll make him yours...

189
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:11,129
...at half the price.

190
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,449
That horse will kill him, Philip.

191
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,649
- He'll break the boy in two.
- Will he?

192
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:18,489
Perhaps she'll make
a musician out of him yet.

193
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:31,609
The boy doesn't have the craft.
He could hurt himself.

194
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:35,449
He'll have to figure that out
for himself. It's time.

195
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:44,489
You don't like your shadow, do you?

196
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:48,449
It's like a dark spirit coming up to get you.

197
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,329
Do you see? That's us.

198
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:56,049
It's just a trick of Apollo's.

199
00:18:56,209 --> 00:19:00,489
He's the god of the sun.

200
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:07,729
But I'll show you how to outwit him,
you and me together.

201
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:31,689
Bucephalus.

202
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:35,649
That's what I'll call you.
Strong and stubborn.

203
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:41,289
Bucephalus and Alexander.

204
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,209
Come now, let's ride together.

205
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,369
He's got some Titan in him yet.

206
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:23,969
Attalus! Cleitus! For Zeus' sake,
he beat you, man!

207
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:31,969
Now, Bucephalus, show them.

208
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:04,849
My son.

209
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,609
My son!

210
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,249
You remember Achilles.

211
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:22,849
- He's my favorite.
- Why?

212
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:26,689
Because he loved Patroclus
and avenged his death.

213
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:28,609
And his fate?

214
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:31,889
That he must die young
but with great glory.

215
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:33,649
Did he have a choice?

216
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:38,049
Yes. He could live a long life,
but there would be no glory.

217
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:42,249
You dream of glory, Alexander.
Your mother encourages you.

218
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:46,529
There's no glory without suffering,
and this she will not allow.

219
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:53,649
One day, I'll be on walls like these.

220
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:59,089
Prometheus stole the secret
of fire and gave it to man.

221
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:01,929
It made Zeus so angry...

222
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:05,049
...he chained Prometheus to a rock
in the Great Caucasus...

223
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:09,369
...and each day, his eagle pecked out
the poor man's liver.

224
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:13,849
Each night, it grew back again so that
it could be eaten the next day.

225
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:15,249
Miserable fate.

226
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,209
Why?

227
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:24,889
Who knows these things?

228
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:26,969
Anyway...

229
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:36,489
Oedipus tore out his eyes when he
found out he'd murdered his father...

230
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:42,489
...and married his mother.
Knowledge that came too late.

231
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:46,449
Medea, she slaughtered
her two children in vengeance...

232
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:49,329
...when Jason left her for a younger wife.

233
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:01,649
My mother would never hurt me.

234
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:05,369
It's never easy to escape our mothers,
Alexander.

235
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:12,169
All your life, beware of women.
They're far more dangerous than men.

236
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:21,369
Herakles. Even after he accomplished
his 12 labors...

237
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:26,009
...he was punished with madness,
slaughtered his three children.

238
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:28,849
Poor Herakles.

239
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:30,969
Great Herakles.

240
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:35,449
All greatness comes from loss.

241
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:41,529
Even you, the gods will
one day judge harshly.

242
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:43,489
When I'm king like you, Father?

243
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:47,289
Don't rush the day, boy. You risk all.

244
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:52,289
My father threw me into battle
before I knew how to fight.

245
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:54,929
When I killed my first man, he said:

246
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:57,209
"Now you know."

247
00:23:57,849 --> 00:24:01,689
I hated him then,
but I understand why now.

248
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:04,089
A king isn't born, Alexander.

249
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:08,169
He's made by steel and by suffering.

250
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:13,169
A king must know
how to hurt those he loves.

251
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:19,129
It's lonely. Ask Herakles.

252
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:23,609
Ask any of them. Fate is cruel.

253
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:30,049
No man or woman can be too powerful
or too beautiful without disaster befalling.

254
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:36,449
They laugh when you rise too high and
crush everything you've built with a whim.

255
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:40,889
What glory they give,
in the end, they take away.

256
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:45,249
They make of us slaves.

257
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,089
Pregnant so soon. The little whore.

258
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:18,409
He will marry her in the spring,
during Dionysus' Festival...

259
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:21,249
...and when her first son is born...

260
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:26,529
...her sweet uncle Attalus will convince
Philip to name the boy his successor...

261
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:29,089
...with himself as regent.

262
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:31,129
And you...

263
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:35,169
...you will be sent on
some impossible mission...

264
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:37,809
...against some monstrous Northern tribe...

265
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:43,209
...to be mutilated in one more
meaningless battle over cattle.

266
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:47,089
And I, no longer queen,
will be put to death...

267
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:51,129
...with your sister and the remaining
members of our family.

268
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:55,849
I wish sometimes you could see
the light, Mother.

269
00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:00,569
The truth is, he's taken nothing from you
that you've not been long without.

270
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:04,369
The only way is to strike.

271
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,169
Announce your marriage
to a Macedonian now.

272
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:11,849
Beget a child of pure blood. He would
be one of them, not mine...

273
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:15,289
...and he would have no choice
but to make you king.

274
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,449
There is still Kynnane.

275
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,889
Eurydice was perfect. If your father,
that pig, had not ravaged her first!

276
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:25,769
Say nothing more of my father.

277
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:28,769
Do you hear me? Say nothing.

278
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:31,249
You're right.

279
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:34,169
Forgive me.

280
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:37,049
A mother loves too much.

281
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:45,529
Who shall I sing to sleep
at night anymore?

282
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:55,249
I wish... I wish we could spend
more time together.

283
00:26:55,969 --> 00:27:00,209
Like we used to, when you were
the sweetest boy.

284
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:07,329
There's never been time, Mother.

285
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:12,889
Since I was a child, I've been groomed
to be ever the best.

286
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:18,129
My poor child, you're like Achilles...

287
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:20,649
...cursed by your greatness.

288
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:27,009
Take my strength.

289
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:38,689
You must never confuse your feelings
with your duties, Alexander.

290
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:44,489
A king must make public gestures
for the common people.

291
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:47,969
I know, but you will be 19 this summer...

292
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:52,609
...and the girls already say you don't
like them. You like Hephaistion more.

293
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:56,089
I understand.
It's natural for a young man.

294
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:00,249
But if you go to Asia without leaving
your successor, you risk all.

295
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:06,369
Hephaistion loves me,
as I am...

296
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:07,849
...not who.

297
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:12,609
Loves? Loves?

298
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:17,009
In the name of Dionysus...

299
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:23,769
...understand how Philip thinks,
for your own sake.

300
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:27,849
Your life hangs in the balance.

301
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:32,769
- His spies are inside your closest circle.
- Stop!

302
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:37,689
I'm his only worthy son.

303
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,649
You crazed woman.

304
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:42,649
He'd never hurt me.

305
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:48,289
Even if Eurydice had a boy,
he'd be 20 before he'd let him rule.

306
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:51,729
Yes, and you would be 40.

307
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:58,049
Old and wise like Parmenion.
And Philip's young son would be 20.

308
00:28:58,209 --> 00:29:04,289
Like you now,
but raised by him, his blood.

309
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:07,769
He will never give you
the throne now, Alexander.

310
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:10,329
Never.

311
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:29,929
Come, Alexander,
drink this sadness away.

312
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:32,409
If only thirst could quench sorrow,
Ptolemy.

313
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:39,729
There's only one thing better
than winning a battle, son...

314
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:43,049
...and that's the taste of a new woman.

315
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:48,049
You'll find it far sweeter than self-pity.

316
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:50,809
Pausanias, you bore me.
Be gone with you.

317
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:53,049
Alexander, I found you the right girl.

318
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,649
- What's your name, darling?
- Antigone.

319
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:57,729
- What's your name?
- Antigone.

320
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:01,649
I love you, my little imp.

321
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:04,449
And I love you, Cleitus.

322
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:07,049
- Please, no!
- There you go.

323
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:10,809
Would you prefer a seat, Cleitus?

324
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,809
I'll sleep in my grave, Hephaistion.

325
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:16,209
While alive, I prefer dancing.

326
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:17,809
Pausanias.

327
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:20,249
Who's your new friend?

328
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:22,969
- There's your new friend.
- Please don't!

329
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,529
A toast.

330
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:27,929
A toast!

331
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:33,889
I drink to our Greek friends
and to our new union...

332
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:39,729
...Macedonia and Greece,
equals in greatness!

333
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:48,329
And to Philip, our king, without whom
this union could not be possible.

334
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:51,329
Come, Attalus, leave some
damn air in the hall!

335
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:58,489
And last, I drink to the king's marriage
to my niece, Eurydice...

336
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,569
...a Macedonian queen we can be proud of!

337
00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:07,609
To Philip and Eurydice...

338
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:10,809
...and to their legitimate sons!

339
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,009
Alexander, don't!

340
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:17,049
What am I, you son of a dog?
Come, then.

341
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:31,569
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

342
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:33,569
Shut up, all of you!

343
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:36,449
This is my wedding,
not some public brawl.

344
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:38,529
Insolent pup.

345
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,809
Apologize, by Zeus,
before you dishonor me.

346
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:45,209
You defend the man who called
my mother a whore and me a bastard.

347
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:48,449
- And I dishonor you?
- You listen like your mother.

348
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:50,729
Attalus is my family now,
the same as you.

349
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:53,409
Then choose your relatives
more carefully.

350
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:56,649
Don't expect me to sit here
and watch you shame yourself.

351
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:59,689
- You insult me!
- I insult you!

352
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:02,809
A man not fit to lick the ground
my mother walks on.

353
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:05,769
- You dog, questioning your queen.
- Shame?

354
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:09,609
I've nothing to be ashamed of,
you arrogant brat.

355
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,449
I'll marry the girl if I want,
and I'll have as many sons as I want.

356
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:16,049
There's nothing you
or your harpy mother can do.

357
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:18,049
Why, drunken man, must you think...

358
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,609
...everything I do and say
comes from my mother?

359
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:23,609
Because I know her heart, by Hera...

360
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:25,849
...and I see her in your eyes.

361
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:28,369
You covet this throne too much.

362
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:34,809
We all know that she-wolf
of a mother of yours wants me dead.

363
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:37,209
Well, you can both dream, boy.

364
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:40,369
Philip, this is the wine talking.
Leave the boy. It'll wait.

365
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:42,009
Now!

366
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,969
I command you.

367
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:49,089
Apologize to your kinsman.

368
00:32:56,449 --> 00:32:58,089
Apologize.

369
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:00,729
No kinsman to me.

370
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:06,009
Good night, old man.

371
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:11,689
And when my mother remarries,
I'll invite you to her wedding.

372
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,089
You bastard!

373
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:21,249
You'll obey me. Come here.

374
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:43,329
And this is the man who is going
to take you from Greece to Persia?

375
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,929
He can't even make it
from one couch to the next.

376
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:50,009
Get out of my palace!
You're exiled, you bastard!

377
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:53,889
Banished from the land.
You're not welcome here.

378
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:56,889
You're no son of mine!

379
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:05,769
Everything suddenly changed for him.

380
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:11,969
His father, King Philip, was murdered.

381
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:15,129
And Alexander, at 20...

382
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:20,049
...became the new ruler of Macedonia.

383
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:25,289
And breaking their treaties with us,
dismissing Alexander as an untried boy...

384
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:29,609
...several Greek city-states
rose up in revolt...

385
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:35,129
...much to Persia's delight
and perhaps sponsored by their gold.

386
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:42,249
Truly, Alexander could love like no other.

387
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:46,969
But to betray him was to rouse
a vast and frightening anger.

388
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:50,929
And he massacred several thousand
men of that tragic city, Thebes...

389
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,289
...and sold the survivors into slavery.

390
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,529
This, as intended,
stunned and defeated the Greeks.

391
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:03,329
And though, in the end, he treated
most populations with magnanimity...

392
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:05,369
...it is these exceptions...

393
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:10,969
...Thebes, Gaza in Syria and, later,
Persepolis in Persia and others...

394
00:35:11,129 --> 00:35:16,369
...that are always remembered by those
who hate Alexander and all he stood for.

395
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:23,209
At 21, Alexander invaded Asia
with an army of 40,000 trained men.

396
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:26,649
And liberating one city-state
after the other...

397
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:30,649
...he conquered all of western Asia
south to Egypt...

398
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:36,529
...where he was declared Pharaoh
of Egypt, worshipped as a god.

399
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:43,849
It was in Egypt that the
respected oracle at Siwah...

400
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,529
...declared him the...

401
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:50,009
...true son of Zeus.

402
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:55,129
He finally provoked
Darius himself to battle...

403
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:59,329
...in the heart of the Persian Empire,
near Babylon.

404
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:06,329
It was mad.

405
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:12,009
Forty thousand of us
against 250,000 barbarians.

406
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:18,729
It was the day Alexander
had waited for all his life.

407
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:25,529
Alexander, son of a god.

408
00:36:26,169 --> 00:36:28,089
It was a myth, of course.

409
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:31,049
At least it started as a myth.

410
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:33,249
I know.

411
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:35,609
I was there.

412
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:37,049
I saw his eyes.

413
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:39,009
There.

414
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:43,049
In the crack of the Persian line,
we'll go for the head.

415
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:44,969
Kill Darius?

416
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:48,169
The gods have brought him
to us at last.

417
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:51,289
If I die, it's one Macedonian.

418
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:55,049
But the Persians, they cannot move
without Darius' command.

419
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:56,689
Here.

420
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:59,409
Right here, we cut the throat
of the Persian Army.

421
00:36:59,569 --> 00:37:02,729
This is madness. You'll never get
within 100 paces of him.

422
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:04,969
Have you seen the sheer size
of his force?

423
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:09,249
Not if you hold them on the left,
my brave Parmenion...

424
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:13,689
...with your son Philotas,
for just one, two hours tomorrow.

425
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:19,609
And you, unbreakable Antigonus,
the center phalanx.

426
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:21,529
Perdiccas.

427
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:23,769
Leonnatus.

428
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:25,769
Nearchus.

429
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:27,649
Polyperchon.

430
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:31,769
If you pin them on the walls
of your sarissas here, in the center...

431
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:34,809
...their cavalry will follow me
out to the right.

432
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:37,209
And when bold Cassander breaks...

433
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:40,249
...stretching their left, a hole will open.

434
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:41,969
Then I and my cavalry...

435
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:47,769
...our revered Cleitus,
Ptolemy and Hephaistion...

436
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:49,849
...will strike through that gap...

437
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:53,209
...and deal the deathblow
to Darius' head.

438
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:57,009
Alexander, even with luck, timing,
the gods, we must rout them tomorrow.

439
00:37:57,169 --> 00:37:58,809
Destroy their army completely.

440
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:02,409
Or we'll be picked apart by bandit tribes
on the long journey home.

441
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:04,609
Right.

442
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:07,009
You speak of home.

443
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:09,129
And retreat.

444
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,889
But do you understand, Parmenion...

445
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:15,529
...Babylon's my new home?

446
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:19,449
Alexander...

447
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:21,609
...if we must fight...

448
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,129
...do so with stealth.

449
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:28,089
Use your numbers well. We should attack
tonight when they least expect us.

450
00:38:29,689 --> 00:38:33,249
I didn't cross Asia
to steal this victory, Cassander.

451
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:36,409
No, you are too honorable for that.

452
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:41,609
No doubt influenced from sleeping
with Tales of Troy under your pillow.

453
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:45,169
But your father
was no lover of Homer's.

454
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:48,169
The lands west
of the Euphrates, Alexander...

455
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:52,489
...the hand of his daughter in marriage.
When has a Greek been given such honors?

456
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:56,449
These are not honors.
Parmenion, they're bribes...

457
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:59,809
...which the Greeks
have accepted too long.

458
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:04,049
Do you forget the man who murdered
my father lies across the valley?

459
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:08,889
Alexander, we're still not sure if it was
Persian gold behind the assassination.

460
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:12,969
- That is no matter!
- Parmenion, you know that's not true.

461
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,609
Your father taught you never to surrender
your reason to your passion.

462
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:20,569
Now I urge you, regroup.

463
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:23,729
Fall back to the coast,
raise a larger force.

464
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:28,009
I would, if I were Parmenion.

465
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:30,569
But I am Alexander.

466
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:34,569
And no more than Earth has two suns
will Asia bear two kings.

467
00:39:35,169 --> 00:39:36,649
These are my terms.

468
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:41,209
And if Darius isn't a coward
who hides behind his men...

469
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:44,569
...then he'll come to me tomorrow.

470
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:50,169
And when he bows down to Greece...

471
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:52,969
...Alexander will be merciful.

472
00:39:57,409 --> 00:40:01,049
By Ares' chains, he's got balls, men.

473
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:03,929
I mean, give the man his due,
Parmenion.

474
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:09,529
And, lads, feast tonight,
for tomorrow we will dine in Hades.

475
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:23,409
To whom do you pray?

476
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:28,729
Phobos.

477
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:32,449
Fear?

478
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:37,089
A bad omen.

479
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:41,329
More so for Darius.

480
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:52,049
I've come to believe that fear
of death drives all men, Hephaistion.

481
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:55,129
This we didn't learn as schoolboys.

482
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:59,129
It is the cause of all our misfortunes.

483
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,689
- So, mighty Crateros.
- Your Majesty.

484
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,609
- Are you ready for tomorrow's dawn?
- It's been too long coming.

485
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:11,649
- The men are skittish as colts.
- Good.

486
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:14,049
Fear makes men fight better.

487
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:17,089
Post your sentries alertly
but rest them well.

488
00:41:17,249 --> 00:41:21,329
Don't worry, general. I'm known to sleep
with my eyes open as a baby's arse.

489
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:25,089
Only because someone
might steal his loot, sire.

490
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:28,969
After tomorrow, even the thrifty
among you shall be kings.

491
00:41:29,129 --> 00:41:33,889
The gods are with us, Your Majesty.
You'll stain the ground with Persian blood.

492
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,049
I've always believed, Alexander.

493
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:41,049
But this seems so much bigger than us.

494
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:45,489
Did Patroclus doubt Achilles when
they stood side by side at the siege of Troy?

495
00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:48,489
Patroclus died first.

496
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:50,249
If you do...

497
00:41:51,129 --> 00:41:55,369
If you were to fall, Hephaistion,
even if Macedonia were to lose a king...

498
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:58,129
...I will avenge you...

499
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:00,969
...and follow you down
to the house of death.

500
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:03,569
I would do the same.

501
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:17,209
On the eve of battle,
it's hardest to be alone.

502
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:23,209
Then perhaps...

503
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:27,969
Perhaps this is farewell...

504
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,769
...my Alexander.

505
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:33,569
Fear not, Hephaistion.

506
00:42:34,649 --> 00:42:37,049
We are at the beginning.

507
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:13,409
Blood makes the world rise.

508
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:17,849
Blood makes the rain fall.

509
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:24,289
Blood makes the earth grow.

510
00:43:25,209 --> 00:43:31,449
And in blood, all men are born and die.

511
00:43:33,129 --> 00:43:38,609
Blood is the food of the gods below.

512
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:55,609
Come, Bucephalus.
Today we ride to our destiny.

513
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:02,129
Company, group! Regroup!

514
00:44:13,009 --> 00:44:15,929
Phalanx, turn right!

515
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:36,809
Phalanx, attention!

516
00:44:57,289 --> 00:44:59,849
Neoptolemus.

517
00:45:00,009 --> 00:45:02,969
I remember you the day
you took the siege tower at Tire.

518
00:45:03,129 --> 00:45:06,289
You were a giant.
And today, how will you fight?

519
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:14,089
Dexippos, by Athena.

520
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:18,249
How far was it you threw your man
wrestling at the last Olympic Games?

521
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:20,929
Will you match it with your spear?

522
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:30,409
And Timander, son of Menander,
a great soldier to my father.

523
00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:35,089
I still mourn your brother, Addaios,
who died so bravely at Halicarnassus.

524
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:38,689
What an honored family
you descend from, Timander.

525
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:41,689
You fight for them today.

526
00:45:43,049 --> 00:45:48,889
You've all honored
your country and your ancestors.

527
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:53,609
And now we come to this
most distant place in Asia...

528
00:45:53,929 --> 00:46:00,129
...where across from us, Darius
has at last gathered a vast army...

529
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:33,009
But ask yourselves, who is this great king
who pays assassins in gold coins...

530
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:35,609
...to murder my father, our king...

531
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:40,409
...in a most despicable
and cowardly manner?

532
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:45,609
Who is this great king, Darius,
who enslaves his own men to fight?

533
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:50,049
Who is this king but a king of air?

534
00:46:50,249 --> 00:46:53,329
These men do not fight for their homes.

535
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:56,849
They fight because
this king tells them they must.

536
00:46:57,449 --> 00:47:00,809
And when they fight,
they will melt away like the air...

537
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:03,929
...because they know no loyalty
to a king of slaves.

538
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:08,169
But we are not here today as slaves.

539
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:10,369
We are here today...

540
00:47:10,529 --> 00:47:14,129
...as Macedonian freemen!

541
00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:29,849
Some of you...

542
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,769
...perhaps myself...

543
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:38,569
...will not live to see the sun set
over these mountains today.

544
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:41,449
But I say to you...

545
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:45,369
...what every warrior has known
since the beginning of time.

546
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,849
Conquer your fear...

547
00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:51,329
...and I promise you,
you will conquer death.

548
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:16,969
When they ask why you fought
so bravely, you will answer:

549
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:19,929
"I was here this day at Gaugamela...

550
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:24,289
...for the freedom...

551
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,329
...and glory...

552
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:32,569
...of Greece!"

553
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,409
Zeus be with us!

554
00:49:07,249 --> 00:49:10,689
Cassander! Four columns, go!

555
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:17,809
Where does he go?

556
00:49:17,969 --> 00:49:20,209
I don't know, Majesty.

557
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:23,169
Envelop him, Bessus.

558
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:29,649
Hephaistion, go!

559
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:40,449
Phalanx!

560
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:01,329
He makes a mistake, Pharnakes.

561
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:05,849
Yes, great king.

562
00:51:05,449 --> 00:51:07,889
Be brave, men.

563
00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:10,769
Steady on the left, lads!

564
00:51:11,249 --> 00:51:13,529
Bend if you must, but never break.

565
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:16,769
And keep watching the cavalry on the left.

566
00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:47,649
Pick up the pace!

567
00:51:57,049 --> 00:52:00,609
Prepare to repel chariots!

568
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:24,409
Cassander!

569
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:26,809
Forward, men!

570
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:41,249
- Left turn!
- Infantry, clear! Out now!

571
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:29,129
Hold your positions!

572
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:32,009
Hold your positions!

573
00:54:48,769 --> 00:54:50,769
We must fall back to the gully, Father.

574
00:54:50,929 --> 00:54:52,369
No, hold.

575
00:54:52,529 --> 00:54:56,289
Where is he? We're far too thin!
Get word to Alexander!

576
00:54:56,449 --> 00:54:58,729
- Move!
- Yes, sir.

577
00:55:16,529 --> 00:55:19,929
Come, Macedonians! Ride! Ride!

578
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:28,689
- Shields, break off!
- Break off.

579
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:31,089
The shields are here!

580
00:55:32,169 --> 00:55:34,449
Drive for the hole!

581
00:55:34,929 --> 00:55:37,889
- Drive for the hole!
- Drive for the hole!

582
00:56:19,249 --> 00:56:22,489
Back and to the left!
Back and to the left!

583
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:27,329
- Philotas! Philotas!
- Father.

584
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:29,449
Go. Tell Alexander yourself.

585
00:56:29,609 --> 00:56:35,329
And if he won't listen, then survive me
and avenge this betrayal!

586
00:56:51,329 --> 00:56:55,729
Pay attention, lad!
Your father still watches over you!

587
00:57:35,689 --> 00:57:38,209
Darius!

588
00:57:38,409 --> 00:57:40,369
Find your horses.

589
00:57:55,529 --> 00:57:57,849
Darius!

590
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:20,529
Go! Go!

591
00:58:35,249 --> 00:58:39,609
We can reach those mountains by sunset,
go all night and catch Darius at dawn.

592
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:42,689
Provision the horses.

593
00:58:42,849 --> 00:58:46,649
Alexander!
Alexander, my father's lost.

594
00:58:46,809 --> 00:58:49,729
They've overrun the flank.
They're into the baggage train.

595
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:51,929
Parmenion's crumbling.

596
00:58:52,089 --> 00:58:56,369
Alexander, if you chase him,
you risk losing your army here.

597
00:58:56,529 --> 00:58:59,849
And if we capture him,
we gain an empire.

598
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:11,009
You can run to the ends of the earth,
you coward...

599
00:59:11,169 --> 00:59:14,049
...but you'll never run far enough!

600
00:59:14,209 --> 00:59:16,809
To Parmenion!

601
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:37,889
You bleed free, my lord.

602
00:59:38,049 --> 00:59:41,289
- May I tend to your wound?
- No, Hermolaus, not now.

603
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:43,569
There's far worse than me. Go to them.

604
00:59:43,729 --> 00:59:45,449
Help them.

605
01:00:11,929 --> 01:00:15,049
- Your Majesty.
- You're very brave.

606
01:00:16,009 --> 01:00:17,769
What shall I call you?

607
01:00:17,929 --> 01:00:20,649
- Glaukos, my king.
- Glaukos.

608
01:00:21,649 --> 01:00:25,409
- And where's your home?
- Illyria.

609
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:28,969
Let your body go loose.

610
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,289
Think of home now.

611
01:00:32,489 --> 01:00:34,849
Be brave again, Glaukos...

612
01:00:36,209 --> 01:00:38,649
...and you will live on in glory.

613
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:41,529
Alexander.

614
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:54,969
The Persian Empire,
the greatest the world had yet known...

615
01:00:55,129 --> 01:00:57,249
...was destroyed.

616
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:10,089
And Alexander, at 25,
was now king of all.

617
01:01:21,409 --> 01:01:23,489
Alexander once said to me:

618
01:01:23,689 --> 01:01:28,329
"We are most alone
when we are with the myths."

619
01:01:29,129 --> 01:01:30,849
Phalanx!

620
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:38,929
And thus, it came to pass in a dream...

621
01:01:39,089 --> 01:01:42,889
...as mythical to all Greeks
as Achilles defeating the Trojans.

622
01:01:43,049 --> 01:01:46,129
At this one glorious moment in time...

623
01:01:46,289 --> 01:01:50,329
...Alexander was loved by all.

624
01:01:52,649 --> 01:01:57,009
But in the end, I believe Babylon
was a far easier mistress to enter...

625
01:01:57,169 --> 01:01:59,849
...than she was to leave.

626
01:02:47,929 --> 01:02:52,249
Sikander! Sikander!

627
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:23,169
Imagine the minds that conceived this.
With architects and engineers like these...

628
01:03:23,329 --> 01:03:25,649
...we could build cities
as we've only dreamed.

629
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:30,409
Aristotle may have called them barbarians,
but he never saw Babylon.

630
01:03:30,569 --> 01:03:35,969
We have enough gold here to support
three generations of Macedonian armies.

631
01:03:36,169 --> 01:03:38,649
And Macedonia would soon corrupt,
Cassander.

632
01:03:39,089 --> 01:03:42,289
Wealth in great quantities brings the crows.

633
01:03:44,689 --> 01:03:47,889
Not for the men who fought, I trust.

634
01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:52,049
We'll pay them well, Antigonus,
but not as mercenaries for future services.

635
01:03:52,209 --> 01:03:53,809
Now you sound like Philip.

636
01:03:54,809 --> 01:03:56,529
Philip never saw Babylon.

637
01:03:57,169 --> 01:03:59,089
No, he didn't, Hephaistion.

638
01:04:00,689 --> 01:04:02,769
- Hello!
- Hello!

639
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:06,329
Alexander, I know you think me
a stiff old sod...

640
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:08,929
...but whatever our differences,
know this day...

641
01:04:09,089 --> 01:04:12,449
...your father would be very proud of you.

642
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:15,809
Thank you, Parmenion.

643
01:04:16,569 --> 01:04:20,929
I ask you to forgive me
my own anger, my pride.

644
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:23,209
They, too, blind me.

645
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:31,289
Yes, the grandsons of goat herders...

646
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:34,329
...we now rule 2 million square miles.

647
01:04:34,489 --> 01:04:37,809
Not if you keep giving it all away.

648
01:04:38,569 --> 01:04:43,769
None of you fear that this great fortune
may drive us all to destruction.

649
01:04:44,169 --> 01:04:45,889
You overvalue us.

650
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:49,569
For as long as Darius breathes,
he is the legitimate king of Asia...

651
01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:51,969
...and I but the king of air.

652
01:04:52,129 --> 01:04:56,969
But he has no power, Alexander.
He's lost in the mountains with no army.

653
01:04:57,129 --> 01:05:00,409
As long as he's lost, Philotas,
he can be believed in.

654
01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:03,769
Only when he's found will it be decided.

655
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:07,449
It seems you've already
made up your mind.

656
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:10,409
We must finish what we failed
to do at Gaugamela.

657
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:12,329
We must hunt Darius down to.

658
01:05:12,489 --> 01:05:15,809
- That was not your father's mission.
- And I am not my father.

659
01:05:18,369 --> 01:05:20,809
Come on. Have you so quickly forgotten?

660
01:05:20,969 --> 01:05:22,569
Fortune favors the bold.

661
01:05:26,369 --> 01:05:27,729
By the gods, what is this?

662
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:30,769
No wonder Darius fled
when he had this to come back to.

663
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:34,369
I venture one for every night of the year.

664
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:01,449
Help me, Aphrodite.

665
01:06:01,609 --> 01:06:03,889
How will I go back to Lysimache
after this?

666
01:06:04,049 --> 01:06:08,809
I advise you not to touch, Leonnatus.
Here, I'll take care of it for you.

667
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:10,569
Apologies.

668
01:06:48,969 --> 01:06:51,129
Aristotle was perhaps prescient.

669
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:56,769
Do these images fool us with their beauty
and degrade our souls?

670
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:16,529
Great King Alexander.

671
01:07:19,129 --> 01:07:21,249
The princess of the thousand roses...

672
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:24,489
...and eldest daughter of the formerly
Great King Darius...

673
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,609
...Stateira.

674
01:07:28,249 --> 01:07:29,849
Noble Alexander...

675
01:07:36,649 --> 01:07:39,569
...I come to beg for the lives...

676
01:07:40,009 --> 01:07:41,529
...of my sisters...

677
01:07:42,529 --> 01:07:45,289
...my mother, my grandmother.

678
01:07:49,729 --> 01:07:53,649
You are not wrong, Princess Stateira.

679
01:07:53,809 --> 01:07:55,849
He, too, is Alexander.

680
01:07:59,529 --> 01:08:00,689
Please.

681
01:08:01,689 --> 01:08:05,129
I plead for my family's lives.

682
01:08:06,409 --> 01:08:09,409
- Sell me as a slave, great king, but...
- Look now...

683
01:08:09,569 --> 01:08:11,609
...in my eyes...

684
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:13,929
...princess...

685
01:08:15,889 --> 01:08:17,409
...and tell me...

686
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:20,049
...how would you like to be treated?

687
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:24,449
As I am...

688
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:26,569
...a princess.

689
01:08:29,649 --> 01:08:31,369
Then so be it.

690
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:35,969
You and your family shall
be treated as my family.

691
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:41,569
You shall live in this palace
as long as you choose.

692
01:08:41,929 --> 01:08:45,449
Have you any other requests for me,
my noble princess?

693
01:08:47,889 --> 01:08:49,409
No.

694
01:08:50,369 --> 01:08:53,329
Everything I wish...

695
01:08:53,489 --> 01:08:55,209
...I have...

696
01:08:57,089 --> 01:08:58,369
Requested.

697
01:08:58,529 --> 01:09:00,529
Requested.

698
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:04,489
You truly are...

699
01:09:04,649 --> 01:09:05,929
...a queen.

700
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:15,209
Yes, she would be
a perfect match for you...

701
01:09:15,849 --> 01:09:17,649
...but you do nothing.

702
01:09:17,809 --> 01:09:21,249
Three months you've been in Babylon
and leave me in Pella...

703
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:25,129
...at the mercy of your enemies,
of which you have many.

704
01:09:25,289 --> 01:09:28,849
Antipater, accustomed now to the power
that you have given him.

705
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:31,449
I must watch him grow stronger.

706
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:41,369
I'm certain that he communicates secretly
with Parmenion, who is dangerous.

707
01:09:41,529 --> 01:09:44,449
But beware, most of all,
of those closest to you.

708
01:09:44,849 --> 01:09:46,049
They are like snakes...

709
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,409
...and can be turned.

710
01:09:48,569 --> 01:09:50,129
General Crateros.

711
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:56,449
Cassander is Antipater's son.

712
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:00,049
Even Cleitus, your father's favorite...

713
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:03,129
...and Ptolemy, your friend, yes.

714
01:10:03,289 --> 01:10:05,449
But beware of men who think too much.

715
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:08,169
They blind themselves.

716
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:13,369
Only Hephaistion do I leave out.

717
01:10:14,409 --> 01:10:16,929
But all of them you make rich...

718
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:22,689
...while your mother and yourself,
you leave in generous poverty.

719
01:10:23,449 --> 01:10:26,769
Why won't you ever believe me?

720
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:32,369
It is only a dark mind like mine
that can know these secrets of the heart.

721
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:35,009
For they are dark, Alexander.

722
01:10:35,169 --> 01:10:37,449
So dark.

723
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,049
But in you...

724
01:10:39,209 --> 01:10:43,849
...the son of Zeus,
lies the light of the world.

725
01:10:44,009 --> 01:10:47,889
Your companions will be shadows
in the underworld...

726
01:10:48,049 --> 01:10:52,249
...when you are a name living forever
in history as the most glorious...

727
01:10:52,409 --> 01:10:56,649
...shining light of youth, forever young,
forever inspiring.

728
01:10:56,809 --> 01:11:00,169
Never will there be an Alexander like you.

729
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:03,169
Alexander the Great.

730
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:07,329
Remember, bring me to Babylon
as you promised.

731
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,569
I can only help you, for they know
if they harm you...

732
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:14,849
...they will face my wrath,
as Queen of Babylon.

733
01:11:16,329 --> 01:11:19,769
It's a high ransom she charges
for nine months' lodging in the womb.

734
01:11:19,929 --> 01:11:21,849
Bring her, Alexander.

735
01:11:22,009 --> 01:11:25,009
- It'll give her such joy.
- Joy?

736
01:11:25,769 --> 01:11:28,889
When I'm the cracked mirror
of her dreams?

737
01:11:31,449 --> 01:11:34,009
Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion.

738
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:42,009
I'll take my own bath.

739
01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:44,449
Thank you, Bagoas.

740
01:12:00,489 --> 01:12:04,329
The generals question your obsession
with Darius.

741
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:07,529
They say it was never meant
for you to be king of Asia.

742
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:09,169
Naturally.

743
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:13,489
They want only to return to their homes,
rich with gold. But I've seen the future.

744
01:12:13,649 --> 01:12:16,809
I've seen it now 1000 times,
on 1000 faces.

745
01:12:16,969 --> 01:12:19,009
These people want...

746
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:22,009
Need change.

747
01:12:22,769 --> 01:12:25,329
Aristotle was wrong about them.

748
01:12:25,489 --> 01:12:27,329
How so?

749
01:12:27,489 --> 01:12:29,289
Look at those we've conquered.

750
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:31,409
They leave their dead unburied.

751
01:12:31,569 --> 01:12:34,409
They smash their enemies' skulls
and drink them as dust.

752
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:36,489
They mate in public.

753
01:12:36,649 --> 01:12:41,329
What can they think or sing or write
when none can read?

754
01:12:41,489 --> 01:12:45,929
But as Alexander's army, they can go
where they never thought possible.

755
01:12:46,089 --> 01:12:49,049
They can soldier or work in the cities.

756
01:12:49,209 --> 01:12:53,249
The Alexandrias,
from Egypt to the outer ocean.

757
01:12:53,729 --> 01:12:56,529
We could connect these lands,
Hephaistion...

758
01:12:56,689 --> 01:12:57,889
...and the people.

759
01:12:58,049 --> 01:13:03,449
Some say these Alexandrias have become
extensions of Alexander himself.

760
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:07,129
They draw people into the cities
to make slaves of them.

761
01:13:07,289 --> 01:13:12,329
But we freed them, Hephaistion, from
the Persia where everyone lived as slaves.

762
01:13:13,329 --> 01:13:16,449
To free the people of the world...

763
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:21,009
...such would be beyond the glory
of Achilles, beyond Herakles...

764
01:13:21,169 --> 01:13:23,689
...a feat to rival Prometheus...

765
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:27,009
...who was always a friend to man.

766
01:13:27,209 --> 01:13:29,449
Remember the fates of these heroes.

767
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:33,649
- They suffered greatly.
- We all suffer.

768
01:13:34,089 --> 01:13:37,489
Your father, mine.

769
01:13:38,249 --> 01:13:40,249
They all came to the end of their time.

770
01:13:40,409 --> 01:13:44,289
And in the end, when it's over,
all that matters is what you've done.

771
01:13:45,569 --> 01:13:50,169
You once said,
"The fear of death drives all men."

772
01:13:50,489 --> 01:13:52,449
Are there no other forces?

773
01:13:53,449 --> 01:13:56,289
Is there not love in your life...

774
01:13:57,569 --> 01:13:59,489
...Alexander?

775
01:14:06,089 --> 01:14:11,129
I wonder sometimes if it's not
your mother you run from.

776
01:14:12,249 --> 01:14:16,289
So many years,
so many miles between you.

777
01:14:17,609 --> 01:14:19,489
What is it you fear?

778
01:14:20,969 --> 01:14:23,129
Who knows these things?

779
01:14:24,649 --> 01:14:29,569
When I was a child, my mother thought
me divine. My father, weak.

780
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,569
Which am I, Hephaistion?

781
01:14:34,729 --> 01:14:36,769
Weak or divine?

782
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:41,289
All I know is...

783
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:44,369
...I trust only you in this world.

784
01:14:44,529 --> 01:14:46,529
I've missed you.

785
01:14:47,209 --> 01:14:48,489
I need you.

786
01:14:50,249 --> 01:14:52,049
It is you I love, Hephaistion.

787
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:56,249
No other.

788
01:15:00,809 --> 01:15:03,809
You still hold your head cocked.

789
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:06,649
- Like that.
- I've stopped that.

790
01:15:06,809 --> 01:15:08,649
Like a deer, listening in the wind.

791
01:15:08,809 --> 01:15:11,529
You strike me still, Alexander.

792
01:15:12,969 --> 01:15:15,449
And you have eyes like no other.

793
01:15:16,809 --> 01:15:20,809
I sound as stupid as a schoolboy, but...

794
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:26,249
...you're everything I care for...

795
01:15:26,409 --> 01:15:29,889
...and by the sweet breath of Aphrodite...

796
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:33,409
...I'm so jealous of losing you
to this world you want.

797
01:15:33,609 --> 01:15:36,129
You'll never lose me, Hephaistion.

798
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:39,849
I'll be with you always.

799
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:42,289
Till the end.

800
01:15:55,129 --> 01:15:57,689
The campaign in the northeast of Persia...

801
01:15:57,849 --> 01:16:02,889
...turned into a hard guerrilla war
of almost three years.

802
01:16:05,289 --> 01:16:11,049
We chased Darius towards Bactria
but missed taking him by hours.

803
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:16,049
He was dying when we found him, sire.

804
01:16:16,209 --> 01:16:18,049
He asked for water.

805
01:16:18,209 --> 01:16:20,489
He drank and died.

806
01:16:26,889 --> 01:16:31,369
The Great King Darius had been betrayed
by his own commanders.

807
01:16:58,289 --> 01:17:00,209
Fully honoring his corpse...

808
01:17:00,369 --> 01:17:05,489
...Alexander hunted down
these commanders into unknown lands...

809
01:17:06,009 --> 01:17:10,649
...crossing even beyond
the River Oxus into Sogdia.

810
01:17:14,689 --> 01:17:18,849
We fought them as far as
the unknown steppes of Scythia...

811
01:17:19,529 --> 01:17:22,689
...where only legendary heroes
had once trod.

812
01:17:22,849 --> 01:17:28,049
The surveyors told us we were now on
the borders of where Europe and Asia meet.

813
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:31,729
In fact, we were totally lost.

814
01:17:32,729 --> 01:17:35,649
Here, Alexander founded
his 10th Alexandria...

815
01:17:35,809 --> 01:17:40,969
...and settled it with veterans, their women
and any who would dare the frontier life.

816
01:17:41,929 --> 01:17:44,849
Unable to accept defeat in any form...

817
01:17:45,009 --> 01:17:49,249
...Alexander persisted in breaking
every tribe that resisted...

818
01:17:49,409 --> 01:17:53,169
...until the day he received the head
of his last enemy in surrender.

819
01:17:57,729 --> 01:18:02,169
For Alexander, there could be
no pretender to the throne of Asia...

820
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:07,529
...which now included all
of Sogdia and Bactria.

821
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:15,209
It was here that Alexander made
one of his most mysterious decisions.

822
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:51,129
Her eyes tell me
she cares for you, Alexander.

823
01:19:52,689 --> 01:19:54,009
Perhaps too much.

824
01:19:56,289 --> 01:19:58,689
In the ways of my country...

825
01:19:58,849 --> 01:20:03,369
...those who love too much
lose everything...

826
01:20:03,529 --> 01:20:06,489
...and those who love with irony...

827
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:09,129
...last.

828
01:20:21,089 --> 01:20:25,449
Your father must be turning in his grave.
After all this, a hill chief's daughter.

829
01:20:25,649 --> 01:20:27,849
By Athena's justice, this girl has spirit.

830
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:31,569
But what's the point, Alexander?
Just take her as your concubine.

831
01:20:31,729 --> 01:20:34,449
Because I want a son.
Damn you, Philotas.

832
01:20:34,609 --> 01:20:39,089
Then half your nobles have sisters
who'd make fine Macedonian mothers.

833
01:20:39,249 --> 01:20:43,089
To take an Asian as my queen,
not a captive, is a sign of deep respect.

834
01:20:43,249 --> 01:20:45,329
It will bring us together, unify us.

835
01:20:45,489 --> 01:20:47,889
Which is not to say I won't take
a Macedonian.

836
01:20:48,049 --> 01:20:52,369
- As a second wife? You insult Macedonia.
- Alexander!

837
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:55,369
This is about the honor of our kingdom.

838
01:20:55,569 --> 01:20:57,729
Exactly. What can be won, Alexander?

839
01:20:57,889 --> 01:21:01,249
We're in Asia to punish them
for their crimes. We've achieved that.

840
01:21:01,449 --> 01:21:04,889
Seven years from home, now we drift
from one far region to another...

841
01:21:05,049 --> 01:21:08,809
...chasing nomads and bandits
when Macedonia bleeds its manpower.

842
01:21:08,969 --> 01:21:10,929
For what? To build roads in Asia?

843
01:21:11,089 --> 01:21:13,169
To give these people cities?

844
01:21:13,329 --> 01:21:16,609
To found cities and expand
our reach is not to drift.

845
01:21:16,769 --> 01:21:19,049
- What benefit to Macedon?
- It's far richer!

846
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:21,369
- Look what you give them.
- With respect...

847
01:21:21,529 --> 01:21:25,209
...had you fought better at Gaugamela
when your flank was crumbling...

848
01:21:25,369 --> 01:21:28,569
- How dare you, Nearchus?!
- General Nearchus to you, boy.

849
01:21:28,729 --> 01:21:32,089
Alexander spread our flank too thin!
There was nothing my father...

850
01:21:32,249 --> 01:21:34,489
...or any of you could've done!
- Philotas!

851
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:42,729
Alexander, I've known you
since you were born.

852
01:21:43,369 --> 01:21:46,209
I supported you at your father's death.

853
01:21:46,409 --> 01:21:49,169
At the very least, for Zeus' sake...

854
01:21:49,329 --> 01:21:52,209
...and in respect to the council
that chose you king...

855
01:21:52,369 --> 01:21:54,369
...give us a Macedonian heir.

856
01:21:54,529 --> 01:21:56,169
A Macedonian heir.

857
01:22:02,289 --> 01:22:04,209
- You've been heard clearly.
- But...

858
01:22:04,369 --> 01:22:09,729
Parmenion! After the wedding, take two
brigades to Babylon, where I look to you...

859
01:22:09,889 --> 01:22:14,809
...and Antipater in Greece, to maintain
our empire and supply this expedition.

860
01:22:15,249 --> 01:22:17,289
I'll winter with my army at Marakand.

861
01:22:17,449 --> 01:22:21,209
I pray to Apollo you realize how far
you've turned from your father's path.

862
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:24,089
Damn you, Parmenion,
by the gods and your Apollo.

863
01:22:24,249 --> 01:22:27,609
What was in my father's guts
wasn't overripe in reason like yours!

864
01:22:27,769 --> 01:22:31,209
He never lusted for war, Alexander,
or enjoyed it so.

865
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:36,289
He consulted his peers in council,
among equals, the Macedonian way.

866
01:22:36,449 --> 01:22:39,049
He didn't decide based
on his personal desires.

867
01:22:39,209 --> 01:22:42,409
I've taken us further
than my father ever dreamed.

868
01:22:42,569 --> 01:22:43,809
Old man...

869
01:22:43,969 --> 01:22:46,529
...we're in new worlds.

870
01:22:47,209 --> 01:22:50,729
Alexander, be reasonable!

871
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:53,249
Were they ever meant to be our equals?

872
01:22:53,409 --> 01:22:55,209
Share our rewards?

873
01:22:55,369 --> 01:22:57,409
You remember what Aristotle said.

874
01:22:57,569 --> 01:22:58,849
An Asian?

875
01:22:59,009 --> 01:23:02,609
What would a vow mean to a race
that's never kept their word to a Greek?

876
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,809
- Aristotle be damned!
- Alexander!

877
01:23:04,969 --> 01:23:06,369
By Zeus and all the gods...

878
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:10,529
...what makes you so much better
than them, Cassander?

879
01:23:10,689 --> 01:23:15,889
Better than you really are.
In you and those like you is this.

880
01:23:16,289 --> 01:23:18,049
Alexander.

881
01:23:20,609 --> 01:23:25,129
What disturbs me most is not your lack
of respect for my judgment.

882
01:23:27,089 --> 01:23:30,649
It's your contempt for a world
far older than ours.

883
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:49,529
And so 10 years after his mother's
insistence he marry a Macedonian...

884
01:23:49,689 --> 01:23:51,409
Through our union...

885
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:53,809
...Greek and barbarian...

886
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:59,849
...the most powerful man in the world
took a girl of no political significance.

887
01:24:00,009 --> 01:24:01,409
Why?

888
01:24:07,769 --> 01:24:11,249
Some say it was for alliance
with the tribes.

889
01:24:12,849 --> 01:24:15,129
Others, the desire for a successor.

890
01:24:17,409 --> 01:24:22,529
And yet others said Alexander
truly fell in love.

891
01:24:23,409 --> 01:24:25,289
Who Roxane really was...

892
01:24:25,449 --> 01:24:31,409
...I doubt any of us ever saw further
than the pools of those black eyes.

893
01:24:33,209 --> 01:24:35,089
Alexander...

894
01:24:36,689 --> 01:24:39,209
...special for you.

895
01:24:42,569 --> 01:24:45,169
On this glorious occasion...

896
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:49,489
...I toast this great army
that has given so much.

897
01:24:49,649 --> 01:24:53,609
And in honor of them, those of you
who set out with us seven long years ago...

898
01:24:53,769 --> 01:24:59,729
...I pronounce all your debts paid forthwith
from the royal treasury.

899
01:25:00,049 --> 01:25:01,289
Praise Alexander!

900
01:25:05,169 --> 01:25:07,209
And in honor of my bride...

901
01:25:08,249 --> 01:25:10,649
...my beautiful bride...

902
01:25:10,809 --> 01:25:15,209
...we recognize the many women
who've shared the long road with us...

903
01:25:15,369 --> 01:25:18,689
...and grant them dowries
befitting a proper marriage.

904
01:25:22,489 --> 01:25:25,169
And what about our boys?

905
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:26,769
And lastly...

906
01:25:26,929 --> 01:25:30,089
...lastly, the gods demand no less of us...

907
01:25:30,249 --> 01:25:33,449
...that your children be given
a proper Greek education...

908
01:25:33,609 --> 01:25:38,009
...and military training
under our protection...

909
01:25:38,169 --> 01:25:42,249
...so as to be the new soldiers
of our kingdom...

910
01:25:42,409 --> 01:25:44,769
...in Asia.

911
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:24,249
I found it in Egypt.

912
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:29,089
The man who sold it said it came
from a time...

913
01:26:29,249 --> 01:26:33,449
...when man worshipped sun and stars.

914
01:26:38,489 --> 01:26:40,649
I'll always think of you...

915
01:26:41,409 --> 01:26:43,649
...as the sun, Alexander.

916
01:26:43,809 --> 01:26:47,809
And I pray your dream
will shine on all men.

917
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:58,489
I wish you a son.

918
01:26:59,929 --> 01:27:02,249
You're a great man.

919
01:27:06,409 --> 01:27:09,529
Many will love you, Alexander,
but none so pure and deep...

920
01:27:25,529 --> 01:27:26,889
You...

921
01:27:27,089 --> 01:27:28,689
...love him?

922
01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:40,129
He is Hephaistion.

923
01:27:53,289 --> 01:27:56,609
There are many different ways
to love, Roxane.

924
01:27:57,169 --> 01:27:59,129
Come.

925
01:28:13,009 --> 01:28:14,249
No.

926
01:28:14,409 --> 01:28:15,929
No, no.

927
01:29:04,009 --> 01:29:06,089
You have no fear.

928
01:29:07,449 --> 01:29:09,169
It's fitting.

929
01:29:10,409 --> 01:29:13,729
A man searches for a woman
at Earth's top...

930
01:29:13,929 --> 01:29:15,809
...and finds her.

931
01:29:32,489 --> 01:29:34,209
The myth becomes real.

932
01:29:44,769 --> 01:29:46,449
Great man?

933
01:29:46,609 --> 01:29:48,569
Sikander.

934
01:29:48,729 --> 01:29:50,449
You, I kill now.

935
01:29:55,809 --> 01:29:57,369
Do it.

936
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:00,369
End it. I would do...

937
01:30:00,809 --> 01:30:02,889
I would do the same.

938
01:30:03,769 --> 01:30:06,289
I'll die a fool for this...

939
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:08,409
...love.

940
01:30:53,609 --> 01:30:55,569
My life is now yours.

941
01:31:19,249 --> 01:31:22,849
You will have my son.

942
01:31:58,049 --> 01:32:02,449
Who is this woman you call
your queen, Alexander?

943
01:32:02,609 --> 01:32:04,969
A hill girl?

944
01:32:05,169 --> 01:32:07,569
You, with your breeding.

945
01:32:07,729 --> 01:32:12,689
Already she makes enemies
with her strong, clumsy nature.

946
01:32:15,729 --> 01:32:18,009
Do not confuse us.

947
01:32:18,169 --> 01:32:21,889
I was never a barbarian as Philip said.

948
01:32:22,049 --> 01:32:24,689
We are of Achilles' royal blood.

949
01:32:25,369 --> 01:32:28,289
Zeus is your father.

950
01:32:29,809 --> 01:32:33,569
Oh, I understand she brings
you some happiness...

951
01:32:33,769 --> 01:32:35,409
...but hear me when I tell you...

952
01:32:35,569 --> 01:32:37,729
...act and act soon.

953
01:32:37,889 --> 01:32:39,809
After seven years, people wonder:

954
01:32:39,969 --> 01:32:42,169
"Who is this King Alexander?"

955
01:32:42,329 --> 01:32:47,889
I have given you ample proof.
Antipater daily undermines your authority.

956
01:32:48,049 --> 01:32:51,049
Return to Babylon
and strengthen your center.

957
01:32:51,809 --> 01:32:53,849
Or come home to Macedonia
and reorganize.

958
01:32:54,009 --> 01:32:56,449
But do not chase your dream...

959
01:32:56,609 --> 01:32:58,569
...further east.

960
01:32:58,769 --> 01:33:02,409
Your life and mine depend on it.

961
01:33:03,249 --> 01:33:04,849
Remember...

962
01:33:05,009 --> 01:33:08,569
...my only thoughts are of you.

963
01:33:08,729 --> 01:33:12,849
As you, too, must face
your glorious destiny.

964
01:33:13,009 --> 01:33:15,049
Think kindly of your mother.

965
01:33:15,209 --> 01:33:16,689
Provide for me.

966
01:33:16,849 --> 01:33:20,329
Protect me from your enemies
when you are gone.

967
01:33:21,689 --> 01:33:24,209
And remember always...

968
01:33:24,369 --> 01:33:27,809
...it is I who love you more than any.

969
01:33:33,809 --> 01:33:36,929
If only you were not a pale reflection...

970
01:33:37,089 --> 01:33:38,529
...of my mother's heart.

971
01:34:16,369 --> 01:34:18,249
Who did this?

972
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:21,409
- Tell me.
- Hermolaus!

973
01:34:23,249 --> 01:34:26,889
Never will you find a man
as devoted as I. Yes.

974
01:34:27,049 --> 01:34:31,289
The conspiracy deeply upset Alexander...

975
01:34:31,449 --> 01:34:34,089
...not only because it involved
the young pages...

976
01:34:34,289 --> 01:34:36,049
...who'd shared his dream...

977
01:34:36,209 --> 01:34:39,729
...but, more intimately,
it implicated Philotas...

978
01:34:39,889 --> 01:34:45,489
...his companion from boyhood, who was
captain of Alexander's royal guards.

979
01:34:45,649 --> 01:34:46,889
Alexander.

980
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:49,849
Remember me for who I am.

981
01:34:50,609 --> 01:34:53,729
I do remember you, Philotas,
but not as you remember yourself.

982
01:34:53,889 --> 01:34:57,929
It appears to me and your peers that
the true weather of your soul is ambition.

983
01:34:58,089 --> 01:34:59,249
No.

984
01:34:59,409 --> 01:35:01,849
- None of us defended Philotas.
- I didn't do this!

985
01:35:02,009 --> 01:35:04,329
Then again, none of us ever liked him.

986
01:35:04,849 --> 01:35:09,249
And, of course, his power
was carved up by the rest of us.

987
01:35:17,089 --> 01:35:22,529
Before he died, we tortured him to find out
what his father, Parmenion, knew.

988
01:35:22,689 --> 01:35:24,769
But this we never learned.

989
01:35:24,929 --> 01:35:28,849
What to do with Parmenion and his
20,000 troops guarding our supply lines...

990
01:35:29,009 --> 01:35:31,169
...was a far more delicate matter.

991
01:35:31,329 --> 01:35:35,009
Was he innocent in this,
or had he decided to act...

992
01:35:35,169 --> 01:35:37,929
...before age further withered his power?

993
01:35:38,209 --> 01:35:39,569
They'll be divided.

994
01:35:39,729 --> 01:35:43,089
- The men will follow their king.
- Alexander won't be there.

995
01:35:44,249 --> 01:35:46,089
Necessity required Alexander to act.

996
01:35:46,289 --> 01:35:47,689
The infantry will follow me.

997
01:35:47,849 --> 01:35:52,569
And he sealed the camp within the hour
of the first accusations against Philotas.

998
01:35:53,729 --> 01:35:57,489
Then go, Antigonus, and Cleitus.

999
01:35:57,649 --> 01:35:59,449
And go quickly.

1000
01:36:01,049 --> 01:36:07,089
Three days' hard riding sent Antigonus
and Cleitus to Parmenion.

1001
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:13,249
His soldiers accepted the finding
of guilt against Parmenion...

1002
01:36:13,409 --> 01:36:18,329
...as they understood that the head of
family is responsible for the behavior of all.

1003
01:36:47,049 --> 01:36:49,689
Cleitus. Antigonus.

1004
01:36:49,849 --> 01:36:51,409
Parmenion.

1005
01:37:54,009 --> 01:37:57,129
I remember a remark of Bagoas' once...

1006
01:37:57,289 --> 01:38:01,089
...that love eluded Alexander as much,
if not more...

1007
01:38:01,289 --> 01:38:03,409
...than finding the end of the world.

1008
01:38:09,809 --> 01:38:13,729
In the spring, Alexander marched
an army of 150,000...

1009
01:38:13,889 --> 01:38:16,809
...across the passes of the Hindu Kush...

1010
01:38:17,329 --> 01:38:19,249
...into the unknown.

1011
01:38:20,489 --> 01:38:25,089
In his dream, it was the promised route
to the end of the world.

1012
01:38:25,249 --> 01:38:27,049
We were now a mobile empire...

1013
01:38:27,249 --> 01:38:30,929
...stretching back thousands of miles
to Greece.

1014
01:38:31,089 --> 01:38:33,889
Cooks and architects,
doctors and surveyors...

1015
01:38:34,049 --> 01:38:35,449
...moneylenders and wives...

1016
01:38:35,609 --> 01:38:38,369
...children, lovers, whores.

1017
01:38:38,529 --> 01:38:40,009
And forget not the slaves...

1018
01:38:40,209 --> 01:38:44,849
...that anonymous, bent, working spine
of this new beast.

1019
01:38:45,009 --> 01:38:48,689
Ravaged or expanded, for better or worse...

1020
01:38:49,529 --> 01:38:53,929
...no occupied territory
remained the same again.

1021
01:38:55,889 --> 01:38:57,929
Although devoted to Roxane...

1022
01:38:58,129 --> 01:39:00,849
...Alexander's visits
to her tent diminished...

1023
01:39:01,289 --> 01:39:06,049
...as a year, then two, went by
without a successor...

1024
01:39:06,929 --> 01:39:09,889
...wounding Alexander's great pride.

1025
01:39:12,449 --> 01:39:15,889
The surveyors are saying that Zeus
chained Prometheus up there.

1026
01:39:16,049 --> 01:39:18,289
In one of those caves.

1027
01:39:19,089 --> 01:39:21,729
They say there's a giant eagle's nest
just above it.

1028
01:39:22,009 --> 01:39:26,609
I suppose he drops down each night
to peck out poor Prometheus' liver.

1029
01:39:29,169 --> 01:39:32,449
You remember what Aristotle told us
of these mountains?

1030
01:39:33,329 --> 01:39:34,849
Yes, I do.

1031
01:39:35,689 --> 01:39:37,689
That when we reach these heights...

1032
01:39:37,849 --> 01:39:40,929
...we'd look back and see Macedonia
to the west...

1033
01:39:41,089 --> 01:39:43,609
...and the outer ocean to the east.

1034
01:39:47,529 --> 01:39:52,289
But I fear this world is far larger
than anyone dreamed.

1035
01:39:52,489 --> 01:39:54,569
A world of Titans.

1036
01:39:54,729 --> 01:39:58,529
The scouts have been up
every known trail, Alexander.

1037
01:39:58,729 --> 01:40:00,849
There is no way across.

1038
01:40:01,409 --> 01:40:05,409
Except to the south, into India.

1039
01:40:05,809 --> 01:40:08,729
Were we gods, we'd breach
these walls to the eastern ocean.

1040
01:40:09,529 --> 01:40:11,169
We will, Alexander.

1041
01:40:11,329 --> 01:40:13,889
In a few years' time, we will return.

1042
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:17,689
But first, the men must see their homes.

1043
01:40:19,089 --> 01:40:21,049
Have you found your home...

1044
01:40:21,209 --> 01:40:22,849
...Ptolemy?

1045
01:40:27,289 --> 01:40:30,409
More and more, I think
it will be Alexandria.

1046
01:40:32,409 --> 01:40:34,489
Well, at least it's hot.

1047
01:40:35,449 --> 01:40:37,129
And Thais...

1048
01:40:37,969 --> 01:40:39,929
...she loved it there.

1049
01:40:41,649 --> 01:40:43,809
Women bring men home.

1050
01:40:44,849 --> 01:40:49,569
- I have no such feeling.
- You have Babylon, Alexander.

1051
01:40:49,729 --> 01:40:51,809
Where your mother awaits your invitation.

1052
01:40:52,209 --> 01:40:54,609
Yes, I have Babylon.

1053
01:40:54,769 --> 01:40:58,969
But each land, each boundary I cross...

1054
01:40:59,129 --> 01:41:01,369
...I strip away another illusion.

1055
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:04,929
I sense death will be the last.

1056
01:41:07,569 --> 01:41:10,849
Yet still I push harder and harder...

1057
01:41:11,049 --> 01:41:14,449
...to reach this home.

1058
01:41:19,809 --> 01:41:21,129
Where has our eagle gone?

1059
01:41:25,609 --> 01:41:27,609
We must go on, Ptolemy.

1060
01:41:28,849 --> 01:41:30,449
Until we find an end.

1061
01:41:38,529 --> 01:41:42,089
India, the land where the sun was born...

1062
01:41:42,289 --> 01:41:44,769
...fabled to be even richer than Persia...

1063
01:41:44,929 --> 01:41:48,809
...had never been explored or conquered.

1064
01:41:49,009 --> 01:41:54,089
From the beginning, Alexander struggled
to unify a land without a center.

1065
01:41:54,289 --> 01:41:56,889
Kings who conspired against one another.

1066
01:41:57,049 --> 01:42:00,929
A labyrinth of tribes urged on
by zealots and philosophers...

1067
01:42:01,129 --> 01:42:05,129
...to die by the thousands
for their strange gods.

1068
01:42:05,689 --> 01:42:09,209
Crateros, in the advance party,
fought against men with hairy skins...

1069
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:12,729
...who were tiny and lived
in the tops of trees.

1070
01:42:20,569 --> 01:42:23,169
Until Hephaistion convinced us
these were animals...

1071
01:42:23,329 --> 01:42:25,489
...who imitated men
but wore their own skin.

1072
01:42:25,649 --> 01:42:27,209
Keep that away from me.

1073
01:42:27,409 --> 01:42:30,329
They called this tribe "monkey."

1074
01:42:32,369 --> 01:42:33,849
Monkey.

1075
01:42:35,369 --> 01:42:37,329
- Incredible.
- Look at his hands.

1076
01:42:39,409 --> 01:42:41,329
Look, Roxane.

1077
01:42:42,769 --> 01:42:43,929
Hello, little man.

1078
01:42:44,609 --> 01:42:47,649
- Do they speak?
- No, but they do sing.

1079
01:42:47,809 --> 01:42:50,409
And then, there was the rain.

1080
01:42:56,689 --> 01:43:00,289
Never before had we seen water
that fell from the gods...

1081
01:43:00,449 --> 01:43:03,009
...for 60 days and nights.

1082
01:43:06,329 --> 01:43:08,089
You know better, Machatas.

1083
01:43:08,409 --> 01:43:09,889
What's your son going to say?

1084
01:43:10,129 --> 01:43:12,489
Come on, man.
The older you get, the stronger.

1085
01:43:12,649 --> 01:43:14,529
Right, my king.

1086
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:16,089
Give me my horse, Alexander.

1087
01:43:16,249 --> 01:43:18,369
I'll be with you at your side.

1088
01:43:20,889 --> 01:43:22,569
Watch out for the serpent.

1089
01:43:23,169 --> 01:43:25,169
Hold it, hold it tight.

1090
01:43:26,409 --> 01:43:29,049
Cleitus, bring the snake healers!

1091
01:43:29,209 --> 01:43:32,009
- Pauvanus. Someone bring Pauvanus.
- Where's the bite?

1092
01:43:32,169 --> 01:43:33,849
- What happened?
- It's to the neck.

1093
01:43:34,009 --> 01:43:36,249
Oh, no. Zeus, no.

1094
01:43:36,409 --> 01:43:37,889
Hold on. Hold on.

1095
01:43:38,089 --> 01:43:39,369
Be brave.

1096
01:43:39,529 --> 01:43:41,129
Be brave.

1097
01:43:41,329 --> 01:43:43,209
Oh, Zeus.

1098
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:48,489
Our quest for gold and glory evaporated
as we realized...

1099
01:43:48,649 --> 01:43:50,889
...there was none to be had.

1100
01:43:51,329 --> 01:43:53,089
Tempers worsened.

1101
01:43:53,249 --> 01:43:56,089
We massacred all Indians who resisted.

1102
01:43:56,249 --> 01:43:58,289
And with the local water putrid...

1103
01:43:58,449 --> 01:44:01,249
...we drank the strong wine.

1104
01:44:51,089 --> 01:44:52,809
As we moved southeast...

1105
01:44:53,009 --> 01:44:57,209
...Alexander often returned the lands
we'd conquered to their defeated kings...

1106
01:44:57,689 --> 01:45:00,329
...so as to make of them allies.

1107
01:45:00,489 --> 01:45:02,889
But this did not sit well with the army...

1108
01:45:03,089 --> 01:45:06,369
...who began to wonder if Alexander
was on some crazed quest...

1109
01:45:06,529 --> 01:45:09,649
...to imitate the glory of Herakles.

1110
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:33,609
Give him a kiss.

1111
01:45:33,769 --> 01:45:35,649
Go on, kiss him.

1112
01:45:39,569 --> 01:45:41,329
Give him a kiss.

1113
01:45:51,729 --> 01:45:54,209
- To Bagoas.
- To Bagoas!

1114
01:45:58,729 --> 01:46:02,689
- And to my mother's god, Dionysus...
- Dionysus!

1115
01:46:02,849 --> 01:46:06,929
...who, we're told by our Indian allies,
traveled here before Herakles...

1116
01:46:07,089 --> 01:46:09,729
...some 6000 years ago.

1117
01:46:09,889 --> 01:46:11,329
To a hero.

1118
01:46:11,529 --> 01:46:13,409
To a hero!

1119
01:46:31,889 --> 01:46:33,169
Roxane.

1120
01:46:39,689 --> 01:46:42,009
You lose face.

1121
01:46:42,169 --> 01:46:43,649
These Indians...

1122
01:46:43,849 --> 01:46:45,529
...they are a low, evil people.

1123
01:46:45,689 --> 01:46:48,049
You don't try to understand them.

1124
01:46:48,209 --> 01:46:50,409
I try.

1125
01:46:50,569 --> 01:46:53,449
But this I know, Alexander.

1126
01:46:53,609 --> 01:46:56,609
In Persia, you are a great king.

1127
01:46:56,769 --> 01:46:58,249
Here...

1128
01:46:58,409 --> 01:47:00,329
...they hate you.

1129
01:47:02,809 --> 01:47:06,169
Let us go back to Babylon.

1130
01:47:07,089 --> 01:47:08,769
There, you are strong.

1131
01:47:10,809 --> 01:47:13,089
We'll talk about this later.

1132
01:47:13,249 --> 01:47:14,569
Yes.

1133
01:47:14,729 --> 01:47:16,209
Later.

1134
01:47:16,369 --> 01:47:17,849
Talk.

1135
01:47:20,529 --> 01:47:22,409
I shall come.

1136
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:23,889
Tonight.

1137
01:47:24,769 --> 01:47:26,569
And I shall wait.

1138
01:47:28,329 --> 01:47:30,329
Good night, my king.

1139
01:47:31,969 --> 01:47:34,049
Your Majesty.

1140
01:47:34,969 --> 01:47:36,689
I'll toast to Bagoas.

1141
01:47:38,729 --> 01:47:42,049
And the 30,000 beautiful Persian boys...

1142
01:47:42,209 --> 01:47:45,049
...we're training to fight
in this great army.

1143
01:47:48,329 --> 01:47:50,209
And to the memory of Philip.

1144
01:47:50,529 --> 01:47:53,289
Had he lived to see his Macedonians...

1145
01:47:53,449 --> 01:47:56,369
...transformed into such...

1146
01:47:56,529 --> 01:47:58,209
...a pretty army.

1147
01:48:00,289 --> 01:48:01,529
To Philip.

1148
01:48:01,689 --> 01:48:03,809
To a real hero.

1149
01:48:03,969 --> 01:48:06,049
Philip!

1150
01:48:08,729 --> 01:48:13,449
And to Cleitus and his new appointment
as satrap of Bactria.

1151
01:48:13,609 --> 01:48:15,049
Cleitus.

1152
01:48:16,409 --> 01:48:18,929
That's a fancy way of putting it, Ptolemy.

1153
01:48:19,089 --> 01:48:21,969
But we all know what a pension
and an exile is...

1154
01:48:22,129 --> 01:48:23,889
...after 30 years' service.

1155
01:48:24,049 --> 01:48:27,969
You call governing
this major province exile?

1156
01:48:28,169 --> 01:48:31,169
Has Your Majesty given any
of his closest companions...

1157
01:48:31,809 --> 01:48:33,849
...a province so far from home?

1158
01:48:34,009 --> 01:48:37,289
Then you won't make a very
good satrap, will you, Cleitus?

1159
01:48:40,049 --> 01:48:42,089
So be it.

1160
01:48:42,249 --> 01:48:45,569
Let me rot in Macedonian rags...

1161
01:48:45,729 --> 01:48:47,809
...rather than shine...

1162
01:48:47,969 --> 01:48:49,249
...in Eastern pomp.

1163
01:48:50,609 --> 01:48:54,249
I won't quake and bow down
like the sycophants you have around you.

1164
01:48:54,409 --> 01:48:57,809
Hephaistion, Nearchus, Perdiccas.

1165
01:48:58,289 --> 01:49:02,409
As governor of one
of our most Asian of satrapies...

1166
01:49:02,569 --> 01:49:07,329
...Cleitus, does it not occur to you
that if my Persian subjects...

1167
01:49:07,529 --> 01:49:10,529
...bow down before me,
it's important for them to do so?

1168
01:49:10,689 --> 01:49:13,329
Do I insist on Greeks doing the same?

1169
01:49:13,489 --> 01:49:16,929
You accept Greek offerings
as a son of Zeus, do you not?

1170
01:49:20,169 --> 01:49:21,569
Only when offered.

1171
01:49:21,769 --> 01:49:24,089
Why don't you refuse
these vain flatteries?

1172
01:49:24,529 --> 01:49:27,089
What freedom is this, to bow before you?

1173
01:49:27,249 --> 01:49:29,729
You bow before Herakles,
and he was mortal...

1174
01:49:29,929 --> 01:49:31,489
...but a son of Zeus.

1175
01:49:31,649 --> 01:49:35,209
How can you, so young,
compare yourself to Herakles?

1176
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:38,249
Why not?

1177
01:49:40,649 --> 01:49:42,609
I've achieved more in my years.

1178
01:49:42,769 --> 01:49:44,649
Traveled as far.

1179
01:49:44,809 --> 01:49:46,009
Probably farther.

1180
01:49:46,169 --> 01:49:48,289
Herakles did it by himself.

1181
01:49:48,449 --> 01:49:51,329
Did you conquer Asia
by yourself, Alexander?

1182
01:49:51,529 --> 01:49:53,249
Who planned the Asian invasion?

1183
01:49:53,409 --> 01:49:55,049
Was it not your father?

1184
01:49:55,209 --> 01:49:57,249
Or is his blood no longer good enough?

1185
01:49:57,569 --> 01:50:00,969
- Zeus-Amon, is it?
- You insult me, Cleitus.

1186
01:50:01,129 --> 01:50:03,809
You mock my family. Be careful.

1187
01:50:04,169 --> 01:50:07,609
Never would your father have taken
barbarians as his friends...

1188
01:50:07,769 --> 01:50:10,329
...asked us to fight with them
as equals in war.

1189
01:50:10,489 --> 01:50:12,329
Are we not good enough any longer?

1190
01:50:12,489 --> 01:50:14,489
I remember a time...

1191
01:50:14,649 --> 01:50:17,129
...when we could talk as men,
straight to the eye.

1192
01:50:17,289 --> 01:50:20,049
None of this scraping, groveling.

1193
01:50:21,689 --> 01:50:23,649
Now you kiss them?

1194
01:50:24,289 --> 01:50:29,089
Take a barbarian, childless wife
and dare call her queen?

1195
01:50:31,449 --> 01:50:35,449
Go quickly, Cleitus,
before you ruin your life.

1196
01:50:38,969 --> 01:50:42,329
Doesn't your great pride
fear the gods any longer?

1197
01:50:43,729 --> 01:50:47,009
This army...
This army is your blood, boy!

1198
01:50:47,169 --> 01:50:49,129
Without it, you're nothing!

1199
01:50:54,009 --> 01:50:56,329
You no longer serve the purpose
of this march!

1200
01:50:56,489 --> 01:50:59,129
- Get him from my sight!
- I don't serve your purpose?!

1201
01:50:59,289 --> 01:51:03,169
What was I serving when I saved
your puppy life at Gaugamela?

1202
01:51:03,369 --> 01:51:06,609
Do you think we'd be forced now
to mate with brown apes?

1203
01:51:06,769 --> 01:51:08,129
Alexander!

1204
01:51:08,289 --> 01:51:10,529
Turn out the guards!
Arrest him for treason!

1205
01:51:17,609 --> 01:51:19,369
- Who's with him?
- No.

1206
01:51:19,529 --> 01:51:20,969
Who's with him?

1207
01:51:21,609 --> 01:51:23,689
I call Father Zeus to witness.

1208
01:51:23,849 --> 01:51:26,049
I call you to trial before him!

1209
01:51:26,209 --> 01:51:28,609
And we'll see how deep
this conspiracy cuts!

1210
01:51:28,769 --> 01:51:30,889
- Take him!
- You speak of plots against you?

1211
01:51:31,049 --> 01:51:32,489
What about poor Parmenion?

1212
01:51:32,649 --> 01:51:35,369
You made me do your foul deed.
Have you no shame?

1213
01:51:36,329 --> 01:51:39,249
Hypocrite. Despot. False king.

1214
01:51:40,049 --> 01:51:42,889
You and your barbarian mother
live in shame.

1215
01:52:06,569 --> 01:52:08,249
Cleitus.

1216
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:10,209
Oh, my Cleitus.

1217
01:52:17,369 --> 01:52:18,849
- Let me pass.
- None can enter.

1218
01:52:19,009 --> 01:52:20,809
I am the queen.

1219
01:52:24,489 --> 01:52:26,609
I want to see him. I've waited three days.

1220
01:52:26,769 --> 01:52:29,449
He says none, not even you.

1221
01:52:30,449 --> 01:52:34,209
- He needs me.
- No, he doesn't.

1222
01:52:34,369 --> 01:52:36,129
And he needs you?

1223
01:52:37,689 --> 01:52:40,089
Hephaistion, you make a mistake.

1224
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:48,809
The army needs your reassurance.

1225
01:52:49,249 --> 01:52:50,889
Alexander.

1226
01:52:52,809 --> 01:52:54,369
Yes.

1227
01:52:54,569 --> 01:52:58,249
Like an old lover they forgive,
but they will never forget.

1228
01:52:59,929 --> 01:53:01,209
You know more than any...

1229
01:53:01,369 --> 01:53:05,729
...great deeds are done by men
who took and never regretted.

1230
01:53:05,929 --> 01:53:07,889
You're Alexander.

1231
01:53:08,049 --> 01:53:10,769
Pity and grief will only destroy you.

1232
01:53:10,929 --> 01:53:14,649
Have I become so arrogant
that I am blind?

1233
01:53:16,129 --> 01:53:17,929
Sometimes...

1234
01:53:18,089 --> 01:53:20,129
...to expect the best of everyone...

1235
01:53:20,769 --> 01:53:22,729
...is arrogance.

1236
01:53:25,569 --> 01:53:28,169
Then Cleitus spoke true.

1237
01:53:28,329 --> 01:53:30,209
I am become a tyrant.

1238
01:53:30,609 --> 01:53:32,649
You're mortal.

1239
01:53:32,849 --> 01:53:34,689
And they know it.

1240
01:53:34,849 --> 01:53:39,329
And they forgive you because
you make them proud of themselves.

1241
01:53:40,329 --> 01:53:42,089
I've failed...

1242
01:53:42,249 --> 01:53:43,969
...utterly.

1243
01:54:12,249 --> 01:54:15,329
Philip, King of Macedonia...

1244
01:54:15,489 --> 01:54:17,289
...and leader of the Greeks.

1245
01:54:18,009 --> 01:54:22,769
All my life, I've waited to see Greeks
grovel with respect for Macedonia.

1246
01:54:24,009 --> 01:54:26,049
Today is that day.

1247
01:54:33,289 --> 01:54:35,929
They say already,
"Philip was a great general...

1248
01:54:36,089 --> 01:54:39,809
...but Alexander is simply great."

1249
01:54:41,129 --> 01:54:43,689
But if you ever insult me again...

1250
01:54:43,849 --> 01:54:45,769
...Ill kill you.

1251
01:54:51,329 --> 01:54:52,649
I've missed you.

1252
01:54:52,809 --> 01:54:55,369
In the spring, Persia.

1253
01:54:55,529 --> 01:54:57,609
You'll command my horse from the right.

1254
01:54:57,769 --> 01:54:59,929
I'm honored, Father. I wouldn't miss it...

1255
01:55:00,089 --> 01:55:01,769
...for all the gold in the world.

1256
01:55:01,929 --> 01:55:04,449
Which, one day, you'll have.

1257
01:55:08,849 --> 01:55:11,329
Making himself a 13th god.

1258
01:55:11,489 --> 01:55:13,529
He's drunk so much wine, my poor Philip.

1259
01:55:13,689 --> 01:55:15,489
He's lost his mind.

1260
01:55:18,409 --> 01:55:21,009
- Your Majesty.
- Attalus.

1261
01:55:25,329 --> 01:55:28,129
I hope the prince
is enjoying the spectacle...

1262
01:55:28,289 --> 01:55:31,049
...as much as our regent.

1263
01:55:31,209 --> 01:55:32,769
He's very tired.

1264
01:55:36,809 --> 01:55:39,009
Hey.

1265
01:55:41,289 --> 01:55:44,289
- Pausanias, bring the rest of the guard.
- Royal guard!

1266
01:55:44,529 --> 01:55:47,129
To the arena! March!

1267
01:55:47,289 --> 01:55:50,089
No guard, Your Majesty?
In all this crowd?

1268
01:55:50,249 --> 01:55:53,449
- Greeks all over the place.
- Cleitus, Cleitus.

1269
01:55:53,609 --> 01:55:55,609
My Cleitus.

1270
01:55:56,009 --> 01:55:58,569
This man you can
always trust, Alexander.

1271
01:55:59,009 --> 01:56:00,529
Treat him as you would me.

1272
01:56:00,689 --> 01:56:02,809
He'll guard your back for you.

1273
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:05,409
Yes, Father.

1274
01:56:05,569 --> 01:56:07,849
My people are guard enough today.

1275
01:56:08,009 --> 01:56:11,489
Let these Greeks see for themselves
how I can walk through my people.

1276
01:56:11,649 --> 01:56:13,089
Then let them call me tyrant.

1277
01:56:13,609 --> 01:56:16,729
Bring the main guard in
after my entry only.

1278
01:56:16,889 --> 01:56:20,409
Cleitus, make sure the wine
flows steady all day.

1279
01:56:20,569 --> 01:56:22,529
I want them to like me.

1280
01:56:29,369 --> 01:56:31,889
Weren't you told? I go in alone.

1281
01:56:32,049 --> 01:56:34,049
Follow with the main guard.

1282
01:56:34,249 --> 01:56:35,609
Go on.

1283
01:56:38,529 --> 01:56:41,729
- Go on.
- Father, it's best I go with you.

1284
01:56:44,529 --> 01:56:47,489
You want the world to see
you're my successor.

1285
01:56:47,689 --> 01:56:49,569
Is that what she wants?

1286
01:56:50,049 --> 01:56:52,689
Don't look so hurt all the time,
Alexander. Be a man.

1287
01:56:52,849 --> 01:56:56,889
You count yourself lucky you were here
at all today, after your public display.

1288
01:57:00,489 --> 01:57:02,569
By Herakles, by Zeus, by all the gods...

1289
01:57:02,729 --> 01:57:05,209
...obey me this once!

1290
01:57:06,449 --> 01:57:08,929
Have courage, Father.

1291
01:57:09,089 --> 01:57:11,489
And go on your way
rejoicing that at each step...

1292
01:57:11,689 --> 01:57:13,769
...you may recall your valor.

1293
01:57:48,089 --> 01:57:51,849
And now, our beloved King Philip...

1294
01:57:52,009 --> 01:57:55,009
...in whose honor
these wedding games begin.

1295
01:58:12,249 --> 01:58:14,569
Pausanias, I told you...

1296
01:59:02,729 --> 01:59:04,329
The king is slain!

1297
01:59:51,769 --> 01:59:54,169
The king lives!

1298
01:59:54,329 --> 01:59:57,609
Alexander, son of Philip!

1299
01:59:57,769 --> 01:59:59,489
May the gods bless the king!

1300
02:00:03,849 --> 02:00:06,489
You're king now. You're king.

1301
02:00:14,329 --> 02:00:17,649
May the gods bless Alexander!

1302
02:00:19,529 --> 02:00:21,609
- Alexander!
- Alexander!

1303
02:00:30,249 --> 02:00:31,529
Get out.

1304
02:00:32,969 --> 02:00:34,369
Go.

1305
02:00:39,089 --> 02:00:41,409
How can you behave
so shamelessly in public?

1306
02:00:41,569 --> 02:00:43,729
Because it was meant to be.

1307
02:00:43,889 --> 02:00:45,889
This isn't how I wanted to become king.

1308
02:00:46,049 --> 02:00:50,209
- No one blames you.
- They blame me behind my back! In secret.

1309
02:00:50,369 --> 02:00:51,849
- Slander is not power.
- Shame is?

1310
02:00:54,529 --> 02:00:56,449
Who killed my father?

1311
02:00:56,929 --> 02:00:58,449
Tell me.

1312
02:00:58,609 --> 02:01:01,209
Tell me, or shall I put you on trial
for his murder?

1313
02:01:01,369 --> 02:01:03,849
- Pausanias.
- He had help!

1314
02:01:04,009 --> 02:01:06,049
Did you help him?

1315
02:01:12,889 --> 02:01:15,089
No, never.

1316
02:01:15,529 --> 02:01:18,369
Why? Why would I?

1317
02:01:19,449 --> 02:01:21,049
So many wanted it.

1318
02:01:21,209 --> 02:01:22,529
Greeks, Persians, men...

1319
02:01:22,689 --> 02:01:24,569
You're mad. You're cursed.

1320
02:01:24,729 --> 02:01:27,289
You've unleashed Furies,
you don't know their power.

1321
02:01:27,449 --> 02:01:30,249
Now who is exaggerating?

1322
02:01:31,129 --> 02:01:33,329
Even if it was the wish of your heart...

1323
02:01:33,489 --> 02:01:36,089
That's a lie! He was my father!
I loved him!

1324
02:01:36,249 --> 02:01:38,049
He was not your father!

1325
02:01:38,209 --> 02:01:40,249
You owe no blood debt to that man.

1326
02:01:40,409 --> 02:01:43,089
You lie and lie and lie.

1327
02:01:43,249 --> 02:01:46,209
So many lies you've spun
like a sorceress, confusing me.

1328
02:01:46,369 --> 02:01:49,609
Look at you. Look at you.

1329
02:01:49,769 --> 02:01:53,129
You are everything that he was not.

1330
02:01:53,289 --> 02:01:56,489
He was coarse, you are refined.

1331
02:01:56,649 --> 02:02:00,369
He was a general, and you are a king.

1332
02:02:00,529 --> 02:02:02,489
He could not rule himself...

1333
02:02:02,729 --> 02:02:05,729
...and you shall rule the world.

1334
02:02:05,929 --> 02:02:09,449
You're so cursed by all the gods
when you speak like this.

1335
02:02:09,609 --> 02:02:11,449
Such thick pride...

1336
02:02:11,609 --> 02:02:13,449
...and no mourning for your husband.

1337
02:02:13,609 --> 02:02:14,929
Mourn...

1338
02:02:15,089 --> 02:02:16,609
...him?

1339
02:02:17,529 --> 02:02:19,969
What do you know of Philip?

1340
02:02:21,409 --> 02:02:25,529
No, Alexander. Zeus is your father.

1341
02:02:26,249 --> 02:02:29,809
- Act like it.
- My first act would be to kill you!

1342
02:02:31,049 --> 02:02:33,289
You murdered me in my cradle.

1343
02:02:33,449 --> 02:02:35,569
You birthed me in a sack of hate.

1344
02:02:35,729 --> 02:02:37,809
Hate you have for those
stronger than you.

1345
02:02:37,969 --> 02:02:41,689
- Hate you have for men.
- I taught you my heart, Alexander!

1346
02:02:41,849 --> 02:02:45,529
And by Zeus and Dionysus,
you grew beautiful.

1347
02:02:45,689 --> 02:02:47,889
Damn your sorceress soul.

1348
02:02:48,049 --> 02:02:50,649
Your soul is mine, Alexander.

1349
02:02:52,049 --> 02:02:53,529
No! No!

1350
02:02:54,089 --> 02:02:57,849
You've taken from me everything
I've ever loved and made me you!

1351
02:02:58,449 --> 02:03:00,409
Stop it. Stop acting like a boy.

1352
02:03:00,569 --> 02:03:02,929
You're a king. Act like one.

1353
02:03:03,089 --> 02:03:04,769
Parmenion is with us, for once.

1354
02:03:04,969 --> 02:03:06,729
Execute Attalus without delay.

1355
02:03:06,889 --> 02:03:09,729
Confiscate their lands and root out
that family forever.

1356
02:03:09,889 --> 02:03:11,249
Eurydice? Never.

1357
02:03:11,409 --> 02:03:12,809
Laugh, you monster.

1358
02:03:12,969 --> 02:03:14,249
You heartbreaker.

1359
02:03:14,409 --> 02:03:17,209
How will you live out the year like this?

1360
02:03:17,369 --> 02:03:21,929
- Have you learned nothing from Philip?
- No. From you, Mother.

1361
02:03:24,969 --> 02:03:26,569
The best.

1362
02:03:36,169 --> 02:03:40,609
What have I done
to make you hate me so?

1363
02:03:42,289 --> 02:03:46,729
One day, you will understand this.

1364
02:03:46,889 --> 02:03:50,329
But I have only you in my heart.

1365
02:03:52,849 --> 02:03:55,969
I know what you need.

1366
02:03:56,809 --> 02:03:59,049
Now is the time.

1367
02:03:59,209 --> 02:04:01,369
The gods favor you.

1368
02:04:01,689 --> 02:04:04,849
Great wealth, power, conquest.

1369
02:04:05,009 --> 02:04:06,729
All you desire.

1370
02:04:06,889 --> 02:04:09,409
The world is yours!

1371
02:04:09,569 --> 02:04:11,409
Take it.

1372
02:04:15,769 --> 02:04:17,449
Take it.

1373
02:04:38,729 --> 02:04:42,009
He never saw his mother again.

1374
02:04:44,689 --> 02:04:47,769
And while he was away,
fighting the Northern tribes...

1375
02:04:47,929 --> 02:04:53,369
...Olympias had Philip's new wife,
Eurydice, and her infant son murdered.

1376
02:04:54,889 --> 02:04:56,369
By necessity...

1377
02:04:56,529 --> 02:05:00,169
...he had her uncle Attalus executed.

1378
02:05:21,209 --> 02:05:22,769
Of course you have fears.

1379
02:05:22,929 --> 02:05:24,329
We all have fears...

1380
02:05:24,489 --> 02:05:27,489
...because no one has ever
gone this far before.

1381
02:05:28,049 --> 02:05:32,329
And now we are weeks from
the encircling ocean, our route home.

1382
02:05:32,609 --> 02:05:34,169
We'll build a fleet of ships...

1383
02:05:34,329 --> 02:05:37,169
...and sail all the way
back down the Nile to Egypt.

1384
02:05:37,329 --> 02:05:40,329
And from Alexandria,
we shall be home within weeks.

1385
02:05:40,689 --> 02:05:42,849
There to be reunited with our loved ones.

1386
02:05:43,009 --> 02:05:46,449
To share our great treasures
and tales of Asia.

1387
02:05:46,609 --> 02:05:51,249
And to enjoy our imperishable glory
to the ends of time.

1388
02:05:52,409 --> 02:05:55,769
- Follow Alexander.
- I'll follow you.

1389
02:06:00,209 --> 02:06:01,809
What?

1390
02:06:01,969 --> 02:06:05,249
- Silence?
- We're with you, Alexander!

1391
02:06:05,409 --> 02:06:06,569
Peucestas.

1392
02:06:06,889 --> 02:06:08,929
A hero.

1393
02:06:09,089 --> 02:06:12,129
Where are the Amazons of myth
who dare to fight and kill men?

1394
02:06:12,489 --> 02:06:14,049
Where have they gone?

1395
02:06:15,489 --> 02:06:18,169
We'll never leave you, Alexander!

1396
02:06:19,209 --> 02:06:20,409
You, Meleager.

1397
02:06:20,569 --> 02:06:23,889
Who are these tribes ahead
compared to those we've vanquished?

1398
02:06:26,889 --> 02:06:28,569
Lysimachus?

1399
02:06:31,049 --> 02:06:32,569
Antigonus.

1400
02:06:34,569 --> 02:06:37,089
You break my heart, you men.

1401
02:06:37,289 --> 02:06:39,049
Afraid.

1402
02:06:39,969 --> 02:06:41,409
Crateros.

1403
02:06:43,529 --> 02:06:44,689
Crateros.

1404
02:06:44,849 --> 02:06:45,929
And another one.

1405
02:06:46,089 --> 02:06:47,849
Crateros.

1406
02:06:49,289 --> 02:06:51,049
Crateros.

1407
02:06:57,449 --> 02:06:59,009
My king.

1408
02:07:00,329 --> 02:07:04,289
I don't like no bellyaching.
I won't tolerate it in any of my units.

1409
02:07:06,009 --> 02:07:08,129
I lost many a man.

1410
02:07:09,169 --> 02:07:11,689
Young ones, never been with a woman.

1411
02:07:12,889 --> 02:07:14,969
Some died of disease.

1412
02:07:15,529 --> 02:07:19,529
Some were butchered in Scythia
by the banks of the Oxus.

1413
02:07:19,689 --> 02:07:21,409
Some died good.

1414
02:07:21,569 --> 02:07:24,449
Some just didn't get no luck.

1415
02:07:25,289 --> 02:07:26,929
But they died.

1416
02:07:29,169 --> 02:07:31,969
Forty thousand I come over with
eight years ago.

1417
02:07:32,129 --> 02:07:36,009
And we march after you
more than 10,000 miles.

1418
02:07:37,049 --> 02:07:40,649
In the rain and the sun,
we fought for you.

1419
02:07:40,809 --> 02:07:43,809
Some of us, 50 battles we've been in.

1420
02:07:44,489 --> 02:07:46,809
We killed many a barbarian.

1421
02:07:48,409 --> 02:07:53,049
And now when I look around,
how many of them faces do I see?

1422
02:07:53,209 --> 02:07:56,809
Now you want us to fight more
of these crazy monkey tribes east of here.

1423
02:07:56,969 --> 02:08:00,409
We hear talk of thousands
of these elephant monsters...

1424
02:08:00,569 --> 02:08:03,369
...cross a hundred more rivers.

1425
02:08:04,209 --> 02:08:08,129
Crateros. Good Crateros.

1426
02:08:08,969 --> 02:08:13,889
Who better than you to speak,
most noble of men.

1427
02:08:14,889 --> 02:08:18,609
But you know there's no part of me
without a scar or a bone broken.

1428
02:08:18,769 --> 02:08:24,329
By sword, knife, stone, catapult and club.
I've shared every hardship with all of you.

1429
02:08:24,489 --> 02:08:27,769
You have, my king,
and we love you for it.

1430
02:08:28,689 --> 02:08:32,129
But, by Zeus, too many have died.

1431
02:08:32,729 --> 02:08:36,129
You have no children, Alexander,
and we're just...

1432
02:08:36,289 --> 02:08:40,769
...humble men, we seek no disturbance
with the gods. All we wish for...

1433
02:08:40,969 --> 02:08:47,169
...is to see our children and our wives
and our grandchildren one last time...

1434
02:08:47,649 --> 02:08:51,289
...before we join our brothers
in that dark house they call Hades.

1435
02:08:55,049 --> 02:08:58,569
Yes. You're right, Crateros.

1436
02:08:58,729 --> 02:09:00,009
I have been negligent.

1437
02:09:02,089 --> 02:09:04,809
I should've sent you
veterans home sooner, and I will.

1438
02:09:04,969 --> 02:09:07,569
The first of you
shall be the Silver Shields.

1439
02:09:07,729 --> 02:09:12,609
Then every man who's served seven years.
With full pensions from our treasury.

1440
02:09:13,889 --> 02:09:17,369
And respected, rich, loved.

1441
02:09:17,529 --> 02:09:22,209
You'll be treated by your wives and children
as heroes for the rest of your lives...

1442
02:09:22,369 --> 02:09:26,369
...and enjoy a peaceful death.

1443
02:09:27,649 --> 02:09:29,689
But you dream, Crateros.

1444
02:09:30,409 --> 02:09:34,569
Your simplicity long ended when
you took Persian mistresses and children...

1445
02:09:34,729 --> 02:09:38,849
...and you thickened your holdings
with plunder and jewels.

1446
02:09:39,529 --> 02:09:44,649
Because you've fallen in love
with all the things in life that destroy men.

1447
02:09:45,609 --> 02:09:47,849
Do you not see?

1448
02:09:48,969 --> 02:09:52,129
And you, as well as I, know...

1449
02:09:52,289 --> 02:09:56,369
...that as the years decline
and the memories stale...

1450
02:09:56,529 --> 02:09:59,209
...and all your great victories fade...

1451
02:09:59,369 --> 02:10:04,809
...it will always be remembered,
you left your king in Asia!

1452
02:10:04,969 --> 02:10:07,529
For I will go on, with my Asians.

1453
02:10:10,889 --> 02:10:15,009
- To the jackals with you, then, Alexander.
- We come for you, and you discard us.

1454
02:10:15,169 --> 02:10:17,449
- Shame!
- We want to go home, Alexander.

1455
02:10:17,609 --> 02:10:19,289
We're tired of glory.

1456
02:10:19,449 --> 02:10:22,249
We want to see our wives
and children before we die.

1457
02:10:24,169 --> 02:10:26,169
I've got children I haven't even seen.

1458
02:10:29,809 --> 02:10:32,729
I want to see my children.

1459
02:10:32,889 --> 02:10:36,489
I paid for your bastard children.
I've taken nothing for myself.

1460
02:10:36,649 --> 02:10:39,769
And all I've asked of you
is one more month.

1461
02:10:42,529 --> 02:10:44,329
- Shame.
- That's your king.

1462
02:10:45,209 --> 02:10:46,729
What would your father say?

1463
02:10:46,889 --> 02:10:49,929
I've taken you further
than my father ever dreamed.

1464
02:10:50,089 --> 02:10:53,889
So go home. I look to the
barbarians for their courage.

1465
02:10:55,129 --> 02:10:56,649
I go east.

1466
02:10:56,809 --> 02:10:58,769
He wants us dead
so we can't speak of his crimes.

1467
02:10:58,929 --> 02:11:01,049
- Who said that?
- We won't make it to Macedonia.

1468
02:11:01,209 --> 02:11:02,929
You despicable coward. Come forth.

1469
02:11:03,089 --> 02:11:05,889
- Make your accusations public.
- So you can have us killed?

1470
02:11:06,049 --> 02:11:08,929
- Son of Zeus.
- You desecrate your real father's memory.

1471
02:11:09,089 --> 02:11:14,969
- Or did you murder him like you did Cleitus?
- Hide in this mob because I'll take your life.

1472
02:11:23,529 --> 02:11:28,089
You men insult my honor, my paternity.
Arrest him.

1473
02:11:28,249 --> 02:11:32,009
And him. Yes.
And you, this loudmouth Demetrius.

1474
02:11:32,169 --> 02:11:35,649
You call me murderer?
I have no such blood on my hands.

1475
02:11:35,809 --> 02:11:38,809
And him.
Yes, you'll know the pain of treason.

1476
02:11:39,969 --> 02:11:43,769
You mock my shame for Cleitus and say
I'd harm a hair of my father's head.

1477
02:11:44,489 --> 02:11:48,089
Arrest him.
After all I've done for you, you swine.

1478
02:11:48,249 --> 02:11:50,089
You cowards. Traitors.

1479
02:11:52,489 --> 02:11:54,809
Come on, then.
Where are your daggers?

1480
02:11:57,089 --> 02:12:01,409
He drove on, south to the outer ocean.

1481
02:12:03,049 --> 02:12:07,209
In smashing the mutiny
and executing the ringleaders...

1482
02:12:07,369 --> 02:12:12,289
...he did nothing, to my mind, that any
general in wartime would not have done.

1483
02:12:12,489 --> 02:12:15,769
But clearly, the army was divided.

1484
02:12:16,649 --> 02:12:20,929
And Alexander was no longer
loved by all.

1485
02:12:32,489 --> 02:12:34,369
Stay calm.

1486
02:12:34,689 --> 02:12:36,449
Together we are strong as gods.

1487
02:12:38,009 --> 02:12:42,409
Cover with your left,
strike hard with your right.

1488
02:12:46,089 --> 02:12:48,449
Fear is rot. A waste of time.

1489
02:12:54,249 --> 02:12:56,329
Lock shields.

1490
02:12:58,809 --> 02:13:00,889
Battle positions.

1491
02:13:02,729 --> 02:13:04,249
Move.

1492
02:13:10,169 --> 02:13:13,249
Choppers, prepare your knives.

1493
02:13:13,449 --> 02:13:15,129
Follow me.

1494
02:13:30,809 --> 02:13:34,089
Strike hard, boys. Strike hard.

1495
02:13:51,489 --> 02:13:55,849
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you hang back? Hurry.

1496
02:13:56,009 --> 02:13:58,169
Cavalry!

1497
02:14:06,369 --> 02:14:09,529
Split to thirds. Regroup and encircle.

1498
02:14:54,609 --> 02:14:59,689
- Oh, no. Cavalry on me.
- Follow Alexander.

1499
02:15:03,009 --> 02:15:06,569
Charge. Charge. Charge.

1500
02:15:09,689 --> 02:15:11,449
The phalanx is in jeopardy.

1501
02:15:11,609 --> 02:15:14,809
Meleager, ride to Pharnakes
and tell him return to the center.

1502
02:15:14,969 --> 02:15:18,649
Find Hephaistion at the riverbank
and bring all cavalry to the center.

1503
02:15:18,809 --> 02:15:21,849
We must reach Crateros
before it's too late.

1504
02:15:37,329 --> 02:15:40,409
Hephaistion. To the center.

1505
02:15:43,049 --> 02:15:45,289
Come, Macedonians. Ride.

1506
02:15:45,449 --> 02:15:47,809
Ride.

1507
02:16:28,929 --> 02:16:31,449
Coenus! Get out of there.

1508
02:16:32,569 --> 02:16:34,009
No.

1509
02:17:02,449 --> 02:17:05,209
- The horses won't go.
- On foot, then.

1510
02:17:11,449 --> 02:17:15,329
Fall back, men! Fall back!

1511
02:17:16,649 --> 02:17:18,169
Come, Bucephalus.

1512
02:17:26,409 --> 02:17:28,609
'Tis only sun and shadow.

1513
02:17:31,249 --> 02:17:33,929
You and I together,
one last time, Bucephalus.

1514
02:17:36,169 --> 02:17:39,289
Isn't it a lovely thing
to live with great courage...

1515
02:17:39,449 --> 02:17:42,089
...and to die leaving an everlasting fame?

1516
02:17:42,649 --> 02:17:45,929
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you retreat?

1517
02:17:46,089 --> 02:17:51,689
Do you want to live forever?
In the name of Zeus, attack.

1518
02:18:07,049 --> 02:18:09,249
Attack.

1519
02:18:10,129 --> 02:18:12,609
Alexander!

1520
02:18:23,049 --> 02:18:24,929
Alexander.

1521
02:19:53,929 --> 02:19:55,529
- The king is down!
- To the king!

1522
02:21:14,529 --> 02:21:20,769
It was the bloodiest of his battles.
Pure butchery, the end of all reason.

1523
02:21:24,529 --> 02:21:26,489
We'd never be men again.

1524
02:23:05,489 --> 02:23:08,969
He lives! Alexander!

1525
02:23:34,969 --> 02:23:37,129
Men of Macedon...

1526
02:23:37,809 --> 02:23:39,849
...we're going home.

1527
02:23:40,929 --> 02:23:43,209
- What?
- What?

1528
02:23:43,369 --> 02:23:45,009
- We're going home.
- Home?

1529
02:23:45,209 --> 02:23:47,249
We're going.

1530
02:23:51,689 --> 02:23:53,569
We're going home.

1531
02:24:55,889 --> 02:24:58,849
His life should have ended in India...

1532
02:24:59,969 --> 02:25:01,889
...but that's myth.

1533
02:25:03,529 --> 02:25:09,129
In life, Herakles died of a poisoned shirt,
given him in error by his jealous wife.

1534
02:25:12,609 --> 02:25:16,329
Making his devotions to the gods
at the end of the great journey...

1535
02:25:16,489 --> 02:25:21,129
...Alexander bade the East farewell
and marched his army directly west...

1536
02:25:21,289 --> 02:25:23,369
...across the great Gedrosian desert...

1537
02:25:23,569 --> 02:25:26,889
...seeking the shortest route home
to Babylon.

1538
02:25:28,049 --> 02:25:32,769
To this day, there is no accounting
of how many died.

1539
02:25:34,649 --> 02:25:38,249
It was the worst blunder of his life.

1540
02:25:38,409 --> 02:25:42,689
And when he finally reentered Babylon,
after six years in the Far East...

1541
02:25:42,889 --> 02:25:48,609
...Alexander again seized the imagination
of the world by taking two more wives.

1542
02:26:09,769 --> 02:26:12,609
- Just last night he was...
- It's the water, Your Majesty.

1543
02:26:12,769 --> 02:26:14,889
He mixed it with the wine.

1544
02:26:15,929 --> 02:26:17,489
But how can this be?

1545
02:26:17,649 --> 02:26:21,529
- Typhus of India?
- I wouldn't tax yourself, Your Majesty.

1546
02:26:21,689 --> 02:26:26,369
A few good nights' rest will do it.
But no wine or cold...

1547
02:26:27,449 --> 02:26:28,809
Come, doctor.

1548
02:26:37,049 --> 02:26:39,289
I feel better.

1549
02:26:39,889 --> 02:26:43,609
Soon, I'll be up.

1550
02:26:44,489 --> 02:26:48,249
We leave for Arabia in the spring,
and I couldn't leave without you.

1551
02:26:48,809 --> 02:26:51,129
Arabia.

1552
02:26:53,769 --> 02:26:58,889
You used to dress me up like a sheik...

1553
02:26:59,529 --> 02:27:01,369
...wave your wooden scimitar.

1554
02:27:01,529 --> 02:27:04,489
You were the only one
who'd never let me win.

1555
02:27:06,249 --> 02:27:09,129
The only one who's ever been
honest with me.

1556
02:27:09,609 --> 02:27:12,409
You saved me from myself.

1557
02:27:14,729 --> 02:27:17,769
Please don't leave me, Hephaistion.

1558
02:27:19,689 --> 02:27:22,009
My Alexander.

1559
02:27:23,529 --> 02:27:29,049
I remember the young man who wanted
to be Achilles and then outdid him.

1560
02:27:29,209 --> 02:27:33,369
And you, Patroclus.
And then what happened?

1561
02:27:33,529 --> 02:27:36,769
Ours is a myth only young men believe.

1562
02:27:37,329 --> 02:27:43,249
- But how beautiful a myth it was.
- We reach, we fall.

1563
02:27:44,449 --> 02:27:47,289
Oh, Hephaistion.

1564
02:27:52,689 --> 02:27:58,049
- I worry for you without me.
- I am nothing without you.

1565
02:27:58,969 --> 02:28:02,529
Come, fight, Hephaistion.

1566
02:28:02,809 --> 02:28:05,209
We will die together.

1567
02:28:06,809 --> 02:28:09,129
It's our destiny.

1568
02:28:12,209 --> 02:28:17,569
We'll have children with our wives, and
our sons will play together as we once did.

1569
02:28:18,569 --> 02:28:22,049
A thousand ships
we'll launch from here, Hephaistion.

1570
02:28:22,729 --> 02:28:27,289
We'll round Arabia
and sail up the gulf to Egypt.

1571
02:28:28,089 --> 02:28:32,409
From there, we'll build a channel through
the desert and out to the Middle Sea.

1572
02:28:32,569 --> 02:28:37,289
And then we'll move on Carthage. And that
great island, Sicily, they'll pay large tribute.

1573
02:28:37,449 --> 02:28:41,609
After that, the Roman tribe,
good fighters. We'll beat them.

1574
02:28:42,569 --> 02:28:45,009
And then explore the northern forests...

1575
02:28:45,169 --> 02:28:48,769
...and out the Pillars of Herakles
to the western ocean.

1576
02:28:49,969 --> 02:28:54,049
And then one day,
not 10 years from now...

1577
02:28:54,609 --> 02:28:59,169
...Babylon, with its deep-water harbor,
will be the center of the world.

1578
02:28:59,329 --> 02:29:04,249
Alexandrias will grow,
populations will mix and travel freely.

1579
02:29:04,409 --> 02:29:07,009
Asia and Europe will come together.

1580
02:29:08,729 --> 02:29:12,489
And we'll grow old, Hephaistion...

1581
02:29:13,129 --> 02:29:18,529
...looking out our balcony
at this new world.

1582
02:29:24,729 --> 02:29:27,049
Hephaistion?

1583
02:29:28,369 --> 02:29:30,649
Hephaistion?

1584
02:29:37,329 --> 02:29:41,769
- Where is this doctor?
- I can't explain this, Your Majesty.

1585
02:29:41,929 --> 02:29:46,169
- It's not possible. I swear by Apollo.
- Execute him!

1586
02:29:46,969 --> 02:29:50,329
Take him out now and execute him.

1587
02:29:50,489 --> 02:29:54,529
- Come away, come away.
- Liars. Liars. You all hated him. All of you.

1588
02:29:55,209 --> 02:29:58,689
Get out. Get out now!

1589
02:30:06,329 --> 02:30:08,729
Be gone.

1590
02:30:08,889 --> 02:30:13,609
Be gone with you.
Harpies. Get out. Get out.

1591
02:30:13,769 --> 02:30:15,529
Are you drunk again?

1592
02:30:15,689 --> 02:30:17,209
- Get out.
- He's dead.

1593
02:30:17,369 --> 02:30:20,009
- Who?
- Many hated him...

1594
02:30:20,169 --> 02:30:23,009
...but I don't think any other
would have dared.

1595
02:30:24,449 --> 02:30:26,409
Hephaistion is dead?

1596
02:30:30,209 --> 02:30:32,089
Are you mad?

1597
02:30:34,129 --> 02:30:35,609
You monster.

1598
02:30:36,769 --> 02:30:39,569
- Are you mad?
- You've taken from me all I've ever loved.

1599
02:30:39,729 --> 02:30:43,769
May all the Furies through time
damn your miserable heart. Obey me.

1600
02:30:44,809 --> 02:30:49,249
Alexander.
I have your child. Alexander.

1601
02:30:50,729 --> 02:30:53,409
- Alexander, we have a son.
- No.

1602
02:30:54,969 --> 02:30:57,409
- The child.
- Oh, Your Majesty, no.

1603
02:30:57,569 --> 02:31:03,689
Alexander, I have your child.
Alexander, my husband, my king.

1604
02:31:03,849 --> 02:31:06,209
We have a son.

1605
02:31:06,689 --> 02:31:09,929
My poor, poor, ill-fated son.

1606
02:31:11,529 --> 02:31:13,089
Never touch me again.

1607
02:31:16,369 --> 02:31:18,329
No!

1608
02:31:23,689 --> 02:31:26,369
One last toast!

1609
02:31:29,569 --> 02:31:31,369
Before the dawn.

1610
02:31:38,129 --> 02:31:41,169
To my old friends.

1611
02:31:57,409 --> 02:32:01,129
- And to the myths.
- To the myths.

1612
02:32:09,049 --> 02:32:11,289
Drink it down, Alexander.

1613
02:32:11,449 --> 02:32:13,449
Drink it down.

1614
02:32:27,289 --> 02:32:30,529
Yes, come on. Finish it.

1615
02:32:49,449 --> 02:32:51,489
To the next dawn.

1616
02:33:06,249 --> 02:33:08,449
Yes, come.

1617
02:33:08,649 --> 02:33:14,849
Come to Babylon. I await you.
Your only loving son.

1618
02:33:23,529 --> 02:33:26,569
Wait. Wait.

1619
02:33:27,369 --> 02:33:29,529
Vultures. Wait.

1620
02:33:29,689 --> 02:33:32,249
Your son, Alexander.

1621
02:33:32,409 --> 02:33:34,889
Just three more months.

1622
02:33:35,049 --> 02:33:38,849
Please live. Alexander.

1623
02:33:39,009 --> 02:33:43,449
Alexander, we beg you. Tell us who.

1624
02:33:43,609 --> 02:33:46,409
Who will rule this great empire
if you leave us?

1625
02:33:46,609 --> 02:33:49,569
- Fear not. We're at the beginning.
- You're a great man.

1626
02:33:50,729 --> 02:33:52,729
The myth becomes real.

1627
02:33:57,849 --> 02:34:00,169
Beyond Herakles.

1628
02:34:04,889 --> 02:34:08,409
When it's over, all that matters is
what you've done. I'll remember.

1629
02:34:08,569 --> 02:34:11,369
Zeus is your father.

1630
02:34:12,329 --> 02:34:14,529
Alexander, the army will divide.

1631
02:34:14,689 --> 02:34:17,449
Satrapies will revolt.
Without orders, there'll be war.

1632
02:34:17,609 --> 02:34:18,849
Who will it be?

1633
02:34:19,969 --> 02:34:22,369
Pray tell us, who?

1634
02:34:24,649 --> 02:34:27,209
- What did he say?
- "To the best."

1635
02:34:29,209 --> 02:34:31,489
- He said, "To the best."
- What?

1636
02:34:31,649 --> 02:34:33,889
- No, he said, "To Crateros."
- To Crateros?

1637
02:34:34,049 --> 02:34:35,649
Why would he say Crateros?

1638
02:35:34,609 --> 02:35:38,689
On the 10th of June,
a month short of his 33rd year...

1639
02:35:38,849 --> 02:35:43,089
...Alexander's great heart
finally gave out.

1640
02:35:43,249 --> 02:35:47,289
And as he vowed,
he joined Hephaistion.

1641
02:35:50,489 --> 02:35:53,089
But in his short life,
he achieved, without doubt...

1642
02:35:53,249 --> 02:35:58,409
...the mythic glory
of his ancestor Achilles and more.

1643
02:36:01,609 --> 02:36:04,129
His sacrifice was an early death...

1644
02:36:04,329 --> 02:36:06,569
...but in keeping
to his side of the bargain...

1645
02:36:06,729 --> 02:36:10,409
...I cannot help but feel
he conquered death as well.

1646
02:36:13,049 --> 02:36:15,849
Olympias' transgression
in the murder of his father...

1647
02:36:16,009 --> 02:36:18,649
...is, to my mind, a probability.

1648
02:36:18,809 --> 02:36:21,289
His, a burden.

1649
02:36:22,129 --> 02:36:26,329
Alexander was too in love with glory
for him to steal it.

1650
02:36:26,489 --> 02:36:31,889
But by blood, and blood alone,
he was guilty.

1651
02:36:34,569 --> 02:36:36,489
No!

1652
02:36:41,969 --> 02:36:44,129
- The body stays in Babylon.
- Within hours...

1653
02:36:44,329 --> 02:36:47,169
...we were fighting like jackals
for his corpse.

1654
02:36:47,369 --> 02:36:49,409
The wars of the world had begun.

1655
02:36:49,929 --> 02:36:51,929
Forty years, off and on, they endured.

1656
02:36:52,529 --> 02:36:56,729
Cassander in Greece.
Crateros and Antigonus in western Asia.

1657
02:36:56,889 --> 02:37:01,089
Solucas and Perdiccas in the East.
Myself in Egypt.

1658
02:37:01,249 --> 02:37:06,409
- Until we divided his empire in four parts.
- Gentlemen, we are not savages.

1659
02:37:06,569 --> 02:37:09,089
Cassander certainly proved
his will to power...

1660
02:37:09,289 --> 02:37:13,649
...when seven years later,
he had Olympias executed.

1661
02:37:14,409 --> 02:37:16,969
And within 12 years, he achieved...

1662
02:37:17,129 --> 02:37:19,969
...the complete destruction
of Alexander's bloodline...

1663
02:37:21,449 --> 02:37:23,289
...when he poisoned Roxane...

1664
02:37:23,449 --> 02:37:28,969
...and Alexander's 13-year-old son,
the true heir to the empire.

1665
02:37:31,689 --> 02:37:35,169
But the truth is never simple...

1666
02:37:36,009 --> 02:37:38,009
...and yet it is.

1667
02:37:38,449 --> 02:37:41,369
The truth is, we did kill him.

1668
02:37:44,809 --> 02:37:48,089
By silence, we consented.

1669
02:37:48,489 --> 02:37:50,409
Because...

1670
02:37:50,569 --> 02:37:52,969
Because we couldn't go on.

1671
02:37:53,129 --> 02:37:58,249
What, by Ares, did we look forward to
but to be discarded in the end, like Cleitus?

1672
02:37:58,409 --> 02:38:03,449
After all this time, to give away our wealth
to Asian sycophants we despised?

1673
02:38:03,609 --> 02:38:06,689
Mixing the races, harmony?

1674
02:38:07,649 --> 02:38:10,289
Oh, he talked of these things...

1675
02:38:10,449 --> 02:38:15,969
...but wasn't it really about Alexander
and another population ready to obey him?

1676
02:38:16,969 --> 02:38:19,809
I never believed in his dream.

1677
02:38:19,969 --> 02:38:22,009
None of us did.

1678
02:38:23,689 --> 02:38:25,849
That's the truth of his life.

1679
02:38:26,009 --> 02:38:28,489
The dreamers exhaust us.

1680
02:38:29,209 --> 02:38:33,209
They must die before they kill us
with their blasted dreams.

1681
02:38:34,529 --> 02:38:37,289
Oh, just throw all that away, Cadmos.

1682
02:38:37,449 --> 02:38:39,769
It's an old fool's rubbish.

1683
02:38:41,529 --> 02:38:46,729
You shall write, "He died of fever
and a weakened condition."

1684
02:38:47,489 --> 02:38:49,249
Yes, great Pharaoh.

1685
02:38:49,409 --> 02:38:53,129
Oh, he could've stayed home in Macedonia,
married, raised a family.

1686
02:38:54,329 --> 02:38:57,249
He'd have died a celebrated man.

1687
02:38:59,529 --> 02:39:02,209
But this was not Alexander.

1688
02:39:02,529 --> 02:39:08,169
All his life,
he fought to free himself from fear.

1689
02:39:08,329 --> 02:39:14,249
And by this, and this alone,
he was made free.

1690
02:39:15,609 --> 02:39:19,409
The freest man I've ever known.

1691
02:39:21,009 --> 02:39:25,809
His tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness...

1692
02:39:25,969 --> 02:39:29,569
...and impatience with those
who could not understand.

1693
02:39:29,889 --> 02:39:32,449
And if his desire...

1694
02:39:32,649 --> 02:39:37,329
...to reconcile Greek and barbarian
ended in failure...

1695
02:39:39,769 --> 02:39:42,769
What failure!

1696
02:39:43,049 --> 02:39:48,929
His failure towered
over other men's successes.

1697
02:39:53,409 --> 02:39:55,089
I've lived...

1698
02:39:55,289 --> 02:39:57,569
I've lived long life, Cadmos...

1699
02:39:57,729 --> 02:40:00,009
...but the glory
and the memory of man...

1700
02:40:00,169 --> 02:40:04,889
...will always belong to the ones
who follow their great visions.

1701
02:40:05,329 --> 02:40:10,369
And the greatest of these
is the one they now call...

1702
02:40:11,529 --> 02:40:15,249
...Megas Alexandros.

1703
02:40:16,649 --> 02:40:19,689
The greatest Alexander of them all.
