1
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:16,833
When shall we three meet again?

2
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:20,708
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

3
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,374
When the hurly-burly's done.

4
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,583
When the battle's lost and won.

5
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:27,458
Where the place?

6
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:31,124
Upon the battlefield,
there to meet with Macbeth.

7
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,249
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.

8
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,499
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

9
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:19,958
Doubtful it stood, as two spent
swimmers that do cling together

10
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,416
and choke their art.

11
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,208
'The merciless Macdonwald
from the Western Isles

12
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:28,166
'of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied.'

13
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,874
And fortune,
on his damned quarrel smiling,

14
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,999
showed like a rebel's whore.

15
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,291
But all's too weak, for brave Macbeth...

16
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,791
well he deserves that name...

17
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:45,958
disdaining fortune,
with his brandished steel

18
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:49,833
which smoked with bloody execution,

19
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,374
like valour's minion

20
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,583
carved out his passage
till he faced the slave

21
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:57,458
which ne'er shook hands

22
00:07:57,584 --> 00:07:59,749
nor bade farewell to him

23
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,666
till he unseamed him
from the nave to the chops

24
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:06,833
and fixed his head upon our battlements.

25
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,666
And, to conclude,

26
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,999
victory fell on us.

27
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:20,624
Valiant Macbeth.

28
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,874
Worthy gentleman.

29
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,624
Great happiness.

30
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,291
Whence cam'st thou, noble Prince?

31
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,166
From Fife, great King,

32
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:47,666
where Norwegian banners flout the sky
and fan our people cold,

33
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:51,416
assisted by that most disloyal traitor,

34
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:53,416
the Thane of Cawdor.

35
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:02,624
God save the King!

36
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:18,749
No more that Thane of Cawdor
shall deceive our bosom interest.

37
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:23,624
Go pronounce his present death

38
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,333
and with his former title greet Macbeth.

39
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,458
I'll see it done.

40
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:36,041
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.

41
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,749
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

42
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,083
What are these?

43
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:58,499
Live you or are you aught
that man may question?

44
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,708
Speak, if you can. What are you?

45
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,833
Macbeth. Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.

46
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,791
Macbeth. Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor.

47
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,583
All hail, Macbeth,
that shalt be king hereafter.

48
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,291
Good sir,

49
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:49,499
why do you start and seem to fear
things that do sound so fair?

50
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,708
My noble partner
you greet with present grace

51
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:55,916
and great prediction
of noble having and of royal hope

52
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,583
that he seems rapt withal.

53
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,124
To me you speak not.

54
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,916
Hail, lesser than Macbeth and greater.

55
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,874
Not so happy yet much happier.

56
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:10,749
Thou shalt get kings though thou be none.

57
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,999
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.

58
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:18,499
'Banquo and Macbeth,

59
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,958
'all hail.'

60
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:40,333
Stay, you imperfect speakers.
Tell me more.

61
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,791
Say from whence you owe
this strange intelligence

62
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,583
and why, upon this blasted heath,

63
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:48,208
you stop our way
with such prophetic greeting.

64
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,833
Speak, I charge you.

65
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:05,041
The earth hath bubbles as the water has,
and these are of them.

66
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,999
Whither are they vanished?

67
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,249
Into the air,

68
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,374
and what seemed corporal
melted as breath into the wind.

69
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,916
Would they had stayed.

70
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,999
Were such things here
as we do speak about?

71
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:25,124
Or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner?

72
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,458
Your children shall be kings.

73
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,999
You shall be king.

74
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,666
And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?

75
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,833
To the selfsame tune and words.

76
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:03,708
The King hath happily received, Macbeth,

77
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,874
the news of thy success.

78
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,124
As thick as hail came post from post

79
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,458
and every one did bear thy praises,
in his kingdom's great defence,

80
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:19,083
and poured them down before him.

81
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,958
And we are sent to give thee
from our royal master thanks.

82
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,708
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,

83
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:31,041
he bade me from him
call thee Thane of Cawdor.

84
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,708
The Thane of Cawdor lives.

85
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,083
Why do you dress me in borrowed robes?

86
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,208
Treasons capital, confessed and proved,
have overthrown him.

87
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,749
Do you not hope
your children shall be kings

88
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,166
when those that gave
the Thane of Cawdor to me

89
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:13,166
promised no less to them?

90
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:18,499
That trusted home might yet
enkindle you unto the crown

91
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,624
besides the Thane of Cawdor.

92
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,124
But 'tis strange,

93
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:28,708
and oftentimes, to win us to our harm,

94
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,291
the instruments of darkness
tell us truths,

95
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,416
win us with honest trifles

96
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:38,083
to betray's in deepest consequence.

97
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,708
This supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill,

98
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,124
cannot be good.

99
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:59,458
If ill, why hath it given me
earnest of success,

100
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,541
commencing in a truth?

101
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,833
I am Thane of Cawdor.

102
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,249
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion

103
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,499
whose horrid image doth unfix my hair

104
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,583
and make my seated heart knock at my ribs

105
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,333
against the use of nature?

106
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,999
Present fears are less
than horrible imaginings.

107
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,416
If chance will have me king,

108
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,458
why, chance may crown me without my stir.

109
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,541
Hail, Macbeth.

110
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,666
O worthiest cousin.

111
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,041
More is thy due
than more than all can pay.

112
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:37,958
The service and the loyalty I owe
in doing it pays itself.

113
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,624
From hence to Inverness,
and bind us further to you.

114
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:47,833
I'll be myself the harbinger

115
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,916
and make joyful the hearing of my wife
with your approach,

116
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,083
so humbly take my leave.

117
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,374
My worthy Cawdor.

118
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:55,624
"They met me in the day of success

119
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,041
"and I have learned
by the perfect'st report

120
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,374
"they have more in them
than mortal knowledge.

121
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,874
"When I burned in desire
to question them further,

122
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,708
"they made themselves air
into which they vanished.

123
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:17,083
"Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it
came missives from the King

124
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:20,749
"who all-hailed me

125
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,833
"Thane of Cawdor,

126
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:28,083
"by which title before
these Weird Sisters saluted me

127
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,333
"and referred me
to the coming on of time with,

128
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,999
"'Hail, king that shalt be."'

129
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,124
Come,

130
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,458
you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts,

131
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,833
unsex me here

132
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:56,624
and fill me from the crown to the toe
top-full of direst cruelty.

133
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:02,333
Come to my woman's breasts
and take my milk for gall,

134
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:04,374
you murthering ministers,

135
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:09,416
wherever, in your sightless substances,
you wait on nature's mischief.

136
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:14,499
Come, thick night,

137
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,249
and pall thee
in the dunnest smoke of hell,

138
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,833
that my keen knife see not
the wound it makes,

139
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:25,374
nor heaven peep
through the blanket of the dark

140
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,333
to cry, "Hold, hold!"

141
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:35,208
Hie thee hither
that I may pour my spirits in thine ear

142
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,083
and chastise with the valour of my tongue

143
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:42,291
all that impedes thee
from the golden round.

144
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,291
Thy letters have transported me
beyond this ignorant present

145
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:51,958
and I feel now the future in the instant.

146
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,124
My dearest love,

147
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,666
Duncan comes here tonight.

148
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:10,458
And when goes hence?

149
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,874
Tomorrow, as he purposes.

150
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,541
O never shall sun that morrow see!

151
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:33,416
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor,

152
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:37,791
and shalt be what thou art promised.

153
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,791
Yet I do fear thy nature.

154
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:50,916
It is too full o' the milk
of human kindness

155
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:52,624
to catch the nearest way.

156
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:58,291
Thou wouldst be great.

157
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:02,874
Art not without ambition
but without the illness should attend it.

158
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,958
To beguile the time, look like the time.

159
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:15,416
Bear welcome in your eye,
your hand, your tongue.

160
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:19,749
Look like the innocent flower
but be the serpent under't.

161
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,208
He that's coming must be provided for

162
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:31,874
and you shall put this night's
great business into my dispatch

163
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:38,499
which shall,
to all our nights and days to come,

164
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,083
give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

165
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,958
We will speak further.

166
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:18,124
All our service, in every point
twice done and then done double.

167
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,208
Give me your hand.
Conduct me to mine host.

168
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:26,624
We love him highly and shall continue
our graces towards him.

169
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,874
By your leave, hostess.

170
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:28,958
My plenteous...

171
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,499
Up!

172
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:33,499
Up!

173
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:40,249
My plenteous joys,

174
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,124
wanton in fulness,

175
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,249
seek to hide themselves
in drops of sorrow.

176
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,166
Sons,

177
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:52,416
kinsmen,

178
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,499
thanes,

179
00:25:56,459 --> 00:26:00,249
and you whose places are the nearest,

180
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:06,333
know that we will establish our estate
upon our eldest, Malcolm,

181
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:14,666
whom we name hereafter
the Prince of Cumberland.

182
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,624
'The Prince of Cumberland.

183
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,416
'That is a step on which I must fall down,
or else o'erleap,

184
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,541
'for in my way it lies.'

185
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,666
If it were done when 'tis done,

186
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:42,999
then 'twere well it were done quickly.

187
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:49,416
If the assassination
could trammel up the consequence

188
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:52,458
and catch with his surcease success,

189
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:56,541
that but this blow might be
the be-all and end-all here.

190
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,666
But here upon this bank and shoal of time

191
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,416
we'd jump the life to come.

192
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:06,374
Does anybody know what this is?

193
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,541
But in these cases we still
have judgement here.

194
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:13,833
That we but teach bloody instructions
which return to plague the inventor.

195
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:15,833
This even-handed justice commends

196
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:18,999
the ingredience of our poisoned chalice
to our own lips.

197
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:22,249
He's here in double trust.

198
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:27,083
First, as I am
his kinsman and his subject,

199
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:29,333
strong both against the deed.

200
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:32,958
Then, as his host, who should
against his murderer shut the door,

201
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,999
not bear the knife myself.

202
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:42,999
Besides, this Duncan
hath borne his faculties so meek,

203
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,749
hath been so clear in his great office,

204
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:48,416
that his virtues would plead like angels,

205
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:52,541
trumpet-tongued against
the deep damnation of his taking-off.

206
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:56,416
I have no spur
to prick the sides of my intent

207
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,999
but only vaulting ambition

208
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:02,208
which o'erleaps itself
and falls on the other.

209
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:38,666
We will proceed no further
in this business.

210
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,083
Was the hope drunk
wherein you dressed yourself?

211
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,249
Hath it slept since?

212
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,874
And wakes it now to look so green and pale

213
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,833
at what it did so freely?

214
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,708
From this time

215
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,874
such I account thy love.

216
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:11,083
Art thou afeard to be the same
in thine own act and valour

217
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,874
as thou art in desire?

218
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:17,874
Wouldst thou have that
which thou esteem'st the ornament of life

219
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,874
and live a coward in thy own esteem,

220
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,624
letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would"?

221
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,749
Prithee, peace.

222
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:29,124
I dare do all that may become a man.

223
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:33,291
Who dares do more is none.

224
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,249
What beast was't, then,

225
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,041
that made you break this enterprise to me?

226
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:44,833
When you durst do it, then you were a man.

227
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,124
And to be more than what you were,

228
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,624
you would be so much more the man.

229
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,083
I have given suck

230
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:03,041
and know how tender 'tis
to love the babe that milks me.

231
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:07,833
I would, while it was smiling in my face,

232
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:10,874
have plucked my nipple
from his boneless gums

233
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,333
and dashed the brains out

234
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:16,041
had I so sworn, as you have done, to this.

235
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:20,916
If we should fail?

236
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:30,166
We fail.

237
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:36,749
But screw your courage
to the sticking place

238
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,708
and we'll not fail.

239
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,166
When Duncan is asleep

240
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:12,708
his two chamberlains will I
with wine and wassail so convince

241
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:17,249
that memory, the warder of the brain,
shall be a-fume

242
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,958
and the receipt of reason a limbeck only.

243
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:25,458
When in swinish sleep
their drenched natures lie as in a death

244
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:29,458
what cannot you and I perform
upon the unguarded Duncan?

245
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:33,333
What not put upon his spongy officers

246
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:36,208
who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell?

247
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,249
I am settled

248
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:04,541
and bend up each corporal agent
to this terrible feat.

249
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,499
Take my sword.

250
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:33,333
Take thee that too.

251
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:51,833
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me

252
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,208
and yet I would not sleep.

253
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,999
Merciful powers,

254
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:05,374
restrain in me the cursed thoughts
that nature gives way to in repose.

255
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:57,374
Is this a dagger which I see before me?

256
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,583
The handle toward my hand.

257
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:14,374
Come,

258
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:20,708
let me clutch thee.

259
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,999
Art thou not, fatal vision,

260
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,374
sensible to feeling as to sight?

261
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:38,583
Or art thou but a dagger of the mind?

262
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:44,958
A false creation, proceeding
from the heat-oppressed brain.

263
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:56,041
Thou marshall'st me
the way that I was going

264
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:59,374
and such an instrument I was to use.

265
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:06,499
Mine eyes are made the fools
o' the other senses.

266
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:09,541
Or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still.

267
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:18,916
There's no such thing.

268
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:22,458
It is the bloody business
which informs thus to mine eyes.

269
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,791
Now, o'er the one half-world,

270
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,874
nature seems dead

271
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,916
and wicked dreams abuse
the curtained sleep.

272
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:34,958
Witchcraft celebrates

273
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:38,083
and withered murder moves like a ghost.

274
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:53,208
I see thee yet,

275
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,791
in form as palpable
as this which now I draw.

276
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:02,333
Whiles I threat, he lives.

277
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,541
Words to the heat of deeds
too cold breath gives.

278
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,083
The spring,

279
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:05,833
the head,

280
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,291
the fountain of your blood is stopped.

281
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,374
The very source of it is stopped.

282
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:17,249
Here lies Duncan,

283
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:21,374
his silver skin laced
with his golden blood.

284
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,416
There the murderers,

285
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:27,083
steeped in the colours of their trade.

286
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:36,666
Had I but died an hour before this chance,

287
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:40,291
I had lived a blessed time.

288
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:44,416
But from this instant

289
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:47,374
there's nothing serious in mortality.

290
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,833
All is but toys.

291
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:53,791
Renown and grace is dead.

292
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,874
The wine of life is drawn

293
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,458
and the mere lees is left
this vault to brag of.

294
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,208
Live you?

295
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,791
Or are you aught that man may question?

296
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,999
I have done the deed.

297
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:29,666
Why did you bring these daggers
from the place?

298
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:34,124
They must lie there.

299
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,666
What hands are here?

300
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:29,541
'They pluck out mine eyes.'

301
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:37,083
Will all great Neptune's ocean
wash this blood clean from my hand?

302
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:40,624
No,

303
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:46,666
this my hand will rather
the multitudinous seas incarnadine,

304
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:52,333
making the green one red.

305
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,291
My hands are of your colour,

306
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,624
but I shame to wear a heart so white.

307
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:11,541
A little water clears us of this deed.

308
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,458
How easy is it then.

309
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,999
To know my deed

310
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:22,208
'twere best not know myself.

311
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:20,624
Good Macduff.

312
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,166
Good morrow, noble sir.

313
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:23,958
Good morrow, both.

314
00:43:24,084 --> 00:43:26,458
Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?

315
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,041
- The King, is he stirring?
- Not yet.

316
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,791
He did command me to call timely on him.

317
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,666
I have almost slipped the hour.

318
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:38,583
I'll bring you to him.

319
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:56,708
I'll make so bold to call.

320
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:09,249
- Goes the King hence today?
- He does; he did appoint so.

321
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:14,666
The night has been unruly.

322
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:20,374
Where we lay, our temples were blown down

323
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:23,916
and, as they say,

324
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:27,749
lamentings heard in the air,

325
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,791
strange screams of death.

326
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:34,333
'Twas a rough night.

327
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:55,416
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.

328
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:58,541
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke open

329
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:00,166
the Lord's anointed temple

330
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:03,666
and stole thence the life of the building.

331
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:06,249
The life?

332
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:07,999
Mean you His Majesty?

333
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:10,916
Bid me not speak. You see.

334
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,041
Speak yourselves.

335
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,833
Awake!

336
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,083
Awake!

337
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:37,874
Ring the alarum bells!

338
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,291
Malcolm!

339
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:41,666
Malcolm!

340
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:43,541
Banquo!

341
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,249
Ring the alarum bells.

342
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:48,666
Banquo!

343
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:52,291
Shake off your downy sleep, man.

344
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,416
Death's counterfeit.
You come and look on death itself.

345
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:56,916
Huh?

346
00:45:57,917 --> 00:45:59,833
Murder!

347
00:45:59,959 --> 00:46:01,166
Treason!

348
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,958
What's the business?

349
00:46:22,084 --> 00:46:26,083
Our royal master, he's murdered.

350
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:29,374
- Murdered?
- Murdered!

351
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,708
Those of his chamber,

352
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:34,624
their hands were all badged with blood.

353
00:46:54,334 --> 00:46:55,958
Wherefore did you so?

354
00:46:56,084 --> 00:46:57,666
Hm?

355
00:46:57,792 --> 00:47:01,208
Who could refrain that had a heart to love

356
00:47:01,334 --> 00:47:05,749
and in that heart
courage to make love known?

357
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,166
How it does grieve Macbeth.

358
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:44,166
Did he not straight, in pious rage,

359
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:46,958
the two delinquents tear

360
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:49,999
that were the slaves of drink?

361
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,624
Was this not nobly done?

362
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,333
Ay.

363
00:47:54,459 --> 00:47:57,291
'Twould have angered any heart alive
to hear the men deny it.

364
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,458
I say he has borne all things well.

365
00:48:01,334 --> 00:48:03,791
Is't known who did
this more than bloody deed?

366
00:48:06,334 --> 00:48:08,833
Those that Macbeth hath slain.

367
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,874
Alas, the day.
What good could they pretend?

368
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,624
Malcolm, the King's son,
is stolen away and fled,

369
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,791
which puts upon him suspicion of the deed.

370
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:23,541
'Tis most like the sovereignty
will fall upon Macbeth.

371
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,124
He is already named.

372
00:48:45,709 --> 00:48:48,208
'Thou hast it now.

373
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:50,583
'King, Cawdor,

374
00:48:51,584 --> 00:48:53,291
'Glamis,

375
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:56,458
'all as the weird women promised.

376
00:48:56,584 --> 00:49:00,041
'And I fear
thou playedst most foully for't.

377
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:03,499
'Yet it was said
it should not stand in thy posterity.'

378
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,583
But that myself should be
the root and father of many kings.

379
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:11,583
If there come truth from them,

380
00:49:11,709 --> 00:49:15,999
why, by the verities on thee made good,
may they not be my oracles as well

381
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:18,708
and set me up in hope?

382
00:49:23,334 --> 00:49:25,666
But hush.

383
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:27,208
No more.

384
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:33,791
Hail, Macbeth.

385
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:36,666
Hail, Macbeth. Hail, Macbeth.

386
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:46,208
Hail, Macbeth.

387
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:47,833
Hail, Macbeth.

388
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:46,291
'To be thus... is nothing,

389
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:48,374
'but to be safely thus!

390
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:55,041
'Our fears in Banquo stick deep.'

391
00:50:55,167 --> 00:51:00,624
And in his royalty of nature
reigns that which would be feared.

392
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:03,624
'Tis much he dares

393
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:07,416
and to that dauntless temper
of his mind...

394
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:15,458
...he hath a wisdom
that doth guide his valour.

395
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:30,083
How now, my Lord? Why do you keep alone?

396
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:33,791
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.

397
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:39,541
She'll close and be herself

398
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:42,916
whilst our poor malice remains
in danger of her former tooth.

399
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:50,166
Things without all remedy
should be without regard.

400
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:54,749
What's done is done.

401
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,166
Come, gentle my Lord.

402
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:06,583
Sleek o'er your rugged looks.

403
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:11,249
Be bright and jovial
among your guests tonight.

404
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,833
Thou know'st that Banquo,
and his Fleance, lives?

405
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,166
You must leave this.

406
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,791
He chid the sisters

407
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:47,999
when first they put
the name of king upon me

408
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,749
and bade them speak to him.

409
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:56,958
Then, prophet-like,
they hailed him father to a line of kings.

410
00:52:57,542 --> 00:53:00,083
Upon my head

411
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:02,166
they placed a fruitless crown

412
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:04,833
and put a barren sceptre in my grip,

413
00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:08,083
thence to be wrenched
with an unlineal hand,

414
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,791
no son of mine succeeding.

415
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,999
If it be so,

416
00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:22,874
for Banquo's issue have I filed my mind.

417
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:27,583
For them

418
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:30,291
the gracious Duncan have I murdered,

419
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:33,958
put rancours in the vessel of my peace

420
00:53:34,084 --> 00:53:36,083
only for them.

421
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:39,291
To make them kings,

422
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:46,791
the seed of Banquo kings!

423
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:51,666
What's to be done?

424
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,999
Be innocent of the knowledge,
dearest chuck,

425
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,666
till thou applaud the deed.

426
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:05,166
Full, full of scorpions, is my mind.

427
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,999
Thou marvell'st at my words.

428
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:22,124
Hold thee still.

429
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:27,499
Things bad begun
make themselves strong by ill.

430
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,874
Come, seeling night.

431
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:39,874
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day

432
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,541
and, with thy bloody and invisible hand,

433
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:46,874
cancel...

434
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,749
and tear to pieces that great bond
which keeps me pale.

435
00:55:29,209 --> 00:55:30,208
Get up!

436
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:54,083
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,

437
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:58,124
and I'll request your presence.

438
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:01,249
Let Your Highness command upon me
to the which my duties are,

439
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:04,624
with a most indissoluble tie,
forever knit.

440
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,749
Ride you this afternoon?

441
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,166
Ay, my good Lord.

442
00:56:20,792 --> 00:56:24,291
We should have else desired
your good advice in this day's council,

443
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:27,458
but we'll take tomorrow.

444
00:56:30,959 --> 00:56:32,333
Is't far you ride?

445
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,208
As far, my Lord, as will fill up the time
'twixt this and supper,

446
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:40,208
go not my horse the better.

447
00:56:42,792 --> 00:56:44,874
Fail not our feast.

448
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:49,208
My Lord, I will not.

449
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:03,208
We hear our bloody cousin
is bestowed in England,

450
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:05,749
not confessing his cruel parricide,

451
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:08,749
filling his hearers with strange invention.

452
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,666
But of that tomorrow.

453
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:20,333
Hie you to horse.

454
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:24,333
Adieu, till you return at night.

455
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:28,708
Goes Fleance with you?

456
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:42,666
Ay, my good Lord.
Our time does call upon's.

457
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:46,916
Farewell.

458
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:15,041
Within this hour, at most,

459
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,874
I will advise you
where to plant yourselves,

460
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:23,708
acquaint you with the perfect spy
o' the time the moment on't,

461
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,666
for it must be done tonight,
and something from the palace.

462
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:30,541
Always thought that I require a clearness.

463
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:36,083
And with him,

464
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:40,791
to leave no rubs nor botches in the work,

465
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,458
Fleance, his son that keeps him company,

466
00:58:45,584 --> 00:58:50,208
whose absence is no less material to me
than is his father's,

467
00:58:51,334 --> 00:58:54,416
must embrace the fate of that dark hour.

468
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:23,458
Fly!

469
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:33,249
Fly, Fleance! Fly!

470
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,624
Hail, Macbeth! Hail, Macbeth!

471
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,791
Hail, Macbeth!

472
01:00:42,584 --> 01:00:44,833
You know your own degrees.

473
01:00:44,959 --> 01:00:48,416
Sit down. At first and last,
the hearty welcome.

474
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:00,666
Our hostess keeps her state

475
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:05,833
but in best time
we will require her welcome.

476
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:10,541
Pronounce it for me, sir,
to all our friends,

477
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,666
for my heart speaks they are welcome.

478
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:14,958
Your Majesty.

479
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,416
Be large in mirth, anon,

480
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:21,208
we'll drink a measure the table round.

481
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:29,374
There's blood upon thy face.

482
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:33,208
'Tis Banquo's then.

483
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:35,749
Is he dispatched?

484
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,791
My Lord, his throat is cut.

485
01:01:37,917 --> 01:01:39,791
He's good that did the like for Fleance.

486
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:41,874
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.

487
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,749
Most royal sir, Fleance is scaped.

488
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,124
Then comes my fit again.

489
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,291
I had else been perfect,

490
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:04,041
whole as the marble, founded as the rock,

491
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:06,458
as broad and general as the casing air.

492
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:09,583
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined,

493
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:12,499
bound in to saucy doubts and fears.

494
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:15,124
My royal Lord, you do not give the cheer.

495
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,291
Thanks for that.

496
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:25,166
Sweet remembrancer!

497
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:29,666
Now, good digestion wait on appetite

498
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:31,999
and health on both.

499
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:36,083
Here had we now
our country's honour roofed,

500
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:39,249
were the graced person
of our Banquo present,

501
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:44,083
who may I rather challenge for unkindness

502
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:46,083
than pity for mischance.

503
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:49,999
His absence, sir,
lays blame upon his promise.

504
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:58,999
What is't that moves Your Highness?

505
01:03:06,084 --> 01:03:09,958
- Which of you have done this?
- What, my good Lord?

506
01:03:12,959 --> 01:03:15,249
Thou canst not say that I did it.

507
01:03:18,834 --> 01:03:20,624
His Highness is not well.

508
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,083
Sit, worthy friends.

509
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:27,624
Pray you, keep seat.

510
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,833
The fit is momentary.

511
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:31,083
Upon a thought he will again be well.

512
01:03:31,209 --> 01:03:33,458
If much you note him, you shall offend him

513
01:03:33,584 --> 01:03:36,124
and extend his passion.

514
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:40,083
Feed and regard him not.

515
01:03:42,334 --> 01:03:43,916
Are you a man?

516
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:50,624
Ay, and a bold one that dare look on that
which might appal the devil.

517
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,958
O proper stuff!

518
01:03:53,084 --> 01:03:55,833
Prithee, see there.

519
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,666
Behold.

520
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:01,416
Look, lo! How say you?

521
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:04,999
This is the very painting of your fear.

522
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:08,583
This is the air-drawn dagger
which you said led you to Duncan.

523
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:12,708
Why do you make such faces?

524
01:04:15,959 --> 01:04:18,416
If I stand here, I saw him.

525
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:24,166
My worthy Lord,
your noble friends do lack you.

526
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:27,708
Blood hath been shed ere now,
in the olden time.

527
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:30,083
The time has been that,
when the brains were out,

528
01:04:30,209 --> 01:04:32,249
the man would die

529
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:33,999
and there an end.

530
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:37,541
But now they rise again
and push us from our stools.

531
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,791
This is more strange
than such a murder is.

532
01:04:49,917 --> 01:04:51,958
I do forget.

533
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:56,416
Come.

534
01:04:57,875 --> 01:04:59,333
Love and health to all.

535
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:06,374
Our duties and the pledge.

536
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:17,249
Avaunt and quit my sight.

537
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:21,541
Let the earth hide thee.

538
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,749
Thy bones are marrowless,
thy blood is cold.

539
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:29,749
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes,
which thou dost glare with.

540
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:35,624
Think of this, good peers...

541
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,041
...but as a thing of custom.

542
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:41,999
'Tis no other.

543
01:05:43,084 --> 01:05:45,208
I pray you, sit still.

544
01:06:00,542 --> 01:06:02,249
You make me strange,

545
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,458
even to the disposition that I owe

546
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:13,499
when now I think
you can behold such sights

547
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:19,624
and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
when mine is blanched with fear.

548
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:24,458
- What sights, my Lord?
- I pray you, speak not.

549
01:06:24,584 --> 01:06:29,499
He grows worse and worse.
Question enrages him.

550
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:32,874
Stand not upon the order of your going
but go at once.

551
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,208
Good night,
and better health attend His Majesty.

552
01:06:36,334 --> 01:06:38,374
A kind good-night to all.

553
01:06:46,709 --> 01:06:48,291
It will have blood.

554
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:53,333
They say blood will have blood.

555
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:04,541
What is the night?

556
01:07:08,584 --> 01:07:11,666
Almost at odds with morning,
which is which.

557
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:19,291
How say'st thou
that Macduff denies his person

558
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:21,583
at our great bidding?

559
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:25,416
You lack the season of all natures.

560
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:28,874
Sleep.

561
01:07:32,542 --> 01:07:34,833
'I will to the Weird Sisters.

562
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:38,333
'More shall they speak.

563
01:07:38,459 --> 01:07:41,999
'For now I am bent to know
by the worst means the worst.

564
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:47,666
'For mine own good,
all causes shall give way.

565
01:07:52,584 --> 01:07:57,249
'I am in blood stepped in so far that,
should I wade no more,

566
01:07:58,209 --> 01:08:00,791
'returning were as tedious as go o'er.

567
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:05,874
'Strange things I have in head
that will to hand,

568
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:10,124
'which must be acted
ere they may be scanned.'

569
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:32,374
I conjure you, by that which you profess,
howe'er you come to know it,

570
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,458
answer me.

571
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:43,541
Speak, I charge you.

572
01:09:10,084 --> 01:09:12,624
Be lion-mettled, proud,

573
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:17,374
and take no care who chafes,
who frets, or where conspirers are.

574
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,124
Macbeth shall never vanquished be.

575
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:23,791
Until Great Birnam Wood
to high Dunsinane Hill

576
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:25,541
shall come against him.

577
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,208
Beware Macduff.

578
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,999
Beware the Thane of Fife.

579
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:08,791
Dismiss me, enough.

580
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,583
- Beware Macduff.
- Beware Macduff.

581
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:14,458
- Beware the Thane of Fife.
- Beware Macduff.

582
01:10:14,584 --> 01:10:16,124
Beware the Thane of Fife.

583
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,749
- Beware the Thane of Fife.
- Beware Macduff.

584
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:22,041
Beware the Thane of Fife.

585
01:10:25,334 --> 01:10:26,749
Be bloody,

586
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,041
bold, and resolute.

587
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:37,333
Laugh to scorn the power of man,

588
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:43,999
for none of woman born shall harm Macbeth.

589
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:05,416
Then live, Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?

590
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,124
But yet I'll make assurance double sure

591
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,083
and take a bond of fate:
thou shalt not live.

592
01:11:49,834 --> 01:11:51,416
Saw you the Weird Sisters?

593
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,499
No, my Lord.

594
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,499
Came they not by you?

595
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:59,583
No, indeed, my Lord.

596
01:12:01,959 --> 01:12:04,916
Infected be the air whereon they ride

597
01:12:05,042 --> 01:12:07,166
and damned all those that trust them!

598
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,374
'Who was't came by?'

599
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:30,249
'Tis two or three, my Lord,
that bring you word.

600
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,166
Macduff has fled to England.

601
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,749
- Fled to England?
- Ay, my good Lord.

602
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:47,666
The flighty purpose never is overtook
unless the deed go with it.

603
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:54,208
The very firstlings of my heart
shall be the firstlings of my hand.

604
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:55,666
Be it thought and done.

605
01:13:04,917 --> 01:13:06,541
Hell is murky.

606
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,041
What's done cannot be undone.

607
01:13:16,334 --> 01:13:18,624
Skirr the country round.

608
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,874
Hang those that talk of fear.

609
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:26,666
The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
seize upon Fife,

610
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:29,041
give to the edge of the sword
his wife, his babes,

611
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:32,166
and all unfortunate souls
that trace him in his line.

612
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:35,708
No boasting like a fool.

613
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:37,791
This deed I'll do
before this purpose cool.

614
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,166
Murder!

615
01:13:56,875 --> 01:13:58,374
Murder!

616
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,124
Murder!

617
01:14:03,709 --> 01:14:06,041
I have done no harm!

618
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:07,874
I have done no harm!

619
01:14:09,167 --> 01:14:11,083
Murder!

620
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:17,458
Murder!

621
01:14:17,584 --> 01:14:18,874
No!

622
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,499
No, please, my babies!

623
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,416
No!

624
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:28,249
Bring me no more reports.

625
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,291
Let them fly all.

626
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,958
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane

627
01:14:35,084 --> 01:14:37,249
I cannot taint with fear.

628
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,249
What's the boy Malcolm?

629
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:43,374
Was he not born of woman?

630
01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:47,999
The spirits that know
all mortal consequence

631
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:49,708
have pronounced me thus:

632
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,708
"Fear not, Macbeth.

633
01:14:52,834 --> 01:14:57,583
"No man that's born of woman
shall e'er have power upon thee."

634
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:05,166
Then fly, false thanes,

635
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:08,374
and mingle with the English epicures.

636
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:17,458
Why are you silent?

637
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,791
This tyrant,

638
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:26,124
whose sole name blisters our tongues,

639
01:15:27,584 --> 01:15:31,333
was once thought honest.

640
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:12,124
Now is the time of help.

641
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:16,999
Your eye in Scotland

642
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:19,583
would create soldiers,

643
01:17:19,709 --> 01:17:24,374
make our women fight
to doff their dire distresses.

644
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,999
Be it their comfort we are coming thither.

645
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:33,208
I have words

646
01:17:33,334 --> 01:17:36,333
that would be howled in the desert air

647
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:40,166
where hearing should not latch them.

648
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:46,416
My ever gentle cousin.

649
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,791
Stands Scotland where it did?

650
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:50,999
Alas, poor country,

651
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,166
it's almost afraid to know itself.

652
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:56,999
It cannot be called our mother
but our graves.

653
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:05,249
What's our newest grief?

654
01:18:08,459 --> 01:18:12,124
Let not your ears despise my tongue
which shall possess them

655
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,124
with the heaviest sound
that ever yet they heard.

656
01:18:20,417 --> 01:18:22,499
How does my wife?

657
01:18:25,459 --> 01:18:27,249
Your castle is surprised,

658
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:33,999
your wife and babes savagely slaughtered.

659
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:45,124
What man, hm?

660
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:49,374
What man?

661
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:55,999
My children too?

662
01:19:00,792 --> 01:19:05,166
Wife, children, servants,

663
01:19:05,292 --> 01:19:06,916
all that could be found.

664
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:21,374
He has no children!

665
01:19:27,292 --> 01:19:30,499
All my pretty chickens

666
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:32,416
and their dam,

667
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,458
in one fell swoop?

668
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,791
Dispute it like a man.

669
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:49,749
Oh...

670
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:54,791
Oh, I will do so.

671
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:00,333
But I will also feel it as a man.

672
01:20:05,209 --> 01:20:07,208
Sinful Macduff!

673
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:12,083
They were all struck for thee.

674
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:16,249
Be this the whetstone of your sword.

675
01:20:16,375 --> 01:20:19,166
Let grief convert to anger.

676
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:21,916
Blunt not the heart, enrage it.

677
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:27,791
Gracious England hath lent us
ten thousand men.

678
01:20:27,917 --> 01:20:29,958
Our power is ready.

679
01:20:30,084 --> 01:20:32,458
Our lack is nothing but our leave.

680
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:38,624
Front to front

681
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:42,666
you bring thou
this fiend of Scotland and myself,

682
01:20:42,792 --> 01:20:46,374
and within my sword's length you set him.

683
01:20:53,959 --> 01:20:56,416
If he scape,

684
01:20:56,542 --> 01:20:58,374
heaven forgive him too.

685
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:18,249
'Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.

686
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:21,416
'Some say he's mad.

687
01:21:23,459 --> 01:21:25,291
'Others, lesser, that hate him

688
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:27,666
'do call it valiant fury.'

689
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,666
But, for certain,

690
01:21:32,792 --> 01:21:36,666
he cannot buckle his distempered cause
within the belt of rule.

691
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,541
Those he commands

692
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:44,916
move only in command.

693
01:21:46,959 --> 01:21:48,749
'Nothing in love.

694
01:21:50,459 --> 01:21:51,791
'Now does he feel

695
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:56,041
'his secret murders
sticking on his hands.'

696
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:38,166
Yet here's a spot.

697
01:22:41,292 --> 01:22:43,499
Out, damned spot!

698
01:22:44,917 --> 01:22:46,583
Out, I say!

699
01:22:50,084 --> 01:22:51,916
Hell is murky.

700
01:22:56,042 --> 01:22:57,666
Fie, my Lord!

701
01:22:58,709 --> 01:22:59,958
Fie!

702
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,833
A soldier and afeard?

703
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:09,208
What need we fear who knows it

704
01:23:09,334 --> 01:23:12,124
when none can call our power to account?

705
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:18,583
Yet who would have thought

706
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:22,208
the old man to have had
so much blood in him?

707
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:32,208
The Thane of Fife had a wife.

708
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,833
Where is she now?

709
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,249
What?

710
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:48,166
Will these hands ne'er be clean?

711
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:54,541
No more o' that, my Lord.

712
01:23:55,834 --> 01:23:57,458
No more o' that.

713
01:23:58,875 --> 01:24:00,999
You mar all with this starting.

714
01:24:10,459 --> 01:24:12,833
Here's the smell of the blood still.

715
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:20,291
All the perfumes of Arabia
will not sweeten this little hand.

716
01:24:35,042 --> 01:24:36,624
Wash your hands.

717
01:24:37,584 --> 01:24:39,833
Put on your nightgown.

718
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:43,208
Look not so pale.

719
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:46,208
To bed.

720
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:49,083
To bed.

721
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:55,499
There's knocking at the gate.

722
01:25:00,334 --> 01:25:01,333
Come.

723
01:25:03,084 --> 01:25:05,166
Come.

724
01:25:05,292 --> 01:25:08,249
Come, come, give me your hand.

725
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:14,291
What's done cannot be undone.

726
01:25:14,875 --> 01:25:16,708
To bed.

727
01:25:18,334 --> 01:25:19,749
To bed.

728
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:27,333
To bed.

729
01:26:06,584 --> 01:26:07,791
To bed.

730
01:26:10,292 --> 01:26:11,624
To bed.

731
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:16,208
To bed.

732
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:45,624
The devil damn thee black,
thou cream-faced loon.

733
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:48,458
Where got'st thou that goose look?

734
01:26:48,584 --> 01:26:49,791
There's ten thousand.

735
01:26:50,917 --> 01:26:52,541
Geese, villain?

736
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:54,833
Soldiers, sir.

737
01:26:56,459 --> 01:26:58,999
Go, prick thy face and over-red thy fear,

738
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,791
thou lily-livered boy.

739
01:27:02,209 --> 01:27:04,583
What soldiers, patch?

740
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:08,416
The English force, so please you.

741
01:27:11,334 --> 01:27:14,541
Hang out our banners on the outward walls.

742
01:27:17,459 --> 01:27:19,791
The cry is still, "They come!"

743
01:27:23,584 --> 01:27:27,958
Our castle's strength
will laugh a siege to scorn.

744
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:33,666
Here let them lie

745
01:27:33,792 --> 01:27:36,666
till famine and the ague eat them up.

746
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,249
Doctor.

747
01:27:55,625 --> 01:27:57,791
The thanes fly from me.

748
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:04,333
What rhubarb, cyme or what purgative drug

749
01:28:04,459 --> 01:28:06,499
would scour these English hence?

750
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:07,999
Hear'st thou of them?

751
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:10,874
Ay, my good Lord.

752
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,333
Your royal preparation
makes us hear something.

753
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:17,583
If thou couldst, Doctor,

754
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:20,416
cast the water of my land,
find her disease

755
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:22,999
and purge it
to a sound and pristine health.

756
01:28:25,292 --> 01:28:28,291
I would applaud thee to the very echo
that should applaud again.

757
01:28:32,042 --> 01:28:36,041
The Queen, my Lord, is dead.

758
01:29:02,834 --> 01:29:05,666
She should have died hereafter.

759
01:29:07,917 --> 01:29:10,749
There would have been a time
for such a word.

760
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:21,499
Tomorrow,

761
01:29:27,084 --> 01:29:29,166
and tomorrow,

762
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:35,249
and tomorrow

763
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:41,958
creeps in this petty pace from day to day

764
01:29:44,584 --> 01:29:47,458
to the last syllable of recorded time.

765
01:29:51,292 --> 01:29:55,583
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dusty death.

766
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,333
Out.

767
01:30:05,792 --> 01:30:08,666
Out, brief candle.

768
01:30:10,917 --> 01:30:13,833
Life's but a walking shadow,

769
01:30:13,959 --> 01:30:15,791
a poor player

770
01:30:15,917 --> 01:30:20,041
that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage

771
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:21,958
and then is heard no more.

772
01:30:24,584 --> 01:30:27,416
It is a tale told by an idiot,

773
01:30:28,792 --> 01:30:30,708
full of sound and fury,

774
01:30:32,042 --> 01:30:33,874
signifying nothing.

775
01:30:38,959 --> 01:30:41,249
What is that noise?

776
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:44,124
It is the cry of women, my good Lord.

777
01:30:49,084 --> 01:30:51,833
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.

778
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,749
The time has been

779
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,791
my senses would have cooled
to hear a night-shriek

780
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:04,666
and my fell of hair

781
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:08,499
would, at a dismal treatise,
rouse and stir

782
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:10,374
as life were in't.

783
01:31:16,917 --> 01:31:20,666
I have supped full with horrors.

784
01:31:20,792 --> 01:31:23,166
Direness, familiar
to my slaughterous thoughts,

785
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:25,249
cannot once start me.

786
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:38,833
Thy story, quickly.

787
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:41,958
Gracious my Lord,

788
01:31:43,959 --> 01:31:46,499
I should report that which I say I saw,

789
01:31:50,042 --> 01:31:51,874
but know not how to do it.

790
01:32:01,334 --> 01:32:02,333
Seyton!

791
01:32:03,542 --> 01:32:05,874
I am sick at heart when I behold.

792
01:32:06,792 --> 01:32:08,791
Seyton, I say!

793
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:21,416
This push will chair me ever

794
01:32:22,875 --> 01:32:24,833
or dis-seat me now.

795
01:32:36,917 --> 01:32:38,791
I have lived long enough.

796
01:32:41,709 --> 01:32:44,083
My way of life is fallen into the sere,

797
01:32:48,125 --> 01:32:49,749
the yellow leaf.

798
01:32:51,917 --> 01:32:54,291
And that which should
accompany old age as...

799
01:32:56,667 --> 01:32:59,291
...honour,

800
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:00,833
love,

801
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,541
obedience,

802
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:05,291
troops of friends,

803
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:10,958
I must not look to have,

804
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,458
but, in their stead,

805
01:33:17,917 --> 01:33:19,416
curses,

806
01:33:23,209 --> 01:33:25,124
not loud,

807
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:29,041
but deep, mouth-honour, breath,

808
01:33:32,084 --> 01:33:35,916
which the poor heart would fain deny
and dare not.

809
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:41,749
Seyton.

810
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:45,333
All is confirmed, my Lord,
which was reported.

811
01:33:47,042 --> 01:33:50,624
I'll fight till from my bones
my flesh be hacked.

812
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:53,749
- Give me my armour.
- 'Tis not needed yet.

813
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:55,458
I'll put it on!

814
01:34:45,917 --> 01:34:48,958
And now a wood comes toward Dunsinane.

815
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,708
Ring the alarum bell.

816
01:34:58,667 --> 01:35:03,624
Arm, arm, and out!

817
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:13,499
Tyrant, show thy face!

818
01:35:21,292 --> 01:35:24,291
There is nor flying hence
nor tarrying here.

819
01:35:25,792 --> 01:35:27,749
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun

820
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:30,416
and wish the estate o' the world
were now undone.

821
01:35:31,209 --> 01:35:32,833
Blow, wind.

822
01:35:32,959 --> 01:35:35,708
Come, wrack.

823
01:35:36,709 --> 01:35:39,374
At least we'll die
with harness on our back.

824
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,833
'They have tied me to a stake.

825
01:35:45,959 --> 01:35:48,499
'I cannot fly.

826
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:51,624
'But, bear-like, I must fight the course.

827
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:56,583
'What's he that was not born of woman?

828
01:35:57,375 --> 01:36:00,333
'Such a one am I to fear, or none.

829
01:36:00,459 --> 01:36:04,666
'Why should I play the Roman fool
and die on mine own sword?'

830
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:09,208
Whiles I see lives,
the gashes do better upon them.

831
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:12,083
Turn, hellhound.

832
01:36:12,209 --> 01:36:13,499
Turn.

833
01:36:19,542 --> 01:36:22,749
Of all men else I have avoided thee.

834
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:24,458
But get thee back.

835
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:28,083
My soul is too much charged
with blood of thine already.

836
01:36:29,209 --> 01:36:30,916
I have no words.

837
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,624
My voice is in my sword.

838
01:36:55,792 --> 01:36:57,416
Thou losest labour.

839
01:36:57,542 --> 01:37:02,041
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
with thy keen sword impress

840
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:04,374
as make me bleed.

841
01:38:25,292 --> 01:38:28,958
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests.

842
01:38:29,792 --> 01:38:32,749
I bear a charmed life

843
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:36,124
which must not yield to one of woman born.

844
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:38,833
Despair thy charm

845
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,499
and let the angel
whom thou still hast served tell thee

846
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:49,874
Macduff was from his mother's womb
untimely ripped.

847
01:39:06,084 --> 01:39:08,499
Accursed be the tongue that tells me so,

848
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,166
for it hath cowed my better part of man.

849
01:39:26,084 --> 01:39:27,749
I'll not fight with thee.

850
01:40:14,334 --> 01:40:16,374
Then yield thee, coward,

851
01:40:18,209 --> 01:40:21,541
and live to be
the show and gaze of the time.

852
01:40:25,417 --> 01:40:29,833
I will have thee,
as our rarer monsters are,

853
01:40:34,625 --> 01:40:36,416
painted upon a pole,

854
01:40:38,875 --> 01:40:40,499
and underwrit:

855
01:40:42,417 --> 01:40:45,208
"Here may you see the tyrant,

856
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:49,041
"Macbeth."

857
01:41:06,042 --> 01:41:07,541
I will not yield

858
01:41:08,417 --> 01:41:11,874
to kiss the ground
before young Malcolm's feet

859
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,041
and to be baited with the rabble's curse.

860
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:25,499
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane

861
01:41:26,709 --> 01:41:28,874
and thou opposed,

862
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,249
being of no woman born,

863
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:39,124
yet I will try the last.

864
01:41:45,792 --> 01:41:49,541
Before my body I throw my warlike shield.

865
01:41:56,209 --> 01:41:57,916
Lay on, Macduff.

866
01:42:01,625 --> 01:42:06,333
And damned be him that first cries,

867
01:42:06,459 --> 01:42:11,124
"Hold, enough!"

868
01:43:44,542 --> 01:43:48,583
He's worth more sorrow,
and that I'll spend for him.

869
01:43:50,334 --> 01:43:52,041
He's worth no more.

870
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,999
Hail,

871
01:44:01,584 --> 01:44:04,333
King of Scotland!

872
01:44:06,917 --> 01:44:10,583
Hail, King of Scotland!

873
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:13,666
Hail, King of Scotland!
