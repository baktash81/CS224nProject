1
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,611
The Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa

2
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,030
is one of the driest places on Earth.

3
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,618
But every year, one river
flows down from the mountains

4
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,913
and transforms the heart of this desert.

5
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:44,378
A vast green oasis rises from the dust.

6
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:57,224
The Okavango Delta has been filling,
emptying, and refilling for millennia.

7
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:03,480
And every plant and animal
that has ever lived here

8
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:07,860
has danced to the rhythm
of this great seasonal cycle.

9
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,826
Like blood through arteries,
the water sustains all life here.

10
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,386
But one animal

11
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,472
is especially connected to the water.

12
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:51,653
These Kalahari elephants spend most
of the year searching for food and water.

13
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:56,408
So, for them, flood season in the Delta
is an especially joyous time.

14
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,585
This is a side of elephants we rarely see.

15
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,376
A 40-year-old female
watches over the herd.

16
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,431
Shani is the oldest and wisest,

17
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:55,263
after her sister, the great matriarch.

18
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,220
This puts her next in line
to be the leader.

19
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,348
It will be a big responsibility
when the time comes.

20
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:07,896
For now, though, she has her hands full
trying to raise her one-year-old son.

21
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,567
And this kid is a handful.

22
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:19,157
Meet Jomo,
one of the youngest of the herd.

23
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:26,206
At this impressionable age, with so many
different types of animals to play with,

24
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:31,086
it's not entirely certain he even knows
he's an elephant yet.

25
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:36,425
He can't leap through the air,
so he's probably not a lechwe.

26
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,683
But a baboon...
now, that looks more like it.

27
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,688
They're not buyin' it, though.

28
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:57,654
Let's just say Jomo has a lot to learn
about being part of the herd.

29
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,205
For elephants, family is everything.

30
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,627
In this tight-knit group,
someone always has your back.

31
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,548
And that's usually Gaia, Shani's sister.

32
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,051
She's the matriarch.

33
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,595
A position earned through age and wisdom.

34
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,516
Where she leads, the herd follows.

35
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,565
Almost everyone here is related to Gaia.

36
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,361
Sisters, cousins, daughters, grandkids.

37
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:43,283
The older boys,
they leave home in their early teens

38
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,078
to seek their fortunes elsewhere.

39
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,164
But they'll return occasionally
to visit Mom.

40
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:53,836
And to show the younger boys,
like Jomo, how to cause trouble.

41
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,097
Gaia knows the Delta is drying

42
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,767
and that soon she will have to lead
her family away from here

43
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,684
on a quest for food and water,

44
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:15,838
until the flood returns,
and so can they.

45
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,112
These are the last elephants on Earth

46
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:24,491
still able to make these epic migrations
over thousands of miles

47
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,159
as their ancestors did.

48
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:36,253
For many, the trip will be new
and exciting, but also perilous.

49
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,798
Much will depend on Gaia's experience

50
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:44,636
and the wisdom handed down
from generations of elephants.

51
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,057
Every year, the journey is challenging...

52
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:54,479
but this year,
it will change all of their lives.

53
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:20,047
Two months later, the water is receding,
and paradise is turning to dust.

54
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,019
Jomo leads the charge to water.

55
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,324
The Delta has become
a series of vanishing pools,

56
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,994
and these last drinking holes
are great places to meet up

57
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,829
with other families from the neighborhood.

58
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,131
Social life is like oxygen
for these elephants.

59
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,178
And they embrace it face-first.

60
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,561
Shani has already lost track of Jomo.

61
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,021
There he is!

62
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,648
He's, um...

63
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,442
What is he doing?

64
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:33,829
The older elephants all know this could be
the last easy water for many months,

65
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,331
so they're going to make the most of it.

66
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,878
It's time for a pool party!

67
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,235
When Jomo's over-stimulated,
he can get a little...

68
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,987
excitable.

69
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,242
There.

70
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,287
At least these guys are more his size.

71
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,399
Well, that's turned
most of the drinking water to mud.

72
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,237
Mud is useful to elephants, though.

73
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,201
It acts as sunscreen and they even eat it
to help with... stomach issues.

74
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,706
Oh, dear.

75
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,586
Ugh, who did that?

76
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,675
But the mud has a dark side.

77
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,761
It's becoming dangerously sticky.

78
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,183
Gaia's anxious and calls
time out on the mud pool.

79
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,237
Jomo barely makes it out.

80
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,663
But a young male calf
is stuck and suffocating.

81
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,374
The matriarch rushes to help.

82
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,878
He isn't Gaia's calf,

83
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,715
but she knows he will die
if she can't lift his face from the mud.

84
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,261
And she's the only one
with experience of this.

85
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,979
His head is up. That's the first step.

86
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,985
His mother is distraught,

87
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,778
but knows if anyone else goes in,

88
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,698
it will disturb the mud
and make things worse.

89
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,456
Even for Gaia, this is challenging.

90
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,668
She keeps the calf's head high

91
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,963
and removes mud from his mouth and trunk
so he can breathe.

92
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,092
Clearing the airways will buy time.

93
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,690
Gaia looks to Shani to help calm
the calf's mother.

94
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,324
The calf is exhausted,
and his legs are deeply stuck.

95
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,826
But Gaia has a plan.

96
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:04,456
If she can just dig a big enough
escape route through the mud,

97
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,876
the calf might be able to walk out
on its own.

98
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,604
Shani couldn't have a better mentor.

99
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:34,194
Gaia never gives up
and will never leave family behind.

100
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,009
This matriarch
is a force to be reckoned with.

101
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,929
And a powerful role model
for the entire herd.

102
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,856
Gaia has seen the Delta dry out like this

103
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:15,777
for every one of her 50 years
and recognizes the signs.

104
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,655
She knows it's time to leave.

105
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:25,370
The memories of all the journeys
she's ever taken are stored in her mind.

106
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:34,379
All the pathways and the food stops.

107
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,055
The landmarks and the dangers.

108
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:47,976
She'll need them all to navigate
these unpredictable lands.

109
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,567
Gaia leads the herd
into the baking Kalahari.

110
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,361
It seems madness!

111
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,073
But if she waits, the water holes
they will need on their journey

112
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,325
will dry up before they can reach them.

113
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,954
And they'll be unable to cross the desert.

114
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,126
The family joins the mass exodus
of animals leaving the Delta.

115
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,867
They're setting out
on a thousand-mile round trip.

116
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,745
One that could take up to eight months.

117
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:08,015
After four days of travel,
Gaia leads them to a shaded woodland,

118
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:11,059
where she remembers
there are seedpods to eat.

119
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,731
But there's an unexpected surprise.

120
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,151
Distant relatives.

121
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:24,031
Part of the clan Gaia's family
hasn't seen for over a year.

122
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,328
They're also making a pit stop
on their own journey.

123
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,421
It's a wonderful chance
to catch up with old friends,

124
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,924
and maybe make some new ones.

125
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:48,764
For Jomo, this could be the beginning
of a life-long friendship

126
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,309
and a valuable connection
to a whole new side of his family.

127
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:11,954
Emotional bonds between elephants are
as strong and as long-lasting as our own.

128
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:24,091
Shani reconnects with a cousin
she hasn't seen in ages.

129
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:31,974
They talk to each other with deep rumbling
sounds that work at close range...

130
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:36,144
And travel great distances
through the ground.

131
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,733
But nothing is more bonding than touch.

132
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,284
All right, they've said their hellos.

133
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,119
They came here for lunch.

134
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,665
The old tree-shaking technique produces...

135
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,294
one pod.

136
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,380
Well, that won't feed the herd.

137
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,801
Shani's a master tree shaker.

138
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,808
Hmm... No luck.

139
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:19,188
Looks like this food stop is a bust.

140
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,858
Wait a minute!

141
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,652
Who's this guy?

142
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,824
He's come to visit his mom
in the other family.

143
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:39,750
A magnificent bull,
and he's got a trick up his sleeve.

144
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:57,309
Oh, he's gonna win
a lot of friends with this party trick.

145
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,480
Everyone loves these pods.

146
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,370
Jomo's found a role model.

147
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,044
Someday.

148
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,556
These pods are just what
Gaia and the family need.

149
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:39,726
High energy food to keep them going
on the long road ahead.

150
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:52,573
Shani feels some new rumbling
vibrating the ground beneath her feet.

151
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,786
Low-frequency sounds.

152
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,122
Far lower than humans can hear.

153
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,793
They're messages from elephants
on the road ahead.

154
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,504
Time to move on.

155
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:17,431
In front of them is an astonishing network
of circles and lines

156
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,100
that stretch across the desert
to the horizon.

157
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:29,568
The mysterious lines
are ancient elephant paths.

158
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,948
The circles are water holes that collect
and hold rain for a few months,

159
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,491
until it evaporates.

160
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,249
Some holes contain
just enough drinking water

161
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,461
for the family to refill
and travel to the next one.

162
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,341
But others are too far apart.

163
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,555
And some will be empty.

164
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,396
The holes with water
are the stepping stones

165
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,484
the family will need on their
week-long journey to cross this desert.

166
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,489
And linking them together
is like solving a riddle

167
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,450
that requires many years of experience.

168
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:26,041
After a day marching
under the beating sun,

169
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,710
the family is desperately thirsty.

170
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:32,422
Shani and Jomo rush to the water hole,

171
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:36,301
hoping to drink some clean water
before it gets muddied up by everyone.

172
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,320
Empty.

173
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:05,205
Shani can still smell water,
but it's far underground.

174
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,711
Jomo will stay thirsty.

175
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,304
But there's another smell on the wind.

176
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:25,267
Unusual, yet vaguely familiar.

177
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,289
Shani is distracted from her thirst.

178
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:06,642
An elephant must have arrived here
about a year ago,

179
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:10,229
desperate for water, but finding none.

180
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,524
This is a reminder of the stakes.

181
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,528
The riddle of the water holes is no game.

182
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:29,748
The bones are blasted by sand
and bleached by sun.

183
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:34,795
But Shani still seems to recognize
the elephant they came from.

184
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,464
Perhaps it was a relative.

185
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:41,677
Or perhaps it was an elephant
she met only once.

186
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,681
And it's true that elephants never forget.

187
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,158
Jomo was only born
around the time this elephant died.

188
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:11,123
Shani passes him a bone
as if trying to teach him something.

189
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,299
Elephants seem to have
a deep connection to their past,

190
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,135
and a reverence
for those who've gone before them.

191
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,370
There's so much ground to cover.

192
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,791
Whether it takes one day or two
will depend on speed...

193
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,879
and Gaia taking the most direct route
to the next water hole.

194
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,927
There's no margin for error now.

195
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:15,521
So many new wonders for the young ones
to see on their first safari.

196
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:23,737
Jomo's been starved for playmates
on this long trek.

197
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,497
He would love to play
with this cute little cheetah cub.

198
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:37,334
But maybe not while Mom's around.

199
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,181
At last, an encouraging sign.

200
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:56,353
Carmine bee-eaters nest
near rich insect life

201
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,647
so they can feed their chicks.

202
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:05,028
It's a sign to Gaia that the herd
must be getting close to water.

203
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,631
Yesterday was a reminder of death.

204
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:27,342
But today, the air is alive.

205
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:31,471
And they can feel it in their giant bones.

206
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,943
There's definitely water here!

207
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,988
Make way, everybody!

208
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,077
There's a time for sharing,

209
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:58,999
but when elephants need to drink,
it's survival of the biggest.

210
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,441
Jomo's found some playmates.

211
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:26,860
Warthogs.

212
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:30,614
They look like fun!

213
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:35,244
First, he's gotta wait
till his mom's not looking.

214
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:39,873
And... there he goes.

215
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,130
Time for some hide-and-seek.

216
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,687
But warthogs don't seem to be into this.

217
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,400
Looks like he's switching to tag.

218
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,657
These pigs are way too fast for him.

219
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:32,384
Jomo would chase animals
all day if he could.

220
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:36,680
Except for that one.

221
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:49,026
The one animal that won't move
for an elephant is a buffalo.

222
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:55,115
Not moving.

223
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,995
Jomo's actually pretty brave...

224
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:04,791
when he's with his mom.

225
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:25,187
Shani skims the freshest water
off the top, which usually works.

226
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,816
But this water has been ruined

227
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,111
by animals wading
and doing who knows what else in it.

228
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,746
No drinkable water.

229
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:49,294
But at least this oasis comes with its own
small mopani woodland.

230
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,548
Elephants love mopani.

231
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,717
And its leaves contain
at least some water.

232
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:05,102
An elephant can eat 600 pounds
of leaves and branches in a day.

233
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,191
That's the equivalent of
two-and-a-half thousand cheeseburgers.

234
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:15,571
But they have a fierce competitor
for these leaves.

235
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:17,906
And it's in a whole other league.

236
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:35,465
Mopani worms can eat twice
their body weight of leaves in a day.

237
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:40,512
They're the caterpillar
of the Emperor hawk-moth

238
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:44,057
and can devastate
hundreds of miles of forest.

239
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,978
These critters can't be chased off.

240
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,356
They are rivals to be reckoned with.

241
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:00,657
A few worms must get eaten by mistake.

242
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,203
Yeah, elephants are herbivores,

243
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:07,539
but a little extra protein
never hurt anyone.

244
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,394
You get 'em, Jomo!

245
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,530
The biggest land animal on Earth

246
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:43,784
chased off by a very hungry caterpillar.

247
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,043
This decimated woodland
has nothing for them now.

248
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:55,087
But where next?

249
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,466
Deep in her memory, Gaia knows.

250
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:09,226
It's a place many of them
have never been before.

251
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:14,648
And getting there
will test their faith in Gaia.

252
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,657
The largest salt pan in Africa
stretches out in front of them.

253
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:29,663
It's vast, brutal,
and looks impossible to cross.

254
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:43,927
The ancient trails
lead to a fantastical place.

255
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:49,975
An island that rises from the salt
like a mirage.

256
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:57,733
But this island is very real

257
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,944
and offers a surprising lifeline
for travelers.

258
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,532
Baobab trees.

259
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:12,247
Their swollen trunks are full of water

260
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:15,042
that was stored months ago
during the rainy season.

261
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,843
Gaia hopes the sap
will keep her family alive

262
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:27,846
for the second stage
of the salt pan crossing.

263
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:32,643
It's the only water for 200 miles.

264
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,438
Gaia found the island,

265
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:42,110
but it's Shani who teaches the younger
elephant what to do with the baobabs.

266
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:45,155
She rips open the thick bark,

267
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:49,451
so Jomo and the little ones
can reach the moisture stored beneath.

268
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,851
The shape of these trees on the horizon

269
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:19,231
must have been a sign of salvation
for generations of weary elephants.

270
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:35,622
And beneath their boughs... bed.

271
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:55,809
Only when the skies glitter
and the heat of the day fades

272
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:58,645
do the island's
strangest creatures emerge.

273
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:34,890
This is a magical place
where elephants can dream.

274
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,852
Younger minds might be
buzzing from the excitement

275
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,396
of making this journey for the first time.

276
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,235
Perhaps Shani and the elders
dream of the time

277
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:48,946
they were shown this island
by their ancestors.

278
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:53,865
Part of an unbroken
chain of knowledge,

279
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:57,922
stretching back for millennia.

280
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,727
Mornings in the desert are cold.

281
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,398
So, Jomo and Shani
are in no hurry to get up.

282
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,570
Gaia needs to get her family moving,

283
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:33,574
even if her old bones
are creaking a little these days.

284
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:41,039
But no matter what your age, getting up
isn't easy when you're this shape.

285
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:49,673
A helping trunk can make
all the difference.

286
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,815
Not helping, Jomo.

287
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:21,580
The calves need
the water in their mother's milk

288
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,916
or they'll never
make it across the salt pan.

289
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:29,046
The baobab sap won't be enough
to keep the adults going.

290
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:33,842
They need to cross now
before it gets too hot.

291
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:39,056
But the desert has other ideas.

292
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:01,787
The winds have crossed hundreds of miles
of scorched salt and are bone dry.

293
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,132
There is no shelter
from the desiccating salt crystals

294
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:16,969
and the calves are in serious risk
of dehydration.

295
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,479
Pushing on is the only option.

296
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:51,837
Jomo is struggling,
but Shani reassures him.

297
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,381
She would never leave him behind.

298
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:09,271
The salt and the wind
have sucked the water from their bodies.

299
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:13,066
They must drink soon or they will die.

300
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:25,412
Gaia is uncertain of the route,

301
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:27,831
but she can sense something
through her feet.

302
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,167
It could be distant water.

303
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:47,809
Shani senses it too and leads the way.

304
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,736
So close.

305
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,325
Shani's instincts
about the water were right.

306
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:48,745
But the deep gorge was a surprise.

307
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,052
How are they going to reach water now?

308
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,317
Quelea.

309
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:26,491
Gaia remembers these birds leading
her mother to water many years ago.

310
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,747
Perhaps they could do it again.

311
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:41,215
They follow the birds through a passage
high above the main river.

312
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:00,400
There's a small stream.

313
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:04,780
It's enough to wet their mouths
and keep the parched young ones going.

314
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:26,385
Shani has learned
an important lesson from Gaia today,

315
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:29,930
these little birds can be big lifesavers.

316
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:37,729
But the quelea aren't settling to drink.

317
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:42,276
Gaia gambles on following them.

318
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:03,881
The small stream was a feeder
for the Zambezi River

319
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:06,675
at its most magnificent point.

320
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:15,058
Mosi-oa-Tunya, "The Smoke that Thunders. "

321
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:19,146
Also known as Victoria Falls.

322
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:07,945
Upstream of the falls
is the haven Gaia's been searching for.

323
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:12,824
Islands with shelter, food,
and limitless fresh water.

324
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:17,996
The islands are filled with palm trees,

325
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,959
a sign that elephants have reached them
many times before,

326
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:26,839
as palm seeds germinate best
after passing through an elephant.

327
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:33,053
Gaia has found the crossing point
to the islands.

328
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:41,520
Suddenly, those giant bodies
seem a bit lighter.

329
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:58,370
Jomo has rediscovered
the spring in his step.

330
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:12,301
They'll cross to the island soon enough,
but before that,

331
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:17,014
their first real drink
in nearly two months.

332
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:27,441
Deliciously cool water
from the mighty Zambezi,

333
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:29,943
one of Africa's greatest rivers.

334
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:33,447
Ah! Antelope!

335
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:38,243
Just like old times for Jomo.

336
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:44,666
They remind Jomo of those carefree days
back in the Delta,

337
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,587
just chasing animals around
all over the place.

338
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,964
Not a care in the world...

339
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,966
Oh, that's a crocodile!

340
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:58,305
Probably best to stick with the herd.

341
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:07,814
Upstream, hungry crocodiles
have noticed their arrival.

342
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,199
Downstream is the greatest waterfall
on Earth.

343
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:25,874
But in front of them
is everything they've been looking for.

344
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:30,587
Gaia decides
they should attempt the crossing.

345
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:54,987
The water near the edge is shallow,

346
00:44:55,779 --> 00:45:00,033
but shallow water
is where crocodiles hunt best.

347
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:03,954
Shani is hesitating.

348
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:06,707
She wants to turn back...

349
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:12,546
but Gaia urges her on.

350
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:22,139
Together, Shani and Gaia
shield the young on both sides,

351
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,225
making it harder
for the crocodiles to reach them.

352
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:44,244
As they leave the crocodiles behind,
they face a new, even worse danger.

353
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:49,833
The water is getting deeper
and the current much stronger.

354
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:55,172
They could easily be swept downstream
and over the waterfall.

355
00:45:56,673 --> 00:46:00,427
A fate suffered by all too many elephants.

356
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:10,812
Here, the Zambezi is 50 feet deep
and the current is ferocious.

357
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:16,568
Do they have the strength and stamina
to withstand the force of the river?

358
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:45,889
They're nearly there!

359
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:43,780
Food, water, and safety all in one place.

360
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:47,284
They can rest here for the next few months

361
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:52,206
until the food is all eaten
and the water returns to the Okavango.

362
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:59,630
And those palm nuts,
they're perfectly ripe.

363
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:02,925
Current residents beware.

364
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,638
It's time for an elephant feast!

365
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:07,698
The nuts are full of oil,
have all the goodness they need,

366
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:11,535
and were seeded here
by previous generations of elephants.

367
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:14,371
No wonder they're called ivory palms.

368
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:35,726
Gaia's island will do nicely
until the water returns to the Okavango.

369
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:38,437
Like the elephants,

370
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,233
the water will undergo an epic journey
across Africa to reach the Delta.

371
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:47,779
A journey that's just beginning.

372
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:59,922
A thousand miles away in
the highlands of Angola,

373
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:02,355
the weather is changing.

374
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:11,637
Water vapor from the Atlantic Ocean
hits the mountains and turns to rain.

375
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:32,017
The run-off from the southern slopes
drains into the Okavango,

376
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:37,663
where thousands of Kalahari elephants
will depend on it for their survival.

377
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:48,048
Nothing on our planet
is more precious to life.

378
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:07,150
This water is just beginning its 600-mile
journey to the Okavango Delta,

379
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:12,781
where it'll once again
transform dust into paradise.

380
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,955
Gaia and family will soon begin
their journey back to the Okavango,

381
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:23,917
so they can arrive in the Delta
when it's at its most verdant.

382
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:27,504
OKAVANGO DELTA

383
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:33,385
On the palm islands above the falls,
the season is also advancing.

384
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,183
The nuts are all finished
and the remaining plants are dried out

385
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,476
and make poor elephant food.

386
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,855
The family is scraping a living now.

387
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:53,530
The change is especially
hard on the oldest.

388
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,981
Gaia is getting tired,

389
00:51:56,151 --> 00:52:00,284
her sixth and final set of
teeth are nearly worn away,

390
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:05,417
and she finds the food here harder to eat,
so is losing strength.

391
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:12,040
Jomo has never seen an old elephant
beginning to fade,

392
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:14,224
and seems confused.

393
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:20,849
Gaia has seen their food wane
with the seasons many times before.

394
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:24,770
She also foresaw
the other great change coming.

395
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:32,027
When they arrived,
the Zambezi was a raging torrent.

396
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:35,864
Now, the mighty river
has fallen to a trickle.

397
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:40,911
The dry season has devastated
the whole area.

398
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,125
Gaia knew this place
wouldn't support them for long.

399
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:51,672
Elephants can't survive on small islands.

400
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:56,260
They need to roam
vast distances to thrive.

401
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:08,188
Gaia makes the call to leave
and Shani helps rally the herd.

402
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:15,195
At least, leaving this place
will be far easier than arriving.

403
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:21,118
Where they once had to swim,
they can now walk.

404
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:30,586
On the mainland, Gaia can lead her family
on the long road back to the Delta.

405
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:35,257
They'll travel through shaded woodlands
where possible,

406
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,467
conserving their strength for the desert.

407
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:45,250
Off the island, she can once again tune in
to the sounds of distant elephants.

408
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:50,022
They're telling her
the Angolan floodwaters are early.

409
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:52,608
To get the best of the flood,

410
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:56,987
she'll need to leave immediately
and take the shortest possible route.

411
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:03,535
There will be different dangers...

412
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:07,623
different pathways...

413
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:11,251
but the same goal, paradise.

414
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:22,179
The most direct route will get the family
back for the peak of the flood.

415
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:28,727
But it's a calculated risk.

416
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:36,318
There's a reason they don't usually
take the shortest route.

417
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,200
It's through lion country.

418
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,372
And these lions hunt elephants.

419
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:56,630
There are signs of ambush everywhere.

420
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:05,931
The cats won't usually attack elephants
until the end of the dry season,

421
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:08,225
when they've been weakened by hunger.

422
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:11,854
That's still a month away.

423
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:16,441
As long as they stick together,
they should be safe.

424
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:27,619
The herd does need to drink,
and they do trust Gaia,

425
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:30,956
but this is unsettling.

426
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:51,435
Winds from a brewing storm
give the cats cover.

427
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:56,690
It's much harder for the herd to hear
or smell them in these conditions.

428
00:55:56,773 --> 00:56:00,569
The lions know it too and seem emboldened.

429
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:10,412
The cats are drawing around the family.

430
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:36,021
Gaia must show the lions
her family is strong.

431
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:40,150
The predators shouldn't waste their time.

432
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:48,659
The lions seem convinced
this would be no easy meal.

433
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:55,582
At least not during daylight
when elephants have the upper hand.

434
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:07,761
The elephants feel their way.

435
00:57:08,554 --> 00:57:11,557
They can't see well in the dark
and predators know it.

436
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,351
The family should push on
through the night

437
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,144
and leave this place while they can.

438
00:57:23,277 --> 00:57:26,530
The haunting calls of hyenas
put them on edge.

439
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,119
The family cannot take any chances.

440
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:34,580
Hyenas are known as scavengers,

441
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:38,125
but would snatch a small calf
given the opportunity.

442
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:03,066
Gaia and Shani keep the hyenas away
from Jomo and the other young.

443
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:13,243
Gaia is worried she's made a grave error.

444
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:18,624
The hyenas are eating
a carcass of a large elephant

445
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:21,502
too big for them
to have killed themselves.

446
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:24,505
It can only mean one thing.

447
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:30,761
It was killed by lions
and the hunting season has begun.

448
00:58:40,312 --> 00:58:42,689
Shani can sense Gaia's distress.

449
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:46,985
If the matriarch is worried,
panic spreads.

450
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:04,378
The lions are closing in.

451
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:24,648
The hunter has Jomo in her sights.

452
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,242
Shani spots the lion and gives chase,
leaving her son alone.

453
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:54,761
Shani and Jomo could easily
become surrounded.

454
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,067
They must get out of there.

455
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:19,453
In their pursuit, the lions have separated
Jomo from his mother.

456
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:38,472
Jomo must stay hidden.

457
01:00:45,938 --> 01:00:48,524
Shani has doubled back to protect Jomo.

458
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:55,072
She will never abandon her son.

459
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:02,496
Safe for now.

460
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:24,142
Gaia had expected the family
to be many miles from here by morning.

461
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:27,354
But last night was chaos.

462
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:32,776
Shani emerges from the covered woodland,

463
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:35,487
trying to reconnect
with the rest of the herd.

464
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,627
They are tightly gathered
around a body...

465
01:01:57,301 --> 01:01:58,302
Gaia.

466
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:07,311
The herd was so focused
on keeping their young safe

467
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:09,688
that they lost sight of their oldest.

468
01:02:11,648 --> 01:02:14,985
Her failing teeth had
left her weakened by hunger

469
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:18,655
and the stress of the night
was too much for her.

470
01:02:32,503 --> 01:02:35,839
She is still alive... just.

471
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:41,136
But these are her last moments,
and the family knows it.

472
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:49,603
For the last 20 years,
she has been their rock,

473
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:54,149
giving companionship and leadership.

474
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:13,377
With her trunk on her sister's mouth,

475
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,839
Shani feels her take her last breath.

476
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:42,447
They can't help her now.

477
01:03:58,422 --> 01:04:00,757
Jomo takes a final look at Gaia.

478
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:07,764
The death of a matriarch
is a momentous event in his young life.

479
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:24,740
The life-giving floodwaters are picking up
pace as they travel towards the Delta.

480
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:29,369
Shani is trying to lead
her family there, too.

481
01:04:30,495 --> 01:04:36,443
With Gaia gone, she is now
the one responsible for their safety.

482
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:42,132
This is uncharted territory for her...
in every sense.

483
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:50,849
The younger females look
to each other for reassurance.

484
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:56,230
They've never known a time
without Gaia as their leader.

485
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:06,323
They know Shani is the obvious successor.

486
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:09,493
But does she have what it takes?

487
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:20,838
Only time will tell if they found
their new matriarch.

488
01:05:37,729 --> 01:05:41,567
A week later, their journey
is interrupted by a wonderful event.

489
01:05:45,654 --> 01:05:48,407
A new calf is welcomed into the world,

490
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,910
after a pregnancy of nearly two years

491
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:55,539
and there is huge excitement
in the family.

492
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:07,217
The first few days of life
are all-important,

493
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,469
and everyone wants to help.

494
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,772
He'll be unsteady on his feet for a while.

495
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:25,194
Another new responsibility for Shani.

496
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:29,573
Elephants are usually born
in the wet season

497
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:33,160
when mothers can produce
more milk and it's cooler,

498
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:38,123
so this little calf
is going to need extra help.

499
01:06:47,007 --> 01:06:50,177
Shani welcomes a new playmate for Jomo.

500
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:53,639
Jomo is less excited.

501
01:06:55,432 --> 01:06:58,810
He has been the baby of the family
for as long as he can remember.

502
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:03,982
Then again, the kid looks like
he could use some help.

503
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:17,454
Yup, he is definitely gonna
slow them down.

504
01:07:48,694 --> 01:07:52,698
Shani clears a path for the calf
while it finds its feet.

505
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:57,619
The little one's mom is inexperienced,

506
01:07:57,703 --> 01:08:01,498
so its chances of survival
are slim without Shani's help.

507
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:10,507
It's now Shani, not Gaia,
to whom the family must look for guidance.

508
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:13,385
The decisions she makes from here on

509
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:16,889
will have huge consequences
for the entire herd.

510
01:08:18,223 --> 01:08:20,642
She looks back at all the lessons

511
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:23,645
she learned from Gaia
during her rich life.

512
01:08:36,241 --> 01:08:40,495
Shani must piece together
her own way back to the Delta.

513
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:47,461
First thing, she must get the new mother

514
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:51,632
to the place Gaia took her
after she gave birth,

515
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:54,676
a place where salts seep from the ground.

516
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:59,389
Elephants come here to drink
and replace minerals

517
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:01,975
before they tackle the desert.

518
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:07,481
Shani lets the new mom go first

519
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:10,817
so she can replenish
the fluids lost during the birth.

520
01:09:12,194 --> 01:09:16,073
For the mom, this is a lifesaver.

521
01:09:18,784 --> 01:09:22,538
But the whole herd need these minerals
before they can move on.

522
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,213
Oh, look who's cut in front of the line...

523
01:09:32,089 --> 01:09:33,465
Jomo!

524
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:37,886
He's gonna have to learn
how to play by the rules.

525
01:09:43,642 --> 01:09:47,604
Tusks come in very handy
when trying to dig deep for the salts.

526
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:08,542
Jomo doesn't have tusks,
so it's a little difficult.

527
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:12,921
And his young apprentice isn't helping.

528
01:10:25,184 --> 01:10:29,146
Another herd is approaching,
wanting to access the mine.

529
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:38,947
Shani is in alien territory now,
disconnected from her social network.

530
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:41,617
She sizes them up.

531
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:45,871
It's a huge group,
easily big enough to drive them away.

532
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:50,697
Shani must decide whether to stand firm,

533
01:10:50,755 --> 01:10:54,237
and protect their patch... or back down.

534
01:10:56,173 --> 01:11:00,260
Sometimes rival herds will kidnap calves
to assert their dominance...

535
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:06,225
and Shani's family has a vulnerable
newborn to look after.

536
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,648
The calf is eyed by the rival matriarch.

537
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:20,197
Shani steps up for the test.

538
01:11:21,073 --> 01:11:23,450
She will not be intimidated.

539
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:30,332
She will protect the calf
as though it were her own.

540
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:49,935
The rivals back down.
They had strength in number,

541
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:54,064
but lacked Shani's determination
to protect her family.

542
01:11:56,859 --> 01:11:58,819
The little calf is safe for now.

543
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,240
Shani decides it's time to push for home.

544
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:10,622
It won't be easy,
but a rich prize is waiting.

545
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:17,379
The Angolan floodwaters
are just arriving in the Okavango.

546
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:45,199
Desert sands that have been
parched and barren

547
01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:48,076
for half a year are not
as lifeless as they seem.

548
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:58,253
Some creatures have been
waiting underground for this moment.

549
01:12:59,796 --> 01:13:01,965
And others have been waiting for them.

550
01:13:14,019 --> 01:13:17,898
The leading edge of the flood
is full of tiny fish

551
01:13:17,981 --> 01:13:21,693
moving in to hunt the insects and spiders
caught by the new water.

552
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:27,824
Catfish are just behind them,
pushing into the Delta's many channels

553
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:31,828
alongside thousands
of other floodwater pioneers.

554
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:59,523
Paradise from dust.

555
01:14:00,524 --> 01:14:03,986
Once again, the Delta is transforming.

556
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:11,577
Out in the desert,
Shani and the family are not far away now,

557
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:18,625
but they're battling dry headwinds
and haven't had water for two days.

558
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:23,672
It's taking a toll on the whole herd.

559
01:14:26,717 --> 01:14:30,304
Jomo is more resilient than he was
when he began this journey.

560
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:34,016
But the young calf is in trouble.

561
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:48,655
The herd is tighter now than ever.

562
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:51,200
He won't be left behind.

563
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:01,585
Strength of family
has gotten them this far.

564
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:07,508
They will make it to the Delta together,
or not at all.

565
01:15:14,097 --> 01:15:17,184
Take as long as you need, little one.

566
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:23,792
The white sand of the Delta
is now under his feet.

567
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:27,421
They are so close!

568
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:54,573
From all over the Kalahari,
animals pour back into the Okavango.

569
01:16:56,491 --> 01:17:00,130
The journey's wildlife and water converge,

570
01:17:00,141 --> 01:17:03,710
and the Delta's heart is beating again.

571
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:29,816
Only one set of travelers are missing.

572
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:38,408
Shani's done it! They're home.

573
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,124
She's got them all back...

574
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,627
even the little one.

575
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:57,386
This epic journey was started by Gaia,

576
01:17:57,469 --> 01:18:01,932
but it's Shani who will now carry forward
the wisdom of the generations.

577
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:15,612
The calf born on their journey tastes
the Delta's waters for the first time.

578
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:26,206
He'll have Jomo to introduce him
to the locals... in his own special way.

579
01:18:30,502 --> 01:18:34,631
But after all his trials
and experiences this year,

580
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:38,760
Jomo will surely prove
to be an excellent big brother

581
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:44,433
and pass on everything he's learned
about being one of the herd.

582
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:57,988
Following the dust and dangers
of their incredible road trip,

583
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:01,366
this must be pure heaven.

584
01:19:12,503 --> 01:19:14,421
After an uncertain start,

585
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:18,509
the family now fully accepts
Shani as their new matriarch.

586
01:19:22,179 --> 01:19:23,972
She won't be the same as Gaia...

587
01:19:24,473 --> 01:19:27,100
elephants are individuals.

588
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:32,564
Shani will bring
her own style of leadership.

589
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:35,484
And she's started well.

590
01:19:41,657 --> 01:19:45,160
In a few months,
these lush wetlands will be gone.

591
01:19:46,411 --> 01:19:49,498
And the family will have
to leave the Delta

592
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:53,210
and head out again
across the vast wilds of Africa,

593
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:58,173
like countless generations
of Kalahari elephants before them.

594
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:06,223
These are the last elephants on Earth
who still have the freedom to roam.

595
01:20:12,563 --> 01:20:18,485
May these unforgettable journeys continue
for generations to come.

596
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:45,637
And there's the baby. Look at that.

597
01:21:16,793 --> 01:21:18,879
There's nothing like the sound of lions

598
01:21:18,962 --> 01:21:21,381
40 feet from the car
when you've got no doors on it,

599
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:23,342
to make a little bit of wee come out.

600
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:30,265
Females, salty, three hours old.

601
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:33,018
No, don't taste it.

602
01:21:33,143 --> 01:21:36,021
I can't bring myself
to do that to you.

603
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:40,150
I did this. I touched it with this finger
and licked the other finger.

604
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:43,737
Right over the camera.

605
01:21:49,576 --> 01:21:51,995
They tend to be more nervous
in a herd like this,

606
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:53,747
because obviously the lions are around

607
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:55,791
and lions will have a go
for the youngsters.

608
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:57,084
- Lions?
- Yeah.

609
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:59,962
- You didn't say anything about lions.
- Of course there are lions.
