1
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:34,853
- Run for it!
- Come on, Lisa! Go, go, go!

2
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:37,052
Go for second!

3
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:45,069
It's gonna be close.

4
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:48,302
Yeah, Lisa!

5
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,032
United States wins gold!

6
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:54,275
You did it!

7
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:58,049
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

8
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:00,082
Yeah, Lisa!

9
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,516
So basically we're down to
three choices for the last slot.

10
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,749
Lisa's here to see you.
I'm glad you're meeting with her...

11
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:10,622
...because when it comes to this girl,
the intangibles are everything.

12
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:12,923
She's been the heartbeat
of this program.

13
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:14,793
Just let me think for a second.

14
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:18,095
She did the Olympics and
two championships without an error.

15
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,602
- She practices, what?
- Three hours every day.

16
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:23,240
She makes everyone better. Coach?

17
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,344
I have the benefit of being new here.

18
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,737
Lisa is 31.

19
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:31,644
She's 0.3 seconds slower
moving towards first.

20
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:36,413
I'm tired of justifying myself because
you're hung up on her as a role model.

21
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:39,614
Nobody's gonna change his mind.
It's over.

22
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,055
- What's that?
- It's your call.

23
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,190
Hooray! Thank you. Thank you.

24
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:47,594
At least let her know today.
She'll have to redirect her life.

25
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:50,929
Everyone finds out when
I post it online. No exceptions.

26
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,900
Because we field women athletes...

27
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:56,006
...doesn't mean we get girly
when someone's time is up.

28
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,199
Holy crap.

29
00:02:58,076 --> 00:02:59,236
I beg your pardon?

30
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,074
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:04,514
Oh, my Lord.
What is to become of me?

32
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:07,948
I've lost my ability
to smile at bastards.

33
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:13,518
Still got it.

34
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,084
Can we?

35
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:20,721
- I can't see her. Tell her I'm too busy.
- How's it going?

36
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:23,896
Three, three, three!

37
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,475
Let's go, people!

38
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:33,770
- Faster!
- Good stretch, Smalls!

39
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,380
- Go, baby! Attaway!
- Right here!

40
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,107
Faster!

41
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:43,753
- Hey, whose phone?
- AI right, look up.

42
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,081
Oh, man.

43
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:48,351
- Smalls, are you okay?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,718
This better be worth it.

45
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,364
- You gotta watch out.
- Yeah.

46
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:55,864
- Hello?
- Hi.

47
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:58,025
This is George Madison.

48
00:03:58,203 --> 00:04:02,435
I think you might know that Riva
gave me your phone number.

49
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,406
No.

50
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:08,341
She thought it might be a good idea
if we had dinner.

51
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:10,674
I'll call her.
When did you have in mind?

52
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:13,543
No, I wasn't calling to set a time.

53
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,210
She didn't know that
I was seeing someone.

54
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,888
Well, she didn't know
that it had escalated a bit.

55
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,151
At least on my part.

56
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,992
It just added up for me suddenly.

57
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,465
So you're calling me to break up?

58
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,360
- You can't just walk in there.
- No, I just didn't think...

59
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:32,761
George Madison.

60
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:35,805
I'm sorry. I got distracted.
What was I saying?

61
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:38,632
You were saying
you just didn't think.

62
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:41,577
Right, right. Thank you.

63
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,974
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

64
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,410
Thank you for holding.

65
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,882
I just didn't think it was right
not to phone you...

66
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:54,387
...once I took your number, in case you
had talked and were expecting my call.

67
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:58,825
Okay. Well, it was nice of you to call,
in a way, I guess.

68
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:00,497
Right.

69
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,701
Sorry for interrupting your day.

70
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,166
- Yeah.
- Goodbye.

71
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:06,395
Bye.

72
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:09,506
Weirdo. I'm gonna kill Riva. Let's go.

73
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,802
All right, ladies, let's go!

74
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:23,244
Oh, my God.

75
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:27,782
- So you gave my number to a guy?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,451
I hardly know him, but he went
to business school with my brother.

77
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,393
So why did you give him
my number?

78
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:35,762
You don't remember
Wednesday night?

79
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:39,898
You said you had never dated
a non-athlete.

80
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,734
"I should date a non-athlete,
right, Riva?"

81
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,136
That's what you said.

82
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,777
Don't listen to me when
I'm drinking Guinness.

83
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:49,375
It's the only time you really say stuff.

84
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:51,675
I hope that's not true.

85
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:56,480
This exercise is for next time, okay?
Thank you.

86
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,592
George.

87
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:04,520
Didn't I say I was crashing
on my book?

88
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:07,062
Yeah, you did. I'm not gonna stay.

89
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,166
Maybe that's better for tonight.

90
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:15,796
Look, if you're concerned about us
now that we've intensified...

91
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:17,965
...we're okay. I am busy...

92
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:22,178
...so I can't demonstrate to you
we're okay in the little ways...

93
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:24,975
...like paying attention to you...

94
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,087
...but if you could take my word for it
until work lets up, that would help me.

95
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:31,313
And us.

96
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,356
I think I like that word better.

97
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,087
Us.

98
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:40,660
T... Today I...

99
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:47,265
It was nice just to see your face
for a minute. It settles me down.

100
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:50,764
Great game last night, Matty.
Who's your date?

101
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:52,204
You're the best pitcher.

102
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:54,345
- Can I get your autograph?
- Got a pen?

103
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:57,539
- He's the cutest pitcher in baseball.
- Rocking that mound!

104
00:06:57,716 --> 00:07:00,310
Hold on, hold on.
You guys ready? Okay.

105
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:02,885
- Here, one more over here.
- Lisa!

106
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:07,047
- To the right!
- The right.

107
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,162
- Thanks for everything.
- You're awesome!

108
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,565
The night is so great.
You look so good.

109
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:22,832
Just needed to grab you.
We're here.

110
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:25,067
- Good evening, Mr. Reynolds.
- Tom.

111
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:28,178
Matty, I might have to
go back on what I said...

112
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:30,576
...about finally seeing
your place tonight.

113
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:32,580
I just have a lot on my mind.

114
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:34,176
Okay, are you sure?

115
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,248
Well...

116
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:37,746
...no.

117
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:40,357
There's no pressure.
It should feel right.

118
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:41,583
That's nice.

119
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:43,825
Thanks.

120
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,422
Why are you moving away?

121
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,229
I wanna give you room
to think and decide.

122
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:08,409
You have all the signs of a handful.

123
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,452
I hope so.

124
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,354
You better hang on to that energy.

125
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,801
Wait till you try this.
Blender wake you?

126
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:35,845
It's worth it. Because these things
are gonna blow your mind.

127
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:44,378
Amazing sex.

128
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,484
Female jocks are amazing.

129
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:51,790
Thanks, but maybe could you
personalize it a little?

130
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:55,931
Oh, yeah. Right, right, right.
That's what I'm saying to you, Lisa.

131
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:59,260
It's like, come on, that was...
That was unbelievable.

132
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:01,903
Yeah.

133
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:04,132
Are you fishing
for a compliment or...?

134
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:07,904
I'm fishing for a celebration!
Come on!

135
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,047
It was good.

136
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,984
Here, come on.

137
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:24,857
- It's good.
- It's great.

138
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,829
- It's great.
- There you go.

139
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:28,966
- Yeah.
- Good.

140
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,665
I have to get going.
Which way is the bathroom?

141
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:36,238
- It's just right over there.
- Okay.

142
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:38,939
But I'm gonna drink the rest of this...

143
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,045
...because it was really sweet of you
to make it.

144
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,972
It's great.

145
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:46,851
So you know that many
female athletes?

146
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,042
Yeah, I do.

147
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:51,711
I mean, you gotta count cheerleaders,
but yeah.

148
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:59,524
Toothbrushes are in that drawer
on the right there.

149
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,563
Oh, okay.

150
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:10,933
No.

151
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,710
No. You don't have to
wear that dress home.

152
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,810
- What?
- Come here.

153
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:19,978
What size? Small or extra small?

154
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:22,419
Wait, what is that?

155
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:28,384
- What?
- That. Behind you.

156
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:32,490
That is repulsive. The stack.

157
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:33,926
- No.
- No?

158
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,591
No, no. No, it's me being classy.
It's me being a good host.

159
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,999
No. No. No.

160
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:44,201
I feel like I'm on an assembly line
that's just spitting out girls.

161
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:47,072
That's just negative. That's like...

162
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:50,214
Though if you think about it,
and I never did till now...

163
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:55,445
...we're all on kind of an assembly line,
just going through each other's lives.

164
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,248
Until one day,
you close the factory down...

165
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:03,417
...take one product home and use it
monogamously for the rest of your life.

166
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:06,689
- My mistake, Matty. Forget it.
- No, I'm not...

167
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:09,425
It's not a mistake.
I'm just saying that...

168
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:12,627
If I'd given you one and hid the rest,
I'd be a great guy?

169
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,796
- But because I was open with you...
- I said, forget it!

170
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:34,756
Matty, what am I doing?

171
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:36,450
I caught myself.

172
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:38,892
Don't judge others
till you check yourself.

173
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:42,761
You're lucky if it's your fault,
you can correct the situation.

174
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,164
I'm nervous over something
that's going on with me.

175
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,773
I'm with an attractive guy
you'd be an idiot...

176
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:54,309
...to mistake for anything more
than just a fun friendship.

177
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,879
And, yes, amazing sex.

178
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:02,611
Instead, I give that guy a hard time
for just being who he is.

179
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,988
Totally my fault.

180
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:09,055
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,861
Please forgive me.

182
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:16,024
- Are you apologizing?
- Yeah.

183
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:20,894
If you're really apologizing,
you may be my dream girl.

184
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:22,903
I heard footsteps and I'm like:

185
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:25,975
"Okay, somebody nuts is coming back
to be more nuts."

186
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:30,376
And now, an apology?
You may be my dream girl.

187
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:32,573
Yeah.

188
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,463
They said you'd be in here.

189
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:22,696
How bad is this?

190
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:31,699
The Justice Department is investigating
the company for security fraud.

191
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:33,244
- Based on what? Why are they...?
- They don't have to say.

192
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:35,041
- Based on what? Why are they...?
- They don't have to say.

193
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:37,511
They've subpoenaed
everything from abroad.

194
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:41,174
- You didn't tell your father? The worst...
- Of course I told him.

195
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,013
- No.
- Yes.

196
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:45,383
He's gonna meet us in my office
right now.

197
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,950
- Your concern is?
- I don't have one.

198
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,960
Well, we better go.

199
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:54,192
I agree.

200
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:58,568
- Morning.
- Morning, Dad.

201
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:07,069
We need the company lawyer for
whatever this is? What's going on?

202
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:14,752
- You want a kiss too?
- Not today.

203
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:17,281
- You haven't read this yet?
- Just once.

204
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:18,945
They are investigating us...

205
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:22,149
...for misstatement of receivables
to inflate earnings.

206
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,454
- Stock fraud.
- What do you know about it?

207
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:27,158
Nothing. But I'm responsible.

208
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:29,031
What, are you being noble?

209
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,532
I'm telling you what
recent legislation says.

210
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:34,171
If it's true and I didn't know,
I should have.

211
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:38,839
Can you ask your assistant to come in?
We have to respond immediately.

212
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:46,406
Annie, could you please come on in?
And bring your laptop.

213
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:49,881
All these items mentioned...

214
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:55,492
...you must have checked whether we
had funds before talking to the analyst.

215
00:14:55,994 --> 00:15:00,931
No. Most of them came from
Dad's office, so I assumed that...

216
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,932
...with everyone working...
- You do not assume.

217
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:06,002
- Excuse me.
- You do not trust anyone.

218
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,296
Not him, not me.

219
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:09,605
Cynicism is sanity.

220
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:11,605
Good guidelines, I'm afraid.

221
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:15,712
I assumed that with everyone
working creatively on the new line...

222
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,643
"Creatively."

223
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:18,975
Just a second, Dad.

224
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:20,645
- Now...
- Let me finish.

225
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,956
No! Drivel does not get to finish.
Drivel gets interrupted.

226
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,815
Is it possible to get the...?

227
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:31,052
So shaping the corporate culture
might not bring results...

228
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:33,754
You are a fucking moron!

229
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,399
- Too rough.
- Much too rough.

230
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:40,299
- Don't talk like that in front of Annie.
- Okay! Okay. I caught myself.

231
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,073
Now may I get back to the...

232
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,542
Sorry, Annie. The fucking...

233
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:52,338
Sorry again, Annie.

234
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:54,075
- Point.

235
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:59,120
I have overlooked every limitation
I know you to have.

236
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,521
Why? Because you are my son.

237
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:07,163
And you're a good guy,
as every prick with half a brain...

238
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:10,358
...who ever took advantage of you
knows absolutely.

239
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:13,766
But, Gidge,
there is a bottom line here...

240
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:18,272
...which is, because of your
notions of trust and creativity...

241
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:24,177
...we may be inevitably forced to crawl
on by some assistant U.S. Attorney.

242
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:27,045
And if this "almost made
the law review" creature...

243
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:29,778
...pins me between
a choice of saving you...

244
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:32,889
...or the company that I founded
and you preside over...

245
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:35,918
...I may be forced
to choose the company...

246
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:40,758
...even though doing so may break my
life forever, which is finally my fault...

247
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:44,129
...for handing you a job
where your pathetic assumptions...

248
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:47,669
...or notions of trust
can cause such calamity!

249
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,897
Annie!

250
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:51,803
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.

251
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,079
What? Darling, are you crying?
What's wrong?

252
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,305
I'm fine. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

253
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:02,380
- Charles, Annie just...
- Ron.

254
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:06,383
Why don't you have Annie take down
everything you need, okay?

255
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:11,819
- Okay?
- All right.

256
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:16,823
You should go home now
and think about interviewing attorneys.

257
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:19,663
I don't know if the company
will be allowed to pay.

258
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:21,561
The company will pay.

259
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,642
To the Justice Department:

260
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:29,443
The individual's name is on here.

261
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:32,913
All documents relating
to loan applications.

262
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:37,453
All financial statements, including
general ledgers, income statements...

263
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:47,162
Oh, God.

264
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:52,291
The term "document" includes,
but is not limited to, all personal files...

265
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,335
...telephone messages, and...

266
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,509
Just a minute.

267
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,882
Hello?

268
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:14,491
George. I have been
through things like this...

269
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:19,494
...and I'd like to give you some difficult
advice, if you would like to hear it.

270
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,122
Okay.

271
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:24,701
Accept the enormity.

272
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:27,633
Give up illusions of containment.
The hardest fact...

273
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:31,138
...is that,
no matter what the outcome...

274
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:37,270
...it is unlikely you can ever again be
the person you have been until now.

275
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:43,183
Okay, thanks.
Look, can I call you later?

276
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:47,188
Any further contact between us
would be inappropriate.

277
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:50,152
Good luck, George.

278
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:59,465
Is Bryant there yet?
Yeah, it's George.

279
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:02,128
Look, I need to speak with him.

280
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:05,533
Yeah, well,
reach him as soon as you can.

281
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,234
Thank you.

282
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:13,850
Hi, this is George.
I've left you four messages, all urgent.

283
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:17,681
You know I underplay, so I don't
understand your failure to call back.

284
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:19,956
Thank you.

285
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:22,858
Well? Tell me.
You must have some reaction.

286
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,454
No, I have one.

287
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,598
I'm just not proud of it.

288
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,463
It's just me being analytical.

289
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:34,201
I was thinking about my work.

290
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:35,862
Let me explain the thought.

291
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:48,175
This is for us, I swear it.

292
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:53,922
We are not well-matched
for this interval in your life.

293
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:57,390
Not with me against this deadline
and you being investigated.

294
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:00,793
I don't want our relationship
to become cannon fodder...

295
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:03,763
...for this apparition
in your working life.

296
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:07,065
I will be here for you at the end.

297
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,569
You can count on that.

298
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:13,405
You wanna split up
until I'm problem-free?

299
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:14,840
Please, I'd appreciate...

300
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:19,073
You're breaking up with...? Oh, my...
You're breaking up with...?

301
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,775
I'm hitting the pause button.

302
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:25,650
So that we don't waste
our precious energies on stuff.

303
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,441
No.

304
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:27,846
No. No.

305
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:31,011
Nope. No, thank you.

306
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:37,427
Tonight I'm in

307
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:41,931
A romantic mood, yeah

308
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:44,864
Let's take a shower

309
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:48,301
Shower together

310
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,204
I'll wash your body

311
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:55,436
You wash mine, yeah

312
00:21:57,181 --> 00:22:02,312
Rub me down
With some hot oils, baby

313
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:03,621
Yeah

314
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:12,425
Hello. Hello?

315
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:14,722
Hello?

316
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,560
- Hi, boss.
- Hi.

317
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:18,759
- How are you? It's not too late...
- No.

318
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,834
I'm fine. It's fine.
Hold on just a second.

319
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:23,064
Okay.

320
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,713
Hey. Thanks so much for calling.

321
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,476
I can't sleep. I don't know
what got into me this morning.

322
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:38,121
I have never taken a swat
at anybody.

323
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:40,280
Well, I do know. I'm pregnant.

324
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:42,649
You're preg... You're pregnant!

325
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,762
Yeah. Secret's out.

326
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,223
You're pregnant!

327
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,129
I had a hunch.

328
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:01,410
That guy that picks you up
sometimes, Al?

329
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:03,470
Oh, you noticed Al.

330
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:05,945
He lights up every time
he sees you.

331
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,650
So good, huh?

332
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:10,412
He's great. He's just
been out of work lately.

333
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:13,250
So we've just been
marathon worrying.

334
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:16,416
So I'm not myself lately.
So when your father...

335
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:18,084
Oh, don't worry about it.

336
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:22,795
So did you tell Terry
about what happened to you?

337
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:25,092
I'd rather not get into that.

338
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:27,863
She bailed? You should go call...

339
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:31,838
...another girl. Distract yourself.
Right?

340
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:34,202
Forward motion.

341
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:37,140
They can't stop girls
from talking to you.

342
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:40,049
My God, is that it?
They're directing people...

343
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:42,208
...not to talk to me?

344
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:51,459
I had to sign a confidentiality statement
where I'm liable financially if I...

345
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:53,961
With this new situation...
You know what?

346
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:56,725
The hell with everything!
So I lose my job.

347
00:23:56,901 --> 00:24:00,098
Wait, honey, I can't. "Honey." Sorry.
My medical would lapse.

348
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:03,240
I've gotta care for my baby.
Al still hasn't proposed...

349
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:07,400
You won't lose your job, Annie, okay?
All right? Don't tell me anything.

350
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:09,736
Sorry, boss.

351
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:12,512
Thanks a lot.

352
00:24:13,818 --> 00:24:15,342
You have a good night, Annie.

353
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:18,648
I am just dying for you.

354
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:21,222
That's a little extreme.

355
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:23,325
Just be nauseous for me.

356
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:27,287
Yeah. A little morning sick for me.

357
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,160
Not a problem.

358
00:24:52,022 --> 00:24:55,856
- Hello?
- Hi. Lisa. This is George.

359
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,952
George Madison.

360
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,367
I... I'm not sure how to
further identify myself.

361
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:06,935
Your voice sounds a little familiar.

362
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:10,403
I made this incredibly stupid
phone call to you a few days ago.

363
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:13,941
Oh, right. How you doing, George?

364
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:16,375
Would you like to have dinner?

365
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:19,541
- But aren't you?
- No, I am not.

366
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,081
- You see...
- You don't have to explain.

367
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:26,052
I'm sort of seeing somebody,
but we can have a meal.

368
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:28,753
- When?
- Anytime.

369
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:29,950
Tomorrow's clear.

370
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:31,924
- Triplo Due?
- I'll meet you there.

371
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:35,964
- It's Triple Two in English.
- It's gotta be early, 6:00. I'm in training.

372
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:39,802
Okay. So it's a d... It's a date.

373
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,938
- Okay.
- All right.

374
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:44,301
- I have made a date.
- Bye.

375
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:46,033
Good night.

376
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,873
Come on, come on.

377
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:22,696
Georgie. George.

378
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:25,025
- Let's go inside.
- I have a date.

379
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:29,070
Date? Son, we are in
a rapidly evolving situation here.

380
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:32,572
I must tell you, I was afraid
to use the telephone.

381
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:33,937
Because?

382
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:36,477
No. No, no. Don't tell me.

383
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:40,083
I'm not ready to take on
anything that I can't handle.

384
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,014
No, you know what?
I know exactly how to handle this.

385
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:45,451
I'll treat myself
like a company in trouble.

386
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:49,786
What I think is you are just indulging
in a lot of neuroses.

387
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,895
You take on too much,
it becomes about how much...

388
00:28:53,063 --> 00:28:55,930
...instead of how well you handle it.
That applies now.

389
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,294
- Stand still!
- No.

390
00:28:57,468 --> 00:29:00,028
You do not have the luxury
of not hearing this.

391
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:02,638
Are you making me literally run
from bad news?

392
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:05,536
The chickenshit board has dec...

393
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:12,848
I gotta go. I have a date.

394
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:14,950
What happened to you was horrific.

395
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,880
- Stop acting tough.
- It's the worst move!

396
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:19,352
Look at the time.

397
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:22,651
Hey, everybody, I have to leave.
I have a date.

398
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:24,418
- What?
- Now, Lise?

399
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:26,324
- Yeah.
- Lisa?

400
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,756
Nobody's buying this.

401
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:30,798
- We should protest!
- We should.

402
00:29:31,168 --> 00:29:33,159
Smalls, what do you want us to do?

403
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:36,864
- Lisa.
- Okay. There is one thing.

404
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,101
When I come to visit you at training
camp when you're getting ready...

405
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:43,872
...just don't feel funny talking to me.

406
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:47,505
Okay? Don't feel sad for me.

407
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:51,484
Because my biggest fear is that
you won't be yourselves around me.

408
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:55,489
I've seen that, and if that happened,
it would just make me feel like l...

409
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:57,786
Like I didn't know you anymore.

410
00:29:57,961 --> 00:30:00,293
And I want to.

411
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:02,591
I need to.

412
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,728
Just say, "Okay, Lisa."

413
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:08,196
Okay, Lisa.

414
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:11,003
God. L...

415
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:15,703
I gotta go. I gotta go.
He's waiting for me.

416
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:17,813
- I love you.
- Love you. Love you.

417
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:20,040
- Love you too.
- Go, Lise.

418
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:22,276
- Go, Lise.
- Lise!

419
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:36,065
- Hi.
- Name, please.

420
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,928
I'm meeting George...

421
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:41,662
- Madison?
- I'm not sure. I forget.

422
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:50,036
Could that be him over there?

423
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:53,210
I'll bet that is him.

424
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,048
That's the sort of day I'm having.

425
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:59,951
You don't have to take me.
Thank you, though.

426
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:08,264
George?

427
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,800
Are you George?

428
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,493
I'm Lisa.

429
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,468
- Very good of you to join me.
- Yeah.

430
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:19,565
How you doing?

431
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:22,506
How are you doing?

432
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:24,939
I'm great.

433
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:26,707
- Yeah?
- Yep.

434
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:29,318
Well, treasure it.

435
00:31:32,122 --> 00:31:33,180
You okay?

436
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:36,656
No. I'm sorry,
I'm not even aware that...

437
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:41,789
I have to apologize. This might not
be the best first impression.

438
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:44,195
I... I had...

439
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:48,394
...an unusual 24 hours.

440
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:52,133
Okay. Well, the bad days
make the good ones better.

441
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:53,833
So don't worry about it.

442
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:57,776
Is this an Italian restaurant?

443
00:31:57,948 --> 00:31:59,677
Yes, it's a very good one.

444
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,345
Oh, yeah, it looks good.

445
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:04,209
- Let's get a drink.
- None for me.

446
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:07,915
You know what? You're right.
Yeah. I shouldn't drink.

447
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:09,991
- Don't let me stop you.
- No, no, no.

448
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,119
Believe me, drinking too much
two nights in a row could be a mistake.

449
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:19,991
I haven't had anything since
lunch yesterday, so I'm starving.

450
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:22,399
You don't drink at all?

451
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:25,507
- I follow my father's rule on drinking.
- Which is?

452
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:29,043
Never drink to feel better.
Only drink to feel even better.

453
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,641
That's fantastic.

454
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:33,639
Yep. It's a good one.

455
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:36,843
That's great.
But sometimes I think that...

456
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,080
...one drink can give you
a little better perspective.

457
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:43,390
Not for me.
I guess it depends on the person.

458
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,963
Look, if you wanna have a drink,
have a drink. Keeping talking about it...

459
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:51,692
I don't need permission to drink.
If I want a drink, I'll order one.

460
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:54,701
Jesus! Do you know
I don't know you?

461
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,907
I'm sorry. I'm not good today.

462
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:02,939
Maybe I should say what's going on.
I never talk about myself. I should.

463
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:06,410
No! Don't do that.

464
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:11,053
George, this is what I'm suggesting.
That we eat.

465
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:15,019
And that we don't work
at this conversation.

466
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:17,353
- Let's just cut ourselves a break...
- Yes.

467
00:33:17,527 --> 00:33:21,019
...and give ourselves permission
to be quiet.

468
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:24,759
For the whole dinner.
Completely quiet.

469
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:28,866
Can I talk to the waiter?

470
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,534
As long as you don't tell him
about your day.

471
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:37,264
I mean, that...

472
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:41,771
That was just what I needed.

473
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:45,706
You take care of yourself.

474
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,818
I'm just leaving my place
to go to dinner.

475
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,187
- Good evening, Mr. Madison. Taxi?
- Yes, thank you, Tom.

476
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,523
Okay, Dad, I'm ready.
What happened?

477
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:03,393
What if I come by later?
The phone isn't...

478
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:08,230
Just tell me. I'd rather use the rest of
the night processing the information.

479
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:16,740
I'm sorry, this is private.
There's still some privacy left.

480
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:21,579
The board is refusing to pay...

481
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:24,584
...your legal bills. Now...
- Hey.

482
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:28,652
I think I met a great girl.

483
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,496
Oh, good. There is a God.

484
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:53,716
The girls needed to tell you
how they felt.

485
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:55,215
It's something, isn't it?

486
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,645
Last time I saw that was
when a kid died in high school...

487
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:01,017
...and they left this stuff by the road.

488
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:02,453
How about straight talk?

489
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:05,527
I am very sensitive
to what you're going through.

490
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,023
You know what you need most
right now?

491
00:36:08,298 --> 00:36:09,890
- Yes.
- What?

492
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:12,064
Insensitivity.

493
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:16,562
Yeah?

494
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:20,268
- Who is it?
- It's Lisa.

495
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:22,104
Could you narrow it down?

496
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:23,280
I'm not kidding right now.

497
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,645
I'm not kidding right now.

498
00:36:24,814 --> 00:36:28,807
A good Lisa. Come here. Get in.

499
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:35,051
- You're alone, right?
- Yeah.

500
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:37,793
I was just working up the night.

501
00:36:38,662 --> 00:36:40,027
Do you want me to be here?

502
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:43,727
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

503
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,925
Then this is what I need.

504
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:49,401
If in the middle of the night
I start crying or...

505
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:54,306
...shaking or acting enormously upset,
I don't want you to ask what's wrong.

506
00:36:54,477 --> 00:36:57,674
I want you to just ignore it.
Is that okay with you?

507
00:36:58,682 --> 00:37:01,276
- Actually, that's my preference.
- Okay, good.

508
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:06,252
Have a seat. My game's coming up.

509
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:18,132
Matty Reynolds gets him.
The Nationals win.

510
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:20,565
- Good mechanics.
- Yeah.

511
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:32,677
Okay. Let's go, I got it.

512
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:47,727
Can you afford me?

513
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:53,500
The firm is refusing to pay my legal
bills, but my father is willing to help.

514
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,128
You can't take money from him,
not with his position on the board.

515
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:59,234
What would your retainer be?

516
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:05,047
Three hundred thousand, and another
three in escrow in case it goes to trial.

517
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:12,316
- I suppose I could sell...
- Everything you can.

518
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:14,247
Okay.

519
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:22,090
- Sit down.
- I don't wanna lie down.

520
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:24,863
- I said, "Sit down."
- I don't think you did.

521
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:28,368
Yes, I did. I never ask someone
to lie down on a first visit.

522
00:38:29,506 --> 00:38:31,440
- Sorry.
- Okay.

523
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:39,515
So...

524
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,412
...why are you here?

525
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:46,844
I have a month left on my insurance
and they pay up to six visits.

526
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:50,252
I meant, is there a difficulty?

527
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:53,453
Well...

528
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:59,359
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go
because this is just stupid.

529
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:01,561
Not that this is stupid. But I mean...

530
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:05,401
Thank you for your time. Just for me,
you know. I mean, not this.

531
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:07,907
- But thank you for understanding.
- All right.

532
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:10,069
- Okay.
- Okay.

533
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:14,139
You know, can I ask you
just one stupid question?

534
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:16,309
No such thing.

535
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:19,853
Because I'm leaving
and I'm not gonna do this again.

536
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:24,687
I was wondering if there's one general
thing you've found over the years...

537
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:27,091
...to be generally true...

538
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:31,165
...in a general way
that would help anyone...

539
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:33,495
...with any situation?

540
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,695
That's a great question.

541
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,931
Yes.

542
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:42,568
I'd say, figure out what you want
and learn how to ask for it.

543
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:45,706
Okay.

544
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:54,250
Those are both really hard.

545
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:59,990
Yes, but you came here,
which was hard for you.

546
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:02,495
And you're leaving right away,
also hard.

547
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:06,761
So you're tougher than
you think you are right now.

548
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:09,728
Thanks.

549
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:11,367
I appreciate that.

550
00:40:11,775 --> 00:40:14,335
- Good luck.
- Okay.

551
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:19,476
- I can see why people do this.
- Thanks.

552
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:45,400
I'm sorry. I thought some of them
were bringing their wives.

553
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:49,409
That usually changes
the behavior considerably.

554
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:53,675
The rookie who lives here had this,
maybe the best barbecue anywhere...

555
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,408
...flown in from Houston.

556
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:58,850
He bought a first-class seat
so his friend could fly it in.

557
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:02,480
Wait till you taste it. Try the sauce
first. That's how you judge.

558
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:05,992
- This place nails it. And you know...
- No hard feelings.

559
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:10,758
You can stay, I just...
I can't do this right now.

560
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:15,736
There's Christian athletes inside.
We'll eat with them.

561
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:19,834
Do you ever wonder what's going on
in my life? Because you never ask.

562
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:23,676
I thought I wasn't supposed to.
Is that just at night?

563
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:28,142
This is... You know what?
What I think I mean is...

564
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,718
...I should tell you
what's going on with me.

565
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:38,218
I got...

566
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:41,889
Oh, God.

567
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:43,765
I got cut.

568
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,833
Sorry.

569
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:49,995
Let's have some barbecue
and we'll talk about it. That's...

570
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:52,772
I don't wanna eat now.

571
00:41:53,743 --> 00:41:55,472
I can't.

572
00:41:56,846 --> 00:41:58,711
You don't wanna eat anything?

573
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:00,110
I just can't.

574
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,642
Well...

575
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:07,022
Okay.

576
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:08,981
I'll go with you.

577
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:10,950
Okay.

578
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:28,477
So I'm gonna go
to grad school at night.

579
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:32,513
I'll have to work a few jobs, but
I've got the private coaching thing...

580
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:35,116
...and I lined up
this part-time retail thing.

581
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:37,810
- That's great.
- That's good. I got that covered.

582
00:42:37,987 --> 00:42:40,251
I just have this problem
with my attitude.

583
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:45,622
It's like I have to get to the place where
I appreciate what the game gave me.

584
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:50,198
And accept and even embrace
the obvious...

585
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:53,062
...that the time comes
for every athlete when they...

586
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,965
It's never gonna come for me.

587
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,831
You know what?
Maybe we shouldn't talk.

588
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:01,977
Maybe we should watch TV
or something.

589
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:05,706
No, no, no. Hold on, come here.

590
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:09,813
I hear everything you're saying.

591
00:43:09,986 --> 00:43:15,049
Come sit over here. I'm gonna set you
down and make you something to eat.

592
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:18,853
We get a little food in your stomach,
we'll both think better.

593
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:22,093
You like inspirational stories?

594
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:24,460
Okay, I got one for you.

595
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:27,694
I knew a really good player once,
and the coach cut him.

596
00:43:28,938 --> 00:43:31,463
And the guy just felt...
He felt impotent.

597
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:36,374
Now you're probably feeling whatever
the female version of that word is.

598
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:37,570
It's the same word.

599
00:43:39,315 --> 00:43:42,648
Don't let what's going on with you
make you give me a hard time.

600
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:44,616
Because that's not productive.

601
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:47,051
I'm not.
It's the same word for women.

602
00:43:47,223 --> 00:43:49,123
"Impotent"?

603
00:43:52,562 --> 00:43:54,962
Okay. Tie goes to the pretty one.

604
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:58,760
Same word. He was feeling impotent,
just like you may be feeling.

605
00:43:58,935 --> 00:44:00,994
I don't think that's how I feel...

606
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,535
Can I finish my thought?

607
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:06,607
Maybe it'll help, maybe it won't,
but I'm trying.

608
00:44:07,777 --> 00:44:09,005
I'm sorry.

609
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:10,907
- That's all right.
- Go ahead.

610
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,949
Okay. So his girlfriend had a cat
and he started to save the cat's shit...

611
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:19,148
- A little trust.
- Okay.

612
00:44:20,256 --> 00:44:24,886
He started to save all the cat's shit,
and every few days or so...

613
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:29,928
...he'd take a little amount and wrap it
in a different package, like a gift...

614
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:32,897
...or a magazine roll
or something you order online.

615
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:35,037
Every few days for eight months...

616
00:44:35,204 --> 00:44:38,401
...he would send these cat turds
to the guy who cut him.

617
00:44:44,814 --> 00:44:46,372
Is that it?

618
00:44:47,784 --> 00:44:49,911
Yeah, that's it. It's a great story.

619
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:52,714
Did you understand it was the coach
he sent it to?

620
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:57,019
To the guy who cut him?
He felt impotent, and then he...

621
00:44:57,193 --> 00:44:59,320
File it away. It worked for this guy.

622
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:04,933
No, so he stopped
when his anger went away...

623
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:06,534
Yeah. Yeah.

624
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,261
Well, the cat died.

625
00:45:10,606 --> 00:45:12,073
Oh, God.

626
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:14,971
There, a smile.

627
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:19,747
That's horrible.
I didn't know the cat was gonna die.

628
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,110
You feel better.

629
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:25,550
Great. I hated seeing you
touch bottom.

630
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,255
That was sweet.

631
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:37,623
Yeah, you're right.

632
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:42,332
It's okay.

633
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:56,679
- You are amazing.
- You were great.

634
00:45:56,853 --> 00:46:00,084
- It takes two, you know?
- At least.

635
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:01,720
Creep.

636
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,353
Oh, boy.

637
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:10,092
You clap to bring on the lights
the minute we finish?

638
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:12,063
Why? What's the matter?

639
00:46:12,802 --> 00:46:16,795
Just clapping your hands and
those dumb lights makes me feel like...

640
00:46:16,973 --> 00:46:20,500
Wait, wait, let me guess.
I think I can get it.

641
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,176
Like I'm not thinking about you.

642
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:25,440
Look who got it.

643
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:28,641
- Yeah, look who read your mind.
- God.

644
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:30,786
Yeah. What should I do?

645
00:46:31,854 --> 00:46:34,220
God. Turn them off!

646
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:38,393
You wanna do it? Come on.
Oh, it's fun.

647
00:46:39,595 --> 00:46:41,358
Grow up.

648
00:46:41,831 --> 00:46:43,230
No.

649
00:46:48,237 --> 00:46:51,001
It was kind of fun, wasn't it?

650
00:46:51,874 --> 00:46:54,570
I'm gonna teach you
how to have fun.

651
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:15,120
- You didn't see that?
- What?

652
00:47:16,232 --> 00:47:19,463
Let me ask you something.
How do you know when you're in love?

653
00:47:20,937 --> 00:47:23,701
- Intriguing.
- Ryan. Get loose.

654
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,407
Well...

655
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:30,572
- What?
- I got a way.

656
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:33,909
Whenever this one thing happens,
I know I'm done.

657
00:47:35,384 --> 00:47:38,080
It's personal. I don't want
anyone making fun of me.

658
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:40,279
No, no one's... Go!

659
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:47,394
I'm in love with somebody when
I wear a condom with the other girls.

660
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:52,962
Holy shit, I'm in love.

661
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:07,940
Hello?

662
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:10,184
You up for a crazy idea?

663
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:11,513
Yes.

664
00:48:11,687 --> 00:48:14,212
Maybe it'd be fun if you
kind of move in with me.

665
00:48:16,092 --> 00:48:17,423
Hello? Are you there?

666
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:19,254
Barely.

667
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:22,795
- Are you serious?
- I know.

668
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:25,325
I told you it was crazy.

669
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:27,833
Can you give me a minute
to form a thought?

670
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:30,802
- Yeah, yeah. Take your time.
- Okay. Thanks.

671
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:32,304
Okay, I'll call you back.

672
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,851
That was quick.

673
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:49,924
I know, but, Lisa, listen.
Today I caught myself...

674
00:48:50,092 --> 00:48:51,150
Thanks, Bobby.

675
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:56,019
Today I caught myself wishing
you were in the bullpen with me.

676
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:59,793
Literally having a daydream.
I mean, that's serious.

677
00:49:01,804 --> 00:49:03,567
Li... Are you there?

678
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:06,037
Hello? What are you doing?

679
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:07,534
I think I'm thinking.

680
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,975
Don't! You shouldn't have to think
about a great idea.

681
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:13,081
You said this was a crazy idea.

682
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:17,652
I know, I think it's both. I think part of
the greatness is how crazy it is.

683
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,549
What first popped into your mind?

684
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:23,751
That I don't know what to say
and it makes me feel stupid.

685
00:49:23,926 --> 00:49:25,052
Second thing.

686
00:49:25,227 --> 00:49:27,354
That I've never lived
with anyone before.

687
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,260
Great. No one's had a chance
to ruin you.

688
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:33,763
Have you ever lived with anybody?

689
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:37,337
With me you get into what does
"living together" mean...

690
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:39,098
...and duration is a factor.

691
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:41,436
But listen, is...? Do you think...

692
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,670
...this is something?
Do you wanna do this?

693
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:49,214
- Hello?
- I honestly...

694
00:49:49,385 --> 00:49:51,785
- Yeah?
- I don't know how to figure this out.

695
00:49:52,355 --> 00:49:54,619
Is there tingling?
Do you have goose bumps?

696
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:58,021
Maybe I need to work my voice
a little bit until you get them.

697
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:01,124
I think I just got them.

698
00:50:02,765 --> 00:50:04,062
What?

699
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,961
- I think I just got them.
- Yeah.

700
00:50:07,136 --> 00:50:08,763
I really like you, Matty.

701
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:10,563
Okay.

702
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:14,266
- Good phone call.
- Good phone call.

703
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:16,536
- Right? Yeah.
- Thank you.

704
00:50:22,952 --> 00:50:24,943
This is such a mistake.

705
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:28,420
- Overstepping alert.
- You sublet your apartment.

706
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:32,828
You told me don't do anything halfway
unless you're willing to be half happy.

707
00:50:32,895 --> 00:50:36,763
Don't make important life decisions
when you are mush. It's too dangerous.

708
00:50:36,932 --> 00:50:39,492
Fight low self-esteem,
don't give it the wheel.

709
00:50:39,668 --> 00:50:43,001
I am packed here. I am doing this.

710
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:47,734
So back off, or do what you always do
for me, pull out some damn positives.

711
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:54,974
I'm sorry, honey.

712
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:57,818
Positives.

713
00:50:57,987 --> 00:51:01,423
Hell, the guy has
a 94-mile-an-hour fastball.

714
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:04,423
He makes 14 million a year.
Go get him.

715
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:09,093
- Got your bag? I cleared some space.
- Yeah, I just...

716
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:13,869
- Yeah, come on in.
- Okay.

717
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:20,842
Okay, I can get rid of
both of these things right here.

718
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:24,309
I'll talk to the guys downstairs.
They have storage space.

719
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,004
It's okay.

720
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:28,076
We'll make it work.

721
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,223
Hey, boss, it's me.

722
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,961
- Annie.
- Hi. Did you call that girl?

723
00:51:47,136 --> 00:51:52,472
No. You don't have to bring me food.
It's enough that you found this place.

724
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:56,042
That was selfish. You dress up
my neighborhood. Love your window?

725
00:51:56,212 --> 00:51:57,372
It's great.

726
00:51:57,913 --> 00:51:58,937
This is...

727
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:02,448
Cooking relaxes me when I can't
sleep. So why not just call her?

728
00:52:02,618 --> 00:52:05,280
Honestly? Because my
first impression wasn't great.

729
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:07,854
I'd rather be more myself
when I see her next.

730
00:52:08,023 --> 00:52:10,514
What if someone beats you to her?

731
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:13,594
Optimism is sanity for me right now.

732
00:52:14,763 --> 00:52:17,163
Please, sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

733
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:18,925
Relax.

734
00:52:21,637 --> 00:52:22,661
Look.

735
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:28,566
I'm in a funny position...

736
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:32,339
...but I know stuff about
what happened at work.

737
00:52:32,515 --> 00:52:35,245
I can't tell you
because of that thing I signed...

738
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:40,616
...but if you start guessing, I can't help
it if this face is an open book. Look!

739
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:45,021
Stop. You'd get in trouble, and just
listening could be wrongdoing for me.

740
00:52:45,194 --> 00:52:46,889
This information is killing me!

741
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:50,361
It's like I know someone is gonna
shoot you and I can't scream:

742
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:54,697
"Watch out! That man's gonna
blow your frigging head off!"

743
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:57,771
Please play this game with me,
or I'll just tell you!

744
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,908
- No!
- For God's sake, let me unburden!

745
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:03,909
Stop! Stop!
Annie, sit down, please. Sit down.

746
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,140
Careful. You have to understand
what this is like for me right now.

747
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:13,588
Picture a very angry ocean. A storm.
And I'm on this little tiny boat.

748
00:53:13,756 --> 00:53:16,816
And miraculously,
this boat is still afloat.

749
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:19,859
And that boat is that
I haven't done anything wrong.

750
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:23,897
Like letting you say something you're
legally constrained from revealing.

751
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:27,968
Not doing anything wrong is
what's keeping me afloat. All right?

752
00:53:28,137 --> 00:53:30,332
If I lose that, I'm gone.

753
00:53:32,808 --> 00:53:34,935
Don't rock the boat.

754
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,078
- I know about the boat.
- Stop!

755
00:53:37,246 --> 00:53:40,909
- It's a terrible boat! Get out of the boat!
- Respect me on this!

756
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,310
For what it's worth, it doesn't matter.

757
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:48,482
I think I've guessed
the same stuff you know.

758
00:53:49,325 --> 00:53:50,815
I think I know what you do.

759
00:54:07,643 --> 00:54:09,167
Nope.

760
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:13,148
You couldn't function if you knew
what I'm talking about.

761
00:54:13,315 --> 00:54:15,408
Oh, I think I could.

762
00:54:16,585 --> 00:54:17,779
I think I am.

763
00:54:19,221 --> 00:54:21,212
- Leave it.
- What if I give you a hint?

764
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:25,690
No, don't! Don't make me
leave my own apartment. Please.

765
00:54:33,435 --> 00:54:35,528
Okay. Eat something.

766
00:54:37,006 --> 00:54:38,496
Thank you.

767
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:42,000
The lasagna looks amazing,
by the way.

768
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:51,918
- Hello, Dad.
- Are you coming to my place?

769
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:54,288
- Almost there.
- Good.

770
00:54:54,456 --> 00:54:57,721
I have some disturbing news.

771
00:54:57,893 --> 00:55:00,054
- What?
- I'll wait till you get here.

772
00:55:00,229 --> 00:55:03,164
Tell me. It'd be nice to get
one piece of bad news...

773
00:55:03,332 --> 00:55:06,028
...without someone studying me
to see how I take it.

774
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:09,066
Anger can be useful.
Watch out for the bitterness.

775
00:55:09,438 --> 00:55:10,564
What's the news, Dad?

776
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:18,076
There are strong indications
that they are going to indict you.

777
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:21,074
I have canceled
everything I've got...

778
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,378
...and I am dedicating myself
completely to this.

779
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:28,154
George?

780
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:57,209
George?

781
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,983
Oh, God, please don't kid me.

782
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:03,549
How are you?

783
00:56:05,127 --> 00:56:06,856
Really...

784
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:11,232
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

785
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:13,958
That's so funny.

786
00:56:19,975 --> 00:56:21,567
Thanks.

787
00:56:21,744 --> 00:56:23,905
- You didn't have to do that.
- Yeah, I did.

788
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,309
So do you live in this building?

789
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:29,847
Did you leave?

790
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:32,116
Are you still here?

791
00:56:32,287 --> 00:56:33,345
Yeah. Absolutely.

792
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:36,780
- Here I am.
- Okay.

793
00:56:37,326 --> 00:56:39,817
Sorry I'm not more hospitable.
I'm in a hurry.

794
00:56:39,995 --> 00:56:43,328
Can I go first?
I want to explain why I haven't called.

795
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,597
I don't understand.

796
00:56:47,136 --> 00:56:51,698
I think I've made a bad assumption that
we've been on the same wavelength.

797
00:56:51,874 --> 00:56:54,775
That didn't come out right at all.
I didn't mean...

798
00:56:56,912 --> 00:56:59,278
I didn't quite mean to say that either.

799
00:56:59,648 --> 00:57:03,414
You ever wanna delete every sentence
you say, even as you say them?

800
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:05,280
- No.
- No?

801
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:09,725
You're funny. You know,
I'm really glad I ran into you.

802
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:11,419
I bit your head off at dinner.

803
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:15,461
I have this thing about rudeness,
so I'm glad I could say I'm sorry.

804
00:57:16,832 --> 00:57:17,856
- No...
- Lisa!

805
00:57:18,033 --> 00:57:20,831
Yeah! I'm in the kitchen!

806
00:57:22,304 --> 00:57:23,862
Hey, babe.

807
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:26,707
George, this is my boyfriend, Matty.

808
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:30,672
Nice to meet you.

809
00:57:32,414 --> 00:57:34,644
- Who is he?
- You didn't even say hello.

810
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:38,253
I think you should check with me
before inviting some guy over...

811
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,617
...so I'm a little too pissed off
to just say hello.

812
00:57:43,926 --> 00:57:45,553
Can I talk to you?
