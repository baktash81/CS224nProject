1
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:18,684
In June 1863, after more than two years
of bloody conflict...

2
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:22,312
the Confederate army of Northern
Virginia, Robert E. Lee commanding...

3
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:25,815
slips across the Potomac
to begin the invasion of the North.

4
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:28,818
It is an army of 70,000 men.

5
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,986
They move slowly behind the Blue Ridge...

6
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,489
using the mountains
to screen their movements.

7
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:36,658
Their objective is to draw
the Union army out into the open...

8
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,785
where it can be destroyed.

9
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:42,788
Late in June, the Union army
of the Potomac, 80,000 men...

10
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:46,751
turns north from Virginia to begin
the great pursuit up the narrow roads...

11
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:49,795
across Maryland and into Pennsylvania.

12
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:53,965
General Lee knows that a letter has been
prepared by the Southern government.

13
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:56,176
A letter which offers peace.

14
00:04:56,218 --> 00:05:00,596
It is to be placed on the desk
of Abraham Lincoln, President of the U. S...

15
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,017
the day after Lee has destroyed
the Army of the Potomac...

16
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:07,145
somewhere north of Washington.

17
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:40,145
Federal cavalry. Two brigades.

18
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:55,214
- Howdy, friend. Where you headed?
- General Longstreet. I must see him.

19
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:56,423
Is that a fact?

20
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:59,342
I know General Lee's headquarters
are up here a little ways.

21
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:02,178
Wherever he is, Longstreet is nearby.

22
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:09,560
- Take me that way. This is urgent.
- Let me put it to you like this, stranger.

23
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:13,188
You're not in a uniform
and you're coming through my picket line.

24
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,941
I'll take you up there,
but if nobody there knows you...

25
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:20,653
I guess, unfortunately,
you'll have to be hanged.

26
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,683
Sir. General, sir.

27
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:57,019
I'm sorry, excuse me, sir,
but Harrison is back.

28
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:00,690
- Harrison?
- Yes, sir.

29
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:03,067
The scout, Harrison, sir.

30
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,487
I knew you'd want to know that
as soon as possible.

31
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,281
He's right outside here, sir.

32
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:18,539
Your servant, General.

33
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,750
Didn't expect to see me, did you?

34
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:25,045
I paid you in gold three weeks ago.
What do you got?

35
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:29,549
I don't suppose you got
another one of those.

36
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,384
That good southern tobacco.

37
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:32,927
What do you got?

38
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:37,264
I got the position of the Yankee army.
They're only a few miles down the road.

39
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:40,434
The whole Yankee army coming this way.
Seven corps.

40
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:41,602
A few miles?

41
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:45,689
Yes. Two brigades of Yankee cavalry
down that road about...

42
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,482
two, four hours away.

43
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:49,692
Behind that there's seven corps.

44
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:53,446
I put it all on a map, if you'd like to see it.
About 80,000 men.

45
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:55,656
All seven corps.

46
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:57,741
You didn't know any of that, General?

47
00:09:57,784 --> 00:09:59,785
You didn't know they were on the move.

48
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:02,120
You wouldn't be spread so thin
if you'd known.

49
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:04,415
How do you know we're spread out?

50
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:09,502
Listen, General. I'm good at this business.

51
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:14,798
Sir, I beg your pardon,
but if this man's story is true...

52
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:16,717
why haven't we heard about it?

53
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,012
General Stuart's cavalry is out there.
He would have reported.

54
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:25,350
- What do you know about Jeb Stuart?
- He's out there all right.

55
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:28,478
He's riding up north somewhere
getting his name in the papers.

56
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,855
He hasn't caused anything but a little fuss.

57
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,942
If the federal army was moving that fast,
as close as you say...

58
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:37,653
- I have to believe General Stuart...
- Now, look here.

59
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,531
I came within an angry mule's kick
of the whole Yankee cavalry.

60
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:44,784
And all the way through a picket line.

61
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:47,203
Hazardous, too.

62
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,165
I don't know what Jeb Stuart's doing.

63
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't care. I do my job.

64
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,544
Yankee cavalry's down the road,
thick as fleas...

65
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:58,088
not two hours hard ride
from this here now spot.

66
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,341
And that, by God, is the Lord's truth!

67
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,974
- Major Sorrel.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:16,772
Will you go to General Lee's headquarters
and notify him about this?

69
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:19,065
Yes, sir.

70
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,860
- Captain Goree.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:24,404
Get this man a tent.

72
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:27,155
And a cigar.

73
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:29,074
Sir.

74
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:33,036
He says the lead element is here
with the Third Corps...

75
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:35,038
the Sixth right behind...

76
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,124
supported by a column of federal cavalry.

77
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,751
Seven corps all together.

78
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:45,882
The First and Eleventh
are above Taneytown.

79
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:48,759
And there's more cavalry two hours east.

80
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:52,220
There may be as many
as 100,000 altogether.

81
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:56,182
Do you believe the man, this Mr. Harrison?

82
00:11:56,725 --> 00:12:01,145
No choice. You remember him, sir,
the actor from Mississippi?

83
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,107
An actor?
We move on the word of an actor?

84
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:07,317
Can't afford not to.

85
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:20,329
There would be some word
from General Stuart.

86
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:26,376
General Stuart would not leave us blind.

87
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:31,839
One other thing. Hooker's been replaced.

88
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:35,802
George Meade's the new commander.
Harrison read it in the Yankee papers.

89
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:39,847
George Meade, Pennsylvania man.

90
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:42,474
Meade would be cautious, I think.

91
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:45,560
Take him some time to get organized.

92
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:48,188
Perhaps we should move more swiftly.

93
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,148
There may be an opportunity here.

94
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,066
Yes, sir.

95
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:55,403
No reason to delay.

96
00:12:57,488 --> 00:13:00,115
I think we should concentrate here.

97
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:02,910
All the roads converge
just east of this gap.

98
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:05,537
- This junction will be very necessary.
- Yes, sir.

99
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:09,457
I left my spectacles over there.
What is the name of this town?

100
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:13,002
Gettysburg.

101
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:15,212
Very well.

102
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:21,301
Message for Colonel Chamberlain.

103
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:56,917
Colonel, darling. Rise up, me bucko.

104
00:13:57,877 --> 00:14:00,546
I'm sorry, darling,
but we got a bit of a problem here.

105
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:02,547
Would you like to hear about it?

106
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,924
Would you wake up, sir?

107
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:07,218
We got a whole company coming, sir.

108
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,555
This way. I'll give you time to wake up,
but we've got quite a problem.

109
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:16,184
Altogether, 120 men are coming.
We're to be having them as guests.

110
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:18,519
What?

111
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:20,605
Should be here any minute.

112
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:23,649
- Who?
- Mutineers.

113
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,901
Mutineers, Colonel, me lad.

114
00:14:25,944 --> 00:14:30,197
120 men from the old Second Maine
which has been disbanded.

115
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:33,658
120 mutineers?

116
00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:36,536
Yes, sir.

117
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:39,121
You see, what happened was
the enlistment papers...

118
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,040
on the old Second Maine run out.

119
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:43,792
They were sent home,
all except these 120 fellows...

120
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:46,253
who foolishly signed three-year papers.

121
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:47,922
Three years, that is.

122
00:14:47,964 --> 00:14:50,424
So these poor fellows
got one more year to serve.

123
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:54,094
Only they thought they were signing
to fight only with the Second Maine...

124
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:55,762
and the Second Maine only.

125
00:14:55,804 --> 00:14:57,889
So they...

126
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,641
quit.

127
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:03,311
They resigned, you see. 120 men.

128
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,772
- Colonel, are you all right?
- Yeah.

129
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:11,109
The point is,
these Maine fellows won't fight no more.

130
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:14,278
Nobody can send them home
and nobody knows what to do with them.

131
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:15,905
Until they thought of us...

132
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:19,241
being as we are the only other
Maine regiment in the Fifth Corps.

133
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:22,370
So they've been assigned to us.

134
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,496
Yes, sir.

135
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:27,249
I have a message here
from the new commanding general.

136
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,625
George Meade, sir.

137
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:29,793
That's right.

138
00:15:29,835 --> 00:15:32,087
Our very own general
of our very own corps...

139
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,798
has been promoted
to command of the whole army.

140
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,176
The latest, if you keep track of them
as they go by.

141
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:43,513
The message says they'll be arriving
this morning and they are to join us.

142
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:47,976
"And if they refuse to follow orders,
please feel free to shoot them."

143
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:50,520
- To shoot them?
- Yes, sir.

144
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:55,191
These Maine men?

145
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:05,951
"You are hereby authorized to shoot
any man who refuses to do his duty."

146
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,538
Are these all Maine men?

147
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:13,332
Yes, sir. And fine big fellows they are, too.

148
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:18,837
Mutiny. I thought that was
a word for the Navy.

149
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:25,802
We'll move at sunrise.

150
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,014
It's a good time of the day.

151
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,725
I always do enjoy this time,
just before the dawn.

152
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:38,689
When all this is over,
I shall miss it very much.

153
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,066
Sir?

154
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,777
I didn't mean the fighting.

155
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:50,074
It's all in God's hands now.

156
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:52,784
Good day, sir.

157
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:54,870
Good day to you.

158
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,049
General, sir.

159
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:12,219
Should I wake them up, sir? Should I
get them waked up and get going?

160
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:14,095
No, Moxley.

161
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:16,890
Let the boys sleep a little longer.
They'll need it.

162
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:19,058
Yes, sir.

163
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,794
Prisoners, mark file, left!

164
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:51,421
How many men do we have now
in the 20th Maine?

165
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:55,175
Somewhere around 250, sir,
counting the officers.

166
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:59,345
How the heck are we supposed
to take care of 120 men?

167
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,765
Colonel, it's going to be a hot day today.

168
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:06,810
Seeing as you already been down
with the heat, will you ride the horse...

169
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:11,607
that the good Lord provided,
instead of marching in the dirty dust?

170
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:13,233
You walked.

171
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:16,444
Darling, I've been in the infantry
since you was in books.

172
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:20,197
After the first few thousand miles,
a man gets limber with his feet.

173
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,575
Morning, Lawrence.

174
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:25,244
How are you?
You're looking kind of peaked.

175
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:28,080
Darn it, Tom. Don't call me Lawrence.

176
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:30,791
It doesn't make sense.

177
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:34,085
Hold a gun on a man to get him to fight.

178
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:44,010
Detail, about face.

179
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:47,973
Attention, detail!

180
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:51,184
You heard the Captain. Stand at attention!

181
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:54,604
Guards, get these men back on their feet!

182
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:06,030
I'm looking for commanding officer,
20th Maine.

183
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:07,157
You found him.

184
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:10,201
- That's him, all right.
- You're Chamberlain?

185
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:12,912
Colonel Chamberlain to you.

186
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:15,956
Captain Brewer, sir.

187
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,542
118th Pennsylvania.

188
00:19:18,918 --> 00:19:22,504
If you're the commanding officer,
I present you with these prisoners.

189
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:23,922
You're welcome to them.

190
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:27,633
Lord knows, I had to use the bayonet
to keep them moving.

191
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:31,762
You have to sign for them.

192
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,057
Sign it, Lieutenant.

193
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:47,068
You are relieved, Captain.

194
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:51,530
You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

195
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,908
You want to shoot them...

196
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:55,993
go right ahead.

197
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:58,578
Won't nobody say nothing.

198
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:06,294
I said you are relieved, Captain.

199
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:21,599
You men can leave now.
We won't be needing any guards.

200
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:32,609
My name is Chamberlain.
I'm the Colonel of the 20th Maine.

201
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:38,156
When did you have something to eat?

202
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:42,410
They're trying to break us
by not feeding us.

203
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:44,412
We ain't broke yet.

204
00:20:44,454 --> 00:20:47,748
They just told me you were coming
a little while ago.

205
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,291
I'll get the cook going.

206
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,793
The meat may be raw,
but there's no time to cook.

207
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:55,714
We've got quite a ways to go today.
You'll be coming with us, so eat hearty.

208
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,758
We'll set you up in those trees.
Sergeant Tozier, see to it.

209
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,885
Yes, sir.

210
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:08,767
You boys go eat, then I'll come over
and hear what you have to say.

211
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,567
Colonel, we've got grievances.

212
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:23,489
The men elected me to talk for them.

213
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,867
All right. You come along with me.

214
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:31,204
The rest of you boys go eat.
We're going to get moving in a little bit.

215
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:40,213
All right, men, on your feet.

216
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,965
- Gosh, Lawrence.
- Smile. Don't call me Lawrence.

217
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:45,634
- Are they moving?
- Yes, sir.

218
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:47,636
Forward, march.

219
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:50,138
What's your name?

220
00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:53,433
I don't feel too kindly, Colonel.

221
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,310
Yes, well, I'm usually not this informal.

222
00:21:56,353 --> 00:22:00,064
I just took command
of this regiment a few days ago.

223
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:04,193
Somebody ought to welcome you
to my... our outfit.

224
00:22:04,527 --> 00:22:08,864
They tell me they're holding you fellows
because you signed three-year papers.

225
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:11,825
I'm sorry. Would you like some coffee?

226
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:13,993
Are you sure?

227
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:19,206
- Go ahead. Sit down, Mister...
- Bucklin.

228
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:21,625
Joseph Bucklin.

229
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:26,546
Listen, Colonel.
I've been in 11 different engagements.

230
00:22:26,588 --> 00:22:29,131
How many have you been in?

231
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:32,385
Not that many.

232
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:34,553
It ain't the papers.

233
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:38,140
I've done my share. We all have.

234
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:42,018
They are damn good men.
Shouldn't be used this way.

235
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:46,189
Look here.

236
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:49,609
It went clean through.

237
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:53,070
We got a courier coming.

238
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,867
Listen, Colonel. I'm tired.

239
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:01,411
You know what I mean? I'm tired.

240
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:06,249
I've had all this army, all these officers...
This damn Hooker, this damn idiot Meade.

241
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:10,795
All of them. The whole bloody, lousy mess
of sick-brained, potbellied scareheads.

242
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:13,172
They ain't fit to lead a johnny detail.

243
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:17,968
They ain't fit to pour pee out of a boot
with instructions written under the heel.

244
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:20,929
I'm tired.

245
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:24,223
We're good men
and we had our own good flag.

246
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:28,602
These damn idiots used us
like we were cows or dogs or worse.

247
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:30,271
We aren't gonna win this war.

248
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:33,857
We can't win with these
lame-brained bastards from West Point.

249
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,235
These damn gentlemen! These officers!

250
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:40,822
The courier, sir.

251
00:23:43,992 --> 00:23:46,327
Don't go away.

252
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:49,455
Colonel Chamberlain, sir.

253
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:52,833
Colonel Vincent wishes to inform you
the Fifth Corps is moving out.

254
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,710
You and the 20th Maine Regiment
are instructed to lead.

255
00:23:55,753 --> 00:23:59,881
20th Maine's assigned first position in line.
Send out advanced guards and flankers.

256
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:02,425
- Flankers?
- Yes, flankers.

257
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:05,803
Right, yes.
My compliments to the Colonel.

258
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:08,472
Captain Clark, you heard him.
Get the regiment up.

259
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,391
Sound the assembly. Strike the tents.

260
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,853
You better get something to eat.
Looks like you could use it.

261
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:17,730
Tell your men I'm coming.

262
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:20,483
The boys from the Second Maine
are being fed, Lawrence.

263
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,860
Don't call me Lawrence.

264
00:24:22,902 --> 00:24:24,987
Damn it, Lawrence. I'm your brother.

265
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,698
Be careful about the name business
in front of the men.

266
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,075
Because we're brothers,
it looks like favoritism.

267
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:32,702
General Meade got his own son
as his aide-de-camp.

268
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:35,706
That's different. Generals can do anything.

269
00:24:35,747 --> 00:24:39,708
Nothing quite so much like God on earth
as a general on battlefield.

270
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:44,213
What are you going to do with them?
Colonel, sir.

271
00:24:44,255 --> 00:24:47,132
You can't shoot them.
You never go back to Maine if you do.

272
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:49,384
I know that.

273
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,512
I wonder if they do.

274
00:24:57,058 --> 00:24:59,560
Colonel, sir. You know who this man is?

275
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:02,271
Dan Burns, from Orono.
I know his daddy, the preacher.

276
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:03,897
Best cusser I ever heard.

277
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,651
Knows more fine swear words
than any man in Maine.

278
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:28,669
You men gather around.

279
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:45,768
I've been talking with Private Bucklin.
He's told me about your problem.

280
00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:48,480
There's nothing I can do today.

281
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:51,483
We're moving out in a few minutes.
We'll be moving all day.

282
00:25:51,524 --> 00:25:54,651
I've been ordered
to take you men with me.

283
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:57,112
I'm told that...

284
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:01,282
if you don't come, I can shoot you.

285
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:05,203
Well, you know I won't do that.

286
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:07,872
Maybe somebody else will, but I won't.

287
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,915
So, that's that.

288
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,960
Here's the situation.

289
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:17,006
The whole reb army is up that road
a ways waiting for us.

290
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:18,882
This is no time for an argument.

291
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:21,259
I tell you, we could surely use you fellows.

292
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:23,594
We're now well below half strength.

293
00:26:23,637 --> 00:26:27,390
Whether you fight or not, that's up to you.

294
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:31,936
Whether you come along is...
Well, you're coming.

295
00:26:32,395 --> 00:26:34,104
You know who we are, why we're here.

296
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:37,524
If you fight alongside us,
there's a few things you must know.

297
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:41,819
This regiment was formed
last summer in Maine.

298
00:26:42,738 --> 00:26:45,281
There were 1,000 of us then.

299
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:48,617
There are less than 300 of us now.

300
00:26:52,496 --> 00:26:56,708
All of us volunteered to fight
for the Union, just as you did.

301
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:01,755
Some came mainly because
we were bored at home.

302
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:05,341
Thought this looked like it might be fun.

303
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:09,220
Some came because
we were ashamed not to.

304
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:15,892
Many of us came
because it was the right thing to do.

305
00:27:18,895 --> 00:27:21,772
And all of us have seen men die.

306
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:25,484
This is a different kind of army.

307
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:28,820
If you look back through history,
you'll see men fighting for pay...

308
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:31,532
for women, for some other kind of loot.

309
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:34,660
They fight for land, power.

310
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:40,081
Because a king leads them,
or just because they like killing.

311
00:27:40,832 --> 00:27:43,167
We are here for something new.

312
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:47,546
This has not happened much
in the history of the world.

313
00:27:48,923 --> 00:27:52,759
We are an army out to set other men free.

314
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:57,889
America should be free ground.

315
00:27:58,723 --> 00:28:00,182
All of it.

316
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:03,311
Not divided by a line
between slave state and free.

317
00:28:03,352 --> 00:28:08,148
All the way from here to the Pacific Ocean.

318
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,902
No man has to bow.

319
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:15,821
No man born to royalty.

320
00:28:15,864 --> 00:28:20,493
Here we judge you by what you do,
not by who your father was.

321
00:28:21,911 --> 00:28:24,538
Here you can be something.

322
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:28,249
Here is the place to build a home.

323
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:33,087
But it's not the land.

324
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,423
There's always more land.

325
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:42,637
It's the idea that we all have value.

326
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,683
You and me.

327
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,232
What we're fighting for, in the end...

328
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:01,446
we're fighting for each other.

329
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,584
Sorry.

330
00:29:16,043 --> 00:29:18,628
I didn't mean to preach.

331
00:29:20,547 --> 00:29:22,632
You go ahead.

332
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:25,092
You talk for a while.

333
00:29:27,721 --> 00:29:32,266
If you choose to join us and want
your muskets back, you can have them.

334
00:29:32,308 --> 00:29:35,769
Nothing more will be said
by anybody, anywhere.

335
00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:39,856
If you choose not to join us,
you can come along under guard.

336
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:41,983
When this is over, I'll do what I can...

337
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:46,028
to see you get a fair treatment,
but for now, we're moving out.

338
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:53,744
Gentlemen.

339
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:57,414
I think if we lose this fight...

340
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,333
we lose the war.

341
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,965
So, if you choose to join us,
I'll be personally very grateful.

342
00:30:31,654 --> 00:30:33,614
Colonel, it's a fine morning.

343
00:30:33,655 --> 00:30:36,157
- Captain Spear, are we ready?
- Sir, that we are.

344
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:38,284
Then let's move out.

345
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:40,744
20th Maine!

346
00:30:40,787 --> 00:30:42,663
Forward!

347
00:30:43,498 --> 00:30:45,374
March!

348
00:32:47,193 --> 00:32:49,486
That's infantry, all right.

349
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:52,114
At least a whole brigade.

350
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:54,658
Any sign of cavalry?

351
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,451
Not a lick, sir.

352
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:58,369
That's strange.

353
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,830
Infantry moving alone
in enemy country, blind.

354
00:33:00,872 --> 00:33:03,165
Very strange, sir.

355
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,501
What do you make of that?

356
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:07,169
He's headed this way.

357
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:08,796
Sir?

358
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:10,839
Lee's turned. That's the main body.

359
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:13,050
You think so?

360
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:16,595
- I thought they were going to Harrisburg.
- He was.

361
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:20,015
That's too many troops
to be a raiding party.

362
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:21,725
There's power behind it.

363
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:26,186
Sir, if you want to fight here,
this is such lovely ground.

364
00:33:26,229 --> 00:33:28,522
It's the best damn ground I've seen all day.

365
00:33:28,564 --> 00:33:30,732
It is that.

366
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:37,822
We'll move both brigades into town.

367
00:33:37,864 --> 00:33:40,991
That'll make the good citizens happy.

368
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:44,537
Let's go down and have a look.

369
00:34:30,454 --> 00:34:35,208
- Soldier, your shirt needs mending.
- I thought the war was in Virginia.

370
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:39,336
What division are you boys with?

371
00:34:48,428 --> 00:34:50,346
Colonel, do you mind?

372
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,975
A good officer doesn't ride all day.
I've been sitting too long anyway.

373
00:34:54,017 --> 00:34:55,685
What do you think?

374
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,396
- What do you think?
- About what?

375
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:00,647
About the Second Maine boys, what else?

376
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,566
Are any of them going to join us?

377
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:05,026
Would you believe it? All but six!

378
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,153
What?

379
00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:09,614
I counted by actual vote.
114 voted to pick up the rifle.

380
00:35:09,656 --> 00:35:12,450
- Well, I'll be.
- You did good, brother, real good!

381
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:14,660
Good. See to it they march together.

382
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:17,537
Yes. Glazier's got the hardheads in tow.
There are six.

383
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,957
Get the names.
Put them in different companies.

384
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:22,292
I want them spread out,
not bunched together.

385
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:26,003
- I'll see about their muskets.
- Colonel, sir.

386
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:43,074
You know what's happening here
in the morning?

387
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:44,200
Sir?

388
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:47,578
The whole damn rebel army
is gonna be here.

389
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:50,914
They'll move through this town,
occupy the hills on the other side.

390
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:55,293
When our people arrive, Lee'll have
high ground. There'll be the devil to pay.

391
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:57,753
The high ground!

392
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:04,635
Meade will come in slowly, cautiously,
new to command.

393
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:08,305
They'll be on his back from Washington.

394
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:12,267
Wires hot with messages. Attack! Attack!

395
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:17,355
So he will set up a ring around these hills.

396
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:22,776
And when Lee's army is nicely entrenched
behind fat rocks on the high ground...

397
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:26,280
Meade will finally attack,
if he can coordinate the army.

398
00:37:26,322 --> 00:37:29,700
Straight up the hillside, out in the open...

399
00:37:29,742 --> 00:37:32,786
in that gorgeous field of fire.

400
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:39,708
We will charge valiantly
and be butchered valiantly.

401
00:37:43,796 --> 00:37:47,883
And afterward, men in tall hats and
gold watch fobs will thump their chest...

402
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:51,261
and say what a brave charge it was.

403
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,979
Devin, I've led a soldier's life...

404
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,233
and I've never seen anything
as brutally clear as this.

405
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:11,404
It's as if I can actually see the blue troops
in one long bloody moment...

406
00:38:11,446 --> 00:38:14,865
going up the long slope to the stony top...

407
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:18,536
as if it were already done...

408
00:38:18,578 --> 00:38:20,955
and already a memory.

409
00:38:20,996 --> 00:38:23,790
An odd, set...

410
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:27,168
stony quality to it.

411
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:33,132
As if tomorrow has already happened
and there's nothing you can do about it.

412
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:36,385
The way you sometimes feel
before an ill-considered attack...

413
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:38,512
knowing it will fail...

414
00:38:38,554 --> 00:38:41,264
but you cannot stop it.

415
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:45,143
You must even take part and help it fail.

416
00:38:49,731 --> 00:38:52,233
We have 2,500 men.

417
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:55,402
They'll be coming in force.

418
00:38:55,736 --> 00:39:00,281
There could be 20,000
coming down that road in the morning.

419
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,829
If we hold this ridge for a couple of hours,
we can keep them away.

420
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:09,832
We can block that road
until our main body gets here.

421
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:13,043
We can deprive the enemy
of the high ground!

422
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:16,129
The boys are ready for a brawl.
No doubt of that.

423
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:18,756
We'll force the reb to deploy.

424
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:21,551
That's a narrow road
they'll be coming down.

425
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:26,806
If we stack them up, it will take them a
while to get on track to get into position.

426
00:39:26,848 --> 00:39:28,849
Is Calef's battery up yet?

427
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:31,059
His six guns are deploying now.

428
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,854
How far back is Reynolds
with the main force?

429
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:36,857
About 10 miles, sir. Not much more.

430
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:50,035
Sir, you were right.

431
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:53,121
My scouts report the rebel army
is coming this way for sure.

432
00:39:53,163 --> 00:39:56,582
They're all concentrating in this direction.

433
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:08,426
We'll hold here in the morning.

434
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:12,055
Long enough for Reynolds
and the infantry to arrive.

435
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:14,682
If we hang on to the high ground,
we have a chance...

436
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:17,227
to win this fight that's coming.

437
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:20,104
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

438
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:24,274
Post the cannon along this road,
the Chambersburg Pike.

439
00:40:24,317 --> 00:40:28,529
The rebels will hit us at dawn.
I think we can hold them at least 2 hours.

440
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:31,365
Hell, General,
we can hold them all the livelong day.

441
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:32,865
He's right, sir.

442
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:35,368
At Thoroughfare Gap,
you held against Longstreet.

443
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,455
- You held for six hours.
- They never came. We held for nothing.

444
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:49,422
The rebs will hit us just about first light.

445
00:40:49,464 --> 00:40:51,966
Keep a clear eye.

446
00:40:52,175 --> 00:40:54,927
Have the pickets give us a good warning.

447
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:56,845
All right, gentlemen.

448
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,306
Let's get posted.

449
00:41:32,962 --> 00:41:36,214
General Reynolds,
my troops are deployed on good ground...

450
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:40,010
west of Gettysburg
on the Chambersburg Pike.

451
00:41:42,137 --> 00:41:44,806
I've sent reconnaissance parties
in every direction...

452
00:41:44,848 --> 00:41:47,475
from which the enemy
might be approaching.

453
00:41:47,517 --> 00:41:50,811
I'm satisfied A.P. Hill's corps
is massed just west of here...

454
00:41:50,854 --> 00:41:52,772
back of Cashtown.

455
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:56,650
The enemy's pickets
are within four miles of my position.

456
00:41:56,692 --> 00:42:00,779
Rumor says Ewell's coming
over the mountains from Carlisle.

457
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:08,744
If true, two Confederate corps
will converge upon us in the morning.

458
00:42:08,786 --> 00:42:11,204
One from the west and one from the north.

459
00:42:11,247 --> 00:42:14,458
Do you want me to hold
this position if attacked?

460
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,210
Confirmation requested.

461
00:42:17,711 --> 00:42:19,963
J.N.O. Buford.

462
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,361
"Bow down thy heaven, O Lord.

463
00:42:45,403 --> 00:42:49,990
"Come down and touch the mountains
and they shall smoke.

464
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:56,371
"Blessed be the Lord, my strength,
which teaches my fingers to fight...

465
00:42:56,413 --> 00:43:00,416
"and my hands to war. Amen."

466
00:43:02,085 --> 00:43:04,670
Good morning, Lucy.

467
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:08,423
Traveler, good morning to you, sir.

468
00:43:11,302 --> 00:43:12,761
Good morning, sir.

469
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:14,304
Good morning, Major Taylor.

470
00:43:14,346 --> 00:43:17,015
- Will the General have some breakfast?
- No, thank you.

471
00:43:17,057 --> 00:43:19,183
We have flapjacks in small mountains.

472
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:23,061
Fresh butter, bacon, wagons of ham,
apple butter, ripe cherries.

473
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:24,897
You really ought to pitch in, sir.

474
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:28,775
Courtesy of our host,
the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

475
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:42,287
Good morning, sir.

476
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,040
General Longstreet, good morning.

477
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,420
Federal forces are concentrating.

478
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:53,756
Yes, and I've confirmed
some of your man Harrison's information.

479
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:57,217
Their new commander
is definitely George Meade.

480
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,640
I have reports of Union cavalry
in Gettysburg.

481
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,266
Cavalry?

482
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,935
General Hill reports only militia.

483
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,853
He did?

484
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:11,021
Well, it's cavalry.

485
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:13,899
Where there's cavalry,
infantry will be close behind.

486
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,193
Meade's closing fast.

487
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,904
It could be he's thinking
of swinging round behind us.

488
00:44:17,945 --> 00:44:22,032
Behind, in front: Direction does not matter.
We'll fight him wherever he is.

489
00:44:22,074 --> 00:44:25,994
Probably got old Abe Lincoln on his back
frantic to throw us out of Pennsylvania.

490
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:28,413
We may have an opportunity here.

491
00:44:28,455 --> 00:44:30,331
I agree.

492
00:44:30,373 --> 00:44:34,001
Our objective was to get their army
out of Virginia and into the open.

493
00:44:34,043 --> 00:44:36,044
Now they are in the open.

494
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:38,630
General Meade has been forcing
the march.

495
00:44:38,673 --> 00:44:40,507
The weather has been unusually hot.

496
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:44,677
He will probably arrive here worn out
and weary, piece by piece.

497
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,681
If we concentrate,
we can hit him as he comes up.

498
00:44:47,722 --> 00:44:50,683
If we can take out a few of his corps,
we can even the odds.

499
00:44:50,725 --> 00:44:54,520
But we must strike hard
and we must strike quickly.

500
00:44:55,104 --> 00:44:57,105
What artillery is that, Major?

501
00:44:57,148 --> 00:44:58,691
I don't know, sir.

502
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:00,400
General Heth is in front.

503
00:45:00,442 --> 00:45:03,861
- My instructions were clear?
- Yes, sir. To all commanders.

504
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:07,073
Avoid contact with the enemy
until the army's up and concentrated.

505
00:45:07,115 --> 00:45:08,282
And General Heth?

506
00:45:08,324 --> 00:45:10,617
He has instructions
not to force major action.

507
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,077
I told him this morning.

508
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,997
We should move closer to the front.
Send for General Heth.

509
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,208
- I must know what is going on.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:20,752
General...

511
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:25,340
in the fight that is coming,
I want you to stay back from the main line.

512
00:45:25,382 --> 00:45:28,384
This army has lost too many
of its veteran commanders...

513
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:32,888
and you, sir, have a very bad habit
of moving too far forward.

514
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,141
Can't lead from behind.

515
00:45:37,184 --> 00:45:39,227
May I say it plainly, sir.

516
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,771
I cannot afford to lose you.

517
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:47,026
Now, General, let's look to this day.
You may bring up your corps.

518
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:56,868
Major Taylor, have Traveler saddled up.

519
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,329
- I'm going to look around for myself.
- Yes, sir.

520
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:18,067
They've got a brigade in position
and that's all.

521
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:22,988
We've got the best damn ground around,
and they're hitting me with one brigade.

522
00:47:23,155 --> 00:47:25,698
Lovely.

523
00:47:36,793 --> 00:47:39,378
Go on down, gentlemen.

524
00:47:55,268 --> 00:47:57,311
Fall back!

525
00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:03,900
They are on the run.

526
00:48:13,951 --> 00:48:15,202
Close crop, General.

527
00:48:15,244 --> 00:48:17,704
- How are your losses?
- Not bad at all, sir.

528
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:20,415
We got them out in the open.
Really got a twist on them.

529
00:48:20,457 --> 00:48:24,043
They are arrogant people, you know?
They came right at us.

530
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:27,629
We took some prisoners.
They're from Heth's division of Hill's corps.

531
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,632
That's what I've got in front of me.

532
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:32,843
A new division. 8,000 men more or less.
All within sound of this.

533
00:48:32,885 --> 00:48:36,680
Just back up that road between here
and Cashtown. A little ways up the road.

534
00:48:36,722 --> 00:48:39,057
It'll take them a little while to get on line.

535
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:42,560
Yes, sir, but Hill's whole corps is behind.
Maybe 25,000.

536
00:48:42,602 --> 00:48:45,312
Longstreet behind that.
Ewell over there to the north.

537
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:46,731
I know, Colonel.

538
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:50,651
When John Reynolds gets here,
he won't have the full army with him.

539
00:48:50,693 --> 00:48:51,860
Only part of it.

540
00:48:51,902 --> 00:48:54,821
The point is, the rebs will be here
this afternoon...

541
00:48:54,863 --> 00:48:58,741
with everything they've got.
I just thought I'd mention it.

542
00:48:58,784 --> 00:49:01,745
What do you want me to do here, sir?

543
00:49:01,786 --> 00:49:03,746
Heth will be back in a bit.

544
00:49:03,788 --> 00:49:06,582
If he's got any brains at all,
and he's not stupid...

545
00:49:06,624 --> 00:49:09,793
he'll know by now he's got at least
a brigade in front of him.

546
00:49:09,835 --> 00:49:12,128
He won't wait
to get his whole division in line.

547
00:49:12,171 --> 00:49:13,964
That would take half the morning.

548
00:49:14,006 --> 00:49:16,633
He don't need his whole division.

549
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:19,469
That's right.

550
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:22,805
Does Devin report any activity on his front
over to the right?

551
00:49:22,847 --> 00:49:25,432
- No, sir. Not a lick.
- All right.

552
00:49:25,475 --> 00:49:28,269
I'll have Devin leave his cover
and withdraw his boys...

553
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:32,188
and have them move in alongside you,
lengthening your line.

554
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:35,608
When Heth gets back,
he'll run into two brigades.

555
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:38,235
That ought to hold him
until Reynolds gets here.

556
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:40,154
Right, sir.

557
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:47,827
Damn sure glad the rain is gone.
Don't want anything to slow up Reynolds.

558
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:54,918
Take care of yourself, Colonel.

559
00:49:55,043 --> 00:49:58,379
Don't worry about me, sir.
I'm the soul of caution.

560
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:54,013
Fire!

561
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:59,517
Move! Fall back!

562
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,937
That flank... Hold it!

563
00:51:54,443 --> 00:51:56,569
Keep up your fire!

564
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:07,621
Gamble's down, sir.

565
00:52:07,663 --> 00:52:10,874
Colonel Gamble, but he's not hurt bad, sir.

566
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:19,757
I'm all right.

567
00:52:21,468 --> 00:52:23,845
It was close, that's all.

568
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:35,980
Sir, Colonel Devin's compliments.
No problem on the right.

569
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:38,733
They came up close,
but we put in the reserve.

570
00:52:38,775 --> 00:52:40,443
We didn't put it all in, sir.

571
00:52:40,485 --> 00:52:42,653
Wishes to know if you have further orders.

572
00:52:42,695 --> 00:52:45,822
Tell Devin all reserve forward, now.

573
00:52:56,041 --> 00:52:58,042
Keep up your fire!

574
00:53:00,628 --> 00:53:02,504
Fire!

575
00:53:03,673 --> 00:53:05,549
Fire!

576
00:54:01,058 --> 00:54:03,435
Sir, it's General Reynolds.

577
00:54:16,822 --> 00:54:18,698
Thank God.

578
00:54:27,582 --> 00:54:29,083
What goes, John?

579
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,959
There's the devil to pay!

580
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:34,129
- Can you hold?
- I reckon I can.

581
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:47,975
Heth probably has about 10,000 men
coming down that road, wouldn't you say?

582
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:50,227
Yes, sir. But there'll be more behind him.

583
00:54:50,269 --> 00:54:54,439
We can put almost 20,000 in the field.
We're in very good shape, I think.

584
00:54:54,482 --> 00:54:56,108
For a while, sir.

585
00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:00,904
I'm sending messages to all commanders
to come here with all possible speed.

586
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,826
It's lovely ground.

587
00:55:09,162 --> 00:55:11,664
I thought so, sir.

588
00:55:13,165 --> 00:55:16,126
Now let's go surprise Harry Heth.

589
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:31,306
Come on.

590
00:55:36,395 --> 00:55:38,897
- General Heth.
- Sir. I beg to report.

591
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:40,356
Yes.

592
00:55:40,398 --> 00:55:42,900
Very strange, sir.
The situation is very confused.

593
00:55:42,942 --> 00:55:44,026
What happened?

594
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:46,987
I moved in this morning, as directed.

595
00:55:47,029 --> 00:55:51,157
I thought it was only a few militia,
but it was dismounted cavalry, sir.

596
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,327
There weren't all that many,
and the boys wouldn't hold back.

597
00:55:54,369 --> 00:55:57,496
I thought we shouldn't be stopped
by a few dismounted cavalry...

598
00:55:57,539 --> 00:55:59,082
but they made a good fight.

599
00:55:59,124 --> 00:56:02,043
They really put up a scrap, sir.

600
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,586
Go on, General.

601
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:05,921
Well, sir, they wouldn't leave.

602
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,797
My boys got their dander up.

603
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,342
We deployed the whole division
and went after them.

604
00:56:10,384 --> 00:56:13,136
We just about had them running
then all of a sudden...

605
00:56:13,178 --> 00:56:14,846
they got infantry support.

606
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:16,347
We got pushed back.

607
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:21,351
Then we re-formed and tried again.
We couldn't just leave it to them, sir.

608
00:56:21,394 --> 00:56:24,855
Now there's more Yankee infantry coming.
I don't know how many.

609
00:56:24,897 --> 00:56:27,065
But I don't know
what else we could've done.

610
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:29,484
It started as a minor scrap
with a few militia.

611
00:56:29,526 --> 00:56:33,404
The next thing I know,
I'm tangling with half the Union army.

612
00:56:33,738 --> 00:56:37,616
Things will get out of control, Mr. Heth.
That is why we have orders.

613
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:40,828
- Is it possible you misunderstood them?
- No, sir.

614
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,246
Can you identify those people?

615
00:56:42,288 --> 00:56:44,790
The infantry is the First Corps,
the Black Hats.

616
00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:47,751
There's another corps coming
that we haven't identified.

617
00:56:47,793 --> 00:56:50,545
I must have all possible information
on enemy strength.

618
00:56:50,587 --> 00:56:54,715
Major Taylor, I want you to ride forward
to the highest position and observe.

619
00:56:54,757 --> 00:56:56,675
- And do be careful.
- Yes, sir.

620
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:58,760
- Sir, shall I attack?
- No, sir.

621
00:56:58,803 --> 00:57:00,763
We are not ready for full engagement.

622
00:57:00,805 --> 00:57:02,848
General Longstreet is not up
with his corps.

623
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,891
Sir, the enemy is disorganized.

624
00:57:04,933 --> 00:57:09,145
If we throw all our forces in the field,
we will have the advantage.

625
00:57:09,604 --> 00:57:11,480
Is that our artillery?

626
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:12,815
Yes, sir.

627
00:57:12,857 --> 00:57:15,275
I can't imagine what has happened
to General Stuart.

628
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:17,736
- I've heard nothing. Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

629
00:57:17,778 --> 00:57:22,699
I have no idea of what lies in front of me.
It may be the entire federal army.

630
00:57:43,135 --> 00:57:45,929
Sir, compliments of Colonel Babbit.

631
00:57:45,971 --> 00:57:49,140
Rebels are coming from the north.
Your instructions, sir?

632
00:57:49,182 --> 00:57:51,934
That'll be Ewell's corps.
They're trying to flank us.

633
00:57:51,976 --> 00:57:54,895
We got to meet them
and force them to go on line.

634
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:57,939
Tell Colonel Devin to get up that way
as quick as he can.

635
00:57:57,981 --> 00:58:02,234
We'll get Gamble's boys back in the saddle
and be there shortly.

636
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:26,632
General Rodes has encountered
Yankee cavalry, sir.

637
00:58:26,674 --> 00:58:28,175
Buford's brigades.

638
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:32,679
General Early's right behind him
and will be on the field within the hour.

639
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:39,769
General Early may be attacked
by half the federal army within the hour.

640
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:42,813
- Is that Pender's artillery?
- Yes, sir. He's up now, sir.

641
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:46,651
Four batteries in position
with two more in reserve.

642
00:58:46,692 --> 00:58:51,196
With General Rodes attacking up there
and Pender and I, we have three divisions.

643
00:58:51,238 --> 00:58:53,198
We could sweep them.

644
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,324
General, sir.

645
00:58:54,366 --> 00:58:57,285
I saw only two federal corps.
First and Eleventh.

646
00:58:57,327 --> 00:59:01,705
And, General, I saw Early's lead columns
coming down north of Rodes' lines.

647
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:03,666
He'll be engaged any minute, sir.

648
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:08,045
Sir, we got 20,000 infantry coming down
almost behind the Union lines.

649
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:10,339
It's perfect, sir.

650
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:12,507
God's will.

651
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:17,053
Gentlemen, it would appear
the fight is already underway.

652
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,055
General Heth, you may attack, sir.

653
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:22,183
My orders to all commanders: Attack.

654
00:59:52,752 --> 00:59:54,628
Fire!

655
01:00:43,465 --> 01:00:47,134
Forward men, final brigade forward!

656
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,445
Forward! For God's sake, forward!

657
01:01:36,013 --> 01:01:37,973
He's dead.

658
01:01:56,323 --> 01:02:00,910
One thing about this brigade
is we got our own special bugle call.

659
01:02:00,952 --> 01:02:02,912
Ever hear tell of Dan Butterfield?

660
01:02:02,954 --> 01:02:05,331
What, General Butterfield?
What was with Hooker?

661
01:02:05,373 --> 01:02:07,333
That's the same fellow.

662
01:02:07,374 --> 01:02:10,501
- He used to be our brigade commander.
- Yeah, he was a pistol.

663
01:02:10,544 --> 01:02:14,464
- No man like him for having a good time.
- I don't know about that.

664
01:02:14,506 --> 01:02:17,300
But I know he used to like
to write bugle calls.

665
01:02:17,342 --> 01:02:19,927
The problem with this army is,
we got too many calls.

666
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:24,347
We got a call for artillery, infantry,
get up and eat, retreat.

667
01:02:24,515 --> 01:02:28,518
Anyway, old Butterfield, he wrote
a special call for this here brigade.

668
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,187
Say there is an order for this brigade,
you and me.

669
01:02:31,229 --> 01:02:35,357
He'll be blowing his bugle, we will think
that order's for us when it wasn't.

670
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,236
We'll follow that order anyway,
then we'll be in a world of hurt.

671
01:02:39,278 --> 01:02:41,696
Yeah, that happened to me once.
Us, that is.

672
01:02:41,739 --> 01:02:44,366
Half the regiment charged,
the other half retreated.

673
01:02:44,408 --> 01:02:46,701
You had your choice.

674
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:49,203
This here brigade got a special call.

675
01:02:49,246 --> 01:02:52,415
You hear that call,
you know the next one is for you.

676
01:02:52,457 --> 01:02:54,625
It goes like this.

677
01:02:56,919 --> 01:02:58,712
Colonel, sir.

678
01:02:58,754 --> 01:03:01,047
Begging the Colonel's pardon.

679
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:05,844
But would the Colonel please do us a favor
and get back on the damned horse?

680
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:09,889
I'll tell you, sir,
it's not easy handling these new recruits...

681
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:14,101
when the officers act
like they ain't got any sense, sir.

682
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:17,771
Lawrence, sir.

683
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:21,024
We've gone over 20 miles today.

684
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:24,318
We've gone over 100 miles
in five days, sir.

685
01:03:26,363 --> 01:03:29,032
There's something going on.

686
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:37,581
- Colonel Vincent, sir.
- Mister Chamberlain.

687
01:03:37,623 --> 01:03:39,833
Far cry from Bowdoin College,
wouldn't you say?

688
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:41,876
No farther than Harvard Yard.

689
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:46,297
Indeed. With luck, we'll both see
our alma maters again.

690
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:50,050
In the meantime, Colonel, you move
your boys along as best you can.

691
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:52,386
Two corps have engaged at Gettysburg.

692
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:55,347
So we'll keep going through dark
and on until we get there.

693
01:03:55,389 --> 01:03:56,473
Yes, sir.

694
01:03:56,515 --> 01:03:58,391
Godspeed.

695
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:18,785
Fire!

696
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:12,959
They're running!

697
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:22,217
General Pender begs to report
that the enemy is falling back.

698
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,262
- They're on the run.
- Very well, Lieutenant.

699
01:05:27,097 --> 01:05:31,309
General Early says the enemy has caved in
on the left flank, going back to Gettysburg.

700
01:05:31,351 --> 01:05:34,687
- They're all running.
- Very well. Thank you, Corporal.

701
01:05:34,729 --> 01:05:36,772
Find General Hill's chief of artillery.

702
01:05:36,815 --> 01:05:40,067
Tell him I want fire placed on that hill.
As much fire as possible.

703
01:05:40,109 --> 01:05:42,569
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

704
01:05:47,241 --> 01:05:48,825
- Major Taylor.
- Yes, sir.

705
01:05:48,867 --> 01:05:50,618
Deliver this message in person.

706
01:05:50,661 --> 01:05:54,247
Tell General Ewell the federal troops
are withdrawing in confusion.

707
01:05:54,289 --> 01:05:57,917
We must only push those people
in order to gain the heights.

708
01:05:57,959 --> 01:06:01,253
Tell him to take that hill, if practical.
The one beyond the town.

709
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:02,462
Do you understand?

710
01:06:02,505 --> 01:06:05,090
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

711
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:17,101
Congratulations, General.

712
01:06:17,143 --> 01:06:18,519
I want you to see this.

713
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:20,646
It's like second Manassas all over again.

714
01:06:20,688 --> 01:06:23,065
Couldn't have worked better
if we'd planned it.

715
01:06:23,107 --> 01:06:26,902
If we can take that hill,
I want it occupied by nightfall.

716
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:30,237
Sir, the federal army has fallen back
through Gettysburg.

717
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,698
They're reforming on the ridges
outside of town.

718
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:34,658
Very well.

719
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:38,036
This is almost perfect.
We got them where we want them.

720
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,956
Let's move south and east,
get between them and Lincoln...

721
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:42,457
find some high ground...

722
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,292
and they'll have to hit us.

723
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,460
Then we have them, General.

724
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,463
You mean disengage?

725
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,631
I've always been under the impression...

726
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,509
that it was our strategy to conduct
a defensive campaign wherever possible...

727
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,470
in order to keep the army intact.

728
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,181
Granted, but the situation has changed.

729
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,516
- In what way?
- We've already pushed them back.

730
01:07:01,558 --> 01:07:03,768
They're on the run, vacating the town.

731
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:07,021
How can we move off
in the face of the enemy?

732
01:07:07,063 --> 01:07:09,023
- Major Marshall?
- Yes, sir.

733
01:07:09,065 --> 01:07:11,900
I ordered firing on that hill,
but no cannons are firing.

734
01:07:11,943 --> 01:07:14,445
- Send over and find out why.
- I'll see to it, sir.

735
01:07:14,487 --> 01:07:16,363
Thank you.

736
01:07:19,866 --> 01:07:22,535
What are you thinking, General?

737
01:07:24,204 --> 01:07:26,414
Maybe we should not have fought here.

738
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:29,834
I know that. But we have prevailed.
The men have prevailed.

739
01:07:29,876 --> 01:07:31,502
Yes. They've always done that.

740
01:07:31,544 --> 01:07:34,421
But in the morning,
we may be outnumbered...

741
01:07:34,463 --> 01:07:37,966
and they'll be entrenched
on the high ground.

742
01:07:38,008 --> 01:07:41,594
You know as well as I, we've never been
concerned with being outnumbered.

743
01:07:41,636 --> 01:07:43,637
That is true, sir. You are right.

744
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,557
If we move south to Washington,
they have to pursue us.

745
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:49,017
Then we can fight on ground
of our choosing.

746
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,978
But the enemy is here.

747
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,605
We did not want the fight,
but the fight is here.

748
01:07:53,647 --> 01:07:58,067
How can I ask this army to retreat
in the face of what they've done this day?

749
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,945
Not retreat, sir. Re-deploy.

750
01:08:00,987 --> 01:08:04,907
Our guns will move them off that hill
or Ewell will push them off.

751
01:08:04,949 --> 01:08:07,868
But if Meade is there tomorrow,
I can't move this army away.

752
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:09,119
I will attack him.

753
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:12,914
If Meade is up there tomorrow,
it is because he wants us to attack him.

754
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:16,751
We pushed back two corps,
but there are five more coming.

755
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:24,049
General, I will bring up my boys
as soon as I can.

756
01:08:24,091 --> 01:08:25,884
Very well.

757
01:08:25,926 --> 01:08:27,594
- General?
- Sir?

758
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:30,513
Your man Harrison, the actor,
he was quite correct.

759
01:08:30,556 --> 01:08:34,726
Had it not been for him, this entire army
might have been destroyed in detail.

760
01:08:34,768 --> 01:08:38,229
The federal force might've been here
waiting when we turned around.

761
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,981
I'm deeply grateful to you, sir.

762
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:15,846
Hello, men.

763
01:09:16,639 --> 01:09:18,891
What outfit are you with?

764
01:09:18,933 --> 01:09:21,435
Archer's brigade, Heth's division.

765
01:09:21,477 --> 01:09:23,895
- Where are you from?
- Tennessee.

766
01:09:23,937 --> 01:09:25,229
How about you?

767
01:09:25,272 --> 01:09:27,148
Maine.

768
01:09:27,274 --> 01:09:28,942
I've never been to Tennessee.

769
01:09:28,984 --> 01:09:31,819
I reckon I've never been to Maine neither.

770
01:09:33,154 --> 01:09:36,532
I don't mean no disrespect
to you fighting men...

771
01:09:36,949 --> 01:09:41,619
but sometimes I can't help but figure,
why are you fighting this war?

772
01:09:41,662 --> 01:09:43,371
Why are you fighting it?

773
01:09:43,413 --> 01:09:47,666
To free the slaves, of course.
And to preserve the Union.

774
01:09:47,709 --> 01:09:51,962
I don't know about other folk,
but I ain't fighting for no darkies.

775
01:09:52,005 --> 01:09:53,756
I'm fighting for my rights.

776
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:55,632
That's what we're all fighting for.

777
01:09:55,675 --> 01:09:56,801
For your what?

778
01:09:56,842 --> 01:09:58,718
For our rights.

779
01:10:00,012 --> 01:10:03,056
Why is it you folks can't just live
the way you want to live...

780
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:05,683
and let us live the way we do?

781
01:10:06,017 --> 01:10:09,269
"Live and let live," I hear some folks say.

782
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:14,650
Be a mite less fuss and bother
if more folks took it to heart.

783
01:10:16,485 --> 01:10:18,319
Where'd you get captured?

784
01:10:18,362 --> 01:10:20,864
Railroad cut just west of Gettysburg town.

785
01:10:20,906 --> 01:10:23,366
It wasn't a pretty sight.

786
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:27,786
Many a good boy lost
a young and promising life.

787
01:10:28,871 --> 01:10:31,373
Some wore blue, some wore gray.

788
01:10:34,126 --> 01:10:36,586
Seen enough of this war?

789
01:10:37,212 --> 01:10:39,380
I guess I have.

790
01:10:39,756 --> 01:10:41,924
I guess I have, too.

791
01:10:42,384 --> 01:10:45,678
It looks like I'll be sitting out the rest of it.

792
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:51,183
I appreciate you talking to me.

793
01:10:51,475 --> 01:10:53,852
See you in hell, Billy Yank.

794
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:57,271
See you in hell, Johnny Reb.

795
01:11:05,988 --> 01:11:08,114
I have found a John Henry, sir.

796
01:11:08,157 --> 01:11:09,241
John who?

797
01:11:09,283 --> 01:11:13,453
A John Henry, sir. A runaway.
I heard him a-groaning.

798
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:27,757
Is he wounded?

799
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,093
Don't know for sure.

800
01:11:35,849 --> 01:11:37,475
The man's exhausted.

801
01:11:37,517 --> 01:11:41,312
We'll get him something to eat.
The surgeon's on the way.

802
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:45,482
- Did you get his name?
- He said something I couldn't understand.

803
01:11:45,524 --> 01:11:48,151
I can't understand anyone
south of Mason-Dixon.

804
01:11:48,193 --> 01:11:50,361
Rebs or darkies.

805
01:12:00,413 --> 01:12:04,041
All right, men, as you were.
Surgeon, see to him.

806
01:12:14,509 --> 01:12:17,178
We used to have visitors from the South
before the war.

807
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:21,265
They were always very polite, academic,
you understand.

808
01:12:21,891 --> 01:12:25,560
We stayed off the question of slavery
out of courtesy.

809
01:12:25,602 --> 01:12:28,604
But toward the end there was
no getting away from it...

810
01:12:28,647 --> 01:12:33,025
and yet I could never understand.
I don't now.

811
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:35,653
I don't know why.

812
01:12:37,738 --> 01:12:40,115
They fight so well.

813
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:49,874
Tell me something, Buster...

814
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,252
what do you think of Negroes?

815
01:12:55,254 --> 01:12:57,839
Well, if you mean the race...

816
01:12:58,883 --> 01:13:01,051
I don't really know.

817
01:13:01,218 --> 01:13:03,636
This is not a thing to be ashamed of.

818
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:08,516
The thing is, you cannot judge a race.

819
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,144
Any man who judges by the group
is a pea-wit.

820
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:15,523
You take men one at a time.

821
01:13:15,564 --> 01:13:18,483
To me, there was never any difference.

822
01:13:18,525 --> 01:13:20,485
- None at all?
- None at all.

823
01:13:20,527 --> 01:13:23,070
Of course, I haven't known
that many freed men...

824
01:13:23,113 --> 01:13:26,699
but those I knew in Bangor, Portland...

825
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:30,744
you look in the eye, there was a man.

826
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:34,414
There was a "divine spark,"
as my mother used to call it.

827
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:36,417
That is all there is to it.

828
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:38,751
Races are men.

829
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:42,421
"What a piece of work is man.

830
01:13:42,464 --> 01:13:46,300
"How infinite in faculties,
in form and moving...

831
01:13:46,551 --> 01:13:48,969
"how express and admirable.

832
01:13:50,638 --> 01:13:53,223
"In action, how like an angel."

833
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:59,354
Well, if he's an angel, all right then...

834
01:14:00,313 --> 01:14:03,607
but he damn well must be a killer angel.

835
01:14:07,987 --> 01:14:12,115
Colonel, darling, you're a lovely man.

836
01:14:12,283 --> 01:14:17,370
I see a great vast difference between us,
yet I admire you, lad.

837
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:21,791
You're an idealist, praise be.

838
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:25,419
The truth is, Colonel...

839
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,923
there is no "divine spark."

840
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:34,594
There's many a man alive no more of value
than a dead dog. Believe me.

841
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:39,348
When you've seen them hang each other
the way I have back in the Old Country.

842
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,809
Equality?

843
01:14:41,851 --> 01:14:46,813
What I'm fighting for is the right to prove
I'm a better man than many of them.

844
01:14:46,856 --> 01:14:52,110
Where have you seen this "divine spark"
in operation, Colonel?

845
01:14:52,778 --> 01:14:56,698
Where have you noted
this magnificent equality?

846
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:00,659
No two things on earth are equal
or have an equal chance.

847
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:03,411
Not a leaf, not a tree.

848
01:15:04,622 --> 01:15:08,208
There's many a man worse than me
and some better...

849
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,545
but I don't think race or country
matters a damn.

850
01:15:13,588 --> 01:15:16,090
What matters, Colonel...

851
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:20,302
is justice.

852
01:15:25,766 --> 01:15:28,226
Which is why I'm here.

853
01:15:28,769 --> 01:15:31,813
I'll be treated as I deserve...

854
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,524
not as my father deserved.

855
01:15:37,193 --> 01:15:39,278
I'm Kilrain...

856
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,906
and I damn all gentlemen.

857
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:49,412
There is only one aristocracy...

858
01:15:50,413 --> 01:15:53,999
and that is right here.

859
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,009
And that's why we've got to win this war.

860
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:19,606
Howdy.

861
01:16:19,815 --> 01:16:22,150
Howdy, General.

862
01:16:22,526 --> 01:16:25,737
Hello, my boys. Virginia has arrived!

863
01:16:34,745 --> 01:16:36,955
General Pickett presents
his compliments...

864
01:16:36,997 --> 01:16:41,375
and asks to "parler" with
the commanding general, "s'il vous plaît".

865
01:16:41,418 --> 01:16:43,503
Hey, George.

866
01:16:44,045 --> 01:16:46,005
General.

867
01:16:50,718 --> 01:16:52,719
Good Lord, what is that smell?

868
01:16:52,762 --> 01:16:55,556
That's me. Ain't it lovely?

869
01:16:55,597 --> 01:16:57,473
He got it off a dead Frenchman.

870
01:16:57,516 --> 01:16:59,559
- Good evening to you, James.
- Hey, Lo.

871
01:16:59,601 --> 01:17:02,228
I did not get it off a dead Frenchman.

872
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,647
I bought it in a store
in Richmond with Sally.

873
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:08,859
It did have a French name,
but Miss Corbert likes it.

874
01:17:09,151 --> 01:17:10,235
Excuse me.

875
01:17:10,277 --> 01:17:13,613
Gentlemen? Colonel Fremantle?

876
01:17:14,198 --> 01:17:16,825
Allow me to introduce
Major General George Pickett.

877
01:17:16,867 --> 01:17:19,619
General Pickett,
Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Fremantle...

878
01:17:19,661 --> 01:17:23,497
of Her Majesty's venerable
and elite Cold Stream Guards...

879
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:26,082
Britain's military attach"é"
to the Confederacy...

880
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:29,753
and, you might say,
the eyes and ears of Queen Victoria.

881
01:17:29,795 --> 01:17:34,132
Hardly, sir. I'm merely an observer
and your humble guest.

882
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:39,887
The fame of your regiment
has preceded you.

883
01:17:39,929 --> 01:17:43,640
General Pickett here
is our ranking strategist.

884
01:17:43,891 --> 01:17:48,645
The First Corps Army of Northern Virginia.
We refer all our deeper questions to him.

885
01:17:48,687 --> 01:17:50,605
They do. They do indeed.

886
01:17:50,647 --> 01:17:54,108
His record at West Point
is still the talk of both armies.

887
01:17:54,151 --> 01:17:58,404
You know I consider it unbecoming
to a soldier, all this book learning.

888
01:17:58,446 --> 01:18:02,366
- Book learning ain't for gentlemen, right?
- Nor that either.

889
01:18:02,575 --> 01:18:05,577
He graduated last in his class. Dead last.

890
01:18:05,619 --> 01:18:08,580
Quite a feat, considering his classmates.

891
01:18:10,249 --> 01:18:14,669
The Yankees got all the smart ones.
Look where it's got them.

892
01:18:16,337 --> 01:18:17,963
Let me present my commanders.

893
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:22,051
Each one of these chaps, as you might say,
commands a brigade of mine.

894
01:18:22,093 --> 01:18:24,636
Now this fellow here, this is Lo Armistead.

895
01:18:24,678 --> 01:18:27,555
Lo! That's short for Lothario.

896
01:18:27,598 --> 01:18:29,182
The lover!

897
01:18:29,224 --> 01:18:32,351
This here is Richard Brooke Garnett.
You'll pardon his limp.

898
01:18:32,394 --> 01:18:34,812
He got kicked by his horse the other day.

899
01:18:34,854 --> 01:18:36,730
That fellow there...

900
01:18:36,773 --> 01:18:38,607
That's Jim Kemper.

901
01:18:38,649 --> 01:18:41,484
You note the shifty eye,
the hand in the pocket.

902
01:18:41,527 --> 01:18:43,737
He's not even a West Pointer,
so watch him.

903
01:18:43,779 --> 01:18:47,240
He's a politician from Virginia.
Jimmy's only here for the votes.

904
01:18:47,282 --> 01:18:49,408
I was Speaker of the House in Virginia.

905
01:18:49,451 --> 01:18:53,788
As a matter of fact, I'd like to talk to you
about some political matters.

906
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:55,790
You know the Queen, don't you?

907
01:18:55,832 --> 01:18:59,418
What I need to know
and tell my folks back home is:

908
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,420
When are you going to do something...

909
01:19:01,462 --> 01:19:04,297
about that damn Yankee blockade
out there on the water?

910
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:06,465
Can you tell me something about that?

911
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:10,344
Have you heard any news of old Winfield?

912
01:19:10,386 --> 01:19:12,554
Old Winnie boy?

913
01:19:12,597 --> 01:19:15,307
Hancock? Oh, yeah.

914
01:19:16,309 --> 01:19:18,602
Well, how's he doing?

915
01:19:18,644 --> 01:19:21,187
You're going to find out.

916
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:26,817
He's got the Second Corps.

917
01:19:27,277 --> 01:19:31,238
He's headed this way. Probably run
into him in the next few days.

918
01:19:35,326 --> 01:19:37,953
I wish I could see him again.

919
01:19:38,537 --> 01:19:41,706
I haven't seen him since before the war.

920
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:46,419
Never thought it would last this long.

921
01:19:46,503 --> 01:19:48,713
Me neither, Lo.

922
01:19:48,755 --> 01:19:52,049
I sure would like to talk
to old Hancock again.

923
01:19:52,425 --> 01:19:54,635
One more time.

924
01:19:58,388 --> 01:20:00,306
Well, why not?

925
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:03,101
You wouldn't mind?

926
01:20:03,143 --> 01:20:05,019
Hell, no.

927
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,980
I mean, really.

928
01:20:08,022 --> 01:20:12,984
Do you think it would be proper?
You know, ethical?

929
01:20:13,694 --> 01:20:16,196
When the time comes, and he's close...

930
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:20,241
just send a messenger over
under a flag of truce and go on over.

931
01:20:20,283 --> 01:20:22,451
Ain't nothing to it.

932
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:26,205
Last time I saw him was in California.

933
01:20:26,664 --> 01:20:29,249
Right when the war was beginning...

934
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:33,294
the night before we all left
to go fight against each other.

935
01:20:34,046 --> 01:20:36,881
Old friends off to war.

936
01:20:41,511 --> 01:20:43,554
How's your brigade?

937
01:20:44,138 --> 01:20:48,016
I've never seen troops anywhere
so ready for a brawl.

938
01:20:48,934 --> 01:20:52,478
I've got to give the old man credit.
A lot of credit for that.

939
01:20:52,521 --> 01:20:56,566
Who else could've held
this army together for so long?

940
01:20:57,567 --> 01:21:00,361
Remember what they used to say
about him?

941
01:21:00,403 --> 01:21:05,407
When he first took command?
They called him "Old Granny."

942
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:10,495
Lord, what damn fools we were.

943
01:21:11,163 --> 01:21:14,249
Now when he passes...

944
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:18,753
the boys hush as if they had seen
an angel of the Lord.

945
01:21:20,505 --> 01:21:23,674
Have you ever seen anything like that?

946
01:21:24,341 --> 01:21:27,135
No. I can't say I have.

947
01:21:28,428 --> 01:21:31,555
It's amazing what one honest man can do.

948
01:21:31,598 --> 01:21:34,559
One honest man and a cause.

949
01:21:36,227 --> 01:21:39,521
I don't think on that too much anymore.

950
01:21:41,065 --> 01:21:43,650
I guess my only cause is victory.

951
01:21:43,692 --> 01:21:46,611
This war comes as a nightmare.
You pick your nightmare side.

952
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:49,655
Then you put your head down and win.

953
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:53,034
Old gloomy Pete!

954
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:54,744
You see, Colonel...

955
01:21:54,786 --> 01:21:58,706
The government derives its power
from the consent of the people.

956
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:01,291
Every government, everywhere.

957
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,794
Let me make this very plain to you, sir.

958
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:08,964
We do not consent
and we will never consent.

959
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:12,218
And what you've got to do is,
you've got to go back over there...

960
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,471
to your Parliament and you've got
to make it very plain to them.

961
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:18,515
You've got to tell them
that what we're fighting for here...

962
01:22:18,557 --> 01:22:22,727
is the freedom from what we consider
to be the rule of a foreign power.

963
01:22:22,769 --> 01:22:26,230
I mean, that's all we want.
That's what this war is all about.

964
01:22:26,273 --> 01:22:30,526
Now we established this country
in the first place...

965
01:22:30,568 --> 01:22:33,070
with very strong state governments...

966
01:22:33,112 --> 01:22:35,280
just for that very reason.

967
01:22:35,322 --> 01:22:37,907
I mean, let me put it to you this way.

968
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:40,744
My home is in Virginia.

969
01:22:40,786 --> 01:22:44,289
The government of my home is home.

970
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:46,874
Virginia would not allow itself
to be ruled...

971
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:49,877
by some king over there in London.

972
01:22:49,919 --> 01:22:53,880
It's not about to let itself be ruled
by some president in Washington.

973
01:22:53,923 --> 01:22:57,509
Virginia, by God, sir,
is going to be run by Virginians.

974
01:22:57,551 --> 01:22:59,552
Oh, my. The Cause.

975
01:22:59,595 --> 01:23:01,805
Actually, Jimmy, I got a pair of kings.

976
01:23:01,847 --> 01:23:03,723
And it's all for the Yankees.

977
01:23:03,765 --> 01:23:05,766
The damn money-grubbing Yankees.

978
01:23:05,809 --> 01:23:08,478
I mean, those damn fools,
they don't get the message.

979
01:23:08,519 --> 01:23:11,062
Always the darkies.
Nothing but the darkies.

980
01:23:11,105 --> 01:23:12,564
You know, Jim...

981
01:23:12,606 --> 01:23:14,816
Sit down. I think that my idea...

982
01:23:14,858 --> 01:23:20,029
my analogy of a gentlemen's club
is fair enough. It's clear enough.

983
01:23:20,071 --> 01:23:22,114
Colonel, think on it now.

984
01:23:22,157 --> 01:23:25,159
Suppose that we all joined a club,
a gentlemen's club.

985
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:28,996
After a time, several of the members
began to intrude themselves...

986
01:23:29,038 --> 01:23:31,665
into our private lives, our home lives.

987
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:34,501
Began telling us
what we could and couldn't do.

988
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:37,837
Well, then, wouldn't any one of us
have the right to resign?

989
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:40,506
I mean, just resign.

990
01:23:40,673 --> 01:23:42,007
That's what we did.

991
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:47,346
That's what I did and now these people
are telling us we don't have that right.

992
01:23:50,474 --> 01:23:52,684
I got to hand it to you.

993
01:23:52,726 --> 01:23:56,312
You certainly do have a talent
for trivializing the momentous...

994
01:23:56,354 --> 01:23:58,314
and complicating the obvious.

995
01:23:58,356 --> 01:24:00,691
Have you ever considered
running for Congress?

996
01:24:00,733 --> 01:24:03,568
No. It's a thought.

997
01:24:07,489 --> 01:24:10,032
What does Colonel Fremantle think?

998
01:24:10,075 --> 01:24:12,535
Will the British come in on our side?

999
01:24:12,577 --> 01:24:17,956
Hell, yeah. They'll come in
when we don't need them no more.

1000
01:24:17,999 --> 01:24:22,044
Like some damn bank lending you money
when you're no longer in debt.

1001
01:24:22,086 --> 01:24:25,338
- Look here, Mr. Speaker...
- George.

1002
01:24:28,926 --> 01:24:30,802
A word?

1003
01:24:31,803 --> 01:24:33,846
Goodnight, Colonel.

1004
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:36,015
See you later.

1005
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:44,063
In the next few days, I believe
we're going to have a hell of a fight here.

1006
01:24:44,106 --> 01:24:47,317
I want you to do everything necessary
to get your boys ready.

1007
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:50,236
You can start bringing them up
by the first light.

1008
01:24:50,278 --> 01:24:52,738
I want you all in Gettysburg
by tomorrow night.

1009
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:54,907
Yes, sir.

1010
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:23,224
Good evening, John.

1011
01:25:23,267 --> 01:25:27,604
I'm surprised you could find headquarters
with all that confusion.

1012
01:25:28,313 --> 01:25:30,106
There's an old Indian saying:

1013
01:25:30,148 --> 01:25:33,901
"Follow the cigar smoke
and find a fat man there."

1014
01:25:55,379 --> 01:25:56,588
General Hancock.

1015
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:58,047
How are you, John?

1016
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:59,507
I'm all right.

1017
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:03,678
But the brigades are pretty shot up.
I need to get refitted.

1018
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:08,349
Right. I'll see to it.
We know what you did this morning.

1019
01:26:08,558 --> 01:26:12,394
- That was one hell of a piece of soldiering.
- Thank you, sir.

1020
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:16,648
Heard you were with John Reynolds
when he was killed.

1021
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:19,192
I'm sending the body up
to his folks in Lancaster.

1022
01:26:19,234 --> 01:26:21,360
They might appreciate a note from you.

1023
01:26:21,403 --> 01:26:23,279
I'll send it.

1024
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,406
He was a soldier.

1025
01:26:27,241 --> 01:26:29,534
And a good friend.

1026
01:26:30,327 --> 01:26:35,164
Three of us, Reynolds,
Lo Armistead and I came up together.

1027
01:26:35,207 --> 01:26:37,292
Mexican War.

1028
01:26:37,876 --> 01:26:39,877
California.

1029
01:26:40,045 --> 01:26:42,088
We stayed close.

1030
01:26:43,089 --> 01:26:46,925
I wonder how old Lo is doing.
If he's still alive.

1031
01:26:47,677 --> 01:26:50,054
Heard he had one of Pickett's brigades.

1032
01:26:50,095 --> 01:26:52,180
Under Longstreet.

1033
01:27:01,272 --> 01:27:03,148
Remarkable.

1034
01:27:05,901 --> 01:27:08,194
Just across the ridge.

1035
01:27:11,615 --> 01:27:15,243
I'd like to see him again, but not here.
Not like this.

1036
01:27:16,328 --> 01:27:19,455
Well, maybe after the war.

1037
01:27:24,877 --> 01:27:27,254
Where do you want me in the morning?

1038
01:27:27,296 --> 01:27:29,881
I want you to hold your position
on the extreme left.

1039
01:27:29,923 --> 01:27:31,966
Get some rest if you can.

1040
01:27:32,008 --> 01:27:34,009
We may need you in the morning.

1041
01:27:34,052 --> 01:27:37,471
Jeb Stuart's still on the prowl
out there someplace.

1042
01:27:38,181 --> 01:27:40,057
Yes, sir.

1043
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:19,927
Well, General Reynolds...

1044
01:28:21,845 --> 01:28:24,514
we held the high ground.

1045
01:28:40,863 --> 01:28:42,489
General Trimble is waiting.

1046
01:28:42,531 --> 01:28:44,407
- Will you see him now?
- Very well.

1047
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:48,285
Major, I want a scouting party sent out
posthaste to find General Stuart.

1048
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:51,455
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
- Thank you.

1049
01:29:05,051 --> 01:29:07,219
General Trimble.

1050
01:29:09,097 --> 01:29:13,726
Sir, I most respectfully request
another assignment.

1051
01:29:19,064 --> 01:29:21,357
Do please go on, General.

1052
01:29:21,399 --> 01:29:23,609
The man is a disgrace.

1053
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:27,738
Sir, have you been listening at all
to what the aides have been telling you?

1054
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:31,783
Ask General Gordon or General Ewell.
Ask them.

1055
01:29:32,785 --> 01:29:35,037
We could've taken that hill.

1056
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:37,372
God in his wisdom knows
we should've taken it.

1057
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:41,000
There was no one there at all
and it commanded the town.

1058
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:45,003
General Gordon saw it.
I mean, he was with us.

1059
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:48,382
Me and Ewell and Gordon...

1060
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:53,762
all standing in the dark like idiots
with that bloody damned hill empty.

1061
01:29:55,764 --> 01:29:58,266
I beg your pardon, General.

1062
01:29:58,767 --> 01:30:03,062
That bloody damned hill was bare
as his bloody damned head!

1063
01:30:03,104 --> 01:30:05,731
We all saw it, as God is my witness.

1064
01:30:05,773 --> 01:30:07,941
We were all there.

1065
01:30:07,983 --> 01:30:13,070
I said to him, "General Ewell,
we have got to take that hill."

1066
01:30:13,113 --> 01:30:16,115
General Jackson wouldn't have stopped
with them on the run...

1067
01:30:16,157 --> 01:30:19,118
and plenty of light
on a hill like that empty.

1068
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,453
God help us!

1069
01:30:21,996 --> 01:30:23,497
I don't know...

1070
01:30:23,539 --> 01:30:25,624
I don't know why...

1071
01:30:26,459 --> 01:30:28,836
Do please continue, General.

1072
01:30:29,628 --> 01:30:31,504
Yes, sir.

1073
01:30:32,964 --> 01:30:34,882
Sir.

1074
01:30:35,383 --> 01:30:38,427
I said to General Ewell these words...

1075
01:30:38,469 --> 01:30:40,512
I said to him:

1076
01:30:40,555 --> 01:30:45,809
"Sir, give me one division
and I will take that hill."

1077
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:51,106
He said nothing.
He just stood there and stared at me.

1078
01:30:51,148 --> 01:30:55,068
I said, "General Ewell,
give me one brigade...

1079
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:57,862
"and I will take that hill."

1080
01:30:58,488 --> 01:31:00,990
I was becoming disturbed, sir.

1081
01:31:01,032 --> 01:31:06,286
And General Ewell put his arms
behind him and blinked.

1082
01:31:06,328 --> 01:31:11,124
So I said,
"General, give me one regiment...

1083
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:13,793
"and I will take that hill."

1084
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:17,212
And he said nothing.

1085
01:31:17,255 --> 01:31:19,256
He just stood there.

1086
01:31:19,298 --> 01:31:23,510
I threw down my sword.
Down on the ground in front of him.

1087
01:31:32,393 --> 01:31:34,853
We could have done it, sir.

1088
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:37,564
A blind man should have seen it.

1089
01:31:39,608 --> 01:31:42,026
Now they're working up there.

1090
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:45,822
You can hear the axes
of the federal troops.

1091
01:31:45,864 --> 01:31:47,448
And so in the morning...

1092
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:50,409
many a good boy will die...

1093
01:31:50,868 --> 01:31:53,286
taking that hill.

1094
01:31:54,997 --> 01:31:56,873
Sir.

1095
01:31:57,541 --> 01:32:00,710
I must request another assignment.

1096
01:32:08,593 --> 01:32:11,679
No, sir. That won't be necessary.

1097
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,182
You will be of great service.

1098
01:32:15,224 --> 01:32:17,809
And I do thank you.

1099
01:33:08,022 --> 01:33:09,439
General Meade, sir.

1100
01:33:09,481 --> 01:33:14,026
Hancock. It's so damn dark out there
I can't see a thing.

1101
01:33:15,654 --> 01:33:17,655
Gentlemen.

1102
01:33:19,115 --> 01:33:21,617
I hope to God that this is...

1103
01:33:22,118 --> 01:33:24,244
good ground.

1104
01:33:26,622 --> 01:33:30,291
Is this good ground, General?

1105
01:33:30,959 --> 01:33:33,377
Is this a place to have an army?

1106
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:37,298
Very good ground, sir.

1107
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,633
I hope you are right.

1108
01:33:39,842 --> 01:33:44,012
Because we are going to have a fight here
sure enough in the morning.

1109
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:52,854
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- No, thank you, Major.

1110
01:33:52,896 --> 01:33:54,772
Very well.

1111
01:34:23,632 --> 01:34:26,467
In the morning is the great battle.

1112
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:31,263
Tomorrow or the next day
will determine the war.

1113
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:33,975
Virginia is here.

1114
01:34:34,017 --> 01:34:36,519
All the South is here.

1115
01:34:36,727 --> 01:34:39,270
What will you do tomorrow?

1116
01:34:40,356 --> 01:34:42,399
In the morning...

1117
01:34:42,441 --> 01:34:46,694
the enemy will be up
in fortified positions on high ground.

1118
01:34:47,028 --> 01:34:49,989
Longstreet's corps will be coming up...

1119
01:34:50,031 --> 01:34:53,617
and my boys will be ready
to finish the job.

1120
01:34:53,784 --> 01:34:58,162
If I tell them to withdraw now? No, sir.

1121
01:34:58,289 --> 01:35:01,541
They've been patient for far too long.

1122
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:04,585
With the enemy out there up on the hill...

1123
01:35:04,628 --> 01:35:07,797
they'll be ready to finish the job.

1124
01:35:07,881 --> 01:35:10,883
But I don't even know
how much is up there.

1125
01:35:10,925 --> 01:35:13,886
How many men? How many cannon?

1126
01:35:14,053 --> 01:35:17,431
I don't know the ground on the flanks.

1127
01:35:17,723 --> 01:35:19,724
I don't know.

1128
01:35:20,058 --> 01:35:23,477
If I wait in the morning,
the early morning...

1129
01:35:23,562 --> 01:35:27,231
maybe Meade, under pressure, will attack.

1130
01:35:27,774 --> 01:35:30,943
That would make General Longstreet
very happy.

1131
01:35:31,944 --> 01:35:35,238
But I don't think Meade will come down.

1132
01:35:35,281 --> 01:35:40,892
And I don't think I can withdraw, so...

1133
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:46,232
God's will, thy will be done.

1134
01:35:47,985 --> 01:35:50,196
Major Sorrel, you've met before.

1135
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:52,366
Thank you, General.

1136
01:35:52,575 --> 01:35:56,246
The federal position was scouted
during the last several hours.

1137
01:35:56,289 --> 01:35:57,916
We've drawn it up here.

1138
01:35:57,958 --> 01:35:59,919
Now this is the situation.

1139
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:03,715
The position of the federal army
is in the shape of a fishhook.

1140
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,094
It starts here. You see these two hills?

1141
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:08,556
This one and the one with the cemetery.

1142
01:36:08,598 --> 01:36:11,560
That is where they have concentrated
their troops.

1143
01:36:11,602 --> 01:36:14,272
The hook starts there.

1144
01:36:14,314 --> 01:36:17,735
Now it curves around and comes down
this low ridge to the south.

1145
01:36:17,777 --> 01:36:20,906
Ending before two round hills
of high elevation.

1146
01:36:20,949 --> 01:36:24,370
The federals have no troops
on those two hills.

1147
01:36:24,412 --> 01:36:26,832
- Carry on, Major.
- Thank you.

1148
01:36:26,999 --> 01:36:31,296
We now know that General Hancock
is in charge of the Union center.

1149
01:36:31,338 --> 01:36:34,926
There are now perhaps 60,000
to 70,000 men already in position.

1150
01:36:34,969 --> 01:36:37,347
Perhaps as high as 90,000.

1151
01:36:41,186 --> 01:36:44,148
I spoke with General Ewell
of your suggestion...

1152
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:47,945
that we move around to the right
to flank the federal army.

1153
01:36:47,987 --> 01:36:51,575
And he is of the opinion that
withdrawing from Gettysburg...

1154
01:36:51,617 --> 01:36:55,330
and giving it back to the enemy
would be very bad for morale.

1155
01:36:55,373 --> 01:36:58,502
It is unnecessary.
It might even be dangerous.

1156
01:36:58,544 --> 01:37:00,713
Do you disagree?

1157
01:37:02,341 --> 01:37:04,385
We must attack.

1158
01:37:05,262 --> 01:37:07,640
I would prefer not to fight
upon this ground...

1159
01:37:07,682 --> 01:37:11,437
but every moment we delay
the enemy uses to reinforce himself.

1160
01:37:11,479 --> 01:37:14,525
We cannot support ourselves for long
in this country.

1161
01:37:14,567 --> 01:37:17,654
We must not allow the federal army
to move around behind...

1162
01:37:17,696 --> 01:37:19,782
and cut us off from home. No, sir.

1163
01:37:19,824 --> 01:37:22,577
We must strike him now.

1164
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:29,087
We pushed him yesterday
and he will remember it.

1165
01:37:29,421 --> 01:37:34,595
The men are ready and they are eager.
I see no useful alternative.

1166
01:37:34,637 --> 01:37:35,721
Yes, sir.

1167
01:37:35,764 --> 01:37:37,933
Very well.

1168
01:37:39,102 --> 01:37:40,979
Gentlemen.

1169
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:44,317
- Good morning, all.
- Good morning, sir.

1170
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:48,781
Longstreet will attack on the right
with the First Corps.

1171
01:37:49,116 --> 01:37:51,202
Hill will support...

1172
01:37:51,244 --> 01:37:53,497
with Heth in reserve.

1173
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:57,752
Ewell's people on the left
will demonstrate to keep the enemy...

1174
01:37:57,795 --> 01:38:00,215
from reinforcing against our right flank.

1175
01:38:00,257 --> 01:38:02,718
Yes, sir. But I still don't have Pickett.

1176
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,305
He's at the rear of column,
a full day's march.

1177
01:38:05,347 --> 01:38:07,934
All I've got is Hood and McLaws.

1178
01:38:07,976 --> 01:38:12,816
I do believe that Hood's
and McLaws' divisions will be sufficient.

1179
01:38:13,025 --> 01:38:16,446
- With the General's permission.
- General Hood?

1180
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:20,786
Moving in front of those rocky heights,
we'll have enfilade fire...

1181
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:22,121
coming down on us.

1182
01:38:22,163 --> 01:38:24,457
Perhaps, but not for long. Your division...

1183
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:27,963
will be up over this unoccupied hill,
the little, rocky one.

1184
01:38:28,005 --> 01:38:30,258
From there you will threaten
the enemy flank.

1185
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:33,846
When you're heavily engaged,
General Ewell will strike from the left.

1186
01:38:33,888 --> 01:38:35,765
Very well, sir.

1187
01:38:36,517 --> 01:38:39,270
- General?
- Let's move out, gentlemen.

1188
01:38:44,945 --> 01:38:47,615
General Barksdale,
is Mississippi ready for this day?

1189
01:38:47,658 --> 01:38:49,911
- Mississippi is ready.
- Very well.

1190
01:38:49,953 --> 01:38:52,289
Let's go to it, Sam.

1191
01:38:55,377 --> 01:38:58,047
If he's right, General Lee...

1192
01:38:58,214 --> 01:39:00,967
then the war is over by sundown.

1193
01:39:02,053 --> 01:39:03,930
We'll see.

1194
01:39:04,014 --> 01:39:06,350
I don't like going in without Pickett.

1195
01:39:06,393 --> 01:39:09,146
It's like going in with one boot off.

1196
01:39:09,188 --> 01:39:11,858
I'll wait as long as I can.

1197
01:39:12,735 --> 01:39:15,405
Do you have any idea of the force?

1198
01:39:16,324 --> 01:39:21,205
We counted five corps, including
the two involved in yesterday's action.

1199
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:23,291
That don't mean how many might be...

1200
01:39:23,334 --> 01:39:26,254
hidden behind those hills there.

1201
01:39:26,421 --> 01:39:30,802
And, damn it, with Stuart gone
there ain't no way of knowing for sure.

1202
01:39:32,847 --> 01:39:36,101
Take good care of yourself today,
you hear?

1203
01:39:36,477 --> 01:39:38,354
You, too, Pete.

1204
01:39:48,661 --> 01:39:50,955
With your permission, sir.

1205
01:40:02,848 --> 01:40:05,643
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

1206
01:40:06,103 --> 01:40:09,774
That's Major General John Bell Hood,
but we call him Sam.

1207
01:40:09,816 --> 01:40:14,280
One of my three division commanders.
Fellows from Texas and Alabama.

1208
01:40:14,323 --> 01:40:17,202
You've been to Texas, as I recall.

1209
01:40:17,244 --> 01:40:20,373
Yes. Actually that's where I came through.

1210
01:40:20,415 --> 01:40:24,796
Courtesy of the Yankee Navy
who denied me any other point of entry.

1211
01:40:26,256 --> 01:40:28,884
It's a marvelous place, Texas.

1212
01:40:28,927 --> 01:40:31,764
Full of red Indians and Mexicans...

1213
01:40:31,806 --> 01:40:35,477
cowboys, bandits and desperados.

1214
01:40:35,937 --> 01:40:39,024
Even hotter and more humid
than this place.

1215
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:41,653
If that's possible.

1216
01:40:41,695 --> 01:40:43,155
That fellow Hood...

1217
01:40:43,197 --> 01:40:46,159
does his performance in battle
match his appearance?

1218
01:40:46,202 --> 01:40:48,747
He really does look the part.

1219
01:40:48,789 --> 01:40:50,875
He does his job.

1220
01:40:51,459 --> 01:40:54,212
Most interesting army, I must say.

1221
01:40:54,547 --> 01:40:58,719
Virginia gentlemen fighting
alongside Texas frontiersmen...

1222
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:02,057
and bayou bushwhackers from Louisiana.

1223
01:41:02,099 --> 01:41:05,270
Drawn together from across a continent.

1224
01:41:06,021 --> 01:41:09,859
Having traveled a good piece of it myself,
I feel a part...

1225
01:41:09,902 --> 01:41:13,740
or almost a member of this enterprise.

1226
01:41:14,367 --> 01:41:19,082
You call yourselves Americans,
but you're really transplanted Englishmen.

1227
01:41:19,123 --> 01:41:22,294
Look at your names, Lee, Hood...

1228
01:41:22,336 --> 01:41:24,714
Longstreet, Jackson, Stuart.

1229
01:41:24,756 --> 01:41:26,049
My people were Dutch.

1230
01:41:26,092 --> 01:41:31,182
And the same for your adversaries.
Meade, Hooker, Hancock, and...

1231
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:35,355
shall I say? Lincoln.

1232
01:41:37,024 --> 01:41:41,739
The same God. Same language.
Same culture and history.

1233
01:41:41,781 --> 01:41:47,121
The same songs, stories, legends, myths.

1234
01:41:47,455 --> 01:41:49,666
But different dreams.

1235
01:41:50,376 --> 01:41:52,545
Different dreams.

1236
01:41:53,464 --> 01:41:56,760
It's so very sad. Very sad.

1237
01:41:56,802 --> 01:42:00,181
You English had your own civil war once,
didn't you?

1238
01:42:00,516 --> 01:42:03,603
That was ages ago.
We wouldn't dream of it now.

1239
01:42:03,645 --> 01:42:05,689
Cavaliers and Roundheads.

1240
01:42:05,732 --> 01:42:08,569
"Off with his head!"

1241
01:42:09,529 --> 01:42:11,072
Heads lying everywhere.

1242
01:42:11,114 --> 01:42:14,535
One could hardly take a step
without tripping over a fallen crown.

1243
01:42:14,577 --> 01:42:16,496
We're much more civilized now.

1244
01:42:16,539 --> 01:42:19,000
I assure you.

1245
01:42:19,167 --> 01:42:22,087
We have so much in common,
your country and mine.

1246
01:42:22,130 --> 01:42:25,927
I earnestly hope
that we shall become allies.

1247
01:42:25,969 --> 01:42:30,183
Your government would never ally itself
with a Confederacy...

1248
01:42:30,225 --> 01:42:34,272
that had the institution of slavery.
You know that. So do I.

1249
01:42:41,032 --> 01:42:45,121
We should have freed the slaves,
then fired on Fort Sumter.

1250
01:42:48,835 --> 01:42:54,217
I guess we Southerners and you English
have at least one thing in common.

1251
01:42:54,259 --> 01:42:58,056
We'd rather lose the war
than admit to the mistake.

1252
01:42:59,016 --> 01:43:02,562
We whupped you British twice
as I recollect.

1253
01:43:04,232 --> 01:43:08,362
Your candor is admirable,
if somewhat eccentric.

1254
01:43:08,654 --> 01:43:11,658
A little eccentricity is good for a general.

1255
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:16,248
We Southerners like our men religious
and a little bit mad.

1256
01:43:16,791 --> 01:43:20,504
I suspect that's why the women
fall in love with preachers.

1257
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:07,488
In nomine pater, et filii, et spiritus sancti.

1258
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:09,157
Amen.

1259
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,493
General Longstreet.

1260
01:44:11,953 --> 01:44:13,955
Do you mind if I accompany you?

1261
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:17,502
Not at all. I'm very glad
to have you with us, sir.

1262
01:44:18,421 --> 01:44:21,049
The heat reminds me of Mexico.

1263
01:44:21,091 --> 01:44:23,886
Yes, but there it was very dry.

1264
01:44:24,054 --> 01:44:26,474
That was a good outfit.

1265
01:44:26,641 --> 01:44:31,439
I remember storming the ramparts
of Chapultapec with old George Pickett.

1266
01:44:31,689 --> 01:44:35,778
Reynolds... My old friend,
Ulysses Sam Grant.

1267
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:38,699
- There was some good men in that army.
- Yes, indeed.

1268
01:44:38,741 --> 01:44:43,038
Some of those men are waiting for us now
up ahead on those ridges.

1269
01:44:44,207 --> 01:44:48,379
I don't know. I sometimes feel troubled.

1270
01:44:48,797 --> 01:44:52,635
Those fellows, those boys in blue,
they never quite seem the enemy.

1271
01:44:52,678 --> 01:44:54,555
I know.

1272
01:44:55,014 --> 01:44:59,019
I used to command some of those boys.
Swore an oath, too.

1273
01:45:01,232 --> 01:45:05,404
I couldn't fight against Georgia
and South Carolina.

1274
01:45:05,696 --> 01:45:07,198
Not against my own family.

1275
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:11,120
No, sir. There was always a higher duty
to Virginia.

1276
01:45:11,162 --> 01:45:12,622
That was our first duty.

1277
01:45:12,664 --> 01:45:15,042
There was never any question about that.

1278
01:45:15,085 --> 01:45:18,047
- I guess so.
- Let us not think about that now.

1279
01:45:18,089 --> 01:45:20,300
The issue is in God's hands.

1280
01:45:20,342 --> 01:45:22,595
We can only do our duty.

1281
01:45:23,597 --> 01:45:25,516
General?

1282
01:45:25,808 --> 01:45:28,895
Soldiering has one great trap.

1283
01:45:29,146 --> 01:45:32,233
To be a good soldier
you must love the army.

1284
01:45:32,276 --> 01:45:35,906
To be a good commander,
you must be willing to order the death...

1285
01:45:35,948 --> 01:45:38,159
of the thing you love.

1286
01:45:38,201 --> 01:45:40,996
We do not fear our own death, you and I.

1287
01:45:41,038 --> 01:45:43,875
But there comes a time...

1288
01:45:44,251 --> 01:45:47,463
We are never quite prepared
for so many to die.

1289
01:45:47,506 --> 01:45:52,846
We do expect the occasional empty chair.
A salute to fallen comrades...

1290
01:45:53,264 --> 01:45:55,892
but this war goes on and on
and the men die...

1291
01:45:55,934 --> 01:45:58,562
and the price gets ever higher.

1292
01:45:58,688 --> 01:46:04,321
We are prepared to lose some of us,
but we are never prepared to lose all of us.

1293
01:46:04,363 --> 01:46:07,116
And there is the great trap, General.

1294
01:46:07,159 --> 01:46:09,370
When you attack,
you must hold nothing back.

1295
01:46:09,412 --> 01:46:11,581
You must commit yourself totally.

1296
01:46:11,623 --> 01:46:15,336
We are adrift here in a sea of blood,
and I want it to end.

1297
01:46:17,215 --> 01:46:20,010
I want this to be the final battle.

1298
01:46:25,769 --> 01:46:29,649
I woke up this morning and I half thought
he'd be gone, George Meade.

1299
01:46:29,691 --> 01:46:32,820
That he would not want to fight here.
Yes, sir.

1300
01:46:32,862 --> 01:46:35,532
I woke up and I thought,
"Meade will be gone...

1301
01:46:35,574 --> 01:46:39,204
"and this war will go on and on and on."

1302
01:46:41,708 --> 01:46:44,211
We'll make him sorry he stayed.

1303
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,967
God go with you, General.

1304
01:46:49,010 --> 01:46:51,221
And with you, General.

1305
01:46:58,941 --> 01:47:00,526
That's mostly to the south.

1306
01:47:00,568 --> 01:47:04,698
I thought the rebs were all in Gettysburg.
You don't suppose they're flanking again?

1307
01:47:04,741 --> 01:47:07,787
Mama's favorite. Let's go.

1308
01:47:07,829 --> 01:47:09,915
Lawrence, what's happening?

1309
01:47:09,957 --> 01:47:12,919
Sir, Corporal Estabrook reporting back, sir.

1310
01:47:12,961 --> 01:47:15,923
- Brook, I thought you were on sick call.
- Yes, sir.

1311
01:47:15,965 --> 01:47:17,091
How are you now?

1312
01:47:17,133 --> 01:47:19,302
It's my stomach.
I've been throwing up, sir.

1313
01:47:19,345 --> 01:47:20,805
It's something you ate.

1314
01:47:20,847 --> 01:47:24,310
- Finish up. We're about to move out.
- Yes, sir.

1315
01:47:25,061 --> 01:47:27,314
- Colonel Chamberlain.
- Colonel Vincent.

1316
01:47:27,356 --> 01:47:30,068
Form your men.
Follow me and prepare to double-quick.

1317
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:32,655
We're going to the top of that hill,
right there.

1318
01:47:32,697 --> 01:47:34,908
- You hear that?
- Yes, sir. I'll set it up.

1319
01:47:34,951 --> 01:47:37,412
The rebels are stacking up
on our left flank.

1320
01:47:37,454 --> 01:47:39,123
And we've got to follow them.

1321
01:47:39,165 --> 01:47:41,167
- Make haste.
- Yes, sir.

1322
01:47:41,209 --> 01:47:43,378
Sound the assembly!

1323
01:47:45,007 --> 01:47:46,884
Follow me.

1324
01:47:51,516 --> 01:47:54,186
Powder in! Load!

1325
01:48:02,531 --> 01:48:04,408
General.

1326
01:48:05,202 --> 01:48:09,374
Look here,
the ground is strewn with boulders.

1327
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:12,295
The soldiers up there are entrenched
all over the ground.

1328
01:48:12,337 --> 01:48:14,673
And there are guns in the rocks.

1329
01:48:14,715 --> 01:48:17,802
Every move I make is observed.

1330
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:22,893
If I attack as ordered,
I lose half my division.

1331
01:48:22,936 --> 01:48:27,692
And they'll be looking down our throats
at us from that hill right there.

1332
01:48:27,984 --> 01:48:30,696
We must move around to the right, sir.

1333
01:48:30,738 --> 01:48:33,074
And take them from the rear.

1334
01:48:33,492 --> 01:48:38,457
The commanding general will not allow
a flanking movement around those hills.

1335
01:48:38,541 --> 01:48:40,877
I argued it yesterday.
I argued it all morning.

1336
01:48:40,919 --> 01:48:43,547
I've been arguing against any attack at all.

1337
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:46,802
I can't call this one off. You know it.

1338
01:48:47,262 --> 01:48:50,308
Let me move up the big round hill
to the south.

1339
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:53,103
Nobody is on that.
If I could get a battery up there...

1340
01:48:53,145 --> 01:48:54,772
There ain't enough time.

1341
01:48:54,814 --> 01:48:57,359
You'd have to cut down trees
to place your artillery.

1342
01:48:57,401 --> 01:49:00,405
It would be dark before you were in action.

1343
01:49:00,614 --> 01:49:03,576
One the other hand,
if they get batteries up there...

1344
01:49:03,618 --> 01:49:07,665
we'll need buckets to catch the lead.
You've got to take that hill.

1345
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:10,378
They don't even need guns to defend that.

1346
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:13,007
All they need to do
is roll rocks down on you.

1347
01:49:13,049 --> 01:49:14,509
Just take it.

1348
01:49:14,551 --> 01:49:15,635
General.

1349
01:49:15,677 --> 01:49:17,971
I do this under protest.

1350
01:49:18,014 --> 01:49:20,601
Sam, you are the best I got.

1351
01:49:20,726 --> 01:49:24,397
Now, sir, if you are ready,
why don't you take that hill?

1352
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,550
They're overshooting again.

1353
01:49:43,592 --> 01:49:47,597
Hey, fellows, you notice how
that reb artillery always overshoots?

1354
01:49:47,848 --> 01:49:49,475
- Tom?
- Yes, sir.

1355
01:49:49,517 --> 01:49:52,479
Another one a bit closer
and it could be hard day for Mother.

1356
01:49:52,521 --> 01:49:54,815
Go back to the rear.
Watch out for stragglers.

1357
01:49:54,858 --> 01:49:57,278
Keep your distance from me.

1358
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:59,698
Lawrence, I don't...

1359
01:50:41,258 --> 01:50:43,719
The whole damn reb army is down there...

1360
01:50:43,761 --> 01:50:47,683
and coming up around our flanks.
They could be here any minute.

1361
01:50:47,725 --> 01:50:51,814
We've got to hold this place.
We've got to hold it.

1362
01:50:53,483 --> 01:50:56,195
Well, all right. I place you here.

1363
01:50:56,237 --> 01:51:00,200
Put your colors here, and set
your regiment to the left of this line.

1364
01:51:00,243 --> 01:51:03,497
The rest of the brigade
will form on your right. Understood?

1365
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:05,833
- Yes. Ellis, this is the point.
- Sir.

1366
01:51:05,876 --> 01:51:08,671
Your regiment is to the left of this point.

1367
01:51:08,713 --> 01:51:12,593
- Colonel, sir. You're the end of the line.
- Yes.

1368
01:51:12,803 --> 01:51:17,351
You're the extreme left of the Union army.
Understood?

1369
01:51:17,559 --> 01:51:20,229
The line runs from here
back to Cemetery Hill...

1370
01:51:20,272 --> 01:51:22,942
- but it ends here.
- Understood.

1371
01:51:22,984 --> 01:51:25,863
You can't withdraw under any condition.

1372
01:51:26,614 --> 01:51:29,201
If you go, this line will be flanked.

1373
01:51:29,243 --> 01:51:31,996
If you go, the enemy will sweep up
over the hillside...

1374
01:51:32,038 --> 01:51:35,042
and take this entire army from the rear.

1375
01:51:35,752 --> 01:51:39,090
- You must defend this place to the last.
- Yes, sir.

1376
01:51:40,968 --> 01:51:43,847
Now we'll see how professors fight.

1377
01:51:45,057 --> 01:51:47,936
Ellis, position the regiment.
All company commanders here.

1378
01:51:47,978 --> 01:51:49,146
Yes, sir.

1379
01:51:49,188 --> 01:51:51,524
Sharpshooters to the left!

1380
01:51:51,775 --> 01:51:54,028
Battalion on the right!

1381
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:57,241
Now file into line. March.

1382
01:52:04,126 --> 01:52:06,796
Bugler, sound the officer's call.

1383
01:52:12,763 --> 01:52:16,977
"Hold to the last." To the last what?

1384
01:52:17,728 --> 01:52:19,981
Exercise in rhetoric.

1385
01:52:20,023 --> 01:52:23,069
Last shell? Last man?

1386
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:26,908
Last foot of ground? Last reb?

1387
01:52:38,883 --> 01:52:40,760
Advance!

1388
01:52:41,763 --> 01:52:43,640
Move out!

1389
01:53:24,156 --> 01:53:26,909
Turn those guns around!

1390
01:53:31,584 --> 01:53:34,838
The 83rd Pennsylvania, 44th New York,
and 16th Michigan...

1391
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,384
will be moving in to our right.
But if you look left, you will see...

1392
01:53:38,427 --> 01:53:40,429
that there is no one there.

1393
01:53:40,471 --> 01:53:43,725
Because we're the end of the line.
The Union army stops here.

1394
01:53:43,768 --> 01:53:45,854
We are the flank.

1395
01:53:46,104 --> 01:53:47,814
Do you understand, gentlemen?

1396
01:53:47,857 --> 01:53:50,986
We cannot retreat. We cannot withdraw.

1397
01:53:51,028 --> 01:53:54,699
We are going to have
to be stubborn today.

1398
01:53:55,868 --> 01:53:58,329
Put the boys in position,
tell them to stay down.

1399
01:53:58,372 --> 01:54:01,501
Pile the rocks up high
for the best protection you can.

1400
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:04,004
I want the reserve pulled back
about 20 yards.

1401
01:54:04,046 --> 01:54:05,923
Sloping ground is good ground.

1402
01:54:05,966 --> 01:54:09,178
If you have any breakthroughs,
men wounded, a hole in the line...

1403
01:54:09,221 --> 01:54:11,891
plug it with the reserve.
How's our ammunition?

1404
01:54:11,933 --> 01:54:14,144
Sir, I think about 60 rounds per man.

1405
01:54:14,186 --> 01:54:17,357
That's good. 60 rounds. I think...
Yes, that's adequate.

1406
01:54:17,399 --> 01:54:18,525
Any questions?

1407
01:54:18,567 --> 01:54:19,651
Colonel.

1408
01:54:19,694 --> 01:54:23,198
It seems to me
the fighting is on that side of the hill.

1409
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,451
It seems to me that we're the back door.

1410
01:54:25,494 --> 01:54:29,124
And everything's going on
at the front door.

1411
01:54:30,042 --> 01:54:34,214
That hill is steep and rocky. It's bare.
To come straight up it is impossible.

1412
01:54:34,256 --> 01:54:36,384
The reb army is going to swing around it.

1413
01:54:36,426 --> 01:54:39,764
It'll come up through that notch
right over there.

1414
01:54:39,806 --> 01:54:44,187
It'll move under the cover of trees,
trying to get around the flank.

1415
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:47,108
And gentlemen...

1416
01:54:47,275 --> 01:54:49,569
we are the flank.

1417
01:54:51,531 --> 01:54:53,450
Gentlemen.

1418
01:55:01,128 --> 01:55:03,297
God go with you.

1419
01:55:28,709 --> 01:55:31,629
Captain Clark,
take the right side from the 83rd...

1420
01:55:31,671 --> 01:55:33,757
over in this direction to the center.

1421
01:55:33,799 --> 01:55:37,929
Ellis, take the left but be watchful.
Your flank will be in the air.

1422
01:55:40,183 --> 01:55:42,603
- Colonel, sir.
- Corporal Estabrook?

1423
01:55:42,645 --> 01:55:47,526
What do I do with these prisoners?
The hardheads of the Second Maine.

1424
01:55:50,615 --> 01:55:53,035
Do any of you care to join us?

1425
01:55:53,077 --> 01:55:56,581
- The rebs really coming?
- They're really coming.

1426
01:55:56,624 --> 01:56:00,003
Well, it's kind of dull
just sitting here watching, sir.

1427
01:56:00,045 --> 01:56:03,675
For any man who joins us,
there will be no court martial.

1428
01:56:09,392 --> 01:56:11,895
No man will call me a coward.

1429
01:56:17,028 --> 01:56:18,905
Why not?

1430
01:56:24,204 --> 01:56:27,875
I'll waste no man to guard you.
I expect you to be here when this is over.

1431
01:56:27,918 --> 01:56:32,090
- Let's get these fellows some muskets.
- There are no muskets, sir.

1432
01:56:34,427 --> 01:56:35,887
Wait here for a bit.

1433
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:39,101
There will be guns available
in a little while.

1434
01:56:42,606 --> 01:56:45,443
That's the New York boys.
The rebs must be getting closer.

1435
01:56:45,485 --> 01:56:47,779
Must be moving this way.

1436
01:56:48,948 --> 01:56:51,535
Private Foss is praying.

1437
01:56:55,207 --> 01:56:58,837
- Will you put in a kind word for me?
- Yes, sir.

1438
01:57:05,472 --> 01:57:07,850
- You're the Merrill brothers, right?
- Yes, sir.

1439
01:57:07,892 --> 01:57:09,811
Boys, why aren't you on the ground?

1440
01:57:09,853 --> 01:57:12,440
Sir, I can't shoot worth a darn lying down.

1441
01:57:12,482 --> 01:57:15,778
Never could. Bill neither.
We like to fight standing.

1442
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:17,822
I suggest you find a thicker tree.

1443
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:19,741
Here they come!

1444
01:57:23,873 --> 01:57:26,877
I want you to stay with me,
but you keep down.

1445
01:57:26,919 --> 01:57:28,838
Buster!

1446
01:57:28,922 --> 01:57:31,467
I bet the whole damn reb army
is coming this way.

1447
01:57:31,509 --> 01:57:34,221
Walk down the line.
Tell the boys to get good cover.

1448
01:57:34,263 --> 01:57:36,599
Pile the rocks high and fire carefully.

1449
01:57:36,641 --> 01:57:38,685
- Go down and come back.
- Right.

1450
01:57:38,727 --> 01:57:40,479
You got to keep an eye on them.

1451
01:57:40,522 --> 01:57:43,693
Some of them load but never fire.
They just keep right on loading.

1452
01:57:43,734 --> 01:57:46,404
Some come home with
eight bullets rammed up the barrel.

1453
01:57:46,447 --> 01:57:48,741
Never fired a shot.

1454
01:57:50,494 --> 01:57:52,371
Sir.

1455
01:57:56,085 --> 01:57:58,338
Fire!

1456
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:53,667
Keep up your fire, boys!

1457
01:58:57,965 --> 01:58:59,675
Keep your head down.

1458
01:58:59,718 --> 01:59:02,054
Watch your left side.

1459
01:59:08,981 --> 01:59:11,484
Keep up your fire!

1460
02:00:08,232 --> 02:00:09,901
They're falling back.

1461
02:00:09,943 --> 02:00:11,778
They'll be back in a minute.

1462
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:14,824
- How are we doing?
- We're doing fine.

1463
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:17,202
- Colonel.
- Captain Clark, anybody hurt?

1464
02:00:17,245 --> 02:00:19,873
- Head and shoulder wounds.
- They didn't hit the left.

1465
02:00:19,915 --> 02:00:22,668
They're moving out that way.
Can you see them, sir?

1466
02:00:22,711 --> 02:00:25,840
They're coming again, boys!

1467
02:01:40,071 --> 02:01:42,699
Colonel, look here.

1468
02:01:42,742 --> 02:01:45,788
A new regiment has arrived
that's moving against the left.

1469
02:01:45,829 --> 02:01:48,123
It's out there. Do you see them?

1470
02:01:48,166 --> 02:01:50,794
Double-quick!

1471
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:53,715
I don't think we'll be able
to hold another one.

1472
02:01:53,757 --> 02:01:57,303
- Get all company commanders up here.
- On the double.

1473
02:01:58,639 --> 02:02:02,102
- Sergeant Owen!
- Yes, sir.

1474
02:02:02,144 --> 02:02:05,774
Get up to the top of that hill
and report me the situation from up there.

1475
02:02:05,816 --> 02:02:07,693
Yes, sir.

1476
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:28,014
We're about to be flanked.
Here's what we'll do.

1477
02:02:28,098 --> 02:02:30,559
I want you to keep up
a good hot masking fire.

1478
02:02:30,601 --> 02:02:34,523
Keep a tight hold on the 83rd,
on old Pennsylvania over there.

1479
02:02:35,358 --> 02:02:37,110
I want no break in the line.

1480
02:02:37,152 --> 02:02:40,823
Captain Clark, that's you.
You understand? No breaks.

1481
02:02:40,866 --> 02:02:44,162
Right wing will sidestep to the left...

1482
02:02:44,246 --> 02:02:46,540
thinning out to twice the present distance.

1483
02:02:46,583 --> 02:02:50,213
You see the colors?
They will end up down to the extreme left.

1484
02:02:50,254 --> 02:02:54,802
When you reach that point,
we are going to refuse the line.

1485
02:02:54,928 --> 02:02:56,012
Understand?

1486
02:02:56,054 --> 02:02:58,140
We'll form a new line at right angles.

1487
02:02:58,182 --> 02:03:00,560
We'll pull up as much of a reserve
as possible.

1488
02:03:00,603 --> 02:03:03,732
We've got to be able to counter-attack
whenever there's a hole.

1489
02:03:03,774 --> 02:03:05,651
- Any questions?
- No, sir.

1490
02:03:05,693 --> 02:03:07,904
Fine. Move!

1491
02:03:08,364 --> 02:03:11,535
Lieutenant. You fellows, on the double.

1492
02:03:23,343 --> 02:03:25,220
Come on!

1493
02:04:08,115 --> 02:04:10,576
- How are you, Andrew?
- I'm fine, sir. And you?

1494
02:04:10,619 --> 02:04:12,288
A bit worn.

1495
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:16,961
- The boys are putting up a hell of a fight.
- They are indeed.

1496
02:05:25,183 --> 02:05:28,187
I got me one. I got me a reb.

1497
02:05:28,605 --> 02:05:30,190
Buster! Are you all right?

1498
02:05:30,232 --> 02:05:33,528
I'll be fine in a minute,
but plays hell with me target practice.

1499
02:05:33,570 --> 02:05:35,072
The surgeon will see to it.

1500
02:05:35,114 --> 02:05:37,575
No. A little bandage is all I'll be needing.

1501
02:05:37,618 --> 02:05:40,205
A few minutes off my feet.
Me brogans are killing me.

1502
02:05:40,247 --> 02:05:42,959
Colonel, my men are getting low
on ammunition.

1503
02:05:43,001 --> 02:05:45,546
Go over to the 83rd.
Ask them to send what they can.

1504
02:05:45,588 --> 02:05:49,343
Lieutenant, go get from the wounded
and from the others anything you can.

1505
02:05:49,385 --> 02:05:53,599
- Pick up what you can from anywhere.
- Here they come, sir!

1506
02:06:39,665 --> 02:06:43,253
Keep up the fire!
Fill your holes down here!

1507
02:07:24,103 --> 02:07:26,272
There they go!

1508
02:07:37,998 --> 02:07:40,251
I'll be damned.

1509
02:07:41,419 --> 02:07:45,257
They keep coming!
How long are they going to keep coming?

1510
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:48,721
I don't have much left. I got two shots.
That's what I got.

1511
02:07:48,763 --> 02:07:52,560
They keep coming on the flanks.
They keep moving to the left more.

1512
02:07:52,602 --> 02:07:56,232
They can't send help from the 83rd.
They say they got their own troubles.

1513
02:07:56,274 --> 02:08:00,237
- Colonel, sir! We'd like to report.
- What?

1514
02:08:00,279 --> 02:08:02,448
Vincent is badly wounded.

1515
02:08:02,491 --> 02:08:04,952
He got hit a few minutes
after the fight started.

1516
02:08:04,994 --> 02:08:08,498
We've been reinforced at the top of the hill
by Weed's brigade up front.

1517
02:08:08,541 --> 02:08:10,752
This is what they tell me.
But Weed is dead.

1518
02:08:10,794 --> 02:08:13,464
So they moved Hazlett's
battery of artillery up there.

1519
02:08:13,507 --> 02:08:15,635
But Hazlett's dead. Far as I can tell...

1520
02:08:15,676 --> 02:08:17,804
Can you can get ammunition
from up there?

1521
02:08:17,846 --> 02:08:20,474
I don't know. It's a mess.
But they're holding good.

1522
02:08:20,517 --> 02:08:22,686
The rebs are having a hard time climbing.

1523
02:08:22,728 --> 02:08:25,148
- It's a steep hill.
- We'll need the ammunition.

1524
02:08:25,190 --> 02:08:27,985
Colonel, sir, the better of my men
are wounded.

1525
02:08:28,027 --> 02:08:31,323
If the rebs come up that hill any stronger,
we can't stop them.

1526
02:08:31,365 --> 02:08:33,952
Send out word to take ammunition
from the wounded.

1527
02:08:33,994 --> 02:08:37,206
- Make every round count. Go!
- Here they come again!

1528
02:08:38,292 --> 02:08:40,545
Ready, boys!

1529
02:09:01,158 --> 02:09:04,245
Come on, keep it coming! Keep it up, lads!

1530
02:09:42,759 --> 02:09:44,678
Pour it on, boys!

1531
02:09:54,692 --> 02:09:57,779
Keep at them! Keep up your fire!

1532
02:10:14,179 --> 02:10:16,807
Here they come, boys!

1533
02:11:35,044 --> 02:11:37,464
Go plug that hole over there!

1534
02:12:37,132 --> 02:12:38,759
Sir, half my men are down.

1535
02:12:38,801 --> 02:12:41,388
Most of the rest are wounded.
The left is too thin.

1536
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:43,349
- How is our ammunition?
- Almost gone.

1537
02:12:43,391 --> 02:12:47,521
Sir, we're running out.
We don't have much left to shoot with.

1538
02:12:47,564 --> 02:12:49,358
Some boys got nothing at all.

1539
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:51,152
What do we do for ammunition?

1540
02:12:51,194 --> 02:12:54,073
My boys had to pick up reb muskets
and fired back with them.

1541
02:12:54,115 --> 02:12:56,535
- We ought to pull out.
- No, we can't do that.

1542
02:12:56,577 --> 02:12:58,371
We can't hold them again, sir.

1543
02:12:58,412 --> 02:13:02,334
If we don't, they go right over the hill
and the flank caves in.

1544
02:13:06,758 --> 02:13:08,677
Here they come.

1545
02:13:12,766 --> 02:13:15,394
We can't run away.
If we stay here, we can't shoot.

1546
02:13:15,437 --> 02:13:17,606
So let's fix bayonets.

1547
02:13:20,736 --> 02:13:23,823
We'll have the advantage
moving down the hill.

1548
02:13:25,534 --> 02:13:28,413
They must be tired if we are.
So fix bayonets.

1549
02:13:28,455 --> 02:13:30,958
Ellis, you take the left wing.
I'll take the right.

1550
02:13:31,001 --> 02:13:33,003
Right wheel forward, the whole regiment.

1551
02:13:33,045 --> 02:13:35,381
- You mean charge?
- Yes, but here's what we do.

1552
02:13:35,424 --> 02:13:37,677
We're going to charge
swinging down the hill.

1553
02:13:37,718 --> 02:13:40,054
Just like we pulled back to the left side...

1554
02:13:40,097 --> 02:13:42,391
we'll swing it down like a door.

1555
02:13:42,434 --> 02:13:45,855
We'll sweep them down the hill
as they come up. Understand?

1556
02:13:45,897 --> 02:13:48,066
- Does everybody understand?
- Yes, sir.

1557
02:13:48,108 --> 02:13:49,902
Ellis, take the left wing.

1558
02:13:49,944 --> 02:13:54,158
When I command, the whole regiment
goes forward swinging down to the right.

1559
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:56,661
All right, sir. Fine.

1560
02:13:58,206 --> 02:14:00,167
Move.

1561
02:14:02,420 --> 02:14:04,673
Bayonets!

1562
02:14:28,958 --> 02:14:31,670
Come on! Let's go! Move!

1563
02:14:31,712 --> 02:14:34,215
Quickly, boys! Quickly!

1564
02:14:42,394 --> 02:14:44,563
Let's go!

1565
02:14:46,316 --> 02:14:48,485
Bayonets!

1566
02:14:56,247 --> 02:14:58,124
Draw!

1567
02:14:58,751 --> 02:15:00,712
Bayonets!

1568
02:15:02,673 --> 02:15:04,300
Left swing, right wheel.

1569
02:15:04,342 --> 02:15:06,428
Right wheel!

1570
02:15:06,929 --> 02:15:08,806
Charge!

1571
02:15:11,435 --> 02:15:13,521
Charge!

1572
02:15:31,130 --> 02:15:33,174
Go!

1573
02:16:48,407 --> 02:16:50,284
The pistol.

1574
02:16:50,743 --> 02:16:52,912
Your prisoner, sir.

1575
02:16:55,584 --> 02:16:57,461
Wait here.

1576
02:17:22,414 --> 02:17:26,211
By God, Colonel,
the boys are still advancing.

1577
02:17:26,252 --> 02:17:29,172
- You better stop them.
- They're on their way to Richmond.

1578
02:17:29,215 --> 02:17:32,177
- Richmond!
- They've done enough for today.

1579
02:17:32,219 --> 02:17:34,722
I want you to meet
this fellow from Alabama.

1580
02:17:34,764 --> 02:17:38,477
Captain Hawkins, this is my brother,
Colonel Chamberlain.

1581
02:17:39,354 --> 02:17:41,231
Sir.

1582
02:17:41,482 --> 02:17:43,276
May I have some water?

1583
02:17:43,318 --> 02:17:45,279
Yes.

1584
02:17:46,031 --> 02:17:48,325
Sure. Tom, get this man a canteen.

1585
02:17:48,367 --> 02:17:51,162
Yes, sir. Right this way.

1586
02:18:10,607 --> 02:18:12,276
How you doing?

1587
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:14,153
Twice!

1588
02:18:14,196 --> 02:18:16,824
Would you believe, for the love of Mary?

1589
02:18:16,866 --> 02:18:18,743
Twice.

1590
02:18:24,168 --> 02:18:28,674
And how are you, Colonel, darling,
this fine day?

1591
02:18:30,218 --> 02:18:32,930
I got it in the armpit.

1592
02:18:32,972 --> 02:18:36,643
For the love of God, in the bloody armpit.

1593
02:18:36,728 --> 02:18:38,230
How is he?

1594
02:18:38,272 --> 02:18:39,356
It's an arm.

1595
02:18:39,398 --> 02:18:42,151
Only an arm. You got to lose something.

1596
02:18:42,194 --> 02:18:43,737
It might as well be an arm.

1597
02:18:43,779 --> 02:18:48,619
I can part with that easier than other
mechanics of nature, and that's the truth.

1598
02:18:53,543 --> 02:18:55,629
I could do with a nip right now.

1599
02:18:55,671 --> 02:18:58,091
I'll see what I can do.

1600
02:18:58,133 --> 02:19:00,594
You do pretty good.

1601
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:06,603
Colonel...

1602
02:19:06,645 --> 02:19:09,607
I'm right here, Buster. I'm right here.

1603
02:19:12,111 --> 02:19:14,489
The army was blessed.

1604
02:19:16,910 --> 02:19:22,000
I want to tell you, just in case...

1605
02:19:24,045 --> 02:19:26,339
that I never served...

1606
02:19:31,347 --> 02:19:34,226
I've never served with a better man.

1607
02:19:40,151 --> 02:19:41,986
Don't worry, sir.

1608
02:19:42,029 --> 02:19:44,991
He'll make it. He's a tough old mick.

1609
02:20:20,209 --> 02:20:24,256
Colonel, sir. It would so honor me.

1610
02:20:34,103 --> 02:20:38,901
Colonel, sir. I've been moving these rebs
with an empty musket.

1611
02:20:39,277 --> 02:20:41,655
That's allowed.

1612
02:20:46,788 --> 02:20:49,375
You're ordered to go to the top
of the big hill.

1613
02:20:49,417 --> 02:20:52,921
- My New Yorkers will take your prisoners.
- Yes, sir.

1614
02:20:52,963 --> 02:20:55,299
We watched from our position above.

1615
02:20:55,342 --> 02:20:58,388
It's the damnedest thing I ever saw.

1616
02:20:59,097 --> 02:21:01,433
May I shake your hand, sir?

1617
02:21:03,687 --> 02:21:09,027
Colonel, one thing.
The name of this place, this hill...

1618
02:21:09,111 --> 02:21:11,113
Has it got a name, this hill?

1619
02:21:11,156 --> 02:21:14,869
This is Little Round Top.
That's the name of the hill you defended.

1620
02:21:14,911 --> 02:21:18,958
The big one you're going up to,
that's Big Round Top.

1621
02:21:19,668 --> 02:21:23,631
Is that so? I guess I'll remember that.

1622
02:21:33,062 --> 02:21:37,318
Ellis, move the men out.
I'm going to go ahead.

1623
02:22:48,628 --> 02:22:50,547
Sam?

1624
02:22:50,631 --> 02:22:52,675
We drugged him, sir.

1625
02:22:52,717 --> 02:22:55,637
It'd be better if he slept.

1626
02:22:56,056 --> 02:22:58,643
Didn't see much.

1627
02:22:58,684 --> 02:23:02,188
The boys went in. Hit the rocks.

1628
02:23:04,943 --> 02:23:07,446
How did it go, Pete?

1629
02:23:09,074 --> 02:23:10,993
Fine, Sam.

1630
02:23:11,035 --> 02:23:13,622
We take those rocks?

1631
02:23:13,914 --> 02:23:15,416
Most of them.

1632
02:23:15,458 --> 02:23:17,669
Worst...

1633
02:23:17,711 --> 02:23:20,715
ground I ever saw.

1634
02:23:20,757 --> 02:23:23,093
You know that?

1635
02:23:24,429 --> 02:23:26,598
They call it...

1636
02:23:26,641 --> 02:23:30,229
Devil's Den. It's a good name for it.

1637
02:23:36,238 --> 02:23:38,157
What casualties?

1638
02:23:38,241 --> 02:23:40,118
Don't know yet.

1639
02:23:41,245 --> 02:23:43,665
Got to give my boys credit.

1640
02:23:47,379 --> 02:23:52,177
You should've let me go to the right.

1641
02:23:53,179 --> 02:23:57,810
We should've gone to the right.

1642
02:23:58,019 --> 02:24:00,731
He needs to rest some.

1643
02:25:01,735 --> 02:25:04,363
You summoned me, sir?

1644
02:25:05,448 --> 02:25:07,617
Harrison.

1645
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:11,498
I did.

1646
02:25:13,835 --> 02:25:15,462
I've got some night work.

1647
02:25:15,504 --> 02:25:16,922
Are you up to it?

1648
02:25:16,965 --> 02:25:20,094
"All the world will be in love with night...

1649
02:25:20,136 --> 02:25:23,724
"And pay no worship to the garish sun."

1650
02:25:24,392 --> 02:25:29,190
When this is all over,
I do look forward to seeing you on stage.

1651
02:25:30,442 --> 02:25:33,321
What are the General's wishes?

1652
02:25:39,914 --> 02:25:43,377
I want you to go out on the right,
scout the federal position.

1653
02:25:43,419 --> 02:25:46,965
Their condition, what they've got
in reserve, what they're bringing up.

1654
02:25:47,007 --> 02:25:50,094
It'll probably take all night.
But I want it right and clear.

1655
02:25:50,137 --> 02:25:52,765
- Your obedient servant, General.
- Good.

1656
02:25:52,807 --> 02:25:57,522
Now, Harrison, it'll be dangerous.
And I do appreciate this.

1657
02:25:57,814 --> 02:26:00,067
Thank you, sir.

1658
02:26:00,485 --> 02:26:03,531
But I must confess,
the thing that bothers me about this job...

1659
02:26:03,573 --> 02:26:05,659
is the absence of an audience.

1660
02:26:05,701 --> 02:26:07,662
When you do it right, no one knows it.

1661
02:26:07,704 --> 02:26:10,708
Nobody ever watches your work.
Do you see?

1662
02:26:11,292 --> 02:26:14,004
That's very hard on an actor.

1663
02:26:19,011 --> 02:26:20,888
Go on.

1664
02:26:41,502 --> 02:26:43,838
General, I'm very glad to see you well.

1665
02:26:43,880 --> 02:26:47,593
I've just come by for my orders, sir.

1666
02:26:53,978 --> 02:26:57,274
It would appear
that General Stuart has returned.

1667
02:26:58,609 --> 02:27:00,945
The prodigal son.

1668
02:27:28,903 --> 02:27:32,282
It was very close this afternoon.

1669
02:27:35,829 --> 02:27:37,122
Sir?

1670
02:27:37,164 --> 02:27:39,375
They nearly broke.

1671
02:27:39,584 --> 02:27:42,171
I could feel them breaking.

1672
02:27:42,505 --> 02:27:47,011
There for a moment I thought I saw
our flags go up the hill.

1673
02:27:55,273 --> 02:27:57,359
It wasn't that close.

1674
02:27:57,735 --> 02:28:01,824
The attacks were not properly
coordinated. I do not know why.

1675
02:28:01,866 --> 02:28:04,953
And nevertheless, we nearly won the day.

1676
02:28:05,496 --> 02:28:09,585
I could see a clear road
all the way to Washington.

1677
02:28:14,217 --> 02:28:16,678
How is it with General Hood?

1678
02:28:18,223 --> 02:28:21,060
I think he'll live. May lose an arm.

1679
02:28:21,102 --> 02:28:22,896
Dear God.

1680
02:28:22,938 --> 02:28:26,025
I couldn't spare General Hood.

1681
02:28:26,860 --> 02:28:30,573
So many good men were lost this day.

1682
02:28:31,408 --> 02:28:33,285
Sir?

1683
02:28:34,162 --> 02:28:37,625
Lo did take the peach orchard
and wheat field.

1684
02:28:37,667 --> 02:28:40,629
But he couldn't get up that ridge.

1685
02:28:40,755 --> 02:28:46,262
And Hood, he seized the Devil's Den,
but he couldn't take the little rocky hill.

1686
02:28:46,763 --> 02:28:50,768
The federals still hold the heights.
And they're reinforced.

1687
02:28:51,270 --> 02:28:53,189
General?

1688
02:28:53,732 --> 02:28:57,111
That way around to the right is still open.

1689
02:29:03,663 --> 02:29:06,083
I will think on it, General.

1690
02:29:06,124 --> 02:29:09,921
We have enough artillery
for one more good fight, but just one.

1691
02:29:09,963 --> 02:29:11,339
I know.

1692
02:29:11,382 --> 02:29:13,259
Let me think on it.

1693
02:29:13,301 --> 02:29:16,054
- General...
- I am very glad to see you well.

1694
02:29:16,097 --> 02:29:18,767
We will speak again in the morning.

1695
02:29:40,215 --> 02:29:42,760
You know, hearing you talk
about monkeys and trees...

1696
02:29:42,802 --> 02:29:45,639
I remember the time
during a cannonade on the peninsula.

1697
02:29:45,681 --> 02:29:48,309
There was one tree
for the men to hide behind.

1698
02:29:48,351 --> 02:29:52,231
It was a skinny little tree
and the boys, they fell in behind it...

1699
02:29:52,273 --> 02:29:55,694
in a long thin line
which ruled just like a pigtail.

1700
02:29:55,737 --> 02:29:57,781
It swayed to one side, then the other.

1701
02:29:57,823 --> 02:30:00,201
A shell came this way,
the line swayed that way.

1702
02:30:00,243 --> 02:30:02,913
A cannonball came that way,
the line swayed this way.

1703
02:30:02,955 --> 02:30:04,331
It was a thing to see.

1704
02:30:04,374 --> 02:30:08,546
George, what has that got to do
with what we're talking about?

1705
02:30:13,888 --> 02:30:15,765
General.

1706
02:30:17,559 --> 02:30:20,771
Carry on, gentlemen.
Don't let me interrupt the revival.

1707
02:30:20,814 --> 02:30:23,401
General, you're just in time.

1708
02:30:23,651 --> 02:30:28,032
I've been trying to persuade George here
of the modern, scientific...

1709
02:30:28,074 --> 02:30:30,786
theories of Charles Darwin.
The theory of evolution.

1710
02:30:30,828 --> 02:30:34,625
The notion that all mankind
is descended from the ape.

1711
02:30:34,667 --> 02:30:36,586
He does not subscribe.

1712
02:30:36,628 --> 02:30:38,046
- Is that so?
- I do not.

1713
02:30:38,089 --> 02:30:42,136
I've ordered General Armistead to stop
filling his head with heathen blasphemies.

1714
02:30:42,178 --> 02:30:45,057
Now, you are to devote
your reflective moments to study...

1715
02:30:45,099 --> 02:30:47,519
in the matters of military significance.

1716
02:30:47,561 --> 02:30:48,937
Ordered me.

1717
02:30:48,979 --> 02:30:52,734
Or perhaps appropriating
some more of this fine whiskey here.

1718
02:30:52,776 --> 02:30:54,111
Absolutely.

1719
02:30:54,153 --> 02:30:56,072
- Would you care for?
- No, thank you.

1720
02:30:56,114 --> 02:30:59,410
Surely the commanding general
shares my deep feelings of disgust...

1721
02:30:59,452 --> 02:31:02,164
at this simian suggestion.

1722
02:31:03,542 --> 02:31:08,131
I suppose there's some pretty smart folk
that take Darwin for the Gospel.

1723
02:31:08,173 --> 02:31:12,971
They would not be invited to join
George's ever-shrinking circle of friends.

1724
02:31:13,013 --> 02:31:15,057
General Longstreet, sir.

1725
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:18,813
I intend to lay this matter to rest
for once and for all time.

1726
02:31:18,855 --> 02:31:20,732
Good.

1727
02:31:25,531 --> 02:31:30,663
Perhaps there are those among you who
think that you are descended from an ape.

1728
02:31:31,665 --> 02:31:34,043
I suppose it's possible
there are those of you...

1729
02:31:34,085 --> 02:31:36,755
who believe that I'm descended
from an ape, but...

1730
02:31:36,797 --> 02:31:39,926
I challenge the man to step forward...

1731
02:31:40,052 --> 02:31:43,306
who believes that General Lee
is descended from an ape.

1732
02:31:43,348 --> 02:31:45,559
- Here, here.
- Not likely.

1733
02:31:46,019 --> 02:31:51,526
All science trembles before
the searing logic of your fiery intellect.

1734
02:32:01,583 --> 02:32:05,922
So, exactly how many of your relatives
are there that are apes?

1735
02:32:15,269 --> 02:32:18,148
What do you hear about Sam Hood?

1736
02:32:18,190 --> 02:32:20,568
He may lose an arm.

1737
02:32:21,319 --> 02:32:24,740
Dick Garnett isn't fit. Can't hardly walk.

1738
02:32:24,782 --> 02:32:28,871
Thing is, if there's a fight,
he can't stand to stay out of it.

1739
02:32:28,913 --> 02:32:31,792
But if you ordered him to stay out...

1740
02:32:34,755 --> 02:32:37,717
I don't suppose you could do that.

1741
02:33:08,136 --> 02:33:10,472
That boy can sing.

1742
02:33:11,057 --> 02:33:14,061
That's "Kathleen Mavourneen".

1743
02:33:19,527 --> 02:33:22,614
What do you hear about Hancock?

1744
02:33:22,656 --> 02:33:24,950
Ran into him today.

1745
02:33:26,454 --> 02:33:28,748
He's out there about a mile or so.

1746
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:33,463
Just a mile or so. And he was tough.

1747
02:33:33,505 --> 02:33:35,215
Very tough today.

1748
02:33:35,258 --> 02:33:37,511
He's the best they got.

1749
02:33:37,553 --> 02:33:40,849
God don't make them any better.
And that's a fact.

1750
02:33:45,397 --> 02:33:48,985
I'd like to go over to see him
as soon as I can.

1751
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:53,992
The last time I saw Winn...

1752
02:33:55,370 --> 02:33:59,459
he played that song. That very song.

1753
02:34:00,335 --> 02:34:04,591
Back in California,
we were all together for the last time.

1754
02:34:04,633 --> 02:34:07,178
Before we broke up.

1755
02:34:07,303 --> 02:34:09,931
Spring of 1861.

1756
02:34:16,525 --> 02:34:18,235
Myra Hancock.

1757
02:34:18,277 --> 02:34:21,573
Do you remember Myra, Hancock's wife?

1758
02:34:21,615 --> 02:34:23,409
Beautiful woman.

1759
02:34:23,451 --> 02:34:27,331
Most perfect woman I ever saw.

1760
02:34:29,126 --> 02:34:31,546
They were a beautiful couple.

1761
02:34:32,548 --> 02:34:34,425
Beautiful.

1762
02:34:37,221 --> 02:34:40,016
Garnett was with me that night.

1763
02:34:41,268 --> 02:34:45,899
A lot of fellows from the old outfit.
People standing around singing...

1764
02:34:45,942 --> 02:34:47,903
in the blue uniform.

1765
02:34:47,945 --> 02:34:51,575
We were leaving the next day.

1766
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:55,246
Some going north. Some going south.

1767
02:34:56,332 --> 02:34:58,460
Splitting up.

1768
02:35:00,838 --> 02:35:03,299
A soldier's farewell.

1769
02:35:03,383 --> 02:35:06,220
"Goodbye. Good luck.

1770
02:35:06,388 --> 02:35:08,808
"I'll see you in hell."

1771
02:35:09,434 --> 02:35:11,812
Do you remember that?

1772
02:35:18,989 --> 02:35:21,868
Towards the end of the evening...

1773
02:35:22,244 --> 02:35:25,373
we all sat around the piano.

1774
02:35:26,082 --> 02:35:29,128
And Myra played...

1775
02:35:29,504 --> 02:35:33,342
that song there,
that was the one she played.

1776
02:35:35,471 --> 02:35:39,268
Maybe for years, maybe forever...

1777
02:35:41,479 --> 02:35:43,815
I'll never forget that.

1778
02:35:48,990 --> 02:35:51,702
You know how it was, Pete.

1779
02:35:59,630 --> 02:36:01,674
Winn was like a brother to me.

1780
02:36:01,716 --> 02:36:03,593
Remember?

1781
02:36:05,013 --> 02:36:07,725
Towards the end of the evening...

1782
02:36:09,811 --> 02:36:11,855
things got a little rough.

1783
02:36:11,898 --> 02:36:14,902
We all began to...

1784
02:36:19,074 --> 02:36:21,953
There were a lot of tears.

1785
02:36:24,749 --> 02:36:27,210
I went over to Hancock.

1786
02:36:27,962 --> 02:36:30,882
I took him by the shoulder. I said:

1787
02:36:33,345 --> 02:36:35,598
"So help me...

1788
02:36:36,099 --> 02:36:39,562
"if I ever raise my hand against you...

1789
02:36:39,604 --> 02:36:41,940
"may God strike me dead."

1790
02:36:49,743 --> 02:36:52,288
I haven't seen him since.

1791
02:36:52,747 --> 02:36:55,083
He was at Malvern Hill...

1792
02:36:55,126 --> 02:36:59,966
White Oak Swamp,
Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg.

1793
02:37:03,805 --> 02:37:08,186
One of these days
I will see him, I'm afraid.

1794
02:37:08,645 --> 02:37:11,023
Across that...

1795
02:37:11,316 --> 02:37:14,904
small deadly space.

1796
02:37:22,707 --> 02:37:26,378
I thought about sitting this one out.

1797
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:28,840
But I can't do that.

1798
02:37:29,717 --> 02:37:32,637
That wouldn't be right either.

1799
02:37:38,730 --> 02:37:40,607
I guess not.

1800
02:37:45,197 --> 02:37:47,491
Thank you, Peter.

1801
02:37:51,164 --> 02:37:53,834
I had to talk about that.

1802
02:38:00,552 --> 02:38:04,349
I'm sending Myra Hancock...

1803
02:38:04,975 --> 02:38:08,813
a small package to be opened...

1804
02:38:08,898 --> 02:38:11,568
in the event of my death.

1805
02:38:16,158 --> 02:38:18,286
You'll drop by and see her...

1806
02:38:18,328 --> 02:38:20,539
after this is over.

1807
02:38:20,581 --> 02:38:22,834
Won't you, Pete?

1808
02:38:31,096 --> 02:38:33,098
Thank you.

1809
02:38:35,894 --> 02:38:38,439
What day is it now, Major?

1810
02:38:40,902 --> 02:38:43,030
It's long after midnight, sir.

1811
02:38:43,071 --> 02:38:44,614
It's already Friday.

1812
02:38:44,657 --> 02:38:47,995
- Friday, July 3?
- Yes, sir.

1813
02:38:48,287 --> 02:38:51,291
Then tomorrow is the Fourth of July.

1814
02:38:51,792 --> 02:38:54,086
Independence Day.

1815
02:38:56,465 --> 02:39:00,428
- I'd quite forgotten.
- The good Lord has a sense of humor.

1816
02:39:00,471 --> 02:39:02,765
I'm very sorry to keep you up so late.

1817
02:39:02,808 --> 02:39:04,310
It is my pleasure.

1818
02:39:04,352 --> 02:39:06,897
We should have a larger staff.

1819
02:39:06,939 --> 02:39:09,484
I'd be offended, sir.

1820
02:39:09,526 --> 02:39:11,069
I can do the work.

1821
02:39:11,111 --> 02:39:13,113
Very well.

1822
02:39:14,700 --> 02:39:18,204
General Stuart is waiting to see you, sir.

1823
02:39:18,246 --> 02:39:22,084
- Shall I bring him in?
- Of course.

1824
02:39:24,255 --> 02:39:26,341
- Major?
- Yes, sir.

1825
02:39:26,383 --> 02:39:30,054
General Stuart and I
must not be disturbed.

1826
02:39:30,514 --> 02:39:33,351
- Very well, sir.
- Thank you.

1827
02:39:36,063 --> 02:39:39,359
General Lee will see you now, sir.

1828
02:39:50,292 --> 02:39:52,545
You wish to see me, sir.

1829
02:39:56,926 --> 02:40:03,310
It is the opinion of some excellent officers
that you have let us all down.

1830
02:40:03,394 --> 02:40:06,273
Sir, if you will please tell me
who these gentlemen are?

1831
02:40:06,315 --> 02:40:08,568
There will be none of that.
There is no time.

1832
02:40:08,610 --> 02:40:10,696
I ask that I be allowed to defend my...

1833
02:40:10,738 --> 02:40:13,032
There is no time.

1834
02:40:14,034 --> 02:40:15,953
General Stuart.

1835
02:40:18,165 --> 02:40:22,212
Your mission was to free this army...

1836
02:40:22,254 --> 02:40:24,006
from the enemy cavalry.

1837
02:40:24,048 --> 02:40:27,678
And to report any movement
by the enemy's main body.

1838
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:29,931
That mission was not fulfilled.

1839
02:40:29,974 --> 02:40:31,726
You left here...

1840
02:40:31,768 --> 02:40:35,857
with no word of your movement
or movement of the enemy for days.

1841
02:40:35,899 --> 02:40:38,569
Meanwhile we were engaged
and drawn into battle...

1842
02:40:38,611 --> 02:40:42,199
without adequate knowledge
of the enemy's strength or position.

1843
02:40:42,241 --> 02:40:44,076
Without knowledge of the ground.

1844
02:40:44,119 --> 02:40:48,500
So it is only by God's grace
that we did not meet disaster here.

1845
02:40:48,542 --> 02:40:50,377
General Lee, there were reasons.

1846
02:40:50,419 --> 02:40:54,216
Perhaps you misunderstood my orders.

1847
02:40:54,467 --> 02:40:57,596
Perhaps I did not make myself clear.

1848
02:40:57,638 --> 02:41:02,353
Well, sir, this must be made very clear.

1849
02:41:02,395 --> 02:41:03,938
You, sir...

1850
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:07,818
with your cavalry,
are the eyes of this army.

1851
02:41:07,861 --> 02:41:10,865
Without your cavalry, we are made blind.

1852
02:41:10,907 --> 02:41:13,118
That has already happened once.

1853
02:41:13,160 --> 02:41:17,499
It must never, never happen again.

1854
02:41:25,678 --> 02:41:29,683
- Since I no longer hold the General's...
- I told you there is no time for that!

1855
02:41:29,725 --> 02:41:31,686
There is no time.

1856
02:41:47,668 --> 02:41:51,006
There is another fight coming tomorrow
and we need you.

1857
02:41:51,047 --> 02:41:54,093
We need every man. God knows.

1858
02:41:56,055 --> 02:41:59,184
You must take what I have told you...

1859
02:41:59,226 --> 02:42:03,148
and learn from it as a man does.

1860
02:42:03,899 --> 02:42:05,484
There has been a mistake.

1861
02:42:05,526 --> 02:42:08,864
It will not happen again.
I know your quality.

1862
02:42:08,906 --> 02:42:12,244
You are one of the finest
cavalry officers I have ever known...

1863
02:42:12,286 --> 02:42:16,625
and your service to this army
has been invaluable.

1864
02:42:22,008 --> 02:42:25,054
Let us speak no more of this.

1865
02:42:33,024 --> 02:42:37,029
The matter is concluded.
Goodnight, General.

1866
02:43:16,711 --> 02:43:19,005
Colonel, sir.

1867
02:43:22,344 --> 02:43:24,847
What are you doing up here?

1868
02:43:24,889 --> 02:43:27,684
I'm just resting my leg.

1869
02:43:31,524 --> 02:43:33,693
All right.

1870
02:43:35,446 --> 02:43:38,241
You sure can see a ways from here.

1871
02:43:39,535 --> 02:43:41,829
Where have you been?

1872
02:43:41,872 --> 02:43:43,749
We sent out a detail...

1873
02:43:43,791 --> 02:43:46,294
and found some more departed souls
down there...

1874
02:43:46,337 --> 02:43:49,591
and they were carrying coffee
for which they had no more use for.

1875
02:43:49,633 --> 02:43:51,510
You're a ghoul.

1876
02:43:55,892 --> 02:43:58,854
You did real good yesterday.

1877
02:43:59,272 --> 02:44:02,443
The way them rebs just kept coming.

1878
02:44:03,277 --> 02:44:05,989
You had to admire them.

1879
02:44:07,158 --> 02:44:09,828
You think they'll come again today?

1880
02:44:10,162 --> 02:44:13,625
It don't look like they're planning to leave.

1881
02:44:13,918 --> 02:44:15,628
We don't have but 100 men.

1882
02:44:15,670 --> 02:44:18,549
Even with the whole flock
from the Second Maine.

1883
02:44:18,591 --> 02:44:21,094
This position's good.

1884
02:44:26,143 --> 02:44:28,145
Diversion.

1885
02:44:29,607 --> 02:44:31,276
Go alert the pickets.

1886
02:44:31,317 --> 02:44:34,363
That may be a diversion.
They may be coming this way again.

1887
02:44:34,405 --> 02:44:36,324
Where's the ammunition I asked for?

1888
02:44:36,366 --> 02:44:39,245
Go check the hospital, see about the boys.
Check on Buster.

1889
02:44:39,287 --> 02:44:40,997
Very well, sir.

1890
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:42,667
We need another runner.

1891
02:44:42,709 --> 02:44:47,465
I keep going up and down this hill,
my legs are going to fall off.

1892
02:44:52,306 --> 02:44:54,517
- Good morning, General.
- Good morning, sir.

1893
02:44:54,559 --> 02:44:58,230
- Ride with me, if you will.
- Yes, sir.

1894
02:45:27,481 --> 02:45:31,152
General Longstreet, you have
General Pickett now and he is fresh.

1895
02:45:31,194 --> 02:45:33,655
I want you to bring your corps forward.

1896
02:45:33,698 --> 02:45:38,371
Take those heights in the center
and split the federal line.

1897
02:45:45,506 --> 02:45:48,718
My two divisions, Hood's and McLaws'...

1898
02:45:48,761 --> 02:45:52,808
They executed a forced march yesterday
and went straight into the fight.

1899
02:45:52,850 --> 02:45:55,478
Lost half of their strength.

1900
02:45:55,521 --> 02:45:57,857
Sustained 50% casualties, sir.

1901
02:45:57,899 --> 02:46:00,903
They are tired and need rest.

1902
02:46:02,072 --> 02:46:03,907
There are...

1903
02:46:03,949 --> 02:46:07,704
now three federal corps on those two
rocky hills on our right flank.

1904
02:46:07,746 --> 02:46:10,333
If I move all my people forward...

1905
02:46:10,375 --> 02:46:12,878
we won't have a flank at all.

1906
02:46:12,920 --> 02:46:15,882
They'll simply swing around and crush us.

1907
02:46:17,302 --> 02:46:20,139
They are well entrenched up there.
They aim to fight.

1908
02:46:20,181 --> 02:46:23,393
They got good artillery and plenty of it.

1909
02:46:23,435 --> 02:46:27,357
Sir, any attack we make
will be uphill over open ground.

1910
02:46:27,733 --> 02:46:31,196
How do we communicate?
How do we coordinate attack?

1911
02:46:31,238 --> 02:46:33,991
They're all massed together,
damned near in a circle.

1912
02:46:34,034 --> 02:46:36,203
Good interior lines.

1913
02:46:36,245 --> 02:46:40,083
Anywhere we hit them,
they'll bring up reinforcements in minutes.

1914
02:46:40,126 --> 02:46:44,590
But we try to bring up support,
it has to come from miles away.

1915
02:46:44,632 --> 02:46:47,260
Their cannon will see every move.

1916
02:46:47,762 --> 02:46:51,517
Hell, their cannon are looking down
on us right now.

1917
02:46:51,559 --> 02:46:54,271
In the center, they will break.

1918
02:46:54,772 --> 02:46:56,691
They will break in the center.

1919
02:46:56,733 --> 02:47:00,655
They'll be gaining men from all directions,
guns by the thousands...

1920
02:47:00,697 --> 02:47:04,786
and Richmond has nothing left
to send us. So, if we stay, we fight.

1921
02:47:04,828 --> 02:47:08,541
If we retreat now,
we will have fought here for two days...

1922
02:47:08,583 --> 02:47:12,087
and will leave knowing
we could not drive him off.

1923
02:47:12,130 --> 02:47:16,970
And I have never yet left the enemy
in command of the field. No, sir.

1924
02:47:17,012 --> 02:47:19,849
Retreat is no longer an option.

1925
02:47:20,183 --> 02:47:22,603
The enemy has been attacked
on both wings.

1926
02:47:22,645 --> 02:47:24,147
He has reinforced there...

1927
02:47:24,189 --> 02:47:27,443
and is strongest there on the wings.
The hills and the rocks.

1928
02:47:27,485 --> 02:47:29,404
So the weak point is in the center.

1929
02:47:29,446 --> 02:47:31,532
They have command of the high ground.

1930
02:47:31,574 --> 02:47:34,202
But in that long slope, you see there?

1931
02:47:34,245 --> 02:47:38,501
The long slope in the center,
there's where he's most vulnerable.

1932
02:47:38,542 --> 02:47:43,382
General Pickett's Virginians
are the only people not yet engaged. Yes?

1933
02:47:44,217 --> 02:47:47,596
With General Longstreet in command,
my old warhorse...

1934
02:47:47,639 --> 02:47:50,851
meeting the enemy face to face
on ground of his choosing...

1935
02:47:50,893 --> 02:47:53,897
and with honor, we will prevail.

1936
02:48:12,925 --> 02:48:16,179
Sir, a courier from Colonel Rice.

1937
02:48:18,850 --> 02:48:20,936
Colonel Chamberlain.

1938
02:48:23,607 --> 02:48:25,234
That's some climb, sir.

1939
02:48:25,276 --> 02:48:27,362
My men need rations, Lieutenant.

1940
02:48:27,404 --> 02:48:31,618
Colonel Rice has entrusted me to tell you
that you're relieved, sir.

1941
02:48:32,369 --> 02:48:33,579
Relieved?

1942
02:48:33,621 --> 02:48:37,668
Fresh troops are on their way up
and they'll take over here, sir.

1943
02:48:37,710 --> 02:48:40,547
Colonel Rice wants to give
your people a rest.

1944
02:48:40,589 --> 02:48:43,259
He wants you to fall back,
and I'm to show you the way.

1945
02:48:43,301 --> 02:48:45,470
Fall back.

1946
02:48:47,307 --> 02:48:49,601
Ellis, have the men fall in.
We're moving out.

1947
02:48:49,644 --> 02:48:51,605
Yes, sir.

1948
02:48:51,647 --> 02:48:53,649
Where are we going?

1949
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:55,860
Lovely spot.

1950
02:48:55,903 --> 02:48:58,448
Very quiet. Safest place on the battlefield.

1951
02:48:58,490 --> 02:49:01,202
Right smack-dab in the center.

1952
02:49:45,515 --> 02:49:47,559
Yes, sir, General.

1953
02:49:47,601 --> 02:49:49,770
We will attack the center.

1954
02:49:49,813 --> 02:49:52,859
But I think you are right about the flank.

1955
02:49:53,276 --> 02:49:57,365
Hood and McLaws were both very badly
damaged yesterday.

1956
02:49:57,407 --> 02:50:01,913
I'll give you two other divisions:
General Pettigrew and General Trimble.

1957
02:50:01,955 --> 02:50:03,582
They are stronger and rested.

1958
02:50:03,624 --> 02:50:08,046
Now, you will have nearly three divisions
at your command, including Pickett.

1959
02:50:08,089 --> 02:50:11,927
Your objective will be
that clump of trees yonder.

1960
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:16,559
The attack will be preceded
by massed artillery.

1961
02:50:16,601 --> 02:50:20,147
We'll concentrate all of our guns
on that one small area.

1962
02:50:20,189 --> 02:50:23,610
A "feu d'enfer", as Napoleon would call it.

1963
02:50:23,653 --> 02:50:27,533
When the artillery has had its effect,
your charge will break the line.

1964
02:50:27,575 --> 02:50:31,413
You will have nearly 15,000 men
at your command, General.

1965
02:50:31,455 --> 02:50:33,583
You may begin whenever you're ready.

1966
02:50:33,625 --> 02:50:36,629
But plan it well.
Do plan it well, I pray you, sir.

1967
02:50:36,671 --> 02:50:38,757
We stake everything on this.

1968
02:50:38,799 --> 02:50:41,469
With your permission.

1969
02:50:45,350 --> 02:50:47,937
Sir, I've been a soldier all my life.

1970
02:50:47,979 --> 02:50:51,942
I have served from the ranks on up.
You know my service.

1971
02:50:55,490 --> 02:50:59,912
I must tell you now,
I believe this attack will fail.

1972
02:51:03,960 --> 02:51:08,132
No 15,000 men ever made
can take that ridge.

1973
02:51:08,174 --> 02:51:10,886
It's a distance of more than a mile
over open ground.

1974
02:51:10,928 --> 02:51:13,681
When the men come out of the trees
they will be...

1975
02:51:13,724 --> 02:51:16,978
under fire of Yankee artillery
from all over the field.

1976
02:51:17,020 --> 02:51:18,855
Those are Hancock's boys.

1977
02:51:18,898 --> 02:51:23,696
And now they have the stone wall
like we did at Fredericksburg.

1978
02:51:23,738 --> 02:51:26,491
We do our duty, General.

1979
02:51:26,534 --> 02:51:29,371
We do what we must do.

1980
02:51:29,580 --> 02:51:31,457
Yes, sir.

1981
02:51:32,542 --> 02:51:37,173
Colonel Alexander is in charge
of the artillery and he is very good.

1982
02:51:37,550 --> 02:51:42,515
We will depend on him to drive them off
the ridge before your divisions get there.

1983
02:51:42,557 --> 02:51:45,644
And the men will know what to do.
All 15,000...

1984
02:51:45,686 --> 02:51:49,858
will concentrate squarely on the center
of that line. That lower ridge there.

1985
02:51:49,901 --> 02:51:52,279
The line is not strong there.

1986
02:51:52,321 --> 02:51:55,825
General Meade has great strength
on both flanks.

1987
02:51:55,867 --> 02:51:57,869
He must be weak in the center.

1988
02:51:57,912 --> 02:52:02,209
I estimate his strength in the center
not to be more than 5,000 men.

1989
02:52:02,251 --> 02:52:07,007
And Colonel Alexander's artillery
will break them up like at Fredericksburg.

1990
02:52:07,050 --> 02:52:09,637
- Yes, sir.
- Farewell.

1991
02:52:17,189 --> 02:52:19,692
What are you thinking, General?

1992
02:52:24,283 --> 02:52:26,536
Pickett's division is from my corps.

1993
02:52:26,578 --> 02:52:30,416
But the other two units
are of A.P. Hill's corps.

1994
02:52:33,963 --> 02:52:36,842
Shouldn't General Hill lead the attack?

1995
02:52:37,385 --> 02:52:39,262
Say again?

1996
02:52:40,473 --> 02:52:43,852
Shouldn't General Hill lead the attack?

1997
02:52:52,323 --> 02:52:54,325
My apologies, sir.

1998
02:52:58,331 --> 02:53:01,168
I've always been very cautious.

1999
02:53:01,210 --> 02:53:02,503
Very cautious.

2000
02:53:02,546 --> 02:53:05,341
There is no one I trust more.

2001
02:53:12,226 --> 02:53:14,729
If we can take that ridge...

2002
02:53:14,771 --> 02:53:17,942
We can. And we will.
