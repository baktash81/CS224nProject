1
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,751
Unbelievable riches
had accumulated over hundreds of years

2
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,629
accumulated behind the walls
of sodom and gomorrah,

3
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,049
in these cities of sin
and vice without borders.

4
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,969
The greed for power and wealth
had also gripped the desert tribes,

5
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:05,821
which became more and more threatening.

6
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,349
Your mighty leader
was the prince of the Helamites.

7
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,186
Even if so many subordinates
are loyal to your prince,

8
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,896
our attack may only take place

9
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,940
when my horse troop
has returned.

10
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,442
Tell your prince,
I'm looking forward to the day,

11
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,861
at which we shall
shed the blood of our enemies.

12
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:22,154
I thank you, prince.

13
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:25,825
Beware
of the sodomite scouts.

14
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,676
There she is! After her!

15
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,979
Faster!

16
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:57,231
- Faster!
- Stop!

17
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,316
Stop!

18
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,527
- Stop!
- No!

19
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,075
- Get off your horse! Get down!
- No.

20
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,327
Who sent you
to the Elamites?

21
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:12,997
- Let go of me!
- Who sent you?

22
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,041
Tamar,
the prince's secret messenger.

23
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,333
She will talk.

24
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,546
We must
bring news to the prince.

25
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,510
While in sodom and gomorrah
betrayal and intrigue reigned,

26
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:30,222
a peaceful people wandered
through the desert, the hebrews.

27
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:33,267
You were looking for
pasture for your cattle

28
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,227
and for food for yourself.

29
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,731
The tribes of Abraham and lot were together

30
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,858
and the country
could not stand it

31
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,320
that they dwelt together,
for their number was great.

32
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,322
Abraham said to lot:

33
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:50,826
If you want to go to the left,
I'll walk to the right,

34
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:54,246
or if you want to go to the right,
I'll walk to the left.

35
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:58,709
And lot voted and went with all
his people against the Jordan valley.

36
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,676
Go back to lot,
maybe he'll carry you.

37
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:39,832
Oh, sir.

38
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,087
If it is your will that my people
should take this arduous journey

39
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,340
so help me not to show any tiredness.

40
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,343
Give our bodies strength for the future,

41
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,095
to overcome all the hardship.

42
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,973
First of all the thirst that plagues us.

43
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,141
Help us, oh lord,

44
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,850
to conquer the fear

45
00:07:58,602 --> 00:07:59,687
that gnaws at our hearts.

46
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:03,440
The way was long and arduous.

47
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,152
Thirst, hunger and exhaustion
attacked lot's people.

48
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:11,740
Hopelessness spread
and sowed discord.

49
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,952
Only the sick
should drink from it, says lot.

50
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,745
Aren't you sick, Isaac?

51
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,832
- Are you feeling well?
- Cut them open.

52
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:24,086
Come on, let the cool water run over
your hands, your face.

53
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,090
- Wet your lips and mouth.
- No, no, please.

54
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:32,469
If lot gets angry, then
you say: But, lot, I'm sick.

55
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,723
Look, I'm dying of thirst. Here.

56
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,266
- No.
- Take it.

57
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,643
- No, no. I beg you.
- Come on.

58
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,186
- Come on.
- No.

59
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,696
Hold on, Isaac. Stop.

60
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,326
Please let me drink.
I'm sick, lot.

61
00:08:56,618 --> 00:09:00,164
The water is for the sick.
Please give me a drink.

62
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,917
- Help him.
- Who made him sick?

63
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:08,839
Who got him so far that
he can't control himself?

64
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,092
- Lot is to blame. Let us repent.
- Repent?

65
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,970
Now that we
are at our destination in a few days?

66
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:16,889
Maybe in a few hours.

67
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,517
He is incapable of leading us.
We have endured enough.

68
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,144
He's right.

69
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:26,523
It is not customary to decide
such questions with a weapon.

70
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,108
Give orders that we repent.

71
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,862
We elders have chosen lot
as our guide, melchior.

72
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,699
- You have a duty to obey.
- This staff belongs in my hand.

73
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:37,534
I'd better guide you.

74
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:52,549
Since melchior is keen on action,
he can accompany me on a corridor.

75
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:55,552
We'll investigate
how far we still have it.

76
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,304
Come on, melchior.

77
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,107
Water.

78
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,109
Come. To drink.

79
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:11,860
Wait.

80
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,823
Where there is water in the desert,
there is danger.

81
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:40,639
- Back with you!
- Let them come closer.

82
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,642
- What are you doing here?
- We hope to find water.

83
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:48,105
There is no water in this oasis,
not for 3 years.

84
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,774
- You are the hebrews?
- Yes.

85
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:54,528
Our scouts have informed us
of your coming.

86
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,532
They say your men have beards
but you are shaved.

87
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,824
Why?

88
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,703
During the period of mourning
our men shave.

89
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,538
Are you grieving? To whom?

90
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,708
- For a favorite?
- My wife.

91
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,505
The wife. A wife is easy
to replace, am I right?

92
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:18,051
Where can we get water?
Many are sick with thirst.

93
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:21,638
Maybe they
need not only water, but also salt.

94
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,892
Salt? Salt makes you even more thirsty.

95
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,270
It's a secret
as old as our city.

96
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:33,317
When one is weak and exhausted
from thirst and heat, one needs salt.

97
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,779
Unfortunately I gave away my salt
for the slaves.

98
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:40,240
I bought her
for the queen.

99
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:43,160
It cost 4 times its weight
in salt.

100
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,163
Poor creatures.

101
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,458
Am I a poor creature too?

102
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,377
Is your heart broken too
because of me?

103
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,213
I'm a slave too,

104
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:56,548
the top
of the royal body slaves.

105
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,135
To own people as property
is wrong, evil.

106
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,511
Evil?

107
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,473
What kind of views do you have?

108
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,017
Where I come from,
there's nothing wrong with it.

109
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,062
Everything that gives pleasure
is good.

110
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,022
Where are you from?

111
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:14,066
Not from far away.

112
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:16,276
Straight ahead for a while.

113
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,111
Sodom and gomorrah.

114
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:28,497
You people of sodom and gomorrah,
beware.

115
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,126
Your sins
cry out for retribution.

116
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:38,840
You buy men and women
as if they were made of stone.

117
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,345
You treat them
as objects of your pleasure

118
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,431
or like machines for your work.

119
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,519
You force them to mine your precious
mineral wealth,

120
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,811
the white salt.

121
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,565
Just to increase the prosperity
of your nefarious cities.

122
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,824
You owe all your power and prosperity
to the salt.

123
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,452
And you buy this salt
with the blood of your slaves.

124
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,080
Listen to me people of sodom.

125
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,041
The old fool!

126
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,503
Shut him up!
I have to warn the prince.

127
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,171
Hey. Hey.

128
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,260
One day
they will destroy you,

129
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:27,973
just as your prince would even destroy his
own sister.

130
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,644
Watch your tongue. You have
publicly blasphemed the queen's brother.

131
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:35,272
How can this person
demand submission?

132
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,691
How dare you
speak of it?

133
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:44,573
You have the monopoly
on the precious raw material,

134
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,242
which in Africa
is more valuable than gold.

135
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:48,702
On the salt.

136
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,704
You use this material,

137
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,458
in order to keep an entire continent
cruelly in a stranglehold.

138
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,920
You exchange your salt for
gems, fragrances and slaves,

139
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:04,301
just for the insatiable greed of your
queen and her nefarious brother

140
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,802
to breastfeed.

141
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,589
We hurried
to warn you.

142
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:27,843
We were worried
that we would be late.

143
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,262
They
haven't been brought here yet.

144
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:33,432
It was good of you
to come here immediately.

145
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,142
I'll reward you for it.

146
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,812
Now is the time to
find other means, more effective ones.

147
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,148
After a defeat
on the battlefield

148
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,691
they would be despised.

149
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,319
Your assassination
would be celebrated as a great deed.

150
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:50,323
Whoever killed them would be the
new king of sodom and Gomorranh.

151
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:51,700
My sister.

152
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:56,037
She imagines she can rule
as well as a man.

153
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,874
She has
a cautious woman's mind.

154
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,877
I could found a state,
an empire.

155
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,714
She's just trying to hold
what we already have,

156
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,424
our 2 united cities.

157
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,885
- No, let go of me.
- In there!

158
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,512
There it is, stupid creature.

159
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:15,849
Tamar, Tamar.

160
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,643
Up here. Do not be afraid.

161
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,938
I'll protect you,
don't be afraid.

162
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,199
Silence.

163
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:36,578
What message
did you bring me with you?

164
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,332
That the arrival of the hebrews
changes things.

165
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,210
He thinks
the time is not yet ripe.

166
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,088
Quiet, I said.

167
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:50,091
Take a deep breath.

168
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,177
Breathe, do you hear?

169
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,851
- He's blind.
- Blind?

170
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,730
What a nice idea.

171
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,193
You have a delightful imagination.

172
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,907
This makes the case more interesting.

173
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,955
An excellent refinement,
Maleb.

174
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,333
That should loosen that faithless bitch
the tongue.

175
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,503
Do you know the name?

176
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,965
Then
your sisters will die.

177
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,476
If you have to watch it,
I'll tell him.

178
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,073
Of all my slaves
I have given you my favor.

179
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,326
Weren't you happy?

180
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,582
And not even grateful.

181
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,377
What message did you bring to the
Helamite camp?

182
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,463
Since when have murderers
been allowed to act as judges?

183
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:14,593
Since when do traitors have the right to
ask questions?

184
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,137
Who sent you there?

185
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,977
I want
you to keep your life.

186
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:29,941
What is my legacy
to you and sodom?

187
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,200
- No.
- Are you insane, Tamar?

188
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:42,369
Silence!

189
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,831
Tamar?

190
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,756
Tamar.

191
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:54,382
Tamar, the slave.

192
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:56,926
No, no. No!

193
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,514
Make it short, please.
You're helping me with this.

194
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,350
Have pity on me.

195
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,771
It will
cause me less pain. Have pity, please.

196
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:10,565
The name.

197
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,651
Please, arlok. Please.

198
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,236
She will die without speaking.

199
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:17,906
Give her the rest
if she doesn't speak.

200
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,248
Talk. Tell me the name!

201
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,085
Who sent you
to the Helamites?

202
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:33,380
Speak before it's too late.
Speak.

203
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,091
Ah.

204
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,188
Ah!

205
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:00,573
I have to praise you.

206
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,702
Your wild cat gives the
best testimony to your taste.

207
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:05,036
Thank you, mistress.

208
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,425
She's also proud.

209
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,806
After you, the 1st girl
who suppressed every scream.

210
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:29,060
- I admire pride.
- Better for her if you don't like her.

211
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:32,856
If you take Tamar's example.

212
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,318
The life prospects
of your favorite slaves

213
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,529
are exceptionally low.

214
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,993
- You met them? These hebrews?
- Mmm.

215
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,579
My brother
didn't succeed.

216
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,082
Even so, he never tires of warning
me about them.

217
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,002
I want to know why.

218
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,713
These hebrews
cannot be trusted.

219
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,132
They want everyone to behave

220
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,050
as their beliefs dictate.

221
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,304
And you tell me
they are not dangerous.

222
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,891
Dangerous? Who are they dangerous to?

223
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,768
Us.

224
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,189
- Didn't you say they were unarmed?
- That I saw.

225
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,902
I want to convince myself
why they seem threatening to you.

226
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:22,697
When my plans are ready,
we will go see them.

227
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:27,452
Beloved sister, I only live
to obey your commands.

228
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,123
As always, he thinks no further
than the tip of his sword.

229
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:36,294
He believes these people
are a danger to us.

230
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,879
But in reality

231
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,257
your presence can be useful.

232
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:45,428
Should we be attacked
by the Helamites.

233
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:58,483
And in peacetime they
make themselves useful as slaves.

234
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,195
- For menial jobs.
- Not as slaves.

235
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,656
Your leader lot says,

236
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,951
no human can
own another human.

237
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,830
Whoever has no slaves
must be very poor.

238
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:13,498
Poor?

239
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,000
That's right.

240
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,462
But they seem
to be ignorant of their poverty.

241
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:22,257
If this lot prefers
not to keep slaves,

242
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,883
it is at his discretion.

243
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:27,679
Often you can't prevent
becoming one yourself.

244
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,598
Especially when one is seduced
by tricks,

245
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,353
which are as old as sodom
and as proven as Gomorranh.

246
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:40,233
How often have we
heard on our marketplace:

247
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:45,154
The hebrews keep their word,
the hebrews can be relied on.

248
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,576
You understand, the hebrews
with their newborn religion

249
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:51,995
stand between the great mighty kingdom

250
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,915
my brother dreams of and us.

251
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:59,919
And between the hebrews
and the rest of the world only sodom.

252
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:06,885
And you, Ildith? Do you fear
being my favorite too?

253
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,192
- The Jordan.
- How beautiful.

254
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:29,616
This is where our faith
will be put to the most severe test.

255
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:34,287
No Hebrew is allowed to go into
these cities, not even near them.

256
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,579
No.

257
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,875
Instruct
that no one should cross the river.

258
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,003
Nobody is allowed to
cross the river. No one.

259
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,258
You my two brave daughters.

260
00:23:48,551 --> 00:23:51,220
Our long journey
is now over.

261
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,207
Let everyone know that they
are not drinking too much at once.

262
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:30,468
"Lord, I thank you for our
salvation and humbly ask you to

263
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,637
show me the rest of the way."

264
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,911
So let's go now. Ho! Forward!

265
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,254
I think the old Alabias was still alive.

266
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:31,279
What a horrible place this is.
What a horrible blasphemy.

267
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,322
Dead and dying.

268
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:36,242
Bleached bones
under god's bright sky,

269
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,203
under its brilliant sun.

270
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:46,753
You will be fine.
We will take care of you.

271
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:50,089
Here, drink.

272
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:54,093
Slow down, drink.

273
00:25:58,222 --> 00:25:59,849
What kind of place is that?

274
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:06,230
The body of the slaves
of sodom and Gomorranh.

275
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,151
With the flesh from those bones

276
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,822
these wicked cities
are built.

277
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:34,132
Forward.

278
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:35,258
Faster.

279
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:37,720
Faster, forward.

280
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,198
The chosen people,
that's what they call themselves.

281
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:00,201
Chosen by whom?

282
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,078
Stop.

283
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:05,456
You're right, Ildith.

284
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,334
When it looks poor

285
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,796
it is easy to think of the raw
as a virtue.

286
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,716
Or you make the mistake
and think it is weakness.

287
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:34,902
Melchior.

288
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:39,031
Warn our people.
Nobody is allowed to cross the river.

289
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,993
You have to negotiate
for us.

290
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:47,915
Watch out.

291
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:51,169
Don't worry.

292
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:00,970
My son and I
are slaves to the queen.

293
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,723
We have orders
to carry you across.

294
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,850
- I have two legs myself.
- Please.

295
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,186
So that I can talk to you.

296
00:28:23,242 --> 00:28:24,702
You have no slaves?

297
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,290
No. We are all just servants
of our lord in heaven.

298
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:36,172
If my son and I
could flee to you,

299
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,466
would you give us refuge?

300
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,176
I would do that.

301
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,055
Thank you.

302
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:50,144
- Sodomite queen.
- Lot.

303
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:51,979
Lord of the hebrews.

304
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,691
There is room for your people everywhere.

305
00:28:55,983 --> 00:29:00,196
What do you think you can find here that
made you wander around?

306
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,241
- Let the land be fertile.
- For crops?

307
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,744
- Or for your religion?
- Maybe both?

308
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,248
If this country were yours,
you would be ready

309
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:11,540
to fight for it?

310
00:29:11,832 --> 00:29:12,832
You will notice

311
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,169
that the nomad tribes are not peaceful.

312
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:18,256
We are not a warrior people,
but we would fight,

313
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:21,842
- to protect what is ours.
- Then take possession of it.

314
00:29:22,134 --> 00:29:25,179
The whole Jordan valley for annual
100,000 talents of grain.

315
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:27,807
For, say, 10 years.

316
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,774
In your interest I warn you,

317
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,068
the land
is barren and arid.

318
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,494
It is impossible for us
to raise that price.

319
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,705
75,000 talents, no less.

320
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:51,997
50.

321
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:54,500
Agreed.

322
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,919
For, say, 7 years.

323
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:58,921
I agree too.

324
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,676
My daughter Shuah
brings a present for the queen,

325
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,511
to seal the trade.

326
00:30:19,775 --> 00:30:21,402
To dry your feet.

327
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:26,115
I would like
to give you a gift in return.

328
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:30,411
- My best slave, Ildith.
- But I don't want to.

329
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,788
I'd rather die.

330
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,418
Did I learn so much for it?
To live with this pastoral people?

331
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,254
In huts made of smelly skins?

332
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,466
You were brought up
to do what I please.

333
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,010
I have to refuse your gift.

334
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,597
It is against our belief
to own others as property.

335
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,684
Is it also forbidden for you
by your faith to set them free?

336
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:56,854
Farewell.

337
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,607
And good luck.

338
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,156
Hurry up. Come over.

339
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:51,784
There will be trouble.

340
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:58,916
The women, especially the wives,
will reject this woman.

341
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,252
She is a slave from sodom.

342
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,546
I'll be in front of the
altar of the tabernacle

343
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,966
to point out the duty
to hospitality.

344
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,301
Thank you.

345
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:13,889
We dressed them
as you ordered.

346
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:15,850
She is dissatisfied
with the clothes,

347
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,018
but she'll get used to it

348
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,147
- how we all got used to it.
- Thank you.

349
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:23,274
As you ordered.

350
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,446
Well? Don't you even
want to admire your work?

351
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,452
A noble robe
and so supple to the skin.

352
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,457
Do you like it better
than the silk robe?

353
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,001
For the purpose
it's supposed to serve, yes.

354
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:46,589
For what purpose? A bird has
colorful feathers to attract others.

355
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,257
Look at that!

356
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,977
- I think you will agree with me.
- Not at all.

357
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:04,440
Women wear clothes as protection
from the sun, from the cold.

358
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,027
That explains the shape of your clothes.

359
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,366
You hebrews
confuses clothes with tents.

360
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:19,121
You sit loosely so that it
does not interfere with your work.

361
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,332
- Which one?
- Women's work.

362
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,711
Cooking, spinning, cleaning,
work in the fields.

363
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:29,423
- And you say you are against slavery?
- That's the way it is.

364
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:31,675
Nevertheless
you ask me to do work,

365
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:34,178
which I had never to do before.

366
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,641
Work is the price of freedom.
The work for yourself.

367
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,394
If you decide for yourself
what and where you want to work.

368
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,689
This is what really sets you free.

369
00:33:46,982 --> 00:33:50,486
If that means a sunburned face
cracked hands,

370
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:54,782
dirty, rough clothes like this,
I'd rather be a slave then.

371
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:59,036
Me too, if it it means delicious smells
and silk clothes.

372
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,040
Just feel it. Soft like angel wings.

373
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,376
And those lovely shoes.

374
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,460
You will need them.

375
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:10,798
How can you show yourself like that.
What would your mother have said?

376
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,010
What would she have said if she
had seen the woman in our tent?

377
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:17,221
We know
why you recorded it.

378
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,390
A man
who has lost his wife,

379
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,351
- doesn't have to be ashamed about it.
- Insolence.

380
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,312
You forgot
that your father is the master.

381
00:34:25,604 --> 00:34:29,567
I've learned that the lord
never does anything wrong.

382
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,631
Run, run! Come over
we will protect you!

383
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:56,093
- Stop the sodomites. Save the slaves.
- Ah!

384
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,013
The network, the network!

385
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,101
Get out of here! Get lost!

386
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,602
Come on.

387
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,533
Wait.

388
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,085
Give us refuge. Protect us.

389
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,474
Hand over our slaves.

390
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,019
At the word of your sister
this is our country.

391
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,271
- Hand them over.
- No.

392
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,776
Stop.

393
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,530
Stop fighting.

394
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:02,785
Ishmael. Do you want to kill a
defenseless man?

395
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,329
Is that what you want? So.

396
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:21,220
Help him.

397
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,974
Tell your queen we will
take care of her brother,

398
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:28,936
until he is ready
to return alone.

399
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,733
Bring him to our tent.

400
00:36:37,736 --> 00:36:40,531
Tell her too
that these men are now free.

401
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,574
You are under our protection.

402
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,794
Now leave our country.

403
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:59,967
- Back to sodom.
- The sodomites will never forgive you for that.

404
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:05,347
We need not fear them.
We are servants of the lord.

405
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,808
We are here on his behalf.

406
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,852
You should be scared.

407
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,705
The elders and lot
pray to jehovah.

408
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,291
They ask for help with what we are doing.

409
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:36,003
Better to pray for swords,
Spears and lances.

410
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:39,465
You don't get it.
The sodomites are your enemies.

411
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,717
Dangerous, unscrupulous.

412
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:46,305
Be careful with this man, no matter
how sweet his words are.

413
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,973
You have to be vigilant.

414
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,850
You think of me a lot, Shuah.

415
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,477
Right?

416
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:35,270
No.

417
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,105
Not even at night?

418
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,816
Not at all.

419
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,107
Admit it.

420
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:43,028
You think of me a lot.

421
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:46,698
Is my skin
still as soft as on that 1st day,

422
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,534
that you anointed me?

423
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,538
Does my hair still
smell that sweet?

424
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,252
Does your hand still shake
when you touch me?

425
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:02,506
My father has given orders
to take care of you.

426
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,174
I obey him, nothing more.

427
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:05,509
Not even at night?

428
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,514
Tent walls are thin,
and you don't sleep far away.

429
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,392
I hear you.

430
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:17,271
What you said in a dream,

431
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:20,107
was very enlightening.

432
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,401
What did I say?

433
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:32,369
- What did I say?
- Should I repeat it?

434
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,038
Shall I?

435
00:39:41,461 --> 00:39:43,630
Why aren't you
like everyone else?

436
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,966
What is it?

437
00:39:48,176 --> 00:39:49,303
Your skin?

438
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,808
The scent of your hair?

439
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,396
Why am I doing this?

440
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:03,358
Why can't I stop
feeling this way?

441
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:07,738
To stop feeling means to die.
You're too young for that.

442
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,699
Think about your dream again.

443
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:14,369
The answer

444
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,331
lies in it.

445
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:37,643
He didn't tell you
that he wanted to leave?

446
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,729
- No.
- Why should he?

447
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:43,774
You have just been
been a pastime.

448
00:40:44,149 --> 00:40:48,320
You know what Ildith looked like
when she came to us.

449
00:40:48,862 --> 00:40:51,573
These are the women
he's used to.

450
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:17,891
So it will be wide enough.

451
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:21,353
- So he would have to withstand.
- How long will it take us?

452
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,438
When our men
work like Eber

453
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,816
we're
ready for spring ordering.

454
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,485
A surprise
for the queen of sodom.

455
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,613
How delighted she will be when
it turns green and sprouts.

456
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:34,533
The land of hope
for every slave in sodom.

457
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,015
Do you know those roots?

458
00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:01,643
You can find this plant
all over the mountains.

459
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:05,772
If you cut it,
juice will come out,

460
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:10,152
which we use to color our nails,
like now.

461
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:12,612
See?

462
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,450
The more you take
the darker the color.

463
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,579
- What's going on here?
- The girl has feet like an animal.

464
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,582
- I showed her something.
- I can see that.

465
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,167
Shuah.

466
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:29,629
It's late. Water the cattle.

467
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,008
My father doesn't want
me to be attractive.

468
00:42:35,343 --> 00:42:37,929
Why can't Maleb
water the cattle?

469
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:41,516
Should she do your work
in addition? Now go on.

470
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,272
My daughters are beautiful enough
as nature created them.

471
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,232
You don't need any decorations.

472
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,111
Perhaps
it's the most refined

473
00:42:53,403 --> 00:42:54,529
nothing to be done.

474
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:59,076
This brown, wind-tanned
skin is probably exercising

475
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:01,828
has a very special charm.

476
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,541
- Of which we in sodom just have no idea.
- Do you think?

477
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,043
Oh.

478
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:14,091
A Clay floor also has advantages.
It would have broken on marble.

479
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,387
This is strange.

480
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,930
Huh?

481
00:43:21,389 --> 00:43:22,808
Show your other hand.

482
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:27,854
Let's go to the light
so I can see it better.

483
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,652
These are not
the hands of a farmer.

484
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,362
Why not?

485
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:38,657
These are the hands
of a great man.

486
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,410
Your lifeline is long and clear.

487
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:46,289
My lifeline is short.

488
00:43:46,873 --> 00:43:48,750
I.e. I will die young.

489
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:51,044
Do you believe in things like that?

490
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,505
Why? Not you?

491
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,843
We believe
that only god knows our future.

492
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,596
This belief gives
us the power to move mountains.

493
00:44:02,013 --> 00:44:05,308
Soon you will see
what our faith can do.

494
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,853
He's transforming this whole country.

495
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,148
When you see this structure
growing towards the sky,

496
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:14,442
you will share our faith
one day.

497
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:22,993
- After that nice speech, you want to sleep outside now?
- No.

498
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,078
In ishmael's tent.

499
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,789
I should have figured that out.

500
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,458
It's warm and comfortable here.

501
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,669
Too comfortable maybe.

502
00:44:33,044 --> 00:44:36,548
You must be a good
example to the men of the tribe.

503
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,802
Even if you wanted to stay here,
you wouldn't dare.

504
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,096
Good night.

505
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:50,353
You are much more a slave to your
faith than any slave in sodom.

506
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,747
Although your visit
came as a surprise, prince Astaroth,

507
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,959
we have still brought
about this modest show

508
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:14,411
of our foot and horse troops.

509
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,255
It is certainly
not to be called humble.

510
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:19,966
The elite
from all of my desert tribes.

511
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:28,308
Watch the cavalry troops
ride through the warriors.

512
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,144
An example
of good horse control.

513
00:45:31,436 --> 00:45:33,521
The attack
of a well-led cavalry force

514
00:45:33,813 --> 00:45:35,232
beats the best foot troops.

515
00:45:35,523 --> 00:45:37,150
You're supposed to
ride for another hour.

516
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:40,779
- I don't understand why you are not acting.
- Patience.

517
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,407
- Your sister has new allies.
- Allies?

518
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:48,536
The hebrews live in tents of
skins, the men are unarmed.

519
00:45:48,828 --> 00:45:52,290
You would even have taken
the queen's brother off the horse.

520
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:54,501
Coincidence.

521
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,587
They are a peaceful people.

522
00:45:57,879 --> 00:46:01,132
Anyway, I want
to get an idea of myself first

523
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:03,134
from this peaceful people.

524
00:46:03,426 --> 00:46:05,512
Every thing
needs the right time.

525
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,555
I have trained leopards.

526
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:10,100
After pulling on the halter
I can judge

527
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,435
when the animal is ready to jump.

528
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,146
This moment has not yet arrived.

529
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:16,856
I'll wait.

530
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,484
To me.

531
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,069
Ah.

532
00:46:22,028 --> 00:46:23,280
Please, please.

533
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,740
You promised me one.

534
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,707
You are way too slow.

535
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,000
That's it now.

536
00:46:37,168 --> 00:46:40,088
- Have you seen my brother?
- No, my mistress.

537
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,722
Well, in a nutshell.

538
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,182
We must
always be ready

539
00:46:51,474 --> 00:46:54,102
and bring more and more fighters
to our side.

540
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,394
If the attack occurs,

541
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:59,024
we must stab in the back
of the forces of the queen.

542
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,472
What a pretty sight.

543
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,893
How pleased is my heart,
so many of my loyal subordinates.

544
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,521
So convinced of our
warlike strength to see

545
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:40,398
that they can afford

546
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,444
to spend their time playing
my father's favorite game.

547
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:46,363
And so sensible.

548
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:49,657
You play
in front of your remains.

549
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,745
With this you prove him
and our other ancestors

550
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,790
an extremely dignified
and tasteful honor.

551
00:47:58,249 --> 00:47:59,249
Get out!

552
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:06,132
We weren't idle.

553
00:48:06,549 --> 00:48:08,385
No? A little more precisely, please.

554
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,762
Have your confidants established

555
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,849
- what pleasure hebrews seek in this quarry?
- Yes.

556
00:48:15,141 --> 00:48:18,603
Before you came I said
that these granite blocks,

557
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,357
that have troubled us
are destined for a temple,

558
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,151
with whom they want to make their god
friendly.

559
00:48:25,443 --> 00:48:26,736
I want to know exactly.

560
00:48:27,028 --> 00:48:28,738
Here, your first request for salt.

561
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:33,493
You have to sign a
deposit for every grain.

562
00:48:36,037 --> 00:48:39,833
You may find
some useful help in Ildith.

563
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,002
Ask her what the hebrews build.

564
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,630
A visit to the Hebrew camp?

565
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,298
How pretty.

566
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:50,760
Yes, lot's young daughter.

567
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,430
There are times

568
00:48:53,721 --> 00:48:57,684
in which I envy you men
for your freedom of action.

569
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,442
- For nothing else?
- For many things.

570
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,111
Like you,

571
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:11,197
you alone,
maybe you know very well.

572
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,242
The brother is cute,

573
00:49:16,911 --> 00:49:20,665
oldest and dearest of my enemies.

574
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,890
- That was down to the blood.
- Here.

575
00:49:45,106 --> 00:49:47,567
You no longer enjoy it.

576
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,903
Not even pain.

577
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,323
Go! Carry out my orders.

578
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,162
Anything you want
sweetest sister.

579
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,486
Ah.

580
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:38,743
The sodomites believe we are building
a temple in honor of Jehovanh.

581
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:43,665
For jehovah? No. My one
pagan temple, I fear.

582
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,291
For fertility.

583
00:50:57,845 --> 00:51:02,559
Come on, come on. We bring the salt
your leaders asked for.

584
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:07,480
We also bring things that
will make your life easier.

585
00:51:09,607 --> 00:51:11,859
Soft sleeping beds
and blankets made of wool.

586
00:51:12,151 --> 00:51:14,195
Metal bowls
and ornate ornaments,

587
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:18,366
with which you can make your hut more
beautiful than that of your neighbors.

588
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,784
Good afternoon.

589
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:27,166
Aren't you happy
to see me again?

590
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:33,131
Tell me, does this lot
dislike you?

591
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:39,053
As far as I can tell, yes.

592
00:51:39,512 --> 00:51:40,512
Good.

593
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,517
What do the hebrews build?

594
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:47,604
I have had no reason
to find out.

595
00:51:47,895 --> 00:51:49,939
- It's your job.
- Why?

596
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:52,900
Tell me that.

597
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,738
You are only here to
keep your eyes open for us

598
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,657
and to seduce lot into our habits.

599
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:03,745
To convert him. How Malek
converts women to our ways.

600
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,913
Tell your sister,
I don't know anything.

601
00:52:06,205 --> 00:52:09,250
If I knew something
I'd keep it to myself.

602
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:13,630
You know my sister
doesn't appreciate unkind words very much.

603
00:52:13,921 --> 00:52:17,634
She sent me away.
I do not belong to your sister any more.

604
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:21,846
I'm free. I can do what I like.
I belong to myself.

605
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,890
Congratulations on this possession.

606
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:38,696
Shuah.

607
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:47,914
The bird you are looking for
is in hiding.

608
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,540
In the tall reeds.

609
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,752
Thank you.

610
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,630
There is something touching
about your loyalty to lot.

611
00:53:06,432 --> 00:53:08,059
Are you hiding from me?

612
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,981
Am I a stranger? Are you angry
because I left without saying goodbye?

613
00:53:14,273 --> 00:53:16,109
You don't want to show yourself.

614
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,860
Good.

615
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:22,657
That makes the game more exciting.
I have to find your lead.

616
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:28,579
You leave traces, on purpose.
You want it that way.

617
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:31,332
So that I can follow you.

618
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,584
And find you.

619
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:37,171
Even for a mediocre hunter
it's easy

620
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:40,383
following a trail in the reeds,
best Shuah.

621
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:41,884
You know that very well.

622
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,720
I'll find the lead.

623
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,222
And I'll find you.

624
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,149
What do you need so much for, melchior?

625
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:58,234
Why so much?

626
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,070
- You wanted me to find you.
- No.

627
00:54:01,362 --> 00:54:03,823
- You wanted it. Admit it.
- No, no.

628
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,409
Salt is meant for everyone.

629
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,120
It's free.
Like the air, like the water.

630
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:14,584
On behalf of the elders, Nako
will sign for all of us.

631
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:20,882
And you, go now.

632
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:26,429
- Go!
- Ah! Lot!

633
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,431
Lot! Lot!

634
00:54:30,224 --> 00:54:32,268
Astaroth, Shuah,
I wasn't vigilant.

635
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,560
Forgive me.

636
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,771
Down by the reeds.

637
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,490
- Leave me.
- Why don't you want to?

638
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,117
- Am I being too gentle with you?
- No.

639
00:54:57,084 --> 00:54:58,211
You dog!

640
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,512
Get out of here.

641
00:55:09,096 --> 00:55:11,224
Leave me my pleasure or die.

642
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,895
So kill me.

643
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,690
You will not return
to sodom alive.

644
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,317
No!

645
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,945
- You want me to spare him?
- Yes.

646
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,572
For your daughter's sake
I'll spare you.

647
00:55:26,864 --> 00:55:28,616
So our calculation is smooth.

648
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,994
At our next meeting
there will be no more consideration.

649
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:33,788
Grace is not given.

650
00:55:34,455 --> 00:55:36,082
No mercy is asked.

651
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:40,503
If you touch my daughter again
once, I say,

652
00:55:42,004 --> 00:55:43,840
by Jehovanh, I will kill you.

653
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,887
- Lot, look.
- What kind of riders are they?

654
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:54,725
- Nomads. Helamites.
- Perhaps you will see it now.

655
00:55:55,434 --> 00:55:57,061
You'd better get out of here.

656
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:03,526
We will convene the council
and prepare.

657
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:19,250
Our watch is over.

658
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,543
Fine, Sarah.

659
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:24,672
- Are the backup guards on duty?
- As you ordered.

660
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,633
- On all peaks within earshot of each other.
- Good.

661
00:56:27,925 --> 00:56:29,927
We haven't seen anything in days.

662
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:44,483
You have to give that to the devil,
or the she-devil.

663
00:56:44,775 --> 00:56:47,361
She worked like one of us this week.

664
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:49,322
What a week proves.

665
00:56:52,116 --> 00:56:54,452
They are watching us. I better go.

666
00:56:55,953 --> 00:56:57,038
Wait.

667
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:02,376
Look at him. Soon she will
have him sweep out her tent.

668
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,170
Leave him alone.

669
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,512
Lot.

670
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:15,681
Lot, wait.

671
00:57:17,224 --> 00:57:21,312
I have to ask you something.
It's about Maleb and me.

672
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,816
- We would like to get married.
- Getting married?

673
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:29,403
Not immediately, of course.
In about 6 months.

674
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,075
Ishmael.

675
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,786
When a man and a woman
love each other,

676
00:57:39,538 --> 00:57:41,332
they should
not live apart for too long.

677
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,209
I have reasons to wait.

678
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,963
My share of the harvest,
a new household must be started.

679
00:57:47,254 --> 00:57:48,547
You have my blessing.

680
00:57:49,423 --> 00:57:51,175
Go and give her a kiss.

681
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,232
- You shouldn't have followed me.
- No?

682
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,318
Not in my own tent
in broad daylight?

683
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,195
That's it right now.

684
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:16,784
All these women by the river.
In 10 minutes you will know in the camp.

685
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,661
The breath of annoyance.

686
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,958
- You have a low opinion of me.
- Do you think so?

687
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,837
You make no distinction
between me and my office.

688
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,716
Lot, the leader of the tribe
would never do this or that.

689
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,843
Neither does man lot.

690
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:37,096
Now the man lot is
standing in front of you.

691
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,640
His heart pounding
like a stupid boy.

692
00:58:39,932 --> 00:58:43,894
He didn't want to go into the tent,
but his feet carried him.

693
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:45,771
Lot.

694
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,356
Sun.

695
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:50,234
Let me know
everywhere in the camp.

696
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:51,526
Must I fail

697
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,155
what is
taken for granted by other men?

698
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,447
Yes, you have to.

699
00:58:55,489 --> 00:58:58,993
- You must remain a good man to your people.
- A good one?

700
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,953
Why not a gloomy one,

701
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:03,539
grayer, older, more boring?

702
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,624
That's not what I meant.

703
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:08,711
What does being a good man
have to do with

704
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,130
that I'm with you in my tent

705
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,422
please, lot.

706
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,466
Please.

707
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:18,304
Has it anything to do with the fact that
you think I'm a good man

708
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,805
and you're not a good woman.

709
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:22,850
Because you used
to live in sodom?

710
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:26,395
You can't even imagine life
in sodom.

711
00:59:26,687 --> 00:59:27,687
This is over.

712
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,857
It has nothing to
do with the now.

713
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:32,358
Look at those hands.

714
00:59:32,943 --> 00:59:34,570
Furrowed, sunburned.

715
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,407
These are not the slave's hands
given to me.

716
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:41,994
These are the hands of a woman
who was born again.

717
00:59:42,286 --> 00:59:43,537
You don't know if it really is.

718
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:44,371
I don't know.

719
00:59:44,663 --> 00:59:46,916
The hands of the woman
who is now.

720
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:52,629
The woman,

721
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:54,632
who shall become my wife.

722
01:00:01,305 --> 01:00:02,305
Very well.

723
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,099
Why not?

724
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,936
I am brought up to give joy
and to obey.

725
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:09,814
I can give you joys
that you have never dreamed of.

726
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,106
Ildith.

727
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,483
In sodom,

728
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:15,402
we had fragrant baths.

729
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:18,531
Will you forgive me
if I come to you like this?

730
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:19,946
Without a beguiling scent?

731
01:00:21,283 --> 01:00:23,869
And what a shame that you
took my pretty dress away from me.

732
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,216
I would really like to
be beautiful for you.

733
01:00:28,749 --> 01:00:29,749
But maybe,

734
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,209
I am enough for you?

735
01:00:32,711 --> 01:00:34,922
You may not even
miss the finer points?

736
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:39,867
I'm not looking
for pleasure in you.

737
01:00:40,594 --> 01:00:42,471
I want your love
as I give you mine.

738
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,805
You mustn't love me.

739
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:47,810
- I want to make you my wife.
- You mustn't love me!

740
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:50,271
- You mustn't love me!
- Why not?

741
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,523
- I don't know.
- My dear wife.

742
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,067
Not because of the things
I've done.

743
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,528
Because of
what I may do.

744
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,240
Maybe I will never
believe in this Jehovanh.

745
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,532
You will.

746
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:07,163
- Maybe I'll never be happy in clothes like that.
- You will.

747
01:01:07,454 --> 01:01:11,333
Maybe
something in me will give us away.

748
01:01:12,459 --> 01:01:15,171
And I will wish
to live in sodom again.

749
01:01:15,462 --> 01:01:17,423
I'll take it seriously.

750
01:01:30,477 --> 01:01:31,937
Why are you bothering me?

751
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:34,190
What do you have to tell me?

752
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,776
Isn't one favor
always worth another?

753
01:01:38,068 --> 01:01:41,113
Didn't melchior show you the way
to lot's daughter?

754
01:01:41,405 --> 01:01:44,909
I intend to do more
favors to you.

755
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,994
Maybe
you don't care,

756
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:49,413
as the first hebrews
who wanted

757
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:51,040
to become a citizen of sodom.

758
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:54,335
Services rendered
are remembered with benevolence.

759
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:58,214
Future services
we will know how to reward.

760
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:02,009
We welcome you
to our walls.

761
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,427
Open the gates.

762
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:09,850
- Melchior betrayed us.
- Do you have anything else to say?

763
01:02:10,142 --> 01:02:14,188
Nothing about sodomites, but much about
hebrews who betray us.

764
01:02:15,105 --> 01:02:19,318
- Jehovah will cast you out.
- Hollow words of an arrogant religion.

765
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,528
I would think you guys are crazy

766
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,323
I would not have seen
what you built.

767
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,492
Help, help me.

768
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,286
Help me. Let go of me.

769
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:32,206
No! No! Leave him alone!

770
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:34,917
We are not slaves. No!

771
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,670
You've been so smart, so smart.

772
01:02:38,128 --> 01:02:41,090
You set a trap
and trapped yourself in it.

773
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,385
You persuaded the hebrews to pay
dearly for a desolate piece of land.

774
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:45,927
What now?

775
01:02:46,428 --> 01:02:48,180
With this dam
that they built

776
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:50,724
this worthless piece of
land will bring in so much

777
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:53,185
that they will have
paid for it in 2 years.

778
01:02:53,727 --> 01:02:55,688
Now the time is working for you.

779
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:59,650
My most gracious sister.

780
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:03,404
But melchior
brought other news too.

781
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,363
Well.

782
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,706
That lot should intend to
marry Ildith.

783
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,209
You don't think it's important?

784
01:03:17,751 --> 01:03:21,630
It proves to me that the leader
of this invincible people.

785
01:03:21,922 --> 01:03:23,924
Is not that insurmountable.

786
01:03:25,884 --> 01:03:27,761
Time works for me.

787
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:32,056
Speak.

788
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:35,519
Gentlemen,
the leader of the hebrews, lot,

789
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:38,230
is waiting with a group
of his advisors.

790
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:40,190
They wish to speak to you.

791
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:42,901
I'll talk to him,
but alone.

792
01:03:43,193 --> 01:03:44,403
This is great.

793
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,448
He gives himself into your hand.

794
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:50,451
In one fell swoop
we can take down lot.

795
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,703
Without their ruler
the people are helpless.

796
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,496
And sodom will be without allies.

797
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,583
Your eagerness to
serve me moves me.

798
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,669
Put down your gun
and wait outside.

799
01:04:02,963 --> 01:04:05,716
Why do you always have
to treat me like a child.

800
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,676
I want to be alone with lot!

801
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:19,313
My brother is having
a fit of hurt pride.

802
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,899
Please don't put anything on it.

803
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:28,864
- You want to reclaim melchior?
- I don't care about traitors.

804
01:04:29,948 --> 01:04:31,950
But where are the former slaves,

805
01:04:32,242 --> 01:04:34,453
that you kidnapped with his help?

806
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,580
For a clear head

807
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:40,334
- and to calm your nerves.
- Where are they?

808
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,127
I want them back.

809
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,964
It is our pleasure to please you.

810
01:04:46,673 --> 01:04:49,134
Allow us to make
you comfortable.

811
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,553
You're wasting your time.

812
01:04:51,845 --> 01:04:55,099
I'm not here
to be drowned in wine.

813
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,851
I am the leader of the hebrews.

814
01:04:58,435 --> 01:04:59,435
I'm here

815
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:02,231
to discuss important matters
with the ruler of the sodomites.

816
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:03,649
Leave us alone.

817
01:05:05,609 --> 01:05:07,861
You want
that I do not speak as a woman,

818
01:05:08,153 --> 01:05:10,239
but as the ruler of sodom?

819
01:05:12,032 --> 01:05:14,535
Then speak as the leader
of the hebrews

820
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:18,330
and not as a self-appointed
prophet of an imaginary deity.

821
01:05:18,622 --> 01:05:21,041
Let's tear off our masks.

822
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:28,173
Do you want to see the
slaves that we took back?

823
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,507
Come on.

824
01:05:41,353 --> 01:05:44,231
Where does he ride to
with such a grim face?

825
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:47,025
Wherever he may go
he will not like it.

826
01:05:47,317 --> 01:05:49,862
Our great general's wrath
is aroused.

827
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:52,072
None of the sinners can evade them.

828
01:05:52,364 --> 01:05:54,825
A man in the free country
is a free man.

829
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:58,328
If this is not so,
we are not masters of the land.

830
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,747
In that case
we will move on.

831
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:05,002
Who told you
that I wasn't indifferent?

832
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:08,046
- Maybe Ildith?
- Nobody told me that.

833
01:06:08,338 --> 01:06:11,216
Back then you asked
if we would be ready

834
01:06:11,508 --> 01:06:12,926
to fight for this country.

835
01:06:13,218 --> 01:06:14,636
Since then I've assumed

836
01:06:14,928 --> 01:06:17,514
that our presence
fits into your plans.

837
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,851
But maybe
I was wrong.

838
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:22,268
Wait, lot.

839
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:25,397
I can afford
to be generous.

840
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,818
The 3 recaptured slaves
are to be released.

841
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:33,363
- You may go back to the hebrews.
- Yes, my lady.

842
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:35,491
And our right to give refuge?

843
01:06:35,782 --> 01:06:38,494
If you insist that it
belongs to the acquisition of the land,

844
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:39,911
that too.

845
01:06:40,078 --> 01:06:42,414
Earlier you refused to
drink with me.

846
01:06:42,706 --> 01:06:47,669
Let's drink now to celebrate the
covenant between the good two

847
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,630
enemies.

848
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,007
We're enemies, aren't we?

849
01:06:52,424 --> 01:06:54,259
Our peoples, no.

850
01:06:55,135 --> 01:06:57,387
Our philosophies of life, yes.

851
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:16,698
Have you discovered a lack of
courage? Say your opinion openly.

852
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,743
Nothing but bravery. Hot blood.

853
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:21,787
I congratulate you.

854
01:07:24,414 --> 01:07:28,085
But if it is to be done
it must be done now.

855
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,837
You never asked me
for my price.

856
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,049
I know
everything has its price.

857
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:37,511
For years we nomadic tribes
hat to pay terrible tributes

858
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,013
for the salt of sodom.

859
01:07:40,305 --> 01:07:42,057
Now is our time.

860
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:47,145
Half of sodom's total gain in salt.

861
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,402
Ok.

862
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,572
The leopard is pulling on its halter.

863
01:07:56,863 --> 01:07:57,864
If I let go of him,

864
01:07:58,156 --> 01:08:01,368
you have to take care of the Booty
within the walls.

865
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:02,869
My sister?

866
01:08:10,502 --> 01:08:11,753
My sister.

867
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,260
I've waited a long time for such a hunt.

868
01:08:42,784 --> 01:08:46,330
I'm so glad you
became my father's wife.

869
01:08:49,207 --> 01:08:50,250
Thank you.

870
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:03,889
Let me be the first
to bring you bread

871
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,974
and the salt of life.

872
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:28,246
- Congratulations, lot.
- Thank you. You and Maleb, you are next.

873
01:09:28,538 --> 01:09:29,956
- Live happily.
- Thank you.

874
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:33,585
- Good luck from the heart.
- Become happy together.

875
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,421
My lucky comb.

876
01:09:38,298 --> 01:09:41,760
Do you remember how he
helped me catch you?

877
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,596
Don't lose him, Ildith.

878
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:20,382
The Helamites!

879
01:10:23,885 --> 01:10:28,390
Ildith, lead the women and children
to sodom. Demand shelter for them.

880
01:10:29,641 --> 01:10:30,809
Calm down.

881
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:33,186
Calm down, keep calm.

882
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:37,149
We knew
that this could happen.

883
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:40,652
We promised that we would
defend this land,

884
01:10:40,944 --> 01:10:41,944
our country.

885
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:44,489
We are prepared,
so arm yourselves.

886
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:47,200
Each go to his post.

887
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:05,093
Hurry up.
Who knows how fast they are here.

888
01:11:05,385 --> 01:11:07,763
It is better
we can wait for her in peace.

889
01:11:08,054 --> 01:11:09,931
Nobody can know
when you are here.

890
01:11:10,223 --> 01:11:14,144
They're still over an hour away,
calm down.

891
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,148
Everything is going as lot planned.

892
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,692
Didn't we
practice all of this enough?

893
01:11:20,984 --> 01:11:23,111
Quiet. Trust in god, friends.

894
01:11:24,362 --> 01:11:26,740
I'm so sorry
on your wedding day.

895
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,540
Quiet, Maleb.

896
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,376
What should
the other women think?

897
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,256
He's coming back.

898
01:11:44,007 --> 01:11:45,926
Shuah, you and your sister,

899
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:49,471
- you help Ildith with the women and children.
- Yes.

900
01:11:54,017 --> 01:11:58,271
My two daughters will follow you
as if you were their mother.

901
01:12:59,749 --> 01:13:01,084
We have to act.

902
01:13:01,751 --> 01:13:04,504
The Helamites
are only five miles away.

903
01:13:04,796 --> 01:13:08,300
As agreed, you
are under lot's command. Attack!

904
01:13:15,098 --> 01:13:18,685
May I suggest that our
most trusted subordinates

905
01:13:18,977 --> 01:13:21,563
with your departments
keep the town occupied?

906
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,523
As her queen's bodyguard.

907
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:26,610
As you mean. Select them.

908
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,288
Let them into town.

909
01:14:44,145 --> 01:14:46,982
The men for your protection
ride into the field.

910
01:14:47,273 --> 01:14:49,067
Since they are the most reliable,

911
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:52,112
we have given them this honor.

912
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:54,406
Then may I ask you
to cite them.

913
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:56,741
You will serve where I please.

914
01:14:57,033 --> 01:14:58,034
Here.

915
01:14:58,451 --> 01:14:59,869
By my side.

916
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,455
For my personal protection.

917
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:44,998
Forward.
Attack the Hebrew camp!

918
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,624
Death to the hebrews!

919
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:48,793
Destroy your camp!

920
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:50,879
Death to the hebrews!

921
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:04,661
Our Hebrew allies
aren't even fighting for their camp.

922
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:18,383
The hebrews are gone.

923
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:20,135
You are gone, escaped.

924
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:22,804
We'll find them.

925
01:17:33,606 --> 01:17:34,691
Even in sodom

926
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:38,444
the sodomite cavalry
is known for their betrayal.

927
01:17:38,736 --> 01:17:42,073
- I hope it isn't too important.
- We'll keep it in reserve.

928
01:17:42,365 --> 01:17:44,868
If we're lucky
we don't need them.

929
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,786
Lot! Lot!

930
01:17:47,453 --> 01:17:49,873
The Helamites
have destroyed our camp.

931
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,916
Tents, grain, everything burned.

932
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:54,878
Our men are all in their places.

933
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,216
Done.

934
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:03,761
Suppose the Helamites
are not doing us a favor,

935
01:18:04,053 --> 01:18:05,471
to attack where we want.

936
01:18:05,763 --> 01:18:07,056
We have decoys for that.

937
01:18:07,682 --> 01:18:10,226
Give the sign
that they are coming towards us.

938
01:18:33,249 --> 01:18:34,584
The hebrews!

939
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:41,299
Like rats, so they run
into their canyons.

940
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:47,472
Prisoners are not taken!

941
01:18:49,098 --> 01:18:53,478
The watchword of the day is:
Death to the hebrews!

942
01:19:03,821 --> 01:19:04,821
Oil!

943
01:19:20,838 --> 01:19:23,424
- Into the hiding places!
- Into the hiding places!

944
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:26,386
- Into the hiding places!
- Into the hiding places!

945
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:40,942
As you can see, my friend,
they are prepared.

946
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:04,859
Back! Return! All back!

947
01:21:35,723 --> 01:21:36,766
Ah!

948
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,538
Ah! Ah!

949
01:23:08,816 --> 01:23:09,859
Help!

950
01:23:11,652 --> 01:23:15,281
Your prince's allies
appear to be trapped.

951
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:17,909
The key to this trap
is up there.

952
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:21,996
If we turn this around, we'll
reverse the course of the battle.

953
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:26,250
You take this container,
I take the other.

954
01:23:28,252 --> 01:23:29,795
Drive them out!

955
01:23:34,717 --> 01:23:35,843
Forward!

956
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:04,789
Ishmael!

957
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:33,025
Get back!

958
01:24:33,442 --> 01:24:34,735
Get back, Helamites!

959
01:24:35,027 --> 01:24:36,529
Save yourselves, Helamites!

960
01:24:37,488 --> 01:24:38,990
Get back! Return!

961
01:24:50,501 --> 01:24:51,961
The fire, it's going out.

962
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,091
See what happened.

963
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:15,985
Melchior, come back!
Come here, you traitor.

964
01:25:16,485 --> 01:25:18,070
- Come back!
- Ah!

965
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:22,199
Ah! Help me!

966
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:25,161
Help me!

967
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:28,331
I don't hear your voice.

968
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:30,249
Dead people cannot speak.

969
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,251
Help me! Ah!

970
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:41,844
They're going to slaughter us.
Order the withdrawal.

971
01:25:42,136 --> 01:25:44,305
Our men have to stop them.

972
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:48,184
So that we can buy time
to break the dam.

973
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:49,810
- The dam?
- No, lot, no.

974
01:25:50,102 --> 01:25:53,481
It is the only hope
for the future of our people.

975
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:57,652
What else can we do? Nothing.
We gave our word.

976
01:25:58,110 --> 01:26:01,739
Command our people to fight until
they hear the horn.

977
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:05,368
When they hear the horn,
they should withdraw.

978
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:11,582
The way is clear! Forward!

979
01:26:50,204 --> 01:26:53,666
You and your men are defending the
southern front, I defend this one.

980
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,003
Help the hebrews!

981
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:07,972
I'll take command.
Retreat. Retreat!

982
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:11,434
Retreat, sodomites! Return! Return!

983
01:27:13,018 --> 01:27:15,062
Keep fighting until
you hear the horn.

984
01:27:15,354 --> 01:27:18,357
Follow them.
They withdraw like rats.

985
01:27:18,649 --> 01:27:20,860
Chase them! Destroy them!

986
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:25,030
Eber, try to break through the middle
section of the dam.

987
01:27:25,322 --> 01:27:27,742
We'll hold them
for as long as possible.

988
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:31,704
Go, Eber, go.

989
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:34,540
Run, run!

990
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:36,751
Everyone upstairs!

991
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:42,339
- Does everyone know what to do if he blows the horn?
- Yes.

992
01:27:46,218 --> 01:27:47,887
They're going to drown us.

993
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:49,722
Let the men dismount.

994
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:51,932
Dismount!

995
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:54,226
Forward!

996
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:14,580
Hold on, hold on. 1st group forward.

997
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:18,459
- Attack on the dam from the south.
- Attack on the dam from the south.

998
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:19,835
Forward.

999
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:23,088
Group attacks from the north.

1000
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:26,842
Unmounted forward.

1001
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:29,887
Spread out. Clean up the ravine.

1002
01:29:12,721 --> 01:29:13,721
Ah!

1003
01:29:15,766 --> 01:29:16,766
Ah!

1004
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:50,843
Break through the ropes.
Break through them.

1005
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:52,344
Come on, punch them through.

1006
01:30:10,112 --> 01:30:11,739
Let's go to the top! Hurry up!

1007
01:30:15,784 --> 01:30:16,785
Back, back.

1008
01:32:23,787 --> 01:32:24,872
Your message?

1009
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:42,138
Victory.

1010
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:44,558
Triumphant victory.

1011
01:32:56,445 --> 01:33:00,282
Dangerous. That's what
you called the hebrews.

1012
01:33:02,284 --> 01:33:03,911
My dear bodyguard.

1013
01:33:04,578 --> 01:33:08,832
Have you not been
privileged to protect me?

1014
01:33:11,585 --> 01:33:14,588
Get water and bandages
for the wounded.

1015
01:33:29,978 --> 01:33:32,523
Between sodom and the world.

1016
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:35,984
Hebrews only.

1017
01:33:45,035 --> 01:33:47,663
Quiet!
The queen wants to speak to you.

1018
01:33:49,998 --> 01:33:53,001
Hebrews and sodomites,
I greet you.

1019
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:57,297
Our city's hospitality
awaits the winners.

1020
01:33:57,631 --> 01:34:00,676
You too, brave lot,
and all your people.

1021
01:34:01,718 --> 01:34:04,596
The city awaits you with food and drink

1022
01:34:04,888 --> 01:34:07,224
and with everything
brave men dream of.

1023
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:08,558
Charities.

1024
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:11,228
Mild sheaves from the sodomites.

1025
01:34:11,603 --> 01:34:13,981
We can take sodom
and free the slaves.

1026
01:34:14,273 --> 01:34:15,858
Give us the order to attack

1027
01:34:16,191 --> 01:34:18,694
and we'll burn sodom
to the walls.

1028
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:24,700
No.

1029
01:34:25,617 --> 01:34:27,369
We'll have to accept it.

1030
01:34:27,911 --> 01:34:29,621
We have no other choice.

1031
01:34:30,914 --> 01:34:32,207
Hear me, queen.

1032
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:35,669
We accept the hospitality
offered to us.

1033
01:34:36,044 --> 01:34:39,923
But only until our burned down
camp is rebuilt.

1034
01:34:42,092 --> 01:34:43,302
Come on.

1035
01:34:43,802 --> 01:34:46,054
I'll take care of the wounded.

1036
01:35:29,723 --> 01:35:31,975
"0 lord Jehovanh,
give me a sign,

1037
01:35:32,267 --> 01:35:34,686
that I have done well
in your face.

1038
01:35:34,978 --> 01:35:37,022
That I
made the right choice.

1039
01:35:37,314 --> 01:35:40,651
Show me the right way
and show me what to do,

1040
01:35:40,943 --> 01:35:42,486
to serve you humbly.

1041
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:48,408
- Where can we get water?
- Maybe there.

1042
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:11,014
Try this, I'll look here.

1043
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:21,107
Maleb.

1044
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:45,966
Our work is ruined.

1045
01:36:46,883 --> 01:36:48,635
Washed away by the same water,

1046
01:36:48,927 --> 01:36:51,388
which we believed
would be a blessing to us.

1047
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,141
This water
will grow new fruit.

1048
01:36:54,474 --> 01:36:55,474
Lot.

1049
01:36:56,184 --> 01:36:57,311
The water.

1050
01:37:05,277 --> 01:37:07,612
- Salt.
- This land is cursed.

1051
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:09,865
I don't think so.

1052
01:37:12,284 --> 01:37:14,411
I don't think so at all.

1053
01:37:21,543 --> 01:37:23,253
A mountain of salt.

1054
01:37:23,628 --> 01:37:26,882
The flood and a landslide
exposed the salt.

1055
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:29,760
Nothing
grows on our soil anymore.

1056
01:37:30,761 --> 01:37:32,804
All of this is on our land.

1057
01:37:33,513 --> 01:37:36,266
What use is water to a land
that is poisoned?

1058
01:37:36,558 --> 01:37:37,558
Death.

1059
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:41,396
- Better we go back to where we came from.
- No.

1060
01:37:41,688 --> 01:37:45,359
We will accept the offer.
We will live in sodom.

1061
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:48,320
Separated from them,
but within the walls of their city.

1062
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:49,612
Live in sodom?

1063
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:52,240
That is the sign
I asked for.

1064
01:37:52,532 --> 01:37:56,119
Jehovah has chosen me to lead my people
away from the fields.

1065
01:37:56,411 --> 01:37:59,581
We're going to trade.
Weigh honestly, measure well.

1066
01:37:59,873 --> 01:38:02,125
The sodomite tyranny
is over.

1067
01:38:02,417 --> 01:38:05,545
Merchants who avoided sodom
will come.

1068
01:38:05,837 --> 01:38:08,215
We'll have paid our land
in a year.

1069
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:09,841
What are we going to sell?

1070
01:38:11,927 --> 01:38:13,011
Salt.

1071
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:21,811
And so it happened

1072
01:38:22,145 --> 01:38:25,440
that the hebrews lived within the walls
of sodom and Gomorranh.

1073
01:38:25,774 --> 01:38:29,194
You had given up your simple life
as farmers and Shepherds

1074
01:38:29,486 --> 01:38:31,029
and had become a salt trader.

1075
01:38:33,156 --> 01:38:37,577
- To pay for our land or for you?
- To free slaves.

1076
01:38:37,911 --> 01:38:39,246
Quiet please.

1077
01:38:39,538 --> 01:38:42,624
It is the hour when judge lot
will hold his midday meal.

1078
01:38:42,916 --> 01:38:45,877
Come back tomorrow.
He will listen to your concerns.

1079
01:38:46,169 --> 01:38:49,756
Lot never used to stop working
just to eat.

1080
01:38:50,048 --> 01:38:52,217
The hardworking
tastes better with a crust of bread

1081
01:38:52,509 --> 01:38:54,094
than a rich meal for the lazy.

1082
01:38:54,386 --> 01:38:58,014
Lot said in those days that
salt was as free as air.

1083
01:38:58,306 --> 01:39:00,183
Now we're going to sell it for gold.

1084
01:39:00,934 --> 01:39:03,812
The tax I collected
in one day.

1085
01:39:04,104 --> 01:39:06,273
This is how we
pay the queen our land.

1086
01:39:06,565 --> 01:39:09,359
We sell so much because we
ask a fair price.

1087
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:11,736
The sodomite slaves
are whipped for it.

1088
01:39:12,028 --> 01:39:14,531
You have to work faster and faster.

1089
01:39:15,031 --> 01:39:16,575
Lot has won a great victory.

1090
01:39:16,867 --> 01:39:19,327
Now he brings you riches,
us righteousness.

1091
01:39:19,786 --> 01:39:23,790
Could it be that we sodomites
think more of him than you do?

1092
01:39:24,207 --> 01:39:28,128
- We admire your lot.
- You admire him. We love him.

1093
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:30,505
Our love obliges us
to remind him

1094
01:39:30,797 --> 01:39:33,091
that he is a servant of jehovah.

1095
01:39:34,009 --> 01:39:37,471
- Your anger is immeasurable, ishmael.
- How else is anger supposed to be?

1096
01:39:39,931 --> 01:39:41,016
If you could say

1097
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:43,935
what you hope to achieve
with such ruthless trade.

1098
01:39:44,352 --> 01:39:47,606
Don't you get it,
it can't go on like this.

1099
01:39:48,064 --> 01:39:50,400
You mean we should openly
break with the sodomites?

1100
01:39:50,692 --> 01:39:54,154
- They wouldn't know.
- What is it about?

1101
01:39:56,072 --> 01:39:57,866
We have the queen's word,

1102
01:39:58,241 --> 01:40:01,286
that in Hebrew dwellings
every slave enjoys protection.

1103
01:40:01,578 --> 01:40:04,247
You are going to cheat the queen
of her property?

1104
01:40:05,081 --> 01:40:06,081
Property.

1105
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:10,003
Are flesh and blood, people
suddenly your property?

1106
01:40:11,087 --> 01:40:12,506
How have you changed.

1107
01:40:12,923 --> 01:40:14,716
I am a man of peace.

1108
01:40:15,008 --> 01:40:16,848
I must respect the way of life
of my neighbors.

1109
01:40:16,968 --> 01:40:20,889
What they have acquired
we cannot steal.

1110
01:40:21,306 --> 01:40:22,306
If we do

1111
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:24,726
our presence
loses any moral basis.

1112
01:40:25,018 --> 01:40:27,687
The reason for our presence
is to free the slaves.

1113
01:40:27,979 --> 01:40:30,857
We are in sodom to win
the people over to decency.

1114
01:40:31,233 --> 01:40:32,692
While slaves perish?

1115
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:37,864
You should know what it
means to be a slave in sodom.

1116
01:40:38,156 --> 01:40:39,199
Tell him!

1117
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:44,871
A work slave? What do I know.
I've never been anything like that.

1118
01:40:45,497 --> 01:40:47,874
I believe your freedom
is not that important

1119
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:49,626
like our peace with sodom.

1120
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:51,878
Ishmael, I command you

1121
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:54,756
to do nothing
without my consent.

1122
01:40:55,131 --> 01:40:56,633
Then why do we live here?

1123
01:40:56,925 --> 01:40:58,426
Is it that hard to understand?

1124
01:40:59,052 --> 01:41:01,471
If we continue to rise in the respect
of the sodomites,

1125
01:41:01,763 --> 01:41:04,182
one day we shall
obtain everything by law,

1126
01:41:04,474 --> 01:41:05,934
rightfully.

1127
01:41:06,309 --> 01:41:09,980
You would put all of that
at risk through a rash act.

1128
01:41:10,397 --> 01:41:14,317
They change us more than we do them.
Their depravity infects us.

1129
01:41:14,859 --> 01:41:18,863
Look around here. Your clothes,
this food, this house.

1130
01:41:19,197 --> 01:41:20,699
We live in a nicer house,

1131
01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:24,035
because the elders
wished it.

1132
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:28,498
And Shuah, who paints her face,
and barely comes home?

1133
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,626
And my Maleb,
who avoids my gaze.

1134
01:41:32,877 --> 01:41:36,881
- Is that true?
- Shuah spends her time like other girls.

1135
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:39,050
As for Maleb,

1136
01:41:39,509 --> 01:41:42,846
if you thought of them as much
as you thought of the slaves,

1137
01:41:43,138 --> 01:41:45,056
if there were no difficulties
between you.

1138
01:41:45,348 --> 01:41:47,559
How can you judge innocence?

1139
01:41:56,192 --> 01:41:57,652
If you want to accuse me or my wife

1140
01:41:57,944 --> 01:42:02,490
of any wrongdoing,
bring it before the eiders.

1141
01:42:03,241 --> 01:42:04,492
The elders.

1142
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:09,497
Forgive him.

1143
01:42:09,998 --> 01:42:11,666
He's angry with me.

1144
01:42:11,958 --> 01:42:15,629
He doesn't realize how close
we are to success,

1145
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,214
without us having to use force.

1146
01:42:18,757 --> 01:42:21,051
- Did lot hear you?
- Heard yes.

1147
01:42:21,343 --> 01:42:24,721
That's all we expect.
He refuses to act.

1148
01:42:27,098 --> 01:42:28,808
The queen once told me

1149
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:32,937
between the hebrews and the world
there would be only sodom.

1150
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,190
Do you think so too?

1151
01:42:35,982 --> 01:42:37,275
Yes, I do.

1152
01:42:39,027 --> 01:42:43,198
Who do you think is the most
powerful Hebrew right now.

1153
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:45,325
My uncle, Abraham.

1154
01:42:46,534 --> 01:42:49,454
And should you convert sodom,

1155
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:52,624
who would be the most powerful then?

1156
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:55,293
Lot.

1157
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:57,587
I would be so proud of you.

1158
01:42:57,921 --> 01:42:59,339
- Proud?
- Mhm.

1159
01:43:00,882 --> 01:43:02,509
If that happened

1160
01:43:03,885 --> 01:43:05,929
then it would be jehovah's will.

1161
01:43:06,846 --> 01:43:09,432
I'm nothing more
than his tool.

1162
01:43:10,183 --> 01:43:11,476
His tool?

1163
01:43:12,477 --> 01:43:13,520
No.

1164
01:43:13,937 --> 01:43:16,439
It would be the credit of loft,
the man.

1165
01:43:18,274 --> 01:43:20,318
You
still don't understand.

1166
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:22,028
You lack true faith.

1167
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,197
That all the great things
that you do

1168
01:43:24,489 --> 01:43:25,573
are not your credit

1169
01:43:25,865 --> 01:43:29,160
and you owe it only to this
invisible jehovah?

1170
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:34,791
There are sure to be times when you know
whose achievement it really is.

1171
01:43:38,169 --> 01:43:40,296
Does your former
slave confuse you?

1172
01:43:40,588 --> 01:43:42,674
- Does she annoy you?
- No.

1173
01:43:44,634 --> 01:43:46,344
But I care about you.

1174
01:43:47,887 --> 01:43:51,683
If we should face hardship
and dangers again,

1175
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:55,186
then you are lost without faith.

1176
01:43:57,397 --> 01:43:59,190
Then I'll be lost.

1177
01:44:04,237 --> 01:44:07,198
I can't believe in something
that I can't see.

1178
01:44:07,532 --> 01:44:11,119
Hardship and poverty
I'll never endure again.

1179
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:12,912
I know that, never again.

1180
01:44:19,169 --> 01:44:21,212
But I don't need that either.

1181
01:44:22,088 --> 01:44:23,506
Because you protect me.

1182
01:44:27,552 --> 01:44:28,887
Isn't that enough

1183
01:44:29,846 --> 01:44:30,972
for now?

1184
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:33,892
That I believe in you?

1185
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:51,826
Your sister Maleb.

1186
01:44:59,334 --> 01:45:00,418
No.

1187
01:45:01,711 --> 01:45:02,837
No.

1188
01:45:03,713 --> 01:45:05,757
No, I just don't think so.

1189
01:45:06,049 --> 01:45:08,927
Because it makes you
angry. Because of this?

1190
01:45:29,697 --> 01:45:31,324
Maleb is too young,

1191
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:33,409
too innocent.

1192
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:35,745
Too cute to be so spoiled.

1193
01:45:36,746 --> 01:45:37,997
As I was.

1194
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:47,090
Younger yes.

1195
01:45:49,008 --> 01:45:50,301
And maybe,

1196
01:45:52,428 --> 01:45:53,680
maybe too

1197
01:45:55,098 --> 01:45:56,224
sweet.

1198
01:45:57,892 --> 01:45:59,018
You are lying.

1199
01:46:00,436 --> 01:46:03,022
If that's true,
if you loved her too,

1200
01:46:03,314 --> 01:46:05,984
- why should you tell me?
- Why not.

1201
01:46:06,276 --> 01:46:07,735
Didn't I succeed

1202
01:46:09,028 --> 01:46:10,697
to make you jealous?

1203
01:46:13,074 --> 01:46:14,409
Just admit it.

1204
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:18,413
You're jealous.

1205
01:46:20,081 --> 01:46:23,126
If only I knew.
If only I knew.

1206
01:46:30,091 --> 01:46:32,886
- What difference does it make?
- She's my sister.

1207
01:46:33,177 --> 01:46:36,222
Well then. Then you now have
even more in common.

1208
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:40,685
Also with the other Hebrew who
treasures our sodom, your father.

1209
01:46:41,019 --> 01:46:42,270
My father is good.

1210
01:46:42,562 --> 01:46:45,189
- He is perfect.
- Did I say something else?

1211
01:46:47,317 --> 01:46:49,694
He married a woman of ours.

1212
01:46:51,404 --> 01:46:53,573
Led your tribe into town.

1213
01:46:56,326 --> 01:46:58,244
What makes you different from him?

1214
01:46:59,495 --> 01:47:00,622
Or Maleb.

1215
01:47:01,956 --> 01:47:02,956
Or me.

1216
01:47:05,543 --> 01:47:07,629
Do I remember your father?

1217
01:47:23,478 --> 01:47:24,478
Captain.

1218
01:47:25,855 --> 01:47:27,065
Step closer.

1219
01:47:37,533 --> 01:47:39,327
Do you prefer the captain?

1220
01:47:40,119 --> 01:47:41,371
He's very beautiful.

1221
01:47:42,413 --> 01:47:43,456
Right?

1222
01:47:46,542 --> 01:47:48,461
Would you rather kiss him?

1223
01:48:03,059 --> 01:48:04,059
Come on.

1224
01:48:10,066 --> 01:48:11,484
Don't be afraid.

1225
01:48:14,612 --> 01:48:15,612
Come on.

1226
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:21,995
Kiss him.

1227
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:24,747
Go ahead.

1228
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:29,502
Isn't she beautiful?

1229
01:48:29,877 --> 01:48:31,129
Answer me.

1230
01:48:33,172 --> 01:48:34,966
Come on, take her in your arms.

1231
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:38,678
Answer me.

1232
01:48:39,345 --> 01:48:40,680
I thought

1233
01:48:41,222 --> 01:48:44,267
years of loyalty to you

1234
01:48:44,559 --> 01:48:46,978
deserves at least respect.

1235
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:55,069
Respect for a hypocritical dog
that wags its tail?

1236
01:48:58,906 --> 01:49:01,242
He goes and thinks
he's betraying me.

1237
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:05,455
The queen already
knows everything.

1238
01:49:09,167 --> 01:49:10,668
I'm close to death.

1239
01:49:21,554 --> 01:49:22,680
Those tears.

1240
01:49:24,474 --> 01:49:25,850
For you or me?

1241
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:27,727
For Maleb.

1242
01:49:38,237 --> 01:49:41,491
I'll make you
very happy tonight.

1243
01:50:17,193 --> 01:50:18,611
Look, the dancer here.

1244
01:50:18,903 --> 01:50:22,198
- The one next to it is better.
- The other one is more graceful?

1245
01:52:22,401 --> 01:52:23,778
Give me some rest.

1246
01:52:24,195 --> 01:52:26,656
Pay attention. Silence please.

1247
01:52:27,406 --> 01:52:29,742
I ask for silence on the queen.

1248
01:52:31,702 --> 01:52:35,122
My loyal subjects,
old citizens of this city

1249
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:37,583
and new ones.

1250
01:52:38,459 --> 01:52:40,711
On the faithful keeping
of the word of the hebrews,

1251
01:52:41,003 --> 01:52:43,923
which
is confirmed to us once again today.

1252
01:52:44,423 --> 01:52:46,884
By making the final payment
on their land.

1253
01:52:50,096 --> 01:52:54,600
To your great
esteemed colonel, lot.

1254
01:53:01,983 --> 01:53:05,611
The first against the Helamites,
the first in righteousness,

1255
01:53:06,237 --> 01:53:10,032
whom I hereby appoint as my
personal advisor.

1256
01:53:13,661 --> 01:53:16,497
To the highest dignitary of sodom.

1257
01:53:43,024 --> 01:53:45,735
My eternal gratitude
to the queen of sodom.

1258
01:53:50,031 --> 01:53:52,199
To peace and friendship.

1259
01:53:53,576 --> 01:53:56,996
May she rule forever
between the sodomites and the hebrews.

1260
01:53:57,330 --> 01:54:00,124
Just like the queen
over both peoples.

1261
01:54:08,549 --> 01:54:09,800
- Are the guards.
- Shh.

1262
01:54:16,515 --> 01:54:20,186
- How many are guarding the camp?
- 2. The slaves are ready.

1263
01:54:53,135 --> 01:54:55,721
Make way.
The gates open inward.

1264
01:54:56,013 --> 01:54:59,308
Back. You won't get out like that.
Make way! Return!

1265
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,185
Make way! Move out of the way!

1266
01:55:07,149 --> 01:55:08,234
Push them back!

1267
01:55:12,738 --> 01:55:14,031
Ishmael, this way!

1268
01:55:54,363 --> 01:55:57,616
If I were to do you an important service,

1269
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:02,371
would you give me the
position that was due to me back?

1270
01:56:02,663 --> 01:56:06,834
How about you do me
the service and then ask?

1271
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:16,260
There was a time

1272
01:56:16,844 --> 01:56:19,680
your wife
was such a good dancer too.

1273
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,778
Slaves, escaped slaves!

1274
01:56:35,196 --> 01:56:36,906
The slaves broke away.

1275
01:56:37,281 --> 01:56:39,825
- This way.
- They're going to Rob us.

1276
01:56:41,869 --> 01:56:44,121
Quickly to your houses. Hurry up.

1277
01:57:15,027 --> 01:57:17,446
- Not here.
- Take us in!

1278
01:57:17,738 --> 01:57:18,948
Hebrews, help us.

1279
01:57:20,407 --> 01:57:22,243
They are killing us. Let us in.

1280
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:26,621
Let's get in.

1281
01:57:26,789 --> 01:57:28,874
They're killing us. They kill us.

1282
01:57:30,834 --> 01:57:33,170
- We're trapped.
- You have to let us in.

1283
01:57:33,462 --> 01:57:34,462
Arrest them.

1284
01:57:58,237 --> 01:58:00,114
They are trying to free slaves.

1285
01:58:01,115 --> 01:58:03,617
- Tell them to be silent.
- Listen!

1286
01:58:04,076 --> 01:58:05,953
Listen! Silence please!

1287
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:09,707
A couple of ex-slaves
have attempted

1288
01:58:09,999 --> 01:58:12,293
to help their friends
to escape.

1289
01:58:12,918 --> 01:58:14,003
Don't worry.

1290
01:58:14,795 --> 01:58:18,215
Thanks to the loyalty of our
new Hebrew citizens

1291
01:58:18,507 --> 01:58:22,219
they and their treacherous
patrons could be caught.

1292
01:58:23,762 --> 01:58:24,763
Show them in.

1293
01:58:32,229 --> 01:58:33,230
Forward!

1294
01:58:41,113 --> 01:58:43,866
- Get the fire wheel ready.
- No, lot, help us!

1295
01:58:44,158 --> 01:58:44,700
No!

1296
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:48,203
As the leader of the hebrews
I invoke our right

1297
01:58:48,495 --> 01:58:49,580
to give refuge.

1298
01:58:49,872 --> 01:58:51,999
Your people
have refused them refuge.

1299
01:58:52,291 --> 01:58:54,126
They slammed the doors before us.

1300
01:58:54,418 --> 01:58:56,670
They have turned us over
to the guards.

1301
01:58:57,671 --> 01:59:00,007
That man over there is a Hebrew.

1302
01:59:00,466 --> 01:59:01,925
If he broke the law,

1303
01:59:02,217 --> 01:59:04,094
I claim the right to
punish him.

1304
01:59:04,428 --> 01:59:06,430
Whatever you want. Into jail.

1305
01:59:07,014 --> 01:59:09,725
- He may wait what lot decides.
- No!

1306
01:59:10,017 --> 01:59:12,770
I want to stay with them.
I want to stay with them.

1307
01:59:13,979 --> 01:59:15,814
And as for the others,

1308
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:19,026
your punishment will be
a welcome relief for us.

1309
01:59:19,318 --> 01:59:20,319
Save us, lot.

1310
01:59:20,611 --> 01:59:24,823
Neither I nor my people
approve of such a spectacle.

1311
01:59:25,407 --> 01:59:27,660
Maybe
you will ask your people first.

1312
01:59:46,512 --> 01:59:47,971
I don't hear any protest.

1313
01:59:52,810 --> 01:59:56,730
They seem to think that
the sentence is deserved.

1314
01:59:57,231 --> 01:59:59,608
- Take them away.
- Rise up, hebrews.

1315
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:01,110
You are stronger than them.

1316
02:00:01,402 --> 02:00:04,988
Don't let it happen.
Rise up. Save the slaves.

1317
02:00:05,489 --> 02:00:06,907
Save them!

1318
02:00:07,282 --> 02:00:09,535
- Save them!
- What are you waiting for, lot?

1319
02:00:10,828 --> 02:00:11,828
Save them.

1320
02:00:13,914 --> 02:00:17,459
Lot, save us. Don't watch
them kill us.

1321
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:19,461
Lot, save us.

1322
02:00:20,421 --> 02:00:21,672
Help us, lot!

1323
02:00:24,466 --> 02:00:25,592
Hebrews, help us.

1324
02:00:26,802 --> 02:00:29,638
Hebrews, do not let them
kill us.

1325
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:32,516
How can you expect them
to defend slaves?

1326
02:00:32,808 --> 02:00:33,808
If you know

1327
02:00:33,892 --> 02:00:37,187
that you do not even defend
the virtue of your family?

1328
02:00:38,439 --> 02:00:39,440
Your wife,

1329
02:00:42,609 --> 02:00:43,609
your wife,

1330
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:48,031
which has been
one of ours and will be again.

1331
02:00:48,699 --> 02:00:51,952
She knew it,
but she kept it from you.

1332
02:00:52,453 --> 02:00:55,622
Don't listen to him. He grudges you
the queen's esteem.

1333
02:00:55,914 --> 02:00:57,458
He's going to
set a trap for you.

1334
02:00:58,167 --> 02:01:00,085
She protects
your daughter Shuah.

1335
02:01:07,801 --> 02:01:11,722
You vowed to kill the
man who stole her innocence.

1336
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:17,436
I'd do it.

1337
02:01:18,061 --> 02:01:19,521
Then kill me.

1338
02:01:21,023 --> 02:01:23,192
Read the truth from her face.

1339
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:26,737
And the other one, Maleb,

1340
02:01:27,488 --> 02:01:30,449
that you think
is an innocent angel,

1341
02:01:32,493 --> 02:01:33,702
avenge her too.

1342
02:01:45,464 --> 02:01:46,464
Stop!

1343
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:49,593
A fight of equal value.

1344
02:01:50,552 --> 02:01:52,012
Is more entertaining.

1345
02:01:57,684 --> 02:01:58,727
Don't do it, lot.

1346
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,022
They're just trying to
challenge you.

1347
02:04:47,354 --> 02:04:48,939
Spare me, lot.

1348
02:04:49,439 --> 02:04:51,608
In the name of your god,
spare me.

1349
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:53,110
No, father, no!

1350
02:04:53,819 --> 02:04:56,863
I am to blame for everything.
Let him live!

1351
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:58,490
Let him live.

1352
02:05:09,751 --> 02:05:11,545
No! How could you?

1353
02:05:11,837 --> 02:05:16,091
You could have spared him,
all right, but you didn't.

1354
02:05:16,508 --> 02:05:17,718
You didn't do it.

1355
02:05:18,677 --> 02:05:21,304
Shuah, don't cry.

1356
02:05:22,889 --> 02:05:24,975
I won.

1357
02:05:25,809 --> 02:05:29,021
I promised you I would die

1358
02:05:30,564 --> 02:05:31,815
in your arms.

1359
02:05:34,192 --> 02:05:36,153
- Remember?
- No.

1360
02:05:37,279 --> 02:05:40,407
You mustn't die.
I won't let that happen.

1361
02:05:43,076 --> 02:05:44,286
Congratulations, lot.

1362
02:05:45,579 --> 02:05:47,456
How delicious it is to kill.

1363
02:05:48,749 --> 02:05:50,667
To see
how life flows out of the body.

1364
02:05:50,959 --> 02:05:53,086
And knowing I did that.

1365
02:05:55,839 --> 02:05:56,839
Why?

1366
02:05:57,090 --> 02:05:58,090
Why!

1367
02:05:58,675 --> 02:06:00,135
He begged for mercy!

1368
02:06:00,469 --> 02:06:01,720
Did he have mercy on you?

1369
02:06:02,262 --> 02:06:03,262
Or with Maleb?

1370
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:05,515
In the name of jehovah I punished him,

1371
02:06:06,308 --> 02:06:08,727
in jehovah's name
you also led us through the desert.

1372
02:06:09,895 --> 02:06:10,895
In jehovah's name

1373
02:06:11,521 --> 02:06:13,023
you brought us to sodom too.

1374
02:06:15,525 --> 02:06:17,027
You wanted to flatter your vanity.

1375
02:06:18,695 --> 02:06:20,197
Your arrogance.

1376
02:06:24,576 --> 02:06:27,370
But he did believe that
jehovah had hallowed his sword.

1377
02:06:27,954 --> 02:06:30,040
And he would have the right
to kill an evil man.

1378
02:06:30,874 --> 02:06:31,874
He had the right.

1379
02:06:32,334 --> 02:06:34,252
As the highest dignitary of sodom

1380
02:06:34,961 --> 02:06:36,046
he is the law.

1381
02:06:37,089 --> 02:06:38,089
What about the Helamites?

1382
02:06:40,592 --> 02:06:42,385
The Helamite warriors
were already defeated,

1383
02:06:42,677 --> 02:06:44,096
but you destroyed the dam

1384
02:06:44,387 --> 02:06:46,056
and drowned them down to the last man.

1385
02:06:46,389 --> 02:06:47,389
You murdered them.

1386
02:06:48,016 --> 02:06:49,184
In the name of justice.

1387
02:06:49,476 --> 02:06:50,596
And in the name of your god,

1388
02:06:50,936 --> 02:06:53,688
you gave yourself over to the
bloodlust with zeal and lust.

1389
02:06:55,023 --> 02:06:57,025
You are a real sodomite, lot.

1390
02:06:57,943 --> 02:06:59,069
Welcome.

1391
02:07:00,695 --> 02:07:01,695
No.

1392
02:07:03,448 --> 02:07:06,201
- No.
- Take a look at your hebrews.

1393
02:07:06,576 --> 02:07:07,576
Take a look at them.

1394
02:07:11,164 --> 02:07:14,042
Behind the exciting pleasure
of killing

1395
02:07:14,334 --> 02:07:16,545
the pleasure of watching is coming soon.

1396
02:07:17,129 --> 02:07:21,049
You enjoyed every moment
of the bloody spectacle.

1397
02:07:24,177 --> 02:07:26,930
You have converted
the chosen people, lot.

1398
02:07:27,806 --> 02:07:28,806
To sodom.

1399
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:32,269
I killed.

1400
02:07:36,439 --> 02:07:38,859
What does Hebrew law say about this?

1401
02:07:40,026 --> 02:07:42,946
Don't fall into her trap.
Be careful.

1402
02:07:43,613 --> 02:07:48,410
How would you judge such a murderer
judge lot?

1403
02:07:56,126 --> 02:07:59,629
Now speak, judge lot.
We wait for your words.

1404
02:08:05,468 --> 02:08:07,721
I would sentence him to the dungeon.

1405
02:08:09,598 --> 02:08:11,224
For the rest of his life.

1406
02:08:16,730 --> 02:08:19,941
Don't be
thrown into the dungeon. Fight.

1407
02:08:20,233 --> 02:08:21,233
Fight, lot.

1408
02:08:21,526 --> 02:08:25,447
Your people want to help you.
Believe me, they will help you.

1409
02:08:25,739 --> 02:08:29,701
Justice is an empty word.
Fight if you love me.

1410
02:08:30,493 --> 02:08:34,581
Don't you understand, you
had the right to kill him.

1411
02:08:36,333 --> 02:08:38,919
If you love me
I beg you.

1412
02:08:40,337 --> 02:08:41,421
Fight.

1413
02:08:47,052 --> 02:08:48,720
Don't you understand?

1414
02:08:51,264 --> 02:08:52,641
You don't understand.

1415
02:08:56,645 --> 02:08:57,646
Lot.

1416
02:08:58,271 --> 02:08:59,314
Lot.

1417
02:08:59,606 --> 02:09:01,274
Lot, lot.

1418
02:09:01,608 --> 02:09:03,735
What happened?
Why are you here?

1419
02:09:04,027 --> 02:09:05,403
What did they do to you?

1420
02:09:06,196 --> 02:09:07,239
Lot!

1421
02:09:07,656 --> 02:09:08,698
Lot!

1422
02:10:22,063 --> 02:10:23,063
No!

1423
02:10:30,905 --> 02:10:31,905
No!

1424
02:10:32,574 --> 02:10:33,574
No!

1425
02:10:35,869 --> 02:10:37,329
Faster! More quickly!

1426
02:10:45,253 --> 02:10:47,547
O lord god jehovah.

1427
02:10:48,882 --> 02:10:49,966
Help me.

1428
02:10:51,384 --> 02:10:53,428
How could I get so lost

1429
02:10:54,304 --> 02:10:56,222
and cause so much damage?

1430
02:10:56,723 --> 02:10:58,391
Where I only wanted good.

1431
02:11:00,101 --> 02:11:02,354
I have tempted my people,

1432
02:11:02,645 --> 02:11:03,772
that no one can resist.

1433
02:11:04,147 --> 02:11:07,025
I did that with your name on my lips.

1434
02:11:08,193 --> 02:11:10,695
But in my heart there was pride.

1435
02:11:12,447 --> 02:11:15,033
And now it's too late.

1436
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:18,745
The queen is right.

1437
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:22,749
If we're all as sinful
as she says,

1438
02:11:23,166 --> 02:11:26,086
let's destroy one another,
for we're not worth it.

1439
02:11:26,419 --> 02:11:29,381
May we be wiped out
from the face of the earth.

1440
02:11:30,006 --> 02:11:32,175
I ask you, my lord and god:

1441
02:11:33,468 --> 02:11:36,262
Is there nothing
in our hearts of yours?

1442
02:11:37,138 --> 02:11:38,223
Answer me.

1443
02:11:39,557 --> 02:11:44,104
If there's anything else in us
fighting for life,

1444
02:11:44,479 --> 02:11:47,607
in the midst of death and damnation,

1445
02:11:48,691 --> 02:11:50,110
give him your ear.

1446
02:11:52,028 --> 02:11:53,696
Speak to me, jehovah.

1447
02:11:55,365 --> 02:11:58,743
Let me know
if we are worth surviving.

1448
02:11:59,994 --> 02:12:02,539
Do we have a right to live?

1449
02:12:34,279 --> 02:12:36,281
We're bringing you a message.

1450
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:40,243
Jehovah's wrath
is upon these cities,

1451
02:12:40,535 --> 02:12:43,329
for they
have corrupted his chosen people.

1452
02:12:43,621 --> 02:12:46,374
In their sinfulness
would sodom and gomorrah

1453
02:12:46,666 --> 02:12:49,586
bring death and perdition
to all of god's creatures.

1454
02:12:49,878 --> 02:12:51,212
You have to go away. Lot.

1455
02:12:52,422 --> 02:12:54,757
You have to lead your people
away from here.

1456
02:12:55,049 --> 02:12:57,343
At sunset
will be the lord's vengeance

1457
02:12:57,635 --> 02:13:00,597
and destroy sodom and gomorrah
and everything that lives there.

1458
02:13:00,889 --> 02:13:05,018
I fervently thank jehovah for finding
us worth saving.

1459
02:13:05,310 --> 02:13:07,103
To be his tool on earth.

1460
02:13:08,021 --> 02:13:11,483
But will the lord
destroy all the sodomites? All?

1461
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:13,526
Guilty and innocent?

1462
02:13:15,236 --> 02:13:17,572
The innocent had enough time

1463
02:13:17,864 --> 02:13:21,826
to stand up against the guilty,
and have not done if.

1464
02:13:22,118 --> 02:13:23,703
But jehovah is gracious.

1465
02:13:24,037 --> 02:13:26,289
Should he find 50 righteous here,

1466
02:13:26,581 --> 02:13:28,917
does he not spare the
place for their sake?

1467
02:13:29,209 --> 02:13:31,419
Then look for these 50 righteous ones.

1468
02:13:31,711 --> 02:13:34,088
If there are that
many among the sodomites.

1469
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:35,548
40 for sure.

1470
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:39,302
Jehovah does not destroy 40
righteous people with sinners.

1471
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:43,264
Not even 30,
but not 20 or 10.

1472
02:13:44,265 --> 02:13:47,727
If I can make it, among the
sodomites there are only 10 righteous

1473
02:13:48,019 --> 02:13:52,357
found before sunset,
wouldn't he spare the rest?

1474
02:13:57,278 --> 02:14:00,365
Jehovah will spare all others for
the sake of 10 righteous people.

1475
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:03,868
But if the 10 do not exist,
he will born these cities with everything

1476
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:06,120
that is in its walls to the ground.

1477
02:14:06,454 --> 02:14:07,747
Remember, lot.

1478
02:14:08,915 --> 02:14:12,126
If some of those that you
take away will look back...

1479
02:14:12,502 --> 02:14:15,630
Jehovah knows that they
regret to live in sodom.

1480
02:14:16,005 --> 02:14:17,715
And he will destroy them.

1481
02:14:19,175 --> 02:14:20,969
Don't let anyone look back.

1482
02:14:21,469 --> 02:14:22,469
Nobody.

1483
02:14:23,429 --> 02:14:25,974
I thank you for your grace,
jehovah.

1484
02:15:00,008 --> 02:15:01,050
Lot.

1485
02:15:01,467 --> 02:15:03,678
Where are you? Ishmael?

1486
02:15:06,806 --> 02:15:07,849
Lot.

1487
02:15:11,561 --> 02:15:13,813
You mustn't stay
in jail.

1488
02:15:14,564 --> 02:15:17,525
You are our leader.
Say what to do.

1489
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:20,820
A miracle, I'm free.

1490
02:15:23,072 --> 02:15:24,157
See.

1491
02:15:25,199 --> 02:15:28,369
My chains have fallen off.
I'm free.

1492
02:15:30,496 --> 02:15:32,957
Lot too. He saw the miracle.

1493
02:15:34,584 --> 02:15:35,877
See his face.

1494
02:15:36,502 --> 02:15:37,502
His eyes.

1495
02:15:38,338 --> 02:15:40,923
Let's not talk about miracles,
we want our leader back.

1496
02:15:41,215 --> 02:15:43,676
Lot, you mustn't leave us.

1497
02:15:44,844 --> 02:15:46,262
I have sinned.

1498
02:15:47,055 --> 02:15:50,141
In my arrogance
I wanted to punish myself.

1499
02:15:51,392 --> 02:15:52,852
But now I know

1500
02:15:53,645 --> 02:15:56,773
someone else is going to punish me
according to his will.

1501
02:15:59,275 --> 02:16:00,275
Melchior.

1502
02:16:01,569 --> 02:16:03,488
We have to get out of this place.

1503
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:06,157
- Isn't it better to stay?
- No.

1504
02:16:06,949 --> 02:16:09,661
But we wanted
to convert the sodomites.

1505
02:16:10,536 --> 02:16:13,289
Hold on, on behalf of the queen.

1506
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:19,128
Let us through.

1507
02:16:19,587 --> 02:16:21,172
Now don't be a fool.

1508
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:24,175
- I have my orders.
- He's going to kill you.

1509
02:16:24,634 --> 02:16:26,010
In the name of Jehovanh.

1510
02:16:32,684 --> 02:16:33,685
My eyes!

1511
02:16:34,602 --> 02:16:35,937
My eyes!

1512
02:16:38,731 --> 02:16:42,402
We must tell our people
what we saw.

1513
02:16:46,072 --> 02:16:47,073
Stop it.

1514
02:16:47,615 --> 02:16:50,410
- Stop the wheel.
- Stop the wheel.

1515
02:16:51,536 --> 02:16:52,578
They are dead.

1516
02:16:53,788 --> 02:16:55,790
The pleasure is over.

1517
02:17:01,421 --> 02:17:03,631
Make way for the noble judge.

1518
02:17:03,923 --> 02:17:05,675
Or should it just start?

1519
02:17:06,592 --> 02:17:07,677
Friends.

1520
02:17:08,219 --> 02:17:09,220
Hebrews.

1521
02:17:09,846 --> 02:17:11,723
These cities are cursed.

1522
02:17:12,098 --> 02:17:15,476
We have to leave
before the sun goes down.

1523
02:17:24,152 --> 02:17:25,236
Guard.

1524
02:17:25,528 --> 02:17:27,280
- Get hold of this man.
- No.

1525
02:17:28,114 --> 02:17:30,408
Make way for him.
Let him speak.

1526
02:17:31,284 --> 02:17:32,660
This will be entertaining.

1527
02:17:32,952 --> 02:17:35,288
Lot, what do you
think of the fire wheel?

1528
02:17:39,167 --> 02:17:42,295
These cities will disappear
from the face of the earth.

1529
02:17:44,046 --> 02:17:45,465
Crumble to dust.

1530
02:17:48,926 --> 02:17:51,262
Hebrews, listen to me.

1531
02:17:51,721 --> 02:17:55,266
I brought you here
and tolerated

1532
02:17:55,641 --> 02:17:58,478
that you were corrupted
by an evil people.

1533
02:17:58,811 --> 02:18:01,189
But the lord
in his mercy

1534
02:18:01,939 --> 02:18:03,941
wants to save us one more time.

1535
02:18:04,567 --> 02:18:06,360
Come on, follow me.

1536
02:18:07,779 --> 02:18:09,989
Get out of this awful place.

1537
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:12,825
A miracle.

1538
02:18:13,868 --> 02:18:15,286
You have to believe.

1539
02:18:16,037 --> 02:18:18,414
Look, the sun,
it's already low.

1540
02:18:18,706 --> 02:18:22,877
We only have so much
time left until it goes down.

1541
02:18:23,753 --> 02:18:25,421
Why not burn him?

1542
02:18:25,713 --> 02:18:27,632
He's insane, insane.

1543
02:18:28,633 --> 02:18:30,259
He can't harm us.

1544
02:18:30,551 --> 02:18:32,929
You citizens of sodom and gomorrah.

1545
02:18:34,138 --> 02:18:37,183
If there are 10 of you
who come with us,

1546
02:18:37,642 --> 02:18:41,771
at least 10, then jehovah
will show mercy for their sake

1547
02:18:42,063 --> 02:18:43,648
and spare their cities.

1548
02:18:44,732 --> 02:18:45,733
Only 10.

1549
02:18:47,026 --> 02:18:49,487
10 who still
believe in life.

1550
02:18:50,363 --> 02:18:52,448
And not death.

1551
02:18:52,782 --> 02:18:53,782
Don't laugh.

1552
02:18:53,825 --> 02:18:55,743
I beg you, follow me.

1553
02:18:56,452 --> 02:18:57,954
Avenger of my lost innocence.

1554
02:18:58,412 --> 02:19:00,665
Now jehovah's personal ambassador.

1555
02:19:01,207 --> 02:19:02,542
Be glad he's free.

1556
02:19:03,376 --> 02:19:05,545
A man like lot
goes unusual ways.

1557
02:19:06,128 --> 02:19:08,756
Who knows what he's really thinking
what he's really up to?

1558
02:19:09,215 --> 02:19:10,299
You, come with me,

1559
02:19:10,758 --> 02:19:11,968
before it is too late.

1560
02:19:12,301 --> 02:19:13,301
Leave me alone.

1561
02:19:13,886 --> 02:19:15,805
Can't you see that I
am comfortable here?

1562
02:19:17,890 --> 02:19:20,726
God offers you the last opportunity to
turn his anger away from you.

1563
02:19:21,435 --> 02:19:24,313
Renounce your unnatural pleasures.

1564
02:19:25,022 --> 02:19:26,148
- Come on!
- Lot?

1565
02:19:27,817 --> 02:19:29,861
You defeated the Helamites,

1566
02:19:30,528 --> 02:19:34,073
freed me from my brother,
and now you want to leave?

1567
02:19:34,490 --> 02:19:35,616
Want to leave sodom,

1568
02:19:36,033 --> 02:19:38,995
which is richer in salt
than it was when you arrived?

1569
02:19:39,954 --> 02:19:41,080
Please, go.

1570
02:19:41,956 --> 02:19:44,333
If 10 of my people
want to go with you,

1571
02:19:44,625 --> 02:19:45,625
they should do it.

1572
02:19:49,213 --> 02:19:53,342
Avoid torture.
Think for the good of your people.

1573
02:19:53,801 --> 02:19:56,888
What you call sin
is virtue to me.

1574
02:19:57,889 --> 02:20:02,643
The mighty death that you
detest is my friend.

1575
02:20:05,479 --> 02:20:07,690
I have my back
on you, lot.

1576
02:20:09,191 --> 02:20:12,028
You and your feeble god.

1577
02:20:21,871 --> 02:20:26,000
Clouds, lightning. You teach your
people to fear such cheap miracles.

1578
02:20:26,542 --> 02:20:28,961
My people don't leave sodom out of fear.

1579
02:20:30,504 --> 02:20:31,923
But for faith in god.

1580
02:20:32,798 --> 02:20:34,842
Faith in him
who is mighty enough

1581
02:20:35,134 --> 02:20:37,011
to appear to us in
the shadow of a cloud.

1582
02:20:37,303 --> 02:20:39,889
Whose voice in the thunder
can speak to us.

1583
02:20:42,767 --> 02:20:44,560
Take a long look at this sun.

1584
02:20:46,646 --> 02:20:50,483
- You'll never see her again.
- Not until tomorrow morning.

1585
02:20:59,408 --> 02:21:00,493
Follow me.

1586
02:21:01,744 --> 02:21:03,913
Hebrews, have faith.

1587
02:21:04,789 --> 02:21:05,790
Pray.

1588
02:21:07,375 --> 02:21:09,085
Listen to the elders.

1589
02:21:10,127 --> 02:21:11,671
A hot wind from the desert.

1590
02:21:11,963 --> 02:21:15,007
A storm is approaching.
This is going to be beautiful.

1591
02:21:17,051 --> 02:21:18,051
Come with me.

1592
02:21:19,178 --> 02:21:20,388
Follow me.

1593
02:21:21,722 --> 02:21:24,183
Is it true
that sodom is going to be destroyed?

1594
02:21:24,475 --> 02:21:27,103
I only passed on
what I was told.

1595
02:21:27,478 --> 02:21:30,648
A message
I've been waiting for a long time.

1596
02:21:33,067 --> 02:21:35,403
Come on. Follow the eiders.

1597
02:21:35,987 --> 02:21:38,114
Goodbye. Goodbye.

1598
02:22:07,810 --> 02:22:11,022
Our people are waiting.
We must join them.

1599
02:22:11,814 --> 02:22:12,814
Maleb.

1600
02:22:14,108 --> 02:22:15,108
Maleb.

1601
02:22:23,659 --> 02:22:26,245
Shuah,
I have a lot to make amends.

1602
02:22:26,537 --> 02:22:29,290
I will do
what I can.

1603
02:22:29,665 --> 02:22:31,250
Only now please obey me.

1604
02:22:31,584 --> 02:22:33,961
- Go with your sister.
- I'm going.

1605
02:22:36,589 --> 02:22:37,590
I'm going.

1606
02:22:38,883 --> 02:22:41,427
Because I will
wait for the rest of my life

1607
02:22:41,719 --> 02:22:43,888
to hear you scream
how I screamed.

1608
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:47,349
I want to see you crushed
on the ground, crawling.

1609
02:22:48,184 --> 02:22:52,146
Until I see this,
I won't leave you.

1610
02:22:53,022 --> 02:22:54,106
Father.

1611
02:23:01,906 --> 02:23:05,159
I did not set myself free,
jehovah did.

1612
02:23:05,451 --> 02:23:08,704
Only he can overcome
sodom and gomorrah. Come.

1613
02:23:11,624 --> 02:23:15,169
Just so you know
that everyone will know.

1614
02:23:16,170 --> 02:23:18,380
That it is lot who does good.

1615
02:23:19,048 --> 02:23:20,925
That it is lot who has courage.

1616
02:23:21,425 --> 02:23:22,425
Come.

1617
02:23:45,699 --> 02:23:48,577
Hear me out. Listen to me.

1618
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:52,832
As I was told,
I will tell you now.

1619
02:23:53,124 --> 02:23:55,793
When we're out of town,
don't look back.

1620
02:23:56,085 --> 02:24:00,172
When any of you look back at sodom

1621
02:24:00,714 --> 02:24:01,715
then jehovah knows

1622
02:24:02,007 --> 02:24:05,136
that he is sorry to give up
life in sodom.

1623
02:24:05,427 --> 02:24:06,762
And he will destroy him.

1624
02:24:07,096 --> 02:24:09,598
Let nobody look back.
Nobody.

1625
02:24:10,349 --> 02:24:14,436
- Tell everybody, mouth to mouth.
- Nobody is allowed to look back.

1626
02:24:14,728 --> 02:24:16,772
Tell everyone backwards.

1627
02:24:17,565 --> 02:24:18,941
Don't look back.

1628
02:24:20,609 --> 02:24:22,069
Back! Return!

1629
02:24:23,362 --> 02:24:24,613
Get back!

1630
02:24:26,157 --> 02:24:27,241
Close the gates!

1631
02:24:32,121 --> 02:24:33,205
Back!

1632
02:24:45,342 --> 02:24:47,344
You are all free people now.

1633
02:24:47,887 --> 02:24:49,763
Come on, join us.

1634
02:25:08,824 --> 02:25:09,824
Look!

1635
02:25:10,034 --> 02:25:13,078
A miracle.
Opened by invisible hands.

1636
02:25:14,079 --> 02:25:17,958
It was jehovah's hand.
Jehovah has opened the gate for us.

1637
02:25:18,918 --> 02:25:23,339
- The lord is with us.
- A miracle? No, it was the wind.

1638
02:25:23,964 --> 02:25:26,050
The wind pushed open the gate.

1639
02:25:28,302 --> 02:25:29,553
Don't look back.

1640
02:25:30,304 --> 02:25:32,097
Don't look back. Go on.

1641
02:25:53,369 --> 02:25:54,745
Run! Run!

1642
02:25:58,040 --> 02:25:59,208
Lot, wait for us!

1643
02:26:14,556 --> 02:26:15,556
Come on.

1644
02:26:27,403 --> 02:26:28,696
Ildith, what have you got?

1645
02:26:29,238 --> 02:26:31,198
- I can't believe it.
- You have to.

1646
02:26:31,490 --> 02:26:33,284
- I can't.
- Yes, you have to.

1647
02:26:33,575 --> 02:26:35,452
- I've tried.
- Believe.

1648
02:26:43,460 --> 02:26:44,586
To the left.

1649
02:26:45,337 --> 02:26:46,547
Left.

1650
02:27:21,790 --> 02:27:26,170
It's just a bad storm.
Nobody needs to be afraid.

1651
02:28:09,004 --> 02:28:10,130
Ah!

1652
02:28:13,634 --> 02:28:16,553
An earthquake.
We've had that before.

1653
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:20,265
Stay with your queen.

1654
02:29:03,392 --> 02:29:04,476
Ah!

1655
02:29:25,622 --> 02:29:27,916
You should stay! You stay here!

1656
02:29:29,668 --> 02:29:32,754
Where do you want to go?
Do you want to hide?

1657
02:29:43,474 --> 02:29:44,516
Ah!

1658
02:30:43,575 --> 02:30:45,786
Don't look back.
Remember lot's words.

1659
02:31:29,246 --> 02:31:31,915
Lot's name
should be on her lips.

1660
02:31:32,457 --> 02:31:34,668
They have
to thank him for all the good

1661
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:36,670
that happened to them.

1662
02:31:37,129 --> 02:31:39,881
There is no jehovah.

1663
02:31:41,925 --> 02:31:44,219
Ildith, don't look back.

1664
02:32:18,879 --> 02:32:19,963
No!

1665
02:32:20,922 --> 02:32:21,923
Ildith!

1666
02:32:59,336 --> 02:33:00,337
No.

1667
02:33:02,255 --> 02:33:03,382
No.

1668
02:33:05,759 --> 02:33:08,178
Ildith!

1669
02:33:42,796 --> 02:33:43,964
My father.

1670
02:33:46,633 --> 02:33:47,718
Come, father.
