Bye, bye, Birdie

5
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:41,077
Bye, bye

6
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:45,711
- No more sunshine
- Sunshine

7
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:49,450
- It's followed you away
- You away

8
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:53,824
l'll cry, Birdie

9
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:57,422
Till you're home to stay

10
00:00:57,498 --> 00:01:01,594
I'll miss the way you smile
as though it's just for me

11
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:03,728
And each and every night

12
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:08,037
l'll write you faithfully

13
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:12,944
Bye, bye, Birdie

14
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:16,575
lt's awful hard to bear

15
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:21,145
Bye, bye, Birdie

16
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:25,352
Guess l'll always care

17
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:29,522
Guess l'll always care

18
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:33,465
Guess l'll always care

19
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:48,799
Look! Look! Hey!

20
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:15,696
We love you, Conrad

21
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,500
Oh, yes, we do

22
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,235
We love you, Conrad

23
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:23,937
And we'll be true

24
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:26,980
When you're not near us

25
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:28,116
We're blue

26
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,743
We're blue

27
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:35,187
Oh, Conrad, we love you

28
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:40,556
This is John Daly reporting
with the CBS mobile unit...

29
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:43,096
in front ot
the nation's capitol...

30
00:03:43,164 --> 00:03:47,931
bringing you on-the-spot coverage
of our current teenage crisis...

31
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:50,527
over the drafting
of Conrad Birdie.

32
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,473
Sociologists agree
that Birdie is a phenomenon.

33
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:58,478
For those few music lovers who have
never attended one of his concerts...

34
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:02,573
here are some news photos
tracing his meteoric rise.

35
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:48,828
And that-- that is
our army's newest weapon.

36
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:52,559
Private Birdie reports
for his induction in ten days.

37
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:56,763
His income drops
from $2 million a year...

38
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,102
to $7 8 a month.

39
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,700
lt could only happen in America.

40
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,640
Why?

41
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:10,582
Why did they have to dratt him?

42
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:13,347
Just when l tinally write a song
he's gonna do.

43
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:15,719
The title song
of his next picture.

44
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,657
''Mumbo Jumbo Gooey Gumbo.''

45
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:22,662
Now there's no picture.
There's nothing.

46
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:32,503
Albert, l have your tinancial statement,
it you really want to hear it.

47
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:36,270
''Total assets: $312.08.

48
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:39,836
Liabilities: $4,030.''

49
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:41,347
You--

50
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,822
Contidentially,
you're a fiscal tiasco.

51
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,917
Good-bye, Albert. lt's a sad ending
to a long association.

52
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:55,986
Yeah. Oh, don't you want
to say good-bye to Pidge?

53
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,002
Almaelou's busted, Pidge. You better
get yourself another meal ticket.

54
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:11,905
ln six years
l never sold one lousy song.

55
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:14,470
Maybe they weren't lousy enough.

56
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,881
l don't care
so much about myselt...

57
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:23,480
but l'm my mother's sole support.

58
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,650
l've wasted every cent
my father lett Mama--

59
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:28,820
lt's not your tault. Your mother
wants you to be a songwriter.

60
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:31,194
You can make a good living
as a biochemist.

61
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,827
That's a wonderful profession,
but Mama wants--

62
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:39,065
Just because she was
once in vaudeville...

63
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,200
doesn't mean you
belong in show business.

64
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:46,713
Confidentially, l respect my mother,
but I do what I want.

65
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,478
Well, Mama's sensitive.
When l upset her, she faints.

66
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:54,612
Why, with your ideas, you can
make a tortune in chemistry.

67
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,122
Chemistry.

68
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:01,025
Chemistry. Chemistry?
You sound like Rosie.

69
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:03,063
- Where is she? Where's Rosie?
- Oh, she phoned.

70
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,566
She heard about Birdie being dratted.
She's going to see Ed Sullivan.

71
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:11,298
Sure, to get another job.
Oh, a fine secretary!

72
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:15,775
Why, we have been practically engaged,
just waiting tor an okay trom Mama.

73
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:18,607
Now when I hit bottom,
Rosie deserts me.

74
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,614
Quits betore my body's even warm.

75
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:23,650
Ed Sullivan!

76
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,622
Would you send in
Rosie DeLeon, please?

77
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,685
ls it yes, Mr. Sullivan?
lt's just got to be yes.

78
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:38,459
- Rosie, it is yes.
- Oh, hallelujah!

79
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:42,992
Oh, l love you. Oh, that's marvelous.
Oh, l love you too! l'm so glad!

80
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,834
Miss DeLeon, l'd like you
to meet our producer, Bob Precht.

81
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:48,534
- Oh, hi. How are you?
- WelI, it's my pleasure.

82
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:51,840
lf you can overcome
your shyness, tell me...

83
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:54,540
what's our using Birdie
on the show got to do with you?

84
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:56,640
Let's face it,
l'm a scheming woman.

85
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:58,878
l have a promotion idea
that'll knock you out.

86
00:07:58,953 --> 00:08:01,444
lt you buy it,
l want a little tavor.

87
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,786
All right.
Let's try it on for size.

88
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,986
How'd you like a territic buildup
betore the show...

89
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:09,359
that'll have every TV set
tuned into you next Sunday?

90
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,593
We will have. After all,
we've got the Moscow Ballet and Birdie.

91
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,133
- This is bigger.
- Bigger?

92
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,294
Betore Conrad Birdie
goes into the army...

93
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,066
he bestows a farewell kiss
on all the swooning girls...

94
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,938
who worship him on your TV show.

95
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,638
Atter all, it's only an hour show,
and Birdie only gets four minutes.

96
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,414
He kisses them all symbolically.

97
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:30,450
- What'd you say?
- Symbolically.

98
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:33,919
- Actually, he'll only kiss one girl.
- He kisses only one girl?

99
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:36,616
Can't you see it? Birdie,
their idol, their leader...

100
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,250
kissing one tabulously
lucky teenage Tessie?

101
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:41,692
- Yeah! Yeah !
- lt'll melt every bobby pin in America.

102
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:45,198
lt's gigantic. The newspapers will eat
it up. Think of the advance publicity.

103
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:47,359
Get the Birdie's
fan club file right away.

104
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:49,699
- Get us a girl trom Ohio.
- Gotcha!

105
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,002
We'll do it from the outdoor theater,
Columbus, Ohio, right after the ballet.

106
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,272
- l'll get the girl.
- The network will handle the details.

107
00:08:57,344 --> 00:09:00,438
And atter the kiss,
Birdie sings a big song.

108
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:03,881
- That's where Rosie gets her payoff.
- l don't get it.

109
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:06,784
- The song is ''One Last Kiss.''
- Never heard of it.

110
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:09,789
- Hasn't been written yet.
- Who is going to write this classic?

111
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:14,294
Oh, who else, but my tuture husband,
Mr. Albert F. Peterson?

112
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,454
Birdie's been wanting
to give Albert a break tor six years.

113
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,828
l know he'll use the song,
if you say so.

114
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,303
Any song will do even though it's
written by your ever-lovin' Albert.

115
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:25,633
Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.

116
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:28,937
With a plug like this, that song
will sell a million records.

117
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:32,501
- Man, what royalties!
- We can sure use the money.

118
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,310
Any day now Albert and l
will have another mouth to teed.

119
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:37,714
Rosie, you're not even married yet.

120
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,777

00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:42,982

Long distance? I want Miss Kim McAfee,
Sweet Apple, 135, Sweet Apple, Ohio.

129
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,082
Marge, isn't it amazing what a woman
has to do to get a man to marry her?

130
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,090
You mean you doped
Albert's mother?

131
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,821
No, but if this doesn't work,
that's my next move.

132
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:23,796

Oh, the line's busy.

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,103

137
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:44,148
- Hello?
- Hello, Urse. This is Kim.

Oh, no! Kim McAfee, you didn't!
You really got pinned?

142
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:03,102
You mean you and Hugo have

143
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,867
Uh-huh. Oh,

144
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:09,705

It's like l've been reborn.

lt's like all of my lite until

149
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:28,624

Kim, where did he pin you?

157
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:52,417

Did they really get pinned
Did she kiss him and cry

Here, Pidge. Here, Pidgie.
Here, boy.

209
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:12,509
Don't jump! Don't jump!
Albert, it's all right!

210
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:16,488
Everything's all right!
Come on back! Don't worry.

211
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:18,889
Honey, come on.

212
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:24,489
- Thank heavens l got here in time.
- You almost pushed me out.

213
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,863
lt's all right.
l just came trom Ed Sullivan's otfice.

214
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:28,060
- Sullivan?
- Yes, Ed Sullivan.

215
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:32,299
Go to work for Sullivan. Leap from the
sinking ship while the house is on fire.

216
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:35,170
But hear this, Miss DeLeon.
l was loyal.

217
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:38,234
All the years l employed you, l never
looked tor a job behind your back.

218
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,076
- l went to Ed Sullivan's otfice--
- Don't explain.

219
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,879
You owe me nothing,
even though you were molded by me.

220
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:48,410
- Molded?
- Like Eliza Doolittle from Pygmalion.

221
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,515
- l was molded?
- What were you when l tound you?

222
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:55,323
Hostess at La Casa Enchilada
Taco and Tamale Shop.

223
00:15:56,396 --> 00:16:01,095
Well, sorry l interrupted you.

224
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,001
A man of my ilk
does not commit suicide.

225
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:07,370
l've had just about enough
of your kind ot ilks too.

226
00:16:09,543 --> 00:16:14,412
Suicide is for cowards.
l don't desert the woman l love.

227
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:22,081
Oh, Albert, l'm sorry.

228
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:27,485
- l should have known.
- Mama would never get over it.

229
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:30,155
Mama?

230
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,467
What's the matter?

231
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,834
I'm the prize dope ot all time...

232
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:41,238
thinking l could pry you away
from your mama's ever-lovin' tentacles.

233
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:44,038
l will thank you
to leave my mother out of this.

234
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:47,080
- Maybe she does influence me slightly.
- Slightly?

235
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:50,548
- She is old and frail.
- Which l will be, too, at this rate.

236
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:54,417
l don't blame you.
l was living in fantasy...

237
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:56,854
telling myselt you were serious.

238
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:59,518
Oh, Rosie, l was.

239
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:02,562
l am. ln here.

240
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:04,893
l've thought and thought
about marrying you...

241
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:08,765
every day, a lot of nights too.

242
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:11,929
l've spent six years
on Project Albert.

243
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:17,340
Well, now l haven't got the right.

244
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,972
l can't otfer you security.

245
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,885
A wonderful girl like you...

246
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:32,625
you deserve more trom a husband
than just personality and good looks.

247
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:42,331
But l'll always love you, Rosie.

248
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,969
You'd better always
love me, you nut...

249
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:54,775
because you're stuck with me.

250
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,350
Now, you've always worried
about repaying your mother, right?

251
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:04,584
Well, trom now on,
she'll be set for lite.

252
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:08,890
She can sit around on her big tat trust
fund. We'll have our own little house--

253
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,261
l don't care what Sullivan pays you.
No woman is supporting Albert Peterson.

254
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:15,495
- You're not listening, darling.
- l am not a gigolo.

255
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:19,801
Will you get to that piano
and start composing?

256
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:23,570
- Mary, l want Kim McAtee, Ohio.
- l'm through composing.

257
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,635
l was always through,
but now l know it.

258
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:28,977
That's right. You're a biochemist,
but this is one song you can sell.

259
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,017
- Huh?
- Okay, calI me back.

260
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:33,644
- As l was saying, huh?
- Gee, you're slow today.

261
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,280
Now, you are going to write
a song called ''One Last Kiss.''

262
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:40,053
ls this Albert's floor
or is it the one below?

263
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:44,291
''One Last Kiss.'' Now.

264
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:48,960
Oh, one last kiss
There never was such bliss

265
00:18:50,037 --> 00:18:52,005
l love your dentifrice

266
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:54,939
- A little too clinical, l think.
- Yeah, you're right, honey. Let's see.

267
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,443
Mama? She's never been to the otfice
since she discovered canasta.

268
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:05,076
Well, now's the perfect time
to tell her about dissolving Almaelou.

269
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:07,245
Yeah.

270
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,584
- And about us.
- Yeah.

271
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:15,617
Sonny!

272
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,823
- Mama!
- Baby!

273
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:22,597
What a nice surprise, and you're
just in time tor some wondertul news.

274
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,762
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, son.

275
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:27,136
l just tainted in the subway.
That's all.

276
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,175
But l didn't tall down.
It was too crowded.

277
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:32,609
- l keep tellin' ya, take a taxi.
- Taxis?

278
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:35,705
Taxis are for my successful son.

279
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:38,808
A dirty crowded subway
is good enough for a mother.

280
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:41,410
Mother's nothin' nowadays.

281
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:44,719
- Who's that?
- Mommy, you know Rose DeLeon.

282
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:50,252
- And guess what.
- This is that pretty Rose DeLeon?

283
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,493
Oh, l don't believe it.

284
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,593
Rose, what happened to ya?

285
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,400
You had a fatal sickness
or somethin'?

286
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:01,498
lt's nice to see you again.

287
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:05,507
Always on the job.
She's a credit to the firm.

288
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,911
Look at her, son.

289
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:11,508
l wonder some older man
hasn't snatched her away.

290
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,951
Personable matron.

291
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,750
- Speaking ot marriage.
- A wonderful institution.

292
00:20:16,823 --> 00:20:19,917
Your poor father and l--
That was a marriage.

293
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:22,257
May he rest in peace.

294
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:24,058
Don't worry, Lou.

295
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:26,895
- Our only child is taking care ot me.
- Tell her.

296
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,664
He'd never do anything to break
my heart. What about marriage?

297
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:32,796
It it was good enough
for you and Papa, it's good enough--

298
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:36,536
ln time. You're just a baby.

299
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:43,549
Hello. Yes, Operator.
l'll hold on.

300
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,849
And another thing, Mama,
l'm thinking of dissolving Almaelou.

301
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:50,617
Wait, Lou. l'm comin'.
l'll be right up there.

302
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,885
We can play canasta again.

303
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,325
Mama? Mama, forget it.
l'm sorry.

304
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:57,488
- You're sorry?
- Good-bye, sonny.

305
00:20:57,564 --> 00:21:00,124
Take care of yourself.
Think of me on Mother's Day.

306
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,134
- Good-bye, Rosie.
- Good-bye, Mae.

307
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:05,763
Call me Mrs. Peterson.
Wear your rubbers.

308
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,706
That's right, Operator.
Miss Kim McAfee.

309
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:18,282
l'll tell her, Rosie, tonight.

310
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:21,548
lt's entirely up to you, Albert.
The line is still busy?

311
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:24,416
Yes, Hugo.

312
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:28,052
Well, of course
l'll always wear it on everything.

313
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:32,121
Oh, except my gym blouse.
Miss Turgnisht won't allow it.

314
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,066
Tonight?
Well, l have no plans.

315
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:37,933
l think l can get out
till about 10:00.

316
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:41,030
Oh, you have to be in by 9:00.

317
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:43,302
Well, c'est la vie.

318
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,901
Until tonight then, mon amour.

319
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:47,412
Bye.

320
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:59,681
When you're a skinny child of 15

321
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,217
Wired with braces from ear to ear

322
00:22:03,296 --> 00:22:08,893
You doubt that
you will ever be appealing

323
00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:15,404
Then, hallelu jah, you are 16
and the braces disappear

324
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:18,069
And your skin is smooth and clear

325
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:22,308
And you have that happy grown-up

326
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,613
Female feeling

327
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:36,022
How lovely to be a woman

328
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:39,190
The wait was well worthwhile

329
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:42,463
How lovely to wear mascara

330
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:45,800
And smile a woman's smile

331
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:49,239
How lovely to have a figure

332
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:52,369
That's round instead of flat

333
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:55,710
Whenever you hear boys whistle

334
00:22:55,782 --> 00:22:58,410
You're what they're whistling at

335
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:01,579
lt's wonderful to feel

336
00:23:01,655 --> 00:23:04,715
The way a woman feels

337
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:08,818
lt gives you such a glow
just to know

338
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:11,489
You're wearing
lipstick and heels

339
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:15,665
How lovely to be a woman

340
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:18,761
And have one job to do

341
00:23:18,838 --> 00:23:22,069
To pick out a boy
and train him

342
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:25,339
And then when you are through

343
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:28,540
You've made him
the man you want him

344
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,709
To be

345
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,277
How lovely to be a woman

346
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,846
Like me

347
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:41,018
How wonderful to know

348
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:44,291
The things a woman knows

349
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:48,061
How marvelous to wait
for a date

350
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:51,399
ln simply beautiful clothes

351
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,804
How lovely to be a woman

352
00:23:54,874 --> 00:23:58,139
And change from boys to men

353
00:23:58,211 --> 00:24:01,374
To go to a fancy nightclub

354
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:04,781
And stay out after 10:00

355
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:08,014
How lovely to be so grown up

356
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:11,285
And free

357
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:20,127
Life's lovely
when you're a woman

358
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:26,033
Like me

359
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:45,382
Hello? Oh? Well,

360
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,653

She says it's long distance.

361
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:49,922
- Thank you, Doris.
- Who could be calling Kim--

362
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:52,692
- Did you say ''Doris''?
- lt's the modern way, dear.

363
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:55,701
Makes mother and daughter
more like friends.

364
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:59,535
Harry, l think you took the news
about Hugo and l awtully well. Hello?

00:25:08,014 --> 00:25:11,950
Well, maybe you could call me Mom.
That's modern.

369
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:17,547
Times are changing. You go along
or else you're out ot it.

370
00:25:17,624 --> 00:25:19,888
Harry, do you have a cigarette?

to be kissed by Conrad Birdie on
The Ed Sullivan Show this Sunday night.

376
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:37,135

377
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,144

Then we'll all recite our pledge

We love you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

We love you, Conrad
and we'll be true

393
00:26:54,254 --> 00:26:57,917
When you're not near us
we're blue

394
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:01,392
Oh, Conrad, we love you

395
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:05,261
We hate you, Conrad
Oh, yes, we do

396
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:09,131
We don't hate anyone
as much as you

397
00:27:09,202 --> 00:27:12,865
Your singing makes us say, P.U.

398
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:16,375
Oh, Conrad, we hate you

399
00:27:16,442 --> 00:27:20,378
We love you, Conrad

- We love you

403
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:38,590
Hugo wants to talk to Kim.

404
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:41,958
That's if it's okay with Kim.

405
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,562
- Certainly, Hugo.
- WeIl, Kim--

406
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:47,805
Yes?

407
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:02,880
Hugo, what do you want?

408
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,224
Gee, Kim, the tellows
are makin' me do this.

409
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:10,956
But just the same, they're right.

410
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,191
Kim, you can't
go through with this.

411
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:15,427
Hugo, please be mature.

412
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:18,470
Doesn't gettin' pinned
mean anything these days?

413
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:22,975
lt means everything.
lt's sacred.

414
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:27,775
Well, then how can you let
another man kiss you and in public?

415
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:31,112
- l assure you l won't even feel it.
- Huh?

416
00:28:31,184 --> 00:28:34,278
- l'm just a symbol.
- A symbol?

417
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:39,449
Don't you see?
This is bigger than us.

418
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:43,086
Why, all this publicity
for Sweet Apple.

419
00:28:43,162 --> 00:28:45,824
Thousands of people
will move here.

420
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:49,299
We'll have
a population explosion.

421
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:55,097
And just think what this will do
for your father's undertaking business.

422
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:59,809
- Hey, yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

423
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:06,417
But you really don't go
tor that Birdie creep, do you?

424
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:10,014
What do my eyes tell you?

425
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:21,159
No, you don't.
l can see you're all mine.

437
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:06,338
Gee, Mr. Paisley, we think you're okay
even if you are the English teacher.

438
00:30:06,412 --> 00:30:08,346
lt should be
a tascinating experience.

439
00:30:08,414 --> 00:30:11,144
- Yeah, but are you with them?
- ''With them?''

440
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:13,981
Yeah, that Birdie creep--
He's poisoned our women.

441
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:16,954
lt's bad enough the mayor's a fink,
but you, Mr. Paisley--

442
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,720
Well, you see, fellows, as a teacher

He's not so much.

495
00:35:40,112 --> 00:35:44,913
You gotta be sincere

496
00:35:44,984 --> 00:35:47,145
Edna, what's wrong?

497
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:50,347

499
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:55,523
You gotta feel it here

500
00:35:55,594 --> 00:35:58,222
'Cause if you feel it here

501
00:35:58,297 --> 00:36:00,891
Well, then you're gonna be

502
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:06,199
Honestly sincere

503
00:36:09,975 --> 00:36:13,467
lf what you feel is true

504
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,744
You really feel it
You make them feel it too

505
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:22,584
Write this down now
You gotta be sincere

506
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:24,919
Honestly sincere

507
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,823
Man, you've gotta be

508
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:33,331
Sincere

509
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,468
lf you're really sincere
lf you're really sincere

510
00:36:38,537 --> 00:36:41,438
If you feel it in here
then it's gotta be right

511
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:43,372
Oh, baby

512
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:45,376
Oh, honey

513
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:47,435
Hug me

514
00:36:47,513 --> 00:36:50,073
Ah, suffer

515
00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:57,178
ln everything l do

516
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,714
Why, my sincerity shows through

517
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,790
Yeah, when I look you in the eye
l don't even have to try

518
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:09,995
It's automatic
l'm sincere

519
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:14,199
When l sing about a tree

520
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:17,674
Listen, why
l really feel that tree

521
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,406
Yeah, when I sing about a girl

522
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,414
l really feel that girl

523
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:26,007
l mean, l really feel

524
00:37:26,085 --> 00:37:30,488
Sincere

525
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,217
Why, if you're really sincere

526
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,227
lf you're really sincere

527
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,128
lf you feel it in here
then it's gotta be right

528
00:37:39,198 --> 00:37:41,132
Oh, baby

529
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,031
Oh, honey

530
00:37:43,102 --> 00:37:45,036
Hug me

531
00:37:45,104 --> 00:37:46,867
Ah, suffer

532
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,074
Yeah, here we go now

533
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,305
Why, you gotta be sincere

534
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:57,179
Oh, you gotta feel it here

535
00:37:57,249 --> 00:38:00,116
Oh, my baby, oh, my baby

536
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:01,983
Oh, yeah

537
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:05,615
Oh, my baby, oh, yeah

538
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:07,181
Go, girl, go

539
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:09,819
Ursula! What are you doing?

540
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:15,194
Are you gonna be sincere
Are you gonna be sincere

541
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:16,529
Yeah

542
00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:18,968
Are you gonna be sincere
Are you gonna be sincere

543
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:20,335
Yeah

544
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,937
We love you, Conrad

545
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:38,882
Oh, yes, we do

546
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:43,047
We love you, Conrad

547
00:39:43,122 --> 00:39:47,183
And we'll be true

548
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:51,662
When you're not near us

549
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,496
We're blue

550
00:39:55,567 --> 00:40:01,028
Oh, Conrad, we love you

551
00:40:01,874 --> 00:40:03,603
Randolph, your father's warned you.

552
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:06,167
lt you make another bomb,
you'll get spanked.

553
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:12,047
- lt was an accident, Mom.
- Now, get this stuft out ot here.

554
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,384
Doris! Doris!

555
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,019
Doris, what's going on here?

556
00:40:23,095 --> 00:40:25,120
Harry, where have
you been since supper?

557
00:40:25,197 --> 00:40:27,688
ln plenty of trouble, that's where.
But l'm not now. No, sirree.

558
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:30,064
You kids go home before
l sick the constable on ya!

559
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:33,195
Go on! Get that carnival
oft my front lawn!

560
00:40:33,272 --> 00:40:34,933
l'll show them who's boss.

561
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:38,499
Harry McAtee's not going to be
pushed around by any roll and rocker.

562
00:40:38,577 --> 00:40:41,569
- Harry, they'll hear you.
- Let 'em hear me!

563
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:45,515
-Put those chemicals away and go to bed.
-Yes, Papa.

564
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:52,052
We're in troubIe.
He can't stand Conrad living here.

565
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,390
Especially around
his pretty young daughter.

566
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:03,394
She's still under the magic spell.

567
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:11,131
Dear little Conrad certainly
has a devastating impact.

568
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,802
He might make a territic soldier.

569
00:41:12,878 --> 00:41:15,472
Turn him loose and the enemy
will twitch itselt to death.

570
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,913
l don't care.
l've changed my mind.

571
00:41:17,983 --> 00:41:21,646
My daughter is not going to be
publicly kissed by that-- that wiggler.

572
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,119
The deal is ott.

573
00:41:23,188 --> 00:41:26,123
But, dear, you know these adolescents.
Kim will lose tace.

574
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:29,422
lt l don't get rid of that Birdie,
that's not all she'll--

575
00:41:31,096 --> 00:41:36,227
Hear this. l have decided that bunch
of grafters is getting out ot here.

576
00:41:36,301 --> 00:41:40,294
That is the unshakable decree that
l have made as head of this household.

577
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,567
- So you go upstairs and tell them.
- Me?

578
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:45,405
How can l tell Mr. Peterson
and that nice Miss DeLeon?

579
00:41:45,477 --> 00:41:49,743
Nice? I know that show business crowd--
probably living in sin.

580
00:41:49,815 --> 00:41:52,113
Harry Lionel McAtee!

581
00:41:52,184 --> 00:41:54,709
l never told you, but one summer
l worked tor the circus.

582
00:41:54,787 --> 00:41:57,312
- Oh, those midgets, wild.
- Not another word.

583
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,187
She's been engaged to Peterson
tor six years. Don't tell me they--

584
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:04,320
- We were engaged for tive years.
- He's not as stupid as l was.

585
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,830
- Are you stupid, Pop?
- Find out for yourselt!

586
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,867
That's the trouble
with kids today! Lazy!

587
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:12,370
Will you go up? Get up to bed!

588
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:16,306
Oh, Harry, they'll be gone
day atter tomorrow.

589
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:19,833
l'm a peace-loving man,
a good father and husband.

590
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,010
And the result?

591
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:27,018
The home l hewed out of this wilderness
with my bare hands is no longer mine.

592
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,317
Tonight l had to wait
until 6:00 tor my supper.

593
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:34,052
And that Peterson grafter, running up
my phone bill with long-distance calls!

594
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:38,324
- He oftered to reimburse you.
- l don't take Diners Club cards!

595
00:42:38,397 --> 00:42:43,858
Then that snake in a gold suit insists
on parking in my beautiful living room.

596
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:48,337
- Do you know where l've just been?
- No, dear.

597
00:42:48,407 --> 00:42:51,171
To a meeting with the big boys,
Kelsey, Judge Blanch, Joe Kipp.

598
00:42:51,243 --> 00:42:55,407
My biggest customers. They don't approve
ot this kind ot notorious goings-on.

599
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:57,415
Darling, they put pressure on you?

600
00:42:57,483 --> 00:43:02,614
lf l don't cancel this whole Birdie
deal, they'll starve me out of business.

601
00:43:02,688 --> 00:43:06,215
- Oh, my heavens!
- lt's them or us.

602
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:16,367
- What happened?
- Are you all right?

603
00:43:16,435 --> 00:43:18,426
- What's wrong?
- lt was just Randolph's chemicals.

604
00:43:19,505 --> 00:43:22,997
No, a mixture ot iron sultide
plus two parts H2SO4.

605
00:43:23,075 --> 00:43:25,566
Smart boy you have there. It isn't
every lad who can make a stench bomb.

606
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:29,444
- Which brings me to Mr. Birdie.
- Mr. Peterson is really a biochemist.

607
00:43:29,515 --> 00:43:32,109
- l couldn't care less.
- l have one tormula, a secret.

608
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:35,847
lt's miraculous because it increases
the work output of domestic animals.

609
00:43:35,921 --> 00:43:38,412
- Now about this Birdie.
- lt speeds up the reflexes.

610
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,424
An ox, for instance,
could outrun a racehorse.

611
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:43,825
By adding in his tormula,
a hen will lay three eggs a day.

612
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:46,456
Three eggs a day? lt that's so,
you could make a million times--

613
00:43:46,532 --> 00:43:48,796
l've been nursing
this compound for years.

614
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:51,927
- Still needs more tests, but it works.
- Aren't you in farming?

615
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,234
- He's McAtee Fertilizer.
- Oh, yes.

616
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:56,240
- Been in it tor 20 years.
- Really?

617
00:43:56,308 --> 00:43:57,798
But l may be out if--

618
00:43:57,876 --> 00:44:01,710
lt you and Albert got together,
you could revolutionize farm production.

619
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,975
Would you like a demonstration?
Do you have a hen?

620
00:44:05,284 --> 00:44:07,946
- How about trying it on that?
- A tortoise? l don't know.

621
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,853
Sure! lt won't bite.
Here. Let me.

622
00:44:14,393 --> 00:44:17,294
Ot course, there isn't
much demand for turtle eggs.

623
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:21,128
But if it really works
on tarm animals...

624
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,259
maybe you and me
could do some business.

625
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:29,332
l'll sure need something it l let Kim
go through with this Birdie stutf.

626
00:44:29,408 --> 00:44:31,842
Some of Harry's customers
are against it.

627
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,606
Yeah, and so l've decided
it's absolutely out of the question.

628
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,875
Your neighbors are just
going to be thrilled...

629
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:41,215
when they see the two of you
on The Ed Sullivan Show.

630
00:44:41,286 --> 00:44:43,311
The Ed Sullivan Show.

631
00:44:43,388 --> 00:44:47,552
- We were saving that as a surprise.
- Yes, a surprise.

632
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:49,651
Me on Ed Sullivan?

633
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,753
Oh, l'd die. What would l wear?

634
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,764
- We'll find something.
- Gee, Ed Sullivan.

635
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:55,459
He's my favorite human.

636
00:44:55,534 --> 00:44:58,935
That's why l decided to let Kim go on
in the first place.

637
00:44:59,004 --> 00:45:01,336
Me on The Ed Sullivan Show?

638
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:04,807
Ed Sullivan

639
00:45:06,445 --> 00:45:09,141
Me, Harry McAfee appearing with

640
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:12,012
Ed Sullivan

641
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,943
We're gonna be on Ed Sullivan

642
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,255
How could any family be

643
00:45:51,323 --> 00:45:55,487
Half as fortunate as we

644
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:59,291
We'll be coast to coast

645
00:45:59,364 --> 00:46:02,822
With our favorite host

646
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:21,341
We're gonna be on Ed Sullivan

647
00:46:26,024 --> 00:46:27,958
l've got a wonderful wife

648
00:46:28,026 --> 00:46:32,395
Two swell kids
a good business and now this

649
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:36,692
Someday we'll recall

650
00:46:36,768 --> 00:46:40,829
The greatest day of all

651
00:46:40,906 --> 00:46:42,840
Ed, l love you.

652
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:02,021
Hello?

653
00:47:02,094 --> 00:47:06,224
Oh, yes. Harry,
it's the mayor. He sounds mad.

654
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:09,233
l'Il handle this.

655
00:47:10,902 --> 00:47:13,029
Yes? Yes, Mayor?

656
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:15,403
Yes, the boys talked to me.

657
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:19,808
Yep, l've decided.
Birdie stays right here...

658
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,971
and Kim's on TV.

659
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,605
And what's more...

660
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:27,846
l'm gonna be on the show, too,
with Eddy Sullivan.

661
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:32,788
Now, listen, Harry. You saw what
that crazy galoot did at the reception.

662
00:47:34,326 --> 00:47:36,851
lt was a disgrace.

663
00:47:36,928 --> 00:47:41,331
Look, Mayor,
you're gonna be on TV too.

664
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,096
They want you to make a speech.

665
00:47:45,804 --> 00:47:49,331
They want me on Ed Sullivan?

666
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,345
A short speech.
Why, sure!

667
00:47:56,148 --> 00:47:59,549
l could become
a statewide tace.

668
00:47:59,618 --> 00:48:01,643
lt's a deal, Mayor.

669
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,484
Sure l'll plug you up tor governor.

670
00:48:04,556 --> 00:48:06,888
Bye, Sam.

671
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:08,391
What a hambo.

672
00:48:09,461 --> 00:48:13,397
Well, it's been a long day,
so l think we'll--

673
00:48:23,074 --> 00:48:25,634
l'm thinking of calling them ''Speed Up.''
You like it, Mr. McAfee?

674
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,508
''Feed up with Speed Up.''
l love it, partner.

675
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,573
- How will Randolph catch his tortoise?
- Just give him one of these.

676
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:35,484
Hi, Mr. McAfee.
Gee, l just wanted to thank you.

677
00:48:35,554 --> 00:48:39,991
My dad said you're not letting Kim
go on TV and kiss that-- that.

678
00:48:40,058 --> 00:48:45,963
lt can't be true. You wouldn't
destroy Kim, your own tlesh and blood!

679
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:48,829
Sure he would.
A tather has a right, right?

680
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,165
Hugo, my daughter's old enough
to make her own decisions...

681
00:48:52,237 --> 00:48:54,762
so l've decided to let her do it.

682
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:59,899
Well, in that case, your daughter
is the tormer future Mrs. Hugo Peabody.

683
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,344
Oh, Hugo,
stop acting like a child.

684
00:49:02,414 --> 00:49:05,008
Kim! Where is he?
Can l see him?

685
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:07,017
Conrad's asleep, poor dear.

686
00:49:07,085 --> 00:49:09,144
You may peek through
his keyhole while l--

687
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:13,055
while l discuss this tempest
in a tea bag with Hugo.

688
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:29,302
You're lucky people.

689
00:49:29,374 --> 00:49:32,901
What'd we ever do
to deserve such a daughter?

690
00:49:32,978 --> 00:49:34,912
We got married.

691
00:49:36,314 --> 00:49:37,611
Marriage.

692
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:38,774
- But, Kim--
- Hugo--

693
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,011
- Yeah, but, Kim--
- l don't have time tor a debate.

694
00:49:41,086 --> 00:49:43,646
Ursula's waiting. l've got to learn
my speech tor tomorrow's rehearsal.

695
00:49:43,722 --> 00:49:47,715
Wait a minute, Kim.
Don't go yet, please.

696
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:51,659
You don't know what l've been through
with all the guys buggin' me...

697
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:54,221
well, about you
and that Birdie creep.

698
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:56,233
Oh, that.

699
00:49:56,301 --> 00:49:57,825
Yeah, that!

700
00:49:57,903 --> 00:50:02,033
Why, that's silIy.
He means nothing to me.

701
00:50:06,077 --> 00:50:08,341
One boy

702
00:50:09,614 --> 00:50:13,550
One special boy

703
00:50:13,618 --> 00:50:16,610
One boy to go with

704
00:50:16,688 --> 00:50:20,920
To talk with and walk with

705
00:50:20,992 --> 00:50:23,517
One boy

706
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:28,464
That's the way it should be

707
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:32,230
Yeah, yeah,
that's the way it should be.

708
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:34,363
One boy

709
00:50:34,439 --> 00:50:36,964
One certain boy

710
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:39,670
One boy to laugh with

711
00:50:39,744 --> 00:50:43,407
To joke with, have Coke with

712
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:46,177
One boy

713
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:51,211
Not two or three

714
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,023
One day

715
00:50:57,095 --> 00:51:00,292
You'll find out

716
00:51:00,365 --> 00:51:05,268
This is what life is all about

717
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:08,863
You need

718
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,068
Someone who

719
00:51:12,143 --> 00:51:14,703
ls living

720
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:18,545
Just for you

721
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,984
One boy

722
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:24,317
One steady boy

723
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:26,983
One boy to be with

724
00:51:27,058 --> 00:51:30,516
Forever and ever

725
00:51:30,595 --> 00:51:33,496
One boy

726
00:51:33,565 --> 00:51:38,867
That's the way it should be

727
00:51:39,938 --> 00:51:41,906
That's the way

728
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:46,103
lt should be

729
00:51:53,718 --> 00:51:57,711
Now is that the kiss of a woman
interested in any other man?

730
00:52:00,091 --> 00:52:03,822
l don't know.
How do l tell?

731
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:11,798
- Ah, but he made you taint.
- Oh, he did not!

732
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,533
l was just exhausted,
cramming for my English exam.

733
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:24,644
You've got to try
to understand me as a woman.

734
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:28,015
Now, l might like
Conrad as a friend...

735
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:30,384
but when it comes
to the real thing...

736
00:52:31,456 --> 00:52:35,085
the grand passion...

737
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:39,130
well, that's something
special, Hugo.

738
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,028
That's you.

739
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:46,997
One day you'll find out

740
00:52:47,072 --> 00:52:50,564
This is what life is all about

741
00:52:50,642 --> 00:52:55,272
You need someone who

742
00:52:55,346 --> 00:53:02,013
ls living just for you

743
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:06,786
One boy, one steady boy

744
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:09,190
One boy to be with

745
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,888
Forever and ever

746
00:53:11,963 --> 00:53:14,761
One boy

747
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:19,861
That's the way it should be

748
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:24,273
That's the way

749
00:53:24,342 --> 00:53:30,212
lt should be

750
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,083
Homework!
Hey, l got homework to do.

751
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:56,373
When will he find out

752
00:53:56,441 --> 00:54:01,344
This is what life is all about

753
00:54:02,747 --> 00:54:07,616
Will he ever see

754
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,520
l need him

755
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,615
And he

756
00:54:14,692 --> 00:54:19,356
Needs me

757
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:23,526
- One boy
- One special boy

758
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:27,264

- One boy to be with always

759
00:54:27,338 --> 00:54:29,533

00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:46,884
- Him so
- lt should be

764
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:51,055
That's the way

765
00:54:51,129 --> 00:54:55,498
lt should be

766
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:03,740
That's the way

767
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:10,781
lt should be

768
00:55:29,601 --> 00:55:31,535
Hello, Sweet Apple Drive-in?

769
00:55:31,603 --> 00:55:34,333
l'm looking tor my mother,
Mrs. Peterson.

770
00:55:34,405 --> 00:55:38,535
Are you sure there's no one left
in your drive-in? Okay, thank you.

771
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,340
Don't worry, partner.
Your mother will get along tine.

772
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:43,812
Sweet Apple's
full ot friendly folk.

773
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,783
lt anything happens to her,
I'll never forgive myself.

774
00:55:46,851 --> 00:55:48,978
- What kind of a dump is this?
- ''Dump''?

775
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:51,453
Conrad. Let's humor him, partner.

776
00:55:51,522 --> 00:55:53,786
lf he walks otf
the Sullivan show, we're sunk.

777
00:55:53,858 --> 00:55:55,291
Gotcha.

778
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:00,489
l can't tind no church key
in my room.

779
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,966
Church key? We've had
a church here, but it's open.

780
00:56:04,035 --> 00:56:08,438
A can opener, man.
You're from nowherelike.

781
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:22,810
That's my tavorite brand.

782
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:26,186
Well, it's bedtime, huh, Conrad?

783
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:32,695
Okay for tonight,
but tomorrow's Saturday...

784
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:36,200
and that's my real tense night.

785
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:47,443
Thanks, Mr. McAtee.

786
00:56:47,512 --> 00:56:51,642
The next time l have a daughter,
l hope it's a boy.

787
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:53,741
l am a lucky man though, Albert.

788
00:56:53,818 --> 00:56:56,252
Meeting up with
a biochemical wizard.

789
00:56:56,321 --> 00:56:59,688
Peterson and McAfee
are going right to the moon.

790
00:56:59,757 --> 00:57:03,818
l've got to, not just
tor my mother, for Rosie.

791
00:57:10,702 --> 00:57:13,432
Well, l guess l'll get
a little air and turn in.

792
00:57:13,504 --> 00:57:15,665
Take all the air you want, chum.

793
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,023
Hi, Rosie.

794
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:40,195
Rosie, you don't have
to worry about Mama. She'll show up.

795
00:57:40,264 --> 00:57:43,131
- l'm certain she will.
- Then you ought to be happy.

796
00:57:43,201 --> 00:57:45,897
Kim's on the show.
Conrad does my song...

797
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,734
and l promise
l'll tell Mama about us.

798
00:57:50,975 --> 00:57:52,408
Come on.

799
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,416
Why look so awfully tragic

800
00:58:07,492 --> 00:58:10,086
Put on a happy face

801
00:58:10,161 --> 00:58:12,857
Smiling can work like magic

802
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,524
Put on a happy face

803
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,660
Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy

804
00:58:18,736 --> 00:58:21,000
lt's not your style

805
00:58:21,072 --> 00:58:26,408
You look so good that
you'll be glad ya decided to smile

806
00:58:26,477 --> 00:58:29,173
Pick out a pleasant outlook

807
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,807
Stick out that noble chin

808
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,818
Wipe off the full of doubt look

809
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,821
Slap on a happy grin

810
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:42,087
And spread sunshine
all over the place

811
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,620
Just put on a happy face

812
00:58:50,768 --> 00:58:53,202
Flowers?

813
00:58:53,271 --> 00:58:55,967
Put on a happy face

814
00:58:58,342 --> 00:59:00,970
Put on a happy face

815
00:59:01,045 --> 00:59:03,775
Why do you mope around so sourly

816
00:59:03,848 --> 00:59:06,043
lt's such a strain

817
00:59:06,117 --> 00:59:08,950
l always try to chuckle hourly

818
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,614
lt clears the brain

819
00:59:14,025 --> 00:59:16,459
l knew a girl so gloomy

820
00:59:16,527 --> 00:59:18,654
She'd never laugh or sing

821
00:59:18,729 --> 00:59:21,425
She wouldn't listen to me

822
00:59:21,499 --> 00:59:23,729
Now she's a mean old thing

823
00:59:23,801 --> 00:59:26,133
So spread sunshine

824
00:59:26,204 --> 00:59:29,037
All over the place

825
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,133
Put on a happy

826
01:00:45,116 --> 01:00:48,210
So put on a happy

827
01:00:48,286 --> 01:00:53,019
Face

828
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:14,100
Well, like l said,
you're a genius, Dr. Peterson.

829
01:01:14,178 --> 01:01:16,442
Oh, honey,
you sure have put up with a Iot.

830
01:01:16,514 --> 01:01:18,448
But this time we're gonna make it!

831
01:01:18,516 --> 01:01:20,711
Let's live in a small town
like this.

832
01:01:20,785 --> 01:01:23,345
- Anything you say, dear.
- Okay?

833
01:01:23,421 --> 01:01:26,185
Wow, the last time
we were alone together--

834
01:01:26,257 --> 01:01:28,623
last summer at Palisades Park.

835
01:01:28,693 --> 01:01:31,856
- We went through the tunnel ot love.
- Your mother sat between us.

836
01:01:31,929 --> 01:01:34,898
Oh, honey, l told you. From now on,
things are gonna be ditferent.

837
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:39,266
- Yoo-hoo! Albert!
- lt's Mama.

838
01:01:39,337 --> 01:01:41,271
Mama?

839
01:01:45,476 --> 01:01:48,445
Boy meets girl,
boy loses girl...

840
01:01:48,512 --> 01:01:50,446
boy gets mother.

841
01:01:55,052 --> 01:01:59,352
- Mama, where have ya been?
- Neglected! That's where l've been.

842
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:02,324
l tried to tind ya.
Have you had any dinner?

843
01:02:02,393 --> 01:02:06,830
A mother doesn't need tood. Besides,
l'd rather be with my famous son.

844
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:09,593
Albert, what is it?
Oh, it's your mother.

845
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:12,192
- Oh, good evening!
- How are ya, ma'am?

846
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:17,105
How can l be-- ripped trom
my native land, alone in this jungle?

847
01:02:17,174 --> 01:02:19,802
Gosh, Albert, l wish we had room
to put up your mother.

848
01:02:19,877 --> 01:02:24,075
Thanks. A motel mattress full of lumps
is good enough tor me.

849
01:02:24,148 --> 01:02:26,582
Comtort is tor my loving son.

850
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,858
l just came to tuck ya into bed.

851
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:37,860
See, Mama's got a condition.
She won't tell me what it is.

852
01:02:37,928 --> 01:02:40,726
Why worry a growing boy?

853
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,926
Okay. You insist?

854
01:02:44,001 --> 01:02:47,664
l got, maybe,
one tenth a normal heart.

855
01:02:47,738 --> 01:02:50,002
A mother doesn't need a heart.

856
01:02:50,074 --> 01:02:52,838
Well, soon as Albert and l get
our new deal a-rollin'...

857
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,378
you'll have the finest doctors
in the country.

858
01:02:55,446 --> 01:02:59,109
Deal? What deal, Albert?

859
01:02:59,183 --> 01:03:04,086
Well, Mama, l'm quitting the music
business and goin' back to chemistry.

860
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:08,091
That Rosie!
She's finally turned you against me!

861
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,218
Oh, please, Mama. She didn't.

862
01:03:10,294 --> 01:03:12,455
Albert, go-- desert me.

863
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,294
But when l was expecting him
in the maternity ward--

864
01:03:15,366 --> 01:03:17,459
three days l waited--
did l desert him?

865
01:03:17,535 --> 01:03:22,336
No. l stayed right there so
he wouldn't be alone when he was born.

866
01:03:22,406 --> 01:03:25,603
Mama, please don't excite yourself.
Mama, you know l love ya.

867
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,440
- lt's just Rosie and l have plans.
- Okay!

868
01:03:28,512 --> 01:03:32,949
Lou, l'll be right up.

869
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,951
Start dealing.

870
01:03:37,154 --> 01:03:41,887
Just bury me on your tront lawn
so Rosie can walk all over me!

871
01:03:44,495 --> 01:03:47,430
Mama! Mama, please!

872
01:03:47,498 --> 01:03:49,693
lt's not gas. lt's electric.

873
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:51,200
Doris!

874
01:03:54,805 --> 01:03:58,536
Doris, how do you like it?
lsn't it exciting?

875
01:03:58,609 --> 01:04:02,340
No! l told you
not to dye your hair!

876
01:04:02,413 --> 01:04:05,041
Oh, but l wanted to!
lsn't it a gas?

877
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:09,511
- You dare dety your mother?
- But it's my hair.

878
01:04:09,587 --> 01:04:12,852
- Not till you're 21.
- What's the matter, Papa?

879
01:04:12,923 --> 01:04:16,120
Young lady, you stay in your room
till it changes back! Do you hear?

880
01:04:16,193 --> 01:04:19,128
- l won't!
- l demand respect around here.

881
01:04:19,196 --> 01:04:21,960
- lt's my hair!
- Respect. Do you hear? Respect.

882
01:04:22,032 --> 01:04:25,934
- l respect you, Papa.
- l don't want your respect.

883
01:04:26,103 --> 01:04:29,630
Who wants respect
trom a ten-year-old kid?

884
01:04:29,707 --> 01:04:33,905
Kids, l don't know what's wrong
with these kids today

885
01:04:33,978 --> 01:04:38,381
Kids, who can understand
anything they say

886
01:04:38,449 --> 01:04:42,476
Kids, they are disobedient
disrespectful oafs

887
01:04:42,553 --> 01:04:45,886
Noisy, crazy, sloppy, lazy loafers

888
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:47,890
And while we're on the sub ject, kids

889
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:51,121
You can talk and talk
till your face is blue

890
01:04:51,195 --> 01:04:55,359
Kids, but they still do
just what they want to do

891
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,663
Why can't they be like we were

892
01:04:57,735 --> 01:04:59,930
Perfect in every way

893
01:05:00,004 --> 01:05:03,201
What's the matter with kids today

894
01:05:04,408 --> 01:05:08,139
Kids, l've tried to raise you
the best l could

895
01:05:08,212 --> 01:05:12,911
Kids, all the things l've done
were for your own good

896
01:05:12,983 --> 01:05:17,317
Kids, can't you once appreciate
how l've sacrificed

897
01:05:17,388 --> 01:05:20,482
Working, slaving, scrimping
saving pennies

898
01:05:20,558 --> 01:05:22,617
And livin' with your father, kids

899
01:05:22,693 --> 01:05:26,060
No one knows the burdens l've had
to bear, and in my condition

900
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:29,190
Kids, l'm a poor, sick woman
and does he care

901
01:05:29,266 --> 01:05:32,463
Ha!
Go on, go on and kill me

902
01:05:32,536 --> 01:05:34,595
That's what it's coming to

903
01:05:34,672 --> 01:05:38,039
When a mother has kids like you

904
01:05:39,343 --> 01:05:42,278
- Kids
- All the chicken soup l made for you

905
01:05:42,346 --> 01:05:44,371
- Mama, take it easy.
- Kids

906
01:05:44,448 --> 01:05:47,906
- Now you throw me out like a worn shoe
- Not in front of everybody.

907
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:52,046
Mom, after all, l haven't been
such an awful son

908
01:05:52,122 --> 01:05:55,523
l never sass you back
or leave a ring around the bathtub

909
01:05:55,593 --> 01:05:57,618
- And don't I always phone you
- Kids

910
01:05:57,695 --> 01:06:00,926
You can give your life to 'em
night and day

911
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,466
- Kids, then they go get married
- Married?

912
01:06:03,534 --> 01:06:05,525
- And go away
- Who's gettin' married?

913
01:06:05,603 --> 01:06:07,730
Why do we have these children

914
01:06:07,805 --> 01:06:11,241
Better to have a pet
You know where you stand with a pet.

915
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:16,006
l never asked for nothin'

916
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,014
Nothin' is what you'll get

917
01:06:18,082 --> 01:06:21,108
What's the matter with kids to--

918
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,153
I tried, Lou, but l failed.

919
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,120
Oh, ya didn't, Mama.
Ya didn't.

920
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:28,090
Don't try to pay me back, sonny.
I forgive you.

921
01:06:28,158 --> 01:06:30,991
So what if you're an ingrate?
So long as you're happy.

922
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:32,995
- l don't want to be happy.
- Don't feel guilty.

923
01:06:33,063 --> 01:06:36,931
Just make believe l'm an old used car.
Junk me. Leave me in the gutter.

924
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:39,333
- l'll never leave ya. Never.
- You heard him.

925
01:06:39,403 --> 01:06:41,234
- You're a witness.
- l promise, Mama.

926
01:06:41,305 --> 01:06:44,069
- l never broke promise to my mama.
- Good boy.

927
01:06:44,141 --> 01:06:46,200
Why can't they be like Albert

928
01:06:46,277 --> 01:06:48,211
Perfect in every way

929
01:06:48,279 --> 01:06:50,679
What's the matter with kids

930
01:06:50,748 --> 01:06:52,716
Yeah, what's the matter with kids

931
01:06:52,783 --> 01:06:56,776
Nothing's the matter with kids today

932
01:06:59,356 --> 01:07:02,223
Mr. Paisley, this is Rose DeLeon.

933
01:07:02,293 --> 01:07:04,784
You asked me to call
it l had any tree time.

934
01:07:04,862 --> 01:07:07,194
Well, l'm free.

935
01:07:07,264 --> 01:07:09,596
- Very tree.
- Rosie!

936
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:13,398
Ten minutes?
l'll be waiting tor you.

937
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,234
Don't worry, sonny.
You can always get another secretary.

938
01:07:27,151 --> 01:07:28,778
Can you see him?

939
01:07:28,852 --> 01:07:31,946
- No. Babette, can you see him?
- l can't see him.

940
01:07:32,022 --> 01:07:35,719
All l can see is the basketball hoop.
Hey, Gretch, can you see him?

941
01:07:35,793 --> 01:07:38,591
Conrad Birdie in our gym!

942
01:07:38,662 --> 01:07:42,996
Oh, oh, oh, give me one last kiss

943
01:07:43,067 --> 01:07:45,729
One last kiss

944
01:07:45,803 --> 01:07:49,569
Oh, one more time
Mmm, baby, one more time

945
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,804
lt really is sublime
Ah, baby, so sublime

946
01:07:53,877 --> 01:07:56,141
You know l need your love

947
01:07:56,213 --> 01:08:00,172
Oh, oh, oh, give me one last kiss

948
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:03,549
One last kiss

949
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:07,113
Baby

950
01:08:07,191 --> 01:08:11,355
Give me one last kiss

951
01:08:11,428 --> 01:08:16,195
Baby

952
01:08:16,266 --> 01:08:19,861
Give me one last kiss

953
01:08:19,937 --> 01:08:25,341
Oh, one last kiss

954
01:08:25,409 --> 01:08:27,536
Give me one last kiss

955
01:08:27,611 --> 01:08:29,545
lt never felt like this

956
01:08:29,613 --> 01:08:31,911
Nah, baby, not like this

957
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:34,041
You know l need your love

958
01:08:34,118 --> 01:08:36,814
- Oh, oh, oh
- Okay. Cut.

959
01:08:36,887 --> 01:08:39,549
We'll rehearse
the song later, Conrad.

960
01:08:39,623 --> 01:08:44,526
- Al, what's the exact length?
- Oh, uh, 1:20.

961
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:48,122
Check. That gives us 2:40
for Sullivan's intro to Kim...

962
01:08:48,198 --> 01:08:50,132
Kim's good luck speech to Conrad.

963
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,532
Then Conrad socks over a plug
tor army enlistments...

964
01:08:52,603 --> 01:08:55,970
bangs into the song, and we top it off
with the big kisseroo.

965
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,668
- Kim?
- Yes, sir.

966
01:09:00,444 --> 01:09:03,174
Beg pardon,
but when do l make my speech?

967
01:09:03,247 --> 01:09:05,181
Speech? What speech?

968
01:09:05,249 --> 01:09:08,946
l promised Mr. McAfee he could say a few
words. After all, he's Kim's father.

969
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:12,455
- Yes, he is.
- Kind of a helIo from a proud parent.

970
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,457
All right,
but ya can't have much time.

971
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:17,187
ln tact, all you can have is 20 seconds
on the nose.

972
01:09:17,261 --> 01:09:20,458
Gotcha. l'll just say a few words,
get some big laughs.

973
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:23,261
- And introduce the mayor.
- The mayor?

974
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:27,827
- Ah, come on, Al. What is this?
- l-- We had a problem.

975
01:09:27,905 --> 01:09:30,738
l had to give the mayor a spot
to humor McAfee.

976
01:09:30,808 --> 01:09:34,869
All right, but we'll have to take
ten seconds away from McAtee.

977
01:09:34,945 --> 01:09:37,277
l imagine songwriting must be
quite a lucrative profession.

978
01:09:37,347 --> 01:09:41,283
- Oh, yes it is.
- How many records will they sell?

979
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:43,410
Oh, about one or two million.

980
01:09:43,487 --> 01:09:46,513
You know, Claude, l had a pertectly
wondertul time last night.

981
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:49,024
- You really are a wonderful dancer.
- Oh, l don't know.

982
01:09:49,093 --> 01:09:51,618
When one's heart sings,
one's feet take wings.

983
01:09:51,695 --> 01:09:54,027
Oh, how lyrical.
ls that Shelley or Keats?

984
01:09:54,098 --> 01:09:56,430
- That, my dear, is Paisley.
- Really?

985
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,525
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

986
01:09:59,603 --> 01:10:01,537
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

987
01:10:05,342 --> 01:10:07,537
Okay, everybody. Take your places.

988
01:10:07,611 --> 01:10:09,943
Now come on, Kim.
Just move right over there.

989
01:10:10,013 --> 01:10:12,311
Just read it like
you normally would. Okay.

990
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:16,045
And we, your admirers, are proud that
our military Ieaders have called upon--

991
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,054
- Conrad, honey!
- Please, Mrs. Peterson.

992
01:10:18,122 --> 01:10:20,056
We're rehearsing.

993
01:10:20,124 --> 01:10:22,490
All right now, Kim.

994
01:10:22,559 --> 01:10:24,993
CouId you move over one, please?

995
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,963
Kim, you're talking too fast.
Now once more, dear, but slower.

996
01:10:31,335 --> 01:10:34,361
- To express to you--
- TelI me, Mrs. Peterson.

997
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:37,498
- What does your husband do?
- l don't know. He's dead.

998
01:10:38,575 --> 01:10:42,136
And, and, and l want to say...

999
01:10:42,212 --> 01:10:47,582
on behalt of all the girls
who are your devoted admirers--

1000
01:10:47,651 --> 01:10:50,620
- Oh, l torgot what's next.
- Come on, man. Let's go.

1001
01:10:50,687 --> 01:10:53,247
- Hi, Hugo.
- They don't want all this jazz.

1002
01:10:53,323 --> 01:10:54,915
- Yeah.
- They want Conrad.

1003
01:10:54,992 --> 01:10:58,655
Look. There's the camera.
l bail in, l sing up a storm...

1004
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:01,027
l give this chick the message--

1005
01:11:04,401 --> 01:11:05,834
This is my best side.

1006
01:11:05,903 --> 01:11:07,302
- Applause.
- She's tainted.

1007
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:10,363
- l'll dig you later.
- Hey, enough! l'm puttin' my foot down!

1008
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,670
My baby!

1009
01:11:12,743 --> 01:11:14,870
Now l'm puttin' my foot down.
She's not goin' on that show!

1010
01:11:14,945 --> 01:11:17,914
Oh, yes, she is.
You're not wreckin' my career.

1011
01:11:17,981 --> 01:11:20,279
- Oh, what happened?
- Tell him you're through...

1012
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:23,979
because you do not wish to humiliate
your steady in this sordid fashion.

1013
01:11:24,054 --> 01:11:26,420
Hugo Peabody, you take that back!

1014
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,651
l will not,
but l will take my pin back.

1015
01:11:28,725 --> 01:11:31,159
Oh, with pleasure.

1016
01:11:39,703 --> 01:11:42,763
Conrad, l know you're tense,
but we haven't tinished.

1017
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,400
- The number's not ready.
- Conrad's a trooper, like l was.

1018
01:11:45,475 --> 01:11:48,273
- Us troopers get tense.
- Yeah. Like she said, like.

1019
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:51,508
Conrad, why don't you and l
go tor a nice ride in the country?

1020
01:11:51,582 --> 01:11:55,348
Uh-uh. Man, l hope
l never get that tense.

1021
01:11:58,655 --> 01:12:01,021
l never should have said that
to Rosie.

1022
01:12:01,091 --> 01:12:04,618
-Who does he think he is anyway?
-Al, l got a wire here trom Ed Sullivan.

1023
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:07,892
''Russian Ballet switching to different
dance requiring additional four minutes.

1024
01:12:07,965 --> 01:12:11,457
Therefore, the entire Birdie spot
must be cut to less than 30 seconds.''

1025
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:13,469
- Cut?
- ''Tell Peterson and Rosie...

1026
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:16,506
l'm sorry song is out,
but no choice.''

1027
01:12:16,573 --> 01:12:19,098
No. They can't do this.
They can't cut the song.

1028
01:12:19,176 --> 01:12:23,112
They've already done it, kid. ln 30
seconds all Birdie can do is take a bow.

1029
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,114
l'm awtully sorry.

1030
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:28,315
The Russians!

1031
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:32,048
First they take Czechoslovakia,
and now they take my tour minutes.

1032
01:12:32,122 --> 01:12:34,420
- Oh, Mama.
- Oh, baby!

1033
01:12:35,993 --> 01:12:39,292
Well, that's, that's show business.

1034
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:10,624
There are chicks just ripe
for some kissin'

1035
01:13:10,694 --> 01:13:14,994
And l mean to kiss me a few

1036
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:19,502
Man, those chicks don't know

Sizzlin' steaks

And there's Cadillacs

1040
01:13:32,416 --> 01:13:37,149
Gotta move

01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:41,122
l got a lot of livin' to do

1042
01:13:41,191 --> 01:13:43,989
There's music to play
places to go

01:13:44,061 --> 01:13:46,120
People to see

1044
01:13:46,196 --> 01:13:50,098
Everything for you and me

1045
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:54,399
Life's a ball

And it's all
just waitin' for you

1047
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:03,039
You're alive

01:14:03,113 --> 01:14:07,072
Yeah, we got a lot of livin' to do

1049
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:10,176
There are men

1050
01:14:10,253 --> 01:14:14,314
With childhood behind them

1051
01:14:14,391 --> 01:14:17,417
Handsome men

1052
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:21,521
From Yale or Purdue

1053
01:14:21,598 --> 01:14:24,726
Older men

1054
01:14:24,801 --> 01:14:28,396
And l'm gonna find 'em

1055
01:14:29,473 --> 01:14:33,136

1056
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:36,043
To do

1057
01:14:36,113 --> 01:14:39,310
l'm a-gonna have fun

1058
01:14:39,383 --> 01:14:41,317
Gonna be wild

1059
01:14:41,385 --> 01:14:44,320
Have my own way

1060
01:14:44,388 --> 01:14:47,551
l may break

1061
01:14:47,624 --> 01:14:51,321
A heart a day

1062
01:14:51,395 --> 01:14:54,728
Drink champagne

1063
01:14:54,798 --> 01:14:57,892
As if it were water

1064
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:02,234
Pink champagne

1065
01:15:02,305 --> 01:15:05,240
And after a few

1066
01:15:06,309 --> 01:15:09,836
Daddy dear

1067
01:15:09,913 --> 01:15:13,041
You won't know your daughter

1068
01:15:14,618 --> 01:15:18,418
She's got a lot of livin'

1069
01:15:18,488 --> 01:15:20,080
To do

1070
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:27,062
Think l'll be

1071
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:29,257
A ring-a-ding drummer

1072
01:15:29,332 --> 01:15:31,323
Make each week

1073
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:33,801
A thousand or two

1074
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,804
Gorgeous girls

1075
01:15:35,872 --> 01:15:37,931
Will beg for my number

1076
01:15:38,008 --> 01:15:42,411
Hey, l've got a lot of livin' to do

1077
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:45,243
Yes, I'm gonna break out
Gonna take off

1078
01:15:45,315 --> 01:15:47,442
Gonna be free

1079
01:15:47,517 --> 01:15:51,044
This town is awfully square
for a cat like me

1080
01:15:51,121 --> 01:15:53,385
Or l'll be

1081
01:15:53,457 --> 01:15:55,755
A super jet pilot

1082
01:15:55,826 --> 01:15:57,760
Fly me high

1083
01:15:57,828 --> 01:15:59,955
Way out in the blue

1084
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:02,123
And then they'll see

1085
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:04,633
l'm no shrinkin' violet

1086
01:16:04,701 --> 01:16:08,000
Hey, l've got a lot of livin' to do

1087
01:18:39,823 --> 01:18:44,021
l got a lot of livin'

1088
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:46,028
To do

1089
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:09,710
- There's music to play
- Places to go

1090
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:11,720
People to see

1091
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:15,986
Ah, everything for you and me

1092
01:19:16,059 --> 01:19:18,050
Life's a ball

1093
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:20,392
lf only you know it

1094
01:19:20,463 --> 01:19:24,832
Yeah, and it's all
just waitin' for you

1095
01:19:24,901 --> 01:19:26,926
Oh, you're alive

1096
01:19:27,003 --> 01:19:29,233
So come on and show it

1097
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:32,298
Yeah, we got a lot of livin'

1098
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:34,104
Such a lot of livin'

1099
01:19:34,177 --> 01:19:36,509
Tonight's the night
we're gonna fly

1100
01:19:36,579 --> 01:19:39,104
Let's kick this hick town
into high

1101
01:19:43,286 --> 01:19:45,550
l want a taste of everything

1102
01:19:45,622 --> 01:19:48,318
Let's live it up and really swing

1103
01:19:48,391 --> 01:19:52,384
Got a lot of livin', livin'

1104
01:19:52,462 --> 01:19:54,157
Livin', livin'

1105
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:56,130
Livin' to do

1106
01:19:56,199 --> 01:19:57,632
Live!

1107
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:50,112
But you needn't bite my head otf.
l only ask a civil question.

1108
01:20:50,186 --> 01:20:51,676
Ten times you've asked me.

1109
01:20:51,755 --> 01:20:54,485
l don't know why they've changed
to this slow dance tor the TV.

1110
01:20:54,557 --> 01:20:56,491
But if Albert can't get him
to cut it shorter...

1111
01:20:56,559 --> 01:20:58,493
tomorrow night
l won't be on Ed Sullivan.

1112
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:00,927
Neither will Kim.
You know how much it means to her.

1113
01:21:00,997 --> 01:21:02,624
- How about m--
- Well, anyway...

1114
01:21:02,699 --> 01:21:05,429
Albert's still in with the managers,
so that's a good sign.

1115
01:21:05,502 --> 01:21:08,869
lf Eisenhower couldn't handle
the Russians, how is Albert?

1116
01:21:22,285 --> 01:21:24,219
Long live Joseph Stalin.

1117
01:21:24,287 --> 01:21:26,653
l mean, Stalin lived too long.

1118
01:21:26,723 --> 01:21:28,657
Long live Khrushchev.

1119
01:21:47,644 --> 01:21:49,578
Save your lite? Me?

1120
01:21:49,646 --> 01:21:52,274
My triend,
it you are sick, see a doctor.

1121
01:21:53,216 --> 01:21:57,084
lf you're sick, see a doctor.
You speak English?

1122
01:21:57,153 --> 01:21:59,883
lt saves time.

1123
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:03,983
What can l do tor you,
uh, Mr. Peterson?

1124
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:07,518
Sir, l have come to appeal to you.

1125
01:22:07,597 --> 01:22:10,157
That ballet-- the one
that you're doing on TV tomorrow night--

1126
01:22:10,233 --> 01:22:12,428
Da, for Mr. Ed Sullivan.

1127
01:22:12,502 --> 01:22:16,836
Yeah. That's the one.
Could you just cut that four minutes?

1128
01:22:16,906 --> 01:22:21,707
Well, it's beautiful. l love it,
but my life depends on it.

1129
01:22:21,778 --> 01:22:24,246
Desecrate this classic?

1130
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:27,147
l need the time
for Conrad Birdie to sing my song.

1131
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:31,882
Who sent you here?
Senator Goldwater?

1132
01:22:31,955 --> 01:22:34,981
Will you cut three minutes?

1133
01:22:35,058 --> 01:22:37,185
Two minutes?

1134
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,887
A minute and a halt.

1135
01:22:38,962 --> 01:22:43,058
To cut even ten seconds
would be artistic sabotage.

1136
01:22:43,132 --> 01:22:45,862
This ballet
has historic significance.

1137
01:22:45,935 --> 01:22:49,029
lt was performed the same day
as the tuneral of the czar.

1138
01:22:49,105 --> 01:22:51,972
Lenin himself made the arrangement.

1139
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:55,272
- Lenin arranged music?
- No! Funerals!

1140
01:23:01,951 --> 01:23:06,012
- Hello, Rose.
- Oh, hi, Kim. You still up?

1141
01:23:06,089 --> 01:23:09,081
Oh, l'm so miserable, Rose.

1142
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:12,685
l've lost Hugo, and now l'm not even
going to be on TV.

1143
01:23:13,763 --> 01:23:15,458
Why not?

1144
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:19,992
The ballet's taking tour extra minutes,
so Birdie's song and the kiss are out.

1145
01:23:20,069 --> 01:23:23,266
Oh, serves Albert right.

1146
01:23:23,339 --> 01:23:25,830
Oh, now come on. Relax.

1147
01:23:25,909 --> 01:23:27,809
Faithless men like Albert and Hugo--

1148
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:30,505
they're all alike--
trom puberty to stupidity...

1149
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:32,946
from Benedict Arnold to Mussolini.

1150
01:23:33,016 --> 01:23:36,383
Men. We laugh at them, right?

1151
01:23:37,453 --> 01:23:42,083
lt's easy tor you to pick up
the pieces ot your shattered dream.

1152
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:45,059
You've tound a compensation.

1153
01:23:45,128 --> 01:23:49,224
Ah, that Claude Paisley
is just too much.

1154
01:23:51,301 --> 01:23:55,465
He's too much, all right.
But l won't mention of what.

1155
01:23:55,538 --> 01:23:58,371
All that charm-- so genteel...

1156
01:23:58,441 --> 01:24:01,672
so educated, so underhanded!

1157
01:24:04,547 --> 01:24:07,516
You mean Mr. Paisley's like
all the rest?

1158
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,609
l thought he was the marrying type.

1159
01:24:09,686 --> 01:24:11,654
Oh, he is.

1160
01:24:11,721 --> 01:24:13,746
He wanted to elope tonight.

1161
01:24:13,823 --> 01:24:16,690
And you know what?
He'd like to live in New York.

1162
01:24:16,759 --> 01:24:19,125
Uh, not to teach--
to be a songwriter.

1163
01:24:19,195 --> 01:24:20,628
A songwriter?

1164
01:24:21,564 --> 01:24:24,658
He's all the things
l want to get away trom.

1165
01:24:24,734 --> 01:24:26,668
Oh, l'm sorry.

1166
01:24:26,736 --> 01:24:30,297
l never dreamed that Mr. Paisley,
of all men--

1167
01:24:30,373 --> 01:24:34,867
Oh, well. Men.
They're only out to use us, Kim.

1168
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,811
l know. Hugo's used me
since we were treshman.

1169
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,940
All those years l wasted
on Albert.

1170
01:24:41,017 --> 01:24:43,110
Rosie the dependable one,
Rosie the patient one...

1171
01:24:43,186 --> 01:24:45,552
Rosie the good girl.

1172
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:49,490
l know it sounds old-tashioned,
but l'm not ashamed to admit it.

1173
01:24:49,559 --> 01:24:51,754
- l'm still a good girl.
- Rose?

1174
01:24:51,828 --> 01:24:54,797
- Hmm?
- So am l.

1175
01:24:56,366 --> 01:24:58,300
No kidding?

1176
01:24:59,569 --> 01:25:02,538
Well, you won't be sorry.

1177
01:25:06,409 --> 01:25:08,877
- Are you going out so late?
- Mm-hmm.

1178
01:25:08,945 --> 01:25:13,382
My farewell to Sweet Apple-- a night
to remember. l'm going to Maude's Cate.

1179
01:25:13,449 --> 01:25:17,579
Maude's? That's a wild place.

1180
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,179
You're not gonna do anything rash?

1181
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,190
Whatever you hear about me, Kim...

1182
01:25:22,258 --> 01:25:24,954
just tell them that
she loved not wisely, but too well.

1183
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:41,033
This is the place, Albert--
hottest spot in the county.

1184
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:43,772
- How do you know?
- Oh, l heard-- only heard.

1185
01:25:44,847 --> 01:25:47,247
Albert, don't go in that place.

1186
01:25:47,316 --> 01:25:50,911
- l must. lt's the only way.
- But drinking won't solve anything.

1187
01:25:50,987 --> 01:25:53,080
He's frustrated.

1188
01:25:53,156 --> 01:25:58,059
Good-bye. Thanks.

1189
01:25:58,127 --> 01:26:00,595
l'd go in there with ya
it l weren't a happy family man...

1190
01:26:00,663 --> 01:26:02,631
and not allowed to enjoy myself.

1191
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:05,293
Oh, please, Mister, l--
Oh, my arm!

1192
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:07,529
- l just want to--
- l'm telIing you tor the last time!

1193
01:26:07,603 --> 01:26:11,095
- All l want is a drink.
- No drinks! Now get lost!

1194
01:26:11,174 --> 01:26:15,133
Well, just a pint ot bourbon?
Gin? Scotch?

1195
01:26:15,211 --> 01:26:17,270
Well, how about a malted
with a little vodka?

1196
01:26:17,346 --> 01:26:19,780
Come back when you're 21.

1197
01:26:19,849 --> 01:26:24,115
Oh, well, l'm way over 21. l only
look young trom too much drinkin'.

1198
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,485
Oh, look at me.
Look at the shell of a human being--

1199
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,531
the monster you've created.

1200
01:26:35,598 --> 01:26:39,898
Oh, l'm sorry about-- Uh, Hugo,
don't worry. You'll get Kim back.

1201
01:26:39,969 --> 01:26:42,836
No, thanks.
The bloom is oft the rose.

1202
01:26:43,906 --> 01:26:47,672
Rose. Little Rose--

1203
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:50,212
a precious flower
that l trampled on.

1204
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,355
There you go.

1205
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:11,798
A toast to Mae. She's okay.

1206
01:27:11,868 --> 01:27:13,961
l'm a songwriter too, huh?

1207
01:27:14,036 --> 01:27:17,836
Would you caIl the McAfee house again
and see if my Al-- Sonny!

1208
01:27:17,907 --> 01:27:19,898
Mama, what are you doin'
in a place like this?

1209
01:27:19,976 --> 01:27:21,910
We're playin' canasta.
l got lonesome.

1210
01:27:21,978 --> 01:27:24,378
- Did you cut the Russians?
- And why are you consorting with him?

1211
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:26,711
- Glad to meet you.
- Now looks ain't everything.

1212
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:30,219
Besides, Mr. Maude
is 100% gentlemen and a widower.

1213
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:31,981
Three times. Sit down, Albert.

1214
01:27:32,054 --> 01:27:35,182
Any son ot Mae Peterson is a triend
of mine. Come. Sit down. Go on.

1215
01:27:35,258 --> 01:27:38,159
Mama, get your things. We're taking
the bus to New York tonight.

1216
01:27:38,227 --> 01:27:40,855
Your song! lt's all off?

1217
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:43,899
- lt's dead, like l am. Let's go.
- You ain't going, Mae. Say you ain't!

1218
01:27:43,966 --> 01:27:47,732
- You unhand her. Come on, Mama.
- Okay, buster. Set 'em up!

1219
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:51,240
Double scotch and gin on the side
and, uh, a bourbon chaser.

1220
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:55,676
Make that a triple chaser,
and bring on the dancing boys!

1221
01:27:55,745 --> 01:27:58,908
Well, come on. Make me the drinks,
Meyer. We gotta put out this tire.

1222
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,618
Everything is Rosie

1223
01:28:02,685 --> 01:28:04,243
Cha, cha, cha

1224
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,652
- 'Cause my name is Rosie
- Oh, the poor thing.

1225
01:28:06,722 --> 01:28:09,020
- Fifi, huh
- She can't get over me.

1226
01:28:09,091 --> 01:28:12,254
-She's singing the song l wrote tor her.
-You wrote her a song?

1227
01:28:12,328 --> 01:28:15,820
Well, only eight bars, Mama.
Somehow l never could tinish it.

1228
01:28:15,898 --> 01:28:19,061
Hey, what's with the red cap?
You got a train inside?

1229
01:28:26,142 --> 01:28:27,575
Where are you goin'?

1230
01:28:27,643 --> 01:28:30,510
l'm gonna go down and see what
the boys in the back room will have.

1231
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:32,571
Albert, where are you going?

1232
01:28:32,648 --> 01:28:37,278
To save her trom herselt-- to save her
for me. She might get in troubIe.

1233
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:41,847
Report on the charity bazaar we ran
for the benetit ot the old tolk home--

to wit net cash receipts, $840.06.

1235
01:28:48,798 --> 01:28:52,825

01:28:52,902 --> 01:28:55,370

1237

01:28:58,441 --> 01:29:01,103
one ton of fertilizer--

1239
01:29:14,824 --> 01:29:17,384
And now,
betore the recording secretary...

1240
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:20,054
reads the minutes
trom last week's meeting...

1241
01:29:20,129 --> 01:29:22,063
l wish to bring up a subject...

1242
01:29:22,131 --> 01:29:25,123
that l know is on everybody's mind...

1243
01:29:26,202 --> 01:29:27,567
tonight.

1244
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:32,400
As l was saying, gentlemen--

1245
01:31:03,099 --> 01:31:04,532
Yeah!

1246
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:38,132
Yeah!

1247
01:32:33,856 --> 01:32:35,949
No. Listen, fellas--
Watch out!

1248
01:33:35,551 --> 01:33:37,485
Rosie, baby.

1249
01:33:43,893 --> 01:33:45,827
Good morning, darling.

1250
01:33:45,895 --> 01:33:48,591
Way past noon. Sleep okay, honey?

1251
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:51,861
Mm-hmm. l tried not to.

1252
01:33:51,934 --> 01:33:54,562
l wanted to keep reliving
that wonderful moment...

1253
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:59,005
when my shining knight...

1254
01:33:59,074 --> 01:34:01,702
rushed into the sultan's cave...

1255
01:34:01,777 --> 01:34:03,711
and carried me oft.

1256
01:34:05,481 --> 01:34:07,711
Oh, that's just the beginning.

1257
01:34:07,783 --> 01:34:11,310
Pack. We're takin' the bus
to Niagara Falls.

1258
01:34:11,387 --> 01:34:13,321
Oh, yes, dear.

1259
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:25,023
You never saw me
in pajamas betore.

1260
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:26,533
You disappointed?

1261
01:34:26,602 --> 01:34:28,536
Mm-mm.

1262
01:34:31,974 --> 01:34:33,908
Are you?

1263
01:34:43,953 --> 01:34:47,480
Let's take a plane to Niagara Falls--
a jet!

1264
01:34:52,194 --> 01:34:56,096
Albert, we came here
to get your mother set tinancially...

1265
01:34:56,165 --> 01:34:58,895
and our marriage
wouldn't have a chance...

1266
01:34:58,968 --> 01:35:01,493
if we started off feeIing guilty
about deserting her.

1267
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:05,404
That's right. lt may be a long time
betore l make any money.

1268
01:35:05,474 --> 01:35:07,567
Not if Birdie sang
your song tonight.

1269
01:35:07,643 --> 01:35:09,941
No chance. l pleaded.

1270
01:35:10,012 --> 01:35:12,947
They won't shorten the ballet--
not even ten seconds.

1271
01:35:13,015 --> 01:35:16,109
lt's the slowest dance I ever saw.
They move like turtles.

1272
01:35:20,723 --> 01:35:23,283
- What?
- Randolph!

1273
01:35:28,998 --> 01:35:30,966
Boys, those are really showstoppers.

1274
01:35:31,033 --> 01:35:34,059
Frank, Dean and Sammy,
come on out here and take a bow.

1275
01:35:36,839 --> 01:35:41,469
Frank, Dean and Sammy McWilliams.
Thank you, boys.

1276
01:35:41,543 --> 01:35:45,445
Right now, here on our stage,
the magnificent orchestra...

1277
01:35:45,514 --> 01:35:48,677
of American composer-conductor
Ray Block.

1278
01:35:48,751 --> 01:35:50,514
Now, really. Let's hear it.

1279
01:35:50,586 --> 01:35:52,520
Well, that ought to do it.
Any questions?

1280
01:35:52,588 --> 01:35:54,954
- No, sir. Not at all.
- Okay. l'm going backstage.

1281
01:35:55,024 --> 01:35:56,457
Right.

1282
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:02,923
Don't know why l let that Albert
drag us here.

1283
01:36:02,998 --> 01:36:05,193
Rosie said she might have
a big surprise for us.

1284
01:36:05,267 --> 01:36:08,759
Maybe they'll show us sitting here
on TV. l bet that's it.

1285
01:36:08,837 --> 01:36:13,399
- Where did you get all that money?
- l sold Mr. Peterson my chemical set.

1286
01:36:15,711 --> 01:36:20,080
- Two minutes, maestro.
- Borov will be there.

1287
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:23,710
Have never been late
for performance in whole career.

1288
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:28,848
- You say you from magazine?
- Uh, yes. American Ballet magazine.

1289
01:36:28,924 --> 01:36:32,883
We want a picture of the world's
greatest conductor, Maestro Borov.

1290
01:36:32,961 --> 01:36:37,193
You flatter me.
So, shoot me quick.

1291
01:36:37,266 --> 01:36:40,030
Uh, drinking this milk.

1292
01:36:40,102 --> 01:36:42,297
- Milk?
- Yes.

1293
01:36:42,371 --> 01:36:45,101
We drink vodka, little tlower.

1294
01:36:45,174 --> 01:36:48,940
Oh, well, no, thank you.
Please, maestro. This milk.

1295
01:36:49,011 --> 01:36:52,071
You see, our president
has asked us to drink more milk...

1296
01:36:52,147 --> 01:36:54,047
and it would be
a goodwill gesture.

1297
01:36:54,116 --> 01:36:55,549
- President?
- Yes.

1298
01:36:55,617 --> 01:36:58,450
Oh, won't you, please, maestro...

1299
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,454
to improve our relations?

1300
01:37:01,523 --> 01:37:04,014
You are pretty enough
to be un-American.

1301
01:37:06,328 --> 01:37:09,855
All right. Here we go.
Drink up. That's it.

1302
01:37:10,966 --> 01:37:15,130
Now keep drinking until l frame you--
Uh, frame you pertectly. All right.

1303
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:17,570
Bottoms up. That's it.

1304
01:37:22,511 --> 01:37:23,876
Very good.

1305
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:28,081
You've got it. l mean, gotcha!

1306
01:37:30,519 --> 01:37:32,919
See you atter, could be?

1307
01:37:32,988 --> 01:37:36,446
- l'll catch up with ya.
- And for you l do not go too fast.

1308
01:37:37,559 --> 01:37:38,992
We shall see.

1309
01:37:40,062 --> 01:37:42,257
Good-bye. Thank you.

1310
01:37:53,542 --> 01:37:55,772
Mission accomplished.

1311
01:37:55,844 --> 01:37:57,334
- He drank it?
- Yeah.

1312
01:37:57,413 --> 01:37:59,347
My formula works on chickens
and Randolph's turtle...

1313
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:00,848
but l don't know about humans.

1314
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:03,009
Well, it it doesn't,
we're no worse otf...

1315
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:05,349
but if it does, this will be
the shortest ballet in history.

1316
01:38:05,421 --> 01:38:07,753
And now, ready America and Canada?

1317
01:38:07,823 --> 01:38:10,792
Because here we go out
to Columbus, Ohio...

1318
01:38:10,859 --> 01:38:14,022
where the Moscow Ballet dances
''The Rose Adagio''...

1319
01:38:14,096 --> 01:38:16,087
from Tchaikovsky's
Sleeping Beauty...

1320
01:38:16,165 --> 01:38:18,929
conducted by Maestro Borov.

1321
01:38:19,001 --> 01:38:22,266
Take it away, CBS Columbus, Ohio.

1322
01:38:22,337 --> 01:38:24,271
We're on. Up on one.

1323
01:38:32,848 --> 01:38:34,475
Lights.

1324
01:39:41,483 --> 01:39:44,452
Camera two, can you move to your right
just a couple of teet?

1325
01:40:15,284 --> 01:40:17,445
Magniticent.

1326
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:41,342
lt's not gonna work.

1327
01:41:26,421 --> 01:41:29,151
This is crazy. That's not the way
it was rehearsed.

1328
01:41:31,126 --> 01:41:33,617
What is it, sabotage?

1329
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:34,953
We'll have to fill some time.
Put the Birdie song back in.

1330
01:42:35,023 --> 01:42:36,456
Gotcha, Ed.

1331
01:42:36,525 --> 01:42:38,550
Take over.
Be prepared tor the Birdie spot.

1332
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:49,466
Albert, ''One Last Kiss'' is back in.
Find Conrad. Rosie, get Kim.

1333
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:52,473
-Right.
-Put the Birdie spot on stage. Let's go!

1334
01:43:03,819 --> 01:43:06,379
McAtee, hurry up! Come on.
Let's go. The song is back in !

1335
01:43:06,455 --> 01:43:09,618
- A miracle happened! Let's go!
- What? Come on!

1336
01:43:33,515 --> 01:43:35,779
Are you crazy, Borov?

1337
01:44:01,009 --> 01:44:04,069
l've never seen such speedin' dancers.
Thank you, Moscow Ballet...

1338
01:44:04,146 --> 01:44:06,671
for that brilliant
and unexpected bit of burlesque.

1339
01:44:06,748 --> 01:44:08,511
And now, another great treat--

1340

1352
01:45:27,329 --> 01:45:31,163
Oh, one last kiss

1353
01:45:31,233 --> 01:45:33,360
Give me one last kiss

1354
01:45:33,435 --> 01:45:35,369
lt never felt like this

1355
01:45:35,437 --> 01:45:37,905
Nah, baby, not like this

1356
01:45:37,973 --> 01:45:40,203
You know I need your love

1357
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:44,638
Give me one last kiss

1358
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:47,181
One last kiss

1359
01:45:47,249 --> 01:45:49,046
Oh, one more time

1360
01:45:49,117 --> 01:45:51,244
Mmm, baby, one more time

1361
01:45:51,319 --> 01:45:53,253
lt really is sublime

1362
01:45:53,321 --> 01:45:55,789
Ah, honey, so sublime

1363
01:45:55,857 --> 01:45:58,052

1365
01:46:02,464 --> 01:46:04,989
One last kiss

Give me one la--

1370
01:46:30,058 --> 01:46:33,289
Yoo-hoo! Albert!

1371
01:46:36,464 --> 01:46:39,831
l saw it all on TV.
''One Last Kiss'' was a disaster.

1372
01:46:39,901 --> 01:46:42,062
Who wants to buy a record
of a guy with a glass jaw?

1373
01:46:42,137 --> 01:46:44,867
Now will you take Mama's advice
and get out of show business?

1374
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:48,967
l am! My song may be dead, but
my chemical formula works-- on people.

1375
01:46:49,044 --> 01:46:51,512
Shh. The Russians
may have this place bugged.

1376
01:46:51,579 --> 01:46:55,606
lt was Albert's formula that made
the orchestra leader go that tast.

1377
01:46:55,684 --> 01:46:57,447
My genius!

1378
01:46:57,519 --> 01:47:00,647
You gotta work on my cleaning woman.
She gets a dollar an hour.

1379
01:47:00,722 --> 01:47:03,156
Yeah. Mama--

1380
01:47:06,127 --> 01:47:08,561
Rosie and l are going
to Niagara Falls.

1381
01:47:10,098 --> 01:47:11,861
Well...

1382
01:47:13,969 --> 01:47:16,529
it's about time.

1383
01:47:20,308 --> 01:47:23,675
Oh, Mae!
You have to come with us!

1384
01:47:23,745 --> 01:47:27,044
No. l'm one mother
doesn't mix in. Maude!

1385
01:47:27,115 --> 01:47:29,049
Don't tall in the pit, Maude.

1386
01:47:31,086 --> 01:47:32,348
- Albert?
- Yes.

1387
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:34,650
l would like to do things proper.

1388
01:47:34,723 --> 01:47:37,658
So l would like the honor
of becoming your steptather.

1389
01:47:39,127 --> 01:47:40,992
ls it all right, Albert?

1390
01:47:41,896 --> 01:47:43,921
Mama, with my blessing!

1391
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:47,560
-l'm glad because we just got married.
-Yes.

1392
01:47:49,804 --> 01:47:54,138

1393
01:47:54,209 --> 01:47:56,234

- Thank you very much.

1394
01:47:56,311 --> 01:47:59,803
Let's go, Maudie!
We're leavin' for Akron.

1395
01:47:59,881 --> 01:48:02,611
Hubby has to open a new bar and he wants
me to throw out the first beer can.

1396
01:48:02,684 --> 01:48:06,450
- Yeah ! Good-bye, son!
- The falls are wet. Take your rubbers!

1397
01:48:06,521 --> 01:48:08,682
- Bye!
- Yes, Mrs. Maude.

1398
01:48:08,757 --> 01:48:10,748
How about that?
Maude and Mrs. Peterson.

1399
01:48:10,825 --> 01:48:13,055
- Oh, ready here, Albert.
- Be right with you.

1400
01:48:13,128 --> 01:48:15,392
No hurry, partner.

1401
01:48:15,463 --> 01:48:17,397
l promise you one thing, snookums.

1402
01:48:17,465 --> 01:48:19,729
No matter how many millions l make
sellin' ''Speed Up''...

1403
01:48:19,801 --> 01:48:23,066
l'll still be the same,
humble, lovable guy.

1404
01:48:23,138 --> 01:48:26,073
And it any ot those hicks try
to push me around, l'll break 'em.

1405
01:48:30,311 --> 01:48:33,838
Everything is Rosie

1406
01:48:33,915 --> 01:48:36,748
Since l found my Rosie

1407
01:48:36,818 --> 01:48:38,251
Same old words.

1408
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:41,948
With a girl like Rosie

1409
01:48:42,023 --> 01:48:44,218
How could l be blue

1410
01:48:44,292 --> 01:48:46,055
Same eight bars. Now what?

1411
01:48:46,127 --> 01:48:49,824
Hand in hand, we'll mosey

1412
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:53,459
Me and little Rosie

1413
01:48:53,535 --> 01:48:56,003
We will be so cozy

1414
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:59,199
By a fire built for two

1415
01:48:59,274 --> 01:49:01,640
Oh, AIbert, you're too much.

1416
01:49:01,709 --> 01:49:05,702
Oh, l once heard a poem that goes

1417
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:09,409
A rose is a rose is a rose

1418
01:49:09,484 --> 01:49:11,418
But l don't agree

1419
01:49:11,486 --> 01:49:13,420
Take it from me

1420
01:49:13,488 --> 01:49:17,083
There's one rose sweeter
than any that grows

1421
01:49:17,158 --> 01:49:19,991
And that's my Rosie

1422
01:49:20,061 --> 01:49:23,963
l'm so glad she chose me

1423
01:49:24,032 --> 01:49:26,830
Life is one sweet

1424
01:49:26,901 --> 01:49:29,768
Beautiful song to me

1425
01:49:29,838 --> 01:49:33,672
Everything is Hugo

1426
01:49:33,741 --> 01:49:37,472
l will go where you'll go

1427
01:49:37,545 --> 01:49:41,504
With a boy like Hugo

1428
01:49:41,583 --> 01:49:44,780
How could l be blue

1429
01:49:44,853 --> 01:49:49,381
We will be so cozy

1430
01:49:49,457 --> 01:49:53,518
Just like Al and Rosie

1431
01:49:53,595 --> 01:49:56,086
But we're gonna mosey

1432
01:49:56,164 --> 01:49:59,429
ln a hot rod built for two

1433
01:50:01,736 --> 01:50:05,297
- And that's my Rosie
- Gee, how delighted we'll be

1434
01:50:05,373 --> 01:50:09,469
- l'm so glad she chose me
- When you are cozy with me

1435
01:50:09,544 --> 01:50:13,708
Life is one sweet beautiful song

1436
01:50:13,781 --> 01:50:17,945
When love is right
then what could be wrong

1437
01:50:18,019 --> 01:50:20,385
Life is one sweet

1438
01:50:20,455 --> 01:50:24,892
Beautiful song to me

1439
01:50:28,897 --> 01:50:30,888
Bye, bye

1440
01:50:30,965 --> 01:50:33,433
Birdie

1441
01:50:33,501 --> 01:50:37,198
The army's got you now

1442
01:50:37,272 --> 01:50:39,297
l'll try

1443
01:50:39,374 --> 01:50:41,706
Birdie

1444
01:50:41,776 --> 01:50:45,337
To forget somehow

1445
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:49,572
No more

1446
01:50:49,651 --> 01:50:52,017
Sighing

1447
01:50:52,086 --> 01:50:55,681
Each time you move those lips

1448
01:50:55,757 --> 01:50:57,850
No more

1449
01:50:57,926 --> 01:51:00,360
Dying

1450
01:51:00,428 --> 01:51:03,727
When you twitch those hips

1451
01:51:03,798 --> 01:51:06,028
Your swivel and your sway

1452
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:08,034
Your super-duper class

1453
01:51:08,102 --> 01:51:10,161
There's nothing left to say

1454
01:51:10,238 --> 01:51:13,503
But, Conrad, you're a gas

1455
01:51:14,842 --> 01:51:16,742
Bye, bye

1456
01:51:16,811 --> 01:51:19,211
Birdie

1457
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:23,011
Ta, ta, ol' sweetie pie

1458
01:51:23,084 --> 01:51:25,109
Bye, bye

1459
01:51:25,186 --> 01:51:27,450
Birdie

1460
01:51:27,522 --> 01:51:30,116
Time for me to fly

1461
01:51:31,693 --> 01:51:36,027
Time for me to fly

1462
01:51:36,097 --> 01:51:41,160
Time to say good-bye

1463
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:42,260
Bye, now
