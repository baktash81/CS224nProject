1
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,176
In the beginning, there was nothing.

2
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,267
-Wilderness.
-Worse than wilderness.

3
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:45,980
Endless raw acreage,
the land infested with crocodiles.

4
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,067
-Alligators.
-Alligators, crocodiles....

5
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:53,196
For retirement bungalows,
that's not a selling point.

6
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,574
Mosquitoes that would strip you
to the bones.

7
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,995
-Swampland.
-That was 10c an acre. This was worse.

8
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,374
The name means in Seminole:
"Don't go there."

9
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,084
But we bought it.

10
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,087
Because we knew.
You weren't selling land.

11
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:13,383
I mean, what's land?
A patch of dirt, a tree. Who cares?

12
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,969
Farmers care.

13
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,184
Farmers.

14
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:28,189
Farmers are for TV ads. People
with tractors, amber waves of grain.

15
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,692
They shoot it all in Canada.

16
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,864
I'm talking about certified accountants
with a fixed pension and a nest egg...

17
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,868
...who don't wanna spend
their golden years in slush.

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,787
Dreams are what you sell.
A concept.

19
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,166
You sell sunshine,
you sell orange groves...

20
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,878
...you sell gentle breezes
wafting through the palms.

21
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,964
-There were palm trees?
-In the brochures.

22
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,468
-Stately ones.
-When they came down and saw it?

23
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,765
As long as the dredge stayed ahead
of the buyers, we were in like Flynn.

24
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,476
This was the end of the earth.

25
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,772
This was the land populated
by white people who ate catfish.

26
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,069
Almost overnight,
out of the muck and the mangroves...

27
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,196
...we created this.

28
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,699
Golf courses.

29
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,286
Nature on a leash.

30
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,592
<i>Ahoy. It's that time of year again.</i>

31
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,762
<i>The Delrona Chamber of Commerce</i>
<i>invites you...</i>

32
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:46,768
<i>... to the Buccaneer Days festivities</i>
<i>at the Plantation Island Marina.</i>

33
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,979
<i>Live music,</i>
<i>and plenty of booty for kids.</i>

34
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:55,068
<i>Plans for the treasure hunt can be</i>
<i>attained at the Delrona Beach Mall....</i>

35
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,590
-Sure this place is okay?
-What do you mean?

36
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:22,095
-Black people go in here?
-If they're desperate to pee, they do.

37
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,765
-But your mother's is--
-I need to go before then.

38
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,267
Relax.

39
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,774
Take the register,
I gotta get back to the motel.

40
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,901
-Your husband called.
-Ex.

41
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,570
He needs to see you.

42
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,866
Next time, tell him to take
a long walk off a short pier.

43
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,370
-Smoking or non?
-Could I use your bathroom?

44
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,082
-It's straight back to the right.
-Thank you.

45
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,466
Buzzards.

46
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,968
Excuse me.

47
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,685
Hi, there. You been helped yet?

48
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,064
No, my wife's just using
the facilities.

49
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,574
-You need a room?
-Pardon?

50
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,285
You've been gawking at the motel.

51
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,789
We have a few vacancies,
but it'll fill up soon.

52
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,292
-I was looking the property over.
-The property?

53
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,461
The whole strip, actually.

54
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,465
If you're from the County,
we had our sign moved back.

55
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:47,097
I was just trying to imagine what it
would look like without buildings.

56
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,476
-Kind of mentally undressing it?
-You could say that.

57
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,192
-You work for that Plantation outfit?
-Yes. I'm supervising the expansion--

58
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,570
They don't have enough
of the coast already?

59
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,699
It's just a study,
a what-if kind of thing.

60
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,288
What if I told you my daddy would
never sell to Plantation Estates?

61
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,584
I'll be happy to pass it on.
I'm Jack Meadows.

62
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,671
-You're a developer.
-A landscape architect.

63
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:24,175
I help them decide what they want,
push some dirt around....

64
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:29,681
They wanted my opinion
on the whole shoreline here, actually.

65
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,767
-So how's it look?
-What?

66
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,478
Without anything on it?

67
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,773
It looks terrific.

68
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,071
HQ says that'll be our beachhead.
Then we'll take the rest of it.

69
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,577
The other side has this end locked up
and they're infiltrating Lincoln Beach.

70
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:55,165
-We're not opposing?
-Zoned residential, hostile population.

71
00:06:55,582 --> 00:07:01,087
It's a minefield. Whereas right here
is the soft underbelly of the island.

72
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,176
You make the frontal assault,
I go behind the lines.

73
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:11,097
-Is somebody on the inside?
-Working on it.

74
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,272
Shit.

75
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:47,902
Shock and outrage as Delrona Beach
awoke to a senseless act of vandalism.

76
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:52,574
The <i>Freebooter,</i> the centrepiece
of the Buccaneer Days parade...

77
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,576
...was burnt beyond repair....

78
00:08:54,868 --> 00:09:00,373
This is a disaster. It's always
the lead float in the parade.

79
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:06,504
Same kid set a fire some years back
in a crab shack on Lincoln Beach.

80
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,967
This is so not in the spirit
of the celebration.

81
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,970
Where do you want me to haul it?

82
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,975
Hello!

83
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,186
Hello?

84
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:29,277
-Dr. Lloyd.
-Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Pierce.

85
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,279
You're always welcome.

86
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:36,076
I'm rounding up folks for this
County Commission meeting tonight.

87
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:42,290
-I know it's very short notice, but--
-I'd like to help, but I feel poorly.

88
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,502
Oh, my! Would you look at this.

89
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,384
It's that boy
poor Mrs. Stokes took in.

90
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,096
-He's in trouble again?
-First her girl went wild...

91
00:09:56,388 --> 00:10:00,392
...and run off to God knows where.
And now this.

92
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,976
Some people.

93
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:06,690
I'm worried about them sneaking
through this public-domain business...

94
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,983
...without us making a showing.

95
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,487
If we can field just
even a dozen residents--

96
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,990
Wasn't it settled
when they took the cemetery?

97
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:21,496
-I'm afraid it won't stop there.
-Now, who's this coming to call?

98
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,089
It seems kind of deserted.

99
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,468
Yeah, well, you know,
most people come on the weekends.

100
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:43,601
-Do I look okay?
-Relax. This is gonna be fine.

101
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,479
You don't know her.

102
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,402
Hi.

103
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,990
Is Mrs. Stokes here?

104
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,499
I have no idea.

105
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,893
Well, well. Desiree.

106
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,897
Never thought I'd live
to see you back here.

107
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,066
Hello, Mama.

108
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,570
My Lord.

109
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,074
You did get a handsome one,
didn't you?

110
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:47,582
Good luck moving this. It's three
inches of soil, then solid limestone.

111
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:52,587
More work, more pay.
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

112
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,466
-They wanted this one saved.
-Is that right?

113
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,179
What do you think, chief?
That thing gonna make it?

114
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,099
It's part of Mr. Meadows' concept.

115
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:09,604
The chief's concept is everything
that's not flat gets that way, fast.

116
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,691
Plantation sold this lot
with the tree.

117
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,779
When you crackers head back to Georgia,
there better goddamn still be one.

118
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,074
Used to be this was all Exley family.

119
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,202
Hasn't nothing been planted here
in 100 years.

120
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,997
We wanna satisfy the homeowner's
desire for privacy...

121
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,002
...with the convenience
and the socializing opportunities...

122
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,005
...provided by the village concept.

123
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,967
It doesn't look like much now,
but when Jack's finished--

124
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,095
-What goes here?
-Our main drainage basin.

125
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,888
-It's a lake.
-A lake?

126
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,976
It'll be 14 feet deep.
What we dig out will form a hill.

127
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,104
-With a deluxe home on top of it.
-Deluxe?

128
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,983
With all the amenities:
A river view, the lake.

129
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,487
-Elevation.
-Damn! These bugs gonna be here too?

130
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,699
Anaesthesiologist.

131
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:08,204
If there's a surgical procedure,
I render the patient unconscious.

132
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,666
You knock people out with gas?

133
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,002
That's pretty much it.

134
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,673
-I'd be afraid not to wake up.
-A lot of people feel that way.

135
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,178
-Reggie's the head of his department.
-Is that right?

136
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:28,767
And at such a prestigious hospital.
I'll have to tell that to Dr. Lloyd.

137
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:33,980
-Dr. Lloyd still coming down?
-He lives here now.

138
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,776
His Etta Mae passed some years ago.

139
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,196
You wouldn't have heard that,
would you?

140
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,200
-She doesn't write, she doesn't call.
-Mama.

141
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:49,371
Girl caught the first thing smoking
and never looked back.

142
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,166
I took the bus, Mama. Not the train.

143
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,587
It's an expression.

144
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:06,888
Terrell? Go run this gravy through
the microwave again. It's gone cold.

145
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:20,068
-And who is that?
-Your cousin, Sidney Wilkins' son.

146
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,905
Sidney that married Athena Hines.

147
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,283
Well, why isn't he with them?

148
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,580
She doesn't write, she doesn't call.

149
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,292
I'm surprised she even let on
she got married.

150
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:40,672
Her own mother doesn't
get invited to the wedding.

151
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:45,093
It was a civil service, Mama.
It wasn't in church.

152
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:55,270
-But it's legal?
-It's legal, it's official. Don't worry.

153
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,691
Something they do up there.
What is it?

154
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,484
Boston.

155
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:06,281
Somehow, I've never been
north of Washington, D.C.

156
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,784
You'll just have to come visit us.

157
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:18,293
When Terrell's out of school,
maybe we'll do that.

158
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:25,300
How about that, Terrell?
You like to see Boston?

159
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:33,391
The proposed boundary for Delrona
Beach will incorporate this area...

160
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,605
...including Lincoln Beach all the way
to the Exley Plantation track.

161
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,482
Excuse me.

162
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,779
If you want to make a motion, wait
till Commissioner Pinkney's finished.

163
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:49,699
-I want to register a protest.
-In regard to what?

164
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,203
This meeting was not
properly advertised.

165
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,580
We met all legal requirements.

166
00:15:55,789 --> 00:16:00,293
You purposely chose a time when our people
would be unable to attend.

167
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,796
The residents of Lincoln Beach?

168
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:07,008
You know very well many of us
are only here on weekends.

169
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,386
Many are only summer people.

170
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:13,973
That doesn't deny us the right
to object to this expropriation.

171
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:18,478
-Incorporation.
-You've already taken a third of our area.

172
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,272
You know that was
a private transaction...

173
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,068
...between Exley Plantation Estates
Planned Community...

174
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,904
...and the individual property owners.

175
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,992
This commission didn't know about it
until the plans were submitted.

176
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:37,580
If you hadn't already approved it,
they wouldn't have gone ahead.

177
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,502
As spokesman for the Exley Corporation,
I object to the implication--

178
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:47,090
-It has historic significance to us--
-We made several offers to--

179
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:52,095
A history that this commission
has consistently ignored!

180
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,185
You let them take away our cemetery.

181
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:04,983
Dr. Lloyd, we're talking old business.
If you dislike the current agenda--

182
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,570
We don't wanna be a part
of Delrona Beach...

183
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:13,283
...and they've made it clear they
don't want anything to do with us.

184
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,371
If beachfront prices hadn't risen,
there'd be no interest in merging--

185
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:23,668
-The concept of eminent domain--
-Is used to undermine our well-being!

186
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,880
Gentlemen, if we're going
to have a debate...

187
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,885
...I'm going to have to ask you
to follow procedure.

188
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,287
-I'm thinking of going out there again.
-Out where?

189
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,081
Tour.

190
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,792
Golfing?

191
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:09,172
It's kind of a syndicate.
A couple of dentists, a Buick dealer.

192
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,301
They wanna sponsor me
for a percentage of my winnings.

193
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,181
-How much can you make?
-First you have to qualify.

194
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:23,103
Then it just depends on where you
stand at the end of each tournament.

195
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,689
You did this before?

196
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:34,406
I tried a couple of years back.
It was fine till I got on the green.

197
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,282
You know...

198
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,704
...Iittle case of the yips.

199
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,709
It's an adrenaline thing.

200
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:51,297
You're in the middle of the back swing
of your putt, you tighten up and....

201
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,591
Yip.

202
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,095
Something like that.

203
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,099
And you had them bad?

204
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,269
Killer drive,
beautiful approach shot...

205
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,106
...and I just couldn't get
the damn thing in the hole.

206
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:12,277
That would seriously cut
into your winnings, wouldn't it?

207
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:20,994
-It's better now?
-I won't know until I get out there.

208
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,289
I can always sink them in practice.

209
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,083
So you'll be travelling a lot.

210
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,502
That's the life.

211
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,882
Are there, like, groupies?

212
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,386
I suppose. If you win.

213
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,809
I never could understand
wanting to watch it.

214
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,980
You know? It's like
those fishing shows on TV.

215
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,777
Does that make you feel bad?

216
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:58,573
I don't watch people wait on tables
or run the check-in desk.

217
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,992
Right, you don't.

218
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,291
Yip.

219
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,678
-This is too weird.
-Is it what you remember?

220
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:25,100
It's my room, yeah,
but that boy's been living in here.

221
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:31,106
We got some serious testosterone
working here. Now, he's what, exactly?

222
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:34,901
His daddy is my cousin.
Grew up kind of wild.

223
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,986
He's living here because...?

224
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:42,200
She wants me to drive them downtown
for some kind of hearing tomorrow.

225
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,788
-He's in trouble?
-She's not giving up any information.

226
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,581
Punish me a bit.

227
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:52,794
-For being gone so long.
-For everything.

228
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:58,299
She's the one who asked you
to come down, made the first move.

229
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,802
It's too weird.

230
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,098
You can hear the ocean.

231
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,273
I always loved that.

232
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,393
Hey, Lucky.

233
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:09,204
-They changed all the façades.
-Nobody but tourists shop here now.

234
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:14,209
-Where do the regular folks go?
-There's a shuttle bus to the mall.

235
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,087
It's just in here.

236
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:26,805
-This won't take but an hour or so.
-You hope.

237
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,107
Terrell just needs to talk
with somebody.

238
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,610
We'll call you back home
when it's over.

239
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:02,090
Prettiest beach on the Atlantic coast.

240
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,594
It is pretty.

241
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:11,808
If you want to help save it, we're
protesting at the groundbreaking.

242
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:16,396
-I'm just visiting.
-They won't know the difference.

243
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:20,275
So this is like an ecological thing?

244
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:24,779
We're trying to save
an endangered species.

245
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,990
Us.

246
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,577
I heard about this place
when I was a kid.

247
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,204
Forties, fifties...

248
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,374
...Lincoln Beach was it.

249
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,797
Only oceanfront in three counties
we were allowed to step onto.

250
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:47,802
Black folks, I'm talking about
the pillars of the community...

251
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:52,682
...got together and bought this land,
built the houses.

252
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:56,311
You'd drive through a couple hundred
miles of redneck sheriffs...

253
00:23:56,686 --> 00:24:01,399
...park your ride on the boardwalk,
step out and just breathe.

254
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:06,279
Over there was Henry's Lounge.
That place used to jump.

255
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:11,493
-So, what happened?
-Civil rights happened. Progress.

256
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,704
Used to be you were black,
you'd buy black.

257
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:20,585
Jim Crow days, you needed a shoeshine,
wanted a taxi to the train station...

258
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:24,297
...you wanted some ribs,
a fish sandwich...

259
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:28,301
...chances are a black man
owned the place you got it in.

260
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:32,597
Now, the drive-thrus serve anybody.

261
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,599
But who owns them?

262
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,393
Not us.

263
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:42,482
All our people do is wear paper hats
and dip out them fries.

264
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:47,987
Only thing we got left are
funeral parlours and barbershops.

265
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,991
But now we can do anything.

266
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:58,289
Them that can get over do fine.

267
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,795
Them that can't are
in a world of trouble.

268
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,800
Tell the judge what you told me.

269
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:13,096
I said I'm sorry for what I did.
I wasn't thinking right.

270
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:17,308
You know that sorry won't cut it
in this case, don't you?

271
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,893
Yes, ma'am.

272
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:22,397
You're still on probation
for a previous offence...

273
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:26,276
...yet you deliberately
committed this act of vandalism.

274
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,904
Do you have any explanation
for your actions?

275
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,406
No, ma'am.

276
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:36,786
When somebody destroys something
that stands as a symbol for people...

277
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,206
-...that's desecration.
- It's a wooden pirate.

278
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:44,210
An icon in this community, nonetheless.

279
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:51,301
You're almost old enough, given
your record, to be tried as an adult.

280
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:57,599
You have two strikes against you.
A third, and there will be--

281
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:02,979
Mrs. Stokes has assured us she'll
maintain control of the situation.

282
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,483
We'd be satisfied,
barring further incidents...

283
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,613
...with an order for counselling,
or possibly community service.

284
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,908
That's very generous of you.

285
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:21,289
So, young man,
what's it gonna be?

286
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,012
Loretta.

287
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,308
Well....

288
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,687
Look at you.

289
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:48,983
-Mama said you were still in Delrona.
-Haven't moved an inch.

290
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,488
I saw you on a TV commercial.

291
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:58,576
I told my kids I went to school with you,
but they didn't believe me.

292
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,705
-You got kids?
-Three of them.

293
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,207
They're getting big.

294
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:09,004
-It's the first you've been back since--
-I came back for the service...

295
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,673
...when my father passed.

296
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:18,096
-But I only stayed for a day.
-That's a good while ago, your father.

297
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,685
Kind of slow for you down here.

298
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,480
Look, I....

299
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:33,695
-I kind of wanted to apologize.
-For what?

300
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:36,281
For Carter.

301
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:43,913
That's another lifetime
you're talking about. 25 years.

302
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:47,375
We were friends.
I shouldn't have gone after him.

303
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,085
But you did.

304
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:01,598
-You always did what you wanted to.
-I didn't do it to hurt you.

305
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:09,105
-Ancient history.
-So Carter still in town?

306
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:14,778
He inside sleeping.
Works nights at the box factory.

307
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:19,783
-You got married?
-After a while, yeah.

308
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:28,792
-When you left town--
-When I was sent away.

309
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,504
Everybody thought it was Carter
got you pregnant.

310
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,798
It wasn't.

311
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,176
That's what he's saying nowadays.

312
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,180
I guess I wasn't too worried
about the rumours.

313
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:46,685
-Made your exit and didn't look back.
-Some drama, huh?

314
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:51,398
Girl, we ate that shit up.

315
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,901
I had to listen to everybody
run you down...

316
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:59,698
...being the tragic ex-girlfriend and all.

317
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:04,077
-Like that was gonna make me feel better.
-And Carter?

318
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,500
-Carter ran around acting the daddy.
-Really?

319
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:16,381
Better you knock your girl up than to
have people think somebody else did it.

320
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:21,594
But it all turned out fine, didn't it?

321
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:27,392
I suppose I could've done worse.

322
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:32,397
So you're the one who finally
snagged Desiree Stokes?

323
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,399
I'm the one.

324
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:38,778
-That girl drew men like flies.
-I can imagine.

325
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:42,198
-Elton Lloyd.
-Reginald Perry.

326
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,702
We're staying at her mother's
for a few days.

327
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:50,498
A wonderful woman, Eunice.
A true Christian.

328
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:56,379
Now her nephew, is it?

329
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,507
Her nephew's son.

330
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,385
Young Terrell.

331
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:08,475
I blame it on the drugs.
It's a pestilence.

332
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:12,187
Something happened with his...?

333
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:16,274
-Eunice didn't tell you?
-She and Desiree haven't been....

334
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:21,988
-If you ask, you don't deserve to know.
-Seems to be the attitude.

335
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:26,910
Terrell's father was going
through a rough stretch.

336
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:30,288
He had separated from his wife.

337
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:34,876
He came over one day
high on who knows what.

338
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:40,298
They had a screaming argument,
he had a weapon.

339
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:47,013
He shot that woman dead,
then turned the gun on himself.

340
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:51,309
Horrible thing to witness.

341
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:56,189
-Terrell must have been 6, maybe 7.
-He saw it?

342
00:30:56,606 --> 00:31:02,612
He sat with the bodies for two days
before somebody came over and found him.

343
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,990
It's a pestilence.

344
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:12,997
Afternoon, gentlemen.
Y'all know where Buster's Place is?

345
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:18,003
Buster's Place is long gone, brother.
Nothing there now.

346
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,088
You sure?

347
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,091
I know you.

348
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:28,179
-I don't think so.
-Sure, I do.

349
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:31,307
You used to be the Florida Flash.

350
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:41,401
In my day, life was simpler.

351
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:45,196
You knew where you stood.

352
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:50,577
A man was left to make his own way
in the world.

353
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:57,083
You didn't have none of these
pressure groups, advocate groups...

354
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,297
...special-interest groups
handicapping the race.

355
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:08,011
It went to the smartest,
the strongest, the swiftest.

356
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:12,098
If a man could carve out
something for himself...

357
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,477
...he knowed he'd earned it.

358
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,316
No whooping crane.

359
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:24,486
Spotted owl.

360
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:30,116
The Florida gator.

361
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:35,497
The coloured man, the white man,
the Spanish.

362
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:39,501
They all started out from scratch.

363
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:43,505
If you couldn't survive the course,
it was tough titty.

364
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,217
Nowadays, what they got?

365
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:51,304
It ain't natural.

366
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:57,894
They got us so zoned.
Regulated.

367
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:02,816
Politically corrected and
environmentally sensitised...

368
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:08,279
...to the point where it's only
multi-internationals with 12 lawyers...

369
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,283
...waiting like buzzards
for something to litigate...

370
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:16,579
...that can afford to put one brick
on top of another.

371
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:24,087
The little guy, no matter how much
grit or imagination he brings to it...

372
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:30,385
...ain't got a chance. They got him
tied down so he can't hardly breathe.

373
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:38,018
You smoke a damn cigarette, they
make you feel like a baby-strangler.

374
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:43,189
Where's it all gonna end?
I don't want to know.

375
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:50,697
But if they expect my cooperation,
they're just shit out of luck.

376
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:56,703
The reason I hang on to this old bag of
bones is to spite the sons of bitches.

377
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:01,708
They made me put into Social Security
for 50 years.

378
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,714
I ain't giving up the ghost till I spend
every damn penny of it.

379
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,512
-Which one are you?
-Gwendolyn.

380
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:21,186
-You think I'm full of crap, don't you?
-It's time for your insulin, Mr. Temple.

381
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:25,815
There's an opening here
that could close up quick.

382
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:30,278
-My father is the owner.
-I understand he's currently indisposed.

383
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:33,490
He's legally blind, if that's what you mean.

384
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:38,203
The black folks on Lincoln Beach have
contacted the Historical Register.

385
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,996
That's their business.

386
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,793
Draw that kind of attention,
environmentalists come in on their heels.

387
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,087
They're pesky little buggers.

388
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:51,591
Then you won't be able to sell
your property for what it's worth.

389
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,803
-What's it worth?
-Not much at the moment.

390
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:59,808
And since the resort condos have come in,
your taxes have jumped 30%.

391
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,688
-Small businesses are being squeezed.
-Tell me about it.

392
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:11,695
We realize this is a big decision,
one of the oldest businesses left...

393
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:15,907
-...going back generations.
-You're not from the Plantation?

394
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,077
-Some men were here.
-Did they make an offer?

395
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:22,414
-Sniffing around, I guess.
-They're relentless.

396
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:25,083
And you're not?

397
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:30,213
The Exley Plantation is only for the
elite. What we have in mind is more...

398
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:35,301
-...democratic. Something for everybody.
-Stores, burger chains, T-shirts?

399
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:39,097
-Retail outlets would be part of it--
-123 empty?

400
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:44,394
-Should be. Your husband called.
-I don't need to talk to him.

401
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:49,315
You want to develop here, you need
the County Commission in your pocket.

402
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:51,609
We can work something out.

403
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:58,283
Testing, one, two, three.
This is a mike check. One, two, three.

404
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:05,081
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Delrona Beach's...

405
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:09,210
...annual Buccaneer Days.

406
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,313
Earl. Earl!

407
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:32,692
-Steve. I'll be right with you.
-I got those signatures.

408
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,487
Just give me a minute.

409
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:01,179
In the afternoon,
when school was out...

410
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:05,892
...and the last one had left
with his dirty little snuffling nose...

411
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:10,689
...instead of going home, I would go
down the hill to the spring...

412
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:15,110
...where I could be quiet
and hate them.

413
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:17,612
It would be quiet there then...

414
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:22,784
...with the water bubbling up and away
and the sun slanting in the trees...

415
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:28,998
...and the quiet smelling of damp
and rotting leaves and new earth.

416
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,794
Especially in the early spring.
For it was worse then.

417
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:37,716
I could remember my father used to say
that the reason for living...

418
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:43,805
...was to get ready to stay dead
a good long time.

419
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:49,894
And when I would have to look at them
day after day...

420
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:54,482
...each with his and her
secret and selfish thought...

421
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:59,279
...and blood strange to each other
and strange to mine.

422
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:03,199
And to think that this
was the only way...

423
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:06,494
...I could stay dead.

424
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:11,916
I would hate my father
for planting me.

425
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,794
And then I go on from there.

426
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:17,505
The important thing is...

427
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:22,510
...to freeze yourself
in an interesting...

428
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:27,515
...but comfortable position.
Jaime, you're about to fall over.

429
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:39,110
We'll resume tomorrow.
You should be off book by then.

430
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:43,406
I thank you all very much
for your work today.

431
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:58,797
-It is you, isn't it?
-Hello, Miss Delia.

432
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,888
It's really you.

433
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:14,020
It is so wonderful to see you.

434
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:17,315
My mother told me
you were still running this.

435
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:19,818
They'll have to drag me off.

436
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,698
Several members of the local press
have suggested that very thing.

437
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:30,203
These are my special group.
Young people with difficulties.

438
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:33,081
-What's the play?
<i>-As I Lay Dying.</i>

439
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:38,211
Rather loosely adapted, but I don't
believe Mr. Faulkner would object.

440
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:44,718
-The scene of your many triumphs.
-I let you down.

441
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:50,390
-Whatever do you mean?
-When I left. I was the lead.

442
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:54,894
Well, we did have to make
a few adjustments.

443
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:57,480
But the show must go on.

444
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,899
You played it?

445
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:04,195
Having a queen of Egypt
considerably older than her Antony...

446
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:07,407
...was very provocative.

447
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:12,120
I got to do it once when I got
to New York. In the Park.

448
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:16,207
I played the handmaiden
who gives her the asp.

449
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:21,087
I'm sure you were wonderful.
And now?

450
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,593
I trust you're still sharing
your talent with the public?

451
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:31,181
I do industrials. Representing things.

452
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,516
I do a lot of auto shows.

453
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:39,814
A temporary engagement in the world
of commerce. You're still so young.

454
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:43,902
I had my chance, Miss Delia.
It just didn't happen.

455
00:40:44,986 --> 00:40:48,615
I must say, my youthful aspirations
had nothing to do...

456
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:52,619
...with becoming the Sarah Bernhardt
of Delrona Beach.

457
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:55,413
We adjust.

458
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,920
You would've been stunning
as Cleopatra.

459
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:04,714
I was starting to show.

460
00:41:05,006 --> 00:41:06,883
I played Juliet...

461
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:11,596
...when I was five-months pregnant
with my twins.

462
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:15,308
Hello there, come on in.

463
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:20,522
-You remember my mother?
-Mrs. Temple.

464
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:22,399
So nice to see you.

465
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:28,905
And this is my-- This is Terrell.
Terrell is....

466
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,992
-It's sort of a favour.
-Whatever I can do.

467
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,205
The social worker down
at the courthouse recommended you...

468
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,917
-...because you have a program--
-For community service.

469
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:46,297
I can always use another volunteer.
Do you have any acting experience?

470
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:51,886
-No, ma'am.
-But he knows how to use tools.

471
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:56,599
Anything you can think of,
Terrell can put it together.

472
00:41:57,017 --> 00:42:01,021
Then you can do me a great service,
Terrell.

473
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:03,982
My character, Addie Bundren,
is deceased.

474
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:08,111
In the second act, I rise from the dead
for my soliloquy...

475
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:13,908
...but the local funeral parlour
has nothing suitably rustic.

476
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:18,621
Do you think you could you build me
a coffin?

477
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:25,003
"We hereby claim sovereignty
over this island...

478
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,382
...in the name of his majesty,
Philip el Segundo of Spain.

479
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:33,511
Furthermore, this tribunal declares
the mulatto, Calavera...

480
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:38,808
...otherwise known as Captain Skull,
guilty of piracy on the high seas...

481
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:44,105
...a crime against God and nature, and
sentence him to be cast into the sea...

482
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,816
...there to perish by drowning."

483
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:50,195
Does the condemned have
a final statement?

484
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:53,406
A curse on the lot of you.

485
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:56,409
Up the Jolly Roger!

486
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:15,095
Thus was the black flag
of the buccaneer...

487
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:18,515
...replaced by that
of Imperial Spain...

488
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,518
...one of many reversals of fortune...

489
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:25,897
...that mark the colourful history
of our community.

490
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:30,485
We'd like to thank Presto Pools
for the equipment, and remind you...

491
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:35,699
...that the annual Treasure Hunt
will begin tomorrow at the Delrona Mall.

492
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:42,122
Entrants should meet
at the Piercing Pagoda at 10:00.

493
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,586
-Guess who I met earlier?
-You're not telling people I'm back?

494
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,715
I didn't recognize him without the helmet.

495
00:43:51,923 --> 00:43:55,510
But you remember a football player
named Flash Phillips?

496
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,614
Every step we take is on someone's toes.

497
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:21,119
This town expects me to work miracles
with a handful of volunteers.

498
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:26,291
This bunch from Lincoln Beach say
they're gonna picket our groundbreaking.

499
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:32,505
-They complain about parking....
-The whole point is to be away from that.

500
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:38,303
-This afternoon was embarrassing.
-What? No! I thought it went fine.

501
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:41,723
-For a Chamber of Commerce thing.
-Nobody came.

502
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:45,602
-Turnout was terrific.
-Something isn't clicking.

503
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:50,398
I worked this one place,
they had the blessing of the fleet.

504
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:56,112
A bishop in his hat,
boats all dolled up. What a draw.

505
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:59,199
-I can't do religious here.
-True.

506
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:03,787
And what's our fleet? A bunch
of charter boats and day sailers.

507
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,083
-You got history to burn.
-People hate history.

508
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:13,004
You got Indians, pirates,
Spanish gold, that plantation thing.

509
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:15,799
Mass murder, rape, slavery.

510
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:21,012
So Disneyfy it a little, and they'll
come back. All you need is a hook.

511
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:25,809
I once worked this place in Wisconsin.
It was all built on wurst.

512
00:45:26,184 --> 00:45:29,896
-Wurst?
-Weisswurst, Bratwurst, Knackwurst.

513
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:32,982
Bavarian people.
Lots of strudel shops...

514
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,820
...and service people
in leather shorts and dirndls.

515
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:40,615
-And this worked?
-The beer got them in the mood.

516
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:44,911
-Free liquor.
-I like a woman in a dirndl.

517
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:49,499
I hired this guy to be an attraction.
He used to be a big Seminole.

518
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:55,213
-Indian?
-Not the Seminoles! The Seminoles.

519
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:57,090
The football team?

520
00:45:57,215 --> 00:46:01,011
Of course. What would I want
with a real Indian?

521
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:05,807
He used to be a big deal. Hung out
at Lincoln Beach, drove a Mustang....

522
00:46:06,224 --> 00:46:11,104
-A local hero! That's good.
-I just hope he shows up.

523
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:21,197
-What's his favourite thing to eat?
-Small children.

524
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:23,992
Is he alive?

525
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:28,413
-Can't hardly say.
-Why show a dead alligator?

526
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:32,417
Did you pay anything to look at him?
Then don't complain.

527
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:37,505
-He was the last of the Mohicans.
-No, they were already extinct.

528
00:46:37,922 --> 00:46:41,384
He was a Shawnee or Pawnee.
Here's Billy, he'll know.

529
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:44,721
-Chief!
-Yo, asshole.

530
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:48,516
What kind of Indian was that guy
on <i>Daniel Boone</i>?

531
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:52,312
-He was Jewish.
-I don't mean the actor, the character.

532
00:46:52,687 --> 00:46:56,524
-How should I know?
-Aren't you a full-blooded whatever?

533
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,403
-Creek.
-Regular Creek or shit creek?

534
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:03,490
-So where was Daniel Boone?
-In the woods.

535
00:47:03,823 --> 00:47:08,119
More specific than that.
Can't you tell by Indian lore?

536
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:11,498
-Lore?
-You know, like the trees or something?

537
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:16,211
-What the hell do I know about trees?
-Didn't your ancestors--?

538
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:20,090
My parents sold lawn ornaments
to stupid white people.

539
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:25,011
-You're shitting me.
-Get you a good deal on ceramic ducks.

540
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:30,684
-I couldn't really pin her down.
-But you planted the idea in her head?

541
00:47:31,184 --> 00:47:33,311
She said her father decided.

542
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:37,107
Last thing we need is to deal
with some old gomer.

543
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:39,401
-The mother?
-No, she's a flake.

544
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:42,612
She runs a theatre group,
finds homes for retired greyhounds.

545
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:45,407
She never set foot in the restaurant.

546
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:49,202
She won't be any help,
but she won't get in the way.

547
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:54,708
-So we're back to the daughter.
-The old man ran the show 24-7.

548
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:59,587
The daughter, she's paying four people
to handle the same load.

549
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:03,717
-She wants a life.
-Her rack rate is too low for that.

550
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:07,095
-The restaurant.
-The restaurant's a wash.

551
00:48:07,512 --> 00:48:12,308
You know the money a successful
franchise could make in that spot?

552
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:18,106
-All she's doing is taking up space.
-Now she's taking up space at the bar.

553
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,820
You see?
This is not a dedicated professional.

554
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,621
You're not having another of those?

555
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:40,795
-Saw Steve at the pirate thing today.
-They hang him?

556
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:42,714
Walked the plank.

557
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:46,801
-He needs to talk to you.
-Why doesn't he come by the motel?

558
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:53,099
Maybe due to the restraining order?
You had him arrested in the parking lot.

559
00:48:53,391 --> 00:48:57,020
-He was drunk as a skunk.
-He's club soda and lime now.

560
00:48:57,395 --> 00:49:03,109
-Why do you always wanna defend him?
-I'm not. I'm just saying he's on the wagon.

561
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:09,908
-Your golf pro was in the other night.
-Not my golf pro.

562
00:49:10,116 --> 00:49:14,704
He's 10 years younger than me.
Besides, he's going on tour.

563
00:49:14,996 --> 00:49:17,624
Like Tiger Woods on TV?

564
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:21,503
I don't think he'll get as much airtime
as Tiger.

565
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,092
-Did he ask you to go with him?
-It didn't come up.

566
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:29,886
You want to?

567
00:49:40,021 --> 00:49:43,024
A guy over there has been
checking you out.

568
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:45,985
Be still, my beating heart.

569
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:50,615
-What's he look like?
-Not bad.

570
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:53,910
-Tattoos?
-None visible.

571
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:57,706
Shirt say "Go Gators"
or "Stomp 'em, Seminoles"?

572
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:01,418
-It doesn't say anything.
-Obviously not my type.

573
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,294
He's cute.

574
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:09,926
I'm gonna turn around only to see what
falls under your definition of cute.

575
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:16,224
If you're at 12:00,
he's about 3:30.

576
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:37,787
Trying to imagine what it would be
like without us crackers?

577
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:41,291
-You're everywhere.
-Small island.

578
00:50:43,918 --> 00:50:48,423
I didn't mean to be intrusive before.
I thought they'd contacted you.

579
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:54,012
Don't worry about it. There's days I imagine
it all blowing away in a hurricane.

580
00:50:54,888 --> 00:51:00,393
-Must be a lot of work being a hotelier.
-Motelier. And we got the restaurant.

581
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:04,606
-I hated working there as a kid.
-And now?

582
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:08,401
I got three girls working for me
hate it as much as I do.

583
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:12,113
-Why do you...?
-Poetic justice. What are you drinking?

584
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:15,909
-Draft. How about you?
-Shots. Tequila.

585
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:19,621
If you're gonna drink,
why fuck around?

586
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,503
You're from up north.

587
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:29,798
They say everybody here is
from somewhere else.

588
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:34,594
-Not me. I'm sixth generation. At least.
-That's impressive.

589
00:51:34,886 --> 00:51:39,516
You go back that far, your people were
planters, slaves or fugitives.

590
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:40,809
Yours were...?

591
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:44,312
I don't know what they were running
from, but this is where they stopped.

592
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:49,317
-I'm from Newport, Rhode Island.
-With the yachts and big estates?

593
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:52,404
My dad took care of the lawns.

594
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:59,994
-So you've never left the island?
-Sure, I left all right.

595
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:03,623
-You're looking at a Weeki Wachee girl.
-What?

596
00:52:03,915 --> 00:52:08,712
It's a show.
It's been running since the late '40s.

597
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:14,718
-You acted?
-Performed. You do it underwater.

598
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:17,887
Let's have a contest.

599
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:26,688
You do it to me.

600
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:47,917
This isn't the guy I meant.

601
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:02,599
You win.

602
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:13,902
I could hold it twice as long
if I hadn't been drinking.

603
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:18,907
The important thing is to keep a smile,
even with water down your nose.

604
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:22,994
-How long did you work there?
-Three years.

605
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:26,790
And then I met my ex.

606
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:31,002
-He had this band. Skeeter Meter.
-Like a rock band?

607
00:53:31,294 --> 00:53:35,423
They were big around Tampa.
You listen to the Allman Brothers?

608
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:39,511
Lynyrd Skynyrd?
Then you've heard Skeeter Meter.

609
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:45,016
He was Greek and good-looking.

610
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:48,603
His daddy was a sponge diver
before they died out.

611
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:51,523
-What did they die of?
-Boredom.

612
00:53:52,899 --> 00:53:57,904
Hanging on to some rock,
soaking up whatever rolls over you.

613
00:53:58,196 --> 00:54:02,826
-Almost as bad as Delrona Beach.
-There's a lot of changes happening.

614
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:06,287
Things might pick up.

615
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:11,001
Don't hold your breath.

616
00:54:12,293 --> 00:54:16,506
They used to say folks around here
only worshipped three people:

617
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:20,802
The father, the son
and the Florida Flash.

618
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:25,390
The day he got hurt, I must have
run the replay 100 times.

619
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:28,727
He stopped coming up here.
Left school.

620
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:33,815
So you were
one of the adoring masses?

621
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:39,612
I was in high school, he was on
national TV. What do you think?

622
00:54:42,907 --> 00:54:46,202
That's some heavy story about Terrell.

623
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:59,215
A big responsibility she's taken on,
a kid like that.

624
00:55:01,092 --> 00:55:06,014
-So can you help him?
-Me?

625
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:11,227
-What am I, a shrink?
-I mean help him build this thing.

626
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:15,899
Carpentry and adolescent psychology,
two things I know nothing about.

627
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:20,028
Try, okay? For me.

628
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:24,908
I'll do what I can.

629
00:55:31,998 --> 00:55:37,295
-Maybe we'll head back on Monday.
-We just got here.

630
00:55:37,712 --> 00:55:43,718
I don't want to get sucked in to any
of this. I don't like who I am down here.

631
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:50,308
And I don't trust my mother.

632
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,695
Is that you, Elton?

633
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:15,500
I'm amazed at how little sleep
I need these days.

634
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:19,004
You've got restless feet.
Always have.

635
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,927
Sorry I couldn't be there
for you at the meeting.

636
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:29,889
You had your emergency.
How'd the hearing go?

637
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:35,311
He's still on probation.
He has to do community service.

638
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:38,815
Could have been much worse.

639
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,818
We can fall so quickly.

640
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:44,320
It's just a stumble, not a fall.

641
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:49,492
If you could just go and get it
and hand it to them.

642
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:54,914
-Nobody handed us anything.
-Of course they did.

643
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:59,794
People fought their whole lives
to keep their heads above water.

644
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:03,089
We got to start on dry land.

645
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:11,014
-So Desiree's back?
-Visiting. She's not back.

646
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:16,603
Hurricane Desiree.

647
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:22,692
The nights I sat here wondering
where that girl could be.

648
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:30,825
We used to come out here and neck
when I was in high school.

649
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:34,120
Then they had these lights in.

650
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:36,414
Security.

651
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:41,127
It's more like birth control.

652
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:52,514
-You do golf courses?
-Design them? No, that's a specialty.

653
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:57,519
-Do you play it?
-Golf? No.

654
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:35,015
I gotta tell you...

655
00:58:35,807 --> 00:58:41,312
...sex with me when I'm this drunk
is like being at the dentist.

656
00:58:42,605 --> 00:58:47,819
-The dentist?
-When they shoot you up with Novocain.

657
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:53,992
You can tell something's going on
in there but you don't know what it is.

658
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:58,413
-I understand.
-So forget it.

659
00:58:59,622 --> 00:59:02,792
It wouldn't cross my mind.

660
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:30,528
Tomorrow I won't even remember
I kissed you.

661
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:36,993
I'll come by and remind you.

662
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:39,204
Do that.

663
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,422
-You honestly don't golf?
-Never took it up.

664
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:51,216
Good.

665
01:00:01,893 --> 01:00:06,231
The important thing is
to keep that smile on your face...

666
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:10,110
...even if you're drowning.

667
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:36,803
-The polar icecap is melting.
-This is news?

668
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:42,809
They say with this global warming,
the icecap, Antarctica could melt.

669
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:48,023
-And the oceans get 20 feet higher.
-It's good we live on the 2nd floor.

670
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:51,693
Here it will be a wading pool
all the way to Orlando.

671
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:58,324
The problem started with the invention
of the internal combustion engine.

672
01:00:58,616 --> 01:01:01,828
That and air conditioning.

673
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:11,421
They say every day another species
goes extinct. It's tragic.

674
01:01:11,921 --> 01:01:16,926
Who needs a lizard the size of a van?
If those things came back today...

675
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:20,013
...people wouldn't be so thrilled.

676
01:01:21,806 --> 01:01:25,727
-Sam! What are we playing for?
-$10.00 a side...

677
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:30,231
...fifty dollars for the match,
and throw away your worst hole.

678
01:01:30,523 --> 01:01:34,527
-This might be the one.
-My grandparents were peasants.

679
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:39,115
They came from a country where
they used Jews for target practice.

680
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:44,913
They only ever ate beets or turnips.
We brought my <i>tante</i> over here.

681
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:47,624
She wouldn't go to the park.
She said:

682
01:01:47,999 --> 01:01:51,628
"Next time I look at grass,
it should be growing over my body."

683
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,216
-I like to watch that Jungle Channel.
-Animals eating animals.

684
01:01:56,508 --> 01:02:00,095
-It's educational.
-For a wolverine, possibly.

685
01:02:00,428 --> 01:02:05,892
"How to hibernate in three easy lessons."
For human beings, what good is that?

686
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:09,229
When was the last time
you stalked a creature?

687
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:14,192
-I go duck-hunting with my son.
-I forgot. You people shoot birds.

688
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:16,611
Shooting is not the point.

689
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:21,408
You're out there when the sun comes up,
surrounded by nature.

690
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:23,702
Nature is overrated.

691
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,415
But we'll miss it when it's gone.

692
01:02:42,595 --> 01:02:44,014
Scotty?

693
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,728
-Sorry to distract you.
-No, I need it.

694
01:02:49,894 --> 01:02:53,606
Come closer.
Come on down into the trap.

695
01:02:55,233 --> 01:03:00,405
Where I'm headed, you don't play
in a vacuum. TV camera, a gallery.

696
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:03,533
Everybody's right on top of you.

697
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,622
Try to keep that distance.

698
01:03:11,332 --> 01:03:12,792
Are you okay?

699
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:16,921
Yes. I thought we should,
like, make it official.

700
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:19,632
What?

701
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,718
Breaking up.

702
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:31,728
You're going off on your tour and all.

703
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:36,399
Yeah.

704
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:43,198
Win one tournament, you make more
than a year working here.

705
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:46,701
-It's not the money.
-It's not?

706
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:56,419
It's this thing that I do. Better than
almost anybody else on earth.

707
01:03:56,795 --> 01:04:00,924
If I don't take another whack
at the highest level....

708
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:04,094
It's the purest thing that--

709
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:10,934
Pretty stupid, huh? Talking
about golf like it's important.

710
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:15,605
It isn't stupid at all,
you really love it.

711
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:23,905
You just don't love me.

712
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:35,125
Buster's Place.

713
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:41,423
-How long's it been like this?
-All messed up? Couple of years.

714
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:44,718
-There was a fire.
-Nobody's fixed it up?

715
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:48,596
The people it belonged to
didn't come back.

716
01:04:51,516 --> 01:04:55,103
-So you have, like, a crew?
-On a boat?

717
01:04:55,395 --> 01:04:59,024
-Guys you hang with.
-No.

718
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:03,695
So what are you into?
Interested in.

719
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:06,698
Stuff.

720
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:15,498
Like sports? Music?

721
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:19,794
I guess.

722
01:05:25,508 --> 01:05:27,594
You think we got enough?

723
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,514
Never built a coffin before.

724
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:36,311
It used to be five yards
in a cloud of dust.

725
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:40,023
No mouth guards,
no face guards.

726
01:05:40,398 --> 01:05:43,818
The helmet was a leather strap
to hold the brain in...

727
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:49,115
...in case you got cracked
on the skull. What is it now?

728
01:05:49,407 --> 01:05:53,828
Technology? Hormones?

729
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:58,124
Bunch of coloured boys flipping
a ball around the field.

730
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:03,213
Women in the locker room?
That ain't gridiron.

731
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:07,008
-What are they doing?
-Did you say something?

732
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:12,097
-What are women doing in the locker room?
-Talking to the players.

733
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:15,600
They must find it very distracting.

734
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:19,729
They're too worried about
their stock portfolios to notice.

735
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:23,608
It's a wonder they know what
a handoff is.

736
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,820
-How do you know they're coloured?
-Who?

737
01:06:27,195 --> 01:06:30,407
The boys flipping the ball.
You can't see the TV.

738
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:34,494
When do you hear of a white boy
called Deshon?

739
01:06:36,996 --> 01:06:40,125
Carlotta will be here for dinner.
I have rehearsal...

740
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:43,420
...and then an Audubon meeting.

741
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:46,297
You and your birds.

742
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:51,302
They start clearing the Plantation
Estates expansion next week...

743
01:06:51,594 --> 01:06:54,514
-...at the old Exley property.
-Lincoln Beach?

744
01:06:54,806 --> 01:06:56,599
Not anymore.

745
01:06:56,808 --> 01:07:00,603
There's a bird colony
we're concerned about.

746
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:04,524
The coloured folks think
there's a curse on that land.

747
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:07,610
I'm sure it has seen
its share of misery.

748
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:10,321
Hey, Mama.

749
01:07:11,197 --> 01:07:13,116
Hey, Daddy.

750
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:16,411
-Trouble at the motel?
-Everything's fine.

751
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:20,915
-Then why aren't you there?
-We got a day manager. Rosellen.

752
01:07:21,332 --> 01:07:26,421
-Those people steal you blind.
-She's got it under control.

753
01:07:31,801 --> 01:07:33,720
Are these new ones?

754
01:07:34,095 --> 01:07:36,598
I can't remember
when you were here last.

755
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:40,810
-They all look alike to me.
-The place full up?

756
01:07:41,102 --> 01:07:44,397
-Yes. Celebration.
-How about the restaurant?

757
01:07:44,814 --> 01:07:46,024
Keeping us hopping.

758
01:07:46,232 --> 01:07:48,902
-Gotta make it while it's there.
-I know.

759
01:07:49,235 --> 01:07:53,531
-Steven was calling for you.
-He knows I don't live here.

760
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:59,120
-It was nice talking to him.
-He's got a screw loose. Deep-sea diving.

761
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:02,916
-That was his father.
-Puts pressure on the brain.

762
01:08:03,124 --> 01:08:06,711
Steve's put pressure on his brain,
but not by diving.

763
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:11,132
He said he's turning over
a new leaf. I certainly hope so.

764
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:15,428
-He had such promise.
-When did Steve ever have promise?

765
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:19,224
When he had his group
and you were with the circus.

766
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:22,310
It wasn't a circus.
We stayed in one place.

767
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:26,022
When you were performing
in the aquarium.

768
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:31,903
-You both were so hopeful.
-Well, we grew up.

769
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:38,034
Daddy? There was a fella from
a development company over yesterday.

770
01:08:38,535 --> 01:08:41,121
You give him the boot?

771
01:08:41,413 --> 01:08:46,835
I was thinking this might be
a good time, if you ever wanted to sell.

772
01:08:48,003 --> 01:08:51,423
And watch them turn the beach
into a strip mall?

773
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:56,928
-It's not exactly pristine at the moment.
-You help keep the place running?

774
01:08:57,303 --> 01:09:00,223
-I have not.
-Then hold your peace.

775
01:09:00,598 --> 01:09:05,311
-She's worried about those birds.
-It's a severely compromised habitat.

776
01:09:05,603 --> 01:09:09,899
-The sandhill cranes have forsaken us.
-Good.

777
01:09:10,316 --> 01:09:14,112
If they don't know better than to fly
someplace accommodating...

778
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,698
...then they deserve what they get.

779
01:09:17,032 --> 01:09:22,412
Now your sea gull, that's like people.
They'll fight over every scrap they get.

780
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:28,209
-Your father is a strict Darwinian.
-She throws her education against me.

781
01:09:28,626 --> 01:09:32,422
Anyway, this developer....

782
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:39,304
-I told him you weren't interested.
-You can bet on that one.

783
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:12,212
Get in there! Come on!
Get in there!

784
01:10:28,603 --> 01:10:32,107
They give you specs for this thing?
Like dimensions?

785
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:37,404
-There's a picture in the book.
-If she's gonna get into it....

786
01:10:42,534 --> 01:10:45,829
This doesn't give us
the measurements.

787
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:52,836
-You're taller than her.
-Right.

788
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:10,228
Better cut some holes
so she can breathe.

789
01:11:24,617 --> 01:11:29,205
-Halt! Who goes there?
-Don't shoot. It's your ex-wife.

790
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:35,128
-I'm on guard duty.
-Maple said you needed to see me.

791
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:39,799
-Pretend you're just a tourist.
-Steve, come on.

792
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:45,221
I'm serious. We got an inspector
coming by to review the unit.

793
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:03,615
-Nice uniform.
-I hate playing a Yankee.

794
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:09,329
-You're Greek, for chrissake.
-I was born down here.

795
01:12:09,621 --> 01:12:13,625
-So, what's the latest crisis?
-No crisis.

796
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:19,214
Just wondering how you were
making out. Seriously.

797
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:23,635
I found inner peace.
What's the angle?

798
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:27,305
I heard about something.
I'd like to cut you in.

799
01:12:27,597 --> 01:12:31,017
-Not interested.
-It's once in a lifetime.

800
01:12:31,309 --> 01:12:34,813
-So was our marriage. Once was enough.
-Hear me out.

801
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:39,734
If you don't want to be a co-investor,
we can work out a reasonable rate....

802
01:12:40,026 --> 01:12:46,032
-You want to borrow money from me?
-I could get in on something big.

803
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:50,203
Tell me, what do we not have
on this island?

804
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:54,624
Let's see. An opera house.

805
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,128
A ski resort. A good Thai restaurant.

806
01:12:58,336 --> 01:13:04,426
-Are you familiar with water slides?
-Them plastic chute things?

807
01:13:04,926 --> 01:13:07,512
You slide down it
in your bathing suit?

808
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:11,808
-We don't have one.
-I knew I was culturally disadvantaged.

809
01:13:12,225 --> 01:13:14,436
Know how much those things make?

810
01:13:14,728 --> 01:13:17,522
-A: You'll never get a permit.
-Don't be so sure.

811
01:13:17,814 --> 01:13:22,027
B: I don't have any money
to throw at half-assed propositions.

812
01:13:22,402 --> 01:13:26,239
-I heard you're about to come into some.
-Is that so?

813
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:31,119
My sources inform me you've been
approached by some big developers.

814
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:35,832
They don't know diddly.
Besides, C: even if I did have money...

815
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:40,920
...I'd run it through the leaf shredder
before I gave a nickel of it to you.

816
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:47,761
I heard your golfer's decided
to take a walk.

817
01:13:47,844 --> 01:13:52,474
He didn't ask you to come along
on the tour, did he?

818
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,978
Do you have any other business
with me? I'm seriously hung-over...

819
01:13:57,062 --> 01:14:00,357
-...I gotta get back--
-This is the real deal--

820
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,650
It's just another scam.

821
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:08,573
Like your band, like the mail order
iguana business, the treasure hunt....

822
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:12,660
-Skeeter Meter rocked!
-But you didn't care about the music.

823
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:15,663
You just wanted to be famous
and get laid.

824
01:14:15,872 --> 01:14:20,543
You know why you're stuck running
that flophouse? You got no vision.

825
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:24,839
You think I'd loan you money
after all you put me through?

826
01:14:25,048 --> 01:14:29,260
That's all over and done with.
You can't live in the past.
