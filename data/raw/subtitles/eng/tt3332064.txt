Translation and review by Angel.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,128
<i>I am going to tell you a story.</i>

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,971
<i>About a boy.
Who would never grow up.</i>

4
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,131
<i>About the pirate.
Who wished to kill him.</i>

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,490
<i>About the island.
Where fairies roamed.</i>

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,486
<i>But, this is not the story.
You have heard before.</i>

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,966
<i>Because sometimes,</i>

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,963
<i>friends begin as enemies,</i>

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,481
<i>and, enemies begin as friends.</i>

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,803
<i>Sometimes, you truly understand
how things end.</i>

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,004
<i>We must first know
how they begin.</i>

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,081
<i>Come on!</i>

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,981
THE LAMBERTH HOME FOR BOYS

14
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,729
I love you. My son.

15
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,770
I love you.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,331
My Peter.

17
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,044
Wakey! Wakey!

18
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,044
Rise and shine!

19
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,691
Come on! Now!

20
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,291
That is it. Come on!

21
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,204
Move along.
Come on! Quickly now!

22
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,691
Peter! We will miss
the breakfast.

23
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,891
The heroes have risen.
They must now feed!

24
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,080
<i>Quiet over there!</i>

25
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,121
<I>I said quiet!</I>

26
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,885
<I>Eat that up! Now!</I>

27
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,808
<I>I will not tell you again!</I>

28
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,087
Where is the bacon?

29
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,687
We always have bacon
rind of a weekend.

30
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,809
There is a war on, Peter.
Rationing.

31
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,846
You are lucky to have
any food at all.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,120
Mother Barnabas, forgive me.

33
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,241
Get over there.

34
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,086
How much you want to bet.
She is nicking all the rations.

35
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,731
She will hear you.

36
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,490
She has got ears
like an elephant.

37
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,523
Bum like one, too.

38
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,367
Look!

39
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,409
More empty seats.

40
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,921
Nelson and Billy both
have been evacuating.

41
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,161
Lucky sods.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,001
Both of them?

43
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,366
- When?
<i>- I do not know.</i>

44
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,403
When I woke up,
they were both gone.

45
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,887
Off to some family in Canada
until the war is over.

46
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,681
I would not mind going there.

47
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,689
Do not be daft.
You have to stay put.

48
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,689
For when our moms
come fetch us.

49
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,927
Exactly.

50
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,970
We hunker down here.
Hold the fort.

51
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,804
Wait for the cavalry.

52
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,000
Now! Get on that roof and
clean those filthy gutters.

53
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,245
Is it safe, Mother Barnabas?

54
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,164
Well! I have not
tested it myself, like.

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,561
You know, not recently.

56
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,630
But all the necessary
paperwork is in order.

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,207
Should an orphan
perish in a fall.

58
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,050
Now! Get up there!

59
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,091
While you are aloft,
and closer to our Lord.

60
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,328
You may reflect on
your festering souls.

61
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,808
Your souls that fester
as do the leaves.

62
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,527
See! I was right!

63
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,087
She is hoarding
all the rations.

64
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,766
Where is she hiding
all the grub?

65
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,691
Her office.
No one has ever been in there.

66
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,008
I heard a rumor.
It is booby-trapped.

67
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,767
Silence, I said: Quiet!

68
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,644
Everyone, down to
the shelters!

69
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,205
In chaos is death!

70
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,041
- Come on!
- I do not like this.

71
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,844
Fort Knox.

72
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,000
The lair of the dragon.

73
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,760
Whoa!

74
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,006
Come here.

75
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,204
So, put your hands there.

76
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,001
I need your shoe, fella.

77
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,203
- Could you just...
- Quiet!

78
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,481
Right.

79
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,170
Nineteen.

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,486
Twenty.

81
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,124
Peter.

82
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,201
Ugh! What a dirty old nun.

83
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,006
<i>This is so unhygienic.</i>

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,846
<i>Why is the Virgin Mary
so clean?</i>

85
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,449
- Nibs?
<i>- Down here!</i>

86
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,483
Nibs!

87
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,681
I told you.

88
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,086
Booby-trapped.

89
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,049
It is a treasure trove.

90
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,286
<i>Flipping heck!</i>

91
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,691
Peter!

92
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,569
It is the records.

93
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,006
Peter!

94
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,810
It is your file.

95
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,641
<i>Is it from your mom?</i>

96
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,721
<i>What does she say?</i>

97
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,006
<i>I cannot.</i>

98
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,446
Will you read it?

99
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,044
I meant aloud.

100
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,324
<i>"My dearest Peter."</i>

101
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,169
<i>"Everything I have done."</i>

102
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,808
<i>"I have done
because I love you."</i>

103
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,647
<i>"I long for the day that
I will come back for you."</i>

104
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,729
<i>"And explain everything."</i>

105
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,090
"Do not doubt me."

106
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,402
"Nor most importantly."

107
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,244
"Do not doubt yourself."

108
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,844
"You are extraordinary."

109
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,287
<i>"More than you can imagine."</i>

110
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,726
<i>I promise that
you will see me again.</i>

111
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,689
<i>In this world or another.</i>

112
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,287
Come on!

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,082
That is my private property!
Give it back!

114
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,763
You know, Peter, every little
orphan dreams he is special.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,331
That he will be the one.

116
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,609
Whose mother comes?
A-skipping back for him.

117
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,882
However, your mom is
not for skipping.

118
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,969
Why is that?

119
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,567
Because you are not
special, Peter.

120
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,603
<i>You are not even special.</i>

121
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,848
In your own way.

122
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,720
You are just a nasty
little creature.

123
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,803
Abandoned by a feckless mom.

124
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,691
Who has forgotten you exist.

125
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,001
You little savage!

126
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,966
Hands! The both of you!

127
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,241
He never did anything!

128
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,364
He is guilty by association.

129
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,886
It is time.

130
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,605
For the pine.

131
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,205
Hi. Skinny.

132
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,843
Arnold and the twins,
When did they go?

133
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,088
My guess, it were last night.

134
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,009
All the missing children.

135
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,164
All that dough
hidden in her office.

136
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,930
What is Barnabas up to?

137
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,685
She is selling orphans.

138
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,410
I knew it!

139
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,605
I mean, is she?
That is not nice.

140
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,611
But who in the world
buys orphans at night.

141
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,251
That is what
we have to find out.

142
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,804
<i>Now! Come on! Let us make
a plan. It will be fun.</i>

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,490
<i>I have heard that one before.</i>

144
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,968
Who guffed one?

145
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,681
<i>Nibs!</i>

146
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,041
I never.

147
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
This was a stupid plan.
I am going back to bed.

148
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,485
<i>Come on!</i>

149
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,165
- Night.
- Night.

150
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,050
- Nibs!
<i>- Peter!</i>

151
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,686
I told you. It would
happen tonight.

152
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,086
I was right!

153
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,170
What?

154
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,210
Head for the stairs.

155
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,005
Go!

156
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,485
Nibs!

157
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,401
Goodbye, Peter!

158
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,280
- You are coming with me!
- Let us go!

159
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,809
Peter.

160
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,961
Holy pudding!

161
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,491
Prepare to set sail!

162
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,610
We have to get out of here.

163
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,801
<i>We will have to jump.</i>

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,047
I cannot!

165
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,726
<i>We will have to!</i>

166
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,126
Come on!

167
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,001
Nibs!

168
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,009
And, away we go!

169
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,571
Come on!

170
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,764
Friends until death!

171
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,405
Peter!

172
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,208
Damn it. You have
sunk my frigate.

173
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,880
Ma'am. Luftwaffe. Inbound.

174
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,531
Ladies.

175
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,683
Sector 6, sector 8, sector 12.

176
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,211
<i>Incoming!</i>

177
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,726
Spitfire!

178
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,884
<i>- Clear the deck!
- Ready your swords!</i>

179
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,401
Come on!

180
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,049
Ma'am, regarding identification,

181
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,765
<i>of the enemy. Aircraft,</i>

182
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,247
<i>it rather resembles a...</i>

183
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,726
Spit it out, man.

184
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,366
<i>It looks like a pirate ship,
ma'am.</i>

185
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,647
Come again.

186
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,886
Fire!

187
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,801
Whoa!

188
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,601
Get off.

189
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,131
<i>Do not go dying.</i>

190
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,446
You are precious cargo.

191
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,604
- Am I?
- Somebody thinks so.

192
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,684
Is it my mother?

193
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,767
Going up!

194
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,002
Get out here! You little rat!

195
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,241
Make your move!

196
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,245
<i>Come on! Hurry up!</i>

197
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,442
Move it! Come on!

198
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,490
<i>Right this ship for docking.</i>

199
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,489
<i>Haul away!</i>

200
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,841
Come on! Fellas.

201
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,489
Look! It is daylight.

202
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,761
I want to see this!

203
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,000
- What is that?
- Move. I cannot see.

You weep molten pearls
of innocent tears.

241
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,806
Dry them, dear nippers.

242
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,562
I have sprung you
from life is cruel dungeon.

243
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,127
And, hereby grant
you liberty!

244
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,923
Suffer no more.

245
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,920
Come unto me. You are home.

246
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,444
Here you join orphans alike.

247
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,165
From every corner of the globe.

248
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,602
Every race, creed, and color.

249
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,681
<i>Every age and era.</i>

250
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,001
<i>You are pioneers.</i>

251
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,845
Brave creators of
a new society.

252
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,127
For this…

253
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,529
My poppets, is a land
of opportunity!

254
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,687
My justice is divine.

255
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,690
My laws are so simple.

256
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,360
You could write them
on a pig's ear.

257
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,680
In fact! I have.

258
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,001
Law: Number one.

259
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,807
<i>"Those who work with bright,
honest vigor."</i>

260
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,803
<i>"Will be rewarded
with prizes."</i>

261
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,009
"And trophies."

262
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,210
"And confectionery!"

263
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,009
<i>Law: Number two.</i>

264
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,806
"Those who fail
to work hard."

265
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,482
"Those who skive or malinger."

266
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,801
"Will hereby know the brooding
majesty of my disapproval."

267
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,651
<i>Mark me well.</i>

268
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,165
I know no pity.

269
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,244
No second chances.
I do not do mercy.

270
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,050
However, remember…

271
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,681
Do not forget
to help yourselves.

272
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,844
Lots and lots
of jolly old fun!

273
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Kiddie winks.

274
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,521
Welcome to Neverland!

275
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,567
<i>Put some effort into it.</i>

276
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,445
<i>You would better find
me some Pixum!</i>

277
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,730
<i>Harder! Work harder!</i>

278
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,363
Sam Smiegel, supervisor.

279
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,727
No. Thank you. Take it off.

280
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,088
- Whoa!
- Excuse me.

281
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,281
What for is we digging.

282
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,205
Did no one explain?

283
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,721
We are mining…

284
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,722
For these little chaps.

285
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,406
Fairy dust, otherwise
known as Pixum.

286
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,041
Fairies are real!

287
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,321
They were real. Yeah.

288
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,483
There were millions of them
all over the island.

289
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,926
What happened to them?

290
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,242
Blackbeard hunted them
into extinction.

291
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,044
- Why?
<i>- For the fairy dust.</i>

292
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,480
You know. The old Pixum.

293
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,767
What for does he want it?

294
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,324
I do not have any idea.

295
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,245
No one knows. No one has
allowed to know.

296
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,926
Well! You best not
dwell on it. Just...

297
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,131
<i>Get and move on!</i>

298
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,243
Real! Actual fairies.

299
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,765
<i>Hey! New kid.</i>

300
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,529
You just got here
on a flying pirate ship.

301
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,331
"Real" should be a very fluid
concept for you right now.

302
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,962
Get to digging.

303
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,202
Give me your pick. Kid.

304
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,762
Your hand has all messed up.
Because your blade is blunted.

305
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,411
If you keep swinging
like that…

306
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,443
You are going to
break your wrist.

307
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,846
I am Peter.

308
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,766
How long have you been here?

309
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,167
Forever.

310
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,329
Do you know why they want it?
So badly. The Pixum?

311
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,489
You ask too many
questions. Kid.

312
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,326
They kill for it. We die for it.
End of the story.

313
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,443
- Thank you very much.
<i>- Do not thank me.</i>

314
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,200
I do not care about you.

315
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,130
<i>I am not your friend.</i>

316
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,209
And, I do not have your back.

317
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,489
Simple as that.

318
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,531
Shoo! Kid.

319
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,209
Fairy dust.

320
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,485
I found some of it.

321
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,681
That is mine!

322
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,881
No!

323
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,201
I found some it!

324
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,528
Thief! I found it!

325
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,368
Hi. Small fry, button it.

326
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,561
Move!

327
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,841
Give it to me.

328
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,242
It was mine!
I found the fairy Pixum!

329
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,527
This bogey stole it.

330
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,920
<i>He said he found it.</i>

331
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,243
That means he found it. Clear.

332
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,925
Clear as the scar
on your ugly face!

333
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,960
<i>Take him…</i>

334
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,367
To the Captain!
Disorder and verbal.

335
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,721
Move out of the way. Move it.

336
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,927
Get out of the way!

337
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,280
There... There is a procedure
for this. You know.

338
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,521
You have not supposed to...

339
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,404
Shut it, Mr. Clipboard.

340
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,565
Let us see what
Blackbeard makes…

341
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,041
Of this nasty little thief.

342
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,040
What are you looking at?
I was trying my best.

343
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,407
<i>Well! Go on, then.
Back to work. Thank you.</i>

344
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,409
Did you find the
natives' camp?

345
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,568
They found us. Sir.

346
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,091
They sprang from the trees.

347
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,601
And, laid waste to 40 of our
most formidable men.

348
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,841
Then they disappeared…

349
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,525
Back into the forest.
As if, they were never there.

350
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,982
- Whoa! Whoa!
- We will get them. Captain.

351
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,691
Given the proper time.

352
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,766
Time?

353
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,964
I have sucked
these mines dry.

354
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,441
There is almost nothing left.
I must have their lands.

355
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,721
However, these savages…

356
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,604
Continue to ambush my ships.

357
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,040
Operating from
some hidden camp.

358
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,645
Which no one
can seem to find…

359
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,441
Yet you assure me all will
be given the proper time.

360
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,608
There is no time! None!

361
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,441
Excuse me. Captain.

362
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,610
Hey! Ho.

363
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,450
The show must go on.

364
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,084
How do the miners seem?

365
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,123
Dirty, feverish, on the
brink of collapse. Sir.

366
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,291
Why must it be so hard?

367
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,446
So...

368
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,849
Whom are we making
an example today?

369
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,002
<i>♪ Hey ho, let us go! ♪</i>

370
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,402
<i>♪ Hey ho, let us go! ♪</i>

371
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,200
<i>♪ They are forming
in a straight line. ♪</i>

372
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,760
<i>♪ They are going through
a tight wind. ♪</i>

373
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,485
No! No!

374
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,530
What is going on?

375
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,364
What do you think?

376
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,443
<i>♪ They are piling
in the backseat. ♪</i>

377
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,483
<i>♪ They are generating
steam heat. ♪</i>

378
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,209
<i>♪ Pulsating to
the back beat. ♪</i>

379
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,930
<i>♪ The Blitzkrieg Bop. ♪</i>

380
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,171
Any clearer now?

381
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,448
<i>♪ Hey ho, let us go! ♪</i>

382
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:02,490
<i>♪ Hey! Ho, let us go! ♪</i>

383
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,369
Yeah!

384
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,681
Brave heroes of Neverland.

385
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,848
Behold these traitors.

386
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,284
<i>I entrust their fate
to your gracious whim.</i>

387
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,009
This barbarian...

388
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,760
Caught stealing from
the grain store.

389
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,166
Was caught squealing?
From the grain store.

390
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,361
Stealing.

391
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,561
- Stealing.
- Twice.

392
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,801
Twice!

393
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,362
- Will you spare him?
<i>- No!</i>

394
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,881
Or, do you lust for justice?

395
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,400
Justice!

396
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,881
- Yes!
- Justice!

397
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,566
- Do they ever have mercy?
- Yes! They do.

398
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,087
Often?

399
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,170
Let us go!

400
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,689
Do not answer that.

401
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,530
This boy has been in
our mines but one day…

402
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,730
And, he has already proven
himself to be a thief.

403
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,770
<i>A rabble sourer.</i>

404
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,240
And, a Pixum fraudster.

405
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,720
- I never!
<i>- I ask…</i>

406
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,604
Shall you have mercy?
For the willful child?

407
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,251
<i>No!</i>

408
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,243
Or, do you be nasty?

409
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,566
<i>Nasty!</i>

410
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,246
Nasty! Nasty! Nasty!

411
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,926
<i>Alack!</i>

412
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,882
The people have spoken.

413
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,048
Think a happy thought.

414
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,651
I will have be darned.

415
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,400
I do not believe it!
I can fly!

416
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,801
<i>Neverland is a dream.</i>

417
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,288
From which you never wake.

418
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,687
Ever had that one?

419
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,041
A dreadful nightmare
you know is not real.

420
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,487
However, your sleep is so heavy…

421
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,122
So, deep, so delicious…

422
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,287
That you just cannot wake up.

423
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,690
<i>Drowning in sleep.</i>

424
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,284
<i>Slow dream.</i>

425
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,809
Drowning in the
soft, black sea.

426
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,211
Do you know that sea? Peter.

427
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,682
<i>It is death. Boy.</i>

428
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,369
Murmuring to you.

429
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,568
It is where we end.

430
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,849
Most of us.

431
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,691
Would you like
some chocolate?

432
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,566
Childhood is not so jolly.

433
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,841
In fact. It is rather
frightening.

434
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,406
Agree?

435
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,203
Are you brave? Peter.

436
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,450
I try to be.

437
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,923
Yes! Of course!

438
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,287
Are you scared?

439
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,721
Yes.

440
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,922
Have you ever flown before?

441
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,406
No.

442
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,162
Beyond that wall.
There are savage people.

443
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,890
<i>They have an
ancient prophecy.</i>

444
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,567
<i>From when the fairy kingdoms
reigned on this island.</i>

445
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,482
The prophecy tells of a boy
born of the love.

446
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,604
Between a fairy prince
and a human girl.

447
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,842
<i>A boy who would be
disappeared from this world.</i>

448
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,081
Until he was old enough…

449
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,682
To return and lead
an uprising against me.

450
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,327
A boy, so says the prophecy…

451
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,001
Who could fly?

452
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,009
Have you come
to kill me? Peter.

453
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,527
I do not believe in
bedtime stories.

454
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,840
<i>"I... I."</i>

455
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,725
<i>I promise that.
You will see me again.</i>

456
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,565
<i>In this world or another.</i>

457
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,320
"Or another."

458
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,367
Go on! Get in there!

459
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,525
"Or another."

460
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,242
<i>- Hey! Fly boy.</i>
- Yeah?

461
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,563
That was some little airshow.
You put on out there.

462
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,410
<i>Could you do that again?</i>

463
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,761
Who wants to know?

464
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,767
Of course! I can fly.
You saw me.

465
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,846
Good.

466
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,081
Put your ear to that
wall over there.

467
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,283
<i>Now that is the sound
of a blast cap.</i>

468
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,760
<i>I stuck to the other side…</i>

469
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,042
Set to go off in 30 seconds.

470
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,610
If I fly. Will you help me?
To find my mother.

471
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,804
I reckon, she is here
on the island.

472
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,242
It is not a negotiation. Kid.

473
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,249
Without me. You are
stuck in this cell.

474
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,249
Without me. You are
stuck in these mines.

475
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,962
Okay! Then we will
talk about it.

476
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,400
Just move away
from that wall.

477
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,200
Before, you get yourself
blown up. All right?

478
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,640
- So, what is it going to be?
- Kid!

479
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,404
Tick.

480
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,641
Tack.

481
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,060
Okay! We have a deal, just...

482
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,891
Fly boy?

483
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,122
Hurry! Slide down.
They will be coming for us.

484
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,611
If I am going to trust you.
I need to know your name.

485
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,167
It is Hook. The name
is James Hook.

486
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,004
- Happy?
- No!

487
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,760
Left foot in front
of the other…

488
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,926
Put the right one
in front of the other.

489
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,804
That is it. It has called walking.
Go on. Go on.

490
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,161
<i>Smee.</i>

491
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,807
Well! Go on, then. Carry on.

492
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,001
<i>- Smee. Down here!</i>
- Whoa!

493
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,969
<i>Six o'clock.</i>

494
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,366
I do not... Yes...

495
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,760
<i>Darn it, Smee, in the basket.</i>

496
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,005
Please do not call me Smee?

497
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,521
Smee. Can you get me?
To the surface.

498
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,204
There is no use.

499
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,124
Once you are up there.
You cannot get anywhere else.

500
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,209
Not today.

501
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,201
Good knowing you.

502
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,851
<i>You have been a true friend.</i>

503
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,849
Someday I will find a way
to repay you.

504
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,724
Now! Send us up.

505
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,367
What the heck?

506
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,881
You just said someday…
You will find a way to repay me.

507
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,566
Someday, not today. Get out!

508
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,406
I think that is a very
minor technicality.

509
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,722
Someday could be today,
if you think about it.

510
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,120
<i>- And...
- Smee!</i>

511
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,247
<i>Yes.</i>

512
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,686
<i>That is where we are headed.</i>

513
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,684
The Skyport.

514
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,082
We can take one of
the cable cars up to the dock.

515
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,242
<i>Then you will fly
us to a ship.</i>

516
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,925
<i>Okay?</i>

517
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,610
Keep your head down. Kid.

518
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,643
Go! Go!

519
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,649
See? They anchor the galleons
far enough off the dock.

520
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,723
<i>So, they are impossible
to steal.</i>

521
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,645
So, you want me to fly from the
dock, over to one of the...

522
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,650
What? Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

523
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,684
Have we meant to stop?

524
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,241
Whoa!

525
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,163
Heave! Heave!

526
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,844
Forget the Skyport.
You have to do it now.

527
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,849
<i>Are you waiting
for a formal invitation?</i>

528
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,844
- Go! Now!
- I am afraid of heights!

529
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,491
What? You can fly!

530
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,125
Yesterday was my first time.

531
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,560
<i>Well! You had better fly again.</i>

532
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,320
<i>Or we are all going to fall
for the last time.</i>

533
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,169
Might we bicker
about this later?

534
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,646
Smee! The sword!

535
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,205
Yeah! That is going to work. Kid.

536
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,806
Get up there.
And, wave it at them.

537
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,641
<i>Heave!</i>

538
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,051
That was close.

539
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,683
Do you know how
to work a ship?

540
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,848
How hard could it be?

541
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,402
- Smee! The rope!
- Yes! Yes!

542
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,083
- Clear!
- Boy!

543
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,730
<i>Whoa!</i>

544
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,924
This is a lot harder
than it looks!

545
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,925
Yeah! We are sailing now!

546
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,565
Well! Do you have?
Anything to say?

547
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,764
I worked hard setting
up that table.

548
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,440
What? Forget the table.
Pick them up later.

549
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,080
If that boy makes it
to the natives.

550
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,651
You can forget any chance
of us winning this war.

551
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,881
All will be lost.

552
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,526
<i>We will find them, sir.
They cannot have gone far.</i>

553
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,842
Well! Then where are they?

554
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,481
Get me that boy
before the savages do it!

555
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,369
Dead ahead!

556
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,370
<i>Smee! Get off my leg!</i>

557
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,923
<i>I think I am going
to be sick!</i>

558
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,605
The wall! The wall!

559
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,371
Somebody, please help me!

560
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,886
Turn!

561
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,331
Smee! Get the sails up!

562
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,200
We need a strong headwind
to make the jump!

563
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,681
What jump?

564
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,884
Home! We are getting
the heck off this island!

565
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,407
No!

566
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,971
You said we would
find my mother!

567
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,206
I am not leaving Neverland!

568
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,728
Well! Not now, anyway!

569
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,649
Get the sails up!

570
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,126
The sails!

571
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,850
This is going to be
a little rough!

572
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,764
Put the sails up!

573
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,721
How many times...?

574
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,005
I am not to be disturbed.
When I am at the Rejuvenation!

575
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,321
Yes?

576
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,206
I am sorry, Captain.
However, it is about the boy.

577
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,768
<i>The stolen ship went down
in the Never wood.</i>

578
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,041
So, the boy is lost.

579
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,089
Yes. Sir. He is a lost boy.

580
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,203
<i>But our best men are
searching for him now.</i>

581
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,768
Imbeciles surround me.
Must I do everything myself?

582
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,724
Sir. You cannot
really, believe…

583
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,002
That this squeak is the one.

584
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,531
He hardly seems capable.

585
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,360
His mother hardly
seemed capable either.

586
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,606
And, yet, here we are.

587
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,008
The deal was to help me
to find my mother.

588
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,129
You were going to break it.
That is very wrong.

589
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,482
No. You broke the deal first.
You lied to us.

590
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,763
No. I fibbed. I can fly.
Just not every day.

591
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,365
Whoa!

592
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,401
Our only way off this island…

593
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,682
And, now it is in pieces.
Satisfied?

594
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,684
Well! Yes. I am
quite content.

595
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,640
Because I do not want to
get off this island.

596
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,650
<i>All the years that I have
wasted planning to get out.</i>

597
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,251
<i>All gone.</i>

598
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,885
Hey! Quit messing around.
It is not safe in here.

599
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,806
<i>Every ship has one.</i>

600
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,047
A what?

601
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,846
<i>A map!</i>

602
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,246
<i>What does that say?</i>

603
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,326
"Tribal Territory."

604
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,130
Exactly.

605
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,529
The prophecy said:
"A boy would lead the tribe."

606
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,600
So, what? You do not care!

607
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,043
I do. Keep going.

608
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,210
Well! Blackbeard thinks
the prophecy is about me.

609
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,050
Which means my mom?
Is from here.

610
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,120
This means the natives
might know where she is.

611
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,721
<i>Are you insane?</i>

612
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,082
If those savages would just
kill you. I help you.

613
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,486
- Ever met one.
<i>- No!</i>

614
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,760
And, I do not plan to meet.

615
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,571
Well! They might be very nice.
I am not afraid of them.

616
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,001
There is a fine line between
bravery and suicide. Kid.

617
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,722
I am going off to find the Tribal
Territory. Goodbye!

618
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,445
He will not last an hour
out there.

619
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,642
His problem. Not ours.

620
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,929
Thing in this, if he
was the chosen one...

621
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,731
If that prophecy is real.
Trust me, he is not it.

622
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,769
But, if they thought, he was...

623
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,725
They believed he was...

624
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,360
I bet they would
handsomely reward…

625
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,600
<i>Anyone who brought him
to them.</i>

626
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,086
Well! They do not
have a ship.

627
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,089
<i>Yeah! But they could get one.</i>

628
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,329
Who has fought the pirates?
More than the natives.

629
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,881
If anyone could find a way.
It is they.

630
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,406
Just remember…

631
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,809
When we find those…
So, sweet natured locals.

632
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,202
True or not. You tell them
you are their savior.

633
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,846
Then, we will go our
separate ways. Got it?

634
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,602
Why would you want to leave?
A place like this.

635
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,126
Where will you go?

636
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,687
I do not know. Somewhere
I am a little higher up.

637
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,644
On the food chain,
for starters.

638
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,481
What was that?

639
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,490
Something a little higher up.
On the food chain.

640
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,923
That is pretty, Hook.
Do you see that?

641
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,284
<i>We got pirates trying
to shoot us down with cannons.</i>

642
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,721
<i>Nearly falling a thousand feet
to our deaths.</i>

643
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,325
Twice. Shipwrecked.

644
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,720
And, you see something
like that.

645
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,609
And, you think to yourself.

646
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,689
"Worth it."

647
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,964
Are you an orphan?

648
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,606
My mom left me. That count.

649
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,245
Well! Do you remember her?

650
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,491
I am not wasting tears missing
someone who never missed me.

651
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,245
Maybe she does.

652
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,125
<i>How can you know?</i>

653
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,240
Do you really believe?
Your mom is here.

654
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,680
Well! She left me
a note saying...

655
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,324
Well! If she left
you a note, sure.

656
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,880
Just because yours
never loved you.

657
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,921
<i>Stop.</i>

658
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,207
Does not mean my mom
never loved me.

659
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,845
Stop talking right now!

660
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,571
Did you hear that?

661
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,250
It was a deafening
nightmare shriek.

662
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,720
How can anyone
not have heard...?

663
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,121
That is a Never bird.

664
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,364
<i>And so is that.</i>

665
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,561
What are we going to do?

666
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,047
We need a plan.
We need a plan!

667
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,084
Run!

668
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,640
We will lose them
in the mist! Go!

669
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,524
Go!

670
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,330
<i>Run. Smee!</i>

671
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,370
Their faces are terrible…

672
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,761
However, their feathers
are quite lovely.

673
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,291
Shut up and run!

674
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,760
Go!

675
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,647
Smee!

676
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,040
Peter!

677
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,162
Hook? Is that you?

678
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,246
Peter.

679
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,204
Hook. They have Smee.

680
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,686
No.

681
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,325
Do not worry. Everything is…

682
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,607
Going to be all right!

683
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,408
I knew! We would
find the natives.

684
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,131
<i>We are saved.</i>

685
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,329
Please! I am ready
to go home now. Please.

686
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,042
Let me handle with this.

687
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,721
Good fair, woman.
We come in peace.

688
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,763
And, with treasure.

689
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,926
May I proudly present to you.

690
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,445
Pan!

691
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,887
Pan!

692
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,241
Pan!

693
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,801
Pan! Pan!

694
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,167
Pan!

695
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,802
Pan! Pan!

696
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,487
Pan!

697
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,126
Smee!

698
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,765
- Smee!
- What?

699
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,080
What about are they singing?

700
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,525
Search me!

701
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,690
Pan! Pan!

702
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,960
What is going on?
What is "Pan"?

703
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,487
The Pan is our tribe's
bravest warrior.

704
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,126
It is our tradition to grant
you the chance to win.

705
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,288
Your freedom before
we kill you and your friends.

706
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,084
Kill? What do
you mean: "Kill".

707
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,044
You are our sworn enemy.
You are pirates.

708
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,607
Pirates? We are not
pirates. Hold on!

709
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,642
The kid is the one.
You have been waiting.

710
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,441
Listen!

711
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,011
Your chance to live.

712
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,283
Your fiercest fighter
against ours. Our Pan.

713
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,686
<i>You win. You live.</i>

714
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,803
- You lose...
- I get the idea.

715
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,366
Bye for now.

716
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,804
Pan!

717
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,161
So, how do we know?
When we to start.

718
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,207
Whoa!

719
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,521
Whoa!

720
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,851
Whoa!

721
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,689
- Smee!
- What?

722
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,968
We have to tell them
about my mother.

723
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,083
No one cares about
your darn mother!

724
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,728
Sorry! That was a bit harsh.

725
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,766
Okay.

726
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,727
Your Highness.

727
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,769
I was hoping to
get you alone.

728
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,766
Stop!

729
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,051
The little one.

730
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,171
He wears the Pan.

731
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,008
He is a boy that can fly.

732
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,082
I have seen it.
It is terrific.

733
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,767
We call this the Memory Tree.

734
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,044
It was a time of war.

735
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,122
<i>Blackbeard destroyed
everything in pursuit...</i>

736
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,441
<i>Of the Pixum.</i>

737
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,000
<i>But then, the chief
made a pact.</i>

738
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,531
<i>With the great fairy king.</i>

739
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,291
<i>Uniting our peoples
against the pirates.</i>

740
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,761
<i>One night, the king's son,
the fairy prince…</i>

741
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,128
<i>Found his way onto
Blackbeard's ship.</i>

742
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,049
<i>Her name was Mary.
The love of Blackbeard's life.</i>

743
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,129
<i>And his most prized
possession.</i>

744
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,800
<i>Night after night,
the prince visited Mary.</i>

745
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,206
<i>But when Blackbeard
discovered them.</i>

746
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,482
<i>He flew into a jealous rage.</i>

747
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,929
<i>So, in order to save her,
the prince took human form.</i>

748
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,129
<i>But though fairies can live
many thousands of years.</i>

749
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,770
<i>In human flesh,
they can live only one day.</i>

750
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,971
<i>The prince sacrificed his life
for the girl he loved.</i>

751
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,244
<i>And, the child of that love.</i>

752
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,211
Was you.

753
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,126
<i>Our people helped your mother
hide you in the other world.</i>

754
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,760
And, they made
you this totem.

755
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,207
So, that when you returned.
We would know it was you.

756
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,806
What happened to my mother?

757
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,691
She returned to the Never wood.
And, fought for us many years.

758
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,081
And?

759
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,964
<i>The pirates. We have
winning the war.</i>

760
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,084
<i>And, the fairies had to retreat
to a hidden kingdom.</i>

761
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,691
<i>They have remained there,
in hiding.</i>

762
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,006
<i>Unknown by Blackbeard.</i>

763
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,000
<i>Until a time when they can
reemerge and fight.</i>

764
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,606
And, my mother?

765
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,003
- She is with them.
- She is alive.

766
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,327
Are you sure?
I have to go to her!

767
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,210
- Please, take me now!
<i>- No.</i>

768
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,331
You must be patient.

769
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,760
However, she is waiting for me.

770
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,885
The fairy kingdom is the
greatest secret of this land.

771
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,367
Our duty is to protect it.

772
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,284
Before we take you there…

773
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,450
You must prove us
to be Mary's son.

774
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,804
<i>The one we have been waiting.</i>

775
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,008
When the third moon rises…

776
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,285
He must fly.

777
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,881
If he lives…

778
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,966
He is the one.

779
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,721
One second.

780
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,126
And, if he dies?

781
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,725
He is an imposter.

782
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,003
<i>His death will be justified.</i>

783
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,250
Three days!

784
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,129
I have the necklace.
Is not that enough?

785
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,560
You could have stolen it.

786
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,728
However, I did not. Tell her!

787
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,485
Kid has always
had that thing.

788
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,286
How long have you known him?

789
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,891
- Three days.
- All my life.

790
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,328
The flying thing
is a stupid detail.

791
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,885
Why cannot they
just see that?

792
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,560
If you do not believe, Peter,
Then neither wills them.

793
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,042
But, if you do, they will, too.
I promise.

794
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,961
Are you whom
they think you are.

795
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,924
- I do not know.
- Hey!

796
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,884
They think you are
their messiah.

797
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,440
That you are here
to liberate them.

798
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,527
Are they right?

799
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,529
I said: I do not know!

800
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,531
Rabbits.

801
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,611
I believe.

802
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,046
I can fly!

803
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,325
If only Nibs was here.

804
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,731
He would know how to help.

805
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,561
<i>I believe.</i>

806
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,806
Have you seen Smee?

807
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,520
The things they
expect me to do.

808
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,120
I cannot do them, Hook.
I have tried.

809
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,207
- Hey! Stop. Hey!
- I cannot do the things.

810
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,640
Therefore, I cannot
be the one!

811
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,121
Listen.

812
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,600
Hook. What the
bloody hell is I.

813
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,331
You can go feeling sorry for
yourself all you want. Kid.

814
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,960
However, knowing
where you are from.

815
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,849
That is half of knowing
who you are.

816
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,040
That is more than most of us.
Here will ever know.

817
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,846
However, you said that
your mother left you.

818
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,611
Yeah. I lied.
I do that sometimes.

819
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,131
It has called being
a grown-up!

820
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,570
<i>Least you know
where you do from.</i>

821
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,842
Born to a warrior,
to a prince.

822
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,208
- Does that mean you are the one?
- I do not know.

823
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,564
<i>I do not know
if there is a "One."</i>

824
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,931
<i>But I do know.</i>

825
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,445
That if you are not
the person.

826
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,563
And, you are just you.

827
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,771
Maybe that is enough.

828
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,086
<i>Where is the boy?</i>

829
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,040
Spill the beans.
Or, I will spill your blood.

830
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,600
I will never tell.

831
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,051
He is right over there.

832
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,649
<i>Nope! Nope! Wait! My mistake.</i>

833
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,726
Sure, it is that way. No!

834
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,888
No. Right the first time.

835
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,607
Definitely, maybe definitely,
this way.

836
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,205
The point is.
We are very close.

837
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,251
Ready the ships.
Bishop kills him.

838
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,408
No! Just wait!

839
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,761
Wait!

840
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,161
You might not want to
kill me just yet.

841
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,840
For I hold the crown jewels.
You know.

842
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,040
- Information ally.
<i>- Speak.</i>

843
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,207
Sorry, a bit nervous.
You are quite intimidating.

844
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,401
Speak!

845
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,446
Now! You know the so-called
extinct fairy kingdom.

846
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,167
Speak.

847
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,891
Sorry.

848
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,884
I was just looking for you.

849
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,404
Well! You found me.

850
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,607
Do not see things
like that in the mines.

851
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,851
Kind of beautiful.

852
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,768
So, do you like sunrises?

853
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,330
What is it you think?
You are doing.

854
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,402
Well! I think it has
called flirting.

855
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,687
However, if you have to ask it.
I might be doing it wrong.

856
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,043
You are not like the men
from my tribe.

857
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,407
Thank you.

858
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,045
No. They are honest.

859
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,244
- Strong. Brave.
- Brave.

860
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,441
That what you call it?

861
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,688
Letting my little buddy
take a leap to his death.

862
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,326
When he ceases to doubt himself.
He will fly.

863
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,521
How do we know?
There are any fairies…

864
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,760
Still left on this island…

865
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,320
Or, that they will come
help fight…

866
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,560
Just because they see him fly.

867
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,681
You have to trust us.

868
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,048
Why should we?
You certainly do not trust us.

869
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,401
There is a map to
the fairy kingdom.

870
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,840
We guard it with our lives.

871
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,041
Of course there is.

872
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,607
Why would not there be a secret
map to the secret kingdom?

873
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,040
This is not a game.

874
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,720
You have seen what Blackbeard
has done to Neverland already.

875
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,960
He will reduce the rest of it
to nothing but mine pits.

876
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,491
If we do not stop him.

877
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,720
Has anybody ever told you?

878
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,120
You have really
beautiful eyes.

879
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,927
<i>Fire on the foredeck.</i>

880
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,286
<i>Prepare to come around.</i>

881
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,401
Tiger Lily!

882
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,927
You missed.

883
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,286
We must find Peter!

884
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,286
Shoot her!

885
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,444
- Peter!
- Where is Hook?

886
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,009
All of this because of you.

887
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,481
No. Kwahu, wait!

888
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,849
You are welcome.
Now! Come on!

889
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,281
Keep moving!

890
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,160
<i>Well! Well! Well.</i>

891
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,564
The princess. I presume.

892
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,240
<i>Well! Actually,
I am just a miner.</i>

893
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,846
But, I appreciate
the compliment.

894
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,286
Bishop.

895
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,886
Go on.

896
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,006
<i>Line them up.</i>

897
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,721
<i>Down here.</i>

898
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,642
All these years digging
our hands raw.

899
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,410
For tiny lumps of Pixum.

900
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,880
And, now I learn
from Mr. Smee…

901
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,168
<i>You know where there is
a mountain of the stuff.</i>

902
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,687
Nice as pie.

903
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,611
Tell me where the boy is.

904
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,531
<i>And, how to find the fairy
kingdom, and you may live.</i>

905
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:11,162
Death is the greatest
adventure.

906
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,486
Bonn voyage.

907
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,043
All hail the new Chief.

908
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,405
<i>Princess Tiger Lily.</i>

909
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,602
All hail!

910
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,925
Tell him. He will kill you.

911
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,647
He is right. You know.

912
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,721
Nice birdie.

913
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,770
- There is a map.
- Traitor.

914
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,961
<i>Do not shoot her.</i>

915
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,241
She told me there is a map
to the fairy kingdom.

916
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,521
Traitor! How dare you
betray us, pirate?

917
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,046
I am trying to save your lives.
Sweetheart.

918
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,287
It will not happen again.

919
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,090
It will not, I guarantee it.

920
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,047
Captain.

921
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,927
Go! Kid.

922
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,046
Yeah!

923
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,611
Kill them all!

924
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,766
Whoa!

925
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,045
<i>Attack. Attack!</i>

926
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,200
No!

927
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,441
<i>Can I tell you something?
Peter.</i>

928
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,643
You will never find
your mother.

929
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,371
Yes. I will find her.

930
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,324
No. You really,
really, will not.

931
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,768
You will never find your mother.
Do you know why?

932
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,446
Because I killed her.

933
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,361
<i>She died at my hand.
By this very blade.</i>

934
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,166
As you will, too.

935
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,806
Close your eyes, Peter.
And, think a happy thought.

936
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,565
Bad form. Sir!

937
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,126
We have to run. Now!

938
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,089
No. We have to jump.

939
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,967
Peter is you hurt.

940
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,561
Well! I am fine, too.
Thanks for asking.

941
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,921
Do not speak to me.

942
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,003
Because of you, everything, my
people have fought to protect…

943
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,531
- Will destroy it.
<i>- Hey...</i>

944
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,085
Because of you,
the Chief is dead.

945
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,123
- Smee was the rat.
- He was your friend.

946
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,885
- How was I supposed to know?
- You should have known.

947
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,440
- I am sorry.
- You should have known.

948
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,722
I am sorry. If I did
something, wrong!

949
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,165
Where is Peter?

950
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,481
Peter.

951
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,521
<i>You lied.</i>

952
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,683
- You all lied.
<i>- I am sorry.</i>

953
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,967
So, it is true.

954
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,450
It is complicated.

955
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,642
Is my mother alive?
Or, is not?

956
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,690
Blackbeard spoke the truth.

957
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,441
And, you lied to me.

958
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,840
Had we told you she was dead?

959
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,644
You would have walked away
from your destiny.

960
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,808
Whoever it is you think I am…

961
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,843
Whatever it is, you
expect me to be…

962
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,971
I am not.

963
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,685
And, I cannot.

964
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,891
I could not...

965
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,000
I did not want
to watch you die.

966
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,164
You should have
closed your eyes.

967
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,045
<i>Blackbeard will not
stop searching for Peter.</i>

968
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,760
<i>There is only one place
on this island.</i>

969
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,881
<i>He would not dare look.</i>

970
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,965
Mermaid Lagoon?
Sounds pretty.

971
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,369
Therefore, pirates are
afraid of mermaids.

972
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,362
Because of what we will pass
through to get there.

973
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,766
Yeah?

974
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,041
Crocodiles.

975
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,171
Afraid?

976
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,840
No. Ma'am.

977
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,082
Find the map. Keep looking.

978
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,205
Does Smee please free?

979
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,640
<i>Pull the place apart!</i>

980
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,160
- So, may Smee be free?
- No. You are too useful.

981
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,361
But, Smee has promise...

982
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,289
Smee should cease to talk of
himself in the third person.

983
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,482
- Or, Smee will be a non-person.
- Yes.

984
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,286
I found it.

985
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,769
It is a map to
the fairy kingdom.

986
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,200
Ready the ships!

987
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,885
We must get there
before Peter.

988
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,367
Grab the torches.
They are afraid of the light.

989
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,050
Did we scare them off?

990
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,770
Come on! They can fly.

991
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,810
Keep waving the torches.

992
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,521
There!

993
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,645
Peter!

994
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,646
Peter!

995
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,446
I think I see him.

996
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,971
Where?

997
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,520
- Reach for my hand!
- Help! Help!

998
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,686
Peter.

999
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,166
What happened?

1000
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,724
What are those?

1001
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,161
I do not know, but I think.
You are going to like them.

1002
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,681
You could say that again.

1003
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,761
Hey! Hey! Hey! Do not go.

1004
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,529
- I am going to check it out.
- Be careful.

1005
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,570
Who is more careful
than I am?

1006
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,884
I am sorry. I did not tell you.
What happened to your mother?

1007
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,124
However, Blackbeard did not tell
you the whole truth either.

1008
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,450
Let me show you.

1009
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,806
The mermaids charged
these waters with memories.

1010
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,931
You can see the past.

1011
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,891
Deep breath.

1012
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,121
There is no time.

1013
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,288
Blackbeard's men
nearly have us.

1014
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,366
Go to the fairy kingdom. Hide.
Keep our people safe.

1015
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,409
You should never have
come back, Mary.

1016
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,009
Yet, here you are…

1017
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,321
Ready to die for them all,
rather than live with me.

1018
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,724
No. Mary.

1019
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,570
No! No!

1020
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,762
No!

1021
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,286
She was a warrior.

1022
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:40,087
A great warrior. Her sacrifice
still inspires us.

1023
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,840
Did you know her?

1024
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,571
She trained me.

1025
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,570
Would she have been
proud of me?

1026
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,611
Yes.

1027
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,041
Very.

1028
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,968
However, what if I cannot do
what she did?

1029
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,522
What if I fail to
fulfill the prophecy?

1030
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,768
And, what if you fail
to try, Peter?

1031
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,167
What are you then?

1032
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,041
<i>Hey!</i>

1033
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,641
You have to see this.

1034
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,969
Now, the hulls a
little banged up.

1035
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,090
And, see those teeth marks?
Boy. Those crocks can jump.

1036
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,444
However, once I get her fixed up.
She is going to be in good shape.

1037
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,085
For what?

1038
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,084
To get us the hell
off this island.

1039
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,640
You are going to
run like a coward.

1040
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,241
Well! I never really thought
of it in those exact terms.

1041
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,930
However, generally
speaking. Yes.

1042
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,481
And, where will you go?

1043
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,288
Home. It is you know.

1044
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,162
Where I come from.

1045
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,480
Home is not where you come from.
It is where you make it.

1046
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,806
So, help me do that.

1047
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,924
Anyone that survived Blackbeard's
attack is in the mine by now.

1048
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,690
And, I have been in there.
I am not going back.

1049
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,365
Not for anything or anyone.

1050
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,120
Well! If you have no
reason to stay. Then go.

1051
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,761
Go now. Leave us to die.

1052
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,969
I do not want you to die.

1053
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,966
I want you to come with me.

1054
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,446
And, if I do not?

1055
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,290
Then that is your decision.
Not mine.

1056
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,361
<i>Well! Kid.</i>

1057
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,961
Looks like the old gang
is back together.

1058
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,723
Let us get this
ship in the air.

1059
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,484
Let us get one
thing straight.

1060
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,410
I am not the chosen one.

1061
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:52,042
The prophecy was not about me.
If it was never real at all.

1062
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,163
But, I am my mother's son.

1063
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:00,001
If Blackbeard is going to destroy
everything my parents died for…

1064
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,325
I will stand against him to the
last. Just like they did.

1065
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,207
Now!

1066
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,409
<i>Take me to the fairy kingdom.</i>

1067
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,131
It is just as the
Chief described it.

1068
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,927
These are words.

1069
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,087
- What language is it?
- Must be fairy.

1070
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,961
I can read.

1071
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,721
<i>I can read it.</i>

1072
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,446
What does it say?

1073
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,764
"Only the prince who bears
the key shall pass."

1074
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,921
<i>Just that.</i>

1075
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,842
Then some boring stuff about
the great fallen dead.

1076
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,410
It means we need a key.

1077
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,240
Then this was all for nothing.

1078
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,840
<i>No. I would not say that.</i>

1079
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,848
"The prince who bears the key."

1080
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,761
Do not you see, Peter?

1081
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,160
- I am the...
<i>- You are bear the key.</i>

1082
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,081
I am.

1083
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,205
You have had it all along.

1084
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,642
- She knew I would come for her.
<i>- Yes.</i>

1085
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:55,124
Mom tries to protect the kingdom
by giving your son the key.

1086
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,811
I kill Mom, but fail
to kill the son.

1087
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,809
In turn, son fails to protect the
kingdom by giving me the key.

1088
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,969
<i>Mom would be
very disappointed.</i>

1089
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,960
Would not she?

1090
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,844
Eternity beckons.

1091
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,845
I will live forever.

1092
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:03,685
Wakey! Wakey! Rise and shine!

1093
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,566
That is where we are going.

1094
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,686
The fairy hive.

1095
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,771
Destroy that, and we
destroy them all.

1096
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,201
<i>Yes!</i>

1097
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,531
Yes! Come on!

1098
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,568
Come on! Come.

1099
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,366
Yes.

1100
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,925
<i>Her name is Tinkerbell.</i>

1101
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,891
I can hear her.

1102
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,720
They have been waiting
for you, Peter.

1103
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,411
You have to get
away from here!

1104
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,971
He is going to destroy you all.

1105
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,002
I know what I have meant to do,
but, I failed.

1106
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,091
<i>I am sorry.</i>

1107
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,570
<i>I am sorry!</i>

1108
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:16,926
All right, boys,
let us burn them!

1109
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:18,446
Burn them!

1110
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,081
Bum them, burn them,
and burn them!

1111
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,524
- Burn them all!
- No!

1112
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,285
Please, I will do anything!

1113
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,120
<i>- Please!</i>
- Do not beg.

1114
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,601
Anything.

1115
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,610
No. It is bad form to beg.

1116
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,124
Where is your sense
of honor, boy?

1117
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,961
Now! Kneel.

1118
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,001
I said kneel!

1119
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,641
I am the son of a
warrior and a prince.

1120
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,405
I will never bow to you.

1121
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,805
If you are going to kill me,
then get on with it.

1122
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,207
As you wish.

1123
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,686
You do not have to do this.

1124
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,326
No.

1125
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,404
However, I really want to do.

1126
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,165
Did you miss me?

1127
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,171
Why is it always him?

1128
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,001
Jump!

1129
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,848
You came back!
I thought you did not care!

1130
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,368
As I said, sometimes I lie.

1131
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,567
Come on!

1132
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,281
I cannot let Blackbeard
get to the hive!

1133
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,211
Hard to port!

1134
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,721
Do you mind if I cut in?

1135
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,327
We have to help her!

1136
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,926
Take the wheel!

1137
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,560
You are going to get this puppy,
as close to them as you can.

1138
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,768
- Okay!
- I will jump across!

1139
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,291
Hold on!

1140
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,731
<i>Captain!</i>

1141
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:12,321
No.

1142
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,487
Peter. No!

1143
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,361
No.

1144
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,246
It is over, boy.

1145
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,241
Come.

1146
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,365
You! Grab that girl!

1147
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:44,961
Pan!

1148
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,480
I can fly!

1149
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,920
Look at me, Hook.
I am flying!

1150
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,929
All right, you do not have
to crow about it.

1151
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:57,246
Whoa!

1152
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:00,051
Crow all you want!
Just do not drop me!

1153
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,607
Go on.

1154
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,285
If we are going to beat him.

1155
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,843
We are going to
do it together.

1156
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,651
Do you hear me?

1157
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,801
Good!

1158
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,605
Now! Come on, then.

1159
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,921
<i>Fire!</i>

1160
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,206
Ready?

1161
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,326
Go!

1162
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,246
Got you!

1163
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,246
Think a happy thought.

1164
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,120
No!

1165
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,606
Boy!

1166
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,800
<i>♪ Hello. ♪</i>

1167
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,441
Peter.

1168
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,446
Peter.

1169
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:01,846
Mom?

1170
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,283
<i>You found me.</i>

1171
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,006
I have your eyes.

1172
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,723
You have my heart.

1173
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,126
I have imagined this moment
My whole life, and now...

1174
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,171
I love you, mom. So much!

1175
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,804
I do not know how you can miss,
someone you have never met.

1176
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,520
However, I have
missed you every day.

1177
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,640
Every day?

1178
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,644
Without you, I am lost again.
What do I do now?

1179
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,481
You are not lost.

1180
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,850
You are home.

1181
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,368
On this island,
with these people.

1182
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,161
Your people.

1183
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,885
Your family.

1184
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,323
You must never
give up on them.

1185
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,170
As you never gave up on me.

1186
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,041
However, mom…

1187
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,003
I do not want
to lose you again.

1188
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,010
<i>You will never lose me.</i>

1189
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,446
<i>I will always be part
of this Neverland.</i>

1190
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:57,850
And, a part of you.

1191
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,607
I love you. My son.

1192
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,726
My Peter.

1193
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,204
My Peter Pan.

1194
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,610
Peter.

1195
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,807
Peter?

1196
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,130
You thought I would
leave you here.

1197
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,363
- No. I never.
- Feel like some fun.

1198
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,920
Yes, please.

1199
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,486
All right, people.

1200
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,290
- Hold on tight.
<i>- Peter!</i>

1201
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:55,847
You do not have a rope.

1202
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,362
We have a lot to talk.

1203
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,720
I thought you were leaving.

1204
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,049
Change of heart.

1205
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,163
Will you take the
wheel, please?

1206
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,409
You do not want to go home.

1207
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,440
I am home already.

1208
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,884
<i>Is he a pirate, too?</i>

1209
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,521
No.

1210
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,361
Not yet, anyway.

1211
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,281
Which way shall we go?

1212
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:13,760
- Set a course!
- Set a course!

1213
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,086
Hey! Who is in charge here?

1214
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,406
Well! I am the captain.

1215
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,607
And, I am the chosen one.

1216
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,360
We will have plenty of time to
argue about that later. Fly boy.

1217
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,482
Suit yourself, Captain Hook.

1218
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:26,607
Set a course.

1219
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,404
Second to the right,
and, straight on until morning.

1220
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,250
<I>Neverland!</I>

1221
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,562
<I>Neverland!</I>

1222
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,922
<i>We will always be friends, Hook.
Will not we?</i>

1223
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,686
<i>Always. What could
possibly go wrong?</i>
