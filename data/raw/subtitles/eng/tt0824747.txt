1
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:09,275
Walter, honey.

2
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,007
Time to
wake up.

3
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,504
Just 10 more minutes.

4
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:14,809
Oh, I'm sorry, sport.
You can sleep in tomorrow.

5
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:16,473
That's what
Saturdays are for.

6
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:25,522
Up against the wall.

7
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:28,152
Come, come, come.

8
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:29,659
All right.

9
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:31,856
Got it. Got it.
Look, look!

10
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,331
All right, sit down.

11
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,890
Your breakfast
is getting cold.

12
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,299
It's cereal.

13
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:37,802
It's supposed to be cold.

14
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,286
Sweetheart, we're here.

15
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:03,054
Okay.

16
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,236
Here's your books.

17
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,572
Go ahead.

18
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,390
Yes, ma'am. If you hold just a moment,
I'll get a supervisor for you.

19
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,285
Yes,
she's coming right now.

20
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:10,920
Just a second,
she'll be with you.

21
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:14,899
Just one second, please. You deal
with this one. I'm not going near it.

22
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:18,871
Hello, this is the supervisor.
How can I help you?

23
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:22,138
I can see you're
on a party line...

24
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:26,310
Unfortunately, some people do
listen in on party lines. We...

25
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,006
Well, what is he doing?

26
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:32,307
Oh, my...

27
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:33,716
Everything all right?

28
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:38,349
Yes, sir, it's fine. A lady was
having trouble with the connection.

29
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,149
Hey, sport.
- Hey, Mom.

30
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:41,625
How was school?

31
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:42,923
Okay.
- Yeah?

32
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:44,964
We learned
about dinosaurs.

33
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,329
And I got in a fight
with Billy Mankowski.

34
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,458
What happened?

35
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:49,661
He hit me.

36
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:51,260
Did you hit him back?

37
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:52,635
Good.

38
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:53,968
Rule number one,
remember?

39
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,736
Never start a fight,
always finish it.

40
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,968
Why'd he hit you?

41
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:00,342
Because I hit him.

42
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,705
You hit him first?

43
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:04,240
Why?

44
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:08,886
He said my dad ran off
because he didn't like me.

45
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:11,321
Honey, your father
never met you,

46
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:13,325
so how could he
not like you?

47
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:15,190
Then why did he leave?

48
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:20,221
Well, because the day
you were born,

49
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,700
something else
arrived in the mail.

50
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,695
And it was in a box a
little bit bigger than you.

51
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:26,398
You know what was in it?

52
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,236
Something called
responsibility.

53
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,299
And to some people,

54
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:33,141
responsibility is the
scariest thing in the world.

55
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:38,578
So, he ran away because he was
scared of what was in that box?

56
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:39,676
Uh-huh.

57
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,084
That's just dumb.

58
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:42,917
That is exactly
what I thought.

59
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,067
Did I miss <i>Amos 'N Andy?</i>

60
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:59,037
I'm afraid so, sport.

61
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:00,971
Come now, time for bed.

62
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,710
Are we still going
to the movies tomorrow?

63
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:12,047
Uh-huh. I hear there's
a new Charlie Chaplin picture

64
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,916
and a new serial called
<i>The Mysterious Airman.</i>

65
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:16,382
Who's that?

66
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,424
I don't know.
Nobody does.

67
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,652
That's what makes him
so mysterious.

68
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:21,716
Oh.

69
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,222
Am I too heavy
for you to carry?

70
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:26,959
Oh, no,
not for years.

71
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,523
Not for years.

72
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,568
Hello?
<i>- This is Margaret.</i>

73
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:39,805
Hi, Margaret.

74
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,868
<i>So, how are you?</i>

75
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:42,175
Fine.

76
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:44,512
<i>Listen, Jean can't come in today
and now we're a little shorthanded.</i>

77
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:45,812
When did she call in sick?

78
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:46,943
<i>About half hour ago.</i>

79
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,681
<i>I'm having a hard time</i>
<i>trying to find someone.</i>

80
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,484
Well, what about Myrna?

81
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:51,922
I know she could use
the extra hours and...

82
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,084
<i>She's busy.</i>
<i>Can't you come?</i>

83
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,922
No. No, no, no.
I just...

84
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:02,631
I promised Walter that I'd take
him to the movies, is all, and...

85
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:04,101
<i>Well, it's just until 4:00.</i>

86
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,364
All right.

87
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,235
Just...
Just until 4:00.

88
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,305
I'll see you then.

89
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,473
There's a sandwich
and milk in the fridge,

90
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,074
and I've asked Mrs. Riley
and her daughter

91
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:20,915
to stop in
in a couple of hours.

92
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:23,148
I can take care of myself.

93
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:25,851
I know you can.
They're checking on the house, not you.

94
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:36,830
Tomorrow we will
go to the movies.

95
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:41,874
And then we'll ride Big Red to Santa
Monica and take a walk on the pier.

96
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,171
How does that sound?
Does that sound good?

97
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,544
I'll be home
before it gets dark.

98
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,510
I'm not afraid
of the dark.

99
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:53,381
I'm not afraid
of anything.

100
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:57,018
I know.
I know.

101
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:01,150
Be good.

102
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:02,885
I love you.

103
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,699
We've got lines jammed
from here to Ohio.

104
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,201
He says he needs to speak
to somebody in charge.

105
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,931
I need your signature here
for a supply requisition.

106
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,031
Number, please.
- Number, please.

107
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:51,376
Go ahead, please.

108
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,443
All right, get me
the Omaha routing station.

109
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,915
See if we can put our calls
through their switchers.

110
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,576
Let's get this
console running, now.

111
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,223
Christine. Good, I was
hoping to catch you.

112
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,686
Look, I've been following
your work reports,

113
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,957
and I just want to let you
know that I am very impressed.

114
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,465
When I first suggested
hiring female supervisors,

115
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,092
my superiors weren't
big on the idea.

116
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:19,036
But you have held your own as well
as any of your male counterparts.

117
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:20,129
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

118
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:21,730
Oh, Ben, please.
Listen, I...

119
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:22,900
Listen, the point is,

120
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,774
we're looking to take on a manager
for our new Beverly Hills office.

121
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:28,871
And if you're interested in the
job, I could write a report, or...

122
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:30,745
That would be wonderful.
Thank you so much, sir.

123
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,081
Okay, good,
so maybe we could...

124
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:34,619
Could we speak about it Monday?
- Yeah, absolutely.

125
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:37,178
Would that be all right?
Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.

126
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,560
Please!

127
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:50,464
Please.

128
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,566
Walter.

129
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,665
Honey?

130
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,007
Walter.

131
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:31,571
Walter!

132
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:33,942
Honey?

133
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,523
Walter?

134
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,164
Honey!

135
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,605
Walter!

136
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,237
Walter, it's time
to come in, honey.

137
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:12,007
Suzie?
Have you seen Walter?

138
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:14,978
No, Mrs. Collins.

139
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:16,248
Sorry.

140
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,057
Walter?

141
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:31,801
Walter.

142
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:57,190
<i>Number, please.</i>

143
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:59,288
May I please have
the police station?

144
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:00,889
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

145
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:01,956
<i>Lincoln Heights Division.</i>

146
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,832
Hello, my name is
Christine Collins.

147
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:06,428
I live at 210
North Avenue, 23.

148
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:09,407
And I'm calling
to report a missing child.

149
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:10,942
Missing child.

150
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,070
<i>What's your relation</i>
<i>to the child, ma'am?</i>

151
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:15,546
It's my son.

152
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,842
<i>How long has he been gone?</i>

153
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:20,310
I'm not sure.
I just got home from work.

154
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,816
It could be
since this morning

155
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,619
or it could be
just the last hour.

156
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,749
<i>Have you checked</i>
<i>around the neighborhood?</i>

157
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:28,555
Yes, of course I did.

158
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:30,687
<i>Well, maybe</i>
<i>he's lost track of time.</i>

159
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,025
No. No, no.

160
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:35,534
He always stays around the
house when it gets dark.

161
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:37,660
Would you please send
someone down here?

162
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,135
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but our policy is that</i>

163
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:43,164
<i>we don't dispatch units</i>
<i>on missing child cases for 24 hours.</i>

164
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,502
What?

165
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:49,036
<i>Look, 99 times out of 100,</i>
<i>the kid shows up by morning.</i>

166
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:53,016
<i>We don't have the resources to go chasing
every kid who runs off with his pals.</i>

167
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,178
No, no, no.

168
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,881
No, that's not Walter.
He doesn't do that.

169
00:12:56,956 --> 00:13:01,290
<i>With all due respect, ma'am,
every parent who calls says the same thing.</i>

170
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:04,387
Please, please.

171
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,125
<i>Look, there's</i>
<i>nothing I can do.</i>

172
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,666
<i>I'll take your name</i>
<i>and your information,</i>

173
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:10,361
<i>but that's all until the morning,</i>
<i>at the earliest.</i>

174
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:13,462
<i>I'm sure he'll show up by then.</i>
<i>They always do.</i>

175
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:43,629
Are you Mrs. Collins?

176
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:02,912
<i>Our thoughts go out
again today to Mrs. Christine Collins</i>

177
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,422
<i>of Lincoln Heights,</i>

178
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,651
<i>whose young son,</i>
<i>Walter Collins,</i>

179
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,251
<i>disappeared</i>
<i>nearly two weeks ago.</i>

180
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,787
<i>Though she is not</i>
<i>a member of our congregation,</i>

181
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:17,594
<i>we pray for her today</i>
<i>as we have every day,</i>

182
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:20,904
<i>since we learned</i>
<i>of her plight.</i>

183
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,839
<i>On the radio and</i>
<i>in the newspapers</i>

184
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,845
<i>we are told that</i>
<i>the Los Angeles Police Department</i>

185
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:31,509
<i>is doing its very best to</i>
<i>reunite mother and child,</i>

186
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,984
<i>and I'm sure</i>
<i>that that is true.</i>

187
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:40,151
<i>But given its status</i>
<i>as the most violent, corrupt</i>

188
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,194
<i>and incompetent</i>
<i>police department</i>

189
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:44,491
<i>this side</i>
<i>of the Rocky Mountains</i>

190
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:48,022
<i>I am not sure</i>
<i>it's saying a great deal.</i>

191
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,007
<i>Every day, new bodies</i>
<i>appear along Mulholland</i>

192
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:01,103
<i>and in the ditches</i>
<i>of our cities,</i>

193
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,585
<i>the work of Police Chief James Davis
and his aptly named Gun Squad.</i>

194
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:11,020
<i>Every day, the needs</i>
<i>of honest citizens</i>

195
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,322
<i>are put second to greed</i>
<i>and personal gain.</i>

196
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:21,889
<i>Every day,</i>
<i>this city sinks deeper into a cesspool</i>

197
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:26,769
<i>of fear, intimidation</i>
<i>and corruption.</i>

198
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,239
<i>Once the City of Angels,</i>

199
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:34,371
<i>Los Angeles has become</i>
<i>a place where our protectors</i>

200
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:36,938
<i>have become</i>
<i>our brutalizers.</i>

201
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:41,980
<i>Where to be the law is</i>
<i>to be above the law.</i>

202
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:31,360
I understand.
Thank you.

203
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:33,234
I will call back
in a few weeks.

204
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,570
Thank you very much.

205
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:41,143
Las Vegas Missing
Persons Department?

206
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:43,444
Hello, this is
Christine Collins.

207
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:46,383
I'm calling to see if you've
found any missing or lost children

208
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:50,320
who meet the description
that matches Walter Collins.

209
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,226
Oh, all right. Well,
please do. Please do call.

210
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:56,852
And I'll call back
in a matter...

211
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,693
In a week, if that's all right.
Thank you very much.

212
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:00,754
Thank you.

213
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,677
$2.

214
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,658
Hell, I think I left
my wallet at home.

215
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:31,629
Can I owe it to you?

216
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,126
No credit.

217
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,861
Pay up or I
call the cops.

218
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:37,766
I'm sick of bums like you
coming around here.

219
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:39,270
I'm not trying to
stiff you, chief.

220
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,829
I just left my wallet
at home, that's all.

221
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:44,876
I'll go back and get it.
Five, 10 minutes, tops.

222
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,841
Got collateral?

223
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:51,681
You can't ask for
better collateral

224
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,049
than a man's own flesh
and blood, right?

225
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:56,645
Now, you stay here, son.

226
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:58,254
I'll be right back.

227
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:00,849
But...
- Now, don't give me any trouble.

228
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,917
He's a good man to
trust us like this.

229
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:07,563
Now, you just stay here and
I'll go back and get my wallet.

230
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:13,270
Ten minutes,
then I call the cops.

231
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:24,939
Ah, hell.

232
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,513
<i>Number, please.</i>
- Hello, Myrtle?

233
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,455
<i>Hello?</i>
- Yeah, this is Harve, down at the diner.

234
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:34,584
<i>Oh, hi, Harve.</i>

235
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,820
Would you get me
Sheriff Larsen?

236
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:36,793
<i>Sure thing.</i>

237
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:40,326
You have
a nice day, too.

238
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:45,830
Christine, I'm having trouble
with the connection here.

239
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,770
I can't seem
to get through.

240
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,240
I think so.
Yeah, I think that's better.

241
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:56,615
You have a person
to person call, Fairfax 2231.

242
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:59,173
Long distance.
Sorry, can you repeat?

243
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:01,014
I'll connect you
right away, ma'am.

244
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:02,449
Thanks.

245
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:17,366
Mrs. Collins?

246
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:18,760
Yes.

247
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:22,539
I'm Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Park Juvenile Division.

248
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:27,138
My office supervises all
runaway and missing child cases,

249
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:29,078
including your son's,
and...

250
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:31,747
He's alive,
Mrs. Collins.

251
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:38,555
He was picked up two days ago by
local police in DeKalb, Illinois.

252
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:40,057
He's safe and unhurt.

253
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,556
He was in the company of some
drifter. We have an APB out for him,

254
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:46,655
but he's safe.

255
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:50,667
Thank you so much.

256
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,931
Oh, Christine...

257
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,237
That is so great.

258
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:05,275
Thank you.

259
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,926
There's
so much press.

260
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:27,003
Yours is a story with a
happy ending, Mrs. Collins.

261
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,267
People love happy endings.

262
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,705
We better get a move on,
the train's pulling in.

263
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,214
Back, boys. Back.

264
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:38,346
Thanks.
Thanks, boys, thanks!

265
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,907
I'll have a statement
for you in a few minutes,

266
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,043
but the important
thing right now

267
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,883
is to reunite this
little lady with her son,

268
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:44,320
so if you'll excuse us.

269
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,588
Stay right there.
Come on, don't rush.

270
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:51,758
Easy, easy.

271
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:56,224
Mrs. Collins, I'd like to
introduce you to James E. Davis,

272
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:57,496
Chief of Police.

273
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,559
Very nice to meet you.

274
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:00,002
We don't get a lot
of positive attention

275
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,562
from the boys in the
press these days,

276
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,131
so it's good to be here with a
positive story, don't you think?

277
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,267
Yes, sir.

278
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:09,713
I take it you've been treated
well by my boys in the department?

279
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,875
I couldn't file a
report for 24 hours,

280
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:13,213
and I thought that
maybe that was a...

281
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:14,718
Technicalities aside.

282
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:17,915
It was wonderful.

283
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,116
Well, good.

284
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,060
Then you won't have any trouble
telling that to the press,

285
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:25,062
and the fact that the LAPD...

286
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:29,426
Women.

287
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:30,661
Hold on a second.

288
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:40,335
Back, boys, back.

289
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:43,576
Keep them back.

290
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:06,060
Well, aren't you...
Aren't you gonna...

291
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:07,400
That's not my son.

292
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:11,836
What?

293
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:14,409
What are you saying?

294
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,477
It's not my son.

295
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,914
Well, I'm sure
you're mistaken.

296
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,076
I'm not mistaken.

297
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:22,780
Well, he's been through
five terrible long months.

298
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:24,982
He's lost weight,
he's changed.

299
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:26,752
I would know my own son.

300
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:29,623
All I'm saying is you're
in shock and he's changed.

301
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,158
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?

302
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:34,859
Walter Collins.

303
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,592
It's a common name.

304
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,832
Where do you live, Walter?
You know your home address?

305
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:44,137
I live at 210 Avenue 23,

306
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:46,467
Los Angeles, California.

307
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,445
And that's my mommy!

308
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:56,585
Mrs. Collins, listen
to me. I understand.

309
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,647
You're feeling a little uncertain
right now, and that's to be expected.

310
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:02,091
A boy this age,
he changes so fast.

311
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:05,096
We've compensated for that
in our investigation.

312
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:08,133
And there's no question
that this is your son.

313
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,225
That is not Walter.

314
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:14,406
It's not Walter
as you remember him.

315
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:19,105
And that's why it's important for
you to take him home on a trial basis.

316
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:22,070
A trial basis?

317
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:23,205
Yes, yes.

318
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:26,809
Once he's around his
familiar surroundings,

319
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:30,821
and you've given yourself time to recover
from the shock of his changed condition,

320
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:33,653
you will see that
this is your Walter.

321
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:36,286
Now, I promise you, I swear
to you, I give you my word.

322
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:37,988
This is your son.

323
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:41,624
Now, if you have any problems, any problems
at all, you come and you talk to me.

324
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,031
I'll take care of it.

325
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:47,035
I give you my word.
Trust me.

326
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:51,098
Mrs. Collins, he has
nowhere else to go.

327
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,075
Please.

328
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:03,211
Maybe I'm not
thinking clearly.

329
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:05,119
And...

330
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:07,718
All right.

331
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:10,318
All right, you're not
thinking clearly, that's right.

332
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:11,828
Here we go!

333
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:13,662
Thank you.
Thank you.

334
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:15,791
Here, just turn
around here.

335
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:17,930
How does it feel to have
your son home, Mrs. Collins?

336
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,994
What'd you think when you
saw him for the first time?

337
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:22,370
It's hard to explain.

338
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:24,272
She was
shocked at first.

339
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:27,312
She didn't recognize the boy,
which is perfectly natural.

340
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:28,744
He's been through
quite an ordeal.

341
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:30,281
How're you feeling, son?

342
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:31,407
Bet it feels great
to be home.

343
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:32,780
Yeah. It's great.

344
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:35,012
The Los Angeles
Police Department is thankful

345
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:38,284
for all the hard work done by the
DeKalb County Sheriff's Department

346
00:24:38,357 --> 00:24:40,985
in making this joyful
reunion possible.

347
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,755
The LAPD is dedicated to
serving the public at all times.

348
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,457
Can we get a photo with
mother and son, Captain?

349
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:48,727
Absolutely! Here we are.

350
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,561
Like that.
Like that.

351
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:53,196
Squeeze together.
There you go, boys.

352
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:55,835
This way, Walter.
- Big smile.

353
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:57,969
One more, please.
- That's a good one.

354
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:00,305
One more.

355
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,299
The sandwich all right?

356
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,303
Would you like
some more milk?

357
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:28,498
No.

358
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,137
No, thank you.

359
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:32,871
No, thank you.

360
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:43,311
You're covered in soot from the
train. You should take a bath.

361
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:57,194
Pajamas are on the
edge of the bed.

362
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,900
You okay?
You all right?

363
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:03,942
I fell. Stupid tub!

364
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,439
That's all right.

365
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:10,911
You're circumcised.

366
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:17,686
Get out.

367
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:20,218
Move.

368
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:33,228
Last time
I measured Walter,

369
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:35,569
last time
I measured my son,

370
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,700
he was inches taller
than you are now.

371
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:40,077
Who are you?

372
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,305
What are you doing here?

373
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:45,939
Who are you?

374
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,413
Who are you?

375
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,064
He's not my son.

376
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:04,193
Mrs. Collins...

377
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,396
No, I don't know why
he's saying that he is,

378
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:08,200
but he's not Walter
and there's been a mistake.

379
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,298
I thought we agreed to
give him time to adjust.

380
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,036
He's three inches shorter.

381
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:13,742
I measured him
on the chart.

382
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:15,211
Well, maybe your
measurements are off.

383
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,215
Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for all of this.

384
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:19,614
He's circumcised.

385
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:21,583
And Walter isn't.

386
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,150
Mrs. Collins.

387
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,791
Your son was missing
for five months.

388
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:34,423
For at least part of that time in the
company of an as yet unidentified drifter.

389
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:37,332
Who knows what such a disturbed
individual might have done?

390
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:41,197
He could have had him circumcised.
He could have...

391
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:42,740
Made him shorter?

392
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,044
Why aren't you
listening to me?

393
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:52,106
I am listening, damn it,
I am listening.

394
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:53,708
And I understand
your feelings.

395
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:55,912
He's changed, no
mistake, and that's...

396
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:57,615
You've both been through
a terrible experience,

397
00:27:57,689 --> 00:28:00,590
and that's why he needs your
love and support to bounce back.

398
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:02,182
He's not my son!

399
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:05,455
Why are you doing this,
Mrs. Collins?

400
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,622
Why are you doing this?

401
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:09,758
You seem perfectly capable
of taking care of the boy.

402
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:12,235
Your job pays you enough to
attend to his personal needs,

403
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:14,033
so I don't understand
why you're running away

404
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:15,903
from your responsibilities
as a mother.

405
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:18,238
I am not running away
from anything!

406
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,777
Least of all
my responsibilities!

407
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:22,439
I am even taking care
of that boy right now,

408
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:24,345
because I am all he has!

409
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,714
What worries me is that you
have stopped looking for my son!

410
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:31,279
Why should we be looking for
someone we've already found?

411
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,784
Because you have
not found him.

412
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,294
His identity
has been confirmed

413
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:40,854
by the best minds in the
field of child identification,

414
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,130
people who know
what they're doing.

415
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:44,600
And I don't?

416
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,053
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:08,049
I appreciate everything that
this department has done

418
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:10,253
and I know
how hard you're working.

419
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:13,422
I really do, and I don't
want to cause any trouble.

420
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:16,262
I just...
There has been a terrible mistake,

421
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:18,495
and I need you to
help me correct it,

422
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:23,405
so I can find my son
before it's too late.

423
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:26,803
Please.

424
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:39,517
I won't take up any more of your time.
I'm sorry I got upset.

425
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:41,525
I'm sorry, very sorry.

426
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,195
<i>Yes, Captain?</i>

427
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:57,264
Sara, get Dr. Tarr
on the phone.

428
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:58,468
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

429
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:04,806
Mrs. Collins?
- Yes?

430
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:06,510
Dr. Earl W. Tarr.

431
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:07,609
Captain Jones sent me.

432
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:10,120
I consult with him from time
to time on juvenile cases.

433
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,553
May I come in?

434
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:13,791
Yes, thank you for coming.

435
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:15,656
I was beginning to think
he didn't believe me.

436
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:19,094
Well, I'm here now,
and we'll put all that to rights.

437
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:21,923
Where's the boy?

438
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:26,694
Ah! There he is.

439
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,700
A handsome young man.

440
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:32,239
He has your eyes,
doesn't he?

441
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,540
And a little bit
of the nose.

442
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:37,941
Very fit, in spite
of all his travails.

443
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:41,315
A very resilient boy you've
got here, Mrs. Collins.

444
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:43,948
I thought you were
here to help me.

445
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:45,512
Well, I am.

446
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,026
Captain Jones said that the boy had
been through some severe physical changes

447
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:50,618
and asked me
to drop in on him

448
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:53,289
to reassure you in your
time of motherly concern.

449
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:58,759
My motherly concern is not for
him because he's not my son.

450
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:03,999
Now, statements like that will
hardly help the boy's self-esteem,

451
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:05,474
now will they?

452
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,475
Captain Jones said something
about a change in height?

453
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:11,406
Yes.

454
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,848
Come.

455
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,318
Against the wall.

456
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:22,717
He's three inches shorter.

457
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:25,258
Ah, well...

458
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:29,860
Hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins.

459
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:34,235
We've known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children.

460
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:36,467
Given the stress
of the past five months,

461
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,001
his spine may have
actually shrunk.

462
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:42,046
It's uncommon, but it's within
the realm of possibility.

463
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,081
And circumcision?

464
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:53,350
Very likely his abductor
thought it appropriate.

465
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:56,189
After all, circumcision
is hygienically sound.

466
00:31:57,596 --> 00:32:00,565
Must have been quite
traumatic at the time.

467
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,595
No wonder
he's submerged the memory.

468
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:08,062
I...

469
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:12,473
You see, there's a perfectly sound
medical explanation for all of this.

470
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,909
But it's right for you
to raise the questions.

471
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:19,007
You need to be apprised of all
changes the lad went through

472
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,143
during his absence.

473
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:24,484
Wouldn't I know whether
or not he's my son?

474
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:26,947
I'm the mother.

475
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:29,983
Which means you're in no
position to be objective.

476
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:34,958
You are looking through the
prism of extreme emotion at a boy

477
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,631
who has changed
from what you remember.

478
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:39,727
He isn't the same boy
that left here.

479
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:41,931
Just as a boy that goes
off to war and then returns

480
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:43,838
is not the same anymore.

481
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:48,572
And a mother's heart, driven
by intuition and emotion,

482
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:51,081
sees these changes
and rebels,

483
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:54,115
insists that
this isn't your son.

484
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:57,516
Doesn't change the facts.

485
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:05,592
I'm willing to put my theory to the
test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.

486
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,796
Are you?

487
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:17,200
<i>It is absolutely outrageous!</i>

488
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:20,176
Calm yourself, calm yourself
and just listen to me.

489
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:24,306
No, no, no.
No, you listen to me, please.

490
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:28,851
This so called doctor paraded
me around my own neighborhood,

491
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,253
like some kind of a derelict mother
who didn't even know her own son.

492
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:34,315
<i>And what was his findings?</i>

493
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:36,656
He found what he
expected to find,

494
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:40,330
what you obviously
told him he would find.

495
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:41,865
<i>Mrs. Collins.</i>
- But that's not...

496
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:43,594
That's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

497
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:48,162
That I was embarrassed
is not the issue.

498
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:53,277
The point is that
you are wasting time

499
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:56,508
when you should be
looking for my son.

500
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:59,641
But the report is final,
Mrs. Collins.

501
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:03,815
Well, then I want to receive
the report, so I can refute it,

502
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:05,822
before it goes
to anyone else.

503
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,118
Fine.

504
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:10,290
Yes. Good day.

505
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:21,069
I'm finished. Could I
go to my room now?

506
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:24,167
Yes.

507
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,379
Good night, Mommy.

508
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:39,119
Stop saying that!

509
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:42,651
Stop saying that!

510
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:44,827
I'm not your mother!

511
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,460
I want my son back.

512
00:34:50,535 --> 00:34:54,164
You're not him.
You're not my son!

513
00:34:57,142 --> 00:34:59,235
I want my son back.

514
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:02,670
I want my son back!

515
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:04,579
Damn you!

516
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,118
I want my son back!

517
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:43,549
I was wrong
to yell at you.

518
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:48,283
You're just a child

519
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:52,558
and I don't think you know
what you're doing,

520
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,621
and the hurt
you're causing.

521
00:35:54,699 --> 00:36:00,137
But I need you to understand
that my son is my life.

522
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,401
He's all I have.

523
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:10,742
And no matter what the police think,
and no matter what the world thinks,

524
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,147
you and I,

525
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:18,245
we both know the truth,
don't we?

526
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:22,822
We both know that
you're not Walter.

527
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:26,887
You just have to tell them
that you're not my son,

528
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:28,933
so they can find my son.

529
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:33,766
Please.

530
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:43,246
We can talk tomorrow.

531
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:06,228
Hello?

532
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:08,329
<i>Is this Mrs. Christine Collins?</i>

533
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:09,964
Yes.

534
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,633
My name is Gustav Briegleb.

535
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:15,076
I'm the pastor over at
St. Paul's Presbyterian.

536
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:18,382
Oh, yes, I've heard
your broadcasts.

537
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:19,973
I'm...

538
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:21,951
Thank you.

539
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,580
<i>Have you read</i>
<i>the</i> Times <i>this morning?</i>

540
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:25,782
No.

541
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:30,489
<i>Well, maybe you should give it a gander
and then come over here to the parish</i>

542
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:33,622
for breakfast, in, say, an hour.
I think we should meet.

543
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:37,461
Hello?

544
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:47,468
"Mysterious case of...

545
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:49,911
"Acting on the request of the
Los Angeles Police Department,

546
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:54,145
"Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child
specialist, examined Walter Collins

547
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:56,015
"to determine the cause
of his loss of weight,

548
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,749
"paleness, confusion,
and rundown condition

549
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:00,017
"noticed since the
return of the boy

550
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:02,582
"to his mother last Monday."

551
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:06,392
Lovely bit of phrasing,
isn't it?

552
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:09,490
Noticed since the return
of the boy to his mother.

553
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,331
Now, not only does that clearly
state you're the boy's mother,

554
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:16,772
but one could infer from it that you're
somehow responsible for these changes.

555
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:19,139
And that the police
department is concerned

556
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,974
for the boy's welfare
while he's in your charge.

557
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,537
You should try the eggs.
They're very nice.

558
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:28,811
"'I examined the boy quite
thoroughly,' Dr. Tarr said,

559
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:31,354
"'And it's clear that
he has something to tell.

560
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:32,821
"'I'm sure that in time..."'

561
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:37,020
...time he will give his boyish
story of the entire affair,

562
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,893
but not until he has
faith in his listener.

563
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:43,957
And that is what is lacking here,
faith in the poor lad's story.

564
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,194
Course of my examination, I found
nothing to dispute the findings

565
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:50,069
of the LAPD.

566
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,503
Why would they do this?

567
00:38:53,578 --> 00:38:56,570
To avoid admitting
they made a mistake

568
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:58,309
when they brought
back the wrong boy.

569
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:01,045
Of course, anyone reading the
newspaper with half a brain

570
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,178
would see
through it instantly.

571
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:07,247
Sadly, that would exclude about half
the readership of the <i>Times.</i>

572
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,357
Mrs. Collins, I have made it my mission
in life to bring to light all the things

573
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,991
the LAPD wish none
of us ever knew about.

574
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:22,097
A department ruled by violence, abuse,
murder, corruption and intimidation.

575
00:39:23,307 --> 00:39:26,640
When Chief Davis took over the
force two years ago, he said...

576
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:30,078
We will hold court against gunmen
in the streets of Los Angeles.

577
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:33,083
I want them brought
in dead, not alive,

578
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:36,985
and I will reprimand any officer who
shows the least mercy to a criminal.

579
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:40,524
He picked 50 of the most
violent cops on the force,

580
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:44,152
gave them machine guns and permission
to shoot anyone who got in their way.

581
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:46,719
He called them
the Gun Squad.

582
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:52,102
<i>No lawyers, no trials, no questions,
no suspensions, no investigations.</i>

583
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,035
Just piles of bodies.

584
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:59,002
<i>Bodies in the morgues, bodies in the
hospitals, bodies by the side of the road.</i>

585
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:03,480
And not because the LAPD
wanted to wipe out crime. No.

586
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:07,109
The LAPD wanted to
wipe out the competition.

587
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:09,210
Mayor Cryer and half
the force are on the take.

588
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:12,415
<i>Gambling, prostitution,</i>
<i>bootlegging, you name it.</i>

589
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,755
<i>Because once you give people the
freedom to do whatever they want,</i>

590
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:20,628
as the Lord found in the Garden
of Eden, they will do exactly that.

591
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:24,532
This police department does not
tolerate dissent, or contradiction,

592
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:27,002
or even embarrassment.

593
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:31,838
And you are in a position to
embarrass them and they do not like it.

594
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:34,776
They will do anything in
their power to discredit you.

595
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:38,441
I've seen that happen too many
times to start going blind now.

596
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:40,575
That's why I wanted
to meet you,

597
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:43,484
to let you know what
you're getting yourself into

598
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:47,012
and to help you fight it,
if you choose to.

599
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:49,491
Reverend, I appreciate
everything that you're doing

600
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,961
and everything
that you said,

601
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:55,924
but I'm not on a mission.

602
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,025
I just want my son home.

603
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:02,302
Mrs. Collins, a lot
of mothers' sons

604
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:05,536
have been sacrificed
to expediency around here.

605
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,908
Your son, unfortunately,
would not be the first.

606
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:11,346
But if you do it right,
he may very well be the last.

607
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:21,655
He had two cavities
that needed filling.

608
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,388
He put up a fight,
but I took care of it.

609
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:25,724
And?

610
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:29,460
Your son's upper front teeth were
separated by a small tissue, a diastema.

611
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:32,025
It made them sit about
an eighth of an inch apart.

612
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:34,537
The boy in that room
has no such gap.

613
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:36,869
Can that change with age? Because
that's what they're gonna say.

614
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:38,374
In some cases,
yes, it's possible.

615
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:41,741
But the tissue between Walter's
teeth prevents that from happening.

616
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:45,180
See, they can never come together
without an operation to sever the tissue,

617
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:48,946
and I can tell you right now that
he has never had such an operation.

618
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:52,389
Would you be willing to put
that officially in writing?

619
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:55,220
Pardon my language,
but hell yes.

620
00:41:56,861 --> 00:42:00,126
Sounds like the
anesthetic's wearing off.

621
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:03,565
On the other hand, maybe
I'll write that letter first.

622
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:06,694
Give the little fella
something to think about.

623
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:18,578
Well, if it is,
he's changed enormously.

624
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:20,549
Do you know who I am?

625
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:21,915
You're a teacher.

626
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:25,149
Yes, but even teachers
have names. What's mine?

627
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:27,854
I don't remember.

628
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:30,758
I know you, but I don't
remember your name.

629
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,395
Mrs. Fox.
Now, take your seat.

630
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,473
I didn't say take a seat. I said
take your seat, the one assigned you.

631
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:58,215
You must know where it is, you've
been sitting in it for over a year now.

632
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:09,992
Mrs. Collins, if that's your
son, I'll eat my yardstick.

633
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:13,468
Not only will I put it in writing, I
will testify to it in a court of law

634
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:17,268
or to the President Calvin
Coolidge himself if I have to.

635
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:19,568
Thank you.

636
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,473
I'll see you tonight
for the broadcast.

637
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:25,879
Good luck.

638
00:43:35,126 --> 00:43:36,354
Quick question, ma'am.

639
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:37,621
Quick question!

640
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:39,424
Mrs. Collins.

641
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:42,758
Hello. My name is
Christine Collins.

642
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:45,028
Good morning.
- Good morning.

643
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:49,664
On March 10th, my nine-year-old
son, Walter Collins, disappeared.

644
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,469
And a five-month investigation

645
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:55,501
led to a boy being brought to
Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.

646
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,947
They told me and all of you
that this boy was my son.

647
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:01,882
He was not my son.

648
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:03,887
The LAPD made a mistake,

649
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:07,652
and that is the reason for
the supposed transformation.

650
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:10,193
I have letters from his
teachers and his doctors

651
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:12,661
all confirming that
he is not my son.

652
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:16,860
I'm having them reprinted now, and
I'll have them for you tomorrow.

653
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:20,392
I have given the LAPD every
opportunity to admit their mistake

654
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:22,735
and renew the
search for my son.

655
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,707
Since they have
refused to do so,

656
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:27,676
it has forced me
to bring my case public.

657
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:31,442
And I hope that this now will persuade
them to finish what they started

658
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:34,177
and bring my son home to me.

659
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:35,741
Thank you very much.

660
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:50,127
Morelli!

661
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:53,101
I want you to find the
Collins woman and get her here.

662
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,400
And, Bill, bring her
in the back way.

663
00:44:55,473 --> 00:44:56,531
Yes, sir.

664
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:09,042
This way, miss.

665
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:11,145
Why are we going
in the back?

666
00:45:11,222 --> 00:45:13,986
Captain's orders. Front's
jammed with reporters.

667
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:21,625
Please, sit down, miss. Captain
Jones'll be right with you.

668
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:25,999
Hey! Anyone want to take a call
from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?

669
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:27,365
What'd they do,
lose a moose?

670
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:30,669
They need a juvenile living here
illegally deported back to Canada.

671
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:34,142
He's living with his cousin on some
ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.

672
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:35,269
You want it?
- I'll take it.

673
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:36,404
Got nothing better to do.

674
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,913
You're a prince.

675
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:41,817
Mrs. Collins.

676
00:45:41,886 --> 00:45:45,083
You can leave the boy.
She'll take care of him.

677
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:51,489
Sit.

678
00:45:52,096 --> 00:45:54,963
Oh, you've caused us quite a
bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.

679
00:45:55,032 --> 00:45:58,058
This situation has become an embarrassment
for the entire police department.

680
00:45:58,135 --> 00:45:59,659
It wasn't my intention
to embarrass anyone.

681
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:01,204
Oh, no, of course not.

682
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:04,969
You just told the papers we couldn't
tell one boy from another as a compliment

683
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:07,237
for the months we spent
working on your case.

684
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:09,677
You trying to make fools out of
us? Is that it? You enjoy this?

685
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:11,874
Of course not.

686
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:13,177
I want you to find my son.

687
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,013
You know what your
problem is, Mrs. Collins?

688
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:17,020
You're trying to shirk your
responsibilities as a mother.

689
00:46:17,088 --> 00:46:18,248
What?

690
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:20,381
You enjoyed being a
free woman, didn't you?

691
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,517
You enjoyed not having to
worry about a young son.

692
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:25,118
You could go where you
wanted, do whatever you wanted,

693
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:26,993
see anyone you wanted.

694
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:29,555
But then we found your son,
and we brought him back.

695
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,863
And now he's an
inconvenience to you.

696
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:34,734
And that's why you
cooked up this scheme,

697
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:37,638
to throw him to the state and get
the state to raise him for you.

698
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:39,471
Isn't that true?
- That is not true!

699
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:41,875
No? Well, even the boy
says he's your son.

700
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:43,243
Why would he say that?

701
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:44,975
How would he know
to do that?

702
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:47,017
I don't know.
I just know he's lying.

703
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:49,450
Oh, maybe so.
Maybe he is a liar.

704
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,784
But that's how he's
been trained, isn't it?

705
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:53,721
Lying was born
in both of you.

706
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:55,816
You're a liar and a
troublemaker and, if you ask me,

707
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:57,884
you got no business walking
the streets of Los Angeles.

708
00:46:57,962 --> 00:46:59,020
Now wait a minute.

709
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:00,961
Because either
you know you're lying,

710
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:04,762
or you're not capable of knowing if
you're lying or telling the truth.

711
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,359
So, which is it?

712
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:10,331
You a derelict mother?
Or just plain nuts?

713
00:47:10,407 --> 00:47:12,602
'Cause from where I sit,
those are the only options.

714
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,007
I'm not gonna sit
here and take this.

715
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:16,342
You want experts? You want doctors?
I have a few of my own.

716
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:17,607
Matron.

717
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:25,487
Mrs. Collins, you still insist that
the boy out there is not your son?

718
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:26,887
Yes, I do.

719
00:47:30,394 --> 00:47:31,691
Please, don't struggle.
- What?

720
00:47:31,762 --> 00:47:32,922
No!
- You'll only hurt yourself.

721
00:47:32,997 --> 00:47:34,259
What are you doing?
- Hold still.

722
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:35,889
You can't just do this.
No, you can't.

723
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:37,092
You are to convey the prisoner

724
00:47:37,168 --> 00:47:39,261
to the Los Angeles County General
Hospital Psychopathic Ward.

725
00:47:39,336 --> 00:47:40,496
What?

726
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:42,766
You are to make
the following entry.

727
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,434
Defendant states she's been
deceived by police and others,

728
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:46,999
and that we have given
her a boy and tried

729
00:47:47,077 --> 00:47:49,875
to make her think it is her
son when she says it is not.

730
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:53,041
Take her away.
- No. No, no.

731
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:55,379
Please. Please.

732
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:56,612
Come on, Mrs. Collins.

733
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:58,587
No. No.

734
00:47:58,656 --> 00:47:59,816
This way.

735
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:08,064
<i>Mrs. Collins has been known
to us since about March 10th, 1928</i>

736
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:10,930
<i>when she reported her
nine-year-old son, Walter, missing.</i>

737
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:13,663
<i>The boy was gone until August 1928.</i>
- Okay.

738
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:17,633
<i>Since his return,</i>
<i>she has complained that he is still missing</i>

739
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:20,370
<i>and has made repeated</i>
<i>requests that he be found.</i>

740
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:25,541
<i>She suffers from paranoia, delusions of
persecution and dislocation from reality.</i>

741
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,110
<i>She may be a threat</i>
<i>to herself or others.</i>

742
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:32,882
<i>We recommend that she be
conveyed to the psychopathic ward</i>

743
00:48:32,957 --> 00:48:34,652
<i>until her senses</i>
<i>can be restored.</i>

744
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:35,987
Got another code 12.

745
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,152
Name?

746
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:38,286
Collins. Christine.

747
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:39,829
No, no, no, listen,
this is a mistake.

748
00:48:39,897 --> 00:48:41,159
Certifying officer?

749
00:48:41,232 --> 00:48:43,723
Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Heights Division.

750
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:45,792
No, no, please!
Please! The police are trying to punish me...

751
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:47,962
If you keep it up, I'm gonna
have to put you in a straitjacket.

752
00:48:48,038 --> 00:48:49,300
Do you want that?

753
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:50,431
No, ma'am.

754
00:48:50,507 --> 00:48:52,907
Then behave yourself.
Code 12.

755
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:55,605
I'm not mad!

756
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:57,044
Please.

757
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:00,177
Oh, God.

758
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:01,582
All right.

759
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:08,119
No!

760
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:18,228
Stop!

761
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:26,102
Spread your legs.

762
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:27,769
What?

763
00:49:31,315 --> 00:49:32,782
Wider.

764
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,477
Oh.

765
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:48,129
I'm not sick!

766
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:55,865
Touch me! Touch me!

767
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,400
Inside. This is your room.

768
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:02,570
The doctor has left for the day.
He will see you in the morning.

769
00:50:02,646 --> 00:50:05,012
Can I... I need to speak
to somebody in authority.

770
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:06,208
Sorry.

771
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:10,947
My room!
No. No, no, no, this is my room.

772
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:12,380
Can I make
a phone call?

773
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:14,424
Phone privileges are
earned by good behavior.

774
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:18,222
You're not allowed newspapers,
magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.

775
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:19,728
This is for your own good.
- Help me!

776
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:21,389
Listen to me.

777
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:23,296
My room.

778
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:26,063
No,
this is my room.

779
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,401
Oh, God!

780
00:50:28,472 --> 00:50:29,769
My room.

781
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:34,436
No, no,
this is my room.

782
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:38,645
My room.

783
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:44,280
My room! My room!
My room!

784
00:50:44,588 --> 00:50:46,783
My room!

785
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:49,758
They said it was my room!

786
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,773
You have a problem?

787
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:07,242
Overheated, that's all.
She'll be fine in a bit.

788
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:10,069
Hey, listen, could
you give me a hand?

789
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:13,947
I'm trying to find a place called
the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.

790
00:51:15,419 --> 00:51:17,216
Northcott Ranch, huh?

791
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:23,790
Oh, yeah, yeah.

792
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:26,958
You're almost there.

793
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,557
You just... You just
follow this road west,

794
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:33,262
about two, no, three miles.

795
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:35,862
And then you take
that next right.

796
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:39,397
And you stay on that and it
will bring you right to it.

797
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:44,277
Is something going
on out there?

798
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:45,474
No.

799
00:51:45,549 --> 00:51:47,710
Just looking into
a juvenile matter.

800
00:51:48,919 --> 00:51:50,113
Thanks for your help.

801
00:51:50,187 --> 00:51:51,381
Sure.

802
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:39,462
Hello?

803
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:27,208
Hey!

804
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:29,718
Hey! Hey!

805
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:32,846
Come here!
Come here!

806
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:40,091
This is the police!

807
00:53:40,163 --> 00:53:43,326
I have a warrant for a
minor named Sanford Clark.

808
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:46,995
Open the door
or stand aside.

809
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:01,743
Hey! Stop!

810
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:06,111
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

811
00:55:06,183 --> 00:55:09,243
Stop it! Stop it or I'll push
your face through this floor!

812
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:10,377
Stop it!

813
00:55:10,454 --> 00:55:11,512
Fine!

814
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:13,989
Give me your hands.

815
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:25,228
Come on.
Sit down.

816
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,032
Jesus!

817
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:31,106
What the hell is
wrong with you, kid?

818
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:32,607
Huh?

819
00:55:32,676 --> 00:55:34,541
Don't you know assaulting
a cop is against the law?

820
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:36,806
What difference
does it make?

821
00:55:38,415 --> 00:55:41,043
We're just sending you
back to Canada, son.

822
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:43,279
It isn't the end
of the world.

823
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,148
What?

824
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:50,754
Well, you can't stay in the
U.S. as long as you want, pal.

825
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:57,057
No word from Mrs. Collins?

826
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:58,499
We haven't heard from her.

827
00:55:58,568 --> 00:56:00,763
Get on down to her house,
make sure she's all right.

828
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:02,327
And if she's not there,
check with her neighbors.

829
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:03,464
Find out what they know.

830
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,598
Absolutely.

831
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:07,735
<i>And now KGF
welcomes the Reverend Gustav Briegleb</i>

832
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:09,972
<i>of St. Paul's Presbyterian.</i>

833
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,449
This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb
of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church,

834
00:56:14,518 --> 00:56:17,385
bringing you the Lord's
word on Radio KGF.

835
00:56:17,454 --> 00:56:19,115
Good evening.

836
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:21,123
I had hoped to have
a guest with us tonight,

837
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:23,489
but apparently
she has been delayed.

838
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,519
<i>And since she cannot be here to tell you
what she told the press this afternoon,</i>

839
00:56:27,597 --> 00:56:30,225
<i>I'll have to fill in</i>
<i>as best I can.</i>

840
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,063
<i>I'm going to tell</i>
<i>you what happened</i>

841
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:36,401
<i>and I'm going to keep on telling
you every night, right here,</i>

842
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:39,533
<i>until somebody does</i>
<i>something about it.</i>

843
00:56:43,313 --> 00:56:46,407
<i>The Desert Local, train number 45,</i>

844
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:49,782
<i>will be arriving on</i>
<i>track two in five minutes.</i>

845
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,479
Hello. I'd like a
ticket to Canada.

846
00:56:52,556 --> 00:56:54,786
Alberta or Vancouver,
whatever's leaving tonight.

847
00:56:54,858 --> 00:56:56,826
I don't have anything
going that far tonight.

848
00:56:56,893 --> 00:56:59,123
The best I can do is put
you on a train to Seattle.

849
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:01,960
From there you can transfer to a
local or drive across the border.

850
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:03,431
That would be fine.

851
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,694
Roundtrip?

852
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:05,928
One way.

853
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:07,435
That'll be $15.

854
00:57:07,504 --> 00:57:08,562
Right.

855
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:13,802
There you go.

856
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:15,401
Thank you. There you go.
Enjoy your trip.

857
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:16,673
I will.

858
00:57:34,297 --> 00:57:36,322
Breakfast is half an hour.

859
00:57:40,937 --> 00:57:43,269
Please, miss, I need to
see a doctor in charge.

860
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,807
The dining room
is down the hall.

861
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:47,776
The doctor will call
for you when he's ready.

862
00:57:59,756 --> 00:58:01,951
Do you want
eggs or oatmeal?

863
00:58:03,794 --> 00:58:05,455
Okay, that's everyone
that's here.

864
00:58:05,529 --> 00:58:06,894
All right.

865
00:58:06,963 --> 00:58:08,828
You can pull the oatmeal.

866
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:10,264
Do you want
it for tomorrow?

867
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,698
You know, just dump it.
- All right.

868
00:58:11,768 --> 00:58:13,292
You should eat.

869
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:16,068
Eating is normal.

870
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:18,937
You gotta do everything
you can to look normal.

871
00:58:19,009 --> 00:58:20,476
It's the only chance
you got.

872
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:21,704
I'm not hungry.

873
00:58:21,778 --> 00:58:24,042
Barbara, you have to eat now.
- I'm not hungry.

874
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:26,639
My name's Carol Dexter.
What's yours?

875
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,250
Christine.
Christine Collins.

876
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:33,483
Now, finish it all. I know
it's hard, but you gotta try.

877
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:34,854
Oh, boy.

878
00:58:41,665 --> 00:58:43,462
I heard them talking.

879
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:45,592
You're here on code 12?

880
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:47,330
Police action.

881
00:58:47,404 --> 00:58:48,928
I mean, the doctors,
the staff, they figure

882
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,336
that if the police
brought you here,

883
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:52,432
there must be
a good reason for it.

884
00:58:52,509 --> 00:58:54,909
There isn't a good
reason for it.

885
00:58:55,412 --> 00:58:58,677
I'm perfectly sane and I
will explain that to them.

886
00:58:59,382 --> 00:59:00,440
How?

887
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:05,316
The more you try to act sane,
the crazier you start to look.

888
00:59:05,388 --> 00:59:09,222
If you smile too much, you're
delusional or you're stifling hysteria.

889
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:12,056
And if you don't smile,
you're depressed.

890
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:16,690
If you remain neutral, you're emotionally
withdrawn, potentially catatonic.

891
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,201
You've given this
a lot of thought.

892
00:59:22,272 --> 00:59:24,934
Yeah, I have.
Don't you get it?

893
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:28,175
You're a code 12,
so am I.

894
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:30,440
We're here for the
exact same reasons.

895
00:59:30,513 --> 00:59:32,640
We both pissed
off the cops.

896
00:59:33,717 --> 00:59:36,652
Now, you see, you
see that lady there?

897
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,154
She was married to a cop
who kept beating her up.

898
00:59:39,222 --> 00:59:42,248
When she tried to tell somebody
about it, he brought her here.

899
00:59:42,325 --> 00:59:43,587
I want more juice.

900
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,854
And that one?

901
00:59:44,928 --> 00:59:46,259
Put your tray
back where it belongs.

902
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:50,561
The police beat the crap out of
her brother, broke both his arms.

903
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:53,068
When she tried to
tell the papers...

904
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:56,867
And you?

905
00:59:58,074 --> 01:00:01,066
I work nights.

906
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,101
Sure.

907
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:07,313
I mean, I work nights.

908
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,177
Oh.

909
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:11,413
Yeah. In the clubs.
Downtown.

910
01:00:11,488 --> 01:00:12,546
I'm sorry.

911
01:00:12,622 --> 01:00:16,422
Yeah, well, this one client just
kept hitting me and he wouldn't stop,

912
01:00:16,493 --> 01:00:18,552
so I filed a complaint.

913
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:21,096
And it turns out
he was a cop.

914
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:23,291
Next thing I know,
I'm here.

915
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:26,059
But they can't do that.

916
01:00:26,136 --> 01:00:27,194
Are you kidding?

917
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,794
All right, one
more and then that's it.

918
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:31,340
Everybody knows
women are fragile.

919
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:34,676
I mean, they're all emotions, no logic,
there's nothing going on upstairs.

920
01:00:34,744 --> 01:00:36,336
Somebody! Help me!

921
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:39,075
Every once in a while they say
something that's a little inconvenient,

922
01:00:39,149 --> 01:00:40,707
they just go fucking nuts.

923
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:41,910
Pardon my French.

924
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:43,714
You gotta get those dishes.
- You got it.

925
01:00:43,787 --> 01:00:47,518
If we're insane, nobody
has to listen to us.

926
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:50,352
I mean, who are
you gonna believe,

927
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:53,760
some crazy woman trying to
destroy the integrity of the force,

928
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,593
or a police officer?

929
01:00:57,334 --> 01:01:00,360
Then once they get us in here, we
either shut up and we learn to behave,

930
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:02,098
or we don't go home.

931
01:01:02,172 --> 01:01:03,799
Are you all done?

932
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:07,043
Or we go home like that.

933
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:47,205
Stop. Stop it.

934
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:50,348
Stop it!
Stop it.

935
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:51,647
Please.

936
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:55,517
Clark.

937
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,049
Sanford Clark?

938
01:01:58,895 --> 01:02:00,021
Here.

939
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:03,056
Paperwork's come through.

940
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:05,567
You'll be deported back to
Canada day after tomorrow.

941
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:07,899
Police there will decide
what to do with you next.

942
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:11,270
I hope your stay here has convinced
you not to try crossing the border

943
01:02:11,341 --> 01:02:13,104
illegally in the future.

944
01:02:13,243 --> 01:02:14,335
Wait!

945
01:02:16,479 --> 01:02:19,710
I'd like to talk to the
officer who brought me in.

946
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:21,580
I'm sure he has far
more important things...

947
01:02:21,651 --> 01:02:23,949
Please. It's important.

948
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:32,455
Christine Collins.

949
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:35,191
Thank you. Mrs. Collins.

950
01:02:36,966 --> 01:02:39,696
Dr. Jonathan Steele.
Please, have a seat.

951
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:50,777
I hope your stay with us
has been comfortable so far.

952
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:52,840
Yes.

953
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:54,816
Really?

954
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:58,376
I'd think it'd
be quite difficult at first.

955
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:02,218
Yes, it was.

956
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:06,092
Of course it was very difficult,
but comfortable enough.

957
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:19,773
I see that they have...
They've taken a blood test.

958
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:22,807
The Wassermman Test.

959
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:27,009
They said it was to check for
syphilis, 'cause it affects the mind.

960
01:03:27,117 --> 01:03:30,917
The idea that someone thinks you
need to be checked for syphilis,

961
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:32,852
does that upset you?

962
01:03:32,922 --> 01:03:35,254
No, they said it was standard
procedure, so it did not.

963
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:37,725
Yes, exactly.
Standard procedure.

964
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:39,659
We have to cover
all our bases.

965
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:41,162
I can imagine

966
01:03:43,466 --> 01:03:46,128
that for some people that
would be uncomfortable,

967
01:03:46,202 --> 01:03:48,363
but I understood.

968
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:12,226
According to your file you
believe that the police substituted

969
01:04:12,328 --> 01:04:14,421
a fake boy for your son.

970
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:16,692
No, I didn't say
he was a fake boy.

971
01:04:16,766 --> 01:04:18,859
He's not my boy.

972
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:20,368
They brought home
the wrong boy.

973
01:04:20,436 --> 01:04:22,404
My son is still missing.

974
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:27,474
Well, that's strange, because
I have here a newspaper article

975
01:04:27,944 --> 01:04:33,439
with a photo of you at the train
station, welcoming home your son.

976
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,514
That is you in the
photo, isn't it?

977
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:40,112
Yes.

978
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,282
Yeah.

979
01:04:41,991 --> 01:04:43,015
Yes.

980
01:04:43,092 --> 01:04:46,027
So, at first
he was your son,

981
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,327
and now he's not your son.

982
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:53,201
Has this
been going on for a long time?

983
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:56,898
People changing, becoming
something other than what they are?

984
01:04:56,973 --> 01:04:58,838
People don't change.

985
01:04:58,908 --> 01:05:00,466
You don't think
people change?

986
01:05:00,543 --> 01:05:01,635
No, that's not...

987
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:07,545
The police, they're not
out to persecute you?

988
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:08,777
No, they're not.

989
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:09,977
No, they're not.

990
01:05:10,053 --> 01:05:13,147
The police are here
to protect you.

991
01:05:13,923 --> 01:05:15,185
Yes.

992
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:16,858
Really?

993
01:05:16,926 --> 01:05:17,984
Yes.

994
01:05:19,062 --> 01:05:23,431
Well, that's odd because
when you were admitted,

995
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:30,635
you told the head nurse that the police
were conspiring deliberately to punish you.

996
01:05:30,773 --> 01:05:35,176
So, either the head nurse and the
interns are also conspiring to punish you

997
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:37,475
or you're changing
your story.

998
01:05:43,786 --> 01:05:49,816
Do you often have trouble telling
reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?

999
01:05:52,295 --> 01:05:53,319
No.

1000
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:07,233
I'm sorry to bring you out
in this weather, Detective,

1001
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,301
but the boy has
been quite insistent.

1002
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:10,744
It's all right.

1003
01:06:10,813 --> 01:06:13,748
I'll see what he has to say
so I can go home and get dry.

1004
01:06:13,816 --> 01:06:16,444
It's raining cats, dogs,
and Democrats out there,

1005
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:18,817
so this had better
be worth it.

1006
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:20,913
You again, huh?

1007
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:28,757
We'll see.

1008
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:33,594
Well?

1009
01:06:36,439 --> 01:06:37,667
This isn't easy, okay?

1010
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:38,729
Yeah?

1011
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:42,141
Driving my ass here in the
pouring rain wasn't easy either.

1012
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:46,577
My cousin is
Gordon Northcott.

1013
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:49,243
He owns the ranch
where you found me.

1014
01:06:50,253 --> 01:06:54,246
He said I could live there in exchange
I watch the place when he's gone,

1015
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:57,285
doing chores
and stuff like that.

1016
01:06:58,828 --> 01:07:01,626
Said I could stay as
long as I wanted to.

1017
01:07:02,598 --> 01:07:05,328
I thought that meant I could
leave whenever I wanted.

1018
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:06,459
Mmm.

1019
01:07:06,536 --> 01:07:08,834
You saying that he
held you prisoner?

1020
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:10,065
Bull.

1021
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:13,006
When I got there, you were
running around free as a jaybird.

1022
01:07:13,076 --> 01:07:15,010
Could've left any
time you wanted.

1023
01:07:15,078 --> 01:07:16,102
No.

1024
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:17,941
So, what's this, huh?

1025
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:20,072
Some kind of story to cover why
you're in the country illegally?

1026
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:21,275
No, it's nothing like that.

1027
01:07:21,351 --> 01:07:22,409
'Cause I don't have
time for this, okay?

1028
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:23,645
Listen to me!
He said...

1029
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,982
What?

1030
01:07:25,054 --> 01:07:26,783
What did he say?

1031
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:30,155
He said that if I tried
to leave, he'd kill me.

1032
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:33,252
Look, you don't understand
what he's like,

1033
01:07:33,329 --> 01:07:36,662
what he... What we did,
what he made me do.

1034
01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:40,635
All right.

1035
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:43,137
Let's start at
the beginning then.

1036
01:07:46,776 --> 01:07:48,869
What'd he make you do?

1037
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,649
We killed some kids.

1038
01:07:55,718 --> 01:07:56,980
What?

1039
01:07:57,053 --> 01:08:00,648
Look, I didn't mean to, I swear.
He made me help him.

1040
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:03,317
He said if I didn't,
he'd kill me, too.

1041
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:06,089
Look, you gotta help me,
please. I'm so scared.

1042
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:09,154
I don't want to go
to hell for killing kids.

1043
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:10,597
Look.

1044
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,499
What kids? What... What
are you talking about?

1045
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:16,094
I don't know.
I never knew their names.

1046
01:08:16,172 --> 01:08:17,662
Names?

1047
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:18,764
How many?

1048
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:20,331
How many kids?

1049
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:21,775
All together?

1050
01:08:26,182 --> 01:08:28,047
About 20, I guess.

1051
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:30,818
No, you're lying.

1052
01:08:30,887 --> 01:08:33,253
No! It's true, I swear!

1053
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:34,983
You're gonna tell me
you killed 20 kids?

1054
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:38,515
Yeah! Thereabouts.

1055
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:43,263
I stopped counting
after a while.

1056
01:08:47,103 --> 01:08:50,869
Gordon said maybe one
or two may have escaped.

1057
01:08:54,577 --> 01:08:55,601
But...

1058
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:56,702
No.

1059
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:59,612
Nobody can just up
and kill 20 kids, okay?

1060
01:08:59,682 --> 01:09:00,876
We did.

1061
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:04,480
We did.

1062
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:08,448
How?

1063
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,926
Most times we'd just
have one or two.

1064
01:09:14,564 --> 01:09:16,498
Sometimes as many as three.

1065
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:22,299
<i>I always knew when we</i>
<i>were getting ready to leave.</i>

1066
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,469
<i>Clean up the car.</i>

1067
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,740
<i>Make sure the tires</i>
<i>were good.</i>

1068
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,477
<i>Check the engine.</i>

1069
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:37,642
<i>'Cause he was afraid that</i>
<i>the car would break down</i>

1070
01:09:39,322 --> 01:09:41,187
<i>and we'd get caught.</i>

1071
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:45,089
<i>My loving baby</i>

1072
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:48,255
We'd always go a different
direction every time.

1073
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:52,499
Never hit the same
part of town twice.

1074
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:56,003
<i>Sometimes we'd just</i>
<i>drive around for hours,</i>

1075
01:09:56,639 --> 01:09:58,106
<i>till we found somebody.</i>

1076
01:09:58,174 --> 01:09:59,698
Well, there you are!

1077
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:01,572
We've been looking
for you like mad.

1078
01:10:01,644 --> 01:10:02,906
You have?

1079
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:04,344
Sure thing.

1080
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:07,348
Listen, your folks,
they've been in an accident.

1081
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:10,448
And they sent us to come find
you. Now, they're hurt real bad.

1082
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,284
The police took them to the hospital, but
they didn't have time to come find you,

1083
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:15,347
so we said that
we would do it.

1084
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,024
Now, come on.

1085
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:19,653
All right.
Get in here. Hurry.

1086
01:10:19,729 --> 01:10:23,062
Listen, we gotta get you to that
hospital so you can see your folks.

1087
01:10:23,132 --> 01:10:26,363
<i>See, a lot of kids won't
get in a car alone with a stranger,</i>

1088
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:27,766
<i>but when he's got</i>
<i>a kid there...</i>

1089
01:10:27,837 --> 01:10:29,464
There's a good boy.

1090
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:30,938
Scoot over.
Scoot over, San.

1091
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:32,565
<i>... that made it easier.</i>

1092
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:34,109
I want you to hold on tight.

1093
01:10:34,176 --> 01:10:35,473
<i>They'd look</i>
<i>at me and say...</i>

1094
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:36,807
We've got a long way to go.

1095
01:10:36,879 --> 01:10:38,039
<i>"Hey, if he's safe..."</i>

1096
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:39,274
And we are gonna fly.

1097
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:41,612
<i>"...I guess</i>
<i>I will be, too. "

1098
01:10:43,586 --> 01:10:46,077
Every time they got
in the truck,

1099
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,882
I just wanted to die.

1100
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:53,690
As soon as we got back to the
ranch, they went in the coop.

1101
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,562
You boys hungry?

1102
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:57,724
Huh?

1103
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,631
Watch the door, Sanford!

1104
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:01,703
Hey! Watch the door!

1105
01:11:02,605 --> 01:11:04,038
What's the matter?

1106
01:11:04,106 --> 01:11:05,368
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1107
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:06,931
Are you worried that
I'm gonna hurt you?

1108
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:08,101
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1109
01:11:08,177 --> 01:11:09,644
Huh? Come here.

1110
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:11,703
No! No! No! No! Please!
- I would never hurt you.

1111
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:14,443
Some days
he'd do them right off.

1112
01:11:15,918 --> 01:11:19,285
Other days he'd wait,

1113
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:22,988
pick up a few more,

1114
01:11:23,059 --> 01:11:26,085
until he had about
four or five of them.

1115
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:27,788
Yeah.

1116
01:11:27,863 --> 01:11:29,194
No! No! No!
- No what?

1117
01:11:29,265 --> 01:11:30,357
No what, huh?

1118
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:32,929
Come on. Come on. Come on!

1119
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:34,936
Sanford, keep your
eye on that door!

1120
01:11:35,004 --> 01:11:37,768
No! Please, no! No! No!

1121
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,207
No! No! No! No!
Please! No! No!

1122
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:46,173
He'd... He'd
sometimes leave

1123
01:11:46,248 --> 01:11:50,582
just one or two of them
alive, barely, anyway.

1124
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,881
He'd say,

1125
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:54,752
"Finish them, San.

1126
01:11:54,824 --> 01:11:58,123
"Finish them or... Finish
them or I'll finish you."

1127
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:02,261
And I did.

1128
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:05,794
And I killed them.

1129
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:07,096
And I did.

1130
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:08,727
I killed them.

1131
01:12:08,804 --> 01:12:10,704
Oh, God, I killed them!

1132
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:14,209
Oh, God! Oh!

1133
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:16,468
Hey.

1134
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:17,569
Hey.

1135
01:12:17,647 --> 01:12:18,739
What?

1136
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:20,179
Look at me.

1137
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:23,116
These kids.

1138
01:12:23,586 --> 01:12:28,523
You think if you saw them again, you
think you might be able to recognize them?

1139
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:30,985
I don't know.

1140
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,220
Maybe.

1141
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:35,696
Hey, I haven't updated
these in a while, but still.

1142
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:38,602
Just...

1143
01:12:39,178 --> 01:12:42,409
It should be. Just go
through these, okay?

1144
01:12:47,286 --> 01:12:51,620
If you see any you recognize, just
put them down on the table here.

1145
01:13:30,763 --> 01:13:32,060
I'm sorry!

1146
01:13:38,237 --> 01:13:39,363
Oh, my God.

1147
01:13:39,438 --> 01:13:41,963
I didn't mean to...
He made me.

1148
01:13:49,115 --> 01:13:50,377
Oh, shit.

1149
01:13:53,386 --> 01:13:55,820
This one. Look at me.

1150
01:13:58,691 --> 01:13:59,919
You're sure?

1151
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:05,492
I'm sure.

1152
01:14:09,402 --> 01:14:10,460
Jesus Christ.

1153
01:14:10,536 --> 01:14:14,768
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

1154
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,507
Jesus Christ.

1155
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:19,309
Son of a bitch.

1156
01:14:22,515 --> 01:14:23,743
Oh, God.

1157
01:14:25,851 --> 01:14:26,749
Well, he's lying.

1158
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:28,844
Have you gone soft
in the head, Les?

1159
01:14:28,921 --> 01:14:29,979
Twenty kids, sir.

1160
01:14:30,055 --> 01:14:31,044
<i>He's playing you.</i>

1161
01:14:31,123 --> 01:14:33,853
He knows he's in trouble, so he's
come up with some cock and bull story

1162
01:14:33,926 --> 01:14:35,894
about how he was forced
to stay in the country.

1163
01:14:35,995 --> 01:14:38,930
With all due respect, sir, I
don't think so. You didn't see him.

1164
01:14:38,998 --> 01:14:40,989
This kid, he's scared
half out of his mind.

1165
01:14:41,066 --> 01:14:44,194
He picked the Collins kid.
We found him, remember?

1166
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:45,567
Haven't you been
reading the papers?

1167
01:14:46,806 --> 01:14:48,501
Or maybe you have,
is that it?

1168
01:14:48,574 --> 01:14:49,666
<i>Sir, if you'd just</i>
<i>listen to me...</i>

1169
01:14:49,742 --> 01:14:51,175
I'm sorry, Captain,
but he's here again.

1170
01:14:51,243 --> 01:14:53,040
Who?
- That Reverend Briegleb.

1171
01:14:53,112 --> 01:14:54,943
He's asking about
Christine Collins.

1172
01:14:55,014 --> 01:14:56,038
Well, you tell that
son of a bitch

1173
01:14:56,115 --> 01:14:57,673
to get the hell off
of police property,

1174
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,718
or I'll have him arrested
for disturbing the peace.

1175
01:14:59,785 --> 01:15:02,845
I tried. He said he won't
leave, him or his friends.

1176
01:15:02,922 --> 01:15:04,048
What?

1177
01:15:06,358 --> 01:15:07,985
Oh, what the hell!

1178
01:15:09,728 --> 01:15:11,286
Jesus!

1179
01:15:15,468 --> 01:15:17,060
Oh, Jesus jumped down.

1180
01:15:17,937 --> 01:15:19,234
<i>Captain?</i>

1181
01:15:19,772 --> 01:15:20,761
Ybarra?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1182
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,434
Listen to me. You're to do
nothing except get back here.

1183
01:15:23,509 --> 01:15:25,443
<i>Sir, departmental</i>
<i>policy requires that</i>

1184
01:15:25,511 --> 01:15:28,105
all allegations of homicide
have to be investigated.

1185
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,272
These are kids,
for Christ sake.

1186
01:15:29,348 --> 01:15:30,940
Departmental policy
is what I say it is.

1187
01:15:31,016 --> 01:15:34,281
Now, I'm ordering you to get your ass
back here with that kid, you got that?

1188
01:15:34,353 --> 01:15:37,254
You don't talk to anybody and
you bring me that kid. You got it?

1189
01:15:37,323 --> 01:15:38,483
Nobody!

1190
01:15:52,004 --> 01:15:53,995
Captain Jones.
- Boys.

1191
01:15:54,073 --> 01:15:56,507
What the hell have you done
with Christine Collins?

1192
01:15:56,575 --> 01:15:58,770
And don't try and lie
your way out of it,

1193
01:15:58,844 --> 01:16:03,338
because several of her neighbors saw
her being driven away in a police car.

1194
01:16:03,649 --> 01:16:06,015
Mrs. Collins has been placed
in protective custody

1195
01:16:06,085 --> 01:16:08,053
following a mental breakdown.

1196
01:16:09,555 --> 01:16:10,783
A what?

1197
01:16:11,223 --> 01:16:13,657
She's getting the best
treatment available.

1198
01:16:13,726 --> 01:16:15,523
And that will be all.

1199
01:16:18,998 --> 01:16:20,431
Next.

1200
01:16:20,499 --> 01:16:21,830
Go on. Move up.
- For what?

1201
01:16:21,901 --> 01:16:22,890
Medication.

1202
01:16:22,968 --> 01:16:25,027
Medication for what?
- The kind that's good for you.

1203
01:16:25,104 --> 01:16:26,230
Help you relax.

1204
01:16:26,305 --> 01:16:27,363
Well, I don't want to relax.
- Come on.

1205
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:28,804
I'm not gonna take something...
- We can force-feed you

1206
01:16:28,874 --> 01:16:30,273
if that's what you want.
- I don't know what it is!

1207
01:16:30,342 --> 01:16:31,809
I don't know what it is. Dr. Steele?
- Take it. Orderly.

1208
01:16:31,877 --> 01:16:32,866
Dr. Steele?

1209
01:16:32,945 --> 01:16:33,912
I understand. Come on.

1210
01:16:33,979 --> 01:16:35,913
Ladies, keep moving.
Come on.

1211
01:16:35,981 --> 01:16:37,608
I don't wanna take anything
that I don't know what it is.

1212
01:16:37,683 --> 01:16:39,913
There's nothing wrong with
me that I need medication.

1213
01:16:39,985 --> 01:16:42,385
There's nothing
wrong with you.

1214
01:16:44,189 --> 01:16:46,555
No, there's nothing wrong.
No.

1215
01:16:47,293 --> 01:16:48,783
You're fine.
- Yes, I am.

1216
01:16:48,894 --> 01:16:54,298
Well, then you shouldn't
have any trouble signing this.

1217
01:16:55,901 --> 01:16:58,392
By signing it, you certify
that you were wrong

1218
01:16:58,504 --> 01:17:01,337
when you stated the boy returned to
you by the police was not your son.

1219
01:17:01,407 --> 01:17:03,841
It further stipulates
that the police were right

1220
01:17:03,909 --> 01:17:05,843
in sending you here for
observation and it absolves them

1221
01:17:05,911 --> 01:17:08,277
of all responsibility.
Sign it.

1222
01:17:08,347 --> 01:17:10,076
I won't sign that.

1223
01:17:11,116 --> 01:17:12,310
I won't sign that.

1224
01:17:12,384 --> 01:17:15,251
Well, then your condition
is not improved.

1225
01:17:15,321 --> 01:17:19,223
Sign it, and you can be out of
here first thing tomorrow morning.

1226
01:17:20,859 --> 01:17:22,554
But I wasn't wrong.

1227
01:17:22,628 --> 01:17:24,562
He's not my son.
My son is still missing.

1228
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:27,326
Mrs. Collins,
you're becoming agitated.

1229
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:31,460
Yes, I'm, yes... I'm not signing
that, because he's not my son!

1230
01:17:31,537 --> 01:17:32,561
Orderly!

1231
01:17:32,638 --> 01:17:34,037
He's not my son!
- Orderly!

1232
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:35,505
My son is missing!

1233
01:17:35,574 --> 01:17:38,065
The patient is becoming hysterical!
- No! My son is missing!

1234
01:17:38,143 --> 01:17:39,405
See to it she is
sedated properly.

1235
01:17:39,478 --> 01:17:41,469
Get her out of here.
- No! No! No!

1236
01:17:41,547 --> 01:17:42,946
Next!
- No!

1237
01:17:43,315 --> 01:17:45,476
No, no!
- Orderly, hold on.

1238
01:17:49,088 --> 01:17:50,180
Stop it!

1239
01:17:50,255 --> 01:17:52,849
No!
- Open your mouth. Open, open your mouth.

1240
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:54,516
Easy!
- You got her?

1241
01:17:54,593 --> 01:17:56,151
God!
- Swallow it.

1242
01:17:56,228 --> 01:17:57,695
Stop it!

1243
01:17:59,331 --> 01:18:00,423
Move back.

1244
01:18:00,499 --> 01:18:01,932
You!
- Get her out of here!

1245
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:03,263
Come on, you got her?

1246
01:18:03,335 --> 01:18:05,735
Stay out of this! This is none of
your business! This is police business!

1247
01:18:05,804 --> 01:18:08,364
All of you! You'll stay out of it
if you know what's good for you!

1248
01:18:08,474 --> 01:18:10,704
You'd think you were in enough
trouble with the law already,

1249
01:18:10,776 --> 01:18:12,175
being a whore,
wouldn't you?

1250
01:18:14,747 --> 01:18:17,648
Attacking a staff member.
Room 18.

1251
01:18:17,716 --> 01:18:21,243
No, no! Stop it! No!

1252
01:18:21,553 --> 01:18:23,487
No! No!

1253
01:18:24,823 --> 01:18:26,415
No! Stop it!

1254
01:19:39,098 --> 01:19:40,690
Come on, kid.

1255
01:20:00,419 --> 01:20:04,253
I don't know. I'm not sure.
I think so. He was pretty close.

1256
01:20:04,323 --> 01:20:05,620
Excuse me.

1257
01:20:06,391 --> 01:20:08,291
It's all right, I can take it from here.
- But I got...

1258
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,384
We need him
for questioning.

1259
01:20:09,461 --> 01:20:10,519
Like I said, it was dark.

1260
01:20:10,596 --> 01:20:11,858
Thanks. Come on.

1261
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:14,030
Brady, Ross.

1262
01:20:14,099 --> 01:20:16,192
You've just been requisitioned for
backup. I'll explain on the way.

1263
01:20:16,268 --> 01:20:17,792
Yes, sir.

1264
01:20:25,077 --> 01:20:29,013
I'm not sure. She said she'd had
the croup before. This could be pneumonia.

1265
01:20:31,683 --> 01:20:34,117
I keep telling her
that, and she doesn't want to.

1266
01:20:34,253 --> 01:20:35,618
You have to insist.

1267
01:20:35,687 --> 01:20:37,154
You shouldn't
have done that.

1268
01:20:37,222 --> 01:20:38,587
Please, let me out!
- Get in there!

1269
01:20:38,657 --> 01:20:39,988
Wanted to.

1270
01:20:40,592 --> 01:20:41,923
Felt good.

1271
01:20:42,094 --> 01:20:43,686
Let me out! No! Please! No!
- You got her?

1272
01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:49,599
I lost two babies
to back alley doctors.

1273
01:20:50,669 --> 01:20:52,000
No choice.

1274
01:20:55,374 --> 01:20:58,172
Never had the chance
to fight for them.

1275
01:20:59,478 --> 01:21:00,775
You do.

1276
01:21:01,313 --> 01:21:02,678
Don't stop.

1277
01:21:04,283 --> 01:21:05,511
I won't.

1278
01:21:10,556 --> 01:21:13,855
Fuck them and the horse
they rode in on.

1279
01:21:16,829 --> 01:21:19,093
That's not exactly
language for a lady.

1280
01:21:20,132 --> 01:21:21,224
Hell.

1281
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:26,001
There are times that's exactly
the right language to use.

1282
01:21:27,406 --> 01:21:28,498
Yeah?

1283
01:21:30,075 --> 01:21:32,600
When you've got
nothing left to lose.

1284
01:21:33,278 --> 01:21:35,508
You're not supposed
to be here!

1285
01:21:35,614 --> 01:21:37,275
Mmm. Mmm.

1286
01:21:59,638 --> 01:22:03,199
Stay there. Check the
house. Check the barn.

1287
01:22:12,885 --> 01:22:14,648
It's all clear.

1288
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:16,584
Clear here.

1289
01:22:16,655 --> 01:22:18,589
Bring me that shovel.

1290
01:22:22,327 --> 01:22:24,659
All right. Let's go.

1291
01:22:29,968 --> 01:22:31,196
Come on.

1292
01:22:34,373 --> 01:22:36,568
You're gonna show me.

1293
01:22:42,381 --> 01:22:44,076
Come on. Show me.

1294
01:23:05,203 --> 01:23:06,431
This it?

1295
01:23:07,973 --> 01:23:09,270
You sure?

1296
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:10,433
Yeah.

1297
01:23:13,378 --> 01:23:14,436
Dig.

1298
01:23:17,282 --> 01:23:21,218
You put them in the ground, you
can take them out of the ground.

1299
01:23:22,154 --> 01:23:23,951
Go on. Dig.

1300
01:23:24,856 --> 01:23:27,017
You heard me. Dig.

1301
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:13,601
My God.

1302
01:24:15,807 --> 01:24:17,274
Oh, my God.

1303
01:24:30,822 --> 01:24:32,187
Call it in.

1304
01:24:32,724 --> 01:24:33,816
Get the coroner
and every officer

1305
01:24:33,892 --> 01:24:36,087
in a 20-mile radius here
inside the hour.

1306
01:24:36,161 --> 01:24:39,460
Then put out an APB on
Gordon Stewart Northcott.

1307
01:24:40,599 --> 01:24:43,124
The information's
in my car. Go on.

1308
01:24:48,707 --> 01:24:50,368
You can stop, son.

1309
01:24:55,347 --> 01:24:57,212
You can stop now.
It's over.

1310
01:24:57,282 --> 01:24:58,544
Hey.

1311
01:24:58,617 --> 01:25:02,849
We'll take it, we can take it
from here. We can take it from...

1312
01:25:08,193 --> 01:25:11,651
We can take it from
here, okay? It's over.

1313
01:25:17,369 --> 01:25:19,030
It's okay.

1314
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,335
It's okay. It's okay.

1315
01:25:23,942 --> 01:25:25,239
It's all over.

1316
01:25:25,677 --> 01:25:26,769
Okay?

1317
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,006
File.

1318
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:36,944
Privacy, please.

1319
01:25:42,694 --> 01:25:46,152
I see that you've been refusing
medication, requiring force feeding.

1320
01:25:46,498 --> 01:25:48,466
All right, Michael.
Lunchtime?

1321
01:25:48,533 --> 01:25:51,627
Six days, Mrs. Collins,
and no progress.

1322
01:25:52,437 --> 01:25:55,964
We may have to move on to
more strenuous therapies.

1323
01:25:57,075 --> 01:26:00,704
Unless you're willing to
prove that you're doing better

1324
01:26:02,147 --> 01:26:03,876
by signing this.

1325
01:26:06,952 --> 01:26:09,785
Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on.

1326
01:26:14,192 --> 01:26:15,716
Room 18.

1327
01:26:24,069 --> 01:26:27,197
I want to talk to somebody
in charge, right now!

1328
01:26:27,272 --> 01:26:28,534
Please.

1329
01:26:28,607 --> 01:26:30,632
Who is in charge here?

1330
01:26:32,844 --> 01:26:34,004
Open.

1331
01:26:34,579 --> 01:26:35,876
I'm the head doctor on duty.

1332
01:26:35,947 --> 01:26:38,211
You're the doctor who
locked up Christine Collins?

1333
01:26:38,283 --> 01:26:39,409
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

1334
01:26:39,484 --> 01:26:41,008
We don't discuss cases with
anyone other than family.

1335
01:26:41,086 --> 01:26:43,680
Oh, you'll damn well
discuss this one. Read it.

1336
01:26:43,755 --> 01:26:44,779
Sir.

1337
01:26:44,856 --> 01:26:46,084
Read it.

1338
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:52,988
Stop.

1339
01:27:01,506 --> 01:27:02,871
Mrs. Collins,
one last time.

1340
01:27:02,941 --> 01:27:06,468
Are you or are you not
prepared to sign that letter?

1341
01:27:06,545 --> 01:27:07,773
No.

1342
01:27:11,983 --> 01:27:13,541
You're free to leave.

1343
01:27:16,955 --> 01:27:18,047
What?

1344
01:27:18,423 --> 01:27:21,915
Your clothes are in the next
room. You can change there.

1345
01:27:22,661 --> 01:27:23,685
In the next room?

1346
01:27:23,762 --> 01:27:25,389
Yes. That's right.

1347
01:27:26,431 --> 01:27:27,728
See to it.

1348
01:27:32,771 --> 01:27:33,931
Christ.

1349
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:35,463
Long as it's not the original.

1350
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:36,598
No, it's not.

1351
01:27:36,675 --> 01:27:38,074
Here it is.

1352
01:27:38,143 --> 01:27:39,974
And who is that? Is
that Baker's file or Larson?

1353
01:27:40,045 --> 01:27:41,273
That's Baker.

1354
01:27:41,346 --> 01:27:43,211
He said he wanted...

1355
01:27:43,281 --> 01:27:44,680
Nurse, I wanna see

1356
01:27:44,749 --> 01:27:47,877
every piece of paper you have on
the case of Mrs. Christine Collins,

1357
01:27:47,953 --> 01:27:49,944
and I want to see it right
now, do you understand me?

1358
01:27:50,021 --> 01:27:52,649
Every piece. When
will she be coming out?

1359
01:27:53,692 --> 01:27:54,716
Oh, it's just up ahead.

1360
01:27:54,793 --> 01:27:56,090
Oh, all right.
Let's...

1361
01:27:56,161 --> 01:27:58,391
Hurricane hits
West Palm Beach!

1362
01:27:58,463 --> 01:28:00,931
Babe Ruth hits
53rd home run!

1363
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,891
Kids found murdered in Riverside!
- There it is.

1364
01:28:03,969 --> 01:28:06,836
Biggest crime
in Los Angeles history!

1365
01:28:06,905 --> 01:28:08,964
Collins boy assumed dead!

1366
01:28:10,175 --> 01:28:12,666
Read it here!
Read it here!

1367
01:28:17,983 --> 01:28:20,076
Mrs. Collins,
I'm so sorry.

1368
01:28:24,522 --> 01:28:26,786
Captain, your handling of
the Christine Collins case

1369
01:28:26,858 --> 01:28:29,918
has exposed this department
to public ridicule.

1370
01:28:30,528 --> 01:28:34,328
There is even the possibility
of civil and criminal liability.

1371
01:28:34,799 --> 01:28:37,666
Sir, nobody could've known what
was happening up at that ranch.

1372
01:28:37,736 --> 01:28:40,796
Not us, the sheriff's department,
or the marshal's office.

1373
01:28:40,872 --> 01:28:42,965
And as for the
Collins woman,

1374
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:45,805
I'm still not convinced that her boy
is among the victims up in Wineville.

1375
01:28:45,944 --> 01:28:47,036
No?

1376
01:28:47,112 --> 01:28:48,079
No.

1377
01:28:48,146 --> 01:28:51,638
There were four other photos of
missing boys that looked a lot like him.

1378
01:28:51,716 --> 01:28:53,650
The Clark kid
could've been mistaken.

1379
01:28:53,718 --> 01:28:55,049
Maybe he was.

1380
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:58,351
Which begs the obvious
question. Who cares?

1381
01:28:59,758 --> 01:29:00,850
Sir?

1382
01:29:01,092 --> 01:29:03,287
The mayor wants
this to go away.

1383
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:05,454
I want this to go away.

1384
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:09,022
The way you do that is to stop
insisting that Walter Collins

1385
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:11,625
is not among those boys killed
up at that goddamn ranch.

1386
01:29:11,703 --> 01:29:14,263
Because if the boy you brought
back is not Walter Collins,

1387
01:29:14,339 --> 01:29:17,331
and he's not dead up at that
ranch, then where the hell is he?

1388
01:29:17,409 --> 01:29:19,104
People are gonna want to
know why we haven't found him.

1389
01:29:19,177 --> 01:29:21,441
Why we're not
doing our job.

1390
01:29:22,147 --> 01:29:24,240
But if, on the other hand,

1391
01:29:24,316 --> 01:29:28,582
he is, or could be, among those
poor boys killed up in Wineville,

1392
01:29:29,054 --> 01:29:31,386
then the inquiries stop.

1393
01:29:33,124 --> 01:29:34,682
It's a momentary
embarrassment

1394
01:29:34,759 --> 01:29:36,886
you're just gonna
have to live with.

1395
01:29:36,961 --> 01:29:38,428
Better a short
inconvenience

1396
01:29:38,496 --> 01:29:41,659
than a lingering problem,
wouldn't you say, Captain?

1397
01:29:41,733 --> 01:29:42,893
Yes, sir.

1398
01:29:42,967 --> 01:29:44,832
The boy's been gone
nearly a year.

1399
01:29:44,903 --> 01:29:48,066
If he was going to be found,
it would've happened by now.

1400
01:29:48,139 --> 01:29:49,504
Whether he was up
at that ranch or not,

1401
01:29:49,574 --> 01:29:51,769
the truth is he probably
is dead somewhere.

1402
01:29:51,843 --> 01:29:55,904
Better his mother accept that
now than later, don't you think?

1403
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,971
Yes, sir.
- Good.

1404
01:29:58,049 --> 01:29:59,676
That'll be all, Captain.

1405
01:30:01,386 --> 01:30:05,049
That's how you want it,
then I guess we're done here.

1406
01:30:05,256 --> 01:30:06,917
Tell county jail we're
remanding him for trial.

1407
01:30:06,991 --> 01:30:10,859
Wait. I didn't do anything. I
wasn't even here when it happened.

1408
01:30:12,063 --> 01:30:13,394
By pretending to
be Walter Collins,

1409
01:30:13,465 --> 01:30:16,957
you're interfering in a police
investigation of a kidnapping and murder.

1410
01:30:17,035 --> 01:30:20,027
We can try you as accomplice
to that murder after the fact.

1411
01:30:20,105 --> 01:30:21,538
That's too bad.

1412
01:30:21,606 --> 01:30:25,337
County jail is a lot worse than
a juvenile hall or a foster home.

1413
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:26,809
It's a lot worse.

1414
01:30:28,813 --> 01:30:31,304
You can't do that.
I'm just a kid.

1415
01:30:33,818 --> 01:30:35,843
Sanford Clark's a kid, too.

1416
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,388
Fifteen.
He's going to jail.

1417
01:30:38,456 --> 01:30:42,654
All murderers and their accomplices
go to jail. Everybody knows that.

1418
01:30:44,829 --> 01:30:47,559
Get him out of here.
It's out of my hands now.

1419
01:30:47,632 --> 01:30:50,157
Wait. I don't
want to go to jail.

1420
01:31:00,412 --> 01:31:01,674
Prove it.

1421
01:31:03,348 --> 01:31:04,645
I...

1422
01:31:04,783 --> 01:31:08,310
I knew Los Angeles is where
they make the Tom Mix movies.

1423
01:31:08,987 --> 01:31:10,887
I figured
if I could meet Tom Mix

1424
01:31:10,955 --> 01:31:13,651
maybe he would let me
ride on his horse.

1425
01:31:15,193 --> 01:31:17,753
His horse is named Tony.
Did you know that?

1426
01:31:22,066 --> 01:31:23,465
How are you feeling?

1427
01:31:23,535 --> 01:31:24,900
All right.

1428
01:31:25,637 --> 01:31:27,366
The police still
have a car outside.

1429
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:31,307
I guess they're waiting to see
what your next move is going to be.

1430
01:31:32,444 --> 01:31:34,469
I'm going home.
- And then?

1431
01:31:34,946 --> 01:31:36,880
Then, I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

1432
01:31:36,948 --> 01:31:41,442
And what they did to those women,
and what they did about Walter.

1433
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,983
I used to always tell him, "You never
start a fight, but you always finish it."

1434
01:31:46,057 --> 01:31:49,458
And I didn't start this
fight, but I'm gonna finish it.

1435
01:31:50,061 --> 01:31:54,259
Mrs. Collins, right now you're a
sufficiently high profile that I think

1436
01:31:54,332 --> 01:31:58,166
even the police would hesitate
to go after you out in the open,

1437
01:31:58,636 --> 01:32:01,036
but I have to warn you that
could change very quickly

1438
01:32:01,105 --> 01:32:03,801
if they feel their
position threatened.

1439
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:05,672
Very quickly indeed.

1440
01:32:07,045 --> 01:32:09,377
What are they gonna
do to me now?

1441
01:32:11,282 --> 01:32:12,909
They got nothing.

1442
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,444
I'm going home.

1443
01:32:41,179 --> 01:32:42,578
Hi, sis.

1444
01:32:43,314 --> 01:32:44,645
Gordon.

1445
01:32:44,716 --> 01:32:47,207
I didn't know
you were back in town.

1446
01:32:47,886 --> 01:32:50,047
Yeah, I got in
a couple of days ago,

1447
01:32:50,121 --> 01:32:52,988
figured I'd surprise you.
Is that... Is that okay?

1448
01:32:53,057 --> 01:32:56,083
Yes. Yes, of course.
Of course, come on in.

1449
01:32:58,997 --> 01:33:01,295
Where's that
little niece of mine?

1450
01:33:01,366 --> 01:33:03,493
She went into town.

1451
01:33:03,568 --> 01:33:05,058
Should be back this evening.

1452
01:33:05,136 --> 01:33:06,330
Uh, Bob's here.

1453
01:33:06,404 --> 01:33:07,462
Oh, good.

1454
01:33:07,539 --> 01:33:09,871
Uh, I was gonna ask if I
could stay on a couple days.

1455
01:33:09,941 --> 01:33:11,306
Staying?

1456
01:33:11,709 --> 01:33:12,835
Yeah.

1457
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:15,175
Listen, can I use
your bathroom?

1458
01:33:15,246 --> 01:33:17,237
It's been a long ride and
I could really use a shower.

1459
01:33:17,315 --> 01:33:19,249
Of course.
- Okay.

1460
01:33:20,018 --> 01:33:21,383
Thank you.

1461
01:33:35,767 --> 01:33:36,995
Is that...

1462
01:33:37,201 --> 01:33:40,568
All right, go next door.
I'll call the police. Hurry.

1463
01:33:45,343 --> 01:33:47,038
<i>Operator.</i>
<i>How may I connect you?</i>

1464
01:33:47,612 --> 01:33:48,670
He's upstairs, sir.

1465
01:33:48,746 --> 01:33:51,510
Go around the other side!
Cut him off!

1466
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:52,641
Come with me!
- Yes, sir.

1467
01:33:52,717 --> 01:33:54,014
Let's go!

1468
01:33:58,189 --> 01:34:02,057
Mrs. Collins, I'd like you
to meet my friend, Mr. Hahn.

1469
01:34:02,126 --> 01:34:05,755
Mrs. Collins, my deepest
condolences on your loss.

1470
01:34:06,431 --> 01:34:07,989
May we come in?

1471
01:34:12,103 --> 01:34:14,003
I appreciate the sentiment,

1472
01:34:14,072 --> 01:34:16,302
but they've yet to find...

1473
01:34:16,374 --> 01:34:18,899
To identify the
remains as my son.

1474
01:34:21,079 --> 01:34:23,570
I'm afraid it never
gets any easier.

1475
01:34:24,148 --> 01:34:26,309
I lost a daughter
to polio five years ago.

1476
01:34:26,384 --> 01:34:28,579
There's not a day goes by
when I don't think,

1477
01:34:28,653 --> 01:34:31,178
"I should mention
this to Claudine."

1478
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:33,621
Then I remember
she's not here.

1479
01:34:36,494 --> 01:34:37,791
Please, sit.

1480
01:34:42,734 --> 01:34:44,668
I've been on the phone
all morning

1481
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:47,933
with the appointment secretary
of the police commission.

1482
01:34:48,006 --> 01:34:49,974
They said that they
won't let me testify

1483
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:53,306
at the hearing or call witnesses.
That it won't be necessary.

1484
01:34:53,378 --> 01:34:55,972
I know. My sources say
the police commission

1485
01:34:56,047 --> 01:35:00,143
is going to say that Jones and the
LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong,

1486
01:35:00,251 --> 01:35:03,311
and that the real blame lies
with the kid and with you

1487
01:35:03,388 --> 01:35:08,325
for being difficult and forcing them
to put you away for your own safety.

1488
01:35:11,663 --> 01:35:15,827
Then I guess I would have to
hire a lawyer, file a civil suit.

1489
01:35:16,634 --> 01:35:18,568
I went to the best
attorney in town,

1490
01:35:18,636 --> 01:35:21,469
a man who's sued this
city four times and won.

1491
01:35:21,539 --> 01:35:24,508
Unfortunately, we can't
afford to really hire him.

1492
01:35:24,575 --> 01:35:25,803
I see.

1493
01:35:25,877 --> 01:35:28,368
Which is why
I'm doing this pro bono.

1494
01:35:28,913 --> 01:35:32,246
It would be my honor to defend
your honor, Mrs. Collins.

1495
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:33,815
In my 15 years as a lawyer,

1496
01:35:33,885 --> 01:35:37,685
I have never seen anyone fight
as long or as hard as you have,

1497
01:35:37,922 --> 01:35:41,085
in what is so clearly
in the cause of justice.

1498
01:35:41,859 --> 01:35:43,224
Thank you.

1499
01:35:43,795 --> 01:35:45,160
Let me see
what's on the shelf.

1500
01:35:45,229 --> 01:35:46,560
I'll look.

1501
01:35:48,633 --> 01:35:49,725
Yes? May I...

1502
01:35:49,801 --> 01:35:51,132
My name is S.S. Hahn,

1503
01:35:51,202 --> 01:35:54,035
and I have a court order for the immediate
release of all women being detained

1504
01:35:54,105 --> 01:35:57,040
in this institution under
the designation code 12

1505
01:35:57,108 --> 01:36:00,339
pending a formal inquiry into
the reasons for their detainment.

1506
01:36:00,411 --> 01:36:02,572
I'm sorry, the doctor
in charge is not here

1507
01:36:02,647 --> 01:36:04,171
until the morning.
- Madam, let me be clearer.

1508
01:36:04,248 --> 01:36:07,012
Either you will produce the
people named in that court order,

1509
01:36:07,085 --> 01:36:10,646
or you will find yourself behind
bars, and I mean without a key.

1510
01:36:10,722 --> 01:36:13,850
I can't authorize you...
- Madam, stand aside.

1511
01:36:23,835 --> 01:36:24,893
Can I see her now?

1512
01:36:24,969 --> 01:36:26,994
Sure. Absolutely.
- How does she look?

1513
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:54,598
All right, fellas,
step back. Let's give him room.

1514
01:36:54,665 --> 01:36:55,689
Here he is.

1515
01:36:55,767 --> 01:36:57,758
Mr. Northcott,
any comment on your arrest?

1516
01:36:57,835 --> 01:36:58,995
Mr. Northcott,
how are you feeling?

1517
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:00,731
Oh, I'm feeling fine.

1518
01:37:00,805 --> 01:37:03,330
I've been on a little
vacation, as some of you know.

1519
01:37:03,407 --> 01:37:06,103
It was
a really pleasant vacation.

1520
01:37:06,177 --> 01:37:09,408
The police have certainly provided
me with a lot of amusement.

1521
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,913
How long
you been in hiding?

1522
01:37:10,982 --> 01:37:12,244
How did you
avoid capture?

1523
01:37:12,316 --> 01:37:13,578
Easy, easy.
That's far enough.

1524
01:37:13,651 --> 01:37:15,346
Well, I didn't, did I?

1525
01:37:15,419 --> 01:37:16,511
One more shot!

1526
01:37:16,587 --> 01:37:18,555
Have you seen
your picture in the paper?

1527
01:37:18,623 --> 01:37:21,854
Didn't know anybody
wanted me until just recently.

1528
01:37:21,926 --> 01:37:23,518
Didn't even try.

1529
01:37:24,128 --> 01:37:27,188
My luggage still has
my initials on it, fellas.

1530
01:37:27,265 --> 01:37:29,392
Did you know why
the police were after you?

1531
01:37:29,467 --> 01:37:32,368
No, but I figured it'd be a good
idea if I were to just stay out of it.

1532
01:37:32,436 --> 01:37:33,460
Any remorse, sir?

1533
01:37:33,538 --> 01:37:38,237
Do you have anything to say to
the parents of the children you murdered?

1534
01:37:38,309 --> 01:37:40,004
No comment.

1535
01:37:40,077 --> 01:37:41,169
One more shot,
this way!

1536
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:45,442
Mayor Cryer.
This is unexpected.

1537
01:37:46,317 --> 01:37:47,841
So was this.

1538
01:37:47,919 --> 01:37:51,355
Subpoenas, requests for
depositions, interrogatories.

1539
01:37:51,422 --> 01:37:55,017
All courtesy of Mr. Hahn and his
new client, Christine Collins.

1540
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,518
You don't have to look them
over too closely, Chief.

1541
01:37:57,595 --> 01:38:00,359
Your own copies should
be coming any time now.

1542
01:38:00,431 --> 01:38:02,865
The city council has also
agreed to look into this,

1543
01:38:02,934 --> 01:38:03,992
starting immediately.

1544
01:38:04,068 --> 01:38:05,126
God damn it!

1545
01:38:05,203 --> 01:38:07,933
I thought this was
supposed to go away.

1546
01:38:08,573 --> 01:38:09,801
This is an election year.

1547
01:38:09,874 --> 01:38:11,364
I can't afford
this kind of press.

1548
01:38:11,442 --> 01:38:14,673
It is going away, sir. I've instructed
Captain Jones to deal with it.

1549
01:38:14,745 --> 01:38:16,303
I'm afraid,
falling on his sword

1550
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:20,282
and saying he made a mistake isn't
going to be good enough, Chief.

1551
01:38:20,351 --> 01:38:23,809
If we take him out of
the picture for a while,

1552
01:38:23,888 --> 01:38:27,688
just might help calm things down
until the hearing's finished.

1553
01:38:45,343 --> 01:38:47,641
What is happening?
- Didn't you hear?

1554
01:38:47,712 --> 01:38:49,475
It's the biggest protest
I've ever seen.

1555
01:38:49,547 --> 01:38:50,809
Protest?
- Yeah.

1556
01:38:50,882 --> 01:38:54,079
Over the Collins broad,
if you can believe that.

1557
01:39:03,661 --> 01:39:06,824
We want
justice! We want justice!

1558
01:39:09,233 --> 01:39:10,825
Oh, my!

1559
01:39:17,308 --> 01:39:19,276
Mr. Harris.

1560
01:39:19,343 --> 01:39:22,642
The Lord works in mysterious
ways, Mrs. Collins.

1561
01:39:23,881 --> 01:39:25,746
Boy, does he ever.

1562
01:39:43,034 --> 01:39:45,628
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, can
I have your attention, please?</i>

1563
01:39:45,703 --> 01:39:50,265
There are more people gathered in this chamber
than have ever been in this room before.

1564
01:39:50,341 --> 01:39:54,038
Therefore, I ask you to refrain
from demonstrations of any kind.

1565
01:39:54,111 --> 01:39:55,601
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

1566
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:59,582
We are all here because we want to
know the real facts in this case.

1567
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:03,780
And everybody is going to be heard
if we have to sit here for a week.

1568
01:40:03,854 --> 01:40:06,755
Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any
members of the police commission.

1569
01:40:10,261 --> 01:40:13,424
Are there any members of
the police department in the room?

1570
01:40:13,497 --> 01:40:15,362
Is Chief Davis here?

1571
01:40:16,767 --> 01:40:18,359
Is Captain Jones here?

1572
01:40:20,137 --> 01:40:21,536
Is there anybody here
representing the police?

1573
01:40:21,605 --> 01:40:25,803
Mrs. Collins, could you come across
the street with me for just a moment?

1574
01:40:25,876 --> 01:40:28,071
There's something
I think you should see.

1575
01:40:28,145 --> 01:40:30,170
Well, I hate to call a
recess before we've even started,

1576
01:40:30,247 --> 01:40:31,771
but I think a few
phone calls are in order.

1577
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:38,921
The police decided it'd be best
to keep this off the main docket

1578
01:40:39,023 --> 01:40:43,255
in order to avoid exactly the sort
of chaos we have across the street.

1579
01:40:55,906 --> 01:40:58,875
Mrs. Collins.
I'm Leanne Clay.

1580
01:40:59,677 --> 01:41:01,941
This is my husband, John.
- Hi.

1581
01:41:02,847 --> 01:41:05,873
I just wanted to pass
along my sympathies.

1582
01:41:06,150 --> 01:41:08,277
What we went through
waiting to hear anything

1583
01:41:08,352 --> 01:41:12,482
about our son David
was bad enough, now this.

1584
01:41:13,424 --> 01:41:17,383
But what the police did to
you, there was no call for that.

1585
01:41:17,461 --> 01:41:19,019
No call at all.

1586
01:41:22,033 --> 01:41:23,591
All rise.

1587
01:41:32,343 --> 01:41:34,368
Please, be seated.
- Bailiff.

1588
01:41:47,625 --> 01:41:48,819
Oh, hey.

1589
01:41:51,028 --> 01:41:53,155
I saw you in the papers.

1590
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:57,098
You got a lot of moxie, standing
up to the police like that.

1591
01:42:02,306 --> 01:42:04,240
The defendant
will please rise.

1592
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,973
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1593
01:42:12,049 --> 01:42:16,213
you've been charged with three
counts of murder in the first degree,

1594
01:42:16,287 --> 01:42:20,986
with an additional 17 counts under
review by the district attorney's office.

1595
01:42:21,058 --> 01:42:22,685
How do you plea?

1596
01:42:24,095 --> 01:42:26,222
Oh, not guilty, Your Honor.

1597
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,161
You may sit, Mr. Northcott.

1598
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:41,677
In light of the defendant's penchant for
international travel, no bail will be set.

1599
01:42:41,745 --> 01:42:44,339
This court will hear preliminary
motions by tomorrow morning.

1600
01:42:44,415 --> 01:42:46,883
The boy, Walter Collins,

1601
01:42:46,951 --> 01:42:49,715
was reported as missing,
March 10, 1928.

1602
01:42:50,521 --> 01:42:53,149
We then instituted
a nationwide search.

1603
01:42:53,224 --> 01:42:57,160
On August 18th, we received
a cable indicating that a boy

1604
01:42:57,228 --> 01:43:00,664
matching his description was
found in DeKalb, Illinois.

1605
01:43:00,731 --> 01:43:04,758
Upon questioning, he admitted
to being Walter Collins.

1606
01:43:04,835 --> 01:43:09,795
We then made arrangements for him
to be transported back to California.

1607
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,508
Where Mrs. Collins told you
the boy was not her son.

1608
01:43:12,576 --> 01:43:14,339
Yes. She denied
his identity

1609
01:43:14,411 --> 01:43:17,403
in spite of all of the evidence
pointing to the contrary.

1610
01:43:17,481 --> 01:43:20,575
But, as subsequent
events have demonstrated,

1611
01:43:20,684 --> 01:43:22,345
she was correct.

1612
01:43:23,587 --> 01:43:25,452
So, what prompted
you to send her

1613
01:43:25,523 --> 01:43:27,150
for psychological
evaluation?

1614
01:43:27,224 --> 01:43:28,953
Whether or not this was
in fact the correct boy

1615
01:43:29,026 --> 01:43:31,551
was not relevant
to my decision.

1616
01:43:31,629 --> 01:43:33,790
Throughout this period,
she acted strangely.

1617
01:43:33,864 --> 01:43:37,391
She was often cool
and aloof and unemotional,

1618
01:43:37,468 --> 01:43:41,131
especially when confronted
with the boy we found in DeKalb

1619
01:43:41,205 --> 01:43:43,264
and in our
subsequent conversation.

1620
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:45,205
It was because of her

1621
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:50,709
disturbing behavior that I
submitted her for observation

1622
01:43:50,781 --> 01:43:53,579
to the psychopathic ward of Los
Angeles County General Hospital.

1623
01:43:53,651 --> 01:43:54,948
Just like that.

1624
01:43:55,019 --> 01:43:57,214
You snap your fingers
and an innocent woman

1625
01:43:57,288 --> 01:43:58,983
is thrown
into the psycho ward!

1626
01:43:59,056 --> 01:44:02,389
She wasn't thrown. Every family
in this state is in grave danger

1627
01:44:02,459 --> 01:44:05,587
when a police captain can
take a woman into his office

1628
01:44:05,696 --> 01:44:06,993
and five minutes later

1629
01:44:07,064 --> 01:44:09,794
have her thrown into the psychopathic
ward on his own authority!

1630
01:44:09,867 --> 01:44:11,266
She wasn't thrown.

1631
01:44:11,335 --> 01:44:14,668
She wasn't thrown!
She wasn't thrown!

1632
01:44:15,339 --> 01:44:17,239
What was that, Captain?

1633
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:20,036
She wasn't thrown.
She was escorted.

1634
01:44:23,781 --> 01:44:27,308
Escorted, thrown, the verb
doesn't matter, Captain.

1635
01:44:27,384 --> 01:44:31,616
What does matter is that her incarceration
was ordered without a warrant.

1636
01:44:31,689 --> 01:44:33,623
I am holding a carbon copy

1637
01:44:33,691 --> 01:44:36,819
of the affidavit of insanity
that was issued in the case

1638
01:44:36,894 --> 01:44:40,330
of the <i>State of California</i>
<i>v. Christine Collins.</i>

1639
01:44:40,397 --> 01:44:41,864
Who signed the affidavit?

1640
01:44:41,932 --> 01:44:43,024
I did.

1641
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:45,728
Well, now, let me see
if I have this correct,

1642
01:44:45,803 --> 01:44:49,398
a woman was thrown into the
psychopathic ward without a warrant,

1643
01:44:49,473 --> 01:44:51,634
because no warrant existed.

1644
01:44:51,709 --> 01:44:54,269
And when it was finally
written several days later,

1645
01:44:54,345 --> 01:44:56,711
there was no need to sign it
or to go to a judge

1646
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:59,544
because she was already
in the asylum!

1647
01:45:01,218 --> 01:45:02,310
Is this correct, Captain?

1648
01:45:02,386 --> 01:45:03,648
Technically, yes.

1649
01:45:03,721 --> 01:45:06,747
Extraordinary steps were necessary
because we were dealing...

1650
01:45:06,824 --> 01:45:08,655
We were dealing with
an extraordinary situation.

1651
01:45:08,726 --> 01:45:11,422
Now, is it our fault
that we were being deceived

1652
01:45:11,495 --> 01:45:14,293
by a boy who claimed to
be Walter Collins? No.

1653
01:45:15,065 --> 01:45:18,057
In light of his claims
and her disturbing behavior,

1654
01:45:18,135 --> 01:45:20,729
who wouldn't begin to think that there
was something the matter with her?

1655
01:45:20,804 --> 01:45:21,828
Because she questioned you?

1656
01:45:21,905 --> 01:45:24,100
No, because
she wouldn't listen!

1657
01:45:24,174 --> 01:45:25,971
Because she insisted
on being obstinate!

1658
01:45:26,043 --> 01:45:29,240
Because she tried to take
matters into her own hand,

1659
01:45:29,346 --> 01:45:31,109
best left to
qualified officers!

1660
01:45:31,181 --> 01:45:32,876
Because once
civil disobedience starts...

1661
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:35,009
Because she was fighting
for the life of her son!

1662
01:45:35,085 --> 01:45:37,076
A boy who may have
still been alive

1663
01:45:37,154 --> 01:45:41,818
while you were wasting valuable time
denying you had done anything wrong!

1664
01:45:44,561 --> 01:45:46,119
And in the end

1665
01:45:47,631 --> 01:45:50,361
that's what
happened, isn't it?

1666
01:45:50,467 --> 01:45:53,925
At some point, while
all this was going on,

1667
01:45:56,106 --> 01:45:58,768
Walter Collins
was brutally murdered,

1668
01:45:59,743 --> 01:46:02,143
along with as many
as 19 other boys

1669
01:46:03,947 --> 01:46:06,609
at the Northcott Ranch
in Wineville.

1670
01:46:08,419 --> 01:46:10,580
Is that correct, Captain?

1671
01:46:12,222 --> 01:46:13,712
Yes, it is.

1672
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:16,085
It's a travesty.

1673
01:46:21,765 --> 01:46:23,596
No further questions.

1674
01:46:40,984 --> 01:46:42,975
<i>Train number 14,</i>
<i>now boarding on track...</i>

1675
01:46:43,053 --> 01:46:46,921
So, after much effort, we
were able to identify this boy,

1676
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:49,550
who's been responsible
for so much trouble lately,

1677
01:46:49,626 --> 01:46:52,493
as Arthur Hutchins
of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

1678
01:46:53,297 --> 01:46:56,562
Between this, and the arrest of
the man suspected of murdering

1679
01:46:56,633 --> 01:46:58,362
the real Walter Collins,

1680
01:46:58,435 --> 01:47:01,700
we've cleared up two of the biggest
mysteries in the history of Los Angeles.

1681
01:47:01,772 --> 01:47:03,967
I hope you gentlemen
of the press will give

1682
01:47:04,041 --> 01:47:06,100
as much space to the
good things we do

1683
01:47:06,176 --> 01:47:08,736
as the mistakes that are
made on rare occasions.

1684
01:47:08,812 --> 01:47:10,643
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce you

1685
01:47:10,714 --> 01:47:13,774
to the boy's real mother,
Mrs. Janet Hutchins.

1686
01:47:15,219 --> 01:47:16,686
Arthur.

1687
01:47:16,787 --> 01:47:18,277
I hope he wasn't too
much trouble for you.

1688
01:47:18,355 --> 01:47:20,152
Oh, no, not at all.

1689
01:47:20,224 --> 01:47:22,419
How about
a photograph, fellas?

1690
01:47:25,496 --> 01:47:26,895
One more.

1691
01:47:27,464 --> 01:47:28,897
Mrs. Hutchins,

1692
01:47:28,966 --> 01:47:32,299
Mrs. Collins, the woman he was
staying with, wanted him to have these.

1693
01:47:32,369 --> 01:47:33,859
They're the clothes
she let him wear.

1694
01:47:33,937 --> 01:47:35,734
Well, thank you.

1695
01:47:35,806 --> 01:47:37,569
Isn't that nice, Arthur?

1696
01:47:37,641 --> 01:47:40,007
Tell the nice officer,
"Thank you."

1697
01:47:40,077 --> 01:47:43,069
I don't want them.
Give them to somebody else.

1698
01:47:43,147 --> 01:47:44,774
Precocious
little fellow, isn't he?

1699
01:47:44,848 --> 01:47:47,146
It's not my fault.
It's the police.

1700
01:47:47,217 --> 01:47:50,846
They said I was Walter Collins,
not me! It wasn't my idea!

1701
01:47:50,921 --> 01:47:52,388
Not my idea!
- Get...

1702
01:47:52,456 --> 01:47:54,890
Yeah. Go blame the police
for your own mistakes.

1703
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:57,119
We've seen a lot of
that lately, haven't we?

1704
01:47:57,194 --> 01:48:00,129
Take care now, Arthur!
Safe travels.

1705
01:48:01,298 --> 01:48:03,528
All right, fellas,
that's it for today.

1706
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,329
Sir, sir! What
did the boy mean by that?

1707
01:48:05,602 --> 01:48:09,129
It was March 10th, and
I came home from work,

1708
01:48:09,206 --> 01:48:12,073
and my nine-year-old
son, Walter, was gone.

1709
01:48:12,142 --> 01:48:15,873
Captain Jones was acting on
information he believed to be correct.

1710
01:48:15,946 --> 01:48:19,575
Walter Collins had a diastema,
also known as a diastema.

1711
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:21,174
That child was never
in my classroom.

1712
01:48:21,285 --> 01:48:22,809
I can certainly
attest to that.

1713
01:48:22,886 --> 01:48:26,253
We rely on our good
friends in the police department

1714
01:48:26,323 --> 01:48:29,383
to point to us those
people who exhibit behavior

1715
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:32,190
which is socially
unacceptable.

1716
01:48:32,262 --> 01:48:37,097
About four inches
shorter than the last mark of Walter.

1717
01:48:37,968 --> 01:48:40,493
Well, some of
these pictures show

1718
01:48:40,571 --> 01:48:43,233
what Sanford Clark
told me,

1719
01:48:43,307 --> 01:48:46,902
that he did in fact help in
the murder of these children.

1720
01:48:46,977 --> 01:48:48,672
Thank you, Detective.

1721
01:48:48,745 --> 01:48:49,973
Gentlemen of the jury,

1722
01:48:50,047 --> 01:48:52,811
I ask you to take a good
look at these images.

1723
01:48:52,883 --> 01:48:55,443
They establish beyond
any reasonable doubt

1724
01:48:55,519 --> 01:48:59,285
the circumstances and the
nature of these heinous crimes.

1725
01:49:10,534 --> 01:49:12,399
I'm in here,
Reverend.

1726
01:49:20,511 --> 01:49:22,638
When Walter was here, I
used to walk by his room

1727
01:49:22,713 --> 01:49:24,874
when he was sleeping.

1728
01:49:24,948 --> 01:49:28,941
And even though I couldn't
see him or hear him,

1729
01:49:29,019 --> 01:49:30,748
I could feel him.

1730
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:35,720
That's why I don't
think Walter's dead.

1731
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:38,857
I can still feel him.

1732
01:49:41,498 --> 01:49:43,466
Mrs. Collins...
- No.

1733
01:49:43,534 --> 01:49:45,729
I know what
the police said.

1734
01:49:46,236 --> 01:49:48,796
But that place
and the remains,

1735
01:49:50,674 --> 01:49:53,199
they couldn't be
properly identified.

1736
01:49:54,211 --> 01:49:58,545
And maybe that kid made a mistake
when he picked Walter's picture.

1737
01:49:59,416 --> 01:50:02,817
I understand you don't
want to accept this.

1738
01:50:02,886 --> 01:50:04,547
What mother would?

1739
01:50:07,858 --> 01:50:11,350
But I think it's time
for you to move on

1740
01:50:11,461 --> 01:50:13,827
and start over
for yourself.

1741
01:50:15,065 --> 01:50:17,499
Your son would
want you to move on.

1742
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:21,900
Maybe.

1743
01:50:21,972 --> 01:50:25,271
Maybe he'd want me
to keep looking for him.

1744
01:50:25,342 --> 01:50:27,867
Maybe he's somewhere
waiting for me.

1745
01:50:29,746 --> 01:50:31,976
I believe he is
waiting, ma'am.

1746
01:50:33,483 --> 01:50:35,280
He's waiting in
that place where

1747
01:50:35,352 --> 01:50:39,379
we'll all go someday to be
reunited with our loved ones.

1748
01:50:39,456 --> 01:50:44,553
And on that day, he'll know
from front to back, end to end,

1749
01:50:44,628 --> 01:50:48,155
heart to soul, that you did
everything you could, Mrs. Collins.

1750
01:50:49,533 --> 01:50:50,898
Everything.

1751
01:50:54,805 --> 01:50:56,500
We should go, ma'am.

1752
01:50:56,573 --> 01:50:57,938
One minute.

1753
01:51:24,835 --> 01:51:27,326
This meeting will
now come to order.

1754
01:51:28,338 --> 01:51:31,364
This committee has now
heard all of the testimony,

1755
01:51:31,441 --> 01:51:34,410
and, in light of
the facts presented,

1756
01:51:34,511 --> 01:51:37,344
we recommend that the
suspension of Captain Jones

1757
01:51:37,414 --> 01:51:38,881
be made permanent.

1758
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:46,780
Order! Please. Please.

1759
01:51:47,924 --> 01:51:49,915
Mr. Foreman,

1760
01:51:49,993 --> 01:51:52,484
has the jury
reached a verdict?

1761
01:51:52,562 --> 01:51:54,325
We have, Your Honor.

1762
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:57,829
Will the defendant
please rise?

1763
01:52:00,437 --> 01:52:04,237
Second, that steps be taken
to investigate a change

1764
01:52:04,341 --> 01:52:07,435
in the prevailing laws and
procedures by which a citizen

1765
01:52:07,511 --> 01:52:10,969
of this city can be
subjected to incarceration

1766
01:52:11,048 --> 01:52:13,107
in the county's
mental facilities.

1767
01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:22,281
You may read the verdict.

1768
01:52:22,993 --> 01:52:25,860
"We the jury find the defendant,
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1769
01:52:25,929 --> 01:52:28,489
"guilty on all counts of
murder in the first degree."

1770
01:52:33,270 --> 01:52:37,536
Finally, restoration of public
confidence in the police department

1771
01:52:37,607 --> 01:52:39,734
can only be achieved

1772
01:52:39,843 --> 01:52:43,074
by the removal of
its chief of police,

1773
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:45,205
and this committee
so recommends.

1774
01:52:45,282 --> 01:52:46,510
This hearing
is concluded.

1775
01:53:07,337 --> 01:53:11,637
Does the defendant wish to make a
statement before judgment is passed?

1776
01:53:12,776 --> 01:53:15,540
I want to make
it real clear

1777
01:53:15,612 --> 01:53:19,048
that I never once got
a fair shake from you,

1778
01:53:19,116 --> 01:53:20,879
Your Honor,

1779
01:53:21,818 --> 01:53:24,286
or from this court.

1780
01:53:28,692 --> 01:53:31,855
The only one in here worth
a good goddamn is her.

1781
01:53:34,264 --> 01:53:37,324
'Cause she's the only one who
never badmouthed me to the press.

1782
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:38,833
She's the only one
who understands

1783
01:53:38,902 --> 01:53:40,426
what it is to be
framed by the police

1784
01:53:40,504 --> 01:53:42,802
for something you didn't
do. All right, that's enough.

1785
01:53:42,873 --> 01:53:45,467
And then to just be
thrown in the hole,

1786
01:53:45,542 --> 01:53:48,534
to just rot and to fester
and to be forgotten

1787
01:53:48,612 --> 01:53:50,341
and fade away, isn't that right?
- Gordon!

1788
01:53:50,413 --> 01:53:51,539
Counsel!
- Isn't it?

1789
01:53:51,615 --> 01:53:54,015
I never killed your boy,
Mrs. Collins.

1790
01:53:54,084 --> 01:53:55,847
Counsel, that's enough!
- I would never do that.

1791
01:53:55,919 --> 01:53:56,977
I would never
hurt Walter.

1792
01:53:57,053 --> 01:53:58,077
Counsel, get control
of your client

1793
01:53:58,155 --> 01:53:59,213
or I'll have him
bound and gagged!

1794
01:53:59,289 --> 01:54:00,779
He's an angel.

1795
01:54:00,857 --> 01:54:03,587
Come on, Gordon.
- Get off of me!

1796
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:05,150
Now get down.

1797
01:54:07,898 --> 01:54:09,991
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1798
01:54:11,635 --> 01:54:13,933
it is the judgment
of this court

1799
01:54:14,004 --> 01:54:16,302
that you be conveyed
to San Quentin Prison,

1800
01:54:16,373 --> 01:54:19,672
where you'll be held in solitary
confinement for a period of two years,

1801
01:54:19,743 --> 01:54:23,338
until October 2, 1930.

1802
01:54:24,414 --> 01:54:28,748
On that date, you will be
hanged by the neck until dead.

1803
01:54:31,621 --> 01:54:33,680
May God have
mercy on your soul.

1804
01:55:47,764 --> 01:55:49,254
Is it all right if I
have a 10-minute break?

1805
01:55:49,332 --> 01:55:50,629
Of course.

1806
01:55:53,203 --> 01:55:54,568
You know,

1807
01:55:55,672 --> 01:55:57,606
one of these days you might
actually consider taking

1808
01:55:57,674 --> 01:55:59,198
one of these
10-minute breaks.

1809
01:55:59,276 --> 01:56:01,039
It might be
good for you.

1810
01:56:01,111 --> 01:56:02,442
We'll see.

1811
01:56:05,282 --> 01:56:07,307
This is
Christine Collins.

1812
01:56:07,384 --> 01:56:09,318
I called yesterday.

1813
01:56:09,386 --> 01:56:11,980
I was wondering if you had a
chance to look through the files

1814
01:56:12,055 --> 01:56:15,718
and see if there was a match
to my son, Walter Collins.

1815
01:56:16,726 --> 01:56:18,318
I see.

1816
01:56:18,395 --> 01:56:19,657
Well, if it's all
right with you,

1817
01:56:19,729 --> 01:56:22,493
I'll call back in a
month. Thank you very much.

1818
01:56:22,565 --> 01:56:24,760
Mrs. Collins.
- I was just...

1819
01:56:24,834 --> 01:56:26,233
Yes, I know.

1820
01:56:27,370 --> 01:56:30,237
In fact, that's why
I wanted to see you.

1821
01:56:30,307 --> 01:56:32,138
It's about Walter.
We had a...

1822
01:56:33,176 --> 01:56:35,940
Well, we received
a very strange telegram.

1823
01:56:36,846 --> 01:56:38,108
From who?

1824
01:56:38,181 --> 01:56:40,149
Gordon Northcott.

1825
01:56:40,216 --> 01:56:42,116
He's asked to see you.

1826
01:56:42,652 --> 01:56:43,710
Why?

1827
01:56:44,788 --> 01:56:46,722
He said he knows you're
still looking for your son,

1828
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:48,690
and before he dies...

1829
01:56:52,162 --> 01:56:55,563
He says he lied when he testified
that he didn't kill Walter.

1830
01:56:55,632 --> 01:56:59,227
Christine, he's willing to
finally admit that he did it.

1831
01:57:00,070 --> 01:57:02,538
He says if you come up
to see him in person,

1832
01:57:02,605 --> 01:57:05,130
then he'll tell you
the truth, to your face

1833
01:57:05,208 --> 01:57:07,733
so that you can get
on with your life

1834
01:57:08,845 --> 01:57:10,312
and have some peace.

1835
01:57:11,081 --> 01:57:12,605
<i>As you know, he's</i>
<i>set to be executed</i>

1836
01:57:12,682 --> 01:57:14,946
<i>the day after tomorrow</i>
<i>at San Quentin,</i>

1837
01:57:15,018 --> 01:57:18,181
<i>so you don't have</i>
<i>a lot of time.</i>

1838
01:57:19,189 --> 01:57:22,955
<i>It took me most of the morning
to make all the arrangements.</i>

1839
01:57:23,259 --> 01:57:25,090
<i>Turns out, you're the</i>
<i>first woman in 30 years</i>

1840
01:57:25,161 --> 01:57:28,096
<i>the state has allowed</i>
<i>to visit a serial killer</i>

1841
01:57:28,164 --> 01:57:30,257
<i>on the eve of</i>
<i>his execution.</i>

1842
01:57:50,954 --> 01:57:52,182
You'll be all
right, ma'am?

1843
01:57:52,255 --> 01:57:54,689
Yes.
- We're right at the door.

1844
01:57:57,794 --> 01:57:59,193
Twenty minutes.

1845
01:58:04,534 --> 01:58:06,900
Don't suppose you
got a cigarette?

1846
01:58:09,439 --> 01:58:12,340
Mr. Northcott, you
asked me to come here.

1847
01:58:12,542 --> 01:58:14,237
You said that
if I did,

1848
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:17,006
you would tell me
the truth about my son.

1849
01:58:18,314 --> 01:58:19,713
Yeah.

1850
01:58:21,251 --> 01:58:23,879
You're right.
I did say that.

1851
01:58:23,953 --> 01:58:27,480
But see, the thing is,

1852
01:58:27,557 --> 01:58:30,993
I didn't really think
that you would come.

1853
01:58:31,061 --> 01:58:32,426
And now.

1854
01:58:33,596 --> 01:58:35,723
And now...
And now what?

1855
01:58:35,932 --> 01:58:38,230
I just didn't
expect that you'd...

1856
01:58:40,236 --> 01:58:42,204
I don't wanna see you.

1857
01:58:42,672 --> 01:58:44,731
You don't wanna see me?

1858
01:58:44,808 --> 01:58:47,276
No. See, I can't do this.

1859
01:58:47,343 --> 01:58:49,334
I don't wanna talk to you. I
can't talk to you right now,

1860
01:58:49,412 --> 01:58:51,403
not with what they're gonna
be doing to me tomorrow.

1861
01:58:51,481 --> 01:58:54,814
It's one thing, Mrs.
Collins, to send a telegram,

1862
01:58:54,884 --> 01:58:56,351
that is really easy.

1863
01:58:56,419 --> 01:59:00,913
But when it's here, right
now, in person, you know,

1864
01:59:00,990 --> 01:59:02,389
I just, I can't...

1865
01:59:02,459 --> 01:59:04,484
I can't tell you what you
want to hear, Mrs. Collins.

1866
01:59:04,561 --> 01:59:05,619
And why not?

1867
01:59:05,695 --> 01:59:09,324
Because I don't want to go
to hell with a lie on my lips.

1868
01:59:09,399 --> 01:59:11,492
See, I did my penance,

1869
01:59:11,568 --> 01:59:14,867
and I asked God to forgive me
and he did, so far as I know.

1870
01:59:14,938 --> 01:59:17,566
And I have been
really good ever since.

1871
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:22,407
But if I lie now, if I
commit any sins right now,

1872
01:59:22,479 --> 01:59:24,379
I'm out of time here,

1873
01:59:24,447 --> 01:59:25,846
and I won't be
forgiven again.

1874
01:59:25,915 --> 01:59:28,281
And I'll tell you one thing,
I am not going to hell.

1875
01:59:30,687 --> 01:59:32,587
I'm not...

1876
01:59:39,496 --> 01:59:42,260
Mr. Northcott, you
asked me to come here.

1877
01:59:52,575 --> 01:59:53,906
Mr. Northcott,
please look at me.

1878
01:59:55,812 --> 01:59:58,144
Mr. Northcott,
please look at me.

1879
02:00:05,054 --> 02:00:06,817
Did you kill my son?

1880
02:00:11,661 --> 02:00:13,424
Did you kill my son?

1881
02:00:14,264 --> 02:00:15,731
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1882
02:00:15,798 --> 02:00:17,459
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
- Hmm.

1883
02:00:17,534 --> 02:00:18,694
Did you kill my son?

1884
02:00:20,603 --> 02:00:23,504
I told you, I don't wanna
talk to you right now.

1885
02:00:24,073 --> 02:00:26,541
Did you kill my son?

1886
02:00:26,609 --> 02:00:28,167
Did you kill my son?

1887
02:00:28,244 --> 02:00:29,302
Did you kill my son?
- Hmm.

1888
02:00:29,379 --> 02:00:30,744
Did you kill my son?
- I don't know.

1889
02:00:30,813 --> 02:00:32,007
You don't know?
You don't remember?

1890
02:00:32,081 --> 02:00:33,446
Did you kill my son?
- Oh, no.

1891
02:00:33,516 --> 02:00:36,246
Answer me!
You answer me! You answer me!

1892
02:00:36,319 --> 02:00:38,344
I don't know their names.
- Did you kill my son? Yes...

1893
02:00:38,421 --> 02:00:39,649
You better get off of me.

1894
02:00:39,722 --> 02:00:41,087
Or what?
- Hmm.

1895
02:00:41,157 --> 02:00:42,556
Did you kill my son?
- I don't know.

1896
02:00:42,625 --> 02:00:43,819
Did you kill...

1897
02:00:43,893 --> 02:00:45,190
Did you kill my son?

1898
02:00:45,261 --> 02:00:46,523
You know his name!
- Oh, I don't. No.

1899
02:00:46,596 --> 02:00:48,325
You know his name!
You called him an angel!

1900
02:00:48,398 --> 02:00:50,423
No.
- You know his name!

1901
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,933
No, I don't know his name.
- Did you kill my son?

1902
02:00:52,001 --> 02:00:53,969
They cried for their parents to
come and get them and then I...

1903
02:00:54,037 --> 02:00:56,164
Did you kill my son?
Did you kill my son?

1904
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:57,399
Answer me!
- Or what?

1905
02:00:57,473 --> 02:00:58,804
Answer me!

1906
02:00:58,875 --> 02:01:00,740
What are you
gonna do? You gonna hurt me?

1907
02:01:00,810 --> 02:01:02,835
I hope you go to hell.

1908
02:01:02,912 --> 02:01:04,777
I hope you go to hell.

1909
02:01:04,847 --> 02:01:06,508
Did you kill my son?
- Guard! Hey, guard!

1910
02:01:06,583 --> 02:01:08,517
Did you kill my son?

1911
02:01:08,585 --> 02:01:10,416
Did you kill my son?
- Ma'am, please.

1912
02:01:10,486 --> 02:01:12,579
Come on.
- I hope you go to hell!

1913
02:01:12,655 --> 02:01:16,887
I hope you go to hell!
I hope you go to hell!

1914
02:01:17,927 --> 02:01:19,485
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1915
02:01:21,598 --> 02:01:24,362
Did you kill my son?

1916
02:02:24,127 --> 02:02:26,027
"Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1917
02:02:26,095 --> 02:02:28,996
"you have been
convicted of murder,

1918
02:02:29,065 --> 02:02:31,863
"the penalty for which
is death by hanging.

1919
02:02:33,202 --> 02:02:35,932
"There have been
no stays or reprieves,

1920
02:02:36,005 --> 02:02:38,030
"therefore the execution
will go forward

1921
02:02:38,107 --> 02:02:41,634
"as stipulated under the laws
of the State of California."

1922
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:46,171
Do you have
any last words?

1923
02:02:46,249 --> 02:02:47,546
No.

1924
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:51,848
Nothing.

1925
02:02:56,025 --> 02:02:59,517
I kept clean after
I confessed, Reverend,

1926
02:02:59,595 --> 02:03:01,529
just like I said I would.

1927
02:03:04,901 --> 02:03:07,165
Will it...

1928
02:03:07,236 --> 02:03:08,703
Will it hurt?

1929
02:03:15,945 --> 02:03:18,436
Please,
please, not so fast.

1930
02:03:20,216 --> 02:03:22,616
Please, don't make
me walk so fast!

1931
02:03:24,087 --> 02:03:26,954
Please,
don't make me!

1932
02:03:27,023 --> 02:03:29,321
No, I don't wanna.

1933
02:03:40,303 --> 02:03:43,136
No! Thirteen steps.

1934
02:03:44,707 --> 02:03:46,800
Thirteen steps.

1935
02:03:46,876 --> 02:03:49,743
But I didn't touch
them all, you bastards.

1936
02:03:49,812 --> 02:03:53,373
I didn't touch them all.
I didn't touch them all.

1937
02:03:54,384 --> 02:03:56,113
Please!

1938
02:04:01,624 --> 02:04:04,787
A prayer! Please!

1939
02:04:05,728 --> 02:04:07,457
God!

1940
02:04:08,498 --> 02:04:12,559
Please! Somebody
here, please,

1941
02:04:12,635 --> 02:04:15,798
say a prayer for me!

1942
02:04:15,872 --> 02:04:19,035
No, God. No!

1943
02:04:21,544 --> 02:04:23,569
No! No!

1944
02:04:34,290 --> 02:04:38,522
<i>Silent night</i>

1945
02:04:41,597 --> 02:04:45,693
<i>Holy night</i>

1946
02:04:47,236 --> 02:04:50,763
<i>All is calm</i>

1947
02:04:52,074 --> 02:04:56,010
<i>All is bright</i>

1948
02:04:57,013 --> 02:05:01,575
<i>Round yon Virgin</i>

1949
02:05:02,251 --> 02:05:05,152
<i>Mother and child</i>

1950
02:05:57,006 --> 02:05:58,473
We're having
a party tonight

1951
02:05:58,541 --> 02:06:00,566
at my place for
the Academy show.

1952
02:06:00,643 --> 02:06:02,577
You want to come?
- No, I have a million things to do.

1953
02:06:02,645 --> 02:06:04,203
Oh, come on,
please. Please!

1954
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:06,976
You girls blew the phone lines
out from here to Baltimore.

1955
02:06:07,083 --> 02:06:08,311
Someone's gotta fix them.

1956
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:09,976
Go, have a good night.
I have the radio.

1957
02:06:10,052 --> 02:06:11,610
Okay.

1958
02:06:12,688 --> 02:06:13,712
You sure?

1959
02:06:13,789 --> 02:06:14,813
I'm sure. I'm sure.
Have a good night.

1960
02:06:14,891 --> 02:06:16,654
Good night.
- Good night.

1961
02:06:21,264 --> 02:06:23,232
Listen, I really...

1962
02:06:25,301 --> 02:06:26,666
Hello, Ben.

1963
02:06:28,571 --> 02:06:32,507
I'm meeting some friends at
Musso and Frank's for dinner.

1964
02:06:33,075 --> 02:06:36,806
They're gonna pipe in the movie
ceremonies into the restaurant.

1965
02:06:36,879 --> 02:06:39,006
Should be quite a night.

1966
02:06:39,081 --> 02:06:41,140
I'd love it if you'd come.

1967
02:06:42,552 --> 02:06:45,350
I just have so much
work I should be doing.

1968
02:06:47,390 --> 02:06:48,755
Good night.

1969
02:06:51,627 --> 02:06:52,787
Ben?

1970
02:06:54,630 --> 02:06:55,858
I...

1971
02:06:55,932 --> 02:06:57,797
I put $2 down on
<i>It Happened One Night</i>

1972
02:06:57,867 --> 02:06:59,334
to win Best Picture.

1973
02:06:59,402 --> 02:07:01,029
Seems I am the only
person that thinks

1974
02:07:01,103 --> 02:07:02,968
it has a chance
against <i>Cleopatra.</i>

1975
02:07:03,039 --> 02:07:05,098
But, if it wins, do you wanna
celebrate tomorrow night at dinner?

1976
02:07:06,642 --> 02:07:09,236
It's a deal, Christine.
See you.

1977
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:11,940
If your movie wins,
I'll call you.

1978
02:07:12,014 --> 02:07:13,481
I'll be here.

1979
02:07:17,587 --> 02:07:18,747
Hi.
- Hi.

1980
02:07:20,856 --> 02:07:24,087
...The Thin Man, Cleopatra...

1981
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:25,787
Overrated.

1982
02:07:25,861 --> 02:07:27,920
<i>... and</i> It Happened One Night.

1983
02:07:27,997 --> 02:07:29,931
Clark Gable,
Claudette Colbert.

1984
02:07:29,999 --> 02:07:31,398
I rest my case.

1985
02:07:31,467 --> 02:07:33,901
<i>May I have the</i>
<i>envelope, please?</i>

1986
02:07:35,538 --> 02:07:39,269
<i>And the winner is</i>
It Happened One Night.

1987
02:07:41,143 --> 02:07:43,338
I knew it! I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it!

1988
02:07:45,414 --> 02:07:47,041
Dinner is on me.

1989
02:07:47,116 --> 02:07:48,981
<i>Is this Christine Collins?</i>

1990
02:07:49,051 --> 02:07:51,212
Yes, it is.

1991
02:07:51,287 --> 02:07:53,881
<i>This is Mrs. Clay.</i>
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

1992
02:07:54,523 --> 02:07:56,821
Mrs. Clay,
of course I remember you.

1993
02:07:56,892 --> 02:07:58,951
<i>I just had to</i>
<i>call you right off.</i>

1994
02:07:59,028 --> 02:08:01,292
What is it?
<i>- The police just called.</i>

1995
02:08:01,364 --> 02:08:03,559
<i>They found a boy,</i>
<i>Christine.</i>

1996
02:08:05,368 --> 02:08:07,495
Where?
<i>- Lincoln Heights Precinct.</i>

1997
02:08:07,570 --> 02:08:09,037
<i>We're leaving right now.</i>

1998
02:08:09,105 --> 02:08:10,595
I'll be right down.

1999
02:08:33,295 --> 02:08:34,592
Oh, here.

2000
02:08:35,264 --> 02:08:36,629
I wanted to go
to him right off,

2001
02:08:36,699 --> 02:08:39,827
but they said it was important
to talk to him alone first.

2002
02:08:39,902 --> 02:08:42,029
Are they sure?
- They're sure.

2003
02:08:42,104 --> 02:08:45,267
But, more important,
I'm sure.

2004
02:08:45,341 --> 02:08:46,433
It's my boy, all right.

2005
02:08:46,509 --> 02:08:48,340
It's David.

2006
02:08:48,411 --> 02:08:50,538
He's alive, Christine.

2007
02:08:50,613 --> 02:08:52,012
They found him
up in Hesperia.

2008
02:08:52,081 --> 02:08:55,073
<i>You were
walking home from school,</i>

2009
02:08:55,151 --> 02:08:57,346
<i>and they told you they
needed help finding a dog.</i>

2010
02:08:57,420 --> 02:08:58,682
<i>Yeah.</i>

2011
02:08:58,754 --> 02:09:01,814
<i>So, after you got in the
truck, what happened next?</i>

2012
02:09:01,891 --> 02:09:04,189
<i>They drove me around</i>
<i>for a long time,</i>

2013
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:05,818
then we ended up
at this ranch.

2014
02:09:05,961 --> 02:09:09,362
Come on. Come on, Davy.

2015
02:09:09,432 --> 02:09:10,797
Davy! Come on.
- Get off me.

2016
02:09:10,866 --> 02:09:12,060
Don't fight
this much. Hey!

2017
02:09:12,134 --> 02:09:14,227
Were there other
boys there?

2018
02:09:14,937 --> 02:09:17,405
<i>Yeah. Five, I think.</i>

2019
02:09:18,974 --> 02:09:20,908
It was a long
time ago, though.

2020
02:09:20,976 --> 02:09:23,274
Hello, boys.
This is Davy.

2021
02:09:23,345 --> 02:09:24,710
I know you'll make
him feel... Hey!

2022
02:09:25,881 --> 02:09:29,214
No. No! Hey! Shut up!

2023
02:09:29,285 --> 02:09:31,185
Did you speak to them?

2024
02:09:31,954 --> 02:09:34,548
Yeah? You remember
any of their names?

2025
02:09:35,424 --> 02:09:37,392
Yeah.

2026
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:38,893
Two of them
were brothers.

2027
02:09:38,961 --> 02:09:41,794
I think their last
name was Winslow.

2028
02:09:43,099 --> 02:09:45,192
<i>The oldest one</i>
<i>was Jeffrey.</i>

2029
02:09:49,171 --> 02:09:50,661
And Walter.

2030
02:09:53,075 --> 02:09:54,599
<i>Walter?</i>

2031
02:09:55,377 --> 02:09:58,278
Yeah.
- Do you remember Walter's last name?

2032
02:10:03,719 --> 02:10:04,981
Collins.

2033
02:10:06,655 --> 02:10:08,213
<i>Walter Collins.</i>

2034
02:10:09,258 --> 02:10:12,489
Tell me something if you only
remember some of the boys' names,

2035
02:10:12,561 --> 02:10:15,223
how come you remember
his full name?

2036
02:10:15,965 --> 02:10:18,092
Because of
what happened.

2037
02:10:18,167 --> 02:10:20,192
<i>Walter and Jeffrey</i>
<i>were talking.</i>

2038
02:10:20,269 --> 02:10:22,203
Pull it.
<i>- They kept checking around</i>

2039
02:10:22,271 --> 02:10:24,865
and they found a part of the coop
where the wire was all messed up.

2040
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:26,532
Be careful!

2041
02:10:26,609 --> 02:10:28,304
Hurry!

2042
02:10:28,377 --> 02:10:30,743
Maybe make enough room to
get out of there and run.

2043
02:10:30,813 --> 02:10:32,508
When we get
out, we split up,

2044
02:10:32,581 --> 02:10:34,344
go in different
directions. Okay?

2045
02:10:34,416 --> 02:10:36,509
They can't catch all of us.

2046
02:10:36,585 --> 02:10:38,553
It'd make an awful
lot of noise.

2047
02:10:38,621 --> 02:10:41,351
Be quiet. You got it?

2048
02:10:41,423 --> 02:10:44,324
And if it wasn't wide
enough, then we'd be stuck.

2049
02:10:47,696 --> 02:10:50,893
Wait.
Help! Help! Come on, hurry!

2050
02:10:51,801 --> 02:10:55,100
My foot's stuck! Hurry,
help! Help me, please!

2051
02:10:57,673 --> 02:11:00,540
He's coming!
He's...

2052
02:11:00,609 --> 02:11:02,270
My foot!

2053
02:11:03,212 --> 02:11:04,736
He's coming.

2054
02:11:04,814 --> 02:11:06,577
Hurry, run, run, run!

2055
02:11:11,687 --> 02:11:14,178
Hey! What
the hell are you boys...

2056
02:11:16,058 --> 02:11:20,688
Oh! Mary, Mother of
God! Hey! Hey! Hey!

2057
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:24,490
You get back here!
Hey! Hold it! Hey!

2058
02:11:26,969 --> 02:11:28,061
Hey!

2059
02:11:29,238 --> 02:11:30,296
Hey!

2060
02:11:31,507 --> 02:11:33,134
Stop!

2061
02:11:35,477 --> 02:11:36,842
Check on the others!

2062
02:11:36,912 --> 02:11:38,311
Stop! Damn it!

2063
02:11:38,380 --> 02:11:40,644
Boys,
I'm coming after you!

2064
02:11:40,716 --> 02:11:43,810
Damn it! Damn it!

2065
02:11:44,119 --> 02:11:47,054
Boys, I'll find you no
matter where you are!

2066
02:11:47,122 --> 02:11:49,488
They're not in there!
- Come on! Get in the car!

2067
02:11:49,558 --> 02:11:53,688
I'm gonna find you! Damn
it! Damn it! Come on.

2068
02:11:53,762 --> 02:11:56,162
Shit! Get in
the car, Sanford!

2069
02:12:03,639 --> 02:12:06,267
That was the last
I saw of any of them.

2070
02:12:06,842 --> 02:12:09,868
So, you don't know if either
of the other two were captured?

2071
02:12:09,945 --> 02:12:11,037
No.

2072
02:12:12,314 --> 02:12:14,214
All I know is,

2073
02:12:14,283 --> 02:12:17,150
if Walter hadn't
come back for me

2074
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:20,750
<i>I don't think I ever would've
gotten out of there.</i>

2075
02:12:21,657 --> 02:12:23,022
Okay.

2076
02:12:24,293 --> 02:12:26,454
So, what happened
after that?

2077
02:12:26,528 --> 02:12:28,223
I kept off
the main roads,

2078
02:12:28,297 --> 02:12:33,257
until I saw a train stopped
at a crossing and I jumped in.

2079
02:12:33,669 --> 02:12:36,729
Why didn't you tell
anyone what had happened?

2080
02:12:36,805 --> 02:12:38,272
I was afraid.

2081
02:12:38,774 --> 02:12:41,743
I thought they'd come
after me, or my folks.

2082
02:12:43,545 --> 02:12:45,979
<i>So, I just didn't</i>
<i>tell anybody.</i>

2083
02:12:47,850 --> 02:12:52,048
I was on my own until I got a free
meal from this lady, Miss Lansing.

2084
02:12:52,121 --> 02:12:54,612
Told her I was an
orphan, on my own.

2085
02:12:56,592 --> 02:12:58,583
She said I could stay on.

2086
02:13:00,029 --> 02:13:01,360
And I did.

2087
02:13:02,598 --> 02:13:03,963
<i>Every night,</i>

2088
02:13:04,033 --> 02:13:07,469
I'd wake up thinking they
were right outside my window.

2089
02:13:08,003 --> 02:13:10,471
And then I heard the
police talking on the radio

2090
02:13:10,539 --> 02:13:13,303
about what happened
at the ranch.

2091
02:13:13,409 --> 02:13:15,775
And I thought, "For sure
I can't go back now."

2092
02:13:15,844 --> 02:13:17,311
Why?

2093
02:13:17,846 --> 02:13:18,904
Why not?

2094
02:13:18,981 --> 02:13:21,779
Since I didn't tell
anybody what happened.

2095
02:13:23,152 --> 02:13:25,916
I was afraid they'd blame
me for those kids being dead.

2096
02:13:27,823 --> 02:13:29,688
So I just stayed away.

2097
02:13:31,427 --> 02:13:34,419
What made you come forward
now, after all this time?

2098
02:13:34,496 --> 02:13:37,056
Hmm? Why come
forward now?

2099
02:13:40,636 --> 02:13:42,399
I really miss my mom.

2100
02:13:44,807 --> 02:13:46,707
I really miss my dad.

2101
02:13:49,745 --> 02:13:51,713
I just wanna go home.

2102
02:13:55,117 --> 02:13:56,914
<i>I just wanna go home.</i>

2103
02:14:02,925 --> 02:14:04,688
Are you all right?

2104
02:14:05,361 --> 02:14:07,556
I love you.

2105
02:14:40,062 --> 02:14:41,825
I still can't believe it.

2106
02:14:41,897 --> 02:14:45,799
Five years, case closed, everyone
thinks he's dead, and there he is.

2107
02:14:47,302 --> 02:14:50,066
Wouldn't be, if it
wasn't for Walter.

2108
02:14:51,740 --> 02:14:54,300
Your son did a brave
thing, Mrs. Collins.

2109
02:14:54,376 --> 02:14:56,571
You should be
very proud of him.

2110
02:14:56,645 --> 02:14:57,976
I am.

2111
02:15:00,315 --> 02:15:01,873
You still think
he's out there?

2112
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:03,178
Why not?

2113
02:15:04,420 --> 02:15:06,388
Three boys made a run for
it that night, Detective.

2114
02:15:06,455 --> 02:15:07,979
And if one got out,

2115
02:15:08,057 --> 02:15:11,151
then maybe either or both
of the others did, too.

2116
02:15:11,226 --> 02:15:14,787
Maybe Walter's out there, having
the same fears that he did.

2117
02:15:14,897 --> 02:15:16,762
Afraid to come home
and identify himself,

2118
02:15:16,832 --> 02:15:19,232
or afraid he'll get
into trouble.

2119
02:15:20,669 --> 02:15:22,762
But either way,

2120
02:15:22,838 --> 02:15:25,966
it gives me something I
didn't have before tonight.

2121
02:15:26,075 --> 02:15:27,474
What's that?

2122
02:15:28,444 --> 02:15:29,638
Hope.

2123
02:18:56,496 --> 02:18:57,496
