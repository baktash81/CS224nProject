1
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:15,149
Leaving this to come see you.

2
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,574
And I can't wait.

3
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,982
Taxi! Over here.

4
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,733
Taxi!

5
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,319
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

6
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,529
Excuse me. Excuse me.

7
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,639
Gilpin!

8
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,597
You still on the toothpaste? Are you on your phone?

9
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,399
I'm just-- I'm going home for the holidays tonight, so...

10
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,524
Does it look like tonight to you?
Because to me, it looks like today.

11
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,106
-Finish the toothpaste.
-Okay. Sorry.

12
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,804
Dad, we're home!

13
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,480
I'm in the kitchen!

14
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,274
Jan, Spencer!

15
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,851
In the kitchen!

16
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,565
Dad, are you on a ladder?

17
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,945
-What are you doing?
Grandpa.

18
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,491
-What's it look like?
-Get down.

19
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,910
I'm changing your light bulb.

20
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,113
I leave you alone for 10 minutes, you're climbing ladders?

21
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,825
-I don't think you should be doing that.
-What? Think I can't change a light bulb?

22
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,284
-Okay.
-There.

23
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,881
-No, no, no. I got it. I'm fine.
-Okay.

24
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,424
Hey, kiddo.

25
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,003
Hey, how's New York City?

26
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,843
-It's great.
-How's school?

27
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,596
It's okay. How you doing?

28
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,847
-I'm terrific. I don't even know what I'm doing here.
-You're recovering from hip surgery.

29
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,646
-I'll be out of here in no time.
-It's not a prison.

30
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,353
I want to get back to my apartment. Is that so terrible?

31
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,563
Your apartment? Yes, it's terrible.

32
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,193
Is it really cold in here?

33
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,402
Yeah, the downstairs heater isn't working.
The guy's coming in the morning.

34
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,578
It's like a goddamn icebox.

35
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,993
Did you ever call Milo?

36
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,699
-What? No.
-Dad.

37
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,035
He's called five times. Would you just call him back?

38
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,666
I'm not calling him back because I don't wanna talk to him.

39
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,836
Come on, I'll help you with your bags.

40
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,545
Oh, you're staying in here.

41
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,051
We're roommates.

42
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,509
Yeah. I could just stay downstairs on the couch.

43
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,719
-What? Don't be ridiculous.
-If you want, yeah.

44
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,557
It's a couple weeks. It's gonna be fine.
Come on in. Make yourself comfortable.

45
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,895
You're gonna...

46
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,151
-You okay?
-Don't tell your mother!

47
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,534
This goes there.

48
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,281
There.

49
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,783
That's in there.

50
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:37,330
All right, let's try it. Okay, let's see. All right, so there's that.

51
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,206
There's this. There's this.

52
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,585
The blue light, the red, the green light.

53
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,503
Oh, look at you two. How sweet is this?

54
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,885
Okay, I have to leave for work before either of you gets up.

55
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,762
But the heater guy's coming in the morning.

56
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,933
-I think I'm gonna meet my friends for brunch at 10.
-That'll be nice. Where are you going?

57
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,854
-Nora's.
-What are you going there for?

58
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,311
All the restaurants in Brantford, you gotta go to that one?

59
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,316
-I didn't pick.
-What difference does it make?

60
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,023
It's been years, okay?

61
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,485
-I love you, honey. I'm so glad you're home.
-Love you too, Mom.

62
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,710
Getting old sucks. Don't let anybody tell you any different.

63
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,955
You still got that little girlfriend?

64
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,631
No.

65
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,668
We're not together anymore.

66
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,968
I don't think.

67
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,929
Was it her or you?

68
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,559
-It's complicated.
-Try me. We'll see if I can understand.

69
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,763
Well, when we first got together,

70
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,144
we were...

71
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,818
sort of different people than we are now.

72
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,700
I mean, last year was...

73
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,572
amazing.

74
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,574
I was a senior in high school.

75
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,281
I had a girlfriend.

76
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,790
Like, I finally figured out who I was or something.

77
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,331
I wish I could just feel like that again, I guess.

78
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,514
I don't know. Long-distance relationships are hard.

79
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,138
I mean, I know everybody says that, but turns out it's true.

80
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,897
Can I give you a little advice? Listen to me.

81
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:27,820
Every single day on every single subway car,
there's lots of ladies in New York City.

82
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:32,571
And one in five of them, I would marry, no questions asked.

83
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,868
This is the best time of your life.

84
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,829
-It is?
-Yes, it is.

85
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,908
So pull it together! Because it doesn't get any better than this.

86
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,289
It's all downhill from here.

87
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,008
Bravestone.

88
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,236
-Hi!
-Hi!

89
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,197
-Hey.
-Oh, gosh, how are you?

90
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,151
-Oh, my God, you look amazing.
-Thank you.

91
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,412
-Fridge.
-Fridge!

92
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,910
Come here.

93
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,458
So we were building houses for two months,

94
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:51,547
and then on the way home,
we stopped in Costa Rica, which was also amazing.

95
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,920
That is so awesome. I am so happy for you.

96
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,125
That is so cool.

97
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,761
So, "M," that's what we're supposed to call you now?

98
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,842
You don't have to. It's just a nickname.
One of my college friends gave me that.

99
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,268
You don't have to call me that if you don't want to.

100
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,437
M. I love it. It's so hot.

101
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,483
-Okay.
-But you and Spencer, you're still not...?

102
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,107
Yeah. No. We're-- We're still, like, taking a break.

103
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,274
Where is he, by the way?

104
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,174
Christ.

105
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,597
What do you want, Milo?

106
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,425
Nice to see you too.

107
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:50,185
Yes, I'd love to come in for a cup of coffee.

108
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,811
Thanks for asking.

109
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,106
You mind if I make some eggs?

110
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,864
Do whatever you want. I don't care.
Just hurry up. I don't have all day.

111
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,240
You going somewhere?

112
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,995
Have...?

113
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,454
Have you been in touch with Spencer much?

114
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,458
Yeah...

115
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,507
You know what?

116
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,009
Not really, actually.

117
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,589
I text him a lot, but he doesn't always text me back.

118
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,798
-I know.
-It's just--

119
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:28,807
I've been crazed lately with, you know, classes and practices,

120
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,513
and I got games on the weekends.

121
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,314
Yeah. Totally. Totally.

122
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,610
I've just-- I've been-- I've been a little worried about him.

123
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,201
Okay, look, where--? Where is this guy? For real.

124
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:48,997
Good?

125
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,667
What do you mean, "Meh"?

126
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,454
What do you want already?

127
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,382
You've been calling and calling.
You show up out of the blue after 15 years.

128
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,177
Why? Because you wanna make some eggs?

129
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,184
You remember when we first opened,

130
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,433
we had that little dishwasher, Morris?

131
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,848
Yeah, of course I remember Morris.

132
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,900
Worked the dinner shift.

133
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,819
Six days a week, 2 in the morning most nights.

134
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,152
-The dishwasher.
-Little Morris.

135
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,744
He wouldn't even touch those saucepans until he was done

136
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,040
with every single utensil in the bin.

137
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,501
The man knew his craft.

138
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,954
Little Morris.

139
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,213
Well, get--

140
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,764
Just get to it, would you?
I mean, it's always the scenic route with you.

141
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,592
I know what you want, you want to apologise.

142
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,930
And I hate to tell you, I'm not interested.

143
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,811
You think I'm supposed to apologise to you?

144
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,895
Oh, heater guy.

145
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,943
-Grandpa Eddie?
-Anthony?

146
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,148
Yes, sir, it's me.

147
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,984
Anthony!

148
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,284
How are you?

149
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,157
Come on in. Come on in.

150
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,788
-How you doing?
-Oh, getting old sucks.

151
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,495
Don't ever let anybody tell you any different.

152
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,583
Oh, this is Martha and Bethany.
This is Spencer's grandfather, Eddie.

153
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,463
Martha? You're the little girlfriend.

154
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,762
-Morning!
-Morning, sir.

155
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,465
Sorry to barge in on you.

156
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,846
You're not barging. He's barging.

157
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,051
Milo Walker.

158
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,890
-Wait, Milo? Like-- Like Milo and Eddie's.
-Pleased to meet you.

159
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,601
Man, my dad said you guys had the best restaurant in town.

160
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,403
We were just there. Well, it's called Nora's now.

161
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,817
Nora's. It's barely even a restaurant.
It's more like a breakfast place now.

162
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:55,077
-Were you with Spencer?
-No, we came here looking for him, actually.

163
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,249
You all hungry?

164
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,373
-Eggs on the griddle.
-Might have to take a look.

165
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:03,214
-Hey, man, you can do more than take a look at it.
-All right, all right. My man.

166
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,089
-Do you need a hand?
-Do I look like I need a hand?

167
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:16,887
Martha?

168
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:21,900
Hey.

169
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:24,853
Where is he?

170
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,536
-Do you hear that?
-Yes.

171
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,998
You hear something?

172
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,334
It's probably the heater, it's broken.

173
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,973
How did it even get here?

174
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,801
I don't know.

175
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,684
Maybe he-- I don't know,
maybe he went back for it or something?

176
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,067
Is he trying to fix it?

177
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,736
Why would anyone try to fix that thing?

178
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,484
I don't know.

179
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,657
I don't know. Maybe he went to buy parts or something?

180
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,655
Okay, I'm calling him again.

181
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,784
I'm sure everything's... fine.

182
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,180
Fourteen texts and four missed calls.

183
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,014
I don't think he went out.

184
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,937
I think...

185
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,982
I think he went back in.

186
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:54,072
-No, no, no.
-What? No. Why--?

187
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,654
-Come on. Remember what it was like?
-Why would he do that?

188
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,785
-I got eaten by a fricking hippo!
-I got killed by a piece of cake!

189
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,786
Guys, guys.

190
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,284
How is he gonna get out?

191
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,169
He's gotta take the-- The green jewel.

192
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,671
And stick it back in the statue thing.

193
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,922
By himself?

194
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,609
We gotta go get him.

195
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,152
Are you crazy?

196
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,446
-I'm coming with you.
-Are you out of your minds?

197
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,321
We can do this. We've been there. We know what to expect.

198
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,779
I gotta stop hanging out with white people.
I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.

199
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:43,037
-She's right. We played before and we won.
-We barely survived!

200
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,617
You know he would do it for you.

201
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,995
For any of us.

202
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,839
Be careful. It looks pretty busted.

203
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,137
Welcome to Jumanji.

204
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,691
What...? We haven't even picked our guys yet!

205
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,518
What?

206
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,440
Okay, okay. Here we go. Oh, I hate this part. All right. Okay.

207
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,403
This is not happening!

208
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,085
You guys?

209
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,420
No!

210
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,319
Am I--?

211
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,155
Is it--? I can't believe--

212
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,408
Oh, it's her.

213
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,489
I'm her.

214
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,130
Spencer.

215
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,462
Spencer?

216
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,595
What in tarnation?

217
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,096
Where am I?

218
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,807
What the hell is this?

219
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,314
Oh, my God.

220
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,482
Eddie?

221
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,980
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm Milo Walker. Who are you?

222
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,610
Milo?

223
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,408
What on earth? What--?

224
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,781
-What the--?
-Oh, my.

225
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:43,987
Wait a minute.

226
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,571
Oh, Lord.

227
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,998
-This isn't happening.
-Pardon me?

228
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,203
-Who are you?
-You're Spencer's grandfather.

229
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,460
-Yeah, no kidding.
-And you are Milo.

230
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,961
I certainly am.

231
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,259
I'm Martha, Spencer's...

232
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,882
You're the little girlfriend?

233
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,096
-Look out!
-What?

234
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,392
Oh, Lord.

235
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,143
-That hurt like a goddamn--
-Bethany?

236
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,436
What? I'm not--

237
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,312
No.

238
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,863
No,no,no.

239
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,110
Yo!

240
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:25,071
Oh, no, no, no. This can't be happening!

241
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,120
Fridge?

242
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,745
Yes, I'm Fridge, goddamn it! The hell, man?

243
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,284
Okay.

244
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,711
Okay, something went wrong.

245
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:34,708
You think?!

246
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,126
Holy...

247
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,052
Wait.

248
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,596
If I'm-- Then you--?

249
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,892
-Spencer?
-Why does everybody keep calling me Spencer?

250
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,718
No, that is Grandpa Eddie.

251
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,555
And that... is Milo.

252
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,105
Pleased to meet you.

253
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,227
What?!

254
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,569
-Then where's Bethany? And where's Spencer?
-I don't know! Okay?

255
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,943
The game, it didn't let us pick our avatars, so--

256
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,899
Because it's busted!
-Yeah, okay.

257
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,324
Are we dead?

258
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,154
You know, I was just wondering the same thing.

259
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:12,084
Did I die and turn into some kind
of a small, muscular Boy Scout?

260
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,165
-We're not dead.
-80 then what's going on here?

261
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:21,047
Okay, this is gonna sound very strange,
but we are in a video game called Jumanji,

262
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:25,756
and we are in the bodies of video game characters.

263
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,683
-And we've been here before, Fridge and I.
-Last time, I was you.

264
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,303
We're in a game!

265
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,560
We gotta find Spencer because he's in here too.

266
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,770
-Spencer?
-Yes.

267
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,647
-He's here?
-Yes.

268
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,354
Spencer, Eddie's grandson?

269
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,280
Yes. Spencer.

270
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,856
He's here too?

271
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,283
-Yes!
-Yes! He's here, and we gotta find him.

272
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,782
So it's like a hide-and-go-seek situation.

273
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,905
I'm not "it."

274
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,712
My hip feels pretty good now.

275
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,792
Oh, my joints feel like butter.

276
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,721
Oh, yeah, look at those.

277
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,424
Look at these. Look at what I got.

278
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,594
-We have some issues here.
-You're telling me this?

279
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,396
I'm the old fat dude.

280
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,602
I came back, and things actually got worse.
At least last time I was still black.

281
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,151
Look at this little fella.

282
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,362
Hello there.

283
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,694
Mr Walker, don't get too close to the water!

284
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,996
-Get away from there!
-I'm sorry, what'd you say?

285
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:37,997
Hey!

286
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,172
Get on out of here!

287
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,170
-What just happened?
-What the hell was that thing?!

288
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:54,765
Well, that there was a hippopotamus.

289
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,272
And they are awfully fast.

290
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,101
Faster than a horse, if you can believe that.

291
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,733
And they've got an awful ferocious bite.

292
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,189
How about that?

293
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,776
You know, the funny thing is, I don't remember...

294
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,363
knowing much about hippos until right now.

295
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,913
You're a zoologist.

296
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,742
-I'm sorry, what now?
-Are we in Florida?

297
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,002
Just listen.

298
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,581
This is a dangerous place.

299
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,961
Crazy dangerous.

300
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,134
But Martha and I, we've been here before.
We know what we're doing.

301
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,430
You gotta stay alert all the time.

302
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:34,510
If I'm near water, I got one eye on the water, you hear me?

303
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,095
You got to have eyes in the back of your--

304
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,518
Oh, God.

305
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,731
What in the Sam Hill just happened to him?

306
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,664
-Shut the front door.
-What the hell happened to you?!

307
00:22:58,836 --> 00:22:59,951
Damn!

308
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,042
A plane?

309
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,040
What?

310
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,844
-Come on! Follow me!
-Come on, let's go. Let's go. Follow us.

311
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,438
Welcome to Jumanji.

312
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,686
-Why is he in a plane?
-I don't know.

313
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,858
Well, don't just stand there. Hop in!

314
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,862
Strap in. There's no time to spare.

315
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:40,117
Dr Bravestone, famed archaeologist
and international explorer,

316
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,871
I'm so glad you've returned.

317
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,044
I've been so anxious for your arrival.

318
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,205
-You talking to me?
-Yes.

319
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,838
Once again, Jumanji is in great peril and only you can help.

320
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,887
Nigel, we're looking for our friend.
Have you seen, like, anyone--?

321
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,182
Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men, welcome to Jumanji.

322
00:23:56,727 --> 00:24:00,436
-"Killer of men"?
-Yeah, I-- I kill guys.

323
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,561
I'm so glad you've returned.
I've been so anxious for your arrival.

324
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:08,566
-What's with this fella?
-My dearest Mouse, surely you remember me.

325
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,363
Nigel Billingsly at your service.

326
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,941
Hey. Nigel, I thought that was you.

327
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,617
He's a-- What is it called?

328
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,992
-NPC, a non-player character.
-He's not a real person.

329
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,745
He only has, like, a limited number of things he can say.

330
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,494
My friend Carl is just like that.

331
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,204
Nigel, we're looking for someone.

332
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,507
-Has anyone else arrived here in Jumanji--?
-Jumanji is in great peril.

333
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,255
It's all detailed in the letter I sent you, Dr Bravestone.

334
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,928
Perhaps you should read it aloud.

335
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,421
Grandpa Eddie.

336
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,511
Do you have a letter?

337
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,763
-Do I have a letter?
-Check your pockets.

338
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,720
-Why would I have a letter?
-Because Nigel wrote you a letter.

339
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,397
I didn't get a letter from this guy.

340
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,397
-But we are in a video game, and--
-We're in a video game?

341
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,568
We're gonna die.

342
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,612
-We did die.
-Are we in hell?

343
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,110
-I knew it.
-Oh, my God.

344
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,692
It's all detailed in the letter I sent you, Dr Bravestone.

345
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,198
-Perhaps you should read it aloud.
-I don't have a letter!

346
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:02,623
-How many times I gotta tell you that?
-Oh, no, Eddie. It's in your hand.

347
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,747
Where did this come from?

348
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,956
You got to pay attention to what's in your hand.

349
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,539
Perhaps you should read it aloud.

350
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,218
"Dr Bravestone,

351
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:20,095
it is my solemn hope that this letter finds you, for again..."

352
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,554
Jumanji is in grave danger. We need your help at once.

353
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,810
-What's going on here?
-It's a cutscene.

354
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,437
It's how we find out the-— I'll explain afterwards.

355
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,737
You see, our worst nightmare has come to pass,

356
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,941
for Jurgen the Brutal has returned.

357
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:39,278
Indeed, that most vicious Jumanjian conqueror is back.

358
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,747
And he's brought with him his savage horde.

359
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,414
They descended from their fortress atop Mount Zhatmire

360
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,417
and made their way south to the Avian Province,

361
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,295
home of the sacred Falcon Jewel,

362
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,673
worn around the neck of the village elder.

363
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,176
The Falcon is the fertility jewel of Jumanji,

364
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:03,885
and it has been guarded by the people
of the Avian Province for hundreds of years.

365
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,186
So long as the jewel can see the sun,

366
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,436
the waters Will flow and the land Will flourish.

367
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,986
Yeah!

368
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:32,038
Many brave souls died that day,
but Jurgen got What he came for.

369
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,464
He stowed the jewel in darkness,

370
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,041
hidden from the sun.

371
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,809
A drought befell the land.

372
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,016
The crops dried out and died.

373
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,570
And if the jewel is not returned soon, it may be too late.

374
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,733
Which is Why we called for you and your brilliant associates.

375
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:03,866
I understand the enormous weight
that this must carry for you, Dr Bravestone,

376
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,993
how this adventure is like no other,

377
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,162
since it was Jurgen the Brutal

378
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,244
who killed your parents.

379
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,257
No, no, no!

380
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,299
He killed Dr Bravestone's parents?

381
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,722
Indeed, he did. When the doctor was just a boy.

382
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,800
Oh, well, that's terrible.

383
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,350
I can't say this enough:

384
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,848
We're in a video game.

385
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,148
You must recover the jewel
from Jurgen the Brutal and Show it to the sun.

386
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,023
He's making his way north across the desert now.

387
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,980
Jurgen the Brutal. Is that Barbara's boy?

388
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,361
And remember, the goal is to recover the loot.

389
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,362
To wrest it from the hands of the Brute.

390
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:47,447
And if you wish to leave the game,
you must save Jumanji and call out its name.

391
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,622
Excuse me.

392
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,953
Who is Jumanji?

393
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,503
Well, if I was listening correctly, that is her sister.

394
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,580
Here's your map.

395
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:01,086
Find an oasis and follow the flame to the desert fruit.

396
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:05,097
-I can't land here, so you're going to have to drop in.
-What?

397
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,970
-No, no. Nigel--
-I'll get as low as I can.

398
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,050
-Hold on.
-Get ready.

399
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,179
-What do you mean?
-We don't have parachutes. Shouldn't we have--?

400
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,014
-What the hell?!
-Good luck.

401
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,145
The future of Jumanji is in your hands.

402
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,395
-Why did we take a plane if there's nowhere to land?
-And go!

403
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,303
The hell, man?!

404
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,603
Where are we?

405
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,359
Where's the jungle?

406
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,283
-What are we doing here?!
-We've got to keep it together, okay?

407
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,860
-"Keep it together"?
-Yes.

408
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:11,493
This is a whole new thing.
Nobody said we'd have to do a whole new thing.

409
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,450
And by the way, what the hell happened to Bethany?

410
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,606
So, what part of New Hampshire is this exactly?

411
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,650
We're not in New Hampshire, Milo.

412
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,854
That's right. Exactly. Not New Hampshire.
You're starting to get it now?

413
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,282
Nope. I don't have the foggiest clue what's going on here.

414
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,111
That guy kept calling me Dr Braverman,
which is the name of my orthopaedist.

415
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,706
What I'm thinking is, I just had another hip surgery
and now I'm coming out of it.

416
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,124
Hey!

417
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,122
Check this out!

418
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,916
Okay.

419
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,547
We have to find Spencer.

420
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,345
In order to do that, I think we have to start playing the game.

421
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,638
I'm sure that's what he did.

422
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,935
We find him, we finish the game and we go home.

423
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,478
Ed, you okay?

424
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,184
Would you look at me?

425
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,724
I'm back.

426
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,820
-I mean, I haven't looked like this since--
-Never.

427
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,022
You looked like this never.

428
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,404
What? When I was younger, I was in great shape.

429
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:34,705
I remember you when you were younger,
and this is not what you looked like.

430
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,873
I think my eyes are a different colour.

431
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,827
All of you is a different colour.

432
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,628
It's a good look on me, huh?

433
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,590
Okay. They're headed north.

434
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,964
-Which way is north?
-I have no idea.

435
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:51,719
-Well, you wanna check the map?
-Right. I'm the map guy now.

436
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,802
"Find an oasis and follow the flame to the desert fruit."

437
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,729
Follow the flame to the desert fruit.

438
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,728
-You know there is nothing on that?
-He can see it, you can't.

439
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,152
Each place on the map is a different level,
and the levels get harder as we go.

440
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,280
This one is called...

441
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,449
"Dunes."

442
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,196
No shit.

443
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,995
Who the hell is that?

444
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,829
That's an ostrich.

445
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:24,789
Oh, no.

446
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,796
Yes, indeed.

447
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,550
That is an ostrich.

448
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,632
The ostrich is a flightless bird,

449
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,013
one of 60 species.

450
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:41,814
You got the penguin, you got the emu and you got the kiwi.

451
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,107
Funny thing is, I don't remember knowing--

452
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,400
You're a zoologist.

453
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,899
I was a zoologist last time. It's an important job.

454
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,230
Maybe if we could get through this a little quicker.

455
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:55,286
Well, another thing is,
they can run up to 45 miles per hour,

456
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:59,036
which makes them the world's fastest two-legged animal.

457
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,582
Did you know that?

458
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,125
Fascinating.

459
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,172
-What a magnificent creature.
-We should get out of here.

460
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,418
What else do you know about them?

461
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:14,881
Well, here's another interesting fact,
they have three stomachs.

462
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,136
How about that?

463
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,682
Come on. Beat it!

464
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,433
Don't get so close.

465
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,858
Just a bird, okay? Come on, get moving. Get out of here.

466
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,276
-Is there anything else we need to know?
-Beat it, bird.

467
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,695
Another interesting thing about the ostrich...

468
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,773
I said scram, you stupid bird!

469
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,950
-...is when threatened...
-Get out of here!

470
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,117
...they attack.

471
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,489
Oh, my!

472
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,660
Eddie! Eddie!

473
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,288
Where's Eddie? Is he dead?

474
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,247
-No!
-Yes.

475
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,002
Yes, he died, but he's fine.

476
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,882
Did I just kill Eddie...

477
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,633
by talking too slow...

478
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,928
like he always said I would?

479
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,980
Why does everybody keep dropping from the sky?!

480
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,906
Nurse, I'm gonna need
to see Dr Braverman right now, please.

481
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,947
I'm not your nurse. Okay, listen.

482
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,867
These tattoos on our arms, that is your life count.

483
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,743
We each have three lives.

484
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,330
You and Fridge each have two left.

485
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,006
If you lose all three,

486
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,800
listen to me, it is game over.

487
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:38,006
-That's it. You're dead.
-Dead like... "kaputski"?

488
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,464
Yes.

489
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,765
Kaputski.

490
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,143
What the hell is that?

491
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,816
-That's not good.
-Look.

492
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,987
There's one more thing about ostriches.

493
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,071
Oh, no.

494
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,280
Say it!

495
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,707
They travel in herds.

496
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,331
We gotta get out of here!

497
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,133
-Dune buggies, let's go!
-Come on, come on! Shake a leg!

498
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,087
-Why am I so slow?
-Haul ass, girl. Let's go!

499
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,422
-Come on, come on, come on!
-I'm coming, Eddie. Go.

500
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,848
Do you see the key anywhere?

501
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,643
-Okay, how do I do this?
-I don't know. I've never driven one of these before!

502
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,482
Maybe under the dash.

503
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,601
Green button!

504
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,731
Green button. Go.

505
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,108
Go, go, go!

506
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,524
Go, go.

507
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,034
Oh, my God!

508
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:02,889
Go.

509
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,927
You are a terrible driver.

510
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,104
-What are you talking about? We're fine.
-Nobody fine. You--

511
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,433
Oh, no.

512
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,984
Oh, help!

513
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,988
Hold on, Eddie. Please don't let go.

514
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,158
Oh, help.

515
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,283
Help. Eddie.

516
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:35,998
Beat it!

517
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,458
Get out of here!

518
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,763
I think we lost them.

519
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,885
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

520
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,775
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

521
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:06,908
Oh, no.

522
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,331
-What do we do?
-I don't know!

523
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,550
Get in! Hurry!

524
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,062
Suckers!

525
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,480
Eddie...

526
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,205
Oh, dear.

527
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,534
What do we do?

528
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,914
What do we do?!

529
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,507
What are you doing?

530
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,928
-Birds, birds, birds!
-Birds!

531
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,431
-What the hell, man?!
-They're flightless birds.

532
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,812
This is a flightless dune buggy!

533
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:20,856
Oh, no!

534
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,989
No, no, no!

535
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,906
-We're not gonna make it.
-We're gonna make it.

536
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,111
No, we're not!

537
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,412
-I don't think we're gonna make it.
-We're gonna make it.

538
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,337
We're not gonna make it.

539
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,722
That was fantastic.

540
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,853
Horrible driver.

541
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,853
Yeah, you see that, birds?

542
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,026
You don't mess with the kid. Right there!

543
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,107
Did you see me?

544
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,109
I was incredible.

545
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,029
I mean, I saved you, I saved you,

546
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,583
I saved this guy from a bird while I was driving a car.

547
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,036
I was a machine. I was relentless.

548
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,916
-I was fearless.
-Yes. Exactly. Fearless.

549
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,252
That's Bravestone. Okay, check this out.

550
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,720
Oh, goodness.

551
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,885
-What the hell?
-It's your strengths and weaknesses.

552
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:38,643
I-- I mean your avatar,
Dr Bravestone's strengths and weaknesses.

553
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,519
"Fearless," check.

554
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,068
"Speed. Climbing. Boomerang"?

555
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,021
"Smouldering intensity"?

556
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,322
It's this stupid face you make.

557
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,616
There it is.

558
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,790
Old man. Get it together.

559
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,369
Eddie, you okay? You having a heart attack?

560
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,793
His whole left side is shutting down. Eddie, look at me!

561
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,500
-Yeah?
-There you go. Now you're back.

562
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,053
"Weakness: switchblade."

563
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,506
Switchblade? Hey, that's new.

564
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,760
-Bravestone didn't have any weaknesses last time.
-Yeah, bugged the hell out of me.

565
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:17,678
I wonder if...

566
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,609
"Nunchucks"?

567
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,527
That's new.

568
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,901
-Damn, that's a good list.
-Milo, push on your left, like, chest area.

569
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,863
-I'm sorry, what?
-Come on, man.

570
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,160
Hey!

571
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,363
Oh, I got one too. What--?

572
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,824
My. "Zoology."

573
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:43,963
-That's what you were talking about earlier.
-Yes. Exactly. Your avatar is a zoologist.

574
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:49,134
You know, my nephew Maxwell is a veterinarian.
What a fascinating--

575
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,507
-"Linguistics"?
-I didn't have that last time.

576
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,930
-The study of languages.
-Makes sense.

577
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:57,180
He studies the entire language on his way to the point.

578
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,433
Anyway, he's 32. Or is he 35?

579
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,436
-Time does fly.
-Okay, let's get it over with.

580
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,446
You gotta be kidding me.

581
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,899
Well, geometry is...

582
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,449
-Is new.
-Yeah.

583
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,652
Who wouldn't want to be better at geometry?

584
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,034
And for weaknesses, "Endurance."

585
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,038
And what else? Let's see, "Heat, sun and sand."

586
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,003
Shouldn't be a problem.

587
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,924
It's not like we're in the middle
of a goddamn desert or anything.

588
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,628
What's the point of this guy? Who even needs this guy?

589
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:36,010
-He can read the map.
-Easy for you to say, you got nunchucks!

590
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,343
I've been training four hours a day for six months.

591
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,223
Now look at me!

592
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,851
Man, it is hot out here!

593
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,685
How is this guy a character in an adventure game?

594
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,482
Okay, okay, okay.

595
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,486
I just gotta get this guy in shape
and build up some endurance.

596
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,737
I know how to do that.

597
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,443
Burpees. Five burpees, right now.

598
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,777
Get it going!

599
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,494
-That's one.
-One!

600
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,920
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah, come on!

601
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,512
North is that way!

602
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:29,768
You know, it's...

603
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,275
-It's really good to see you, Ed.
-I don't wanna hear it.

604
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,823
You don't wanna hear that it's good to see you?

605
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,528
-You sold me out, Milo.
-I did not sell you out.

606
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,738
We sold our business. It was time.

607
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,200
-Yeah, time for who?
-Well, it was time for me.

608
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:49,163
Okay? Standing on my feet,
serving a hundred plates a night for 35 years?

609
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,463
I was done.

610
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,083
I was ready, man.

611
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,918
I was ready to retire.

612
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,299
I'm done talking!

613
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,898
"The Oasis."

614
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,194
I guess that's the next level.

615
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,156
The next level of the game.

616
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,661
We're in a game?

617
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,995
-Yes, Grandpa Eddie, we are in a game.
-You can't be serious.

618
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,499
Did you know about this?

619
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,501
I thought you were done talking.

620
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,428
-Bethany?
-Yep.

621
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,269
-My name's Bethany too.
-Really?

622
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,396
Daddy, her name's Bethany too.

623
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,781
Sure is, sweetie.

624
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,693
Can I talk to you for a minute?

625
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,618
Sure, yeah. Come in.

626
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,377
I'm sorry, I just-- I didn't know where else to go.

627
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,249
No, no, no, it's okay.

628
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,956
I'm glad you came.

629
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,293
Do you think you can help me get the machine to start?

630
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,263
That is so dangerous.

631
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,306
I know.

632
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,847
But I have to try.

633
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,263
They're my team.

634
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,405
So, what exactly are we looking for again?

635
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,240
We're looking for my grandson, genius.

636
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,326
Okay, "Follow the flame to the desert fruit."

637
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,414
Look.

638
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,674
They're here.

639
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,377
Hyenas.

640
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,179
Unusual for their bone-crushing teeth.

641
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:07,892
Smoke Stack.

642
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,770
Where there's smoke...

643
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:11,938
There's fire.

644
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:13,977
Come on.

645
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,526
You call that a roll?

646
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,401
-Not bad at all.
-I'll bet you two more, fellas!

647
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,653
Drinks! Drinks over here!

648
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,322
Another round here!

649
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,369
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

650
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,091
I thought you'd never come back.

651
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,554
I need to talk to you.

652
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,266
Absolutely.

653
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,898
Not here, not now.

654
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,354
Not around them.

655
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,070
Leave me alone!

656
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,787
Fiery.

657
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,839
Not a real person.

658
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:20,882
What'd she say?

659
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,380
She said she thought I was never gonna come back here,

660
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,429
she wants to get together later,
and we all know what that means.

661
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,883
It means that she's got a clue for you.

662
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,344
Oh, that's a coincidence because I got a clue for her.

663
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,099
-You got a clue for her.
-Wait a minute.

664
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,148
She's your ex-girlfriend. She's the flame.

665
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,021
-"Follow the flame."
-What?

666
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,325
The jewel, it's here.

667
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,382
Wait, is that the guy that killed my parents?

668
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,934
No. Well, yeah. Kind of.

669
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,768
We lost a good man today.

670
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,600
The very best of us.

671
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,479
For Dagfinn...

672
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,735
wasn't just my hyena master.

673
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,735
He was my friend.

674
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,695
I loved him like a brother.

675
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,832
And now he's gone.

676
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,293
And his beloved hyenas are left

677
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,041
without their master.

678
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,588
Long live Dagfinn.

679
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,592
Long live Dagfinn!

680
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,923
Why did he have to die?

681
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,719
He died because...

682
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,350
he made a mistake.

683
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:02,359
He tried to steal something quite precious from me.

684
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,353
He left me no choice.

685
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,359
And now...

686
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,903
I feed him to his beloved hyenas.

687
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,494
That's messed up.

688
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,498
I loved Dagfinn!

689
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,455
There's none among you I love as much.

690
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:26,632
And so...

691
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,389
The key!

692
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,766
It's gone.

693
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:38,887
Thief!

694
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,769
I got her. I got the thief.

695
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,442
Wait.

696
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,439
-Are you guys--?
-Come here.

697
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,105
-Catch her!
-Don't let her get away.

698
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,320
Trying to steal the key to my chest?

699
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,947
Nope.

700
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,616
Shake her down.

701
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,295
I'm sorry, I did it. It was my fault.

702
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,417
I...

703
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,253
I just--

704
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,959
I don't--

705
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,546
I don't know what I was... Oy vey.

706
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,263
It's like... It's like I'm hyperventilating.

707
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,011
Does anyone have, like, a eucalyptus inhaler?

708
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,847
Or a brown paper bag?

709
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:22,897
Spencer?

710
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,395
-Is it really hot in here?
-You mean...?

711
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,482
-That's him. Right there.
-What?

712
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,865
That ain't Spencer.
I know my grandson. My grandson's a guy.

713
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,952
Did he change his hair?

714
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,030
-Cut off her head.
-Yeah!

715
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,866
-Cut off her head!
-Wait, wait, wait.

716
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,076
I just think maybe don't cut off my head?

717
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,000
-Spencer!
-Oh, my.

718
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,797
-Did he just--?
-Oh, Lord.

719
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,296
That's my Life Alert.

720
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,877
I gotta take my pill.

721
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,726
Come on!

722
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:03,850
Spencer!

723
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,727
Oh, my God, you're alive.

724
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,683
What are you guys doing here?

725
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,566
What are we doing here? We came to get you, fool!

726
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,522
-Bethany?
-Not Bethany. Fridge, goddamn it!

727
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,774
What? So...

728
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,910
Milo Walker, darling.

729
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:20,705
Milo?

730
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,161
-Spencer? Is that you, kiddo?
Grandpa?

731
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:30,374
Guys, I found Spencer.
Here's Spencer. What are you stealing for?

732
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:32,713
I'm still me.

733
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:34,878
Hey.

734
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,134
-Hey.
-Hey.

735
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,223
Come on.

736
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,475
Let's go.

737
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,704
Damn it, I was so close. I had the key in my hand.

738
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,121
Why'd you stop me?

739
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,200
Someone yelled "thief," so I grabbed you.
What do you want?

740
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,787
You guys shouldn't have come here. I had it under control.

741
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,838
Did you? It looked like you just got murdered.

742
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,633
I mean, what the hell, Spencer? Why are you even here?

743
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,005
Why did you have the game?

744
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,178
We destroyed it so that this would never happen!

745
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,552
I went back and got it, okay?

746
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:23,886
I don't know why I did it, but I did.

747
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,845
And then last night...

748
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,350
I've been in kind of a weird place,
and something came over me, okay?

749
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,685
And now we're all stuck here again!

750
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,817
I thought that I would be him.

751
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,530
Bravestone!

752
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,738
I wanted to feel like that again.

753
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,580
Like... I could do anything.

754
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,242
But instead, I'm...

755
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,003
Ming Fleetfoot.

756
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,133
"Cat burglar, pickpocket, safecracker."

757
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,918
Another better character.

758
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,300
-"Weakness: pollen."
-Yeah.

759
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:04,510
She's small and crafty, and has allergies.
I mean, she's basically me.

760
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,388
I swear, man, if we survive, I am gonna kill you.

761
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,183
I just can't believe you came back here on purpose.

762
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,235
I'm sorry. Okay?

763
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,279
I'm sorry.

764
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:20,525
Wait!

765
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,075
Oh, there she is.

766
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,744
-Who?
-My ex.

767
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:25,496
Okay.

768
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,289
Hi.

769
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:31,828
If my husband knew I was talking to you,

770
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,504
you'd be dead by morning.

771
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,798
Don't tell him?

772
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:41,254
Listen to me, Jurgen and his army are returning
to his fortress.

773
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,591
There, they will meet the Brothers Kababik.

774
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:48,178
He will trade the Falcon Jewel, and an alliance will be formed.

775
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:51,810
You must get the jewel before that happens.

776
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,390
You're our only hope,

777
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,567
so you must hurry.

778
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:58,821
Oh, my.

779
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,235
-Now you must go.
-Gotta go.

780
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,287
-Wait, they're gonna meet the Brothers who?
-The Brothers Kababik.

781
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,364
The Brothers Bababik.

782
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:12,202
-Kababik?
-You must get the jewel before that happens.

783
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,755
You are our only hope, so you must hurry.

784
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,925
-I think you should explain it to us one more time.
-Wait a second.

785
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,553
What about the desert fruit? Aren't you gonna lead us to that?

786
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,104
Now I must go...

787
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,857
before Switchblade realises I'm gone.

788
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,518
What?

789
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,729
-Switchblade?
-That's his weakness.

790
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,737
I love you, Dr Bravestone.

791
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,074
And I always will.

792
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,029
That...

793
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,539
is my curse.

794
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,124
I love you too!

795
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,331
Well, she seems like a nice girl.

796
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,755
We need camels.

797
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:10,268
Okay, if we're gonna catch up with Jurgen, we need camels.

798
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:13,597
And we need to find the desert fruit, whatever that is.

799
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,183
"Follow the flame." I mean, I guess we have to follow her.

800
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,859
You guys follow her, we'll go steal some camels.

801
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,325
"Jumanji Berry Tree."

802
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,323
Jumanji berry?

803
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,745
That's a desert fruit?

804
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,948
I guess.

805
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:18,332
"In the moment of need, remember the seed."

806
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,250
A little bit of Jumanji wisdom there.

807
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:27,837
There it is.

808
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,094
Okay, Milo and I will break in and get the camels.

809
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,931
Grandpa, you stay here on lookout, all right?
Keep a low profile.

810
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,357
Got it? Low profile.

811
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:44,984
If anyone tries to enter the livery,
just, I don't know, whistle or something.

812
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,438
Sure thing.

813
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,202
That's not when you smoulder.

814
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,155
It's not the moment for it.

815
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,456
-Forget it.
-I just did it. I don't know what it was.

816
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,750
Look like your stomach is upset.

817
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,544
Like you ate something bad.

818
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,506
Oh, man.

819
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:07,130
I'm sweating.

820
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:12,091
Stealing makes me very uncomfortable,
which is not ideal for a burglar.

821
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,867
So the fruit is in the tree.

822
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:41,294
But you can't get to it without going
through the water or whatever that is.

823
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,250
Get boiled or eaten by piranhas or something.

824
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,509
"Follow the flame."

825
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,589
I think that's how we get there.

826
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,513
But I don't know how I'm supposed to make that jump.

827
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,219
I mean, it's doable...

828
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,601
but I don't have my usual explosiveness.

829
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,770
Yo!

830
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,704
Yes!

831
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,034
Martha!

832
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,711
Martha!

833
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,056
-Martha!
-Oh, it's really heavy.

834
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,136
You okay? Give me your hand.

835
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,061
There you go.

836
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,484
Wait a second.

837
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,702
-What...?
-The hell, man?

838
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,280
Oh, my God!

839
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,207
-The hell, man?!
-Oh, my God.

840
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,374
-Fridge?
-Yeah.

841
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,122
Martha?

842
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,041
Yeah.

843
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,549
Hey, move along. Nothing to see here.

844
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:20,843
What'd you say?

845
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,896
I said, keep walking, pal. Nothing to see here. Beat it.

846
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,813
-What'd you say?
-I said, beat it, get out of here.

847
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:30,853
What'd you say?

848
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:42,953
I said, scram!

849
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,124
You want a piece of me?

850
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,168
Yeah, come on, come on.

851
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:57,179
What do you got? What do you got? Come on!

852
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,804
Come and get it. Yeah!

853
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,263
Come on, you bastards!

854
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,773
Here, camel, camel.

855
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,567
Come on, let's go.

856
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:19,326
They are proud and majestic animals, aren't they?

857
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,369
You're welcome.

858
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:30,709
Did you--? Were you just talking to them?

859
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,716
Press your menu. It's right here.

860
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:38,675
"Linguistics."

861
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,472
You can talk to animals.

862
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,594
Yes.

863
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,143
It appears that I speak camel.

864
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,893
-Can you ask them to, like, come with us and be--?
-Excuse me.

865
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,104
They're willing to talk.

866
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,563
They wanna know what's in it for them
and how much luggage we have.

867
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,611
Will you look at me?

868
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,532
I mean, what am I supposed to do with this?

869
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,158
You read the map.

870
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,581
I don't wanna read the map. I'm supposed to be her.

871
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,660
Instead, there's actual hair growing out of my face!

872
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:13,089
Sorry. All bodies are beautiful, even this one.

873
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,127
Wait a second.

874
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,970
-This is amazing!
-Careful.

875
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,059
Fridge...

876
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:32,183
Yo, this thing is insane!

877
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,736
-Be careful. That body is not a toy.
-No, it's a machine.

878
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,983
And on top of that...

879
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,360
boobs.

880
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,942
Touch my boobs and I will murder you.

881
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,903
Too late. It was the first thing I did.

882
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,366
Hey, hey, don't do that.

883
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,830
-Let's take this Jumanji berry and go meet them.
-Relax, girl.

884
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,086
I'm trying that flying acrobat thing you did.

885
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,918
-Don't. We have the berry. It's not necessary.
-Check this out.

886
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,174
-Omaha, Omaha! Hut, hut, hike!
-Wait.

887
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,680
Fridge, be careful! I am telling you, that body's a weapon.

888
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,353
-You don't even know what it's capable of.
-This is amazing!

889
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,649
-That body's a loaded gun!
-Yeah! And this gun's about to go off!

890
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,394
Oh, my God!

891
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,191
Fridge!

892
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:20,815
Come here.

893
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:24,201
-Oh, my God.
-Goddamn it!

894
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,028
Here, I got you. I got ya.

895
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,043
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

896
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,254
Oh, my God, that was awful.

897
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,305
I hate being the map guy!

898
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,968
Let's get out of here.

899
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:56,934
Switchblade!

900
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,018
There he is.

901
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,525
Bravestone!

902
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,232
I told you to stay the hell away from my wife!

903
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,038
-We got company.
-What did you do?

904
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,200
All right, guys, this is the moment. We need you now.

905
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,339
They said that we can get away out the back door.

906
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,463
Are you talking to that camel?

907
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:23,794
Yes.

908
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,675
That's Lucille and Hank.

909
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,381
And Jeffrey's in the back.

910
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,606
-Hey!
-Hey.

911
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:41,107
-We should get going.
-What happened?

912
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:45,028
My grandpa beat up 45 strangers for no reason,
and now that woman's husband is trying to kill him.

913
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,076
Is that the desert fruit?

914
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:51,747
Yeah. It's a Jumanji berry, and it weighs like 100 pounds.

915
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,286
My grandpa will carry it.

916
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,296
-We should get out of here. Come on, Grandpa.
-Let's go.

917
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,631
-I could take them.
-What?

918
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,380
-What are you talking about? We escaped.
-I said, I could take them.

919
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:07,509
-Oh, Eddie.
-No, Grandpa Eddie, that's Switchblade!

920
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,681
I'm telling you, there's a time when you run,

921
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:13,056
then there's a time in life, like right now, where you stay...

922
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,188
Yeah!

923
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,860
-Yeah!
-Switchblade! Switchblade!

924
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:23,779
Nice shot, Switchblade!

925
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,830
What?

926
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,597
We should see Mount Zhatmire pretty soon.

927
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:03,811
You know, Gladys and I took a road trip before she passed.

928
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,272
We went on a ceramics tour

929
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,902
through the Southwest.

930
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:11,611
I lost my restaurant so you could drive around
and look at ashtrays?

931
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:12,740
Yes, Ed.

932
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,289
That's what you do when you retire.

933
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,161
You explore your interests.

934
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,417
I don't have interests.

935
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:22,212
Guys like me, we don't retire!

936
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:26,167
We work, and then we keep working,
and then, eventually, we die.

937
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:27,547
But you retired me.

938
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,173
You retired me.

939
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:32,677
-It's a wonder I lasted as long as I did.
-What?

940
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:36,681
-You're a difficult man, Ed.
-You don't abandon your best friend, Milo.

941
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,229
When I lost the restaurant, I lost everything!

942
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:40,564
You--?

943
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,980
Yes. Yes, I know he is.

944
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,233
-What? Are you talking to my camel?
-Yes, I'm talking to the camel.

945
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,485
And he can tell

946
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,816
that you're a pain in the ass.

947
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,277
My camel's taking your side?

948
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,830
And he's not your camel.

949
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,702
He's just giving you a ride.

950
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,996
Well, how about the both of you go screw yourselves?

951
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,205
-What did you just say?
-Guys!

952
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,634
You and me, we gonna settle this right here, right now!

953
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,887
-I'll show you.
-What are you doing?

954
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,010
-Don't worry about it.
-Milo, what are you doing?

955
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,680
Hold on. Wait, wait. Here we go.

956
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,309
You want a piece of me, huh? That's what you want?

957
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,986
You do not want a piece of him, Milo, I'm telling you.

958
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,485
Oh, that's where you're wrong, young man.

959
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,657
Because I do want a piece.

960
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,234
I want a big piece.

961
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:40,040
See, Eddie, what you don't know is that for the last 15 years,

962
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,493
I've been studying tai chi.

963
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,002
And right now,

964
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:46,376
I am harnessing my chi.

965
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:49,584
And when I'm done, I'm gonna whup your ass.

966
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:52,715
Milo, I am telling you, this is not a good idea.

967
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,137
No!

968
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:06,980
Dude!

969
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,277
You gotta stop killing everybody.

970
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,904
All right, then.

971
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,580
I guess that's settled.

972
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,137
The camels just stopped.

973
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,601
This is as far as they go.

974
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,724
To get to Jurgen's fortress,

975
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:47,149
they said that we can head down this path here
and make a right.

976
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,771
Then we're in his territory.

977
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,900
And they don't wanna go there
because they don't want to die.

978
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,487
We don't wanna die either.

979
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,906
The worst Bravestone of all time.

980
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,327
So we have to get across... this.

981
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,617
Okay, we can do this. We can do this.

982
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,123
We just have to take our time and make careful decisions.

983
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:50,921
What are you talking about? It's obvious.

984
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:54,917
We start on that bridge right there,
then jump to that one that heads to right at 30 degrees,

985
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:58,675
and then those two that look like two sides of a trapezoid...

986
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,255
Geometry.

987
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,761
That's what it's for!

988
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,677
Maybe this character's not totally worthless.

989
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,812
-I'll go first.
-Really?

990
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,603
You see? It's no big deal.

991
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,819
-What's going on?
-No, no, no.

992
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:19,900
Oh, no.

993
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:23,737
-No.
Grandpa!

994
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:28,833
Oh, crap.

995
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,172
What the hell?

996
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,969
-It's okay. We can do this.
-Yeah?

997
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,797
It's just about finding the right timing.

998
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,677
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Follow me.

999
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:49,646
Come on!

1000
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,274
Come on, Milo, come on!

1001
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,940
-Oh, Lord.
-Here.

1002
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:01,533
Okay.

1003
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,494
Hey, you guys.

1004
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,667
Is that rock moving?

1005
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,216
-Oh, no.
-What?

1006
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,544
Well, now, this is a problem.

1007
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,136
Come on, what is it?

1008
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,258
-Oh, my.
-What?

1009
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,510
-Spit it out!
-What is it?

1010
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,683
-Just tell us!
-Tell us! Milo!

1011
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,232
Those are mandrills.

1012
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,526
-We should go. Go, go!
-Go!

1013
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,691
That one! Obtuse angle!

1014
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:48,948
Note the distinctive and colourful pigment
around their face and buttocks.

1015
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,378
Mandrills are the heaviest of all monkeys.

1016
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:59,584
Even heavier than baboons,
with which they are often confused.

1017
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:04,345
And now head for the rhombus!

1018
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:05,922
Come on. Hurry up.

1019
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,803
-Rhombus! Rhombus!
-Come on.

1020
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,652
No, Martha!

1021
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,775
-Not that one! You're on the wrong bridge!
-What?

1022
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,355
The perpendicular one!

1023
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,697
Martha!

1024
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,166
Martha!

1025
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,667
No!

1026
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,591
No!

1027
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,972
Spencer, behind you!

1028
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:51,601
Jump!

1029
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:53,978
Come on, I got you!

1030
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,307
Spencer!

1031
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:07,776
Oh, no! No! No!

1032
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,166
Oh, no! No!

1033
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:21,506
Get off!

1034
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,259
Come on.

1035
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,767
All right, bring it on.

1036
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,391
Come on, come here.

1037
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:44,775
Grandpa!

1038
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,532
Grandpa! Enough!

1039
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,074
Grandpa, stop!
-Yeah!

1040
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:50,323
They're gone!

1041
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:02,463
Come on!

1042
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,096
Give me your hand!

1043
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,639
-What?!
-Trust me!

1044
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,245
Go.

1045
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,454
Last one. Aim for the centre of the parabola!

1046
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,546
Oh, damn.

1047
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,543
Son of a...

1048
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:55,183
-Eddie?
-Milo!

1049
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:56,726
Eddie!

1050
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,144
Hey, Eddie, where you going?

1051
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:00,893
I need your help, Eddie.

1052
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:03,858
Eddie!

1053
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:19,290
Eddie! Milo!

1054
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,722
-Seriously?
-Later.

1055
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:44,899
-Run!
-Run!

1056
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:20,723
Hey, guys.

1057
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:22,645
Who the hell's this?

1058
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:26,726
-Alex, what are you doing here?
-Bethany thought you might need some help.

1059
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,853
-Where is Bethany?
-She's right here.

1060
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,026
You mean...?

1061
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:39,620
"Oh, my God, right?

1062
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:41,914
Like, I'm a total horse.

1063
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:45,035
I can't believe that we found you guys.

1064
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,747
-Hi."
-Yep, that's Bethany.

1065
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:51,917
-What's up, girl?
-Hey.

1066
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:55,299
Oh, we brought you some clothes. You must be freezing.

1067
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:04,183
So this horse is a character in the game?

1068
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,104
Yeah.

1069
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,397
Cyclone's his name.

1070
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,645
-How's that feel?
-I don't know. I sprained it pretty good.

1071
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,855
Where'd you get these clothes?

1072
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,113
When I realised how far north we were going,
we stopped to go shopping.

1073
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:18,784
You can shop here?

1074
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:22,330
-How did you know how to do that?
-I was here for 20 years, kiddo.

1075
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,407
At least I got rid of that stupid hat.

1076
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:25,913
Now I got this stupid hat.

1077
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,010
It's something, isn't it?

1078
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,017
Yeah, it's something.

1079
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,230
You know, Eddie,

1080
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:56,064
you didn't lose everything when you lost the restaurant.

1081
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,945
You still got a lot, man.

1082
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,122
I lost my friend.

1083
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,456
So did I.

1084
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,888
I'm sorry, Milo.

1085
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,901
Hey, I'm sorry too, Eddie.

1086
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:37,530
I should have tracked you down a long time ago.

1087
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,735
I'm glad you came over for coffee.

1088
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,407
What made you do it, huh?

1089
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:50,285
I mean, why now?

1090
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,381
Milo, what's going on?

1091
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,551
You're sick.

1092
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:07,889
How bad?

1093
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,731
I don't have much time left.

1094
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:17,103
Son of a bitch.

1095
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,109
But I count myself lucky, Eddie.

1096
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,991
I was married to a wonderful woman.

1097
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,236
I got to live a wonderful life.

1098
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:28,243
And not everybody can say that.

1099
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,792
That's why I wanted to make things better with you.

1100
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,290
And now that they are...

1101
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,504
well, I'm...

1102
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,211
I'm happy about that too.

1103
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:53,807
Grandpa, Milo.

1104
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:55,766
Come on, we gotta go.

1105
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,238
"The Fortress."

1106
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,486
Looks like the last level.

1107
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,414
Okay, so we climb that mountain
and then we sneak in somehow.

1108
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:13,914
Yeah, and then we steal the jewel
before the Brothers Kababik get there.

1109
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,746
-And then show it to the sun?
-Sounds like a plan.

1110
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:17,751
What?!

1111
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,919
I'm sorry, I think I missed the "plan" part of the plan.

1112
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:25,346
That last level almost killed us all. I can barely walk.

1113
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,514
Your grandpa beats the hell out of the wrong guy,

1114
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,639
or we get attacked by a polar bear,
what am I supposed to do?

1115
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,265
I'm not gonna beat up the wrong guy.

1116
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:35,348
You are gonna beat up the wrong guy!
You're not a good Bravestone!

1117
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:39,064
You're too stubborn and pissed off,
and you keep getting us killed.

1118
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,737
What the hell you talking about?

1119
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,405
And Milo--

1120
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,482
And I say this with all due respect, sir.

1121
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,909
--Is not a good person to be the zoologist.

1122
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:50,872
He talks too slow, and by the time
he gets to the point, you're dead!

1123
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,323
Once again, no offence.

1124
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:53,328
None taken.

1125
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,035
And let me tell you why.

1126
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:57,336
Because my friend Bernard--
-You see?

1127
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,921
You're a thief who's too neurotic to steal anything,
Bethany's a horse...

1128
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,928
All I know is, we are stuck here again,

1129
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:09,599
we are running out of lives and my ankle is killing me!

1130
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:12,138
-Oh, my God!
-Fridge!

1131
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,561
Fridge! Are you okay?

1132
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:18,311
Yo, you guys gotta see this!

1133
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:33,038
That's what the water looked like at the tree.

1134
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:35,749
When we...

1135
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,827
-switched bodies.
-Switched bodies.

1136
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,204
Goddamn, that is cold!

1137
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,754
Oh, man! It's freezing!

1138
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,050
What the hell, man?

1139
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:30,342
Yes!

1140
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,718
I missed you so much.

1141
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,720
Oh, my God, you guys, hi.

1142
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:35,643
Spencer?

1143
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,522
-Hey.
-Hey.

1144
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,562
-Grandpa?
-Yeah, what?

1145
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:49,448
Milo?

1146
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:53,907
You should see the size of your--

1147
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,164
Damn.

1148
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,538
I never thought I'd be this happy to shrink.

1149
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,920
I have never seen anything quite like that before.

1150
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:06,716
Oh, my God, it's so good to be able to talk again with words.

1151
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,918
Spencer, hi!

1152
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:11,175
-Hey, Bethany.
-We have so much catching up to do.

1153
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:12,676
I wanna hear about New York.

1154
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,554
But it feels like maybe this isn't the perfect, like, moment.

1155
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,931
Right. Like, later.

1156
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:18,978
Later.

1157
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:21,647
Better?

1158
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:23,641
Yeah.

1159
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:24,567
Much.

1160
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:30,648
I got hair!

1161
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,535
For the first time in 40 years. I gotta go tell Milo.

1162
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:36,703
-Be careful out there, Grandpa.
-Yeah.

1163
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,246
How's your ankle?

1164
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,165
Your ankle.

1165
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:42,289
It's a little sore, but definitely not as bad
as you were making it seem.

1166
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,120
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

1167
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,047
You were making a really big deal of it and it's not that bad.

1168
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,719
-Hey! Get the hell away from that horse!
-Freeze!

1169
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:58,184
Milo! Hey!

1170
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,806
Wait, which ankle was it?

1171
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,103
-Hold it.
-Hey, hey, hey.

1172
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,726
Get your hands off of me.

1173
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:05,023
Hey! I'm with you, Milo.

1174
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,191
I'm right here.

1175
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,776
Guys, guys.

1176
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,321
Eddie and Milo.

1177
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:15,401
They got them.

1178
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,411
There's ice everywhere,

1179
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,621
and there's only one road in.

1180
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,002
It's covered with guards though.
I don't know how we'll get in there.

1181
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:33,586
Oh, okay.

1182
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,798
I see a dungeon at the top of this ice wall.

1183
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,008
That must be where they're keeping your grandpa.

1184
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:43,722
And Milo is probably in this, like, barn thing
all the way on the other side of the place.

1185
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,978
Okay. We gotta split up.

1186
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,685
One team goes to get Milo,
the other team busts out my grandpa.

1187
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:50,736
But how do we get in?

1188
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,906
Fridge, do you have any ice-climbing equipment
in your backpack?

1189
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,194
You mean something like this?

1190
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,618
-Just like that.
-See?

1191
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,824
That's why I'm the backpack guy.

1192
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:05,785
-That's why.
-Yeah. You're great at that.

1193
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,040
Yeah, I know.

1194
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,293
Martha, will you come with me?

1195
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:11,791
Of course.

1196
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:23,970
I forgot what this part feels like.

1197
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:26,139
It's scary.

1198
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:29,859
-Yeah.
-Hey.

1199
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:33,396
We can do it. This team can do anything.

1200
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:36,489
Nobody knows that better than me.

1201
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:39,326
-Yeah.
-Come on, you guys.

1202
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,245
Bring it in.

1203
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:47,001
Be aggressive.

1204
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,543
Be, be aggressive.

1205
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,338
Be aggressive. Be, be aggressive.

1206
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:52,460
Come on, guys.

1207
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:55,509
-That's not what I thought this was. No.
-We should just go.

1208
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:57,507
Okay, just-- Go, team.

1209
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:17,069
Okay. I'm gonna try to sneak in with them.

1210
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:21,616
-In this outfit, I might be able to pass. You guys stay here--
-What? No way.

1211
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:23,116
Now's the moment. Stay here.

1212
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,494
-Alex, no!
-Go. Good luck, Alex.

1213
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:32,380
-Come on.
-What are you talking about, "Come on"? Bethany.

1214
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:33,331
Bethany!

1215
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:38,085
Turn right.

1216
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:58,068
You there. Stay where you are.

1217
01:23:58,158 --> 01:23:59,523
Who,us?

1218
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,780
Are you the Brothers Kababik?

1219
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:05,496
-Are we the who?
-Are you the Brothers Kababik?

1220
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,123
Yes.

1221
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,451
We are them. It is we. Us.

1222
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,629
We are the Brothers Cadabra-- Kadabrik.

1223
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:15,626
He is one brother,

1224
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:19,590
and I am the other brother.

1225
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,588
We-- We got different mothers.

1226
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:27,761
But we... We came to get the thing that we came to get.

1227
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,521
Brothers Kababik,

1228
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:33,440
on behalf of Jurgen the Brutal,

1229
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:35,859
welcome to Zhatmire Stronghold.

1230
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:37,903
Thank you.

1231
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,583
There's something I have to ask you.

1232
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,256
Okay.

1233
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,213
Why didn't you come visit when you were supposed to?

1234
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,178
You cancel the first time,
then you were gonna come for Halloween.

1235
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:08,885
You cancel again.

1236
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:12,097
And then the next time I hear from you,
you tell me we should take a break?

1237
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,111
It's just... I saw all your pictures on Instagram,

1238
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,529
and you looked like you were having so much fun, and...

1239
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:27,321
I just got really insecure or something.
Like I wasn't the guy I thought I was.

1240
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:33,496
Or I wasn't the guy you thought I was.
Which would be even worse.

1241
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,622
Spencer, do you think I'm not...

1242
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:40,674
totally terrified all the time?

1243
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:45,338
I got to school, and suddenly,
for the first time ever, people really liked me.

1244
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,841
But I'm always thinking that...

1245
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:51,176
I don't know, like it's...

1246
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:55,265
Like it's just a matter of time
before somebody figures out who I really am.

1247
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:57,395
But then I see you.

1248
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:02,237
And you're the person who makes me feel good...

1249
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,735
about who I really am.

1250
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:07,569
When you're, like, scared and insecure,

1251
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,829
that's when you need your people the most.

1252
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,633
Hey, Mr Walker.

1253
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:26,754
Why the long face?

1254
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,716
Dad joke. Sorry. Can't help it.

1255
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:34,428
Let's get you out of here.

1256
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:05,092
Okay.

1257
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,928
It's just an obstacle course.

1258
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:09,379
You were good at those.

1259
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:27,860
All right, all right, get a room.

1260
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:34,451
Grandpa... let's get you out of there.

1261
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:35,740
Here.

1262
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:43,505
-Let's blow this joint, huh?
-We still have to find the jewel, Grandpa.

1263
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:46,084
It must be in a vault or a treasure room or something.

1264
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,964
Yeah, that's how it works in these games.

1265
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:52,802
I passed a vault on the way up to this dump.
Single access, 3-foot-thick steel door.

1266
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:55,009
Only way in is through a grate in the ceiling.

1267
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:08,981
I think I got it now.

1268
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,285
Just stay on...

1269
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,620
the raised ones.

1270
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:41,062
Jurgen the Brutal awaits.

1271
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:47,528
So, tell me, which brother is which?

1272
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:51,990
How do you mean?

1273
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:53,659
Which brother is which?

1274
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,368
Which of you is Augustus and which is Tomatoli?

1275
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,668
I am Augustus.

1276
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:06,963
And I'm Tomatolik.

1277
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:10,300
Augustus Kababik.

1278
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:13,378
The cleverest man in all of Jumanji.

1279
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:16,427
Yes, I'm totally that man.

1280
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:19,723
-And Tomatoli Kababik.
-That's me.

1281
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:21,099
The bravest eunuch.

1282
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,558
-Wait a minute, what?
-Did you say, "Eunuch"?

1283
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:26,983
Tomatoli Kababik,

1284
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:30,984
everyone knows the tale
of your great and generous sacrifice.

1285
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:36,194
How you gave your testicles
in order to save the region from the floods.

1286
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,450
-I think there might be a little confusion.
-Of course.

1287
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:43,034
Everybody knows the story about my little brother
and his famous testicles.

1288
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:46,462
-Wherever they may be.
-Wherever they may be.

1289
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:48,038
All right, let's back up.

1290
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:51,417
-Let's go back a little bit. Let's clear some stuff up.
-He's super brave.

1291
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:55,800
I've always been the super clever one,
and he's always been super brave.

1292
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:57,222
And super ball-less.

1293
01:29:57,309 --> 01:30:00,597
-Stop saying that! Both of my balls are right here!
-In spirit.

1294
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,641
They're here in spirit.

1295
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:05,684
Always.

1296
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:08,020
Of course.

1297
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,022
Right, bro?

1298
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:16,233
Right.

1299
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,202
I got no balls.

1300
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:26,998
There's the chest.

1301
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:30,043
Okay. You're up, Grandpa.

1302
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,841
-Who, me?
-Yes. You're the cat burglar.

1303
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,210
Your character, Ming.

1304
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:36,215
Ming?

1305
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:38,343
Yes, Ming. That's your avatar. That's her name.

1306
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,344
In your satchel, you have a set of lockpicks.

1307
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,097
Lockpicks? Why would I have lockpicks?

1308
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:44,929
Because Ming's the cat burglar.

1309
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:48,565
-Don't you think one of you should do this?
-You have the skills.

1310
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:49,983
I have the skills?

1311
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,152
Not you. Ming.

1312
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:53,687
Right.

1313
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:54,772
Ming.

1314
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:58,154
Please don't ask who Ming is.

1315
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:09,662
Not bad, huh?

1316
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:14,500
Now we just gotta figure out how to get you out of here.

1317
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:26,804
Shall we?

1318
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:32,650
Now, that's cool.

1319
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:40,492
Welcome. May I offer you a piece of cake?

1320
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:42,869
No! No!

1321
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,538
No!

1322
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:49,209
No, thank you.

1323
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:01,175
Steady.

1324
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,192
I'd like to see your friend Ming do that!

1325
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,946
We got an issue here.

1326
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:30,204
Oh, thank you.

1327
01:32:32,839 --> 01:32:33,670
Thank you.

1328
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:46,300
Brothers Kababik, I present Jurgen the Brutal.

1329
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:57,482
At last,

1330
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:01,065
we meet on this historic day.

1331
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:04,572
Yes, it is so great to meet you.

1332
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:08,914
Your Honour, if that be the Falcon Jewel

1333
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,459
upon your thick and meaty neck,

1334
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,252
perhaps we should...

1335
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:16,546
take it.

1336
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:21,002
Today we forge an unbreakable alliance.

1337
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,545
Your family will join me,

1338
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:27,758
and land by land, we'll take the world.

1339
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:31,307
So I ask, on this historic day,

1340
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,521
where is she?

1341
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,018
-Where's who?
-Who you talking about?

1342
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:39,945
Your sister.

1343
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,738
Soon to be my bride.

1344
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:49,029
You know what?
I think that there's been a misunderstanding.

1345
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,991
Where is your sister?

1346
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:57,413
Which sister were we talking about?

1347
01:33:57,507 --> 01:34:00,340
Debbie or... Brooke?

1348
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,377
Or Sierra?

1349
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:07,173
Where is your sister?

1350
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:11,685
She's getting ready, back at the hotel.

1351
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:14,183
She's just doing what brides do on their wedding day.

1352
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:18,233
Hanging with the girls, getting her hair done, mani-pedi.

1353
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:23,230
If you've come here without your sister...

1354
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,443
I just might have to cut off your heads.

1355
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,745
-Oh, no! No, no, no. Don't.
-Hey. Hey.

1356
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:32,368
-God, no.
-Hey, get off!

1357
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:36,042
-No.No.
-So I'll ask one last time:

1358
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:39,372
-Getting a mani-pedi!
-Where is your sister?

1359
01:34:39,465 --> 01:34:40,751
I'm right here.

1360
01:34:49,309 --> 01:34:52,518
Gwendolyn Hortencia Lewelda Kababik?

1361
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:53,639
Is that you?

1362
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,267
Yes.

1363
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:57,518
That is me.

1364
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:00,146
Now, please,

1365
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:03,979
O Brutal One, release my brothers.

1366
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:09,450
And is it your intention, on this day,

1367
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:13,496
at this hour, to wed Jurgen the Brutal of Zhatmire?

1368
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:17,333
Yep. That's my plan.

1369
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:20,208
And is it your intention to mother his children

1370
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:23,336
and forge in blood this union with your family?

1371
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:26,467
Yes.

1372
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:28,591
Gwendolyn Kababik...

1373
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,592
known throughout the world

1374
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:33,425
for your beauty and cunning.

1375
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:36,974
And now you're mine.

1376
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:44,691
May I hold the Falcon Jewel?

1377
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,361
Of course, my bride.

1378
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:50,317
Thank you.

1379
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:53,028
Get it.

1380
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,911
Jurgen the Brutal!

1381
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:02,587
The Brothers Kababik have been delayed in Gorek.

1382
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:04,415
These are impostors!

1383
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,758
-Impostors?
-Seize them!

1384
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:08,710
No, no, no. Oh, no. We can explain.

1385
01:36:08,805 --> 01:36:09,886
Oh, no, no, no.

1386
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:11,884
I forgot to tell you one thing.

1387
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:15,558
I have a boyfriend.

1388
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:29,281
-Get back.
-Stay back.

1389
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:30,357
-Stay away.
-Get back!

1390
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:32,567
Get back!

1391
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:55,841
Get out of here! I will torch you, bitches.

1392
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:58,051
I will literally burn your face.

1393
01:37:20,126 --> 01:37:22,367
I'll meet the brothers in Gorek.

1394
01:37:22,462 --> 01:37:23,543
Kill them all!

1395
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,463
Go get him!

1396
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,631
Go get the jewel!

1397
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:30,834
Don't worry about us. Just go!

1398
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:33,882
Backpack.

1399
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,847
Get away! I know geometry.

1400
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:43,055
I'm not messing around, you guys. Get away!

1401
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:45,311
Fridge, we're gonna die!

1402
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:58,366
Anybody wanna dance with the bride?

1403
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,311
You want a piece?

1404
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:07,772
Come on!

1405
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:15,109
Nunchucks.

1406
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:28,451
Awesome.

1407
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,046
We did it.

1408
01:39:36,137 --> 01:39:37,002
Let's go!

1409
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:48,730
-Come on, come on!
-Hurry!

1410
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:11,169
Look!

1411
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:14,923
-Is that Spencer?
-Oh, my God.

1412
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,800
No!

1413
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:13,731
Spencer!

1414
01:41:22,577 --> 01:41:24,909
Who are you?

1415
01:41:30,585 --> 01:41:32,701
I'm Dr Smolder Bravestone.

1416
01:41:58,029 --> 01:41:58,894
Spencer!

1417
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,820
-He says to get on his back.
-Who, me?

1418
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:15,285
Oh, no!

1419
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:39,517
Oh, no. Milo!

1420
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:40,943
-Oh, my God.
-What's he doing?

1421
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:42,111
Wait.

1422
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,610
Milo!

1423
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:55,165
Yeah, Milo!

1424
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:58,085
Go!

1425
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:02,461
We're coming, Spencer!

1426
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:07,678
"Show it to the sun."

1427
01:43:08,224 --> 01:43:09,635
Grandpa, the jewel!

1428
01:43:09,725 --> 01:43:12,513
You gotta show it to the sun! Get ready!

1429
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,184
Come on, Milo!

1430
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:23,858
-Go!
-Come on, come on!

1431
01:43:38,129 --> 01:43:39,836
Yeah!

1432
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:52,178
-Call out its name.
-Call out its name.

1433
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:53,850
Call out its name!

1434
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:59,932
Jumanji!

1435
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,015
What'd they say?

1436
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:04,523
Jumanji?

1437
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:36,429
Yes!

1438
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,390
We won!

1439
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:40,267
-We did it!
-Hey.

1440
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:43,558
-Yes!
-Put me down.

1441
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:45,359
-Put me down, goddamn it. Stop it.
-Okay.

1442
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:48,188
Is this what you were looking for? This little thing?

1443
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:49,898
Grandpa, you guys were incredible.

1444
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:53,610
Yeah, that's the thing about Milo. He's got a lot of skills.

1445
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:55,035
Milo and Eddie.

1446
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:57,785
Milo and Eddie.

1447
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:07,082
What are we doing here now?

1448
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:19,556
Well done, intrepid adventurers.

1449
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:22,309
You have saved Jumanji. Again.

1450
01:45:23,484 --> 01:45:28,149
And now, with your permission, Dr Bravestone,
I will take the jewel from here.

1451
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:33,484
I will protect it with my life and return it to the care
of the elder at the Avian Province.

1452
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:35,784
And so your work here is done.

1453
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:39,739
All of Jumanji thanks you. And, sadly, this is where we part.

1454
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:42,576
I don't know what's sad about it.
I'm ready to get the hell out of here.

1455
01:45:47,716 --> 01:45:48,581
What?

1456
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:51,425
Really?

1457
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:57,803
-Hey, guys, you're not gonna believe this.
-What'd he say?

1458
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:01,511
-He says that he--
-He wants to stay.

1459
01:46:03,399 --> 01:46:06,016
He says somebody's gotta stay and look after this place.

1460
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:10,608
And that he's 75 years old and he just learned how to fly.

1461
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:16,326
But he won't be able to get out.

1462
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:18,611
He knows.

1463
01:46:22,668 --> 01:46:24,579
Oh, Milo.

1464
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:30,039
I feel like I just got you back.

1465
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:32,758
Now I'm losing you for good.

1466
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:38,635
"You're not losing me, buddy. I'll always be with you."

1467
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:47,269
Being your partner...

1468
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:50,317
is one of the best things I ever got to be.

1469
01:46:53,908 --> 01:46:55,148
He says, "Thank you."

1470
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:56,198
No, no.

1471
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:58,533
Thank you, Milo.

1472
01:47:27,399 --> 01:47:28,480
Yes!

1473
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:31,108
-Take care, Milo!
-Bye!

1474
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:32,481
-Go, Milo!
-So long, Milo!

1475
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:34,312
Bye-bye, Mr Walker!

1476
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:39,738
That's my partner right there.

1477
01:47:45,584 --> 01:47:48,918
Everybody should be so lucky to have a friend like Milo.

1478
01:48:04,812 --> 01:48:06,052
Come on, Grandpa.

1479
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:07,598
Let's go home.

1480
01:48:12,152 --> 01:48:13,142
Hey, guys.

1481
01:48:15,864 --> 01:48:17,070
Thanks for coming to get me.

1482
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:26,872
You do it again, your ass is gonna be stuck here, Spencer!
Because I'm not coming back!

1483
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:51,643
Everybody okay?

1484
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:54,809
Yeah.

1485
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:56,268
Grandpa, you okay?

1486
01:48:58,032 --> 01:48:59,693
Yeah, I'm good.

1487
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:03,864
Holy shit.

1488
01:49:17,593 --> 01:49:19,675
Strike. Square one. Counterstrike.

1489
01:49:19,762 --> 01:49:23,505
-The fat one on the bottom?
-The fat-- No, the fat one above the R.

1490
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:24,805
-Okay.
-Atop number two.

1491
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:27,384
-Yeah. Yeah.
-80 strike, strike.

1492
01:49:27,478 --> 01:49:29,594
-Yeah.
-Counterstrike.

1493
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:32,430
Then kick me. O.

1494
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:37,935
Let me tell you something.

1495
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:41,273
-Getting old--
-I know. Getting old sucks.

1496
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:44,446
Getting old...

1497
01:49:47,706 --> 01:49:49,162
is a gift.

1498
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:53,750
I forget that sometimes.

1499
01:49:54,963 --> 01:49:56,169
But it is.

1500
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:03,006
What more could a guy possibly want?

1501
01:50:09,228 --> 01:50:10,138
Hey, guys.

1502
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:12,682
How was your day?

1503
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:14,555
It was really great.

1504
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:17,483
Yeah.

1505
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:20,357
Spencer taught me how to play a video game.

1506
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:36,376
Oh, hell, no.

1507
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:49,469
You okay, Grandpa?

1508
01:50:52,521 --> 01:50:53,807
Yeah.

1509
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:55,729
A lot of good memories here.

1510
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:08,734
Eddie.

1511
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:10,570
Eddie, is that you?

1512
01:51:10,664 --> 01:51:12,120
Nora.

1513
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:13,993
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

1514
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:14,994
Hey, guys.

1515
01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:16,371
-Hi.
-Hi.

1516
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:19,252
What's up, bro?

1517
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,956
So how's business?

1518
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:23,540
Oh, you know how it is.

1519
01:51:23,635 --> 01:51:26,798
My manager quit six months ago, moved to Philly.

1520
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:29,506
Place has been kind of a mess ever since.

1521
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:33,184
It's hard to find people who really know how to do this.

1522
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,556
Oh, well...

1523
01:51:35,564 --> 01:51:37,555
I don't have to tell you this.

1524
01:51:41,028 --> 01:51:42,814
So you need some help around here?

1525
01:51:44,364 --> 01:51:45,775
You mean it?

1526
01:51:45,866 --> 01:51:47,948
I mean, I--

1527
01:51:48,035 --> 01:51:49,491
I'd be honoured.

1528
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:50,902
Well...

1529
01:51:53,165 --> 01:51:54,781
It's really good to see you, Eddie.

1530
01:51:56,251 --> 01:51:58,208
Likewise.

1531
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:10,964
I'm... I'm gonna take this

1532
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:14,843
where I was going and...

1533
01:52:14,937 --> 01:52:16,223
I'll be right back.

1534
01:52:16,313 --> 01:52:18,805
You guys gotta come to New York too.

1535
01:52:18,899 --> 01:52:20,389
Yeah, I can't wait.

1536
01:52:21,443 --> 01:52:23,184
This team, forever.

1537
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:25,440
Forever.

1538
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:26,520
Always.

1539
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:31,401
Always and forever?

1540
01:52:31,495 --> 01:52:34,487
-Yeah, let's keep close though.
-Of course, yeah.

1541
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:36,117
One thing.

1542
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:37,790
Can we all agree?

1543
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:39,708
Let's never go back there.

1544
01:52:39,795 --> 01:52:41,411
-I thought we already agreed on that.
-That's fine.

1545
01:53:22,296 --> 01:53:24,003
Sorry, it's so late.

1546
01:53:24,089 --> 01:53:26,626
Yeah, it's that time of year. Everyone's heaters are broken.

1547
01:53:26,717 --> 01:53:29,630
Oh, it's no problem. I'm just glad you made it.

1548
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,427
The furnace is right over here.

1549
01:53:36,601 --> 01:53:38,763
Is that an old video game console?

1550
01:53:41,023 --> 01:53:43,014
Oh, yeah, probably.

1551
01:53:43,108 --> 01:53:44,974
It belongs to my son.

1552
01:53:47,029 --> 01:53:48,645
Yeah, I'm a big gamer.

1553
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:51,405
I've never seen anything like it.

1554
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:58,574
Well, it looks like it's broken.

1555
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:01,866
Maybe you shouldn't touch it.
