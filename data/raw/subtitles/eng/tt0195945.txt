1
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,034
Put that shit out.

2
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:40,248
The doctor prescribed me
this shit now.

3
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,836
New Line presents a real nigger movie.

4
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,671
Yeah.

5
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,635
I'm high as a giraffe ass
right now.

6
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,721
Right now.

7
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,848
"A Cubevision Production."

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,934
This shit gonna be
off the hook, nigger.

9
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,897
Hit it again, Smokey.
Cough it up your nose.

10
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:10,445
This shit is on the one.

11
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:14,407
This is a done one on this one.
Yeah, buddy.

12
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,496
You got a bong, nigger?

13
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,499
This shit is killin' my sack.

14
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:27,921
"Written by Ice Cube."
I thought that nigger was in jail.

15
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,008
I helped write
this motherfucker too.

16
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,761
They all did.

17
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,555
Look at the smoke.

18
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,350
"Directed by Steve Carr."

19
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,395
That motherfucker
Owes me some money.

20
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:47,982
That's the nigger
that owes me that money, man.

21
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,784
In the movies, when you beat up
the neighbourhood bully...

22
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,496
you're supposed to live
happily everafter.

23
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:07,210
But in my neighbourhood,
that's when all the drama starts.

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,547
It wasa Friday I'll never forget.

25
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:16,261
I got high for the first time.
I got shot at for the first time.

26
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,849
And I finally kicked
Debo's ass for the first time.

27
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,936
Debo ended up going to jail
for about four years.

28
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,149
You win some. You lose some.

29
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:33,611
But you live.
You live to fight another day.

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,951
There's rumours goin' around the hood
that Debo's breaking out next Friday.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,498
And when he gets out,
he's supposed to come to see me.

32
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:50,420
And today is next Friday,
and I still ain't got no job.

33
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,172
Come on!

34
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,473
Come on!

35
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:15,236
Soon as my pops  found out
Debo was gettin 'out...

36
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:20,825
he wanted me to move with my uncle
and little cousin in Rancho Cucamonga...

37
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,536
'till things calm down...

38
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:28,124
orDebo went back to prison,
whichever comes first.

39
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:44,182
Craig! Off your ass and on your feet.
Ain't no time to beat your meat.

40
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,060
All right.

41
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,272
Be out in about 35, 45 minutes.

42
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,360
You'll go blind, boy.

43
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,988
Hurry up. This is Friday.
We got to hit the highway.

44
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,745
I felt like the biggest punk
around here.

45
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,373
I whipped Debo's ass.

46
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,834
He should be the one moving.

47
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,988
When I'm gonna ride that?

48
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,699
- Punk, you're walkin'!
- But I'm tired.

49
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,434
Craig! Will you come on!

50
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,812
I don't want to hit that traffiic.

51
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,232
You had enough time
to get yourself together.

52
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,735
I don't believe this.

53
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,697
I told that boy to put that hose away
and cut that grass.

54
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,659
Look at that grass.
Stanley's grass look good.

55
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:31,748
Mrs.Johnson's grass look good.
But look at my grass. No!

56
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,085
When that boy get out of my house...

57
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,462
I'm gonna change my number.

58
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,173
Craig! Craig!

59
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,759
Come on out of that house!

60
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,844
Oh, damn!

61
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,350
Goodness gracious.

62
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,811
What's goin' on?

63
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,649
Man.

64
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,283
Use that brick
to break that chain.

65
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,746
You think it's the same brick
Craig knocked your ass out with?

66
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,709
Get out of here, you stupid mutt!

67
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,974
- Here I come.
- Will you bring your ass!

68
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,897
Come on! You got me trying
to break a chain with a brick?

69
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:42,485
Let's go get some pussy, Debo.
Fuck! Shit, man.

70
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:48,324
Shut up! I got some unfinished business
to deal with, and your butt gonna wait.

71
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,036
What's the matter?

72
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,581
I fell in some mud,
and it's all your fault.

73
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,125
- How is it my fault?
- You're taking all day.

74
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,420
And I told you to put that hose away
and cut that grass.

75
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,382
I didn't drop you on your head
when you were a kid.

76
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:09,012
Maybe your grandmother did.
I remember the summer of'75--

77
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,307
I didn 't want to leave
my neighbourhoodat all...

78
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,185
especially my homeboy Smokey.

79
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,313
But he went to rehab last month.

80
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,484
And the way he smoke,
ain 't no tellin' when he gettin 'out.

81
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,361
Gonna sure miss him.

82
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,738
I hate you, man.

83
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,658
Here come that dog truck.
Shut your mouth.

84
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,120
We're about to fade to black.

85
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,794
Stop!

86
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,801
Get your ass out the car, Craig!
This is the rematch!

87
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,389
Think you can beat on my big brother
and get away with it?

88
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:57,060
- Punch it!
- I got your butt now!

89
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,397
Debo! Help!

90
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,820
Fake-ass Suge Knight!

91
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,660
I'm gonna find you
and put my foot up your ass!

92
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,621
- Get up!
- Damn.

93
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:21,334
I ain't kickin' with you no more.
I'm going to Mommy house.

94
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,798
Did you see that? Them niggers
are like some wild dogs.

95
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:32,595
That's why moving with your Uncle Elroy
and your cousin Day-Day is best.

96
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,349
Your sister moved out.
It's time for you to move out too.

97
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,937
It's time for your mother and I to walk
around the house naked if we want to.

98
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,274
What? Y'all are trying
to walk around the house naked?

99
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,985
Yes, we are.

100
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,196
We're going to do it tonight
when I get off of work.

101
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,907
I can't wait to see
your mama naked.

102
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,535
That big old booty bouncin' around.

103
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,749
High-heeled shoes on,
walking on that shag rug...

104
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,209
givin' me a lap dance, boy.

105
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,338
- And my Johnson swingin'--
- Daddy!

106
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:11,009
Ball goin' one way, Johnson the other.
The ball/Johnson dance.

107
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,721
Daddy!
I don't wanna hear that.

108
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,310
What's that smell?

109
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,523
It must be your upper lip.
I don't smell nothin'.

110
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,484
I do!

111
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,986
What it smell like?

112
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,822
Like you didn't fall in mud.

113
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,244
Use this spray.
That's what I got this for.

114
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,624
Too much!
What's wrong with this window?

115
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,710
That window don't come down.
Remind me to get it fixed.

116
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,587
Damn!

117
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,537
Nice neighbourhood, huh?

118
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,248
It's all right.

119
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,709
Fake-ass Brady Bunch.

120
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,836
Eighteen years, son...

121
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,798
I been chasin' nasty,
stinkin', dirty, filthy dogs.

122
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,260
I been bitten by every dog
there is in the world--

123
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,472
pit bull, boxers,
collies, Seein'-Eye dogs.

124
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,349
What about a Chihuahua?

125
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,685
Twice!

126
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,772
Then there's my brother Elroy.

127
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,734
Everybody loves Elroy...

128
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,319
a lazy nothin'!

129
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,073
Hit the Lotto.
I just can't understand it.

130
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,123
- All right. You comin' in?
- Hell no, I ain't goin' in there.

131
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,835
I don't want to see Elroy's face
or smell his stinkin' breath.

132
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,838
It's going to be different
livin' out here.

133
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:16,009
Don't let your uncle or your cousin
get you into any kind of shit.

134
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,096
I'm grown now.
Can't nobody get me in trouble.

135
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,432
I'm glad you said that.

136
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,769
Since you're grown,
don't bring your ass back home.

137
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,821
Daddy, Craig's here!

138
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,708
- Uncle Willie.
- How you doin', Day-Day?

139
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:53,046
- Where's your big-head father?
- There he is right there.

140
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,008
Hey, Unc!

141
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,971
I heard you're running
from an ass-whippin'.

142
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,558
It ain't even like that.
Talk to your brother.

143
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,895
If it had been me,
I'd have shot him.

144
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,856
I know he'd have popped him.

145
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,196
Hey, Willie! How's it goin'?

146
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,950
Still steppin' in that dog shit
every day?

147
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,371
You take care of my boy.

148
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,957
Don't worry about nothin',
big bro.

149
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,210
He's in the best hands
in Rancho "Choke-among-us."

150
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,673
I'm the king here. You just
another nigger late payin' his rent.

151
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,383
Ain't that right, nephew?

152
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,885
- Yeah.
- Wait, Craig.

153
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,014
- Remember what I told you.
- I'll remember.

154
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,726
Now, Lotto stud...

155
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,270
close my door, don't slam it.

156
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,735
Can't even count to ten, and suddenly
you hit the Lotto. Ain't that a bitch?

157
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,948
Send Betty my love!

158
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,160
- Boy, you lookin' good.
- I can't call it.

159
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:11,124
Give me that bag.
When you're finished with him, come in.

160
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,335
All right. Thanks, Unc.

161
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,797
Damn.

162
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:22,385
It's been what, a year, since we
kicked it at the family reunion?

163
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,637
It was about a year, huh?

164
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,848
Yeah, man.

165
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,060
Ever since you moved out here,
we lost touch.

166
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,272
I know.
This is a long way from Watts.

167
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,400
But the good thing
about bein' out here...

168
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,862
we don't hear no gunshots,
no helicopters.

169
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:45,325
No police, no crackheads,
no chicken heads, no nothin'.

170
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,161
Just clean, fresh air.
Just smell.

171
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,789
Smell good, huh?

172
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,375
Taste good.
Taste the air.

173
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,045
- Yeah, dude.
- Aw, man.

174
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,673
Aw, shit!

175
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,721
Who is that?

176
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,475
The Joker brothers.

177
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,984
That's Joker.
He just got out of the pen.

178
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,697
There's Little Joker.
He just got out of Y.A.

179
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,410
Then there's Baby Joker right there.
He just got out the juvenile centre.

180
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,996
Then they got
a little dog named Cheeco.

181
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,083
You better watch him.
He'll bite the shit out of you.

182
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,045
But I got something better
than that Cadillac.

183
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,297
- What's that?
- Peep this.

184
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,009
What?

185
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,136
Check this out.

186
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,684
- This you?
- A little something I picked up.

187
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,311
- You diggin' that?
- Damn.

188
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,649
I wish we hit the Lotto and came up
on a million dollars like y'all.

189
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:04,195
After payin' taxes and lawyer fees
and all Daddy's bad-ass credit...

190
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:08,033
buyin' Viagra, trickin' with
these sack chasers around here...

191
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,162
$30, $40 now and then,
I ain't end up with a million dollars.

192
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,334
We end up with this crib and
this bad motherfucker right here.

193
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,461
It's off the hook.

194
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,546
- You like that, huh?
- I do.

195
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,132
I just got them 20's there.

196
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,344
Them ain't 20's,
but it's off the hook.

197
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,306
Them are 20's. No, they're tens.
I bought 'em from somebody.

198
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,184
- But they nice, though.
- Yeah, they cool.

199
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,061
They tight.

200
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,731
Then since I had this,
my pussy rate went--

201
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:44,861
I get more pussy from police ladies.
Everybody give me some pussy.

202
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,572
What up, Day-Day?

203
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,533
Oh, this lady is funny, man.

204
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,495
She used to own a record booth
at the Slauson swap meet.

205
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,998
She is funny as hell.
Come on.

206
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,833
What up, Mulan?

207
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:03,546
Hey, wait! Don't be steppin'
on those flowers, motherfucker.

208
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,132
I just planted that shit.

209
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,013
- Who's your boy?
- That's my cousin Craig from L.A.

210
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,849
Craig, meet Miss Ho.

211
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,935
Ho-Kym, motherfucker.

212
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,271
Day-Day's just trying
to be a smart-ass.

213
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,774
Nice to meet you, Craig.

214
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:34,494
Yo, Day-Day, something's going down
with those eses across the street.

215
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,123
Yeah, I've been seein'
a lot of activity.

216
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,084
What kind of activity?

217
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,797
Strange activity. I think
they're running drugs from Tijuana.

218
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,633
- Day-Day don't believe me.
- I ain't got time.

219
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,095
Got to go, Miss Ho.
I'm just kiddin'.

220
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:56,850
Come by after work.
I got the John Blaze shit for you.

221
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,061
Nice to meet you.

222
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,522
- Peace out, Craig.
- Peace out.

223
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,610
Yeah. Bye. See ya.

224
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,071
Man.

225
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,158
Nice hat.

226
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,871
I told you she was funny.

227
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,335
- Big house, ain't it?
- Yeah, it is.

228
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:29,174
Yeah. Y'all wish y'all had
one like this, didn't ya?

229
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,134
We do.

230
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:35,221
Daddy! Where my shirt at?

231
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,558
- Daddy, where my shirt?
- Which one? The pink one?

232
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:43,146
You have it here.
Ran out of toilet paper, son. Sorry.

233
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,899
- Sure was soft, though.
- You wiped your ass with my shirt?

234
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:50,945
Told you not to leave your shit
in the bathroom.

235
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,031
What you doin'?

236
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,700
This is a nice house, man.

237
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,786
I know. Thanks.

238
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,623
I just wish
Mama had a chance to see it.

239
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,919
You know she had a heart attack and died
when she found out we won the lottery.

240
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,962
I know the story.

241
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:12,759
If Mama had a chance to see this,
she'd have been so happy.

242
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,261
But that's how things work.

243
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,431
Well, I'm about to go to work...

244
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,685
something you might not never
know nothin' about.

245
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,647
- Know what I'm sayin'?
- Where you workin' at?

246
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,982
At Pinky's Record and Disc.

247
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,319
You can't live in this house
without a job.

248
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:37,033
So try to think about that,
'cause I got me a job.

249
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,161
Job, job, job.

250
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,931
Damn.

251
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,910
Suga!

252
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,706
I'm comin'!

253
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,921
Craig, I want you to meet
my old lady Suga.

254
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:35,633
Suga, my nephew Craig.

255
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,433
You even cuter
than your baby pictures.

256
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,643
Thank you.

257
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,484
We can keep it all in the family.

258
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,571
You got a fat ass.

259
00:19:56,821 --> 00:20:00,158
All right, that's enough!

260
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,410
Shit! That's enough!

261
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:06,247
Go back upstairs,
and put on some damn clothes!

262
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,584
- Go now!
- Help me out.

263
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,171
Nice meetin' you, Craig.

264
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,424
Nice to meet you.

265
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:25,183
That woman gonna be
the death of me one day.

266
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,937
Viagra ain't workin'.
My back keep goin' out.

267
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,774
That freak can't get enough
from your Uncle Elroy.

268
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:37,987
But check this out. Got to lay
some ground rules down on you.

269
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,950
- You family. I love you.
- I love you, too, Unc.

270
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,036
You welcome to anything
in my house...

271
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,123
but don't let me catch you
in my refrigerator...

272
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,959
or with your finger
in my sugar bowl.

273
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,586
- You feel me knockin'?
- I feel you.

274
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,172
Well, let me in.

275
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,508
Who is that with Day-Day's car?

276
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,136
That D'wana.

277
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,096
Boy's ex.

278
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,348
Hey, Day-Day!

279
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,934
That crazy bitch out there again!

280
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,646
- What's she doin' with that key?
- Damn.

281
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,607
- Aw, shit!
- Is she writin' on it?

282
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,986
- Scratchin' the shit out of it.
- Goddam!

283
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,410
What y'all just standin' there lookin'?
Do something!

284
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,537
Huggin', just standin' there.

285
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,545
You're supposed to be
1.000 feet away from my house!

286
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:40,008
Nigger, you can't quit me.
I'm pregnant with your baby.

287
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:43,094
That ain't my baby.

288
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,597
That's my baby right there.

289
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,474
Aw, man!

290
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:51,770
You keyed my--
Bitch, you keyed my--

291
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:55,106
I got your bitch right here.

292
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,649
Yeah, nigger.

293
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,569
Daddy, she sprayed me!

294
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,906
Shut up, you punk!
Don't nobody quit me.

295
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,909
Wait 'till I tell Baby D.
She gonna fuck you up!

296
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:10,997
- She sprayed the player!
- Better watch your back!

297
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:16,336
Be still. Boy, look like you got
a fatal attraction on your hands.

298
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,673
I had two or three of'em
in my day.

299
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:26,721
Craig, I hope you can handle your women
better than this fool can.

300
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:31,559
- That's too much water.
- Nah, it ain't. Take 20 minutes.

301
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,647
I've been pepper-sprayed nine times.
Take 20 minutes.

302
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:40,443
You got 19 to go.
Let me show you the backyard.

303
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,322
It's bigger than y'all's backyard.

304
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:48,284
Call the police and tell them
to get me another restraining order.

305
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:53,123
Yeah, you gotta have a little money
to live out here.

306
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:54,958
Oh, yeah?

307
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,460
I know what you're thinkin'.

308
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:01,923
I was the one back in the day always
talkin' about how I love the hood...

309
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,758
I love the ghetto.

310
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:07,721
I was the one sayin' I wasn't the kind
of nigger to run to the suburbs.

311
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,598
You're right, that's what I said.

312
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:15,061
But soon as I got my cheque,
I was gone!

313
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:19,899
Paid $230.000 cash on this place.

314
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:23,570
- You paid cash for this?
- Cash money!

315
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,906
Don't try to stick me
with some 30-year payment plan.

316
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,783
That's for suckers.

317
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,246
Got my daddy like that
years ago on a Cadillac.

318
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:37,459
I got the only house
on the block paid for.

319
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,962
That's why I'm the king around here!

320
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,424
You're the king, Unc.

321
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,093
How you like that pool?

322
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,936
- Big, ain't it?
- Yeah, it's cool.

323
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:00,106
But where the water at?

324
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,484
Don't need no water.

325
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,820
Ain't no pools in the projects.

326
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:09,199
None of us swim.

327
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,910
- So y'all never use it?
- Never.

328
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,246
But the Jacuzzi,
that's something else.

329
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:20,669
Me and my Suga
get real nasty in there.

330
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:27,634
Guess I left that in there.

331
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,348
You welcome to use it
any time you want.

332
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:37,811
Shit, you my brother's boy!

333
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,273
That's all right, Unc.
I can't swim neither.

334
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,443
No? Good.

335
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,446
I won't have to clean up
behind you then.

336
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:51,658
Come on.
Let me show you something else.

337
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,171
Man, you straight?

338
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,760
No, I ain't straight.
My eyes still red?

339
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,637
A little bit.

340
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:16,599
- A little bit?
- She fucked you up.

341
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:19,936
Can't taste nothin'.
My tongue is numb.

342
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:24,107
Why'd y'all let her do this shit?

343
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,818
It's your girl.

344
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:31,448
What's up with her, man?
She mean as hell.

345
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:35,243
I met D'wana
about three months ago.

346
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,956
She had a pudge on her stomach,
but I ain't pay no attention to it.

347
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:44,586
I thought it came from drinkin' 40's
'cause she had beer on her breath.

348
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:48,923
Turns out she's six months pregnant.
Told me I'm the baby's daddy.

349
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,885
- What?
- Yeah.

350
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,975
How you gonna be the baby's daddy?
You know she's lyin'.

351
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:03,521
I broke up with D'wana
two Fridays ago.

352
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:08,985
I got a restraining order on her,
and she don't care about that.

353
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,821
- What?
- She got me fuckin' up.

354
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:16,284
I broke up with her two months ago,
two Fridays ago...

355
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:22,248
and she don't care about
no restraining order or nothin'.

356
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:26,586
- You all right with them pants?
- Get out of my business.

357
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:30,799
How you gonna have
a restraining order on your girl?

358
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:35,011
What's up with y'all?
Where'd you meet her?

359
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,972
I was on my way to the 'hood
to buy them 20's.

360
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:44,145
I mean, them tens.
They're tens, but I keep 'em clean.

361
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:48,274
I was on my way,
and she had a burger in her hand.

362
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:51,861
I wanted a piece of it,
and I stopped.

363
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:56,658
We got to rappin'.
It was the worst day of my life!

364
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,618
Damn.

365
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,872
Psycho, huh?

366
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,209
She must be worse
than Left Eye from TLC.

367
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:10,171
But this fat bitch ain't burnin'.
That ain't the cold part.

368
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,799
She got a sister named Baby D.

369
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,635
This fat bitch get physical.

370
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:19,806
She sells dope, do hair and baby-sit
out ofthe same house.

371
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,600
The police don't know
when to go in.

372
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,645
I got a restraining order
on her too.

373
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,732
You got a restraining order
on a little girl named Baby D?

374
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,859
You don't know Baby D.

375
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,820
That's why you're lookin' at me,
'cause you don't know Baby D.

376
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:39,576
Her fat ass be snoring,
won't even be asleep, just standing.

377
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,831
Little cupcakes and shit--

378
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:48,960
This bitch know about all the new snacks
before they even hit the street.

379
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,296
All the bootleg snacks.

380
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,548
Year 2000 snacks.

381
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:59,763
Gonna tell me about a new Twinkie
comin' out next month.

382
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,098
It's a bad motherfucker.

383
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:08,063
When you bite into a cream-filled,
it shoot all over your mouth.

384
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:13,109
I'm getting ready to go to work.

385
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:18,573
'Cause I'm a player.
I don't have to deal with this shit.

386
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:22,285
You got your shirt on backwards.

387
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,162
Players fuck up.

388
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,748
Snatch that shit offyour head.

389
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,209
Don't worry about what I'm doin'!

390
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:33,088
Why didn't y'all do nothin'
when that fat bitch jumped on me?

391
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:38,134
Y'all a trip.
I'm running away from here.

392
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:40,845
- We gotta pull over.
- Be quiet!

393
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:44,808
- Fuckin' nuts is hurtin'.
- We got some business to take care of.

394
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,685
Shit! Mommy!

395
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:50,313
Keep your mind on the business, man!

396
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:53,233
I'm gonna kick Craig's butt.

397
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:58,738
Where we goin' anyway, man?

398
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:04,411
Damn, Debo.

399
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:07,956
Fuckin' ass is hurtin'.
What we doin' here anyway?

400
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:11,835
Close your mouth, I'll tell you.
This is how the plan goes.

401
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,798
Call over there and say you have
an urgent message for Mr. William Jones.

402
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:18,675
What urgent message?

403
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:23,346
The message is: "Drop everything.
Craig's in trouble. Come quick."

404
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:27,851
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- Just do it!

405
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,396
- I don't know the number.
- It's on the building.

406
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,982
Just pick the phone up.

407
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:41,072
I feel five pounds lighter.

408
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:46,661
What? Jealous?

409
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,538
What's that?

410
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:55,462
Come on! Where's my burrito?

411
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:59,924
What's wrong with you?
What kind of place is this?

412
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,469
Come on!
Give me my stuff!

413
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:07,557
Hello? I got an urgent message
for a nigger named Mr Willie--

414
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,601
- Willie who?
- It's William, fool!

415
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:14,022
I got an urgent message
for Mr. William Jones.

416
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:17,484
Yeah. The urgent message is:

417
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,862
"Drop everything.
Craig's in trouble. Come quick."

418
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,698
- Craig who? Who's this?
- Man, nigger!

419
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:27,744
Just tell him
he can call on Tyrone.

420
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:34,834
Tell him it's a friend of the family's.
When you gonna stop hittin' me?

421
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:39,297
I'm gonna bust your ass like Craig did,
knock your eyes straight.

422
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:44,761
- Hot sauce, please.
-Just a second.

423
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,013
Hot sauce, thank you.

424
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:50,308
Someone just called to say
Craig's in trouble.

425
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,936
- What?
- Craig's in trouble. I don't know.

426
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:57,357
What? Oh, man!
Hold on, Craig. I'm comin'.

427
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:01,111
- Give me my money. Come on.
-Just a second, man.

428
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:04,948
Come on, Taco Jim.
Give me my money.

429
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,284
Come on, man.
Give me my money.

430
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,787
Get the fuck outta here.

431
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,333
This is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen.

432
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,711
What you doin' out of the truck?

433
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:23,675
What the hell's
happening around here?

434
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:31,808
- Kiss my ass.
- Don't take my hot sauce.

435
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,648
This ain't bad, right?

436
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,775
Yeah, it is.

437
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:46,823
That scratch make it real ugly,
make you not even want to drive it.

438
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:01,338
Damn! Who is that?

439
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:03,757
Who?

440
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,633
That's their sister.

441
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:17,187
Damn. You know what?

442
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:20,523
I'm beginning to like
Rancho Cucamonga.

443
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,484
- Well, don't like it.
- Why not?

444
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,945
We need to improve on
black and brown relations.

445
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,283
Because there's been tension between us
and them since they got out the pen.

446
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,661
I am trying to keep it peaceful
around here.

447
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,998
I'm tryin' to have none
of that gangsta-thug stuff.

448
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:40,210
We livin' good,
eatin' shrimps and steak.

449
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,837
What you-- Don't do--

450
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:46,299
I'm tellin' you,
don't mess with her.

451
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,594
Slow down.
Damn, you walk fast.

452
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,848
- I'm Craig. What's your name?
- Karla.

453
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:58,269
Craig and Karla.
That sounds good together, huh?

454
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:00,522
Yeah, kind of.

455
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:03,108
She's a sack chaser, man!

456
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:06,861
I tried to hit it.
She wouldn't give me none.

457
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,406
I bet you don't get none.

458
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:13,034
I bet you don't get it.
I hope you don't get it.

459
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:18,123
- Where you goin'?
- To the Cucamonga Shopping Centre.

460
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:22,085
- Let it go, man!
- I told you.

461
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,421
Whites in hot and colours in cold.

462
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,674
Gonna ruin my Dickies!

463
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:33,638
Hold this! What the fuck?

464
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:37,058
You got a sexy voice.
Say something in Spanish.

465
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:52,449
I think Karla's got jungle fever!

466
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,534
You want a ride?

467
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,038
I don't know.

468
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:02,959
Fuck that. Hey, Cheeco!
It's lunchtime!

469
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:06,671
- We're gonna get you a ride.
- Run! Run!

470
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,298
What?

471
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:09,674
Cheeco! Run!

472
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,010
- Shit!
- Cheeco, no!

473
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,221
Get that fucker!
You know you like dark meat!

474
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:18,933
Those mayates are fast,
like they're sponsored by Nike.

475
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,895
Black man can jump.

476
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,607
Joker, get your dog!
This is bullshit!

477
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:28,234
Joker, call your dog!

478
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:34,908
Man, get off of my car!
Get off of my shit!

479
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:39,245
- I got something for him.
- Get him!

480
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:42,123
Get his ass. Yeah.
Fuck this!

481
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:46,586
I can't believe
he did that to our dog.

482
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:51,800
You Uncle Willie's son.
You don't play that shit.

483
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:57,222
Cruelty to animals!
Cruelty to animals!

484
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:59,933
Cheeco, get your ass over here!

485
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:05,563
That's wrong.
He did nothing to you.

486
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,569
Get down. Get down.

487
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:15,031
- Sorry.
- Come on.

488
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:17,409
Look at my roof.

489
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,247
You play too much.

490
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:27,335
If I get in trouble with them--
I got to live here! You don't!

491
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:30,922
You gonna get me in trouble!

492
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:34,134
Get out ofthe way!
Move! Just move!

493
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:38,471
Shit!

494
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:42,183
I was just trying to--

495
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:45,937
I was just trying to help
your scary ass.

496
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,444
You fuckin' hit my dog!

497
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,697
You're fucked up now!

498
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:59,701
You fucked him up for life!
He's scarred!

499
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:04,497
We'll get you back!

500
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:06,332
Fucker.

501
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,922
Nephew, you got perfect timing.

502
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:18,386
About to start a little puff-puff give
in this motherfucker.

503
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,930
Are you down?

504
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:23,808
Why don't you sit
next to your auntie.

505
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:43,411
I know you smoke
a little weed, right?

506
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:48,208
- Why you say that?
- 'Cause your lip's turning black.

507
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:56,049
Would you like some wine, baby?

508
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:58,968
No, thank you.

509
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:03,056
Well, how about a little cognac?

510
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:06,685
No. It's kind of early.

511
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:11,272
Shit, I can roll a blunt
better than them bitches in Havana.

512
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:16,569
I know Willie don't let you smoke
in his house...

513
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:19,531
but I'm your Uncle Elroy!

514
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:23,034
I don't give a damn
how high you get in mine...

515
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:27,414
as long as you let me hit it.

516
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:29,499
Look at that.

517
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,335
Fire that shit up, boy.

518
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:36,423
I'm about to show y'all
who the real Puff Daddy is!

519
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:56,109
Unc.

520
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,034
Baby?

521
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,921
It's the Bombay!

522
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:47,160
Think they really went to the moon?

523
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:50,663
They say they went to the moon.

524
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:54,084
There ain't no gravity out there.

525
00:38:57,337 --> 00:39:01,549
That mean we can get high
and never come down.

526
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:17,774
What numbers did you pick?

527
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:21,611
Your original aunt picked...

528
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,781
six numbers.

529
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:28,410
She used her weight, I think.

530
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:30,870
Goddam.

531
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,172
I know why you got her now.

532
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,436
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

533
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:59,983
Put some hot sauce
on my burrito, baby

534
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:03,361
Don't you know it's good to me

535
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:08,450
Debo! Debo!

536
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:14,247
- What?
- I can't feel my legs, man!

537
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:17,959
Put some hot sauce
on my burrito, baby

538
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:22,339
You know you look good to me

539
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:24,632
Oh, man, that's good.

540
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:28,261
Just hold on, Craig.
I'm comin', son.

541
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:10,095
Negro, what the hell
you doin' to my woman?

542
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:14,724
I don't know.
I must--

543
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:18,061
- Suga?
- Huh?

544
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:21,606
What the hell you doin'
to my nephew?

545
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,985
I thought that was you, baby.

546
00:41:26,194 --> 00:41:27,946
Come on, baby.

547
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:31,783
I'm faded, feelin' X-rated.

548
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,661
It's Mr. Nasty time.

549
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:39,082
Oh, Mr. Nasty time.

550
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:41,960
It's Mr. Nasty time.

551
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,671
Take it easy on my back.

552
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:47,173
Be back in a minute.

553
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:57,183
Make yourself at home, nephew.

554
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:59,644
- Come on.
- Thanks.

555
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:14,909
- That's it, that's it.
- Yeah, yeah.

556
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:24,461
Call me Elroy!

557
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:34,220
- Damn, Unc.
- That's enough.

558
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:37,974
Get that shit.

559
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:18,723
Papi, I wish I was
with you right now.

560
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,184
Yeah, me too.

561
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:27,857
Yeah? Well, you ever heard
of EI Niño?

562
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:30,360
Yeah.

563
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:35,448
Well, this is EI Negro.
Come here and let me tap that ass.

564
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:42,163
Delivery.

565
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:45,834
Got a delivery!

566
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:53,174
- Who is it?
- Got a delivery. Come on, spark plug.

567
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:56,886
I got a delivery.
It's hot out here, buddy.

568
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:59,222
Come on, sparky.

569
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:02,183
- What's up?
- Nice house.

570
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:06,062
I didn't expect you to answer,
but this is a fine place.

571
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,899
What are you,
one of those entertainer guys?

572
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:13,069
Do you play sports?
What team you play for?

573
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:16,698
I play for
the Cucamonga Cracker Killers.

574
00:44:16,948 --> 00:44:18,575
Don't want any trouble.

575
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:23,747
You don't have to send your posse
out here to do a 187 in my ass.

576
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:28,710
Just got a little mail
for you to sign, partner.

577
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:34,174
- What's this?
- A delinquent property tax notice.

578
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:36,634
I hope the Cracker Killers pay well.

579
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:39,471
Otherwise, it's back
to the ghetto you go.

580
00:44:39,637 --> 00:44:42,557
Take it easy.
Hustlin 'and survivin '

581
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:45,685
Goodtimes

582
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:48,146
Oh, fuck!

583
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:51,024
Good boy! Heel!

584
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,448
"Your house will be seized
and auctioned...

585
00:44:58,656 --> 00:45:01,284
tomorrow at 9:00 a.m."

586
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:07,957
Tomorrow?

587
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:14,047
Uncle Elroy, you got some mail.

588
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:23,223
Uncle Elroy, you got a notice.

589
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:07,684
Damn.

590
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:10,186
Unc is a freak.

591
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,707
Unc, you got this tax notice, man.

592
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:39,424
Come here!
I'll tear that ass up again!

593
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:42,761
I like it when you treat me rough!

594
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:45,472
God, man, what you doin'?

595
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:51,686
Get your hands off my ass, girl!

596
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:55,398
Let me go!
Let me go, goddam it!

597
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,246
Yo, Day-Day, check it out.

598
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:19,381
If Pinky come in and see you doin'
that X-Game shit off the counter...

599
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:21,257
we'll get fired.

600
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:25,011
Motherfuckers! You motherfuckers!
What the fuck is this?

601
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:27,555
- You motherfuckers!
- Can I help you?

602
00:47:27,722 --> 00:47:30,433
Yes. What is this, huh?

603
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:34,270
This is rock.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.

604
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:37,524
Where's the damn manager?
That Pink motherfucker.

605
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:40,485
The manager's not here.
I'm running the store.

606
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:43,988
You look like the player-hater
who sold me this shit.

607
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:47,575
Give me my money back now!
And I have no damn receipt.

608
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:50,120
- Where's the cover?
- I have no damn cover!

609
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:54,374
- Kiss my ass! So what?
- Can I see it, sir?

610
00:47:56,334 --> 00:47:59,421
You been chewin' on this
before you came here?

611
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:03,008
Bullshit! You know
who you're fucking with?

612
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:07,012
- Bishop Tutu?
- Try again, motherfucker.

613
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:10,223
- Winnie Mandela's little--
- Try again, motherfucker!

614
00:48:10,473 --> 00:48:12,100
Just an ugly black dude.

615
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:14,644
I'll go postal on this motherfucker!

616
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:18,356
You better get your hostile ass
out of here.

617
00:48:18,523 --> 00:48:21,026
You bitch.

618
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:23,737
Oh, shit!

619
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:29,659
Don't hit me. This is John Blaze.
I can get jiggy with it.

620
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:33,163
- Get your ass out of here!
- I'm just a bitch-ass nigger.

621
00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:36,249
- Don't hit me!
- You see that?

622
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:43,631
- How'd you get out here?
- I walked.

623
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:47,260
You can't walk around this white
neighbourhood. You look suspect.

624
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:50,013
Y'all got a notice,
certified mail.

625
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:54,309
Craig, this is Roach,
my white slave.

626
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,772
Roach works around the store
doin' anything I tell him to.

627
00:48:58,938 --> 00:49:01,358
That's my cousin Craig
who beat up Debo.

628
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:03,610
What's up, bro?

629
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,571
- What's up?
- What do we got?

630
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,621
- You know what this is?
- What is it?

631
00:49:14,871 --> 00:49:17,957
Get the phone!
You wouldn't know about this.

632
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:21,711
- This is black problems.
- Pinky's.

633
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:25,256
Yeah.

634
00:49:25,423 --> 00:49:30,136
We probably don't owe too much 'cause
we ain't been spending money that much.

635
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:33,932
- Oh, man!
- What?

636
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:36,559
We owe $3900 by tomorrow.

637
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:39,145
Shit, man!

638
00:49:39,312 --> 00:49:41,648
How much y'all got
from the lottery?

639
00:49:41,856 --> 00:49:44,859
I don't know.
I bought some shoes.

640
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:47,570
I gotta check my book.

641
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:50,573
- Check your bank book.
- Go back here with me.

642
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:55,620
That African might have circled
around the block or something.

643
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:02,085
Yeah, he's here.

644
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:05,672
No, he's right here.
All right.

645
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:10,135
- $247.
- That's it?

646
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:14,222
- Who was that?
- This girl named D'wana.

647
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:20,395
-She's outside and wants to talk to you.
-Come here. Get over here.

648
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,147
Shit.

649
00:50:44,586 --> 00:50:48,798
- What's the matter?
- D'wana brought Baby D's fat ass here.

650
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:53,094
Come on, D.
Let's fuck this nigger up.

651
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:07,901
That white boy
said he was in here.

652
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:11,696
Day-Day! Don't make me
break this window!

653
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:14,324
- Craig, do me a favour.
- What?

654
00:51:14,532 --> 00:51:19,496
- Go tell them I ain't here.
- Hell no. I ain't in it.

655
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:24,125
- You already in it, cuz.
- I'll just go do it.

656
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:27,962
Get your ass back here!
What the fuck you doin'?

657
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:33,134
She'll sit on your little ass.
Craig gotta do it.

658
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:36,221
He beat Debo ass.

659
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,557
And he cold. Craig?

660
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:42,185
You gonna do that for me?

661
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:47,148
Go ahead, man.

662
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:54,572
Hurry up, nigger!

663
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:56,658
Shut up.

664
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,331
That don't look like Day-Day.

665
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,087
Open the door.

666
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:13,883
Day-Day ain't here.

667
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:16,511
- Who are you?
- I'm his cousin.

668
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:18,972
We didn't come here for Day-Day.

669
00:52:19,222 --> 00:52:22,308
- Yes, you did.
- No, we came to buy a CD.

670
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,936
- Move!
- Punk.

671
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:34,112
These whores ain't got no manners.

672
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:42,620
Where that boy tellin' me
Day-Day was here?

673
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:47,709
I don't know. I think he went
out back to throw away some boxes.

674
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:51,921
- Well, can I look for myself?
- No, you cannot.

675
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:57,635
- Hey, ladies.
- Where's Day-Day?

676
00:52:57,844 --> 00:53:01,848
- I thought y'all wanted to buy a CD.
- I do.

677
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:05,435
Can you show me
where thejazz section is?

678
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:07,645
Jazz?

679
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:13,109
You know damn well
you don't want to hear jazz.

680
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,195
Come on.

681
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:20,325
I know y'all playin' games.

682
00:53:20,533 --> 00:53:24,371
If Day-Day come back,
tell him I need to see him...

683
00:53:24,537 --> 00:53:27,749
'cause the child-carin' classes
start on Wednesday.

684
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:31,920
Come on, D.
I ain't got time for this. Wait.

685
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:34,547
Ain't your restroom this way?

686
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,634
You better have some toilet paper.

687
00:53:37,884 --> 00:53:42,472
- Damn!
- Here he is! Baby, here he is!

688
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:44,849
Here, Baby! Get him!

689
00:53:51,731 --> 00:53:55,568
Come on. You better go on
with the bullshit.

690
00:53:55,735 --> 00:53:57,445
Do something about it!

691
00:53:57,612 --> 00:54:01,282
Why don't y'all do something
about this shit?

692
00:54:08,873 --> 00:54:11,710
- Come on!
- She moves well for a big girl.

693
00:54:18,508 --> 00:54:20,760
You better quit with the bullshit!

694
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:25,473
-You better stop runnin' from that girl.
-Fuck you!

695
00:54:25,724 --> 00:54:30,311
Come on, big Baby D.
D'wana, I don't even like you like that.

696
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:34,399
- Somebody call Jenny Craig.
- Hello. Remember me?

697
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:40,196
Hell, yeah, I remember you.

698
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:44,034
I'm sorry about what my brothers
did to you this morning.

699
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:45,910
They're just assholes.

700
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:48,496
You don't have to apologize
for your brothers.

701
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:54,961
I wanted to give you this.

702
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:57,464
If my brothers weren't
so overprotective...

703
00:54:57,672 --> 00:55:02,010
I'd have you call the house, but for now
page me when you get a chance.

704
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,347
- I'll do that.
- Better sooner than later.

705
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:07,223
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

706
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:09,684
Shit, it might be tonight.

707
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:11,895
Get your ass back!

708
00:55:14,522 --> 00:55:17,275
Baby D, go on with the bullshit!

709
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:23,198
You ain't gonna catch me,
as usual.

710
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:27,786
Let's make a deal while we can.
You're not gonna catch me.

711
00:55:27,994 --> 00:55:30,997
What you want?
Another Big Pun CD? Kelly Price?

712
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:33,333
- Luther Vandross?
- Hell, no.

713
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:37,462
That ain't gonna do?
How about that?

714
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:41,174
Just like you had in thejail
commissary-- without the wrapper.

715
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:43,134
You can get to it quick.

716
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:47,263
- I'm on a diet.
- No, your fat ass ain't.

717
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:49,974
Yeah. Taste it, Baby D.

718
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:52,936
Damn, it's good! Eat that--

719
00:55:54,396 --> 00:55:59,401
- Your cousin Craig, hook us up.
- That's it?

720
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:05,782
Just tell him to come over here
and talk to me.

721
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:10,286
- And I can go free?
- Go before I change my mind!

722
00:56:17,585 --> 00:56:19,671
What happened?

723
00:56:19,796 --> 00:56:23,883
Made a deal.
All you gotta do is go over there.

724
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:28,096
- You gotta talk to her.
- What do you mean, "talk to her"?

725
00:56:28,346 --> 00:56:32,058
- She want to talk to you.
- Talk to me?

726
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:39,149
Go talk to her.
Mother love. Fat--

727
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:45,321
I'm gone.

728
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:49,784
- Come on!
- Day-Day, I'm gonna kill your ass!

729
00:56:49,951 --> 00:56:52,495
You gotta come outside sometime!

730
00:56:54,372 --> 00:56:58,710
See, I done told you.
I done told you.

731
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:05,300
Why you let her do this shit?

732
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:08,970
- What was that?
- You don't wanna know.

733
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:13,683
- Thanks a lot, Craig.
- Look.

734
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:17,270
We cousins, but don't be tryin'
to hook me up...

735
00:57:17,437 --> 00:57:20,523
with the little sister
that's bigger than the big sister.

736
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:24,944
- Fat bitches need love, too, Craig.
- For sure.

737
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:35,747
Oh, man!

738
00:57:35,997 --> 00:57:38,249
Oh, my stomach.

739
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:41,586
Say, let me get by!

740
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:46,299
Too much hot sauce.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

741
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,973
I gotta go to the bathroom.

742
00:57:55,558 --> 00:57:58,061
Let me over!

743
00:58:00,146 --> 00:58:01,898
Somebody help me, please!

744
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:05,568
Too much traffic.

745
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:09,114
What's this traffic doin'?

746
00:58:09,322 --> 00:58:13,076
Hey, y'all, move over!
Move up! Everybody, move!

747
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:27,298
- Worst day of my life.
- Damn, you sad.

748
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:30,385
I know how you're feelin', man.

749
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:34,806
If I had my bong on me now,
I'd let you toke 'till you choke.

750
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:36,808
I got this, though.

751
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:45,734
- What's that green shit hangin' out?
- That's chronic, dude. Try it.

752
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:54,951
I ain't got no bong
or no bullshit brownie, but voilà.

753
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,494
Whoa!

754
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:00,498
I'm the one with the problems!

755
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:05,086
- Shit.
- Enjoy, man.

756
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:13,470
Better open that window
before the smell get out.

757
00:59:13,636 --> 00:59:16,973
- These windows don't work in here.
- I got an idea.

758
00:59:17,182 --> 00:59:21,394
It's just a theory, but it should work.
Check this out.

759
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,696
- Blow?
- Yeah, blow.

760
00:59:31,863 --> 00:59:35,158
- That ain't gonna work.
- Fuck yeah.

761
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:45,460
- It works.
- Still gonna smell it.

762
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:48,963
Uh-uh. Watch.

763
00:59:59,724 --> 01:00:01,434
Stop bullshittin'!

764
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:11,820
- Stop bullshittin'!
- My fault, my fault.

765
01:00:11,986 --> 01:00:17,158
You better stop playin' so much!
Almost sucked my motherfuckin' lip up!

766
01:01:01,536 --> 01:01:03,621
Look here, baby.

767
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:07,000
You hittin' them corners
too goddam fast.

768
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:10,211
You need to slow
this motherfucker down.

769
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:15,383
I almost spilled my yak
on this $200 suit, nigger.

770
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:18,762
Come on, baby,
get it together. Damn.

771
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:24,934
Yeah, whatever, motherfucker.

772
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,746
Shit.

773
01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:01,096
Roach, what you doin'?

774
01:02:10,563 --> 01:02:12,899
I caught a bad one again.

775
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:15,360
You busters is bitches

776
01:02:15,568 --> 01:02:19,197
You can't get your money
from your bitches

777
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:23,535
- Get back!
- Stop that bullshit, man!

778
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:26,663
This vacuum shit don't work, man.

779
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:30,583
Don't grab on Pinky's shit
like that.

780
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,295
You company man.

781
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:37,799
"Don't grab on Pinky's shit
like that."

782
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:40,510
- Nigger, this is how l--
- Pinky?

783
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:44,931
Pinky used to be a player.
I heard about Pinky--

784
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:47,308
Where the bathroom at?

785
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:49,644
Go to the right.

786
01:02:49,811 --> 01:02:53,523
Don't do that, man!
You gonna burn my Pinky shirt!

787
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:56,735
I was just gonna get a promotion!

788
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:04,159
Light an incense in there too.

789
01:03:04,325 --> 01:03:09,039
You stanky, booty-ass, little boy.
What's up, Roach?

790
01:03:09,247 --> 01:03:11,124
You bust your shit?

791
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:15,795
Don't move!

792
01:03:19,549 --> 01:03:24,220
I'll blow your goddam head
smooth off.

793
01:03:26,097 --> 01:03:28,433
Now, back up.

794
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:30,935
Slowly!

795
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:33,146
Don't say a word.

796
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,362
- Hey, man--
- I said, don't say a word.

797
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,822
Craig went to take a doo-doo.

798
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:47,410
You ain't seen him
gettin' nothin' in the-- to try to--

799
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:51,748
-He miss?
-He don't try to make it fresh in there.

800
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:54,959
Come on.

801
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:58,588
Little motherfucker
gonna try to rob me.

802
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:03,635
I'm gonna show you
how we do it here in Pinky's.

803
01:04:03,843 --> 01:04:06,721
- I wasn't tryin' to rob--
- Shut up!

804
01:04:06,971 --> 01:04:10,350
Before I bust a cap up in your ass.

805
01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:14,312
What you gone done
with Day-Day and Roach?

806
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:16,981
- Day-Day is my--
- Shut up!

807
01:04:19,484 --> 01:04:24,280
- Now, who sent you, nigger?
- Nobody sent--

808
01:04:24,447 --> 01:04:30,745
Say another motherfuckin' word,
and this shit is over!

809
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:33,498
And I ain't playin', nigger!

810
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:38,837
Now...

811
01:04:39,045 --> 01:04:42,173
you ain't got no gun...

812
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:45,135
but where the weed at?

813
01:04:45,385 --> 01:04:49,222
- I ain't got no--
- Shut the fuck-- Shut--

814
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:51,599
Did I say--

815
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:55,395
Oh, shit, say it again!
Say something else!

816
01:04:57,605 --> 01:05:00,984
Say something else!
Say something else, nigger!

817
01:05:03,319 --> 01:05:07,198
I'm gonna tie your monkey-ass up.

818
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:10,535
Oh, shit!

819
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:18,585
He been doo-dooin' a long time.

820
01:05:18,793 --> 01:05:22,422
When he was a kid,
he doo-dooed in church.

821
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:27,135
The pastor was the only one that could
stay in there through the blessings.

822
01:05:27,385 --> 01:05:30,013
I got your ass!

823
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,059
Oh, shit.

824
01:05:41,399 --> 01:05:43,818
Craig doo-dooed
in the swimming pool.

825
01:05:43,943 --> 01:05:48,656
- We were swimming when we were little.
- Did it float up like a submarine?

826
01:05:48,823 --> 01:05:52,410
I was swimming, and I thought
it was a chocolate PayDay.

827
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:56,623
I was swimmin' like a motherfucker,
and something just went--

828
01:05:56,831 --> 01:05:58,708
It kind of hit my--

829
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:03,421
I got this motherfucker!

830
01:06:10,136 --> 01:06:13,723
Gonna blow up
where I make my money at.

831
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:15,934
Is he comin'?

832
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:19,938
Let me tell you something.
Can I say something to you?

833
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:24,109
- I love you, man.
- Either be smokin' or be passin' that.

834
01:06:38,331 --> 01:06:42,460
I got to think of a way
to get this money by tomorrow.

835
01:06:42,585 --> 01:06:46,047
- Huh?
- I gotta think of-- "Huh?"

836
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:49,009
I gotta get this money by tomorrow.

837
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:54,014
- You could sell your Beemer.
- I can do what?

838
01:06:54,222 --> 01:06:56,683
- Sell your car.
- Sell your mama's car.

839
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:59,436
I'm not sellin' my car, man.

840
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:03,773
- My bad.
- Don't say nothin' like that.

841
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:06,818
- I know you love that car.
- Hell, yeah.

842
01:07:06,985 --> 01:07:09,320
I gotta think of a plan.

843
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:13,908
I hope Craig got some kind of plan
while he takin' a shit.

844
01:07:14,075 --> 01:07:17,412
- He in there a long time.
- Yeah, he in there a long time.

845
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,749
Let's clean up
before Pinky get back.

846
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,799
What's up, baby?
Come on, young blood. Don't kill me.

847
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:32,761
Shut up!

848
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:37,349
I been tryin' to tell your ass
that Day-Day's my cousin.

849
01:07:37,557 --> 01:07:39,184
He in the back.

850
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:41,895
Whatever you say, baby.

851
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:48,360
I swear to God, man, the combination
to the safe is 34-5-27, man.

852
01:07:48,568 --> 01:07:52,072
Just take it all, baby.
It's all yours. Just don't kill me.

853
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:56,534
I got kids, a motherfuckin' girlfriend
and a wife on the side.

854
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,161
Shut up!

855
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:04,084
Don't kill me!
Goddam, don't kill me!

856
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:10,674
- Craig, what you doin'?
- Nothin'.

857
01:08:12,175 --> 01:08:15,970
- Huh?
- Is this your cousin?

858
01:08:16,137 --> 01:08:20,350
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Good. Then you fired.

859
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:23,019
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

860
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:24,896
I'm fired?

861
01:08:25,063 --> 01:08:28,775
- Roach, you fired too.
- Why you gotta fire me for?

862
01:08:28,983 --> 01:08:32,362
Shut up! Shut up!

863
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:35,323
You better keep
your goddam mouth shut!

864
01:08:35,532 --> 01:08:38,868
- Bobby Womack.
- I heard that shit. Say it again.

865
01:08:40,495 --> 01:08:42,747
Shit!

866
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:46,584
And you lucky.

867
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:51,172
I was just fixin'
to get up in your ass.

868
01:08:51,423 --> 01:08:55,135
Give me my pistol!
Get out of my store.

869
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:57,721
Shut up!

870
01:08:57,887 --> 01:09:01,099
Punk ass.

871
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:04,811
Tryin' to rob me.
Nigger, I'm Pinky.

872
01:09:06,896 --> 01:09:10,358
That nigger had me scared,
but I held my own.

873
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:15,947
Fat bitch is bustin' my windows
all the time.

874
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:19,659
I knew you shouldn't--
When you goin' home?

875
01:09:19,909 --> 01:09:21,786
D's sayin '.

876
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:27,876
In a strange way, I feel responsible
for Day-Day gettin 'fired.

877
01:09:28,084 --> 01:09:32,672
If I wouldn 't have fought Pinky
and gave Day-Day that joint...

878
01:09:32,922 --> 01:09:35,884
he'd still have a job by now.

879
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:38,261
Roach too.

880
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,221
That's true.

881
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:42,849
Got to think of something...

882
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:47,020
- Fat bitch bust my windows--
- as soon as he shut the fuck up.

883
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:51,775
You ain't even help me.
You watched her do the shit.

884
01:09:53,568 --> 01:09:57,322
And you quit hanging around
black people. You see how we live?

885
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:01,785
We live wild. We live rough.
I'm tellin' you.

886
01:10:36,736 --> 01:10:40,031
Damn, Daddy,
I didn't know you had titties.

887
01:10:42,075 --> 01:10:45,745
We got a certifiied this
in the mail today.

888
01:10:51,584 --> 01:10:55,797
And I got fired today.

889
01:10:58,383 --> 01:10:59,884
Daddy!

890
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:05,598
Mr White Man, tell me what happened.
What's up there?

891
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:09,894
Mister, I gotta go help my son.
Let me over, please. Let me over.

892
01:11:10,061 --> 01:11:14,774
I gotta help myself too.
I got a burning in my stomach.

893
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:18,611
My stomach hurts. Oh, man.

894
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,698
Officer, please.
Don't just drive past me.

895
01:11:21,906 --> 01:11:23,408
Officer!

896
01:11:23,658 --> 01:11:26,661
How long we gotta ride
in this stupid-ass van anyway?

897
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:30,957
Fuck, I don't know. Shut up, man! Raise
your hand if you want to talk to me!

898
01:11:33,585 --> 01:11:36,421
Man, what we gonna do?

899
01:11:36,671 --> 01:11:39,174
I don't know yet.

900
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:41,426
I know what I'm gonna do.

901
01:11:41,634 --> 01:11:44,012
I'm goin' home and face the music.

902
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:48,224
My dad finds out I got fired again,
man, he's gonna kick my ass.

903
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:52,645
- Sorry about today.
- Yeah, me too. Later.

904
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:06,451
- My board!
- Get the board!

905
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:16,211
My skateboard.

906
01:12:16,461 --> 01:12:19,297
Let's play some quarters and shit.
And don't forget the chips.

907
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:26,471
- What the fuck you lookin' at?
- Nothin'. I--

908
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:33,186
- You broke my board.
- It shouldn't have been in the street.

909
01:12:35,313 --> 01:12:38,650
Take me to Judge Judy. Let's go.

910
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:42,112
- Who the fuck are those guys, Day-Day?
- Let it go, man. Trust me.

911
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,156
I ain't lettin' shit go, man!
They broke my skateboard!

912
01:12:45,323 --> 01:12:48,993
- Let it go! Trust me.
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait! Look.

913
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:55,709
- You see that?
- I ain't see nothin'.

914
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:58,795
Must be money or somethin'
in that hydraulic pump.

915
01:12:58,962 --> 01:13:01,548
Yeah, air.

916
01:13:01,798 --> 01:13:05,885
It's somethin' better than air.
I could tell how funny he act.

917
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:09,347
Hey, how's it goin', boy?
Come here. Yeah, boy, come here.

918
01:13:09,597 --> 01:13:13,810
Hey! What are you doin'?
Get the fuck off me!

919
01:13:14,019 --> 01:13:16,521
How do you know for sure?
It could be any damn thing in that pump.

920
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:20,608
I don't know. It could be anything, but
I say we go over there and take a look.

921
01:13:20,859 --> 01:13:23,111
I say you go by your damn self.

922
01:13:23,361 --> 01:13:27,407
I'm not fuckin' with them eses. Y'all go
over there and tag team and that shit.

923
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:30,869
All we need is
a big-ass pack of bologna.

924
01:13:33,246 --> 01:13:36,249
- Bologna?
- Yeah, bologna!

925
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:43,882
Want me to get cheese and the hot plate?
We can cook over there. Eat with them--

926
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:47,135
Man, just go get the bologna.
Hurry up.

927
01:13:53,308 --> 01:13:57,520
Is that a gas station over there?
Here we go. That's a gas station.

928
01:14:00,273 --> 01:14:02,525
Get out the way, man!
Come on! Move!

929
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:05,070
This fool can't drive for shit!

930
01:14:06,237 --> 01:14:12,410
Guess I'm gonna have to kill that dad
of his, too, when I finish with Craig.

931
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:16,247
Hey, man, get out the way!
Get out ofthe way! Hurry up!

932
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:18,708
You look! I got some business
to take care of!

933
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:21,795
- Fuck you, asshole!
- I hope the bathroom is clean.

934
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:26,049
If it ain't, I don't give a damn.

935
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:30,136
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, me.

936
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:40,188
Damn! I knew I shouldn't
have eaten all that hot sauce.

937
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:50,073
Sabu! I've seen all your movies, man.
Oh, you bad.

938
01:14:50,323 --> 01:14:53,535
Ridin' that magic carpet.
They ain't got to worry about no gas.

939
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:58,123
Can I get the key to the bathroom?
I don't wanna buy no hubcap.

940
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:00,458
It is here.

941
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,295
And say hello to Qaddafi for me.

942
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:13,972
- Hey!
- Hey!

943
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:16,474
Come on out of there!
I got an emergency here!

944
01:15:16,683 --> 01:15:20,895
- Hold on!
- Come on, man! Come on out of there.

945
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:25,358
- Who's bangin' on this friggin' door--
- Come on outta here.

946
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:27,861
- Mr. Jones?
- Stanley?

947
01:15:28,111 --> 01:15:30,572
- How are ya?
- What are you doin' here?

948
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:35,160
I'm looking for a new house out here.
I have to move out ofthe hood.

949
01:15:35,368 --> 01:15:38,371
- The crime is really getting bad.
- Yeah, I gotta go.

950
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:43,126
I wouldn't recommend that anybody
go in there for at least 35, 45 minutes.

951
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:45,712
It's smelling pretty bad.
I don't know what happened.

952
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,506
Get the fuck outta my face!

953
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:53,887
Oh, Lord!

954
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:03,688
Thank God.

955
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:11,946
Come on. Stay down.

956
01:16:16,993 --> 01:16:19,621
- Y'all ready?
- No.

957
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:21,581
Come on.

958
01:16:25,585 --> 01:16:28,088
There's Joker! Run!
Goddam it! Run!

959
01:16:33,718 --> 01:16:36,221
I don't see nobody.

960
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:38,098
Come on.

961
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:42,519
Hurry up.

962
01:16:46,898 --> 01:16:49,484
Nice booty.

963
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:53,571
- Come here. You can have some.
- You know I do.

964
01:16:55,448 --> 01:16:59,619
- Where you goin', baby?
- Right over here.

965
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:02,706
I'm nervous, man.
I got the BG's.

966
01:17:02,872 --> 01:17:06,584
- What's the BG's?
- The bubble guts.

967
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:10,046
I'm nervous, and
I'm about to shit on myself.

968
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:13,508
Keep a tight ass.
Try and hold it in or somethin'.

969
01:17:13,758 --> 01:17:15,260
Shut up.

970
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:17,971
That sound like butterflies to me.

971
01:17:18,138 --> 01:17:20,974
Butterflies, your ass.
I'm about to go home.

972
01:17:21,224 --> 01:17:27,022
Look, look. If we don't go do this,
you ain't gonna have no home to go to.

973
01:17:27,188 --> 01:17:31,860
All we gotta do is find out
where the little one put that pump...

974
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:34,696
take it and see what's in it.

975
01:17:34,946 --> 01:17:39,659
You're in the Kentucky Derby.
I'll take this off.

976
01:17:43,371 --> 01:17:45,248
Oh, shit.

977
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:49,961
Go, Flea Biscuit.

978
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,047
Thought you were gonna
take me to see Mommy.

979
01:17:54,674 --> 01:17:58,219
I'm a little preoccupied right now.

980
01:17:59,637 --> 01:18:01,097
I'll take you later.

981
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:03,683
When? After you're
all drunk and loaded?

982
01:18:03,933 --> 01:18:07,062
I said I'll take
your stupid ass later, all right?

983
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:09,856
Get the fuck outta here.
You're ruining my company.

984
01:18:19,824 --> 01:18:22,911
- What's this silver thing right here?
- What silver thing?

985
01:18:25,622 --> 01:18:29,959
We got to count that shit.
Get up.

986
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:33,046
Business first.

987
01:18:33,296 --> 01:18:35,674
Hey, Baby Joker, come on.

988
01:18:35,882 --> 01:18:38,009
Forgot about the business.

989
01:18:39,386 --> 01:18:45,475
I need you to occupy that dog long
enough for me and Day-Day to get a look.

990
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:49,270
Me and dogs don't get along, bro.

991
01:18:49,437 --> 01:18:53,358
- Get along with this one.
- Shit. What's his name?

992
01:18:53,525 --> 01:18:57,946
Cheeco. You've got to go ahead of us.
Don't get seen.

993
01:18:58,113 --> 01:19:00,949
And for damn sure,
don't let that mutt out your sight.

994
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,159
Go, go, go!

995
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:08,998
- Dog, we scored today, fool.
- Yeah!

996
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:13,336
- What's that on my leg?
- What is that, dog?

997
01:19:13,586 --> 01:19:16,673
Forget it. I think
it's yogurt or something.

998
01:19:27,934 --> 01:19:29,644
Here, Cheeco.

999
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:40,697
Get off my ass, man.

1000
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:48,913
Get down! You guys are better
than the Soul Train dancers.

1001
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:51,249
Look at them old bitties.

1002
01:19:51,499 --> 01:19:53,793
God!

1003
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,963
Come on. Let's go. Get up.

1004
01:19:59,799 --> 01:20:02,218
All right, go first.

1005
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:06,931
- Go first.
- No, nigger, you go first!

1006
01:20:07,098 --> 01:20:09,809
I'm not goin' first.

1007
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:13,521
If you don't hit that fence,
I'm gonna throw you over.

1008
01:20:13,772 --> 01:20:16,232
Nigger, I'm not--
We ain't little no more.

1009
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:20,945
That's the thing about it.
Come on. Come on!

1010
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:24,949
What you talkin' about?
We ain't little? What?

1011
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:27,285
Come on, nigger.

1012
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:29,245
- Pussy.
- It ain't like that.

1013
01:20:29,412 --> 01:20:31,873
Get your ass up.

1014
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:53,770
- Stop playing.
- I broke a butt cheek.

1015
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:57,899
- Come on.
- Shit, man.

1016
01:20:58,108 --> 01:21:00,193
What, man?

1017
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,112
Fuck.

1018
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:08,493
Come here, boy.

1019
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,995
Come on, Cheeco.

1020
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:13,498
Be a good boy.

1021
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,710
Shit! Oh, shit.

1022
01:21:19,045 --> 01:21:22,424
- Fuck this shit.
- Hey, hey. Wait.

1023
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:31,099
- Who's got the money--
- He's still over there.

1024
01:21:31,224 --> 01:21:33,768
- Hundreds, fifties.
- Roach still got him.

1025
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:43,486
- What do we do with these ones?
- Fuck it. Give it to charity.

1026
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:46,823
Fuck it.
Charity starts in "la casa".

1027
01:21:47,032 --> 01:21:49,909
- We can give it to the bitches.
- It is money in that pump.

1028
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:51,786
- It is?
- Yeah.

1029
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:54,247
A good boy. Come on.

1030
01:21:55,373 --> 01:21:57,584
Here you go. Good boy.

1031
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:02,922
Good boy. I got
some good bologna for you.

1032
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:08,011
Good boy. Eat it all up.

1033
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:11,181
Okay, you ate it all up.

1034
01:22:19,147 --> 01:22:21,858
Is that Cheeco?
What's wrong with him?

1035
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:25,945
I don't know.
That dog got issues.

1036
01:22:27,947 --> 01:22:31,659
So what's wrong with my perro?
What'd you do to my dog, fool?

1037
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:36,873
Nothing. Just keep
counting the money.

1038
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:43,296
Hey, fuck that shit. Do it later.

1039
01:22:43,546 --> 01:22:47,384
It's fuckin' Friday.
We got fuckin' bitches.

1040
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:49,719
It's fuckin' time to party.

1041
01:22:49,886 --> 01:22:52,597
Shut the door. What's wrong with you?
Don't you got no manners?

1042
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:56,184
- What's wrong with you?
- Fuckin' snapper.

1043
01:22:56,226 --> 01:23:01,481
We're not gonna close the door
until you come out and party with us.

1044
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:03,983
Let me think about it.

1045
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:09,197
Count my money.
Party with bitches.

1046
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:12,701
Hundreds and fiifties.
Big-ass titties.

1047
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:20,083
Count the green.
Get in between those titties.

1048
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:21,960
Let's party!

1049
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:25,046
Come on, fool!

1050
01:23:25,171 --> 01:23:28,258
Put that shit in the drawer.

1051
01:23:28,425 --> 01:23:33,263
I'm in the mood to get jiggy with it.
I wanna party.

1052
01:23:33,471 --> 01:23:35,974
Aztec warrior. Aztec warrior.

1053
01:23:45,775 --> 01:23:49,946
He put it in a drawer.
I'm gonna go get it.

1054
01:23:50,196 --> 01:23:53,825
You want me to wait here,
so Cheeco can bite me in my ass?

1055
01:23:54,034 --> 01:23:58,121
- Yeah!
- I'm goin'. I'm not doin' nothin'.

1056
01:23:58,371 --> 01:24:01,833
- What, man?
- I'm gonna tell you once more. Sit.

1057
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:04,711
Get the finger outta my--

1058
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:23,188
Damn.

1059
01:24:23,396 --> 01:24:25,106
Yea, yea.

1060
01:24:26,649 --> 01:24:30,612
You got that Ricky Martin CD?
I love him. He's a musical God.

1061
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:38,036
He's good for my people.
Come on. All right. I wanna dance.

1062
01:24:38,244 --> 01:24:39,913
Damn.

1063
01:24:52,509 --> 01:24:54,844
Calm down.
I got something for you.

1064
01:24:55,011 --> 01:24:57,222
Got a treat.

1065
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:02,018
You're gonna like this.
I got a little bud brownie.

1066
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:05,188
Here.Just eat the whole thing.
Here.Just eat it all up.

1067
01:25:05,397 --> 01:25:08,233
Good boy. Eat it up.

1068
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:14,072
Eat it up. Eat it up.
Good dog. Good dog.

1069
01:25:20,161 --> 01:25:22,497
We're gonna party now.

1070
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:27,836
What the fuck?

1071
01:25:28,044 --> 01:25:32,048
Hey, who locked
the fuckin' door, huh?

1072
01:25:32,173 --> 01:25:35,760
I don't like locked doors around here!
They make me crazy and shit!

1073
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:40,098
I was locked up!
Pass the wire! Pass the wire!

1074
01:25:40,348 --> 01:25:44,185
I don't want no grilled cheese.
No, Leroy, I'm bilingual!

1075
01:25:44,394 --> 01:25:49,274
There's a difference.
No more locked doors!

1076
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:01,036
No more locked doors around here,
you hear me?

1077
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:06,624
What you been eating, girl?
Nothing but light beer for you.

1078
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:12,547
I like it rough.

1079
01:26:12,797 --> 01:26:17,260
Oh, you do, huh? Good,
'cause that's how you're gonna get it.

1080
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:35,111
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

1081
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:41,034
- What are you doing here?
- I hope you don't think I'm crazy.

1082
01:26:41,284 --> 01:26:44,871
I snuck in here to show you that
I wasn't scared ofyour punk brothers.

1083
01:26:45,121 --> 01:26:49,626
And if you had a man
like me in your life...

1084
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:52,796
you wouldn't have to be
scared of them neither.

1085
01:26:52,962 --> 01:26:56,633
What? So you snuck in my room
to tell me that?

1086
01:26:58,134 --> 01:26:59,719
Yeah, I did. Excuse me.

1087
01:27:02,263 --> 01:27:06,059
- Who you talking to?
- Nobody!

1088
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:10,897
- I heard a vato's voice in here.
- No, you didn't. Get out of my room.

1089
01:27:11,147 --> 01:27:14,109
Go back to your
stupid little girlfriends.

1090
01:27:14,275 --> 01:27:15,735
I'm telling Mom.

1091
01:27:15,985 --> 01:27:19,781
Good boy. Feel that?

1092
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:23,660
Good dog. Lay down.

1093
01:27:23,868 --> 01:27:29,332
That's a good boy. Lay down.
Yeah, you're a good boy.

1094
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:34,921
You are a good dog.

1095
01:27:36,297 --> 01:27:39,009
Oh, I'm gonna do you good.

1096
01:27:39,259 --> 01:27:41,511
I'm gonna give it to you rough.

1097
01:27:41,761 --> 01:27:46,725
Here's Johnny.
I call him Mini Me.

1098
01:27:46,933 --> 01:27:51,396
I'm gonna do you like American Me,
baby. Don't look at me.

1099
01:27:51,646 --> 01:27:56,359
Don't look at me, little puppy.
Can I get a whoo, whoo?

1100
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:59,696
I'm an Aztec warrior.

1101
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:09,873
Bring your ass home, Craig.
Come on.

1102
01:28:10,081 --> 01:28:13,668
Hey, I'm cold.
I'll close the window.

1103
01:28:16,087 --> 01:28:17,797
Oh, shit.

1104
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:31,186
Motherfuckers can't fuck with me.
I'm a player. I'm a player!

1105
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,856
Like I was sayin'.

1106
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:39,569
Are you listening?

1107
01:28:44,324 --> 01:28:46,785
We don't need this shit.

1108
01:28:47,035 --> 01:28:50,121
A guy like me
and a dog like you...

1109
01:28:50,372 --> 01:28:52,832
we ought to be in Maui...

1110
01:28:52,999 --> 01:28:57,045
..rentin'Jet Skis to fat fucks
with flower shirts.

1111
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:07,847
That'd be the good life.

1112
01:29:08,098 --> 01:29:14,521
Take you with me wherever I go.
I love you.

1113
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:17,732
- It'll work.
- Come on.

1114
01:29:17,899 --> 01:29:20,318
- Where's Craig?
- He's in the house still.

1115
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,197
- Why'd he go in the house?
- Don't worry about it.

1116
01:29:24,447 --> 01:29:27,200
We gotta figure out a way to get him
out of there. He's probably locked up.

1117
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:31,246
- Come on.
- Shit.

1118
01:29:32,997 --> 01:29:37,961
- You did all this for me?
- Most of it.

1119
01:29:40,046 --> 01:29:42,924
I just hate to see a fine girl like you
in a situation like this.

1120
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:48,096
Thanks for noticing.

1121
01:29:48,263 --> 01:29:51,474
It used to be peaceful around here
before they got out.

1122
01:29:53,184 --> 01:29:57,147
They took over the house and
caused my mother's nervous breakdown.

1123
01:29:57,397 --> 01:30:01,276
Dang. Why she didn't
just kick 'em out?

1124
01:30:01,484 --> 01:30:04,446
We tried.

1125
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:08,324
We saved up to get away from them,
but they just followed us.

1126
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:13,413
Damn. I hate to hear that.
Can I get out this window right here?

1127
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:19,836
- I thought you came up here to see me.
- I did. It's just, you know--

1128
01:30:20,045 --> 01:30:23,048
What's the hurry?

1129
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:25,675
I got my cousin out here
waitin' on me.

1130
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:28,887
So what?

1131
01:30:29,095 --> 01:30:31,348
Let's make him wait.

1132
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,437
Okay, knock.

1133
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:40,899
- You want me to knock?
- Knock!

1134
01:30:43,735 --> 01:30:47,072
You're actin' like a little bitch
right now, man.

1135
01:30:47,197 --> 01:30:49,824
They can't hear that.
The music's playin'.

1136
01:30:49,949 --> 01:30:53,745
Excuse me, partner. That was
a fuckin' ghetto knock I just did.

1137
01:30:53,912 --> 01:30:57,248
- I'll show you how to knock on a door.
- What ya doin'? Stop--

1138
01:30:57,457 --> 01:31:01,086
Yeah. Rub that shit.

1139
01:31:02,462 --> 01:31:04,881
I hear something.

1140
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:09,636
Fuck.

1141
01:31:09,886 --> 01:31:12,597
I can't do anything
around here! Shit!

1142
01:31:14,849 --> 01:31:16,768
Ruining my flow.

1143
01:31:18,311 --> 01:31:20,563
Right there.

1144
01:31:20,772 --> 01:31:22,982
Lover boys, you hear that shit?

1145
01:31:24,025 --> 01:31:26,361
You better stop.

1146
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:29,948
- They gonna think we're the police!
- It gets results.

1147
01:31:31,658 --> 01:31:33,076
What do you want?

1148
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:36,371
We came to borrow some sugar.

1149
01:31:38,206 --> 01:31:40,959
Does this look like
a fuckin' 7-Eleven to you?

1150
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:43,586
Do you see that red dot
on my forehead?

1151
01:31:43,795 --> 01:31:47,173
Do you see an ATM in the corner
that doesn't work?

1152
01:31:47,424 --> 01:31:50,760
Do you? No, you don't,
so fuck you, my friend.

1153
01:31:51,011 --> 01:31:53,221
Get the fuck outta here.

1154
01:31:53,388 --> 01:31:54,931
You too, Slim Shady.

1155
01:31:55,098 --> 01:31:59,686
- No problem. We gone.
- Hold on a second.

1156
01:31:59,936 --> 01:32:05,734
Hey, man, you ran over my skateboard.
I don't appreciate that, all right?

1157
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:09,696
That's bullshit, man. It ain't--

1158
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,261
Got your message.
Where's Craig?

1159
01:32:34,387 --> 01:32:37,223
Message? I ain't sent you
no damn message!

1160
01:32:37,349 --> 01:32:39,601
You didn't call the sandwich joint
with an urgent message?

1161
01:32:39,809 --> 01:32:44,522
Hell, no, Willie!
You startin' to think like a dog.

1162
01:32:44,773 --> 01:32:47,650
Believe them fleas and ticks
suckin' on your old-ass brain.

1163
01:32:47,859 --> 01:32:50,111
Somebody sent me a message.
Where's Craig and Day-Day?

1164
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,031
I don't know.

1165
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:55,533
Come on in.

1166
01:32:58,244 --> 01:33:02,374
You know you got shit
all over the back of your ass?

1167
01:33:02,582 --> 01:33:06,836
Don't sit on that couch!
Put some paper down.

1168
01:33:07,045 --> 01:33:09,297
Next time page me first.

1169
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:12,759
Okay, I'll do that.
What's my code, 69?

1170
01:33:12,926 --> 01:33:16,763
- No, 68.
- Yeah, right.

1171
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:18,098
Shit.

1172
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:24,020
You okay?

1173
01:33:31,194 --> 01:33:34,948
This is some bullshit. We just
came over here to borrow some sugar.

1174
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:38,910
- And some Phillies.
- And some Phillies and--

1175
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:42,747
We ain't come to fuck up
y'all little ménage à trois.

1176
01:33:42,997 --> 01:33:48,086
These are some bad bitches y'all got
over here and we would not fuck that up.

1177
01:33:48,294 --> 01:33:51,423
- How y'all doin' anyway?
- Fine.

1178
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:52,674
Hey!

1179
01:33:52,924 --> 01:33:55,510
My name is Day-Day.
I'm your local neighbourhood player.

1180
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,221
This is my little buddy Roach.
Roach, say, "What's happenin'?" to them.

1181
01:33:58,471 --> 01:34:01,224
- Nice to meet you ladies.
- Hey, hey!

1182
01:34:01,349 --> 01:34:02,934
What the fuck?

1183
01:34:04,811 --> 01:34:07,605
This isn't The Love Connection.

1184
01:34:07,772 --> 01:34:11,943
Trying to pick up on our hynas or what,
eh? Want to go to the room right now?

1185
01:34:13,695 --> 01:34:17,574
I don't know about you two.
I don't know about this sugar shit.

1186
01:34:17,782 --> 01:34:20,285
I know black people got a lot
of sugar in their house.

1187
01:34:21,411 --> 01:34:23,997
So I don't know.
You makin' me susp--

1188
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:30,462
- Suspicious, eh?
- It's makin' me think a lot! Smart guy.

1189
01:34:34,299 --> 01:34:37,761
He's tryin' to make it
with our chicks.

1190
01:34:42,098 --> 01:34:44,351
- What'd he say?
- I don't know.

1191
01:34:44,559 --> 01:34:47,062
Karla's coming down.
Give me the weapon.

1192
01:34:48,646 --> 01:34:52,776
- Shut the fuck up and act natural.
- No problem.

1193
01:34:57,322 --> 01:35:00,658
- Hey. What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

1194
01:35:04,245 --> 01:35:06,998
Are you going to give me
a ride to see Mommy?

1195
01:35:07,207 --> 01:35:11,461
Dang! You bug! Look,
just take my car, all right?

1196
01:35:11,711 --> 01:35:14,881
- Take your car?
- Did I stutter?

1197
01:35:15,048 --> 01:35:18,843
- Did I stutter?
- Hell, no. You ain't--

1198
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:21,971
Shut up, stupid.
Just give me your car keys.

1199
01:35:22,138 --> 01:35:24,849
- I'm not stupid. You're stupid.
- You're stupid.

1200
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:27,435
- Don't call me stupid. I'm sensitive.
- Where's the car keys?

1201
01:35:27,644 --> 01:35:30,647
- You're stupid!
- I'll be back in a bit. Bye.

1202
01:35:30,897 --> 01:35:32,857
- Chickenhead.
- Stupid ass.

1203
01:35:33,024 --> 01:35:35,485
Don't be hittin' my switches too.

1204
01:35:35,735 --> 01:35:38,613
And tell Mama we miss her cooking.

1205
01:35:40,573 --> 01:35:45,286
You know what? lf everything's cool,
then we'll let you bounce too.

1206
01:35:45,495 --> 01:35:49,582
That's a deal.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1207
01:36:03,638 --> 01:36:06,975
- Where the hell you been?
- I was over--

1208
01:36:07,183 --> 01:36:09,894
This is my boy.
I'm the only one who can yell at him.

1209
01:36:10,061 --> 01:36:13,648
- Where the hell you been?
- Have y'all seen Day-Day?

1210
01:36:13,898 --> 01:36:17,736
Thought he was with you.

1211
01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:22,532
I knew we'd never be together forever.
You're a cold little Puerto Rican dude.

1212
01:36:30,874 --> 01:36:33,835
- What?
- We're saying you're fucked!

1213
01:36:34,085 --> 01:36:36,546
- You're staying with us.
- Oh, man.

1214
01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:40,258
Baby Joker, get the duct tape.

1215
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:44,471
It's on my bed.
I was using it earlier.

1216
01:36:44,721 --> 01:36:49,559
- Shit, man!
- And, you, put your clothes back on.

1217
01:36:54,898 --> 01:36:58,360
Come on. The party's over.
Get your chickie heads outta here!

1218
01:36:58,568 --> 01:37:03,656
Come on! Move it, hood-rat. Get your ass
outta here. Bus leaves at 11:00!

1219
01:37:03,823 --> 01:37:06,534
Take this shit with you!

1220
01:37:06,785 --> 01:37:08,286
Call me!

1221
01:37:09,496 --> 01:37:12,832
- What a jerk.
- He's stupid.

1222
01:37:12,999 --> 01:37:15,293
- What did we do?
- Why does he need tape?

1223
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:19,923
- Tell us what we did.
- You're fucked. Gonna have a party.

1224
01:37:20,131 --> 01:37:23,885
- What kind of party?
- A prison party. Wejust got out.

1225
01:37:24,094 --> 01:37:27,597
I know what to do with you.

1226
01:37:27,847 --> 01:37:29,808
- Shit!
- He's cute, huh?

1227
01:37:29,974 --> 01:37:32,310
- I want the little one.
- He's like a Frosted Mini-Wheat.

1228
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,646
Hold on, baby.

1229
01:37:34,813 --> 01:37:38,358
- It's gonna be crazy.
- Don't do that.

1230
01:37:38,608 --> 01:37:40,735
You haven't seen my Aztec warrior.

1231
01:37:40,944 --> 01:37:44,698
- I can't handle this!
- You can't handle them?

1232
01:37:44,906 --> 01:37:49,035
- You can handle them.
- You got a pretty mouth.

1233
01:37:49,285 --> 01:37:50,870
Don't do that!

1234
01:37:51,121 --> 01:37:53,123
Don't do it.

1235
01:37:53,373 --> 01:37:55,583
- You think they in there?
- They in there.

1236
01:37:55,834 --> 01:37:57,836
We got to do something.

1237
01:37:58,086 --> 01:38:00,672
Y'all take your asses over there
if you want to.

1238
01:38:00,922 --> 01:38:06,761
If you ain't back in ten minutes, I'm
callin' the police and insurance man.

1239
01:38:06,886 --> 01:38:10,849
Wait a minute.
I'm goin' to get my shit.

1240
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:16,521
How many of us have them

1241
01:38:16,771 --> 01:38:19,649
Friends

1242
01:38:19,899 --> 01:38:22,318
Ones we can depend on

1243
01:38:22,485 --> 01:38:24,821
Friends

1244
01:38:24,988 --> 01:38:28,158
Shut the fuck up!

1245
01:38:30,869 --> 01:38:33,788
I don't even like Whodini.

1246
01:38:33,997 --> 01:38:38,835
We can be friends as soon as
you tell me where my money is.

1247
01:38:39,085 --> 01:38:43,673
Money? We came to borrow sugar
from ya and some rollin' papers.

1248
01:38:43,882 --> 01:38:48,386
We wanted to get high. I was gonna show
this white boy how to make Kool-Aid--

1249
01:38:49,846 --> 01:38:51,806
Shit!

1250
01:38:51,973 --> 01:38:54,809
Just have a heart, Mr.Joker.
Please. It's Friday!

1251
01:38:54,976 --> 01:38:59,397
- I know what fuckin' day it is.
- Oh, shit! Fuck.

1252
01:38:59,606 --> 01:39:03,943
I hear a lot of talking,
but the words don't mean shit.

1253
01:39:08,823 --> 01:39:11,326
Maybe that other chanate took it.
Remember him?

1254
01:39:14,871 --> 01:39:21,086
Hey, Day-Day,
where is your other mayate?

1255
01:39:47,112 --> 01:39:49,948
It's a nice piece of heat
you got there.

1256
01:39:50,198 --> 01:39:53,535
Thankyou. I ain't got but
two bullets in the motherfucker.

1257
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:56,538
- But that's better than nothin'.
- Yeah, it is.

1258
01:39:56,746 --> 01:40:00,208
Two bullets? Boy, your ass
ain't changed at all.

1259
01:40:00,458 --> 01:40:03,712
Back in the day,
only thing I had was a stick.

1260
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,424
You missed with your stick. I ain't
gonna miss with these two bullets.

1261
01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:10,510
Hey, y'all. Not now. Come on.

1262
01:40:21,688 --> 01:40:25,358
- Come on. You know what to do.
- Shit!

1263
01:40:30,572 --> 01:40:32,907
That's Versace you steppin' on.

1264
01:40:33,074 --> 01:40:36,036
Versace?
You can't even spell Versace.

1265
01:40:36,286 --> 01:40:42,083
"Fo-satchy." F-O-- satchy.

1266
01:41:02,645 --> 01:41:04,230
Damn.

1267
01:41:04,397 --> 01:41:06,733
You all right?

1268
01:41:08,943 --> 01:41:12,322
- Yeah.
- Will you be quiet, Tarzan?

1269
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:15,450
I don't do this shit every day.

1270
01:41:17,619 --> 01:41:22,832
I'm tellin' you, man.
You can do a lot for this community--

1271
01:41:22,999 --> 01:41:27,170
Shut up!
I'm sick of bullshitting with you two.

1272
01:41:27,337 --> 01:41:28,922
Baby Joker?

1273
01:41:39,099 --> 01:41:41,059
- Little Joker?
- Yeah.

1274
01:41:41,226 --> 01:41:42,811
Tape their mouths shut.

1275
01:41:44,646 --> 01:41:46,981
I don't wanna hear
a grown man scream.

1276
01:42:00,036 --> 01:42:01,996
Shit.

1277
01:42:02,163 --> 01:42:03,873
What, man?

1278
01:42:04,082 --> 01:42:07,085
We must be here. We stopped.

1279
01:42:07,335 --> 01:42:11,923
Good. Let's get the hell outta here.
It stink in here.

1280
01:42:12,173 --> 01:42:16,136
- How do we get out?
- How am I supposed to know?

1281
01:42:16,386 --> 01:42:20,098
You the one with all the muscle.
Why don't you get us outta here?

1282
01:42:20,348 --> 01:42:21,933
Raise your hand, fool.

1283
01:42:23,435 --> 01:42:28,148
Now let me show you
how we gonna do this.

1284
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:07,520
Come on, man! Let me outta here!
Come on, man! I'm your brother!

1285
01:43:09,606 --> 01:43:12,984
Come on! Don't do this
to your own brother, man!

1286
01:43:13,234 --> 01:43:14,736
Get out, fool.

1287
01:43:38,635 --> 01:43:40,136
Damn.

1288
01:43:43,973 --> 01:43:47,560
Hey, young man.

1289
01:43:47,811 --> 01:43:51,481
You got knocked the fuck out.

1290
01:43:51,648 --> 01:43:55,068
No more fun and games.

1291
01:43:55,235 --> 01:43:58,697
My little carnal,
he went to get my chain saw.

1292
01:44:00,907 --> 01:44:03,785
I'm gonna show you what happens
to putos that take my money...

1293
01:44:04,035 --> 01:44:06,621
and don't tell me
what I wanna hear.

1294
01:44:08,998 --> 01:44:11,835
Ever see Scarface, fuckers?

1295
01:44:18,049 --> 01:44:20,385
Go see what's takin' him so long.

1296
01:44:27,934 --> 01:44:29,686
Junior?

1297
01:44:31,813 --> 01:44:33,481
Junior?

1298
01:44:33,648 --> 01:44:35,984
What the fuck, stupid?

1299
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,160
My back!

1300
01:44:46,536 --> 01:44:51,249
- What's the matter?
- I believe I slipped my disk again.

1301
01:44:51,458 --> 01:44:54,586
Goddam!

1302
01:44:54,836 --> 01:44:57,464
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me!

1303
01:44:59,007 --> 01:45:03,011
Ain't nothin' wrong with you.
Get your big ass up.

1304
01:45:03,261 --> 01:45:06,056
I'll tie this boy up myself.

1305
01:45:06,222 --> 01:45:08,933
I should tie your big ass up, too,
and drag you down the street.

1306
01:45:13,772 --> 01:45:17,108
You players are going
on the disabled list...

1307
01:45:18,818 --> 01:45:21,196
as soon as my brothers
get back here.

1308
01:45:27,744 --> 01:45:30,163
They should be back here
any minute now.

1309
01:45:32,749 --> 01:45:35,835
They'll be back soon.

1310
01:45:38,672 --> 01:45:41,424
Fuck! Where are these fuckers?

1311
01:45:41,633 --> 01:45:45,720
I gotta do everything. It's tough
being the brains of the operation.

1312
01:45:46,846 --> 01:45:48,306
Fuck!

1313
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:51,935
Hey! You putos go?

1314
01:45:52,185 --> 01:45:56,523
You gonna make me crazy!
You make me crazy! Come on!

1315
01:45:56,731 --> 01:46:00,360
- Makin' me look like a punk!
- It slipped!

1316
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:05,156
- My disk slipped again in my back.
- What the fuck?

1317
01:46:10,412 --> 01:46:12,872
What the hell are you doing here?

1318
01:46:13,123 --> 01:46:16,459
I lost something.
What it look like, fool?

1319
01:46:16,710 --> 01:46:18,962
It looks like a dead mayate
with a loud shirt.

1320
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:22,924
My mind! That's what I lost.
Ain't this my yard?

1321
01:46:26,636 --> 01:46:28,513
Get up!

1322
01:46:30,598 --> 01:46:34,060
Watch his feet.
Watch his feet, boy.

1323
01:46:36,021 --> 01:46:37,272
Fucker!

1324
01:47:16,061 --> 01:47:17,812
School's in, bitch.

1325
01:47:18,938 --> 01:47:20,398
Motherfucker.

1326
01:47:20,607 --> 01:47:23,026
I got your ass right here.

1327
01:47:24,361 --> 01:47:30,450
I'm gonna kick your ass for gettin' me
into this mess, throwin' my back out.

1328
01:47:31,659 --> 01:47:34,996
Daddy, it ain't my fault!
I'm not bullshittin'.

1329
01:47:35,246 --> 01:47:39,584
I was hangin' with this white boy,
and he got me into all kinds of shi--

1330
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:50,261
Damn!

1331
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:52,013
What's up?

1332
01:47:53,848 --> 01:47:55,350
Help!

1333
01:47:58,561 --> 01:48:00,313
Shit!

1334
01:48:00,522 --> 01:48:02,273
Get up!

1335
01:48:07,195 --> 01:48:11,032
Say hello to my little friend.

1336
01:48:18,498 --> 01:48:23,211
Yeah, that's it! I'm gonna blast
this fool. Give me that gun.

1337
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:28,299
- Here!
- Come on, fool. Remember me, punk?

1338
01:48:29,259 --> 01:48:30,760
Lord, have mercy.

1339
01:48:55,785 --> 01:48:59,164
What you want me to do?
Bad dog!

1340
01:49:00,498 --> 01:49:02,083
- Freeze!
- Hands up!

1341
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:05,337
Two giant Milk Duds.

1342
01:49:06,338 --> 01:49:08,882
Freeze! Sheriff's Department!

1343
01:49:09,049 --> 01:49:10,884
I live across the street!

1344
01:49:11,885 --> 01:49:15,722
Paid cash! They the ones you want!

1345
01:49:15,972 --> 01:49:19,976
- Problem, offiicers?
- Don't move!

1346
01:49:20,185 --> 01:49:23,396
- Make a damn hole!
- Hey, brother, man!

1347
01:49:23,646 --> 01:49:26,483
Y'all can't fuck with the police.

1348
01:49:26,649 --> 01:49:29,736
Y'all can't fuck with the police.

1349
01:49:34,074 --> 01:49:39,120
Rude-ass cops.
You done paid your parking tickets?

1350
01:49:39,287 --> 01:49:41,706
You still got your illegal cable?

1351
01:49:41,873 --> 01:49:44,959
We better get the hell outta here.

1352
01:49:45,168 --> 01:49:49,506
- Come here, Cheeco!
- Get your hands off me!

1353
01:49:49,673 --> 01:49:55,136
- This is like a bad dream.
- Why you cops got to be so violent?

1354
01:49:58,348 --> 01:50:00,558
I love Fridays.

1355
01:50:02,268 --> 01:50:05,772
It ain't over, punk!
Wait 'till I get out!

1356
01:50:09,609 --> 01:50:12,946
- When you get out?
- I'm gonna beat your butt up too.

1357
01:50:15,657 --> 01:50:17,909
- It ain't over!
- Come on, man!

1358
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:22,747
- Good job. Good job.
- Yeah, that's our pump!

1359
01:50:22,956 --> 01:50:24,958
Shut up!

1360
01:50:26,459 --> 01:50:29,087
That's right.

1361
01:50:29,295 --> 01:50:31,548
Look what I got.

1362
01:50:33,299 --> 01:50:35,510
Wait, man. Don't open that here.

1363
01:50:40,724 --> 01:50:43,309
-Jump up and down on that back of his.
- That's next.

1364
01:50:43,518 --> 01:50:45,562
Don't listen to him.

1365
01:50:45,770 --> 01:50:50,734
Cash make the coochie go whoo-whoo.

1366
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:56,322
It's gonna feel real good
to pay my taxes. Thanks, nephew.

1367
01:50:56,573 --> 01:50:58,825
No problem, Unc.

1368
01:51:01,244 --> 01:51:03,747
All done!

1369
01:51:03,997 --> 01:51:06,624
Thanks, Miss Kym.

1370
01:51:06,833 --> 01:51:10,211
- Call me, man.
- All right.

1371
01:51:16,134 --> 01:51:18,845
Ancient Chinese secret.

1372
01:51:19,012 --> 01:51:22,098
I'm Korean, motherfucker.

1373
01:51:22,307 --> 01:51:26,770
Fat-ass little Chinese lady's gonna
take the money and not give me no play?

1374
01:51:28,646 --> 01:51:31,649
Will you get your broke-down ass up?

1375
01:51:31,858 --> 01:51:34,819
There ain't nothin' wrong with you.
Layin' down like a broke-dick dog.

1376
01:51:34,986 --> 01:51:38,698
Get up. Come on.
What's wrong with you?

1377
01:51:41,034 --> 01:51:44,662
Damn! That
George Jefferson shit works!

1378
01:51:44,871 --> 01:51:46,373
Walk me to the door.

1379
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:52,337
Hey. Wait a minute.

1380
01:51:52,545 --> 01:51:55,423
I'm sure gonna miss you.

1381
01:51:55,632 --> 01:51:58,718
Why don't you give
your Auntie Suga some sugar?

1382
01:51:59,886 --> 01:52:01,596
Give me a kiss.

1383
01:52:04,349 --> 01:52:06,434
- Hey!
- Come here.

1384
01:52:11,022 --> 01:52:12,649
Sorry.

1385
01:52:19,572 --> 01:52:22,450
Nephew, you're welcome here any time.

1386
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:28,248
Thanks again.

1387
01:52:28,498 --> 01:52:33,169
She's always hittin' on somebody.
Man, you sure you don't wanna stay?

1388
01:52:33,336 --> 01:52:38,299
You know I got to live ghetto fabulous.
I can't stay here with y'all fools.

1389
01:52:38,508 --> 01:52:42,470
- It's too crazy around here.
- Yeah, it's thugged out.

1390
01:52:42,637 --> 01:52:45,223
But you keep that car.
You make sure you get that fixed.

1391
01:52:45,473 --> 01:52:48,518
- You know that. I got money now.
- Yeah, I see.

1392
01:52:48,685 --> 01:52:51,021
When can I come to see you
and fuckyour neighbourhood up?

1393
01:52:51,187 --> 01:52:53,606
- You can't.
- All right.

1394
01:53:01,322 --> 01:53:06,161
Fuck his shit up.
Go on, girl. Hurry up.

1395
01:53:08,413 --> 01:53:09,748
Get that shit.

1396
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:15,420
Hurry up!

1397
01:53:19,299 --> 01:53:24,721
Oh, well. All is well
that ends well, of course.

1398
01:53:24,971 --> 01:53:28,933
Another Friday gone,
another problem solved.

1399
01:53:30,143 --> 01:53:34,898
It's a trip to know that things
can get wild in the suburbs too.

1400
01:53:35,148 --> 01:53:38,568
Man, I can't wait
to get back home...

1401
01:53:38,735 --> 01:53:42,364
to the peace and
quiet streets of South Central.

1402
01:53:42,572 --> 01:53:43,698
Yeah.
