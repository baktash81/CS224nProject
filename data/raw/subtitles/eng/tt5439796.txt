<i>JIMMY: Now the story goes that
John Denver, he was</i>

2
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,231
playin' at this little ol' place called
the Cellar Door in Washington, D.C...

3
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,735
(GRUNTS) ...around
Christmas time in 1970.

4
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,663
His opening act was
this husband and wife duo,

5
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,408
named Bill Danoff
and Taffy Nivert

6
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,914
and they called
themself Fat City.

7
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,167
(CHUCKLES) That's
kind of a funny name.

8
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:23,251
Yeah, that is kind of a funny name.
Socket, uh, 5/8ths.

9
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,632
(SADIE GRUNTS SOFTLY)

10
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,390
Now, one night, they decide
to go on back to the house

11
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,559
and have a little jam session.

12
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,062
On the way,
they got into an accident

13
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,391
and John Denver,
he broke his thumb.

14
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,943
And when they finally
got back to the house,

15
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,520
and Bill and Taffy played him,

16
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,732
played John Denver this song
they'd been working on,

17
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,238
he flipped for it, man.

18
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,619
And they worked on
that thing till dawn.

19
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,695
Screwdriver.

20
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,031
Flat head or Phillips?
Flat.

21
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,538
So that's why you like the song.

22
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,871
Well, I like the song
because of the song.

23
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,376
I mean, I guess I also like it

24
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,215
'cause it's got
a story behind it.

25
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,298
You know,
Bill Danoff later said that

26
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,220
he ain't never even
been to West Virginia.

27
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,139
Well, I like the song, too,

28
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,514
but I don't really think
it'll work for the pageant.

29
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,890
Pliers.

30
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,391
Regular or needle-nose?

31
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,563
Needle.

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,562
So you comin' to my rehearsal?

33
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,732
Yeah. I'm gonna pick
you up right after work.

34
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,534
Just so you know, I asked Mommy

35
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,032
if she and Moody would
pay for your cell phone.

36
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,910
She said even if they did,
you wouldn't take it.

37
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,241
Sadie bug, she's right.

38
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,248
The only thing

39
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,418
I need a cell phone for
is takin' pictures of you.

40
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,756
Gun show!

41
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,928
Hey, Daddy.
Nope.

42
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,457
JIMMY: All right.

43
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,320
What say, Cal?

44
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,615
Hey, hey, Jimmy. Come on in.
Shut that door, would you?

45
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,163
Yeah.
Have a seat.

46
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,794
Jimmy, I'm just gonna say it.
I got to let you go.

47
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,421
(SCOFFS)

48
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,882
Cal, I... I didn't
even do nothin', man.

49
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,592
I know you didn't do nothin'.

50
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,598
But last week, someone
in H.R. saw you leaving,

51
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,307
walking out to your truck
and they saw you was limpin'.

52
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,938
So?

53
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,237
My leg ain't got nothin' to do
with drivin' that Case out there.

54
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,312
I know that.

55
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,954
I know, but the folks over in the
big office, they feel different.

56
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,609
And they said you didn't
list it on your paperwork

57
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,989
when you was first brought on.

58
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,446
No.
They are callin' it

59
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,280
a "pre-existing condition"

60
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,206
and that it is
a liability issue.

61
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,784
Okay, this big then. What
is that, two to three feet?

62
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:48,043
This big and you let me drive my
truck around the track tonight.

63
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,865
Look, it's a four-wheel drive.
It isn't gonna hurt you.

that was gonna be a big deal?

JIMMY:
(CHUCKLES) Hey, Purple Lady.

72
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,912
My husband, the Major,
when he was still alive,

73
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,206
he loved LSU football.

74
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,955
Whenever they'd show the games
here local, we'd watch.

75
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,745
Of course for me,
it was all about the uniforms.

76
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,547
Their jerseys are the most
striking shade of purple.

77
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,669
Purple.

78
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,548
Yes. Purple and gold.
Royal colors.

79
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,674
Yeah, I got off early,

80
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,676
so I figured I'd take Sadie
on over to her dance thing,

81
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,098
so you didn't have to drive her.

82
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,054
Well, that's great and all,

83
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,886
you wanting to see your
daughter dance and everything.

84
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,642
But it was yesterday.

85
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,306
(SIGHS) Shit.

86
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,770
Excuse you.

87
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,476
I got her there fine,
by the way.

88
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,394
See, most people think

89
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,605
if you're gonna go to
Charleston, then, duh,

90
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,736
you get on the 85 to Danville,

91
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,819
then the I-19
to Charleston. 54 miles.

92
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,699
But, bein' 4:00 p.m.,

93
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,327
I knew not the best time
of day to be on the road.

94
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,867
And they're still doing

95
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,793
all that shoulder
work on the I-19.

96
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,088
Plus, then you got
the sun right in your eyes

97
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,962
for that whole
stretch outside of Julian.

98
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,922
So, yeah,
I took the 85 to Danville,

99
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,629
but then I hopped onto the 3,

100
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,760
so instead of goin' up and over,

101
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,512
I'm goin' over and then up.

102
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,143
And after that it was a straight
shot on the Daniel Boone Parkway

103
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,561
all the way to Marmet.

104
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,856

like you love to drive.

105
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,309
It was just a rehearsal,
not like the real pageant,

106
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,485
but Bobbie Jo is not happy.

107
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,028
Now, why didn't you call me'?

108
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,815
I tried, but your cell phone
seems to have been turned off.

109
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,321
You should pay your bills.
Everyone needs a cell phone.

110

But I don't like 'em.

You one of them Unabomber types?

112
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,537
Yeah. lam one of
them Unabomber types.

113
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,497
See, I don't like people
tellin' me what to do,

114
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,044
like, "Answer the phone."

115
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,050
Hey.
Oh, this is gonna be good.

116
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,686
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, I thought...

117
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,021
(STUTTERS)
I knew it was 4:00,

118
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,849
I just thought
it was 4:00 today.

119
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,401
That's the first time
you've used that excuse!

120
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,483
Look, I said I was sorry,
all right?

121
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,521
Mellie said y'all figured it
out just fine anyway.

122
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,858
She also tell you
that she got pulled over

123
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,568
goin' 30 miles
over the speed limit

124
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,532
with my daughter in the car?

125
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,783
It's our daughter.

126
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,536
Sadie said her Aunt Mellie
"worked her Mellie magic"

127
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,538
and talked the cops
into not givin' her a ticket!

128
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,165
So that's a real good
character-building experience

129
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,417
for our daughter to witness.

130
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,706
Yeah.
Don't laugh at me!

00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,544
Yeah, whatever, forget it. What's
up with the sale sign out there?

loves a fat girl.

it's not your arm.

1188
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:16,145
Your arm you lost over in Iraq.

1189
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,894
That thing in there's
just a piece of plastic.

1190
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:21,601
Your arm can't be replaced
is what I'm trying to...

1191
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:25,029
FISH: Your arm can't be replaced,
but that piece of plastic

1192
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,198
that you use as an arm,
that can be replaced.

1193
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,196
Clyde, Clyde, come on. Clyde!

1194
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:34,455
Now, there's a lot more money
we can get out of there.

1195
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:38,000
We got to finish this.
Come on.

1196
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,000
You're with them?

1197
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:45,208
FISH: Of course he's with us.
The whole thing was his idea.

1198
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,338
SAM: Yeah.

1199
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,260
FISH: Except he probably
don't wanna say that out loud

1200
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,885
'cause he knows you getting your arm
blowed off in Iraq was all his fault.

1201
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,308
SAM: Everybody knows
you never would have gone

1202
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,933
and joined up to fight if your big
brother wasn't the football star.

1203
01:15:58,012 --> 01:15:59,184
Well, that's true.
SAM: Yeah.

1204
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:03,313
He was gonna be hot shit.
He was gonna play for the NFL.

1205
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,612
And nobody around here
ever done anything like that.

1206
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:10,032
You were gonna be just another
white trash coal miner.

1207
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,109
FISH: The Logan Family Curse.

1208
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:15,288
Shut up! You two are idiots.

1209
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:19,037
Hey. We're value
added to this robbery.

1210
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:22,245
And if anyone has a right to be
pulling an attitude here, it's us.

1211
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,375
Yeah.

1212
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:25,047
JIMMY: Oh, the Bang brothers
don't like the job'?

1213
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,322
Hmm?
You got a problem with it?

1214
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:29,843
Yeah. You changed the date,
moved everything around.

1215
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,263
This whole job
changed dramastically.

1216
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:33,931
We had to change the date!

1217
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,223
SAM: You knew the terms

1218
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:36,425
for our participating.
Mmm-hmm.

1219
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:39,729
We needed a moral reason
to pull this job with you.

1220
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:42,432
Now, we was fine with you wanting
to get back at that store

1221
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,483
for messing
with your hot sister.

1222
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:48,654
But you did a whole 360 on everything
when you moved up the date!

1223
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,572
And NASCAR
ain't done nothing to nobody.

1224
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,238
NASCAR is a beautiful thing.
NASCAR's like America.

1225
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:55,786
It's like you're
making us hurt America.

1226
01:16:55,861 --> 01:17:00,458
So moving up that date was a vagrant
fliolation of our morality clause.

1227
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,376
I'll show you "vagrant"...
(ALL SHOUTING)

1228

It's all good, it's all good.

1229
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,877
Shut the... (MUTTERING)

1230
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,419
We need to finish this.

1231
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:15,052
Now, you go talk to
your brother, all right?

1232
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:22,229
Hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, man.

1233
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,145
Hey, I'm your brother.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1234
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,897
All right?

1235
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:28,861
I'm always with you.

1236
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,817
I'll buy you 20 new arms.

1237
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,399
A hundred,
as soon as we're done.

1238
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,076
But we got to get you back
before anybody notices.

1239
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,783
All right?
So let's finish this.

1240
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:40,738
Okay?

1241
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:44,001
They'll find it and the guards will
be banging on my cell by breakfast.

1242
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,329
No, they ain't.
'Cause I'm gonna get it.

1243
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:49,586
I'm gonna get it,
I promise you. I swear.

1244

1247
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,185

1249

01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:51,276
I got nothing.

1257
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:53,150
Let's try B level.
All right.

1258
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:26,683
Hold up! Stop!
Where are you going?

1259
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:29,439
Garbage run.

1260
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:32,018
You two smell any
smoke from down there?

1261
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:36,189
Uh, no, 'cause we both...

1262
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:39,151
We both lost our sense
of smells when we was little.

1263
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,280
'Cause of the, uh...

1264
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:41,781
The scarlet fever.
Yeah.

1265
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,989
Both of us could be on fire
and not even know it.

1266
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,450
Get that thing out of here.
Okay, thank you very much.

1267
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:50,540
(HORN HONKS)
Okay. All right.

1268
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:57,084
Something ain't right.

1269
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:29,749
Whoa, whoa.

1270
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:31,834
What's that?

1271
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,347
JIMMY: Hey! Your brothers
should be back by now!

1272
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,145
Why don't you go check on 'em?

1273
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,280
OFFICER: You know there's
no smoking on CMS property.

1274
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,233
Oh, that's right.

1275
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:05,490
That's probably why they
put an ashtray in here.

1276
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:12,368
OFFICER 2: You still gotta put
that out and get back to work.

1277
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:14,749
Man, it's a three-quarter-mile
walk to get outside.

1278
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:18,128
OFFICER 2: I said
break time's over, Smokey.

1279
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:24,221
You know, they call
'em 20 for a reason.

1280
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:27,300
And I got four minutes
to go on my 20.

1281
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:29,893
Are you pushing "Open"?

1282
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,470
It doesn't say "Open", okay?

1283
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,597
It says "Start,"
but it won't open.

1284
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,897
Well, stop it.

1285
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,350
What?
Stop it!

1286
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:40,442
I thought we wanted it to start.

1287
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:43,149
We do, but it needs to stop.

1288
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,779
So not start?

1289
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:49,614
We need it to start, but we have
to stop it so I can figure out

1290
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:51,869
why it won't open.

1291
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:06,175
Oh, shit.

1292
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,680
Hey, hey, hey.

1293
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,308

1294
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:15,685
Smoke? No.

1295
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,859
All I smell is
them racing fumes.

1296
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,192
All right, thanks. Go ahead.

1297
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,697

doesn't go all Logan

1352
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,208
Do not tell me you've been
spraying her hair with this!

1353
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:29,419
This will turn her
hair into an SOS pad.

1354
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,338
I was doing the best I could!
You were late!

1355
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,667
Oh, like you never brushed your
own daughter's hair before.

1356
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,424
I wish you all wouldn't fight.
You're making me more nervous.

1357
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:39,137
You're right, baby doll.

1358
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,298
Is Daddy here?

1359
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:45,344
I didn't see him.
I was rushing.

1360
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:47,346
Did your daddy
say he was coming?

1361
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,352
Yeah. Why?

1362
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,442

I heard he got fired.</i>

1364
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,107
<i>Funny how he
never brought that up.</i>

1365
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,702
MELLIE: <i>You look like</i> a <i>princess.
You're gonna do great.</i>

1366
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:21,595
I thought maybe you'd run off.

1367
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,175
And leave you,
beautiful? Never.

1368
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,977
You know, we got caught on the
other side of that there gate

1369
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,896
when the lockdown happened.

1370
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:32,308

01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,858
MAX: A while back,
I got in a fight at the bar.

MAX: No, with his brother.

have one arm or two?

1486
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:45,038
I can't remember.

1487
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:46,991
GRAYSON: And you won
that fight at the bar?

1488
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:48,292
Hell, yeah, I won it!

1489
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,833
So you saw
the bartender with one arm

1490
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:54,424
and an unknown male companion
in the tunnel during the race?

1491
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,668
And they were?

1492
01:35:57,001 --> 01:36:01,006
Well, they was just walking,
but it was suspicious-like.

1493
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:03,346
GRAYSON: Suspicious how?

1494
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:06,307
They shouldn't have been down there.
That was suspicious.

1495
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:09,227
But you didn't think to mention
this encounter to anyone

1496
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,683
until you saw the news on the
television about the robbery?

1497
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:13,981
The docs had to set
my nose, all right?

1498
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,186
I've been in recovery.

1499
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,780
So all these
injuries are the result

1500
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:19,375
of your latest
fight with the brothers?

1501
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:20,949
MAX: Bartender brother.

1502
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:22,618
He's the one that
punched me in the tunnel.

1503
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:23,741
The one-arm?

1504
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:25,914
Yeah, look, just ask
my driver, Dayton White.

1505
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:27,616
Right? He was with me
when all this went down.

1506
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:28,825
He'll back up my story.

1507
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:32,453
Yes, when you called in
your tip, you mentioned

1508
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:34,539
that he'd be able
to corroborate your story.

1509
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:37,630
We spoke with
Dayton White earlier today.

1510
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,720
He stated he was never in the
tunnel with you during the race.

1511
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:44,682
Never saw two suspicious men.

1512
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:47,059
And has no idea
what you're talking about.

1513
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:12,248
Did you talk to him?

1514
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:13,878
I think you knows better.

1515
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:26,466
MELLIE: I stopped by the
trailer when he wasn't home.

1516
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,636
I think I got
most of your stuff.

1517
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:33,106

an employee

1521
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:14,647
recently fired
from the Speedway,

1522
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:18,773
came with his brother Clyde
to see Joseph Bang here,

1523
01:38:19,102 --> 01:38:20,649
on April 15th.

1524
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:23,152
They returned two days later
for a second visit.

1525
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:27,072
Now, we only have video
of this meeting, no audio,

1526
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,074
so we have no idea
what they discussed.

1527
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:31,914
But the following week,

1528
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,663
Clyde Logan drives through the
window of a Corner Save Mart

1529
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:38,379
and ends up being sentenced
to 90 days here.

1530
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:43,001
You seem to have a lot of information
in your FBI folders there.

1531
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:46,754
And so?

1532
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:49,508
You don't think that's
an incredible coincidence?

1533
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:54,853
No. Not really.

1534
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:59,734
I mean, if you're asking me, am I shocked
that the criminals locked up in here

1535
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:01,982
are friends with other criminals?
No, I'm not.

1536
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:10,737
So Clyde Logan and Joseph Bang
were incarcerated here

1537
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,538
at your prison on May the 28th.

1538
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,536
And you had no problems,

1539
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:18,207
no issues of any kind
at your prison on that day?

1540
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:19,458
Is that right?

1541
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:21,460
No, we didn't have any problems.

1542
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:23,712
Right. 'Cause Monroe
County Fire Department

1543
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,151
said they
dispatched multiple units

1544
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,303
around 8:30 p.m. that night.

1545
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:29,346
There was a small kitchen fire,

1546
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:32,301
but that's not a problem
in the context of this prison.

1547
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,099
I mean, it's
standard operating procedure

1548
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:38,307
for them to
dispatch multiple units

1549
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,482
any time there's
a fire at the prison.

1550
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:45,238
That was no big deal. It was
out within a few minutes.

1551
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,618
You're certain
that these two inmates

1552
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:52,240
couldn't have
broken out of here,

1553
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:55,164
robbed the Speedway and then
broken back into your prison

1554
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:56,707

could have been in

01:51:31,435 --> 01:51:34,655
All right. So I was
thinking putt-putt golf.

1688
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:36,990
They got those new
go-karts down there.

1689
01:51:37,065 --> 01:51:39,443
Sure. As long as
we get gelato after.

1690
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:40,743
Gelato?
Yeah.

1691
01:51:40,819 --> 01:51:42,662
Ain't that like fancy ice cream?

1692
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:44,911
I thought you couldn't do that
'cause of your pageants.

1693
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,537
SADIE: Oh, I'm over
all that stuff.

1694
01:51:46,617 --> 01:51:49,712
I've been really getting into
the culinary arts lately.

Oh, cum-what'?</i>

1696
01:51:51,455 --> 01:51:54,459
Cooking! I've been
watching a lot of Top Chef.

1697
01:51:55,417 --> 01:51:56,509
Really?
Yeah.

1698
01:51:56,585 --> 01:52:00,806
I've been learning a lot. Like how
gelato isn't just fancy ice cream.

1699
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:02,849
It's made at a slower
churn rate than ice cream,

1700
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:04,723
so less air gets mixed in.

1701
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:07,304
That's why it has
such a silky texture.

1702
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:08,810
JIMMY: A churn rate, huh?

1703
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:12,143
Yeah, a churn rate. How fast the
paddle in the machine moves.

1704
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:14,895
Sometimes the paddle
is called a dasher.

1705
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:18,490
Oh, yeah, no,
I know what that is. A dasher.

1706
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:22,490
It's kinda like
Dasher and Dancer and Vixen.

1707
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:24,162
No. Daddy!

1708
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:26,490
I know exactly what that is.
No, it's not that.

1709
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,742
I didn't know that
reindeer made ice cream.

1710
01:52:28,992 --> 01:52:30,665
SADIE: They don't!

1711
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:33,121
You funny.

1712
01:52:33,205 --> 01:52:34,957
JIMMY: You funny.
You funny-looking.

You never told me how you
knew the coast was clear

1715
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:50,018
and we could go get the money.

1716
01:52:51,515 --> 01:52:53,768
Well, you know how
that phone company

1717
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:56,023
that give you about 60 days
to pay that phone bill?

1718
01:52:56,353 --> 01:53:00,199
Yeah. Well, you go one day over
and they shut your phone off.

1719
01:53:00,524 --> 01:53:01,525
So?

(JIMMY CHUCKLES)

1721
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:07,869
I ain't paid the bill out at the
trailer in like six months.

1722
01:53:08,115 --> 01:53:09,287
So?

1723
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:12,877
I figured long as they was tapping
my phone, they'd keep it on.

1724
01:53:13,203 --> 01:53:16,047
About a week ago,
it finally went dead.

1725
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,049
That's pretty good.
Yeah.

1726
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:23,198
You came up with
that on your own?

1727
01:53:23,255 --> 01:53:24,347
Yes, I did.

1728
01:53:24,881 --> 01:53:27,384
Well, that's a lot of thinking for a Logan.

this Logan Curse stuff?

1734
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:59,459
Well, that's Clyde's thing. I never
really gave it that much thought.

1735
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:03,758
What about you? You think we're
destined to repeat the past?

1736
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:07,265
No.

Another Especial for the lady?

GRAYSON: Yeah.
I missed out on the toast.

1740
01:54:21,855 --> 01:54:24,779
You know they say it's bad luck
to toast with an empty glass.

1741
01:54:25,525 --> 01:54:26,868
They do say that.

1742
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:29,412
It's also bad luck
to toast alone, so,

1743
01:54:29,488 --> 01:54:31,206
why don't you pour
yourself one on me?

1744
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:33,033
So you don't jinx me.

you'd ever been in the bar before.

1746

Are you just passing through?
GRAYSON: Yeah. Passing through.

1747
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:48,136
But I'm hoping to stay a while.

1748
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,973
Well, then...

1749
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:55,226
Here's to staying a while.
