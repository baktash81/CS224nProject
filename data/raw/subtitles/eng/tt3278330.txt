1
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:31,686
Please, my love.

2
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:34,605
Please, my dearest.
Do not be upset.

3
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:36,899
It was a mistake.

4
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:40,862
I didn't know she was
in this condition. My love, please.

5
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:03,800
Please, my love...

6
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:25,489
Forgive me, my love.

7
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:33,205
I will make you happy.

8
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:21,587
Who are you?

9
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:28,677
I would not bother you

10
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:32,431
if I were not certain
that Your Majesties

11
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,144
will attach great importance
to what I'm about to say.

12
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:40,897
I've heard the promises
of many charlatans before.

13
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:44,025
And you have put many
in the stocks.

14
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:48,155
Fortunately,
that does not concern me.

15
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:51,074
You seem very sure of yourself.

16
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:54,328
What will it cost?

17
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:58,957
An act of courage and of sacrifice.

18
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,042
What d'you mean by that?

19
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:05,005
Birth is always stained by death.

20
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:09,176
And death, in turn,
is simply one element of birth

21
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,555
and not even the most dramatic one.

22
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:17,100
Be less mysterious.
Come to the point.

23
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:21,062
You want a child?

24
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:27,528
Every new life
calls for a life to be lost.

25
00:07:27,903 --> 00:07:32,073
The equilibrium of the world
must be maintained.

26
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,576
Do you understand?

27
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,290
I am prepared to die in order
to feel life grow inside me.

28
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,960
We are speaking of possibility,
not certainty.

29
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:47,589
Are you willing to accept the risk?

30
00:07:47,798 --> 00:07:49,675
What must we do?

31
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:56,890
Hunt down a sea monster.

32
00:07:57,308 --> 00:08:01,478
Cut out its heart
and have it cooked by a virgin.

33
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:04,606
But she must be alone.

34
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:10,571
When Your Majesty eats the heart

35
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:16,618
you will become pregnant
instantly.

36
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,888
Which is the girl?

37
00:13:35,353 --> 00:13:37,230
You, come here.

38
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:44,320
You are still a virgin, right?

39
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:47,240
Come with me,
the queen needs you.

40
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:49,951
Hurry UP!

41
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:54,867
It's coming, Your Majesty.
It's coming.

42
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,253
What's happening?
What's happening?

43
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:29,915
SIXTEEN YEARS LATER

44
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:35,504
Elias!

45
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:45,723
Elias!

46
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:48,642
Where are you, my DOV?

47
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:00,529
Stop!

48
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:04,283
Elias!

49
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:40,272
<i>Your Highness!</i>

50
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,405
<i>Your Highness!</i>

51
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:01,543
<i>Your Highness!</i>

52
00:23:18,852 --> 00:23:20,520
<i>Your Highness!</i>

53
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:33,908
Your Highness!

54
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:38,663
Your Highness!

55
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,005
Why must you continue
to disobey my commands?

56
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:50,133
How many times have I told you?

57
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:54,304
They must stop seeing each other.

58
00:23:55,764 --> 00:24:00,352
The next time that bastard boy
of yours comes anywhere near my son

59
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:02,729
I will throw you both out.

60
00:24:03,688 --> 00:24:05,148
You understand?

61
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:08,277
Don't look at me!

62
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,988
Now go.

63
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:27,879
What does she have to do with this?
What has she done wrong?

64
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:32,050
Take it out on me if you have to,
but leave her out of it.

65
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:34,553
How dare you talk to me like that?

66
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:37,472
You disrespect me
and you disobey me.

67
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:40,183
You know you were not supposed
to see him.

68
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,728
Come here.

69
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,653
Elias, you are a prince.

70
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:55,824
You cannot befriend
of a son of a servant.

71
00:24:57,284 --> 00:24:59,578
But I like being with him.

72
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:02,956
He's like a brother to me,
I will see him whenever I want.

73
00:25:03,164 --> 00:25:04,624
A brother?

74
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:08,795
The only one bond of blood
that you have is with me.

75
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,089
Your mother!

76
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:15,844
And it's to me that you owe
respect and obedience.

77
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:19,180
I am your queen,
don't you ever forget it.

78
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,436
You owe me an apology.

79
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:29,524
I'm sorry, mother.

80
00:25:32,944 --> 00:25:34,404
Come.

81
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,039
My son...

82
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:55,675
If I ever see you with him again,
you will both regret it.

83
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:24,783
Who sings with
such a beautiful voice?

84
00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:31,039
Where have you been hiding
all this time?

85
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:35,626
How is it that I have never met you?

86
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:38,337
Never even seen you?

87
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:42,300
How old are you?

88
00:28:42,926 --> 00:28:44,803
Seventeen?

89
00:28:45,428 --> 00:28:47,305
Eighteen?

90
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:51,893
No, don't go! Don't go!
Don't hide!

91
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:54,395
Stay out in the sunlight.

92
00:28:54,603 --> 00:29:00,151
Please, stay out
to warm your cold king.

93
00:29:01,903 --> 00:29:07,116
Oh I see!
So you want to play hard to get.

94
00:29:07,951 --> 00:29:09,828
Well, so be it.

95
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:13,581
I have fought many wars in my time.

96
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:20,088
And even the most impregnable
fortress surrenders at last.

97
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,161
<i>Who is it?</i>

98
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,872
I have a gift for you,
from your king.

99
00:30:25,528 --> 00:30:27,196
What is it?

100
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:48,884
It's beautiful!

101
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:53,472
- Let me try it, Dora.
- Wait.

102
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:55,141
Wait!

103
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:59,312
- Dora, please...
- Get the mirror.

104
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:14,118
Stop it!

105
00:31:15,994 --> 00:31:18,497
You don't think
we have to give it back?

106
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:21,209
To the king?

107
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,502
No.

108
00:31:24,337 --> 00:31:26,422
What good is it to us?

109
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:30,176
Makes us look more beautiful.
Don't you think?

110
00:31:30,384 --> 00:31:33,929
But whoever sees us?
We're always shut up inside here.

111
00:31:36,432 --> 00:31:39,560
I see you, silly.

112
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,148
There...

113
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:47,485
Okay, I'll keep this.

114
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:06,629
- At the closing of the day, oh Lord.
- Watch over us as we sleep.

115
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:09,965
Keep us safe and warm in Your heart.

116
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,999
Who is it?

117
00:32:46,294 --> 00:32:49,838
<i>It's me... your king.</i>

118
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:54,009
Did you like my present?

119
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:56,929
Have you tried it on?

120
00:32:59,014 --> 00:33:01,934
<i>My royal heart is very generous,
you know?</i>

121
00:33:04,645 --> 00:33:07,398
<i>Ever since this morning
when I first heard you sing,</i>

122
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:10,318
I have been burning
in the furnace of desire. Come on!

123
00:33:10,526 --> 00:33:13,028
Open up this door,
so I can see you.

124
00:33:18,826 --> 00:33:19,952
Hello?

125
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:23,831
Sir, there must be
some misunderstanding...

126
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:30,295
I see...

127
00:33:31,755 --> 00:33:34,257
You are going to tease me,
aren't you?

128
00:33:36,969 --> 00:33:39,472
Let me see you, for heaven's sake!

129
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,396
You like playing with your king?

130
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,315
Play with you, sir?

131
00:33:50,524 --> 00:33:52,610
Oh no!

132
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:57,239
I'm just a poor girl, I don't deserve
the honor you bestow on me.

133
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:03,036
The honor! What honor!
It's desire that drives me.

134
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:06,164
Open up this door, let me in.
Let me see you, for damned sake!

135
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:10,335
- Dora, what shall we do?
- Let me think.

136
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:13,464
We must not let
an opportunity like this get away.

137
00:34:14,507 --> 00:34:17,009
- Your Majesty...
- Yes?

138
00:34:17,217 --> 00:34:20,763
You can't imagine how the modesty
of this young virgin

139
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:23,474
is being put to the test
by your offer.

140
00:34:23,682 --> 00:34:25,142
I...

141
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,312
All my heart's aflutter.

142
00:34:29,522 --> 00:34:31,607
I feel faint.

143
00:34:32,232 --> 00:34:35,360
But all I can promise you today

144
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:37,655
is this:

145
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:41,408
come back in a week's time

146
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:44,327
and I will give you a part of me

147
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:47,665
that alone illustrates my beauty.

148
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,963
Which part of your body
will you grant me?

149
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:03,305
A finger, Your Majesty.

150
00:35:06,642 --> 00:35:08,310
A finger?

151
00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:12,898
A finger...

152
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:21,657
Well... All right, my jasmine flower,
my little honeysuckle.

153
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:24,993
I shall wait

154
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:29,372
and I shall return and admire
the eighth wonder of the world,

155
00:35:29,582 --> 00:35:32,292
your rosy maidenly finger.

156
00:35:37,297 --> 00:35:39,382
What shall we do, Dora?

157
00:35:41,259 --> 00:35:42,928
We'll think of something.

158
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:24,219
This next piece
I composed myself for my father,

159
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:26,554
to whom I dedicate it
with all my heart.

160
00:39:21,188 --> 00:39:24,607
"He grabs the iron bars
pulling and shaking them,

161
00:39:24,816 --> 00:39:28,153
bending the metal and tearing
the bars from the wall."

162
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:31,489
Could you just read the part
where they kiss?

163
00:39:34,617 --> 00:39:37,745
"Then the queen her arms extends,

164
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:40,873
and to her breast his head she bends,

165
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:44,211
and on the bed in warm embrace,

166
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:47,339
the queen displays her radiant face."

167
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:50,883
Now Lancelot has what he desires,

168
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:54,011
the queen's embrace sets him on fire,

169
00:39:54,262 --> 00:39:58,600
so sweet a game to kiss and hold.

170
00:39:58,808 --> 00:40:02,354
Such pleasure this, if truth be told,

171
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:07,150
no one ever felt before,
such joy in loving they adore."

172
00:40:10,278 --> 00:40:11,946
And now we should leave.

173
00:40:13,615 --> 00:40:15,700
Could we read it again?

174
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:33,426
<i>- Your Majesty.
- Yes?</i>

175
00:40:33,635 --> 00:40:36,763
<i>- Some</i> papers <i>to sign.</i>
- Later. Later.

176
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:41,142
<i>I'm sorry, Your Majesty, they are
rather urgent, people want paying.</i>

177
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,436
All is so urgent.

178
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,107
<i>My lord and father,</i>

179
00:41:30,317 --> 00:41:33,027
at my age a girl
should already know

180
00:41:33,235 --> 00:41:35,988
what sort of gallantries
men are capable of.

181
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:40,952
She should be learning to distinguish
whose heart is sincere

182
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,162
and who instead tells lies.

183
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:47,709
If I stay here,
my head will always be empty,

184
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:50,252
and I fear my heart will be too.

185
00:41:50,462 --> 00:41:55,257
Before long you will be
old enough to be married

186
00:41:55,467 --> 00:41:58,553
and then you will depart
these walls forever.

187
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:01,013
Well...

188
00:42:02,056 --> 00:42:05,184
If that is indeed the case,

189
00:42:05,393 --> 00:42:07,479
then find me a husband.

190
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,484
A husband?

191
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:16,153
What sort of husband would you like?

192
00:42:16,863 --> 00:42:20,408
Well...
I'd like my husband to be

193
00:42:20,617 --> 00:42:24,579
courageous and strong and...

194
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:27,289
handsome.

195
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:29,917
I'm sure such a man exists,

196
00:42:30,126 --> 00:42:32,211
but until we find him,

197
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,880
please,

198
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:38,259
do not agitate yourself over a future
none of us can predict.

199
00:42:38,468 --> 00:42:41,387
Now, let us finish our supper.

200
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:52,982
- What is it, my dear?
- It's not cooked enough.

201
00:42:55,652 --> 00:42:57,111
Really?

202
00:43:15,462 --> 00:43:18,382
Yes, yes, yes...

203
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:21,302
Hello?

204
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:26,724
Hello?

205
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:43,735
Elias!

206
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:55,622
Come, my DOY-

207
00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:00,002
Come near me.

208
00:46:01,337 --> 00:46:04,048
I can't make up my mind
about the earrings tonight.

209
00:46:04,256 --> 00:46:07,384
Would you help me?
Which one do you like better.

210
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:13,850
Should we try them on?

211
00:46:24,193 --> 00:46:26,070
Did you take your lesson?

212
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:29,198
Yes, earlier.

213
00:46:45,881 --> 00:46:47,758
MaY I go now?

214
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,261
Of course.

215
00:46:52,138 --> 00:46:53,597
Good night.

216
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,271
Elias...

217
00:47:01,313 --> 00:47:03,399
You won't believe this.

218
00:47:03,607 --> 00:47:04,858
What happened?

219
00:47:05,276 --> 00:47:07,361
I was just in your mother's room.

220
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,158
- What?
- Don't worry. I was in her room.

221
00:47:12,783 --> 00:47:14,660
She thought I was you.

222
00:47:15,494 --> 00:47:17,579
No... impossible...

223
00:47:19,248 --> 00:47:21,750
- You are playing with me.
- She thought I was you.

224
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:25,046
I was in her room... me!

225
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:28,632
- <i>You are not joking?
- She thought I was you, I swear.</i>

226
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,135
<i>She actually called me Elias.</i>

227
00:47:32,594 --> 00:47:34,680
Do you know what this means?

228
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:37,183
What?

229
00:47:37,808 --> 00:47:40,727
If we've managed to fool
even my mother,

230
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:43,480
we can do whatever we want.

231
00:47:45,524 --> 00:47:48,444
- What?
- I'll be eighteen soon.

232
00:47:49,903 --> 00:47:54,075
Then I'll have the throne and
we can take it in turns being king.

233
00:47:54,283 --> 00:47:56,160
- What? Take turns?
- Yes.

234
00:47:56,368 --> 00:47:58,870
<i>Me one day, you the next.
What do you say?</i>

235
00:47:59,288 --> 00:48:01,582
<i>- Me, king?
- Yes.</i>

236
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,875
<i>Imagine how happy my mother will be.</i>

237
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:06,587
<i>You could do whatever you wanted.</i>

238
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:09,298
<i>Maybe I could make her a noblewoman</i>

239
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:11,592
<i>and maybe she could have
a little castle as well.</i>

240
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,346
We're king,
we don't have to listen anybody.

241
00:48:15,554 --> 00:48:17,639
We could give her
everything she desires.

242
00:48:18,056 --> 00:48:20,142
- Everything.
- Just perfect!

243
00:48:21,393 --> 00:48:23,687
But we have to keep this a secret.

244
00:48:23,895 --> 00:48:24,938
Yes!

245
00:48:25,147 --> 00:48:27,441
Between you and me, nobody can know.

246
00:48:29,735 --> 00:48:32,654
- <i>Who</i> is it?
<i>- It's me, your mother.</i>

247
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,408
One moment!

248
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:37,993
This way.

249
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:39,870
Jonah, my jacket!

250
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,707
Help me.

251
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:46,585
Come in, mother.

252
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,968
What is it?

253
00:48:56,637 --> 00:49:00,807
Nothing...
I just wanted to see you.

254
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:13,737
You have my hands.

255
00:49:14,363 --> 00:49:17,908
Even though you were inside me
only one night,

256
00:49:18,116 --> 00:49:20,661
you still managed to take on my form.

257
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:27,125
You have no idea
how much I wanted you.

258
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:32,298
How much I sacrificed for you.

259
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:35,551
You told me many times before.

260
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:43,975
No one will ever love you like I do.

261
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,043
See you tomorrow?

262
00:50:10,669 --> 00:50:11,920
YES.

263
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,069
Your Highness, please.

264
00:52:56,752 --> 00:52:58,419
Your Highness!

265
00:53:01,256 --> 00:53:03,759
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

266
00:53:04,592 --> 00:53:06,052
Jonah!

267
00:53:06,887 --> 00:53:08,764
What are you doing?

268
00:53:11,682 --> 00:53:14,394
Jonah! Why are you leaving?

269
00:53:14,602 --> 00:53:16,271
I have to go.

270
00:53:17,105 --> 00:53:18,314
Why? What's happened?

271
00:53:18,523 --> 00:53:21,067
I have to, don't ask me
anything more.

272
00:53:21,276 --> 00:53:23,361
You can't just leave like this.

273
00:53:23,569 --> 00:53:25,655
I've made up my mind,
I have no choice.

274
00:53:25,864 --> 00:53:27,949
Please, be well and don't forget me.

275
00:53:28,992 --> 00:53:30,243
No!

276
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:33,789
I'm your king and
I order you to stay.

277
00:53:38,168 --> 00:53:41,087
Come... Look.

278
00:54:03,401 --> 00:54:06,737
You come to this spring every day

279
00:54:07,363 --> 00:54:09,866
and here you will see
the flow of my life.

280
00:54:10,491 --> 00:54:12,785
If the water runs clear,

281
00:54:12,994 --> 00:54:15,705
you will know that my life too
is clear and serene.

282
00:54:15,914 --> 00:54:19,876
If it runs muddy,
you will know that I am in trouble.

283
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:26,132
If it dries up, you will know
that I have too reached my end.

284
00:55:23,273 --> 00:55:25,984
You! Stop that!

285
00:55:28,694 --> 00:55:30,571
Get away from here!

286
00:55:31,406 --> 00:55:32,865
Go!

287
00:57:17,762 --> 00:57:19,639
Dora...

288
00:57:21,724 --> 00:57:23,393
Dora...

289
00:57:33,193 --> 00:57:35,696
<i>Here I am, my little darling.</i>

290
00:57:38,408 --> 00:57:41,744
<i>Having counted the days
and numbered the nights,</i>

291
00:57:41,952 --> 00:57:44,038
<i>at long last,</i>

292
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:46,916
your king is here.

293
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:49,419
Now...

294
00:57:50,461 --> 00:57:54,840
my precious one,
show me what you promised.

295
00:58:03,015 --> 00:58:04,850
Dora! Dora!

296
00:58:16,987 --> 00:58:18,656
Beautiful!

297
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:20,950
So soft and tender.

298
00:58:23,035 --> 00:58:24,912
Sweet smelling.

299
00:58:33,879 --> 00:58:36,382
Now, my dearest heart,

300
00:58:36,591 --> 00:58:39,719
now that you have shown me
your beautiful finger,

301
00:58:40,135 --> 00:58:43,889
show me the rest,
show me your face,

302
00:58:44,098 --> 00:58:48,394
show me your mouth, your neck,
so I can kiss it. Please!

303
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:59,530
Now courtesy demands that I ask

304
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:03,200
for something that
I could freely take,

305
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,285
without any pretext.

306
00:59:05,495 --> 00:59:07,580
I'm your king, don't forget!

307
00:59:09,331 --> 00:59:11,000
Your Majesty...

308
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:13,085
my royal lord,

309
00:59:13,919 --> 00:59:16,631
since you have deigned

310
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,384
to demean yourself,
leaving your lofty chambers

311
00:59:20,593 --> 00:59:23,303
to come to this lowly pigsty,

312
00:59:23,513 --> 00:59:28,518
far be it from me to dispute
the will of such a great king.

313
00:59:28,934 --> 00:59:31,436
Therefore...

314
00:59:31,646 --> 00:59:33,731
I am ready

315
00:59:33,939 --> 00:59:36,441
and willing to grant your desires.

316
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:42,490
I only ask of you this one favor.

317
00:59:42,698 --> 00:59:44,366
Of course.

318
00:59:44,575 --> 00:59:47,703
<i>I be welcomed into your bed</i>

319
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:50,623
<i>in the darkness of the night,</i>

320
00:59:50,831 --> 00:59:52,917
<i>without any candles,</i>

321
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:56,253
<i>for my heart could not withstand</i>

322
00:59:56,461 --> 00:59:58,964
<i>you seeing me naked.</i>

323
01:00:00,007 --> 01:00:02,718
Of course, my beautiful angel.

324
01:00:02,927 --> 01:00:04,595
Anything you like.

325
01:00:36,919 --> 01:00:38,588
Do it!

326
01:00:41,298 --> 01:00:42,967
More.

327
01:00:45,678 --> 01:00:48,597
Let me see. Let me see.

328
01:00:48,806 --> 01:00:50,683
Okay. Hold it.

329
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:52,768
Hold it.

330
01:00:57,982 --> 01:01:00,693
Good".good".

331
01:01:02,987 --> 01:01:04,655
And the other one.

332
01:01:06,323 --> 01:01:08,408
Shut up, Imma!

333
01:02:25,194 --> 01:02:28,322
Keep us safe and warm
in your heart.

334
01:02:28,906 --> 01:02:32,451
Always and forever and ever,
keep us warm...

335
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:35,579
And safe from everything.

336
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:54,408
Guards!

337
01:03:54,824 --> 01:03:56,493
Guards!

338
01:04:02,124 --> 01:04:04,209
You summoned me, Your Majesty.

339
01:04:04,418 --> 01:04:06,670
Silence!
You tricked me, you witch!

340
01:04:09,089 --> 01:04:10,965
Throw her out.

341
01:04:11,175 --> 01:04:12,634
No!

342
01:04:12,842 --> 01:04:15,637
Throw her out. Now! Do it!

343
01:04:17,347 --> 01:04:19,849
You wanted me to come!

344
01:05:12,819 --> 01:05:15,113
What are you doing up there?

345
01:05:19,284 --> 01:05:21,370
There is nothing to laugh at.

346
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:25,749
I'm not funny!

347
01:05:28,543 --> 01:05:31,296
- Help me down!
- Yes, I'll help you down.

348
01:05:39,513 --> 01:05:42,015
You shouldn't be up in a tree
at your age.

349
01:05:42,224 --> 01:05:44,100
Help me down.

350
01:05:49,731 --> 01:05:52,234
Oh dear, oh dear...

351
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,405
All this complaining.

352
01:06:01,618 --> 01:06:03,495
Now, now...

353
01:06:20,595 --> 01:06:22,472
Come on now.

354
01:06:26,643 --> 01:06:29,145
There we go.

355
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:34,359
Come on... Come on...

356
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:38,947
There...

357
01:06:41,032 --> 01:06:43,117
This too will pass.

358
01:06:43,535 --> 01:06:45,620
Everything passes.

359
01:09:18,064 --> 01:09:20,566
Doctor! Doctor!

360
01:09:20,775 --> 01:09:23,277
Come quick, the king
needs you right away.

361
01:09:23,486 --> 01:09:25,571
I'm coming. I'm coming.

362
01:09:27,866 --> 01:09:29,951
Your Majesty, the doctor!

363
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,127
It's a respiratory problem.

364
01:09:39,335 --> 01:09:41,420
What are your symptoms?

365
01:09:41,629 --> 01:09:43,715
Not me! Not me!

366
01:09:48,302 --> 01:09:50,388
- Come.
- What's this?

367
01:09:50,596 --> 01:09:52,181
Come!

368
01:09:52,891 --> 01:09:55,810
Come... Please...

369
01:09:56,019 --> 01:09:59,355
- Come!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

370
01:10:01,024 --> 01:10:03,109
Please... Please...

371
01:10:07,696 --> 01:10:11,868
- What is this?
- I don't know what beast this is!

372
01:10:15,204 --> 01:10:17,706
Oh dear! That's not good.

373
01:10:20,835 --> 01:10:22,503
Do something!

374
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,674
Your Highness...

375
01:10:27,508 --> 01:10:29,593
Oh, dear...

376
01:10:40,229 --> 01:10:41,898
Your Highness...

377
01:10:43,149 --> 01:10:44,818
Unfortunately...

378
01:10:57,914 --> 01:10:58,957
Doctor...

379
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,628
You must tell no one
of what you have seen this evening.

380
01:11:05,254 --> 01:11:07,756
- Your Majesty...
- No one!

381
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:45,086
This is my favorite color.

382
01:11:46,129 --> 01:11:49,673
- I love this.
- Neckline is very attractive.

383
01:11:55,096 --> 01:11:57,806
So have you found
something to please you?

384
01:11:58,016 --> 01:12:01,144
Yes. They are all so beautiful.

385
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,646
Why did you send for them?

386
01:12:04,063 --> 01:12:07,191
You want to look beautiful
on your wedding day, don't you?

387
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:11,779
So, I'm to be married?

388
01:12:11,988 --> 01:12:13,656
Of course.

389
01:12:13,864 --> 01:12:17,826
You were right, Violet.
It's time I found you a husband.

390
01:12:18,036 --> 01:12:21,580
I understand you are bored
living here with us at the castle

391
01:12:21,789 --> 01:12:25,543
and in this way you can venture forth
and discover new places.

392
01:12:25,751 --> 01:12:29,505
- It's what you wanted.
- Yes!

393
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:32,841
Then, who will my husband be, father?

394
01:12:33,051 --> 01:12:34,718
Well...

395
01:12:35,136 --> 01:12:38,681
He will be braver than
the most valiant knight

396
01:12:38,889 --> 01:12:42,017
and wiser even than
our own court doctor.

397
01:12:42,851 --> 01:12:44,312
Thank you.

398
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,566
- What is his name?
- Not even I know his name yet.

399
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:53,904
How can that be?
Do you not know him?

400
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:57,450
Surely, as an avid reader
you know that

401
01:12:57,658 --> 01:13:00,994
the husband of a princess can only
be discovered through a tournament.

402
01:13:01,829 --> 01:13:03,914
So I won't choose him myself.

403
01:13:04,123 --> 01:13:06,250
What if I don't love him?

404
01:13:08,085 --> 01:13:12,256
You will love him, Violet.
You will.

405
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:18,095
Of course, it is possible that
no suitor will pass the test.

406
01:13:21,224 --> 01:13:23,100
Then what will I do?

407
01:13:23,309 --> 01:13:26,229
Then fate will have decided

408
01:13:26,437 --> 01:13:29,982
that you must live a while longer
with your old father.

409
01:13:31,234 --> 01:13:32,901
Your turn.

410
01:14:05,643 --> 01:14:07,728
This is the hide of a sow.

411
01:14:09,187 --> 01:14:10,648
No.

412
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,818
Next!

413
01:14:22,117 --> 01:14:25,245
- He is very serious.
- He's old.

414
01:14:41,512 --> 01:14:44,723
Verrus singularis silvano.

415
01:14:49,227 --> 01:14:50,688
No.

416
01:14:54,107 --> 01:14:57,445
Verrus singularis silvano... No!

417
01:14:57,653 --> 01:14:59,322
Next!

418
01:15:18,632 --> 01:15:20,926
- Father...
- A moment!

419
01:15:21,552 --> 01:15:24,888
- What is it?
- Please, I'm longing to know.

420
01:15:25,097 --> 01:15:28,225
Just tell me what piece
that strange hide belongs to.

421
01:15:28,434 --> 01:15:30,310
No, it's forbidden.

422
01:15:31,144 --> 01:15:34,064
- I won't tell a soul.
- It's impossible.

423
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:36,984
I'm your daughter!

424
01:15:40,112 --> 01:15:43,866
Oh very well, I can deny you nothing.

425
01:15:45,743 --> 01:15:48,871
You wish to know to which beast
this hide belongs?

426
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:50,330
YES.

427
01:15:51,999 --> 01:15:55,127
It is the skin of a flea.

428
01:16:04,512 --> 01:16:05,971
Continue.

429
01:16:12,478 --> 01:16:14,146
Giant manatee.

430
01:16:18,066 --> 01:16:19,943
Sorry.

431
01:16:20,152 --> 01:16:21,612
No.

432
01:16:23,739 --> 01:16:25,407
Next!

433
01:16:38,712 --> 01:16:40,172
No, no...

434
01:16:40,589 --> 01:16:43,717
Everyone has the right to guess.

435
01:16:43,926 --> 01:16:46,011
- Father...
- It's fine.

436
01:17:06,448 --> 01:17:07,908
Flea.

437
01:17:12,746 --> 01:17:13,997
What?

438
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,001
Flea!

439
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:36,478
Violet!

440
01:17:47,948 --> 01:17:49,407
No!

441
01:17:49,616 --> 01:17:51,076
Violet!

442
01:17:51,284 --> 01:17:52,953
No! Wait!

443
01:17:53,578 --> 01:17:55,372
Please, StOP!

444
01:17:58,375 --> 01:18:01,211
I never imagined anyone would guess.

445
01:18:02,337 --> 01:18:04,006
I'm sorry.

446
01:18:04,214 --> 01:18:05,883
I understand.

447
01:18:06,508 --> 01:18:10,888
It was never my intention that
I would give you to such a monster.

448
01:18:12,347 --> 01:18:15,683
But what can I do?
You heard the proclamation.

449
01:18:15,893 --> 01:18:19,229
I can't go back on my word.
Violet!

450
01:18:19,646 --> 01:18:23,191
Patience, my blessed child.

451
01:18:23,817 --> 01:18:26,737
Perhaps... Perhaps... Violet...

452
01:18:28,405 --> 01:18:32,785
Perhaps the will of God
is behind this unusual fate.

453
01:18:34,244 --> 01:18:37,372
I know you are scared but...

454
01:18:37,998 --> 01:18:42,377
My heart tells me that
you will find a strength to be happy.

455
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,088
Happy?

456
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:50,510
You tried to deceive me
with your words, father!

457
01:18:50,718 --> 01:18:54,264
Your heart tells you?
You have no heart!

458
01:18:54,472 --> 01:18:58,435
Silence! You forget the duties
and obligations of a king.

459
01:19:01,146 --> 01:19:03,231
You're not a king.

460
01:19:04,066 --> 01:19:06,151
You're not even a man.

461
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:08,445
Not even a beast.

462
01:19:08,653 --> 01:19:11,781
Beasts at least love their offspring.

463
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:14,076
They try to protect them.

464
01:19:14,284 --> 01:19:17,620
But not you. I'm nothing to you.

465
01:19:19,915 --> 01:19:22,625
I wish that my mother
had strangled me in my crib

466
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:24,669
instead of leaving me in your hands.

467
01:19:24,878 --> 01:19:26,546
Silence!

468
01:19:26,754 --> 01:19:29,257
Whatever I do is done well.

469
01:19:30,758 --> 01:19:35,555
No one has the right to question
my will, least of all my daughter!

470
01:19:58,078 --> 01:20:02,665
Fear not,
your obligations shall be respected.

471
01:20:02,874 --> 01:20:07,045
No one will be able to say that
the king did not keep to his word.

472
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:03,471
Sit.

473
01:24:52,955 --> 01:24:55,875
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,
I've looked everywhere.

474
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:57,752
I can't find him.

475
01:25:01,088 --> 01:25:03,382
What d'you mean, you can't find him?

476
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:12,559
<i>Your Highness!</i>

477
01:25:20,066 --> 01:25:21,943
Elias!

478
01:25:24,654 --> 01:25:26,322
<i>Your Highness!</i>

479
01:26:05,111 --> 01:26:06,570
It's him!

480
01:26:08,614 --> 01:26:11,993
He's back! Fenizia!

481
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:14,370
He's back, Jonah is alive!

482
01:26:21,585 --> 01:26:24,714
Jonah, my love! Jonah!

483
01:26:27,424 --> 01:26:29,719
We knew you would come back to us.

484
01:26:29,927 --> 01:26:32,638
You have no idea how long
we've been looking for you!

485
01:26:55,787 --> 01:26:57,872
How much time has passed?

486
01:26:59,748 --> 01:27:03,294
I'm...
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

487
01:27:03,502 --> 01:27:05,797
Five days.
You've been gone five days.

488
01:27:06,005 --> 01:27:07,882
Where did I go?

489
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:11,635
The forest.

490
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:15,389
The forest...
Why was I in the forest?

491
01:27:26,233 --> 01:27:27,902
Where is he?

492
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:31,864
He is searching for his friend.

493
01:27:32,281 --> 01:27:36,243
You wanted to separate
what is inseparable.

494
01:27:38,537 --> 01:27:40,622
I want my son back.

495
01:27:41,498 --> 01:27:44,626
Now I will repeat what I told you.

496
01:27:45,211 --> 01:27:49,173
Every desire, every action
corresponds to another.

497
01:27:50,007 --> 01:27:52,927
A violent desire such as yours

498
01:27:53,135 --> 01:27:55,804
can only be satisfied with violence.

499
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:59,766
And there will be a cost.

500
01:27:59,976 --> 01:28:02,478
You know I'm willing to pay it.

501
01:28:31,507 --> 01:28:32,967
Jonah!

502
01:28:40,891 --> 01:28:42,643
Jonah, can you hear me?

503
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:17,178
Help!

504
01:29:18,637 --> 01:29:20,722
I'm here, help me!

505
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:28,230
Help!

506
01:29:35,529 --> 01:29:38,031
I'm here! Help me!

507
01:30:36,215 --> 01:30:37,883
<i>Jonah!</i>

508
01:30:38,925 --> 01:30:40,594
Elias!

509
01:30:48,727 --> 01:30:50,186
Help!

510
01:30:51,229 --> 01:30:53,565
- I'm coming!
- Help me!

511
01:30:53,774 --> 01:30:57,319
- Quick! Help me!
- Don't worry, I'm here.

512
01:30:58,945 --> 01:31:00,822
Quick! Oh, my God!

513
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:14,140
An invitation to the king's wedding.

514
01:34:18,937 --> 01:34:20,814
Who sent it to me?

515
01:34:21,231 --> 01:34:23,316
The future queen.

516
01:34:29,781 --> 01:34:31,241
Dora...

517
01:36:13,843 --> 01:36:15,303
Imma!

518
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:20,100
It's me.

519
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:29,275
It's me, Dora.

520
01:36:30,318 --> 01:36:32,403
I've missed you so much!

521
01:36:34,072 --> 01:36:35,531
Imma...

522
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:37,408
It's me.

523
01:36:37,825 --> 01:36:39,285
Dora.

524
01:36:42,413 --> 01:36:44,290
I don't know what happened.

525
01:36:44,499 --> 01:36:46,376
I fell asleep.

526
01:36:47,002 --> 01:36:50,130
When I woke up
I had changed my skin.

527
01:36:50,546 --> 01:36:52,632
What do you mean?

528
01:36:54,509 --> 01:36:58,679
I changed my skin, I don't know...

529
01:37:01,599 --> 01:37:03,684
You're so beautiful.

530
01:37:08,064 --> 01:37:10,150
Young...

531
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:20,368
Dora...

532
01:37:20,576 --> 01:37:23,496
From now on, you don't have
to worry about a thing.

533
01:37:23,704 --> 01:37:25,790
I'll take care of you.

534
01:37:25,998 --> 01:37:29,544
Anything you want,
it will be yours.

535
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:35,175
Dora...

536
01:37:39,137 --> 01:37:41,431
- I have to go now.
- No!

537
01:37:41,639 --> 01:37:44,142
I'll come back,

538
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:46,436
but remember,

539
01:37:46,644 --> 01:37:48,729
this has to be our secret.

540
01:37:48,938 --> 01:37:51,023
Not a word to anyone.

541
01:37:53,943 --> 01:37:56,028
Dora, wait... Wait!

542
01:38:51,917 --> 01:38:54,420
The queen is my sister.

543
01:39:31,332 --> 01:39:33,626
No! No!

544
01:39:34,043 --> 01:39:36,962
I have to stay here with my sister.

545
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:39,256
Yes I'm sure she's our sister,
<i>I</i>

546
01:39:39,465 --> 01:39:41,967
but it's time to go, the party is
over and the guests are leaving.

547
01:39:42,176 --> 01:39:45,304
I'm not a guest.
I'm the queen's sister.

548
01:39:45,513 --> 01:39:47,390
- Get up!
- No, I'm staying here.

549
01:39:47,598 --> 01:39:49,266
You are not listening to me, get up!

550
01:39:49,475 --> 01:39:51,977
- You may go now.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

551
01:39:52,186 --> 01:39:54,063
Dora, they want me to leave.

552
01:39:54,689 --> 01:39:56,566
What did I tell you?

553
01:39:56,774 --> 01:39:59,902
You have to keep quiet. Remember?

554
01:40:01,571 --> 01:40:04,281
- It's a secret.
- I want to be with you.

555
01:40:04,490 --> 01:40:06,576
You can't be with me.

556
01:40:06,992 --> 01:40:09,912
- Do you want me to lose everything?
- No.

557
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,997
So you need to go.

558
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,879
Go!

559
01:40:19,505 --> 01:40:22,425
- I want to be with you.
- I said go!

560
01:40:28,889 --> 01:40:30,349
Go!

561
01:40:50,369 --> 01:40:51,996
Dora...

562
01:40:52,204 --> 01:40:54,540
I thought maybe I could sleep here.

563
01:40:54,749 --> 01:40:57,251
I'm tired of being alone.

564
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:01,421
Listen to me, you can't stay here,
no one must see you, you have to go.

565
01:41:01,631 --> 01:41:04,759
- I want to be with you.
- And you can't.

566
01:41:04,967 --> 01:41:08,095
- Why?
- Take a look at yourself, Imma!

567
01:41:08,303 --> 01:41:10,389
You're old.

568
01:41:10,598 --> 01:41:12,683
No one would believe we are sisters.

569
01:41:13,518 --> 01:41:16,646
I want to become young too.
I want to.

570
01:41:16,854 --> 01:41:19,356
I want to! How did you do it?

571
01:41:19,565 --> 01:41:22,276
- I already told you, I don't know...
- No, tell me!

572
01:41:22,484 --> 01:41:24,987
- You tell me!
- I changed my...

573
01:41:25,195 --> 01:41:27,907
I had myself flayed.
Now that's enough!

574
01:41:37,082 --> 01:41:39,168
Don't you dare move.

575
01:42:39,478 --> 01:42:42,606
- What? No!
- It's okay...

576
01:42:42,815 --> 01:42:44,900
Her, again!

577
01:42:45,275 --> 01:42:46,944
Guards!

578
01:42:47,361 --> 01:42:49,238
Guards!

579
01:42:50,155 --> 01:42:52,032
- Guards!
- Calm down...

580
01:42:52,241 --> 01:42:55,160
- Guards!
- She's no one, I can explain.

581
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:57,371
- Who is she?
- She's a neighbor...

582
01:42:57,579 --> 01:42:59,456
She's behind. Get her out!

583
01:43:00,499 --> 01:43:03,627
- Who is she?
- She won't do anything, please...

584
01:43:04,253 --> 01:43:06,756
- Take her out!
- Please, don't hurt her...

585
01:43:06,964 --> 01:43:09,466
What was she doing in my bedroom?
Out of my sight!

586
01:43:10,509 --> 01:43:12,177
Out of my sight!

587
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:14,847
No... no...

588
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:18,017
I have to stay here, with my sister.

589
01:43:29,694 --> 01:43:32,614
Master barber, I have
something to ask you.

590
01:43:32,823 --> 01:43:34,074
Tell me.

591
01:43:35,826 --> 01:43:37,912
Could you change my skin?

592
01:43:39,288 --> 01:43:40,956
Flay me.

593
01:43:41,373 --> 01:43:44,293
Why would you want to do that?

594
01:43:44,501 --> 01:43:46,796
Because I want to be young again.

595
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:49,089
My dear...

596
01:43:50,299 --> 01:43:52,176
You will die.

597
01:43:52,384 --> 01:43:55,720
I can pay you, my sister's a queen.

598
01:43:56,805 --> 01:43:58,891
A queen?

599
01:43:59,724 --> 01:44:02,227
Well... then...

600
01:44:02,853 --> 01:44:04,939
You go tell the queen

601
01:44:05,355 --> 01:44:08,692
not to let you out on your own again.

602
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:13,488
Come on, go back home.

603
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,300
Sir...

604
01:44:34,551 --> 01:44:36,011
Sir...

605
01:44:40,599 --> 01:44:43,102
I have something to ask you.

606
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:45,812
- What?
- Can you change my skin?

607
01:44:46,855 --> 01:44:50,400
- Change your skin?
- Flay me.

608
01:44:52,569 --> 01:44:54,863
- Flay you?
- I can pay you.

609
01:44:55,072 --> 01:44:58,117
My sister is the queen.

610
01:44:58,325 --> 01:44:59,368
Sir...

611
01:48:07,681 --> 01:48:09,140
Help!

612
01:48:12,977 --> 01:48:16,648
Help me, please! Please!

613
01:48:16,856 --> 01:48:19,901
I'm being held prisoner by an ogre.

614
01:48:20,151 --> 01:48:22,487
You must have heard about me,
I'm a princess.

615
01:48:22,696 --> 01:48:25,615
The king's daughter who was given
in marriage to an ogre.

616
01:48:25,824 --> 01:48:28,326
I need you to help me
to get to the other side.

617
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:32,080
Where is this ogre
that holds you prisoner?

618
01:48:32,288 --> 01:48:34,165
He's hunting but he will back in.

619
01:48:34,374 --> 01:48:37,293
I have to get across before he comes
back. You have to help me now.

620
01:48:45,635 --> 01:48:47,721
How can I help you?

621
01:48:52,934 --> 01:48:54,393
I'm sorry.

622
01:48:55,019 --> 01:48:57,939
No! Please don't go!

623
01:49:00,650 --> 01:49:03,152
I can't stay here!

624
01:49:04,195 --> 01:49:06,490
Please, stay!

625
01:49:08,366 --> 01:49:11,077
Please! Please!

626
01:49:20,253 --> 01:49:23,590
I have my sons,
they can save you.

627
01:49:23,798 --> 01:49:25,925
But you have to wait until tomorrow.

628
01:49:26,134 --> 01:49:29,262
No, I can't wait until tomorrow.

629
01:49:29,470 --> 01:49:32,306
Don't be afraid, trust me.
We'll come back tomorrow.

630
01:49:32,516 --> 01:49:37,103
No! Please, don't go!
Don't leave me, please!

631
01:51:48,526 --> 01:51:50,945
Violet!

632
01:53:49,688 --> 01:53:51,357
Mother!

633
01:59:33,156 --> 01:59:34,825
<i>Your majesty!</i>

634
01:59:35,450 --> 01:59:37,119
<i>Your majesty!</i>

635
01:59:38,161 --> 01:59:40,247
<i>Violet is here!</i>

636
01:59:40,663 --> 01:59:43,375
<i>The princess has returned!</i>

637
01:59:43,583 --> 01:59:47,129
<i>Your Majesty! Violet is here.</i>

638
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,925
Violet has come home to us.

639
01:59:53,176 --> 01:59:57,139
Come, sir, It would do
your heart good to see her.

640
01:59:57,347 --> 01:59:59,474
Your Majesty, don't move.

641
01:59:59,682 --> 02:00:02,811
Please, Your Majesty...

642
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:06,982
You are too weak...

643
02:00:15,073 --> 02:00:16,533
Violet!

644
02:00:33,842 --> 02:00:36,970
Here is the husband
that you chose for me.

645
02:00:50,317 --> 02:00:52,402
Forgive me.

646
02:00:52,610 --> 02:00:55,738
Please, forgive me.

647
02:01:08,043 --> 02:01:10,128
Violet...
