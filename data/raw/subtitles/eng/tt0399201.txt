1
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,552
You're special.

2
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:54,256
You have a very special
purpose in life.

3
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:57,878
You've been chosen.

4
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:11,220
The Island awaits you.

5
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:02,030
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

6
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,827
Good morning, Tower One.

7
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:34,339
Exterior contamination index
is 85 percent.

8
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:35,840
Sunny and mild.

9
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,415
Hey, I'm missing a left shoe.

10
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:54,599
And when you get a chance,
I'd like another color.

11
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:07,398
- Morning.
- Good morning.

12
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,144
- Hey, Lincoln. How you doing?
- I'm missing a shoe.

13
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:30,815
- Hey, you're cutting.
- Yeah.

14
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:33,531
Thank you.

15
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:36,384
We're full.

16
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:42,940
Good morning.
July 19th, 2019.

17
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:45,182
Another day in paradise.

18
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:00,635
Starkweather Two Delta,

19
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:02,014
your time has come.

20
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,927
You're moving out to the Island.

21
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:06,879
Starkweather Two Delta here.

22
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,205
And, as you know, the biggest dream
of my life just came true.

23
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,889
I've only been with you guys
for, like, six months,

24
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,649
but I won the lottery.

25
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:17,238
- That's right, me, Starkweather, OK?
- Six months.

26
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,620
To go out and breathe fresh air,
swim in the ocean...

27
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:25,686
I can't believe I won.
You call me Mr. Popular, I know.

28
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:28,342
It's me. It's me.

29
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:32,852
You guys know I'm not like this,
but this is just amazing.

30
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,245
I'm going to the Island!
We're gonna have so much fun!

31
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:40,090
But I need to see you guys out there.
You can do it! I won!

32
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:41,399
That was this week's...

33
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,922
We got a disturbance
on elevator 12, plaza level.

34
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:47,573
...just moments before his
final departure to the Island,

35
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:50,577
nature's last remaining
pathogen-free zone.

36
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,788
- Lucky guy, huh?
- You can be a winner too.

37
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,824
The next lottery is tonight.

38
00:05:57,113 --> 00:06:00,626
The next lottery is tonight.

39
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:05,557
- How long have you been here?
- Two years.

40
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:09,046
- What about you?
- Three.

41
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:11,021
Three. I've been here seven.

42
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:15,186
If I do the math, that makes me
the biggest lottery loser in the room.

43
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:19,280
I'm such a loser.

44
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:50,063
Sir.

45
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:52,040
Yeah, you.

46
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,464
Swipe.

47
00:06:56,913 --> 00:07:00,295
Gandu Three Echo, you've been flagged
for public disturbance before.

48
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:03,248
Yes, I had a very small
emotional outburst, sir.

49
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:05,801
- Safe to say it's over?
- Yes, very safe.

50
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:09,738
- I'm feeling much better.
- Well, then, have a pleasant day.

51
00:07:09,808 --> 00:07:12,557
Thank you, you too.
You both have a pleasant day too.

52
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:35,980
Feel the stretch.

53
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,824
One more breath in.

54
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,389
But I was in that section.

55
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,985
No, I don't understand!

56
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:00,578
- I tried! I tried to do the best I...
- Listen to me!

57
00:08:01,577 --> 00:08:06,311
Remember, be polite,
pleasant and peaceful.

58
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:10,053
A healthy person is a happy person.

59
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,262
Lincoln Six Echo, choices are fruit,
oatmeal and any type of bran.

60
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:21,756
No bacon today?

61
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:23,936
You got a nutrition flag,
means no bacon.

62
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:26,428
In that case, two eggs,
over easy, not too runny,

63
00:08:26,502 --> 00:08:27,876
and a side of sausages.

64
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:30,659
Maybe some French toast
and a little powdered sugar.

65
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:34,975
You ain't cute and I got no time
for your lip, Six Echo.

66
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:36,899
Now, what's it gonna be?

67
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:37,980
Move it.

68
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,984
Surprise me.

69
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,474
Surprise.

70
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,572
Yummy. Next.

71
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:06,556
Watch and learn.

72
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:09,050
Next.

73
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,487
Jordan Two Delta.

74
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,046
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

75
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,501
Choices are powdered eggs,
dried fruit and yogurt.

76
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:19,325
- Eggs, please.
- OK.

77
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,610
So, where were you the other day?
We missed you.

78
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:27,221
That's nice of you to say, sweetheart.

79
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,430
Get you anything else?

80
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:31,608
Maybe a little bacon.

81
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:34,164
No, it says I shouldn't.

82
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:37,815
- Go ahead.
- Four, five pieces, please.

83
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:40,728
Thank you.

84
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,338
Well, good luck.
Gotta run along now.

85
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:47,543
You're not going.
You gotta stay for dinner.

86
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:50,165
- I softened her up for you.
- No doubt.

87
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:52,821
- Back on your diet?
- You kidding? I love this stuff.

88
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:55,542
Better eat up.
You'll need all your strength tonight.

89
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:56,756
Is that a challenge?

90
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:59,347
I promise I'll go easy on you.

91
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,919
Please separate.
Find your seats now.

92
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:06,841
Yeah.

93
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:12,310
"'Who wants Sally? ' said Dick.
'I do,' said Jane.

94
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:15,060
'I cannot find Sally.

95
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:19,635
Get up, Dick.
Get up and help me find Sally.

96
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:22,191
Is Sally here?"'

97
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:36,561
Dr. Merrick will see you now.

98
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:43,538
What'd you do wrong this time,
tough guy?

99
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:48,976
Sir?

100
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:53,649
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Please.

101
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,826
Please, sit down.

102
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:07,147
So, how is Lincoln Six Echo today?

103
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:09,673
Not so good, I guess.

104
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:11,655
Why do you say that?

105
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,413
Well, if I'm here,
it means I'm not so good.

106
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:17,382
That's a rather negative association.

107
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:21,711
My only job is to see that you're happy,
things are OK with you.

108
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:23,303
Right.

109
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:29,318
Your file shows that you've
been interacting regularly

110
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:30,635
with Jordan Two Delta.

111
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:34,477
- There's no law against friendship.
- No. No, we encourage it,

112
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:38,765
but, obviously,
proximity could become a concern.

113
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,717
I know the rules of proximity.

114
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:45,510
You've been doing quite well
in most other areas.

115
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:48,482
Proficient at work,
exercising rigorously.

116
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:51,971
But screening has picked up
some trace levels,

117
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:56,004
changes in your metabolism,
and you've been having nightmares.

118
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:58,759
Are you saying there's
something wrong with me?

119
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:01,315
Why don't you tell me
about your dream?

120
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:06,218
Well, it's the same dream every time.
I'm on a boat, headed to the Island.

121
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:09,414
A boat? What kind of boat?

122
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:12,167
A nice boat.

123
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:13,728
Draw it for me, would you?

124
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:22,312
So, you are heading
toward the Island.

125
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,286
What happens then?

126
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:27,109
- I drown.
- Really?

127
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,974
- Why do you think that is?
- I don't know. You tell me.

128
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:33,950
- Maybe you're afraid of winning.
- Why would I be afraid?

129
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:35,812
You tell me.

130
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,627
What's troubling you, Lincoln?

131
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,530
Well, it's...

132
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,670
It's just...

133
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:51,616
All right.
Tuesday night is tofu night.

134
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:54,880
And I'm asking myself, who decided
that everyone here likes tofu

135
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:57,436
in the first place?
And what is tofu, anyway?

136
00:12:57,508 --> 00:13:00,574
And why can't I have bacon?
I line up every morning,

137
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:03,458
and I'm not allowed any bacon
for my breakfast.

138
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,596
And...
Let's talk about all the white.

139
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,772
Why is everyone
wearing white all the time?

140
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:11,355
It's impossible to keep clean.
I always get the gray stripe.

141
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:14,011
I never get any color.
And I hand it in to be cleaned,

142
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:17,977
and someone cleans it, and folds it
neatly back in my drawer, but who?

143
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:20,799
Who is that person? I don't know.

144
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:22,523
I just... I wanna know answers.

145
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,243
And I wish that there was more.

146
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,189
- More?
- Yeah.

147
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:32,380
More than just waiting
to go to the Island.

148
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:37,307
Lincoln,

149
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,092
it's your nature
to question things.

150
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,828
But don't you realize how lucky you are?
That you survived the contamination.

151
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:48,920
That nature has left you
a Garden of Eden to repopulate.

152
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,088
That, Lincoln, is your purpose.

153
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:59,601
Right. And you?
Arert you going to the Island too?

154
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:02,010
No.

155
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:05,175
My responsibility is to make sure

156
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,447
this facility continues to operate.

157
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:12,916
That's why people like me,
my staff and supervisors, we...

158
00:14:12,987 --> 00:14:15,540
...we can't win the lottery.

159
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,213
Let me see that.

160
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:23,990
You draw well.

161
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:26,905
"Renovatio."
What does that mean?

162
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:29,140
I don't know.
It's always in my dream.

163
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:33,751
I'd like to run some tests
on you, Lincoln.

164
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,895
What sort of tests?

165
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:39,183
Nice tests.

166
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:40,532
Come with me.

167
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:49,041
Take a seat.

168
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:55,853
OK, let's get you comfortable.

169
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:57,354
Swing back.

170
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:05,203
- I thought these were nice tests.
- It's a synaptic brain scan.

171
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:07,373
Totally harmless.

172
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:10,291
Don't worry, it's painless.

173
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:31,847
- It hurts.
- Not really.

174
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:33,578
- Yeah, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

175
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,884
Yeah, it really, really does!

176
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,881
The micro-sensors
will move along your optic nerve.

177
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:47,147
They'll be uploading readings
to us over the next 24 hours,

178
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:49,800
after which,
you'll pass them through your urine.

179
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,910
Now, that might hurt.

180
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:04,389
Six Echo, you're late.

181
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:20,544
Jones, you ever get bored doing this?

182
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:21,796
- Doing what?
- This.

183
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:24,736
- I never really thought about it.
- I think about it a lot.

184
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,697
- About what?
- This boring job.

185
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:29,795
- What are we doing here?
- We're feeding the nutrient lines.

186
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:33,345
We eat food, food's gotta have
vitamins, right? It's good for us.

187
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:35,969
You don't ever wonder about anything?

188
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:38,439
Where do these tubes go?

189
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,998
They start there.

190
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:43,879
And they go... right there.

191
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:47,846
Hey. Did you get a look
at the new guy?

192
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:49,885
Seven Foxtrot.

193
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:53,571
They found another survivor.
They keep finding them.

194
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,231
He'll probably win the lottery.

195
00:16:55,302 --> 00:16:58,433
Straight down, in the hole.
There you go, you try it.

196
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:01,666
Straight down in the hole.

197
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:05,410
In the hole.
No, no, no. Put it down.

198
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:08,770
Did we all look that stupid
when we went through decontamination?

199
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:13,179
Hey, Mr. Man-With-All-The-Questions,
let me ask you this:

200
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:16,061
Lottery's supposed
to be random, right?

201
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:17,179
Right.

202
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:19,487
What if it's not?
What if it's rigged?

203
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:21,307
Rigged?

204
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:24,730
I've been working on this. Here.

205
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:26,712
Take a look at that.

206
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:30,264
It charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on the Island.

207
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:33,501
Excluding, of course, the women,
picked to be breeders.

208
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:36,383
- What is this?
- I took the first letter in each name.

209
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:39,448
I assigned it a point value system,
based on the alphabet,

210
00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:41,887
like the last guy,
Starkweather, S equals 15.

211
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:43,545
Q equals 15, S equals 19.

212
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,624
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- No.

213
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:49,044
Well, maybe if you would listen to me,
I'm trying to tell you.

214
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,381
You string the numbers together.
You divide it by the amount...

215
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,709
You multiply... You divide it by
the amount of... You divide it...

216
00:17:55,775 --> 00:18:00,084
You divide it by the amount of people,
which is 25, a thousand plus five, 2500.

217
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:03,769
You know what that spells?
J-O-N-E-S.

218
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:07,319
- I'm winning the lottery tonight.
- Did you pack?

219
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:10,108
- No.
- Gentlemen,

220
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:13,459
I'm gonna go mess with Foxtrot.

221
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:15,572
There you go. Straight.

222
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,847
Straight down in the hole.

223
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,705
- There you go.
- Straight...

224
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:23,700
- What? He had something on his... OK.
- Go.

225
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:30,517
Lima! Are you OK?
What's wrong?

226
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:34,066
Code 15, we need med-techs stat!
Lima One Alpha.

227
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:35,795
Let's give her some air, OK?

228
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,385
You're gonna be OK, all right?
Relax and breathe.

229
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:40,977
Can I get a wheelchair?
It's for Lima One Alpha.

230
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:44,397
- You OK?
- I think it's time.

231
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:49,708
Lima, you're going to the Island.

232
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:52,663
- We're going.
- Oh, you're so lucky.

233
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,550
I hope I see you soon.

234
00:18:57,111 --> 00:19:01,780
Everyone, please follow her out.
Quickly and carefully. Watch the glass.

235
00:19:01,846 --> 00:19:03,886
- Good luck, Lima.
- Thank you.

236
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:10,420
That's fair. That's real fair.

237
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:13,801
Ladies, ladies, push back, please.
Gentlemen. Thank you.

238
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,697
Everyone, back to work.

239
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:21,651
That is so not fair.

240
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:26,349
Oh, man, I hate this jealousy thing.
It's giving me heart palpitations.

241
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:28,394
Tech Services.

242
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,190
Computer's down again.

243
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:33,001
I'm down.
Computer guy's in Sector Six.

244
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:36,336
I have to deal with this mess.
Take my Tri-Key. Contamination kit.

245
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:38,409
- Hurry back.
- Absolutely.

246
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,707
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna see this guy.

247
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,547
Hey, chief. We got live wires
all over the place here.

248
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:16,711
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

249
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:18,883
- What?
- I've been looking...

250
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:21,770
- Can't hear you.
- I've been looking all over for you.

251
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:26,059
If you go and get yourself contaminated,
don't come pointing the finger at me.

252
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,334
How you doing, Mac?

253
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:30,499
- What are you doing here?
- My chip fried again.

254
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:33,386
Yeah. How much longer
do you think that one's gonna work?

255
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:38,561
- What are you two clowns looking at?
- Hey,

256
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,608
you got any of that stuff
on you today?

257
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,908
Oh, look, it's break time.
Come on.

258
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:48,296
You're a bad influence on me.

259
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:51,176
Must be why I like you so much.

260
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,948
What's it like where you live?
In Sector Five?

261
00:20:58,983 --> 00:21:02,463
It's fine. You know,
it's like any other sector, I guess.

262
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:08,540
I like coming out here, talking.

263
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:11,167
Most supervisors don't like to talk.

264
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:12,318
Yeah.

265
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:15,803
Step into my office.

266
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:24,804
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah, sometimes.

267
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,723
Where are their clothes?

268
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:28,032
What's with Dr. Merrick?

269
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,572
You mean why does he act like he's
got a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?

270
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:33,690
Yeah.

271
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:35,967
It's called a God complex.

272
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:38,969
All doctors are like that.
They think they know everything.

273
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:41,082
What's God?

274
00:21:41,154 --> 00:21:43,609
Well, you know when you
want something really bad

275
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:45,787
and you close your eyes
and you wish for it?

276
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:49,916
- God's the guy that ignores you.
- Oh. Right.

277
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:52,538
Tech Service requested
in Product Extraction.

278
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,713
Yeah, I'll be right there.

279
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:00,797
Oh, hey. Let me get that.

280
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:03,646
Where do you get that stuff, anyway?

281
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:06,394
It's an old stash.
You know, from before.

282
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:08,470
You mean from
before the contamination?

283
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:11,641
Yeah. Come on, you're killing me
with questions here.

284
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,466
You got a sweet deal here, you know?

285
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:16,763
Because you're,
you know, like, special.

286
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:18,552
Why? Why am I special?

287
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,182
There's another question.

288
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:23,033
You remember what we talked about?

289
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,555
You don't tell anybody
about our conversations?

290
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:28,759
- 'Cause that can get me in big trouble.
- No, I don't.

291
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,267
Good.

292
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,922
How's it going?

293
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:13,360
Hey, how are you?
How's your world?

294
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:16,078
OK, I'll catch you later.

295
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,900
Chinese junk locked up again, huh?

296
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:23,315
Yep.

297
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:25,236
What a surprise.

298
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,914
Go hot.

299
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,891
- You better fix that thing.
- Yeah.

300
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:38,801
You'd think with the money
this place rakes in

301
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:41,234
- they could afford decent equipment.
- Yeah.

302
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:43,789
Ready?

303
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:47,207
Cut the O2.

304
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:52,976
Seriously, unless you want to see me
blow chunks, can you wait till I'm gone?

305
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,048
- Sever the umbilical.
- Cutting.

306
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:18,665
Breathe.

307
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:22,115
Come on, yeah. That's it.

308
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:27,845
Come on, breathe. Breathe.

309
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:29,095
Come on.

310
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:32,904
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe!

311
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,273
There we go.
Now we're working.

312
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,096
He's healthy.

313
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,645
Welcome to the world.

314
00:24:44,203 --> 00:24:46,210
So, how's Three Helo?

315
00:24:46,283 --> 00:24:47,689
Good.

316
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,494
He's feisty. Light.

317
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,877
Vitals seem fine.

318
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:59,528
- Smooth extraction?
- Yep.

319
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:04,450
Looks like we have a fine product.

320
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:06,691
Tag him and ship him to Foundation.

321
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:22,361
Little bug.

322
00:27:07,641 --> 00:27:10,674
Maybe next time I won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

323
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:19,885
It was very sad.

324
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:21,681
- Hey.
- Hello.

325
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:23,475
Hi.

326
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:27,670
So you just let
a little girl beat you, huh?

327
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,897
Stim units restricted.

328
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:32,907
Yeah, yeah.
I'll have the veggie stuff.

329
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,699
Papassian petal juice, please.

330
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:37,390
It's good for the skin.

331
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:50,578
Jordan, are you sick?

332
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:56,264
When I was in Dr. Merrick's office,
I thought I saw your name on a file.

333
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:57,964
No, I'm fine.

334
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:00,201
OK.

335
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:02,641
How are you?

336
00:28:02,706 --> 00:28:04,713
I'm fine.

337
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:06,608
Lincoln, I can tell when you're lying

338
00:28:06,674 --> 00:28:09,805
'cause your mouth smiles
but your eyes don't.

339
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:13,223
I found something.

340
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:14,507
- What?
- A bug.

341
00:28:15,088 --> 00:28:16,746
- A bug?
- A flying bug.

342
00:28:16,848 --> 00:28:17,775
Can I see it?

343
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:19,912
I think it came
in the ventilation shaft.

344
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:22,602
I thought they went extinct
with the contamination.

345
00:28:22,672 --> 00:28:25,126
I know. And how did it get by
the pathogen sensors?

346
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,687
- It must be too small.
- No, it's not too small.

347
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:30,889
How did it survive out there, anyway?
How does anyone survive?

348
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,708
They keep finding people,
but where do they come from?

349
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:36,773
It's good that they find survivors.

350
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:40,522
Why do you always question the good?
You only think about the bad.

351
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:43,109
I just have a feeling
that something is wrong.

352
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:46,314
Good things do happen.

353
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:48,552
I want to see that bug.

354
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:52,865
Hey. Gandu learned a new word
from the censor.

355
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:55,011
- What?
- "Dude."

356
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:56,457
"Dude"?

357
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:58,694
- What does it mean?
- He just called me dude.

358
00:28:58,763 --> 00:29:00,770
- Hey, dude.
- He said "Hey, dude"?

359
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:02,664
- D-O-O-D. "Dude."
- Hey, dude.

360
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,388
- Dude.
- Dude.

361
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,913
- Lottery's gonna start.
- Like you stand a chance.

362
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:07,934
Dude.

363
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,621
Light up all etherscreens.

364
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,820
And... start the lottery.

365
00:29:22,312 --> 00:29:23,489
Good evening.

366
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:27,585
Live from Ether-Con,
welcome to the lottery spin.

367
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:30,406
It's been a busy week.

368
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:33,405
We've had a record two winners so far.

369
00:29:33,478 --> 00:29:36,609
Tonight's winner will be selected
at random for relocation

370
00:29:36,678 --> 00:29:40,834
to the Island, transported
to the world's last paradise.

371
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:44,065
- And start the spin.
- And now, let the spin begin.

372
00:29:49,092 --> 00:29:52,191
Jordan Two Delta, step up.

373
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:56,994
Your time has come.
You're moving out to the Island.

374
00:30:02,243 --> 00:30:06,039
For everyone else, never lose hope.

375
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,432
Thank you. Thank you.

376
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:13,149
I can't believe it.

377
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,975
I have to go in the morning.

378
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,949
You were right.

379
00:30:26,464 --> 00:30:28,984
Good things do happen.

380
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:35,484
I wish I'd known you better.

381
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:38,264
You two.

382
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:39,709
Watch your proximity.

383
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:50,264
I'll see you on the Island.

384
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:10,832
You want to go to the Island.

385
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,918
Breathe!

386
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:19,823
You've been chosen.

387
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:24,815
The Island awaits you.

388
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,620
Check into the nurses' station
up the corridor, take your first left.

389
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,430
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

390
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:49,641
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

391
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:52,064
She's so beautiful.

392
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:55,324
I've never seen a baby.

393
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:56,706
Can I hold her?

394
00:33:56,774 --> 00:33:58,235
Notjust yet.

395
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:06,723
Are we going to the Island?

396
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,120
Oh, my God.

397
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:25,978
Congratulations, it's a beautiful girl.

398
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:27,766
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

399
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,721
It's my baby. Oh, my gosh.

400
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:30,996
Whenever you're ready,

401
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:34,643
we have copies of your
policy termination for your records.

402
00:35:34,713 --> 00:35:37,331
Look at her. She's beautiful.

403
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:43,220
Starkweather? That big, cute football
player on the Reebok commercials?

404
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:45,938
I love him! Is he in there?
I thought that was him, girl!

405
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,600
I just love him!

406
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,668
That's great.
Listen, you're a real hoot.

407
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,629
Any chance I can make this pickup?

408
00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:54,898
Well, he's still in surgery. Sorry.

409
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:59,090
Lady, I've got a bird on the pad
and a storm's coming in.

410
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:02,321
We don't fly in bad weather.

411
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,335
They look real busy.
So I'd have a seat.

412
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,721
Grim Reaper coming in here
with an attitude.

413
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:16,716
Heart rate 102.
BP 126 over 82.

414
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,729
- Laser cutter ready?
- It's ready.

415
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:21,683
- Make sure suctiors functioning.
- Ventilating easily.

416
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,601
- Very good.
- Grid in place.

417
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:24,812
Prepare that bone saw.

418
00:36:26,738 --> 00:36:29,226
I think we're about ready to open.

419
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,170
Let's clean that drip.

420
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,574
Doctor, heart rate's rising.

421
00:36:56,399 --> 00:37:00,621
Heart rate's still rising, doctor.

422
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:06,700
- What's his blood pressure?
- BP 138 over 92.

423
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:10,860
Heart rate's still rising.

424
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:13,991
- Boost the anesthetic level!
- He's fighting the ventilator.

425
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:16,482
I don't wanna euthanize this guy
to get his liver!

426
00:37:24,683 --> 00:37:25,795
Guards!

427
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:29,065
Oh, my God!

428
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,759
Stop that man! Get him!

429
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:47,006
Stop!

430
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:04,925
All right, relax, relax, big guy.
Relax.

431
00:38:04,998 --> 00:38:07,005
Easy, easy, easy!
Don't damage him!

432
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:11,899
- Relax!
- No!

433
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:14,394
I don't want to die, no! No!

434
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:18,178
I want to go to the Island!
You promised!

435
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:21,539
I wanna live!
I don't wanna die!

436
00:38:21,604 --> 00:38:23,131
No!

437
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:26,754
Hey.

438
00:38:27,491 --> 00:38:30,906
You OK, buddy? It's not the first time
this has happened, you know.

439
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,977
Ether-Con. Product is secure.

440
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:46,523
Check this part out.

441
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:48,535
Wait, OK, watch.
Wait, wait.

442
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:52,186
Boom! Did you see that? Man.

443
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:54,711
That is so cruel, man.

444
00:38:55,456 --> 00:38:58,074
Oh, man. Down for the count.

445
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:02,332
Gentlemen, I understand
there's been an incident.

446
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:05,268
Sir, Starkweather ran
from the operating theater.

447
00:39:05,374 --> 00:39:07,829
- And do you find that funny?
- No, sir.

448
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:10,869
- Do you?
- Definitely not, sir.

449
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:13,047
Play it back, please.

450
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:19,641
Stop.

451
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:21,333
- Who is that?
- That's just an RN.

452
00:39:21,404 --> 00:39:23,608
He was scared, I helped him up.

453
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,969
Play it back at half-speed.

454
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:34,100
Freeze.

455
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:36,568
Magnify his wrist.

456
00:39:41,274 --> 00:39:43,063
We have a product on the loose.

457
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,584
- Get me a facial match.
- We're on it.

458
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:49,070
- Let's go.
- OK, down to Level 2.

459
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:03,443
You can't come in here!

460
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:11,404
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

461
00:40:28,148 --> 00:40:30,057
- How sweet.
- You gotta come with me.

462
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:31,080
What?

463
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:33,260
Move! Move!

464
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:44,305
We got a match!
Lincoln Six Echo.

465
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,639
I want a full contamination lockdown.

466
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,047
Find Six Echo.

467
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,303
- Masks down.
- What the hell?!

468
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:55,434
- I need to see all your faces.
- I don't care what he says, nurse,

469
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:58,286
that's live human tissue.
Seal that liver now.

470
00:40:58,352 --> 00:40:59,978
Check the back corners!

471
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:08,106
How did that agnate get upstairs
into the Medical Sector?

472
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:10,213
Find out.

473
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:15,079
- Men aren't supposed to be...
- You gotta trust me.

474
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,098
- What?
- I saw them.

475
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,377
- Who?
- Lima and Starkweather. They're dead.

476
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:20,900
- What?
- They killed her and cut him open...

477
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:22,860
Stop it!
I want to go back to my room.

478
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:25,706
- They're gonna kill you.
- I'm going to the Island.

479
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:27,845
Jordan, there is no Island!
Come on!

480
00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:31,942
I got Six Echo in Female Tower,
floor 32.

481
00:41:32,012 --> 00:41:34,630
- He's got a female product in tow.
- Track that.

482
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:37,033
Get out of the way!

483
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:38,822
Move! Move!

484
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:40,930
Out of the way!
Get out. Now.

485
00:41:41,643 --> 00:41:42,788
Just trust me.

486
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,256
This is a community bulletin.

487
00:41:49,322 --> 00:41:50,980
Attention, residents,

488
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,977
a contamination alert
has been issued for Lincoln Six Echo.

489
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:59,304
Anyone coming in contact with him
will be quarantined.

490
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,741
Move! Move!

491
00:42:07,495 --> 00:42:09,088
Freeze! Stop right there!

492
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,369
Go! Go! Go!

493
00:42:30,436 --> 00:42:31,483
Get out of the way!

494
00:42:40,195 --> 00:42:43,773
I've got two agnates on the move
on the second floor.

495
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:58,935
There they are!

496
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:03,384
I've got them in Sector Six basement!
Get them!

497
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:16,092
- No!
- Stop!

498
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:27,992
- Lincoln!
- Get up!

499
00:43:28,062 --> 00:43:29,044
No!

500
00:43:29,885 --> 00:43:31,445
Stop it!

501
00:43:33,149 --> 00:43:34,425
No!

502
00:44:10,616 --> 00:44:15,187
You've been chosen.
You have a very special purpose.

503
00:44:15,255 --> 00:44:18,735
You're part of a new beginning.
You're special.

504
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:21,805
You have a very special purpose.

505
00:44:26,134 --> 00:44:28,981
You want to go to the Island.
Your purpose in life

506
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:31,892
is to populate the Island.
You're part of a new beginning.

507
00:44:31,957 --> 00:44:35,601
You're special. Very special.
You've been chosen.

508
00:44:35,668 --> 00:44:38,538
You've been chosen.
Chosen to survive, to carry on.

509
00:44:38,612 --> 00:44:41,907
You want to go to the Island.

510
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:49,103
- Go, go!
- You have a very special purpose.

511
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,861
Very special.

512
00:44:55,954 --> 00:44:57,842
- He's gotta be in here.
- I'm looking!

513
00:44:57,906 --> 00:44:59,815
Check over here!

514
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:01,199
Watch your left!

515
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:03,723
Run!

516
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:08,781
Go! Run!

517
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:10,278
He's over here!

518
00:45:16,912 --> 00:45:18,984
There they are! Go!

519
00:45:32,238 --> 00:45:35,172
- Lincoln!
- Come on! Get him!

520
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,787
- Let s go. Move!
- Come on!

521
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,245
Come on! Come on!

522
00:45:42,316 --> 00:45:44,836
Damn! Go, go! Go!

523
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,501
Come on, let's go!

524
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:51,940
You still think there's an Island?

525
00:46:02,442 --> 00:46:03,751
Come on!

526
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,532
Come on. Come on!

527
00:46:47,076 --> 00:46:49,497
There's a door over here!

528
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:06,680
Lincoln Six Echo remains in quarantine
after contamination exposure.

529
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:11,863
Jordan Two Delta was safely transported
to her new home on the Island.

530
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,777
Jones Three Echo, I need you
to concentrate in this lab.

531
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:18,386
Sir, I want to focus more than anything.
I love my job. It's interesting.

532
00:48:18,456 --> 00:48:21,456
But Lincoln Six Echo
has been contaminated,

533
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:24,463
and it really worries me,
because he's a good friend of mine.

534
00:48:24,536 --> 00:48:26,902
He's one of my best friends.
My only best friend.

535
00:48:26,968 --> 00:48:29,007
He'll be fine, Three Echo.

536
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:31,184
Sir, I have one question.

537
00:48:31,255 --> 00:48:33,295
Where do all the tubes go?

538
00:48:35,671 --> 00:48:37,493
The human organism.

539
00:48:37,558 --> 00:48:40,405
Unique in all the universe
in its complexity.

540
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:43,285
The product of three billion years
of evolution.

541
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,666
Perfect in every way, except one.

542
00:48:46,741 --> 00:48:49,130
Like all machines, it wears out.

543
00:48:50,773 --> 00:48:53,391
For centuries, the idea
of replenishing the human body

544
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:55,500
has been
at the forefront of science.

545
00:48:55,572 --> 00:48:57,644
We need to turn this bad day
into a good day.

546
00:48:57,715 --> 00:48:59,471
- How?
- A terrific day. By selling.

547
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:02,441
By selling. Sell, sell, sell.
You start, I finish.

548
00:49:12,305 --> 00:49:14,094
Ladies and gentlemen,

549
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:17,936
welcome to
the next generation of science,

550
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:19,888
the agnate.

551
00:49:19,953 --> 00:49:23,913
An organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood

552
00:49:23,984 --> 00:49:25,707
to match the client's age.

553
00:49:25,776 --> 00:49:28,198
- You're looking at stage one
- This way, sir.

554
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:29,613
In its development.

555
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,233
Within 12 months
it will be harvest-ready,

556
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:35,816
providing a carrier for your baby,
a second pair of lungs, fresh skin.

557
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:39,880
All genetically indistinguishable
from your own.

558
00:49:39,983 --> 00:49:44,554
And, in compliance with
the eugenics laws of 2015,

559
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:49,575
all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state.

560
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:51,946
They never achieve consciousness.

561
00:49:52,013 --> 00:49:55,112
They never think or suffer

562
00:49:55,181 --> 00:49:59,042
or feel pain, joy, love, hate.

563
00:49:59,116 --> 00:50:01,833
It's a product, ladies and gentlemen,

564
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,550
in every way that matters,

565
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,302
not human.

566
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:14,337
This is our public relations director,
Mr. Whitman.

567
00:50:14,442 --> 00:50:16,449
He'll be happy
to answer any questions.

568
00:50:16,554 --> 00:50:18,921
Once again, thank you.
Mr. Whitman.

569
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:22,879
I want to talk about the smartest
investment you'll ever make.

570
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:27,359
And I want to tell you how you're
gonna live 60 to 70 years longer.

571
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,436
Dr. Merrick, Albert Laurent,
Blackhawk Security.

572
00:50:34,503 --> 00:50:38,081
You come highly recommended
by the Defense Department, Mr. Laurent.

573
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:40,867
Though I'm unaware
of your personal qualifications.

574
00:50:40,934 --> 00:50:43,651
My men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.

575
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,400
I was formerly with the GIGN,
French Special Forces.

576
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,673
I understand you had a corporate theft.

577
00:50:48,742 --> 00:50:51,076
Yes, that's what I told
the Defense Department.

578
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:54,938
The reality is a little more complex.
That's why I require your services.

579
00:50:55,012 --> 00:50:58,012
We've had a... security breach.

580
00:50:58,085 --> 00:51:01,630
You have the Defense Department
at your disposal. Why call me?

581
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,187
Because their
investment here is sizeable.

582
00:51:04,259 --> 00:51:07,423
One hundred and twenty
billion dollars, to be exact.

583
00:51:07,491 --> 00:51:10,305
And I can't afford
for them to reconsider.

584
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:12,541
What you tell them
is your business, doctor.

585
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,425
I am in the business
of keeping my clients' confidence.

586
00:51:15,523 --> 00:51:16,929
Good.

587
00:51:21,218 --> 00:51:23,454
Two of our products have escaped.

588
00:51:23,521 --> 00:51:26,390
Impressive,
considering they're vegetative.

589
00:51:26,465 --> 00:51:29,214
Well, after several years
of trial and error,

590
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,549
we discovered that
without consciousness,

591
00:51:31,616 --> 00:51:36,831
without human experience,
emotion, without life,

592
00:51:36,895 --> 00:51:39,099
the organs failed.

593
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,646
How long have they been missing?

594
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,369
Four hours and 36 minutes.

595
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:48,089
- They're on foot?
- Yes.

596
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:51,899
Wade, 1.2 miles an hour,
five mile perimeter,

597
00:51:51,966 --> 00:51:54,932
- standby for suspect description.
- We're on it.

598
00:51:55,037 --> 00:51:56,411
Follow me.

599
00:52:12,603 --> 00:52:15,985
- Come on, we gotta keep going.
- I have to stop. I can't run anymore.

600
00:52:16,058 --> 00:52:17,302
- You gotta try.
- Where?

601
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,791
- Anywhere but here.
- But there's nothing.

602
00:52:19,898 --> 00:52:22,548
Everything's dead, Lincoln.

603
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:30,263
What if we are contaminated?

604
00:52:30,808 --> 00:52:32,815
Then we'd be dead.

605
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:36,146
There's no contamination.
It was a lie.

606
00:52:46,966 --> 00:52:49,715
- What is it?
- I don't know.

607
00:52:49,783 --> 00:52:51,375
But it's alive.

608
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,699
Come on. It's mean, whatever it is.

609
00:52:58,805 --> 00:53:00,015
Let's rest in here.

610
00:53:00,085 --> 00:53:02,736
Jordan Two Delta's sponsor,
Sarah Jordan, is in a coma

611
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,838
after a car accident.
She's in need of multiple transplants.

612
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:07,567
How long does she have?

613
00:53:07,636 --> 00:53:10,002
Forty-eight hours.
Three days maximum.

614
00:53:10,068 --> 00:53:11,726
Tell me about Six Echo.

615
00:53:11,796 --> 00:53:15,057
He was really the first one
to question his environment,

616
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:16,584
his whole existence here.

617
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:20,685
Over the last few months,
he began demonstrating unstable behavior

618
00:53:20,755 --> 00:53:23,471
and I can't account for it.

619
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,937
I'm waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan.

620
00:53:26,034 --> 00:53:28,335
What do they know
about the outside world?

621
00:53:28,401 --> 00:53:30,256
Very little.

622
00:53:30,321 --> 00:53:33,288
We control them with
the memory of a shared event.

623
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:37,550
A global contamination.
It keeps them fearful of going outside.

624
00:53:37,616 --> 00:53:41,991
The Island is the one thing
that gives them hope,

625
00:53:42,064 --> 00:53:44,006
gives them purpose.

626
00:53:44,527 --> 00:53:46,698
Everything we expose them to,

627
00:53:46,767 --> 00:53:50,247
their programs, their can'toons,
books, the games they play,

628
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:53,798
are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills.

629
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,259
To avoid obvious complications,

630
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,886
they aren't imprinted
with an awareness of sex.

631
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:02,186
We find it simpler
to eliminate the drive altogether.

632
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:07,786
In a very real sense...
they're like children.

633
00:54:07,852 --> 00:54:10,437
Educated to the level of a 15-year-old.

634
00:54:26,922 --> 00:54:30,151
- What was that?
- I don't know.

635
00:54:31,466 --> 00:54:33,124
But I want one.

636
00:54:47,144 --> 00:54:48,802
Look!

637
00:54:49,607 --> 00:54:52,771
Route 39. Route 39.

638
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:54,748
Come on.

639
00:54:54,823 --> 00:54:56,895
I got it from a friend.

640
00:55:20,707 --> 00:55:22,649
I think that's it.

641
00:55:52,959 --> 00:55:54,039
What's up?

642
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,664
Yeah, do you know
a guy named McCord?

643
00:55:58,238 --> 00:56:00,343
Yeah, we know that tool.
Who's asking?

644
00:56:01,182 --> 00:56:04,826
- I am.
- And you would be who?

645
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:07,860
- Lincoln Six Echo.
- Jordan Two Delta.

646
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:10,873
Right.

647
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:13,690
Y'all some of those desert UFO freaks?

648
00:56:13,756 --> 00:56:16,723
- U... What? No, I don't think so.
- No.

649
00:56:16,796 --> 00:56:17,941
McCord?

650
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:20,346
Well, lucky day, Captain Kirk.
He's in the can.

651
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:22,713
- He's in a can?
- Taking a dump.

652
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,503
A dump? Taking it where?

653
00:56:27,035 --> 00:56:29,271
Bubba, you're fixing
to get on my nerves.

654
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:32,437
- It's the first door on the right.
- Thank you.

655
00:56:32,506 --> 00:56:35,440
I have to go.
He's taking a dump in a can.

656
00:56:35,546 --> 00:56:38,415
- Something to drink? Jack?
- Yes, please.

657
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:40,431
Straight up?

658
00:56:50,968 --> 00:56:53,204
Oh, that is bitchir.

659
00:56:55,383 --> 00:56:57,106
So this is Sector Five?

660
00:56:57,175 --> 00:56:59,379
Hey! You son of a bitch!

661
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:02,737
You knew!

662
00:57:02,806 --> 00:57:05,904
- How the hell did you get out?
- Why do they lie to us? Tell me!

663
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:07,730
They're gonna be looking for you.

664
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:10,896
- Tell me what's going on!
- If anybody sees us together,

665
00:57:10,997 --> 00:57:13,004
both of us are gonna be dead.

666
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:15,858
So, will you just
take your hands off me? Let me...

667
00:57:15,925 --> 00:57:20,048
Let me pull my pants up
and I'll take you back to my place

668
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:21,840
so we can be alone. OK?

669
00:57:24,756 --> 00:57:28,051
- Ed.
- Mac.

670
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:31,217
Give you... give you boys a minute?

671
00:57:32,627 --> 00:57:35,048
What?
This isn't what it looks like.

672
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:39,243
Sure. Sure.

673
00:57:39,346 --> 00:57:41,168
Get out of here, you stupid...

674
00:57:41,234 --> 00:57:43,306
Will you stop?

675
00:57:44,689 --> 00:57:47,984
You can'tjust bust in on a guy
like that. That's really rude.

676
00:57:49,073 --> 00:57:51,528
She doesn't understand the licking.

677
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,901
You a knucklehead?
You brought another one?

678
00:57:53,968 --> 00:57:55,943
- Excuse me.
- Hey. Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

679
00:57:56,016 --> 00:57:58,350
Back off, Joe, OK?
Don't push me!

680
00:57:58,416 --> 00:57:59,877
No, no, no, that's no good.

681
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:01,412
Put it on my tab.
We gotta go.

682
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:03,909
Friends from out of town.
Come on, sweetheart.

683
00:58:03,982 --> 00:58:05,738
- Give me your number.
- Two Delta.

684
00:58:05,806 --> 00:58:08,391
Hey, look. Get...
Don't test me.

685
00:58:08,462 --> 00:58:10,350
Don't.

686
00:58:21,676 --> 00:58:24,294
Well, this is nice.

687
00:58:27,019 --> 00:58:29,801
Mac doesn't talk much
about his work at the Institute.

688
00:58:29,867 --> 00:58:32,169
Do y'all work with him?

689
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,161
Saving lives and all
must be real rewarding.

690
00:58:36,235 --> 00:58:38,536
Those are fancy tracksuits.

691
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:42,180
Y'all exercise out in this heat,
gonna get yourself nasty heatstroke.

692
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:46,594
Oh, Mac, look.
They got matching bracelets.

693
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:50,472
- We should do that, honey.
- Suzie...

694
00:58:50,537 --> 00:58:53,536
Do you remember the talk
we had about all the talk?

695
00:58:54,793 --> 00:58:55,905
Yeah.

696
00:58:55,976 --> 00:58:59,205
Actually, would you run down to Red's
and pick us up a sixer of Bud?

697
00:58:59,272 --> 00:59:02,468
- We've got to talk shop.
- OK, baby.

698
00:59:02,535 --> 00:59:04,771
- Just making friends.
- I know. Good. Just...

699
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:06,049
Bye.

700
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:13,508
Why do they lie, Mac?

701
00:59:13,574 --> 00:59:16,127
Why do they lie to us? Tell me.

702
00:59:19,525 --> 00:59:21,565
To keep you
from knowing what you are.

703
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:25,820
- What we are?
- What are we?

704
00:59:25,892 --> 00:59:29,754
Man, why do I gotta be the guy
tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?

705
00:59:33,827 --> 00:59:35,998
OK, look. You're...

706
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:40,477
Well, you're not like me.

707
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:45,276
I mean, you're not... human.

708
00:59:46,658 --> 00:59:50,651
I mean, you're human,
but you just, you're not real.

709
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,462
You're not,
like, a real person. Like me.

710
00:59:57,504 --> 00:59:59,740
You're clones.

711
01:00:01,696 --> 01:00:05,372
You're copies of people
out here in the world.

712
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:06,999
- What?
- Clones?

713
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:09,176
- What? Why?
- What are you talking about?

714
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:12,476
Some hag trophy wife
needs new skin for a facelift

715
01:00:12,543 --> 01:00:14,615
or one of 'em gets sick
and need a new part,

716
01:00:14,686 --> 01:00:16,922
they take it from you.

717
01:00:18,526 --> 01:00:21,624
But I have a mother.
I remember her.

718
01:00:21,725 --> 01:00:23,700
- Yeah, I know.
- I grew up on a farm.

719
01:00:23,805 --> 01:00:25,747
I have a little dog and I had a bike.

720
01:00:25,853 --> 01:00:27,314
And a bike. Right.

721
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:30,682
It was a pink Flexi-Flyer
with little tassels on the handlebars

722
01:00:30,748 --> 01:00:32,853
and you rode it
to your grandmother's.

723
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:36,055
You ring the little bell and she
came out and served you cookies.

724
01:00:36,124 --> 01:00:37,400
Yeah.

725
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,493
No. Memory imprints.
I seen them.

726
01:00:41,563 --> 01:00:44,628
A buddy of mine is a programmer
at the Institute. He showed me.

727
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:48,146
There's only 12 stories.
They change around little details,

728
01:00:48,218 --> 01:00:50,356
but they're all pretty much the same.

729
01:00:50,426 --> 01:00:55,641
The life you think you had
before the "contamination,"

730
01:00:55,705 --> 01:00:58,039
it never happened.

731
01:00:59,257 --> 01:01:02,737
Come on, don't look at me like that.
At least you had a bike.

732
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:06,801
Wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood, be my guest.

733
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,365
How long?

734
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:10,992
How long have we been alive?

735
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:14,933
You're Echo generation,
so you're three.

736
01:01:16,534 --> 01:01:17,996
Delta means you're four.

737
01:01:20,406 --> 01:01:21,583
Three?

738
01:01:21,654 --> 01:01:25,450
The whole reason you exist is
'cause everyone wants to live forever.

739
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,313
It's the new American dream.

740
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:30,729
There's people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it.

741
01:01:30,837 --> 01:01:34,185
Don't people care that they kill us?
That they take parts from us?

742
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,351
They don't know. They think you're
vegetables simmering in a jelly sack.

743
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,762
Why do you think Merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground?

744
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:46,412
He doesn't want anybody knowing
the truth, especially not sponsors.

745
01:01:46,482 --> 01:01:50,192
- Sponsors?
- The people that had you made.

746
01:01:50,258 --> 01:01:52,330
They, like, own you.

747
01:01:54,322 --> 01:01:59,984
But why doesn't Merrick want
our owners to know that we're alive?

748
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:04,588
Just because people wanna eat the burger
doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.

749
01:02:05,457 --> 01:02:09,002
Besides, do you know
how many laws Merrick's breaking

750
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:11,210
to have you two hatched?

751
01:02:12,943 --> 01:02:15,114
Your sponsors
can't have any part of that.

752
01:02:15,183 --> 01:02:17,484
They're like high society,
rich and famous.

753
01:02:17,551 --> 01:02:19,972
If they knew,
Merrick would be out of business.

754
01:02:20,047 --> 01:02:22,567
We have to find our sponsors
and tell them the truth.

755
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:23,947
- What?
- Yeah.

756
01:02:24,014 --> 01:02:26,021
No, that's the worst idea I ever heard.

757
01:02:26,094 --> 01:02:28,482
You know how dead I'd be?
Not to mention fired?

758
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:30,826
We will. We will.
That's our only chance.

759
01:02:30,893 --> 01:02:33,740
Stop, stop! Fold, stop.
Brakes. No. Come on.

760
01:02:33,804 --> 01:02:36,422
You're the replacement engines
on their Bentley.

761
01:02:36,492 --> 01:02:39,656
They're not gonna care.
What? They're gonna care?

762
01:02:39,724 --> 01:02:41,000
You know what I would do?

763
01:02:41,068 --> 01:02:44,297
I would just get as far away
from here as I could.

764
01:02:44,363 --> 01:02:45,540
Go to the beach.

765
01:02:45,611 --> 01:02:48,644
We're not asking
for your permission, Mac.

766
01:02:48,714 --> 01:02:50,569
We're asking for your help.

767
01:02:52,075 --> 01:02:53,830
Oh, God.

768
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:06,110
Infrared's having a hard time picking up
a heat signature. Sand's too hot.

769
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,672
He was implanted
with micro-sensors yesterday.

770
01:03:12,744 --> 01:03:16,453
Can we configure our instrument
to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?

771
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:19,683
- If we can get within half a mile.
- Do it.

772
01:03:19,751 --> 01:03:22,434
Your sponsors names
are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.

773
01:03:22,503 --> 01:03:24,096
Her sponsor lives in New York.

774
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:27,068
The number in your name
is a regional code.

775
01:03:27,142 --> 01:03:31,266
Six Echo, that means
your sponsor lives in LA.

776
01:03:31,365 --> 01:03:33,405
- You're going out of state.
- Out of state?

777
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:34,938
Put this on.

778
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:37,914
You're gonna go in here.
All right? Come on, come on.

779
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,638
Keep going. What size?

780
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:42,915
All right.

781
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:45,052
These are bags, OK?
You put stuff in 'em.

782
01:03:45,124 --> 01:03:47,774
Backpacks for boys, purses for girls.
Understand?

783
01:03:47,843 --> 01:03:49,272
We're not idiots.

784
01:03:49,347 --> 01:03:52,663
Excuse me, Miss "I'm so smart
I can't wait to go to the Island."

785
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:58,072
Yeah. Good.

786
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,380
Wait. Hold, hold, hold.

787
01:04:04,482 --> 01:04:06,848
People don't really
wear these on the outside.

788
01:04:06,945 --> 01:04:09,400
These are mail-order, OK?
These stay here.

789
01:04:12,192 --> 01:04:15,967
No. Mail-order, OK?
Clones don't wear these.

790
01:04:19,584 --> 01:04:20,827
All right, listen up.

791
01:04:20,895 --> 01:04:23,830
This card is like stim credits, OK?

792
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:26,750
It'll get you food, but I gotta
report it stolen in 24 hours

793
01:04:26,815 --> 01:04:30,743
or else they'll know I helped you.
After that, use the cash.

794
01:04:33,693 --> 01:04:34,740
All right, look.

795
01:04:34,846 --> 01:04:37,715
I know you're new to this
whole human experience and all,

796
01:04:37,821 --> 01:04:39,447
but there's one universal truth

797
01:04:39,548 --> 01:04:42,199
and that is you never
give a woman your credit card.

798
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,849
Right.

799
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:52,213
I got something. It's hot.

800
01:05:02,426 --> 01:05:04,881
Oh, God.

801
01:05:06,618 --> 01:05:09,552
- Train four...
- Trairll be here. Hustle.

802
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:13,040
...to Sacramento
is now boarding at platform A.

803
01:05:13,112 --> 01:05:16,756
All right, stay. All right?
Just stay. Don't move.

804
01:05:17,848 --> 01:05:19,254
Mama!

805
01:05:22,903 --> 01:05:24,790
Look at that!

806
01:05:24,855 --> 01:05:27,026
Those are kids.

807
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,220
Wow.

808
01:05:35,702 --> 01:05:39,018
Come here. The train is non-stop to LA.
You need these to get on.

809
01:05:39,093 --> 01:05:42,606
When you get there, look up your
sponsors in the information directory.

810
01:05:42,677 --> 01:05:44,084
- You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

811
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:47,793
- What is an information directory?
- It'll tell you where they live.

812
01:05:47,892 --> 01:05:50,740
And whatever you do,
do not trust anyone.

813
01:05:50,804 --> 01:05:54,731
One thing I can tell you about people,
is that they'll do anything to survive.

814
01:05:54,803 --> 01:05:56,691
Thank you, Mac. Thank you.

815
01:05:57,555 --> 01:05:59,377
Thanks a lot.

816
01:05:59,443 --> 01:06:02,857
All right. I'm just gonna go upstairs
and get you guys a map of LA.

817
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:05,199
Better not get me in trouble.

818
01:06:15,921 --> 01:06:18,790
Yeah, no problem.
Sure, that's a good one.

819
01:06:25,999 --> 01:06:28,235
I think I got an ID.
Two in the center.

820
01:06:34,254 --> 01:06:36,774
Run!
