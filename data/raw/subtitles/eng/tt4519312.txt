1
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:43,480
- Good morning.
- Hello.

2
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:50,121
Who do we have here?

3
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,925
He belongs to Robert Wade,
the new president of the giant mine.

4
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:57,432
He's just cleared quarantine and he's going
up with the rest of the cargo with you.

5
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:00,332
Okay. Well, you are a beauty?

6
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:03,968
We don't get breeds like this up here.
There you go.

7
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,541
Chinook. That's an interesting name.

8
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:14,046
Okay, I'll bet your family's gonna be glad
to see you. Right, let's get him aboard.

9
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:23,623
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

10
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:27,062
I'm Mandisa. And you must be Ryan?
And you must be Emma.

11
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:29,663
- Yep.
- We've been expecting you.

12
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:33,001
The plane is being loaded
and you will be leaving very soon.

13
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:35,969
- Okay, cool.
- Tell me, how do you find Africa so far?

14
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:38,990
- Well, I haven't seen that much yet.
- I think it's awesome.

15
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,325
Well, come with me.

16
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:48,752
Hey, Kruger.

17
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:54,057
These are the Croft children.
Ryan and Emma.

18
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:58,349
- We're not children.
- Ryan. Don't be rude.

19
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,333
Okay. Mr. Croft, sir,
what say we get your bags on board.

20
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:23,956
There's a giant dog in the back.

21
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:27,294
He's beautiful. He looks like a husky.

22
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:29,495
Actually, he's a Malamute.

23
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:32,432
Cool. Hey, boy, how are you?

24
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:41,108
Kruger.

25
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:49,517
We've had a report come in about possible
rebel activity along the border.

26
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:53,022
Maybe you should delay
the flight until tomorrow.

27
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:56,893
I think we'll be okay. I'll get up there
and then I can steer clear of the border.

28
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:59,878
Okay. Just make sure you keep
constant radio contact.

29
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:02,449
I will do. I'll see you in four hours.

30
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:47,514
- Are you kids ready to see some wildlife?
- Yeah. You bet I am.

31
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:49,782
Yeah, awesome. What will we see?

32
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:53,255
Just sit tight,
Africa always offers a few surprises.

33
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:04,432
- Don't forget clean underwear.
- Yeah, yeah.

34
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:07,579
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, mister. The van's
going to be here in a few minutes.

35
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:10,638
- I'll be ready.
- Clean socks, too?

36
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:12,108
Man.

37
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,545
- Be nice to your sister while you're away.
- Yeah, yeah.

38
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:18,910
What did I just say about
the "yeah, yeahs"?

39
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:25,556
- Hey. How's it going in here?
- Great. I'm almost ready.

40
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,960
Honey, you know you're just
going for the weekend, right?

41
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,894
I know, but I still need a lot of stuff.

42
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:34,331
Okay. Well, hopefully
you can get it all in.

43
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,168
And try to get along with Ryan.

44
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:39,338
He can be such a dweeb, Mom.

45
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:42,341
Hey, come on. None of that kind of talk.

46
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:57,574
Hey, is your name really Kruger?

47
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:01,128
Yes. It's Roger Kruger.
Everyone just calls me Kruger.

48
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:03,931
Cool. Just like in the movies.

49
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:08,289
Cut it out, Ryan. No one wants to hear
about those stupid horror movies.

50
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,938
They're not stupid. I like them.

51
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,407
You also like pro wrestling.

52
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:16,511
Okay, kids, look down
to the right of the plane

53
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:18,531
I'm going to try and come in
a bit lower for you.

54
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:28,058
Oh, my gosh, look at that.

55
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:34,263
Did you know elephants can go through
up to six sets of teeth in their lifetime?

56
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:35,631
I didn't know that.

57
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:39,770
If Ryan doesn't start brushing his teeth
more, he'll need another set of teeth.

58
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,589
Okay, now look down the left
side of the plane. Giraffes.

59
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:02,148
They're so neat! They're amazing-looking.

60
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:04,031
So cool.

61
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,801
And did you know, even a giraffe's
tongue is long? About 21 inches.

62
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:12,540
That's so interesting.
Hey, Ryan, why was the giraffe late?

63
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,908
I don't know.

64
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,812
Because he was caught in a "giraffic" jam.

65
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,836
Lame. So lame.

66
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,696
So you kids are gonna go see your dad?

67
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:36,594
Yeah. He's one of the
vice-presidents at the mine.

68
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:39,903
- Big wheel?
- I guess you could say that.

69
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:43,917
Well, that's the new president's dog
back there so you better be nice to him.

70
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:47,195
- What's his name?
- His tag says Chinook.

71
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,773
I wish we had a dog.

72
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,652
Oh, my gosh, look at the zebras!
There are so many of them.

73
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:11,927
Beautiful creatures?

74
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:16,542
Do you have any facts
to tell us about zebras?

75
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:19,432
Not really. Horses with stripes,
that's about all I know.

76
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:21,716
They're running with their friends,
the wildebeest.

77
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:28,641
Hey. Why don't you tell us
another one of your lame jokes?

78
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:31,726
I don't know any zebra jokes.

79
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,571
Hey, Mr. Kruger, look at that.

80
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,208
Yeah, looks like a bit
of bad weather up ahead.

81
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:48,096
We're gonna have to change
our course slightly just to avoid it.

82
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:57,621
This time of year the weather
can change in a heartbeat.

83
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:22,916
What was that?

84
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:27,496
Mayday! Mayday! This is flight 280...

85
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:31,091
Kruger! Kruger! Come in, please!

86
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:35,260
- What is your position? Over.
- <i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

87
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:39,566
Put your heads between your legs.
Brace for impact.

88
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:44,938
Flight ZS280! Position please!

89
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:52,280
Kruger! Kruger! Come in, please.

90
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,694
What is your position? Over.

91
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,461
Emma! Emma! Wake up, there's a fire.

92
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:19,144
Emma, wake up. There's a fire.

93
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:06,260
Mr. Kruger! Mr. Kruger!

94
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,832
Come on, we need to get you out of here!

95
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:16,480
Okay. Mr. Kruger,
we need to get you out of here.

96
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:20,944
Emma, help!

97
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:35,254
Careful. Careful.

98
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:01,011
Ryan.

99
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:04,128
Ryan, the dog.

100
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:17,040
Emma, catch these packs!

101
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,123
Come on, we gotta get you out of here!

102
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,130
Come on!

103
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:41,758
Go. Come, go.

104
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,116
Ryan.

105
00:11:58,316 --> 00:11:59,983
Ryan.

106
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:03,459
- Ryan? Ryan!
- I'm okay.

107
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:05,559
Ryan.

108
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,098
- I'm okay.
- What happened?

109
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,504
I heard a loud explosion
and we were crashing.

110
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:18,950
We need to check on Mr. Kruger.

111
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,215
Mr. Kruger, are you okay?

112
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:29,684
My head. My leg. I'm in
a great deal of pain.

113
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:32,221
Mr. Kruger, what should we do?

114
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:36,292
Quickly make a fire from
the burning debris before it goes out.

115
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:39,298
Gather wood and sticks. Hurry.

116
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:09,695
Good. Good boy. You must
keep the fire going.

117
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:13,567
It's the only way to fend off lions.
They'll come tonight.

118
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:17,250
Lions? Ryan, he said lions.

119
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,441
Mr. Kruger, when will
the searchers come for us?

120
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,845
I have no idea.
I tried to send out a mayday...

121
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:31,787
- What should we do?
- Keep the fire going, like he said.

122
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,386
And see what's in the packs
and stuff I threw out.

123
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:37,325
I'll find more wood.

124
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:40,463
Okay. But don't go too far.

125
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:44,500
- We have no idea what's out there.
- Don't forget we have Chinook.

126
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:49,774
Yeah. He looks like he'd be
pretty good in a fight.

127
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:10,380
- I'm Jennifer Croft. Are you Mandisa?
- Yes, ma'am. Please take a seat.

128
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,432
No, I can't sit. So what's the latest?

129
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:16,634
As I told you on the phone,

130
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:19,505
we think the plane went down
somewhere close to this area,

131
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:22,076
based on the last radar coordinates.

132
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:26,612
Okay, so what do we do? Has a helicopter
or a plane been sent out there?

133
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:29,242
The civil defense authorities
will be here soon.

134
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:32,332
They'll take over the search operation.

135
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:33,855
Oh, my God.

136
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:36,456
Did you manage to speak to your husband?

137
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:39,511
Yes, he was getting on the plane
to head down here.

138
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:46,168
- More cans.
- What's in that one?

139
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:50,572
- Cave-i-ar.
- I think it's caviar.

140
00:14:57,612 --> 00:15:00,032
That's gross, it smells!

141
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,269
Here, Chinook, you eat it.

142
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:12,378
- Well, at least he likes it.
- Yeah. He can have it all.

143
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:16,973
Now here's something I can eat...

144
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,905
beans.

145
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:23,641
I hope you have a can opener.

146
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:26,479
It's not that hard to get into a tin can.

147
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,334
Okay, so what else do we have?
Is there anymore water?

148
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:34,304
Well, I guess we have
whatever we put in the packs.

149
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:39,892
That's okay. There should be a stream
near here or it will rain soon.

150
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:44,599
Yeah. We won't be here long.
They're coming for us.

151
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:49,268
I hope so.
How will they know where to find us?

152
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:54,009
They use computers and satellites
and stuff to find lost planes these days.

153
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:56,178
I've seen it on TV.

154
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:58,815
I think we should give Mr.
Kruger some water.

155
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,949
Yeah, I'll do it.

156
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,667
He's hurt so badly, Ryan.

157
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,967
I don't know much about
first aid, you know.

158
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:23,308
Well, I know we have to get
these wounds cleaned and bandaged.

159
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:25,877
Otherwise, he's going to get an infection.

160
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,550
We need a clean cloth
or something like that.

161
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,426
All I have is this spare T-shirt.

162
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,017
That'll work.

163
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:47,485
You tear it up into strips
and I'll wash out this wound.

164
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:54,640
Okay, here we go.

165
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:17,681
Help me lift his head.

166
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:42,007
It looks really good.
You know, you could be a nurse.

167
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:46,599
Well, I hope it works. It seems to
have stopped the bleeding at least.

168
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,975
Colonel Ibori, welcome.

169
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:13,393
This is Jennifer Croft,
the mother of the two children.

170
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:17,432
Yes, Mrs. Croft. So sorry to be
meeting under these circumstances.

171
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:19,534
Please be assured the
Civil Defense Authority

172
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:21,870
is conducting a complete
search of the area.

173
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,905
That's wonderful news.
Thank you, Colonel Ibori.

174
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:26,843
How long before you think
you find the plane?

175
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,814
Mrs. Croft. We're not receiving
a signal from the ELT.

176
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:34,851
- The ELT, what is that?
- It's the Emergency Locator Transmitter.

177
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:39,642
It sends out a signal upon impact so we
can locate a downed plane by satellite.

178
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:42,191
Okay, so why are we not getting a signal?

179
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:46,496
Well, when an ELT is destroyed
or burnt up on impact,

180
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:49,233
then there's no signal.

181
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,855
Oh, my God.

182
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:19,274
- I got here as quick as I could.
- Mr. Croft...

183
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:22,669
I'm Colonel Ibori
of the Civil Defense Authority.

184
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,525
We've set up camp about 3 miles from here.
Please come with me and I'll brief you.

185
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,047
- Please.
- All right. Thank you.

186
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:35,751
I'm so scared.

187
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,457
What if a lion comes tonight?

188
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:46,428
Mr. Kruger said the fire
would keep them away.

189
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:47,964
What are you doing?

190
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:51,635
Making a torch,
just like they do in the movies.

191
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:54,170
We might need it.

192
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,607
Thought you said they'd be here by now.

193
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:59,474
Well, I'm sure they'll be here
in the morning.

194
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,915
What was that?

195
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:07,937
Lions. Ryan, lions.

196
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:11,326
Quick, the torch. Yours is there. Light it!

197
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:23,170
It's coming, Ryan, it's coming.

198
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:28,042
It's over there!

199
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:43,192
It's a tortoise.

200
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:49,265
Oh, my gosh. I was so scared.

201
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:52,501
It's kind of cool-looking, anyways.

202
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,921
It is kind of cute.

203
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:09,158
If that tortoise is all we're going to have
to deal with tonight, I will be very happy.

204
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:13,258
I can't spend another hour out here.

205
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,914
Let alone the entire night.

206
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:19,030
Search plane should see
our fire any moment.

207
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,132
I'm so scared.

208
00:21:26,571 --> 00:21:29,540
Colonel Ibori, our children
can't spend the night out there.

209
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,911
- We've got to find them, right away!
- Calm down, Mrs. Croft.

210
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:37,050
Search and Rescue work at night is
dangerous. From the air and the ground.

211
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,736
So we're just going to sit around here?

212
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:42,990
Mr. Croft. Roger Kruger is an expert
on surviving in the bush.

213
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,292
- The children are in good hands with him.
- And that's provided he survived the...

214
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:51,621
At dawn, we have a huge number
of aircraft and ground personnel

215
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:53,802
searching the entire area.

216
00:21:53,902 --> 00:21:56,404
Okay. Great. Well...

217
00:21:56,504 --> 00:21:58,809
let's just hope we find
them in the morning.

218
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,913
Jennifer, Robin Wade's dog,
Chinook, was on that plane.

219
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:06,311
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

220
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:10,770
Well, Robert says he's a big dog.
He's very protective of children.

221
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,738
Mrs. Croft, if the children have a big dog
with them that's a good thing.

222
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:17,625
Many of our local tribes
use dogs for protection.

223
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:22,098
They protect livestock, people,
they're even used for hunting lions.

224
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:24,952
And food, water? What if they're hurt?

225
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,538
It's a supply plane for
the mine, Mrs. Croft.

226
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:31,577
It should have enough supplies
on it to last until we find them.

227
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:10,336
Mr. Kruger. Mr. Kruger.

228
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:15,508
Emma, wake up. Emma! Emma!

229
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:20,321
Mr. Kruger, he won't wake up.

230
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:23,333
Did you give him some water?

231
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,468
Yeah, okay.

232
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,990
Not too much.

233
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,113
Mr. Kruger.

234
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:40,810
Mr. Kruger!

235
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,154
He's hurt real bad, Emma.

236
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:46,658
I tried my best to help him.
He needs to be in a hospital.

237
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,999
I know, Emma. I know.

238
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:51,597
You did a great job fixing his head wound.

239
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:55,253
What are going to do? He could die.

240
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:59,238
You know what? We're not that
far away from the giant mine.

241
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,875
I could hike there.

242
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,296
- I don't know, Ryan.
- We've got to find help right away.

243
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:09,344
I bet I could be there
in a couple of hours.

244
00:24:09,444 --> 00:24:11,519
I'm not staying here by myself.

245
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:13,822
Well, then we'll go together.

246
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:16,392
We won't be long anyways.

247
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:20,346
We'll leave a bottle of water
for Mr. Kruger in case he wakes up.

248
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:24,734
Okay. As long as you're sure
we're not that far from the mine.

249
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:29,242
We can't be. We flew for so long.
It has to be just up ahead.

250
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:32,075
- Really?
- Yeah.

251
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:34,743
Mum and Dad must be worried sick about us.

252
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:38,515
Well, we'll get to the mine
and they'll tell them we're okay.

253
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:41,454
- It shouldn't be that far away.
- Okay.

254
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:43,788
As long as you're sure.

255
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:58,702
- Come on, Chinook. Come on.
- Come on.

256
00:25:06,145 --> 00:25:09,185
- Mr. and Mrs. Croft, good morning.
- Morning. Colonel, do you have any news?

257
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,187
We have launched 15 different aircraft to
search the area, helicopters and airplanes.

258
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:16,044
Well, that's great news.

259
00:25:16,144 --> 00:25:19,561
Robert Wade is putting all the resources
of the mine into the search.

260
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:23,998
We also have a number of teams
searching on the ground in vehicles.

261
00:25:24,098 --> 00:25:26,100
Yeah, if only we had an ELT signal.

262
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,160
Yes, Mr. Croft, that would be
wonderful, but we don't,

263
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,307
so there's no point
in concerning ourselves with it.

264
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:35,711
Emma and Ryan must be
scared to death right now.

265
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:38,414
We're going to find them.

266
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:41,176
You and I both know how smart they are.

267
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:44,921
I'm just so scared.

268
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,792
I can't stand the thought
of losing both our children.

269
00:25:47,892 --> 00:25:49,784
I know.

270
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,009
- This way.
- Chinook, let's go, come on.

271
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:17,071
Oh, my gosh, Ryan, it's so hot.

272
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:20,079
- I'm boiling.
- Yeah, I know. Let's take a little drink.

273
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:26,733
Not too much! Not too much!

274
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:31,373
- I hardly had any.
- Well, it has to last. Give me some.

275
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:37,778
What are you doing?

276
00:26:37,878 --> 00:26:40,516
I'm keeping it. I don't trust you.

277
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:42,217
What about Chinook?

278
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:45,888
Well... you said the mine
can't be that much further,

279
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:49,190
he'll be okay 'til we get there. Right?

280
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,380
- I'm sure it isn't. Come on.
- Wait. Do you hear that?

281
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:57,233
- Hear what?
- Listen.

282
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:05,190
- Where is he going?
- Chinook, wait!

283
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,434
Hey, it's an elephant!

284
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,597
We have to help him.

285
00:27:25,097 --> 00:27:27,466
Yeah, come on.

286
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:03,082
Here he comes.

287
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:17,821
- He sure is cute.
- And very friendly.

288
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:20,090
What shall we name him?

289
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,893
Name him? He's not our pet.

290
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,494
He thinks he is.

291
00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:28,633
Oh, my goodness,
first a dog, now an elephant.

292
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:31,304
What will travel with us next, a baboon?

293
00:28:31,404 --> 00:28:33,995
Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

294
00:28:34,406 --> 00:28:38,461
- I'm so thirsty, I'm dying here.
- Okay, just a bit.

295
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:45,685
He must be so thirsty.
Who knows when he drank last?

296
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:48,523
We're not giving him our
last drop of water.

297
00:28:49,623 --> 00:28:52,511
The mine can't be far.
It should be just over that hill.

298
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,346
I hope you're right.

299
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:58,432
Besides we still have to name him.
I think we should call him Rumba.

300
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:01,803
Rumba? Where did that come from?

301
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:05,759
I don't know.
It just popped in my head. Weird.

302
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:09,445
Maybe it's 'cause one of my friends
back home dances the Rhumba.

303
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:13,517
All right, then Rumba. It's actually
a pretty good elephant's name.

304
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:15,469
But it doesn't mean we're keeping him.

305
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:22,259
I know. I know. I just wish he was ours.

306
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:28,497
Well, he lives in the African wild,
this is his home.

307
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:32,170
- Okay. Bye, Rumba.
- Bye.

308
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:58,164
Ryan, it looks like Rumba's following us.

309
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,579
Oh, boy...

310
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:03,904
this is just like why they say
never let a stray cat in.

311
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:09,060
Well, he thinks we're his new family.
What should we do?

312
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,725
I don't know.

313
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,520
Emma, look at this.
Looks like some sort of trail.

314
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,422
We must be getting close
to a village now or something.

315
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:22,290
Let's follow it.

316
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,527
We still have to find Chinook.
Where did he go?

317
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:27,489
Chinook!

318
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:30,153
Chinook!

319
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,304
Attaboy.

320
00:32:02,743 --> 00:32:04,796
Come on, Chinook.

321
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:19,752
Well, this looks like a good place to camp.

322
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:21,488
What?

323
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:24,666
I'm starving.
We should get a fire going and eat.

324
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:29,250
Camp? What do you mean camp?
I thought you said the mine was close by.

325
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:33,901
Well, maybe we'll have to spend
another night out here.

326
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:38,406
What? No way. No way. The lions
will get us. What about Mr. Kruger?

327
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:41,076
Maybe they found him by now.

328
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:44,747
What? If they did
they would have found us too.

329
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:48,028
I can't believe I ever let you
talk me into leaving the plane.

330
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:52,222
Well, I don't know.

331
00:32:52,322 --> 00:32:55,005
It made perfect sense
that the mine was close by.

332
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:03,334
That's it. I'm making the decisions
from now on. You're fired.

333
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:06,516
- Yeah, right.
- Seriously.

334
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:09,474
I can't spend another night out here.

335
00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:11,176
Well, it's not my fault.

336
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:15,314
I thought we would either have been
found by now or found the mine.

337
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:19,552
Now things are worse, Ryan, way worse.

338
00:33:53,621 --> 00:33:55,256
What are you doing?

339
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:57,937
Trying to get a fire started.
What's it look like?

340
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:05,435
Do you still have that
bug kit Dad gave you?

341
00:34:05,535 --> 00:34:08,372
- Yeah. Why?
- Can I see it?

342
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:57,724
Look, fire. The sticks, get the sticks.

343
00:34:57,824 --> 00:35:00,025
I don't believe this.

344
00:35:00,669 --> 00:35:02,958
We need to get bigger pieces.

345
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:13,178
There's one thing that we will never run
out of around here. Which is dry wood.

346
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:15,613
Time for some beans.

347
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:22,052
I hope you brought a pot.
And how are you going to open that?

348
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:25,155
Easy... just smash it on a rock.

349
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:40,877
That's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

350
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:44,944
Yeah, yeah, very funny. Hilarious.

351
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:48,778
Rumba's leaving.

352
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:52,668
We can't keep him.
Maybe he's going back to his family.

353
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,121
Rumba, don't go.

354
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:59,627
Yeah, maybe. I just wish he could stay.

355
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:14,943
- Anything?
- I am sorry, Mr. Croft, not a trace.

356
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:18,814
How can that be? The
plane can't just vanish.

357
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:22,451
Mr. Croft, it's a huge
wilderness out there.

358
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:24,387
The vegetation is very thick in some areas.

359
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:27,586
Our pilots could have flown over it
several times without noticing it.

360
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,493
What about the ground searchers?

361
00:36:29,593 --> 00:36:32,968
We have teams out carefully searching
in a grid pattern, Mrs. Croft.

362
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:36,929
Most of them have agreed
to camp out in the bush at night,

363
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,802
at great personal risk.

364
00:36:38,902 --> 00:36:43,508
Pers... personal risk?
What do you mean personal risk? Lions?

365
00:36:44,108 --> 00:36:48,007
Yes, Mrs. Croft,
that is a concern, I'm afraid.

366
00:36:49,613 --> 00:36:52,383
Oh, my God, Paul, we might never find them.

367
00:36:52,483 --> 00:36:54,069
Hopefully, they've started a fire.

368
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:57,870
Most wild animals will avoid contact
with humans if there's a fire.

369
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,053
Our kids have only been camping with us
a few times. They're not survivalists.

370
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:05,416
I appreciate that, Mrs. Croft.
We're doing the best we can.

371
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:10,371
As I've said, Roger Kruger will know
what to do in a situation like this.

372
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:16,477
Here, you do a couple.

373
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:18,580
We might need them.

374
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:26,521
I don't think there's a creepier place
to have to spend the night.

375
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:28,858
Maybe nothing will come.

376
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:33,911
Maybe the fire will keep the animals away.

377
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:37,618
And we won't have to worry.

378
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:47,043
Plus, we have Chinook.

379
00:37:52,883 --> 00:37:56,219
- Who wants to toast a marshmallow?
- Me.

380
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,026
So what happened to super fishermen today?

381
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,535
I thought you boys were supposed
to be bringing home dinner.

382
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,261
Yeah, they just weren't biting.

383
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:07,165
More like you just couldn't catch one.

384
00:38:07,265 --> 00:38:11,770
- Yeah, I'd like to see you try.
- Ryan, we'll try again tomorrow.

385
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:15,910
I've got some great tips on the best place
for bass from the guy two RVs down.

386
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,111
All right, as long as you boys
aren't out all day.

387
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:21,081
This is supposed to be
a family vacation, remember?

388
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:24,151
Maybe we should also get
the address of a good restaurant.

389
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,955
Nice one, Emma.

390
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:31,560
We'll see about that tomorrow.

391
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,583
What was that?

392
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:41,402
It could be another tortoise.

393
00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:46,374
What was that? Something's out there.

394
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,944
Light the torches. Hurry.

395
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:56,085
They're everywhere. What are they?

396
00:38:56,185 --> 00:38:57,969
Hyena!

397
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:02,809
Get away.

398
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:18,366
Emma, the bushes!

399
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:20,980
Set the bushes on fire,
it's our only chance.

400
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:44,438
Ryan, we're in so much trouble.

401
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,718
We're going to die out here.

402
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:50,346
- We chased them off.
- They'll come back!

403
00:39:50,446 --> 00:39:53,515
And no one will ever know
what happened to us.

404
00:39:54,215 --> 00:39:56,118
They'll eat us.

405
00:39:57,873 --> 00:40:00,368
Please, don't cry, Emma.

406
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,896
I'll stay up and keep the fire going.

407
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:09,797
- And you can sleep for a while.
- Sleep?

408
00:40:10,397 --> 00:40:12,936
I don't think I'm ever
going to sleep again.

409
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,528
I'm going to have nightmares
for the rest of my life.

410
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:21,446
- I guess we'll stay up together.
- I don't get it.

411
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:25,784
You watch horror movies all the time
and you still manage to sleep.

412
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:27,987
How do you do it?

413
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:31,408
- Aren't you scared?
- Of course I am.

414
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:36,162
I wish we were with Mom
and Dad right now too.

415
00:40:37,261 --> 00:40:38,923
But...

416
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:43,088
they'd want us to keep it together.
Until we're found.

417
00:40:44,438 --> 00:40:46,307
We have to.

418
00:41:12,354 --> 00:41:13,996
Emma!

419
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:18,590
- Emma, why did you run off on me?
- I didn't run off, I've been right here.

420
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,461
It's dangerous. We need to stick together.

421
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:24,414
- I had Chinook.
- What about me?

422
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:27,849
Dear, Ryan Croft, soccer star,
can't look after himself.

423
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,873
- I just about got eaten by a giant chicken.
- A giant chicken?

424
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:35,543
Yes. A giant chicken walked
into the camp and pecked me.

425
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:39,897
- You mean an ostrich, perhaps?
- Whatever. It was huge.

426
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,703
We could have made two thousand chicken
fingers out of it. Now we need to keep going.

427
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:47,675
- Go where?
- The mine. It's just over that ridge.

428
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:50,877
No, not this again. I'm staying right here.

429
00:41:50,977 --> 00:41:55,386
We can't stay here, it's dangerous.
We don't know what's going to come tonight.

430
00:41:55,486 --> 00:41:58,686
And do you really want to go through
another night like last night?

431
00:41:58,786 --> 00:42:00,909
- No.
- Exactly.

432
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:03,624
So let's fill the water bottle and go.

433
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:08,931
Come on, Chinook, his highness
has spoken, we're leaving now.

434
00:42:43,901 --> 00:42:45,672
Oh, my gosh, it's hot.

435
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,972
See, I told you we should
have stayed at the water hole.

436
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:51,210
Be quiet! We've been through this.

437
00:43:10,331 --> 00:43:13,368
- Ryan, do you hear that?
- Hear what?

438
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:16,836
Ryan, look.

439
00:43:17,738 --> 00:43:19,573
What is that?

440
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:23,778
Run!

441
00:44:09,694 --> 00:44:11,428
Croft!

442
00:44:15,301 --> 00:44:19,039
- News, Colonel Ibori?
- Mr. and Mrs. Croft...

443
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:22,476
I've received a radio message
from one of the outer villages.

444
00:44:22,976 --> 00:44:28,158
A hunting party of bushmen
have found the plane and the pilot.

445
00:44:28,258 --> 00:44:30,985
That's great news. And our children?

446
00:44:31,285 --> 00:44:34,588
I'm sorry to report
the children were not there.

447
00:44:34,688 --> 00:44:37,826
Not... what do you mean not there?
Where are they?

448
00:44:38,326 --> 00:44:41,582
At this stage, Mrs. Croft, we have no idea.

449
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:46,425
The pilot is suffering from extreme
dehydration and heat stroke.

450
00:44:46,525 --> 00:44:50,107
- He doesn't know where the children are.
- So what do we do now?

451
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:52,964
We continue to search until we find them.

452
00:44:55,144 --> 00:44:57,914
I am afraid I have some rather bad news.

453
00:44:58,014 --> 00:44:59,616
What?

454
00:45:01,284 --> 00:45:04,020
The plane was found...

455
00:45:05,924 --> 00:45:07,592
here.

456
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:11,996
The pilot went off course by many miles
and went too close to the border.

457
00:45:12,096 --> 00:45:14,900
We have numerous reports
of rebel activity along the border.

458
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,037
Okay. What does all this mean?

459
00:45:18,137 --> 00:45:21,522
Well, I can't order my helicopters
and ground crews close to that area,

460
00:45:21,622 --> 00:45:22,784
it's far too dangerous.

461
00:45:22,884 --> 00:45:25,511
So you're going to leave
our children out there?

462
00:45:25,611 --> 00:45:26,997
We might not have much time.

463
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:31,885
Mrs. Croft, the children could have
wandered off in any direction.

464
00:45:32,185 --> 00:45:34,855
If they've gone across the border...

465
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:40,460
Well, that's great. That's just great!

466
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,023
Jennifer!

467
00:45:45,066 --> 00:45:46,301
Hey, Jennifer.

468
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:48,836
We have to do something.
We've got to do something now.

469
00:45:48,936 --> 00:45:52,808
I know. I know. I just feel helpless.

470
00:45:53,892 --> 00:45:56,595
All right, what about Robert,
your boss, what is he doing?

471
00:45:56,695 --> 00:45:58,514
Yeah, I talked to him this morning,

472
00:45:58,614 --> 00:46:01,952
he said the company's doing
everything that they can on their end.

473
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:03,520
What's that even mean?

474
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,123
Well, mainly flying over
the possible crash zones.

475
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:11,095
Now that we've found the wreckage,
that will narrow the search area.

476
00:46:11,195 --> 00:46:13,716
Okay, I'm sorry. I don't...

477
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:17,396
I don't want to sound like I'm blaming you
or the company or anybody, I'm just...

478
00:46:17,496 --> 00:46:20,728
I'm so angry and frustrated and scared...

479
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:24,472
So am I, Jen, so am I.

480
00:46:29,714 --> 00:46:32,684
What do we do now? Chinook is gone.

481
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:38,555
Chinook!

482
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:45,954
Chinook!

483
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:54,109
- Chinook!
- Forget it.

484
00:46:55,276 --> 00:46:58,287
He was trampled and we
didn't even help him.

485
00:47:00,248 --> 00:47:02,152
Come on, we can't just stay here.

486
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,091
What are we going to do now, Ryan?

487
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:12,730
We have to keep going
and get over that ridge.

488
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:51,690
That's just great! Just great!

489
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,708
What are we supposed to do now?

490
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:57,530
I can't believe this! Like...

491
00:49:57,042 --> 00:49:59,978
I'm so tired, Ryan,
I can't go on anymore today.

492
00:50:00,078 --> 00:50:01,748
Yeah.

493
00:50:06,051 --> 00:50:08,655
Mom and Dad must be worried sick about us.

494
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,523
How come we haven't seen
a plane or anything?

495
00:50:11,623 --> 00:50:14,762
I don't know, I guess they must
be looking in the wrong spot.

496
00:50:14,862 --> 00:50:17,998
Poor Chinook. I can't believe he's gone.

497
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,434
- Me neither.
- It's okay to cry, you know, Ryan.

498
00:50:21,534 --> 00:50:24,506
You don't have to be all boy out here,
none of your friends are around.

499
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:26,173
Yeah, I know.

500
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,843
I'm so hungry. We need
a fire and some beans.

501
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:31,278
Okay. I'll go find some wood.

502
00:50:39,689 --> 00:50:43,291
Yeah, wow, is right. Look at all the stars.

503
00:50:47,564 --> 00:50:50,334
That's what we've been
missing as city kids.

504
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:55,140
- You know, I have an idea.
- What?

505
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,022
That's where we're going to
spend the night, the tree.

506
00:51:00,112 --> 00:51:01,945
Sleep up there?

507
00:51:02,045 --> 00:51:05,450
Yeah, well, it's safer
than being on the ground.

508
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,653
Birds do it, why can't we?

509
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:11,691
Yeah. That's the best
idea you've had so far.

510
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,687
- Hey, you can lie down.
- Okay, I'll try.

511
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:51,901
- Comfy.
- Really?

512
00:51:52,001 --> 00:51:56,038
No, not at all. Do I ever miss my bed.

513
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,720
I want to try sleeping like a cat.

514
00:52:04,214 --> 00:52:06,583
- Ryan?
- Yeah?

515
00:52:06,683 --> 00:52:08,919
Can lions climb trees?

516
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:12,323
Well, I don't think so.

517
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:14,826
That's reassuring.

518
00:52:15,226 --> 00:52:18,061
Well, I'm not an expert
on Africa, you know.

519
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:27,039
- Ryan.
- Yeah?

520
00:52:27,939 --> 00:52:31,244
- I have a visitor.
- Really? What?

521
00:52:31,977 --> 00:52:35,283
I don't know, but it's small, furry,

522
00:52:35,383 --> 00:52:37,784
and very funny looking.

523
00:52:39,184 --> 00:52:42,055
Cool. What is that?

524
00:52:42,355 --> 00:52:44,725
I don't know. A monkey of some sort?

525
00:52:44,825 --> 00:52:46,895
Yeah, that thing is cool.

526
00:52:46,995 --> 00:52:50,431
I bet we could make millions selling
those to kids back in the States.

527
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:53,036
I think it's the cutest thing in the world.

528
00:52:54,936 --> 00:52:57,006
I hope it comes back.

529
00:52:57,106 --> 00:53:01,445
Good night. Don't let the furry
tree-dwelling animals bite.

530
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,184
- Ryan?
- Yeah?

531
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:11,219
Thanks for taking such good care
of me and being a good brother.

532
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:13,343
You're welcome, Emma.

533
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:16,528
It's going to be okay, all right?

534
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:21,732
Yeah. I just have to keep
reminding myself that.

535
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,594
It's hard though.

536
00:53:23,694 --> 00:53:26,616
I worry that they'll never find us...

537
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:30,542
and Mom and Dad will never know
what happened to us.

538
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:33,494
Yeah. I've thought of the same thing, Emma.

539
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:36,139
It scares me.

540
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:38,908
But somehow we just need
to keep believing that

541
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:43,289
tomorrow will be the day
that they find us and we'll go home.

542
00:53:43,689 --> 00:53:47,493
Yeah, you're right, Ryan. I'll try.

543
00:54:03,072 --> 00:54:04,711
Ryan!

544
00:54:07,115 --> 00:54:09,517
Is your furry friend back?

545
00:54:10,617 --> 00:54:15,422
No, much bigger. Much, much bigger.

546
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:19,229
- It's a giraffe.
- Really?

547
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,134
That's so awesome.

548
00:54:25,434 --> 00:54:27,438
Emma, watch this.

549
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:47,961
You see that? Do you see that?

550
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:49,212
Yeah.

551
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:04,747
You're like some sort of animal magnet.
They all love you.

552
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:15,090
It's so cool.

553
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,716
I wish Mom and Dad were here to see this.

554
00:55:20,816 --> 00:55:23,156
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

555
00:55:23,256 --> 00:55:25,535
You like that? Did you see that?

556
00:55:25,635 --> 00:55:26,937
Yeah.

557
00:55:35,513 --> 00:55:40,649
- Over there. Over there.
- Over here. Hey... hey, giraffe.

558
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:49,321
No one will ever believe this.

559
00:56:06,578 --> 00:56:09,216
Man, we have to find some water soon.

560
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:12,786
I've never appreciated water
more in my life than now.

561
00:56:14,086 --> 00:56:16,723
There has to be a stream
around here some place.

562
00:56:16,823 --> 00:56:18,792
Let's keep heading the
way we've been going.

563
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:22,094
That way we know that we
aren't walking in circles.

564
00:56:22,194 --> 00:56:25,066
- How do you know we haven't?
- Come on.

565
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,481
Yeah.

566
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:37,213
- Okay, thank you.
- What'd he say?

567
00:56:37,313 --> 00:56:40,783
He said there's very little the US government
can do. It's not their jurisdiction.

568
00:56:40,883 --> 00:56:44,555
He says the embassy will continue to monitor
the situation, whatever that means.

569
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:48,156
Well, surely the US military can help
with extra helicopters or something.

570
00:56:48,256 --> 00:56:51,620
- Governments help each other all the time.
- He said the only way for that to happen

571
00:56:51,644 --> 00:56:54,906
is for the local government
to make a specific request.

572
00:56:55,233 --> 00:56:57,803
This is so frustrating.
We're just helpless.

573
00:56:58,403 --> 00:57:01,706
I haven't given up, yet, Jen,
not by a long shot.

574
00:57:01,806 --> 00:57:05,673
- We have two very smart kids out there.
- We should have found them by now.

575
00:57:06,745 --> 00:57:09,115
We're running out of time, I know it.

576
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,856
We need water, Emma, water.

577
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:19,859
I just drank the last bit.

578
00:57:19,959 --> 00:57:22,382
You did? What about me?

579
00:57:23,362 --> 00:57:25,864
There was only a little tiny drop left.

580
00:57:26,164 --> 00:57:28,436
Well, you should have shared that with me.

581
00:57:28,536 --> 00:57:30,403
I'm sorry.

582
00:57:30,603 --> 00:57:32,860
So hot.

583
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,256
We've gotta find water.

584
00:57:35,356 --> 00:57:38,147
There has to be some around here someplace.

585
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,363
A water hole, at least.

586
00:58:42,082 --> 00:58:44,051
<i>Emma.</i>

587
00:58:44,451 --> 00:58:46,121
Mom?

588
00:58:46,521 --> 00:58:49,925
<i>Emma. Emma.</i>

589
00:58:50,725 --> 00:58:52,394
Mom?

590
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:03,484
Check that out. Clear
beautiful, rain water.

591
01:00:04,404 --> 01:00:08,043
I'm so glad you did that.
You're a good smart brother.

592
01:00:08,643 --> 01:00:11,447
- Thank you.
- We almost died, Ryan.

593
01:00:11,547 --> 01:00:15,685
But, you know what?
I was calm. I wasn't afraid.

594
01:00:17,587 --> 01:00:22,176
- Mom came to me.
- Mom? Mom was here?

595
01:00:23,026 --> 01:00:27,732
Yeah. Yeah, I saw her.
She called out to me.

596
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:31,002
Then the rain came.

597
01:00:31,102 --> 01:00:33,305
What are you talking about?

598
01:00:33,405 --> 01:00:35,432
I'm not sure...

599
01:00:36,368 --> 01:00:38,321
but I saw her.

600
01:00:39,343 --> 01:00:41,814
I think your brain's playing tricks on you.

601
01:00:42,214 --> 01:00:44,112
Yeah, maybe.

602
01:00:44,797 --> 01:00:46,607
Maybe not.

603
01:00:46,951 --> 01:00:48,753
Come on.

604
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,132
Ryan.

605
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:32,902
What do we do?

606
01:01:35,438 --> 01:01:36,908
Come on.

607
01:02:42,478 --> 01:02:45,315
- I think it's gone.
- I'm not moving.

608
01:02:45,415 --> 01:02:49,185
- It's gone, Emma.
- Why'd it want to kill us? What did we do?

609
01:02:49,285 --> 01:02:53,454
I don't know.
This one was a lot meaner than Rumba.

610
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:01,941
Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Croft.

611
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:06,237
Colonel Ibori, my wife and I have been
talking, we just can't sit around any longer.

612
01:03:06,337 --> 01:03:08,674
We have to get involved in this search.

613
01:03:08,774 --> 01:03:10,662
I'm sorry, that's against regulations.

614
01:03:10,762 --> 01:03:14,912
We don't care about the rebels.
Okay, we'll take a jeep into the area.

615
01:03:15,012 --> 01:03:17,750
- I cannot allow that.
- All right, how about one of the choppers.

616
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:20,854
- We can go up in one of the choppers.
- I'll give it some thought.

617
01:03:20,954 --> 01:03:25,357
- Typically I wouldn't allow such a thing.
- We can't stand around here doing nothing.

618
01:03:25,557 --> 01:03:29,680
Mrs. Croft... hunters from
several villages have agreed to assist

619
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,451
in the search for your children.
They often track game for days.

620
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:36,550
Right. That's great news.
Thanks, we appreciate it.

621
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:42,010
Now we're going to attempt to reach out to the
rebels and explain the situation to them.

622
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:46,836
They may agree to give my team
safe passage in the disputed zone,

623
01:03:46,936 --> 01:03:50,085
- given the circumstances.
- How long will that take?

624
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:54,292
Mr. Croft, you don't just make a cell
phone call to a rebel commander,

625
01:03:54,392 --> 01:03:58,945
they're not easy people to reach,
but we will try our best.

626
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:06,705
- Ryan, do you hear that?
- What?

627
01:04:06,905 --> 01:04:08,638
Listen.

628
01:04:10,976 --> 01:04:13,812
- Water! Come on.
- Emma.

629
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:48,016
Oh, my gosh.
This is the best water I've ever tasted.

630
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,630
I'll get the water bottle.

631
01:05:31,064 --> 01:05:32,251
Check it out.

632
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,773
Amazing.

633
01:05:39,973 --> 01:05:42,213
Now we have one big problem.

634
01:05:42,843 --> 01:05:44,499
Getting across?

635
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:47,181
- Yeah.
- Let's walk along the bank a bit.

636
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:48,882
Okay.

637
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,321
Well, this is how we get across.

638
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:53,491
But it's so old...

639
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:56,189
and there's boards missing and stuff.

640
01:06:56,289 --> 01:07:00,204
Well, if we go one at a time to keep
the weight down, I bet we'd be okay.

641
01:07:00,304 --> 01:07:03,695
- I'll go first.
- No, I'm the lightest, I'll go first.

642
01:07:03,795 --> 01:07:07,509
Okay. Just hold onto the
ropes at all times.

643
01:07:07,802 --> 01:07:09,846
You should be fine.

644
01:07:26,688 --> 01:07:28,692
You're looking good.

645
01:07:43,307 --> 01:07:45,310
It's working fine.

646
01:07:53,385 --> 01:07:56,930
- I did it!
- I knew it would be okay.

647
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,857
Here I come.

648
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,736
Slowly, Ryan.

649
01:08:18,145 --> 01:08:20,383
Maybe you should go back.

650
01:08:30,341 --> 01:08:32,611
- Ryan!
- Don't come out here.

651
01:08:32,711 --> 01:08:34,947
Try and pull yourself up.

652
01:08:44,456 --> 01:08:46,091
Ryan!

653
01:08:48,546 --> 01:08:50,615
Ryan, below you!

654
01:08:53,183 --> 01:08:56,107
- Get out of here.
- Ryan! Ryan!

655
01:08:58,005 --> 01:08:59,649
Help!

656
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:12,905
Chinook. Ryan, you won't believe this.

657
01:09:15,241 --> 01:09:17,510
Chinook. Help me, Chinook.

658
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,665
- I was so scared.
- Yeah, so was I.

659
01:09:38,765 --> 01:09:41,403
I can't believe Chinook's here.
He saved you.

660
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:43,638
Thank you, boy.

661
01:09:43,938 --> 01:09:46,242
The mine's just over the next hill, right?

662
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:48,076
Yeah.

663
01:10:01,258 --> 01:10:06,108
Once we get to the mine I'm never having
another bean for the rest of my life.

664
01:10:06,465 --> 01:10:10,133
- Me neither.
- So much has happened to us.

665
01:10:10,233 --> 01:10:12,904
Yeah, I know.

666
01:10:13,675 --> 01:10:17,117
Africa has tried to kill
us like fifty times.

667
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:19,511
We're still going.

668
01:10:19,811 --> 01:10:21,680
Yeah, thanks to Chinook here.

669
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:24,883
Mom and Dad would be so proud of us
if they knew what we've been through.

670
01:10:24,983 --> 01:10:27,187
I miss them so much.

671
01:10:27,705 --> 01:10:31,424
- Mom must be freaking out.
- Yeah, me too.

672
01:10:32,024 --> 01:10:34,328
What, you miss Mom or you're freaking out?

673
01:10:34,428 --> 01:10:38,233
- I miss Mom.
- Chinook's owners must be worried about him.

674
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,369
What was that?

675
01:10:41,102 --> 01:10:44,065
- I don't know.
- Lions.

676
01:10:44,165 --> 01:10:46,273
Lions. They found us, Ryan.

677
01:10:46,373 --> 01:10:48,243
The torches!

678
01:10:57,285 --> 01:10:59,690
Where are they, I can't tell.

679
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:03,760
- Maybe the fire shall protect us.
- I'm so scared.

680
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,629
Lion!

681
01:11:13,169 --> 01:11:15,211
What are you doing?

682
01:11:34,826 --> 01:11:37,029
Make that fifty-one times.

683
01:11:37,429 --> 01:11:40,066
I want Mom, I want Mom. I want Mom.

684
01:11:40,266 --> 01:11:44,307
They didn't get us. They're scared
of the fire just like the hyenas.

685
01:11:44,407 --> 01:11:48,742
Now, look, we need to make more
torches now before they come back.

686
01:11:48,842 --> 01:11:50,978
Maybe we should make another fire.

687
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:52,915
Good idea.

688
01:12:46,672 --> 01:12:50,347
- What are you supposed to be?
- I'm a warrior now.

689
01:12:50,447 --> 01:12:53,813
If that lion wants to kill us, he's
going to have to go through me first.

690
01:12:53,913 --> 01:12:57,753
Okay. I swear I'll never understand boys.

691
01:13:00,753 --> 01:13:03,823
- It's him.
- Get ready.

692
01:13:04,725 --> 01:13:06,594
He's coming.

693
01:13:08,847 --> 01:13:11,661
You want us! Come and get us!

694
01:13:11,881 --> 01:13:14,640
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to pick a fight with him.

695
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:18,974
- Are you crazy?
- You stupid coward!

696
01:13:19,575 --> 01:13:22,079
Great, now you got him doing it.

697
01:13:24,248 --> 01:13:25,983
Get away!

698
01:13:27,232 --> 01:13:29,069
Give me yours.

699
01:13:31,987 --> 01:13:33,795
Leave!

700
01:13:34,086 --> 01:13:35,542
Get away!

701
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,828
Leave!

702
01:13:43,702 --> 01:13:46,304
Yeah, that's right, Mr. Lion.

703
01:13:46,404 --> 01:13:48,077
You better run.

704
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:50,777
Ryan.

705
01:13:50,877 --> 01:13:54,181
We scared him away. He's not coming back.

706
01:13:54,481 --> 01:13:56,817
He could come back any time.

707
01:13:58,317 --> 01:13:59,589
And we will be ready.

708
01:13:59,689 --> 01:14:02,454
Okay, you can drop the
whole Rambo act, okay?

709
01:14:02,554 --> 01:14:05,091
And wipe that stuff off your face.

710
01:14:05,891 --> 01:14:07,927
Yeah, okay.

711
01:14:09,563 --> 01:14:12,377
I don't think we're going
to be able to sleep tonight.

712
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:06,362
What is it, boy?

713
01:15:08,694 --> 01:15:11,698
Ryan, wake up. Ryan.

714
01:15:16,402 --> 01:15:17,637
What a night, man.

715
01:15:17,737 --> 01:15:20,273
I feel like I could sleep
for another 10 hours.

716
01:15:20,373 --> 01:15:23,444
Well, we can't. We need to keep moving.

717
01:15:24,844 --> 01:15:28,546
- I'm not sticking around here much longer.
- Yeah, me neither.

718
01:15:28,646 --> 01:15:32,454
Hey, at least Chinook can take
a shift as a watchdog for us.

719
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:39,411
Come on, boy. Come on.

720
01:15:39,511 --> 01:15:42,377
Come on. Come on. Come on, boy.

721
01:15:42,477 --> 01:15:45,469
- Chinook, come on. Come on.
- Come on. That a boy.

722
01:16:00,517 --> 01:16:03,587
- You have news, Colonel?
- Yes, Mr. Croft.

723
01:16:03,687 --> 01:16:07,625
Earlier today a group of bushmen
found the remains of a camp fire.

724
01:16:08,325 --> 01:16:12,069
- And you think it was made by our kids?
- We're quite sure it was.

725
01:16:12,169 --> 01:16:14,933
There was a shoe print by the fire
clearly made by a running shoe,

726
01:16:15,233 --> 01:16:17,502
worn by a boy about your son's age.

727
01:16:17,602 --> 01:16:20,973
That's... that's great. They're alive.

728
01:16:22,407 --> 01:16:24,944
Okay, so where was this camp fire found?

729
01:16:25,044 --> 01:16:27,514
Right there. About ten miles
from the crash site.

730
01:16:27,614 --> 01:16:30,116
Ten miles, how could they walk so far?

731
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:32,752
We are going to focus our search here.

732
01:16:32,852 --> 01:16:34,862
Hopefully they kept heading
in the same direction.

733
01:16:34,962 --> 01:16:38,124
This is the best news we've had.
Can we please join the search now?

734
01:16:38,224 --> 01:16:40,561
Yes, Mrs. Croft, that'll be fine.

735
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:43,664
The good news is they're
moving away from the border.

736
01:16:59,749 --> 01:17:02,418
Come on, boy, come on.

737
01:17:03,618 --> 01:17:05,589
Hey! Look at that!

738
01:17:20,404 --> 01:17:22,841
No, the poor thing.

739
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:57,044
- What day is this?
- Good question. Friday?

740
01:17:57,144 --> 01:18:00,214
Gosh, it seems like
we've been out here forever.

741
01:18:00,314 --> 01:18:02,684
The mine just has to be close by now.

742
01:18:02,784 --> 01:18:05,055
We've been walking for days.

743
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:06,979
Yeah.

744
01:18:07,655 --> 01:18:10,460
How do we know it's been
in a straight line?

745
01:18:13,963 --> 01:18:18,067
I wonder if we'll ever get there
or we'll just die out here.

746
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:21,873
Don't say that.
We survived everything so far.

747
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:25,323
I'm getting weaker, Ryan.

748
01:18:25,423 --> 01:18:28,812
I'm so hungry, so tired,
I could just lie down right here.

749
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:31,215
We'll get back to Mom and Dad,

750
01:18:31,315 --> 01:18:33,851
a plane or helicopter will see us soon.

751
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:38,189
I hope you're right.
I can't last much longer.

752
01:18:38,289 --> 01:18:40,358
Yeah, I know.

753
01:19:48,365 --> 01:19:50,045
We'll be ready when that lion comes back.

754
01:19:50,145 --> 01:19:54,271
We're not going to have any of
the macho warrior stuff again, are we?

755
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:55,540
Maybe.

756
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,244
Give me a break.
You think girls like that kind of stuff?

757
01:19:58,344 --> 01:20:01,247
Well, back home they do.

758
01:20:01,347 --> 01:20:03,250
Yeah, who?

759
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:06,954
All your friends. They totally
gawk at me when they come over.

760
01:20:09,154 --> 01:20:12,194
In your dreams, macho man.

761
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:26,615
Hey, why did you do that?

762
01:20:26,715 --> 01:20:28,411
Do what?

763
01:20:28,511 --> 01:20:30,513
Hit me with this.

764
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:35,918
- I didn't throw anything.
- Yeah, right.

765
01:20:38,954 --> 01:20:40,590
Hey!

766
01:20:43,243 --> 01:20:45,079
Ryan, look.

767
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,645
It's a monkey. Maybe he thinks
you're a long lost relative.

768
01:20:57,541 --> 01:20:59,678
It's okay, Chinook.

769
01:21:01,647 --> 01:21:05,652
- Maybe we're trespassing, Ryan.
- Well, I'm not moving.

770
01:21:28,943 --> 01:21:31,580
Emma, you should get some sleep.

771
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,882
I'll sit up.

772
01:21:33,982 --> 01:21:35,999
Chinook is a pretty good watch dog.

773
01:21:36,853 --> 01:21:40,721
- I don't know. After last night...
- Don't worry. We'll be okay.

774
01:21:40,821 --> 01:21:42,858
Okay, I'll try.

775
01:22:25,038 --> 01:22:27,240
Emma. Emma.

776
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:30,546
- Is the lion back?
- I think so. Get a torch.

777
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:45,159
Get away!

778
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:56,558
He's not gone. He's not gone, I know it.

779
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,331
My torch is out!

780
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:23,303
- We can't keep this up all night.
- We will if we have to.

781
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:25,471
I want to get out of here.

782
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:27,973
Me too. Me too.

783
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:49,196
Emma, what's wrong?

784
01:23:49,296 --> 01:23:51,333
We're still here.

785
01:23:52,033 --> 01:23:55,804
I just keep hoping that this is
a nightmare I'll wake up from.

786
01:23:56,204 --> 01:23:59,774
I'm sorry, Emma. It's all my fault.

787
01:23:59,874 --> 01:24:02,510
I just kept thinking
the mine was so close by.

788
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:04,645
We could be anywhere.

789
01:24:04,745 --> 01:24:08,750
Well, I think we've been walking
in a pretty straight line.

790
01:24:13,022 --> 01:24:14,791
That's all we have left.

791
01:24:14,891 --> 01:24:18,794
- A sip for me and a sip for you.
- We better find more water today.

792
01:24:18,894 --> 01:24:22,567
- We will.
- Better yet, that stupid mine.

793
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:25,168
That lion could be around here anywhere.

794
01:24:25,268 --> 01:24:27,272
Let's move out.

795
01:24:32,377 --> 01:24:34,980
It is so, so hot...

796
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,917
Just try not to think about it.

797
01:24:37,717 --> 01:24:41,253
Come on, Chinook. Come on, boy.

798
01:25:08,852 --> 01:25:10,454
Run!

799
01:25:35,614 --> 01:25:37,283
Water.

800
01:25:43,521 --> 01:25:45,525
Ryan, look out!

801
01:25:49,924 --> 01:25:53,184
- Ryan, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

802
01:25:53,763 --> 01:25:56,187
We can't go up and we can't go down.

803
01:25:56,803 --> 01:26:00,974
- The lion's still out there.
- We could send Chinook for help.

804
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:03,144
Give me a break, Emma.

805
01:26:03,244 --> 01:26:04,877
Did you hear that?

806
01:26:04,977 --> 01:26:07,555
Yeah, sounds like another big elephant.
Just what we need.

807
01:26:08,415 --> 01:26:10,483
Ryan, it's Rumba.

808
01:26:11,853 --> 01:26:14,323
Rumba, come here. Come here, Rumba.

809
01:26:14,423 --> 01:26:16,463
Attaboy, Rumba.

810
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,291
Come on, Rumba.

811
01:26:24,548 --> 01:26:26,594
Thank you, Rumba. Help her.

812
01:26:26,694 --> 01:26:29,211
Come on. Come here, Rumba.

813
01:26:34,845 --> 01:26:36,132
Thank you.

814
01:26:36,235 --> 01:26:39,748
Thank you, Rumba. Thank you.

815
01:26:44,722 --> 01:26:46,598
Bye, Rumba.

816
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:50,996
- I'll never forget you.
- You saved us, Rumba.

817
01:27:24,132 --> 01:27:27,183
- Ryan, do you hear that?
- Yeah.

818
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:30,170
A jeep. Come on!

819
01:27:38,847 --> 01:27:40,916
Stop! Stop!

820
01:28:03,874 --> 01:28:06,445
Mr. Kruger. We need to find him.
We left him, Dad.

821
01:28:06,545 --> 01:28:09,416
No, it's okay, son. He's been found.
And he's recovering just fine.

822
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:12,110
Oh, God, Emma, Ryan, are either
of you hurt? Are you okay?

823
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:14,254
- I'm fine, Mom.
- I'm okay too, Mom.

824
01:28:14,454 --> 01:28:17,331
You know, we've been searching
for days for you two.

825
01:28:17,431 --> 01:28:19,659
How'd you end up all the way out here?

826
01:28:19,759 --> 01:28:24,596
We thought your mine was close by
and we really needed to help Mr. Kruger.

827
01:28:24,696 --> 01:28:27,300
So we just started walking
and then we got lost.

828
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,004
We saved an elephant and then he saved us.

829
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:32,373
An elephant saved you?

830
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:35,541
Yeah, Dad. And we got chased by a lion.

831
01:28:35,641 --> 01:28:39,047
- And a hyena almost ate us.
- How did you survive?

832
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:43,018
- We built fires.
- Yeah, and Chinook helped us a lot.

833
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:46,455
But then he got lost for a while
after the zebra stampede.

834
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:49,158
Zebra stampede. Paul...

835
01:28:49,784 --> 01:28:52,144
You guys are going to have
to write this all down in a book.

836
01:28:52,229 --> 01:28:55,496
- Maybe they'll make a movie about us.
- Yeah, right, Ryan.

837
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:57,609
Right now I just want to
get you two home safely.

838
01:28:57,633 --> 01:28:59,293
Come on, you.

839
01:28:59,503 --> 01:29:04,108
And Ryan got pecked by an ostrich.
