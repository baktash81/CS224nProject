1
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,923
Holly, you've gotta open up.

2
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,658
I'm not so sure about this.

3
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,300
Come on open the door,
tough guy.

4
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,035
Okay.

5
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,435
You look awesome. Turn.

6
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,809
I cannot believe that you talked
me into going to the dance.

7
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,372
I thought you said you've been
to like, a million schools.

8
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,613
Schools, a million.
Dances, zero.

9
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,219
I'll get it.

10
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,351
Go.

11
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,665
It's a simple matter
of self-preservation.

12
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,261
I mean,
when you move around a lot...

13
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,239
you just don't let yourself
get attached.

14
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,833
Much less, make plans
to go to school dances.

15
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,539
I hate to break it to you,
but in exactly one week...

16
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,309
your streak is
officially going to end.

17
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,752
Maybe you're right.

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,320
Surprise!

19
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,123
Come in.
Jean.

20
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,631
We need to talk.

21
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,926
What?

22
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,162
Jean.

23
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,366
Why? How could you?
Jean.

24
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,339
Wait, don't you "Jean" me. Just
calm down. Please, calm down.

25
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,844
We can be civilized
about this.

26
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,311
I'll be right back.

27
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,677
Civilized?

28
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,909
Just calm down. No, why
are you telling me this?

29
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,214
Are you in love with her?
She meant nothing to me.

30
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,345
Well, technically,
they meant nothing to me.

31
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,548
"They"?

32
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,988
"They?"

33
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,583
Look on the bright side.
It's out of my system.

34
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,889
Have a nice day.

35
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,266
Explain this
to me again.

36
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,941
Patsy's back.

37
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,675
It's packing time.

38
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,008
Does this mean you're
not going to the dance?

39
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,611
We'll be gone
by the end of the week.

40
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,686
I'll stay in touch.

41
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,551
Bye.

42
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,019
I'll miss you.

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,705
Where are we going
this time?

44
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,139
There's a spot open
at Dolores' bakery.

45
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,181
You know, I've always
wanted to go there...

46
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,775
and you kids
will love Brooklyn.

47
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,378
It's time
for a new adventure and...

48
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,719
I'm sorry, honey.

49
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,623
I know you were finally
making some friends here.

50
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,289
It's no biggie.

51
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,460
There's friends everywhere.
Right?

52
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,846
Hey, all you bloggers.
It's me: Girl on the Move.

53
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,048
Well, here's a big shocker.

54
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,716
My mom got her heart broken.
Again.

55
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,624
Yep, we're starting off
on another big adventure.

56
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,725
That's my mom's word
for running away.

57
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,397
"T-l-C" Tic.

58
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,964
Trick.

59
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,365
Stick.

60
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,672
Come on,
little Miss Mary Sunshine.

61
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,508
Play the game. Give us
a word with "tic" in it.

62
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,638
Fine.

63
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,544
Tragic.

64
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,183
Fantastic.

65
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,915
Pathetic.

66
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,253
Ecstatic.

67
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,918
Thank you.

68
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,359
Sarcastic.

69
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,824
Psychotic.

70
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,363
It's genetic.

71
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:32,962
By some miracle...

72
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,599
my mom only got one speeding
ticket the whole way.

73
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,643
It's Miss Jean Hamilton.

74
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,339
Are you married?

75
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,643
He should write her a ticket
for reckless flirting.

76
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,253
Wow!

77
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,054
I will say one thing, though.

78
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,065
For those of you
who haven't done it yet...

79
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,828
put "Must see
New York skyline"...

80
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,369
on your list of things
to do before you die.

81
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,324
Oh, wow!

82
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,600
Oh, girls!

83
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,195
I bet it's full of quaint details,
pretty moldings on the ceilings...

84
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,263
and old hardwood floors.

85
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,833
And charming little rat
droppings in the breakfast nook.

86
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,845
How delightful.
Cut it out.

87
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,904
It's going to be perfect.

88
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,786
The sad thing is, I'm actually
getting good at this.

89
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,323
If all else fails, I have
a very promising future...

90
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,359
as a professional mover.

91
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,956
Our new apartment has history
and character.

92
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,794
And exotic local wildlife.

93
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,161
My mom calls it home.

94
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,967
I call it the
Witness Relocation Program.

95
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,575
Mommy, look!

96
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,307
There it is.
I told you.

97
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,179
The same one
as in Wichita.

98
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,514
It still comes out
every night.

99
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,383
Even in hard times.

100
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,882
To remind us that every day
holds the potential for beauty.

101
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,427
It's getting late,
and I'm wiped.

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,434
So, time to hit the sheets.

103
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,596
Even though I have no idea
which box they're in.

104
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,705
Keep reading my on-line
journal for more days...

105
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,835
in the life of a teenage
gypsy. I'll be here.

106
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,240
The same me,
just a different zip code.

107
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,460
No! That's it! I'm not going.
You go with him.

108
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,961
Sorry.

109
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,933
Check her out.
Hey, you.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,331
Yeah, you.

111
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,895
How much your kicks
cost you?

112
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,336
What?

113
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,874
I paid $50 for mine.

114
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,736
You?
Free.

115
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,779
I pulled them out of a garbage
can somewhere in Portland.

116
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,109
You win.

117
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,372
See you, freak.

118
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,911
Hey, you're new here?

119
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,216
Yeah, how'd you know?
Your skin.

120
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,483
My skin looks new?
It looks virgin.

121
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,787
No piercing, no tats.

122
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,293
See, us Brooklyn girls, we lose
our skin virginity by fifth grade.

123
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,560
In fifth grade, I was just
learning long division.

124
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,829
Attention, all students.

125
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,928
Check in with your
homeroom monitor each day...

126
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:26,994
That stinks.

127
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,132
You're going to have to
take your yearbook photo...

128
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,335
with all the losers who
missed it in the fall.

129
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,877
I don't do yearbook photos.

130
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,412
You have no choice.

131
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,004
It's like taxes
and death.

132
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,380
Mandatory pain. If you
don't do it yourself...

133
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,919
they'll hunt you down like an
animal and force you to smile.

134
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,887
Not if I'm not here anymore,
they won't.

135
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,757
I'm so glad you came.
Thanks.

136
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,454
Now, we keep the mixers
in the back.

137
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,997
But I got to warn you,
they're all older than God.

138
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,531
They don't really
mix very well...

139
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,123
they just kind of move
things around.

140
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,965
So I hope your manual
mixer's in real good shape.

141
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,164
And watch out
for our no-good oven.

142
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,934
It's worse than that one
in Chapel Hill.

143
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,407
Off by a good 10 degrees.

144
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,670
Well, you know me.

145
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,736
I'm off by way more than that.
Yes, you are.

146
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,016
And this is Gloria.
Gloria, this is Jean...

147
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,643
the one I was telling you
about. Really nice to meet you.

148
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,981
Likewise.

149
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,615
Do you know anything
about wilting rose petals?

150
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,021
The fondant's too soft.

151
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,059
You need to add
more cornstarch.

152
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,958
See, I told you she was good.

153
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,122
No wonder my rum cakes
always look so drunk.

154
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,256
Help me. I like you.

155
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,364
You never eat the cakes?

156
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,695
You made it on time?
Yeah, I'm here.

157
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,471
Attention, all students.

158
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,738
Talent show auditions
will take place...

159
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,280
this Friday evening
in the auditorium.

160
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,873
Come on out
and show us what you got.

161
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,448
That's my seat.

162
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,855
Is there assigned seating?

163
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,190
No, but... Why don't
you take one of those?

164
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,433
I don't like sitting up front.

165
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,301
Me, neither.

166
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,759
Isn't it big?

167
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,163
It's gorgeous!
It's so heavy.

168
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,599
I need a crane
to lift my finger.

169
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,765
Well, baby,
if he's any good at all...

170
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,965
you'll never have to lift
a finger again.

171
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,735
I'm so glad
I listened to you.

172
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,866
He was a customer.

173
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,843
Dolores coached me
through the whole thing.

174
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:49,142
When to give him an extra
doughnut, when to hold back.

175
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,945
You never told me that.
I told you.

176
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,747
You just didn't
want to listen.

177
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,582
So I've had a few
bad relationships.

178
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,646
Honey, if ex-boyfriends
were dollars...

179
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,712
you'd be loaded by now.

180
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,224
Now, baby,
what you gotta do is...

181
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,022
Mom, what you gotta do
is sign my enrollment form.

182
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,460
4:00 already?

183
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,657
Girls, this is
my daughter, Holly.

184
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,960
Hi.
I'm going to get my purse.

185
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,002
Look at you!
All grown up.

186
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,629
Got your little speed bumps
and everything.

187
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,434
Welcome to Brooklyn, Holly.

188
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,838
See you girls tomorrow.

189
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,308
Don't embarrass her.
I've known her for so long.

190
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,708
So, tell me. How was it?

191
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,406
It was good.
Tell me more.

192
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,347
Excuse me, real quick,
I was just, I was over here.

193
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,181
I was just wondering,
did it hurt at all?

194
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,946
Did what hurt?

195
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,717
When you fell.
You know, from heaven.

196
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,816
'Cause I was just thinking
with a face like that...

197
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,451
you gotta be an angel, right?

198
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,760
Has that line
ever worked for you?

199
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,528
Well, I got you to laugh,
right? That's Step One.

200
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,502
I'm Lenny Horton.
I'm the bread manager.

201
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,334
I make, you know, the bread.

202
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,136
We got Italian bread,
French bread, bulky rolls...

203
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,973
different kinds
of kaiser rolls, pita bread.

204
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,376
You like pita bread?
I'm Jean.

205
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,210
This is
my daughter, Holly.

206
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,613
Hey, how you doing, Holly?

207
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:01,244
Great, and I think we gotta go
before you learn Step Two.

208
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,982
Lenny, tell me you didn't
use the heaven line.

209
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,823
First days at new schools
always feel the same.

210
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:18,026
Like suddenly you're on a new
planet, breathing a new atmosphere.

211
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,972
Can you scan this
into Match. Com?

212
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,098
Mom, I'm busy.

213
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,741
Doing what?

214
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,177
Do you have to
do this right away?

215
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,805
Can't you just
wait this time...

216
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,407
and see if you meet a guy
the normal way?

217
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,082
Have you seen these lines?

218
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,589
I am in a race against time.

219
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,023
Now get on in there
and scan this thing.

220
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,256
Every second counts.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

221
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,861
If a student brings a cell phone
to school, it will be confiscated...

222
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,094
regardless of how...

223
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,501
Excuse me. I don't even
know why we're here.

224
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,369
It's not like they're going to be
my teachers four months from now.

225
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,772
That's negative imaging,
Holly.

226
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,003
...are not permitted
in the school building.

227
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:03,071
Only winter hats will be permitted
between the months of November...

228
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,175
and February
and kept in your lockers.

229
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,744
Now, I'd like to introduce to you
the Head of our Guidance Department.

230
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,950
Dr. Charles Fitch.
All right, Fitchy!

231
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,121
Hey, Fitch!

232
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,760
Hey, Dr. Fitch!
Hey there, everyone.

233
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:24,235
Let me tell you how I run
the Guidance Department.

234
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,336
I have an open-door policy, which
means you can stop by my office...

235
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,466
whenever you want.

236
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,944
I also have
an open-mind policy.

237
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,610
There are no stupid questions.

238
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,852
So please, if you have something
on your mind, knock on my door.

239
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,316
Mom.

240
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,825
Or raise your hands.

241
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,755
Woman in the back. Go ahead. Hi.

242
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,967
Instead of once a year, have you
considered a monthly forum where...

243
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,664
students and teachers could exchange
thoughts in an effort to enhance...

244
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,968
communication and bridge gaps?

245
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:03,931
That's a...

246
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,136
That's a great comment,
Mrs...

247
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,237
Miss Hamilton.

248
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:13,314
I also wondered if you'd thought of
monthly mixers for single parents.

249
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,853
Not that I don't want to meet
married parents as well.

250
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,048
I would.

251
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,557
It's just that sometimes
we single parents...

252
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,924
have different concerns
than married ones.

253
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,123
Different priorities.
If you know what I mean.

254
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,525
And by priorities I mean:

255
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,660
I need to meet a good man.

256
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,840
In that case,
where do I sign up?

257
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,714
Okay, well,
this was interesting.

258
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,015
Where were we here?

259
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,852
So you're just not going to talk
to me for the rest of your life?

260
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,694
Come on, Holly.

261
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,290
Every unmarried parent there
appreciated the suggestion.

262
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,933
Did it ever occur to you that
the point of the meeting...

263
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,164
wasn't for the needs
of the single parent?

264
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,401
That the point of the meeting
was maybe for, I don't know...

265
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,773
the kids?
Well, sure.

266
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,335
I was just thinking...
About you!

267
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,243
Because you're always
thinking about you.

268
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,916
She's doing it again.

269
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,584
Only this time,
I can't smile and play along.

270
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,186
Because the truth is
I'm tired...

271
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,164
of bubble-wrap and change of address
cards, of figuring out new towns...

272
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,201
and finding new friends.

273
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,493
It's just not fun anymore.

274
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,498
It's just not.

275
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,586
You know what
the entire student body...

276
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,887
is talking about this morning?

277
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,959
The Krispy Kreme truck that
got in a wreck on Eighth Avenue.

278
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,666
There's donuts
everywhere.

279
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,429
It's a total free-for-all.

280
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:14,199
Between the excitement and the
sugar buzz, everyone's pretty much...

281
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,970
forgotten everything that
happened before 8:00 this morning.

282
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,708
It could have been worse.

283
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,183
Don't worry, it will be.

284
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,776
It always starts the same.

285
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,880
I mean, she starts out hopeful,
and then when the perfect man...

286
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,448
doesn't come around in two
weeks, she gets desperate...

287
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,823
and hooks up with some loser.

288
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,362
Some guy who's not even
good enough to mop her floors.

289
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,422
And then, when it doesn't work
out, because it never works out...

290
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,435
we pack up and move again, and
there's nothing I can do about it.

291
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,733
I can't even run away
because that's what she does.

292
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,035
I thought you said you didn't
mind all the moving around.

293
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:53,101
I didn't. I mean, I don't.
I just got here.

294
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,516
The River Bistro.

295
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,679
What are we doing here?

296
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,417
I can't even afford to pee
in a place like this.

297
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,924
Much less actually eat here.

298
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,926
Relax,
it's under control.

299
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,791
My uncle's the owner.

300
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,689
Him?

301
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,057
You've got to be kidding.
No, him.

302
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,161
No, you didn't do that,
did you?

303
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,772
Well, how long
did you keep her waiting?

304
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,133
What? An hour?

305
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,444
Of course she's mad.

306
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,310
What? Hold on.

307
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,279
This is Holly.
Hi.

308
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,544
Hi, Holly.
Nice to meet you.

309
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,586
Why wouldn't she be mad?

310
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,155
Well, there's only one thing
you can do: Flowers.

311
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,723
And you can't go cheap,
either. Nope.

312
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,053
A dozen, long-stemmed.

313
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,030
He knows about females.

314
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,761
He knows more about females
than I know about females.

315
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,229
In my opinion,
roses always work, always.

316
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,105
He doesn't actually
believe that, does he?

317
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,307
But who am I to know?

318
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,906
Call me tomorrow and let me
know how it worked out. Bye.

319
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,144
Yes, I do believe that.
Don't you?

320
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,188
That flowers always work?
Yeah.

321
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,779
Not if the guy's a loser.

322
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,791
The flowers aren't going to
change anything.

323
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,884
Flowers are
just flowers, right?

324
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,726
Wow, your friend's
so cynical.

325
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,026
Sounds like
she's not into romance.

326
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,390
You know what?

327
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,667
This is for you.
Why?

328
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,335
Because a flower like this
is perfect.

329
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,038
And giving a woman a dozen
of them, it's like saying...

330
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,082
there is such a thing
as perfect.

331
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,275
And it's out there.

332
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,545
Don't give up.
You'll find it.

333
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,911
Really?

334
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,046
A yellow rose says
all of that?

335
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,284
Actually a yellow rose
is for your sick grandma.

336
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,121
For a woman, a red rose.

337
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:52,186
But if you really want to knock her
socks off, you give her an orchid.

338
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,232
Why? What do orchids say?

339
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,530
You ever seen an orchid?

340
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,338
How it floats in the water,
so delicate and beautiful?

341
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,870
When a woman gets an orchid...

342
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,367
well, she feels like...

343
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:11,439
she's floating on a cloud
of infinite possibility.

344
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,381
I swear I'll pay you back.

345
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,893
I still don't get how flowers
from you will fix things.

346
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,952
Well, they're not flowers,
they're orchids.

347
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,362
And they're not from me.
They're from her perfect man.

348
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,456
Then let him pay.

349
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,468
I would, if he existed.

350
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,729
I'm lost.

351
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,395
Do you remember
what your uncle said?

352
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,804
An orchid will make
my mom feel special.

353
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,206
Which will make her happy.
And not so desperate.

354
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,575
Which would make me happy,
and then everybody wins.

355
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,242
Holly?
What?

356
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,084
Are you sure this is
a good idea? I'm sure.

357
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,143
A few flowers
never hurt anyone.

358
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,757
"Annoying mammal."

359
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,224
Six letters.

360
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,932
Hey, Mom.
Badger.

361
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,765
Boy, am I thirsty.

362
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,806
Was that the buzzer?

363
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,249
Five letters for
"In line to get, maybe."

364
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,782
Mom, wasn't that
the buzzer?

365
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,548
The Times thinks
they're so clever.

366
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,492
I've got to go take
a shower right now.

367
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,170
Hey.

368
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,530
Excuse me.

369
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,699
Hello, that's my flower.

370
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,709
No, it's not, it's mine.

371
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,405
Is your name Jean?
No, that's my girlfriend.

372
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,879
Okay, what's the card say?

373
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,609
It says,
"To my dearest girlfriend...

374
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,278
"on her birthday, I love you
so..." Give me my flower back.

375
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,303
Could you be
any more crazy?

376
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,711
I was just
bringing them to you.

377
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,571
Wow! How beautiful.

378
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,797
Who are those for?
Me.

379
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,967
Isn't that weird,
someone left me flowers?

380
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:28,479
Who? What's the card say?
Let's see.

381
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:35,916
"How many women can look like
a goddess in a bakery uniform?

382
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,084
"You are a vision."

383
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,714
Who sent them?

384
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,194
"A Secret Admirer."

385
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,821
Who could it be?

386
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,332
Well, obviously, someone
that saw you at the shop.

387
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,926
Yeah, but how would
he know my name?

388
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,663
Well, you wear a nametag,
don't you?

389
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,208
Or where I live?
Duh? Google.

390
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,010
Or that I love orchids?

391
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,939
Maybe he followed you home.

392
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,406
It's very strange.

393
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,453
No, it's probably scary.

394
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,589
Mom, look, this is
the most romantic thing...

395
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,352
that a man has
ever done for you.

396
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,361
Quit questioning it
and enjoy it.

397
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,157
You are absolutely right.

398
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,474
Why are you wearing jeans
under your robe?

399
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:38,082
How would you like to have
bruises all over your body?

400
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,524
Your uncle is a genius.

401
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,985
It worked?
She was singing happy songs!

402
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,723
She never sings happy songs.

403
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,631
Yeah, well, neither do I, but
don't send me flowers, okay?

404
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,668
I like it that way.

405
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,404
Hey.

406
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,360
Hey, check it out. Do I got
juice or what? Look at Jean.

407
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,330
A little attention from me and
she's all poofed up like a peacock.

408
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,858
It's the guy peacock
who poofs up.

409
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,595
You know what I'm saying.
It's an animal thing.

410
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,640
She's like a lioness letting
the lion know she's ready.

411
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,267
It's the guy lion
who poofs up, too.

412
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,609
People, don't forget
to read Chapters 42 and 43.

413
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,172
There will be
a test on Friday.

414
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,514
Peter, can I see you
a minute, please?

415
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,780
Hurry up!

416
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,550
What's that?

417
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,589
Nothing.
Is that supposed to be me?

418
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,719
No, it's somebody else.

419
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,128
The face.

420
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,790
This looks exactly
like my face.

421
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,334
No, it isn't.

422
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,437
Okay, the face
a little bit.

423
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,065
But that woman
is on a horse.

424
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,671
You're not on a horse.

425
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,607
That's a completely
different person.

426
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,937
It's pretty good.

427
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,951
My dad sponsored comic book
conventions when I was a kid.

428
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,213
He'd take me.

429
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,051
If you hang around long
enough, you pick it up.

430
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,114
So you hung out
with your dad a lot?

431
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,025
No. Actually, after he
and my mom split up...

432
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,689
that's pretty much the
only thing we did together.

433
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,832
But, hey, at least I
learned how to draw, right?

434
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,301
Divorce as a career builder.
That's nice.

435
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,271
So, hey,
have you ever been?

436
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,773
Divorced? Not yet.

437
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,540
No, to a comic convention.

438
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,079
No, not that, either.

439
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:52,514
Well, there's one
coming up.

440
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,644
Six weeks from now.
Westside Convention Center.

441
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,512
It sounds geeky,
but it's kind of fun.

442
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,387
Yeah. I'm not much
of a planner, you know.

443
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,893
Has anyone been
asking for me?

444
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,904
Like who?
I don't know.

445
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,234
Anyone?
No.

446
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,297
Hey, Jean.

447
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,167
This has your name
written all over it.

448
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,707
Dolores, you're crazy.

449
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,512
No! She's right. You're
way too good for this place.

450
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,416
This contest is
for professionals.

451
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,818
I mean, I'm basically
a salesperson.

452
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,379
Explain this to me.

453
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,787
How come when it's a man
you're looking at...

454
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,588
you're blind to his flaws...

455
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,494
but when it's you,
flaws is all you see?

456
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,826
Hmm?
Mmm.

457
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,374
Is it you?

458
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,271
Yeah, it's me, babe.

459
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,071
Hi.

460
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,273
Hi.

461
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,253
I love orchids. Thank you.

462
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,753
This is a rose.
Which I also love.

463
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,989
So are you free
Saturday night?

464
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,929
What did you have in mind?

465
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,866
Nothing short of
rocking your world, babe.

466
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,028
Well, my world doesn't
rock that easy.

467
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,572
That's right, make him
work for it, girlfriend.

468
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,471
That's on account
of you've never had...

469
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,476
your world rocked by Lenny
"The World-Rocker" Horton.

470
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,134
Okay.

471
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,081
Let's say I check
my social calendar...

472
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,549
and it turns out I am free
Saturday night.

473
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,276
Where are we going?

474
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,218
Only to hear the
greatest American band...

475
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,017
ever to pipe out
a power ballad.

476
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,253
Styx concert.

477
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,290
Something I've never done.

478
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,990
You're a Styx newbie?

479
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,223
These are really hot tickets.

480
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,329
I must really like you.

481
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,938
Okay, so Saturday night.
Saturday.

482
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,030
Saturday.

483
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,239
What? Stop!

484
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:03,379
It's impossible that
Lenny is your secret admirer.

485
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,813
Nothing's impossible.

486
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,441
No. Some things are.

487
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,352
Like a man that sends you an
orchid, the most romantic flower...

488
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,890
and then turns around
and sends you a yellow rose.

489
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,356
That's the kind of flower...

490
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,656
that someone sends their sick
grandmother in the hospital.

491
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,853
I'll get it.

492
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,162
Mom, please,
can you just listen to me?

493
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,702
I read that note, okay?

494
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,896
A man like that...

495
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,236
a poet, he doesn't take
a woman to a Styx concert.

496
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,339
Well, it's different.

497
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,942
So is a peanut butter
and glue sandwich.

498
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,571
That doesn't mean
you eat it.

499
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,306
Holly, I like this guy.
He seems to like me.

500
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,444
Would it kill you
to give him a chance?

501
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,949
Princess Zoe?
Yes.

502
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,151
You can tell I'm a princess
from all my beautiful necklaces.

503
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,629
N-E-C-K-L-A-C-E-S.

504
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,298
Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

505
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,128
Hi, Lenny.

506
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:04,505
Wow, Jean. Whoa!
Great outfit.

507
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,271
Damn, where did you get that?

508
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,834
Who's-a-hottie. Com?

509
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,418
All right. So, you got
everything you need?

510
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,750
Yeah. Let me just put this on. Okay.

511
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:21,818
Hey, Holly, your mom said that
Saturday night is movie night.

512
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,860
So, what do you say on me...

513
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,590
you take Princess Zoe here,
you guys go see Bambi?

514
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,693
I'm not actually sure that
Bambi is still in theaters.

515
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,432
Which is such a shame because
I'm just dying to take...

516
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,441
my 7-year-old little sister to
a movie where the mom gets...

517
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,101
killed by
the evil male hunter.

518
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,804
I want to go see that.

519
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,574
Thank you, Lenny.
That's very nice of you.

520
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,677
Thank you, Lenny.
That's very nice of you.

521
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,849
Be good.

522
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,090
Wow! It's great.

523
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,132
Yeah, it's a 1980 Pontiac
Trans Am two-door hardtop.

524
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,394
Got the original paint,
the original exhaust.

525
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,595
I re-built the tranny,
tweaked the mill.

526
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,968
And as a matter of fact,
I got...

527
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,940
some new passenger mats right
here, so would you mind...

528
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,705
just taking your shoes off?
Before you get in?

529
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,074
I should have bought a pair
of those hospital booties.

530
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,706
Wait, do you have any?

531
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,746
Let me guess.

532
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,653
The sick-grandma argument
didn't fly?

533
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,281
She barely even heard it.

534
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,725
She was too busy picturing
herself as Mrs. Lenny Hair Band.

535
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,456
He's got to be derailed.

536
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,625
By what?
I don't know.

537
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,167
Listen, I'm going to drop Zoe
off at Dolores'...

538
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,897
and I'll meet you
at the Bistro in 20.

539
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,495
Ice cream is going to help.

540
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,040
No, but your uncle will.

541
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,132
He knew exactly what to do
about the orchids...

542
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,438
and he'll know
what to do next.

543
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,478
Ciao.

544
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,842
# Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto #

545
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,850
# Mata ahoo Hima de #

546
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:57,251
# Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto #

547
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:02,055
# Himitsu wo Shiri tai #

548
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,354
# You're wondering who I am #

549
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,627
# Secret, secret,
I've got a secret #

550
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,168
# Machine or mannequin #

551
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,898
Lenny, I don't think
that's Styx.

552
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,702
No, they're Kilroy, they're
a tribute band to Styx.

553
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,708
# Secret, secret,
I've got a secret ##

554
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,835
Yeah, the singer's not
as good as the original.

555
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:24,211
But if you close your eyes, you
can't even tell the difference.

556
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,845
Yeah, you can tell.

557
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,384
We have a question.

558
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,317
Mel, put those
two tables together.

559
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,361
Kid, can it wait?
I'm a little busy.

560
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,761
No, it's really important.
It's for our school assignment.

561
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,958
Due tomorrow.

562
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,058
We need to know what the
perfect man would do...

563
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,432
as a follow-up
to the orchid.

564
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,130
Well, can't we talk
about it tomorrow?

565
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,571
Wait, what could be more
important than the perfect man?

566
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,040
Duh, perfect shoes.

567
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,406
Lance, please.

568
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,842
Don't "Lance, please" me.

569
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,244
Take a break
and help these girls out.

570
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,145
You try the new Shiraz...

571
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:03,847
sit at your table and let good
old Lance handle the floor.

572
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,817
All right. Five minutes.

573
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,127
Don't play with your hair
at the bar, Lance.

574
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:21,136
So, what are you writing a school
paper on, dating or something?

575
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,463
Yeah.

576
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,972
Well, what class would that be? English.

577
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:30,811
I'm looking at romantic
heroes, like in literature.

578
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,944
You know...
Romeo.

579
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,713
Right, or Heathcliff.

580
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,947
Taking guys like that...

581
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,922
and comparing them to their
real-life counterparts.

582
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,053
But you don't believe
in romance.

583
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,989
I'm stretching.

584
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,592
Well, girls, I'm really
not an authority on this.

585
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:54,660
Hot!

586
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,373
What makes today's
Perfect man perfect?

587
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:03,505
What is it that he says or does
that makes him a woman's perfect man?

588
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,040
Well, that depends.
Every woman's different.

589
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,018
But yet, orchids work
for all of them?

590
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,851
Well, as a gesture, they do.
I mean, but that's just a...

591
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,918
That's a beginning,
that's...

592
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,320
He's got to have
a deeper connection than that.

593
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,158
He's got to know
what makes her tick.

594
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,790
Which is why, if you don't
know who the woman is...

595
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,128
it's rather a moot point.

596
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,135
She listens to Patsy Cline
when she's sad.

597
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,830
Hypothetically.

598
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,201
Say she does.

599
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,603
Then what?

600
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,842
Patsy Cline's her sad music?

601
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,778
Wait a minute.

602
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,175
Now.

603
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,282
This is very happy music.

604
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,056
Keep it. But you know what?

605
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,118
Even if he does
cheer her up...

606
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,561
he can't be a guy
that's afraid of tears.

607
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,968
# Babe, I love you ##

608
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,011
It's like he wrote
it about us.

609
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,508
What if she's into word games?

610
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,311
Scrabble, you know,
stuff like that?

611
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,818
Oh, yeah. Good stuff.

612
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,412
A little wit, a little
wordplay. I like that.

613
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,083
And if she's been
dumped a lot? Then what?

614
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,217
A lot?

615
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,856
That's a tough one.

616
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,766
I guess the perfect guy
would be...

617
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,366
He'd be someone who could...

618
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:37,230
He could be anywhere
in the world...

619
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,036
but he chooses
to be with her because...

620
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,578
life is better with her
by his side.

621
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,184
What do you think?
Did I pass the test?

622
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,345
Very nice to meet you.

623
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,547
Stop it!

624
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:52,816
Big problem.

625
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:55,985
Hey, cutie.
Hi, Amber.

626
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,690
Hey, okay. Designer dress,
bias cut, wedding chic.

627
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,760
Where's the problem?

628
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,529
It's a small fortune.

629
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,763
No, that's a lie.
It's a large fortune.

630
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,863
It's your day. Do it.

631
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,738
Really?
Yeah.

632
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,004
I adore you.

633
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,038
Okay, what about the cake?

634
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,674
You know what, girls?
I got to go to work. Really.

635
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,047
I was thinking of something
layers, chocolate, strawberry.

636
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,916
Amber, let's talk
about it tomorrow.

637
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,285
Lance, step away
from the purse.

638
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,450
She's gorgeous.
Yeah.

639
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:32,462
Together they look like the winners
of a genetic lottery. Come on.

640
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,937
Here, let me get this
for you. You got it?

641
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:51,106
Thanks. Well, Lenny, l...
Whoops, we're wet. Watch it.

642
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,377
I don't even know
what to say. It's been...

643
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,644
Now, Jean,
I had a fantastic time.

644
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,712
I got to tell you,
I really, you know.

645
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,257
I really, I could get
used to this.

646
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,958
You're a good kisser.

647
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,831
It was a really good time.

648
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,838
All right. So,
I'll see you at work, okay?

649
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,366
My shoes.
I'm sorry.

650
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,886
How was the '80s flashback?

651
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:35,991
You scared me!

652
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,324
His stupid car is louder
than a jumbo jet.

653
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,921
He probably woke up
the whole entire neighborhood.

654
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,923
Holly, for me, would you
give Lenny a chance?

655
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:47,232
Mom, for me,
would you go slow this time?

656
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,966
You don't know
who else is out there.

657
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,667
No, but here's what I do know:

658
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,232
Tonight I had
a pretty good time.

659
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,942
"Oh what a tangled web
we weave

660
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:04,215
"When first
we practice to deceive!"

661
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,882
Who wants to talk
about what that means?

662
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,922
He needs to write her a letter. Who?

663
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,018
The perfect man.

664
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,188
Adam, care to elucidate?

665
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:14,753
Yeah, you.

666
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,062
What do you think Sir Walter
Scott was talking about?

667
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,365
You're going to forge a
letter? I have to. If I don't...

668
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,429
my mom's going to be
walking down the aisle...

669
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:23,871
to the sound of Mr. Roboto.

670
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:27,069
Well, I think, it's that
lies get complicated.

671
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,140
Because?

672
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,448
Usually if you tell a lie,
you have to tell another lie.

673
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,916
Except she's totally going to
recognize my handwriting.

674
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,420
She won't recognize mine.
True.

675
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,080
And each lie turns into
another lie...

676
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,488
and another lie, and it
makes things complicated.

677
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,086
Until, eventually, you're left
with this big mess of lies...

678
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,720
that you can't
find your way out of.

679
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,822
We'll do it right after school. Perfect.

680
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,799
Perfect.
All right. I'll buy that.

681
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,701
Alana, what does "tangled web"
symbolize?

682
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,064
What if she's into word games?

683
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,801
Scrabble, you know,
stuff like that?

684
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,139
Oh, yeah. Good stuff.

685
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,611
A little wit, a little
wordplay. I like that.

686
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,012
I know what I'm doing
borders on delusional...

687
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,379
but what can I say?

688
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,941
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

689
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,017
Trust me. If you met Lenny...

690
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,989
you'd lick the envelope
and lend me a stamp.

691
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,123
Hi.

692
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,965
Where did her troops go?

693
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,698
She needed some quiet time...

694
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,296
to think things out.

695
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,230
What kind of things?

696
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,039
Well, you know,
like what her next step is.

697
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,942
You know,
whether she's going to form...

698
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:40,416
a powerful alliance
with a prince or go it alone.

699
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,818
Which is she gonna choose?

700
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,052
I think she's going to go
with the prince.

701
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,680
Really?
Oh, yeah.

702
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,252
He's kind of a great guy,
you know.

703
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,854
He's handsome.
He's very nice.

704
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,927
And the thing with the...

705
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,559
Jousting.
Jousting. Yes.

706
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,866
You should see him joust.
He is like Joe Jouster.

707
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,133
Any time that anybody ever
wants to hang out with him...

708
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:06,836
he's like "Guys, I can't. I've
gotta practice my jousting."

709
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,240
Do you want to sit?

710
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,174
No.

711
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,946
I made plans
with someone. So...

712
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,113
I thought you weren't
much of a planner.

713
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:21,921
Yeah. Right.

714
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,928
Holly? Do you think
we're going to stay here?

715
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,700
I don't know. Why?

716
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,674
There's a big spelling bee coming
up with all the other schools.

717
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,005
My teacher entered me.

718
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:43,478
I bet you're going to win that.
You're the best speller I know.

719
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,142
Yeah. Only, it's not
for a couple of months.

720
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,718
Well, you never know,
we might still be here.

721
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,622
I hope so.
I've never entered anything.

722
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,354
Hi, girls.

723
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,023
Mommy, are you sick?

724
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,093
What?

725
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,827
You don't look normal.

726
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,930
I got a letter.

727
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,737
What kind of letter?

728
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,899
It's a love letter.

729
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,803
What does it say?

730
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,541
One second.

731
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,273
Hey, you! Give me that!

732
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,181
"My dearest Jean.

733
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:28,222
"The letters J-E-A-N used to spell
out just another word for denim."

734
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,516
This guy is great, Mom.

735
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,263
"But, since I found you, I
hear those four-letter words...

736
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,891
"and all I think about is
another four-letter-word:

737
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,667
"Love. L-O-V-E."

738
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,601
Love?
Yeah.

739
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,268
He loves you?
That's what he said.

740
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,973
Zoe, he's trying
to be romantic.

741
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,779
"Being near you is like
standing on a triple word score."

742
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,183
He plays Scrabble.

743
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,885
"Everything matters
three times as much.

744
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,787
"The sun shines three times
as bright...

745
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,883
"and I am three times
as happy."

746
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,390
What's this?

747
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,995
He gave you a present?
I like him now.

748
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,432
Smart, witty, romantic.

749
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,299
You can't still think
this guy is Lenny, right?

750
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:20,673
It is kind of hard to picture
Lenny playing Scrabble.

751
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,384
Come on, Mom, let's dance.

752
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,631
You go, Mom!

753
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:51,797
Mom.

754
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,313
No!
Come on.

755
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,002
I can't believe it.

756
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,346
And he sent you
a present, too?

757
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,284
Yeah, a CD of a band I'd
never heard of, but I loved.

758
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,049
It's like he knows me better
than I know myself.

759
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,590
So why is he hiding?

760
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,227
He's not hiding. He's just... Just what?

761
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,454
Excuse me? Can you help me?

762
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,960
Dinner's ready.

763
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,112
There must be something wrong
with him.

764
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,515
Who?
Mr. Wonderful.

765
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,919
What? No, there's nothing
wrong with him. He's perfect.

766
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,684
Then why all the secrecy?

767
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:17,090
Why doesn't he just come on over,
show his face, and say hello?

768
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,026
Like a normal person.

769
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,461
Listen to yourself.

770
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,863
The man wants to be
the least bit romantic...

771
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,924
and all of sudden you think
he's not normal.

772
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:28,199
How do I know if he is? And if
he is, what does he look like?

773
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,705
Is he tall, is he short?

774
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,209
Does he have blond, curly hair,
straight, black hair, what?

775
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,745
I bet he has a big,
fat wart on his nose.

776
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,175
I bet that he's really,
really handsome.

777
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,717
And how would you know?

778
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,446
He writes like
he's really handsome.

779
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,149
Honey, have you seen pictures
of Shakespeare? Bald, skinny.

780
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,415
Does that
even really matter?

781
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,688
Yes. Because you can't have
a relationship with a man...

782
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,787
you've never laid eyes on.

783
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:00,203
Honey, I've got a party of 50
coming in a half an hour.

784
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,760
It will only
take a second.

785
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,307
Oh, You can take my picture.
Just be sure to get my good side.

786
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:08,004
Over here, Brad Pitt. Over
here, David Spade, not so cute.

787
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,543
No, I'm just swamped,
I'm sorry.

788
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:15,549
Hey, Uncle Ben, what's that stuff
you put on top of your spinach salad?

789
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,883
Parmesan what?
Cheese.

790
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,354
Ben. It's a nice name.

791
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,829
Uncomplicated.
Dependable. Ben.

792
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,492
And it's way better than Lenny.
And he's way cuter than Lenny.

793
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,797
Don't you be mean about
Lenny. He's a good egg.

794
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,804
Just not the egg for me.

795
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:38,364
I like this egg. I want
this egg to be my boyfriend.

796
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,411
When's he coming over?
As soon as he gets back.

797
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,070
Well, where did he go?

798
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,638
He's opening up a new
restaurant in China.

799
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,617
And the phone lines there
are impossible, evidently.

800
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,382
So as soon as he gets back,
he's going to call.

801
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:54,015
Cool. What else
does the letter say?

802
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:57,625
That's private.
Excuse me.

803
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,721
China.

804
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,494
How are we ever going
to get a stamp from China?

805
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:04,556
We won't.

806
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,660
Now that he's traveling,
he asked her to send...

807
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,500
her e-mail address
to his e-mail address.

808
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:09,937
He has
an e-mail address?

809
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,343
Brooklyn Boy, this new
account that I'm setting up.

810
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,437
Well, at least it's consistent,
since everyone lies in cyberspace.

811
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,210
But we can't use the computer at
my house in case my mom finds it.

812
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,946
I'd offer ours, except
my brother's on 24l7...

813
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,682
buying those
little Yu-Gi-Oh cards on eBay.

814
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,284
Who else?

815
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,325
It's kind of messy.

816
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,564
It's kind of dark.

817
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,299
Oh, yeah.

818
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,670
Should be on.

819
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,481
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

820
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,883
You must think that I'm crazy, but
at least my mom's happy, you know.

821
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,049
It's such a change...

822
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,854
'cause she usually spends most of
her time depressed or with idiots.

823
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,291
Maybe I should try it.

824
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,387
My mom only smiles once a month
when the alimony check comes.

825
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:14,599
And if she's been dumped
a lot? Then what?

826
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,831
A lot?

827
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,065
That's a tough one.

828
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,172
I guess the perfect guy
would be...

829
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,346
He could be anywhere
in the world...

830
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,007
but he chooses
to be with her because...

831
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,910
life is better with her
by his side.

832
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:39,886
Dear Passionate Baker...

833
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,761
I'm spending my days with
very serious business people...

834
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,802
and I know I should be listening
to every word they say...

835
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,359
But all I keep thinking is...

836
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:49,268
what am I doing
all the way in China?

837
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:52,638
Unbelievable. Listen to this.
Come on. Let's go.

838
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,733
It's from Ben.

839
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,042
"I planned this restaurant
before I'd ever laid eyes on you.

840
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,581
"If I had to do it over...

841
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,846
"I'd buy the building right
next to yours and open there."

842
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,282
He'd rather be with me.

843
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,261
Why don't you write him back?

844
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:12,751
Good.

845
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,261
Excuse me.

846
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:21,964
Dear Brooklyn Boy...

847
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,030
if your food's half as good
as your letters...

848
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:27,406
nothing would make me happier than
having your restaurant on my block.

849
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,570
But I'd hate to deprive
the nation of China...

850
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:33,946
of that kind of satisfaction. So
open your restaurant there first.

851
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,812
Dear Passionate Baker...

852
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,117
as long as
I'm in the kitchen cooking...

853
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,487
it doesn't matter where I am.

854
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,963
It's a real specific kind
of satisfaction, isn't it...

855
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,224
cooking for people?

856
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:51,597
I'm only a baker, but I put as
much creativity and passion...

857
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,728
into my cakes
as a painter puts on a canvas.

858
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:58,702
Granted, when all's said and
done, all I've made is a cake.

859
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,300
But then again, you can't eat
the Mona Lisa.

860
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,110
Waiting, the Passionate Baker.

861
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,075
Dear Passionate Baker...

862
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,310
creativity and passion, huh?

863
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,682
I'm starting to figure out
what makes you tick.

864
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,453
And as for the Mona Lisa...

865
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,390
after a few thousand years...

866
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,452
people are going to get tired
of her smile.

867
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,191
But a good fudge brownie
is eternal.

868
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:23,928
Dear Brooklyn Boy...

869
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:26,435
I'm modest about some things,
but not this.

870
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:29,529
I make the best fudge brownies
on the planet.

871
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,096
Well, it just so happens...

872
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:33,039
I make the best
homemade ice cream.

873
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,135
Ice cream and brownies.

874
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,878
Now that's a good combo.
That's all I'm looking for.

875
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,311
My own good combo.

876
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,553
Someone I can bring out
the best in...

877
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,145
and someone that brings out
the best in me.

878
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:50,542
How you doing?

879
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,779
Surprise, surprise.

880
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:56,258
Lenny, there's something
I need to tell you.

881
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,552
We don't need words.

882
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:02,291
I know what you're going to say.
And I feel the exact same way.

883
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,532
No, this is important
for me to say.

884
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,403
I met someone...
"And his name is Lenny...

885
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,998
"and he's rocking my world."
I know.

886
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,908
And I know you're scared.
I'm scared, too.

887
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:18,311
But I also know if the
world turned upside down...

888
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:21,283
baby, I know you'd always
be around my mind.

889
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,013
The best of times.

890
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,888
These are "the best of times."

891
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,623
I met someone else.

892
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,020
What?

893
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:36,065
I mean, I didn't meet
someone, but I might.

894
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,967
But the perfect man is standing
right here, next to my cuddles.

895
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,165
Lenny, I'm sorry.
I really am.

896
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,003
You are a great guy.

897
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,341
I'm sorry this wasn't...

898
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:52,340
"the best of times."

899
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:01,918
# These are
the worst of times ##

900
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,057
Hey.

901
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:15,298
I'm in the middle of writing my mom
an e-mail and she just logged on.

902
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,164
IM her.
Should I?

903
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,267
Yeah, It will make Ben
seem more real, won't it?

904
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,078
Okay.

905
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,916
Fancy running into you here.

906
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,690
What time is it there?

907
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:47,492
Late.

908
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,372
I thought it would be morning.

909
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,842
It is. Late morning.

910
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,546
What are you doing?

911
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,520
Just thinking.

912
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:10,624
About what?

913
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,423
You'd be bored.

914
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:17,928
Try me.

915
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,993
If I stop replying,
you'll know I fell asleep.

916
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:32,047
Well, I have kids.
Have I mentioned that?

917
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,410
No. That's great.

918
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:41,589
Two daughters.
Seven and sixteen.

919
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,418
They're lucky to have you
as a mom.

920
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,769
You are the only person
on earth who would say that.

921
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,569
And it's just because
you haven't met me.

922
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,900
I've made
so many mistakes.

923
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,081
Everyone makes mistakes.

924
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:11,277
Yeah, well, I make
whoppers, over and over...

925
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,618
and my kids are the ones
who suffer.

926
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,214
It's not fair.

927
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,392
This wasn't the plan,
you know.

928
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,964
I had a big future in mind
when I was younger.

929
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,558
I was going to be
a famous baker.

930
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,160
Like Julia Child,
but with desserts.

931
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,297
I was going to go
to a fancy cooking school.

932
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,704
Write cookbooks.

933
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,608
Make people fall in love
with baking again.

934
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:37,143
I had
all the applications, too.

935
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:45,884
I was in the middle of filling them
out when I learned I was pregnant.

936
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,083
I thought
it was good news.

937
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:51,525
A baby fit into my
happily-ever-after plan just fine.

938
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:54,395
But it didn't fit
into the guy's.

939
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,894
Or maybe it was me
that didn't fit.

940
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,129
Whichever. I was on my own.

941
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,907
So you had your kid instead
of fulfilling your dream.

942
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,070
I guess I did.

943
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:21,985
If you had to do it all over, would
you have gone to school instead?

944
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:28,989
Life definitely would have
been easier if I'd done that.

945
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,295
Gotten my act together first.

946
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,963
Had kids later.
But those kids...

947
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,564
wouldn't be Holly
and Zoe.

948
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,844
And life without Holly and
Zoe, I can't even imagine it.

949
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,374
It's just no life at all.

950
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,993
Special message...

951
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,522
to all you bloggers out there
being raised by single moms.

952
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,735
Give the old lady a break.

953
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:42,033
She's doing the best she can.

954
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:53,940
Yeah.

955
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,382
Okay, one cherry cake.

956
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,443
Yeah,
that would be great.

957
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,216
$12.99. Thanks.

958
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,985
Thank you. Bye.

959
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,128
Can I help you?

960
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,932
Attention, shoppers.

961
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,896
Need a little pick-me-up?

962
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,236
Why don't you head on over
to our coffee corner...

963
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:22,972
and pick yourself up a
half-caf caramel macchiato?

964
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,611
But remember,
coffee can be hot.

965
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,343
It can have an intensity
like you've never felt before.

966
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,684
Searing deep into your flesh.

967
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:35,952
Is he joking?

968
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,823
Your tender, vulnerable...

969
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,061
so-easily-hurt flesh.

970
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,534
So be sure to ask for a protective
sleeve when you pick up your coffee.

971
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:51,835
Maybe ask for another one
to slip over your heart.

972
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,309
Thank you.

973
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,821
And I bought these butterfly
clips so that you can use it...

974
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,857
and clip the braids back.
But don't pull.

975
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,323
Okay.
It hurts.

976
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:13,021
Okay, I'm taking Zoe to her play date,
then I'm going to Gloria's shower.

977
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,495
Don't burn the place down.

978
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:15,963
Wow. Look at you.

979
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:17,731
Where they having it,
at the Ritz?

980
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:18,961
Close to it.

981
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,526
Some whoop-de-do spot
named the River Bistro.

982
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,969
No!
Ow!

983
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,769
Isn't that way over
everybody's budget?

984
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:30,108
Yeah, but Gloria's cousin's wife
works with their dairy guy...

985
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,011
and he got her a deal
on the party room.

986
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,015
I heard the food's
really bad there.

987
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,780
Everyone who eats there gets
really sick. Vomiting for days.

988
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:42,215
I'll take my chances.
Let's go, sweetie.

989
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,725
Where is he?
I don't know.

990
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,821
Maybe the restaurant.
Maybe home.

991
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:51,423
Okay, you go to the restaurant.
I'm going to go to his place.

992
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,493
If I see him, I'll stall
him. Now, what's his address?

993
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:58,471
"To begin again in Egypt."

994
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,210
Seven letters.

995
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,907
Oh, The Times thinks
they're so clever.

996
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,418
Hello?
Hey, thank God you're here.

997
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:20,190
Who is this?
It's Holly.

998
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:23,197
Who?
Amy's friend, Holly.

999
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:27,330
Oh, Holly. Yeah, well,
Amy's not here.

1000
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,803
I know. I came
to see you, actually.

1001
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,841
It's something
really important.

1002
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:35,537
Okay. I'll buzz you in.

1003
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,546
The door's open up here.

1004
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:44,446
Hi.
Hey, straight ahead.

1005
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,817
Hey.
Hi.

1006
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:54,956
Wow!

1007
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,359
This is the most
amazing kitchen...

1008
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,333
I've ever seen
in my whole entire life.

1009
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,131
Really?
Yeah.

1010
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,398
Thanks.

1011
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:06,275
I know someone that would
just kill for this kitchen.

1012
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:10,539
I bet Amber likes it a lot, huh? Amber?

1013
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:13,582
Well, she's got her finger
on everything I do...

1014
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,050
but not this kitchen.

1015
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,947
How about you have a seat
and I'll get you a soda?

1016
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,788
Is that okay?
Okay.

1017
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,008
You do The Times crossword
in pen?

1018
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,168
Yeah. Is that
a bad thing?

1019
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,706
How do you feel
about the moon?

1020
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:47,772
Excuse me?

1021
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,977
Do you think that it's
a little piece of magic...

1022
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,419
that comes out every night,
even when times get hard...

1023
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:55,616
to remind you that every day
holds potential for beauty?

1024
00:59:57,126 --> 01:00:00,493
What has Amy told you about me? Nothing.

1025
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,656
She just said
that you were really smart.

1026
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,723
And I'm new to town.

1027
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,462
It's a new school.

1028
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:09,705
I don't really have a dad
to turn to for advice, either.

1029
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,002
So thought I'd ask you.

1030
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,376
Well, all right.
I guess I can try to help.

1031
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,973
I'm not really a,
you know...

1032
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,953
What did you
want to know?

1033
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,112
It's nothing.

1034
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:28,749
It's just, I'm going through
my teenage years.

1035
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,122
And that's confusing.

1036
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:33,594
I'm confused about who I am
and what my purpose is in life.

1037
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,221
What college I should go to.

1038
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,822
If I should even go
to college.

1039
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,595
I'm trying to resist peer pressure
to do all sorts of things...

1040
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:43,161
that I know that I shouldn't do, but
some of them I kind of want to do.

1041
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,331
If you know what I mean.

1042
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,932
I'm considering getting my nose
pierced and my belly button...

1043
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,307
and nine other parts
of my body.

1044
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,608
But my mom said she would
totally kill me if I did that...

1045
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,944
so now I'm just thinking about
getting a tattoo on my back.

1046
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:54,916
But it wouldn't be
really considered my back...

1047
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,316
because it would be so low that
you wouldn't be able to see it.

1048
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:01,255
Unless I wore my jeans low
enough. I'm really confused.

1049
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,326
Where?

1050
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,395
Yeah?
Ben.

1051
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,304
Yeah? We got big problems down here.

1052
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,343
Huge, massive.
What?

1053
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:24,471
The pilot light on that big thing
that cooks the food? It's out again.

1054
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:28,577
No, it can't be broken. I
just bought it two months ago.

1055
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:33,381
Ben, I am telling you, the only gas
I'm smelling is coming from Pablo.

1056
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:34,982
Okay.

1057
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,485
Calm down.
I'm coming right now. Goodbye.

1058
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:43,226
Holly, I got a problem at the
restaurant, so I have to go.

1059
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:46,291
No, you can't!
Why not?

1060
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:51,567
I mean, can I come?
Yeah, why not? Come on.

1061
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,634
I've got to go to the bathroom
really bad.

1062
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,873
Yeah, well, go.

1063
01:01:57,947 --> 01:01:59,812
There's the bathroom there,
but hurry up.

1064
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,281
Right there
through that door.

1065
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:03,251
I love this.

1066
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:07,285
You have got to be
kidding me.

1067
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:09,586
This isn't going
to cover anything.

1068
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,058
That's exactly
the point.

1069
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,656
Houston, we have a problem.

1070
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,466
What kind?
The very, very bad kind.

1071
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,127
He's on his way
to the restaurant now.

1072
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,830
Oh, my God!
What do we do?

1073
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,568
Create a distraction.
A really, really big one.

1074
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:29,068
I'll see you there. Bye.

1075
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:41,216
Do we have to take a cab?
I hate cabs.

1076
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,349
Maybe we should walk.
What are you, crazy?

1077
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,589
We're going to the River
Bistro. I get carsick.

1078
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:57,669
Boys!

1079
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,907
Come on,
get your free beer.

1080
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,117
Free beer!

1081
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,486
Bring on the beer.

1082
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:20,860
Yeah, bring on the Beer.

1083
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:25,558
Look, it's time for
your break. Bye-bye.

1084
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:29,731
Hi! How are you?
Good.

1085
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,774
Some sort of Village People
convention in town?

1086
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:34,002
We saw the sign outside
and we want the free beer.

1087
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:38,775
Free beer? Why would I give
you... I'd give you free beer.

1088
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,213
You look absolutely parched.

1089
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:45,816
Thanks a lot, my friend.

1090
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,795
I think I'm going to need
another mimosa...

1091
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,229
to open the rest
of these gifts.

1092
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:58,062
I'll get the waiter.

1093
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,161
Lance!

1094
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,365
Hi, Mom.
What are you doing here?

1095
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:06,169
I just, I miss you.

1096
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:07,903
Free...
Lance!

1097
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,343
What is this?
What, nothing.

1098
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,244
Is this your idea?
No.

1099
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,612
No, I would never do...

1100
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,618
Well, actually I would do
that, but I didn't do it.

1101
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,154
Why didn't I?
The sign says free beer.

1102
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,712
We want our free beer. Yeah.

1103
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,657
J-E-T-S! Jets!

1104
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,825
What's that?

1105
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,156
Look! What a neat gift!

1106
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,731
I feel like a queen.

1107
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:37,699
Fellows, we're not a sports bar,
but one free beer on the house...

1108
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:40,970
but that's it.
Free beer!

1109
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:44,870
You're a Jets fan, right?

1110
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:48,110
Oh my God, hello!
I live for West Side Story.

1111
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:50,778
Pablo, what happened?
I don't know.

1112
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:53,254
Now, these are
brand new stoves.

1113
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,085
What about the pizza oven?
Try it.

1114
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,681
Okay, I am getting
the waiter.

1115
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,249
Does anyone want anything
besides mimosas?

1116
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,352
That's working. It's got
to be the gas line, right?

1117
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,522
Champagne.
White wine.

1118
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:04,793
What happened?
It's not lighting?

1119
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,994
What are you doing?
Sorry.

1120
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,503
Mom! I'm going to
get the waiter.

1121
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,699
Why don't you sit here
and enjoy your lunch?

1122
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,174
Pablo, keep working on it.
I got to call.

1123
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,870
Waiter! Excuse me.

1124
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,503
I'm calling
from the River Bistro.

1125
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,377
We have a problem here.
I need someone right away.

1126
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:21,882
This isn't working.
I know, what do we do?

1127
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,145
Think.

1128
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:26,651
Go stall.

1129
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:34,857
Put this on here.

1130
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,627
It's so much more fun if you
accessorize with color. Lance.

1131
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,832
Please, please forgive me.

1132
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:57,718
I don't know.
I got to make sure that...

1133
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:01,087
Front door, everyone.

1134
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:04,048
Floor's wet.
Be careful, don't run.

1135
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:07,790
Don't panic.
Front door. Don't panic.

1136
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,523
Everybody out the front door.

1137
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,031
Where's Holly? Holly?

1138
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,822
We may be in big
trouble, but that rocked!

1139
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:41,055
I swear the CIA
should hire us.

1140
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,064
Nobody saw anybody.

1141
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:46,257
I mean, are we great,
or what?

1142
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,565
Your uncle does
crossword puzzles in pen.

1143
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,099
What?

1144
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:56,673
And his kitchen is,
it's perfect.

1145
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,173
So?

1146
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,815
You know even though
he didn't say it out loud...

1147
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:03,909
I know that he knows that
the moon isn't just a rock.

1148
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,255
What are you
talking about?

1149
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:10,849
There is such a thing
as the perfect man.

1150
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:13,691
And I know exactly
who it is for my mom.

1151
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,754
Who?
Your Uncle Ben.

1152
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:16,957
What?

1153
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,594
And now because of my stupid
scheme, they can never meet.

1154
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:24,400
I'm so beyond lost.

1155
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,200
You were right.

1156
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,368
I should have never bought
that orchid.

1157
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,810
The whole thing was
just a huge mistake.

1158
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,044
Hey.

1159
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:41,646
I need to ask you
a huge favor.

1160
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,884
Hi to you, too.

1161
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:45,188
I need you to break up
with my mom for me.

1162
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,229
When did I start
dating her?

1163
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:49,628
Not as you. As the perfect man, Ben.

1164
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,197
No way.

1165
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:54,526
Come on. Please.

1166
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:59,170
Just call her at 7:00, put on a
deep voice and tell her it's over.

1167
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,640
What's my reason?

1168
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:03,507
Men never have reasons.
They just split.

1169
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,940
Why can't you just
break up over e-mail?

1170
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,813
Because that's too cold.

1171
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,875
Besides, I want her
to hear his voice.

1172
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:12,443
Yeah, but it wouldn't be
his voice.

1173
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,422
It would be mine, what with
him not existing and all.

1174
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:18,483
Come on, you know what
I mean. Please, Adam.

1175
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,927
If I tell her that this was
all fake, she'll be crushed.

1176
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:22,395
And she'll never
forgive me.

1177
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:25,400
But if he just dumps her,
that she's used to.

1178
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,105
Hello?

1179
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:42,412
There's no way I'm doing this.
May I ask who's calling?

1180
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:44,749
Holly, can we just talk about it? Sure.

1181
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:48,119
Mom, it's for you.
No, no, it's not funny.

1182
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,624
Hello.
Hi!

1183
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:55,697
This is Ben calling.

1184
01:08:55,764 --> 01:09:00,133
Ben?
As in "Ben" Ben?

1185
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:04,138
I don't know.

1186
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:08,267
How many Bens do you know?
None.

1187
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,312
I mean, one.
I know you.

1188
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,043
Wow.

1189
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:17,077
How is China?

1190
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:18,942
China.

1191
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:23,018
It's very Chinese.

1192
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,128
Lots of Chinese people.

1193
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,726
Chinese food.

1194
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,367
You're funny.

1195
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,230
And you're calling me...

1196
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,061
from halfway
around the world.

1197
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:41,140
Yes, because there's something
that I wanted to tell...

1198
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:44,576
It's really good
to finally hear your voice.

1199
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:48,774
Wait. Are you crying?

1200
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,312
No.

1201
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,310
God, yes.

1202
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:57,415
Yes, I am, but only because I'm happy.

1203
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:00,594
You make me happy.

1204
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,992
Know what I mean?

1205
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,566
I guess.

1206
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:10,594
Yeah, I do.

1207
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,068
God, my whole life...

1208
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:17,874
I mean, everything's been
so messed up...

1209
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:23,476
and I just started getting to know
you, and I don't know, I just...

1210
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,348
I started feeling just...

1211
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,924
Clearer.
Yes!

1212
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:34,053
Yes. You know what I mean.
Yeah, I do.

1213
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:38,194
It's like all of the bad
stuff that you went through...

1214
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,864
that you hated
along the way...

1215
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:42,563
the people
who disappointed you...

1216
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:45,402
the things that didn't go
the way you wanted.

1217
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:49,706
Suddenly you feel grateful to
them because they're the things...

1218
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:52,542
that got you to here.
To this.

1219
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:55,743
Yes. Exactly.

1220
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:59,379
I guess that's just what's
it like when you, you know...

1221
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:00,547
No.

1222
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:01,749
What?

1223
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:06,383
Really like someone.

1224
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,356
So, you like me?

1225
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,127
Yeah. Yeah.

1226
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,832
I do. I mean I might even...

1227
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:27,012
You might even what?

1228
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:33,612
Give me a ride, horsey!
No. Not now, Zoe.

1229
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:36,156
I might even...

1230
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,486
Holly!

1231
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:39,961
Love you.

1232
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:41,855
Hello?

1233
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:43,765
Hello?

1234
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:52,596
Hey!

1235
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,002
What were you thinking?

1236
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:57,477
That isn't even close
to what I asked you to do.

1237
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,639
I got distracted.

1238
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,842
By what? A lobotomy?

1239
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,784
Because short of that, short of
you telling me that somebody came...

1240
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:08,016
and actually removed your
brain, I can't even begin to...

1241
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,722
By you.

1242
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,756
I was distracted by you.

1243
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:36,410
Hey, Mom?
Yeah?

1244
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,554
Do you remember
when we first got here...

1245
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:43,892
and you were feeling
so lousy?

1246
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:45,988
What about it?

1247
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:48,793
Well, the thing is...

1248
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,833
I just hated seeing you
like that. And...

1249
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,769
# Lady, when you're with me
I'm smiling #

1250
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:03,510
# Give me your love #

1251
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:10,717
# Your hands build me up
when I'm sinking #

1252
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:17,551
# Touch me
and my troubles all fade #

1253
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:18,718
Will you shut up?

1254
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:19,886
No way.

1255
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:24,899
# Lady, from the moment
I saw you #

1256
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:26,829
I'm sorry.

1257
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:32,139
# Standing all alone #

1258
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:33,973
Rock out, buddy!

1259
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:39,213
# You gave all the love
that I needed #

1260
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:46,350
# So shy, like a child
who had grown #

1261
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:50,486
# You're my lady #

1262
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:54,420
# Of the morning #

1263
01:13:55,831 --> 01:14:00,427
# Love shines in your... #

1264
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:07,807
# Sparkling clear and lovely #

1265
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:09,971
# You're my #

1266
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,205
What are you...

1267
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:16,847
# Lady ##

1268
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:20,883
Encore! Sweet!
Very good.

1269
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:24,523
Hey, take it easy.

1270
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,116
Marry me?

1271
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:26,991
Marry him!

1272
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,604
Oh, God, please tell me
that you didn't say yes.

1273
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:43,873
Please tell me that you said
no. I said I'd think about it.

1274
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:46,506
What? What is there
to think about?

1275
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:50,374
Is there even a jewel
in there?

1276
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:54,620
Lenny is not your soul mate.
Ben is.

1277
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:57,357
Ben is in China. Maybe.

1278
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,291
I mean, who really knows?

1279
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:02,453
The only thing I know for sure
about Ben is he is a beautiful idea.

1280
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:05,466
But you can't grow old
with a beautiful idea.

1281
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,864
Why are you so desperate?

1282
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:13,134
Oh, Holly, it is so easy
for you to judge.

1283
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,307
You haven't had to go
through life alone with kids.

1284
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:18,107
Nobody to turn to for help.

1285
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,341
I'm not complaining.
I made my bed.

1286
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:24,518
But I have been slugging it out
alone for a heck of a long time.

1287
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,422
You two girls are the best
thing that's ever happened to me.

1288
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,288
In the blink of an eye,
you'll be grown and gone.

1289
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:35,563
And Lenny's a sweet guy. Maybe
he'll be different than the others.

1290
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,258
I don't want to wind up alone.

1291
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,820
Do not unlock that door
till I get back.

1292
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:25,640
Hello.

1293
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:30,508
Hi, I'm calling
for Miss Jean Hamilton.

1294
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,509
Yes, this is Jean.

1295
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:35,056
This is Ben's secretary. Ben's
coming back into New York...

1296
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:36,988
and he would like
to see you.

1297
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,789
Really?
How's tomorrow afternoon...

1298
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,886
under the Brooklyn Bridge
sound?

1299
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,998
Excellent. 4:00.
He'll see you then.

1300
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:29,237
Where's Ben? I need to talk
to him. It's an emergency.

1301
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,108
Oh, Too late, little lady.
He's already gone.

1302
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:33,807
Where?
The almighty wedding.

1303
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:35,577
Wedding? What wedding?

1304
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,884
Well, Amber and...
Amber?

1305
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:38,942
Amber?

1306
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:41,046
I know. He didn't
really want to do it...

1307
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:42,351
but she's hard to say no to.

1308
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,652
Where is it?

1309
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,827
Liberty Grand Hotel.
Thanks.

1310
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:48,586
So not a party without me.

1311
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:51,126
Whatever.

1312
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,311
Sorry, guys.

1313
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:14,283
We are gathered here
in the sight of God...

1314
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,983
and in the face
of this company...

1315
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:20,323
to join together this man
and this woman...

1316
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,966
If anyone present...

1317
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:30,198
knows a reason why these two
should not be lawfully wedded...

1318
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:34,734
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1319
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:36,205
He can't marry her!

1320
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,412
What are you doing?
You can't come in here.

1321
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:51,052
He's got to marry my mom.

1322
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,923
You might not even know it yet,
but you will once you read these.

1323
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:55,928
Holly.

1324
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:59,125
It's pages and pages of proof
that you guys are soul mates...

1325
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:02,295
and right now she's waiting to
meet you under the Brooklyn Bridge.

1326
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:06,170
And when you do, you'll know that
you guys are perfect for each other.

1327
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:09,743
You guys both
do the crosswords in pen...

1328
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:12,837
and know what a kitchen should feel
like and what the moon really is.

1329
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:17,180
And without even meeting her,
you picked out her favorite song.

1330
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,947
And it's made her happier
than she's ever been. And...

1331
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,707
You know what,
you guys?

1332
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:48,406
I'm looking for
the Silverman wedding.

1333
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,776
Sorry. Carry on.
My bad.

1334
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,611
David, I'm so sorry.

1335
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:56,213
Son, are you all right?

1336
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,656
Holly!

1337
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:03,262
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake, okay?

1338
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:06,129
Well, that's just the
understatement of the year.

1339
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:07,498
What are you thinking?

1340
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:09,434
I thought you were
the one marrying Amber.

1341
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:11,369
Me?
Lance said...

1342
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:12,906
No! Amber's one
of my dearest friends.

1343
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,965
I'm catering her wedding.

1344
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,137
What's left of it.

1345
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:20,874
What are you doing?
Read these.

1346
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,940
No, that's not an answer.
Yes, it is.

1347
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:25,987
If you'd just read
these e-mails, you'll see.

1348
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:28,988
There's someone
that you need to meet.

1349
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:54,282
Hi, Mom.
What are you doing here?

1350
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:58,480
I didn't want you to
think you'd been stood up.

1351
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:01,452
He's not coming.
What?

1352
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,856
How do you know? How did
you even know I was here?

1353
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,427
I know, because...

1354
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:08,357
Because?

1355
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:11,523
Because I made him up.

1356
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:13,423
What?

1357
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:16,766
The flowers and the letters
and the e-mails and everything.

1358
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:24,602
The phone call? A
friend of mine did that.

1359
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:29,248
But it wasn't all made up.
There was a man. There is.

1360
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:31,245
Most of what I wrote
came from him.

1361
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,219
So there's a man out there
laughing at me, too?

1362
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:34,983
No! He doesn't know.
He thought...

1363
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,081
How could you be
so cruel?

1364
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,454
I wasn't trying to be cruel.

1365
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,555
I was trying
to make you happy.

1366
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,591
Well, you have a lot
to learn about happiness.

1367
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:49,660
You haven't exactly
showed me a road map, Mom.

1368
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,196
Oh, so this is my fault. I
brought this humiliation on myself.

1369
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:55,402
What? Because we moved
around a little bit?

1370
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:57,570
A little?
Whatever. A lot.

1371
01:21:57,646 --> 01:21:59,011
You never seemed to mind.

1372
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:03,141
Yes, I did. You just never heard
any of it if it wasn't about you.

1373
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:06,347
That is not true. I hear
everything you say to me.

1374
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,685
You hear,
but you don't listen.

1375
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:11,152
You never listen
to anything I want.

1376
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:15,757
All right, fine.
What do you want?

1377
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:21,233
I want a mom that sees in herself
what Zoe and I see every day.

1378
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:26,539
That's talented
and pretty and funny...

1379
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,104
and cooks great
and dances great...

1380
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:31,975
and doesn't need a man
to be those things.

1381
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:35,105
Okay, so maybe
the perfect man wasn't real.

1382
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:38,117
But the perfect you is.

1383
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:06,410
S-l-L-E-N-C-E.

1384
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:21,719
Hi.

1385
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:24,487
Hi.

1386
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,728
I'm sorry that I didn't
call you back.

1387
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:30,430
I've been really busy.
I drew you something.

1388
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,642
"Princess Holly."

1389
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:38,804
Well, a side of her anyway.

1390
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,747
I realized she doesn't
need an army to protect her.

1391
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:46,813
You don't let anybody close enough
to hurt you in the first place.

1392
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,284
Wait. Holly!

1393
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:04,834
I want to move.
What?

1394
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:06,396
I hate this place.

1395
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:08,635
I'm over it,
and I want to move now.

1396
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,271
We've moved more times for
you than I can even count.

1397
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:15,111
And just this once,
I want to move for me.

1398
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:01,021
Hi. Hi, I'm Adam. Holly's friend.

1399
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,529
Is she home?

1400
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,792
No, she's out
getting packing boxes.

1401
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:07,227
Why?

1402
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:09,998
We're moving.
Arizona. Red Rocks.

1403
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,267
You want her to call?

1404
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:15,569
No.

1405
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,247
Thank you.

1406
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:23,574
Could you give this to her?

1407
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:24,811
Sure.

1408
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:28,219
And tell her she only saw
one side of the drawing.

1409
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:35,583
I was inspired.

1410
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:42,820
I miss you.

1411
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:45,663
Why did you bug out
on me?

1412
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:03,874
Newsflash.

1413
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:06,014
Everyone's scared.

1414
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:09,248
That's no reason
to run away.

1415
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:16,927
It's what my mom does.

1416
01:27:20,268 --> 01:27:23,328
And you want to end up
like your mom?

1417
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:25,570
Some role model.

1418
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:44,685
I heard once that...

1419
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:49,286
Iove is friendship on fire.

1420
01:27:51,132 --> 01:27:52,963
That's how I feel
about you.

1421
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,499
Do you really have
to go?

1422
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:54,120
Holly, guess what?
I get to be in a spelling bee.

1423
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,263
C-O-O-L.

1424
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,323
What are you doing?
Unpacking.

1425
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:01,057
Yeah, but why?

1426
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:04,430
I thought that we all agreed that
it was time for a new adventure.

1427
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:08,032
This is our new adventure.
Staying is our new adventure.

1428
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:09,470
What?

1429
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:13,044
Why can't you ever do
anything that I want?

1430
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:22,852
I want to be alone.

1431
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:25,723
Nobody wants to be alone.
I do.

1432
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:29,721
Okay, I'm through with these
people and I want new ones.

1433
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:37,368
Unfortunately, honey pie, new
people are only new for a day.

1434
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:40,232
After that,
they're just people.

1435
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:44,440
Who will excite you,
disappoint you...

1436
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,041
scare you a little bit.

1437
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:53,045
And, boy, I know how tempting it
is to run away when that happens.

1438
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:57,987
It's good for avoiding things.
But the problem is you end up...

1439
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,221
avoiding yourself.

1440
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:05,791
Avoiding people you love.

1441
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:11,196
You end up avoiding life.

1442
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:17,335
So, I've decided to start
setting an example for you girls.

1443
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:23,942
I'm going to try showing you
what sticking it out looks like.

1444
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:26,387
Really get to know people.

1445
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:28,755
And let people
get to know us.

1446
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:32,581
I don't promise to be any
good at it, but I will try.

1447
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:37,059
Because I want you and Zoe to
be better at this than I am.

1448
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:40,660
I want you to learn
how to let people in.

1449
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:59,453
He's a sweet boy. I think
it would be worth it.

1450
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:04,551
Turn it over. Everything
always has two sides.

1451
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:45,664
You want a bigger ring?

1452
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,729
Combustible.

1453
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:52,062
C-O-M-B...

1454
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,539
U-S-T...

1455
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:58,137
l-B-L-E.

1456
01:31:58,646 --> 01:31:59,806
Combustible.

1457
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:01,605
That is correct.

1458
01:32:09,423 --> 01:32:10,412
J!

1459
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:11,480
E!

1460
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:12,548
T!

1461
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:13,616
S!

1462
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:15,556
Jets! Jets! Jets!

1463
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:21,326
Looks like we're going
to the World Series.

1464
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,608
Ladies and gentlemen,
five minutes.

1465
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:31,008
Five minutes. We'll be
commencing in five minutes.

1466
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:36,638
First place goes to
Number 73, Jean Hamilton.

1467
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:40,585
You did it, Mommy!

1468
01:32:56,938 --> 01:32:58,303
Where? The second one?

1469
01:32:58,372 --> 01:33:00,033
Yeah, that's Mom.

1470
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:13,948
Hi, may I help you?

1471
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:17,513
Yeah, I heard that
you can find...

1472
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:19,787
the best fudge brownies
in the world here.

1473
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,489
We try.

1474
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:28,698
I'll take this.

1475
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:37,243
Ben.
Hi.

1476
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:41,705
On the house.

1477
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:44,250
No, I have to pay you
somehow.

1478
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,985
How about dinner?

1479
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:50,552
I don't even know you.

1480
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,593
Well, I don't know
about that.

1481
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,855
Thank you.
That is very sweet.

1482
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:59,356
But I don't think so.

1483
01:34:01,902 --> 01:34:04,530
Are you dating someone?
Actually, no.

1484
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:06,837
For the first time
in my life, I'm not.

1485
01:34:06,907 --> 01:34:08,738
And, and I think
I should stay this way...

1486
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:10,936
until I get my feet
back on the ground.

1487
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:12,639
I see. Yeah.

1488
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:15,546
It's nothing personal.
No, of course not.

1489
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:20,311
You know, I should probably
take a dating moratorium, too.

1490
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:21,480
I recommend it.

1491
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:23,819
Yeah, clean-out-the-closet
sort of thing.

1492
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:25,119
It's a good idea.

1493
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:27,126
You know,
get my head together and...

1494
01:34:27,194 --> 01:34:28,320
Exactly.

1495
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:40,099
So, pick you up Saturday
at 8:00?

1496
01:34:40,908 --> 01:34:42,273
Perfect.

1497
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:52,315
It looks like Mom was right.
Staying turned out to be...

1498
01:34:52,386 --> 01:34:54,411
the greatest adventure of all.

1499
01:34:54,488 --> 01:34:57,651
And let me tell you, it has
made me do some crazy things.

1500
01:34:58,325 --> 01:35:02,421
Like plan ahead and paint my room
and hang pictures on the wall.

1501
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:05,528
I mean, I used a nail
and everything.

1502
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:20,643
Hi, come on in.

1503
01:35:45,339 --> 01:35:46,636
Sorry I'm late.

1504
01:35:46,874 --> 01:35:50,571
There was this Krispy Kreme truck
that overturned on Eighth Avenue.

1505
01:35:58,652 --> 01:35:59,983
Thank you.

1506
01:36:06,494 --> 01:36:08,325
Here, let me deal
with that.

1507
01:36:09,797 --> 01:36:11,059
It goes...

1508
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:14,560
Relax. What is this? Like,
your first dance or something?

1509
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,611
Can you believe it?

1510
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:30,206
The Teenage Gypsy
has finally settled down.

1511
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:34,681
Now I don't just have a
homepage. I have a home.
