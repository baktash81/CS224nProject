00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:51,003
PET
SEMATARY

3
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:33,240
So many trees.

4
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,074
It's beautiful, right?

5
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:37,275
Well, it's definitely
not Boston.

6
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:39,206
No, it's not.

7
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:42,107
Mom, make him stop.
It's not fair to Church.

8
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:45,341
I'm pretty sure Church is okay.

9
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,408
It's not actually Church
that I'm worried about.

10
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,074
We've still got
another eight hours to go.

11
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:50,141
What?

12
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,408
Not funny, Dad.

13
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,275
That is so funny.

14
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:56,407
I got you good.

15
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,074
- Gage, did you find that funny?
- I thought it was funny.

16
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:38,311
What do you think?

17
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:41,711
- Wow.
- "Wow"? That's it?

18
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:43,710
It's pretty incredible,
don't you think?

19
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:45,578
I even got them
to throw in a whole forest

20
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,311
as a new backyard.

21
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:48,478
This whole place is ours?

22
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,610
This whole place
is the new domain

23
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:52,645
of Ellie-phant
the Great and Terrible.

24
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,244
I'll tell you what.

25
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:58,344
Do you want
to be the first inside?

26
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,678
Go, go, go.

27
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:05,279
The movers
were here all morning,

28
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:06,978
so everything
should be inside.

29
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,412
Good.

30
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:14,447
Son of a bitch. You okay?

31
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:17,281
Yeah, it just startled me
a little bit.

32
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,213
You okay, Gage?

33
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:22,513
- Big truck, huh?
- Who's a brave boy?

34
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:24,279
That was a big
truck, wasn't it?

35
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:28,679
Okay. You ready,
little man?

36
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:33,513
- Here we go. Come on.
- One, two, three!

37
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:34,412
Home.

38
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:35,946
Hmm.

39
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:38,481
Well, he adapted quickly.

40
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:42,313
What about you?
You ready for the country life, Doc?

41
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,246
Well, let's find out. Come on.

42
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:46,481
Mrs. Creed.

43
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:49,613
Wait, the cat's in the car!

44
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:02,248
This all happened
pretty fast. You gonna miss it?

45
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,448
I don't think anyone really misses
the graveyard shift in the ER.

46
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,015
I don't think that really
answered my question.

47
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,981
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

48
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,515
- Hey.
- Hmm?

49
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:17,813
You needed this.

50
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:21,715
We needed this.

51
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:24,650
I get to spend some more
time around the house

52
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,917
- with the kids.
- And your stay-at-home wifey.

53
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,681
- Ooh, I didn't even think about that.
- Yeah?

54
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,350
- I may have to rethink that.
- Oh, you will?

55
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:36,217
You stop that. Don't you do that.

56
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:38,150
Yeah...

57
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:51,116
Good morning, Marcella.

58
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,385
Ready for the storm?

59
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:53,951
We have someone already?

60
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,651
Bloody nose. Room 4.

61
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:58,284
Sounds serious.

62
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,517
Do you hear that?

63
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,686
What are they doing?

64
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:46,053
Looks like some
sort of procession.

65
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:51,587
What's a procession?

66
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:54,455
It's like a parade,
but not for fun.

67
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:08,388
Hey, let's go back inside
and watch a show.

68
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,587
I'm tired of unpacking boxes.

69
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,588
Sooner than that.

70
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,022
I mean, Ellie's birthday is
coming up in a few months.

71
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:51,357
Well, I don't know why you're worried, Mom.
No, everything's fine.

72
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,123
The kids are really happy.

73
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:55,590
Yeah.

74
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:57,357
No, it's nice
to slow down a little bit,

75
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,623
you know?

76
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,992
Hey, Mom, can I, uh...
Can I talk to you later?

77
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,856
Okay, love you. Bye.

78
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,924
Hey, Ellie, are you hungry?

79
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,128
Hey. You get down from there!

80
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:56,630
The trick is...

81
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,797
To get the stinger out
real quick.

82
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,798
Oh, she's a big 'un.

83
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,996
No prize winner...

84
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,231
But she'll do for a ribbon.

85
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:13,796
There you go.

86
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:15,364
Yeah.

87
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:18,364
Should be starting
to quiet down now.

88
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:20,398
You're the doctor's
little girl.

89
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,997
Eleanor Creed.
But you can call me Ellie.

90
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,264
I'm Judson Crandall.

91
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,665
You can call me Jud.

92
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:31,865
All right. Up you get.

93
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:38,831
- What is this place?
- Pet cemetery.

94
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,899
- Didn't you read the sign?
- Yeah. They spelled it wrong.

95
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,431
These are all people's pets?

96
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:50,233
Well, the whole town's been
using this place for generations.

97
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,331
I saw those kids.

98
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,200
They were all
wearing those masks.

99
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:54,666
Yeah.

100
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:58,734
A lot of folks make a
kind of ritual out of it.

101
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:02,300
See this one over here?
I carved this myself.

102
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:05,567
That's my dog, Biffer.

103
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:09,200
And it's true.
He was a hell of a sniffer.

104
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,566
Ellie?

105
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:17,933
You know better than to wander
off by yourself. Come here.

106
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:20,734
Mommy, this is Jud,
our neighbor.

107
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:22,067
I got stung by a bee.

108
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:25,201
He pulled the stinger out.
It was a big 'un.

109
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:27,200
Hmm. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

110
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:30,302
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm Rachel, Ellie's mom.

111
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:33,366
You know, these woods...

112
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,335
It's not really all that safe
to go roaming around in 'em.

113
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:41,069
People can get lost up here.

114
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:45,037
Thank you, Jud.
Um, we should get back, okay?

115
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:50,003
Honey, you can't
wander off like that.

116
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:52,234
I don't know where you are.
I can't do anything...

117
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:57,336
Just wash the mud off and rub
some baking soda on that sting.

118
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,401
<i>Jud...</i>

119
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:05,270
<i>Come back...</i>

120
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:17,970
- Dad?
- Yeah?

121
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:20,102
Why don't pets
live as long as people?

122
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:24,173
Well...

123
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:28,170
Do you remember that talk
we had about metabolism?

124
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:30,838
- The clock in your body?
- Yes.

125
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,138
Humans have
a slow metabolism,

126
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,404
a slow clock,
so we live longer.

127
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:38,604
Whereas cats and dogs...

128
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:40,537
Well, they have
a fast metabolism.

129
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:42,504
Which means,
when it runs out...

130
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:44,438
They die and go
to the pet cemetery.

131
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,339
Yeah.

132
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:48,872
Ellie discovered
a charming little landmark

133
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:51,306
in the woods today,
right in our backyard.

134
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:55,306
Okay. Well, that doesn't have to
be such a bad thing, does it? Hmm?

135
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,537
A place to bury our pets
and remember them.

136
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,171
It might seem scary, but it's not.
It's perfectly natural.

137
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:05,005
Just like dying
is natural. Hmm?

138
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:09,071
We all die and eventually,
one way or another,

139
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:10,940
we all go back
into the ground.

140
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:12,373
What Daddy's
trying to say

141
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,705
is that even though the pet's
body goes in the ground,

142
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:18,372
its soul keeps living
and goes to heaven.

143
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:21,440
Just like Nana Creed.

144
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:24,474
Remember how I told you
she's looking down on you?

145
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:25,740
Well, we don't
actually know

146
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:28,806
that it works
exactly like that.

147
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,374
What Mommy and Daddy
are trying to say

148
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,639
is that you don't have to worry about
this, sweetheart, okay?

149
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:36,675
Church and Mommy and me,
we're gonna be around a long, long time.

150
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:37,806
And Gage?

151
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:40,506
Of course, sweetie.
Gage is just a kid.

152
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:46,941
But what about
your sister, Mommy?

153
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:50,142
Wasn't she just a kid
when she died?

154
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:33,843
Rachel...

155
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,377
Rachel.

156
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,444
You okay?

157
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,909
What was that in there?

158
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,378
Funny, I wanted to ask you
the same thing.

159
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,277
Rachel, Ellie's
almost nine years old.

160
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,945
We should be able
to talk to her about this.

161
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:55,878
Ellie's a child.

162
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,244
And death for her is scary.

163
00:14:58,246 --> 00:15:00,146
Please, Rachel, doesn't mean
we should shield her from it.

164
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:02,277
And you think
that's what I'm doing?

165
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,212
I think that all this talk
about the afterlife,

166
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:09,144
about people
looking down on her,

167
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:11,412
I think...
Yeah, I think it's delaying

168
00:15:11,414 --> 00:15:14,147
getting to the heart
of the matter, yes.

169
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,148
So, you... You really don't
think there's anything

170
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:23,578
after we die?
No heaven, no nothing?

171
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:28,313
No.

172
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:32,714
Right. We're gonna take a swab
and run a test for strep.

173
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:34,414
It could be allergies,

174
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:36,668
but we just want to be sure.

175
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,879
Marcella, please tell me
it's almost lunch.

176
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:43,547
If I have to look at another
pair of swollen tonsils,

177
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,947
- I swear to God...
- Judy went out for sandwiches.

178
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,848
His head!

179
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,013
Victor, uh, Pascow.

180
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,748
It's Victor Pascow.
He's a student here.

181
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,181
He was skating and the
car just came out of nowhere!

182
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:57,080
- He got dragged.
- Call Life Flight to Bangor.

183
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,413
No time for an ambulance.

184
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,514
We need to get his blood type.
We'll need a lot of units.

185
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,115
We have to stabilize him
before we can transfer.

186
00:16:02,117 --> 00:16:03,148
He have
a medical bracelet on?

187
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,315
I didn't see anything, no.

188
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:06,448
I'm not gonna
let you die, Victor. Shit.

189
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,014
Type O-positive.
Pulling four units.

190
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:11,782
Great. Lie back, okay?
Just lie back. Lie back.

191
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:13,248
Let's hurry up
with those units, okay?

192
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,016
Kelly, we're gonna need to
fit him with a cervical collar

193
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:16,181
to get him lifted.

194
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,548
His brain. I can see it.

195
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,682
Kelly. Kelly, go!

196
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,715
Victor, please.

197
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:24,082
Where are we with those units?
He's losing a lot of blood!

198
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:29,750
No. No, no, no, Victor. No.
You stay with me, Victor.

199
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:32,816
You stay with me. I'm right here, Victor.
Stay right here...

200
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,550
Come...
Come back to me, Victor.

201
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,182
Come on.
Come back to me.

202
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:45,449
Come back. Come back.

203
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,350
God damn it.

204
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:34,820
Louis.

205
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:38,486
The barrier is not
meant to be broken.

206
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:41,419
Louis?

207
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:47,419
Uh, he's gone.

208
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:34,089
Hey.

209
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,722
What happened?

210
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,956
This poor kid
got hit by a car today

211
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,589
right on the campus.

212
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:59,156
He, uh, couldn't have been
more than 20 years old.

213
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,756
His name was Victor Pascow.

214
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,824
I sure wasn't expecting
to see any of that up here.

215
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:16,457
Why don't you come inside?

216
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:19,157
I'll make you some dinner.
You can take a shower. Okay?

217
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,623
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:26,592
He, uh, knew my name.

219
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:28,791
What?

220
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:30,726
He...

221
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:36,559
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

222
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:45,759
Jud? It's Ellie.
I made cookies.

223
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:48,192
Are you home?

224
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,660
You in the habit
of going through

225
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:42,302
other people's things?

226
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:45,595
Sorry.

227
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:48,029
Is that your wife?

228
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:51,229
Yeah. Her name was Norma.

229
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,599
She's pretty.

230
00:20:53,364 --> 00:20:54,595
What happened to her?

231
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:58,464
Got sick. Passed away.

232
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:02,097
Well, maybe she's
still out there.

233
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:04,097
You know,
watching from heaven?

234
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:06,096
You think so, Ellie?

235
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,530
Hey, want to come
meet my cat?

236
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,430
- His name is Church.
- Church?

237
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:12,497
That's short
for Winston Churchill.

238
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:14,130
He's a guy
who lived a long time ago.

239
00:21:14,132 --> 00:21:16,996
Oh, I know
who Winston Churchill is.

240
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:18,598
Wow. You must be really old.

241
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,599
I'm afraid so.

242
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:27,864
Oh-ho!
- Very nice!

243
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Very good.

244
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:33,232
Nice job. Bravo, sweetheart.

245
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:36,132
- Can you clap? Clap, clap.
- Well done, honey.

246
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:37,731
Thanks, folks,
for having me over.

247
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,430
It's been a long time since
I've had any good home cooking.

248
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,099
How long have you lived here?

249
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,565
What, in Ludlow,
or in that house?

250
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,997
- Either.
- All my life.

251
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:47,264
To both questions.

252
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:50,064
- Whoa, big fella!
- Church!

253
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:52,099
- He likes you.
- Well, I like him.

254
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:53,733
Church good kitty.

255
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:54,965
- Hey!
- Yes.

256
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:56,965
- Church good, good kitty.
- He is.

257
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,266
- Yeah.
- I was curious, Jud...

258
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:00,899
Um, the realtor
said the house came

259
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,398
with over 50 acres of woods.

260
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,801
That pet cemetery,
do we own that, too?

261
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:08,301
Well, that's
part of your property.

262
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:12,266
How far back
is the property line?

263
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:16,700
Well, it's further
than you'd ever care to go.

264
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,833
<i>Louis.</i>

265
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:25,103
Come on, Doc.

266
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:53,739
<i>You tried to help me.</i>

267
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,605
<i>Now let me help you.</i>

268
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:20,673
<i>This is the place
where the dead rest.</i>

269
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:24,374
<i>Do not go on to the place</i>

270
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:26,941
<i>where the dead walk.</i>

271
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:46,542
Stop! The ground is sour!

272
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:49,939
Wake up, Dada!

273
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:53,275
Oh, hey, buddy.

274
00:24:53,277 --> 00:24:55,442
Come here,
come here, come here.

275
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:56,939
Come to Daddy.

276
00:24:58,611 --> 00:25:01,176
- I love you, Daddy.
- Hmm?

277
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:03,574
Oh, man, thank you.

278
00:25:04,178 --> 00:25:05,809
Time for Daddy to get up.

279
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:14,674
Hi.

280
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:18,244
- Good morning, sleepyhead.
- Hey.

281
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:20,443
Did you wake up Dada? Huh?

282
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:22,475
- Did you wake up Dada, huh?
- What time is it?

283
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:23,941
It's late. You slept in.

284
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:40,142
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Ellie.

285
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:42,444
What have you guys got?

286
00:25:42,446 --> 00:25:44,011
I've got some candy
corns, lollipops...

287
00:25:44,013 --> 00:25:45,445
They also have
really big gummy bears.

288
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:49,209
Okay, which one is the sheet
and which one is the gho... Oh!

289
00:25:49,211 --> 00:25:51,378
You look like a ghost, don't you, huh?

290
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,578
You've been busy already.

291
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,810
- You guys look great.
- Thank you.

292
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:56,044
We have to go
to the Pattersons,

293
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:58,811
- 'cause they have the biggest candy...
- El, uh...

294
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:00,544
- Take your broom, honey?
- Yeah.

295
00:26:00,546 --> 00:26:01,712
Talk among yourselves.

296
00:26:01,714 --> 00:26:03,278
- I'll be back, okay?
- Okay.

297
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,777
What are you doing, Jud?
You scaring the kids?

298
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,279
There's something
you need to see.

299
00:26:16,215 --> 00:26:17,215
All right.

300
00:26:28,113 --> 00:26:30,678
Oh, no. Church.

301
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:37,446
One of those
damn Orinco trucks.

302
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:39,946
- Dad!
- Oh, shit.

303
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:42,679
- Dad!
- Uh, we can't let Ellie see this.

304
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,513
Come on, we got to go
trick-or-treating

305
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,213
- with Zoe and Tyler.
- Yeah, honey.

306
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:49,249
I'm just gonna say
a quick hello to Jud.

307
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:50,947
- Okay?
- I'll put a spell on you.

308
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:53,312
You already have, sweetheart.

309
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:56,113
You go wait in the car, honey.
I'll be right there.

310
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,747
You, uh...
You go with the kids.

311
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:01,481
Come back later,
we'll take care of this.

312
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:06,648
Okay.

313
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:08,582
And, Louis...

314
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:12,014
We should do this tonight.

315
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:15,948
Sure, yeah.

316
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:21,814
You're sure?

317
00:27:23,217 --> 00:27:24,815
Yeah, I'm sure.

318
00:27:25,717 --> 00:27:27,282
I mean, he was all twisted.

319
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:32,750
Which brings me

320
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,884
to the fact
that we have to tell Ellie.

321
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:37,882
- No, can we just tell her...
- Rachel. No, we need...

322
00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:40,849
Can we just tell her
that he ran away, please?

323
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,683
You know, honey,
I get it, okay?

324
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:48,251
I get it's difficult
for you to talk about death

325
00:27:48,253 --> 00:27:50,083
after what you went through
with your sister,

326
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,517
but I think it's time
you finally opened up.

327
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,750
I'm just...

328
00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:57,384
No, I'm just
upset about Church.

329
00:27:57,386 --> 00:28:01,150
Rachel, talk to me.
We both know this is about Zelda.

330
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:05,318
<i>Ever since moving here,
I can't stop thinking about her.</i>

331
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,319
<i>She hated me</i>

332
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:10,051
because my spine
wasn't twisted like hers.

333
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:14,619
<i>She promised me that one day
I'd end up just like her.</i>

334
00:28:14,621 --> 00:28:17,119
<i>I'd never
get out of bed again.</i>

335
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:20,918
<i>My parents
left me alone with her.</i>

336
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,418
<i>I was supposed
to bring her dinner.</i>

337
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,985
<i>And so I used the dumbwaiter,
and I knew I wasn't supposed to</i>

338
00:28:26,987 --> 00:28:28,784
<i>because it didn't work
all the time.</i>

339
00:29:11,223 --> 00:29:14,322
She died in there
because of me.

340
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,990
I watched them
wheel her body out,

341
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,789
but I swear
she was still in the walls.

342
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:27,320
<i>And at night,
I could hear her moving,</i>

343
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,522
<i>calling out my name.</i>

344
00:29:29,524 --> 00:29:31,988
<i>Rachel.</i>

345
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,588
I didn't know who to call.

346
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,256
But if I had just gone up to the
room and given her her food...

347
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:40,821
Your parents should never have
left you alone with her. Never.

348
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:42,357
That makes me a monster.

349
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,688
No, no, no, no, no, no,

350
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,189
that does not
make you a monster.

351
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:46,687
Come on. Hey.

352
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:49,322
That does not
make you a monster. Okay?

353
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:50,755
Mmm?

354
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:53,724
Tell you what.

355
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:57,756
Jud and I are gonna take care of
Church tonight. All right? We'll...

356
00:29:57,758 --> 00:30:02,457
We'll just tell Ellie
that he ran away.

357
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,156
- Okay? Yeah?
- Okay.

358
00:30:06,526 --> 00:30:08,390
Just anything but dead.

359
00:30:21,892 --> 00:30:23,789
I got a spot for you.

360
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:32,192
What is it?

361
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:36,493
Nothing. Let's get this
over with, huh?

362
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,391
It's cold.

363
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:45,958
<i>Jud...</i>

364
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:50,227
<i>Jud...</i>

365
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,627
Ellie really loved that cat,
didn't she?

366
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:58,226
More than anything.

367
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:00,759
And you love Ellie.

368
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:04,226
Well, of course.

369
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:09,360
So, follow me.

370
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:10,427
What?

371
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:14,928
- I know all the spots to step.
- Jud, wait.

372
00:31:19,996 --> 00:31:22,060
What's the matter
with right here?

373
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:25,427
For Chrissakes.

374
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:33,897
Oh, what the hell am I doing?

375
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:46,128
Jud, come on, wait up.

376
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:54,260
What the hell is this place?

377
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:20,197
Come a long
way to bury a cat.

378
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:41,929
What was that?

379
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,665
It's just a loon.

380
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:48,230
Come on.

381
00:33:29,236 --> 00:33:30,501
What is this place?

382
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:37,102
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

383
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:40,367
Bury your animal.

384
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:46,401
I'd help you,
but you have to do it yourself.

385
00:33:46,403 --> 00:33:50,168
And use some of these rocks
to make a cairn.

386
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,035
- Kind of like the other ones.
- Okay.

387
00:34:16,173 --> 00:34:18,437
What exactly are we
doing here tonight, Jud?

388
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:21,236
We're burying
your daughter's cat.

389
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:26,807
And that's all?

390
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:29,469
That and nothing but.

391
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,536
You did good, Louis.

392
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:50,304
I knew you would.

393
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,238
What time is it?

394
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:06,838
It's late.

395
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:11,073
Did you and Jud
take care of everything?

396
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,772
Yeah, it's done.

397
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,372
Thank you.

398
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:20,872
What is it?

399
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:25,274
It's Church, honey.

400
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,705
Yeah.

401
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:34,972
Daddy and Jud went out last
night to look for Church, and...

402
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:37,541
Well, we looked
all around and we...

403
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:39,740
Well, sweetheart,
we couldn't find him.

404
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:42,508
And so we think...

405
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,108
We think Church ran away,
sweetheart.

406
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,675
- Yeah.
- He didn't run away.

407
00:35:48,677 --> 00:35:50,541
Well...

408
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:52,539
He was outside my window
last night.

409
00:35:53,577 --> 00:35:58,307
Honey, maybe you had a dream
that you saw him.

410
00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:01,775
It's okay to be
confused about all this...

411
00:36:07,443 --> 00:36:10,308
You just have to accept
that he might not come home.

412
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,109
I'm sorry, sweetie.

413
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:13,943
He came back last night.

414
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:15,843
Look.

415
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,207
He's right there.

416
00:36:38,412 --> 00:36:39,876
I thought you said
he was dead.

417
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,677
He was.

418
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:43,309
He, uh...

419
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:47,910
He must've been unconscious,
in shock or something.

420
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:53,610
Good thing
you're not a fucking vet.

421
00:36:59,613 --> 00:37:00,711
Jud.

422
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
We, uh...

423
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:08,378
We need to have
a little talk.

424
00:37:11,914 --> 00:37:14,679
Ellie's cat is walking around
over there like nothing happened.

425
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:17,912
Well, I'll be damned.

426
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:19,979
What the fuck does that mean?

427
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:22,213
Well, isn't that
what you wanted?

428
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:23,845
Save your daughter
from the truth?

429
00:37:25,215 --> 00:37:26,579
I mean, come on.
You saw as well as I did.

430
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:28,912
- That cat was dead, Jud.
- I never said he wasn't.

431
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:32,644
- Well, then how do you explain it?
- I don't.

432
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:36,280
Nobody can.

433
00:37:36,282 --> 00:37:38,082
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Jud.

434
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:41,247
There are places in this world

435
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,515
that are older
than either of us.

436
00:37:45,517 --> 00:37:48,414
<i>Places that a rational
doctor brain like yours</i>

437
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,314
<i>will never understand.</i>

438
00:37:50,316 --> 00:37:52,280
<i>Nobody knows
what that place is,</i>

439
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:54,981
<i>what happens
in that stony ground.</i>

440
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:58,981
<i>But the soil of a man's heart
is stonier, Louis.</i>

441
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:04,747
<i>What we did last night,</i>

442
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,581
<i>we did for Ellie.</i>

443
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:11,381
<i>But that's your cat now.</i>

444
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:22,749
"Bull presumed
dead found on main street."

445
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:28,916
"Timothy Baterman..."

446
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:30,981
"Cadaver disappearance?"

447
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,582
What the fuck?

448
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:05,416
Where did you take me, Jud?

449
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:19,019
Church, you're so stinky.

450
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:20,785
What'd you do out there?

451
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,385
Hang on, Church,
there's something...

452
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:29,785
Something gross in your fur.

453
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:40,452
All right, there we go.

454
00:39:40,988 --> 00:39:42,486
Give me a look.

455
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:44,452
Okay. Does that feel okay?

456
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:46,921
Yeah?

457
00:39:46,923 --> 00:39:49,388
I want to go back
to our old house.

458
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:54,919
Well, Mommy and I,
we moved up here to slow down,

459
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:58,952
so that we could spend more
time with you, so that...

460
00:39:58,954 --> 00:40:00,620
Lift up.

461
00:40:00,622 --> 00:40:04,488
So that Daddy could be around,
he'd get to tuck you into bed more,

462
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,954
make sure you're
all safe and sound.

463
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:09,488
Give you a little tickle
before he says good night.

464
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,120
Okay? Come on.

465
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:13,021
Okay, honey.

466
00:40:13,023 --> 00:40:15,988
I promise, okay, just like your
arm, it's gonna get better.

467
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,588
All right? Trust me?

468
00:40:18,122 --> 00:40:19,421
Good night.

469
00:40:19,423 --> 00:40:21,055
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

470
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:25,555
Close the door all the way.
I don't want Church coming in anymore.

471
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,755
Okay.

472
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:30,555
I love you.

473
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,756
<i>How is she?</i>

474
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:39,089
She's good.
Poor little thing.

475
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,789
What about Church?

476
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:48,756
I don't know.
Must've been the accident.

477
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:52,590
I'll take him
to the vet tomorrow.

478
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:55,957
What about you?

479
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,122
I'm good.

480
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,824
But...

481
00:41:05,992 --> 00:41:07,189
Come here.

482
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,191
It's been hard,
the past few months.

483
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,292
What? Oh, Jesus!

484
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:50,659
Louis, it's still alive.

485
00:41:54,227 --> 00:41:55,292
Damn it!

486
00:41:57,494 --> 00:41:59,260
Jesus Christ.

487
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,625
Church?

488
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:06,794
Church?

489
00:42:10,463 --> 00:42:11,626
Come out of there, buddy.

490
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:18,777
Church...

491
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:50,463
<i>Your destruction</i>

492
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:56,164
<i>and the destruction of all
you love is very near, Doctor.</i>

493
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:06,568
Rach, what happened?
You okay?

494
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,768
Mmm.

495
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,937
I don't want
to talk about it.

496
00:45:13,803 --> 00:45:16,202
- Is it the bird?
- No, it's not the bird.

497
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:20,803
I think it's a mistake
that we moved here.

498
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:25,003
It doesn't feel right, Louis.

499
00:45:30,106 --> 00:45:32,070
You remember why we moved here
in the first place?

500
00:45:32,072 --> 00:45:33,270
No, I know.

501
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,938
I mean, look, we have
Ellie's birthday coming up.

502
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,303
Why don't we do something
special, hey?

503
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:43,571
We could throw a party.

504
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:48,905
We could invite some of our
friends from Boston up, all right?

505
00:45:51,907 --> 00:45:53,704
Invite your parents, even.

506
00:45:54,872 --> 00:45:56,137
- Okay?
- Mmm.

507
00:45:58,974 --> 00:46:00,738
We can turn this around.
We can.

508
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,838
We can turn this around.

509
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,338
Ooh,
these are looking good, El.

510
00:46:27,608 --> 00:46:28,805
El, what is this?

511
00:46:32,075 --> 00:46:34,940
I don't know.
Gage drew that.

512
00:46:43,276 --> 00:46:44,276
Gage?

513
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,508
Come on, Daddy's got you.
Daddy's got you.

514
00:46:57,343 --> 00:46:59,575
I was 11
when I lost Biff.

515
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:04,742
He'd run over some barbed wire
and the cuts got infected.

516
00:47:04,744 --> 00:47:07,443
Daddy had to put him down
out of mercy.

517
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,341
- Your dad took you up there.
- No, no.

518
00:47:13,343 --> 00:47:16,709
It was an old fella
named Stanny Bouchard.

519
00:47:16,711 --> 00:47:18,175
He told me about it.

520
00:47:21,945 --> 00:47:23,941
The Wendigo.

521
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,508
You heard a lot about that

522
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,275
all over the north country
back in the old days.

523
00:47:29,845 --> 00:47:31,876
It was a myth

524
00:47:31,878 --> 00:47:36,010
passed down from the local
tribes up this way.

525
00:47:36,012 --> 00:47:39,276
But to them, it wasn't
just some campfire story.

526
00:47:39,278 --> 00:47:41,610
They believed it.
They feared it.

527
00:47:43,746 --> 00:47:45,510
Saw these
on the trees up there.

528
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:47,412
Yeah, they're warnings.

529
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:50,246
The local tribes carved them
before they fled.

530
00:47:50,613 --> 00:47:51,477
Fled?

531
00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:54,376
Yeah, they knew
the power of that place.

532
00:47:54,378 --> 00:47:57,812
They felt its pull.

533
00:47:57,814 --> 00:48:03,544
They came to believe that
those woods belonged to something else.

534
00:48:03,546 --> 00:48:06,278
That the ground was bad.

535
00:48:08,247 --> 00:48:09,378
Sour.

536
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,943
The ground is sour.

537
00:48:13,314 --> 00:48:14,912
Yeah.

538
00:48:14,914 --> 00:48:18,613
So, they moved on.
But not before they built that deadfall.

539
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:22,012
They built it
to keep people out.

540
00:48:22,014 --> 00:48:23,545
But it didn't keep people out.

541
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:26,745
The Wendigo

542
00:48:26,747 --> 00:48:30,445
may just be
some crazy folktale,

543
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:32,512
but there is
something up there.

544
00:48:34,682 --> 00:48:36,479
Something
that brings things back.

545
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,680
So, what happened
to your dog, Jud?

546
00:48:41,615 --> 00:48:44,148
He came back.

547
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:48,812
Just like Stanny B. said he would.
But he was changed.

548
00:48:48,814 --> 00:48:52,479
It was when he went after my
mother that my daddy put him down.

549
00:48:53,483 --> 00:48:55,046
For the second time.

550
00:48:59,515 --> 00:49:04,048
I thought it would be
different with Ellie's cat.

551
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:07,981
I mean, Biff had a mean
streak to begin with.

552
00:49:07,983 --> 00:49:10,981
But Church, well...

553
00:49:10,983 --> 00:49:13,281
- Was a nice cat...
- He tried to hurt Gage.

554
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:17,515
I'm so sorry, Louis. I am.

555
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:23,249
Once you feel the power
of that place,

556
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,749
you make up the sweetest-smelling
reasons to go back.

557
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:30,448
But I was wrong.

558
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:34,650
Sometimes dead is better.

559
00:49:40,651 --> 00:49:42,291
Come on, hold still.

560
00:49:43,485 --> 00:49:45,218
Hold still, you're just
gonna go to sleep.

561
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,751
Damn it, Church. Come on, just...

562
00:49:51,918 --> 00:49:54,450
God damn it.

563
00:50:09,385 --> 00:50:10,418
Come on.

564
00:50:11,253 --> 00:50:12,253
Hey.

565
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,053
Good luck.

566
00:50:41,088 --> 00:50:45,787
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

567
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:49,352

570
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:04,653
Good job, Ellie.

571
00:51:04,655 --> 00:51:07,220
I want a piece
right from the end.

572
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,220
...big St. Bernard.

573
00:51:12,124 --> 00:51:14,588
He got rabies.
He killed about four people.

574
00:51:21,323 --> 00:51:22,421
Hey.

575
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:28,787
You still thinking
about Church?

576
00:51:29,722 --> 00:51:32,224
It's my fault he left.

577
00:51:32,226 --> 00:51:34,187
I told him
to get out of my room.

578
00:51:34,189 --> 00:51:36,122
No, honey, no.

579
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:37,621
Church loves you.

580
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:42,489
Maybe this might
help cheer you up.

581
00:51:48,126 --> 00:51:49,591
Give him a squeeze.

582
00:51:49,593 --> 00:51:50,655
Hmm?

583
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:54,823
- I love him, Daddy.
- You do? Yeah?

584
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:56,090
And I love you.

585
00:51:56,092 --> 00:51:59,657
Now go and have
a great birthday, okay?

586
00:52:00,825 --> 00:52:02,591
<i>Six...</i>

587
00:52:02,593 --> 00:52:08,524
Seven, eight, nine, 10!

588
00:52:11,425 --> 00:52:13,456
I'm a monster!

589
00:52:14,592 --> 00:52:18,024
Where is everyone?
Where are you guys? Come on.

590
00:52:23,494 --> 00:52:26,459
Come on! Where is that...
Come on! Come on!

591
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:41,359
Church?

592
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:44,392
Church!

593
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:53,793
Church. You came home.

594
00:53:04,963 --> 00:53:06,327
All right, you're it.

595
00:53:09,796 --> 00:53:11,360
Where's...

596
00:53:12,197 --> 00:53:13,595
Gage!

597
00:53:22,064 --> 00:53:23,262
Church!

598
00:56:43,606 --> 00:56:45,905
I keep thinking

599
00:56:45,907 --> 00:56:50,238
that I'm gonna hear her
coming up the stairs,

600
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,038
like she's coming home
from school.

601
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:04,005
I can't be here right now.

602
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:14,573
I'm just gonna
wrap up a few things.

603
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,974
Come soon.

604
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,541
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

605
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:25,740
Be a good boy, okay, buddy?
Take care of Mommy for me.

606
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:27,206
I'll see you in a couple days.

607
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,043
I saw Rachel and Gage
leaving a little while ago.

608
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:31,475
Boston.

609
00:58:33,178 --> 00:58:34,776
Parents' house.

610
00:58:39,246 --> 00:58:41,110
So it's just you over there?

611
00:58:42,979 --> 00:58:44,443
Yep.

612
00:58:44,445 --> 00:58:45,776
I'll drive down
in a few days.

613
00:58:45,778 --> 00:58:48,844
I got to finish a few things
at the clinic first.

614
00:58:51,347 --> 00:58:52,977
That's good.

615
00:58:52,979 --> 00:58:55,911
It's a tough time
for you folks to be apart.

616
00:58:57,479 --> 00:58:58,844
Yeah.

617
00:59:23,581 --> 00:59:28,847
You know, when you came walking over
here, it was a relief.

618
00:59:29,881 --> 00:59:32,246
I was gonna come to see you.

619
00:59:35,249 --> 00:59:38,314
I should never have
shown you that place.

620
00:59:40,383 --> 00:59:41,847
But you did.

621
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:46,180
I know what you're
thinking of doing, Louis...

622
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:50,548
...but she
won't come back the same.

623
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:54,680
I'm so goddamn sorry
I did this.

624
00:59:54,682 --> 00:59:59,613
Ellie is the first person to
touch my heart in a long time.

625
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:02,948
I didn't want her
to be so sad.

626
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:06,680
It's that goddamn place.
It feeds on your grief,

627
01:00:06,682 --> 01:00:09,081
gets into your mind.

628
01:00:10,782 --> 01:00:11,980
Damn it.

629
01:00:14,184 --> 01:00:17,782
I need to
close my eyes for a minute.

630
01:00:37,017 --> 01:00:38,082
<i>Hey.</i>

631
01:00:38,852 --> 01:00:40,282
<i>Thought you'd be in bed.</i>

632
01:00:40,284 --> 01:00:44,148
I was waiting to hear from you.
I called earlier.

633
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:47,383
<i>Yeah, I know, I saw that.
I was, uh...</i>

634
01:00:47,385 --> 01:00:51,184
I went over to Jud's.
Had a couple of drinks.

635
01:00:52,684 --> 01:00:55,784
<i>Can you just
come be with us?</i>

636
01:00:58,852 --> 01:01:01,517
Gage needs you and I'm...

637
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,084
I'm really wiped out, honey.

638
01:01:12,485 --> 01:01:14,984
Is it okay
if we talk tomorrow?

639
01:01:14,986 --> 01:01:16,117
Okay.

640
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:19,251
I love you.

641
01:01:19,253 --> 01:01:20,983
I love you, too.

642
01:01:21,454 --> 01:01:22,751
Goodbye.

643
01:01:46,655 --> 01:01:48,053
Fuck.

644
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,626
<i>Louis, stop.</i>

645
01:03:42,628 --> 01:03:44,292
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

646
01:03:45,561 --> 01:03:47,792
<i>You have to let her go.</i>

647
01:03:47,794 --> 01:03:49,358
But I can fix this.

648
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:52,026
<i>Pascow!</i>

649
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:55,160
Pascow! Pascow!

650
01:03:57,461 --> 01:03:59,626
Come here. No, it's okay.

651
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:02,093
It's okay. It's okay.

652
01:04:03,928 --> 01:04:05,593
<i>Go home.</i>

653
01:04:05,595 --> 01:04:07,859
Pascow says go home.

654
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:09,959
Mommy, go home!

655
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,426
There's nothing there.

656
01:04:23,963 --> 01:04:25,627
There's nothing there.

657
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:46,530
Daddy's almost there,
almost there.

658
01:05:49,967 --> 01:05:51,631
I'm sorry.

659
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:16,879
Daddy?

660
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:19,944
Where am I?

661
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:24,479
Oh, my... My little girl.

662
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:28,113
Come here.

663
01:10:28,115 --> 01:10:29,678
Oh, you're home!

664
01:10:33,848 --> 01:10:35,312
Home.

665
01:11:33,851 --> 01:11:35,380
What is it?

666
01:11:36,085 --> 01:11:37,683
Just a tangle.

667
01:11:52,085 --> 01:11:54,150
Where's Mommy and Gage?

668
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,651
They went down
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

669
01:11:59,385 --> 01:12:01,749
Are they coming back?

670
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:05,987
Yeah.

671
01:12:09,686 --> 01:12:12,550
I remember my birthday party.

672
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:16,451
Church was out on the road.

673
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,751
I was so happy he came home.

674
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,550
There was a truck.

675
01:12:28,521 --> 01:12:30,451
Then everything went black.

676
01:12:31,387 --> 01:12:33,050
Well, it's okay now.

677
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:36,451
Now you're back.

678
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:40,918
Back from where?

679
01:12:48,254 --> 01:12:52,053
It's time to go to bed, okay?
Turn the light off.

680
01:12:52,055 --> 01:12:54,620
I'm dead, aren't I?

681
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:57,053
No, honey. No.

682
01:12:58,888 --> 01:13:00,153
You're here.

683
01:13:02,557 --> 01:13:04,554
Will you stay with me?

684
01:13:06,022 --> 01:13:07,153
Of course.

685
01:13:22,589 --> 01:13:24,820
I can hear the woods.

686
01:13:27,025 --> 01:13:29,622
The windows are
closed, sweetheart.

687
01:13:30,124 --> 01:13:31,787
Not like that.

688
01:13:34,058 --> 01:13:35,822
Inside.

689
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:45,056
Does Mommy know about me?

690
01:13:45,058 --> 01:13:46,655
Please, El...

691
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:50,589
Close your eyes, okay?

692
01:13:51,525 --> 01:13:53,589
It's gonna be okay.

693
01:14:01,593 --> 01:14:03,323
Love you, Daddy.

694
01:14:05,424 --> 01:14:07,155
Love you too, El.

695
01:14:39,361 --> 01:14:40,626
El?

696
01:15:15,396 --> 01:15:16,860
Ellie, careful.

697
01:15:19,995 --> 01:15:22,994
Just stop it. Stop it.
Stop. Ellie, stop it.

698
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,361
Stop it!

699
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,928
Why'd you put
the dress back on?

700
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,663
What are you gonna tell her?

701
01:15:56,698 --> 01:15:59,096
Something happened
last night. I...

702
01:15:59,098 --> 01:16:01,529
Gage was having a nightmare,
or I thought it was a nightmare,

703
01:16:01,531 --> 01:16:04,329
and he just started saying
that boy's name who died.

704
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:06,694
I'm freaking out,
and Gage is freaking out,

705
01:16:06,696 --> 01:16:08,262
and I... I just need
to talk to you.

706
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:10,963
Just please call me back.

707
01:16:10,965 --> 01:16:12,330
<i>It's 4:00 p.m. on the dot</i>

708
01:16:12,332 --> 01:16:14,629
<i>and we're coming
to you with a traffic update.</i>

709
01:16:14,631 --> 01:16:15,931
<i>Expect major delays.</i>

710
01:16:15,933 --> 01:16:17,896
<i>Traffic on the I-95
is backed-up for miles.</i>

711
01:16:17,898 --> 01:16:20,230
We're gonna be okay, okay?

712
01:16:20,232 --> 01:16:21,864
- Okay?
- Mama.

713
01:16:21,866 --> 01:16:24,230
- Mama.
<i>- Call Jud.</i>

714
01:16:24,232 --> 01:16:29,230
<i>So far, no fatalities,
but two passengers have been airlifted...</i>

715
01:16:29,232 --> 01:16:31,498
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Jud, hi, it's Rachel.

716
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,698
Rachel. You...

717
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,297
You down at your folks' place?

718
01:16:36,299 --> 01:16:38,199
<i>Yeah, I'm on my way back.
Something's wrong.</i>

719
01:16:38,201 --> 01:16:39,997
<i>I'm really worried about
Louis right now.</i>

720
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:41,864
- Louis?
- Can you just go over there

721
01:16:41,866 --> 01:16:43,565
and check on him, please?

722
01:16:43,567 --> 01:16:46,199
<i>I just... I've been calling him
all morning, and I don't know...</i>

723
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:50,199
What...
He... He's not answering?

724
01:16:50,201 --> 01:16:53,498
No. And I've called him
so many times.

725
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,498
- <i>Well, I'll go on over there and check.</i>
- Okay. Thank you, Jud.

726
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,065
<i>I should be there soon, okay?</i>

727
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:01,998
Yeah,
I'll see you then, Rachel.

728
01:17:10,901 --> 01:17:13,867
Louis? You in there?

729
01:17:18,068 --> 01:17:19,200
Hey, Jud.

730
01:17:20,733 --> 01:17:22,400
How's your head today?

731
01:17:22,402 --> 01:17:24,200
Oh.

732
01:17:24,202 --> 01:17:26,133
It's banging
like a drum, Jud.

733
01:17:34,969 --> 01:17:37,367
I don't remember
you leaving last night.

734
01:17:37,369 --> 01:17:38,967
Yeah, you passed out.

735
01:17:41,771 --> 01:17:43,202
Listen,
I got to, uh...

736
01:17:43,204 --> 01:17:45,000
I got to get
back inside. I'm...

737
01:17:46,436 --> 01:17:48,735
I've been waiting for Rachel
to call all morning

738
01:17:48,737 --> 01:17:51,102
and I don't want
to miss it. So...

739
01:17:52,571 --> 01:17:53,768
Okay?

740
01:17:57,603 --> 01:17:59,869
If you've done
something, Louis,

741
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:03,135
it's not too late
to undo it.

742
01:18:09,838 --> 01:18:11,902
You don't have to worry
about me, Jud.

743
01:18:12,537 --> 01:18:13,870
I'm fine.

744
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:16,803
Really.

745
01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:18,469
If that's all, I'm gonna...

746
01:18:19,437 --> 01:18:20,901
I'm gonna go.

747
01:20:07,876 --> 01:20:09,640
I know you're up here!

748
01:21:53,416 --> 01:21:55,747
- Hello, Jud.
- Stop it, Ellie.

749
01:21:55,749 --> 01:21:57,813
Now, just slow down.

750
01:21:59,082 --> 01:22:01,280
Your sweet Norma.

751
01:22:01,282 --> 01:22:04,215
She's burning down in hell
for what you did to her.

752
01:22:04,217 --> 01:22:06,748
I saw her there, Jud.
I saw her.

753
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:09,314
Shut up! You don't know
anything about her!

754
01:22:12,717 --> 01:22:14,648
Did you miss me, Judson?

755
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:16,681
That's not my Norma!

756
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:22,849
Ellie's hurting.
You did this to her!

757
01:22:22,851 --> 01:22:24,983
It's not you.
It's not you!

758
01:22:24,985 --> 01:22:27,847
You told Louis
about that place.

759
01:22:27,849 --> 01:22:29,782
And now we're suffering

760
01:22:29,784 --> 01:22:31,647
eternally.

761
01:22:35,218 --> 01:22:39,114
But we're here now
to bring you back

762
01:22:39,116 --> 01:22:41,816
so you can suffer with us.

763
01:22:41,818 --> 01:22:44,517
Just you come
and fucking try!

764
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:53,849
El?

765
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:05,483
Oh, shit.

766
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:10,885
Rachel.

767
01:23:10,887 --> 01:23:12,418
What are you...

768
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,517
You're okay.
Thank God you're okay!

769
01:23:14,519 --> 01:23:16,818
I was so worried,
and I was calling

770
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,017
and you wouldn't
pick up, and

771
01:23:18,019 --> 01:23:19,319
Gage was having
these nightmares

772
01:23:19,321 --> 01:23:22,785
and he was saying the name
of that boy that died.

773
01:23:22,787 --> 01:23:25,885
I'm here right now.
I just need you and no one else.

774
01:23:25,887 --> 01:23:27,151
Just you, me and Gage,

775
01:23:27,153 --> 01:23:29,386
- we can get through this.
- It's okay. It's okay.

776
01:23:29,388 --> 01:23:31,052
Come on, honey, it's okay.

777
01:23:31,054 --> 01:23:32,352
Oh. Oh.

778
01:23:32,354 --> 01:23:34,452
- Look at you, hey? You're Daddy's boy.
- Daddy.

779
01:23:34,454 --> 01:23:36,419
Have you gotten bigger?
Hey? Tell me, come on.

780
01:23:36,421 --> 01:23:38,419
Have you gotten bigger?
I think he has. I think he has.

781
01:23:38,421 --> 01:23:40,319
I think he's gotten
a lot bigger.

782
01:23:40,321 --> 01:23:42,252
Oh, you smell so good! Hmm.

783
01:23:42,254 --> 01:23:44,785
Oh, you smell so good!
Come to Daddy.

784
01:23:44,787 --> 01:23:48,585
Louis, what's going on?

785
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:55,155
I needed more time with her.

786
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:58,321
Come here. Come here.

787
01:23:59,655 --> 01:24:00,753
Honey.

788
01:24:02,388 --> 01:24:04,553
I wasn't ready
to say goodbye to her.

789
01:24:05,089 --> 01:24:07,354
You're scaring me.

790
01:24:07,356 --> 01:24:09,486
Just tell me
what you're talking about.

791
01:24:09,488 --> 01:24:11,288
It was my fault
she died, Rach.

792
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:13,220
I had to bring her back.

793
01:24:17,723 --> 01:24:19,053
Ellie-phant.

794
01:24:28,424 --> 01:24:30,522
The Great and Terrible.

795
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:36,955
There's a place, Rach,
deep in the woods

796
01:24:37,991 --> 01:24:40,289
beyond the pet cemetery.

797
01:24:44,959 --> 01:24:46,723
It brings things back.

798
01:24:49,224 --> 01:24:51,590
Aren't you happy, Mommy?

799
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:05,921
Hug your daughter, Rach.

800
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:08,755
Hug your daughter.

801
01:25:17,858 --> 01:25:20,357
I need to put Gage to bed.

802
01:25:22,259 --> 01:25:23,756
Rachel!

803
01:25:24,826 --> 01:25:26,059
She doesn't want me here.

804
01:25:27,227 --> 01:25:29,824
No, no, no, no, no.
Mommy just needs time.

805
01:25:29,826 --> 01:25:33,824
It's okay.
I don't want her here, either.

806
01:25:33,826 --> 01:25:36,159
We're okay. Okay, yes.

807
01:25:36,161 --> 01:25:38,159
Here you go.
Here you go, sweetie.

808
01:25:38,161 --> 01:25:39,757
Rachel.

809
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:41,690
Rachel, open up. Please.

810
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,858
Just let me explain.

811
01:25:45,128 --> 01:25:47,593
I know. Let me explain.

812
01:25:52,728 --> 01:25:55,359
What is she? What is...

813
01:25:55,361 --> 01:25:56,825
That is Ellie out there.

814
01:25:56,827 --> 01:26:00,493
No. No, we buried her.
We put her in the ground.

815
01:26:00,495 --> 01:26:04,260
She's been given back to us.
We have a second chance.

816
01:26:04,262 --> 01:26:06,293
It doesn't work
that way, Louis.

817
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:07,726
Yes, it does.
There's a place in the woods.

818
01:26:07,728 --> 01:26:09,092
That place
I was telling you about.

819
01:26:09,094 --> 01:26:11,493
I couldn't understand it until
I buried Church up there.

820
01:26:11,495 --> 01:26:13,793
That cat was dead until I
buried him in the ground

821
01:26:13,795 --> 01:26:15,293
and it brought him back.

822
01:26:16,696 --> 01:26:19,327
He wasn't the same
after that.

823
01:26:20,196 --> 01:26:22,160
You saw her.

824
01:26:22,162 --> 01:26:24,194
You touched her.
That is our daughter.

825
01:26:24,196 --> 01:26:25,694
You dug her up?

826
01:26:25,696 --> 01:26:27,726
That is our daughter
down there, honey.

827
01:26:27,728 --> 01:26:29,325
Please, okay?

828
01:26:31,028 --> 01:26:32,493
I did what I think
was right.

829
01:26:32,495 --> 01:26:35,494
Let God take
his own fucking kid!

830
01:26:48,563 --> 01:26:50,561
- Ellie?
- You're okay.

831
01:26:51,598 --> 01:26:52,662
Ellie!

832
01:26:52,664 --> 01:26:56,095
Ellie, baby, Mommy and Daddy
were just...

833
01:26:59,098 --> 01:27:00,363
Shit.

834
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:13,096
Mama.

835
01:27:13,098 --> 01:27:15,599
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.

836
01:27:15,601 --> 01:27:17,863
Mommy's okay. Mommy's...

837
01:27:25,165 --> 01:27:28,530
No. No, no, no.
No, no, no...

838
01:27:30,265 --> 01:27:31,464
No.

839
01:28:37,737 --> 01:28:38,835
Rachel.

840
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:47,169
Now you'll never
get out of bed again.

841
01:29:00,338 --> 01:29:02,368
No! No!

842
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,203
Stop struggling,
you useless cow.

843
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,502
Ellie?

844
01:29:14,205 --> 01:29:15,236
Shit.

845
01:29:44,106 --> 01:29:45,137
Jud!

846
01:29:52,441 --> 01:29:54,070
Oh, my God.

847
01:29:54,072 --> 01:29:56,870
Oh, my God. No, Jud.

848
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:04,571
God damn it!

849
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:37,173
Louis! Take the baby!

850
01:30:37,175 --> 01:30:39,039
- Louis!
- Rachel!

851
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:41,007
Take the baby!
Ellie's trying to kill me!

852
01:30:41,009 --> 01:30:42,574
- Come on, I got him. Jump!
- Take the baby!

853
01:30:42,576 --> 01:30:45,373
Let him go! Come on,
Daddy's got you.

854
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:46,706
Come on.

855
01:30:53,409 --> 01:30:55,507
Okay. Okay, Gage.

856
01:30:55,509 --> 01:30:57,374
Daddy needs you
to stay in the car, okay?

857
01:30:57,376 --> 01:30:58,708
Don't open the door
for anyone.

858
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:00,441
Listen to me, Gage,
not even for Ellie.

859
01:31:04,277 --> 01:31:07,842
You let me die in that road.
You did nothing.

860
01:31:07,844 --> 01:31:10,075
Just like you did
with your sister.

861
01:31:11,544 --> 01:31:13,108
I was scared.

862
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:26,110
You're a liar.

863
01:31:26,112 --> 01:31:28,377
You prayed
your sister would die.

864
01:31:29,312 --> 01:31:30,744
I did.

865
01:31:32,446 --> 01:31:36,409
Remember when Daddy said
there was nothing after this?

866
01:31:36,411 --> 01:31:38,075
Well, he was wrong.

867
01:31:39,646 --> 01:31:41,743
But it's not heaven.

868
01:31:41,745 --> 01:31:44,677
And you're going there soon,
Mommy.

869
01:31:46,612 --> 01:31:48,876
Don't call me "Mommy."

870
01:31:52,412 --> 01:31:54,710
You're not my daughter.

871
01:31:57,646 --> 01:31:59,143
Ellie's dead.

872
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,178
Then go be with her!

873
01:32:04,414 --> 01:32:05,945
Rachel!

874
01:32:10,013 --> 01:32:13,245
Oh, God, Rach.
I got Gage.

875
01:32:13,247 --> 01:32:16,078
Don't bury me in that place.

876
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,080
What?

877
01:33:12,383 --> 01:33:14,281
Oh, fuck. Shit.

878
01:33:30,049 --> 01:33:31,347
Rachel!

879
01:33:33,317 --> 01:33:35,182
You're too late.

880
01:33:38,418 --> 01:33:40,149
Where's Mommy?

881
01:33:40,151 --> 01:33:43,317
Mommy's already
feasting on dirt.

882
01:33:44,152 --> 01:33:47,084
What have you done, El?
Come on.

883
01:33:48,951 --> 01:33:51,249
You started this, Daddy.

884
01:33:53,286 --> 01:33:55,284
When you moved us here.

885
01:33:57,585 --> 01:33:59,784
When you buried Church.

886
01:33:59,786 --> 01:34:01,850
When you buried me!

01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:21,084
Stop fighting, Daddy.

888
01:34:21,086 --> 01:34:23,017
It will be better this way.

889
01:34:44,354 --> 01:34:47,387
You're dead!
You're dead!

890
01:34:55,955 --> 01:34:58,220
You're dead!

891
01:34:59,955 --> 01:35:02,019
Please,
please, just stop.

892
01:35:07,789 --> 01:35:09,654
Get off!

893
01:35:09,656 --> 01:35:11,120
I thought we could
be a family.

894
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:12,886
I wanted to be a family.

895
01:35:12,888 --> 01:35:14,454
But we can't.

896
01:35:14,456 --> 01:35:17,088
But we can, Daddy. We can.
