1
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,653
A legend is sung

2
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,948
Of when England was young

3
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,120
And knights were brave and bold

4
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,832
The good king had died

5
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,711
And no one could decide

6
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:13,425
Who was rightful heir to the throne

7
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:21,099
It seemed that the land
would be torn by war

8
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,396
Or saved by a miracle alone

9
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:34,863
And that miracle appeared

10
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:40,953
In London town

11
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,166
The sword

12
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,381
In the stone

13
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,679
And below the hilt,
in letters of gold,

14
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,348
were written these words,

15
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,686
"Whoso pulleth out this sword
of this stone and anvil

16
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,439
"is rightwise king born of England."

17
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,527
Though many tried for the sword
with all their strength,

18
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,530
none could move the sword, nor stir it.

19
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,741
So, the miracle had not worked.

20
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,328
And England was still without a king.

21
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,040
And in time,
the marvelous sword was forgotten.

22
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,591
This was a dark age,

23
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,343
without law and without order.

24
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,098
Men lived in fear of one another,

25
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,143
for the strong preyed upon the weak.

26
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,302
A dark age, indeed!

27
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,430
Age of inconvenience.

28
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,099
No plumbing.

29
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,394
No electricity.

30
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,438
No nothing.

31
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,564
Oh!

32
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,651
Oh, hang it all!

33
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,528
Hang it all.

34
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,242
Oh, now what? Now what?

35
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
Leave off, leave off!

36
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:49,581
Oh, you... You fiendish chain, you!

37
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,627
Everything complicated.

38
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,296
One big medieval mess.

39
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,976
Now, let me see, um...

40
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,187
He should be here in...
Uh, I'd say half an hour.

41
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,523
Who? Who?

42
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,817
I'd like to know who.

43
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,820
I told you, Archimedes. I am not sure.

44
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,531
All I know is that someone
will be coming.

45
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,991
Someone very important.

46
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,993
Oh, pin feathers.

47
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,830
Fate will direct him to me
so that I in turn may guide him

48
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,249
to his rightful place in the world.

49
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,335
Huh. And you say he will arrive
in half an hour?

50
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,673
Ha. Well, we'll just see.

51
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,010
And you will, Archimedes, you will.

52
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,012
Ow!

53
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,808
He'll be a boy.

54
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,728
A small boy.

55
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,481
Eleven, 12 years old,

56
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,693
and a scrawny little fellow.

57
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,531
Oh, no, no, no. That can't be the one.

58
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,534
Surely not. Why, that big lad
must be close on to 20.

59
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,453
Ah!

60
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,624
There he is.
The scrawny little fellow, about 12.

61
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,210
He's a regular little grasshopper.

62
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,129
Look at him go.

63
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:23,884
And where, where would you guess
he is at this very moment?

64
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:28,889
I am not guessing, Archimedes.
I know where he is!

65
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:33,060
Uh... Less than a mile from here,

66
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,103
just beyond the forest.

67
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,564
And right on schedule.

68
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,608
If all goes well.

69
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,070
Quiet, Wart.

70
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,988
I'm trying to be.

71
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,992
And nobody asked you to come along
in the first place.

72
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,995
- I'm not even moving.
- Shut up.

73
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,498
A-ha.

74
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,794
Here we go. Oh, what a set-up.

75
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,507
Hmm.
Right smack through the old gizzard.

76
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,096
Wha... Wait. Whoa!

77
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,099
Why, you clumsy little fool!

78
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,727
Oh, Kay, please, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it.

79
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,229
Please.

80
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,731
If I ever...

81
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,069
If I ever get my hands on you
I'll wring your scrawny little neck,

82
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,529
so help me, I will.

83
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,282
I'll get the arrow, Kay.
I'm sure I can find it.

84
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,372
Don't tell me you're going in there.

85
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,251
- Why, it's swarming with wolves.
- I'm not afraid.

86
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,339
Well, go ahead.
It's your skin, not mine.

87
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,133
Go on, go on.

88
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,623
There it is. Oh, there it is!

89
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,194
Wha... Wait. Whoa!

90
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,242
Well.

91
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,620
So, you did drop in for tea, after all.

92
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,291
Oh. You are a bit late, you know.

93
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,002
Oh, I am?

94
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,212
Yes.

95
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,714
Now...
My name is Merlin.

96
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,343
Come, come. Who are you, my lad?

97
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,471
Oh, my name's Arthur,
but everyone calls me Wart.

98
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,806
Oh.

99
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,060
Oh, what a perfect stuffed owl.

100
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,604
Stuffed? I beg your pardon!

101
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,232
He's alive, and he talks!

102
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,318
And certainly a great deal better
than you do.

103
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,905
Oh, come, Archimedes.

104
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,409
Come, come, now.
I want you to meet the Wart.

105
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,579
Now, you must forgive him.
He's only a boy.

106
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,747
Boy? Boy.

107
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,916
I see no boy.

108
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,754
- I'm sorry that I...
- That's all right.

109
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:51,258
- He's much too sensitive.
- Sensitive? Huh?

110
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,886
- Who? What, what?
- Oh!

111
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,014
- How did you know that I was...
- Oh, that you'd be dropping in?

112
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:01,018
Well, I happen to be a wizard.

113
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,146
A soothsayer, a prognosticator.

114
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,191
I have the power to see into the future.

115
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,278
Centuries into the future.

116
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,908
I've even been there, lad,
and I've seen all these things.

117
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:20,078
They're only plans and small models,
of course.

118
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:25,125
Now, this for instance
is a steam locomotive.

119
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,758
There she goes.

120
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,468
Pretty good, eh?

121
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,643
That won't be invented
for hundreds of years.

122
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:46,355
Oh. You mean you can see everything
before it happens?

123
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,315
Yes, everything.

124
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,566
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

125
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,984
Everything, Merlin?

126
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,486
Uh...

127
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,821
No, no, not everything.

128
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:59,201
I... I admit I didn't know whom
to expect for tea.

129
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,537
But as you can see,

130
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,332
I figured the exact place.

131
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,918
You're very clever, sir.

132
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,879
Yes. Well, never mind the "sir".

133
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:14,258
Just plain Merlin will do.

134
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:18,220
- Now, would you care for sugar?
- Oh, yes, I would.

135
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,930
- Please.
- All right.

136
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,682
Sugar? Sugar!

137
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,481
No. Manners, manners.
Guests first. You know that!

138
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,862
All right. Just say when, lad.

139
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,321
When.

140
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,450
- Have you had any schooling?
- Oh, yes.

141
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,370
I'm training to be a squire.

142
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,456
I'm learning the rules of combat
and swordsmanship

143
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,876
and jousting and horsemanship.

144
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,212
Oh, yes, yes. Very good. That...

145
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:56,717
No, no, no! I... I mean a real education.

146
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,929
Mathematics, history,
biology, natural science,

147
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,599
English, Latin, French.

148
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,144
No. When, when! Blast it all. When!

149
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:13,317
Impudent piece of crockery.

150
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,906
Boy, now, you can't...

151
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,247
You can't grow up
without a decent education, you know.

152
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:30,334
Oh, I suppose not, sir... Merlin.

153
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:34,004
So, I am going to be your tutor.

154
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,923
But I've got to get back to the castle.

155
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,551
- They'll want me in the kitchen.
- Oh, well, then, very well.

156
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,930
We'll pack and be on our way.

157
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,058
You... You watch now. You'll like this.

158
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,731
Higitus figitus zumbakazing.

159
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:57,277
I want your attention, everything.

160
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,032
We're packing to leave.
Come on, let's go.

161
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,202
No, no, not you.
Books are always first, you know.

162
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,208
Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack

163
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,252
Abra abra dabra nack

164
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,256
Shrink in size, very small
We've got to save enough room for all

165
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,343
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitonium

166
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:33,272
Alakafez, balakazez
Malakamez meripides

167
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,607
Hockety, pockety, wockety...

168
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,194
Now, stop, stop, stop, stop.

169
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,904
Sugar bowl, you're getting rough.

170
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,198
That poor old tea set
is cracked enough.

171
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,412
All right. Let's start again. Let's start...

172
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,789
Oh. Where was I, boy?

173
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:54,918
- Uh... Hockety, pockety?
- Oh, yes. Yes, that's right.

174
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,088
Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack
Odds and ends and bric a brac

175
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:01,550
I'll be with you in a minute, son.
Packing's almost done.

176
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,224
You... You bungling blockhead!

177
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:12,269
Hey, easy there. No, go ahead.

178
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,606
Dun goo-dily doo-dily doo-dily dun.
This is the best part.

179
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,984
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitonium

180
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,237
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitoni...

181
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,323
Ooh! Ha ha!

182
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,367
What a way to pack.

183
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,454
Well... Now, just a minute, boy.

184
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,833
How else would you get all this stuff
into one suitcase, I'd like to know.

185
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:39,004
- But I think it's wonderful.
- Oh. Yes, it is, rather.

186
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:46,929
Now, don't you get any foolish ideas
that magic will solve all your problems.

187
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,514
Because it won't!

188
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,766
But sir, I don't have any problems.

189
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:54,895
Oh, everybody's got problems.
The world is full of problems.

190
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,733
Oh, blast it all.
There, now you see what I did?

191
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,577
That's the trouble with the world today.

192
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,539
Everybody butting their heads
against a brick wall.

193
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,333
All muscle and no mentality.

194
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,002
Do you want to be all muscle
and no brain?

195
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,630
- I don't have any muscle.
- You don't?

196
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,050
- Well, how do you move about?
- I suppose I do have a little.

197
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,386
A-ha! There, you see?
Well, that's enough.

198
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,973
Now, develop your brain. Knowledge,
wisdom, there's the real power.

199
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,059
Higher learning, that's the thing.

200
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,107
First thing tomorrow morning
we'll start a full schedule.

201
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,441
Eight hours a day.

202
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:45,404
We'll have six hours for school room
and two for study period.

203
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,573
But I al...

204
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,576
But I don't have the time.
I have page duties.

205
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,995
Page duties? Ha!

206
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:01,086
We'll change all that.
There's got to be a shake-up.

207
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,548
Well, yes, sir. I suppose so.

208
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,594
How do you expect to amount
to anything without an education?

209
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,638
Even in these bungling,
backward medieval times

210
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,350
you have got to know
where you're going, don't you?

211
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,312
Yes, sir.

212
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,730
Yes, of course.

213
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:24,359
You must plan for the future, boy.
You've got to find a direction.

214
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,278
And you've got...

215
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,700
Now, by the by,
what direction is this castle of yours?

216
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,911
I think it's north. The other way.

217
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,204
Oh.

218
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,335
All right. We'd better get a move on.
Come on, lad. Pick up the pace.

219
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,033
Oh, the devil take it.

220
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,828
The devil take it.
Anyone's got better sense

221
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,206
than to go barging off
in that infernal forest alone.

222
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,417
You had no business letting him go.

223
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,545
Look, Dad,

224
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:29,424
- I'm not the Wart's keeper.
- Well, blast it all, I am!

225
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:33,679
After all, I took him in,
adopted the lad, you might say.

226
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,431
Being his foster father, I'm responsible.

227
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,732
Tiger, Talbert, off with you.

228
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:50,112
Look here. What's the big idea
of gallivanting off in the woods

229
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,991
- and worrying everybody?
- I'm sorry, sir.

230
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,409
Well, sorry's not enough.

231
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,371
That's four demerits,
four hours extra kitchen duty.

232
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:03,167
- Report to the cook.
- But I'd like you to meet...

233
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,003
Go on, hop it, boy. Hop, hop, hop it.

234
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,090
You've got to keep a schedule
to run a place like this.

235
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:14,094
You need strict rules,
especially for small boys.

236
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,972
And I most certainly agree.

237
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,266
Who are you, and... Oh...

238
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:22,769
- I mean, you?
- My name is Merlin.

239
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:27,149
And this is Archimedes,
the highly-educated owl.

240
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,778
Educated owl?

241
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,114
Say, that's a good one.

242
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:37,117
Say, say, I know.

243
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,828
You've got him under a spell, Marvin.

244
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:44,291
- You're a magician.
- The name is Merlin.

245
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:50,130
And I happen to be
the world's most powerful wizard.

246
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,467
Come off it, man.

247
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:58,096
- Gadzooks.
- All right. I shall demonstrate.

248
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,141
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mo,

249
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:04,645
wind and snow swirl and blow.

250
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,649
What the devil are you up to?

251
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,779
That is what I call a "wizard blizzard."

252
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,074
Hey, Kay, would you look at this?

253
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,867
An indoor blizzard.

254
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:21,161
And in the month of July.

255
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,454
So what?

256
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:26,124
All right, Marvin, turn her off.

257
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,127
I'm convinced.

258
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,463
Alakazam.

259
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:38,512
I hope you don't go in
for any of that black magic.

260
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,514
Oh, no, no, no, no.

261
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,683
Never touch the stuff.

262
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:46,562
My magic is used mainly
for educational purposes.

263
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:52,109
In fact, that is why I am here.

264
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,320
I have come to educate the Wart.

265
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,364
Oh, no, you don't.

266
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,949
I'm running this place.

267
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,285
If you think you're gonna
fiddle with my schedule,

268
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,121
pack up your bag of tricks and be gone.

269
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:10,210
Well, by Jove. Hey, he's gone.

270
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,963
Good riddance.

271
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,884
I'm gone,
but then I'm not gone.

272
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:22,973
So, if I do leave
you can never be sure that I am gone.

273
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,184
- Can you?
- Well...

274
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,689
Well, I must say,
you've got me there, Marvin.

275
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:36,528
Where are you?
And you're welcome to stay, if you like.

276
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,573
Thank you. You're very kind.

277
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,451
Very generous, I must say.

278
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:46,497
Well, all we can offer
is room and board.

279
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,540
Hard times, you know, Marvin.

280
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,920
We'll put you up in the northwest tower.
That's the guest room.

281
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,089
It's drafty in the winter,
but in this hot weather

282
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,175
it's the best room in the house.

283
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,720
Oh, yes. Very lovely, indeed.

284
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:05,057
So just make yourself at home, Marvin.

285
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,851
Marvin? Marvin, Marvin, Marvin.

286
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,620
Best room in the house!

287
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:31,375
Guest room. Unwelcome guest room!

288
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,754
If he thinks that he can get rid of me,
I've got news for that old walrus.

289
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,881
I'm sticking it out!

290
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:41,134
And I say we go back to the woods.

291
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,762
No, not on your life.

292
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:47,099
That boy's got to have an education.
He has a future.

293
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,560
Hmm. You may be right.

294
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:53,605
A skinny kid like that would make
a cracking good chimney sweep.

295
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:02,364
Something tells me
that you're all wet, Archimedes.

296
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,418
- Who goes there?
- Pellinore.

297
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,045
It's Pellinore, dash it all.

298
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:21,383
I've got big news from London.
Big news.

299
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,303
Come on, man. Drop the bridge.

300
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,941
Well... Big news, eh?

301
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,652
Well, can't wait for the London Times.

302
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:45,032
First edition won't be out for
at least, uh... 12 hundred years.

303
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:49,328
Archimedes, would you mind
sailing down there and...

304
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,205
Not interested.

305
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,083
Oh, come, come, come, come now.
You're as wet as you can get.

306
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,045
No. No, no, no.

307
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:02,382
Archimedes, I'll turn you into a human.

308
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:06,220
- Hmm. You wouldn't dare.
- I will. So help me, I will.

309
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,931
All right. All right. All right!

310
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,516
All right.

311
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,726
Works every time.

312
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,603
Just like magic.

313
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,535
Pellinore!

314
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,413
Pellinore. Greetings, old boy.

315
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:36,083
What's all the noise about London?

316
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,586
Big news, really big news.

317
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,422
Sit down, man,
and let's hear all about it.

318
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:46,301
They're having a big tournament
New Year's Day.

319
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,762
Oh, that's not news, dash it all.

320
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,473
- They always do.
- But Ector, Ector,

321
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:54,101
here's where
all the excitement comes in.

322
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:59,773
To the winner of this tournament
goes the crown.

323
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:05,904
You mean...
You mean he'll be king of all England?

324
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,950
King of all England.

325
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,537
Kay, lad, did you hear that?

326
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,956
Pretty fair prize, I'd say.

327
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:19,751
Yes, and you could win it, boy,
if you'd knuckle down to your training.

328
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:23,797
We'll have you knighted by Christmas,
off to London. What do you say?

329
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:27,009
Sure. Why not? Why not?

330
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,970
Wart, lad,
how'd you like to go to London?

331
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,638
Oh, Sir Ector, you mean it?

332
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:34,349
If you stick to your duties
you can be Kay's squire.

333
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,518
Oh, I will, sir, I will.

334
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:43,650
I don't want the Wart for my squire.

335
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:47,362
Here's to London, and here's to Kay.

336
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:51,450
And here's to the banner
of the castle of the Forest Sauvage!

337
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,327
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

338
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,305
Charge!

339
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,517
Wait, boy. Lean into it.

340
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,187
Steady, boy, steady.
Steady with the lance.

341
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,440
Do it, white knight! Hit him clean.

342
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,735
No. No, no!

343
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,990
Heads up!

344
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,413
Archimedes?

345
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,791
Archimedes, where are we?

346
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,043
In a tumbled-down old tower

347
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:47,381
in the most miserable old castle
in all Christendom, that's where.

348
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,217
Uh, C... Castle? Castle?

349
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,511
Don't you even remember the boy?

350
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,513
Uh... The boy?

351
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:57,307
Can't you remember
one blasted thing?

352
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,309
Oh, now, just a moment. I...

353
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,603
- Tight grip on the lance.
- Oh.

354
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:04,815
Loose in the saddle, knees in tight,

355
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,860
weight forward and stay on target.

356
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,573
You keep losing your grip.

357
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,742
It's not a mere matter of muscle, son.

358
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:18,912
Jousting is a fine skill.

359
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,124
It... It's a highly developed science.

360
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,377
Science, indeed.

361
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:29,256
One dummy trying to knock off
another dummy with a bit of a stick.

362
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,759
And the Wart's just as hot for it
as the rest of them.

363
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:36,180
He certainly is.
That boy's got real spark.

364
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:37,472
Lots of spirit.

365
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:40,893
Throws himself heart and soul
into everything he does.

366
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:45,480
That's really worth something if it can
be turned in the right direction.

367
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,608
Fat chance of that.

368
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,903
Oh, I plan to cheat, of course.

369
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:53,197
Use magic.

370
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,617
Every last trick in the trade if I have to.

371
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:11,048
I'd give anything to go riding about
on a great white charger,

372
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:15,093
slaying dragons and griffins
and man-eating giants.

373
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:19,598
- Well, won't you?
- Oh, no.

374
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,560
You see, I'm an orphan
and a knight must be of proper birth.

375
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:26,522
I only hope I'm worthy
to be Kay's squire.

376
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,857
That's a big job too, you know.

377
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,859
Oh, indeed. Yes, yes.

378
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:34,279
I would say almost impossible.

379
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:38,700
Yes. Well, now then,
when I said I could swim like a fish,

380
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:41,203
I really meant as a fish.

381
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,998
You mean you can turn yourself
into a fish?

382
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:47,876
After all, I happen to be a wizard.

383
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,711
Could you turn me into a fish?

384
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:54,091
Do you have any imagination?
Can you imagine yourself as a fish?

385
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,884
Oh, that's easy.

386
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,595
- I've done that lots of times.
- Oh.

387
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,224
Well, good. Then I think that my magic
can do the rest.

388
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:05,018
Uh...

389
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:08,730
Archimedes, what is that fish formula?

390
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:14,361
Who? Who? What?

391
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,905
You know, that Latin business.

392
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:20,784
Fish? Latin? Oh, uh...

393
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:25,080
Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus.

394
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:30,043
And now, if you don't mind,
I say good day to the both of you.

395
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,670
If you please.

396
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:36,466
When he stays out all night
he's always grumpy the next morning.

397
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,887
- He must stay out every night.
- Yes, yes.

398
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:45,100
Oh. Oh, yes. I say, that's very good, boy.

399
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,519
Who? What, what?

400
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,314
All right, boy. All set. Here we go.

401
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:53,066
Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus quom.

402
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,402
Aquadigitarium.

403
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,576
Merlin, am I a fish?
Am I a fish?

404
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,120
Yes, yes, yes, you are a fish.

405
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,831
If you don't stop
flipping and flopping around

406
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:10,250
and get in the water you won't last long.

407
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:18,091
Now, stay right here in the tules
and I'll be with you in a minute.

408
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:38,779
So, you thought you could take right off
like a shot, did you?

409
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,202
Well, I am a fish, aren't I?

410
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:48,580
You merely look like a fish.

411
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:51,041
That doesn't mean
you can swim like one.

412
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:53,293
You don't have the instinct.

413
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:57,798
So, you'll have to use your brain
for a change.

414
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,300
You are living between two planes now,

415
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:04,012
somewhere between the ceiling
and the floor.

416
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:11,812
Now, there are lots of ups and downs,
like a helicopter.

417
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,565
- Helicopter?
- Yes.

418
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:17,526
It... It... No, never mind.

419
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:21,738
Every flick of a fin creates movement.

420
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:25,325
So, first we'll start with the caudal fin.

421
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,122
No, no, boy. Your tail, tail.

422
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:39,548
Now, that gives you the forward thrust.
Now, let's get a rhythm.

423
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:43,218
Right, left, right, left

424
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:46,763
One, two, left and right

425
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,724
By day and night

426
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:52,311
That's what makes the world go round

427
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:56,064
In and out
Thin and stout

428
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:59,693
That's what makes the world go round

429
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:03,197
For every up there is a down

430
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,449
- For every square
- There is a round?

431
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:06,700
Yes.

432
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:10,454
- For every high
- There is a low?

433
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:11,872
And for every to

434
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,332
- There is a...
- Fro.

435
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,791
- Fro?
- Yes, fro.

436
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,711
To and fro, stop and go

437
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:21,673
That's what makes the world go round

438
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:24,676
In and out
Thin and stout

439
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,386
Merlin? Merlin?

440
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:29,097
- I swallowed a bug.
- Oh.

441
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:32,768
What's wrong with that?
After all, boy, you are a fish.

442
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,728
Instincts, you know.

443
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,897
But you said I had no instinct.

444
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,565
Yes. Oh.

445
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,568
Oh, I did. That's neither here nor there.

446
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:44,404
The main thing is, you must...

447
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:47,449
Set your sights upon the heights

448
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:50,077
Don't be a mediocrity

449
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,287
- Mediocrity?
- That's right.

450
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:55,082
Don't just wait and trust to fate

451
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:58,418
And say that's how it's meant to be

452
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,505
It's up to you how far you go

453
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:04,716
If you don't try you'll never know

454
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,761
And so, my lad, as I've explained

455
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:11,014
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

456
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:29,283
Let's... Let's swim through
that tall grass again. It tickles.

457
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,712
Oh. Oh, I beg your pardon.

458
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:43,172
Me, too.

459
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,924
For every to there is a fro

460
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:48,677
For every stop there is a go

461
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,347
And that's what makes
the world go round

462
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,725
Oh, let go, let go, let go.

463
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,313
You big bug-eyed bully, you.

464
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,190
Who, me?

465
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:04,109
Oh, here, here, here,
here, here now, boy.

466
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,695
No sense going around
insulting bullfrogs.

467
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:11,033
A fish has plenty of other problems
without that.

468
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:14,495
The water world has its forests
and its jungles, too.

469
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:17,623
So, it has its tigers and its wolves.

470
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:18,999
But that...

471
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:22,002
That's what makes the world go round

472
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:24,505
You see, my boy
it's nature's way

473
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,466
Upon the weak
the strong ones prey

474
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:30,344
In human life, it's also true

475
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:33,222
The strong will try to conquer you

476
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,849
That is what you must expect

477
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:38,852
Unless you use your intellect

478
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,355
Brains and brawn
Weak and strong

479
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,441
- Merlin, help, help!
- That's what makes the worl...

480
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,527
Jehoshaphat!

481
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:58,580
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.
- No, no, you're on your own, lad.

482
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:02,793
- Now's your chance to prove my point.
- What point?

483
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:06,713
He's the brawn and you're the brain.
Now, don't panic!

484
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:10,008
You use your head.
Outsmart the big brute.

485
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:16,056
Smart move, lad.
That's using the old intellect.

486
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:03,395
Bravo, boy. Great strategy.

487
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:07,107
- Is the lesson about over?
- Did you get the point?

488
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:09,484
Yes, yes, brain over brawn.

489
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,320
OK, lad, I'll fix the big brute.

490
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,113
Higgly piggly... No, no.

491
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:15,449
Hocus pocus... No! What the blazes...

492
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:18,118
- Hey didda dihicka...
- Merlin!

493
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:22,372
Hmm? Now what?

494
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:25,918
Oh, is it that, that boy?

495
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:29,004
- What in blazes...
- Help, help!

496
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,839
Help!

497
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:33,467
Ouch!

498
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,601
Help!

499
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,811
Hmm? Oh...

500
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,274
Archimedes!

501
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:50,859
Help!

502
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:19,471
What... What in...

503
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:22,516
What in thunder is a monster like that
doing in the moat?

504
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,601
By George, I...

505
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,187
I'll turn him into a minnow.

506
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:30,524
- Merlin.
- Oh, there you are, boy.

507
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:33,402
Snick, snack, snorrel.

508
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:36,864
How in the world
did you ever get out of that mess?

509
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,533
That big fish almost swallowed me,

510
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:42,286
and Archimedes, he, he saved me.

511
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,037
Well, by Jove.

512
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,206
Now, what do you know about that?

513
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,711
I...
I did nothing of the sort!

514
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,880
I intended to eat him.

515
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:55,215
Young perch is my favorite dish.

516
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:58,552
- You know that.
- Oh...

517
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:02,264
- Do you believe that, Wart?
- Well, I...

518
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:04,641
Wart! Wart!

519
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,227
I've got to go. Thank you, Merlin.

520
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:10,022
It was so much fun. And Archimedes, I...

521
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:12,733
- Pin feathers, boy.
- Wart!

522
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:15,903
- Where are you, Wart?
- Coming! I'm coming.

523
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:19,072
Now, Archimedes,

524
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:23,494
why would you half drown yourself
for a tidbit of fish?

525
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:26,413
And after such a big breakfast.

526
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:30,209
Pin feathers and gully fluff.

527
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,837
We were doing fine
until we got in deep water.

528
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:38,425
Then along comes this huge pike
with big jaws and sharp jagged teeth.

529
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:41,845
- Oh, turn him off, Dad.
- He was a monster.

530
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,514
The biggest fish I ever saw.

531
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:47,768
And, boy, that's the biggest fish story
I ever heard.

532
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:51,522
- But it's true, sir.
- That's three demerits for being late

533
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:54,191
and three more for the fish story.

534
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:55,901
Now, hop it to the kitchen!

535
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:59,655
I told you the Wart was loony.

536
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:04,618
He's either out of his head or
there's something fishy going on here.

537
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,374
For every high there is a low

538
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:14,086
For every to there is a fro

539
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:17,548
To and fro
Stop and go

540
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:20,926
That's what makes the world go round

541
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:25,973
- Oh, it's you, Merlin, sir.
- Yes, my lad.

542
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:30,727
Now, have you ever considered
being a squirrel?

543
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:34,022
- No, I don't suppose.
- Well, now,

544
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:38,402
there is a tiny creature
with enormous problems.

545
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,822
How he has survived
throughout the ages

546
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:44,783
is one of nature's big mysteries.

547
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,619
His life is hazardous.

548
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,496
Downright dangerous.

549
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:52,958
Would you like to try it?

550
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,459
Oh, no, I'd better not.

551
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:55,669
Oh.

552
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:59,506
Too dangerous for you, eh?

553
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:01,758
Oh, no, it's not that.

554
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:05,179
It's just that I've got six demerits.
All this work to do.

555
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:07,514
What a mess.

556
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:11,018
What a medieval muddle.
We'll have to modernize it.

557
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,604
Start an assembly line system.

558
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:16,940
All right, now.

559
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:19,151
A one and a two and a three and a four.

560
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,036
Higitus, figitus,
migitus, mum

561
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,996
Tittendy, bittendy, buttondy, dum

562
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,002
But I'm supposed to do it.

563
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:38,962
No one will know the difference, son

564
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,089
Who cares
as long as the work gets done?

565
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:50,974
Rubbety, scrubbety, sweepity, flew

566
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:57,105
Come on, son, let's go, let's go.

567
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:16,208
Wart!

568
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,085
Wart!

569
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:21,129
Wart, take it easy. Take it easy, boy.

570
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:24,174
Wart! Oh, no, boy. No, no!

571
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:27,344
- Wart!
- Wha... Wait. Whoa!

572
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:31,807
Now, what did I tell you?
Always look before you leap.

573
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,601
Well, I made it, didn't I?

574
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:36,687
Yes, yes, you made it, you made it.

575
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,148
But you can't always trust to luck, boy.

576
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:45,112
Now, first you start with the short jumps.

577
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:48,490
Gauge the distance carefully and...

578
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:54,663
There, you see?
Even then you can miss.

579
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:58,917
So, don't take gravity too lightly
or it'll catch up with you.

580
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:02,796
- What's gravity?
- Gravity's what causes you to fall.

581
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:06,675
- Oh, like a stumble or a trip?
- Yes, like a stumble or a...

582
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:09,803
No, no, no.
It's the force that pulls you downward.

583
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:14,600
The phenomenon that
any two material particles or bodies,

584
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:19,271
if free to move,
will be accelerated toward each other.

585
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:36,997
Merlin, how will we get by?

586
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,499
Hmm? Oh.

587
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:42,419
Well, I suppose we better go back
to a sidetrack.

588
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:49,301
Go on, go on. You've got lots of room.

589
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:56,475
Well, I guess she can't be sidetracked.

590
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:59,561
That's a girl squirrel
and a redhead, at that.

591
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,993
- She sure acts funny.
- She likes you.

592
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:16,078
Why?

593
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:20,290
Yes, well. Well, that's nature again.

594
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:23,126
But I'm afraid there's no time to explain.

595
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,671
Here now,
you'd better leave me out of it.

596
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,883
Yeah. Me, too.

597
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:32,928
Merlin.

598
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:35,597
- Merlin!
- You're on your own, lad.

599
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:38,350
I'm afraid magic
can't solve this problem.

600
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:42,354
Look, I'm not a boy... I mean...

601
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:45,107
I'm not a squirrel, I'm a boy.

602
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,860
A human boy, not a real sq...

603
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:52,489
Oh, leave me alone.

604
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,828
Merlin, what will I do?
She won't leave me...

605
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:05,919
Well, I'm afraid you're stuck, lad.
When a girl squirrel chooses a mate,

606
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:07,337
it's for life.

607
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,506
But I won't be a squirrel tomorrow.

608
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,051
She doesn't know that.
She only knows one simple fact,

609
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:15,929
that you're a him and she's a her.

610
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:19,266
It's a natural phenomenon.

611
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:20,767
Phenomenon?

612
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:22,728
Well, it's the...

613
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:27,774
It's a state of being,
a frame of mind

614
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,652
It's a most befuddling thing

615
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:33,572
And to every being
Of every kind

616
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:35,866
It is discomboomerating

617
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,661
You're wasting time resisting

618
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:42,664
You'll find the more you do

619
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:45,626
The more she'll keep insisting

620
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:48,629
Her "him" has got to be you

621
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:50,172
Now, leave me alone.

622
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:51,632
I mean it!

623
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,259
It's a rough game, anyone knows

624
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:55,969
Go away!

625
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:00,307
There are no rules
Anything goes

626
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:06,647
There's no logical explanation
for this discomboomeration

627
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:10,984
It's a most bemuddling
most befuddling thing

628
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:17,741
Oof. Who? Who? What the...

629
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:20,994
Now, go on, shoo.
Get a tree of your own.

630
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:22,621
Skedaddle.

631
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,735
Oh, you squirrelly squirrels!

632
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,573
Ha ha! She's gaining on you, Wart.

633
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:04,663
There's no sensible explanation
for this discomboomeration

634
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:07,916
It's a most hodgepodge-ical
most illogical

635
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,586
Most confuse-ling, most bamboozling

636
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:14,882
Most bemuddling
Most befuddling

637
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:16,717
Thing

638
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,307
Really, now, Miss...

639
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,850
Madam, I...

640
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,477
You, you've made a mistake.

641
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:30,230
Now, now, now, please.

642
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:32,149
Madam. Madam!

643
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,362
Look here.

644
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:41,158
I am not a boy.
I mean, I am not a squirrel.

645
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,826
I'm a boy.

646
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,536
No, that's not what I meant.

647
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:46,288
No!

648
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:49,416
No, I'm a stupid old...

649
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,918
No!

650
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:54,046
I'm an old man.

651
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,131
An old hu... man.

652
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:58,425
Understand?

653
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:05,307
Oh, hang it all. Now, go away.

654
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:07,643
Shoo, shoo.

655
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:17,236
Impossible. Impossible.

656
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:22,115
Confound it.

657
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:24,368
Confound it all!

658
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:30,415
Merlin, I'm tired of being a squirrel.
It's nothing but trouble.

659
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:33,627
You've got trouble? Look at my...
Look back there!

660
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,047
One side, lad.

661
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:43,136
Help, Merlin, help!

662
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:43,697
By George!

663
00:47:47,493 --> 00:47:49,828
I've had enough
of this nonsense.

664
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:52,706
Alakazam.

665
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,673
There. You see? I'm an ugly, horrible,
grouchy old man.

666
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:11,391
- Merlin.
- Oh.

667
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:15,395
- So, here we are.
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.

668
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,648
Snick, snack, snorrel.

669
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:23,904
There. Now you see? I'm not a squirrel.

670
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:26,156
I'm a boy.

671
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:30,035
I tried to tell you. I'm a boy.

672
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:31,995
A human boy.

673
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:34,248
Oh...

674
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:36,875
If you could only understand.

675
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:51,306
Ah... You know, lad,
that love business is a powerful thing.

676
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:57,688
Greater than gravity?

677
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:00,440
Well, yes, boy, in its way.

678
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:05,237
I'd... Yes, I'd say it's
the greatest force on earth.

679
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:19,585
Ector! Ector!

680
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:22,004
Sir Ector, the kitchen!

681
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:23,380
Hold it, son.

682
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:26,758
- Madness all over the place.
- Kay!

683
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,677
Hold that, I say.

684
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:37,311
Now, what's all the commotion?

685
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:40,481
The kitchen, it's under an evil spell.

686
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:42,065
- Huh?
- It's bewitched.

687
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:45,027
No! I bet it's that old goat, Marvin.

688
00:49:45,152 --> 00:49:47,821
Come on, son.
I knew he'd give us trouble.

689
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,245
Gadzooks!

690
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,665
Black magic of the worst kind!

691
00:49:58,707 --> 00:50:01,210
Come on, Kay, to the attack!

692
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,730
Heaven preserve us!

693
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:24,358
Kay!

694
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:47,673
- Now, what have we here?
- Jumpin' hop toads.

695
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,009
Alakazam!

696
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:58,058
So there you are, you old goat.

697
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:04,565
What's the idea of flinging
your evil spells all over the place?

698
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:06,525
Oh, lend me a hand, boy.

699
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:14,449
Well, what have you got
to say for yourself? Hmm?

700
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:19,788
You call washing dishes
and sweeping floors a work of evil?

701
00:51:19,872 --> 00:51:23,000
I'll decide what's right and wrong
around here.

702
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,836
Besides, that's the Wart's job,
one of his duties.

703
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:28,172
Look here, boy.

704
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:31,592
If you want to make that trip to London,
you'd better toe the mark.

705
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:33,260
You old goat!

706
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:36,722
If I ever catch you
in my kitchen again, I'll...

707
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:39,766
Madam, you won't.

708
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:41,685
Oh, dear.

709
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:43,645
He's gone.

710
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:45,814
Well, by Jove.

711
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:48,650
We ought to run the old geezer
right out of the castle.

712
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:51,653
Oh, no. No, no, Kay, no.

713
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:54,406
He might cast an evil spell
on the lot of us.

714
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:56,783
Turn us all into stone. Shh.

715
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:59,786
No, there's no telling
what the old devil might do.

716
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,538
He's not an old devil!

717
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:05,751
He... He's good
and his magic is good, too.

718
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:09,213
- If... If you just leave him alone.
- Now, look here, Wart.

719
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:12,716
- That's three more demerits.
- Box his ears, Dad.

720
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:17,304
Just because you can't understand
something, it doesn't mean it's wrong.

721
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:18,889
Ten more demerits!

722
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:21,892
You make all the rules
and nobody else can say anything.

723
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,727
You've said a-plenty, boy.

724
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,814
All that popping off
just cooked your goose. Kay!

725
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:30,108
From now on,
young Hobbs is your squire.

726
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,485
Did you hear that, Wart?

727
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:35,489
Hobbs is going to be Kay's squire.

728
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:37,115
Y... Yes, sir.

729
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:40,369
That will teach you to pop off,
you little pipsqueak.

730
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:55,717
Oh, I'm sorry, lad.

731
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:58,679
I'm sorry. I spoiled everything.

732
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,182
I know that trip to London
means a great deal to you.

733
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:04,351
Oh, it's not your fault.

734
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:06,353
I shouldn't have popped off.

735
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:08,522
Now I'm really done for.

736
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:11,316
No, no, you're in a great spot, boy.

737
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,653
You can't go down now.
It can only be up from here.

738
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:16,363
I'd like to know how.

739
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:17,865
Use your head.

740
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:19,825
An education, lad.

741
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:25,789
- What good will that do?
- Get it first, then, who knows?

742
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:27,332
Are you willing to try?

743
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,878
Well,
what have I got to lose?

744
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:33,463
That's the spirit. We'll start tomorrow.

745
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:35,799
We'll show 'em, won't we, boy?

746
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:37,634
We sure will.

747
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,889
Now, first of all, lad,

748
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:45,517
we've got to get all of these
medieval ideas out of your head.

749
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:48,395
Clear the way for new ideas.

750
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:53,650
Knowledge of man's fabulous
discoveries in the centuries ahead.

751
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,861
Now, that will be a great advantage.

752
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:57,821
Advantage, indeed!

753
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:01,950
If the boy says the world is round
they'll take him for a lunatic.

754
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:04,912
- The world is round?
- Yes, yes, that's right.

755
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:08,457
And it also goes around.

756
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,255
- You mean, it'll be round someday?
- No, no, no. It's round now.

757
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:18,133
Man will discover this
in centuries to come.

758
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:19,968
And he will also find

759
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:25,182
that the world is merely a tiny speck
in the universe.

760
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:28,352
- Universe?
- Ah. You're only confusing the boy.

761
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:32,397
He'll be so mixed up he'll...
He'll be wearing his shoes on his head.

762
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:34,691
Man has always learned from the past.

763
00:54:34,775 --> 00:54:37,110
After all, you can't learn history
in reverse.

764
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:39,947
It's confusing enough,
for heaven's sakes.

765
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:43,116
All right. All right.

766
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,453
Have it your way, Archimedes.
You're in charge.

767
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:48,372
You're the headmaster now.

768
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:50,958
So, from now on he's your pupil.

769
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:56,088
So, from now on, boy,

770
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:58,048
you do as I say.

771
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:00,050
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

772
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:04,304
Now, to start off,
I want you to read these books.

773
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:05,639
All of them?

774
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,976
That, my boy,
is a mountain of knowledge.

775
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:12,229
- But I can't read.
- What, what? What!

776
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:15,149
- I don't suppose you know how to write?
- No, sir.

777
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,651
- Well, what do you know?
- Well, I...

778
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:21,655
Never mind, never mind.
We'll start at the bottom. The ABC's.

779
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:26,743
First the A and now the B.

780
00:55:26,827 --> 00:55:30,497
Loop and around and there's the C.

781
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:33,625
Merlin, look. I can write!

782
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:36,336
Oh, yes, yes. That's very good, boy.

783
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:38,505
Hen scratch, that's all. Hen scratch.

784
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:42,092
Now, come on. D, E, F.

785
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:44,344
And now the G.

786
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:48,015
You see, it's as simple as...
No, no, no, no, boy!

787
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:52,394
Use your head, use your head, will you?
How do you expect to learn anything?

788
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:53,562
Archimedes.

789
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:59,193
Have you seen
that flying machine model?

790
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:03,363
I have nothing to do with your
futuristic fiddle-faddle, you know that.

791
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,074
- What's that thing up there?
- Hmm?

792
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:09,036
Oh, yes, of course. Here we are.

793
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,872
Do you mean man will fly
in one of those someday?

794
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:15,834
If man were meant to fly,
he'd have been born with wings.

795
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:21,715
I am about to prove otherwise,
Archimedes, if you care to watch.

796
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:24,593
Here she goes!

797
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:27,721
No, no, no!

798
00:56:29,723 --> 00:56:32,559
Man will fly, all right.

799
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:34,853
Just like a rock.

800
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:42,736
It would have worked if...
If it weren't for this infernal beard.

801
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:55,833
I never...

802
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:58,794
Never in my whole...

803
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:07,427
Man will fly someday, I tell you.

804
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:10,472
I have been there. I have seen it.

805
00:57:10,556 --> 00:57:15,102
Oh, I do hope so.
I've always dreamed about flying.

806
00:57:15,144 --> 00:57:18,689
That I was a bird and that
I could go sailing all over the sky,

807
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:20,440
high above everything.

808
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:24,111
Avis alitus avita atheta.
Prestidigitonium.

809
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:26,280
It's my favorite dream.

810
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:29,908
Oh, but then, I suppose
everybody dreams about flying.

811
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:33,537
I'm a bird, I'm a bird, I'm a bird!

812
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:37,040
Hold it, boy. Not so fast, not so fast.

813
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:41,128
First, I'd better explain
the mechanics of a bird's wing.

814
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:44,715
Now, these large feathers

815
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:48,135
are called the primaries, and...

816
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:52,931
And since when do you know
all about birds' wings?

817
00:57:52,973 --> 00:57:56,894
I have made an extensive study
of birds in flight and I...

818
00:57:56,977 --> 00:58:00,981
And if you don't mind,
I happen to be a bird.

819
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:05,194
All right, Mr. Know-it-All!
He's your pupil.

820
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,528
Ouch.

821
00:58:06,737 --> 00:58:11,825
Now, boy, flying is not merely
some crude mechanical process.

822
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:17,873
It is a delicate art, purely aesthetic,

823
00:58:17,956 --> 00:58:19,666
poetry of motion.

824
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:22,169
And the best way to learn it is to do it.

825
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:26,173
Now, since we're pretty far up,
we'll start with a glide.

826
00:58:26,215 --> 00:58:29,218
Spread your wings way out. Way out!

827
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,636
That's it, that's it.

828
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:33,180
Now, fan your tail.

829
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:37,184
Tippety toe, tippety toe and off we go.

830
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:42,648
Now, tuck your feet under like me.

831
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:45,609
That's it. That's the idea.

832
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:48,195
Whoa. What?

833
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:51,615
And don't fight the air currents.
Use them.

834
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:05,629
Why, say, boy!

835
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:07,756
That's pretty good.

836
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,884
Well, boy, you're a natural.

837
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:14,388
Are you sure this is
the first time that you...

838
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:17,015
Wart, Wart, hawk, hawk!

839
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:20,561
Look out, boy, heads up!
Come on, Wart!

840
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:23,939
Archimedes, help!

841
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:32,990
Wart! Wart!

842
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,919
What? Oh!

843
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,054
Sounds like someone's sick.

844
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:57,973
How lovely.

845
00:59:58,056 --> 00:59:59,975
I do hope it's serious.

846
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:02,352
Something dreadful.

847
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:04,396
Oh, bat gizzards.

848
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:08,609
It's nothing but a scrawny little sparrow
with a beak full of soot.

849
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:12,112
Oh, I'm not really a sparrow. I'm a boy.

850
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:13,947
A boy?

851
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:18,076
Merlin changed me with his magic.
He's the world's most powerful wizard.

852
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:20,120
Merlin!

853
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:23,832
Merlin.
The world's most powerful bungler.

854
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:27,085
Why, boy, I've got more magic
in one little finger.

855
01:00:28,587 --> 01:00:32,841
Now, don't tell me you've never heard
of the marvelous Madam Mim?

856
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:35,552
Well, no, I don't guess so.

857
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:37,054
Madam Mim!

858
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:38,847
Good heavens.

859
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:41,099
Why, boy, I'm the greatest.

860
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:43,393
I'm truly marvelous.

861
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:48,148
With only a touch
I have the power

862
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:49,733
Zim zabberim bim

863
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:52,277
To wither a flower

864
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:55,697
I find delight
in the gruesome and grim

865
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:58,450
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Thank you, my boy.

866
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:02,162
But that's nothing, nothing for me.

867
01:01:02,204 --> 01:01:07,209
'Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous
mad Madam Mim

868
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:10,879
You know what?
I can even change size.

869
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:13,298
I can be huge

870
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:15,551
Fill the whole house

871
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:19,888
I can be teeny
small as a mouse

872
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:23,600
Black sorcery is my dish of tea

873
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,646
It comes easy to me

874
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:32,025
'Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous
mad Madam Mim

875
01:01:35,154 --> 01:01:38,282
Marvelous, boy.
Marvelous, I'm marvelous.

876
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:44,955
Say, lad, did you know
that I can make myself uglier yet?

877
01:01:45,622 --> 01:01:48,000
That would be some trick.

878
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,752
- I mean...
- Want to bet?

879
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:52,713
- Boo!
- Oh!

880
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:55,132
You see? I win, I win!

881
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:57,718
Aren't I hideous, boy?

882
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:01,263
- Perfectly revolting?
- Well, uh... Yes, ma'am.

883
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:04,391
But you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Watch this.

884
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:10,272
I can be beautiful
Lovely and fair

885
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:14,610
Silvery voice
Long purple hair

886
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:18,572
La la la-la
La la la la-la

887
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:22,659
La la-la la la
La-la la-la la la

888
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:27,080
But it's only skin-deep
Zim zabberim zim

889
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:29,708
I'm an ugly old creep

890
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:35,088
The magnificent, marvelous
mad, mad, mad, mad Madam Mim

891
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:40,010
Now what do you think, boy?

892
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:41,637
Who's the greatest?

893
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:46,892
Well, Merlin's magic is always,

894
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:50,604
well, useful for something good.

895
01:02:50,646 --> 01:02:53,649
And he must see
something good in you.

896
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,192
Oh, I suppose so.

897
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:57,569
Yes, and in my book that's bad.

898
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:03,116
So, my boy,
I'm afraid I'll have to destroy you.

899
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,035
De... Destroy me?

900
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:07,663
Yeah, I'll give you a sporting chance.

901
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:10,791
I'm mad about games, you know.

902
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:13,043
Well, come on. Get going, boy.

903
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:15,587
You gotta keep on your toes
in this game.

904
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:28,183
I win, I win!

905
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:29,434
Oh, the game's over.

906
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,688
Ah!

907
01:03:32,771 --> 01:03:34,606
Why, you little devil, you!

908
01:03:34,648 --> 01:03:37,234
I'll wring your scrawny little neck.

909
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:39,778
Mim. Mim!

910
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,197
What... What are you up to?

911
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:44,116
Oh, Merlin.

912
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:48,328
Well, you're just in time.
We were playing a little game.

913
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:50,289
She was going to destroy me.

914
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:53,542
And just what are you gonna do
about it?

915
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:57,171
Want to fight?
Want to have a wizards' duel?

916
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:00,340
As you wish, Madam.

917
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:03,427
Well, come on. Step outside.

918
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,429
After you, Madam.

919
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:20,652
What... What's up, boy?
What's going on?

920
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:23,197
They're having a wizards' duel.
What's that?

921
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,865
Oh, it's a battle of wits.

922
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:27,618
The players change themselves
to different things

923
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:32,414
- and attempt to destroy one another.
- De... Destroy?

924
01:04:32,498 --> 01:04:34,666
Just watch, boy. You'll get the idea.

925
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:40,172
First, if you don't mind,

926
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:43,050
- I'll make the rules.
- Rules, indeed.

927
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:45,594
She only wants rules
so she can break them.

928
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:49,014
I'll take care of you later, featherbrain.

929
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:52,434
Rule one, no mineral or vegetable.

930
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:53,769
Only animal.

931
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:58,774
Rule two, no make-believe things
like, pink dragons and stuff.

932
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:02,069
Rule three, no disappearing.

933
01:05:02,152 --> 01:05:05,197
No. Rule four, no cheating.

934
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:07,908
All right, all right. Now, pace off 10.

935
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:13,080
One, two, three, four...

936
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:15,707
- Merlin, she disappeared.
- Huh?

937
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:19,586
Mim, now, you made the rules.

938
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:27,135
Ouch! Ooh!

939
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,144
Change to something else, Merlin.

940
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:37,563
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Give me time to think.

941
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:41,942
Higgity figgity... No, no.

942
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:43,443
Quick, Merlin, hurry!

943
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:45,445
Hoppity hip.

944
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:46,905
A-ha!

945
01:05:49,741 --> 01:05:51,326
Madam, just a minute.

946
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,120
This is not...

947
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:01,879
- Come on, something bigger.
- Something smaller.

948
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:03,505
Mim... Mim...

949
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,890
Merlin?

950
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,766
No disappearing.

951
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:16,310
Whew!

952
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:19,062
Oh! Oh, oh!

953
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,992
Ouch!

954
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:40,417
Mim? Mim?

955
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:43,795
Are you... What's going on here?

956
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,173
You... You big blimp.

957
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:59,853
Squash me, will ya?

958
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:07,694
Ah, ah, ah, ah, Merlin.

959
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:10,656
Ouch! Ooh!

960
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:12,157
Bravo.

961
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:17,913
Just you wait, just you wait.
You're gonna pay.

962
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:37,349
So, you want to play rough, do you?

963
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,395
All right, Merlin.

964
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:45,107
I'll smash you good, you old crab.

965
01:07:45,816 --> 01:07:47,568
Jehoshaphat.

966
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:53,115
Here I come, Mim, ready or not.

967
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,119
Merlin, you wouldn't dare.

968
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:58,912
Merlin!

969
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:11,967
Now, Mim, Mim,
no dragons, remember?

970
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,013
Did I say no purple dragons? Did I?

971
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,113
I win, I win!

972
01:08:33,155 --> 01:08:36,950
Oh, that horrible old witch.
I'll peck her eyes out.

973
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:38,285
No, no.

974
01:08:42,164 --> 01:08:44,458
- He's gone.
- Disappeared.

975
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,793
Madam,
I have not disappeared.

976
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:48,921
I am very tiny.

977
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:52,257
I am a germ, a rare disease.

978
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:55,135
I'm called Malagalee Telopterosis.

979
01:08:55,177 --> 01:08:57,721
And you caught me, Mim.

980
01:08:57,805 --> 01:09:00,015
What?

981
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:02,893
First, you break out into spots.

982
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:09,399
Followed by hot and cold flashes.

983
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:12,986
Then violent sneezing.

984
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:15,906
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...

985
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:17,199
Ah-choo!

986
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:19,409
Watch it, boy.

987
01:09:19,952 --> 01:09:21,787
Oh! You, you, you...

988
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:24,164
You sneaky old scoundrel!

989
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:35,175
It's not too serious, Madam.
You should recover in a few weeks

990
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:39,138
and be as good...
I mean, as bad, as ever.

991
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:41,473
But I would suggest plenty of rest

992
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:45,561
and lots and lots of sunshine.

993
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:48,522
I hate sunshine.

994
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:52,734
I hate horrible, wholesome sunshine!

995
01:09:52,818 --> 01:09:54,528
I hate it, I hate it!

996
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:57,156
I hate, hate, hate...

997
01:09:57,573 --> 01:10:01,535
You were really great, Merlin.
But you could have been killed.

998
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:04,788
It was worth it, lad,
if you learned something from it.

999
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:08,292
Knowledge and wisdom
is the real power.

1000
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:12,004
Right you are, Wart.
So, stick to your schooling, boy.

1001
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:14,715
Oh, don't worry. I will, sir. I will.

1002
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:16,133
Oh, I really will.

1003
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:21,680
We will sing
all night and all day

1004
01:10:21,722 --> 01:10:27,019
We will fight for the blue oak tree
On a field of white

1005
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,062
For the blue oak tree

1006
01:10:29,146 --> 01:10:34,568
On a field of white

1007
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:44,286
Here's to victory in London
for my son, Kay.

1008
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:47,706
Sir Kay. I've been knighted, don't forget.

1009
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:51,376
Oh, of course, son, of course.

1010
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:53,212
Here's to Sir Kay.

1011
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:57,090
And who knows?
The future king of all England.

1012
01:10:57,674 --> 01:10:59,343
Watch it, will ya?

1013
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:01,220
Kay the king?

1014
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:03,764
What a dreadful thought.

1015
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:08,185
Sir Ector, Sir Ector,
Hobbs has come down with the mumps.

1016
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:12,439
He's all puffed up like a toad.

1017
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:15,651
Then Kay will need another squire,
hang it all.

1018
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:18,695
- Wart, you're it.
- I'm what, sir?

1019
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:21,448
Kay's squire. You're going to London.

1020
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:24,201
Oh, Sir Ector! Wha... Wait. Whoa!

1021
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:30,207
Merlin, Archimedes, Merlin!

1022
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,170
Merlin, look! I'm a squire.

1023
01:11:36,088 --> 01:11:37,297
Ha!

1024
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:42,886
Oh. Very nice, boy.

1025
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,805
Yes, indeed.

1026
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:48,892
A fine monkey suit for polishing boots.

1027
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:51,353
It's what all squires wear.

1028
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:54,439
And I thought you were going
to amount to something.

1029
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:56,608
I thought you had a few brains!

1030
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,946
Great future. Ha!

1031
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:04,950
A stooge for that big lunk, Kay.

1032
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:07,661
Congratulations, boy!

1033
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:10,247
What do you want me to be?

1034
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,166
I'm nobody. You...

1035
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:15,669
You don't know a thing
about what's going on today.

1036
01:12:15,752 --> 01:12:18,505
I'm lucky to be Kay's squire.

1037
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:23,343
Oh! Of all the idiotic...
I...

1038
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:25,304
Blow me to Bermuda!

1039
01:12:33,312 --> 01:12:37,649
- Where did he go?
- To Bermuda, I suppose.

1040
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:40,777
- Where's that?
- Oh, an island way off somewhere

1041
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:44,781
- that hasn't been discovered yet.
- Will he ever come back?

1042
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:47,618
Who knows? Who knows anything?

1043
01:12:52,331 --> 01:12:55,459
For the crown of all England,

1044
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:57,878
let the tournament begin!

1045
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:20,108
Kay! Now, it's up to the swords.

1046
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:22,486
Swords? Swords?

1047
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:24,321
Oh, no!

1048
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:26,907
- Kay.
- What? What?

1049
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:30,494
I... I forgot your sword.

1050
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:33,038
Forgot my sword!

1051
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:36,041
I... I left it back at the inn.

1052
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:39,753
Why, you bungling little fool!

1053
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:43,257
You'd better get it,
or don't you dare come back!

1054
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:50,264
Let me in, let me in!

1055
01:13:51,056 --> 01:13:53,642
Somebody, please! Please let me in!

1056
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:56,895
It's no use, boy,
they've all gone to the tournament.

1057
01:13:56,937 --> 01:14:00,774
Oh, what will I do?
Kay's got to have a sword.

1058
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:03,819
Look, boy. Look.
There in the churchyard.

1059
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:07,030
A sword. Oh, Archimedes. A sword!

1060
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:11,285
You're gonna have a time pulling it out.

1061
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:14,121
Watch it, boy.

1062
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:24,631
Better leave it alone.

1063
01:14:24,673 --> 01:14:28,177
But Kay's got to have a sword.

1064
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:32,806
Now, come on, quick.
Let's get out of here.

1065
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:38,312
You're up next, son. Better get ready.

1066
01:14:38,395 --> 01:14:40,522
Kay, Kay, here's a sword.

1067
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:46,028
- This is not my sword.
- Hold on, Kay.

1068
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:47,529
Wait a minute.

1069
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:50,782
"Whoso pulleth out this sword..."

1070
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:54,495
It's the sword in the stone.

1071
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:57,956
The sword in the stone? It can't be.

1072
01:14:57,998 --> 01:14:59,291
But look, it is.

1073
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:02,836
- It's the marvelous sword.
- Hold everything.

1074
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,673
Someone's pulled the sword
from the stone!

1075
01:15:07,174 --> 01:15:09,676
Where did you get it, Wart?

1076
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,055
I pulled it out of an anvil
that was on a stone

1077
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:14,681
in, in a churchyard.

1078
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:20,729
The lad's a young Samson.

1079
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:23,649
You're making a fool of us, boy.

1080
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:26,777
- Now, tell the truth.
- But I did, sir.

1081
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:30,113
Then come on. Prove it.
To the stone with you.

1082
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:32,741
Yes, prove it.

1083
01:15:32,825 --> 01:15:35,035
Come on! Prove it!

1084
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:45,379
All right, boy, let's have the miracle.

1085
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:52,219
Now, wait a minute.

1086
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:55,889
Anyone can pull it once it's been pulled.

1087
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,061
Go to it, Kay. Give it all you've got.

1088
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,106
Put your back into it.

1089
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:07,025
- Get out.
- Push him aside.

1090
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:12,739
- Hold on. That's not fair.
- I say we let the boy try it.

1091
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:16,076
That's what I say.
Give the boy a chance.

1092
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,911
Go ahead, son.

1093
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:34,636
It's a miracle, ordained by heaven.

1094
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,097
This boy is our king.

1095
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:39,975
Well, by Jove.

1096
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:42,936
- What's the lad's name?
- Wart.

1097
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:45,272
Oh, I mean, Arthur.

1098
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:47,232
Hail, King Arthur!

1099
01:16:47,274 --> 01:16:51,111
Hail, King Arthur!
Long live the King!

1100
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,615
I can't believe it.

1101
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:57,826
Oh, forgive me, son.

1102
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:01,747
- Forgive me.
- Oh, please don't, sir.

1103
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:04,750
Kay, bow down to your king.

1104
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:14,468
So, at last,
the miracle had come to pass

1105
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:17,638
in that far-off time
upon New Year's Day.

1106
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:22,059
And the glorious reign
of King Arthur was begun.

1107
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:27,481
I can't be a king, Archimedes.

1108
01:17:27,564 --> 01:17:30,150
I don't know anything
about ruling a country.

1109
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:34,112
I told you to leave the thing
in the stone, boy.

1110
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:37,157
I'll run away, that's what I'll do.

1111
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:43,705
- They'll have to get somebody else.
- Better take the side door.

1112
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:45,541
Out the side door.

1113
01:17:49,419 --> 01:17:52,840
Hail, King Arthur!
Long live the king!

1114
01:17:55,008 --> 01:17:58,387
There's another door over there.
Over there, come on. Come on.

1115
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:04,143
Long live King Arthur!

1116
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:06,019
Long live...

1117
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:09,690
Looks like we're surrounded, boy.

1118
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:13,110
Oh, Archimedes, I wish Merlin was here.

1119
01:18:15,946 --> 01:18:18,615
Merlin! Merlin!

1120
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:25,330
Oh, Merlin, you're back from Ber... Ber...

1121
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:27,666
Bermuda? Yes.

1122
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:31,295
Back from Bermuda
and the 20th century.

1123
01:18:32,212 --> 01:18:35,674
And believe me, you can have it.

1124
01:18:35,716 --> 01:18:38,552
One big modern mess.

1125
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:40,596
Alakazam.

1126
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:45,309
- I'm in an awful pickle. I'm king.
- He pulled the sword from the stone.

1127
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:46,894
Ha ha!

1128
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:48,896
Of course, of course.

1129
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:52,941
King Arthur
and his Knights of the Round Table.

1130
01:18:53,317 --> 01:18:56,862
- "Round Table"?
- Would you rather have a square one?

1131
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:59,156
Oh, no. Round will be fine.

1132
01:19:00,824 --> 01:19:02,910
Boy, boy, boy.

1133
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:05,120
You'll become a great legend.

1134
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:09,416
They'll be writing books about you
for centuries to come.

1135
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,252
Why, they might even make
a motion picture about you.

1136
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:16,089
- Motion picture?
- Oh.

1137
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:20,219
Well, that's something like television.

1138
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,305
Without commercials.

1139
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:31,438
Hail, King Arthur
Long live the king
