1
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:44,401
There's some more flowers, kids.
Go pick 'em.

2
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:46,568
Yeah!

3
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:52,448
That's a pretty one!

4
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:57,443
- I don't have one.
- Well, go look for one, over there.

5
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:01,202
Oh, that's beautiful. Let me look at that.

6
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,374
Let me look at that!

7
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:08,959
Now you can take them home
to your parents. Don't they smell nice!

8
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:16,763
Hi.

9
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:26,561
Too much trouble to pick the mail up
off the floor, Geoffrey?

10
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:30,981
Hello?

11
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:36,611
Look at this flower.

12
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:44,368
All right! Attaway!

13
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,702
You know, I think I actually
found something rare.

14
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:54,172
What?

15
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:57,667
- This plant. I think it's a grex.
- A what?

16
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:01,666
G-R-E-X. That's when
two species cross-pollinate

17
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:04,674
and produce a third
completely unique one.

18
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,798
And listen to this:

19
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:13,729
"Epilobic, from the Greek epi: upon,
and lobos: a pod."

20
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:17,930
"Many of the species are dangerous
weeds and should be avoided."

21
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:19,347
Dangerous?

22
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,525
In the garden.

23
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:25,025
See? Look how quickly it roots.

24
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:28,656
"Their rapid and widespread growth
was even observed

25
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:31,620
in many of the war-torn cities of Europe."

26
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:35,743
"lndeed, some of these plants
may thrive on devastated ground."

27
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:39,573
Why don't we go up to Vail
for the weekend? Fly up Friday, hm?

28
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,585
OK, maybe. Sure.

29
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:45,001
Geoffrey! I'm trying to read!

30
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:46,792
You're in a good mood.

31
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:50,341
Well, I got something
to look forward to tonight - playoffs.

32
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,380
Geoffrey.

33
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:55,385
- What?
- I'm reading.

34
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:58,933
OK! I'll put the earphones on.
There, see? Happy?

35
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,468
Never mind. I'll go downstairs.

36
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:08,556
Comment? Qui est lÃ ?
Who is it?

37
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,734
Department of Health.

38
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:17,867
Bonsoir, Monsieur Bennell.
How nice to see you.

39
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:41,426
What is that supposed to be?

40
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:44,307
It is cervelles en matelote.

41
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:47,470
In English, what would I be eating
if I ate that?

42
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:51,766
- Ah. Calves' brains in red wine.
- Red wine and what else?

43
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,725
Mais, c'est impossible. It's impossible.
It's a secret, Mr Bennell.

44
00:07:56,862 --> 00:08:01,025
You don't have any secrets
from the Department of Health, Henri.

45
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:04,277
A good young Burgundy, brown stock,

46
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,363
thyme, parsley - just a sprig.

47
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:11,705
Capers,... a fresh bay leaf, and garlic.

48
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,162
- That's all?
- Oui. Yes.

49
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,549
- What is that?
- A caper.

50
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:28,759
No.

51
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,510
Do you presume to tell us
what is in this stock?

52
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:34,345
- It's a rat turd.
- A what?

53
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:36,515
A rat turd.

54
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,059
- A caper!
- A rat turd.

55
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:41,602
A caper!

56
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,689
If it's a caper,

57
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,858
eat it.

58
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:56,444
I'm gonna bring you up
for permit revocation, Henri.

59
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:00,991
You're charging way too much
to be serving crap like that in here.

60
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:05,251
But, Monsieur, it is an accident.
You know how careful we are.

61
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:01,087
Hello?

62
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:02,795
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.

63
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:04,588
- Wake you up?
- No. Hi, Matthew.

64
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:07,094
- They busted the window of my car.
- Oh, no!

65
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:10,472
Threw a bottle of wine at it -
not even good wine.

66
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:13,636
The Warriors won,
so I guess your household's happy.

67
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:15,181
Yes.

68
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:17,472
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

69
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:20,145
If you go to sleep now,
you can get up early.

70
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:21,604
Oh, Matthew...

71
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:25,898
If you can come in at 7.30,
you can run the tests before 8 o'clock.

72
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,158
Stop! Matthew... stop.
I'm not coming in before 8 o'clock

73
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:34,032
- in the morning!
- I gotta force the abatement hearing.

74
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:37,329
- Wednesday's their only free slot.
- No, Matthew!

75
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:39,414
I will not be there before eight!

76
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:42,662
I nominated you for
Civil Servant ofthe Year award.

77
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:44,836
It's true. I think you'll win.

78
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:50,041
OK, OK, OK. I'll be in at 7.30.
I'll run a salmonella test for you.

79
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:52,254
Thank you. See you in the morning.

80
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:54,593
Good night. I'll see you in the morning.

81
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,845
- Bye.
- Bye.

82
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:31,213
Geoffrey, my God!
How long have you been up?

83
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,386
Not long.

84
00:12:34,307 --> 00:12:36,596
What are you doing?

85
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,559
Geoffrey?

86
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:41,536
I wanna throw the book at him. Those
scallops are just cut-up pieces of skate.

87
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:44,418
I'm sorry. I can start the tests right away.

88
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:47,415
It's OK...
And something's wrong with the potato.

89
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:50,632
Either the sour cream is phoney,
or the chives.

90
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,214
I'm sorry. I got up on time.
It was Geoffrey.

91
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:58,220
- What did the mad dentist do this time?
- I don't know. He was just weird.

92
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:00,887
He's crazy. All dentists are crazy.

93
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,890
- Are you late?
- No.

94
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,142
He was weird not the way he usually is.

95
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,764
That can only be an improvement.

96
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:14,857
Well, it's not. It's got me really nervous.

97
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:17,028
Tell him to shape up or get out.

98
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:20,193
- It's his house.
- Make him an offer.

99
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:23,362
- Here's something that'll cheer you up.
- What?

100
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:25,487
Ever seen one of these up close?

101
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:27,780
- What is it?
- What does it look like?

102
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:29,411
- A caper?
- A caper?

103
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:30,706
What is it?

104
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:33,919
- A rat turd, but the sauce was delicious.
- I got you a rat.

105
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:37,083
- Did you find one?
- I've got it. It was a biggie.

106
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:40,500
OK, we'll get a declaration
of "unsanitary" on him.

107
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,384
- I'll talk to you later, OK?
- OK.

108
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:46,802
- What can I do?
- Nothing. Don't worry. Go on.

109
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:48,972
I'm sorry.

110
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:51,473
Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,819
- Hey, come on. Tell me what I've done.
- I understand today's plan.

112
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:14,369
Something's come up, Elizabeth.
I have to go back out again.

113
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,537
Now? Weren't we going to the game?

114
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,038
The Warriors.
I gave the tickets to a patient.

115
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:21,540
You're not gonna see tonight's game?

116
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,213
No choice.

117
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,043
Geoffrey, what is the matter with you?

118
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:28,630
I'm fine. I just have to go to a meeting.

119
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,002
Meeting? What kind of a meeting?

120
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:35,135
Elizabeth, I don't think
I have to justify my every move to you.

121
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:38,056
Geoffrey, this isn't like you.

122
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:41,851
Please, come on. I just want it to be nice...

123
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,931
Elizabeth, what's the matter with you?

124
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:48,148
Nothing.

125
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:25,388
Come in!

126
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:28,226
Hi.

127
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:30,893
How you doing?

128
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:43,154
Is it true that if you think
you're losing your mind, you're not?

129
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:47,991
Well, I hope so.

130
00:17:50,248 --> 00:17:52,369
I know this is gonna sound insane.

131
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,124
What?

132
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:58,960
Geoffrey is not Geoffrey.

133
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:02,496
- How do you know?
- I know.

134
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:06,718
On the outside Geoffrey is still Geoffrey,

135
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:10,130
but on the inside
I can tell there is something different.

136
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:12,091
Something is missing.

137
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,260
- What?
- Emotion, feelings.

138
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,601
He's just not the same person.

139
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:24,190
Really, you know what I mean?
I know it sounds crazy.

140
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:27,816
Yeah. I know what you mean, I think.
Have you eaten?

141
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:30,187
- I'm not hungry.
- Have some celery.

142
00:18:30,323 --> 00:18:32,196
- I'm not...
- Eat, eat, eat.

143
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:37,621
We can eat outside. It's a beautiful night.

144
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:42,168
Take that meat there, will you?
Chop it up.

145
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:45,577
And hand me the ginger,
the stuff that's chopped up there.

146
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:59,051
You wanna know something else?
This is really weird.

147
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,636
I went to see his sister Nora
to talk to her about it.

148
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,347
But I couldn't. I stopped myself.

149
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,309
She changed, too?

150
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,274
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- No.

151
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,605
D'you wanna go see
my friend David Kibner?

152
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:22,191
- The psychiatrist?
- Not like that.

153
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:24,948
Talk to him. He would
put things into perspective.

154
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:28,910
- I'm not crazy.
- No, no, no. I'm serious.

155
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:34,082
He would eliminate whether Geoffrey
was having an affair, or had become gay.

156
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:39,087
Whether he had a social disease,
or had become a Republican.

157
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:43,545
All the things that could have happened
to have made you feel he had changed.

158
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:46,633
D'you know what I mean?
You wanna go see him?

159
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,677
You think I'm nuts.

160
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:54,603
No, I don't.
Can you still do the thing with your eyes?

161
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:59,766
If you're not crazy,
you can do that thing with your eyes.

162
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:10,945
You're not crazy.

163
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,116
This is delicious.

164
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,155
You're a great cook.

165
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:17,530
What time is Geoffrey getting back?

166
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,247
He said not to wait up for him.

167
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:24,662
D'you want some more wine?

168
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,104
- Morning!
- Hello.

169
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:59,483
One, two... Mrs Teng,
this one's got a coffee stain on it.

170
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,537
Here.

171
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:06,447
- That's not coffee.
- That is coffee. I put it there myself.

172
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,707
Maybe not come out.

173
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:14,581
You doctor, right?

174
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:17,467
Me? No. Health Department. Civil servant.

175
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,551
Do you need a doctor?

176
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,803
My wife... sick.

177
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:28,716
- What's wrong with her?
- She wrong.

178
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:33,139
- She's not right?
- That not my wife.

179
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:35,520
You mean, she's...?

180
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:38,023
No, no. Different.

181
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:44,487
That not my wife!

182
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:14,887
How you doin', Harry?

183
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,098
Hey, pooch. How you doin', boy?

184
00:23:00,765 --> 00:23:05,924
Where you been? You've been driving me
crazy. I've been looking all over for you.

185
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:07,603
What's the matter with you?

186
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:10,431
You all right?

187
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:17,109
Talk to me, Elizabeth.

188
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:53,340
I keep seeing these people

189
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:56,183
all recognising each other.

190
00:23:56,312 --> 00:23:58,850
Something was passing between them all.

191
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,021
Some secret.

192
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:06,568
It's a conspiracy. I know it.

193
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,397
There can't be a conspiracy.

194
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:12,651
Matthew, I'm telling you,
something's going on here.

195
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,825
Something that scares me.

196
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,526
I tried to see Geoffrey today,
to talk to him.

197
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:20,279
He's always in his office in the morning.

198
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:03,658
It really was weird.

199
00:25:03,788 --> 00:25:06,492
Geoffrey was meeting
all sorts ofstrange people.

200
00:25:06,623 --> 00:25:08,780
Things were being passed between them.

201
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:11,833
- None were people you knew?
- I didn't know any of them.

202
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,534
Maybe they were patients of Geoffrey's.

203
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:17,590
Oh, no, no, Matthew. I know they weren't.

204
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:20,633
I followed him
from one end oftown to the other,

205
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,137
and everywhere he went he had
these meetings with strange people.

206
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:39,895
I felt so stupid
sneaking around spying on him,

207
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:42,861
but I can't talk to him. What can I do?

208
00:25:46,324 --> 00:25:49,987
OK. Well, Kibner will be able
to explain something.

209
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:52,278
I don't need a psychiatrist.

210
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:54,785
Just forget that he's a psychiatrist.

211
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:58,118
Just think of him as an intelligent man,
which is what he is.

212
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:01,869
It's a book party. He's a celebrity.
He's very famous.

213
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:05,337
And you will like him,
if you forget that he's a psychiatrist.

214
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:08,416
I don't know... I don't know.

215
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:11,338
Matthew, I've lived in this city all my life,

216
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:15,053
but somehow today
I felt everything had changed.

217
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:18,386
People were different.
Notjust Geoffrey, but everybody.

218
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:21,519
Yesterday it all seemed normal.

219
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,149
Today everything seemed the same,
but it wasn't.

220
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:27,312
It was a nightmare.

221
00:26:28,193 --> 00:26:30,233
It really became frightening.

222
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:35,482
It was like the whole city
had changed overnight.

223
00:26:48,837 --> 00:26:52,502
Did I ever tell you the one
about the English Camel Corps? Did l?

224
00:26:53,841 --> 00:26:57,006
They're trapped in the desert,
in the Sahara desert.

225
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:02,597
They've been surrounded by Rommel
for 40 days and they've run out of food.

226
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:07,053
And the captain comes
and makes an announcement to the men.

227
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:08,810
He says,

228
00:27:08,937 --> 00:27:13,729
"Men, I have some good news
and some bad news for you."

229
00:27:13,984 --> 00:27:16,687
- One of the men says...
- Wait. You have told me this.

230
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:23,029
Can I tell it to you again?

231
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,153
Look out!

232
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:26,944
Oh, my God! Lock the door!

233
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,116
- They're coming!
- We should help.

234
00:27:29,245 --> 00:27:32,282
Help! Help! They're coming.
They're coming. Listen!

235
00:27:32,414 --> 00:27:35,037
- He's smashed out of his skull.
- He's terrified.

236
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:38,419
You're next. Please! Please!
You're next. We're in danger!

237
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:40,456
Listen to me... Something terrible!

238
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,792
Please. You're next!
Here they are. They're already here!

239
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:45,420
Help! You're next!

240
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:49,500
- They're coming. They're coming...
- He must have done something.

241
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,050
The policeman'll help.

242
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:26,166
Oh, my God.

243
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:29,291
That poor man.
What was he talking about?

244
00:28:29,423 --> 00:28:32,838
I'll phone a witness report in
from the bookstore.

245
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:37,383
Matthew, thank God you're here!
These people are driving me nuts.

246
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,589
- Are we gonna have dinner?
- No, I can't.

247
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:41,800
- Is there a phone?
- Around the corner.

248
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:45,682
- Elizabeth Driscoll, Jack Bellicec.
- This is the Elizabeth?

249
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:48,136
The book is awful. Kibner's book is awful.

250
00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:50,893
His ideas are garbage. Pure garbage.

251
00:28:51,024 --> 00:28:53,813
How can you say that
about a man like Kibner?

252
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:56,696
Not a man like Kibner.
I'm saying it about Kibner.

253
00:28:56,822 --> 00:29:01,033
He dashes a book off every six months.
Takes me six months to write one line.

254
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:03,946
- Why?
- Cos I pick each word individually.

255
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,661
- What's so hot about that?
- I wasn't even talking to you, was l?

256
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,197
On the corner of Leavenworth and...

257
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,325
- Turk.
- Turk? Turk.

258
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,791
Is that him?

259
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,208
Yes.

260
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,871
Yes!

261
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:24,131
"What's so hot about that?
What's so hot about that?" I don't know...

262
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:28,046
You must have a report on it
cos there was a motorcycle officer there

263
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,507
- and an ambulance on the way.
- They follow me.

264
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:34,226
- They don't understand me.
- You don't have to prove yourself to them.

265
00:29:34,354 --> 00:29:36,893
- That's easy for you to say.
- Of course I saw it.

266
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:40,723
- The man was running down the street.
- It's romantic, sentimental,

267
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,814
- He landed on my car.
- post-industrial nonsense.

268
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:46,436
Just a second. I'm talking to the police.

269
00:29:46,573 --> 00:29:49,940
- No, he was bleeding on the road.
- What seems to be the trouble?

270
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:51,274
Hello? Yeah.

271
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:53,567
Don't ever give your name to cops.

272
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:56,193
Leavenworth and Turk. I'll hold.

273
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,490
But he isn't my husband!

274
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,246
It's someone who looks like him.
He's an impostor!

275
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:05,161
Now, Katherine, he's your husband.
You know him and I know him.

276
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:10,041
I had to wait until today cos he has
a scar on the back of his neck

277
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,667
and when his hair is long
you can't see it.

278
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:16,255
- He went to have a haircut today...
- And the scar was gone.

279
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,300
No! It's still there!

280
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:22,934
Of course it's still there.
What did you expect? He's still Ted.

281
00:30:23,063 --> 00:30:27,273
- Excuse me, can I say one thing?
- Please! He's still your husband Ted.

282
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,392
- I know something...
- Katherine?

283
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,354
- Could I say one thing?
- Katherine!

284
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:32,862
Just a minute.

285
00:30:32,989 --> 00:30:35,313
- Katherine.
- Just give me a minute, will you?

286
00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:37,606
Will you trust me?

287
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:40,908
Will you please trust me? Will you?

288
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:44,285
I work for the county.
This is a public-spirited gesture.

289
00:30:44,414 --> 00:30:47,913
- I will give you my name...
- Kibner wants people to fit the world.

290
00:30:48,043 --> 00:30:50,794
- I wanna report this.
- I want the world to fit people.

291
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,252
- We'll talk about this later.
- Where's Homer? Or Kazantzakis?

292
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:57,003
- Where's Jack London?
- Where's Elizabeth?

293
00:30:57,134 --> 00:31:00,384
- I'm afraid!
- I understand, I know.

294
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:02,718
I understand. Let me have your hand.

295
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:05,515
- Katherine, just trust me.
- Isn't he wonderful?

296
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:07,514
Come on.

297
00:31:07,642 --> 00:31:11,474
There. That's not so bad, is it?
Who's this behind me?

298
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,977
- It's Ted.
- That's right.

299
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:16,064
Hold on. Come on, just hold on.

300
00:31:16,192 --> 00:31:20,059
Hold on. Just relax now.

301
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:23,112
- You gonna be all right? You feel better?
- Yeah. Yes.

302
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,195
- You wanna go home now?
- Yes.

303
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:28,277
- Will you come and see me tomorrow?
- Please... tomorrow.

304
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,080
Tomorrow we'll all talk.
OK? The three of us?

305
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:33,245
OK, but I better take her home.

306
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:35,411
Yes. It's OK.

307
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,581
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.

308
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:40,084
- All right?
- OK.

309
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,212
Thank you.

310
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:49,669
They don't wanna hear
about the accident.

311
00:31:49,804 --> 00:31:51,631
It's a big conspiracy.

312
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:53,970
- What's a conspiracy?
- Everything.

313
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,432
Excuse me.

314
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:04,228
I understand what you're trying to say.

315
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:08,142
My name is Elizabeth Driscoll,
the Public Health Department. Call me.

316
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,318
Katherine! Come on, Katherine.

317
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:15,064
That woman's husband
is not her husband.

318
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:18,783
I saw him with Geoffrey. He's one of them.
She knows about it

319
00:32:18,913 --> 00:32:21,913
- and nobody's helping her.
- No. Somebody's helping her.

320
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,246
I'm glad you heard that. David, Elizabeth.

321
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,534
I've heard it all week. It's popular.

322
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:28,958
- What is?
- I was trying to tell you

323
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:31,923
- that I also know somebody...
- Who's changed.

324
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:34,802
- Yes.
- Can we go outside and talk about it?

325
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:41,767
Listen, there's a lady up top - red hair,
blue dress. She's interested in your work.

326
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:50,474
I've heard the same damn story
this week from six patients.

327
00:32:50,606 --> 00:32:53,180
People are changing,
becoming less human.

328
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:55,358
It's happening all around us.

329
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:57,727
That's not what we're talking about.

330
00:32:57,862 --> 00:33:00,401
This has nothing to do with
the man I live with.

331
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:03,153
It has everything to do with it.
Don't you see?

332
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:08,443
People step in and out of relationships
because they don't want responsibility.

333
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:12,493
That's why marriages are going to hell.
The family unit is shot to hell.

334
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,626
- David, you're not listening to her.
- Stay out of this!

335
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:17,745
You see, that's the point.

336
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,454
I'm listening,
but he doesn't think I am. Why?

337
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:24,292
Because he doesn't expect me
to bother enough, or to care.

338
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:27,262
- Bellicec, for the last time, stop!
- Stop what?!

339
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:30,140
- Stand still, be quiet, and shut up!
- Jack!

340
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:31,640
How did you feel about that?

341
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:33,345
Why in the store? He's a nut.

342
00:33:33,477 --> 00:33:34,675
How did you feel?

343
00:33:35,477 --> 00:33:37,518
You were probably shocked.

344
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:40,138
You wanted to shut your feelings off,

345
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:45,433
maybe make believe it wasn't happening
cos then you don't have to deal with it.

346
00:33:46,947 --> 00:33:49,650
I wanna deal with that woman
in the bookstore.

347
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:51,821
Why?

348
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:54,408
Do you identify with her?

349
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:57,787
Yes.

350
00:33:58,207 --> 00:33:59,617
OK.

351
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,619
Come on.

352
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:06,460
Suppose I were to tell you that Katherine
is trying to escape from a relationship.

353
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:09,459
- He's treating her.
- So why'd he push me against a wall?

354
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,418
- She's upset.
- She looks fine.

355
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:14,256
- She is upset, Jack.
- You look upset to me now.

356
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:17,887
Do me a favour, will ya?
Go home and I'll call you later.

357
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,587
- Go home and leave us alone for a bit.
- Go home?

358
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,766
- OK?
- OK. OK.

359
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,722
Thank you.

360
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,848
You're jumping to a bizarre conclusion.

361
00:34:30,984 --> 00:34:34,400
That this man you live with
has been replaced by somebody else.

362
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:37,612
Isn't it more likely
you want to believe he's changed

363
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:41,488
because you're really looking
for an excuse to get out?

364
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:53,871
I don't know.

365
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:56,080
Will you think about it, please,

366
00:34:56,214 --> 00:34:58,253
before you make a move?

367
00:34:58,383 --> 00:35:02,082
Before you jump and
destroy something you have. Will you?

368
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,218
Please?

369
00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:11,806
Yeah.

370
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,979
Thank you.

371
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:23,277
I just gave her
a psychological Band-Aid, Matthew.

372
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:25,396
I should talk to her some more.

373
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:28,568
You could bring her by my office
tomorrow around four.

374
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:30,610
What's the matter with her?

375
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:34,492
It's like there's some kind of
hallucinatory flu going around.

376
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:38,371
People get over it in a day or two.
All I can do is treat the symptoms.

377
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,494
She's gonna be OK?

378
00:35:40,629 --> 00:35:42,916
A good night's sleep wouldn't hurt.

379
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:45,334
- Is it contagious?
- Oh, Matthew!

380
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:50,257
- Take her home to her boyfriend.
- That wasn't what I was thinking.

381
00:35:50,387 --> 00:35:53,802
I was just wondering
if the Health Department should look at it.

382
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,971
Who knows? I don't know.

383
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:58,681
I wish I did.

384
00:35:59,643 --> 00:36:01,139
OK.

385
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:04,603
Take her home, Matthew.

386
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:30,662
Ah, Jack. How was the book party?

387
00:36:32,632 --> 00:36:34,669
Is that Kibner's new book?

388
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:40,382
Didn't get to read your poetry?

389
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:43,761
I'm sorry, Jack.

390
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,140
Good evening. Bellicec Baths.

391
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:52,397
Yes, we recommend the 1 5-minute soak
in Calistoga volcanic ash,

392
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:55,808
that's followed by
an Aqua-Surge whirlpool dip.

393
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,620
Hey, can you help me outta here?

394
00:37:17,086 --> 00:37:18,663
Bellicec!

395
00:37:18,795 --> 00:37:20,871
I'm talking to you. Give me a hand.

396
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:23,046
Help me outta this thing.

397
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:26,966
Stan...

398
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:29,087
Every week we go through this.

399
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:33,171
- Why can't you be more cooperative?
- Get me a towel.

400
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:35,929
You are really gonna get hurt
one of these days.

401
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:38,183
Give me another towel, would you?

402
00:37:38,312 --> 00:37:40,140
Come on.

403
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:55,203
Nancy, shut the music off.

404
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,403
It's for the plants, Stan.

405
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:00,741
Screw the plants. I hate the music.

406
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,957
It's wonderful for my plants.
They just love it.

407
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:08,123
Plants have feelings, you know,
just like people.

408
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:12,632
It's fascinating. This type of music
stimulates the growth of the plants.

409
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:14,966
They've done tons of experiments on it.

410
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:17,929
- Come on, Nancy. Turn the music off.
- Relax.

411
00:38:18,056 --> 00:38:20,628
You're not gonna enjoy this if you don't.

412
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:54,411
Oh! Mr Gianni, what are you doing here?

413
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:56,870
This is must reading, Mrs Bellicec.

414
00:38:57,006 --> 00:38:59,295
Worlds ln Collision by Velikovsky.

415
00:38:59,425 --> 00:39:02,840
Oh, yes. I've read that many times.
Have you read Star Maker

416
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:06,552
by Olaf Stapledon?
That's must reading, too.

417
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:12,100
- Well, it's awfully late, Mr Gianni.
- You're so smart.

418
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:15,429
Oh, Mr Gianni,
you've been sitting in that mud too long.

419
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,935
It is possible to overdo it, you know.

420
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,522
Oh, by the way, thank you for that plant
you gave me last time.

421
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:55,636
I'll walk you inside.

422
00:39:56,765 --> 00:39:58,804
You don't have to.

423
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:08,603
Geoffrey?

424
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:14,151
That was sweet of him.

425
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,752
You all right?

426
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:37,712
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

427
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:46,964
Thank you, Matthew.
You've really made me feel better.

428
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,508
And I'm gonna think about
what Kibner said.

429
00:40:49,643 --> 00:40:50,640
OK.

430
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:52,680
Thanks for helping. Goodnight.

431
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:54,852
See you.

432
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:03,318
Jack?

433
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,779
Honey, where are ya?

434
00:41:06,993 --> 00:41:11,037
I don't wanna disturb you if you're
thinking, but I could do with some food.

435
00:41:11,163 --> 00:41:13,832
I haven't eaten all day. Oh...

436
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:19,165
Oh, Jack, you're gonna suffocate.

437
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,091
My nose...

438
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,260
Let me out! Let me out!

439
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,131
My nose is bleeding.

440
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:57,821
Who is it?

441
00:41:58,788 --> 00:42:00,827
Who is it?

442
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,038
It's Matthew.

443
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:08,576
- Come on in.
- What happened?

444
00:42:08,713 --> 00:42:10,337
Back here.

445
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:13,168
- Matthew, I called you here as a friend.
- Oh, Jack...

446
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:18,092
Do you report things like contagious
disease or a body in a place of business?

447
00:42:18,222 --> 00:42:20,296
- Let him look at it.
- You found a body?

448
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,134
- No, not necessarily.
- I thought it was Jack.

449
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:25,802
Is that him?

450
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:27,974
Yeah, under there.

451
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:33,221
- What kind of joke is this?
- It's no joke.

452
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:35,899
What is it?

453
00:42:44,243 --> 00:42:47,741
- What the hell is it?!
- Just keep calm, Nancy.

454
00:42:49,248 --> 00:42:51,287
Is it contagious?

455
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,788
- Did any of your customers see this?
- No.

456
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:55,292
It'd ruin us.

457
00:42:55,418 --> 00:42:57,542
- I'm calling the police.
- Don't do that.

458
00:42:57,671 --> 00:42:59,047
- Why?
- Nancy, don't.

459
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:02,129
Because I think Jack is right.

460
00:43:02,844 --> 00:43:05,048
It's not immature exactly.

461
00:43:05,178 --> 00:43:06,920
He's got an adult face.

462
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:10,967
- It's a monster. It's got hair all over it.
- It's vague.

463
00:43:11,308 --> 00:43:13,347
Nose, lips, hair.

464
00:43:13,475 --> 00:43:17,224
Hands, everything,
but no detail, no character. It's unformed.

465
00:43:17,354 --> 00:43:20,724
Jack, don't touch it.
You don't know where it's been.

466
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,106
No respiration.

467
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:26,359
It's got no fingerprints.

468
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,818
No fingerprints?

469
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,739
Like a foetus.

470
00:43:32,868 --> 00:43:34,908
You just said it was an adult.

471
00:43:35,036 --> 00:43:37,740
I said it was an adult because it was tall.

472
00:43:37,872 --> 00:43:41,621
- How tall are you, Jack?
- Six foot four.

473
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:44,953
- How much do you weigh?
- 170.

474
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:47,459
- Why?
- Oh, no.

475
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:50,543
No, Matthew.

476
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,586
Oh, Jack!

477
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,341
- Who are you calling?
- Elizabeth.

478
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:58,510
Why?

479
00:43:58,682 --> 00:44:00,890
Why are you calling Elizabeth?

480
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:03,472
- Matthew...
- Why?

481
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:15,984
Hello?

482
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:20,028
Elizabeth? Can you hear me?
It's Matthew, Elizabeth. Hello?

483
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:21,903
What's the matter?

484
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:24,442
Elizabeth, can you hear me?

485
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,405
Who is this?

486
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,829
Hello?

487
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:53,636
- Where are you going?
- A friend of mine is in trouble.

488
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:56,262
- What are we to do?
- Phone David Kibner.

489
00:44:56,398 --> 00:45:00,098
Ask him to meet me here right away.
There's his number.

490
00:45:00,235 --> 00:45:02,274
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired.

491
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:05,064
Stand up.

492
00:45:05,197 --> 00:45:08,863
- Stand up! Now walk around!
- Honey, I'm dry! I'm very dry.

493
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:11,744
I'll get you a drink. Just don't fall asleep.

494
00:45:21,378 --> 00:45:23,003
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks, sweetie.

495
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:25,169
Dr Kibner will be here soon.

496
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:31,590
I'm gonna lie down and think, honey.

497
00:45:32,054 --> 00:45:34,094
I'm just gonna think.

498
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:25,465
Jack, wake up! lts eyes!

499
00:46:25,601 --> 00:46:28,436
Oh, Jack. It opened its eyes.

500
00:46:40,363 --> 00:46:41,358
See?

501
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:45,571
Hon?

502
00:50:25,141 --> 00:50:26,551
Wake up.

503
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:28,094
Wake up!

504
00:52:35,169 --> 00:52:38,619
I can't find anything in here
that looks like a body.

505
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,582
- No body?
- What!

506
00:52:40,716 --> 00:52:43,550
- Did you check the last...
- I looked everywhere.

507
00:52:43,676 --> 00:52:45,052
Hey! Did you... Hey!

508
00:52:45,177 --> 00:52:48,961
- Did you check the last booth on the left?
- There's no body there.

509
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:51,136
It's got to be in here!

510
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:57,220
- Did it have a pulse, a heartbeat?
- It opened its eyes.

511
00:52:57,355 --> 00:53:00,806
- You actually saw that?
- I saw its nose bleed.

512
00:53:01,192 --> 00:53:04,109
It had white hair, that touched my hand.

513
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:06,692
There's something in here.

514
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:12,858
Nancy lost an old guy in here once.
He had a heart attack and sank.

515
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:19,199
Face it, Bellicec.

516
00:53:19,331 --> 00:53:22,249
You've got some friends
who enjoy practical jokes.

517
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:24,665
I don't have any friends, Dr Kibner.

518
00:53:25,755 --> 00:53:27,794
Then some enemies.

519
00:53:27,922 --> 00:53:29,204
Look.

520
00:53:33,093 --> 00:53:35,133
Who opened this up?

521
00:53:59,993 --> 00:54:02,447
Wait a second, wait a second.
Who is it?

522
00:54:05,538 --> 00:54:08,159
- Matthew, the body's gone.
- Somebody's took it.

523
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,495
- No. Did you see it?
- There was nothing here to see.

524
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:14,457
Who are you waking up now, Matthew?

525
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:17,872
Police? I would like to report a body.

526
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:22,377
Take her to my place fast.

527
00:54:22,512 --> 00:54:25,381
Don't let anybody in
until we get back there.

528
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:58,031
Lieutenant, these fellas reported the body.

529
00:54:58,168 --> 00:55:01,452
- You both saw it?
- No, I'm the only one. Matthew Bennell.

530
00:55:01,588 --> 00:55:05,713
- Mr Bennell, show me where you saw it.
- It's right up here.

531
00:55:05,966 --> 00:55:08,004
Where's Elizabeth?

532
00:55:22,189 --> 00:55:23,598
- Where?
- There.

533
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,888
- It's Elizabeth's double.
- Where?

534
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,982
Lots of leaves and a pot.

535
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:31,525
It was there, David.
I swear to God it was there!

536
00:55:31,654 --> 00:55:34,489
Officer, there was a duplicate
of Elizabeth Driscoll,

537
00:55:34,615 --> 00:55:36,856
- and it's been taken.
- The missing woman?

538
00:55:36,992 --> 00:55:38,866
- She's not missing.
- Where is she?

539
00:55:38,994 --> 00:55:41,401
- She's at Matthew's.
- Don't tell him that!

540
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:44,111
- Then there is no missing body.
- That's right.

541
00:55:44,248 --> 00:55:46,868
- There is and he's taken it!
- No, he took Elizabeth.

542
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,744
- You took Elizabeth away?
- Yes!

543
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:51,914
- You broke in here.
- I had to because she was not safe here.

544
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:53,540
So you took her out of here.

545
00:55:53,672 --> 00:55:57,670
No! I took her from there.
Her other body was in here...

546
00:55:57,802 --> 00:56:00,470
Please stop.
Matthew, that's enough! Please stop!

547
00:56:00,595 --> 00:56:03,714
- Lieutenant, I'm Dr David Kibner.
- Ah, the psychiatrist.

548
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:05,509
My wife reads your books.

549
00:56:05,642 --> 00:56:08,179
- I'm glad. It sounds complicated,...
- David...

550
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:12,260
..but my friend has had some difficult
emotional experiences recently.

551
00:56:12,398 --> 00:56:16,477
But I think this is something
we can work out amongst ourselves.

552
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:20,311
- All right, I'll leave this part of it with you.
- I appreciate it.

553
00:56:20,446 --> 00:56:23,649
You can't accomplish anything here.
We gotta get outside.

554
00:56:25,534 --> 00:56:30,659
I think you might wanna consider filing
an unlawful entry against Mr Bennell.

555
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:33,114
I know what you're saying, but outside...

556
00:56:33,249 --> 00:56:37,578
No, I'll take Dr Kibner's word
that Elizabeth is all right.

557
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,750
- Fine, then let's go.
- OK.

558
00:56:44,884 --> 00:56:46,923
Will Elizabeth be coming home?

559
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:49,467
No.

560
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:53,344
I have to pick up some of her clothes.

561
00:56:56,853 --> 00:56:57,599
All right.

562
00:57:26,628 --> 00:57:29,664
All right, let's back up
and go through it once more,

563
00:57:29,797 --> 00:57:32,086
step by step.

564
00:57:33,968 --> 00:57:37,005
You all thought you saw a body
at the baths.

565
00:57:37,137 --> 00:57:40,423
You thought it was dead.
You didn't know what it was.

566
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:45,685
You touched it. All of you touched it.

567
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:53,267
- Nancy, you saw it open its eyes.
- It looked right at me.

568
00:57:55,237 --> 00:57:59,068
- And, Bellicec, you saw its eyes open.
- No, I saw its nose bleed.

569
00:57:59,198 --> 00:58:02,532
If you saw its nose bleed,
and Nancy saw its eyes open,

570
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,486
he must have been alive.

571
00:58:06,997 --> 00:58:10,660
No, David. You're looking at it
as if it was human. It was not human.

572
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:15,498
- Matthew, what else would it be?
- It was something, but not human.

573
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:17,871
- It had white hair on it.
- It was growing.

574
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:19,583
The one at Jack's was...

575
00:58:19,715 --> 00:58:23,381
It was like Jack, but not as developed
as the one at Elizabeth's place.

576
00:58:23,511 --> 00:58:25,338
It had tendrils on it.

577
00:58:25,471 --> 00:58:27,547
The one at her place was duplicating her.

578
00:58:27,681 --> 00:58:29,720
If Matthew hadn't taken me away,

579
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:33,431
the same thing that's happened
to Geoffrey would have happened to me.

580
00:58:33,561 --> 00:58:38,055
Elizabeth, would you please tell me, in
your opinion, exactly what is happening?

581
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,309
People are being duplicated.

582
00:58:44,445 --> 00:58:47,815
And once it's happened to you,
you're part of this thing.

583
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,944
It almost happened to me!

584
00:58:52,452 --> 00:58:53,946
Look,

585
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:59,156
the reason you don't believe Elizabeth
is because the other body disappeared.

586
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:02,327
It disappeared because Geoffrey took it.

587
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,128
Well, then what happened
to my other body, then?

588
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:08,006
Oh, people,
will you please listen to yourselves?

589
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:10,290
Will you listen to what you are saying?

590
00:59:10,427 --> 00:59:15,336
I can deal with a body being moved and
even with a body getting up and leaving,

591
00:59:15,472 --> 00:59:19,255
but when you start talking about
his other body, being duplicated...

592
00:59:19,392 --> 00:59:21,100
Listen to how that sounds.

593
00:59:21,227 --> 00:59:24,679
We know how insane this sounds!
But what do you think we're doing?

594
00:59:24,814 --> 00:59:26,972
Do you think we're making it up?

595
00:59:27,107 --> 00:59:31,400
Do you believe that my body looked like
me and that her body looked like her?

596
00:59:31,528 --> 00:59:33,188
D'you think we're crazy?

597
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:38,316
You are trying to make us believe
that we are seeing things. Why?

598
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:40,822
All I'm trying to do is help.

599
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:45,164
You call me in the middle of the night and
ask me to help. That's all I'm trying to do.

600
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,282
Well, I'm sorry if we woke you up!

601
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,749
If we inconvenienced you,
I guess we owe you an apology.

602
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:54,247
I mean, I mean...
I guess that's a rotten thing to do!

603
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,088
You've upset my wife, too.

604
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:07,390
David, I don't know what it is
or where it comes from,

605
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:09,557
but I saw it and I'm gonna fight it.

606
01:00:09,687 --> 01:00:12,971
Matthew, my friend,... I believe you.

607
01:00:14,398 --> 01:00:16,935
I've known you too long
not to believe you.

608
01:00:17,067 --> 01:00:19,106
What do you wanna do?

609
01:00:19,236 --> 01:00:23,565
Well, if I could get official support,
I'd institute the emergency procedures

610
01:00:23,698 --> 01:00:26,485
that we use for cholera
or legionnaires' disease.

611
01:00:26,617 --> 01:00:30,449
- What do you want me to do?
- I can handle the Health Department.

612
01:00:30,579 --> 01:00:34,076
But if panic breaks out,
we'll need the police and the Guard,

613
01:00:34,206 --> 01:00:36,365
and that means the Mayor and...

614
01:00:37,377 --> 01:00:39,950
The Mayor's a patient of yours, isn't he?

615
01:00:40,712 --> 01:00:42,752
How did you know that?

616
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:45,713
What do you want me to do?

617
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:48,297
Would you ask him
to accept my telephone call?

618
01:00:48,427 --> 01:00:50,800
I'll call him in a hour. I'll be at my office.

619
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,503
If you have any other ideas, get in touch.

620
01:00:55,976 --> 01:00:58,014
Call me.

621
01:00:59,312 --> 01:01:01,351
Thank you.

622
01:01:26,752 --> 01:01:28,791
The sooner the better.

623
01:01:31,464 --> 01:01:33,255
This smells lovely.

624
01:01:33,382 --> 01:01:36,586
- I want you to listen to me.
- I am listening to you, Nancy.

625
01:01:36,718 --> 01:01:40,420
I am not seeing things.
I know I saw what I saw

626
01:01:40,556 --> 01:01:44,423
and I know it was turning into you, Jack.
Now, that body we found...

627
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,883
That flower. Where did you get that?

628
01:01:47,018 --> 01:01:50,104
- In the vase with the others.
- Just stuck in there?

629
01:01:50,231 --> 01:01:53,598
- Yeah. Why?
- Geoffrey gave me one last night.

630
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:54,730
So what?

631
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,896
A customer, Mr Gianni,
brought one of those to the baths.

632
01:01:58,029 --> 01:01:58,894
So what?

633
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,030
- Put it down, Jack.
- It's a pod with a flower on it.

634
01:02:02,158 --> 01:02:05,906
- I could not find that flower in any book.
- Jack, put it down.

635
01:02:06,037 --> 01:02:09,700
- It's a pink flower, honey.
- It could be toxic.

636
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:13,992
I have seen these flowers all over.
They grow like parasites on other plants.

637
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:16,369
- Where are they coming from?
- Outer space.

638
01:02:16,503 --> 01:02:18,875
- They're not from outer space.
- Why not?

639
01:02:19,006 --> 01:02:20,498
- They're not.
- Why?!

640
01:02:20,631 --> 01:02:22,874
What are you talking about?
A space flower?

641
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:27,715
Why not a space flower?
Why do we always expect metal ships?

642
01:02:27,846 --> 01:02:30,088
I've never expected metal ships.

643
01:02:30,223 --> 01:02:32,796
There must be other ways
they get in our systems.

644
01:02:32,934 --> 01:02:36,304
Right. They could be getting into us
through touch or fragrance.

645
01:02:36,438 --> 01:02:40,020
We would never even notice it,
not from the impurities we have.

646
01:02:40,149 --> 01:02:42,853
I mean, we eat junk and we breathe junk.

647
01:02:42,985 --> 01:02:47,812
I don't know where they're coming from,
but I feel as though I've been poisoned.

648
01:02:47,946 --> 01:02:51,149
We've gotta take those flowers in
and have them analysed.

649
01:02:51,282 --> 01:02:54,238
- There's something here.
- They could get into us

650
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:58,413
and screw up our genes like DNA,
recombine us, change us.

651
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:00,034
Oh, of course!

652
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:03,250
This is the same way
those rockets landed years ago,

653
01:03:03,377 --> 01:03:07,671
so those spacemen could mate with
monkeys and create the human race.

654
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:10,004
It's happening now!

655
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,469
- Who do you wish to speak to?
- David Kibner.

656
01:03:23,603 --> 01:03:26,388
He's not in right now.
He'll be back this afternoon.

657
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:31,350
Could you leave a message for him?
Matthew Bennell. B-E-N-N-E-L-L.

658
01:03:31,485 --> 01:03:35,317
- And your number, please?
- No, he's got my number. Thank you.

659
01:03:42,161 --> 01:03:44,830
James Grala, Deputy City Attorney.
Can I help you?

660
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:46,579
My name is Matthew Bennell.

661
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:50,323
B-E-N-N-E-L-L.
I'm a deputy public health inspector.

662
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:53,579
- Is this another call about impostors?
- Yes.

663
01:03:53,711 --> 01:03:55,919
- We're the first agency you called?
- Yes.

664
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:59,002
Good. Listen, Mr Bennell,
we don't wanna create a panic.

665
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:00,925
No-one here knows.

666
01:04:01,052 --> 01:04:03,541
I'd like you to stay by yourphone
for a while.

667
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:06,763
I'll have somebody call you back
and take down all you know.

668
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,717
All right, thank you.

669
01:04:10,892 --> 01:04:14,013
This is a busy lab, Elizabeth.
We don't test flowers.

670
01:04:14,145 --> 01:04:17,479
- They go to the Depart of Agriculture.
- I know where they go!

671
01:04:17,648 --> 01:04:21,397
I think this is our problem.
I think it is affecting people.

672
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:23,520
How?

673
01:04:25,781 --> 01:04:29,231
Look, Allen, I have already said
that I'll do all the testing.

674
01:04:29,368 --> 01:04:31,740
You don't have to lift a finger. Can l?

675
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:36,873
You've been consistently late, Elizabeth,
and you're behind in your work,

676
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,039
so I'll do the tests for you.

677
01:04:40,128 --> 01:04:41,870
Thank you.

678
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:45,086
- It'll take 48 hours.
- Allen, 24.

679
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:51,049
I can't understand why you've become
so emotional about a little flower.

680
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,178
Hello.

681
01:04:56,308 --> 01:04:57,506
- Mr Bennell?
- Yes.

682
01:04:57,642 --> 01:04:59,635
- From the Health Department?
- Yes.

683
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:02,853
- It's Ted Jessop, the Mayor's assistant.
- Yes.

684
01:05:02,981 --> 01:05:05,897
- You've come across something strange?
- Yes.

685
01:05:06,025 --> 01:05:08,597
I'd like to suggest
we meet in Union Square.

686
01:05:08,735 --> 01:05:11,605
- We can't talk over the phone.
- Right away.

687
01:05:13,865 --> 01:05:16,569
So you'll meet me here again tomorrow,
Mr Bennell?

688
01:05:16,701 --> 01:05:17,566
Yeah.

689
01:05:17,701 --> 01:05:19,907
Don't say a word to anyone. Keep it quiet.

690
01:05:20,037 --> 01:05:22,076
Whatever you say.

691
01:05:27,919 --> 01:05:31,584
- Please deposit 15 cents.
- Operator, I put in a quarter...

692
01:05:34,257 --> 01:05:37,341
This is Judy Hinkell,
the Mayor's special assistant.

693
01:05:37,468 --> 01:05:39,756
Yes. My name is Matthew Bennell.

694
01:05:39,886 --> 01:05:41,761
The Mayor's in conference,

695
01:05:41,889 --> 01:05:45,553
but Dr Kibner called him personally
to express his concern.

696
01:05:45,683 --> 01:05:47,308
And, Mr Bennell,

697
01:05:47,436 --> 01:05:51,979
we're asking for your discretion
because this thing might be abating.

698
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:55,893
Hello?

699
01:05:56,025 --> 01:05:57,603
- Matthew Bennell?
- Yes.

700
01:05:57,736 --> 01:06:00,820
I'm Michaels,
from the Federal Preparedness Agency.

701
01:06:00,947 --> 01:06:04,398
These reports ofstrange,
unexplained, diseased bodies.

702
01:06:04,534 --> 01:06:07,450
My understanding is
you haven't analysed anything

703
01:06:07,577 --> 01:06:10,032
- and you have no tissue samples.
- No, I'm...

704
01:06:10,163 --> 01:06:14,456
Mr Bennell, it seems you'rejust winging
your conclusions. Keep an open mind.

705
01:06:14,584 --> 01:06:15,995
I had no intention...

706
01:06:16,126 --> 01:06:18,795
Don't mention to anyone
about duplicate bodies.

707
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,420
- I was gonna treat it...
- Excuse me, my otherphone is ringing.

708
01:06:24,717 --> 01:06:27,717
- Yes?
- This is serious business, Mr Bennell.

709
01:06:27,844 --> 01:06:31,212
- Is thisjust a case ofparanoia?
- No, no, no.

710
01:06:31,348 --> 01:06:34,930
Know what mass hysteria looks like,
Mr Bennell?

711
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:38,474
- We don't want to create a panic.
- We have a primary authority.

712
01:06:38,603 --> 01:06:39,934
Be cautious.

713
01:06:40,065 --> 01:06:42,020
You sound distressed.

714
01:06:42,149 --> 01:06:46,645
- I think the horizon looks bright.
- People are returning to normal.

715
01:06:46,779 --> 01:06:48,854
No, no. She all right.

716
01:06:48,988 --> 01:06:52,190
She better now. Much better now.

717
01:06:56,537 --> 01:06:59,026
- Did your husband ask you to come?
- No, no.

718
01:06:59,163 --> 01:07:02,698
I want everybody to see
that I'm back to myself again.

719
01:07:03,668 --> 01:07:04,996
No, wait. Please.

720
01:07:05,627 --> 01:07:07,750
I'll see you soon, I hope.

721
01:07:47,037 --> 01:07:49,575
Matthew, I'm not getting a thing here.

722
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:54,084
Where is the...
I'm not getting any news here.

723
01:07:54,212 --> 01:07:56,962
Isn't there a 24-hour news?

724
01:07:58,423 --> 01:08:01,210
I would think you'd have
a good reception on the hill.

725
01:08:01,342 --> 01:08:05,340
There's a repair truck out here.
Could that be to do with it?

726
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:10,231
She just needs something to help her
sleep. Tomorrow she'll be good as new.

727
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:14,902
I would suggest you get some sleep, too.
You've done everything you possibly can.

728
01:09:18,533 --> 01:09:21,071
Can I give the Bellicecs a ride?

729
01:09:21,786 --> 01:09:23,612
No, I'm not going back there.

730
01:09:23,746 --> 01:09:26,616
- We'll just get a motel.
- You can stay here.

731
01:09:28,501 --> 01:09:29,449
Thank you.

732
01:09:30,669 --> 01:09:32,459
Come on.

733
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:36,037
I appreciate everything you've done,
David. Thank you.

734
01:09:37,842 --> 01:09:41,258
- Get some sleep.
- Sure. See you.

735
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:43,978
Matthew. Matthew.

736
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:55,358
Matthew, they're growing.
They're everywhere!

737
01:15:01,829 --> 01:15:02,993
Wake the others!

738
01:15:11,838 --> 01:15:14,672
Elizabeth, wake up!
They're growing out of these pods.

739
01:15:16,008 --> 01:15:19,839
- I'll get the police.
- Elizabeth, wake up.

740
01:15:19,971 --> 01:15:22,341
They get you when you sleep. Sit up!

741
01:15:22,471 --> 01:15:25,258
Elizabeth! Elizabeth, would you wake up?

742
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:26,589
Hello. Police.

743
01:15:26,726 --> 01:15:30,059
Officer, I would like to report
four bodies in my backyard.

744
01:15:30,188 --> 01:15:31,182
You OK?

745
01:15:31,313 --> 01:15:33,851
- Wait there, Mr Bennell.
- How do you know my name?

746
01:15:33,984 --> 01:15:35,357
Hang up, Matthew.

747
01:15:35,483 --> 01:15:37,523
- I didn't tell you my name!
- Hang up.

748
01:15:37,652 --> 01:15:41,316
- I didn't tell them my name!
- They're all a part of it.

749
01:15:43,115 --> 01:15:45,191
They're all pods, all of them.

750
01:15:47,662 --> 01:15:50,032
- Who are you calling?
- Washington.

751
01:15:50,163 --> 01:15:52,239
The CIA? The FBl? They're pods already.

752
01:15:52,374 --> 01:15:56,287
I've got a friend in the Justice Department.
I can dial direct.

753
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:59,418
- What are you gonna tell him?
- Oh, my God!

754
01:15:59,921 --> 01:16:01,961
They grow out of those pods!

755
01:16:02,089 --> 01:16:03,881
They cut our power.

756
01:16:16,101 --> 01:16:19,019
Matthew, they're barricading the street.

757
01:16:19,146 --> 01:16:20,308
No!

758
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:34,074
- What number are you calling from?
- Operator? I was dialling direct.

759
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,241
I'll try the number, Mr Bennell.

760
01:16:42,626 --> 01:16:46,538
- They're coming up here.
- Hang up, Matthew.

761
01:16:47,754 --> 01:16:49,793
Matthew, do you have a gun?

762
01:16:50,465 --> 01:16:51,460
No.

763
01:16:51,591 --> 01:16:54,756
- What are we gonna do?
- Out the back door.

764
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:58,050
Hurry up! Jack!

765
01:17:03,934 --> 01:17:08,346
That way. Under the stairs.
Go on. I'll catch up with you.

766
01:17:53,186 --> 01:17:55,392
Go on, keep on running! Don't stop!

767
01:17:58,190 --> 01:17:59,768
Go on!

768
01:18:17,831 --> 01:18:19,870
Quickly. Follow me.

769
01:20:19,686 --> 01:20:21,727
We're being cornered!

770
01:20:30,446 --> 01:20:31,940
Jesus!

771
01:20:36,867 --> 01:20:38,244
Get down!

772
01:20:40,663 --> 01:20:43,866
Matthew, keep them here
and I'll come back with help.

773
01:20:43,999 --> 01:20:45,031
Jack.

774
01:20:48,502 --> 01:20:50,958
- Jack!
- No, Nancy.

775
01:20:51,173 --> 01:20:54,588
- No, Jack! Jack!
- Get down.

776
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,592
Here I am, you pod bastard!

777
01:20:59,595 --> 01:21:00,591
Hey, pods!

778
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:02,715
Come and get me, you scum!

779
01:21:25,076 --> 01:21:27,282
Wharf area is secure. Ten-four.

780
01:21:31,415 --> 01:21:34,913
Suspects escaping. Suspects escaping.

781
01:23:07,998 --> 01:23:10,157
Oh, yeah, showtime!

782
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:14,075
Yes, sir, you're walking the right way.
We got nude girls...

783
01:23:16,088 --> 01:23:18,294
It's all going on right here.

784
01:23:18,424 --> 01:23:21,875
It's all live, it's all naked, sir.
Guaranteed action here.

785
01:23:22,011 --> 01:23:24,547
Guaranteed to make you
feel like a new man.

786
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,886
Come on back here! Come on back here!

787
01:23:27,016 --> 01:23:29,422
D'you hear me? Come on back here!
This is it.

788
01:23:29,559 --> 01:23:32,050
We got male and female love back here...

789
01:23:45,906 --> 01:23:47,945
- Where to?
- The airport.

790
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:55,574
Pacific and Hyde. Pacific and Hyde.

791
01:23:56,791 --> 01:23:59,744
6-10 proceeding south to airport,

792
01:23:59,876 --> 01:24:03,245
carrying two passengers, type H.

793
01:24:03,379 --> 01:24:06,794
- Repeat. Type H.
- 6-10, confirmed.

794
01:24:06,924 --> 01:24:08,252
Some night, eh?

795
01:24:08,383 --> 01:24:09,961
- Take 280 south on ramp.
- Yeah.

796
01:24:11,052 --> 01:24:14,717
Type H unit established
in Financial and South ofMarket.

797
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:16,805
Repeat. Financial and South ofMarket.

798
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:45,497
Lombard on the Golden Gate.

799
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:47,201
Where are you heading?

800
01:24:47,959 --> 01:24:49,998
I said. The airport.

801
01:24:50,128 --> 01:24:51,706
No. I mean which airline.

802
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:55,123
- Market and 14th. Market and 14th.
- United.

803
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,297
You got business outta town?

804
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:03,221
No, we're not leaving. We're meeting
someone coming in from Boston.

805
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:06,383
All fares at North Beach, regroup.

806
01:25:06,894 --> 01:25:10,807
Divisadero and Haight. Divisadero
and Haight. Divisadero and Haight.

807
01:25:10,938 --> 01:25:12,975
What is it?

808
01:25:13,148 --> 01:25:14,975
What's going on?

809
01:25:15,108 --> 01:25:17,230
Oh, nothing.

810
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:34,035
Both of 'em.

811
01:26:11,364 --> 01:26:14,566
- Harry, pooch, wake up!
- Look, there's a pod.

812
01:29:04,931 --> 01:29:09,806
All those with families
in Berkeley, Oakland and Elizabeth.

813
01:29:13,063 --> 01:29:15,222
Unit Seven, special assistance.

814
01:29:15,357 --> 01:29:18,358
Could we have you
over by the Health Department?

815
01:29:18,901 --> 01:29:22,732
Red city, please.
All with red city families.

816
01:29:22,862 --> 01:29:26,029
Look at them!
Right out in the open.

817
01:29:26,156 --> 01:29:28,612
That's how they do it.

818
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:32,361
That's how they spread it.
All those people are changed.

819
01:29:40,169 --> 01:29:42,291
Unit Seven, special assistance.

820
01:29:43,422 --> 01:29:46,920
Could we have you over
by the Health Department immediately?

821
01:29:51,137 --> 01:29:53,508
Matthew, we'll never be able to stop them!

822
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:55,549
Yes, we will.

823
01:29:55,683 --> 01:29:58,388
We can't!
Look it, they control the whole city.

824
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:00,556
We'll find a way somehow.

825
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:03,894
Oh, Matthew, I can't go on!

826
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:08,275
I wanna go to sleep.
I can't stay awake any more.

827
01:30:09,778 --> 01:30:11,818
You have to.

828
01:30:13,907 --> 01:30:15,946
You have to stay awake.

829
01:30:27,585 --> 01:30:31,830
Would somebody in transportation
report to the Grove Street terminal?

830
01:30:34,466 --> 01:30:38,463
Yup. Boccardo's pills.
He eats these like candy... or he used to.

831
01:30:38,594 --> 01:30:40,173
Take some.

832
01:30:40,305 --> 01:30:42,796
- What are they?
- Speed. It'll keep us awake.

833
01:30:42,932 --> 01:30:46,266
- How many are you supposed to take?
- It says "Take one".

834
01:30:46,394 --> 01:30:48,431
Take five.

835
01:30:58,987 --> 01:31:01,027
They know we're here.

836
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:11,330
Jack, my God!

837
01:31:11,456 --> 01:31:12,997
No.

838
01:31:14,293 --> 01:31:18,539
Would have been a lot easier
if we'd just gone to sleep last night.

839
01:31:18,671 --> 01:31:19,749
David, no!

840
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,999
- Oh, my God! No! No! Matthew!
- Don't touch her!

841
01:31:23,133 --> 01:31:26,003
David, don't let them touch her!
Don't let them touch her!

842
01:31:26,135 --> 01:31:27,713
Don't let them touch her.

843
01:31:27,846 --> 01:31:30,338
- What are you gonna do?
- We'll leave the city!

844
01:31:30,473 --> 01:31:32,880
- Please, Geoffrey.
- David, let us go.

845
01:31:33,017 --> 01:31:36,136
- Let us leave the city!
- You don't have to leave the city.

846
01:31:36,268 --> 01:31:39,022
Nothing changes.
You can have the same life.

847
01:31:39,147 --> 01:31:40,890
But what happens to us?

848
01:31:41,524 --> 01:31:44,893
You'll be born again
into an untroubled world,

849
01:31:45,028 --> 01:31:47,600
free of anxiety, fear,...

850
01:31:47,738 --> 01:31:49,611
- Wait.
- ..hate.

851
01:31:49,739 --> 01:31:52,990
- David, you're killing us.
- That's not true. David's right.

852
01:31:53,118 --> 01:31:58,278
Your minds and memories'll be totally
absorbed. Everything remains intact.

853
01:31:58,414 --> 01:32:02,031
You've never agreed with him in your life
before! What are you talking about?

854
01:32:02,168 --> 01:32:04,206
What are you...

855
01:32:15,387 --> 01:32:18,222
David, you're killing me.

856
01:32:39,157 --> 01:32:43,024
- What is this supposed to do?
- Just a mild sedative to help you sleep.

857
01:32:44,037 --> 01:32:47,321
- I hate you.
- We don't hate you.

858
01:32:47,457 --> 01:32:50,872
There's no need for hate now...
or love.

859
01:32:52,419 --> 01:32:54,245
I love you, Matthew.

860
01:32:56,797 --> 01:32:59,003
There are people who will fight you.

861
01:33:00,385 --> 01:33:02,422
They'll stop you.

862
01:33:02,594 --> 01:33:05,797
In an hour... you won't want them to.

863
01:33:17,608 --> 01:33:19,978
Don't be trapped by old concepts.

864
01:33:24,322 --> 01:33:26,811
You're evolving into a new life form.

865
01:33:29,242 --> 01:33:31,282
Come and watch.

866
01:33:44,798 --> 01:33:47,465
We came here from a dying world.

867
01:33:48,384 --> 01:33:51,883
We drift through the universe
from planet to planet,

868
01:33:52,012 --> 01:33:54,051
pushed on by the solar winds.

869
01:33:54,263 --> 01:33:57,429
We adapt... and we survive.

870
01:33:58,392 --> 01:34:01,309
- The function of life is survival.
- Elizabeth!

871
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:20,365
Open the freezer, quick.

872
01:34:20,494 --> 01:34:22,783
- This door?
- Yup.

873
01:34:30,295 --> 01:34:32,334
Shut the door.

874
01:34:38,926 --> 01:34:40,966
How are we gonna get outta here?

875
01:34:42,262 --> 01:34:44,340
Through the door. Come on.

876
01:35:19,419 --> 01:35:21,460
What's that?

877
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,294
I've lost Jack.

878
01:35:28,429 --> 01:35:30,218
We got separated.

879
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:39,435
I don't know where he is. I've looked
everywhere. Have you seen him?

880
01:35:40,647 --> 01:35:43,648
Nancy, this building is surrounded.
How did you get in?

881
01:35:43,774 --> 01:35:47,938
I've been wandering among 'em for hours.
They can be fooled.

882
01:35:48,071 --> 01:35:49,896
How?

883
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:52,782
Don't show any emotions.
Hide your feelings.

884
01:35:52,908 --> 01:35:56,987
- And when you sleep?
- We'll watch over each other.

885
01:35:58,913 --> 01:36:01,321
- OK.
- Let's find Jack.

886
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:05,949
We're going to beat them. OK?

887
01:36:06,961 --> 01:36:07,956
OK.

888
01:36:28,271 --> 01:36:30,560
Hey! The lines are over there.

889
01:36:39,198 --> 01:36:42,067

You are in the rightplace for Sausalito.
Please keep moving right along.

894
01:37:00,423 --> 01:37:02,463
Sausalito only, please.

895
01:37:04,178 --> 01:37:06,216
Ask ifyou have a question.

896
01:37:09,765 --> 01:37:13,383
The yellow zone
is for loading and unloading only.

897
01:37:15,436 --> 01:37:19,304
If you have other business,
stay clear ofthe yellow.

898
01:37:20,316 --> 01:37:25,689
Stay clear ofthe yellow.
That's for loading or unloading.

899
01:37:38,416 --> 01:37:40,454
Get them! Get them!

900
01:37:41,418 --> 01:37:43,456
Get them!

901
01:38:49,477 --> 01:38:51,515
Come on, get up.

902
01:39:02,987 --> 01:39:05,027
Oh, God!

903
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:43,269
You see them?

904
01:39:43,522 --> 01:39:46,855
This is where they grow them.
This is where they cultivate them.

905
01:39:50,737 --> 01:39:52,776
It's enormous.

906
01:39:57,576 --> 01:39:59,653
What are we gonna do?
There are so many.

907
01:39:59,786 --> 01:40:02,704
We've got to figure out a way
of stopping them.

908
01:40:09,046 --> 01:40:11,084
Can you walk?

909
01:40:11,213 --> 01:40:14,379
- I'll try.
- Here, hold on to me and try and walk.

910
01:40:29,772 --> 01:40:31,810
Oh, God! Are you all right?

911
01:40:34,149 --> 01:40:36,190
A factory...

912
01:40:36,319 --> 01:40:38,357
They're growing them.

913
01:40:40,072 --> 01:40:42,110
Elizabeth.

914
01:40:45,326 --> 01:40:46,904
I love you.

915
01:40:47,121 --> 01:40:49,076
I love you.

916
01:40:49,245 --> 01:40:50,869
I love you!

917
01:40:53,207 --> 01:40:55,034
Come on.

918
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:58,252
Oh, I can't. I can't!

919
01:41:22,649 --> 01:41:24,061
Music.

920
01:41:27,613 --> 01:41:29,651
Ships.

921
01:41:30,574 --> 01:41:33,063
Ships... Ships!

922
01:41:34,202 --> 01:41:36,240
Ships! We can get away!

923
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:45,702
I'll go down there. I'll be right back.
Stay here.

924
01:41:45,836 --> 01:41:47,330
Stay here.

925
01:42:42,511 --> 01:42:44,882
- ..San Francisco Bay area.
- Oh, God!

926
01:42:46,432 --> 01:42:48,837
Mostly fair Saturday night and Sunday.

927
01:42:48,974 --> 01:42:51,891
There will be a cooling trend
with improved visibility.

928
01:42:52,019 --> 01:42:55,553
Night-time lows in the fifties tonight
and in the forties Saturday.

929
01:42:55,688 --> 01:42:59,057
Light winds becoming north-westerly,
10-20mph...

930
01:43:16,623 --> 01:43:18,661
Elizabeth, no! No!

931
01:43:22,503 --> 01:43:24,544
Wake up. Wake up.

932
01:43:24,756 --> 01:43:25,869
Wake up!

933
01:43:41,936 --> 01:43:43,763
I love you.

934
01:43:46,190 --> 01:43:48,230
The boat's there, Elizabeth.

935
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,351
The boat's there.

936
01:43:51,278 --> 01:43:53,317
It's gonna take us away.

937
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:35,479
There's nothing to be afraid of.

938
01:44:35,608 --> 01:44:37,601
They were right.

939
01:44:37,734 --> 01:44:39,776
It's painless.

940
01:44:42,197 --> 01:44:44,236
It's good.

941
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:46,152
Come.

942
01:44:47,284 --> 01:44:48,826
Sleep.

943
01:50:36,961 --> 01:50:39,037
He must be here somewhere.

944
01:50:39,171 --> 01:50:41,210
Let's go this way.

945
01:50:49,054 --> 01:50:53,053
- He must be around here somewhere.
- There's one over here, I think.

946
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:55,010
- We'll get him.
- We'll get him.

947
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:57,849
He can't stay awake for ever.

Why do we have to

954
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:24,578
I don't wanna take a nap. I'm not tired.
