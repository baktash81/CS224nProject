360
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,125
- [guard groans]
- I'm just an entertainer!

361
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,000
I am not entertained.

362
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,291
- [splutters] They're only tricks.
- Assault.

363
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:54,666
How could I produce an elephant on purpose
when I can't even escape from a jail cell?

364
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,625
Look. Freedom!

365
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,083
- Lima beans, my least favorite legume.
- [woman grunts]

366
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,750
You're behind bars where you belong.

367
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,583
- I'm going to make sure you stay there.
- [cell closes]

[somber music plays, ends]

369
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,333
Chest up, shoulders back. Breathe.

370
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:23,208
Direct, but polite.
Strong, but respectful.

371
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,250
[breathes nervously]

372
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,083
Sweaty and nauseous.

373
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,458
[indistinct chatter]

[Fortune Teller]
<i>The Countess, she's fair and wise,</i>

375
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,916
<i>and no one can remember
the last time she laughed.</i>

376
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,375
- She can sing!
- Can she sing?

377
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,250
Shh. Yes, Captain Matienne?

378
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,500
[clears throat] Thank you, Countess.

379
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,833
I've come to ask
where the elephant is kept.

380
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,166
Who sent you to ask?

381
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,750
Have you been approached
by a foreign power?

382
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,791
No. As captain of the palace guards,
I need to know.

383
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,208
The elephant is dangerous.
We don't even know where it came from.

384
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,416
The elephant is a criminal,
it is being treated as such.

385
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,708
A criminal? No.

386
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,416
- This may just be the opening barrage.
- Uh, what?

387
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,000
We must expect other beasts
to be launched at us!

388
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,375
- Camels! Cassowaries! Crocodiles!
- [crowd gasps]

389
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,541
[gasps]

390
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,583
We commanded the Magician
to disappear her! He says he's unable!

391
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,500
- As such, we plan to destroy her!
- [crowd gasps]

392
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,083
I haven't decided that.

393
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:29,125
If a boy throws a rock through a window,
can you blame the rock?

394
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,125
We're speaking of elephants.

395
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,708
- You're speaking of murder!
- The elephant committed a crime!

396
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,791
The elephant is guilty of nothing
except being an elephant!

397
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,416
I'll continue to consider this
until we meet tomorrow.

398
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,083
But let me say, Captain Matienne,

399
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,833
I take the safety
of our town very seriously.

400
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,625
She may need to be... gotten rid of.

401
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,333
- [adviser 1] Hear.
- [adviser 2] Agreed!

402
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,916
The only sensible solution.

403
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,208
[adviser 2] Quite right.

404
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,750
[Fortune Teller] <i>Now,
Leo Matienne sees one other way</i>

410
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,708
- Mm. Huh?
<i>- ...one, The King has never been to Baltese.</i>

411
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:24,208
...over the palace wall,
landing safely in the moat.

412
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,416
That's impossible! I love it!

413
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,541
[Fortune Teller]
<i>Two, The King likes to be entertained.</i>

414
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,041
<i>- Only to be entertained...</i>
- [man grunts]

415
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,791
<i>- ...and never to not be entertained.</i>
- [laughs]

416
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,625
I love you, sir!

417
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,000
Hey, who wants a nougat? You like nougat?

418
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,916
And a doctor. And then they'll go again.
Fantastic stuff. [laughs]

His Majesty wants... [huffs]

...to see the elephant!

425
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,458
- The... The King?
- Coming here?

426
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,934

- [adviser 2] Extraordinary!

I was going to come get you.

437
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,333
I said I'd help you see the elephant.

438
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,041
Oh, uh, I guess I just...

439

I'd like you to stay at the palace
and tend to my elephant.

- The kid's got pluck. [laughs] I love it!

The elephant is very dangerous, Peter.
That's impossible.

I happen to like impossible things.

Hey, what if Peter
does three impossible things

531

in exchange for one?

532
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,000
We're here for three days.

533
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,083
Each day, I'll pick something
impossible for the kid to do,

534
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:30,375
and if he does all three, thus proving
his valor, strength, blah blah blah,

536
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,500
If not, I'll take it back with me.

537
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,625
Well, I'm not sure...

538
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,875
It's a deal!
You're terrific, Countess. [laughs]

539
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:43,583
I like this place more and more,
wherever we are.

540
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:48,250
[clears throat]
Okay, the first impossible task is...

541
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,291
a fight!

543
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,916
- A fight?
- Sure!

544
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,958
Who doesn't like a fight?

545
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:00,583
And an impossible fight
is the best kind, right?

546
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,583
- Stands to reason, sir.
- The kid's up for it! I told you.

547
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,958
Right? He's got some idea
about the elephant.

548
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,708
- And destiny and...
- Uh...

549
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:12,916
[laughs] I love it! Okay, tomorrow, noon,
the kid fights my toughest soldier.

550
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,500
- [crowd gasps]
- Oh no.

551
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,500
- Pistols or sabers?
- Um...

552
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:20,083
Sabers it is! I love this kid!
Give him my saber, Henri.

553
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:21,750
It's all yours.

554
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:26,625
Unless you get killed, in which case,
you know, I'll take it back.

555
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:29,541
Peter, has any of your training
included sabers?

556
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,583
- No, sir. Broomsticks a bit.
- Mm...

557
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,166
Meet me at the store, if you like.
I'll try to teach you.

- Absolutely.

Oh, madness. How can the boy win?

574
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,083
What if he does?

575
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,583
What if?

576
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,291
Your "what ifs" will be
the end of us, Leo Matienne.

577
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,958
I beg your pardon, ma'am. But how can
two small words be so dangerous?

578
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:25,583
In Leo Matienne's hands is how.

579
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:29,541
What if we put all our savings
into raising pygmy goats?

580
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,500
A perfect pet. [laughs]

581
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:34,833
If they could've been trained
not to eat floors and walls.

582
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:38,208
What if we import rare goods
from the Far East?

583
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,166
Would've worked.

584
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,875
If the entire shipment
had not been eaten by pygmy goats.

585
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,333
They didn't eat the silks.

586
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:45,250
Ah-ha! Yes, the silk.

587
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,125
You see this roll of silk?

588
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:49,208
My husband wanted to use it
to kill himself.

589
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:52,791
It's called a parachute,
and there is evidence it can work.

590
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,583
- Has it ever worked?
- [Leo] No.

591
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:57,500
Actually, the results have been
quite grisly. That's true.

592
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,125
But what if I had been the first?

Don't say it.

605
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,875
And the two of us downstairs, all alone.

606
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:33,541
No, we've tried and failed. [sighs]

607
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,916
God does not intend for us
to have children, Leo Matienne.

608
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,458
And who are we to say what God intends?

609
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,125
Please.

610
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,333
My heart has been broken too many times.

It cannot bear your foolish questions.

612
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:50,791
But how? How will the world ever change
if we do not question it?

613
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,291
The world cannot be changed.

614

The world is what the world is
and forever has been.

No.

616
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,375
I won't believe that.

617
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:05,708
For here is Peter, standing before us,

- Are you well?
- I dreamt of an elephant, Sister.

Oh, but how lovely.

629
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:53,416
I find elephant dreams
particularly moving and portentous,

630
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,833
although I'm forced to admit that
I myself have never dreamt of an elephant.

631

It felt like the elephant
came to take me somewhere.

Oh, but you belong right here,
dear child, where you're safe.

Hmm. Safe from what, Sister?

From the world.

635
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:16,708
I went out to see the world, Adele,
and it was cruel.

636
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,458
So I brought you home to the orphanage,

Both could be funny.

00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:26,250
An elephant has appeared
under miraculous circumstances.

894

We must go!

895
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,458
No, no, no, no! We do not go to the city.

896
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:34,208
It is unsafe. Some harm could befall you.

897
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:37,291
But... my dream. This is a sign.

898
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,125
[chuckling] I do not believe in signs.

Yes, you do.

Yes. [scoffs]

901
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:46,208
I do, in fact, believe in signs.

902
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:48,833
Very well, dear.

- Oh!

904
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:56,625
Perhaps you do not understand.
My legs were crushed!

905
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,000

913
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:17,625
I know, your legs were crushed
by an elephant.

914
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,500
But for the last time,

915
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,791
I just intended a bouquet of lilies.

916
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:26,250
Just admit you crushed my legs
with your tricks.

917
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:30,500
It was an accident.
I intended a bouquet of lilies.

918
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:32,083
Lilies!

919

Now, you listen.

933
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:15,458
With De Smedt, you were lucky,

934
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:18,625
but this... this flying...

935
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,708
It is impossible.

936
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:24,875
I beat De Smedt, and I believe I will fly!

937
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:27,916
And I believe
you will be crushed flat. Dead.

938
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,083
Dead like your sister!

I have to fly tomorrow,

948

As soon as you see the elephant,

we're going back to the orphanage
where we're safe.

All right, I flew! What's next?

1146
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,333
Well, you've done
the second impossible task,

1147
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:59,458
so, you are one step away
from owning an elephant!

[King chuckles]

1149
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,166
It doesn't sound great when I say it
out loud. A lot of cleaning up.

1150
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,416
- Huge. Anyway. Okay. Good.
- [crowd laughing]

1151

I don't have it yet.

[splutters] No, I'm a spur-of-the-moment
kind of king, you know?

I... I come up with things
on the fly, you know?

Nope. Nope. Sorry. Stand down, son.

1163
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:46,333
I just get like this when I'm about
to say something incredible.

1164
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:48,791
[grunts] Okay, kid, you ready?

For your third impossible task...

1167
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:58,166
you will make the Countess laugh.

1168
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,458
- What?
- [crowd gasps]

1169
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:01,875

Oh.

1171

They keep doing this.

1172
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:08,000
What part of impossible
is tripping you people up?

1173
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:11,708
Im, not. Poss, the middle part...
Im... Something...

1174
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:13,833
Okay, I have no idea, but it means

1175
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,833
"impossible!"

1176
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:17,791
Plus, this kid's a killer.

1177

Anyone thinks they're better
than this kid,

1178
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,583
you're next jumping off
the cathedral wearing a tent.

1179
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:23,666
Remember that.

1180
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:28,166
You should stop worrying about the kid
and figure out who'll get me an ice cream.

1181
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,625
Preferably butter pecan.

- [elephant grunts]
- Not ever.

1196
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,083
Maybe they'd let me
jump off the cathedral again.

1197
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:17,583
I could write you a joke.

1198
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,875
Sorry?

1199
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:22,041
You're probably just not very funny.

1200
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,916
Right, and I'm sure you're hilarious.

Very sorry, miss.

1205
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,875
It's unlike me
to say something so insulting.

Please forgive me.

Yes, Sister.

No.

Now we can go home.

But, Sister...

1220
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:17,875
We'll get a good night's sleep,

I could have saved her.

I left her with the nurse.

01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:26,250
because I didn't want
to cause you any more pain.

1253
01:09:27,416 --> 01:09:29,625
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1254
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:46,791
Sir...

1255
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:51,333
did you see her dead?

1256
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:53,458
My sister?

1257
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:55,416
No.

1258
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:58,166
Then anything is possible.

1259
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:01,291
Well...

1260
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:05,791
you spoke of impossible elephants...

1261
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,125
and were correct.

1262
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:10,041
Sir?

1263
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:13,208
You stood before an impossible opponent...

1264
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:17,875
and you were victorious.

1265
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:19,500
Then today...

1266
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:20,916
[laughs]

1267
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,916
...I saw you fly!

1268
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,208
[laughs] It's you, my boy.

1269
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:27,333
You.

1270
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:30,583
You are what is possible.

1271
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:35,000
One more task tomorrow.

1272
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:40,041
Well, then, tell me a joke.

1273
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:46,208
A horse walked into a bar.
Um, maybe it can't walk into it.

1274
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,916
No, no! That's not funny.

1275
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,041
- No.
- [bleats]

1276
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,583
[Peter sighs]

1277
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:57,708
Oh, yes.

1278
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,458
- [laughs]
- [bleats]

1279
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:01,708
[laughs] Yes!

1280
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,541
[giggles]

1281
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,166
Yes, that is funny!

1282
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,583
[goat bleats]

1283
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:10,708
[meows]

1284
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:18,666
[sighs]

1285
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:21,333
Madam LaVaughn,

1286
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:23,208
I've lied to you.

1287
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:24,208
Oh!

1288
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:26,208
Finally, an admission.

1289
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:31,125
No, I didn't mean to hurt you
or make an elephant appear,

1290
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:34,041
but I wasn't trying
for a bouquet of lilies either.

1291
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:35,125
[LaVaughn] Mm.

1292
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,833
When I stood on that stage
facing all of you,

1293
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,416
your disbelief...

1294
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,750
- [crowd booing]
- [magician sighs]

1295
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:46,666
...it... it made my heart break.

1296
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:50,958
Even now, you see magic right before you,

1297
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:53,541
things conjured from nothing.

1298
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:54,666
[meows]

1299
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:59,166
Granted, a fractured magic,
sloppy, accidental, but...

1300
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:01,166
magic.

1301
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:05,500
To which you respond, "Stop,"
as you would to some minor nuisance.

1302
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:08,333
What has happened here?

1303
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:15,750
That night, I tried to cast a spell
on you and everyone else there.

1304
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,958
A spell to make you believe again,

1305
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:19,875
to care about magic,

1306
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:23,250
because extraordinary things are possible.

1307
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,291
If you believe!

1308
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:30,708
But I had no business
attempting such a powerful spell,

1309
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,750
because I'm not a very good magician.

1310
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:35,083
[cat meows]

1311
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:37,416
I tried for mystery and wonderment.

1312
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,041
[sighs] It brought disaster.

1313
01:12:46,541 --> 01:12:48,458
[insects chirping]

1314
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:50,750
- [elephant groans]
- I know.

1315
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,125
I know you're worried
about the Countess laughing,

1316
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:56,041
but I've got a great joke.

1317
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:58,750
And I've got it under control.
You gotta trust me.

1318
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,291
[snuffles and trumpets softly]

1319
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:03,625
Hey! [laughs]

1320
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:09,250
I feel like you're not taking me
seriously. I'm a dangerous man.

1321
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:13,708
- I beat a giant, I jumped off a building.
- [blows]

1322
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:18,166
Okay. okay. There'll be plenty of time
for messing about later.

1323
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:22,416
We just have to concentrate
on the final task, but...

1324
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:24,291
[yawns]

1325
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:31,291
[laughs]

1326
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:33,916
Oh, I can't wait to get you out of here.

1327
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:39,208
We're gonna have so much fun
and so many adventures...

1328
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:40,791
[yawns]

1329
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,541
...finding my sister.

1330
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:45,708
- [elephant squeaks]
- Hmm.

1331
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:53,208
[dramatic music plays]

1332
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:57,541
[Peter laughs]

[elephant trumpeting]

1334
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,541
Wow!

1335
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:09,791
[trumpets]

1336
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:13,458
Ya! [laughs]

1337
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:17,000
- [trumpets]
- [laughs]

1338
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,666
[elephant squeals happily]

1339
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,375
Woo-hoo!

1340
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,500
[grunts]

1341
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:27,500
Whoa!

1342
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:32,458
[laughs]

1343
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:36,625
[cheers]

1344

[elephant squeals]

1350
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:18,375
[gasps] Is this your family?

1351
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:19,833
[woman] <i>Peter!</i>

1352
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:23,625
<i>Peter!</i>

1353
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:26,500
<i>- Peter! Peter! Peter!</i>

01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:31,375
Peter.

1356
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:33,500
Peter.

1357
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:35,875
Hey, wake up. It's time now.

1358
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:36,958
[gasps]

1359
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:40,791
Everyone's here, Peter. The third task.

1360
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:43,375
[sighs] Well, this should be interesting.

1361
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:45,333
[guards] Oh!

1362
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,458
[elephant grunts]

[elephant grunts]

1364
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:55,000
You must really miss them. I thought
you were taking me back to my family.

1365
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:56,708
[elephant sighs]

1366
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:01,791
I need to get you back to yours.

1367
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:06,375
It's time for the third impossible task!

1368
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:11,333
Will the kid finally win
the elephant? [laughs]

1369
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:13,458
- [elephant groans]
- [crowd cheers]

1370
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:15,916
Yes, I will.

1371
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:19,375
[breathes deeply]

1372
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:23,000
[King] Now, if at any point
I hear the Countess laugh,

1373
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:24,958
you walk away with the elephant.

1374
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:27,583
- [crowd applauds]
- [exhales]

1375
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:32,333
Proceed.

1376
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:38,625
[chuckles]

1377
01:16:39,416 --> 01:16:40,666
[chuckles]

1378
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:50,875
So, there's a farmer and a fisherman.

1379
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:54,083
- They're out in a field together.
- Solid start. Classic.

1380
01:16:54,166 --> 01:16:56,750
When they hear
a funny kind of croaking noise,

1381
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:59,833
they look over towards the pond
and they see a hen.

1382
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:02,416
The hen's got this piece of string,

1383
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,208
and she's working the string
in and out of the mouth

1384
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:07,125
of a frog by the pond,

1385
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:10,208
up and down with the string
in the frog's mouth.

1386
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:14,375
So, the fisherman says,
"Why do you think the hen's doing that?"

1387
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:16,708
The farmer turns
to the fisherman and says,

1388
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:20,583
"Well, sure, it's the same question
as always, isn't it?"

1389
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:22,541
- [chuckles]
- Huh? Huh?

1390
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:25,458
"Why did the chicken floss the toad?"

1391
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:26,541
[crowd groans]

1392
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:29,916
[laughs] Nailed it!
Funny stuff, Peter! Funny stuff!

1393
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:32,333
[crowd sighs]

1394
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:34,458
[sighs]

1395
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:35,625
[groans]

1396
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:40,458
Oh, I get it.

1397
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:44,208
Why did the chicken...?
Because it sounds like...

1398
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:46,625
[laughs forcefully]

1399
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,375
Hold on. Hold on.

1400
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:50,333
That's not a real laugh.

1401
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:54,958
If you're not gonna take this seriously,
Countess, then what's the point?

1402
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:56,625
Sorry, kid, you failed.

1403
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:58,083
[crowd groaning]

1404
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:02,041
Oh, Peter.

1405
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:03,583
[elephant sighs]

1406
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,833
No.

1407
01:18:05,916 --> 01:18:07,750
What? No?

1408
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,208
You have to let me take her,

1409
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:13,000
but not for me, for her.

1410
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:14,083
[elephant groans]

1411
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:17,708
All this time, I've tried to win
the elephant to find my family,

1412
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:22,083
but she has a family
and she was taken from them.

1413
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:24,416
Peter, what about your sister?

1414
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,583
The elephant might have a sister too.

1415
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:28,583
Why is mine more important?

1416
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:32,750
I know the joke didn't work,

1417
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:36,875
but please, the elephant didn't ask
to be brought here.

1418
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:39,666
We have to send her home.

1419
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,541
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1420
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:46,250
Man, you almost had me.

1421
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:47,416
But no.

1422
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:52,416
You had one last thing to do,
and I don't see her laughing.

1423
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,625
Grab the elephant and we'll roll.

1424
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:56,541
[elephant trumpeting]

1425
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:59,250
No! No! No!

1426
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:02,208
[elephant stops trumpeting]

1427
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:08,083
Okay, I know. This is impossible.

1428
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,208
But what if it wasn't?

1429
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,541
Just think for a moment.

1430
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,208
Think of all
of the impossible things you've done,

1431
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:20,250
and you've probably done plenty.

1432
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:23,583
Have you ever gotten through
one of them alone?

1433
01:19:23,666 --> 01:19:27,208
Of course not. That would be absurd.

1434
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:30,250
Peter fought and flew and defied a king,

1435
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:33,041
- and maybe he feels alone.
- [purrs]

1436
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:34,333
But he's not.

1437
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:36,458
No one is. Remember that.

1438
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,666
[elephant trumpeting]

1439
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,500
[meows]

1440
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:42,291
[guard] Let's go!

1441
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:43,833
[elephant sniffles]

1442
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:45,708

[crowd gasps]

1445
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,500
Oh no.

1446
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:55,416
- [elephant squealing]
- [cat whines]

1447
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,625
[splutters] I...

1448
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,666
[laughs]

1449
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:07,291
[elephant trumpeting]

1450
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:13,166
[Peter chuckles]

1451
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:15,250
[crowd laughs]

1452
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:17,083
[laughs forcefully]

1453
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:26,958
All right, kid, you did it.

1454
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:29,000
What? Really?

1455
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:30,875
But... but it was the elephant.

1456
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:34,916
She's laughing, right?
That's all I really wanted.

1457
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:40,208
Things are only impossible
till they're not.

1458
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:43,000
The elephant is yours, Peter.

1459
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:44,958
[gasping] What?

1460
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:48,500
Glorious victory! Huzzah!

1461
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,208
[crowd cheers]

1462
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:51,708
[both laugh]

1463
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:53,000
[laughs]

1464
01:20:57,541 --> 01:21:01,083
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

1465
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:03,125
Yeah! [laughs]

1466
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:06,208
Wow.

1467
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,500
- [laughs]
- [crowd cheers]

1468
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,791
[trumpeting]

1469
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:15,750
We did it! We did it! [cheers]

1470
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:22,791
Mm. Whoa, whoa! [laughs]

1471
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:26,000
How will we get her home?

1472
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:27,416
A barge across the sea!

1473
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,333
A dirigible?

1474
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:31,208
Carried over the mountains
by larger elephants!

1475
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:33,458
That seemed good until I said it out loud.

1476
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:35,041
[crowd laughs]

1477
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:37,041
- The Magician!
- [crowd gasps]

1478
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,583
- [snoring]
- [LaVaughn] Wake up now.

1479
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,458
This boy says the elephant must go home.

1480
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:45,375
- You must make her disappear.
- [coos]

1481
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:48,708
You've seen what happens
when I attempt that spell.

1482
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:50,708
We're lucky it wasn't worse.

1483
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:54,333
Sir, the elephant deserves
to be with her family.

1484
01:21:54,416 --> 01:21:58,083
Yeah, that's a lovely idea,
but look around you.

1485
01:21:58,166 --> 01:21:59,875
My magic is all failure!

1486
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,708
- Failure?
- I can't do it!

1487
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:03,208
Nonsense!

1488
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:06,708
- You brought an elephant through the roof.
- [grunts]

1489
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:11,291
And don't you realize
it started something here?

1490
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:13,916
The very thing you wished for.

1491
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:17,000
[elephant trumpets]

1492
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:21,625
Hey, magic man!
Let's send the big lady home!

1493
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,083
[pigeon coos]

1494
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:26,625
I believe that you can perform
the necessary magic.

1495
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:30,166
I believe that only you
can set things right.

1496
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:35,166
[dramatic music plays]

1497
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,083
[elephant trumpets]

1498
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:54,500
Sister! Sister!

1499
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:57,166
Sister, please.

1500
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:00,166
In my dream, I was meant to follow her.

1501
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,416
[laughing] I do not believe in dreams.

1502
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,125
Yes, you do.

1503
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:11,791
Yes, I do, in fact, believe in dreams.

1504
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:14,750
Oh, very well. [yelps]

1505
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:17,416
[dramatic music intensifies]

[elephant trumpets]

1507
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,333
Developments are afoot. [sighs]

1509
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:55,458
[panting]

1510
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:01,958
The battle must be joined.

1511
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:13,291
[panting]

1512
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:21,000

[dramatic music ends]

1514
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,250
Hey, it's okay.

1515
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,333
- [elephant grunts]
- It's okay.

1516
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:36,916
[sighs]

1517
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:45,458
I heard it was different here before.

1518
01:24:45,958 --> 01:24:49,541
There was light,
there was life, there was hope.

1519
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:54,416
The perfect kind of town
to make an elephant disappear.

1520
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,208
This is my home,

1521
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:00,208
but it's not hers.

1522
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,750
[elephant grunting]

1523
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,500
It's hard to lose a friend.

1524
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,166
[laughs]

1525
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:16,875
We have to say goodbye now.

[sniffles]

1528
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:23,458
The Magician brought her here,

1529
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:29,083
and I believe that he can send her home!

1530
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:34,291
Do you believe?

1531
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:37,708
That is how it will be accomplished.

1532
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:41,125
- [elephant trumpets]
- [crowd gasps]

1533
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,333

[triumphant music plays]

1551
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:20,583
I can't believe I just saw magic!

1552
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:31,500
- [woman 1] What's happening?
- [woman 2] Look at the clouds!

1553
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:36,291
[man 1] It's magic.

1554

- [woman 3] It's clearing!
- [crowd gasps]

1555

- What is it?
- [laughs] It's sun, my darling.

1556

It's good.

[man 2] Sunshine!

1559
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:58,791
You were meant to follow her
to your destiny.

1560
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,583
This was more important.

1561

[laughing]

1562
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,958
Come on now, Adele. Time to go home.

1563
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:22,625
Sir, you're outside!

1564

Oh.

Oh.

The soldier?

1568
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:31,833
You were dead.

1569
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:33,333
You were dead.

Do you...?

1571
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:40,416
Do you mean?

Ow! What was that for?

1594
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,541
No more jumping off buildings!

I'm sorry for the harm
I've caused you, madam.

A town restored. Can you see?

1607
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:36,916
[Countess] You've been visiting
