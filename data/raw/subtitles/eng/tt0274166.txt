1
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,720
Ah, the Heckler & Koch G-36.

2
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,960
Quite deadly
in the right hands.

3
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,240
Ah, Agent One.

4
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,361
I have been so looking forward
to this moment.

5
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,841
Well, in that case,
I'll try not to disappoint.

6
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,841
You overestimate your power
over women, Mr. English.

7
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,801
I'd say that would be
virtually impossible.

8
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,201
Sir? Sir?

9
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,961
- Sir! Have you got them?

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,721
- Hmm?
- The mission documents.
Agent One's flying tonight.

11
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:43,161
Yes, the mission documents.
They're here somewhere. Ah, here we are.

12
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,761
Agent One.

13
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,601
Gentlemen.

14
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,641
I'm here for my documents.

15
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:00,921
Bough, Agent One's
documents, please.

16
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:06,481
- Thank you.

17
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,161
Your mission documents,
Agent One.

18
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:12,441
Including the codes for the submarine
hatch, which I've checked myself.

19
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:15,162
Thank you.

20
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:20,242
So, is it just France tonight,
or will you be slipping
over the Pyrenees as well?

21
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:24,041
If I told you that,
I'm afraid I'd have to kill you.

22
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:28,281
Oh.

23
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:33,641
 Oh, yes, yes.
Well, I expect you would.

24
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:35,602
Cheerio, Agent One.

25
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,762
Bonne chance.
Arrivederci.

26
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:45,042
Such class.
Such distinction.

27
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:49,641
To: Ml7 All Depts. Urgent
Agent One killed in action in Biarritz.

28
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:53,201
Submarine hatch failed to open.

29
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:58,322
The greatest secret agent England's
ever had snuffed out in an instant.

30
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:01,161
Terrible.

31
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:04,721
Do you know what makes us envied
the world over, Bough?

32
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:09,002
- That there's always another
agent waiting to step in.
- Absolutely, sir.

33
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:12,401
And every last one of them
is gathered around that grave.

34
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:16,722
It is our honor and privilege
to guard them while they grieve.

35
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:20,842
Their lives
are in our hands, Bough.

36
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:32,121
Everything in order, English?

37
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:35,961
I think you'll find it's rather more
than just in order, sir.

38
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:39,922
You're now entering the most secure
location in the whole of England.

39
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:49,562
 Pegasus,
we face a national crisis.

40
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:53,522
Agent One was clearly onto something,
and we have to find out what.

41
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:56,082
I need another agent on this.
Who else is there?

42
00:04:56,122 --> 00:04:59,802
No one, Prime Minister.
They all died in the explosion.

43
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,722
All of them?

44
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:04,882
Well, luckily there is
one who survived.

45
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:06,202
Who?

46
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:08,682
One eye on the shadows

47
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:11,002
Protecting his fellows

48
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:14,162
- From sunup
till the moon on his back

49
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:17,882
- Sendin' villains to Hades
A hit with the ladies
- Johnny English.

50
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:21,203
A stallion in the sack

51
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:25,562
- You can't get your life back
when right follows left, Jack

52
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:28,722
The more you see
the less you know

53
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:33,042
When others would leak it
His service is secret

54
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,843
Plays God
when it's your time to go

55
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:39,762
Hey, fellas
Don't be jealous

56
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:43,163
When they made him
they broke the mold

57
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:47,322
So charismatic
with an automatic

58
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:50,482
Never prematurely
shooting his load

59
00:05:50,563 --> 00:05:52,522
Hah!

60
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,003
Queen and country
safe and sound

61
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:56,003
With villains
six feet underground

62
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:58,483
And no one knows 'cause
no one's found any trace

63
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:01,243
Of a man for all seasons

64
00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:03,883
Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone

65
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,163
So alone

66
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:10,963
And you and I wouldn't have a clue
who's doin' what, why, when and who

67
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,403
Up a creek with no canoe
Watch out

68
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:15,962
For the man
for all seasons

69
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,842
Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone

70
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:20,403
So alone

71
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:25,443
- But safe at home
- But safe at home

72
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:29,643
- Oh, yeah, yeah
- But safe at home

73
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,603
But safe at home
But safe at home

74
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,123
Then you and I wouldn't have a clue
who's doin’ what, why, when and who

75
00:06:40,203 --> 00:06:43,443
Up a creek with no canoe
Watch out

76
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:45,723
For the man
for all seasons

77
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:49,523
Loves 'em and leaves 'em
alone, so alone

78
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:53,563
But safe at home

79
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,644
Right.

80
00:06:57,723 --> 00:07:01,643
Johnny English.
I'm here to see Pegasus.

81
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:04,923
Still, no sense
rushing things.

82
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:10,443
There are some items you need
to sign before your briefing.

83
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:13,404
This is your new
retinal I.D. Card,

84
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:16,164
and this is your level nine
security clearance.

85
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:19,803
Sign and date, please.

86
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:22,003
Ah.

87
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,724
Oh, reminds me of the old
service issue ballpoint.

88
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:29,203
I remember every agent would carry
a pen that looked just like this.

89
00:07:29,243 --> 00:07:32,444
Completely innocent to the untrained
eye, but click it twice...

90
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,443
Ah, English, there you are.

91
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,404
Have you seen my secretary?

92
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:44,684
Um... she went out.

93
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:49,403
Um... shall we?

94
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:56,403
Now, Agent One believed that there was
a plot to steal the Crown Jewels.

95
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:59,164
They've recently been through
a multimillion-pound restoration,

96
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:01,844
largely paid for
by a corporate sponsor.

97
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:05,324
They're due to be unveiled
tonight at the Tower of London.

98
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:09,484
The queen is insisting that the ceremony
goes ahead, so what we want you to...

99
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,443
Hah! Who... Who...

100
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:18,164
Who is the sponsor, sir?

101
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:20,564
Pascal Sauvage.

102
00:08:20,604 --> 00:08:23,564
What, that flouncy Frenchman
who owns a couple of prisons?

103
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:26,924
Sauvage's £7 billion empire,
English,

104
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:29,884
operates over 400 prisons
in 60 countries.

105
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:32,404
- He's built 25 of them here.
- Right, sir.

106
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:35,124
The man's related to the royal family,
for goodness’ sake.

107
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:40,124
As far as the prime minister's
concerned, he's one of the
greatest friends England's got.

108
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:45,844
Now, English, I want you at the Tower
tonight, monitoring this unveiling.

109
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:48,404
Any chink in security,
any weakness,

110
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:51,284
however slight,
must be plugged immediately.

111
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:53,724
Do we understand each other?

112
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:55,764
- Perfectly, sir.
- Good.

113
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:58,604
- Oh, yes.
- And, uh, English...

114
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:02,204
we can't afford any mistakes...
not tonight.

115
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:06,924
The word "mistake," sir, is not one
that appears in my dictionary.

116
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,565
THE TOWER OF LONDON

117
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,684
Fantastic car, sir!

118
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:28,245
Mr. English, Colonel Sir Anthony
Chevenix, head of Royal Security.

119
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,204
Ah, Colonel,
good evening.

120
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:33,165
- Snipers posted on the roof
as per my request?
- Thirteen of them.

121
00:09:33,244 --> 00:09:36,124
- Windows?
- Refitted with bullet-
and shatter-proof glass.

122
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:42,964
I shall now mingle
inconspicuously with the guests.

123
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:46,005
- Let me know when Her Majesty arrives.
- Very good.

124
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,724
Shall I mingle
with you, sir?

125
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:51,845
Oh, yes, Bough.
Once you've checked the roof.

126
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:15,605
Help! Help!

127
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:17,644
Well, hello.

128
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:20,685
Hello yourself.

129
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:23,565
Johnny English.

130
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:26,165
Lorna Campbell.

131
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:29,045
A Bloody Mary, please,
not too spicy.

132
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:32,605
So, are you here
in some professional capacity?

133
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,005
I worked on the restoration
of the jewels.

134
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:38,005
- Intriguing.
- And yourself?

135
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:41,725
If I told you that,
I'm afraid I'd have to kill you.

136
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,966
I'd like to see you try.

137
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:52,726
Monsieur Sauvage,
on behalf of Her Majesty,

138
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:55,005
may I welcome you
to the Tower.

139
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:57,285
Merci, monsieur.

140
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:59,446
So, are you here alone,
Mr. English?

141
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,525
That's how I choose
to live my life, Miss Campbell.

142
00:11:02,606 --> 00:11:07,325
Women want safety, security.
I can offer them nothing but danger.

143
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:10,205
Some women find danger
very attractive.

144
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:13,286
Women like you,
Miss Campbell?

145
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:18,165
Women like me
expect men like you...

146
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:20,406
to find that out
for yourself.

147
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:23,245
Hmm.

148
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:26,046
Madame.

149
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:30,645
Oh, it's for me, actually. Could your
rustle up some of those cheesy nib lets?

150
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:33,085
Now, where were we?

151
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,965
You obviously haven't met
our host, Monsieur Sauvage.

152
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:38,165
No, thank God.

153
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:42,806
You know, I think I'd rather have
my bottom impaled on a giant cactus...

154
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:45,526
than exchange pleasantries
with that jumped-up Frenchman.

155
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:50,486
As far as I'm concerned, the only thing
the French should host is an invasion.

156
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:54,606
Sorry, can I help?

157
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:58,166
Pascal Sauvage,
jumped-up Frenchman.

158
00:11:58,246 --> 00:12:01,246
Lorna Campbell. I've been so looking
forward to meeting you.

159
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:03,926
- Enchanté.

160
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:07,046
But of course! You’re Johnny English.
I've heard all about you.

161
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,646
And between you and me,
I'm not so keen on the French myself.

162
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:13,366
But please
don't tell them that.

163
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:16,126
Let me go and search
for your nibbly cheese bits.

164
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:20,846
- No, no, no. L...
- I insist. The French are,
after all, fantastic waiters.

165
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:23,006
- The best in the world.
- Well... But-But...

166
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:25,726
- Wait here, and I will wait on you.
- No, really. There's no...

167
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:29,447
No. Please, please, please!

168
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,566
Hmm. Les Français.

169
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:38,846
Ils sont very...
n'est-ce pas?

170
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:57,046
Ladies and gentlemen,
mesdames est messieurs,

171
00:12:57,086 --> 00:13:01,566
bienvenus, welcome tonight
to this wonderful occasion.

172
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,406
As we stand here
in the Tower of London,

173
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:07,567
the most famous prison
in the world,

174
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:11,046
where these wonderful
jewels will rest safely...

175
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,246
under lock and key,

176
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:16,047
I want to thank you...

177
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:19,006
for giving me
this wonderful experience...

178
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:23,806
to contribute to the restoration
of these jewels.

179
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:28,247
It was, as we say in France,
le top, le best of.

180
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,526
- And what a beautiful...

181
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:55,607
It's Colonel Chevenix! He's got
a nasty wound, sir. Who hit him?

182
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:59,127
The assailant.
He ran in here.

183
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:01,567
Bough, you guard the door.

184
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:05,207
Aha!

185
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:11,167
For God's sake, Bough, don't come in.
The man's a maniac!

186
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:14,527
- You don't frighten me!

187
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,727
- Missed!

188
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:48,207
- I've managed to subdue the assailant.

189
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,368
The panic's over.
Everything's under control.

190
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:59,048
Thank you. And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

191
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,887
we should compose ourselves
for the arrival of Her Majesty...

192
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:05,047
and return to the site
of our great nation's...

193
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:09,407
magnificently restored
Crown Jewels.

194
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:15,447
I know.
I feel it too.

195
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:17,887
The very symbols
of our island nation,

196
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:21,728
so close we could almost
reach out and...

197
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:27,168
- Pray silence
for Her Majesty the Queen.

198
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:30,208
Oh, where are the jewels?

199
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:32,847
It's an unmitigated disaster, English.

200
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:35,327
I couldn't agree more, sir.

201
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:39,048
Well, we need to get these
jewels back, English, and fast.

202
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:46,848
Tell me about this assailant.
When they searched the room,
there was no sign of him.

203
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:49,728
Well, the man was clearly
a professional.

204
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:52,888
He must have escaped while
the queen was being sedated.

205
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,928
But he's the only lead we've got.
We have to find him.

206
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:59,968
Come in. This is...
This is Roger from Data Support.

207
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:03,088
Please sit down. He'll produce
a likeness based on your description.

208
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:06,488
So tell us,
what did this man look like?

209
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:09,528
Um... well...

210
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:12,728
he was... big.

211
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:18,649
- Hair color?
- Um... orange.

212
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:21,728
- Orange?
- Mmm. And curly.

213
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:25,048
Well, frizzy, actually.
Frizzy sort of thing.

214
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:27,969
- Frizzy.
- An eye patch.

215
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:31,568
Broken nose.
Very few teeth.

216
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:33,888
Two, I would say,
at the most.

217
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:37,248
And a scar on his cheek...

218
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:41,568
in the shape... of a banana.

219
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:45,529
- Which cheek?
- Both cheeks.

220
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:48,369
They sort of met
in the middle.

221
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:58,168
Are you sure
about this, English?

222
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:02,609
 Oh, yes, that's him.
An uncanny resemblance.

223
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,848
Why, it's just as if
he's in the room with us.

224
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:16,688
Wow! Look at this, sir.
Got all the bells and whistles.

225
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,609
Never mind about the gadgets.
Just focus on the case.

226
00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:29,448
Oh, uh...

227
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:37,689
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you very much for waiting.

228
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:42,048
Now, the question that faces us
this morning is a simple one.

229
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:46,529
Namely, how did the thieves gain access
to this highly secure environment...

230
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:49,849
and then escape
with the jewels afterwards?

231
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:54,689
A simple question, but one
which I believe has a complex answer.

232
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:57,889
- Actually, sir...
- Uh, please, Bough. My mind is at work.

233
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,889
Now, what you must grasp, gentlemen,
is that the master criminal...

234
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:05,169
sees not a room
but a series of opportunities.

235
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:07,489
Should I go in
through the window?

236
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:09,529
Possibly.

237
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:13,969
- Should I drop down from the ceiling?
- Actually, sir...

238
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:17,809
There's one thing I think
we can be fairly confident about,

239
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,409
that is that they didn't
come up through the floor...

240
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:22,649
I've got you, sir.

241
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:25,370
That's all right.
Just come my way, Bough.

242
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:29,090
- That'll bring me
right over the hole, sir.
- There's no need to panic.

243
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:34,489
Can you see
the bottom yet, Bough?

244
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,410
Not yet, sir. The shaft
appears to be narrowing.

245
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:40,369
I'm just a little bit worried
I might get stuck.

246
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,969
Trust me, Bough. You won't
get stuck if you just keep moving.

247
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,330
Yes, sir.

248
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:50,290
I'm okay, sir.

249
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,729
Are you at the bottom
now, Bough?

250
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,250
No, I am in fact
stuck now, sir.

251
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:58,930
Oh, for God's sake, Bough.
Stay there! I'm coming down.

252
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,090
Uh, I'm not especially sure
that's a good idea, sir.

253
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,929
Don't worry.

254
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,410
Be careful, sir!

255
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:13,009
Gently does it.

256
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,690
- Sir?

257
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,650
- Are you all right, sir?
- Yes. I landed on something quite soft.

258
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,370
- That was me, sir.
- Oh, good.

259
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,730
What now?

260
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,570
There's no way back
up there, that's for sure.

261
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,650
But this must lead
somewhere.

262
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,770
I'm slightly uncomfortable
in the dark, sir.

263
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,010
There's nothing
to worry about, Bough.

264
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,010
- It may be pitch black,
but we can still see.
- Can we, sir? How?

265
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,770
The Bedouin monks of
the Al Maghreb mountains...

266
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,170
developed a system
of sonic chanting.

267
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,890
- I see, sir.
- The sound of their chanting...

268
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,130
would bounce back
off any obstacles,

269
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:53,530
and using their
highly tuned ears...

270
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,290
they could paint a mental picture
of the path ahead.

271
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,410
- Brilliant, sir.
- However, you must always
sing in E-flat.

272
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,250
E-flat, E-flat, E-flat

273
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:12,050
Thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing

274
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,250
- Is it working, sir?
- Extremely well, thank you, Bough.

275
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,731
Thanks for all
the joy that...

276
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,090
- Ow!

277
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:21,531
You all right, sir? I think
I can see something, sir.

278
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,610
Oh, yeah. Come on.

279
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,851
Here is the long one.

280
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,970
It is a long one.

281
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,971
Careful.

282
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:55,890
- I knew it.
- Shall we call for backup, sir?

283
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:59,771
What? And watch some fat-bottomed
bobby make our arrest for us?

284
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,770
I don't think so.

285
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:08,251
Good morning, gentlemen.
Ml7 at your service.

286
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:13,051
Observe, Bough, the dull
incompetence of the criminal mind.

287
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:17,211
It can never hope to match
our level of technical expertise.

288
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:06,492
- You've got it.
- What do we do now, sir?

289
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:08,532
Watch and learn, Bough.

290
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:16,411
- They're too far ahead of us.
- Have faith, Bough.
They're heading south.

291
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:27,572
- There they are, sir!
- Just as I thought.

292
00:22:31,012 --> 00:22:34,692
- Hang on tight, Bough.

293
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:44,531
- We're never gonna catch them in this.

294
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:47,452
- Take the wheel, Bough.
I'm getting in the Aston.
- Sir?

295
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:53,691
Change places, Bough.
I'm getting out the other side.

296
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,452
Sir?

297
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:17,253
Set, Bough.
Take me up.

298
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:28,532
Swing me out, Bough!

299
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:35,612
- Whoa.
- Down.

300
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,572
- Up! Up!

301
00:23:45,332 --> 00:23:48,212
Sorry!

302
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:52,373
Bough, pull out!

303
00:23:57,573 --> 00:24:00,412
Ow! Ow!

304
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,332
Those idiots
are right behind us. Faster!

305
00:24:26,893 --> 00:24:28,973
Uh-huh.

306
00:24:52,612 --> 00:24:55,173
Drop me here, Bough!

307
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:01,653
Ow! Oh.

308
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,893
No! No! No!

309
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:07,333
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

310
00:25:42,613 --> 00:25:45,534
 They're turning into
the Brompton Cemetery.

311
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:49,013
Get here as soon as you can.
I'm going in.

312
00:25:56,013 --> 00:26:00,293
In a wheelchair. But Geoffrey
overcame these terrible disabilities...

313
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:04,133
with that simple resilience
and sunny optimism...

314
00:26:04,174 --> 00:26:07,294
that so warmed
all of us who knew him,

315
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:09,733
spending the rest of his life
in the service...

316
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:12,694
of the poor and disabled
of this parish.

317
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:16,774
It's very good.
Really very good.

318
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:19,494
No, no, please go on.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

319
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:22,053
- It's very entertaining.
- Who's that?

320
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:25,213
That priest act of yours should keep the
other prisoners entertained for hours.

321
00:26:26,573 --> 00:26:29,453
Oh, I'm so sorry. Where are
my manners? Johnny English,

322
00:26:29,494 --> 00:26:33,414
British Secret Service,
and you are all under arrest.

323
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:35,134
I must say you've done
this whole thing very well.

324
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:38,653
The attention to detail
is excellent.

325
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:41,814
You, the grieving granny,
you're very convincing.

326
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:45,854
Oh, look. Real tears.
Do you get paid extra for that?

327
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:49,694
Ahh, what
we're all here for.

328
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,173
I know! Why don't we
take a look inside?

329
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:57,814
- Oh, you've nailed it down!

330
00:26:57,894 --> 00:27:00,254
Why would you do that?

331
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:05,094
I know you're gonna come back
in two weeks and dig it up again.

332
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:12,454
Now, what are you playing in this
little vignette of deceit and villainy?

333
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:14,334
I'm the hearse driver.

334
00:27:14,374 --> 00:27:17,334
- You're the hearse driver?
- Yes, sir.

335
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:21,734
- You're the hearse driver?
- Yes, sir.

336
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:24,734
Ah! Aha!

337
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:28,094
There you are... Gunther.

338
00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:32,414
Uh, I do hope he hasn't
made a nuisance of himself...

339
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:35,894
I'm Doctor, um...

340
00:27:38,254 --> 00:27:42,694
Bough, of the Lunatic
Response Unit.

341
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:46,775
I'm afraid Gunther here wasn't
supposed to be released until 2028.

342
00:27:46,854 --> 00:27:49,535
Isn't that right, Gunther?

343
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:53,534
Yes, yes, there's been
the most monumental cock-up.

344
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:58,334
Um, if you'll excuse me,
with the deepest respect,

345
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,694
utmost sympathy.

346
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:03,335
Uh, he hasn't urinated
on anyone, has he?

347
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:05,175
- No.
- No, no.

348
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:09,375
That's a blessing. Are you
gonna give me the gun, Gunther?

349
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:18,494
There. That wasn't
too difficult, was it?

350
00:28:18,535 --> 00:28:22,614
- Are you going to come home now?

351
00:28:27,215 --> 00:28:31,654
Oh... in the van!
Yes, we are going in the van.

352
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:34,055
Yes, yes.
Vroom, vroom.

353
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:37,215
- Vroom, vroom. Vroom, vroom.
- Yes. Yeah.

354
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:41,695
- Yes. He's waving good-bye.
Good-bye, everyone.

355
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:44,055
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Gunther.

356
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:46,895
Mind the nice dead people.
There we go.

357
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,895
Oh, we'll just go to the path
here. There. Big step.

358
00:28:55,975 --> 00:28:59,255
It's a graveyard. It's
where they bring people...

359
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:00,975
Yes, all right.
You can stop now.

360
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:05,256
- For appearances,
I'll just hold your arm.
- Just keep walking.

361
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:07,695
In fact, run, run, run!

362
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:17,215
I can't believe
I've done this.

363
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:21,375
I mean, I really
cannot believe I've done this!

364
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:28,855
You see, 200 years ago,

365
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:33,735
my family should have inherited
the throne of England,

366
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:36,615
but they were cast aside.

367
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:39,936
Well, in a few
very short days,

368
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:43,096
it will be back
where it belongs.

369
00:29:45,735 --> 00:29:48,255
With me.

370
00:29:48,335 --> 00:29:53,695
Shall I try it on?
Yes? No? Maybe?

371
00:29:54,216 --> 00:29:57,695
To make you king, we need
the archbishop of Canterbury to do that.

372
00:29:57,736 --> 00:29:59,816
The archbishop of Canterbury...

373
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:03,776
is being taken care of
even as we speak.
TARGET ACQUI RED

374
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:06,976
TARGET LOCKED

375
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:19,296
There's only one thing, sir.
What are we going to do about English?

376
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:25,976
If I were you, I wouldn't worry
too much about English.

377
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:29,656
He is no threat to us.
I had his flat bugged.

378
00:30:55,976 --> 00:30:59,456
Clearly, the aptly named
English is a fool.

379
00:30:59,496 --> 00:31:03,016
He might be a fool, but he's
a fool who keeps showing up.

380
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:07,016
Well, the next time
he shows up,

381
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:09,176
eliminate him.

382
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:10,337
Thank you.

383
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:13,217
Dieter Klein
and Klaus Vendetta, sir.

384
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:17,696
Released from prison six months ago.
327 convictions between them.

385
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:19,776
Armed robbery,
grievous bodily harm...

386
00:31:19,856 --> 00:31:22,216
and combined parking fines
of more than 400...

387
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,737
Uh, yes, all right. Thank you, Bough.
I think we get the picture.

388
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:28,376
The point is, sir,
that Vendetta and Klein...

389
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:31,816
are both in the employ
of Monsieur Sauvage.

390
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:34,936
- Pascal Sauvage?
- Precisely, sir.

391
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:37,737
But you're not suggesting
Sauvage is involved?

392
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:39,937
I think he's more
than just involved, sir.

393
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,376
I'm convinced he's
up to his French neck in it.

394
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:45,857
Don't be absurd. Sauvage
employs thousands of people.

395
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:48,417
Just because two of them
are villains doesn't mean that he is.

396
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:52,096
I want him discounted from this
investigation immediately.

397
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,097
Yes, sir.

398
00:31:57,337 --> 00:32:02,297
All right. Tonight I shall be
at Sauvage's reception
for the new French ambassador.

399
00:32:02,376 --> 00:32:04,257
Any developments,
you can reach me there.

400
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:08,536
Apart from that, I don't want you
within a hundred miles of the man.

401
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:10,537
Absolutely, sir.

402
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:14,537
Requisition order: Ml7 quartermasters
for immediate supply;

403
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:18,617
one military transport plane,
fully fueled, with permission
for nighttime city over flight;

404
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:23,137
two night camouflage parachutes,
plus reserves, plus neoprene
bodysuits, twice, in black.

405
00:32:23,217 --> 00:32:25,417
I've never liked the navy blue.

406
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:28,417
And a 40-inch chest for me
'cause I need the sleeve length.

407
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:30,297
- Morning, Felch.
- Morning.

408
00:32:30,377 --> 00:32:32,737
Oh, and two Special Forces
signet rings,

409
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,497
primed and color-coded.

410
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:37,097
- What's all this for?
- For tonight's operation.

411
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:39,937
We're going to break into
Sauvage's headquarters.

412
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:41,937
- But Pegasus said...
- Let me worry about Pegasus.

413
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:46,857
I know that Sauvage
is behind all this, and tonight
we're going to get the evidence.

414
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:50,217
- Is something wrong, sir?
- Did that sound like Felch to you?

415
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:21,377
Bough...

416
00:33:35,178 --> 00:33:37,417
You, upstairs.

417
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:53,418
Ow.

418
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:26,498
Can you see him, Bough?

419
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:29,658
He's on the upper level, sir.

420
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:36,938
Got him.

421
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:47,018
And like a coiled viper...
he strikes.

422
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:59,018
So what you're saying, sir,
is there must have been two of them?

423
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,338
Oh, at least, Bough.
Possibly four.

424
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:02,819
I wonder why
I didn't see them.

425
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:04,899
You mustn't dwell
on your mistakes.

426
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:09,178
- You must learn from them, then move on.
- Yes, sir.

427
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:13,099
- So where were you, sir?
- Just drop it, Bough!

428
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:20,499
- Aah! What is it, sir?
- That bike.

429
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:24,818
You get things
sorted out for tonight.

430
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:42,059
Well, well, we meet again.

431
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,619
Mr. English.
What a pleasant surprise.

432
00:35:44,698 --> 00:35:46,779
I wondered when
you might show up again.

433
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:51,259
On the contrary, Miss Campbell. It is
not I who keeps showing up. It's you.

434
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:53,699
Do you like sushi?

435
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,739
Hmm?

436
00:35:57,139 --> 00:36:00,699
Oh, sushi! I practically
live off the stuff.

437
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:04,539
You might say the mysteries
of the Orient are no mystery to me.

438
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:16,939
- Sake?
- Ah. Sake.

439
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:19,939
Cheers.

440
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:25,139
May all your daughters
be born with three bottoms.

441
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,740
Now then, perhaps
you can explain how it is...

442
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:37,219
that I run into you
at two crime scenes...

443
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:41,539
and then can't find any record of you
on a single government computer.

444
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,099
Shouldn't you ask
the government that?

445
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:46,739
I am the government
and I'm asking you.

446
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,379
Let me.

447
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,299
Mmm. You're brave.

448
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,459
They say that sea urchin's
the ultimate acquired taste.

449
00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:03,179
Hmm. It's a personal
favorite of mine.

450
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,180
I think people are put off
by how it feeds through its bottom.

451
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:13,540
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

452
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,420
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm from Ml7.
Sorry. I'm a secret agent.

453
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,580
- Everything set, Bough?
- Just about, sir.

454
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,780
Actually, sir, do you mind if I
run through the plan one more time?

455
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,100
- No, no.
- These are the two buildings here.

456
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,620
This one is our target, Sauvage's
headquarters, next to City Hospital.

457
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,940
I jump first and land
on the south side of the roof,

458
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,180
abseil down 14 floors and
cut through this window here.

459
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,060
 I then land on the east side
and abseil down 12 floors.

460
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,740
Where you wait for my signal
that I've disabled the alarm system.

461
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,460
- Yes.
- You them break into this window here,

462
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,661
work your way along the secure corridor
and penetrate Sauvage's office.

463
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,220
- Yes, yes.
- Is that okay, sir?

464
00:38:29,261 --> 00:38:32,701
It's been okay ever since
I thought up the idea, Bough.

465
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,821
Oh, I nearly forgot, sir.
Your laser beacon.

466
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,821
- My what?
- Your laser beacon!

467
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,540
It'll guide you
onto Sauvage's building.

468
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:48,940
Your dependence on hardware
really does amuse me, Bough.

469
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:51,780
I've been dropped
into the Kalahari Desert...

470
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,220
carrying nothing more than a toothbrush
and a packet of sherbet lemons,

471
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,420
and I still found my way
to Bulawayo before Ramadan.

472
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:04,341
So thank you, Bough,
but no thank you.

473
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,581
- Bough, go!

474
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,100
Geronimo!

475
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:42,421
- Fandango!

476
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:07,901
Ugh! Ai-yi-yi.

477
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:15,061
Right.

478
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:33,382
- Alarm's disabled, sir.

479
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:35,381
Roger that, Bough.

480
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:14,301
This is worse
than I thought, Bough.

481
00:41:14,382 --> 00:41:18,382
Sauvage has got some kind
of laboratory set up here.

482
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:21,542
God knows what kind
of sick operation he's running.

483
00:41:34,062 --> 00:41:36,781
My God, what
have they done to you?

484
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:40,062
They've taken
some of my blood.

485
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:43,582
- Bastards!
- It's only for tests.

486
00:41:43,662 --> 00:41:46,381
Of course it is.
Come on, my friend.

487
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,542
Let's get you out of here
before they take anything else.

488
00:41:57,462 --> 00:42:01,542
Ah! Good evening,
Dr. Frankenstein.

489
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,622
This way, please.

490
00:42:03,702 --> 00:42:06,502
Come on.
I haven't got all night.

491
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:09,423
And you,
you angels of death.

492
00:42:09,502 --> 00:42:12,142
About turn.
Come on, let's go.

493
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:14,502
Come on, come on.
Keep moving.

494
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:17,982
Come on. Over there. I know
what you're doing here. And you.

495
00:42:18,063 --> 00:42:21,102
Come on. Quicker. Quicker.
Over there.

496
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:24,822
Now then,

497
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:28,382
perhaps you could direct me
to your evil paymaster.

498
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:32,782
- What are you talking about?
- You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

499
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:36,742
Where is the office
of Pascal Sauvage?

500
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:03,663
Are you coming over here
in a minute, sir?

501
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:07,663
I'm from Ml7.

502
00:43:07,742 --> 00:43:10,622
This has been a test of your
emergency response systems,

503
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:13,823
and I have to say
you've all done extremely well.

504
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:15,943
Right.
Well, I'll leave you to it.

505
00:43:15,983 --> 00:43:19,063
And, uh, get well soon.

506
00:43:24,383 --> 00:43:28,503
Oh, God!

507
00:43:46,463 --> 00:43:48,703
Sir. Sir.

508
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,543
Did you just land
on the wrong building?

509
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:02,383
I did a precautionary sweep
of the immediate environment.

510
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:04,463
Right.

511
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:07,983
- And everything was fine.
- Good.

512
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:10,183
Okay, let's go.

513
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:18,423
I will be downstairs
at the reception...

514
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:30,063
- That's far enough.
- Well, good evening.

515
00:44:30,144 --> 00:44:33,223
- Perhaps you'd like this as well.
- What is it?

516
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:36,063
- Let me show you.
- Aah!

517
00:44:36,144 --> 00:44:38,543
Well executed, Bough,
but completely redundant.

518
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:41,703
- How do you mean, sir?
- Super-strength muscle relaxant.

519
00:44:41,784 --> 00:44:45,104
When he wakes up, he'll be
as floppy as a damp old sock.

520
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:52,823
What's this?

521
00:45:06,864 --> 00:45:10,343
That's the face of
the archbishop of Canterbury.

522
00:45:13,464 --> 00:45:16,184
What are they doing?

523
00:45:19,744 --> 00:45:23,264
 What's this got to do
with the Crown Jewels?

524
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:46,304
Bough.

525
00:46:03,265 --> 00:46:05,224
English.

526
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,464
A people whose empire
once covered...

527
00:46:07,505 --> 00:46:11,184
one quarter of the surface
of the earth.

528
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:13,864
Alas, no longer.

529
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:17,064
My friends ask me, "Pascal,
how can you be so interested...

530
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:20,624
in such a backward,
grotty little country?"

531
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:24,064
My answer is simple:
The queen.

532
00:46:24,144 --> 00:46:27,904
The queen has more power
in her tiny white gloves...

533
00:46:27,984 --> 00:46:31,464
than any other head of state
in the entire world.

534
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:33,825
She can declare war
or make peace,

535
00:46:33,904 --> 00:46:36,145
and most intriguingly...

536
00:46:36,224 --> 00:46:40,945
she can seize any piece of land
which takes her fancy.

537
00:46:40,985 --> 00:46:43,624
Of course,
the queen never uses...

538
00:46:43,664 --> 00:46:47,464
the enormous power
afforded to her.

539
00:46:47,545 --> 00:46:52,065
But imagine someone
who would use that power.

540
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:55,665
Imagine, say, me.

541
00:46:55,745 --> 00:46:59,785
But how could he do that, sir?
How could he make himself king?

542
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:01,985
The archbishop.

543
00:47:11,225 --> 00:47:13,225
Ow.

544
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:17,985
Hands up.
There's a good fellow.

545
00:47:18,065 --> 00:47:19,785
Heavily armed for a late night
at the office.

546
00:47:19,865 --> 00:47:24,225
You fool, English. You'll never
get out of the building alive.

547
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:26,505
I'd save your breath
for my questioning.

548
00:47:26,545 --> 00:47:28,465
I'm not telling you
anything.

549
00:47:28,505 --> 00:47:30,185
Incorrect.

550
00:47:31,425 --> 00:47:33,266
Sodium pentothal.

551
00:47:33,345 --> 00:47:36,745
- I won't lie to you. It's a truth serum.

552
00:47:36,826 --> 00:47:41,385
Now then, why does Sauvage
want to have himself crowned?

553
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,625
You have no idea
what's going on here, do you?

554
00:47:44,705 --> 00:47:47,745
 It would be funny
if it wasn't so "pablibblit."

555
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:49,105
What?

556
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:58,066
- He's talking gibberish, sir.
- I can hear that.

557
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:03,026
- He's collapsed onto me, sir.
- I can see that.

558
00:48:03,105 --> 00:48:06,385
- You don't think you could've
got the syringes mixed up?
- What?

559
00:48:06,465 --> 00:48:09,345
Given the guard outside truth serum
and given Klein the muscle relaxant?

560
00:48:09,426 --> 00:48:11,305
Aah!

561
00:48:11,386 --> 00:48:15,746
Don't be ridiculous, Bough.
I think I know my right from my left.

562
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:18,786
- Sir?
- Oh, bugger it.

563
00:48:20,306 --> 00:48:22,306
Bough, take "flodd."

564
00:48:22,385 --> 00:48:26,346
- Take what, sir?
- "Flodd." "Schlage."

565
00:48:26,385 --> 00:48:29,746
- I'm not quite getting
that second word, sir.
- "Schlaaaagh!"

566
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:31,786
- Write it down, sir.
- "Schlaaaagh!"

567
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,826
Yes!

568
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:38,626
"C." C-A... Uh...

569
00:48:38,705 --> 00:48:42,466
Car! Take the car!
We came by plane.

570
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:45,266
Bugger off!

571
00:48:45,346 --> 00:48:47,586
- Hold it right there.

572
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:51,026
- What's wrong with them?
- I'm not telling you.

573
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:53,906
Wrong answer.

574
00:48:53,986 --> 00:48:56,146
What is it with you two?

575
00:48:56,226 --> 00:48:58,465
Huh?

576
00:48:59,825 --> 00:49:01,506
Let's get outta here.

577
00:49:01,586 --> 00:49:03,466
Sorry, but who are you,
exactly?

578
00:49:03,546 --> 00:49:06,186
Special Agent Campbell.
I'm attached to Interpol in Paris.

579
00:49:06,226 --> 00:49:08,426
We've been watching Sauvage
for months.

580
00:49:08,506 --> 00:49:10,466
Why?

581
00:49:10,546 --> 00:49:13,586
Because every major convict released
from a Sauvage prison in six months...

582
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:15,826
has been employed
by one of his companies.

583
00:49:15,906 --> 00:49:18,306
We believe he's recruiting them
for a major criminal conspiracy.

584
00:49:18,386 --> 00:49:20,946
- We just don't know what yet.

585
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:24,466
- What did he say?
- Pegasus!

586
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:26,826
We have to report
to Pegasus!

587
00:49:26,906 --> 00:49:28,906
Oh, no, sir.
No, no, no.

588
00:49:28,946 --> 00:49:31,946
- How do we get out of here?
- Hey, you two!

589
00:49:32,026 --> 00:49:34,706
What you did to me
really hurt.

590
00:49:34,787 --> 00:49:39,027
Yeah. Sorry about that. How do we
get out of here without being seen?

591
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:41,826
Okay.

592
00:49:41,907 --> 00:49:45,586
Left by the fountain, right by the fire
exit, to the elevator at the end.

593
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:47,986
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

594
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:49,746
Nice job, Bough.

595
00:49:49,826 --> 00:49:52,626
- Left, sir. Left!

596
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:55,666
 Sir, you can't go
to Sauvage's reception in this state.

597
00:49:55,747 --> 00:49:58,546
The effect of the drug
has practically worn off.

598
00:49:58,627 --> 00:50:00,547
I'm "fline"...

599
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:02,786
"schline"...
uh, "gline"...

600
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,947
- Monsieur.
- Ah. Thank you.

601
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:21,066
- Would you like another?
- Please.

602
00:50:27,187 --> 00:50:28,947
Thank you.

603
00:50:34,107 --> 00:50:36,227
What in God's name...

604
00:50:36,307 --> 00:50:38,227
Ah, Foreign "Sebretarary."

605
00:50:38,306 --> 00:50:40,747
Um...

606
00:50:41,466 --> 00:50:42,667
Aah!

607
00:50:42,747 --> 00:50:45,986
- Shall we dance?

608
00:51:33,907 --> 00:51:36,868
Excuse me, sir.
I'm very sorry to interrupt...

609
00:51:36,947 --> 00:51:38,987
Pascal, how nice
to see you again.

610
00:51:39,028 --> 00:51:41,547
- Enjoying the party?
- Oh, splendid affair.

611
00:51:41,627 --> 00:51:46,547
I was until I was informed
that your man English...

612
00:51:46,627 --> 00:51:49,507
and his curious boyfriend here
have spent the evening...

613
00:51:49,588 --> 00:51:52,947
breaking into my office
and assaulting my staff.

614
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:56,188
- Is this true, Bough?
- Well, we... we...

615
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:08,427
What do you think
you're up to?

616
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:11,268
- Sir, if I could just offer...
- Go home, Bough!

617
00:52:11,347 --> 00:52:13,068
Now!

618
00:52:13,148 --> 00:52:15,668
I gave you direct orders
not to meddle with Sauvage.

619
00:52:15,748 --> 00:52:19,068
What do you do? Break into his office
and assault two of his staff.

620
00:52:19,188 --> 00:52:23,428
Then you march in here,
loaded with God knows what,
and insult the foreign secretary.

621
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,188
I haven't encountered such
behavior in Whitehall in 30 years.

622
00:52:26,267 --> 00:52:29,108
- But...
- There are no "buts," English.

623
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:32,628
You're off the case. Your security
clearance is hereby canceled.

624
00:52:32,707 --> 00:52:35,948
After a three-month leave of absence,
you will return at your old grade.

625
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:39,028
And I hope never
to hear your name again.

626
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:31,988
English has seen too much.

627
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:34,468
We go to plan "B."

628
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:36,908
Get rid of
the fake archbishop...

629
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:39,788
and green-light
the visit to Her Majesty.

630
00:53:39,828 --> 00:53:43,508
Then this pathetic country
can humiliate itself...

631
00:53:43,748 --> 00:53:46,148
by crowning me officially.

632
00:53:57,348 --> 00:54:01,429
THE QUEEN'S RESI DENCE
AT SANDRI NGHAM

633
00:54:11,269 --> 00:54:13,189
That's a letter
of abdication...

634
00:54:13,268 --> 00:54:15,188
renouncing your claims
to the throne...

635
00:54:15,269 --> 00:54:18,229
and the claims
of your entire family.

636
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:20,229
Sign it.

637
00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:29,949
Never.

638
00:54:40,629 --> 00:54:44,069
- Yes?

639
00:54:44,149 --> 00:54:47,429
Prime Minister, sorry to call so late,
but I'm afraid the queen is abdicating.

640
00:54:47,469 --> 00:54:48,869
What?

641
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:53,189
Abdicated?
But that's not possible.

642
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:55,349
I only wish that were true.

643
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:59,429
- Let me talk to her. Maybe she just...
- Pascal, she's gone.

644
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:02,109
My people have spent
the last 10 hours...

645
00:55:02,229 --> 00:55:04,589
trying to track down
the rightful heir to the throne...

646
00:55:04,629 --> 00:55:08,869
and they've come up with a name,
which they've double-checked.

647
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:11,309
Who is it?

648
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:14,390
- It's you.
- No!

649
00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:21,510
 In the wake
of the return of the Crown Jewels...

650
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,590
to a police station
in North London,

651
00:55:23,669 --> 00:55:26,310
Pascal Sauvage has requested
that his coronation...

652
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,790
take place
this Thursday.

653
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:32,109
In the House, the prime minister said he
was looking forward to the ceremony...

654
00:55:32,149 --> 00:55:35,189
and he believed that Monsieur Sauvage
will make a fine king...

655
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:39,949
and will bring all that is
best about modern Europe
to our ancient institutions.

656
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:49,709
Get your car keys.
We've got work to do.

657
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,790
- Miss Campbell.
- Sauvage is heading back to France.

658
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:57,389
He's invited 13 of
the richest criminal masterminds
in the world to meet him there.

659
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,350
I'm sorry, Miss Campbell.
I'm off the case.

660
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,350
It's been reassigned.

661
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:04,990
I know.
Reassigned to me.

662
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:11,110
- I want you with me.
- Just leave me alone.

663
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:14,830
Are you gonna sit here in this
grotty flat feeling sorry for yourself?

664
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:18,030
Or are you gonna get out there
and save your country?

665
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,430
I'm gonna sit in the flat.

666
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,430
- Johnny, this is ridiculous.
- I'm a spent force.

667
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:29,830
Spent, my ass.

668
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,270
Ow.

669
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,870
Will... you...
please... stop?

670
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,270
I'll just be a minute.

671
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,670
NORTHERN FRANCE

672
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:41,190
It'll be nightfall in an hour.
Then we can strike out for the chateau.

673
00:57:41,271 --> 00:57:44,391
The fact is, the moment Sauvage
gets that crown on his head,

674
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,591
he'll be able to do whatever he likes
with the country that I love,

675
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,270
and that is why you and I
have got to stop him.

676
00:57:51,991 --> 00:57:55,511
- Relishing the thought?
- Something like that.

677
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,951
I suppose you've made love
to lots of women, haven't you, Johnny?

678
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:08,231
Uh...
Uh, well, you know,

679
00:58:08,311 --> 00:58:10,871
one does one's best.

680
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:14,031
It's just...

681
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:18,991
Well, it's been three years
since my fiancé left me,

682
00:58:19,031 --> 00:58:22,711
and since then I haven't
made love to anyone.

683
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,631
But then I met you...

684
00:58:25,911 --> 00:58:28,751
and I felt this...
hunger...

685
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:30,791
deep down inside.

686
00:58:30,831 --> 00:58:35,111
I wanted to say things to you,
I wanted to do things to you...

687
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:39,551
that I haven't wanted to do
in a very, very, very long time.

688
00:58:43,391 --> 00:58:46,192
What, uh...

689
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,031
What sort of things
are we talking about?

690
00:58:49,111 --> 00:58:51,911
Things like
punching you in the face,

691
00:58:51,991 --> 00:58:55,191
kicking you in the backside for being
such a pompous, know-nothing asshole.

692
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:59,431
But then I started to see beyond
the idiot that everybody else saw.

693
00:58:59,511 --> 00:59:02,391
I started to see
the man on the inside...

694
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:06,472
who was determined to do his duty,
no matter what or who lay in his way.

695
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:10,312
And I began to feel
other things for him,

696
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:15,031
to want to do
other things for him.

697
00:59:15,112 --> 00:59:17,511
Things...

698
00:59:17,592 --> 00:59:21,231
involving plastic toys
and soft cheese?

699
00:59:21,272 --> 00:59:25,832
- What?
- What? What?

700
00:59:25,912 --> 00:59:30,152
You're toying with me.
You're telling me to stop in
the gentlest way you know how.

701
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:32,272
No. N-N-No...

702
00:59:32,311 --> 00:59:33,912
You're such a special person...

703
00:59:33,992 --> 00:59:37,072
not to take advantage of me
while I'm vulnerable.

704
00:59:37,152 --> 00:59:39,632
- N-No... Well...
- So thank you...

705
00:59:39,672 --> 00:59:41,872
for being such a gentleman.

706
00:59:44,312 --> 00:59:46,512
Not at all.

707
01:00:07,192 --> 01:00:10,392
I know what you're thinking,
Miss Campbell.

708
01:00:10,472 --> 01:00:13,232
If we don't pull this off, God knows
what might happen to England.

709
01:00:13,272 --> 01:00:16,552
Actually, I was thinking there must be
a better way in than that pipe.

710
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:19,072
Well, there isn't.

711
01:00:19,112 --> 01:00:22,672
I've analyzed it from every angle,
and this is the best option.

712
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:26,392
I'll go in first, and if it's a clear
way through, I'll call down.

713
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:30,032
Johnny.

714
01:00:30,112 --> 01:00:33,272
- Be careful.
- I'm always careful.

715
01:00:33,352 --> 01:00:35,152
Ohh.

716
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:25,393
- Gentlemen.

717
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:27,232
In a few hours time...

718
01:01:27,272 --> 01:01:30,473
I will become
the next king of England.

719
01:01:47,272 --> 01:01:49,673
Oh, no.

720
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,313
Hyah...

721
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:09,113
- How did you get here?
- Up the ladder.

722
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:11,633
Pull yourself together.
It's only a bit of poo.

723
01:02:15,673 --> 01:02:18,713
Oh! Oh, it's cold!
It's cold!

724
01:02:19,113 --> 01:02:20,873
What is the one commodity...

725
01:02:20,953 --> 01:02:25,593
the world never seems
to run out of?

726
01:02:25,673 --> 01:02:27,753
Criminals, gentlemen.

727
01:02:27,834 --> 01:02:30,034
- Lawbreakers.

728
01:02:30,073 --> 01:02:33,713
Every nation in the world
struggles...

729
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:36,433
with the issue
of overcrowded prisons.

730
01:02:36,474 --> 01:02:41,593
So, what do we do
with all these villains?

731
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:44,593
Find the solution
to that problem...

732
01:02:44,673 --> 01:02:48,873
and the governments of the world
would pay you through their nose.

733
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,873
Fortunately,
I have found a solution.

734
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:58,993
We empty every prison
on the entire planet,

735
01:02:59,033 --> 01:03:03,914
we take the resulting
tidal wave of human scum...

736
01:03:03,993 --> 01:03:06,514
and we put it here.

737
01:03:09,914 --> 01:03:13,273
The moment
I am crowned king,

738
01:03:13,354 --> 01:03:15,954
I will turn England
into the largest prison...

739
01:03:16,033 --> 01:03:18,794
in the history
of the world.

740
01:03:19,993 --> 01:03:23,514
210,000 square miles...

741
01:03:23,594 --> 01:03:25,714
of prime real estate...

742
01:03:25,753 --> 01:03:29,354
conveniently separated
from true civilization...

743
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:31,594
by 20 miles of ocean...

744
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,833
- and soon to be available...
- Come on.

745
01:03:33,914 --> 01:03:39,593
For the entire world
to dump its human waste in.

746
01:03:39,674 --> 01:03:41,714
According to
current projections,

747
01:03:41,754 --> 01:03:47,474
we will not run out of prison space
for the next 500 years.

748
01:03:47,514 --> 01:03:51,474
So, tonight one,
and only one, of you...

749
01:03:51,514 --> 01:03:56,434
will leave here
owning 49 percent...

750
01:03:56,474 --> 01:03:58,834
of this venture.

751
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:03,634
So that's his little game.
We must get hold of that DVD.

752
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:06,674
But how, Johnny?
There's only two of us.

753
01:04:06,754 --> 01:04:08,914
You're young, Miss Campbell,
and inexperienced.

754
01:04:08,994 --> 01:04:11,274
What you seem to
have forgotten is that...

755
01:04:11,354 --> 01:04:14,634
Nobody knows we are here.

756
01:04:14,714 --> 01:04:18,074
At our disposal we have
the vital element of surprise.

757
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:21,114
Now, my plan is simple
but effective.

758
01:04:21,194 --> 01:04:25,594
I shall drop from the gallery
at this end of the room
and take Sauvage prisoner.

759
01:04:25,674 --> 01:04:30,114
You will then enter from the far door,
cutting off any means of escape.

760
01:04:30,234 --> 01:04:35,434
Then, using Sauvage as a hostage,
we'll get the hell out of here. Clear?

761
01:04:42,635 --> 01:04:44,875
Get 'em up,
you French ponce.

762
01:04:44,954 --> 01:04:49,274
But, Mr. English,
I'm gob smacked!

763
01:04:49,355 --> 01:04:51,754
What an unexpected surprise.

764
01:04:51,835 --> 01:04:55,314
Surprises are very much
my speciality, Sauvage.

765
01:04:56,515 --> 01:04:59,194
I think we've seen
enough of this.

766
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:05,874
I know exactly what you're planning,
and I'm here to put a stop to it.

767
01:05:05,914 --> 01:05:10,515
My bottom will be king of England
before you are.

768
01:05:10,554 --> 01:05:12,474
Wrong again.

769
01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:15,634
Perhaps you'd care
to look behind you.

770
01:05:14,756 --> 01:05:17,995
Oh, please.

771
01:05:20,954 --> 01:05:22,955
Lorna!

772
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:27,635
I'm sorry, Johnny.

773
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:31,475
Well, I'm afraid
that we'll have to...

774
01:05:31,555 --> 01:05:34,195
conclude the floor show
for tonight.

775
01:05:34,235 --> 01:05:35,995
Not so fast, Sauvage.

776
01:05:36,075 --> 01:05:40,395
You may have taken me,
but you'll never take England.

777
01:05:40,475 --> 01:05:43,155
Not as long as I have
breath in my body...

778
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:45,435
or a bullet in my gun.

779
01:05:54,235 --> 01:05:58,675
You know, Mr. English,
I'm going to miss you. Really.

780
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:00,915
You're very entertaining.
I thank you.

781
01:06:00,995 --> 01:06:02,595
Take them away.

782
01:06:07,075 --> 01:06:08,755
Good morning, everybody,

783
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:10,955
and welcome to
the breakfast show.

784
01:06:13,196 --> 01:06:16,315
As the crowds are gathering here for
the crowning of our first French king...

785
01:06:16,395 --> 01:06:18,475
since the year 1066,

786
01:06:18,556 --> 01:06:23,275
call here at London FM with the top ten
things you most love about the French.

787
01:06:23,356 --> 01:06:25,915
We haven't had
any calls yet, uh, at all,

788
01:06:25,956 --> 01:06:30,196
but the lines are still open
and I'll give you that number again...

789
01:06:30,235 --> 01:06:33,235
0-2-0-7...
zero, deux, zero, sept...

790
01:06:35,836 --> 01:06:37,915
This is not good,
Johnny.

791
01:06:37,996 --> 01:06:40,076
We've got to think
of something.

792
01:06:41,755 --> 01:06:44,915
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

793
01:06:44,955 --> 01:06:46,516
Hop! Hop!

794
01:06:46,595 --> 01:06:50,196
And hop! And hop!
And stop!

795
01:06:50,275 --> 01:06:52,635
Now, are you familiar...

796
01:06:52,715 --> 01:06:56,276
with the shaman throat warblers
of the Guatemalan delta?

797
01:06:56,356 --> 01:06:57,716
What?

798
01:06:57,756 --> 01:06:59,676
It has long been
their belief...

799
01:06:59,755 --> 01:07:03,636
that a whistle pitched at the precise
resonant frequency of a metal lock...

800
01:07:03,715 --> 01:07:07,955
will vibrate the levers in such a way
that the door will simply swing open.

801
01:07:07,996 --> 01:07:09,516
Unbelievable.

802
01:07:09,595 --> 01:07:12,436
- And kneel.

803
01:07:15,276 --> 01:07:18,076
Right. Here goes.

804
01:07:29,036 --> 01:07:33,196
- I can't hear anything.
- I'm into ultrasonic.

805
01:07:33,276 --> 01:07:36,076
Will you just stop all this
and face facts?

806
01:07:36,156 --> 01:07:39,716
We've failed. The only thing
that can save us now is a miracle.

807
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:47,956
It worked!

808
01:07:47,996 --> 01:07:50,636
- Ohh!
- Sir?

809
01:07:58,556 --> 01:08:01,436
I don't know why you hauled yourself up
that dreadful poo tube, Bough,

810
01:08:01,516 --> 01:08:05,196
when there was a perfectly good ladder
right beside it.

811
01:08:05,276 --> 01:08:07,597
Now, Sauvage may have
fooled the country...

812
01:08:07,676 --> 01:08:10,316
with his fake archbishop
and his secret agenda,

813
01:08:10,396 --> 01:08:12,636
but he hasn't fooled me.

814
01:08:13,357 --> 01:08:16,436
- So, here's the plan.

815
01:09:09,356 --> 01:09:13,277
Let all good people
rejoice

816
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:16,237
Rejoice

817
01:09:17,477 --> 01:09:19,756
- Rejoice
- Aaah!

818
01:09:19,837 --> 01:09:23,557
Let all good people
rejoice

819
01:09:25,437 --> 01:09:27,637
Rejoice

820
01:09:27,717 --> 01:09:29,117
Rejoice

821
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:32,597
Rejoice

822
01:09:32,677 --> 01:09:35,117
Rejoice

823
01:09:35,197 --> 01:09:37,677
Rejoice

824
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:42,917
And sing

825
01:09:42,957 --> 01:09:47,477
Sirs, you are hereby called
to witness the anointing...

826
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:53,557
of your one true lord
and future king Pascal.

827
01:09:53,637 --> 01:09:57,517
Pascal, are you willing
to take the oath?

828
01:09:57,598 --> 01:10:00,117
I am willing.

829
01:10:00,157 --> 01:10:04,318
Then be thou anointed...

830
01:10:04,397 --> 01:10:08,077
with this holy oil.

831
01:10:08,558 --> 01:10:14,517
And do you, the chosen bishops
of England, Scotland and Wales,

832
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:17,277
ascent to this anointing?

833
01:10:17,358 --> 01:10:19,798
For Scotland, I do.

834
01:10:19,877 --> 01:10:21,517
For Wales, I do.

835
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:25,357
For England, I do not!

836
01:10:25,438 --> 01:10:28,998
- English!

837
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:35,678
That man must not be crowned king
because he is...

838
01:10:35,757 --> 01:10:38,478
a fraudster, a charlatan
and a thief.

839
01:10:38,558 --> 01:10:41,998
No, please.
Let him speak.

840
01:10:43,758 --> 01:10:46,638
It is this man,
Pascal Sauvage,

841
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:49,838
who stole the Crown Jewels,

842
01:10:49,918 --> 01:10:51,998
who forced the queen
to abdicate...

843
01:10:52,077 --> 01:10:55,838
and who would kill anyone
who got in his way.

844
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:57,837
It is the end,
Herr English.

845
01:10:59,438 --> 01:11:02,798
 He has cheated,
conned and manipulated...

846
01:11:02,878 --> 01:11:05,558
this great country
for his own ends.

847
01:11:05,598 --> 01:11:07,837
He's fooled you all!

848
01:11:09,757 --> 01:11:13,078
What's more,
this whole ceremony is a sham...

849
01:11:13,158 --> 01:11:16,598
because that man
standing in front of you...

850
01:11:16,678 --> 01:11:19,758
is not the archbishop
of Canterbury.

851
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:25,758
English, a word of advice:
Don't go there.

852
01:11:25,838 --> 01:11:30,198
Shut it, Frenchy. I'll go
wherever I damn well please.

853
01:11:30,278 --> 01:11:33,678
- Now take it off.
- What?

854
01:11:33,759 --> 01:11:36,958
Your face
is made of plastic.

855
01:11:38,559 --> 01:11:40,438
Remove it at once.

856
01:11:40,518 --> 01:11:42,958
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

857
01:11:43,038 --> 01:11:46,878
Right. I'll just have to
remove it myself.

858
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:50,998
Come on!

859
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:54,238
- Maybe it pulls up from the front.

860
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:56,678
Come on, you!

861
01:12:11,398 --> 01:12:13,838
- Aaah!
- Thank you very much.

862
01:12:15,559 --> 01:12:17,518
Must be a join here
somewhere.

863
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:20,438
Fascinating performance
as always, Monsieur English,

864
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,999
but I'm afraid
we must move on.

865
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:27,319
Nobody's moving anywhere until I'm
finished with this piece of low-life.

866
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:30,318
Do you or do you you not...

867
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:33,438
have tattooed on your bottom
the words,

868
01:12:33,519 --> 01:12:36,439
"Jesus is coming...
look busy"?

869
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:40,399
- Are you insane?

870
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:42,679
Well, let's find out,
shall we?

871
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,279
Go on, over.
Let's have a look.

872
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:56,279
- Excellent!

873
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:09,119
All right, so I was wrong
about the archbishop's bottom.

874
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:13,559
- But there's more.
- But not, I'm afraid, today.

875
01:13:13,599 --> 01:13:15,959
Sergeant, please
take this man away.

876
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:19,639
- But be gentle with him.
- Do you think that's it?

877
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,039
You think I don't have
more evidence?

878
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:25,399
My loyal subordinate
is standing by with a DVD...

879
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:28,959
which shows Sauvage's
hideous plans for this country.

880
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:31,159
Get him out!
Get him out of here!

881
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:34,959
- Play it, Bough! Play the disk!
- Play it! Now!

882
01:13:50,519 --> 01:13:53,839
- You're so hot teasing me

883
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,800
So you're blue, but I can't
take a chance on a chick like you

884
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,999
It's somethin'
I couldn't do

885
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:08,119
Well, I can dance with you, honey
if you think it's funny

886
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,879
Does your mother know
that you're out

887
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:14,519
And I could shout with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe

888
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,600
Does your mother know
that you're out

889
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:20,279
- Take it easy
- Take it easy

890
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,680
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go

891
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,079
Does your mother know

892
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,480
- Oi!
- Hey!

893
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,440
Well, shall we?

894
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,960
Then as Solomon was anointed king...

895
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,160
by Zadok the priest
and Nathan the prophet,

896
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:02,560
so be thou anointed...

897
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,480
and consecrated king...

898
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:09,080
over all the peoples...

899
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,640
whom the Lord thy God...

900
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:15,080
hath given thee to govern...

901
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,800
and of all your possessions,

902
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,320
wherever they may be.

903
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,601
And so,
in the name of the Father...

904
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,320
and of the Son...

905
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,280
and of the Holy Ghost,

906
01:15:29,121 --> 01:15:32,440
I crown you...

907
01:15:34,881 --> 01:15:38,560
Damn it!

908
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,641
- Give it back!
- No!

909
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,561
- That is my crown!
- Never!

910
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,040
- Give it back!
- Never in a million years, Sauvage!

911
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:48,000
- Give it to me!
- Get off.

912
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,680
Merde!

913
01:15:52,961 --> 01:15:54,361
Give it back!

914
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,921
- Stop!
- Shut up!

915
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,641
All this stupid little country
have to do is stand in line...

916
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:07,921
and do what it's told
for one miserable day!

917
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,681
But can it do that?

918
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,121
My fragrant French ass,
it can!

919
01:16:17,761 --> 01:16:20,241
Merde!

920
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,600
- Aah!

921
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:27,801
Give it! The crown, eh?
The crown! Go!

922
01:16:32,761 --> 01:16:35,041
And so, in the name
of the Father...

923
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,481
and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost,

924
01:16:38,641 --> 01:16:40,121
I crown you...

925
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:44,801
king.

926
01:16:44,881 --> 01:16:46,881
What...

927
01:17:12,721 --> 01:17:15,681
Arrest that man...

928
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:17,881
and lock him away.

929
01:17:22,441 --> 01:17:26,242
God save the king
Long live the king

930
01:17:26,321 --> 01:17:28,921
God save the king

931
01:17:33,321 --> 01:17:37,762
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen

932
01:17:43,561 --> 01:17:48,882
Ahh, amen, amen
Amen, hallelujah

933
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:51,042
Amen

934
01:17:59,602 --> 01:18:03,162
God save the king

935
01:18:03,242 --> 01:18:07,962
Words can hardly express just how much
we appreciate everything you've done.

936
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:10,362
Nothing more
than my duty, ma'am.

937
01:18:10,402 --> 01:18:15,322
And in return, is there anything that
your queen and country can do for you?

938
01:18:15,401 --> 01:18:17,562
Well,

939
01:18:17,601 --> 01:18:21,441
since one is asking,
ma'am...

940
01:18:21,522 --> 01:18:24,602
 In celebration
of her return to the throne,

941
01:18:24,682 --> 01:18:27,601
the queen has declared August 5
a national holiday...

942
01:18:27,682 --> 01:18:32,121
and has conferred a knighthood
on the unnamed Ml7 agent...

943
01:18:32,202 --> 01:18:36,242
responsible for foiling the plot
of french businessman Pascal Sauvage.

944
01:18:36,322 --> 01:18:38,841
Mr. Sauvage is now awaiting trial
for high treason,

945
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:41,082
a crime which still
carries the death penalty.

946
01:18:41,122 --> 01:18:45,402
If found guilty, he's asked that his
brain be donated to medical science...

947
01:18:45,482 --> 01:18:48,762
to further research into the causes
of hyper manic schizophrenia.

948
01:18:48,802 --> 01:18:51,842
Meanwhile, the unnamed English agent
has left the country...

949
01:18:51,922 --> 01:18:54,962
and has already embarked
on his next challenging mission.

950
01:18:57,762 --> 01:19:00,722
SOMEWHERE
I N THE SOUTH OF FRANCE

951
01:19:00,762 --> 01:19:02,963
Sir Johnny English.

952
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:05,762
Her Majesty
did seem very grateful.

953
01:19:07,322 --> 01:19:09,403
She's not the only one.

954
01:19:17,202 --> 01:19:20,803
Mmm. You are
full of surprises.

955
01:19:25,122 --> 01:19:28,282
Aaaah!

956
01:19:28,323 --> 01:19:31,842
- Johnny!
- Oh, f...

957
01:19:32,242 --> 01:19:34,522
One eye on the shadows

958
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:36,482
Protecting his fellows

959
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:39,522
From sunup
to the moon on his back

960
01:19:39,602 --> 01:19:43,762
Sendin’ villains to Hades
A hit with the ladies

961
01:19:43,803 --> 01:19:47,483
A stallion in the sack

962
01:19:47,562 --> 01:19:51,282
You can't get your life back
when right follows left, jack

963
01:19:51,363 --> 01:19:54,842
The more you see
the less you know

964
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:58,483
When others would leak it
his service is secret

965
01:19:58,523 --> 01:20:01,523
Plays God
when it's your time to go

966
01:20:01,562 --> 01:20:06,043
Hey, fellas
Don't be jealous

967
01:20:06,043 --> 01:20:08,962
When they made him
they broke the mold

968
01:20:09,003 --> 01:20:12,603
So charismatic
with an automatic

969
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:17,563
Never prematurely
shooting his load, ha

970
01:20:17,643 --> 01:20:19,603
Queen and country
safe and sound

971
01:20:19,643 --> 01:20:21,403
With villains
six feet underground

972
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:24,283
And no one knows 'cause
no one's found any trace

973
01:20:24,322 --> 01:20:26,683
Of a man for all seasons

974
01:20:26,763 --> 01:20:29,843
Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone

975
01:20:29,883 --> 01:20:32,603
So alone

976
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:34,403
And you and I
wouldn't have a clue

977
01:20:34,483 --> 01:20:36,483
Who's doin’ what, why
when and who

978
01:20:36,563 --> 01:20:38,323
Up a creek with no canoe

979
01:20:38,403 --> 01:20:41,563
Watch out for
the man for all seasons

980
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:44,563
Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone

981
01:20:44,603 --> 01:20:47,683
So alone
But safe at home

982
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:51,923
But safe at home
But safe at home

983
01:20:55,043 --> 01:20:56,723
Queen and country
safe and sound

984
01:20:56,763 --> 01:20:58,523
With villains

985
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:01,403

988
01:21:07,043 --> 01:21:09,723
So alone

989
01:21:09,803 --> 01:21:11,484
And you and I
wouldn't have a clue

990
01:21:11,563 --> 01:21:13,563
Who's doin’ what, why

Up a creek with no canoe

992

Watch out for

993
01:21:18,724 --> 01:21:21,683
Loves 'em

So alone
But safe at home

995

Queen and country
Safe and sound

01:21:28,364 --> 01:21:31,084
And no one knows 'cause

01:21:31,204 --> 01:21:33,564
Of a man for all seasons

999
01:21:33,603 --> 01:21:36,724
Loves 'em

1000
01:21:36,804 --> 01:21:39,483
So alone

But safe at home
