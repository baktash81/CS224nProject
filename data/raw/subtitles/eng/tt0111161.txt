00:00:55,301 --> 00:01:00,167
SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION

2
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,567
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

3
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,534
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

4
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,100
lt was very bitter.

5
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:22,867
She said she was glad l knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

6
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:27,067
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

7
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:30,733
-What was your response?
-l told her l would not grant one.

8
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:34,700
''l´ll see you in hell
before l see you in Reno.''

9
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,967
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

10
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:40,301
lf they say so.

11
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,201
l really don´t remember.
l was upset.

12
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:46,000
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

13
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,434
She packed a bag.

14
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:52,700
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

15
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:57,767
Glenn Quentin, golfpro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

16
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,201
...whom you had discovered
was your wife´s lover.

17
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,334
Did you follow her?

18
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,401
l went to a few bars first.

19
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:12,000
Later, l drove to his house
to confront them. They weren´t home.

20
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:13,800
l parked in the turnout...

21
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:15,434
...and waited.

22
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,067
With what intention?

23
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,134
I´m not sure.

24
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,733
I was confused, drunk.

25
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,434
I think...

26
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,700
...mostly I wanted to scare them.

27
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:30,900
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,501
l was sobering up.

29
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:37,201
l got back in the car
and l drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,367
Along the way, l threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,434
l´ve been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,401
l get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:48,833
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,267
...riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:56,267
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,800
Yes, it does.

37
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,867
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:03,501
...before the murders took place.

39
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,733
That´s very convenient.

40
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,800
lt´s the truth.

41
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:12,234
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:16,867
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,767
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:23,100
And that also...

45
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,067
...is very convenient.
lsn´t it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,700
Since l am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,967
...l find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:55,467
Ladies and gentlemen, you´ve heard
all the evidence.

49
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,700
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

50
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,134
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

51
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:05,201
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

52
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:06,900
And most of all...

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,434
...we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

54
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,767
...lying dead in each other´s arms.

55
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:15,501
They had sinned.

56
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,267
But was their crime so great...

57
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,334
...as to merit a death sentence?

58
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,401
While you think about that...

59
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,034
...think about this:

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,700
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,867
l submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:38,301
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:39,733
No.

64
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,267
This was revenge...

65
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:45,334
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:47,934
Four bullets per victim.

67
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:50,733
Not six shots fired, but eight.

68
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:55,267
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

69
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,867
...and then stopped to reload...

70
00:05:57,934 --> 00:06:01,167
...so that he could shoot
each of them again.

71
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:03,800
An extra bullet per lover...

72
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,934
...right in the head.

73
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:12,867
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,134
lt chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,733
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,700
...l hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:26,800
...one for each of your victims.
So be it!

78
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,267
Sit.

79
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:59,134
We see you´ve served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,100
-Yes, sir.
-You feel you´ve been rehabilitated?

81
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:05,367
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,767
l mean, l learned my lesson.

83
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:12,934
l can honestly say
that l´m a changed man.

84
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,367
l´m no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,167
That´s God´s honest truth.

86
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:27,267
ABORTED

87
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,833
Hey, Red.

88
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,201
How´d it go?

89
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,267
Same old shit, different day.

90
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,334
Yeah, l know how you feel.

91
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,467
l´m up for rejection next week.

92
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:07,700
Yeah, l got rejected last week.

93
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,034
lt happens.

94
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,267
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

95
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:14,234
Get out of my face, man!
You´re into me for five packs already.

96
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:15,867
Four!

97
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:19,833
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

98
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,800
I´m the guy who can get it for you.

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,967
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that´s your thing...

100
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:28,201
...bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid´s high school graduation.

101
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:30,367
Damn near anything within reason.

102
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,034
Yes, sir!
I´m a regular Sears and Roebuck.

103
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:40,201
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

104
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:43,767
...and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

105
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,934
...I told him, ''No problem. ''

106
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:27,934
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

107
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,967
...in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

108
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:36,100
On the outside, he´d been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

109
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:38,467
Good work for a man so young.

110
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,967
Hey, Red!

111
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,501
You speak English, butt-steak?

112
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,301
You follow this officer.

113
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:39,900
l never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

114
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,367
Hey, fish! Come over here!

115
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,467
Taking bets today, Red?

116
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,700
Smokes or coin? Bettor´s choice.

117
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,501
Smokes. Put me down for two.

118
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,034
All right, who´s your horse?

119
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:14,034
That little sack of shit.

120
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,401
-Eighth. He´ll be first.
-Bullshit! l´ll take that action.

121
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:21,000
You´re out some smokes, son.

122
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,900
lf you´re so smart, you call it.

123
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:27,234
l´ll take that chubby fat-ass there.

124
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,067
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

125
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:33,501
Fresh fish today!

126
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:36,267
We´re reeling them in!

127
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,067
I admit I didn´t think much ofAndy
first time I laid eyes on him.

128
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,234
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

129
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,401
That was my first impression of the man.

130
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:46,967
What do you say?

131
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,934
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

132
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,833
That guy? Never happen.

133
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:55,100
-1 0 cigarettes.
-That´s a rich bet.

134
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:56,900
Who´s going to prove me wrong?

135
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,833
Heywood? Jigger?

136
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,367
Skeets?

137
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,000
Floyd!

138
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,434
Four brave souls.

139
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:08,501
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

140
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,201
All prisoners,
return to your cellblocks.

141
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,234
Turn to the right!

142
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,000
Eyes front.

143
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,067
This is Mr. Hadley.
He´s captain of the guards.

144
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,134
l´m Mr. Norton, the warden.

145
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:52,301
You are convicted felons.

146
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:54,501
That´s why they´ve sent you to me.

147
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:56,401
Rule number one:

148
00:12:57,034 --> 00:12:58,401
No blasphemy.

149
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,134
l´ll not have the Lord´s name
taken in vain in my prison.

150
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:03,733
The other rules...

151
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:06,334
...you´ll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

152
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:08,934
When do we eat?

153
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,900
You eat when we say you eat.

154
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

155
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,434
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

156
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,034
On your feet.

157
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,800
l believe in two things:

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,867
Discipline and the Bible.

159
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:34,401
Here, you´ll receive both.

160
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,201
Put your trust in the Lord.

161
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,900
Your ass belongs to me.

162
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,700
Welcome to Shawshank.

163
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,467
Unhook them.

164
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,900
Turn around.

165
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:04,733
That´s enough.

166
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,700
Move to the end of the cage.

167
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,201
Turn around. Delouse him.

168
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,067
Turn around.

169
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:19,767
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

170
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,034
Next man up!

171
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:24,267
To the right.

172
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:26,067
Right. Right.

173
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,434
Left.

174
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,034
The first night´s the toughest.
No doubt about it.

175
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:34,900
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

176
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,967
...skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

177
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,934
And when they put you in that cell...

178
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:44,201
...and those bars slam home...

179
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:46,501
...that´s when you know it´s for real.

180
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:50,100
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

181
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:54,234
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

182
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:59,301
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

183
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:01,800
Somebody always breaks down crying.

184
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,067
Happens every time.

185
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,767
The only question is...

186
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:08,833
...who´s it going to be?

187
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,800
It´s as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

188
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,067
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

189
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,301
Lights out!

190
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,301
I remember my first night.

191
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:51,733
Seems like a long time ago.

192
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:56,800
Hey, fish.

193
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,434
Fish, fish.

194
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,334
What are you, scared of the dark?

195
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,733
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

196
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,167
Piggy! Pork!
l want me a pork chop.

197
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:22,067
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

198
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:25,134
And they don´t quit
till they reel someone in.

199
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:27,934
Hey, Fat Ass.

200
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,134
Fat Ass!

201
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,833
Talk to me, boy.

202
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,167
l know you´re there.
l can hear you breathing.

203
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:39,867
Don´t you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

204
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:42,034
This place ain´t so bad.

205
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,501
Tell you what...

206
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,401
...l´ll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

207
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:52,000
l know a couple of
big old bull queers that´d just...

208
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,501
...love to make your acquaintance.

209
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,900
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

210
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,467
God!

211
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,867
l don´t belong here!

212
00:17:01,134 --> 00:17:03,334
-We have a winner!
-l want to go home!

213
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,867
And it´s Fat Ass by a nose!

214
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:12,367
Fresh fish!

215
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,733
l want to go home!

216
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,367
l want my mother!

217
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,201
l had your mother!
She wasn´t that great!

218
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,700
What the Christ is this horseshit?

219
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,900
He blasphemed. l´ll tell the warden.

220
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,934
You´ll tell him
with my baton up your ass!

221
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,100
Let me out!

222
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:37,301
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

223
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,900
Please! l ain´t supposed to be here.

224
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:42,100
Not me!

225
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:44,501
l won´t count to three.
Not even to one.

226
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,967
You shut up,
or l´ll sing you a lullaby!

227
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,000
Shut up, man. Shut up!

228
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,100
You don´t understand.
l´m not supposed to be here.

229
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:54,234
Open that cell.

230
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,700
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

231
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,934
Son of a bitch!

232
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,733
Captain, take it easy!

233
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:38,700
lf l hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

234
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,267
...l swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

235
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,434
Every last motherfucker in here.

236
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:51,201
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

237
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:09,501
His first night in thejoint, Dufresne
cost me two packs of cigarettes.

238
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:12,434
He never made a sound.

239
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,934
Tier 3 north, clear count!

240
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,867
Tier 2 north, clear count.

241
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:34,201
Tier 3 south, clear.

242
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,134
Prepare to roll out.

243
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:45,833
Roll out!

244
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,934
Are you going to eat that?

245
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,267
l hadn´t planned on it.

246
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,167
Do you mind?

247
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:55,267
That´s nice and ripe.

248
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,501
Jake says thank you.

249
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:11,267
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

250
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,434
l´m going to look after him
until he´s big enough to fly.

251
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:19,100
Oh, no! Here he comes.

252
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,267
Morning, fellas.

253
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:25,067
Fine morning, isn´t it?

254
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,934
You know why it´s a fine morning,
don´t you?

255
00:21:28,034 --> 00:21:30,833
Send them down.
l want them lined up...

256
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:32,800
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

257
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,434
Look at that.

258
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,401
-l can´t stand this guy.
-Oh, Lord!

259
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:41,867
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

260
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,401
Smell my ass!

261
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:45,134
After he smells mine.

262
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:49,167
That´s a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

263
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:52,733
But l sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

264
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:56,067
l owe that boy a big kiss
when l see him.

265
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,334
Why don´t you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

266
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:01,134
Hey, Tyrell.

267
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,733
You pull infirmary duty this week?

268
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:06,100
How´s my horse doing anyway?

269
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:07,700
Dead.

270
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,501
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

271
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:13,134
Doc had gone home for the night.

272
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,467
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

273
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,700
By then, there wasn´t nothing
we could do.

274
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:25,201
What was his name?

275
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:29,800
What´d you say?

276
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,501
l was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

277
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:36,833
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

278
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,800
Doesn´t fucking matter
what his name was. He´s dead.

279
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:03,733
Anybody come at you yet?

280
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,934
Anybody get to you yet?

281
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,767
Hey, we all need friends in here.

282
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:13,833
l could be a friend to you.

283
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,167
Hard to get.

284
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,334
l like that.

285
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,967
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

286
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:39,867
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

287
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:42,434
...trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

288
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:46,301
Wasn´t until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

289
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:48,833
...to say more than two words
to somebody.

290
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,800
As it turned out...

291
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,767
...that somebody was me.

292
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,334
l´m Andy Dufresne.

293
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:06,733
Wife-killing banker.

294
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,934
Why´d you do it?

295
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,100
l didn´t, since you ask.

296
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,800
You´re going to fit right in.

297
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,733
Everybody in here´s innocent.
Didn´t you know that?

298
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,234
-What you in here for?
-Didn´t do it. Lawyer fucked me.

299
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:26,401
Rumor has it you´re a real cold fish.

300
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,034
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. ls that right?

301
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:32,000
What do you think?

302
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:35,000
To tell you the truth,
l haven´t made up my mind.

303
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,767
l understand you´re a man
that knows how to get things.

304
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:42,733
l´m known to locate certain things
from time to time.

305
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:46,067
l wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

306
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:47,867
A rock hammer.

307
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,501
-What is it and why?
-What do you care?

308
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:55,000
For a toothbrush, l wouldn´t ask.
l´d quote a price.

309
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,700
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn´t it?

310
00:24:58,334 --> 00:24:59,867
Fair enough.

311
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:03,267
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

312
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,334
-Looks like a miniature pickax.
-Pickax?

313
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,234
For rocks.

314
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:10,301
Quartz?

315
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And some mica, shale...

316
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,067
...limestone.

317
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:21,434
So?

318
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,867
So l´m a rock hound.

319
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:27,434
At least l was in my old life.
l´d like to be again.

320
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,167
Or maybe you´d like to sink your toy
into somebody´s skull.

321
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:33,234
No, l have no enemies here.

322
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:35,934
No? Wait a while.

323
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,733
Word gets around.

324
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,900
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

325
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,434
Especially Bogs.

326
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:49,301
Don´t suppose it would help if l
told them l´m not homosexual.

327
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:51,000
Neither are they.

328
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,434
You have to be human first.
They don´t qualify.

329
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:02,401
Bull queers take by force.
That´s all they want or understand.

330
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:06,367
lf l were you, l´d grow eyes
in the back of my head.

331
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:09,000
-Thanks for the advice.
-Well, that´s free.

332
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,334
You understand my concern.

333
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:14,833
lf there´s trouble,
l won´t use the rock hammer.

334
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:19,000
Then l´d guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

335
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,867
What did l miss?
What´s so funny?

336
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:24,867
You´ll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

337
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:28,201
What´s an item like this usually go for?

338
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:30,767
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

339
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:33,733
My normal markup´s 20 percent.

340
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,934
But this is a specialty item.

341
00:26:36,301 --> 00:26:40,267
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let´s make it an even 1 0 bucks.

342
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,401
Ten it is.

343
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,800
Waste of money, if you ask me.

344
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,800
Why´s that?

345
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,267
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

346
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
They find it, you´re going to lose it.

347
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:57,401
lf they catch you, you don´t know me.

348
00:26:57,501 --> 00:27:00,034
Mention my name, we never
do business again.

349
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,800
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

350
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:05,267
l understand.

351
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:08,334
Thank you, Mr....

352
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,833
Red.

353
00:27:10,134 --> 00:27:11,934
Name´s Red.

354
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,700
Why do they call you that?

355
00:27:18,134 --> 00:27:20,134
Maybe it´s because l´m lrish.

356
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:30,900
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

357
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,000
He had a quiet way about him...

358
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,800
...a walk and a talk thatjust
wasn´t normal around here.

359
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:39,867
He strolled...

360
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:43,800
...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

361
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:48,167
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

362
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,167
I think it´d be fair to say...

363
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,833
...I liked Andy from the start.

364
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,967
Let´s go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

365
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,401
Move it! Come on, move it!

366
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
How you doing?
How´s the wife treating you?

367
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,201
Andy was right.

368
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:51,301
I finally got thejoke.

369
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:54,267
It would take a man about 600 years...

370
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,434
...to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

371
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:02,201
-Book?
-Not today.

372
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:09,501
Book?

373
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:18,000
Delivery for Dufresne.

374
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:36,934
Here´s your book.

375
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,000
Thanks.

376
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:52,100
We´re running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

377
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:30,134
This will blind you.

378
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:32,767
Honey, hush.

379
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,733
That´s it. You fight!

380
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,100
Better that way.

381
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:59,000
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

382
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,167
...and the Sisters let him be.

383
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:03,434
I wish I could tell you that...

384
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:06,267
...but prison is no fairy-tale world.

385
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:09,434
He never said who did it.

386
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,401
But we all knew.

387
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:18,267
Things went on like that for a while.

388
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,867
Prison life consists of routine...

389
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:23,034
...and then more routine.

390
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:28,800
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

391
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:32,234
The Sisters kept at him.

392
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:34,401
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

393
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,201
Sometimes not.

394
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,167
And that´s how it went for Andy.

395
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:41,700
That was his routine.

396
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,301
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

397
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:49,100
And I also believe that
if things had gone on that way...

398
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,800
...this place would have
got the best of him.

399
00:31:52,434 --> 00:31:55,134
But then, in the spring of 1949...

400
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:57,401
...the powers that be decided:

401
00:31:57,467 --> 00:32:00,467
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

402
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,700
l need a dozen volunteers
for a week´s work.

403
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:05,767
As you know...

404
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:09,467
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

405
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:12,434
It was outdoor detail...

406
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:16,867
...and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

407
00:32:17,134 --> 00:32:18,700
Stay in line there.

408
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:21,767
More than a hundred men
volunteered for thejob.

409
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Wallace E. Unger.

410
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:31,067
Ellis Redding.

411
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,234
Wouldn´t you know it?

412
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:36,900
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

413
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,000
Andrew Dufresne.

414
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,967
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

415
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:45,034
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

416
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:48,367
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

417
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,167
l say, ''Yeah?''

418
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:53,867
He says, ''Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died.''

419
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,067
-l´m sorry to hear that.
-l´m not. He was an asshole.

420
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:00,800
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

421
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,700
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

422
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,833
''He died a rich man.'' Oil wells
and shit. Close to a million bucks.

423
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:08,833
A million bucks?

424
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:13,434
-lncredible how lucky some assholes get.
-You going to see any of that?

425
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:16,501
Thirty-five thousand.
That´s what he left me.

426
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:18,501
Dollars?

427
00:33:19,034 --> 00:33:21,800
That´s great! That´s like
winning the sweepstakes.

428
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,367
lsn´t it?

429
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,234
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

430
00:33:26,434 --> 00:33:29,134
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

431
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:31,100
Poor Byron.

432
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,833
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

433
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:38,900
Andy, are you nuts?

434
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,067
lKeep your eyes on your mop, man!

435
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,134
You´ll pay some tax,
but you´ll still end up--

436
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:46,934
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

437
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:49,100
l got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

438
00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:52,867
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

439
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:56,434
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

440
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,833
l tell you! Uncle Sam!

441
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,267
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it´s purple.

442
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,401
-Getting himself killed.
-lKeep tarring.

443
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:09,934
Some brother.
Shit!

444
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:16,067
Mr. Hadley...

445
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:18,700
...do you trust your wife?

446
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,234
Oh, that´s funny.

447
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,434
You´ll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

448
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,967
What l mean is, do you think
she´d go behind your back?

449
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,234
Step aside, Mert. This fucker´s
having himself an accident.

450
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:33,367
He´ll push him off!

451
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:35,201
lf you trust her, you can keep...

452
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:36,833
...that 35,000.

453
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:40,700
-What did you say?
-Thirty-five thousand.

454
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,967
All of it.

455
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:45,100
-Every penny.
-You better start making sense.

456
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,401
lf you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

457
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:51,700
The lRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

458
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,134
-Bullshit. Tax-free?
-Tax-free.

459
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:56,100
lRS can´t touch one cent.

460
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:58,867
You´re that smart banker
that killed his wife.

461
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:02,234
Why should l believe you?
So l can end up in here with you?

462
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:05,201
lt´s legal. Ask the lRS.
They´ll say the same thing.

463
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:08,501
l feel stupid telling you this.
l´m sure you would have investigated.

464
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:12,800
l don´t need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

465
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,301
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

466
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,000
That´ll cost you. A lawyer.

467
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:19,934
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

468
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:24,067
l suppose l could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

469
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,234
You get the forms, l´ll prepare them...

470
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,234
...nearly free of charge.

471
00:35:29,034 --> 00:35:32,900
l´d only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

472
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:35,700
''Coworkers.'' That´s rich!

473
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,067
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

474
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:41,301
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That´s only my opinion...

475
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:43,234
...sir.

476
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,067
What are you jimmies staring at?

477
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:50,134
Let´s go! Work!

478
00:35:59,301 --> 00:36:01,334
And that´s how it came to pass...

479
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:04,301
...that on the second-to-last
day of thejob...

480
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:08,700
...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of ´49...

481
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,767
...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

482
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:17,367
...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

483
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:20,434
...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

484
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,967
Drink up while it´s cold, ladies.

485
00:36:24,134 --> 00:36:28,100
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

486
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,034
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

487
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:37,733
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

488
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:40,100
We were the lords of all creation.

489
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,301
As for Andy...

490
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,334
...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

491
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:47,900
...a strange little smile on his face...

492
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:50,134
...watching us drink his beer.

493
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:59,800
Want a cold one?

494
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,134
No, thanks. l gave up drinking.

495
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:10,100
You could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards.

496
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:13,467
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

497
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:15,867
Me?

498
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,501
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

499
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,501
...if only for a short while.

500
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:24,800
lKing me.

501
00:37:26,267 --> 00:37:29,034
-Chess. Now there´s a game of kings.
-What?

502
00:37:29,134 --> 00:37:31,301
Civilized. Strategic.

503
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:34,201
And a total fucking mystery.
l hate it.

504
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:36,267
Let me teach you someday.

505
00:37:37,934 --> 00:37:39,000
Sure.

506
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:41,267
We could get a board together.

507
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,234
You´re talking to the right man.
l can get things, right?

508
00:37:44,434 --> 00:37:48,201
We might do business on a board,
and l´ll carve the pieces myself.

509
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:51,900
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

510
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,434
l think it´ll take years.

511
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,134
Years l got.
What l don´t have are the rocks.

512
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,134
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

513
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,034
Pebbles, mostly.

514
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,434
We´re getting to be
kind of friends, aren´t we?

515
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:09,034
Yeah, l guess.

516
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:11,100
Can l ask you something?

517
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:14,034
Why´d you do it?

518
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:16,467
l´m innocent, Red.

519
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:18,733
Just like everybody else here.

520
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,401
What are you in for?

521
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:28,967
Murder. Same as you.

522
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:30,700
lnnocent?

523
00:38:32,967 --> 00:38:35,134
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

524
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:33,467
Where´s the canary?

525
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,100
How did you know?

526
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:37,700
-How did I know what?
-So you don´t know.

527
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,867
Come.

528
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:42,900
This is where the canary is.

529
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,833
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

530
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:54,000
That´s quite a...

531
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,967
...surprise.

532
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:01,401
Wait, wait.

533
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,267
Here she comes.

534
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,833
l like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

535
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,367
l know. l´ve seen it
three times this month.

536
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,434
Gilda, are you decent?

537
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:13,467
Me?

538
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:17,700
God, l love it.

539
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:25,867
l understand you´re a man
that knows how to get things.

540
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:30,267
l´m known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

541
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:32,700
-Rita Hayworth.
-What?

542
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:34,334
Can you get her?

543
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:39,201
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I´ve heard a lot about you.

544
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:42,100
-Take a few weeks.
-Weeks?

545
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:46,201
l don´t have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

546
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:48,800
But l´ll get her.

547
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,167
Relax.

548
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:52,867
Thanks.

549
00:41:12,934 --> 00:41:14,733
-Get out!
-l got to change reels!

550
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:16,234
l said fuck off!

551
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:23,833
Ain´t you going to scream?

552
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:26,900
Let´s get this over with.

553
00:41:32,234 --> 00:41:33,900
He broke my fucking nose!

554
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,267
Now...

555
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,434
...l´m going to open my fly...

556
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:49,833
...and you´ll swallow
what l give you to swallow.

557
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:53,733
Then you´ll swallow Rooster´s.
You broke his nose.

558
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,434
He ought to have
something to show for it.

559
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,434
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

560
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,034
No, you don´t understand.

561
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:03,201
Do that and l´ll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

562
00:42:03,301 --> 00:42:06,733
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

563
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:09,767
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

564
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:12,800
ln fact, l hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

565
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:15,401
...they have to pry
the victim´s jaws open...

566
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:17,401
...with a crowbar.

567
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:21,100
Where do you get this shit?

568
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:22,900
l read it.

569
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:26,501
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

570
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:29,301
Honey!

571
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:32,234
You shouldn´t!

572
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:38,000
Bogs didn´t put anything
in Andy´s mouth.

573
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,434
And neither did his friends.

574
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,867
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

575
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:47,100
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

576
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:50,434
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

577
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:56,034
Time´s up, Bogs.

578
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:01,167
lt´s your world, boss.

579
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:06,967
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

580
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:09,434
All prisoners report for lock down.

581
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,201
What?

582
00:43:37,301 --> 00:43:39,967
-Where´s he going?
-Grab his ankles.

583
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:47,067
Help!

584
00:43:50,201 --> 00:43:52,434
Two things never happened again
after that.

585
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:55,767
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

586
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:58,467
And Bogs would never walk again.

587
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,334
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

588
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:05,867
To my knowledge, he lived out
the rest of his days...

589
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,201
...drinking his food through a straw.

590
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:12,900
Andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary.

591
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:16,134
Sounds good to us.

592
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:18,934
l figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

593
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:21,267
The man likes to play chess.

594
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:23,934
Let´s get him some rocks.

595
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,334
Guys!

596
00:44:57,434 --> 00:44:58,867
l got one.

597
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:00,501
l got one. Look!

598
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:05,467
Heywood, that isn´t soapstone!
And it ain´t alabaster either.

599
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:07,900
What are you, a fucking geologist?

600
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,733
He´s right. lt ain´t.

601
00:45:09,934 --> 00:45:12,700
-What the hell is it then?
-lt´s a horse apple.

602
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:16,000
-Bullshit!
-No, horseshit.

603
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,467
Petrified.

604
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:24,700
Damn!

605
00:45:27,501 --> 00:45:31,334
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

606
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:34,034
And by the weekend
he was due back...

607
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:37,301
...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

608
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:40,700
Also got a big shipment in that week.

609
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,067
Cigarettes...

610
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:43,301
...chewing gum...

611
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,800
...sipping whisky...

612
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,267
...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

613
00:45:48,334 --> 00:45:51,034
And of course, the most important item:

614
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,767
Rita Hayworth herself.

615
00:46:17,134 --> 00:46:19,833
WELCOME BACK

616
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,767
Heads up.
They´re tossing cells.

617
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:35,301
Heads up.
They´re tossing cells!

618
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:38,067
1 1 9.

619
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,900
1 23.

620
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,067
On your feet.

621
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,167
Face the wall.

622
00:47:29,267 --> 00:47:30,800
Turn around and face the warden.

623
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:39,000
Pleased to see you reading this.

624
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,967
Any favorite passages?

625
00:47:43,234 --> 00:47:45,934
''Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

626
00:47:46,034 --> 00:47:48,034
...when the master
of the house cometh.''

627
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:50,867
Mark 1 3:35.

628
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:53,201
l´ve always liked that one.

629
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:55,967
But l prefer...

630
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:58,301
...''l am the light of the world.

631
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,267
Ye that followeth me

632
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:02,434
shall have the light of life.''

633
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:04,434
John, chapter 8, verse 1 2.

634
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:06,434
l hear you´re good with numbers.

635
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:09,267
How nice.

636
00:48:09,501 --> 00:48:11,367
Man should have a skill.

637
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,067
Explain this.

638
00:48:15,867 --> 00:48:19,167
lt´s called a rock blanket.
lt´s for shaping and polishing rocks.

639
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,867
A little hobby of mine.

640
00:48:32,267 --> 00:48:33,434
lt´s pretty clean.

641
00:48:33,967 --> 00:48:36,301
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

642
00:48:41,267 --> 00:48:43,100
l can´t say l approve of this.

643
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:46,167
But l suppose...

644
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,700
...exceptions can be made.

645
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:00,967
Lock them up!

646
00:49:03,934 --> 00:49:05,201
l almost forgot.

647
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,367
l´d hate to deprive you of this.

648
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:10,067
Salvation lies within.

649
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,767
Yes, sir.

650
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:22,100
Tossing cells wasjust an excuse.

651
00:49:22,733 --> 00:49:24,201
Truth is...

652
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:26,367
...Norton wanted to size Andy up.

653
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,934
My wife made that in church group.

654
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:46,034
Very nice, sir.

655
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:49,267
You enjoy working the laundry?

656
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:51,867
No, sir. Not especially.

657
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:54,267
Perhaps we can find something more...

658
00:49:54,434 --> 00:49:56,767
...befitting a man of your education.

659
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,334
Hey, Jake.
Where´s Brooks?

660
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:10,034
l thought l heard you out here.

661
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:12,833
l´ve been reassigned to you.

662
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,900
l know, they told me.

663
00:50:16,067 --> 00:50:17,867
Ain´t that a kick in the head?

664
00:50:18,067 --> 00:50:20,100
Well, l´ll give you the dime tour.

665
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:21,700
Come on.

666
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,434
Well, here she is.

667
00:50:24,867 --> 00:50:27,034
The Shawshank Prison Library.

668
00:50:27,134 --> 00:50:29,000
National Geographics...

669
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:32,501
... Reader´s Digest condensed books...

670
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:34,334
...and Louis L´Amour.

671
00:50:35,234 --> 00:50:36,934
Look magazine.

672
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,201
Erle Stanley Gardners.

673
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,900
Every evening l load up the cart
and make my rounds.

674
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:45,833
l enter the names
on this clipboard here.

675
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:48,700
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

676
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:52,867
-Any questions?
-How long have you been librarian?

677
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:58,000
l come here in ´05,
and they made me librarian in 1 9 1 2.

678
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:00,800
And have you ever had an assistant?

679
00:51:00,967 --> 00:51:03,867
No. Not much to it, really.

680
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:05,501
Why me? Why now?

681
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:07,000
l don´t know.

682
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:10,067
But it´d be nice to have
some company down here.

683
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:22,800
That´s him.
That´s the one.

684
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:31,501
l´m Dekins.

685
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:34,467
l was thinking...

686
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:38,367
...about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids´ educations.

687
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:42,934
l see.

688
00:51:47,934 --> 00:51:50,301
Why don´t we have a seat
and talk it over.

689
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:55,934
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

690
00:52:07,767 --> 00:52:08,867
Thanks.

691
00:52:09,401 --> 00:52:10,767
So....

692
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:13,301
Mister Dekins....

693
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:16,900
And then Andy says, ''Mr. Dekins...

694
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,000
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?''

695
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,467
He didn´t say that!

696
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,167
As God as my witness!

697
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:25,867
Dekins blinked for a second...

698
00:52:25,967 --> 00:52:29,401
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy´s hand.

699
00:52:29,467 --> 00:52:31,800
-My ass!
-Shook his hand.

700
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:35,334
l tell you, l near soiled myself!

701
00:52:35,434 --> 00:52:39,301
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

702
00:52:39,401 --> 00:52:42,100
...he´d have been
''Mr. Dufresne,'' if you please.

703
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,934
Making a few friends?

704
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:46,100
l wouldn´t say ''friends.''

705
00:52:46,301 --> 00:52:50,067
l´m a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

706
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,967
lt´s a wonderful pet to have.

707
00:52:52,434 --> 00:52:54,501
Got you out of the laundry, though.

708
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,833
lt might do more than that.

709
00:52:56,934 --> 00:52:59,800
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

710
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,434
lf you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

711
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,267
How do you expect to do that?
l mean...

712
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,867
...get new books in here,
''Mr. Dufresne, if you please.''

713
00:53:10,034 --> 00:53:11,767
l´ll ask the warden for funds.

714
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,067
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and l´ve learned...

715
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:19,234
...one immutable, universal truth:

716
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:21,234
Not one born whose asshole...

717
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:25,067
...wouldn´t pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

718
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:29,167
-The budget´s stretched thin as it is.
-l see.

719
00:53:29,434 --> 00:53:33,034
Maybe l could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

720
00:53:33,234 --> 00:53:37,201
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers´ money for prisons:

721
00:53:37,367 --> 00:53:39,900
More walls, more bars, more guards.

722
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,967
l´d like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

723
00:53:43,134 --> 00:53:45,334
-They can´t ignore me forever.
-Sure can.

724
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:48,034
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

725
00:53:48,234 --> 00:53:50,301
l´ll even mail them for you.
How´s that?

726
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:55,034
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

727
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:57,034
...just like he said.

728
00:54:00,934 --> 00:54:03,201
And like Norton said...

729
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:05,167
...Andy got no answers.

730
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,301
The following April, he did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

731
00:54:18,934 --> 00:54:21,134
Year after that, he did them all...

732
00:54:21,234 --> 00:54:23,034
...including the warden´s.

733
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:28,134
Year after that, they
rescheduled the intramural season...

734
00:54:28,301 --> 00:54:30,401
...to coincide with tax season.

735
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:36,201
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

736
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:38,100
So Moresby Prison...

737
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:40,434
...issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

738
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,134
Right. The holster too.

739
00:54:42,234 --> 00:54:44,767
That´s tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

740
00:54:44,934 --> 00:54:48,100
Yes, sir!
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

741
00:54:48,267 --> 00:54:52,700
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

742
00:54:52,967 --> 00:54:55,367
Could you hand me
a stack of 1 040s?

743
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,867
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

744
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:03,934
And still, he kept
sending those letters.

745
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:12,034
lt´s Brooks.

746
00:55:13,301 --> 00:55:14,401
Watch the door.

747
00:55:14,934 --> 00:55:16,733
Please, Brooks.

748
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,800
-Calm the fuck down.
-Stay back!

749
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,434
-Stay back, goddamn it!
-What´s going on?

750
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,134
One second he´s fine,
then out come the knives.

751
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:25,833
We can talk about this, right?

752
00:55:25,934 --> 00:55:29,367
There´s nothing to talk about.
l´ll cut his fucking throat.

753
00:55:29,434 --> 00:55:31,167
What´s he done to you?

754
00:55:31,234 --> 00:55:33,034
lt´s what they done!

755
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:35,401
l got no choice.

756
00:55:35,501 --> 00:55:38,100
You won´t hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

757
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,833
-Right, Heywood?
-Sure.

758
00:55:40,934 --> 00:55:43,467
He´s a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

759
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:45,267
Right, guys?

760
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,234
So put the knife down.
Look at me.

761
00:55:48,434 --> 00:55:50,234
Put the knife down.

762
00:55:52,301 --> 00:55:54,201
Look at his neck, for God´s sake.

763
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,034
Look at his neck. He´s bleeding.

764
00:55:57,934 --> 00:56:00,367
lt´s the only way...

765
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:02,067
...they´d let me stay.

766
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,334
This is crazy.
You don´t want to do this.

767
00:56:04,434 --> 00:56:06,467
Put it, put it down.

768
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:16,733
Take it easy.

769
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,267
You´ll be all right.

770
00:56:18,434 --> 00:56:20,767
Him? What about me?

771
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:23,501
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

772
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,467
You´ve had worse from shaving.

773
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,267
What did you do to set him off?

774
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:30,267
Nothing.
l come in here to say farewell.

775
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:32,967
Ain´t you heard?
His parole´s come through.

776
00:56:35,301 --> 00:56:38,000
l just don´t understand
what happened in there.

777
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:40,800
Old man´s crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

778
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,767
That´s enough out of you.

779
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:45,934
-Heard he had you shitting your pants.
-Fuck you.

780
00:56:46,034 --> 00:56:47,467
lKnock it off.

781
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,000
Brooks ain´t no bug.

782
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:55,234
He´s just institutionalized.

783
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:58,334
''lnstitutionalized,'' my ass.

784
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:02,134
The man´s been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

785
00:57:02,234 --> 00:57:03,934
This is all he knows.

786
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:06,267
ln here, he´s an important man...

787
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:08,267
...an educated man.

788
00:57:08,367 --> 00:57:10,234
Outside, he´s nothing.

789
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:13,833
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

790
00:57:14,401 --> 00:57:17,267
Probably couldn´t get a library card
if he tried.

791
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:19,267
You know what l´m trying to say?

792
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:22,800
l do believe
you´re talking out of your ass.

793
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,700
You believe whatever you want.

794
00:57:25,867 --> 00:57:28,501
But l tell you these walls are funny.

795
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:31,467
First you hate them.

796
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:35,367
Then you get used to them.

797
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,134
Enough time passes...

798
00:57:39,867 --> 00:57:41,934
...you get so you depend on them.

799
00:57:42,733 --> 00:57:44,733
That´s ''institutionalized.''

800
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,267
Shit.

801
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:48,967
-l could never get like that.
-Oh, yeah?

802
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,201
Wait till you´ve been here
as long as Brooks.

803
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:53,934
Goddamn right.

804
00:57:56,401 --> 00:57:58,401
They send you here for life...

805
00:57:59,034 --> 00:58:01,100
...that´s exactly what they take.

806
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,967
Part that counts, anyway.

807
00:58:12,234 --> 00:58:14,401
l can´t take care of you no more, Jake.

808
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,367
You go on now.

809
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,167
You´re free.

810
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,900
You´re free.

811
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:42,934
Good luck, Brooksie.

812
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:20,833
Dear fellas:

813
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:25,167
I can´t believe how fast things move
on the outside.

814
00:59:26,334 --> 00:59:28,434
Watch it, old-timer!
Want to get killed?

815
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:33,367
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

816
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,267
...but now they´re everywhere.

817
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,334
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

818
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:03,100
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

819
01:00:03,234 --> 01:00:04,833
...called ''The Brewer''...

820
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,201
...and a job...

821
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,934
...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

822
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:13,234
It´s hard work and I try to keep up...

823
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,833
...but my hands hurt most of the time.

824
01:00:15,934 --> 01:00:17,733
Make sure your man double-bags.

825
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:20,700
Last time, the bottom near came out.

826
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,434
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

827
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:24,867
Yes, sir. Surely will.

828
01:00:24,934 --> 01:00:28,167
I don´t think the store manager
likes me very much.

829
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:35,334
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

830
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:37,201
I keep thinking...

831
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:40,367
...Jake mightjust show up
and say hello.

832
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,800
But he never does.

833
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:48,700
I hope, wherever he is, he´s doing okay
and making new friends.

834
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:54,501
I have trouble sleeping at night.

835
01:00:55,201 --> 01:00:58,100
I have bad dreams like I´m falling.

836
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,067
I wake up scared.

837
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:05,134
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

838
01:01:06,401 --> 01:01:11,434
Maybe I should get a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they´d send me home.

839
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:16,034
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

840
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:20,833
I guess I´m too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

841
01:01:21,301 --> 01:01:23,100
I don´t like it here.

842
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:26,967
I´m tired of being afraid all the time.
I´ve decided...

843
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,234
...not to stay.

844
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:42,301
I doubt they´ll kick up any fuss...

845
01:01:42,467 --> 01:01:45,234
...not for an old crook like me.

846
01:02:30,267 --> 01:02:36,267
BROOKS WAS HERE

847
01:02:45,867 --> 01:02:49,301
''l doubt they´ll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

848
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:54,434
P.S. Tell Heywood l´m sorry
l put a knife to his throat.

849
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,401
No hard feelings. Brooks.''

850
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:08,767
He should have died in here.

851
01:03:14,134 --> 01:03:15,767
What the fuck have you done?

852
01:03:15,867 --> 01:03:18,034
lt´s a goddamn mess,
l´ll tell you that.

853
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,900
-What´s all this?
-You tell me. They´re addressed to you.

854
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:29,301
Take it.

855
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,700
''Dear Mr. Dufresne:

856
01:03:40,334 --> 01:03:42,767
ln response to your inquiries...

857
01:03:42,867 --> 01:03:46,167
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project.''

858
01:03:47,334 --> 01:03:48,934
This is $200.

859
01:03:49,301 --> 01:03:53,733
''ln addition, the library district
has generously responded...

860
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,267
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

861
01:03:56,334 --> 01:03:59,934
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

862
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:02,201
Please stop sending us letters.''

863
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:04,934
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

864
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:06,301
Yes, sir.

865
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,434
Good for you, Andy.

866
01:04:13,867 --> 01:04:15,134
Wow!

867
01:04:16,234 --> 01:04:17,833
lt only took six years.

868
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:22,401
From now on, l´ll write two
letters a week instead of one.

869
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:25,100
l believe you´re crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

870
01:04:25,301 --> 01:04:26,900
...like he said.

871
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,434
l´ve got to pinch a loaf.

872
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,967
When l come back...

873
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,867
...this is all gone, all right?

874
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:19,401
Do you hear that?

875
01:06:25,967 --> 01:06:28,301
Dufresne!

876
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:30,934
Andy, let me out!

877
01:06:37,334 --> 01:06:41,934
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

878
01:06:42,301 --> 01:06:44,767
Truth is, I don´t want to know.

879
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,167
Some things are best left unsaid.

880
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:53,201
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

881
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,700
...it can´t be expressed in words...

882
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,301
...and makes your heart ache
because of it.

883
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,267
I tell you, those voices soared...

884
01:07:03,334 --> 01:07:07,067
...higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

885
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:10,334
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

886
01:07:10,434 --> 01:07:13,134
...and made those walls dissolve away.

887
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:15,733
And for the briefest of moments...

888
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,700
...every last man at Shawshank
felt free.

889
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:23,401
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

890
01:07:24,934 --> 01:07:26,201
Open the door.

891
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,067
Open it up!

892
01:07:31,767 --> 01:07:33,767
Dufresne, open this door!

893
01:07:35,401 --> 01:07:36,733
Turn that off!

894
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:46,067
l am warning you. Turn that off!

895
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,167
You´re mine now.

896
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:14,067
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

897
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,967
On your feet.

898
01:08:17,401 --> 01:08:20,034
-Hey, look who´s here.
-Maestro!

899
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,167
You couldn´t play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

900
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,867
They broke the door down
before l could take requests.

901
01:08:28,034 --> 01:08:31,301
-Was it worth two weeks?
-Easiest time l ever did.

902
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:35,700
-No such thing as easy time in the hole.
-A week in the hole is like a year.

903
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,501
-Damn straight.
-l had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

904
01:08:38,867 --> 01:08:41,501
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

905
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,334
lt was in here.

906
01:08:46,234 --> 01:08:47,301
ln here.

907
01:08:48,401 --> 01:08:50,367
That´s the beauty of music. They...

908
01:08:50,733 --> 01:08:52,900
...can´t get that from you.

909
01:08:56,234 --> 01:08:58,733
Haven´t you ever felt
that way about music?

910
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:03,434
Well, l played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

911
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:06,234
Lost interest in it, though.

912
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,134
Didn´t make much sense in here.

913
01:09:08,234 --> 01:09:10,234
Here´s where it makes the most sense.

914
01:09:10,334 --> 01:09:12,334
You need it so you don´t forget.

915
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:14,034
Forget?

916
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:16,467
Forget that there are...

917
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:19,134
...places...

918
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:22,134
...in the world
that aren´t made out of stone.

919
01:09:22,234 --> 01:09:25,000
There´s something...

920
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,434
...inside...

921
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:29,501
...that they can´t get to...

922
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:31,401
...that they can´t touch.

923
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,100
That´s yours.

924
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,367
What are you talking about?

925
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,167
Hope.

926
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:40,334
Hope.

927
01:09:41,934 --> 01:09:43,733
Let me tell you something, my friend.

928
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:46,700
Hope is a dangerous thing.

929
01:09:48,034 --> 01:09:50,733
Hope can drive a man insane.

930
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,067
lt´s got no use on the inside.

931
01:09:53,267 --> 01:09:55,067
You´d better get used to that idea.

932
01:09:58,067 --> 01:09:59,700
Like Brooks did?

933
01:10:23,234 --> 01:10:24,767
Sit down.

934
01:10:29,733 --> 01:10:33,067
Says here that you´ve served
30 years of a life sentence.

935
01:10:33,867 --> 01:10:35,767
You feel you´ve been rehabilitated?

936
01:10:36,134 --> 01:10:37,401
Oh, yes, sir.

937
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:39,733
Without a doubt.

938
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,967
l can honestly say l´m a changed man.

939
01:10:45,067 --> 01:10:46,867
No danger to society here.

940
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:48,733
God´s honest truth.

941
01:10:51,267 --> 01:10:52,900
Absolutely rehabilitated.

942
01:10:57,434 --> 01:10:58,767
ABORTED

943
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,900
Thirty years.

944
01:11:06,234 --> 01:11:08,234
Jesus, when you say it like that....

945
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,867
You wonder where it went.

946
01:11:13,034 --> 01:11:15,201
l wonder where 1 0 years went.

947
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,900
Here.

948
01:11:21,167 --> 01:11:23,434
A little parole rejection present.

949
01:11:25,034 --> 01:11:26,501
Go ahead and open it.

950
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,800
Went through one of your competitors.

951
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:33,301
l hope you don´t mind.
l wanted it to be a surprise.

952
01:11:42,401 --> 01:11:43,833
lt´s very pretty.

953
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:46,867
Thank you.

954
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,301
You going to play it?

955
01:11:55,067 --> 01:11:56,067
No.

956
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,867
Not right now.

957
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:20,234
Roll in!

958
01:12:31,501 --> 01:12:35,867
New girlfriend at your aniversary Red!

959
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,100
Lights out!

960
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:30,267
Andy was as good as his word.

961
01:13:30,467 --> 01:13:33,067
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

962
01:13:35,134 --> 01:13:39,067
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

963
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:42,334
...they couldn´t buy him off
withjust a $200 check.

964
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:47,267
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

965
01:13:47,367 --> 01:13:49,067
...just to shut him up.

966
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:52,067
And you´d be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

967
01:13:52,134 --> 01:13:55,134
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

968
01:13:55,201 --> 01:13:57,733
He bought remaindered books
by the pound....

969
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,467
Treasure Island.

970
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,334
Robert Louis--

971
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:02,867
Stevenson.

972
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:04,867
Fiction, adventure.

973
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:07,733
What´s next?

974
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,934
l got here Auto Repair...

975
01:14:11,301 --> 01:14:12,467
...and Soap Carving.

976
01:14:12,733 --> 01:14:15,900
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under ''Educational,'' behind you.

977
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,967
Count of Monte Crisco.

978
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:20,134
That´s ''Cristo,'' you dumb shit.

979
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:22,134
By Alexandree...

980
01:14:22,733 --> 01:14:24,367
...Dum-ass.

981
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:25,934
Dumb ass.

982
01:14:27,733 --> 01:14:28,867
Dumb ass?

983
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:33,401
Dumas. lKnow what that´s about?

984
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:37,267
You´d like it.
lt´s about a prison break.

985
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,967
We ought to file that
under ''Educational'' too, oughtn´t we?

986
01:14:42,234 --> 01:14:45,967
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

987
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,401
By the year Kennedy was shot...

988
01:14:48,501 --> 01:14:53,000
...Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

989
01:14:53,034 --> 01:14:56,467
...into the best prison library
in New England...

990
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:59,800
...complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

991
01:15:06,733 --> 01:15:08,833
That was also when Warden Norton...

992
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,800
...instituted his famous
''Inside Out'' program.

993
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,134
You may remember reading about it.

994
01:15:14,234 --> 01:15:17,401
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

995
01:15:17,733 --> 01:15:19,000
lt´s no free ride...

996
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:22,167
..but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

997
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,334
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

998
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:27,401
Our inmates, properly supervised...

999
01:15:27,767 --> 01:15:30,367
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

1000
01:15:30,501 --> 01:15:33,067
...performing all manner
of public service.

1001
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:36,067
These men can learn the value...

1002
01:15:36,134 --> 01:15:38,501
...of an honest day´s labor and
provide a service to the community...

1003
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:44,434
...at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

1004
01:15:45,034 --> 01:15:47,367
Of course he didn´t tell the press...

1005
01:15:47,467 --> 01:15:50,900
...that ''bare minimum of expense''
is a fairly loose term.

1006
01:15:51,067 --> 01:15:53,767
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1007
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:56,401
Men, materials, you name it.

1008
01:15:56,733 --> 01:15:59,800
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1009
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,267
At this rate,
you´ll put me out of business.

1010
01:16:02,334 --> 01:16:06,700
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1011
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:10,234
We´re providing
a valuable community service.

1012
01:16:10,334 --> 01:16:13,467
That´s fine for the papers,
but l´ve got a family to feed.

1013
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:18,334
We go back a long way.

1014
01:16:19,067 --> 01:16:23,501
l need this highway contract. l don´t
get it and l go under. That´s a fact.

1015
01:16:24,733 --> 01:16:26,800
You have some of this fine pie...

1016
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,167
...my missus made for you.
You think about that.

1017
01:16:37,733 --> 01:16:40,267
l wouldn´t worry too much
about this contract.

1018
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:43,867
l already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1019
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:47,967
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1020
01:16:49,334 --> 01:16:51,733
And behind every shady deal...

1021
01:16:51,934 --> 01:16:54,100
...behind every dollar earned...

1022
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:56,967
...there was Andy, keeping the books.

1023
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,201
Two deposits.

1024
01:16:59,267 --> 01:17:03,167
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1025
01:17:32,201 --> 01:17:36,733
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1026
01:17:36,934 --> 01:17:39,833
lf they over-starch my shirts again,
they´ll hear from me.

1027
01:17:40,401 --> 01:17:42,201
How do l look?

1028
01:17:42,301 --> 01:17:45,301
-Very nice.
-Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1029
01:17:45,401 --> 01:17:46,800
Governor will be there.

1030
01:17:48,067 --> 01:17:49,134
You want the rest of this?

1031
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:52,467
Woman can´t bake worth shit.

1032
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:55,000
Thank you, sir.

1033
01:17:58,067 --> 01:18:01,034
He´s got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what l hear.

1034
01:18:01,234 --> 01:18:05,800
He´s got scams you haven´t even
dreamed of. lKickbacks on his kickbacks.

1035
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,800
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1036
01:18:08,867 --> 01:18:12,401
Sooner or later, he´ll have to
explain where it came from.

1037
01:18:12,501 --> 01:18:14,100
That´s where l come in.

1038
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:17,100
l channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1039
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:19,967
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1040
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:23,700
l send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back....

1041
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,867
-Clean as a virgin´s honeypot, huh?
-Cleaner.

1042
01:18:27,067 --> 01:18:30,201
By the time Norton retires,
l´ll have made him a millionaire.

1043
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:37,067
lf they ever catch on, he´ll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1044
01:18:37,234 --> 01:18:40,501
l thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1045
01:18:40,767 --> 01:18:43,733
l know you´re good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1046
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:46,967
Now anybody gets curious,
FBl, lRS...

1047
01:18:47,067 --> 01:18:48,301
...whatever.

1048
01:18:48,367 --> 01:18:50,167
lt´ll lead to somebody.

1049
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,967
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1050
01:18:57,301 --> 01:18:58,467
All right, who?

1051
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:00,267
Randall Stevens.

1052
01:19:00,367 --> 01:19:01,700
Who?

1053
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,700
The ''silent'' silent partner.

1054
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:09,100
lt´s where the filtering
process starts.

1055
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:11,900
They trace anything,
it´ll just lead to him.

1056
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,700
But who is he?

1057
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:18,234
He´s a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1058
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:20,034
l conjured him...

1059
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,833
...out of thin air.

1060
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,434
He doesn´t exist, except on paper.

1061
01:19:27,301 --> 01:19:30,167
You can´t just make a person up.

1062
01:19:30,367 --> 01:19:33,767
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1063
01:19:33,867 --> 01:19:36,267
lt´s amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1064
01:19:36,434 --> 01:19:39,234
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1065
01:19:39,334 --> 01:19:41,733
...driver´s license, Social Security.

1066
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:42,733
You´re shitting me.

1067
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:45,267
lf they trace any accounts,
they´ll wind up chasing...

1068
01:19:45,367 --> 01:19:47,334
...a figment of my imagination.

1069
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,334
Well, l´ll be damned!

1070
01:19:51,234 --> 01:19:52,934
Did l say you were good?

1071
01:19:53,201 --> 01:19:55,267
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1072
01:19:55,467 --> 01:19:57,367
The funny thing is...

1073
01:19:57,434 --> 01:20:01,234
...on the outside, l was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1074
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:04,034
l had to come to prison to be a crook.

1075
01:20:12,501 --> 01:20:14,134
Ever bother you?

1076
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,167
l don´t run the scams.
l just process the profits.

1077
01:20:18,367 --> 01:20:19,967
A fine line, maybe...

1078
01:20:20,967 --> 01:20:22,900
...but l also built that library...

1079
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,900
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1080
01:20:25,967 --> 01:20:28,467
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1081
01:20:28,733 --> 01:20:30,800
lKeep you happy and doing the laundry.

1082
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,700
Money instead of sheets.

1083
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:35,501
Well, l work cheap.
That´s the tradeoff.

1084
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,167
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

1085
01:20:54,234 --> 01:20:58,234
...on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1086
01:20:59,201 --> 01:21:01,367
That´s breaking and entering to you.

1087
01:21:01,467 --> 01:21:03,800
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1088
01:21:03,967 --> 01:21:05,167
Young punk.

1089
01:21:05,334 --> 01:21:06,900
Mr. Rock ´n´ Roll...

1090
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,467
...cocky as hell.

1091
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,700
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1092
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:13,100
Making me look bad.

1093
01:21:13,167 --> 01:21:14,900
We liked him immediately.

1094
01:21:14,967 --> 01:21:18,934
l´m backing out the door
and l got the TV like this.

1095
01:21:19,034 --> 01:21:22,767
A big old thing. l couldn´t see shit.
Then l hear this voice.

1096
01:21:22,867 --> 01:21:24,934
''Freeze, kid, hands in the air.''

1097
01:21:25,234 --> 01:21:29,000
l was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1098
01:21:29,201 --> 01:21:33,367
''You hear what l said, boy?''
l say, ''Yes, sir. l did.

1099
01:21:33,467 --> 01:21:37,267
But if l drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too.''

1100
01:21:40,501 --> 01:21:43,733
You done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1101
01:21:43,934 --> 01:21:47,267
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1102
01:21:47,434 --> 01:21:50,134
Weekend furloughs.
Work programs.

1103
01:21:50,334 --> 01:21:51,401
Not like here.

1104
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:53,733
Sounds like you done time all over.

1105
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:56,267
l´ve been in and out since l was 1 3.

1106
01:21:56,367 --> 01:21:58,434
Name it, chances are l´ve been there.

1107
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:01,134
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1108
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:04,700
What l mean is...

1109
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,767
...you´re not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1110
01:22:07,867 --> 01:22:10,833
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1111
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,900
What are you in for?

1112
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,167
Me?

1113
01:22:16,267 --> 01:22:17,967
A lawyer fucked me.

1114
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:24,367
Everybody´s innocent in here.
Don´t you know that?

1115
01:22:32,134 --> 01:22:36,267
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1116
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,867
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

1117
01:22:38,967 --> 01:22:41,334
...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1118
01:22:41,867 --> 01:22:42,934
Whatever it was...

1119
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:45,733
...something lit a fire
under that boy´s ass.

1120
01:22:49,334 --> 01:22:53,267
Thought l might try for
my high school equivalency.

1121
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:55,934
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1122
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,401
l don´t waste time with losers, Tommy.

1123
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:02,100
l ain´t no goddamn loser.

1124
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,167
-You mean that?
-Yeah.

1125
01:23:06,867 --> 01:23:08,401
You really mean that?

1126
01:23:09,267 --> 01:23:10,967
Yes, sir, l do.

1127
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:12,867
Good. Because if we do this...

1128
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:16,301
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1129
01:23:16,934 --> 01:23:18,367
Thing is, see...

1130
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,367
...l don´t read so good.

1131
01:23:22,334 --> 01:23:23,334
''Well.''

1132
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:27,034
You don´t read...

1133
01:23:27,301 --> 01:23:28,833
...so well.

1134
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,367
We´ll get to that.

1135
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,067
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1136
01:23:39,167 --> 01:23:41,501
Started walking him through his ABC´s.

1137
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:45,833
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1138
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,900
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1139
01:23:50,967 --> 01:23:54,301
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1140
01:23:54,501 --> 01:23:56,201
He really liked the kid.

1141
01:23:56,301 --> 01:23:59,267
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1142
01:24:00,067 --> 01:24:02,067
But that wasn´t the only reason.

1143
01:24:02,867 --> 01:24:05,134
Prison time is slow time.

1144
01:24:05,201 --> 01:24:07,733
So you do what you can to keep going.

1145
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:10,401
Some fellas collect stamps.

1146
01:24:10,767 --> 01:24:13,000
Others build matchstick houses.

1147
01:24:13,201 --> 01:24:15,800
Andy built a library.

1148
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,967
Now he needed a new project.

1149
01:24:19,067 --> 01:24:20,767
Tommy was it.

1150
01:24:21,234 --> 01:24:25,733
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1151
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,067
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1152
01:24:29,234 --> 01:24:30,867
In prison...

1153
01:24:31,034 --> 01:24:34,467
...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1154
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:40,334
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1155
01:24:40,434 --> 01:24:42,401
...it was lovely Raquel.

1156
01:24:58,334 --> 01:24:59,401
Time.

1157
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:06,067
Well?

1158
01:25:07,434 --> 01:25:09,234
Well, it´s for shit.

1159
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,967
l wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1160
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:14,767
lt´s probably not that bad.

1161
01:25:14,867 --> 01:25:19,000
l didn´t get a thing right.
lt might as well have been in Chinese.

1162
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,367
Let´s see how the score comes out.

1163
01:25:20,733 --> 01:25:23,434
l´ll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1164
01:25:25,501 --> 01:25:27,034
Two points, right there!

1165
01:25:27,234 --> 01:25:28,833
There´s your goddamn score!

1166
01:25:28,934 --> 01:25:32,900
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25....

1167
01:25:33,067 --> 01:25:34,733
Fuck this place!

1168
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,201
Fuck it!

1169
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,134
l feel bad.

1170
01:25:54,201 --> 01:25:55,401
l let him down.

1171
01:25:55,501 --> 01:25:57,301
That´s crap, kid.

1172
01:25:57,367 --> 01:25:59,034
He´s proud of you.

1173
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:01,833
We´re old friends,
l know him as good as anybody.

1174
01:26:01,934 --> 01:26:03,467
Smart fellow, ain´t he?

1175
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:06,867
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1176
01:26:06,967 --> 01:26:08,501
What´s he in here for anyway?

1177
01:26:09,334 --> 01:26:10,833
Murder.

1178
01:26:11,434 --> 01:26:12,867
The hell, you say.

1179
01:26:15,034 --> 01:26:17,134
You wouldn´t think it
to look at the guy.

1180
01:26:18,234 --> 01:26:21,767
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1181
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,267
What?

1182
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:34,167
About four years ago...

1183
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,367
...l was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1184
01:26:38,434 --> 01:26:40,067
l stole a car.

1185
01:26:40,167 --> 01:26:41,967
lt was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1186
01:26:42,767 --> 01:26:44,833
About six months left to go...

1187
01:26:45,034 --> 01:26:46,900
...l get a new cellmate in.

1188
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,900
Elmo Blatch.

1189
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,700
Big, twitchy fucker.

1190
01:26:51,967 --> 01:26:55,134
lKind of roomie you pray you don´t get.
You know what l´m saying?

1191
01:26:55,401 --> 01:26:57,833
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1192
01:26:58,334 --> 01:27:00,767
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1193
01:27:00,934 --> 01:27:05,401
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1194
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:10,700
Talked all the time too. That´s
the other thing. He never shut up.

1195
01:27:11,134 --> 01:27:12,733
Places he´d been in...

1196
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:15,401
...jobs he´d pulled, women he fucked.

1197
01:27:16,134 --> 01:27:17,833
Even people he killed.

1198
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:22,067
People who ''gave him shit.''

1199
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,434
That´s how he put it.

1200
01:27:25,434 --> 01:27:28,201
So one night, like a joke...

1201
01:27:29,434 --> 01:27:32,501
...l say to him,
''Elmo, who did you kill?''

1202
01:27:33,401 --> 01:27:34,733
So he says:

1203
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:38,767
l got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1204
01:27:39,034 --> 01:27:42,867
...so l could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1205
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:46,301
So l pick out this guy...

1206
01:27:47,767 --> 01:27:49,100
...go in one night...

1207
01:27:49,267 --> 01:27:50,900
...and do his place.

1208
01:27:52,334 --> 01:27:53,501
He wakes up...

1209
01:27:54,401 --> 01:27:55,934
...and gives me shit.

1210
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,301
So l killed him.

1211
01:28:00,267 --> 01:28:02,434
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1212
01:28:04,867 --> 01:28:06,501
And that´s the best part.

1213
01:28:07,201 --> 01:28:09,467
She´s fucking this prick, see...

1214
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:12,267
...this golf pro,
but she´s married to some other guy.

1215
01:28:13,267 --> 01:28:15,134
Some hotshot banker.

1216
01:28:17,134 --> 01:28:19,401
And he´s the one they pinned it on.

1217
01:28:30,401 --> 01:28:33,700
l have to say that´s
the most amazing story l ever heard.

1218
01:28:35,401 --> 01:28:37,967
What amazes me most
is you´d be taken in by it.

1219
01:28:38,767 --> 01:28:40,134
Sir?

1220
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:44,767
lt´s obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1221
01:28:45,733 --> 01:28:49,267
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1222
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,867
He´s young, not terribly bright.

1223
01:28:52,234 --> 01:28:55,467
lt´s not surprising he wouldn´t
know what a state he put you in.

1224
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,867
Sir, he´s telling the truth.

1225
01:28:58,234 --> 01:29:01,934
Let´s say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1226
01:29:02,401 --> 01:29:07,167
You think he´d just fall to his knees
and cry, ''Yes, l did it. l confess.

1227
01:29:07,267 --> 01:29:09,967
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence.''

1228
01:29:10,067 --> 01:29:12,934
With Tommy´s testimony,
l can get a new trial.

1229
01:29:13,134 --> 01:29:15,301
That´s assuming Blatch is still there.

1230
01:29:15,367 --> 01:29:17,467
Chances are, he´d be released by now.

1231
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,067
They´d have his last known address.

1232
01:29:20,167 --> 01:29:21,967
lt´s a chance, isn´t it?

1233
01:29:24,201 --> 01:29:25,934
How can you be so obtuse?

1234
01:29:26,733 --> 01:29:27,767
What?

1235
01:29:29,134 --> 01:29:30,467
What did you call me?

1236
01:29:30,733 --> 01:29:32,900
Obtuse. ls it deliberate?

1237
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,434
You´re forgetting yourself.

1238
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,334
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1239
01:29:37,434 --> 01:29:40,000
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1240
01:29:40,067 --> 01:29:43,067
lf you want to indulge this fantasy,
it´s your business.

1241
01:29:43,134 --> 01:29:45,833
Don´t make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1242
01:29:45,934 --> 01:29:49,034
lf l got out, l´d never mention
what happens here.

1243
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:51,501
l´d be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1244
01:29:52,934 --> 01:29:56,501
Don´t ever mention money to me,
you son of a bitch!

1245
01:29:56,767 --> 01:29:57,934
Not in this office...

1246
01:29:58,034 --> 01:30:00,467
...not anywhere.
Get in here, now!

1247
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,434
l just wanted to put you at ease,
that´s all.

1248
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:04,967
Solitary. A month.

1249
01:30:06,034 --> 01:30:07,234
What´s wrong with you?

1250
01:30:07,301 --> 01:30:08,301
Get him out of here.

1251
01:30:08,401 --> 01:30:10,100
This is my chance to get out!

1252
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:11,733
lt´s my life! Understand?!

1253
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,034
Get him out!

1254
01:30:16,134 --> 01:30:17,934
A month in the hole.

1255
01:30:18,134 --> 01:30:20,401
That´s the longest stretch
l ever heard of.

1256
01:30:20,934 --> 01:30:22,201
lt´s all my fault.

1257
01:30:22,267 --> 01:30:23,800
Bullshit.

1258
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:26,867
You didn´t pull the trigger
or convict him.

1259
01:30:26,967 --> 01:30:29,401
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1260
01:30:29,501 --> 01:30:31,467
l mean, for real innocent?

1261
01:30:31,733 --> 01:30:33,100
lt looks that way.

1262
01:30:33,467 --> 01:30:35,067
Sweet Jesus.

1263
01:30:35,733 --> 01:30:37,201
How long has he been here now?

1264
01:30:37,367 --> 01:30:41,267
1 947. What is that?
Nineteen years.

1265
01:30:41,334 --> 01:30:43,501
-Williams, Thomas.
-Yeah, over here.

1266
01:30:49,201 --> 01:30:50,267
What you got?

1267
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,301
Board of Education.

1268
01:30:52,501 --> 01:30:54,100
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1269
01:30:54,201 --> 01:30:57,800
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1270
01:30:57,967 --> 01:30:59,967
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1271
01:31:00,867 --> 01:31:03,134
Skeets, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1272
01:31:04,301 --> 01:31:05,467
Floyd, come on.

1273
01:31:10,767 --> 01:31:12,501
Will you throw that away, please?

1274
01:31:18,367 --> 01:31:19,700
Well, shit.

1275
01:31:32,234 --> 01:31:35,034
The kid passed. C + average.

1276
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:36,867
Thought you´d like to know.

1277
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,234
Warden wants to talk.

1278
01:32:07,334 --> 01:32:08,501
Out here?

1279
01:32:08,767 --> 01:32:10,301
That´s what the man said.

1280
01:32:26,067 --> 01:32:27,234
Warden?

1281
01:32:36,733 --> 01:32:39,900
l´m asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1282
01:32:42,067 --> 01:32:43,967
l feel awkward enough as it is.

1283
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,367
We got a situation here.

1284
01:33:04,767 --> 01:33:06,501
l think you can appreciate that.

1285
01:33:06,967 --> 01:33:08,134
Yes, sir.

1286
01:33:08,301 --> 01:33:09,501
l sure can.

1287
01:33:10,034 --> 01:33:14,234
l tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1288
01:33:15,301 --> 01:33:17,201
lt´s got me up nights.
That´s the truth.

1289
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,800
The right thing to do...

1290
01:33:23,234 --> 01:33:26,067
...sometimes it´s hard to know
what that is.

1291
01:33:27,434 --> 01:33:29,401
Do you understand?

1292
01:33:31,201 --> 01:33:34,100
l need your help, son.

1293
01:33:34,267 --> 01:33:36,167
lf l´m going to move on this...

1294
01:33:36,434 --> 01:33:39,134
...there can´t be
the least little shred of doubt.

1295
01:33:40,501 --> 01:33:41,767
l have to know...

1296
01:33:41,833 --> 01:33:44,000
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1297
01:33:44,301 --> 01:33:45,900
Yes, sir.

1298
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,301
Absolutely.

1299
01:33:47,434 --> 01:33:50,434
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1300
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:52,367
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1301
01:33:52,467 --> 01:33:55,167
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1302
01:33:55,234 --> 01:33:57,234
Just give me that chance.

1303
01:34:01,201 --> 01:34:02,467
That´s what l thought.

1304
01:34:47,367 --> 01:34:49,167
l´m sure by now you´ve heard.

1305
01:34:51,134 --> 01:34:52,134
Terrible thing.

1306
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,434
A man that young...

1307
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:57,867
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1308
01:34:58,234 --> 01:35:00,067
Broke Captain Hadley´s heart
to shoot him.

1309
01:35:01,434 --> 01:35:02,767
Truly, it did.

1310
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:07,733
We just have to put it behind us.

1311
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,900
Move on.

1312
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,000
l´m done.

1313
01:35:14,934 --> 01:35:16,501
Everything stops.

1314
01:35:18,467 --> 01:35:20,800
Get someone else to run your scams.

1315
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:23,334
Nothing stops.

1316
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,067
Nothing.

1317
01:35:29,334 --> 01:35:32,201
Or you will do
the hardest time there is.

1318
01:35:32,833 --> 01:35:35,100
No more protection from the guards.

1319
01:35:35,267 --> 01:35:39,867
l´ll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1320
01:35:41,134 --> 01:35:43,201
You´ll think you´ve been
fucked by a train.

1321
01:35:44,934 --> 01:35:46,201
And the library?

1322
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,267
Gone.

1323
01:35:48,434 --> 01:35:50,767
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1324
01:35:51,334 --> 01:35:54,134
We´ll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1325
01:35:54,201 --> 01:35:56,301
They´ll see the flames for miles.

1326
01:35:56,367 --> 01:35:59,000
We´ll dance around it like wild lnjuns.

1327
01:36:00,301 --> 01:36:03,100
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1328
01:36:06,867 --> 01:36:08,867
Or am l being obtuse?

1329
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,434
Give him another month
to think about it.

1330
01:37:07,401 --> 01:37:10,100
My wife used to say
l´m a hard man to know.

1331
01:37:11,167 --> 01:37:12,833
Like a closed book.

1332
01:37:13,467 --> 01:37:15,700
Complained about it all the time.

1333
01:37:16,367 --> 01:37:18,067
She was beautiful.

1334
01:37:20,201 --> 01:37:21,467
God, l loved her.

1335
01:37:25,367 --> 01:37:27,967
l didn´t know how
to show it, that´s all.

1336
01:37:30,067 --> 01:37:31,334
l killed her, Red.

1337
01:37:33,301 --> 01:37:34,934
l didn´t pull the trigger...

1338
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:38,234
...but l drove her away.

1339
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:41,733
That´s why she died, because of me...

1340
01:37:42,367 --> 01:37:44,067
...the way l am.

1341
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:54,467
That don´t make you a murderer.

1342
01:37:57,434 --> 01:37:59,234
Bad husband, maybe.

1343
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:05,900
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn´t pull the trigger.

1344
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,267
No, l didn´t.

1345
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,334
Somebody else did.

1346
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:12,067
And l wound up in here.

1347
01:38:14,967 --> 01:38:16,234
Bad luck, l guess.

1348
01:38:21,367 --> 01:38:22,900
lt floats around.

1349
01:38:23,967 --> 01:38:25,767
lt´s got to land on somebody.

1350
01:38:26,867 --> 01:38:28,301
lt was my turn, that´s all.

1351
01:38:29,201 --> 01:38:31,467
l was in the path of the tornado.

1352
01:38:37,733 --> 01:38:40,867
l just didn´t expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1353
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:47,733
Think you´ll ever get out of here?

1354
01:38:48,367 --> 01:38:49,700
Me?

1355
01:38:52,167 --> 01:38:53,134
Yeah.

1356
01:38:54,501 --> 01:38:57,034
One day, when l got
a long, white beard...

1357
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,767
...and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs.

1358
01:39:01,934 --> 01:39:03,301
l tell you where l´d go.

1359
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,167
Zihuatanejo.

1360
01:39:07,334 --> 01:39:08,434
Say what?

1361
01:39:08,867 --> 01:39:10,234
Zihuatanejo.

1362
01:39:11,501 --> 01:39:12,934
lt´s in Mexico.

1363
01:39:14,301 --> 01:39:16,367
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1364
01:39:17,434 --> 01:39:19,967
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1365
01:39:21,934 --> 01:39:23,733
They say it has no memory.

1366
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:28,167
That´s where l want to live
the rest of my life.

1367
01:39:29,867 --> 01:39:31,967
A warm place with no memory.

1368
01:39:35,201 --> 01:39:37,334
Open up a little hotel...

1369
01:39:38,767 --> 01:39:40,167
...right on the beach.

1370
01:39:40,867 --> 01:39:42,767
Buy some worthless old boat...

1371
01:39:43,401 --> 01:39:44,767
...and fix it up new.

1372
01:39:47,733 --> 01:39:48,967
Take my guests out...

1373
01:39:49,767 --> 01:39:51,034
...charter fishing.

1374
01:39:54,733 --> 01:39:56,034
Zihuatanejo.

1375
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,967
ln a place like that, l could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1376
01:40:09,733 --> 01:40:11,900
l don´t think l could make it
on the outside.

1377
01:40:18,934 --> 01:40:20,733
l been in here most of my life.

1378
01:40:22,167 --> 01:40:24,067
l´m an institutional man now.

1379
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,234
Just like Brooks was.

1380
01:40:27,134 --> 01:40:29,201
You underestimate yourself.

1381
01:40:30,034 --> 01:40:31,367
l don´t think so.

1382
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:38,900
ln here l´m the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1383
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,234
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1384
01:40:42,434 --> 01:40:44,367
Hell, l wouldn´t know
where to begin.

1385
01:40:46,434 --> 01:40:48,501
Pacific Ocean?

1386
01:40:48,767 --> 01:40:50,134
Shit.

1387
01:40:50,234 --> 01:40:52,100
Scare me to death,
something that big.

1388
01:40:52,301 --> 01:40:53,467
Not me.

1389
01:40:54,733 --> 01:40:57,434
l didn´t shoot my wife,
and l didn´t shoot her lover.

1390
01:40:58,967 --> 01:41:02,201
Whatever mistakes l made,
l´ve paid for them and then some.

1391
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:04,900
That hotel, that boat....

1392
01:41:06,167 --> 01:41:08,434
l don´t think that´s too much to ask.

1393
01:41:13,134 --> 01:41:15,467
You shouldn´t be doing this to yourself.

1394
01:41:15,833 --> 01:41:17,700
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1395
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,434
Mexico is way down there
and you´re in here...

1396
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,134
...and that´s the way it is.

1397
01:41:22,334 --> 01:41:24,967
Yeah, right.
That´s the way it is.

1398
01:41:26,434 --> 01:41:28,867
lt´s down there and l´m in here.

1399
01:41:31,301 --> 01:41:33,733
l guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1400
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,134
Get busy living...

1401
01:41:39,401 --> 01:41:40,934
...or get busy dying.

1402
01:41:53,301 --> 01:41:55,733
lf you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1403
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:58,167
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1404
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,167
There´s a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1405
01:42:04,234 --> 01:42:08,034
-A lot of hayfields up there.
-One in particular.

1406
01:42:08,201 --> 01:42:12,167
lt´s got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1407
01:42:12,267 --> 01:42:14,867
lt´s like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1408
01:42:15,967 --> 01:42:18,034
lt´s where l asked my wife to marry me.

1409
01:42:19,733 --> 01:42:21,833
We went there for a picnic...

1410
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,134
...and made love under that oak...

1411
01:42:24,767 --> 01:42:26,733
...and l asked and she said yes.

1412
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:32,234
Promise me, Red.

1413
01:42:33,234 --> 01:42:34,867
lf you ever get out...

1414
01:42:34,934 --> 01:42:36,733
...find that spot.

1415
01:42:37,467 --> 01:42:41,900
At the base of that wall, there´s a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1416
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:45,934
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1417
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,900
Something´s buried under it
l want you to have.

1418
01:42:52,067 --> 01:42:53,434
What, Andy?

1419
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:55,234
What´s buried under there?

1420
01:42:56,867 --> 01:42:58,434
You´ll have to pry it up...

1421
01:42:58,867 --> 01:43:00,234
...to see.

1422
01:43:05,467 --> 01:43:07,100
No, l´m telling you. The guy is....

1423
01:43:08,267 --> 01:43:09,700
He´s talking funny.

1424
01:43:10,967 --> 01:43:12,401
l´m really worried about him.

1425
01:43:12,934 --> 01:43:14,301
Let´s keep an eye on him.

1426
01:43:14,401 --> 01:43:17,800
That´s fine during the day,
but at night he´s all alone.

1427
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,067
Oh, Lord.

1428
01:43:21,334 --> 01:43:22,367
What?

1429
01:43:23,467 --> 01:43:25,900
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1430
01:43:26,267 --> 01:43:28,334
He asked me for a length of rope.

1431
01:43:28,501 --> 01:43:29,767
Rope?

1432
01:43:29,867 --> 01:43:31,301
Six feet long.

1433
01:43:31,501 --> 01:43:33,000
And you gave it to him.

1434
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:35,467
Sure. Why wouldn´t l?

1435
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:37,267
Jesus! Heywood.

1436
01:43:37,334 --> 01:43:39,467
How was l supposed to know?

1437
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,267
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1438
01:43:43,167 --> 01:43:45,034
Andy would never do that.

1439
01:43:45,234 --> 01:43:46,833
Never.

1440
01:43:48,401 --> 01:43:49,467
l don´t know.

1441
01:43:52,367 --> 01:43:54,334
Every man has his breaking point.

1442
01:43:56,867 --> 01:43:58,934
Lickety-split.
Want to get home.

1443
01:43:59,201 --> 01:44:00,900
Just about finished, sir.

1444
01:44:17,201 --> 01:44:18,800
Three deposits tonight.

1445
01:44:26,501 --> 01:44:28,467
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1446
01:44:28,833 --> 01:44:30,267
And shine my shoes.

1447
01:44:30,367 --> 01:44:33,067
-l want them looking like mirrors.
-Yes, sir.

1448
01:44:38,401 --> 01:44:40,100
lt´s good having you back.

1449
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,401
Place wasn´t the same without you.

1450
01:45:27,367 --> 01:45:28,967
Lights out!

1451
01:46:00,067 --> 01:46:02,800
I´ve had some long nights in stir.

1452
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,934
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1453
01:46:06,034 --> 01:46:08,100
...time can draw out like a blade.

1454
01:46:13,434 --> 01:46:15,934
That was the longest night of my life.

1455
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:33,167
Give me a count!

1456
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:39,733
Tier 3 south, clear!

1457
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:45,767
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1458
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:47,267
Dufresne!

1459
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:50,100
Come out. You´re holding up the show!

1460
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:56,167
Don´t make me come down
or l´ll thump your skull for you!

1461
01:47:03,267 --> 01:47:07,167
Damn it, you´re putting me behind!
l got a schedule to keep.

1462
01:47:07,234 --> 01:47:09,934
You´d better be sick or dead in there.
l shit you not!

1463
01:47:10,301 --> 01:47:11,833
You hear me?

1464
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:19,234
Oh, my Holy God.

1465
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:38,201
l want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1466
01:47:38,833 --> 01:47:40,900
-Start with that friend of his.
-Who?

1467
01:47:41,267 --> 01:47:44,700
Open 237.

1468
01:47:48,401 --> 01:47:52,733
What do you mean, ''He just wasn´t here''?
Don´t say that to me.

1469
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,434
Don´t tell me that again.

1470
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:55,700
But sir, he wasn´t.

1471
01:47:55,867 --> 01:47:58,401
l can see that, Haig!
Think l´m blind?

1472
01:47:59,401 --> 01:48:00,900
ls that what you´re saying?

1473
01:48:01,267 --> 01:48:03,434
-Am l blind, Haig?
-No, sir!

1474
01:48:04,767 --> 01:48:07,100
What about you. You blind?

1475
01:48:07,467 --> 01:48:09,867
-Tell me what this is.
-Last night´s count.

1476
01:48:10,034 --> 01:48:13,767
You see Dufresne´s name there?
l sure do. Right there.

1477
01:48:13,867 --> 01:48:15,134
''Dufresne.''

1478
01:48:16,301 --> 01:48:18,234
He was in his cell, at lights out.

1479
01:48:18,334 --> 01:48:21,367
Reasonable he´d be here in the morning.

1480
01:48:22,167 --> 01:48:24,067
l want him found.

1481
01:48:24,234 --> 01:48:27,367
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1482
01:48:27,434 --> 01:48:28,700
Yes, sir.

1483
01:48:30,067 --> 01:48:32,401
Let´s go. Move your butts.

1484
01:48:35,733 --> 01:48:36,800
Stand.

1485
01:48:37,467 --> 01:48:38,434
Well?

1486
01:48:41,867 --> 01:48:43,000
Well, what?

1487
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:46,234
l see you two all the time.
You´re thick as thieves, you are.

1488
01:48:47,234 --> 01:48:48,767
He must have said something.

1489
01:48:49,401 --> 01:48:51,034
No, sir, Warden.

1490
01:48:51,201 --> 01:48:52,467
Not a word.

1491
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,167
Lord, it´s a miracle!

1492
01:48:57,067 --> 01:48:59,234
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1493
01:49:00,134 --> 01:49:01,700
Nothing left...

1494
01:49:02,234 --> 01:49:04,334
...but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1495
01:49:04,867 --> 01:49:07,733
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let´s ask her.

1496
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:09,000
Maybe she knows.

1497
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:12,067
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1498
01:49:13,867 --> 01:49:15,034
Guess not.

1499
01:49:15,334 --> 01:49:17,134
Why should she be any different?

1500
01:49:18,467 --> 01:49:20,000
This is a conspiracy.

1501
01:49:20,733 --> 01:49:22,067
That´s what this is.

1502
01:49:22,367 --> 01:49:26,767
One big, damn conspiracy!

1503
01:49:26,934 --> 01:49:28,367
And everyone´s in on it!

1504
01:49:29,267 --> 01:49:30,167
lncluding her!

1505
01:50:04,067 --> 01:50:05,767
In 1966...

1506
01:50:05,934 --> 01:50:08,034
...Andy Dufresne escaped...

1507
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:09,900
...from Shawshank Prison.

1508
01:50:11,934 --> 01:50:15,100
All they found
was a muddy set ofprison clothes...

1509
01:50:15,201 --> 01:50:16,700
...a bar of soap...

1510
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,334
...and an old rock hammer...

1511
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:20,867
...damn near worn down to the nub.

1512
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:30,067
I had thought it´d take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it.

1513
01:50:30,167 --> 01:50:32,501
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1514
01:50:50,301 --> 01:50:52,301
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1515
01:50:53,234 --> 01:50:56,167
I imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature.

1516
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,234
An ice age here...

1517
01:50:58,967 --> 01:51:01,034
...million years
of mountain building there.

1518
01:51:02,301 --> 01:51:04,900
Geology is the study
ofpressure and time.

1519
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:07,367
That´s all it takes, really.

1520
01:51:08,334 --> 01:51:09,867
Pressure...

1521
01:51:10,067 --> 01:51:11,334
...and time.

1522
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:14,867
That and a big goddamn poster.

1523
01:51:18,401 --> 01:51:19,934
Like I said...

1524
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,700
...in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1525
01:51:26,434 --> 01:51:31,434
Seems Andy´s favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1526
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,501
...a handful at a time.

1527
01:51:34,767 --> 01:51:36,934
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1528
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,700
...Andy decided
he´d been here long enough.

1529
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:41,800
Lickety-split.
l want to get home.

1530
01:51:42,967 --> 01:51:44,767
l´m just about finished, sir.

1531
01:52:05,434 --> 01:52:06,934
Three deposits tonight.

1532
01:52:14,301 --> 01:52:16,467
Andy did like he was told.

1533
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,967
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

1534
01:52:23,833 --> 01:52:25,467
The guards simply didn´t notice.

1535
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:27,367
Neither did I.

1536
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,367
I mean, seriously...

1537
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:32,134
...how often do you really look
at a man´s shoes?

1538
01:54:30,967 --> 01:54:33,867
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1539
01:54:33,967 --> 01:54:36,934
...of shit-smelling foulness
I can´t even imagine.

1540
01:54:38,367 --> 01:54:40,100
Or maybe Ijust don´t want to.

1541
01:54:44,867 --> 01:54:46,833
Five hundred yards.

1542
01:54:47,434 --> 01:54:50,100
That´s the length
of five football fields.

1543
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:53,167
Just shy of half a mile.

1544
01:55:46,501 --> 01:55:51,000
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

1545
01:55:51,201 --> 01:55:54,067
...a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

1546
01:55:54,167 --> 01:55:56,767
...strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

1547
01:55:56,967 --> 01:55:59,934
Until that moment,
he didn´t exist.

1548
01:56:03,301 --> 01:56:05,334
He had all the proper ID...

1549
01:56:05,434 --> 01:56:08,867
...driver´s license, birth certificate,
Social Security card....

1550
01:56:09,401 --> 01:56:11,733
And the signature
was a spot-on match.

1551
01:56:12,201 --> 01:56:15,134
l must say l´m sorry
to be losing your business.

1552
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:17,234
l hope you´ll enjoy living abroad.

1553
01:56:17,334 --> 01:56:18,501
Thank you.

1554
01:56:19,134 --> 01:56:20,401
l´m sure l will.

1555
01:56:21,201 --> 01:56:24,267
Here´s your cashier´s check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1556
01:56:24,467 --> 01:56:25,833
Please.

1557
01:56:26,201 --> 01:56:28,301
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1558
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:30,267
l´d be happy to.

1559
01:56:31,967 --> 01:56:33,234
Good day, sir.

1560
01:56:34,234 --> 01:56:38,334
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1561
01:56:38,967 --> 01:56:40,867
All told, he blew town...

1562
01:56:40,967 --> 01:56:45,100
...with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton´s money.

1563
01:56:45,301 --> 01:56:48,000
Severance pay for 19 years.

1564
01:56:55,467 --> 01:56:57,401
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1565
01:56:57,967 --> 01:57:00,301
CORRUPTION.
DEATH IN SHAWSHANK.

1566
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:27,367
Dear director,

1567
01:57:27,434 --> 01:57:29,501
you had right.
It is help in him.

1568
01:57:48,401 --> 01:57:51,334
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1569
01:57:51,434 --> 01:57:55,934
lf you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1570
01:57:56,100 --> 01:58:00,334
I wasn´t there to see, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1571
01:58:00,434 --> 01:58:02,134
...when they took him away.

1572
01:58:07,733 --> 01:58:10,434
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1573
01:58:26,267 --> 01:58:27,700
Samuel Norton.

1574
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,767
We have a warrant
for your arrest. Open up.

1575
01:58:34,467 --> 01:58:35,833
Open the door.

1576
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,367
l´m not sure which key.

1577
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:48,367
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1578
01:59:00,167 --> 01:59:02,467
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1579
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:04,700
...other than that bullet...

1580
01:59:05,167 --> 01:59:09,334
...was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1581
01:59:12,034 --> 01:59:15,367
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1582
01:59:15,467 --> 01:59:17,267
...I got a postcard in the mail.

1583
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:21,301
It was blank,
but the postmark said...

1584
01:59:21,767 --> 01:59:23,401
...Fort Hancock, Texas.

1585
01:59:24,201 --> 01:59:25,867
Fort Hancock...

1586
01:59:25,967 --> 01:59:27,833
...right on the border.

1587
01:59:27,934 --> 01:59:29,833
That´s where Andy crossed.

1588
01:59:30,301 --> 01:59:33,967
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1589
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,467
...it always makes me laugh.

1590
01:59:38,501 --> 01:59:40,067
Andy Dufresne...

1591
01:59:40,767 --> 01:59:42,467
...who crawled through
a river of shit...

1592
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,800
...and came out clean
on the other side.

1593
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,067
Andy Dufresne...

1594
01:59:47,767 --> 01:59:49,401
...headed for the Pacific.

1595
01:59:52,367 --> 01:59:54,367
Hadley´s got him
by the throat, right?

1596
01:59:54,467 --> 01:59:57,867
He says, ''l believe this boy´s
about to have himself an accident.''

1597
01:59:58,234 --> 02:00:01,434
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1598
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:04,134
I swear, the stuff he pulled....

1599
02:00:04,234 --> 02:00:06,401
''My friends could use
a couple of beers.''

1600
02:00:06,501 --> 02:00:08,000
And he got it!

1601
02:00:09,367 --> 02:00:11,967
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1602
02:00:12,167 --> 02:00:14,134
...Andy being gone.

1603
02:00:14,234 --> 02:00:17,733
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren´t meant to be caged.

1604
02:00:18,467 --> 02:00:20,733
Their feathers arejust too bright.

1605
02:00:22,267 --> 02:00:24,067
And when they fly away...

1606
02:00:24,234 --> 02:00:28,367
...the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1607
02:00:29,334 --> 02:00:30,867
But still...

1608
02:00:31,134 --> 02:00:34,934
...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they´re gone.

1609
02:00:39,267 --> 02:00:41,334
I guess Ijust miss my friend.

1610
02:01:05,234 --> 02:01:06,234
Please sit down.

1611
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,201
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1612
02:01:13,733 --> 02:01:16,467
...your files say you´ve served
40 years of a life sentence.

1613
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:19,301
You feel you´ve been rehabilitated?

1614
02:01:21,367 --> 02:01:22,467
Rehabilitated?

1615
02:01:24,867 --> 02:01:26,434
Well, now, let me see.

1616
02:01:27,767 --> 02:01:30,034
l don´t have any idea
what that means.

1617
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:34,967
lt means you´re ready
to rejoin society--

1618
02:01:35,067 --> 02:01:37,067
l know what you think it means, sonny.

1619
02:01:39,034 --> 02:01:40,934
To me it´s just a made-up word.

1620
02:01:42,134 --> 02:01:44,501
A politician´s word so that...

1621
02:01:44,833 --> 02:01:48,800
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1622
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:50,434
...and have a job.

1623
02:01:52,167 --> 02:01:53,767
What do you really want to know?

1624
02:01:54,934 --> 02:01:57,201
Am l sorry for what l did?

1625
02:01:57,301 --> 02:01:58,900
Well, are you?

1626
02:02:00,167 --> 02:02:02,867
There´s not a day goes by
l don´t feel regret.

1627
02:02:04,134 --> 02:02:07,301
Not because l´m in here
or because you think l should.

1628
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,167
l look back on the way l was then...

1629
02:02:15,334 --> 02:02:17,234
...a young...

1630
02:02:17,401 --> 02:02:20,733
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1631
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:25,301
l want to talk to him.

1632
02:02:27,267 --> 02:02:29,967
l want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1633
02:02:30,334 --> 02:02:32,267
Tell him the way things are.

1634
02:02:34,267 --> 02:02:35,700
But l can´t.

1635
02:02:37,833 --> 02:02:39,900
That kid´s long gone...

1636
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,067
...and this old man is all that´s left.

1637
02:02:44,767 --> 02:02:46,301
l got to live with that.

1638
02:02:47,434 --> 02:02:49,234
Rehabilitated?

1639
02:02:49,401 --> 02:02:51,134
lt´s just a bullshit word.

1640
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:56,900
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1641
02:02:57,967 --> 02:02:59,501
Because to tell you the truth...

1642
02:03:00,401 --> 02:03:02,034
...l don´t give a shit.

1643
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:16,434
APROVED

1644
02:04:08,934 --> 02:04:13,201
BROOKS WAS HERE

1645
02:04:24,967 --> 02:04:26,100
Here you go, miss.

1646
02:04:29,467 --> 02:04:30,800
Restroom break?

1647
02:04:36,201 --> 02:04:40,467
You don´t need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1648
02:04:52,934 --> 02:04:56,100
Forty years I´ve been asking
permission to piss.

1649
02:04:56,367 --> 02:04:59,167
I can´t squeeze a drop without say-so.

1650
02:05:02,934 --> 02:05:04,833
There´s a harsh truth to face.

1651
02:05:06,733 --> 02:05:08,967
No way I´m going to make it
on the outside.

1652
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,800
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1653
02:05:20,967 --> 02:05:23,234
...so maybe they´d send me back.

1654
02:05:28,501 --> 02:05:30,501
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1655
02:05:31,833 --> 02:05:33,467
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1656
02:05:33,833 --> 02:05:35,367
Knew it all too well.

1657
02:05:36,967 --> 02:05:40,234
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1658
02:05:40,767 --> 02:05:43,100
Where I won´t have to be afraid
all the time.

1659
02:05:45,201 --> 02:05:47,167
Only one thing stops me.

1660
02:05:48,967 --> 02:05:50,800
A promise I made to Andy.

1661
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,201
There it is.

1662
02:06:22,201 --> 02:06:23,733
Much obliged, sir.

1663
02:09:54,067 --> 02:09:55,434
Dear Red:

1664
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:57,967
If you´re reading this,
you´ve gotten out...

1665
02:09:58,034 --> 02:10:01,934
...and if you´ve come this far,
maybe you´d come a bit further.

1666
02:10:02,201 --> 02:10:04,467
You remember the name
of the town, don´t you?

1667
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,501
Zihuatanejo.

1668
02:10:09,867 --> 02:10:13,367
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1669
02:10:13,833 --> 02:10:17,134
I´ll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1670
02:10:17,934 --> 02:10:19,301
Remember, Red...

1671
02:10:19,467 --> 02:10:21,467
...hope is a good thing...

1672
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:23,334
...maybe the best of things.

1673
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:25,501
And no good thing ever dies.

1674
02:10:26,501 --> 02:10:29,201
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1675
02:10:29,301 --> 02:10:31,201
...and finds you well.

1676
02:10:31,467 --> 02:10:33,000
Your friend...

1677
02:10:33,067 --> 02:10:34,700
...Andy.

1678
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,334
''Get busy living...

1679
02:11:08,700 --> 02:11:10,401
...or get busy dying. ''

1680
02:11:12,934 --> 02:11:14,434
That´s goddamn right.

1681
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:21,867
RED WAS HERE TOO.
For the second time in my life...

1682
02:11:22,034 --> 02:11:24,201
...I´m guilty of committing a crime.

1683
02:11:25,733 --> 02:11:27,700
Parole violation.

1684
02:11:28,167 --> 02:11:31,967
Of course I doubt they´ll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1685
02:11:32,401 --> 02:11:34,501
Not for an old crook like me.

1686
02:11:34,733 --> 02:11:36,900
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1687
02:11:40,067 --> 02:11:44,767
I find I´m so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1688
02:11:44,934 --> 02:11:48,367
I think it´s the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1689
02:11:48,467 --> 02:11:50,967
A free man at the start
of a longjourney...

1690
02:11:51,067 --> 02:11:53,067
...whose conclusion is uncertain.

1691
02:11:56,301 --> 02:11:59,201
I hope I can make it across the border.

1692
02:12:00,367 --> 02:12:02,934
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1693
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,833
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1694
02:12:10,733 --> 02:12:11,900
I hope.

1695
02:12:44,767 --> 02:12:49,267
IN MEMORY ON ALLEN GREEN
