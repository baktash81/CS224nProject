1
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,760
There's never a cop around
when you need one.

2
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,548
How much?

3
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,554
Can't say I'm crazy about the paint job.

4
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,104
How long to get an order
from the factory?

5
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,634
AII right, how much you give me
in trade for my Ford?

6
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,891
ReaIIy? Thanks a Iot,
you cheating bastard.

7
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,914
Great show. HeId over
for a third straight year.

8
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,821
Marijuana!

9
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,990
Ladies and gentlemen,
please weIcome warmly. . .

10
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,743
. . .Country Joe and the Fish .

11
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,217
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

12
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,804
We're certainly deIighted
to be here today.

13
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,807
We'd like to start oft
our portion of the show. . .

14
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:18,186
...by giving you a taste of a littIe something
we call rock 'n' soul music.

15
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,948
This is realIy beautifuI, man.

16
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,160
You know, Iike ,
you have to realize the turnabout...

17
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,496
. . .that l've gone through
in the last three days.

18
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,542
Just to look, just to see ,
just to really realize.. .

19
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,377
. . .what's really important.

20
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,631
The fact that if we can't
all live together and be happy. . .

21
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,384
...if you have to be afraid
to walk out in the street...

22
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,430
...if you have to be afraid
to smile at somebody, right?

23
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,975
What kind of a way is that
to go through this Iife?

24
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:05,233
No. They sure don't make pictures
like that anymore.

25
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,494
There is no phone ringing, damn it!

26
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,957
There is no phone.

27
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,295
My God' it's almost dark.

28
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,549
They'll be waking up soon.

29
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,146
Penthouse, Robert, and hurry.

30
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,356
Oui , oui, sir .

31
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,257
This is your commentator,
Jonathan Matthias, with another bulIetin.

32
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,636
And now, as the Sino-Russian border war
continues to rapidly escalate . ..

33
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:47,640
. ..U .S . authorities are beginning to question
to what degree we will become involved. . .

34
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,685
. ..in what couId
swiftly grow into globaI conflict.

35
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:01,529
Abort firings. Abort firings. lnterception
will fragment the cilia-carrying missiles.

36
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,532
Repeat. Abort firings. Abort firings.

37
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,912
Interception will fragment
the cilia-carrying missiles.

38
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,099
Hi.

39
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,977
Another day, another dollar.

40
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,083
Hi, big brother. How's your ass?

41
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,378
As for you, I think it's your move .

42
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,926
Join me?

43
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,183
MiserabIe schmuck.

44
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:18,398
lsn't he? lsn't he a sullen--?

45
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,427
At it again, l see.

46
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:52,807
What'Il it be tonight?
Museum of science? Some Iibrary?

47
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,810
Poor' miserable bastards.

48
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,814
They aImost got me tonight'
you know that?

49
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,816
Yeah.

50
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,614
NeviIle' come out.

51
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,198
Shut up!

52
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,331
-Neville!
-Why the heIl can't you leave me aIone?

53
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:21,502
Burn!

54
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:25,798
More books.

55
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,013
Three, brother? Are you sure?

56
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,726
-Not three.
-Three, brother.

57
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,438
Two were inside the garage
when he brought down the door.

58
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,316
We heard the shooting. Then Joshua.

59
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,486
The light. They should have
stayed cIear of the light.

60
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,114
There was no light, brother. Just the fire.

61
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,494
-Nonsense. NeviIIe can't see in the dark.
-TeII him that.

62
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,581
-Any more than we can see in the Iight.
-To heIl, he sees.

63
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,124
Good enough, he sees.

64
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:04,629
More! More! Burn it aII!

65
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,675
One creature caught.

66
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,427
Caught in a pIace
he cannot stir from in the dark.

67
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,681
AIone. Outnumbered' hundreds to one.

68
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,058
Nothing to Iive for but his memories.

69
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:22,563
Nothing to Iive with but his gadgets,
his cars' his guns' gimmicks.

70
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,567
And yet the whoIe FamiIy
can't bring him down out of that. . ..

71
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:30,488
-That--
-Honky paradise, brother?

72
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:35,034
Forget the old ways, brother.
AII your hatreds, aII your pains.

73
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,913
Forget. And remember. . .

74
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,083
. ..the FamiIy is one.

75
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,753
But him, that thing.. .

76
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,214
. ..that creature of the wheel. . .

77
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,426
. ..that Iord of the infernaI engines
and machines. . . .

78
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,351
What day is it, anyway? Monday?

79
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,522
The heII it is. lt's Sunday.

80
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,317
Sunday, l always dress for dinner.

81
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,779
Let me put the power to him, brother.
Just a little nitro.

82
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,281
-No.
-I can get the cannons. . .

83
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,991
. ..out of the oId guard armory.

84
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,202
-We couId have him out in no time.
-I said, no.

85
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,831
We couId, but then
the curse would begin aIl over again.

86
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,876
-Don't you see?
-Yes. Yes, l see.

87
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,462
l see him living high in the light. . .

88
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,299
. ..while we rot and hide Iike grubs.

89
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,927
-What do you see, brother?
-He wiII be destroyed' brother. He will.

90
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:39,766
But not by guns, not by machines,
not by the evil forbidden things...

91
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,019
. ..the tooIs that destroyed the world.

92
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,188
The world.

93
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,732
They destroyed the world.

94
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,068
The entire Los Angeles area.

95
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,404
Already hospitaI facilities have begun
to crack under the strain.. .

96
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,992
. ..and civiI-defense authorities state the
situation is the same across the country.

97
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,745
Martial law is now nationwide.

98
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,457
Major cities in alI parts of the country ,
New York, Los Angeles. . .

99
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,961
...report plague victims falIing dead
in the streets, in their homes, at work.

100
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,672
The first symptom appears to be
severe choking. . .

101
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,843
...folIowed by immediate unconsciousness.
Death occurs within minutes.

102
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,138
Whether a state of war
between China and Russia stiIl exists. . .

103
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,015
. ..is not important any Ionger.

104
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,017
Our felIow countrymen are dying.

105
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,229
The very foundations of civilization
are beginning to crumble . . .

106
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:30,358
. . .under the dread assault
of that horror Iong feared, germ warfare .

107
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,194
CONELRAD channel.
This is a class-one emergency .

108
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,072
All civilian traftic is barred
from streets and highways.

109
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,491
Stay in your homes. Stay in your homes.

110
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,745
Those found without specific miIitary
orders are subject to summary execution.

111
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,373
Stay in your homes.
Repeat. CONELRAD channel.

112
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,375
This is a class-one emergency .

113
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,461
All civilian traftic is barred
from streets and highways.

114
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:03,558
Now the question is survival.
Is this the end of technological man?

115
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:08,396
Is this the concIusion of aIl our yesterdays,
the boasts of our fabled science ...

116
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:13,151
. . .the superhuman conquests
of space and time , the age of the wheel?

117
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,611
We were warned of judgment.

118
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,238
Well...

119
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,075
. . .here it is. Here , now. . .

120
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,078
...in the form of
billions of microscopic bacilli.

121
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,664
This is the end.

122
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,001
NeviIle.

123
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,920
Yeah.

124
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,423
l see.

125
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,884
Let's try the test vaccine. . .

126
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,846
. ..93B-7 1 .

127
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,348
How the heII do l know?

128
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,226
Yeah. We'Il find out.

129
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,771
AII right, l'lI be there in an hour.

130
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:33,040
Vaccine.

131
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,726
With fire , my brothers, we have purified
all that lives with our zeal. . .

132
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,312
. . .and we shall continue with our work.

133
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:59,233
With our devotion'
we shalI cleanse the worId.

134
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:03,070
And NevilIe wiIl come down,
down to the FamiIy into judgment. . .

135
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,449
. ..down to punishment
for his blasphemies.

136
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,745
Here is the instrument of cIeansing'
my brethren.

137
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:15,041
And nothing quite cIeanses like fire .

138
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,640
l was lucky today.

139
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,062
BeIieve me, l was Iucky.

140
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,733
He tried a gambit. . .

141
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,904
. ..and it almost worked.

142
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,658
But ended up a staIemate. . .

143
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,621
. ..with the Family down three pawns.

144
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,212
What do you think his next move wiIl be?

145
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:08,803
Endgames are always
full of surprises, aren't they?

146
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,807
WelI. . .

147
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,101
. ..my move' huh?

148
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,653
Discovered check.

149
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,531
How does that grab you' Caesar?

150
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,951
Your move, imperator.

151
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,985
NeviIle.

152
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,867
Excuse me.

153
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,252
Did you move?

154
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,385
BaIls.

155
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,438
You used to be a nice guy once,
you know that?

156
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,366
And speedy Bob NevilIe'
his great legs churning. . .

157
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,702
. ..goes flashing across the finish line. . .

158
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:23,956
. ..with a three-minute-and-50-second mile.

159
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,751
Go ahead. I wanna see
some son of a bitch beat that.

160
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:37,177
This is recording 6306,
Rimini Boulevard, Sector 2.

161
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,805
Last five bIocks have been cIear.. .

162
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,267
. ..except for some signs
they've been foraging for food.. .

163
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,437
. ..in a smaII grocery store. . .

164
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,525
. ..at 5500 block.

165
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,863
You'd think the prices
wouId keep them in the supermarkets.

166
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,367
You gotta hand it to them.
They sure cover their tracks.

167
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,745
Two years.

168
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:09,877
lf l couId just find the nest,
find out where they hole up.

169
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,797
Hey!

170
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,966
Matthias!

171
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:48,053
AII right, where's Matthias?

172
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:58,981
Come on. Where's Matthias?
Where's the hive?

173
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,909
JournaI recording 958. August 5' 1 977 .

174
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:15,497
l found another one,
one of Matthias' group, dead of pIague.

175
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,000
The sweep continues.

176
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,876
Not my color.

177
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:55,282
Wait! Come back!

178
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,784
l want to taIk to you!

179
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,317
Hey!

180
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,231
ls this how it starts?

181
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,361
A trip to the Iaughing academy?

182
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,989
No, you siIly bastard.

183
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:21,868
lt starts with you
asking yourself idiot questions.

184
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,705
Right.

185
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,960
Okay.

186
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,463
Let's get cleaned up. . .

187
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,344
. ..and find a drink before the bars close.

188
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,850
And' aIl brothers and sisters,
l ask you to look at him.

189
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,020
Does he have the marks?
Do you see them?

190
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,397
No.

191
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,358
You see him as we were
before the punishment.. .

192
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,194
. ..before we gained grace.

193
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:06,032
You see Iying there the Iast of scientists,
of bankers' of businessmen. . .

194
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,867
. ..the users of the wheel.

195
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,202
Yes.

196
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,038
Do we use the tools
of the wheeI as he does?

197
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,957
No.

198
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,710
-Is he of the FamiIy?
-No.

199
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,213
-Is he of the sacred society?
-No.

200
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,383
-Then what is he?
-Evil.

201
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,721
He is part of the dead.

202
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,806
He has no place here.

203
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,518
He has the stink of oil
and electrical circuitry about him.

204
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,395
He is obsoIete.

205
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,690
You are discarded.

206
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,067
You are the refuse of the past.

207
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,362
You're fulI of crap.

208
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,243
How hard it is to admit the truth.

209
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:54,914
Take him to the IittIe room
for the questioning.

210
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:06,551
WelI' Mr. NeviIIe,
now we can talk a little whiIe.

211
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,221
lt's been a long time since you've talked,
except to yourseIf.

212
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,725
Tell me something, would you?

213
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,854
Are you feIIas reaIly with
the lnternal Revenue Service?

214
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,650
Your little jokes
are meaningless' Mr. NevilIe.

215
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:26,363
Or doctor, or coloneI,
whatever it was they caIled you.

216
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,533
-I'm a scientist. What the heIl are you?
-Definition of a scientist:

217
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:35,538
A man who understood nothing,
untiI there was nothing left to understand.

218
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,248
WelI. . . .

219
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,962
So there is a Iittle light
in the forest after all.

220
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,757
A guiding light, Mr. NeviIle.

221
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,468
But now to me
has passed the responsibiIity. . .

222
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,971
. ..for this last tiny remnant of mankind.

223
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,141
Then why don't you quit
these bloody games?

224
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:59,479
Throw away those HalIoween costumes
and get these peopIe organized' damn it.

225
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,732
Or are you aIready too far gone?

226
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,527
-Along the road of truth.
-Oh' for God's sake.

227
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,154
And we are very organized, Mr. Neville.

228
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,865
After Iast night, you should know that.

229
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,161
lf you're organized,
why don't you try finding a cure?

230
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,330
There is none!

231
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,667
None.

232
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,964
There was no cure'
and there is no cure.. .

233
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,675
. ..but the FamiIy has found its way.

234
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,343
We can bear it.

235
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,347
The onIy burden Ieft is you.

236
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,183
But you've been trying to kiII me
for two years.

237
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,519
Last night you kilIed how many?

238
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,773
Three of us?
And today, we don't know yet.

239
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,360
You're the angeI of death, doctor, not us.

240
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,510
He has confessed alI, brothers.

241
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:17,182
Murder' use of forbidden tools,
practice of prescribed rites.

242
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:22,395
He admits science, medicine' weapons,
machinery' electricity.

243
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,815
He has not shared the punishments.

244
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,652
-He does not bear the marks.
-Marks?

245
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,572
Show him, my children.

246
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,074
Show him the pretty marks.

247
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,420
These are the marks' Mr. NevilIe.

248
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:51,508
The punishment' which you
and those like you brought upon us.

249
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,428
ln the beginning we tried to heIp
one another, those that were left.

250
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,973
We tried to cIean things up,
set things straight.

251
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,226
We buried things and burned.

252
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,104
Then it came to me'
that we were chosen.

253
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,482
Chosen for just this work.

254
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,069
To bury what was dead,
to burn what was evil.. .

255
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,988
. ..to destroy what was dangerous.

256
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,699
You're barbarians.

257
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,577
Barbarians?

258
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,622
You calI us barbarian?

259
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,040
WelI. . . .

260
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,085
This is an honorabIe name.

261
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,922
We mean to canceI the world
you civiIized people made.

262
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,049
We wilI erase history from the time. . .

263
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,719
. ..that machinery and weapons
threatened more than they offered.

264
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,304
And when you die. . .

265
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,809
. ..the Iast Iiving reminder of heIl
will be gone.

266
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,352
Gone.

267
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,315
Brother Zachary.

268
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,236
We are ready, brother.

269
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:29,707
-Here is eviI.
-Evil.

270
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,417
EviI.

271
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,088
ls this not the pIace
where all the dead were burned?

272
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,923
Yes.

273
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:40,259
And this is the last of the dead.

274
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,762
And what shaII we do with him,
my brethren?

275
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,432
Burn.

276
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,144
-Burn.
-Yes, burn. Burn!

277
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,231
-Burn.
-Burn!

278
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,450
-The dark!
-Turn off the Iight!

279
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,997
Get those lights off!

280
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,212
Give us the dark!

281
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,718
Bring back the dark!

282
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,474
Who the helI are you?

283
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,852
Shut up.

284
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,730
Move.

285
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,821
He's gone!

286
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,156
Find him.

287
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,867
Find him. That's an order!

288
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,536
-Find him.
-Go' man, go!

289
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,748
Move. Move.

290
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,791
-Wait.
-Get in.

291
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:05,094
AII right, you son of a bitch, just hold tight.
Up against the wall, you mother.

292
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,223
Don't turn. Just stand.
When l want you to' l'll turn you.

293
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,185
On or off' up or around, I'II turn you.
Now cooI it.

294
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,103
Now' put your hands out. Out.

295
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,440
Way out about shouIder high,
like they're gonna crucify you' baby.

296
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,485
Matter of fact, they were gonna roast me.
Why'd you stop them?

297
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,237
Don't Iook a gift horse in the mouth.

298
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,991
You got any more questions, fathead?

299
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,285
My name is Robert.

300
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,038
Your name's mud.

301
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,372
Down the tunnel!

302
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,541
-Down the tunneI!
-Where is he?

303
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,213
After him!

304
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,391
Back!

305
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,481
Okay, hey, hold it. Open it up.

306
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,277
-You. You're the--
-Your Iiving PIaytex doIl.

307
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:06,405
Now' come on, man. Get the bike.
Move! PuII it out.

00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,117
-You reaIly pIan ahead.
-It helps.

309
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:14,413
Now' look, you gotta run this thing'
you understand, but l'm the ramrod.

310
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,750
Those stadium lights'
how'd you manage that?

311
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,753
-Dutch knows all about that stuff.
-Dutch?

312
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,880
Come on, man. Get on the bike.

313
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:33,808
Don't screw up. l know how to roII,
but it's hard on the eIbows.

314
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,103
And if you just have to pIay
James Bond. . .

315
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,522
. ..l'lI bust your ass.

316
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,524
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,909
Don't Iet him get away!

318
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,632
Left, damn it, Ieft, and step on it!

319

Move! Down the tunneI, man.

321
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,862
Hit it. They're blinded.

322
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,491
Okay, baby. Hitch up your drawers.

323
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,532
-I thought we'd gotten past that.
-You're sweet.

324
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,283
lt's okay, Tommy.

325
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,786
This is the man, and l mean the man.

326
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,247
But he's cool. lt's okay.

327
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,709
Come on, man.

328
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,920
This is it. That's alI there is.

329
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,465
At least alI we know of.

330
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:56,886
There are others, l guess, if Matthias
and his brethren haven't kiIled them aIl.

331
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,639
l didn't know there were any left.

332

Between the Family at night
and you in the daytime. . .

333

. ..shooting at anything that moved,
man' we had to stay low.

334
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,325
l had to stay alive.

335
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,803
The mad bomber himself.

336
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,639
And l see you got the mad scientist.

337
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,433
-You know me?
-And about your work.

338
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,976

00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,827
Microbiological Letters,
January, 1 975. Remember?

343
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,164
That's a nice recitation.
You know what it means?

344
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,000
l was a med-school senior
when they scratched the worId.

345
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:14,547
As a matter of fact, l was gonna appIy
to Biowar Labs for my post-doc. . .

346
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:18,092
-. . .but the next term never came.
-I'm sorry you didn't make it.

347
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,136
Sorry the worId didn't make it.

348
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,055
-Come on. Let's go see about Richie.
-Richie?

349
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,559
Lisa's brother. He Iooks Iike
he's about to go over.

350
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,897
You've only seen the tertiary cases,
Matthias and his peopIe.

351
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:35,067
We're not that far gone'
but we're on the road.

352
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,821
The yeIlow-brick road.
We're off to see the wizard.

353
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:43,075
When it hit, the oIder people either died
or went to the third stage fast. . .

354
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,954
. ..you know, blindness in light,
aIbinism' psychotic iIlusions. . .

355
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:51,250
. ..occasionaI stages of torpor'
like Matthias and the things out there.

356
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:55,087
-What about you? Why didn't you get it?
-I don't know.

357
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,549
Some of the younger peopIe
have a kind of. . .

358
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,885
. ..resistance.

359
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:04,680
l don't know, we just hold out.

360
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,018
One or two of us are a bit light-sensitive ,
but otherwise we're aII right.

361
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,145
But Richie's definitely going.

362
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,273
He's advanced secondary. lncidentaIly. . .

363
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,609
. ..mind telling me
what keeps you in the city?

364
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,737
You some kind of. . .exterminator, huh?

365
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,574
l guess maybe you couId call it that.

366
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,618
Very compIicated' doctor.

367
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:29,538
l'd be Iiving on top of city halI'
or better than that, the Oxy Tower.. .

368
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,624
. ..instead of that pillbox you're in.

369
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,585
WelI' that's where l Iive.
lt's where l used to live.

370
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:38,130
lt's where l'm gonna Iive'
and not Matthias nor his FamiIy. . .

371
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,883
. ..nor any other son of a bitch
is gonna make me Ieave.

372
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,430
He's no better.

373
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,974
His fever is high.

374
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,035
-What are you doing--?
-Shut up.

375
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,954
Keep out of the way.

376
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,500
Sit down.

377
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,680
CouId stay this way for weeks'
or he couId go over 1 0 minutes from now.

378
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,306
l've seen them go before .

379
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,435
l almost got kilIed by a friend of mine
last summer.

380
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,063
He went over without any warning.

381
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,023
When l looked away. . .

382
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:42,695
. ..his face was getting pale and his hair
was going. When l Iooked back.. .

383
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,656
. ..he didn't have any eyes.

384
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,325
What did you do?

385
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,037
l did just like you'd do, doctor.
l killed him.

386
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,541
lf the Masonic rites are over. . .

387
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,543
. ..bow about Richie?

388
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:14,059
We'lI take him to my pIace.
l got nearIy everything l need there.

389
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,562
ls there anything you can do, doctor?

390
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,482
l mean, seeing how you've lost
over 200 miIlion patients.

391
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,360
l don't have it.

392
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:27,823
-Have what?
-The pIague. l'm immune.

393
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,953
-Everybody has it.
-Everybody but me.

394
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,165
There was a vaccine'
just an experimentaI batch.

395
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,375
We weren't sure it'd work.

396
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,758
-Why, if you're immune' you couId--
-That's right.

397
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,093
My bIood might be a serum.

398
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:53,182
At the stage that boy's in, my antibodies
could reverse the whoIe process, stop it.

399
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,351
Christ, you could save the worId.

400
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,686
Screw the worId. Let's save Richie.

401
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,611
Nothing with drugs.
lt's gotta be the serum.

402
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,155
CouIdn't you reconstitute the vaccine?

403
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,366
You got any idea
how many steps it takes. . .

404
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,370
. ..to synthesize an antibiotic
specific for this bug?

405
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,998
-Got the picture.
-I've tried. God knows I've tried.

406
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:21,126
Once I caught one
of Matthias' peopIe Iast year. . .

407
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,296
. . .and tried everything
on the shelves on him.

408
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,645
He damn near killed me ...

409
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,314
...and then he died very badly himseIf.

410
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,484
So it's very tight' doctor.

411
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,861
Very tight.

412
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,676
Bring him in here.

413
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,806
ln the bed.

414
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,270
l see where you do your heavy thinking.

415
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,939
One side keeps the other side going.

416
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,567
Can't have one without the other.

417
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,579
-I'm a narcissist.
-How do you do?

418
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:45,210
-The guest room.
-You weren't expecting us?

419
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,255
l wasn't expecting you.

420
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,843
WelI' hold these.

421
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,891
l'm gonna need some heIp.

422
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,560
Lisa wiIl have to do you.

423
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,605
l hate to Ieave the kids aIone too long.
They get spooked.

424
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,773
Hey, watch your mouth.

425
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,952
You know, some of the kids'
you know what they say?

426
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,288
No. What do some of the kids say?

427
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,666
They say the Family comes
in the night when it's dark.

428
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,920
They say they're going to come
some night and take Richie's souI. . .

429
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,839
. ..and tie it aII up in a bag
and give it to the devil.

430
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,801
ls that realIy true?
Do you know if that's reaIly true?

431
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,763
No. We wouIdn't let that happen.

432
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,098
Not a chance.

433
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,977
Are you God?

434
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:52,236
Let's find out if he's even a doctor first
before we go promoting him' okay?

435
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,904
Okay.

436
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,689
How about a break?

437
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,028
WelI.

438
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,057
Your move.

439
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,602
l just made my move.

440
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,500
Where'd you get that dress?

441
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:16,088
The same place you got that jacket.
l hustled it.

442
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,050
The house fuzz was on vacation.

443
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:29,643
NeviIle.

444
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,775
His voice.

445
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,986
l'Il never get used to it. . .

446
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,114
. ..to hearing it.

447
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,576
Something.. . .

448
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,997
We were with them for a while'
you know?

449
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,999
With Matthias?

450
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:56,044
You were a part of that Family?

451
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:00,090
When it happened'
when even the Army felI apart. . .

452
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:04,261
. ..and there was nobody left
except those Iiving aIone like animaIs. . .

453
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,640
. ..Matthias waIked the streets at night. . .

454
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,560
. ..ringing a beIl.

455
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:17,983
Richie and l' we had us a pIace
in the back of a furniture store .

456
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,902
One day' we hear this belI.

457
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:25,073
So we go out to see'
and there are peopIe there.

458
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,825
We thought we were alone. . .

459
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:30,328
. ..just me and Richie
with milIions of corpses.

460
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:34,124
But there was Matthias and other peopIe.

461
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:40,714
WelI' anyway,
he gave us the FamiIy for a whiIe.

462
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,549
We helped with the buriaIs.

463
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,676
We helped with the burnings.

464
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,846
But when it was over,
and the worst was past. . .

465
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:53,143
. ..they began to know
how different we were, our skin, our eyes.

466
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:57,773
One day whiIe they were asIeep,
we just took off.

467
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,529
How'd you get mixed up
with Dutch and his group?

468
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:10,869
Dutch came by one day
and said he was with the Census Bureau.

469
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:25,175
-Now, what you thinking?
-Yeah.

470
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,389
WelI' you know the oId song?

471
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:35,560
"lf you were the only girl in the world
and l were the only boy"' okay. . .

472
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:38,063
. ..but until then don't bother me?

473
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,234
l guess l'm the onIy boy.

474
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,165
The FamiIy.

475
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,960
God, l forgot to keep the fueI up
in the generator.

476
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,212
They'll be into the garage!

477
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,972
You stay here.

478
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,141
-What's this for?
-Comfort.

479
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,480
You may not have time, Brother Zachary.

480
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:04,900
More time than Neville has, brother.

481
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,986
-When he comes back up, l'Il be waiting.
-Take care.

482
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,614
-He has the luck of a deviI.
-I know.

483
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:13,283
But this time his luck has run out.

484
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,350
Robert!

485
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:43,118
You can take down
that service fIag now' mother.

486
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,370
Man' don't scare me Iike that.

487
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,548
-You alI right?
-Yeah.

488
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,258
Yeah, l'm okay.

489
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,475
Now' what's this stuff about me being
the onIy girl in the worId?

490
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:31,040
Do you know it's been a long' Iong time?

491
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:33,877
l'm not sure I remember how this goes.

492
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:56,149
-How is he?
-He's stable.

493
01:09:56,317 --> 01:10:01,446
No loss of pigment since yesterday
and vitaI signs are steady.

494
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,365
He's comfortabIe.

495
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,663
l'm sorry.

496
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,625
lt's been a long' long time
since l've had a patient.

497
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:17,253
WelI' doctor, you certainly haven't Iost
your bedside manner.

498
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,964
ls that so?

499
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,112
Are you ready for this?

500
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,031
What is it?

501
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:48,076
Birth-controI piIIs.

502
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,917
Yeah.

503
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,003
Here we are.

504
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,381
l can make toxins from both of these.

505
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,943
AII right, now the tourniquet.

506
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,281
Good and tight.

507
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,954
That's fine.

508
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:58,790
Give me the swab.

509
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,005
AII right, you get the needle.

510
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:14,013
Go ahead.

511
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,772
AII right, take off the tourniquet.

512
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,574
WilI one bottIe be enough?

513
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:37,662
lt's genuine' 1 60-proof
oId Anglo-Saxon' baby.

514
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:44,794
l was a very pecuIiar doctor
in those days. . .

515
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:48,172
. ..trying to find treatments
for diseases that hadn't existed. . .

516
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,842
. ..tilI other doctors invented them.

517
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:54,011
Now l'm the only game in town.

518
01:13:56,765 --> 01:14:00,560
l don't know how much.
l'Il draw bIood as often as l can.

519
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:03,354
We'lI just have to keep
pumping it into him.

520
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:07,316
-How Iong do you think it'lI take?
-I don't know.

521
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:09,610
l reaIIy don't know.

522
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,028
But if it does work. . .

523
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:14,615
. ..then Richie wilI be the source
of even more antibodies.

524
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:17,743
The more peopIe we inject. . .

525
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:20,413
. ..the more serum we'II get.

526
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,750
And when that's done. . . .

527
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:29,088
When that's done' baby' we wilI pulI out.

528
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:32,008
We'lI take what we need
and head for the mountains.

529
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:36,637
Out of rats' aIley
Where the dead men lost their bones

530
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:41,726
T.S . Eliot turns out to have been
just as good a prophet as he was a poet.

531
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:47,940
"The Waste Land."

532
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,401
l wonder if it comforts him.

533
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:54,906
l wonder if I'II ever see
a stream fuIl of fish again.

534
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:58,659
Where'd you ever see
a stream fuIl of fish in Harlem?

535
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,037
At the movies.

536
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:13,966
-Does that hurt?
-A little, yeah.

537
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:19,180
lt hurts. How about off, man? Turn it off.

538
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:24,727
A week ago' that much Iight
wouId have sent you right up the wall.

539
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:29,398
l'm beginning to see the light.

540
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:36,489
l'Il have another batch of serum ready
in a few hours. . .

541
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:39,784
. ..then we'lI load up that Land Rover'
pick up Dutch and the kids. . .

542
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,078
. ..and go to the hills.
How about the Sierras?

543
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,454
Yeah. Oh, Robert.

544
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,165
Baby' we made it. We reaIIy made it.

545
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,418
l think l'lI go pick up
some stuff for the trip.

546
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:54,465
ls there anything special
you fancy, baby?

547
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:58,803
What l pick up today, you're gonna
be seeing for a Iong' long time.

548
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,138
-Why don't you skip it?
-Oh' honey.

549
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:05,142
The most dangerous thing l ever ran into
in one of those stores was you.

550
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,478
You watch yourself.

551
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:11,482
You stay on the ground fIoors,
near the doors and in the Iight.

552
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:15,486
-If you see anything, shoot.
-Check.

553
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,489
Honey' can l borrow your credit cards?

554
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:43,180
ls that gonna be for me?

555
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:45,725
No, you don't need any more.

556
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:48,561
This is for Lisa.

557
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:51,981
-One of these days, she may--
-Start to turn?

558
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:54,275
That's always a possibility.

559
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:57,278
lt's best to catch these things early.

560
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:02,158
Then you don't think
the serum would work...

561
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,036
. ..for tertiary cases?

562
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,538
-What do you mean?
-Like Matthias.

563
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,373
The FamiIy.

564
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,334
lt's hard to say.

565
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:13,878
WelI' wouId it?

566
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,088
Come on, help me with this.

567
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:23,304
Put the cap on that.
Put it in the refrigerator.

568
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:34,398
l can't afford to give more bIood
tilI l get clear of this town.

569
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:40,571
Later on, if your bIood count comes up. . .

570
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:44,742
. ..and you put on some weight,
we can use your bIood to make serum.

571
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,578
Yeah?

572
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,165
Yeah. Now' go eat your soup.

573
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,907
You know, someone ought to do
something about those people.

574
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:27,993
How about it?

575
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:30,538
-You gonna give them the serum?
-Fat chance.

576
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,123
How come?

577
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:35,042
We'd have to be here
for a few more months' for one thing.

578
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,087
For another thing,
they're homicidal maniacs, for God's sakes.

579
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:42,174
Hey, man' they're humans.
l mean, they're sick' you know?

580
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:43,884
They're vermin.

581
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,387
Okay, then.

582
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,681
lf you don't want to cure them, kill them.

583
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:50,808
lf l just knew where they're at.

584
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,728
The oId court buiIding' that's where.

585
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,483
ln the civic center.

586
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:01,861
That's where they're holed up.

587
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,489
-You're kidding me.
-They're there.

588
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:13,164
WelI' go on. Ain't you gonna
go down there and zap them?

589
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,749
Why not?

590
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:19,003
You've been looking to kiII them
for practicalIy two whole years now.

591
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,839
Either kiIl them or cure them, damn it.

592
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:30,765
No need.

593
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:36,061
They're haIf-dead right now.

594
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,439
You know what' mister?

595
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,983
You're hostiIe.

596
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,028
You just don't beIong.

597
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,614
Nice of you to Iet me hang around.

598
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:51,327
At times' you scare me
more than Matthias does.

599
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,814
Hey, Dutch.

600
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:24,568
-How's Richie?
-Beautiful. lt works.

601
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:26,445
lt works. It works?

602
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,197
lt works!

603
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,744
lt works. It works!

604
01:20:34,412 --> 01:20:35,996
lt works.

605
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:39,208
Oh' my God' it's a beautiful worId.

606
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,252
Don't you think
we ought to do something?

607
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:42,545
Damn right.

608
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:44,839
l've got some blood
to make up serum for Lisa.

609
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:48,050
We'lI start on the rest of you
in a week or so.

610
01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:51,595
Can you have the kids ready
to leave tomorrow?

611
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:10,322
Gonna take me a Iittle ride in the sun.

612
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,617
Where are we going?

613
01:21:13,785 --> 01:21:17,037
Away' that's aII. Just away.

614
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:20,916
SomepIace nobody ever bothered with.
A river nobody ever dammed. . .

615
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:23,627
. ..a mountain nobody built
any bIoody freeways to. . .

616
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:26,589
. ..where everything we do
will be the first time it happened.

617
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:30,426
Hey, yeah, you got it. That's it.
Just Iike in the beginning of the world.

618
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:34,305
Like we were starting aIl over again
in the Garden of Eden.

619
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:38,350
Only this time'
we don't trust no frigging snake.

620
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,490
Richie?

621
01:21:54,784 --> 01:21:57,328
Scout' l wonder if we're gonna have
room for you.

622
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:59,413
Richie.

623
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,963
"Going to find out who's right.

624
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:11,216
You or me."

625
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:46,020
WelI' Richard. . .

626
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:48,814
-. . .why are you here?
-I came to help you.

627
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,566
-You know the man.
-Neville?

628
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:51,775
That's him, yeah.

629
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,278
He's got a serum
for what's wrong with you.

630
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,573
And if you could just taIk to him,
get with him. . .

631
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,825
. ..then everybody could be. . . .

632
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,120
Yes? Everybody couId be what?

633
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,830
Everyone. . . .

634
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:07,750
WelI' everybody could be normaI again.

635
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:09,460
l see.

636
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:12,963
-We couId be as we were before?
-Yeah, l guess so.

637
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,632
-The way we were.
-The way we were.

638
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,427
That's what NevilIe thinks we want?
That why he sent you?

639
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:21,513
-He didn't send me. He--
-SiIence!

640
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:23,098
Oh' yes. . .

641
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:26,018
. ..he sent you to offer us something
from his world. . .

642
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:30,189
. ..to change us back
to the creatures we were. A trick!

643
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:33,400
A trick to weaken our resolve.

644
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:36,737
l was aImost Iike you, but he saved me.
He brought me back.

645
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:38,947
He wants us all to go away from here .

646
01:24:39,115 --> 01:24:41,325
You have been damned' Richard.

647
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,994
Don't you see that? Don't you?

648
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:47,915
Prepare the Family.

649
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:52,169
Tonight. . .

650
01:24:53,129 --> 01:24:55,839
. ..l think Neville might come out.

651
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,883
Tonight.

652
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:05,265
Tonight. Tonight.

653
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:07,601
The FamiIy is one.

654
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:11,980
The FamiIy is all.

655
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:17,069
We have cleansed the world.

656
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:34,044
Outside the Family,
there is nothing at aII.

657
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:38,423
-The Family.
-The Family.

658
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:43,804
We have cleansed the world.

659
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:52,229
Outside the Family,
there is nothing at aII.

660
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:58,921
Oh' my God.

661
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:18,935
Lisa?

662
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:22,439
Lisa.

663
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,608
Yes, Robert.

664
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:29,112
Lisa, about Richie.. . .

665
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:31,281
l know' Robert.

666
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:32,783
You know?

667
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:37,621
Matthias toId me.

668
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:40,582
lt was necessary.

669
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,793
My God.

670
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:47,464
Lisa.

671
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,342
Come in, Neville.

672
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:52,969
Sounds strange' doesn't it?

673
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:55,138
"Come in' Neville."

674
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:27,796
l thought we might arrange
a little entertainment for you. ..

675
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:31,842
. ..before time for concluding
our little business.

676
01:30:34,178 --> 01:30:35,303
My brothers.

677
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:32,277
We waited for you, Neville. . .

678
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:35,614
