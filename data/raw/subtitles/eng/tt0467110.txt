Why don't you come home With me? Huh?

<i>Look, I may not be able
to smell a bomb,</i>

185

- [Boy] Please excuse Jack Unger

187
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:52,229
from any and all activity
because he has a bad cold.

188
00:11:52,306 --> 00:11:54,536
No, too simplistic.

189
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:57,403
He has shingles.

190
00:11:57,478 --> 00:11:59,503
No, I already used that.

191
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,946
Come on, Jack. Dig deep.

192

Perfect.

[Dan] Hey, Jack,

00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,827
- Yeah.
- Come on out back.

196
00:12:14,895 --> 00:12:17,523
- I can't. I'm busy.
- AW, come on.

197
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:19,156
I got something to shoW you.

198

Hey, Jack. Look.

202
00:12:29,944 --> 00:12:32,708
- You bought a dog?
- No, I didn't buy him.

203
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,112
I, uh, I found him on the street.

204
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:37,480
He's cute, isn't he?

205
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:41,009
I thought maybe We'd go for Walks,
take him on a hike.

206
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:42,749
Hikes? Oh, fun.

207
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:49,195
Hey, look at that. I think
We should call him... Shoeshine.

208
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:53,290
Considering all the other
things he probably licks,

209
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,597
I think that's the best call.

210
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:58,399
Jack, I just thought
he Would be good for you.

211
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:00,906
Take your mind off a feW things.

212
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,443
Listen, I'm telling you
I am fine, all right?

213
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:05,536
- OK.
- You don't have to keep doing this.

214
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:09,606
You've got other things to Worry about,
like being a prison guard to lab rats.

215
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,481
You know What?
I like the neW job.

216

[Phone ringing]

217
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:24,260
If you don't Want the dog, I'll
take him to the pound this afternoon.

218
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:28,126
[Door opens and closes]

No, no, I'll come back.
All right. Thank you.

221
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:39,643
I got to go back to Work.

222
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:42,944
- What about Shoelick?
- Shoeshine.

223
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:45,611
Listen, do me a favor.
Keep an eye on him.

224
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:48,177
You know What?
Give him a chance.

225
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:51,418
- You might even like him.
- I don't think so.

226
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:54,586
All he does is eat, sleep and poop.

227
00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:57,028
Then the two of you
have a lot in common, don't you?

228
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:13,469
<i>[Barsinister] I can isolate specific
protein strands in animal DNA.</i>

229
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:17,347
<i>Then combine them any way I want.</i>

230
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:20,216

the speed of a cheetah,</i>

231

<i>the ability to fly like an eagle,</i>

232

<i>or the strength of an animal
one hundred times his weight.</i>

233
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,324
Forging a doctor's note, Jack?
Is this What it's come to?

234
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,560
I didn't forge it.

235
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:38,662
So, you expect me to believe
that you have... "monkeypox?"

236
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:41,572
[Coughing] It's pretty bad.

237
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:43,701
OK.

238
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:47,008
I don't know What disappoints me more,
the fact that you did it,

239
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:51,279
or that you did so poorly that
you couldn't even fool a P.E. Teacher.

240
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:56,312

<i>It's not dog food, but it's about to be.</i>

245
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:16,204
<i>Oh, no.</i>

246
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:18,211

340
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:13,290
Got me fired from my last job.

341
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,631
That's ridiculous.
Come on, just try it.

342
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:17,533
Smelling makes me nervous, and I...

343
00:21:17,604 --> 00:21:20,471
Ah... ah... ah-choo!

344
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:28,277
Glad I didn't try
to hold that one in.

345
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:30,475
I Would have bloWn my brains
out of my ears.

346
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,575
OK. Um, What are they saying?

347
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:36,448
[Indistinct voices becoming clearer]

348
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:39,822
[Girl]... When I talk like that.
I'm not gonna spend...

349
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:41,417
I know. We'll talk later. Bye.

350
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:45,091
Catch the ball
right in the Web of the glove.

351
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,562
Maybe We should see other people.

352
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:52,469
He thinks it Would be better
if they saW other people.

353
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,030
She says for all she cares

- People eat that, too?
- [Chuckles]

[Crying] Help! Let me go.

356

359
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:11,016
Hey! Wait.

360
00:22:11,091 --> 00:22:14,618
- SloW doWn.

00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:16,822
- [Tires screeching]
- [Horns honking]

362
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:21,296
This is incredible.
I've never run this fast before.

363
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:25,099

even touching the ground...

- YeoW!
- [Horns honking]

Whoo!

370
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:49,992

sticking your head out of a moving car.

371
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:52,861
- Whoo hoo!
- [Truck horn honking]

372

Excuse me. Out of the Way.

377

Ahhh!

385

[Molly] Hello? 911?

386
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:15,677
[Murmuring]

387
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:26,014
Uh-huh. Someone just
sWooped in and saved you?

388
00:24:26,092 --> 00:24:28,526
You think you could describe him?

389
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:31,257
Yes. He was White.

390
00:24:34,968 --> 00:24:38,904

391
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:42,567
- OK, so he's a Caucasian?
- Actually, I think he was broWn.

392
00:24:42,642 --> 00:24:46,169
He was light broWn With White spots
on his belly, paWs and tail.

393
00:24:46,246 --> 00:24:49,511
He had black Whiskers,
broWn eyes and a Wet nose.

394
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,380
Like this?

395
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:57,489

- Shoeshine, you here?
- [Whimpering]

397
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:06,492
Sorry, Jack.

398
00:25:06,566 --> 00:25:08,625
I didn't mean to break those cars

399
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:11,500
or those garbage cans or that building.

400
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:13,436
Shoeshine, you're a hero.

401
00:25:13,507 --> 00:25:15,873
No, I don't Want to be a hero.
I'll screW it up.

402
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:18,843
Trust me on this one.

403
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:25,077
[Sighs] I just Wanted a home,
a place Where I belonged.

404
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:28,450
Just because I have these poWers
doesn't make me a hero.

405
00:25:28,522 --> 00:25:32,185
Shoeshine, it depends
on What you do With them.

406
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:36,093
Maybe. But promise me,
no one can find out.

407
00:25:36,162 --> 00:25:39,029
- Not even your dad.
- Oh, my dad.

408
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,260
Easy. Easy.

409
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:43,063
Do you see a tennis ball anywhere?

410
00:25:43,136 --> 00:25:44,899
[Doorbell rings]

411
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:46,905
Just put it in the corner.

412
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:49,908
You know, traditionally,
the dog makes the mess

413
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:51,967
and the human cleans it up.

414
00:25:54,114 --> 00:25:57,447
I'm looking for my beagle.
He, uh, does tricks and stuff.

415
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,854
I'm... I'm sorry. I haven't seen him.

416

[Crashing]

417
00:26:07,794 --> 00:26:11,628
- What was that?
- That was my, um... my grandpa.

418
00:26:11,698 --> 00:26:15,998
He's blind, and We're just
rearranging the furniture.

419
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:19,334
- Are you all right in there, Gramps?
- Who you calling Gramps?

420
00:26:19,406 --> 00:26:21,533
Get back in here
and help me move the couch.

421
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:25,039
[Crashing]

422
00:26:30,684 --> 00:26:33,915
You're making your blind
grandfather move a couch?

423
00:26:33,987 --> 00:26:37,286
It was either that
or repave the driveWay. His choice.

424
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:38,824
Good luck finding your dog.

425
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:46,830
- Do you belong to that guy?
- What? Me? No.

426
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:49,932
- Then Who was he?
- HoW should I know?

427
00:26:50,003 --> 00:26:51,664
All you humans look alike.

428
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:56,134
Oh, it's my dad.

429
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:58,769
OK. I'm going to go
out there and stall him,

430
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:02,076
and you try and make things
look as normal as possible in here.

431
00:27:02,148 --> 00:27:05,083
Talking dog Will try
to make things normal. Check.

432
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:14,256
[Sighs] All clean.

433
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:17,626
- Dad, Dad, hey.
- Hey, hoW are you? What's up?

434
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:22,225
- Do you need help?
- Sure, yeah. Thanks.

435
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:25,066
Wait. I'm going to put these inside,

436
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:27,265
and then We're going to go for a Walk.

437
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,399
A Walk?

438
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:31,603
You and me are going to go for a Walk?

439
00:27:31,678 --> 00:27:35,079
Yeah. You know, just chill, talk?

440
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:36,479
Hang out?

441
00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:39,474
OK. Come on.

442
00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:45,414
What happened there?

443
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:49,325
- [Jack] Dad, Wait.
- [Dan] No, Jack.

444
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,330
- What?
- [Glass breaking]

445
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:02,873
Yeah, hang out.

446
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:06,173
- Dad, look, I can explain.
- Don't tell me the dog did it.

447
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:08,972
We'll talk about it later.

448
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:11,017
I'm going to take that dog to the pound.

449
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:15,214
Dad, no! No, please.
I Want to keep him.

450
00:28:15,288 --> 00:28:17,188
You told me you didn't Want the dog.

451
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:18,554
Me? No Way.

452
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:21,389
I told you I've Wanted a dog
since I was, like, eight.

453
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,993
[Whimpering]

454
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:36,064
All right, but it's your responsibility.

455
00:28:36,142 --> 00:28:39,134
You got to feed it, brush it, Walk it.
You got to train it.

456
00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:42,704
Trust me, Dad. This dog Will do things
that Will bloW your mind.

457
00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:52,090
- [Dan] This better be chili.
- [GroWls]

458
00:28:54,728 --> 00:28:56,719
[Rats squeaking]

459
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:03,564
[Barsinister] Yes. Yes, brilliant.

460
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:12,238
Already the flames of inspiration

461
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:15,247
are licking at my brain.

462
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:17,542
Unencumbered,

463
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:22,714
in this, my neW laboratory.

464
00:29:23,723 --> 00:29:27,659
- Kind of smells like a men's room.
- So much the better.

465
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:30,560
It seems like the Wrong vibe
for our Work.

466
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,655
Seems a little precocious.

467
00:29:32,732 --> 00:29:36,293
- Perspicacious.
- What?

468
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:39,065
Peppery? Prim?

469
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:43,769
Most of my thesaurus
burned up in the fire.

470
00:29:43,843 --> 00:29:45,811
All I've got left are the P's.

471
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:50,339
- Perfect.
- Ooh. That's a good one.

472
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:51,940
Can I use that?

473
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:56,352
The material I require
is going to be expensive.

474
00:29:56,422 --> 00:30:01,917
We're going to need to find Ways
to subsidize my Work.

475
00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:05,624
I know some guys Who just
got out of the clink Who can help us.

476
00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:10,563
Perhaps. Bam!

477
00:30:10,637 --> 00:30:13,731
- Ahhh!
- Nailed it.

478
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,331
<i>Jack and I became good buddies.</i>

479
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:20,277
<i>For the first time in my life,
I really felt like Man's Best Friend.</i>

480
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:23,281
[Man] Hot dogs, nice and hot!

481
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:25,317
Come on.
Bite into a nice juicy hot dog.

482
00:30:25,385 --> 00:30:27,182
What? What?

483
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:31,186
Oh, my gosh, they're made of dog!

484
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:32,986
Are you people crazy?

485
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,784
Shoeshine, come here.

486
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:38,387
It's not real dog.

487
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:41,058
- What is it then?
- It's just animal parts.

488
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:43,500
You know, like noses,
hooves, intestines.

489
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,561
Well, in that case, I'll take two.

490
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:48,698
Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
That's What I got!

491
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:52,336
Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
Nice and hot!

492
00:30:52,412 --> 00:30:55,381
- Why is he talking like that?
- He's rhyming.

493
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:59,009
It's a gimmick.
To get people's attention.

494
00:30:59,085 --> 00:31:02,213
That seems like a strange convention
for you to mention.

495
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:07,620
And this is Where I'm bored
out of my mind, eight hours a day.

496
00:31:07,694 --> 00:31:10,390
Whenever I'm bored
I just chase my tail.

497
00:31:10,463 --> 00:31:12,431
If you're lucky
you throW up and bingo!

498
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:13,726
Lunch, part two.

499
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,064
- Nice.
- What?

500
00:31:17,937 --> 00:31:20,997
Sticks, balls, and running in one game?

501
00:31:21,074 --> 00:31:24,202
- So clever. So inspired.
- Not our team.

502
00:31:24,277 --> 00:31:26,472
We're alWays the underdogs.

503
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:29,913
Never heard of that breed.
Is that a dog from Australia?

504
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:31,712
No. Look,

505
00:31:31,784 --> 00:31:34,719
an underdog is someone
Who has been counted out

506
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:37,347
and nobody expects them to Win.

507
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:41,189
- Yeah, I know the feeling. Huh?
- [Cat meoWs]

508
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:44,162
[Shoeshine] There goes the neighborhood.

You're right. A flying dog

846
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:41,782
[Dan] The seWers lead
into this drainage into the complex.

847
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,192
If you have access
to any of the seWer systems,

848
00:51:44,262 --> 00:51:46,230
you can get anywhere in the city.

849
00:51:46,298 --> 00:51:49,096
Even Dr. Barsinister knows that.

850
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:51,465
[Humming]

851
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:58,373
Oh, hey, Jack. HoW's it going?

852
00:51:58,443 --> 00:52:01,241
- Where have you been all night?
- I don't sniff and tell.

853
00:52:02,147 --> 00:52:04,581
- Hey, Shoeshine.
- Woof! Woof!

854
00:52:05,951 --> 00:52:08,442
Hey, um, We're going to
head to the park.

855
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,647
You know,
teach some tricks, do training.

856
00:52:10,722 --> 00:52:12,314
Cool. Mind if I come?

857
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,791
Um, you know,
it's probably better if We Went alone,

858
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:20,025
because it's good
for his concentration.

859
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:22,530
Son.

860
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:25,796
You know, We got to try here.

861
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:28,135
I got to go.

862
00:52:29,141 --> 00:52:31,234
[Door opens and shuts]

863
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:34,005
You know, Jack,
that was really nice of your dad.

864
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,309
- Why did you bloW him off like that?
- What?

865
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:39,316
Your dad is reaching out to you,
and you keep pushing him aWay.

866
00:52:39,384 --> 00:52:43,377
- I've been pushing everyone aWay.
- Maybe it's time to stop.

867
00:52:47,392 --> 00:52:49,883
You're right. I should
talk to him about it.

868
00:52:51,596 --> 00:52:53,257
HoW did you get so smart, anyway?

869
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:56,027
Genetic engineering.
You should try it.

870
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:02,129
Oh, look! Dad is home.

871
00:53:02,207 --> 00:53:05,370
- Where's Jack?
- Don't Worry.

872
00:53:06,511 --> 00:53:09,912
We haven't done anything to him... yet.

873
00:53:13,852 --> 00:53:15,285
- Hi.
- Hey.

874
00:53:15,353 --> 00:53:18,049
So, did you dig anything up
about the break-in?

875
00:53:18,123 --> 00:53:20,387
- I got a map from my dad.
- Hey, hoW's it going?

876
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:23,393
Shoeshine, you Wouldn't
believe the date I had last night.

877
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:25,292
It was so amazing!

878
00:53:25,363 --> 00:53:28,196
- [Sighs] Yeah, it was.
- What?

879
00:53:28,266 --> 00:53:30,359
I mean, it was?

880
00:53:30,435 --> 00:53:33,404
Can you keep a secret?
I Went out With Underdog.

881
00:53:33,471 --> 00:53:36,702
Really? I hear he's shorter in person.

882
00:53:36,775 --> 00:53:39,744
He is not.
He's quite strapping and such a charmer.

883
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:41,039
Hmm.

884
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:43,407
- A drainage pipe?
- Yeah.

885
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:46,177
They could've entered
directly through the seWers.

886
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:50,585
I Want him back. I Want his poWer.

887
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:53,248
My dog is not Underdog.

888
00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:57,625
You seem to have a knack
for underestimating the exceptional.

889
00:53:59,064 --> 00:54:00,656
You're insane!

890
00:54:00,732 --> 00:54:03,860
I prefer the term "visionary!"

891
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:10,905
Call your dog or I'll call mine.

892
00:54:17,682 --> 00:54:20,242
Or I'll call mine.

893
00:54:21,953 --> 00:54:24,444
Cad...

894
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,353
Oh, right, the dogs.

895
00:54:26,424 --> 00:54:32,021
Simon says, "Surround the sad ex-cop. "

896
00:54:32,097 --> 00:54:34,258
Simon says, "Convince. "

897
00:54:34,332 --> 00:54:37,597
[Barking]

898
00:54:37,669 --> 00:54:39,364
All right, all right.

899
00:54:39,437 --> 00:54:40,961
Shoeshine!

900
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:44,908
[Dan] Shoeshine!

901
00:54:44,976 --> 00:54:46,910
Hey, um, I got to go.

902
00:54:46,978 --> 00:54:49,742
[Barks three times]

903
00:54:49,814 --> 00:54:52,476
Hey, um, I got to go.

904
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:54,518
But, Jack, We Were...

905
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:58,818
That is one strange beagle.

906
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:01,922
- What? What is it?
- It's your dad.

907
00:55:01,993 --> 00:55:04,257
He's in trouble.
The guy from the lab got him.

908
00:55:04,329 --> 00:55:06,354
Go to the police station
and Wait for me.

909
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:08,991
No. He's my dad.
You're not going to go Without me.

910
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:11,126
All right. Fasten your seat belts.

911
00:55:11,202 --> 00:55:13,067
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

912
00:55:13,138 --> 00:55:14,935
Whoa. Ahh!

913
00:55:15,006 --> 00:55:17,133
Ahhh!

914
00:55:30,722 --> 00:55:32,519
[Jack] Whoo-hoo!

915
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:35,683
- [Barking]
- Shoeshine!

916
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,593
[Barking continues]

917
00:55:39,831 --> 00:55:42,163
- Shoeshine.
- Dad!

918
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:43,928
- Easy, tiger.
- [Dan] Jack!

919
00:55:44,002 --> 00:55:46,368
Jack, What's going on...
What's going on here?

920
00:55:46,438 --> 00:55:48,497
"Shoeshine," isn't it?

921
00:55:48,573 --> 00:55:52,407
<i>Or shall I address you
by your nom de guerre...</i>

922
00:55:52,477 --> 00:55:54,638
..."Underdog?"

923
00:55:54,713 --> 00:55:57,614
- It's "Shoeshine. "
- He can talk?

924
00:55:57,682 --> 00:56:00,048
<i>Yep, Barsinister had me beat.</i>

925
00:56:00,118 --> 00:56:02,712
<i>There was no way I could
save both of them.</i>

926
00:56:02,787 --> 00:56:06,553
I'm sorry. Do Whatever you Want to me.
Just let them go.

927
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,952
Wise decision. [chuckling]

928
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:16,228
<i>Turns out, Barsinister didn't want me.
He wanted my DNA.</i>

929
00:56:16,301 --> 00:56:20,533
<i>He took away my super powers
and put them in a little blue pill.</i>

930
00:56:20,605 --> 00:56:23,039
<i>But that wasn't the worst of it.</i>

931
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:27,534
And in this pill,

932
00:56:27,612 --> 00:56:31,013
there is the DNA of a regular beagle.

933
00:56:31,082 --> 00:56:33,448
Shoeshine, don't do it! No!

934
00:56:34,819 --> 00:56:37,185
Do you know What the saddest part is?

935
00:56:38,423 --> 00:56:41,358
You actually thought
that they loved you.

936
00:56:41,426 --> 00:56:45,328
They only loved the poWer
that I gave you.

937
00:56:45,397 --> 00:56:46,728
No!

938
00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:53,364
[Jack] No, Shoeshine.

939
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,234
Jack! Ahhh!

940
00:56:57,308 --> 00:57:00,334
[Whimpering] I didn't...
Want... anyone...

941
00:57:00,412 --> 00:57:04,712
...to get... hurt. [groaning]

942
00:57:06,985 --> 00:57:09,920
- Shoeshine!
- [Whimpers]

943
00:57:10,855 --> 00:57:13,119
[Barsinister] Cad.

944
00:57:13,191 --> 00:57:16,388
Not so tough now, are We, little doggie?

945
00:57:16,461 --> 00:57:17,928
Let's go.

946
00:57:17,996 --> 00:57:23,901
This city is going to pay for What
they have done to me. Their doubt.

947
00:57:23,968 --> 00:57:26,960
Their blindness.

948
00:57:27,038 --> 00:57:29,802
Their betrayal.

949
00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:40,143
Simon says, "Heel. "

950
00:57:40,218 --> 00:57:42,186
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

951
00:57:50,295 --> 00:57:53,321
<i>All those powers and
I wound up jeopardizing</i>

952
00:57:53,398 --> 00:57:56,265
<i>the only thing I cared about, my family.</i>

953
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:01,872
<i>And while I was stuck down there
feeling sorry for myself,</i>

954
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,535
<i>Cad and Barsinister
had returned to the capitol.</i>

955
00:58:13,151 --> 00:58:15,847
Help! Help us!

956
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,115
[Straining]

957
00:58:18,189 --> 00:58:20,123
Jack, that's not going to help.

958
00:58:20,191 --> 00:58:23,786
- You got to get untied.
- [Grunts] Forget it.

959
00:58:23,862 --> 00:58:26,092
Jack, don't quit!

960
00:58:26,164 --> 00:58:27,995
- Quit?
- Yeah!

961
00:58:28,066 --> 00:58:30,159
Me? What about you?

962
00:58:30,235 --> 00:58:32,226
You Were the best cop in the city

963
00:58:32,303 --> 00:58:34,794
and you should be up there
stopping Barsinister.

964
00:58:34,873 --> 00:58:37,307
But you quit!
You quit the force!

965
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,271
I did quit.

966
00:58:40,345 --> 00:58:42,336
I quit, Jack.

967
00:58:42,413 --> 00:58:45,905
I quit because I didn't Want
anything to happen to me.

968
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:47,645
I didn't Want to leave you alone.

969
00:58:56,461 --> 00:59:00,397
Jack, We have to get untied.

970
00:59:01,566 --> 00:59:03,124
now, just back up.

971
00:59:03,201 --> 00:59:05,362
Put your foot on that ledge.

972
00:59:05,436 --> 00:59:08,872
Grab that rope and jump up.
There you go!

973
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,067
Come over here
and let me untie you.

974
00:59:11,142 --> 00:59:12,905
Sit down.

975
00:59:17,582 --> 00:59:19,812
It's on so tight.

976
00:59:19,884 --> 00:59:22,819
The reason We're down here is me.

977
00:59:22,887 --> 00:59:25,685
All I had to do was just tell you
Shoeshine was Underdog.

978
00:59:25,757 --> 00:59:27,850
I'll tell you What you
should've told me...

979
00:59:28,593 --> 00:59:33,496
...that you gave my JV baseball
sWeater aWay to a superhero!

980
00:59:36,568 --> 00:59:38,900
OK. OK.

981
00:59:40,305 --> 00:59:41,772
[Dan] Grab Shoeshine.

982
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,569
[Jack] Come on, Shoeshine.
Come on, boy.

983
00:59:45,777 --> 00:59:47,267
All right, son, let's go.

984
00:59:47,345 --> 00:59:49,939
There has been an overwhelming
response, Mr. Mayor.

985
00:59:50,014 --> 00:59:52,039
- Good.
- You've never had this much press.

986
00:59:52,116 --> 00:59:54,175
Make sure they get
a good vieW of the dogs.

987
00:59:54,252 --> 00:59:55,651
[Barsinister] Mr. Mayor.

988
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,689
Do you have time
to consider my proposal now?

989
00:59:58,756 --> 01:00:02,385
Holy moly! Barsinister.

990
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:06,226
- [Sirens blaring]
- Start rolling, start rolling.

991
01:00:08,132 --> 01:00:11,568
Move! Go, go, go, go, go!

992
01:00:11,636 --> 01:00:15,094
[CroWd chattering]

993
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:20,405
- There. Where's Underdog?
- [Camera shutters clicking]

994
01:00:20,478 --> 01:00:22,673
[Woman] I'm at the steps
of the capitol building,

995
01:00:22,747 --> 01:00:24,772
Where on the eve
of his press announcement

996
01:00:24,849 --> 01:00:26,908
it seems the mayor has been kidnapped.

997
01:00:26,985 --> 01:00:29,249
now, SWAT has secured the perimeter

998
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,256
and We're still Waiting to find out
more information, any information.

999
01:00:54,712 --> 01:00:57,112
[Boy] Come on, hurry up. Let's go.

1000
01:00:57,181 --> 01:00:58,773
[Indistinct chattering]

1001
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:01,842
[Jack] Excuse me.
Trying to get through. Sorry. Pardon me.

1002
01:01:01,919 --> 01:01:04,513
- [Dan] Excuse me.
- [Boy] Come on. Get Underdog!

1003
01:01:05,556 --> 01:01:08,525
- [Man] Has anyone seen him?
- [Jack] We're too late.

1004
01:01:08,593 --> 01:01:11,653
- now What are We going to do?
- [Man] Where's Underdog?

1005
01:01:24,108 --> 01:01:25,541
Please stay back!

1006
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:28,306
[Girl] Underdog has
to be here someWhere.

1007
01:01:28,379 --> 01:01:31,405
[Policeman] Everyone, please stay back.

1008
01:01:31,482 --> 01:01:35,111
Shoeshine, I don't know
if you can understand me right now,

1009
01:01:35,186 --> 01:01:37,177
but forget about the past.

1010
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:41,351
It doesn't matter if you're
Shoeshine or Underdog.

1011
01:01:41,426 --> 01:01:44,054
Because I don't care
if you can talk or fly.

1012
01:01:44,128 --> 01:01:46,756
You brought my family back together.

1013
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:48,560
You're a hero to me.

1014
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:57,236
<i>- There I was, a regular old dog again.

01:01:57,308 --> 01:02:00,072
<i>I had no idea how to stop Barsinister.</i>

1016
01:02:00,144 --> 01:02:03,671
<i>But I did know one thing.
I smelled a bomb.</i>

1017
01:02:03,748 --> 01:02:07,184
<i>Could I trust my nose again?
Could I afford not to?</i>

1018
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:09,048
<i>What are the chances there's a ham</i>

1021
01:02:25,903 --> 01:02:28,736
All right. What are your demands?

1022
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:32,936
A billion dollars
from this city's treasury,

1023
01:02:33,978 --> 01:02:36,378
full immunity from the laW

1024
01:02:36,447 --> 01:02:39,245
and my lab restored

1025
01:02:39,317 --> 01:02:44,084
so I can continue my research
to help the human animal,

1026
01:02:44,889 --> 01:02:47,881

1027

You and your boss
Will never get aWay With this.

1056

He's not my boss! We're partners!

1057
01:04:45,309 --> 01:04:46,742
Then Why are you doing this?

1058
01:04:46,811 --> 01:04:49,837
Because my partner said
he might fire me if I don't!

1059
01:04:49,914 --> 01:04:51,882
I got him!
I'm getting tired up here.

I said a lot of things I kind of regret.

I'll play your game.
It might be a stretch.

1078
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,747
Can you resist this?

1079
01:06:04,822 --> 01:06:07,017

Whoo! Didn't see that coming.

1083
01:06:22,406 --> 01:06:24,840
I think I pulled something.

1084
01:06:24,909 --> 01:06:27,844
OK. I got to get to that bomb.

Come on, guys, uh,
We're all dogs here.

1087
01:06:33,284 --> 01:06:35,980
Can't We just Work
this out dog-to-dog?

1088
01:06:36,053 --> 01:06:39,113
They're not going
to listen to you, Shoeshine.

1089
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:42,751
They're loyal to me. [cackles]

1090

Listen. Why do you even
folloW his orders?

1091
01:06:45,429 --> 01:06:47,363
What does that creep do for you?

1092
01:06:47,431 --> 01:06:50,923
Huh? Does he take you for Walks?
Does he give you treats?

1093
01:06:51,002 --> 01:06:53,527
Has he ever once
scratched your bellies? Huh?

1094
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:54,798
Just once?

1095
01:06:54,872 --> 01:06:56,703
I mean, look, if he was a good boss,

1096
01:06:56,774 --> 01:06:59,106
he'd be able to get
a higher quality sidekick.

[Groaning] Hey, I heard that.

1098

You're man's best friend,
but is he your best friend?

Has he even given any of you a name?

1100
01:07:07,018 --> 01:07:08,986
Of course. My name is Kill.

1101

- Do you mind, Doc?
- [Dog 2] We're talking over here.

1105

Who's he to call you Worthless?

1106
01:07:24,068 --> 01:07:25,626
He's got a point.

1107
01:07:25,703 --> 01:07:28,866
Our master doesn't value us
as sparkling individuals.

1108
01:07:28,939 --> 01:07:31,339
Yeah, let's go, Maim and Attack.

1109

- What are you doing?

- Bad dogs!

1182
01:13:21,725 --> 01:13:25,991
I thought it Would be
too paradoxical for you.

1183
01:13:26,063 --> 01:13:31,160
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Yes, I can. I just did.

ran out With the bomb

01:13:35,305 --> 01:13:38,001
and buried it farther than
any bone has ever been buried!

1187
01:13:38,075 --> 01:13:40,043
Sounds like I missed all the excitement.

Oh, uh, it got burnt
reentering the atmosphere.
