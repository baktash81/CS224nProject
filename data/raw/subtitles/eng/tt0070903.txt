1
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,760
Who is it?

2
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,995
It's Lieutenant Finley.
He's coming up the path.

3
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,635
It might be worth
listening to him, Edna.

4
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,600
So he can tell me about D-Day?
I don't wanna hear about D-Day.

5
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,871
Look what happened to my son.

6
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,835
Hold it, Peggy.
Cut from D-Day to...

7
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,315
..."Don't tell me about
the black market."

8
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,195
You're making me a bitch...

9
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,155
...to keep in your propaganda!

10
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,892
Peggy, I'll tell you--

11
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,440
Oh, Jesus!

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,875
Oh, Bill. Katie wants to keep in
the black market. Bill!

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,835
Glad you're back.
How did it go?

14
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,515
Goddamn Pentagon, all they see
is red! Where's my coffee?

15
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,195
Get you some in a minute.

16
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,235
Don't cast that broad again.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,742
Takes a reactionary to play one.

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,035
Where's my coffee?
Can't the chintzy OWI afford a gofer?

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,618
And where's Roxanne?

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,035
She called and she said that
she couldn't make it.

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,155
We'd like to get set up and go
from the top again, Mr. Verso.

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,515
- What's the matter?
- What is this?

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,635
Two lines I wrote.
No good, huh?

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,834
Morosky, let me do the writing,
will you?

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,246
Christ, I'm tired of being
a patriot for no money.

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,995
- She can't come?
- Nope.

27
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,035
Okay, Katie, you're in luck.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,618
I'm taking you to El Morocco, courtesy
of the Office of War Information.

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,075
All right, Americans,
let's take it from the top.

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,800
One, two. One, two, three.

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,717
Clear the way.

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,800
Please clear the way.

33
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,955
Sir, we have a reservation.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,715
- There are no more tables.
- But we called...

35
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,995
- ...and you said--
- Sorry, no tables.

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,715
- I told you--
- But we called--

37
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,795
I'd like to know your name
and also why you're not in uniform.

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,148
These boys have been in combat,
you fascist rope-holder.

39
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,035
- Hi, Fred. Bill Verso. OWI.
- Don't tip him.

40
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,795
- Get his name!
- We were with a whole bunch of people.

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
- Hey, Verso! Merry old Bill Verso.
- Hey, Tiny!

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,435
Stop it!
Don't do that!

43
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,435
They're with us.

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,600
Come on!

45
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,635
Thanks, Tiny.
Good to see you.

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,200
Listen, Katie--
Hey, Jimbo!

47
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,195
Can't you leave your
soapbox at home just once?

48
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,394
Coming through.

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,797
What do you want to drink?
I know. Dubonnet over ice.

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,265
Dubonnet over ice
and a scotch, straight up.

51
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,800
Here's your Dubonnet, Morosky.

52
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,520
Oh, to be in uniform!

53
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,440
Hubbell Gardiner.

54
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
What?

55
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,991
That's his name.

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,800
Swell. What's hers?

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,355
I suppose they learn that
balance on board ship.

58
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,246
Absolutely. Let's dance.

59
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,035
What've you got to lose?

60
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,234
I'll probably go overseas soon.
It's pretty hush-hush.

61
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,635
Save Loyalist Spain!
Stop Franco for world peace now!

62
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Write President Roosevelt!

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,440
Come on. Do something about it!

64
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Save Spain!
Stop Franco!

65
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,635
Stop the slaughter of innocent women
and children. Do something!

66
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,515
Write your congressman today.

67
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,515
Katie, what are you selling?

68
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
The ROTC.

69
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,560
You can have it cheap!

70
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Fascist.

71
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,520
Row, Hubbell!

72
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
A true peace rally...

73
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,355
...should cover the entire spectrum
from extreme right...

74
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,955
...to extreme left.
As our next speaker proves.

75
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,195
The President of the Young Communist
League. She needs no introduction.

76
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,760
Miss Katie Morosky.

77
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,275
Guess I do need an introduction.

78
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,720
Back up, Katie.

79
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,074
Yeah, all the way to Moscow!

80
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,991
You can still take Communion
and like the Soviet Union!

81
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,555
What's cooking in the Kremlin, Katie?

82
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,435
The Kremlin's worried about the
civil war in Spain. Are you?

83
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,995
Thousands of Spanish citizens
are being bombed and murdered.

84
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,578
Only one country is sending help.
One country.

85
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,200
The Soviet Union.

86
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,160
K-K-K-Katie, be my C-C-C-Comrade.

87
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,840
O-K-K-K-Kay!

88
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,369
What are you scared of?

89
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,835
The Russians don't want anybody
in Spain but the Spanish.

90
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,400
Is that scary?

91
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,834
They're Communists, but they want
total disarmament. Is that scary?

92
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,035
Hitler and Mussolini are using Spain
as testing ground for what they want.

93
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,640
Another world war! Is that scary?

94
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,726
You're darn right it is!

95
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,835
There's only one thing
to be scared of...

96
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,195
...and it's not me, it's not the
Young Communist League...

97
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,702
..and it's not the Red bogeyman.

98
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,400
You be scared of anybody, anyplace...

99
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,920
...who will not stand up
for world peace now!

100
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,671
You're really...

101
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,835
...you're really something.

102
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,200
Really--
You're really beautiful.

103
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,640
No, I mean it.

104
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
You're really beautiful.

105
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,200
You're the best...

106
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,400
...the brightest...

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,315
...most committed generation
this country's ever had.

108
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,195
That's why you're here today,
striking for peace.

109
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,435
Why, they're striking on almost every
single campus in this country.

110
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,235
They're taking that pledge. Show your
solidarity by taking it with them.

111
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,560
"I refuse to support"--

112
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,440
Come on, come on.

113
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,875
"I refuse"-- Come on.
On your feet!

114
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,635
"I refuse to"-- That's right.
On your feet. Everybody.

115
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
"I refuse to support"--

116
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,120
No, everybody. Everybody!

117
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,880
"I refuse to support...

118
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,195
...the government of
the United States...

119
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,280
...in any war it might conduct."

120
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,835
The student council calls
this a peace rally. I call it...

121
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,235
...a peace strike.

122
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,600
And I'm an English major.

123
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,338
It isn't that funny.

124
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,680
You fascists!

125
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,080
- We have to talk about this stuff.
- Wait a second.

126
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,755
- You've been on that for two months.
- Three.

127
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,115
It's a short story--

128
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,755
Frankie Mc Veigh,
you're not funny.

129
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,555
- I know it.
- Listen...

130
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,235
...would you do me a favour?
Take the YCL meeting Monday night.

131
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,635
- You can't miss a meeting.
- I have to.

132
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,988
The story is due on Tuesday
and it's just gotta be good.

133
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Look who's here,
America the beautiful.

134
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,200
- How much do you have in the treasury?
- $542.18.

135
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,595
Possible themes for the prom.

136
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,560
"Caribbean Holiday," "Jungle Fever"--

137
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,195
Hey, you should be listening to this.

138
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,471
"Niagara Falls."

139
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,800
"Thirteen Colonies," "48 States."

140
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,955
"Thirteen Colonies," "48 States"--

141
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
J.J.

142
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,400
J.J., listen.

143
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,435
"The 48 States," "Starlight, Star
Bright" and " In My Merry Oldsmobile."

144
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,172
How about
"Bread Lines Can Be Fun"?

145
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,600
How about "The Stalin Shuffle"?

146
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,932
What are we gonna have?
Hamburgers?

147
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,089
How about "The College Grad
Meets The Leningrad"?

148
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,249
She's a million laughs.

149
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,917
- What do you want?
- Coke.

150
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,603
- Coca-Cola?
- Coca-Cola.

151
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,640
Excuse me.

152
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,532
You're all decadent
and disgusting.

153
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,915
Come on, we weren't
making fun of you.

154
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,345
You make fun of everything.
You think politics is a joke.

155
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,435
You make fun of politicians.

156
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,195
- What else can you do?
- Think Franco's funny?

157
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,595
- Franco? Is he here?
- Yeah, Franco. He's a politician.

158
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,794
He's funny? Hitler has a funny
moustache. Why not have a Nazi prom?

159
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,532
Well, we thought of that,
but the uniforms itch.

160
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,235
Comes the revolution, maybe
we'll have a sense of humour.

161
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,195
Four cheeseburgers, four cokes.

162
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,640
Onion?

163
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,400
Yeah, in the cokes.

164
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,235
If I read comparatively few of your
stories aloud in class...

165
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,435
...it's because I think we
learn best from what's good.

166
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,400
Or at least, talented.

167
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,475
Today I'm going to read,
with a great deal of pleasure...

168
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,200
...a remarkably good story
from a surprising new source.

169
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,126
The name of the story is
"The All-American Smile."

170
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,511
And it's by Hubbell Gardiner.

171
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,455
"In a way, he was like the country
he lived in.

172
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,178
Everything came too easily to him,
but at least he knew it.

173
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,126
About once a month he worried
that he was a fraud.

174
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,235
But then most everyone he knew
was more fraudulent.

175
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,895
Sometimes he felt....

176
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,265
--there's really no reason
for us to change.

177
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,115
But of course by then, they were
too lost or too lazy.

178
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,000
It had always been too easy."

179
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,403
The trouble with some people
is they work too hard.

180
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,409
Are you speaking to me?

181
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Want a beer?

182
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,117
I don't drink.

183
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
One sip. One sip of beer.

184
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,235
Well?

185
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,675
- You carry your books all the time?
- That's what I crossed the street for?

186
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,951
I'm celebrating.

187
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,555
What are you celebrating?

188
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,908
I got you to cross the street.

189
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,809
Listen, I'm sorry I....

190
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,835
I haven't told you that
I really liked your story.

191
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,640
You're a good writer.

192
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Thank you.

193
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,235
Mrs. Simpson married the Duke of
Windsor. It's in tomorrow's paper.

194
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,635
How do you know that?
The papers aren't out yet.

195
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,218
I work in the Linotype room
two nights a week.

196
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,209
You never quit, do you?

197
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
Well...

198
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,588
...thanks for getting me
across the street.

199
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
I sold one.

200
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,794
I sold a story.

201
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,603
I've never known anybody who sold one.

202
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,188
Oh, boy, Hubbell.

203
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,652
Okay, so have a drink.

204
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
Sit.

205
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,035
To your first novel.

206
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,400
- Wait a minute, not so fast.
- Why not?

207
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah, why not?

208
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,012
You should've laughed.

209
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,955
"Any peace but Katie's piece."

210
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,955
You were good. You had them.

211
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,355
You could've kept them,
if only you'd laughed.

212
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,715
- It wasn't funny.
- That's not the only reason to laugh.

213
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,395
- You're a puritan.
- I am not.

214
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,595
- You've no sense of humour.
- My family thinks I'm humorous.

215
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,715
- Why are you always angry?
- Not always! Because I don't know...

216
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,835
...about coed humour. I've never
been in a fraternity or sorority...

217
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,715
...which is where I'm sure they make up
all that dirty stuff anyway.

218
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,515
That's pretty dirty business.

219
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,715
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

220
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,800
Do you smile all the time?

221
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
No.

222
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,160
No. No.

223
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,849
Here's to commencement.

224
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,600
A funny word for "the end."

225
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,034
Mrs. Simpson married
the Duke of Windsor.

226
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,515
I told you that, didn't I?

227
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,800
Yeah, you did.

228
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,458
I'm really happy about your news.

229
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,155
I hope I get to read
your story someday.

230
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,662
Put your foot here.

231
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,665
Go get 'em, Katie.

232
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,788
See you, Hubbell.

233
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
See you.

234
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,511
Don't spill it on your dress.

235
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,955
I'd like to have the sewing concession
when they want to shorten those dresses.

236
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You know, to get
some wear out of them.

237
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,920
Grab your coat and get your hat

238
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,600
Leave your worries on the doorstep

239
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,995
I'm glad we're not
working on commission.

240
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,655
I've never been to a dance before,
except the one the YCL gave for Spain.

241
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,800
Here, have a drink.

242
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,835
- Here.
- What's that, bourbon?

243
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,803
It's gin, Katie. Come on.

244
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,200
From the bottle? So bourgeois.

245
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,395
- Let's dance.
- We aren't supposed to.

246
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,825
You weren't supposed to buy me a
corsage either. Come on.

247
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,400
Can you, Frankie?

248
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,972
Frankie Mc Veigh, you've got
a foot for dancing!

249
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Hubbell?

250
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Hubbell?

251
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,400
What do you know?

252
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,852
Small world, isn't it?

253
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,560
I fall asleep?

254
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
I think so.

255
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,635
What do you know?

256
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Would you like to have
a cup of coffee?

257
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,600
Oh, yeah.

258
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,000
Coffee.

259
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,942
Here you are, kiddo.
Good night.

260
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Good night.

261
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,800
Good night, Hubbell, old boy.

262
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,360
Whoever you are.

263
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,000
Who are you?

264
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,000
It's the top floor.

265
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,880
Only one more!

266
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,800
In there.

267
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Hubbell?

268
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Hubbell?

269
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,071
General quarters!
Count down!

270
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,280
Stand safe....

271
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Hubbell.

272
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,160
Hubbell, it's Katie.

273
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,360
You didn't know it was Katie.

274
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,755
I'll be done in a minute.

275
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,075
- You don't have to do that.
- Oh, it's okay. I like to iron.

276
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,435
Gee, you have a lot
of ribbons here.

277
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,095
You have any aspirin?

278
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,800
Oh, I don't.

279
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,646
Push in on your temples.

280
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,955
How can you not have aspirin?

281
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,154
I always eat for a headache.

282
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,395
Do you have my watch?
Do you know where it is?

283
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,517
I took it off and put it
on the bedpost.

284
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,726
I thought you'd be more comfortable--

285
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,915
- That's why I....
- Here.

286
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,960
Thank you.

287
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,560
It's your hair.

288
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,846
That's what's different.

289
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,668
I have it ironed.

290
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
You have your hair ironed?

291
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Does it hurt?

292
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
No.

293
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,835
Have some coffee at least.

294
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm low on sugar,
but it's real coffee.

295
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,675
No, thank you. I have to
meet J.J. at the train.

296
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,182
Looks good, though.

297
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,298
You still have J.J.?

298
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,675
How long will you be around?
Where are you stationed?

299
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,800
In Washington.

300
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,075
Oh, that's good.
That could be exciting.

301
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Why?

302
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,675
Roosevelt is there.

303
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,395
I thought the Party said he was
an evil warmonger.

304
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,160
How do you know that?

305
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,745
You still think a varsity letter
stands for "moron," huh?

306
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,071
Some people work out
better than we think.

307
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,875
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, listen....

308
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,675
This is my number, and this is
the OWI office where I work.

309
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,955
This is the radio station. It's
very difficult to find a hotel room.

310
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,692
If you're ever in town and you
can't find one, well, just....

311
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,440
No obligation of course.

312
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Thank you.

313
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,338
About last night....

314
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,760
I'm sorry. I've been
falling asleep all over lately.

315
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
That's okay.

316
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,123
Hope my snoring didn't
keep you awake.

317
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,675
Oh, that's okay.

318
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,360
I like snoring.

319
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,874
See you, Katie.

320
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,160
See you, Hubbell.

321
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,160
Good luck.

322
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,315
American-Soviet benefit,
Friday night at town hall!

323
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,515
Come to the American-Soviet
Friendship benefit Friday.

324
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,755
American-Soviet benefit
at town hall, folks.

325
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,115
Come to the American-Soviet
benefit Friday night.

326
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,155
Thank you. Big show.
Big show at town hall, folks.

327
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,595
Come to the American-Soviet
benefit Friday night.

328
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,115
Hey, soldier, why don't you
bring a date?

329
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,795
Come to the American-Soviet benefit.

330
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Bring a date.

331
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,555
Come to the American-Soviet benefit.

332
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,955
American-Soviet--
Jesus, I'm late for the OWI.

333
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,515
See you later, Pony.

334
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Bye!

335
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,355
- Vote for Thomas E. Dewey!
- We've gotta stop FDR.

336
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,169
I'll take them. I'll give them
to your friends. I'll help you.

337
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,200
CDHQ, America Calling.

338
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,475
Applications are available
at your local post office.

339
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,212
CDHQ, America Calling.

340
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,160
Can you identify them?

341
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,200
Over the Bronx?
25 Stuka Dive Bombers.

342
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,995
I've got it, madam. Yes, I remember
Pearl Harbor. I'll connect you.

343
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,475
Even if he lost the paper,
I'm still in the book.

344
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,400
It's only been a week.

345
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,486
One moment, please.
I'll connect you.

346
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,155
He could phone at least.
CDHQ, America Calling.

347
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,354
Phone where?
You've only got eleven jobs.

348
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,355
You've censored all
but nine minutes.

349
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,595
- It implied that we spit on Negroes.
- Which you do.

350
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,195
- The situation--
- Now the Negroes are a situation?

351
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,995
After the war, the Pentagon--

352
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,955
It'll be just like it was
before, you racist fink!

353
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,115
- What's with her this week?
- This week?

354
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,155
- What do you mean?
- Shut up!

355
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,195
- I have 21 minutes of dead airspace!
- It's his fault!

356
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,720
Okay, okay! I'll sign.

357
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,720
Hubbell?

358
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,155
- Where are you?
- Grant's tomb.

359
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,795
I can't get a room.
Can I use your couch?

360
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,475
- Of course you can.
- Morosky, we have--

361
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,000
Will you, please!

362
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,755
Hubbell, there's beer in the icebox
and clean towels...

363
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,755
...and if you wanna take a nap...

364
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,595
...take off the phone and put it
in the drawer of the desk.

365
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,178
- How do I get the key?
- I'll call the super.

366
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Hubbell!

367
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,338
I wasn't sure when you'd be home.
How are you?

368
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,555
I'll be back later.
Could you leave a key--?

369
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,675
You can't. I got steaks and potatoes
and sour cream and chives...

370
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,595
...and salad and fresh pie.

371
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,595
I would have made pot roast...

372
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,995
...but I didn't know if you liked it.
Anyway, there wasn't time...

373
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,395
...so I got steaks with
my ration stamps.

374
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,355
And you must be hungry,
you couldn't have had time to eat.

375
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,169
You can't go yet. You've got to stay
for supper, that's all there is to it.

376
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,388
What kind of pie?

377
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,782
Oh, your hero, huh?

378
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
Who?

379
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,395
He wasn't in college when he
did nothing for Spain.

380
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,555
- Congress was isolationist in '37--
- You'd justify the Nazi-Soviet pact.

381
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,315
Easier than you can justify the
Allies sitting on their behinds--

382
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Why can't you say asses?

383
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,923
- Because I can't.
- Why?

384
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,360
What happens?

385
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,400
I don't know. Nothing.

386
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,315
- What a subject for two--
- It's interesting.

387
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,437
You'd rather talk politics.

388
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,315
All the contradictions. Should we
get in the war, should we not?

389
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,835
Stalin's for Hitler.
Stalin's against him.

390
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,635
All political doubletalk,
but you hold on.

391
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,155
I don't know how you do it.

392
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,277
I don't know how you can't.

393
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,114
You're jealous.

394
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,560
- What?
- You are.

395
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,978
Why are you jealous?

396
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,160
I'll live.

397
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,360
Maybe longer.

398
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,335
But you won't write another novel.

399
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,075
You must've gotten one
of the two copies sold.

400
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,795
- You get through it?
- Oh, I managed.

401
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,960
Twice.

402
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,960
I liked it.

403
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,360
I liked it a lot.

404
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,935
What didn't you like?

405
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,200
The way you write is no problem.

406
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,477
Your style is absolutely gorgeous.
But--

407
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
Gorgeous?

408
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,320
It is.

409
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,360
It is gorgeous.

410
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,960
But you...

411
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,317
...stand back.

412
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,286
Do you know what I mean?

413
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,160
Go ahead.

414
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,560
You see, the people...

415
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,360
...you watch them...

416
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,760
...from a distance.

417
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,520
Where?

418
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
In the book.

419
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,115
I know, in the book.

420
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,600
Where in the book?

421
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,160
Be specific.

422
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,560
All through it, Hubbell.

423
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,075
But it's your first novel, and
I'm sure the second one will be--

424
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,195
Why should I write another novel?

425
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,086
Because you must!
You're too good a writer not to.

426
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,795
Are you really so sure
of everything you're so sure of?

427
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
Sure.

428
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,875
Aren't you?

429
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,080
No.

430
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,800
No. Not as sure.

431
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,102
Do things still come too easily?

432
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,875
"In a way he was like
the country he lived in.

433
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,612
Everything came too easily to him."

434
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,994
What made you remember that?

435
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,397
I always wondered if
it would stay true.

436
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,314
Not altogether.

437
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,597
What doesn't come easy now?

438
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,760
Hotel rooms.

439
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,960
Be serious.

440
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,960
Do you know you're beautiful?

441
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,360
You are.

442
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,760
But you mustn't be too serious.

443
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,440
I won't be.

444
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,560
I won't be.

445
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,640
Happy Rosh Hashanah!

446
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,182
- What is it?
- What do you mean, what is it?

447
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,995
You get to see your old pal J.J.

448
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,995
It'll be fun. We can all be
decadent and eat eggs Benedict...

449
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,715
...and vote Republican.

450
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,760
- I don't like eggs Benedict.
- Really?

451
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,797
- I'll bet you were a cheerleader.
- Me?

452
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,431
- Come on.
- No!

453
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,000
Maybe you'll have a good time.

454
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,000
Paper doll that I can call my own

455
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,395
A doll that other fellows....

456
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,355
Boy, this is some Navy
you're in, J.J.

457
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,480
Hi, Hub.

458
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,795
You mean all this?
It belongs to my aunt.

459
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,195
Is that the one that
plays the accordion?

460
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,315
Does she really play the accordion?

461
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,635
- She got squeezed to death.
- She did not.

462
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,757
She's gone overseas.
She's with the USO.

463
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,400
Best USO?

464
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,400
- Come on.
- I got it.

465
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,875
Hollywood and Vine.

466
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,240
Best USO hostess?

467
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,825
Tallulah Bankhead.

468
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,795
I hope your aunt's under Patton.

469
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,378
You can bet she's under somebody.

470
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,640
Excuse me.

471
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,760
All right.

472
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,098
- Okay. How about-- Gardiner?
- Wait a second.

473
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,595
- Best small hotel.
- Not fair. I haven't been abroad.

474
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,275
But it's in Switzerland.

475
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,235
We don't want to make any bad jokes.
Saint Regis in Paris.

476
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,760
Pretty, isn't it?

477
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,275
You look different.

478
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,705
It's my hair.
I have it ironed.

479
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,480
- You what?
- In Harlem.

480
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,595
I actually have friends
in Harlem.

481
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,995
I'm sure you do.
Would you like me to disapprove?

482
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,475
But how long has this been going on?

483
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,595
I mean, Hubbell Gardiner and
K-K-K-Katie Morosky.

484
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,155
- No. No, she looks terrific.
- I like her, J.J.

485
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,738
- You really haven't changed, have you?
- Neither have you.

486
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,305
As pretty as ever.

487
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,760
For a while.

488
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,745
I'm with J.J. now.

489
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,960
Are you?

490
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,160
Excuse me.

491
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,995
Remember how she looked
in college compared to now?

492
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,795
- Can I get you a drink?
- I don't think so.

493
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,071
- What were you doing?
- She seemed upset.

494
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,735
You do it. You make yourself
feel out of place.

495
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,995
I feel like I'm here for drinks
and everyone else gets supper.

496
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,720
Try talking to them.

497
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,595
- I have.
- No you don't.

498
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,395
You don't talk, you lecture.

499
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,715
What was that speech about Yalta?

500
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,195
No one here needs you to explain it.

501
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,355
Then why all those silly jokes?

502
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,515
J.J. called Roosevelt
the "Yaltese Falcon."

503
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,795
I thought it was pretty funny.

504
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,675
And selling your novel to Hollywood?
I hope that's meant to be funny.

505
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,160
- Why?
- Why?

506
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,155
Because you're too good
for Hollywood, that's why.

507
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,155
Maybe I'd be lucky to sell a
book to Hollywood.

508
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,355
You've never even been there!

509
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,795
Besides, this isn't the point.
Can't we just relax and enjoy the party?

510
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:32,475
You get onto politics, and your sense
of humour goes right out the window.

511
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,715
I guess there are just
some things that are...

512
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,075
...difficult for me
to laugh about, Hubbell.

513
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,120
Than have a fickle-minded
Real live girl

514
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,560
I'm sorry.

515
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,995
I got caught up at the studio and...

516
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,515
...then I met somebody from
the party who wondered--

517
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,800
What? What?

518
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,960
The first eight chapters.

519
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,475
You want to read it, read it.
But let's not discuss it.

520
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,560
All right.

521
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,675
If you don't like it, you have to say
you don't like it and why.

522
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,160
What if I like it?

523
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,240
Waiter?

524
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,240
Ahoy.

525
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,200
Come in.

526
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,595
How you doing?

527
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,640
Fine.

528
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,680
Is that new?

529
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,723
It was in the other room.

530
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,560
Looks good there.

531
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,689
Plants are all growing.

532
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,305
How's your mother?

533
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,400
Much better, like the news.

534
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,795
I might be able sell
my book to Hollywood.

535
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,760
I know, J.J. told me.

536
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,560
What do you think about that?

537
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,954
About living in sunshine
all year long...

538
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,806
...and going to work in a sports car?

539
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,760
Sailing.

540
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,960
Sounds wonderful.

541
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,209
Would you like a drink?

542
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,960
No.

543
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,560
No, I just stopped.
I was out walking.

544
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,760
Hey, thanks.

545
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,440
I love the way you write.

546
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,720
Franklin Roosevelt is dead.

547
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,315
Most of you have already
heard the news.

548
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,955
But it will take days,
perhaps weeks, even months...

549
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,355
...for the final tragedy of
what happened at 5:45 this morning...

550
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,554
...to be fully comprehended.

551
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,675
What seems particularly touching
is that he will not be here...

552
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,951
...to share in a victory
so close at hand.

553
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,320
Did you go see it?

554
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,520
I was talking to....

555
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,235
There was this older guy...

556
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,126
...on, you know, that
steel platform between cars?

557
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,760
I helped him open
a big door, he needed air.

558
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,154
Jesus, I can't even remember
when he wasn't President.

559
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,475
A fourth term was too much
for the old man.

560
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,435
A third was too much
for my old man.

561
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,955
- At least it'll end those Eleanor jokes.
- Some were funny.

562
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,875
How about Eleanor in the mine
with the hillbillies?

563
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,235
Her face was covered
with grime, right?

564
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,715
Grime? For chrissakes, Judianne,
Eleanor went down into...

565
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,795
...a mine and got her face black with
coal. The hillbillies saw her...

566
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,435
...big buckteeth shining--

567
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,080
Her husband is dead!

568
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,800
Dead.

569
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,622
Yes, Mrs. Roosevelt went down
into the mines.

570
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,915
And when they asked her why,
she said, "I am my husband's legs."

571
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,191
Did you tell cripple jokes too?
Is there anything that isn't a joke?

572
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,440
Sorry.

573
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,755
Who makes up jokes anyway?

574
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,000
J.J.'s old man.

575
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,755
Scads of swell material here
for a good novel.

576
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,555
If you wanna write about this.

577
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,675
People who tell jokes
instead of feeling something.

578
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,555
Let's meet every five years...

579
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,555
...or every time a President conks.
Whichever's sooner!

580
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,235
- What are you doing?
- What are we doing here?

581
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,635
J.J.'s gonna buy your book and
we're all gonna go to Hollywood?

582
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,635
Take it easy.

583
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,915
Lots of writers went there.
Fitzgerald--

584
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,875
- He's dead!
- I know that.

585
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,915
It's none of your business anyway.
He died of booze...

586
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,422
- ...and people like you!
- Damn it, stop it!

587
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,915
He's sorry for the joke.

588
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,235
Why did you bring me here?
Couldn't we have gone for a walk...

589
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,555
- ...or sit on a bench?
- I didn't want to feel sadder.

590
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:49,075
- What's wrong with feeling sadder?
- It won't help! The President died!

591
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,351
And everything in the world that
happens doesn't just happen to you.

592
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,315
Behave yourself.

593
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,052
I don't care about behaving myself!

594
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,720
Then don't. Do what you want.

595
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,720
I wanna get out of here.

596
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,520
All right.

597
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,160
I meant us.

598
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,720
And then what?

599
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,720
See you later, Katie.

600
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,120
Oh, yeah, see you.

601
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:55,197
Good night, my beauty.
You can finish in the morning.

602
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,680
Cheer up.

603
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,957
I'm about to have a big night and
I wanna think of you as smiling.

604
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,745
Good night, Billy.

605
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,360
Hi.

606
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,960
Hi.

607
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,846
Gee, I thought you
got sent overseas.

608
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,738
Could I talk to you?

609
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,320
Sure.

610
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:57,035
Listen, I was a bad girl.
I know that. But I'm better now.

611
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,755
It was like a tantrum.
I get them from time to time.

612
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,315
It's like an eclipse.

613
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,435
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

614
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,557
I wanted to have an apology dinner.
I thought I'd fill my icebox--

615
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,422
I'm a pain in the ass, aren't I?

616
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,315
I go to swearing school now.

617
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,515
Soundproof school.
I'm up to the F's.

618
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,835
I'm taking a laughing course
and studying Protestant cookery.

619
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,880
Don't.

620
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,520
Are you finished?

621
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,555
Look, Katie--

622
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,677
Please don't start with "Look."
It's always bad news.

623
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,514
I don't think we're gonna
make it, Katie.

624
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,240
Why?

625
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,295
I just don't think it's
gonna work, that's all.

626
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,969
I was too easy for you.

627
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,320
Easy?

628
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,120
I don't mean sexually.

629
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,035
I mean easy like
everything is for you.

630
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,311
You really think you're easy?

631
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,115
Compared to what?
The Hundred Years' War?

632
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,115
You're so ready to fight,
you have no time to understand.

633
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,035
Counterattack, politics,
revolution, cause!

634
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,835
That's all fine for you.
So stay with it. I admire it.

635
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,915
- Up to a point.
- That's right!

636
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,806
Okay, okay! Don't belabour it.
I get it. I get it.

637
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,585
I don't fit on Beekman Place,
that's what's really wrong.

638
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,555
- You think that's what I'm talking--
- Yes!

639
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,435
No demands, just fun, laughs.

640
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,120
Good! Go! Go have a good time
on Beekman Place.

641
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,628
You wanna end it like
a gentleman, you have. So get out!

642
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,511
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

643
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,320
I'm calm now, Hubbell.

644
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,920
You can go.

645
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,120
It's me.

646
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,120
Hubbell....

647
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,209
Wait a minute, hold on.

648
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,320
Don't go away.

649
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,985
Listen, Hubbell...

650
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,120
...this is kind of peculiar.

651
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,755
I know that I don't have to apologize
for what I said because...

652
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,646
...I know that you know.

653
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And...

654
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,155
...I also know that you...

655
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,275
...you know that I don't feel exactly
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed...

656
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,935
...as J.J. would say.

657
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,120
Anyway, the peculiar thing is...

658
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,320
...it's really a request,
you know, a favour.

659
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,775
You see, I can't sleep, Hubbell...

660
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,960
...it would help me so much
if you could....

661
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,920
Well, if I had someone to talk to.

662
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,052
You know, if I had a best
friend or something...

663
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,123
...to talk about it with.

664
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,997
Only you're my best friend.

665
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,480
Isn't that dumb?

666
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,880
So dumb.

667
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,695
You're the best friend I ever had.

668
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:53,342
It would help me so much if you'd
come over and see me through tonight.

669
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,555
Hubbell, I promise
I won't touch you...

670
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,120
...or beg you...

671
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,120
...or embarrass you.

672
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,403
But I have to talk to my best
friend about someone we both know.

673
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,837
So could-- Hubbell, could you please
come over right away, please?

674
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,308
There's some sleeping pills
in the cabinet.

675
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,200
Here.

676
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,828
Isn't one enough?

677
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,920
No.

678
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,120
I'm scared.

679
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,760
Take them.

680
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,658
Will you stay till I fall asleep?

681
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,320
I'm really sorry.

682
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,926
But that's what
best friends are for.

683
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,640
Aren't they?

684
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,335
There's something I wanna ask you.

685
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,715
Hope this doesn't make me drunk
instead of sleepy.

686
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,760
Don't drink it like water.

687
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,597
Is it because I'm not
attractive enough?

688
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,338
I'm not fishing, really. I'm not.

689
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,120
I know I'm attractive.

690
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,720
Sort of.

691
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,120
But...

692
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,868
...I'm not attractive in the--

693
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,689
I'm not attractive in the right way.

694
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,920
Am I?

695
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,120
I mean...

696
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,215
...I don't have the right style...

697
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,120
...for you.

698
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,960
Do I?

699
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,440
Be my friend.

700
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,145
You don't have the right style.

701
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,200
I'll change.

702
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,675
Don't. You're your own girl.
You have your own style.

703
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,635
But then I won't have you.

704
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,000
Why can't I have you? Why?

705
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,320
Because you push too hard.

706
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,520
Every damn minute.

707
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,835
There's no time to relax
and enjoy living.

708
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,803
Everything's too serious.

709
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,115
I push too hard because
I want things to be better.

710
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,755
I want us to be better,
you to be better.

711
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,955
Sure I make waves, you have to.
I'll keep making them...

712
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,235
...till you're everything
you should be.

713
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:24,755
You'll never find anyone to believe
in you this much or love you as much.

714
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,755
- I know that.
- Well then, why?

715
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,755
You think if I come back it'll
be okay by magic?

716
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,355
What'll be different?

717
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,862
- We'll be wrong. We'll both lose.
- Couldn't we both win?

718
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,515
I like Hollywood. I like Alice Faye.

719
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,720
Don't. Don't. No, please.

720
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,320
Somebody's getting up.

721
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,665
Aren't you sleepy?

722
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,600
You are.

723
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,120
I'm exhausted.

724
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,480
Katie, you expect so much.

725
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,757
Oh, but look what I've got.

726
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,515
Jesus! Your director lives here?

727
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,715
Actually, he lives off the garage.
The servants live here.

728
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,155
How can he work here?

729
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,155
Bissinger doesn't work,
he's the director.

730
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:01,046
As long as you're writing in
France by next fall, I don't care.

731
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,555
- Everybody's here.
- Everybody who's anybody.

732
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,235
- No ice skating rink?
- It's in the cellar.

733
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,715
- Hubbell!
- Hi, George.

734
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,115
George Bissinger.
Glad you came.

735
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,360
My wife, Vicki.

736
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,595
- How are you?
- It's Kate, isn't it?

737
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,595
It's Katie.

738
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,075
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.

739
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,400
Rhea!

740
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,315
I want you to meet my agent.

741
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,435
Reportedly the greatest in town.

742
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,475
If I were a great agent,
would I be an agent?

743
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,675
- Nice to meet you.
- You think those are croquet balls...

744
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,275
...but it's her collection
of shrunken heads.

745
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,155
Have you seen the
Bissinger collection?

746
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:45,555
You think these Hollywood intellectuals
plan to overthrow the government?

747
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,635
They couldn't overthrow
Louella Parsons.

748
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,515
In '37, in Munich,
Hitler was a joke too.

749
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,195
Paula Reisner,
our resident pessimist.

750
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,600
Sorry. I'm sorry.

751
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:59,338
They're coming to investigate
all us communist subversives.

752
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,515
They're out to get election yardage
from the silver screen.

753
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,555
They're getting people
to testify secretly.

754
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,680
Horses' asses.

755
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:12,035
Maybe. But we can't even write our
congressman. He's on the committee.

756
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,465
Your shot, George.

757
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,435
- Alice in Wonderland. Come on.
- Thank you.

758
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,115
You're not home
making the script brilliant?

759
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,355
Listen to the producer.
You don't even understand it.

760
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,755
I'm glad you came.
I was gonna call you.

761
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,315
I'm giving J.J. a birthday party.

762
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:31,275
- 45, huh?
- You gotta come as a Marx Brother.

763
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:35,628
- K-K-Katie, you could come as Karl.
- Still stuttering?

764
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,915
I'm not coming as Groucho.

765
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,806
Come as Harpo, that way you
won't be able to talk.

766
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,898
I think your director's an idiot.

767
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,560
Too high? Too low?

768
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,635
Trying to tell me something?

769
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,680
What? He's here?
In the room? Good God!

770
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,635
Ten years in Leavenworth, 11 years in
Twelveworth, or 5 and 10 in Woolworth.

771
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,715
--to control thought.
Censorship.

772
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,435
Let's not dramatize this.
It'll all blow over.

773
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,235
- That line is necessary.
- It's the point of the whole scene.

774
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,275
The point's made by the
dancers in red, white and blue.

775
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:23,235
There are no dancers in his book.
You can't just have dancers.

776
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,235
Please.

777
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,155
Brooks, if we get this organized,
you've got to talk.

778
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,755
- I can't talk in front--
- Come on, Brooks.

779
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,715
- It's gorgeous if you do.
- I'll write, all right?

780
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,435
He doesn't understand.

781
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,155
- I never liked his movies anyway.
- "Honk-honk," said the duck.

782
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,355
You rang?
Your wish is my command.

783
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,035
This morning I shot
an elephant in my pyjamas....

784
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:47,435
- What are you hungry for?
- I'm hungry for your absence.

785
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,235
--meeting at my house Sunday.

786
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,795
- George, is Paula Reisner a Red?
- My heavens, I don't know. Why?

787
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,835
- It's something I heard.
- You listen to the wrong people.

788
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,111
Come on. I have an early day.

789
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,415
- He thinks Bissinger's right.
- How dare you--

790
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,715
- Hey.
- Hey, what?

791
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,222
Could you stop?
This is coming out in French.

792
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,155
Maybe Bissinger will like it
better in French.

793
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,520
Taste this.

794
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,120
How is it?

795
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,120
It's great.

796
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,155
I'll study French cooking while
you finish your novel.

797
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,354
Done much thinking about it?

798
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,760
No, not much.

799
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,729
Well, it's very hard here, you know.

800
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,235
But when we're ensconced
in our villa....

801
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:09,235
How about you? Have you read
any good books lately?

802
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,075
No, but I wrote two reports of books
that haven't been written yet.

803
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:17,235
- You'll get the sack.
- I'll go back to brain surgery.

804
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,075
They never read my synopses anyway.
They just pay me for them.

805
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,675
Why don't you quit? After all, it's--

806
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,155
I'm laying a nice
nest egg for France.

807
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,235
- Italy.
- France.

808
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,588
- Spain?
- Never.

809
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,155
China, maybe.
My phony synopsis takes place there.

810
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,520
China?

811
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,995
Public's fed up with Westerns, Myrna.
High time we had an Eastern.

812
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,040
Got a title?

813
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,760
Shevuos! Exclamation point.

814
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,080
Sounds catchy.

815
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,435
There's a kibbutz of Chinese Jews
living in a rice paddy.

816
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,403
- And he--?
- No, she cooks communist rice patties.

817
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,235
He gets the idea--

818
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,280
Of calling them matzos.

819
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,555
You read the book!

820
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,920
Backwards.

821
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,052
Oh, I got one for you.

822
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,323
I can't take another one.

823
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,480
Loudmouthed Jewish girl...

824
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,395
...from New York City,
comes to Malibu, California...

825
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:13,055
- ...tells her gorgeous goyisher guy...
- Good alliteration.

826
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,560
...that she's pregnant, you see.
And...

827
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,200
...and he just looks at her and....

828
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,520
Are you kidding?

829
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,803
- Don't be afraid to touch.
- I'm not.

830
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Get it, Katie, sweetheart!

831
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,520
All right, one more time.

832
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,675
- Hungry?
- Answer the question!

833
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,595
You have no right
to make me name the names--

834
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,400
Sergeant! Take the witness away.

835
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,275
You've just heard
excerpts from today's...

836
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,755
...session of the
House Un-American....

837
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,755
- I'll make the salad.
- Thank you.

838
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,235
Watch out, the paint
takes forever to dry.

839
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:34,475
- You'll be in Beverly Hills by then.
- France, not Beverly Hills.

840
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,155
Not if Hubbell gets
the deal I'm working on.

841
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,200
What deal?

842
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:42,915
Three more pictures. Provided this one
works out of course.

843
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,795
- Think he's interested?
- I certainly hope so.

844
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:51,302
It'll mean a lot more money, Kate.
You and Hubbell could live in style.

845
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,409
I thought we did, Rhea.

846
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,915
Pop sent me a list of names.

847
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,675
"For my grandson, the following
names are okay with me:

848
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:05,720
Thomas Jefferson Gardiner,
Solomon David Gardiner...

849
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,320
...and Eugene V. Debs Gardiner."

850
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,355
What if it's a girl?

851
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,555
If it's a girl, there's only
one name, my mother's.

852
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,985
Yeah, what's that?

853
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,520
Rachel.

854
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,111
So keep your fingers crossed.

855
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,275
What's this picture about?

856
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,960
Cowboys and Indians.

857
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,355
Not too loud. Brooks wrote it.

858
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,875
- Tonight, the Indians are the good guys.
- Can you do that?

859
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,155
Well, it's un-American,
but we can try.

860
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,795
I think I'm calm enough.
Vicki, let's start.

861
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,835
Don't try the trick with the sunglasses.
I know when you're sleeping.

862
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,115
--the best Western I've ever read.

863
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,520
I mean it.

864
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,435
There they are.
Hey, Velez and Yolanda.

865
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,075
- I saved you guys a seat.
- Thank you.

866
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,155
- We didn't miss anything, did we?
- All right, Floyd.

867
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,920
- How's my godchild?
- Very happy.

868
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,200
My God.

869
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,920
What the hell is going on?

870
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,723
- What did it, George?
- Your Picasso!

871
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,262
What's the trouble?

872
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,640
Testing. Do you get us?

873
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,960
What the hell is going on?

874
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,120
We're being recorded.

875
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,075
- Would you knock it off up there?
- Floyd, stop it!

876
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,155
Can't hear me.

877
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,120
Floyd, hold it!

878
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:19,511
I'm going to sue the U.S.
government for that painting.

879
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,915
We've got to do something.
Do you have a lawyer?

880
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,235
Shouldn't we let him know
what happened?

881
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,835
How do we know this room
isn't bugged too?

882
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:32,915
- This country wouldn't believe this.
- They'll never know about this.

883
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,675
We can't let this happen.
We have rights.

884
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:40,475
- Can't the studios do something?
- We have got to do something. We.

885
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,035
Bissinger says this scene
isn't necessary.

886
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,772
I told him he's wrong.

887
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,720
What do you think?

888
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,955
- He's the director.
- You're the producer!

889
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,520
Easy, will you?

890
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,120
Yeah, easy.

891
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,120
Hey, Hub.

892
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,915
Do you know what's going on
over at your house?

893
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,955
Sure.

894
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
You know?

895
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,755
Overthrowing the government,
I suppose.

896
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,955
Let's see, Sunday's volleyball....

897
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,355
Yeah, they like to overthrow
the government on Monday.

898
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,275
They're going to D.C.
to challenge the committee...

899
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,320
...on the basis of
the First Amendment.

900
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
What?

901
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,720
Well, well.

902
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:34,849
- Think anybody knows what it says?
- Katie does.

903
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,320
That's for sure.

904
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,395
Some actor comes up to me...

905
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,755
...and says this line
doesn't make any sense.

906
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,875
What do you think?

907
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:49,195
If they go, it'll make more trouble.
They may not have jobs to come back to.

908
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,163
What do you want from me?

909
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,391
Tell Katie to stay out of it.

910
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,800
You tell her.

911
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,200
I will.

912
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,323
I'll buy tickets to that.

913
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,275
Would you just tell her to go easy?

914
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,835
Sure. You tell Bissinger to go easy.
You're the producer.

915
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,265
What's eating you?

916
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,720
Nothing. The war's over, right?

917
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,160
Movies....

918
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:26,520
Do you realize this is the first
job we've ever had?

919
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,755
Athletic Scholarship.
Doesn't that count?

920
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,415
Doesn't count, buddy.

921
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:35,115
Well, then, Officer,
Landing Craft, South Pacific?

922
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,160
Nope.

923
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,428
Why? We got paid $150 a month.

924
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,520
Doesn't count.

925
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,120
- You want a drink?
- No.

926
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,597
There's a little trouble at home.
I have to keep my wits about me.

927
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,320
Old Carol Ann.

928
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,920
Don't take any crap.
To the both of us.

929
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,920
And all the absent friends,
class of '37.

930
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,475
- Is this the Gardiner house?
- And I'm the gardener.

931
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,366
- How are you doing?
- Okay, so far--

932
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:33,515
Your lover chain smokes, no doubt to
compensate for his extreme shortness.

933
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:36,115
He has an enormous heart
and no sense of humour.

934
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,560
You found us out.

935
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,035
Calls himself Brooks Kropatkin,
but it's not his real name.

936
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,080
- What is it?
- Carpenter.

937
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,431
Carpenter! Who told you that?

938
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,755
J.J. With whom I was not drinking...

939
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:51,800
...since he no longer drinks
due to trouble at home.

940
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,631
Well, Carol Ann's 33.
Not many moves left.

941
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,182
Well, we're all 33, practically.

942
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,560
Not you. Not the quiz kid.

943
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,991
What were you, 16 in college?

944
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,018
What's gonna happen?

945
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:10,837
You're going to Washington.

946
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,782
I meant with J.J. and Carol Ann.

947
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:19,849
That's another house. In this house,
the wife is going to D.C.

948
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,511
Gonna take the baby with you?

949
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,385
I thought I might.

950
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,142
Nothing like an early education.

951
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,315
I'd like her to learn
not to be frightened.

952
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,400
Her?

953
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,600
Him.

954
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,837
Why don't you come with us?

955
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:52,135
We're kind of back
where we started, aren't we?

956
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,803
That's not true, Hubbell.

957
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:03,040
Okay. Now why don't
we all stay home?

958
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,360
I can't.

959
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,475
--and named the names of
14 of his fellow actors.

960
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,315
He described their
various associations...

961
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,675
...with subversive organizations.

962
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:20,797
Ten men of the original 19
who refused to testify....

963
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,320
And there he is...

964
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,800
...Jack Armstrong,
the all-American boy.

965
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:43,295
- Hey, you look good.
- I hate it!

966
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:47,840
I like it!

967
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:51,040
Isn't she lovely?
America's sweetheart.

968
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:59,515
Look at her go. I'd forgotten.
She really was getting to those people.

969
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:02,252
Take a look at some of those faces.

970
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,880
Oh, she was a spellbinder.

971
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,883
I'd forgotten about that.

972
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,080
She's beautiful.

973
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,360
I'm exhausted.

974
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,075
Do you have any comment
regarding the Hollywood 10?

975
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:42,515
They're running toward martyrdom
for nothing but their own destruction.

976
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,595
They're standing up for principle.

977
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,995
If you don't like this
country, get out!

978
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,155
It's my country too!

979
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,662
They could've denied everything.

980
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,298
They didn't want to.

981
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,155
Can we do this
someplace else?

982
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,915
Why are you here?
You might get put on a list.

983
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,515
I refuse to be intimidated.

984
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,155
Well, those 10 men feel
exactly the same way.

985
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,200
Free speech is all
we're talking about.

986
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,315
They're fighting for your right
to make any movie you want.

987
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:13,129
And all you can do is strut
around here making simple remarks.

988
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:18,875
Could we get a statement
from Mrs. Gardiner?

989
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:23,115
I'd like to ask these people
why they think we just fought a war.

990
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,840
What are you people afraid of?

991
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,655
Shut your mouth, you commie bitch!

992
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:01,557
You two wait here
till the crowd clears.

993
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,080
Are you okay?

994
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,391
You're bleeding.

995
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,080
I'm fine.

996
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:18,194
It's always fun
meeting trains, you know?

997
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:22,080
I'm sorry, Hubbell.
I really didn't expect this.

998
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,686
You didn't expect to get a chance
to tell off the world either.

999
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:32,755
- Is that what you think I'm doing?
- You bet I do.

1000
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,108
I'm not telling off the world.

1001
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,275
I'm just standing up
for something I believe in.

1002
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,515
You're not angry when
Bissinger ridicules those men?

1003
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:44,795
Calling them martyrs because
they have guts...

1004
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:48,915
...to fight for their Bill of Rights,
his Bill of Rights and yours!

1005
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,475
We don't have any Bill of Rights.

1006
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,675
We'll never have free speech.

1007
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:56,315
We never will if people
won't take a stand.

1008
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,515
We never will have because
people are scared.

1009
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,120
This isn't college.

1010
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:05,395
This is grown-up politics, Katie.
And it's stupid and dangerous.

1011
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,275
You're telling me to shut up
because it's dangerous?

1012
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,235
I'm telling you it's a waste.

1013
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,875
And that those men
are only gonna get hurt.

1014
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,315
And that nothing is gonna change.

1015
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,035
And after jail,
after years of bad blood...

1016
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:23,155
...when it's practical for a fascist
producer to hire a communist writer...

1017
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,675
...because his movie's
in trouble, he'll do it.

1018
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:29,315
They'll make movies, have dinner,
they'll play tennis...

1019
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,595
...make passes at each other's wives.
What did anybody go to jail for?

1020
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,717
For what? A political spat?

1021
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:41,275
You're telling me to close my eyes
and watch people being destroyed...

1022
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:45,035
...so you can work in a town
that doesn't have spine enough...

1023
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,275
...to stand up for
anything but a buck!

1024
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:51,595
I'm telling you that people are more
important than a goddamn witch hunt.

1025
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,640
You and me. Not causes.
Not principles.

1026
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:58,320
Hubbell, people are their principles.

1027
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:11,945
The heads of the studios have
reversed their positions...

1028
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:15,680
...and any employee who...

1029
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:19,995
...is an unfriendly witness
before the committee is...

1030
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,280
...fired.

1031
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,280
Oh, Jesus.

1032
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,035
So now we have an official blacklist.

1033
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,715
It's an open season
for witch hunters...

1034
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,400
...and stool pigeons.

1035
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:37,795
And now the problem is,
how to convince the public...

1036
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:42,160
...that a stool pigeon is a hero.

1037
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:45,920
You are like these
damn palm trees.

1038
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:50,715
They don't belong here either.
They were brought in and they look it.

1039
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,920
I'm sure that they
don't like it either.

1040
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:58,622
- What if he does, Paula?
- What is more important to you?

1041
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,680
He is.

1042
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:05,480
That's your choice, Katie.

1043
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:13,280
- Give him my love too.
- I will.

1044
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,080
Thanks, Paula.

1045
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,115
It's no reflection on anything
except that you're new to this...

1046
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:24,920
...film technique.

1047
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:29,715
Especially for the novelist.
He's too close to his own material.

1048
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,280
I'm not a novelist.

1049
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,788
I'd like to think of myself...

1050
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,355
...as a screenwriter.

1051
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,475
I wanna be up front with you.

1052
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,289
I know what changes have to be made.

1053
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,275
But can you make them?

1054
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:50,166
Nobody else understands that story.
Nobody knows it. It's mine.

1055
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,840
Mine.

1056
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,715
I know where it came from.

1057
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,145
I know what the heart of it is.

1058
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,275
You remember those few days
before the war started.

1059
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:12,240
Before we had to change--
You don't lose what I know about it.

1060
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:14,875
Work with me.

1061
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:16,715
Work with me closely, fine.

1062
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,395
And I know the dialogue from the book
is slowing the film up.

1063
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,080
But I can fix that.

1064
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,680
I learn fast. I always have.

1065
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:27,880
Things come--

1066
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,658
Christ, I can do it.

1067
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:42,126
I know what you want.
I know what your concept is.

1068
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,680
I'll make your changes.

1069
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:47,840
Let me.

1070
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,782
With no resistance?

1071
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,640
No.

1072
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,400
No resistance.

1073
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:15,680
Bad times?

1074
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,880
Can't be all bad.

1075
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:23,545
How's the picture?

1076
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,200
Troubled.

1077
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,717
I'm going back to New York.

1078
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,080
New York.

1079
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,385
When do you leave?

1080
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:51,942
Not until tomorrow.

1081
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:00,515
I'm getting rid of some things
in my apartment.

1082
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,480
There's some champagne.

1083
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,840
For bon voyage.

1084
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:28,280
Well, it's getting better.

1085
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,880
Better....

1086
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,680
It's most unusual.

1087
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:49,080
When it's slow, it seems
necessary to be slow.

1088
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,155
Of course, with the audience....

1089
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,075
Thank you, Paula, my dear.

1090
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:54,915
I'll have my brandy in bed.

1091
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,715
We'll conduct the postmortem tomorrow.
Good night, Paula...

1092
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,675
...Hubbell, J.J., silent Kate.

1093
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,643
Thank you, Floyd.
Thank you very much.

1094
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,760
Good night, Mr. Bissinger.

1095
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:14,635
J.J., shall we go and have some wine?
You will tell me your problems...

1096
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:19,600
...and I'll tell you how the
un-American gentlemen...

1097
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,080
...offered to give me some names
to name in Washington.

1098
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,080
Take care, darling.

1099
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,948
True to life.
So true to life.

1100
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:36,545
I'll be up late, case you guys wanna
stop by on your way to the beach.

1101
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,880
Well, that was a gripping experience.

1102
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,720
"So true to life, darling."

1103
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:01,035
The only picture she
hasn't knocked is Potemkin.

1104
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,795
Probably a dyke anyway.

1105
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:05,763
She is not.
She has two grandchildren.

1106
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,458
Katie, the day you die,
you'll still be a nice Jewish girl.

1107
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,418
Are you still a nice gentile boy?

1108
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,280
I never was.

1109
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,166
I only looked it to you.

1110
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:35,755
- That's not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.

1111
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:41,235
When you love someone, from Roosevelt
to me, you go deaf, dumb and blind.

1112
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,880
Not blind, Hubbell.

1113
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,280
And certainly not dumb.

1114
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:01,680
Who told you?

1115
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,280
A friend.

1116
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,280
Some friend.

1117
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,555
Well, it's a friendly town...

1118
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:17,831
...if you don't mind having
your friends inform on you.

1119
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:22,778
I suppose you'll say
it doesn't mean anything.

1120
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,120
It doesn't.

1121
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:33,595
Your picture will be a smash, Hubbell.
Congratulations.

1122
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,480
But you didn't like it.

1123
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,237
Let's say I appreciated it.

1124
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:41,555
What didn't you like?

1125
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,369
Are you finished for the night, sir?

1126
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:56,560
Yes.

1127
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:58,680
Thank you.

1128
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,982
Why did you have to go with her?

1129
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:17,840
Tell me I'm not good enough.
Tell me I talk too much.

1130
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:22,243
You don't like my perfume,
my family, my pot roast.

1131
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:27,145
But you didn't have to go
back to Beekman Place, did you?

1132
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,280
Katie, what's wrong with us...

1133
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:41,160
...has nothing to do with another girl.

1134
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,480
Oh, give up.

1135
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:49,680
Please.

1136
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:55,600
I can't. I hate what
you did to your book.

1137
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,840
I hate the picture.

1138
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:01,235
I hate the palm trees.
I wish it would rain.

1139
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:02,880
Oh, I want....

1140
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,480
I want....

1141
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:09,760
What?

1142
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,551
I want us to love each other.

1143
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:09,515
Give me a beer.

1144
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:12,098
Coming up, skipper.
There you go.

1145
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:16,515
What the hell. It doesn't
matter anyway. She wasn't much.

1146
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,275
Don't get sloppy.
You had some good days.

1147
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,880
It's the rum.

1148
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:24,840
No excuse, buddy.

1149
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,035
It's not like, you know...

1150
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:31,120
...losing somebody like Katie.

1151
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:34,080
That would be a loss.

1152
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,080
Best Saturday afternoon?

1153
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,995
1933, when "Brute" Holland
was out with a bad knee.

1154
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,040
Best month?

1155
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:52,480
April.

1156
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:54,480
Best year?

1157
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:57,880
Best year....

1158
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,400
1944.

1159
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:03,680
No, '45....

1160
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:52,465
It's amazing how decisions
are forced on you willy-nilly.

1161
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,720
You never did want to finish
your book, did you?

1162
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,080
I don't know.

1163
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:16,406
I never thought there was much point.

1164
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:25,197
And you never really wanted
to go to France, did you?

1165
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,520
No, I didn't. You wanted me to.

1166
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:36,680
Oh, boy.

1167
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,120
Oh, girl.

1168
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,080
Are you all right?

1169
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,766
Wouldn't it be lovely
if we were old?

1170
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,194
We'd have survived all this.

1171
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:02,675
Everything would be
easy and uncomplicated.

1172
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:05,335
The way it was when we were young.

1173
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,637
It was never uncomplicated.

1174
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,280
But it was lovely.

1175
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,480
Wasn't it?

1176
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:24,440
Yeah. It was lovely.

1177
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,252
Will you do me one favour, Hubbell?

1178
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,535
Stay with me till the baby's born?

1179
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:46,409
More flowers for you, Mrs. Gardiner.

1180
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:56,960
I thought....

1181
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:01,960
- It's a nice room.
- Yeah, it is.

1182
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,886
Did you get your father?

1183
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,994
I'd like to call her Rachel.

1184
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:16,440
Fine.

1185
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:21,698
Did you see her yet?

1186
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,480
She's little.

1187
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,680
I've got the crib together.

1188
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:27,206
Oh, you don't have it ironed anymore!

1189
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:28,858
- What?
- Your hair.

1190
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:31,160
No, I don't.

1191
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:32,680
It's pretty.

1192
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:33,960
Thank you.

1193
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:37,117
Still married?

1194
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,446
Sure. What are you
doing in New York?

1195
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:43,114
I've been writing a TV show.

1196
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:44,920
Really?

1197
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:47,755
There's an experience.
It happens so fast.

1198
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,155
Shoot it in one day,
live, on the air.

1199
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,795
Everybody in a constant
state of panic.

1200
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,917
You remember how radio was.

1201
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:55,995
Same thing...

1202
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:00,880
...only with cameras. And craziness!
Make a great comic novel.

1203
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,754
It sounds wonderful, really.

1204
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,760
Your taxi's ready, sir.

1205
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:13,995
I'm awfully late.
Please call and come for a drink?

1206
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:17,155
It's the only David X. Cohen
in the book.

1207
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,662
What's the "X" for?

1208
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:21,569
The only David X. Cohen in the book.

1209
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:27,195
I'm sorry I'm late.
How are we doing, huh?

1210
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:30,115
Oh, wonderful.
We've got 122 on that one.

1211
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,715
And Charlene called.
She's doing great.

1212
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,960
- Marvellous.
- Wonderful.

1213
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:37,675
That's a good one too,
don't you think?

1214
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:38,955
What about Eileen?

1215
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
You never give up, do you?

1216
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,212
Only when I'm absolutely forced to.

1217
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
But I'm a very good loser.

1218
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:03,108
Better than I am.

1219
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:06,428
Well, I've had...

1220
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,920
...more practise.

1221
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,995
Your girl is lovely, Hubbell.

1222
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:19,809
Bring her for a drink
when you come.

1223
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:24,760
I can't come, Katie.

1224
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:26,960
I can't.

1225
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,760
I know.

1226
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:08,600
How is she?

1227
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:13,360
She is just beautiful.

1228
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,231
You would be so proud of her.

1229
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:18,760
I'm glad.

1230
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:24,178
Is he a good father?

1231
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,520
Yes. Very.

1232
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,040
Good.

1233
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:51,400
See you, Katie.

1234
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,560
See you, Hubbell.

1235
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:09,760
Ban the bomb!

1236
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:15,209
Join the thousands of Americans
who are protesting the use....
