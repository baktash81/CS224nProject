120
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,470
I don't know. I was just
walking out of my house,

121
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,960
turned my back, and the
next second he was there.

122
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,770
Like magic almost.

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,980

124
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,110

125
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,910

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,810
Nothing.

You are. Nobody loves
you as much as I do.

134
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,260
It's because everybody's
scared of you.

135
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,730
If you're not going
to be my girl,

144
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,140
Why ain't I welcome?
Or it's ok to lay here?

145
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,730
Take your pick.

146
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,240
Hey, you new in

147
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,150

Jake, I'm Billy Hankins.

150
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,390
I work over at Big Kay's
slinging burgers.

151
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,390
Listen, you ever need
a burger in Brooks,

152
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,190

153
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,060

don't you think?

154
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,460
Me and her are pretty

155
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,870
Well, actually she's...

156
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,100
She used to be tight
with my brother.

157
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,170
She's got real problems with that
lunatic she's with there now.

158
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,010
What kind of problems?

159
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,810
Well, Packard's
a mistake of nature.

160
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,450
A genetic misfire.

161
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,750
He's what?

162
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,120
Packard gets crazy jealous

163
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,520
if anybody even looks
at Keri cross-eyed.

164
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,920
You got to wear dark glasses
so he doesn't catch you at it.

165
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,130
That includes your brother,
I assume, right?

169
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,020
He was murdered
up on the Willow River.

170
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,410
But nobody ever knew who did it.

171
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,780

00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,850
Lot of duck butter out
at the lake today, eh, Pack.

180
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,210
Quiff City, here I come!

181
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,450
See that guy over there?

182
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,920
The one with Billy Hankins?

183
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,050
What about him?

184
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,220
Looks like a dork to me.

185
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,070
Lot of dorks going
around these days.

186
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,880
Whole town
is seething with them.

187
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,500
They're crawling
out of the woodwork.

188
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,640
- Shut up.
- Ok.

189
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,170
Drives that motorbike
over there.

190
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,470
You see him or Billy around Keri,
I wanna know about it.

191
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,110
Oh, shit, Pack, I'd rather
be working on the car...

192
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,120
We do things my way, Skank,
and it's a lot of fun.

193
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,650
I know that's easy
for you to forget

194
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,010
with your brain turning
to mush and all.

195
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,730
Actually, my brain's
functioning a-ok, dude.

196
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,020
So let's just do things
my way, huh?

197
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,260
Before I have to cut another ringhole
in this flap you call your ear.

198
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,010
Hey, we'll remind
the cock-stacker.

199
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,780
We'll use our influence,
hey, Gut?

200
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,140
We'll use our influence.

201
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,730
- Remember, the kid on the bike.
- You got it, Pack.

202
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:55,970
There.

203
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,450
It's all programmed in, man.

204
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,680
Good.

205
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,390
And, Skank...
Do me a favor, will you?

206
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,630
Get rid of that zombie
piss you're drinking

207
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,970
before it turns you
into a mushroom.

208
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,770
No problem.

209
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,010
Yeah, right.

210
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,540
Ah, damn.

211
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,660
Mushroom.

212
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,290
It's a nice day, huh?

213
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,220
This water's a bit chilly
for my taste.

214
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,130
Good thing it's warm out.

215
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,660
Sorry about the ride
this morning.

216
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,520
It's ok.

217
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,620
Billy Hankins a friend of yours?

218
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,710
Yeah, sort of.

219
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,610
Keri!

220
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,910
I'd better go now.

221
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,960
Don't go because of me.

222
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,180
Not because of you.

223
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,780
It's because of him.

224
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,670
You don't know him.

225
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,490
Keri!

226
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,100
You know, if you want
to come by some night...

227
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,070
Yeah?

228
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,460
I mean after work.

229
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,820
I'll be there.

230
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,480
- Well, so will I then.
- Ok.

231
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,600
The thing is, where's work?

232
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,540
Big Kay's Burgers.

233
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,430
- Big Kay's Burgers?
- Yeah.

234
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,140
- All right.
- Ok.

I got a cowboy out there
wants 2 burgers, rare.

246
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,500
And I mean rare!

247
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,400

the beast to start.

254
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,860
Come on, you goof.

255
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,820
Hey, it's the fumes
off the grill, Keri.

256
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,800
It hurts my mind.

257
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,730
Ah, come on!

258
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,600
Oh, God, it's him. Hurry up.

I'm tryin'. Tryin'!

260
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,300
Hurry up!

261
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,800
Oh, man.

262
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,580
Hello, Keri.

263
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,010
Looks like I got here
just in time.

264
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,230
You. In the car.

265
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,220
I mean now.

266
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,980
Hey, listen, Pack, I was
just on my way out, too.

267
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
Hold your horses, guy.

268
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,160
Packard, please.

269
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,430
Just get in the car
for a minute.

270
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,270
I just want to speak
to Billy alone.

271
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,840
Help her out.

272
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,590
So what happened here?

273
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,420
Looks to me like you ran out of those
all-beef patties kind of early today, huh?

274
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,130
Hey, don't worry, Pack.

275
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,690
We still got plenty of dog food.

276
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,440
Hey, Packard, let's
grind up some meat, huh?

277
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,760
Is this guy being humorous or is
he just a naturally gifted child?

278
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,540
I swear to God. I'll rip your
head off and piss on your...

279
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,150
Hold your water, Oggie.
This is business.

280
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,960
Nothing personal, guy.

281
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,690
That's a nice car you have here.

282
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,170
Now where were you going
with my girl?

283
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,870
I was just giving her a ride home, man.
Give me a break.

284
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,520
Hey, Rughead!

285
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,590
What's this Triumph worth?

286
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,550
You're not getting it, Packard!

287
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,610
You're not taking it.

288
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,430
Who said anything
about taking it?

289
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,630
I didn't say nothing.
I know I didn't.

290
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,760
I tell you what.

291
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,820
I'm going to give you the same
chance I give everybody else.

292
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,160
We're gonna race for it.

293
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,030
Look, Pack,
you don't get my car.

294
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,116
And if you're not nice
you're not going to get your burgers

295
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,410
with the Mayo and Thousand
Island the way you love 'em.

296
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,690
Billy, I thought
you understood me.

297
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,550
This isn't a negotiation.

298
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,830
Rugs...

299
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,850
You ever seen
one of those before?

300
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,900
Nah, let's just add it
to our collection first.

301
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,840
We can figure out
what it is second.

302
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,170
We'll continue this
discussion later,

303
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,210
and I'll enjoy it.

304
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,840
I'll see you later, eh, faggot?

305
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,450
Hey, Packard, I think
he's going to Sandy Bar.

306
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,420
Let me take him this time!

307
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,090
All right, it's your turn, dude.

308
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,820
Let's go!
<i>All right!</i>

309
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,380
All right, I want you
to tear this guy a new asshole.

310
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,280
Do it to him Oggie-style.

311
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,480
I'll burn this Iranian.

312
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,600
Ok, the first to
Rattler's crossing wins!

313
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,390
You lose the race,

314
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,490
you lose your car.

315
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,630
Agreed?

316
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,640
Stay on your side
of the road, man.

317
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,470
Ok, let's get it on!

318
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,040
Send them off!

319
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,010
Say what?

320
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,480
I said send them off!

321
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,210
Take the Willow River cut-off.

322
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,150
Ready!

323
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,050
Set!

324
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,220
Go!

325
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,330
<i>Roger that, Murphy.</i>

326
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,190
<i>Paramedics have been notified,</i>

327
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,530
<i>they are on their way.</i>

328
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,970
- You think he made it?
- You gotta be kidding me.

329
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,700
- Local kid?
- He used to be.

330
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,390
Call the meat wagon,
then get a hold of Loomis,

331
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,260
tell him we got a possible
D.O.A. up here.

332
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,660
Loomis, we got
a snuffed kid up here

333
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,320
at Muletail Coulee.
It's Oggie Fisher.

334
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,070
<i>Roger that,
this is Stokes, Murphy.</i>

335
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,700
<i>We just saw a paramedic
down at the cut-off...</i>

336
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,230
I've been waiting to catch
you guys in the act.

337
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,780
I've been waiting and watching.

338
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,380
Congratulations.

339
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,210
You caught us talking.

340
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,450
There's no law against
that, is there, officer?

341
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,510
Unless, of course,
I got my wires crossed

342
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,290
and you caught us
speaking without a per...

343
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,630
Clam it, wise guy!

344
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,500
There's a dead kid
3 miles up the highway.

345
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,500
Yeah, that's right. Dead.

346
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,700
Run off the highway and killed.

347
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,600
Ok, pal.

348
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,160
Time to drain the drug overdose

349
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,830
sloshing above your eyebrows

350
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,280
and tell me who the dude was
driving that other car.

351
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,150
With all due respect, sir.

352
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,120
If you're putting us
under arrest,

353
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,590
I do believe we have
right to counsel.

354
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,070
What about you, maggot?
You got anything to say,

355
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,740
or are your veins bloated
with brain eradicator, too?

356
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,670
Yeah, well, who got killed?

357
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,310
Oggie Fisher.

358
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,460
And there isn't enough left of him
to stick it in a cigar box

359
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,180
<i>Hey, Loomis, I think
you ought to see this!</i>

360
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,590
Oh, Murphy, what for?

361
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,560
I think you should see this.

362
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,370
Oh, that's ugly.

363
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,770
Kid ought to be dog meat.

364
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,770
Wait a minute.

365
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,240
Yeah, Loomis,

366
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,340
this kid smashed down a canyon

367
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,440
through fire and bustin' glass.

368
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,410
Must have been
1,000 degrees in that car.

369
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,780
Uh-huh. At least.

370
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,280
Where's his eyes?

371
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,790
Sent cats climbing up my spine

372
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,650
when I saw them
hauling this corpse

373
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,760
out of that canyon.

374
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,820
Clean, as if he come
out of a hot tub.

375
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,600
I'm worried, Loomis.
Something ain't right.

376
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,700
Well...

377
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,230
Get him into town
and box him up.

378
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,240
I've still got a few rocks
to turn over up here.

379
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,610
All right, load him up.

380
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,650
You don't even want to know
what I just saw, asswipe.

381
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,620
Now spill it. Who was
driving that other car?

382
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,920
Nobody ever saw it before.

383
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,420
Wasn't a local car. It was...

384
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,420
It was customized or something.

385
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,460
Yeah, it was like
a V-Dub conversion

386
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:00,500
and a surf-rack on top.
It was awesome, man.

387
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,600
Well, no one seems
to be too broken up

388
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,470
about Mr. Fisher laying there,

389
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,460
splayed out to 4 points
of the compass.

390
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,280
But, then again,
maybe that's what things

391
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,550
have come down to, huh?

392
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,250
Deputy Halifax over there
is gonna take down

393
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,520
a list of names for me,

394
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,250
so if any of you guys
are planning on

395
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,290
taking a vacation
in the next few days,

396
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,490
you can just forget it.

397
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,320
I'll be visiting you
again with warrants,

398
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,860
Mr. Attorney.

399
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,530
Ok, Halifax, they're all yours.

400
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,400
Oggie Fisher.

401
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,750
They got us all. Let's cruise.

402
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,790
<i>Yo, Gutterboy!</i>

403
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,750
<i>What, Skank?</i>

404
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,480
<i>Let's jam.</i>

405
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,720
Yo, Rugs.

406
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,190
That kid in the Daytona gave
me a hell of a run last night.

407
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,110
If I hadn't tried to kill him,
he might beat me.

408
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,030
When's the new injection
plant going to be ready?

409
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,810
Tonight, maybe? Maybe tomorrow.

410
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,810
The digital radio killers,
they're almost ready, too.

411
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,810
Good. The sooner the better.

412
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,810
Things are getting a little

413
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,680
too equal these days.

414
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,510
Sure, Packard.

415
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,800
Hey.

416
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,240
Hey!

417
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,630
What seems to be the problem?

418
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,770
I just can't believe
that Oggie's dead.

419
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,770
I mean, he lived just
up the street from me.

420
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,790
I just can't believe it.

421
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,980
Oggie's no loss, believe me.

422
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,100
Now, tell me something.

423
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,610
What were you doing with
Billy Hankins today?

424
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,520
I was tired.
I decided to go home.

425
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,590
Don't lie to me.

426
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,620
I love you too much
for you to lie.

427
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,790
I'm not lying, Packard.

428
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,960
You and me...

429
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,670
We're like blood brothers.

430
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,930
I guess you could call us

431
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,110
blood lovers.

432
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Because that's how
much I love you.

433
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,090
And when you love someone
as much as I love you,

434
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,590
after a while, you feel nothing.

435
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,470
And when you feel nothing,

436
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,070
you can do anything.

437
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,550
I don't love you.

438
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,000
I've never made love to you.

439
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,330
I never will.

440
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,010
You will.

441
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,680
Hey, Rug. How we doing
on the digital radio killer?

442
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,980
It's tits, man.

443
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,140
It's totally functional.

444
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,850
Yeah, what about
the injection plant?

445
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,910
Oh, it's ready.

446
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,820
It's ready?

447
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,120
It'll blow away anything
this side of the Mississippi.

448
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,450
Good. Now all we have to do

449
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,590
is fit it in the 'Vette.

450
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,830
I can fit this thing in a Go-kart,
what are you worried about?

451
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,000
When this thing
gonna be chopped?

452
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,640
Tomorrow morn... Morning.

453
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,940
Tonight.

454
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,010
You got that, Gutterboy?

455
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,250
<i>Yeah, ok.</i>

456
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,530
What about those...

457
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,140
Yeah, Packard, I got
those elbow parts

458
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,650
sold to the Nagoles boys
for 2,900 bucks.

459
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,560
Yeah, that old guy was
pretty pissed off.

460
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,970
Look, guy...

461
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,960
Loomis is out there
looking to bust everyone.

462
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,640
I mean, losing Oggie
ain't no big deal,

463
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,660
and that's a hell
of a car you got there.

464
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,880
Buddy, I'd put that kidney
buster down if I was you.

465
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,230
This place is filled with
ether and acetylene, dig?

466
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,600
No!

467
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,460
Hey!

468
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,680
I don't know what
your problem is, guy, but...

469
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,850
Hey!

470
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,310
I'm out of here!

471
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,900
Keep going, man!

472
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,250
Holy shit!

473
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,830
No!

474
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,030
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

475
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,930
Skank, you pussy!

476
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,500
- Skank!
- Yeah?

477
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,040
Who is that guy?

478
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:21,150
I don't know, but whoever he was,
he's weird and pissed off.

479
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,910
- Red?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

480
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,930
Loomis here.

481
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,770
Hey, Loomis.

482
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,850
This is a real strange
place you got here.

483
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,400
Really unique in its
depressing qualities, huh?

484
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,300
What do you need?
Bingo.

485
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,070
You got a couple of
cockroaches working here.

486
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,870
I need a word with them.

487
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,340
My nephew Skank

488
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,480
and his pal Gutterboy?
Over there.

489
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,440
Thanks.

490
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,760
Cleared for take off.

491
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,290
Morning, fellas.

492
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,870
Yo, Skank!

493
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,380
This is a nice place
you got out here.

494
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,820
Skank, a little help here?

495
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,330
Been working here long?

496
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,450
Man, I smell a cop!

497
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,050
- Do you smell a cop?
- I smell French fries, Skank.

498
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,020
But that don't make
no sense, huh?

499
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,120
Bud, you got a warrant?

500
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,620
I don't need a warrant
when I have this badge.

501
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:27,190
But we know our <i>constipational</i> rights, sir.
You can't just come in here and...

502
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,480
Oh, wow!

503
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,570
I got this problem, fellas.

504
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,370
Oggie Fisher, your buddy
who got greased?

505
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,510
I want to know who was
driving the car

506
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,410
that ran him into Kingdome Come.

507
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,310
Nobody's seen
that guy before, it's...

508
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,120
You hit me in the head
again, Skank.

509
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,420
I'm telling ya... Ok.

510
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,020
I can't remember dog squeeze

511
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,120
when it comes to getting

512
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,740
run off of roads there, Loomis.

513
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,820
I can see why, Skank.

514
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,830
I can call you Skank, can't I?

515
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,340
Yeah, unless you
like Maurice better.

516
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,910
Well, you listen good, Skank.

517
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,140
I know it's gonna be hard with
your melon on chemical overload.

518
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,440
But there's a killer out there,

519
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,950
and I'm gonna track
the hair ball down,

520
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,380
so when you 2 craterheads

521
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,180
get finished mining
for nose gold,

522
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,260
and you get a relapse of memory,

523
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,380
you let me know, huh?

524
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,460
I'm just a phone call away.

525
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,300
We ain't got no
telephone, Skank.

526
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
A little Hydropump?

527
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,070
No!

528
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,110
Here you go.

529
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,310
Thank you, Lisa.

530
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,080
No charge for the sarge.

531
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,620

down to Crawford's Gulley,

548
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,420

00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,100
I got scabs on my knuckles

556
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,130

557
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,670
It's your damn job, Gutterboy.

an ass full of trouble.

Yeah, its about time we got
into somebody's ass, huh, guys?

561
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,350
Yeah, we'll beat him like
a red-head stepchild.

562
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,240
I'm gonna knock his ass
lower than whale shit.

563

564
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,450
I don't know.

565
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,720
But I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch.

566
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,750
Hey, Keri, I'll pick
you up later tonight,

567
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,990
so do yourself a favor
and be here!

568
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,700

I... I tried to warn you, Skank.

702
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,430

to drive so fast?"

703

"And use a gun?"

704
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,930

It's what I do best.

708
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,380
That's right, Skanko.

709
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,480
That's what you do best.

710
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,520
Packard told us to keep
an eye on his girl.

711
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,820
Jesus, this shit's
got some kick.

712
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,120
Well, we almost killed his girl!

713
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,420
We're dead meat now, Skank!

714
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,530
You listen to me.

715
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:30,960
Now, she's never
gonna fink, man.

716
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,130
The bitch was with that dork,

717
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,030
and she's as scared of
Packard as anybody.

718
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,970
You hear me?

719
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:37,770
Now, we done what we was told.

720
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,310
Too bad about the 'Cuda, Skank.

721
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:44,910
It was a tits car.

722
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:48,010

Had a little problem
with the 'Cuda, Packard.

781
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,300
Kid on a bike just came by here.
You see him?

782

Not a motorbike with Keri

00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:44,480
What the hell's going on here, Pack?
You ok?

787
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,930
Kill him.

788
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:48,080
What?

789
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,020

794
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,550
He did something to the damn gun!
He ain't no human, Pack!

795
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:19,050
Bullshit! He's a kid!

796
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,630
Just a kid.

797
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:28,260

on the back of a motorcycle,

834
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:40,520

01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,480
since it seems to be your gang

889
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,680
he's got it in for.

890
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,950
So, if you guys
try to take the law

891
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,190
into your own hands,

892
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:09,130
and that killer turns up dead,

893
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:13,500
I'm gonna see you
all sniffing cyanide.

894
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,570
In the Arizona gas chamber.

895
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:24,510
Do you read?

896
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,540
Here we are.

897
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,680
- I'll stop by and pick you up later.
- Ok.

898
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,340
You know...

899
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:49,400
Today was the nicest day
I've had in a long time.

900
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:00,480
I thought so, too.

901
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,820
I'll see you.

902
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,340

Yeah, what for?

926
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,620
This gang thing was ok

927
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:18,290
but now that there's
that wraith out there

928
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,360
that killed Oggie...

929
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,720
A what out there, man?

930
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,630
A wraith, man! A ghost!

931
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:26,300
An evil spirit,
and it ain't cool!

932
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,670
I don't know,
except I'm quitting.

933
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:32,870
And if I was you guys,
I'd quit, too.

934
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:34,340
Well, I ain't got no beef.

935
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:37,310
Yeah, he's just a damn kid, man!

936
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:38,610
Packard said so.

937
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:40,310
<i>I'm leaving!</i>

938
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,280
Too bad!

939
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,920
Slosh this pig with 15, bud.

940
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,320
Let's go cruise.

941
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,860
Scare up some poozle some place.

942
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,180
You got it, Skanko,

943
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:57,360
'cause I'm a 4-day virgin.

944
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:16,740
Rughead must have
forgot something.

945
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,080
Kind of a mess now,
don't you think?

946
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,850
The Gutterboy and Skank.

947
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,990
They were... They were
right there.

948
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:08,490
And it's like they vaporized!

949
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:12,190
They were <i>adiosed</i>
by the kid in the Turbo.

950
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,160
I warned 'em!

951
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,900
I warned 'em!

952
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,370
What are you trying to say, boy?

953
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,370
That Skank and Gutterboy

954
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:25,070
were in there
when the place blew.

955
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:32,250
I know it seems impossible.

956
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:35,500
I didn't know they had
a kid in the car.

957
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:38,520
I didn't know
it was Jamie Hankins

958
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,390
till he came up missing.

959
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:41,360
So, what you're telling me

960
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,090
is that Packard and the others

961
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,230
killed Jamie Hankins?

962
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:48,130
Jamie Hankins was
here the other night

963
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:49,530
with a shotgun!

964
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,400
A dead kid with a shotgun?

965
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,340
I seen his eyes, Loomis.

966
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,070
I seen his eyes.

967
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,240
And I got a real bad feeling.

968
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:02,330
Bad feelings don't add up
to resurrections, buddy.

969
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:06,150
If it was Jamie Hankins,

970
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,180
why'd they kill him off
in the first place?

971
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:12,190
I don't know. I've been
too scared to say nothin'.

972
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:14,190
Packard hated Jamie.

973
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:17,230
Packard hates everybody.
He hates me.

974
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:18,590
I don't wanna get killed

975
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:23,000
over something I had
nothing to do with.

976
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,430
Not now.

977
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,110
You go on home now and...

978
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:34,280
You stay there till you
hear from me, eh?

979
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:00,000
<i>Hey, Billy.</i>

980
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,100
<i>Ok, I want 2 dogs.</i>

981
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,440
<i>I want 3 onion rings.</i>

982
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,610
<i>Yeah, 3 orders of onion rings,</i>

983
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,180
<i>and 2 hamburgers, no cheese.</i>

984
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,610
<i>And 2 malteds, vanilla
and chocolate, ok?</i>

985
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:11,210
How you doing, kid?

986
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,320
I'm Officer Loomis.

987
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,480
Can I have a word with you?

988
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,390
What do you need? I'm swamped.

989
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,250
I need some information.

990
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,260
About your brother.

991
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:20,920
That's easy. He's dead.

992
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,160
Order up!

993
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,430
Yeah, I know.

994
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:26,280
But his body never turned up,

995
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:29,470
and now I've got
4 dead kids in one week.

996
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:30,400
4?

997
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,100
I thought it was 2.

998
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,140
Skank and Gutterboy

999
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:36,010
got lunched
out at the warehouse.

1000
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:42,080
I figure Packard Walsh is next.

1001
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,090
I'll shake the hand
of the guys who does it.

1002
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,120
Order up!

1003
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,580
It might be...

1004
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,480
Impossible.

1005
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,150
Did your...

1006
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:51,690
Brother have a girl?

1007
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:53,120
Well, the night he was killed,

1008
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,390
he was with Keri Johnson.

1009
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:58,430
Somebody busted in
and smashed her head.

1010
01:13:58,430 --> 01:13:59,430
She woke up the next day

1011
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:01,030
on a deserted highway somewhere

1012
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:02,330
wrapped in a navajo blanket.

1013
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:04,470
Does she have any idea
who did it?

1014
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:06,240
Drifters maybe?

1015
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,540
Maybe smugglers?

1016
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:11,940
Maybe Packard Walsh?

1017
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,180
Who knows?

1018
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:17,210
She never knew who did it,
or she would have said so.

1019
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,880
Keri Johnson, huh?

1020
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:24,910
<i>I need some more relish
over here.</i>

1021
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:25,930
Thanks.

1022
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:27,220
Order up.

1023
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,960
Hey, officer?

1024
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,430
What's my brother have
to do with 4 dead guys?

1025
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,030
I mean, what's the connection?

1026
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:37,310
That's what I'm gonna find out.

to confront Packard.

<i>Yeah, could I have a...</i>

1056
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:22,630
I can't talk now, Packard,
I'm busy.

1057
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:26,210
For the past couple of days.
You've been real busy.

1058
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,810
Would you get out
of here? I have to work.

1059
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:28,580
Nope.

1060
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:31,310

Packard, stop it!

<i>What are you doing? Stop it!</i>

1062
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,210
Get in the car.

1063
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,530
<i>Packard, what the hell
are you doing, man?</i>

1064
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,170
Get out of my face, burger boy or
you'll wind up dead like your brother.

Billy.

01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,500
You bastard chickenshits!

1067
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:28,300
You let him take her!

1068
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:32,910
<i>So where are we going?</i>

1069
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:36,400
Somewhere no one
will ever find us.

1070
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:38,460
Where's that, Packard?

1071
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:39,680
West.

1072
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,250
California.

1073
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,810
To Santa Barbara
or some place like that.

1074
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,720
I'm not going.

1075
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,260
Yes, you are, Keri.

1076
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:55,350
Remember that night when you guys
found me with Jamie Hankins?

1077
01:17:56,290 --> 01:17:58,430
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1078
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,570
Well, think.

1079
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:03,470
When you broke in and
we had just finished doing it.

1080
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,650
So it was you.

1081
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,650
Yeah.

1082
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:17,850
I was always with Jamie.

1083
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,420
I never made
any promises to you.

1084
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:23,260
You're mine, that's it.

1085
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:26,900
You think I'd go
to California with you?

1086
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:27,930
I'd rather go to Nogales,

1087
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:30,600
have the Gutterboy's
cretin children,

1088
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,570
and die than to be with you.

1089
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:35,490
You better shut up now,
Keri, or I gonna have...

1090
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,960
Yeah, you can
kill me, too, Packard,

1091
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:41,640
but you can never
make me love you.

1092
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,940
Packard, you're pathetic.

1093
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:07,850
You wanna race?
'Cause I'll show you a race!

1094
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,150
We'll finish this later.

1095
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:04,640
<i>We got 'em, Loomis.
We're in pursuit, over.</i>

1096
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,690
All units, we're on Diamondback.

1097
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:10,530
<i>Request all addition units
in the vicinity.</i>

1098
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:16,260
<i>We have a suspect heading
westbound on Ridge Road.</i>

1099
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,370
<i>Dispatch, we're
in high-speed pursuit</i>

1100
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,440
<i>of silver Corvette,</i>

1101
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,040
<i>red trim and that black Turbo.</i>

1102
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:25,810
<i>Roger, unit 64,</i>

1103
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:28,040
<i>give us your location
again. Go ahead.</i>

1104
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,810
<i>Come in, Loomis.</i>

1105
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:32,710
<i>North on Diamondback Highway, over.</i>

1106
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:36,550
<i>Roger that, 16.
North on Diamondback.</i>

1107
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:51,730
Oh, shit!

1108
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,900
My God.

1109
01:23:58,550 --> 01:24:00,890
Just like all the others.

1110
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:05,200
Loomis, there's only
one body here.

1111
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,740
Cover him up.

1112
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,540
You want us to set up
a new road block?

1113
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:12,540
We could still catch the bugger.

1114
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:13,710
Got guys waiting...

1115
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:15,040
Forget it, Murphy.

1116
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:19,010
Roadblocks won't stop
something that can't be stopped.

1117
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,280
Loomis, what are you saying?

1118
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,920
I'm saying it's over.

1119
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:26,860
There's nobody left
in Packard's gang to kill.

1120
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:33,270
Let's clean this mess up
and get the hell out of here.

1121
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:10,750
I can't do that again.

1122
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,060
Jake.

1123
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:16,780
You know who I am.

1124
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,370
Jamie.

1125
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:27,200
It's as close as I could
come to who I once was.

1126
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,920
It's close enough.

1127
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,160
Just think of this
as a second chance.

1128
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,660
We were meant to be
together, Keri.

1129
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:38,360
Look, I got one
more thing to do.

1130
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,360
Don't leave me again.

1131
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,260
Don't worry. I'll be back.

1132
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:45,070
It's a short trip.

1133
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:47,200
Pack light.

1134
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:11,790
Come on, Packard!

1135
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:12,430
Relax.

1136
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:14,730
You scared me, man!

1137
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:16,700
I'm sorry, man.

1138
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,270
It's been a heavy day already.

1139
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:21,770
I can see that.

1140
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,870
It's time for me
to hit the road.

1141
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,280
My business here is finished.

1142
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,340
Before I do,

1143
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:30,980
I want you to have something.

1144
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,450
She's yours now.

1145
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:35,450
Who's mine?

1146
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:37,750
It's outside.

1147
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:39,990
Turbo Interceptor.

1148
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:43,120
The only one in existence.

1149
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:46,760
Does very special things.

1150
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,030
Take care of it, will you?

1151
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:52,800
Who are you, bro?

1152
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:56,260
You said it, Billy.

1153
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:58,870
I gotta go.

1154
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,180
Hey, man, wait a minute!

1155
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:03,210
Where you going?
Where you going?!

1156
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,270
Hey Billy!

1157
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:08,070
The instructions are in
the glove compartment!

1158
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:12,010
Wait a minute!

1159
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:13,860
Come back!

1160
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:16,410
Come back, bro!

1161
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:27,840
Hey, man, far out.

1162
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,700
Hey, Jake! Who are you?

1163
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:40,180
It couldn't have been.

1164
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:43,020
Jake!

1165
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:45,750
Jake!

1166
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:49,220
Jamie!
