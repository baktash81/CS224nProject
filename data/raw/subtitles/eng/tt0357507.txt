1
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:52,468
<i>Don't go to sleep.</i>
<i>He's waiting for you.</i>

2
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,811
<i>Don't go to sleep.</i>

3
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:08,424
Hey! What's going on?

4
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:11,206
Oh, man.

5
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:14,370
-Well?
-He's here.

6
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:16,576
Who's here?

7
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,070
He came out of the closet.

8
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:22,043
Tim, nobody's here.
What are you talking about?

9
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:26,934
Him.

10
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:31,058
Okay.

11
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:37,100
Tim.

12
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,881
It's just a story. Okay? He's not real.

13
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,882
Well, let's have a look around, then,
shall we?

14
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,061
No.

15
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:00,213
Nothing back here.

16
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:06,734
Okay.

17
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:11,241
Hello.

18
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:16,612
Nope.

19
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:20,161
Nobody home.

20
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:22,846
Just us.

21
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:45,479
No!

22
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:18,950
This is gonna get ugly.

23
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:21,731
No more vodka.

24
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,183
Hey, Tim. Let me have
one of those green things.

25
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:30,075
Careful. No more for Pam.

26
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,856
Hey. It's my party.

27
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:34,678
You still on for this weekend?

28
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:37,267
No, thought I'd wrangle up
a dinner invitation...

29
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:40,816
...from one of those art-department
girls. Like this one right here.

30
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,734
-Here you go.
-Oh, hey, thank you.

31
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,077
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

32
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:48,105
Hey, Scotty, did Tim tell you about
meeting my parents tomorrow?

33
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:50,023
Meeting the folks? Sounds serious.

34
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:53,092
Yeah, if he can survive the weekend
with Jessica's father.

35
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:56,256
Oh, come on. Dad's not that bad.
Don't listen to that.

36
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:59,229
-He tried to drown you.
-You shouldn't have told her.

37
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:01,435
I was 7.
He was teaching me to swim.

38
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,066
By throwing you in a lake?

39
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:05,847
You know, this might be
a good time for a toast.

40
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:07,861
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I'd say.

41
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:09,683
Excuse me, everyone.

42
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,176
When we come back
from Thanksgiving on Monday...

43
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,999
...things will be a lot different.

44
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,533
For starters...

45
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:17,835
...it'll be a lot quieter.

46
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:20,136
But it definitely won't be as much fun.

47
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:22,630
<i>The Daily News</i> is lucky to get you.

48
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:24,644
Cheers.

49
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,357
Okay, break it up.

50
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,563
-Be good, Jess.
-I will.

51
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,385
I'm gonna miss you.

52
00:06:35,577 --> 00:06:37,399
All of you.

53
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:40,084
I'm gonna miss you too.

54
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:44,496
So I told my parents I'd be there by 11.

55
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:46,606
All right, I'll get your coat.

56
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:48,620
Thank you.

57
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:17,199
Hey.

58
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:18,926
-Hey, Jess.
-Hey.

59
00:07:22,378 --> 00:07:24,392
Not getting weird on me again,
are you?

60
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:28,420
No, no. I just spaced out for a second.

61
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:33,407
Okay.

62
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,421
<i>Where's your car?</i>

63
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:36,764
It wouldn't start.

64
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,257
-Is it gonna make it?
-I got a guy looking at it.

65
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:42,134
If you think you can use
the "car broke down" excuse...

66
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,587
-...to get out of this, you're mistaken.
-I'll be there, I promise.

67
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,217
Okay.

68
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,327
So you want a ride home?

69
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,300
No, I'm good. I'll cut through the park.

70
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:55,657
-Besides, I've seen your driving.
-Yeah, okay.

71
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:01,219
-Be careful.
-I'll be fine.

72
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:07,837
See you tomorrow.

73
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:54,830
I don't--
Who would have done this?

74
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:56,460
Who would've taken...?

75
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:58,762
Who would--?
Who would take him?

76
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:02,310
Why would they do this?
Where is he?

77
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,921
<i>Tim, it's Uncle Mike</i>.

78
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:06,854
<i>I know you're having Thanksgiving</i>
<i>with your girlfriend and all...</i>

79
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:11,073
<i>...but it'd be nice if you could make it</i>
<i>out to see your mom this weekend</i>.

80
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:15,389
<i>She's not doing so well, and, you</i>
<i>know, it'd be good for her to see you</i>.

81
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:21,047
<i>And, hey, I got some stuff</i>
<i>for you to sign too, house stuff</i>.

82
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:24,212
<i>All right, hope I see you this weekend</i>.

83
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:52,408
-Hey, you made it.
-Hey.

84
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,134
Hey.

85
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,970
-Were the directions okay?
-Perfect. Here.

86
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,313
-Come on.
-Wait, wait.

87
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,807
Shouldn't we wait for the bellhop
or something?

88
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:05,355
Shut up. It's their house, not mine.

89
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:06,889
What's with the tie?

90
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,575
I figured, meeting the family.
Why not, right?

91
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:13,219
Come on. Let's put your stuff
in the guestroom.

92
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:16,384
<i>So Jessica tells us you two met</i>
<i>at the magazine.</i>

93
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:20,316
-Are you in the art department?
-I'm an associate editor.

94
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:23,577
-Sounds impressive.
-It's just a glorified fact-checker.

95
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,166
-Tim's very good at his job.
-How about family?

96
00:11:26,262 --> 00:11:28,755
Got any family nearby?
Any brothers, sisters?

97
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:30,961
No, sir. No brothers or sisters,
just me.

98
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:33,359
-How about your folks?
-Let the boy eat.

99
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:35,469
-We're just talking, Mother.
-Dad.

100
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,825
The family thing's kind of
complicated, sir.

101
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:41,415
This stuffing is delicious, Chelsea.

102
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:44,484
Tim's had kind of a strained
relationship with his parents.

103
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:47,073
-Tim's father ran out when he was 8.
-Jess.

104
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:49,567
Oh, that's sad.

105
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:53,595
Then he had to go live with his uncle,
in a tiny room in the back of his bar.

106
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:56,568
Well, what about your mother?

107
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:02,514
She sort of had a tough time
after my dad left.

108
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:06,350
It was pretty hard on both of us.

109
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:12,392
Is there anything else
you wanted to know, Dad?

110
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:15,557
Be down in a minute, Mom.

111
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:17,571
You have fun down there?

112
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:20,160
Oh, come on. They could use
a little shaking up.

113
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:22,174
You see my sister's face
when I said...

114
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,859
...you lived in a tiny room
in the back of a bar?

115
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:27,065
It wasn't in the back of a bar,
you know.

116
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:30,710
I know. I just like messing with them.

117
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:34,354
Is that why you wanted me here,
to freak out your family?

118
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,560
No.

119
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:38,574
No.

120
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:41,067
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

121
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,506
Tell you what...

122
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:44,520
...I gotta go down, say good night...

123
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:47,109
...but I'll sneak in later
and make it up to you.

124
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:51,425
Okay?

125
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,645
In that case...

126
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:58,234
...l'll put on something naughty.

127
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:01,399
You do that.

128
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:10,677
I like this sneaking-around thing.

129
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:12,500
It's kind of dirty.

130
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:16,336
You all right?

131
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:21,419
Timmy.

132
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,528
You can't keep running away.

133
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:28,036
-Look at me.
-Mom?

134
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,817
Why, what's the matter with you?
Look at me!

135
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:32,543
Look at me.

136
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:34,270
Look at me.

137
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,010
You're a bad little boy.

138
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:43,381
Tim? Baby, what are you doing
on the floor?

139
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:46,545
Tim, what is it?

140
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,559
Jessica.

141
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:51,532
Oh, God, I had
the most messed-up dream.

142
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:53,163
What was it?

143
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:55,848
-I gotta go see my mom.
-Wait.

144
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:57,574
-There's something wrong.
-What?

145
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,972
-I know it.
-Tim. Tim, no. Hey.

146
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:03,041
-Listen, let's get back in bed, and....
-I just gotta--

147
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:05,534
-Where's my phone?
-Tim, what is wrong with you?.

148
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:07,548
-God.
-Where's my phone?

149
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:09,371
Just leave it.

150
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:12,440
Hello.

151
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:15,125
-Hey, Uncle Mike, I got your message.
-Hey.

152
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:17,618
Is everything okay?
I'm gonna see Mom tomorrow.

153
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,728
I thought you were here
for the weekend.

154
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:24,332
-What?
-Tim.

155
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,592
Okay.

156
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:32,196
Okay.

157
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,840
-Tim.
-I have to go.

158
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:40,156
-You--? Tim, what is it?
-Look, I just have to go.

159
00:17:04,228 --> 00:17:06,625
So the funeral's today.

160
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,352
Yeah, this afternoon.

161
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:10,941
I'm so sorry, Tim.

162
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:12,667
Me too.

163
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:22,162
That's fantastic. That's really strong.

164
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:24,272
What's that you've got, Peter?

165
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:28,779
Oh, that rainbow is beautiful.
How many colors in there?

166
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,369
I'm thinking of going by
the old house.

167
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:35,205
-Really?
-My uncle's been fixing the place up...

168
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:38,082
...to sell since Mom went
to the hospital last year.

169
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:41,151
I felt like I should be the one
to go through her things.

170
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,152
I should've done more,
but it's something, right?

171
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:50,933
Listen to me, Tim.
Something happened in that house...

172
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,659
...but it wasn't supernatural.

173
00:17:52,851 --> 00:17:55,345
There's nothing in there
but memories.

174
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:59,756
You dealt with your father's leaving
the best way that you could.

175
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,482
But you were 8.

176
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:05,319
Tim, you've been coming here
for what, 15 years?

177
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,333
Look around you.

178
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:08,963
There's only children here.

179
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:13,662
<i>Dr. Matheson to Observation.</i>

180
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:16,348
I'm sorry. I have to go.

181
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,622
Go home, Tim.

182
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,636
Spend one night in that house.

183
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:25,458
It will help.

184
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,694
It's okay. It's okay.

185
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,955
Hey, we need some help in here!

186
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:52,503
Hey, the nurse is on the way.
It's okay, it's all right.

187
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:54,613
What? What is it?

188
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:23,480
Just relax now.
It's gonna be all right.

189
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:25,494
It's all right.

190
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,988
Everything's gonna be all right.

191
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:20,255
And in Paul's letter
to the Corinthians, he says:

192
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:22,653
"We shall not all fall asleep...

193
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:24,955
...but we will all be changed...

194
00:20:25,147 --> 00:20:28,503
...in an instant, in the blink of an eye."

195
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,668
"When my tongue rejoices,
my body will rest in peace...

196
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,257
...because you will not abandon me
to the grave.

197
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:37,902
For you, O Lord, have delivered
my soul to death...

198
00:20:38,094 --> 00:20:42,409
...my eyes from tears,
my feet from stumbling."

199
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,807
"Thou knowest the secrets...."

200
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:00,247
"....spare us.

201
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:02,549
Suffer us not in our last hour."

202
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,755
"Dust thou art...

203
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:08,975
...and unto dust thou shalt return."

204
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,619
Thanks for doing all this.

205
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:14,825
She was my sister.

206
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,086
When are you heading back?

207
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,826
Actually, I might stay in town tonight.
In the house.

208
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,662
-I thought you didn't like that house.
-Yeah, well.

209
00:21:25,854 --> 00:21:29,306
Tim, the place is a mess. I've been
doing a whole lot of work there--

210
00:21:29,402 --> 00:21:31,800
I won't mess anything up.

211
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:34,869
Is that Katie?

212
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:36,403
Yeah.

213
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,513
How long has it been?

214
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,623
-A long time.
-You should go and say hi.

215
00:21:40,815 --> 00:21:42,829
No, I don't think so.

216
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:45,802
All right. Suit yourself.

217
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:48,871
Hey, come here.

218
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:55,776
Here you go. You might need these.

219
00:21:58,173 --> 00:22:00,379
Thanks for everything.

220
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,489
It's good seeing you again, Tim.

221
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:38,153
<i>Timmy.</i>

222
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:41,893
<i>You know, it's your cat,</i>
<i>and you're supposed to feed her.</i>

223
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:49,374
<i>Come on, Timmy, just turn</i>
<i>the light on. I'm not coming up there.</i>

224
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,772
He's scared of his damn closet.

225
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:53,977
You know why he's so scared,
don't you?

226
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:55,991
-Why?
-Because you freaked him out...

227
00:27:56,183 --> 00:27:57,909
...with that stupid story of yours.

228
00:27:58,101 --> 00:28:00,211
You've gotta be kidding.
It was a story.

229
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:03,280
-My dad did the same thing to me.
-Look how you turned out.

230
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:06,828
-It was nothing, okay?
-He's got a very vivid imagination.

231
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:08,842
Mary, this is ridiculous. I was just--

232
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:11,432
You're gonna put that boy
in therapy.

233
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:13,158
-Just calm down, okay?
-Timmy.

234
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:04,599
Cody. Cody.

235
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:09,586
Kate!

236
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:20,039
Kate!

237
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:22,724
-Cody.
-Are you all right?

238
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:24,546
Yeah.

239
00:30:24,738 --> 00:30:27,711
I think I just hit my head.

240
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:30,780
He's never done that before.

241
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:34,425
Do you wanna come in,
put some ice on that?

242
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:36,630
Sure.

243
00:30:45,741 --> 00:30:47,563
I saw you at the funeral.

244
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:49,769
I wasn't sure you'd remember me.

245
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:54,277
I'm real sorry about your mom.

246
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,921
Yeah, me too.

247
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:06,457
-How about that ice?
-Yeah.

248
00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:09,621
-Sorry.
-What are you trying to do?

249
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:11,731
-I'm sorry.
-I'm in pain.

250
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:16,239
So....

251
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,020
So....

252
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:20,842
So how's the city?

253
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:23,240
It's all right.

254
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:25,829
It's been a little crazy lately, but....

255
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,747
You got a girlfriend?

256
00:31:29,857 --> 00:31:31,967
Actually, yeah. Yeah, I do.

257
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,064
How about you?

258
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:43,380
-Do I have a girlfriend?
-No.

259
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:45,969
-No, I don't.
-You know what I mean.

260
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:47,983
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

261
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:51,436
Just me and my dad.

262
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:55,080
I'm sure some shrink could have
a field day with that.

263
00:31:57,094 --> 00:31:59,587
So how long are you staying around?

264
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:01,218
I think just tonight.

265
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,862
I wanted to go through my mom's
things, you know, pictures and stuff.

266
00:32:05,054 --> 00:32:07,835
-I found a goofy one of you and me.
-Goofy?

267
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,329
-I don't remember being goofy.
-I'll show you.

268
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:14,165
-It's actually kind of cute.
-No, I don't think. Cute, I believe.

269
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:17,713
Goofy, that's crazy talk.

270
00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:20,590
I mean, if you said you saw
a picture that--

271
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:25,578
You know, that was stunning
or, you know, gorgeous...

272
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:29,797
...okay, you know, I've heard that
a thousand times.

273
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,907
<i>He took Dad, and now he's gonna</i>
<i>take me.</i>

274
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:37,374
<i>Timmy, nobody took your dad.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

275
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:42,456
Did you find it?

276
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,087
What?

277
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,005
Goofy photo?

278
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:49,170
Here.

279
00:32:50,704 --> 00:32:53,869
Look at us. Even you're adorable.

280
00:32:53,965 --> 00:32:55,500
Thanks.

281
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:57,993
You know, I was crushed
when you left.

282
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:00,870
It broke my little heart.

283
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,131
And it broke my heart
you couldn't throw a baseball.

284
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:07,679
You were the one
that was scared of closets.

285
00:33:07,775 --> 00:33:09,981
-I told you that?
-Yeah.

286
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:11,803
I told you closets were nothing.

287
00:33:11,995 --> 00:33:15,543
It's the thing under the bed
you had to be worried about.

288
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:19,092
All right, I have to go home
and start Dad's dinner.

289
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:25,326
I bet you don't have any food
in the house, do you?

290
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:27,819
-I'll come back with some.
-You don't have to.

291
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:31,272
I know. It's frightening how
domestic I've become, though.

292
00:33:34,437 --> 00:33:35,779
Bye.

293
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,005
Hello.

294
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,267
Hello.

295
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:57,309
Hey.

296
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,899
You all right?

297
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:09,489
Wanna come out?

298
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,424
What were you doing in there?

299
00:38:38,932 --> 00:38:41,233
You were at my mother's funeral,
weren't you?

300
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:43,919
My dad knew her.

301
00:38:45,261 --> 00:38:47,084
What's your name?

302
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:49,193
Franny.

303
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:53,413
So, Franny, wanna tell me why you're
following me around?

304
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:57,441
I wanted to talk to you.

305
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:01,181
I wanted to ask you something.

306
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:03,291
All right.

307
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,949
Wanna ask me now?

308
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:16,814
Is it true?

309
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:18,924
Is what true?

310
00:39:19,595 --> 00:39:22,089
The Boogeyman took your dad.

311
00:39:29,185 --> 00:39:33,885
Look, I don't know where you
heard that, but it's just a story.

312
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:38,776
There's no such thing
as the Boogeyman.

313
00:39:44,146 --> 00:39:46,352
I was trying to make sense of things.

314
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,860
My dad left. I was upset.
That's all that happened. Okay?

315
00:39:55,176 --> 00:39:59,012
It's late. Your parents will worry.
Where do you live? I'll give you a ride.

316
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:00,834
Next to the park.

317
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:03,999
It's all right. I've got my own ride.

318
00:40:08,123 --> 00:40:10,232
Hey, Franny.

319
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,342
Count to five.

320
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:17,041
When you're afraid,
close your eyes and count to five.

321
00:40:18,576 --> 00:40:20,686
Sometimes it works for me.

322
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:23,947
What happens when you get to six?

323
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:06,048
-You gotta be brave. Come on, Tim.
-No, Dad.

324
00:41:07,104 --> 00:41:09,117
Dad. Let me out.

325
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:12,474
Tim, stop it. Okay? There is nothing
in there. Just trust me.

326
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,543
Trust me. There is nothing in there.

327
00:41:16,214 --> 00:41:19,955
-"Just count to five like I told you."
-Count to five like I told you, okay?

328
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:22,352
He's here. He's here.

329
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:30,983
One. Two. Three.

330
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:34,724
-Good boy.
-Four. Five.

331
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:44,410
He's here. He's here.

332
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:40,106
Tim. Where--?
Where are you going?

333
00:44:40,202 --> 00:44:42,408
-We have to go.
-What happened to your face?

334
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,901
-Please. We have to go.
-I called your uncle.

335
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:47,491
-I am so sorry about--
-I want to go now.

336
00:44:56,602 --> 00:45:01,013
Look, I'm sorry for losing it back there.
I just needed to get out of that house.

337
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:03,507
Hey, it's okay.

338
00:45:06,576 --> 00:45:08,686
It's-- It's really late.

339
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:14,440
Maybe we should stop somewhere
and get some rest, you know?

340
00:45:55,007 --> 00:45:56,637
How are you doing?

341
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:07,666
Tim, come on. I drove two and
a half hours to be with you.

342
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:17,257
I can't do this anymore, okay?

343
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:21,285
It's too much, and I'm too tired.

344
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,834
Look, can't we just forget
all about the bad stuff...

345
00:46:32,602 --> 00:46:34,616
...just for one night?

346
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:37,493
Just try to have some fun?

347
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:43,534
Pretend that nothing else is out there.

348
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:52,933
Listen, why don't you go grab
some ice.

349
00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:55,043
I'll get the bath ready.

350
00:46:56,002 --> 00:46:59,071
We can raid the minibar
and have our own little...

351
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:02,140
..."forget about the world" party.

352
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,305
Okay?

353
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,388
-All right.
-Good.

354
00:47:17,389 --> 00:47:18,923
Good.

355
00:47:33,021 --> 00:47:34,843
Hey, Tim.

356
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,711
Hello.

357
00:48:11,766 --> 00:48:13,684
Anybody home?

358
00:48:14,931 --> 00:48:16,466
Tim.

359
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:20,494
Hello.

360
00:48:44,086 --> 00:48:46,484
Brought you some food.

361
00:49:04,993 --> 00:49:06,911
I'm coming up.

362
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:10,843
Are you decent?

363
00:49:44,122 --> 00:49:46,424
Nice lighting.

364
00:49:50,451 --> 00:49:52,370
Tim. Hello.

365
00:49:52,561 --> 00:49:54,767
I'll make us a vodka Red Bull.

366
00:49:59,754 --> 00:50:01,768
Tim.

367
00:50:03,302 --> 00:50:05,700
I might have made these a little strong.

368
00:50:05,796 --> 00:50:09,728
Listen, Jess. I just wanna thank you
for putting up with me.

369
00:50:18,264 --> 00:50:19,990
Jessica?

370
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,333
Jessica?

371
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:44,637
Jessica?

372
00:50:45,117 --> 00:50:46,939
Jessica?

373
00:50:48,953 --> 00:50:51,159
Jessica?

374
00:51:13,217 --> 00:51:15,710
Come on, Tim. This isn't funny.

375
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,733
How long were you
waiting in there?

376
00:52:22,363 --> 00:52:24,569
You scared the crap out of me.

377
00:52:27,255 --> 00:52:29,748
Come on, I made you some food.
Come on.

378
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:34,064
How did l--? Where's Jessica?

379
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:38,187
-Who's Jessica?
-We went to the hotel.

380
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:42,503
-The motel. And then--
-What are you talking about?

381
00:52:44,805 --> 00:52:47,682
-I have to go.
-Tim. Tim.

382
00:52:48,354 --> 00:52:50,751
-What the hell is going on?
-Come with me.

383
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:52,573
I need you to see what I see.

384
00:52:53,532 --> 00:52:57,560
-What's wrong? Where are we going?
-I don't know. I don't know anything.

385
00:52:57,752 --> 00:53:01,205
I don't know where I've been
or what I've done. I just don't know.

386
00:53:08,206 --> 00:53:10,987
-Oh, God.
-What?

387
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:15,398
That's it. That's the motel.

388
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:38,415
What are we doing here?

389
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:42,060
Maybe you should go to the front desk
and ask if....

390
00:54:51,302 --> 00:54:52,837
Jessica?

391
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,578
I was here.

392
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:18,060
What happened, Tim?

393
00:55:25,828 --> 00:55:27,554
We were here.

394
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:38,391
I don't know. I went to get ice,
and I came back to--

395
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:53,640
-He took her.
-What? Who took her?

396
00:55:55,846 --> 00:55:57,956
You won't believe me.

397
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,820
Where did the blood
come from, Tim?

398
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:10,807
Who do you think took your friend?

399
00:56:17,136 --> 00:56:19,246
Tim, if something happened....

400
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:24,425
-lf you accidentally did something--
-I didn't hurt Jessica.

401
00:56:26,151 --> 00:56:27,878
Are you sure?

402
00:56:31,426 --> 00:56:34,303
Everybody told me I was
making it up.

403
00:56:35,646 --> 00:56:40,921
For 15 years. Ever since my dad left,
telling me over and over.

404
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:46,483
But I was right.

405
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,758
I don't wanna be, but I am.

406
00:56:54,251 --> 00:56:55,882
Tim.

407
00:56:59,142 --> 00:57:00,581
Tim.

408
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:20,529
Good night, Tim.

409
00:57:44,505 --> 00:57:46,711
Kate! Kate, please open the door!

410
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:52,273
-Kate! Kate. Come out.
-Go home. Get off the porch.

411
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:54,191
-Listen to me.
-You need to get out.

412
00:57:54,479 --> 00:57:56,397
Don't grab me.

413
00:57:58,315 --> 00:58:00,617
-He's in your house.
-My dad is in my house.

414
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:03,302
He's upstairs, probably
waiting up for me.

415
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:05,891
Tim...

416
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:09,248
...I think maybe you're sick.

417
00:58:10,015 --> 00:58:13,564
And I wish I could help you,
but I can't.

418
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,633
Now, if you don't go home,
I'm calling the police.

419
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:19,510
It wasn't your dad. I saw him.

420
00:58:19,989 --> 00:58:22,099
I'm going inside now.

421
00:58:22,962 --> 00:58:24,593
Go home.

422
00:58:25,744 --> 00:58:27,662
You need help, Tim.

423
00:59:17,052 --> 00:59:18,779
Couldn't sleep either?

424
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:23,670
I was looking for you.
You said you lived by the park.

425
00:59:25,012 --> 00:59:29,424
Sometimes when I think he's
in my house, I come out here.

426
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,109
Sometimes all night,
until the sun comes up.

427
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:34,986
And everything's okay again.

428
00:59:36,521 --> 00:59:38,822
What if your parents come
to check in on you?

429
00:59:38,918 --> 00:59:40,836
I won't be there.

430
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,386
I told you a lie.

431
00:59:51,961 --> 00:59:55,222
The story about the night
my father disappeared.

432
00:59:55,414 --> 00:59:56,853
I know.

433
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:10,183
He took my dad.

434
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:15,458
Tonight he took a friend of mine.

435
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:20,733
He's gonna keep taking people.

436
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:22,747
Everyone who means
something to me.

437
01:00:25,336 --> 01:00:27,158
I need your help.

438
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:31,666
Why?

439
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,310
Because we're the only ones
who believe.

440
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:40,776
I have to go home.

441
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,629
-Hello?
-It's Kate Houghton.

442
01:01:00,821 --> 01:01:05,904
Listen, I was just with Tim...

443
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:10,507
...and I'm worried about him.
He's acting kind of....

444
01:01:11,274 --> 01:01:16,549
Could you go over there
and just check in on him?

445
01:01:17,412 --> 01:01:20,289
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

446
01:01:23,741 --> 01:01:27,194
Dad? Is that you?

447
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:34,195
Franny. Franny.

448
01:01:35,634 --> 01:01:39,949
I opened your pack.
I saw your pictures and the articles.

449
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:43,210
-I just need to ask you something.
-Okay.

450
01:01:43,402 --> 01:01:45,224
How do you stop him?

451
01:01:48,772 --> 01:01:50,499
I'm not sure.

452
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:56,541
I know that house.

453
01:01:56,924 --> 01:01:58,938
I've been here before. Come on.

454
01:03:04,632 --> 01:03:07,318
I used to come talk to the man
who lived here.

455
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:13,360
Everyone said he was crazy.

456
01:03:16,045 --> 01:03:18,251
He said his daughter was taken.

457
01:03:20,169 --> 01:03:21,895
What are all these words?

458
01:03:23,718 --> 01:03:25,252
I'm not sure.

459
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:29,663
He sealed up everything.

460
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,308
All the closets and doors.

461
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,488
He was trying to understand it.

462
01:03:48,173 --> 01:03:50,283
Trying to give it a name.

463
01:04:19,917 --> 01:04:21,739
He sat here.

464
01:04:22,602 --> 01:04:23,945
Waiting.

465
01:04:30,275 --> 01:04:31,809
I don't want to be here.

466
01:04:48,209 --> 01:04:51,182
He didn't seal this one.
This was the door.

467
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,402
He was trying to bring him out.

468
01:04:56,265 --> 01:04:57,512
Franny.

469
01:04:57,703 --> 01:05:00,197
We have to go back to the house.

470
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:15,829
My dad was trying to find me.

471
01:05:17,268 --> 01:05:19,090
Trying to beat it.

472
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:24,460
You have to go home.

473
01:05:24,652 --> 01:05:27,242
You have to go to the place
where it first started.

474
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:29,352
That's where you face him.

475
01:05:29,831 --> 01:05:31,270
My dad got too scared.

476
01:05:33,092 --> 01:05:34,722
He couldn't face him.

477
01:05:44,984 --> 01:05:46,806
I wanna help you.

478
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:52,944
You can't.
You can only help yourself.

479
01:06:15,481 --> 01:06:17,112
Tim.

480
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:22,962
Hey, Tim.

481
01:06:24,017 --> 01:06:26,031
You okay, buddy?

482
01:06:26,702 --> 01:06:28,141
Kate called.

483
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:30,922
Said things are getting
a little loose around here.

484
01:07:01,228 --> 01:07:02,762
Uncle Mike?

485
01:07:03,529 --> 01:07:04,968
Uncle Mike?

486
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,996
Uncle Mike!

487
01:07:12,257 --> 01:07:14,079
Hey, Mike!

488
01:07:18,682 --> 01:07:20,312
He took him.

489
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:18,406
He's waiting for you.

490
01:11:07,222 --> 01:11:11,058
<i>Tim, what are you doing?</i>
<i>Get in here.</i>

491
01:11:11,249 --> 01:11:12,976
Jessica?

492
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:13,012
Jessica.

493
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,989
Jessica?

494
01:12:51,948 --> 01:12:53,483
Tim?

495
01:12:53,962 --> 01:12:58,470
Mike. Uncle Mike, it's me.
What are you doing?

496
01:13:23,405 --> 01:13:25,899
Mike, Mike, I'm here.

497
01:13:28,008 --> 01:13:31,653
Can you hear me?
All right, all right, he's gone.

498
01:13:31,845 --> 01:13:34,146
I'm gonna save you. Come on!

499
01:13:36,832 --> 01:13:38,078
All right, hold on.

500
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,970
I'm gonna cut you out, okay?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

501
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:01,767
--check in on him?

502
01:14:02,342 --> 01:14:03,685
Thanks.

503
01:14:04,068 --> 01:14:05,891
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

504
01:14:08,864 --> 01:14:11,261
Dad? Is that you?

505
01:14:27,277 --> 01:14:29,483
What was that? What was that?

506
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:36,676
I have to stop this.
I have to go after him.

507
01:14:36,868 --> 01:14:40,799
He's leading me somewhere. If I'm not
around, he won't bother you, okay?

508
01:14:43,485 --> 01:14:45,307
Tim.

509
01:14:57,774 --> 01:14:59,693
I don't understand.

510
01:15:00,268 --> 01:15:01,898
Tim!

511
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:09,187
Help! Come on, come on!

512
01:15:09,858 --> 01:15:11,968
Help! Get him off! No!

513
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:32,492
I gotta get you out of here.

514
01:15:32,587 --> 01:15:35,561
-Kate, come on! Come on, go, go!
-What? What?

515
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:39,780
What happened? Come on!

516
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:41,891
We gotta get out of here!

517
01:15:44,864 --> 01:15:47,741
Come on! Come on, help me!
Come on, Tim!

518
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:02,606
Oh, God.

519
01:16:07,977 --> 01:16:09,895
<i>Go to the place where</i>
<i>it first started.</i>

520
01:16:10,086 --> 01:16:11,333
One.

521
01:16:12,196 --> 01:16:13,347
Two.

522
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:16,320
-Three.
-Dad.

523
01:16:17,087 --> 01:16:18,334
Four.

524
01:16:19,772 --> 01:16:22,074
-Five.
-<i>My dad got too scared.</i>

525
01:16:22,266 --> 01:16:23,801
<i>You have to face him.</i>

526
01:16:25,431 --> 01:16:26,773
Six.

527
01:16:32,624 --> 01:16:35,500
Tim, is he gone?

528
01:16:39,816 --> 01:16:41,447
Tim?

529
01:16:51,037 --> 01:16:52,859
What are you doing?

530
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:31,509
Come on!

531
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,100
Tim!

532
01:18:21,091 --> 01:18:22,913
He's gone.

533
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:11,728
Is it over?

534
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:15,564
Yeah.

535
01:19:17,099 --> 01:19:18,921
Yeah, it's over.

536
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:23,908
He's not coming back.

537
01:24:58,421 --> 01:25:00,339
Mom?

538
01:25:00,435 --> 01:25:02,162
Mom?

539
01:25:03,312 --> 01:25:05,519
Could you close the closet door?
