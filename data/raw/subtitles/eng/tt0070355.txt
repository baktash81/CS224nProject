1
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,014
This is a .44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world.

2
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,017
And it could blow your head clean off.

3
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,477
Do you feel lucky?

4
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,610
Mr. Ricca!
How do you feel about your acquittal?

5
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,407
lt proves what l always said,
l had nothing to do with Scarza's murder.

6
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,993
Who could have killed
Anthony Scarza and his family?

7
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,662
That's a stupid question. Get off my back!

8
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,208
Mr. Weinstein, explain the technicality
involving the lack of admissible evidence.

9
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,337
That's a legality
that can't be explained at this time.

10
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,256
Mr. Weinstein, you don't seem surprised
about the decision.

11
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,925
l don't know why they waste
the taxpayers' money.

12
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,013
This whole thing is an arbitrary attack
on a legitimate businessman.

13
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,307
-Do you have any comments?
-What, dear?

14
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,142
Do you have any other comments?

15
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,644
l'll give you a comment:
Their minds are dead.

16
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,189
-What do you mean by that?
-Their minds are dead.

17
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,816
Mr. Ricca means he is very pleased
with the decision.

18
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,027
There's a big crowd.
Do you fear for your life?

19
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,820
No, of course not.

20
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,574
Mr. Estabrook.

21
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,577
As the prosecutor,
how do you feel about the court's decision?

22
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,913
lt's happened before,
it'll probably happen again.

23
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,331
l have no more comments.

24
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,337
l'm sorry, no comments. No comments!

25
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,922
l have no comments.

26
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,356
You know what l think?
l'll tell you what l think!

27
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,358
Fuck the courts, that's what l think!

28
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,362
They've already wasted too much time
worrying about the rights of killers!

29
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,738
Ricca, you're a killer!

30
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,751
Get in the car! Go on!

31
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,612
Murderer!

32
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,218
Today the noted labor leader
Carmine Ricca...

33
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,764
...was acquitted on a technicality:
the lack of admissible evidence.

34
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,725
Ricca had been charged with complicity...

35
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,520
...in the murders of labor reformer
Anthony Scarza and his family.

36
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,441
When he appeared outside
the courthouse this afternoon, a free man...

37
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,319
...it touched off a wild,
mob-like demonstration.

38
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,655
But the police were finally able
to bring it under control...

39
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,241
...and there have been
no reports of injuries.

40
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,204
But one can expect an uproar
from an angry and alarmed crowd...

41
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,998
...which fully expected Ricca
to be convicted.

42
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,669
And l'm sure we haven't heard
the last of the Ricca case.

43
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,755
Art Brown reporting from city hall.

44
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,821
Cop.

45
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,991
Gino, for Christ's sake.

46
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,995
Come on, Carmine.
l'm driving this thing like a baby carriage.

47
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,343
Could l see your driver's license, please?

48
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,303
Do you know who that is
sitting back there?

49
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,306
l'll still have to see
your driver's license, please.

50
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,266
l'll have to find it.

51
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,560
Do you know why you're being stopped?

52
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,482
Yes, we know, Officer,
and you're making a big mistake.

53
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,652
-You crossed a double line back there.
-A double line?

54
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,153
Take it easy.

55
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,698
Whatever you say, Officer.

56
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,285
l just happened to find it, sir.

57
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,337
That's right, Simple Simon.

58
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,132
Check, see if it's stolen.

59
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,260
l want this bastard busted out of his job.

60
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,847
We'll take care of this guy.
You fellas, just take it easy.

61
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,904
-This car registered to you?
-To him.

62
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,451
-l'll have to see the registration.
-Come on, give me that license.

63
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,536
Hi, Harry. ls this your case?

64
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,766
Walter?

65
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,854
Hello, Harry. What are you doing here?

66
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,774
This couldn't have happened
to a nicer bunch.

67
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,111
Ricca, Weinstein, his attorney.
James Cantina, the driver.

68
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,530
What about the bodyguard?

69
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,990
We're checking that out now, Lieutenant.

70
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,744
Looks like somebody saved
the taxpayers a lot of money, doesn't it?

71
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,790
Callahan, what're you doing here?
You're on loan to stakeout.

72
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,127
We had nothing hot on,
besides, we were close.

73
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,798
Callahan, you get your lying ass in gear
and get back to that stakeout squad.

74
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,925
Anything else, you call it in.

75
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,684
-Who do you think did this, Briggs?
-You're on loan to stakeout, Callahan.

76
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,270
That's right, Lieutenant, you saw to that.

77
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,481
l've got nothing personal
against you, Callahan.

78
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,027
But we can't have the public crying,
''police brutality''...

79
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,070
...every time you're on the street.

80
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,573
You just might need me on a job like this.

81
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,825
Whoever did this was very good at it.

82
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,994
You'd sure be the one to know, Harry.

83
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,955
-Well, l just work for this city, Briggs.
-So do l.

84
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,207
Longer than you.

85
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,129
And l never had to take my gun out
of its holster, once. l'm proud of that.

86
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,591
Well, you're a good man, Lieutenant.

87
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,510
A good man always knows his limitations.

88
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,680
Lt. Briggs?

89
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,269
What did you get?

90
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,064
Well, it looks like
they were killed with a Magnum.

91
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,859
The boys now are checking
the blood types and for fingerprints.

92
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,197
What do you have?

93
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:41,785
Driver's license. Doesn't look at all
like the usual gangster crap, does it?

94
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,372
Briggs has his nose up his ass today.

95
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,376
l guess he thinks
that's where his promotion is.

96
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,419
See you later, Harry.

97
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,048
What's with you and Briggs anyway?

98
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,716
Jealousy.

99
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,970
He knows this is the kind of case
l should be on. lt's just a matter of time.

100
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,890
Hey, Early, want to get in on this?

101
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,102
What the hell is that about?

102
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,605
They're giving odds on how long
you'll stay alive being my partner.

103
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,940
Are you kidding?

104
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,233
Nope.

105
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,151
How long did your last partner go?

106
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,403
A couple of weeks.

107
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,656
Don't worry, he's still alive,
teaching college.

108
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,367
You have another trade, Smith?

109
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,993
No, no. Do you?

110
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,870
No, but Bill Mackenzie does.

111
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,081
Who in the hell is Bill Mackenzie?

112
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,334
He's an ex-homicide man,
has a snack shop out at the airport.

113
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,545
Greatest burgers in town. Hungry?

114
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,507
-How can you be hungry after seeing that?
-Seeing what?

115
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:58,111
So, Ricca finally bought it.
There must be hope for the world yet.

116
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,655
How about you? Do you want something?

117
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,617
-We got chili and garlic bread today.
-No, thank you. l don't feel very hungry.

118
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,413
ln broad daylight at close range?
Must've looked like ripe melons.

119
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,710
Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix,
use white courtesy telephone.

120
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,295
Now all keep calm.

121
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,633
l'll never forget the Floyd case.

122
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,886
Got it with an axe during the rush hour.

123
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,221
How about some cream pie?

124
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,725
Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix,
use white courtesy telephone.

125
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,062
Must be trouble.
That's the airport code name for trouble.

126
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,568
We've got 90 people being terrorized
by those maniacs...

127
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,445
...in boarding area B right now.

128
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,532
What's taking so long?
They said they'd be there in 15 minutes?

129
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,117
Where's that overseas pilot?

130
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,911
l don't understand.
How did they get through security?

131
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,996
-l don't know.
-Any problems here?

132
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,581
What are you doing here?

133
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,459
-l'm sorry, you'll have to leave.
-l'm a police officer.

134
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,879
We've got two frantic hijackers
on our New York flight.

135
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,134
-Have you called the FBl?
-They're on their way here right now.

136
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,220
But the hijackers want an overseas pilot
before they take off.

137
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,308
May l make a suggestion?

138
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,177
Good afternoon.

139
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,305
You took your goddamn time about it.
Now, close that door!

140
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,515
All right, what's in there?

141
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,852
Overseas charts and flight plans.

142
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,103
Set it down!

143
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,607
All right, turn around.

144
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,614
Stay there.

145
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,250
All right, turn around here.

146
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,128
Here! Now get in there!

147
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:08,760
-lt's all yours now.
-All right, get this thing up!

148
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,972
Where to?

149
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,559
You get us up,
l'll tell you where to when we're up.

150
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,275
You want to put us in take-off position?

151
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,490
Starting three.

152
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,921
Move it!

153
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,383
All right, l'll take it.

154
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,459
That's right, Lieutenant. We were lucky
to have one of your men here.

155
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,003
He's on board now, an lnspector Callahan.

156
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:08,797
Callahan!

157
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,359
Excuse me, Captain.
l know this may sound silly...

158
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,027
...but can you fly?

159
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,447
No. Never had a lesson.

160
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:03,977
Sit down!

161
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,398
What are you doing here, Lieutenant?

162
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,894
Harry! You crazy son of a bitch!
l could've killed you.

163
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:31,147
Yeah, l noticed that, Charlie.
What the hell you doing?

164
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,233
l haven't seen you in a coon's age.

165
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,903
l been meaning to drop by,
but we've been kind of busy.

166
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,615
Yeah, well,
l ain't living with Carol anymore.

167
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:42,826
Sorry to hear that.

168
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,955
Yeah. lt's my third time at bat.

169
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,083
Where's the time go?

170
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,877
l'm afraid of time.

171
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:57,716
l know you 10 years already, ever since
l first came out here, you realize that?

172
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,927
You don't look older to me.
Do l look older to you?

173
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,933
Why don't you put in
for some desk work, Charlie?

174
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,893
You don't need the streets anymore.

175
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,187
We should've put our 20 in the Marines.

176
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:15,400
These days,
a cop kills a hoodlum on the street...

177
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,028
...he might as well just dump
the body some place.

178
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,488
Because those snot-nosed
young bastards...

179
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:24,159
...down at the DA's office will crucify them
one way or another.

180
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:27,162
A hood can kill a cop,
but let a cop kill a hood....

181
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,039
Am l right?

182
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,919
You put in plenty of time,
why don't you go for retirement?

183
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,380
What the hell, you don't need this.

184
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,801
l know you 10 years.
l'll tell you something, l'll never retire.

185
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,178
Never!

186
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,681
l'm going out fighting.

187
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,768
That's the only way to go. Am l right?

188
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,739
You boys rookies?

189
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,866
Yes, sir. Traffic.

190
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,536
l'm John Davis. This is Phil Sweet.

191
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,039
That's Red Astrachan, Mike Grimes.

192
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:56,126
-You're lnspector Harry Callahan, no?
-That's right.

193
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,254
What are you doing here?
Don't you have regular times for this?

194
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:02,215
You shouldn't be on the streets
if you can't shoot well.

195
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,719
-Killers don't make allowances.
-You're in big trouble.

196
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,262
Can't fault you there.

197
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,973
Are you shooting
in the combat championship next week?

198
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:10,974
l always do.

199
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:14,686
-You win every year, don't you?
-Became sort of an institution around here.

200
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,980
Yes, sir, we've heard all about you.

201
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:22,360
This is about the only time
l get this place alone.

202
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:25,405
We'll leave if you'd like
the range to yourself.

203
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,618
No, that's all right.

204
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,331
What kind of a load do you use in that .44?

205
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,833
A light special.

206
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,711
This size gun gives me better control
and less recoil...

207
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,422
...than a .357 Magnum with wadcutters.

208
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,787
That's not bad.

209
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:16,748
Care to try?

210
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,541
No, sir. No, l don't think so.

211
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,294
-Come on, give it a try.
-Go on, Sweet.

212
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,257
l'm farsighted.

213
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:32,639
Don't drop it.

214
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:53,743
Hey, that's not bad.

215
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:57,372
Well, l think it's just a little heavy for me.
l missed one.

216
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:58,832
You'll get used to it.

217
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,501
Where did you learn to shoot?
Not around here.

218
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,421
No, sir, no.
Airborne Rangers, Special Forces.

219
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,508
And the rest of these guys, even close?

220
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,052
Well, Grimes here, he's...

221
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,555
...l guess he's about even with me.

222
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,683
Astrachan's a little better on a good day.

223
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,853
And Davis is just dog nuts.
He's a lot better.

224
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:26,026
A lot better? Sure show a sense of style.
Sweet, is it?

225
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,193
Yes, sir.

226
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,613
When l get back on Homicide,
l hope you boys will come see me.

227
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,615
-Good.
-Thank you very much, we'd like that.

228
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,325
Let's go!

229
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,327
-Good night, sir.
-Good night.

230
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,956
Who buys? The sun was in my eyes!

231
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,209
You got to be on, Grimes.
The sun is always in your eyes.

232
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:47,047
How come l always have to buy
the beer for you turkeys.

233
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,800
Where do you want to go?

234
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,183
Put your hat on!

235
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,018
Come on now, baby.

236
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,823
Will you look at my ring!

237
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:19,973
lt's beautiful!

238
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,430
ls this a gang war?

239
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,140
You have nothing to say?

240
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:48,144
-Do you expect more murder or violence?
-l have nothing to say at this time.

241
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:50,814
-ls this a gang war, Lieutenant?
-No comment.

242
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:55,276
There were 200 murders last year.
Do you want to make a comment on that?

243
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:01,574
There'll be no bombs in pools.
This town belongs to the people.

244
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,827
We're gonna have law and order here.

245
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,621
That's all l have to say at this time.

246
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:08,915
What does that mean, Lieutenant?

247
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,302
You're it!

248
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,600
You're it!

249
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,854
Don't you want to play with us?

250
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:34,065
-Well, l don't know, sweetheart.
-Just a little while?

251
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,443
You're really getting the full treatment.

252
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,987
lt's not often you get a sit-down dinner.

253
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:44,159
Okay, kids. All right, that's enough.

254
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:48,621
-Just a little bit more, just five minutes?
-Let's go, let's go.

255
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:50,999
Say good night to Harry and off to bed.

256
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:53,126
-Good night.
-Good night, my love.

257
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,546
-Good night.
-Take it easy.

258
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,923
-'Bye.
-Good night, Harry.

259
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:06,056
Take the jacket out of your mouth,
sweetheart.

260
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,817
Boy, sometimes they're too much for me.

261
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:22,113
But then l can't afford
a woman coming in anymore.

262
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:25,075
l think you manage quite well.

263
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:27,160
Well, l just laugh all day long.

264
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,497
l'm glad you called.

265
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,335
Tell me, have you seen Charlie?

266
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,047
Yes, l saw him last night.

267
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,590
Wanted to see the kids...

268
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:44,344
...and then he started playing
a little Russian roulette with his revolver.

269
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,638
What happened?

270
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,684
What could l do? l went next door,
we finally got him to stop.

271
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,477
What do you tell your children...

272
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,772
...when they ask why their father
tried to shoot himself?.

273
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,358
What did you tell them?

274
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:02,779
l just said it was a special kind of sickness
that some people have...

275
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:07,075
...and that there are doctors
who could cure it...as if they could.

276
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,664
Do you know where he's living right now?

277
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,292
l don't know and l don't care anymore.

278
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:22,549
He's so sick.
He shouldn't be allowed to carry a gun.

279
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:31,349
Do you know that he was living
in North Beach with some nude dancer?

280
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,567
Oh, well, l'm glad l'm over that one.

281
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,154
l do have to survive.

282
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:45,655
You will.

283
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,872
You know, Harry, if l ask you
a personal question, would you mind?

284
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:56,166
Sure, go ahead.

285
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,504
Are you sure?
Because, well, it's a little difficult.

286
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:06,259
Look, we've been friends a long time,
go ahead and ask.

287
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:14,100
Well, l'm just wondering
why you've never made a pass at me.

288
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,316
Why?

289
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,821
Goddamn it.

290
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:32,494
With all those kids
do you think l'll ever get laid?

291
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:43,296
Hello?

292
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,258
Yes, just a moment.

293
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,469
lt's for you.

294
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:51,971
What's happening?

295
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,139
Yeah?

296
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,892
Yeah, Early, l saw it on TV.

297
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,647
l'll be right down.
l'll come in the back way.

298
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,486
-That's it, right?
-l have to go.

299
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,738
Good night, Harry.

300
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,242
Good night, sweetheart.

301
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:15,972
How's it going?

302
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,724
By the magazine rack.

303
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:21,895
The owner remembers seeing him
just before the last robbery.

304
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:25,565
Yeah, he doesn't look much
like a paying customer, does he?

305
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:30,528
-There's a car parked out in front.
-That's right, a no parking zone.

306
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:33,239
Get over there by the door
with that shotgun.

307
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:34,240
Okay.

308
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,498
You think it'll be a hit or a miss?

309
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,794
Well, here's three salty looking dudes.

310
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:42,809
Freeze, nigger!

311
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:47,105
-What you got there?
-Don't you go setting off no alarm.

312
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,190
You! Get over here, fast!

313
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:52,527
-You got a safe, nigger?
-No.

314
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,821
You lying sack of shit.

315
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:02,495
All right, take it easy. Take it easy now.

316
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:04,122
Suck it!

317
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:06,875
Suck it!

318
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,378
l'll kill you. l said, suck it.

319
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:14,591
You go find that safe.

320
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:20,221
Right here is where l kill me a nigger.

321
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,016
Get on your knees.

322
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,186
Get on your knees.

323
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,025
Better get out there now.

324
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,193
Not yet.

325
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,196
Get on your knees.

326
00:36:58,885 --> 00:36:59,844
Police!

327
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:00,887
Drop it!

328
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:07,060
All right, hold it!

329
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,653
l never shot a man.

330
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:04,242
Why don't you help the lady?

331
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,621
lt's all right, ma'am.

332
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:36,608
You handled yourself real well tonight.

333
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:39,319
You work close. Man, you work close.

334
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,534
Hey, where are you guys off to?

335
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:50,205
-The Downtown Bowl on Eddy Street.
-Oh, yeah. See you later.

336
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:53,833
-You know them?
-They came from the academy after me.

337
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,794
They stick together like fly paper.

338
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:58,672
Everybody thought
they were queer for each other.

339
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:02,300
l'll tell you something,
if the rest of you could shoot like them...

340
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:05,637
...l wouldn't care
if the whole damn department was queer.

341
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,824
Excuse me, it's very important.

342
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:30,203
What do you think you're doing?

343
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:44,134
1000 O'Farrell.

344
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:10,035
We're not going to get there
unless you keep your eyes on the road.

345
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,329
Right on. 1000 O'Farrell.

346
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:54,204
Too bad you're not on welfare.

347
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:56,998
l'd give you a freebie.

348
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:04,255
Drive.

349
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:15,183
-Sidney, l was just on my way to see you.
-Where to?

350
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:18,436
-Just keep on going until l tell you to stop.
-Yes, sir.

351
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:19,938
Drop that flag.

352
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,943
-You're on your way to see me?
-Yes, Sidney, honest.

353
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:27,112
How come you didn't come by the crib?

354
00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:28,822
-Well--
-Don't shit me.

355
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:30,281
l wouldn't do that.

356
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:34,077
-l've been waiting for you for one week.
-l've been working the convention.

357
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,455
-No telephones in that hotel?
-l've been working like hell, you know?

358
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:41,251
Let me show you.

359
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:47,173
-See? lt's all here, all l got.
-All?

360
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:50,260
Looks like you've been holding out on me.

361
00:41:50,343 --> 00:41:54,014
No, l haven't. l've been straight
with you, Sidney. You know me.

362
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:58,184
Damn right l know you. Let's see
how much there is in the titty bank.

363
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:02,105
Hello, Mr. Green.

364
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:06,735
Check out the snatch bank, too.

365
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,698
Damn right l know you.

366
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:14,951
l was gonna give it all to you,
but you didn't give me a chance.

367
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:17,579
Bitch, you had your chance.
l was your last chance.

368
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:20,040
Everybody else in town
threw your black ass out.

369
00:42:21,374 --> 00:42:22,208
Help me!

370
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:44,994
Good day, sir.
ls this car registered to you?

371
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,205
Yes, sir. This is my car.

372
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:50,917
You must be new. You know who l am?

373
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:54,254
l'll still have to see your license
and registration, sir.

374
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:57,298
l believe you were speeding
coming across the bridge.

375
00:46:57,525 --> 00:46:58,401
Hi.

376
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:00,779
Hi.

377
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:02,989
What's your name?

378
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:04,240
Sunny.

379
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:09,954
l've been living here for six months now.
lt's funny l've never met you before.

380
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,791
Well, l work a lot.

381
00:47:13,124 --> 00:47:14,209
l know.

382
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,420
-You're the cop who lives upstairs.
-That's right.

383
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:19,589
Mind if l ask you a question?

384
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,341
No, go ahead.

385
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:24,678
What does a girl have to do
to go to bed with you?

386
00:47:31,017 --> 00:47:32,894
Try knocking on the door.

387
00:48:55,393 --> 00:48:56,728
-Hi.
-Hi.

388
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,482
Do you always live in the dark?

389
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:04,611
Well, you meet a better class of people
in the dark sometimes. Come on in.

390
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:10,825
Sit down.

391
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:23,630
Harry, this is Briggs. Are you alone?

392
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:26,466
No, actually,
l'm entertaining a young lady friend.

393
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,804
Put your pants back on, Callahan,
and come to the city morgue right away.

394
00:49:31,304 --> 00:49:33,473
The morgue? What the hell for, Briggs?

395
00:49:33,598 --> 00:49:36,643
l'm not on homicide anymore.
l'm a stakeout man now, remember?

396
00:49:37,018 --> 00:49:38,228
Not anymore, Callahan.

397
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:40,605
You and your partner
are back on homicide.

398
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,109
This is a little dramatic, isn't it, Briggs?
Not your usual style.

399
00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:45,777
lt's meant to be, Callahan.

400
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:49,197
This thing might be bigger
than even we think it is.

401
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,409
Hijacking and gambling.

402
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:56,204
Trucking.

403
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,918
Narcotics and prostitution.

404
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:03,586
This is the cream in the bottle.

405
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,922
Someone wants
to put the courts out of business.

406
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:08,216
So far, you've said nothing wrong.

407
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:10,301
This one just came in an hour ago.

408
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:13,513
Somebody wants it all.
This guy was just a pimp.

409
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,515
That's one of his girls.

410
00:50:15,932 --> 00:50:17,308
How did she get it?

411
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:21,730
Sometime before he got hit, he poured
a can of drain cleaner down her throat.

412
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:25,358
That shows a certain sense of style.

413
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:27,902
You're all heart, Callahan.

414
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:30,572
Am l gonna have to have him
leaning over my shoulder?

415
00:50:30,655 --> 00:50:33,033
You work with Briggs on this, Callahan.

416
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:37,537
But if you ever lean out of line, so help me,
l'll flop you lower than whale shit.

417
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,457
Speaking of whale shit,
what have you turned up, Briggs?

418
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,876
Nobody in my department
is sitting on their ass.

419
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:44,961
See this thing, Callahan? The chief.

420
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,672
He calls me on this all the time.
Even in the can.

421
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,841
l haven't been out of my shoes
in 48 hours...

422
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:52,469
...and still we have no witnesses, not one.

423
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:55,805
ln these cases, there's always
an officer right on top of the crime.

424
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,724
But nobody's ever seen a thing.

425
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:01,978
-Who was the officer on this one?
-A patrolman, Sweet.

426
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,396
Wasn't it, Briggs?

427
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:05,482
Sweet seems like a good man.

428
00:51:05,815 --> 00:51:08,735
l'll get on the ballistic reports
first thing in the morning.

429
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:12,155
We ran all the slugs through ballistics.
We'll never see those guns.

430
00:51:12,238 --> 00:51:14,866
lt was too professional,
you're wasting your time.

431
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:17,160
Well, it takes me time, Briggs.

432
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:22,165
A man has to know his limitations.

433
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:03,123
Warm enough?

434
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,339
You're my first cop.

435
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,138
Guess that'll be two firsts tonight,
won't it?

436
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:57,927
What do the others look like?

437
00:52:58,011 --> 00:53:00,347
The gun was a .357 Magnum.

438
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:03,683
The other bullets are all too deformed
to do us any good.

439
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:07,979
Hollow points, fired point-blank, you know.
We were lucky to get these two.

440
00:53:08,646 --> 00:53:10,940
l found them in the pimp's car.

441
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:13,109
.357 Magnum?

442
00:53:15,653 --> 00:53:18,239
Maybe it's a cop. Maybe it's Harry.

443
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:21,201
Nobody hates hoodlums
as much as he does.

444
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:26,706
Whoever it is, he enjoys it.

445
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:29,668
lt's possible the man was dead
with the first shot.

446
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:32,128
The others were thrown in
just for good measure.

447
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:35,632
-He unloaded a whole magazine into him.
-One big mothering hole, huh?

448
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,887
Well, everybody has to pay something.

449
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:45,892
He would have to be standing right here,
this close...

450
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:47,894
...point-blank range.

451
00:53:51,439 --> 00:53:54,693
The driver's license
and the $100 bill were out.

452
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:57,529
Almost like he was showing it
to a traffic cop.

453
00:53:57,612 --> 00:53:58,655
Yeah.

454
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:03,910
From what we have, it figures somebody
to be impersonating a police officer.

455
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:06,871
On the cars, at least.
lt's been done before.

456
00:54:07,872 --> 00:54:11,918
This close, it would have to be
somebody he would never recognize.

457
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:14,254
Or never suspect.

458
00:54:18,508 --> 00:54:22,053
Lou Guzman, ex-meat lugger
with a first-grade education.

459
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:26,558
He started working for the old boss
of bosses as a hitter.

460
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:31,312
He controls narcotics state-wide,
and now dabbles in prostitution...

461
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:35,525
...has big friends everywhere.
l want Casale and DiGiorgio on him.

462
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:37,235
Next. Thank you.

463
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:41,740
This one is for your special talents,
Callahan.

464
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:44,117
Frank Palancio.

465
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,120
Two hundred and twelve pounds.

466
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:51,624
lndicted for murder 23 times,
no convictions.

467
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:54,711
Complains about his health now.

468
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:59,090
Suffers from ulcers, migraine headaches.
Dangerously violent.

469
00:55:00,633 --> 00:55:03,053
At one point,
he was Ricca's principle assassin.

470
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:05,597
lf you mix it with him, he won't back off.

471
00:55:06,264 --> 00:55:07,766
He's all yours, Callahan.

472
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:10,518
That's very nice, Lieutenant,
but l don't think Palancio--

473
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:12,437
l want you on him, Callahan.

474
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,191
l'd bust Palancio for stepping
on a crack on the sidewalk if l could...

475
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:19,944
...but this isn't his style.
Not the cars anyway, it's too direct.

476
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:23,573
Callahan, you just keep your nose
pressed against Palancio's ass...

477
00:55:23,656 --> 00:55:27,077
...until l get a warrant
from the DA's office to bring him in.

478
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,496
And l want the first conviction
on this animal.

479
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:32,499
Conviction?
He's liable to be your next victim.

480
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:34,918
What are you asking for, Lieutenant?

481
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:40,298
l'm not asking you to follow him, lnspector.
For the last goddamn time, l'm telling you.

482
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:41,508
Next.

483
00:55:43,259 --> 00:55:46,971
Nick Royale, Palancio's No. 1 hitter.

484
00:55:47,972 --> 00:55:49,599
He's had good training.

485
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:15,291
What's happening?

486
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:18,628
Nothing, just a lot of peeping and checking,
checking and peeping.

487
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:21,923
l knew an old boy once
who used to keep pigs under his bed.

488
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:23,800
Pigs? The eating kind?

489
00:56:23,883 --> 00:56:27,262
The eating kind.
ls all you ever think of your stomach?

490
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:36,604
That's very interesting.
l think we better get going.

491
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:37,564
Yeah.

492
00:57:59,979 --> 00:58:03,733
-They're splitting up. Which one, Harry?
-We'll stay with these two.

493
00:58:05,443 --> 00:58:08,154
Across the bridge,
it's out of our jurisdiction.

494
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:09,572
Yeah.

495
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:14,828
Well?

496
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:17,163
Stick with the money.

497
00:58:39,644 --> 00:58:41,104
Pull over and stop.

498
00:58:56,703 --> 00:59:00,248
What are you trying to do?
He doesn't even know we're cops.

499
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:04,294
He may panic, and besides,
we don't belong over here anyway.

500
00:59:05,086 --> 00:59:06,629
l hope he does panic.

501
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,176
Then l'll get him for 23 other murders.

502
00:59:11,426 --> 00:59:13,219
And if he doesn't...

503
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:16,723
...then l may be right about something
that's been nagging at me.

504
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,558
l sure hope l'm not.

505
00:59:19,392 --> 00:59:20,393
What?

506
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,480
l don't want to be winning bets
for anybody.

507
00:59:37,118 --> 00:59:39,412
Go a little faster, l'm on their side.

508
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:43,041
-Roll down your window.
-What? Are you out of your mind?

509
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:46,461
-l've never been wrong yet, have l?
-l don't know why l'm doing this.

510
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:50,548
-Say, excuse me. Could you help us out?
-What do you want?

511
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,218
Maybe you could help us,
we seem to be lost.

512
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:56,846
We were looking for the entrance
to San Quentin. You know where that is?

513
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,057
lt's back there. Don't you see too good?

514
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:03,186
Yeah, l see fine. l just wanted to know
whether you knew where San Quentin was.

515
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:05,605
And you do, don't you, asshole.

516
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:15,323
Get you yet, you son of a bitch.

517
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,038
You always gotta do things your way,
don't you?

518
01:00:22,455 --> 01:00:24,624
No wonder Briggs stays on your tail.

519
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:30,588
You do things someone else's way
and you take your life in your own hands.

520
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:52,819
That son of a bitch Guzman!

521
01:00:54,112 --> 01:00:56,823
He hasn't gone out for almost
24 hours now.

522
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:25,310
Hey, one of our guys took a spill.

523
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,981
lt's Charlie McCoy! Seems to be okay.

524
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:32,192
Let me take a look.

525
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,111
Yeah, he's okay.

526
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:47,749
There he is.

527
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:51,795
So, all you've got to do
is sit around all day, Guzman?

528
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:26,329
This coke is out of sight!

529
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:28,998
Oh, Guzman gets the best, baby.

530
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:32,293
Oh, you bitch. Don't spill it.

531
01:02:32,752 --> 01:02:35,046
That stuff's worth $900 an ounce.

532
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:36,965
You better not spill it.

533
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:39,801
Don't get so uptight.

534
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:43,888
Nobody says ''don't'' to me.
You understand? Nobody.

535
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:48,351
l never touch the stuff.

536
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:51,146
You want to put that over there now?

537
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:18,465
Take over for me, will you, Ed?

538
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,119
Damn, l wish something would happen.

539
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:49,662
Take it easy.

540
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,665
That's what stakeouts are all about.
Waiting.

541
01:05:11,536 --> 01:05:13,204
No, please! No!

542
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:20,754
Frank!

543
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:33,451
-Just what the hell is going on?
-Somebody killed a cop.

544
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:36,579
Folks, there's been a little trouble here.
Everyone stand back.

545
01:06:36,663 --> 01:06:38,581
Please, ma'am, move back.

546
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:43,378
There's been some trouble.

547
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:45,714
What happened?

548
01:06:47,173 --> 01:06:49,217
Everything seems to be all right, folks.

549
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,635
What's going on?

550
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:54,639
Move it, people.

551
01:06:55,765 --> 01:06:57,475
Please, sir, stand back.

552
01:06:58,018 --> 01:06:59,269
Yes, sir.

553
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:01,938
Yes, sir.

554
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:05,358
No, sir. We won't let anything
out to the press.

555
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:07,986
Yes, sir.

556
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:12,282
You endangered an entire investigation
by trying to push something.

557
01:07:12,365 --> 01:07:14,284
Not to mention your own lives.

558
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:16,536
You blew the whole Palancio stakeout.

559
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:19,581
lnstead of keeping him under surveillance
as l told you to...

560
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:23,001
...you had to harass him.
What do you have to say about that?

561
01:07:23,084 --> 01:07:24,711
What do l tell Avery? What?

562
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:31,593
You tell him it's not Palancio.
You tell him it's a traffic cop.

563
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:34,512
A cop?

564
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:35,722
That's right.

565
01:07:35,805 --> 01:07:38,224
A traffic cop. Are you out of your mind?

566
01:07:39,642 --> 01:07:42,562
Do you expect me to believe
that a traffic cop...

567
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:46,316
...is killing off all the top criminals
in the city? Who?

568
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:52,405
lt's Charlie McCoy.

569
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:56,868
He's ready for the rubber gun squad.
He even tried to kill himself.

570
01:07:57,327 --> 01:07:58,578
Charlie McCoy.

571
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:05,043
Guzman was hit today.

572
01:08:06,586 --> 01:08:09,589
A cop was killed. lt was Charlie McCoy.

573
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:16,054
-McCoy?
-Yes, Charlie McCoy.

574
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,974
The only reason l don't bust you
into the bag this minute...

575
01:08:20,058 --> 01:08:22,769
...is l know the two of you
were close friends.

576
01:08:23,436 --> 01:08:26,773
l was just about to call his wife.
Or you can, if you want to.

577
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:28,566
l know he had kids.

578
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:30,568
Yeah!

579
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:34,698
-Who reported it?
-Davis.

580
01:08:34,906 --> 01:08:35,949
Davis?

581
01:08:36,074 --> 01:08:38,576
What happened
to the DiGiorgio stakeout team?

582
01:08:38,743 --> 01:08:42,622
lt was an accidental coincidence.
Davis happened to be going by, it happens.

583
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,833
McCoy was already dead
when he got there.

584
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:46,793
Any witnesses?

585
01:08:47,043 --> 01:08:47,961
None.

586
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:53,216
-l'll make that call.
-Go ahead.

587
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:57,846
Harry, if it means anything coming
from me, l'm sorry about Charlie.

588
01:08:58,138 --> 01:09:00,098
But it's Palancio, believe me.

589
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,060
l'll have a warrant in 48 hours.
You can pick him up.

590
01:09:04,185 --> 01:09:05,478
He's all yours.

591
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:43,183
Well, thank you for coming, Harry.

592
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:45,852
You sure you have to leave?

593
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:50,398
l won't have any place to go
for a sit-down dinner anymore.

594
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:54,235
l never really did like it here very much.

595
01:09:55,695 --> 01:09:57,989
l always liked the change of seasons.

596
01:10:03,828 --> 01:10:07,082
l'm going to take him home. lt's time.

597
01:10:08,249 --> 01:10:10,168
lt's time he went home.

598
01:10:15,715 --> 01:10:17,884
Come on, kids, let's get in the car.

599
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:31,189
lt was nice of that young man
to help us with the children.

600
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:37,028
Goodbye, Harry. We'll all miss you.

601
01:10:38,071 --> 01:10:39,197
'Bye, doll.

602
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:48,915
Take them
to the passenger terminal, please.

603
01:10:58,925 --> 01:11:02,137
lt was nice of you to come out.
You didn't have to do that.

604
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:05,432
lf l'd have been there sooner,
he might still be alive.

605
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:09,185
He didn't deserve to get it that way.

606
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,772
lf there's anything l can do....

607
01:11:14,107 --> 01:11:16,067
l feel responsible somehow.

608
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:47,932
The next shooter is Callahan.
Davis on deck.

609
01:12:29,599 --> 01:12:32,936
You sure shot the pants off
of everybody with that score, Harry.

610
01:12:33,019 --> 01:12:34,938
l've never seen you smoother.

611
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,024
By the way, l personally want to tell you...

612
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:40,902
...how sorry l am
about what happened to Charlie.

613
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:46,282
What l can't figure out, Frank,
is how that kid, Davis, got in there first.

614
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:48,702
You guys were right across the street.

615
01:12:48,993 --> 01:12:53,331
l don't have a goddamned idea, Harry.
The kid came out of nowhere.

616
01:12:54,582 --> 01:12:57,210
We were in that garage
before you could spit.

617
01:12:57,585 --> 01:13:01,006
Maybe l'm slowing down in my old age
or something, l don't know.

618
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:05,760
l want to be the first to congratulate you
on what l think will be the winning score.

619
01:13:05,844 --> 01:13:07,679
You shaded me by seven points.

620
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:10,557
The only person now
who has a chance is Davis.

621
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:17,564
Shoot 'em up!

622
01:13:53,933 --> 01:13:55,643
l think the kid beat you, Harry.

623
01:13:57,979 --> 01:13:59,105
lt happens.

624
01:13:59,356 --> 01:14:02,108
Harry, he edged you by four points.

625
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:04,986
That evens it up on the overall champion.

626
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,697
You have your choice in the shoot-off.

627
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:10,200
Bull's eye or combat?

628
01:14:13,536 --> 01:14:14,329
Combat.

629
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:00,834
Out!

630
01:15:09,342 --> 01:15:11,761
Five, 46 seconds. Score, perfect.

631
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:14,723
Good luck, sir.

632
01:15:54,846 --> 01:15:55,889
A good guy!

633
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:57,599
That last one was a good guy!

634
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:14,074
36 seconds.
But l'm sorry, Harry, you hit a good guy.

635
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,576
You had a bad break.
l really don't deserve it.

636
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:17,869
You won, didn't you?

637
01:16:17,952 --> 01:16:19,954
-Yes, sir, but--
-That's all that matters.

638
01:16:20,038 --> 01:16:21,539
You mind if l try that one?

639
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:29,756
Chester, how about six?

640
01:16:48,358 --> 01:16:50,902
Not bad. l seem to have lost the last one.

641
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:54,114
You get used to it.

642
01:16:56,449 --> 01:16:58,493
l can see how you would, at that.

643
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:58,553
You said five minutes
and l've been waiting for a half an hour.

644
01:17:58,636 --> 01:18:00,347
Don't you ever get hungry?

645
01:18:03,683 --> 01:18:07,312
-lt just didn't seem like a half hour.
-Yeah, well it has been.

646
01:18:07,937 --> 01:18:11,024
l went over to my butcher's yesterday
and picked up some veal.

647
01:18:11,107 --> 01:18:15,445
Pops is really an artist, man. l could
watch that man cut meat all day long.

648
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:18,865
Why don't you come home with me and....

649
01:18:18,948 --> 01:18:21,868
My wife's a good cook.
Have a little dinner with us.

650
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:32,045
No, thanks. l just saw something
that killed my appetite.

651
01:18:40,303 --> 01:18:44,265
We'll catch those animals with their pants
down. l was going to call you at home.

652
01:18:44,349 --> 01:18:46,893
We got our search warrants
and multiple charges.

653
01:18:46,976 --> 01:18:49,646
We're going to make a city-wide raid
tomorrow morning.

654
01:18:49,729 --> 01:18:54,025
Palancio is yours.
Just don't take him out head-first, Harry.

655
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:58,154
l think you'll find what l want to show you
in ballistics very interesting.

656
01:18:58,571 --> 01:19:01,950
You'll find more leads than you can
shake a stick at tomorrow morning.

657
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:08,581
-Good morning, Harry. Sir.
-Walter.

658
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:10,917
Do you mind excusing us
for a few minutes?

659
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:11,918
Sure.

660
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:22,512
There's only two.

661
01:19:22,595 --> 01:19:25,682
-l wonder what happened to the others.
-Federal boys have them.

662
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:49,581
Well?

663
01:19:50,373 --> 01:19:51,708
Take a look.

664
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,548
Close, real close.

665
01:19:59,716 --> 01:20:02,677
But there's still a lot of lines
that don't match up.

666
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:05,138
All this proves is that these two bullets...

667
01:20:05,221 --> 01:20:08,683
...came from barrels
with a similar twist and width of rifling.

668
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:11,269
You don't think it would stand up
as evidence?

669
01:20:11,853 --> 01:20:12,854
As it is, no.

670
01:20:12,937 --> 01:20:15,815
But l'll have a full comparison report made,
no problem.

671
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:19,069
You're probably right.
Besides, it isn't necessary yet.

672
01:20:19,402 --> 01:20:20,862
What do you mean, ''yet''?

673
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:23,073
Where'd you get that slug?

674
01:20:23,156 --> 01:20:26,910
-l'd just as soon not say for the time being.
-Don't play games on this.

675
01:20:26,993 --> 01:20:28,578
Whose side are you on anyway?

676
01:20:28,661 --> 01:20:31,331
lt's just a wild shot
and l'm probably wrong.

677
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:34,250
l'd like to handle it my own way.

678
01:20:35,168 --> 01:20:38,713
By the way, l'd like to have Davis
and Sweet as my back-up squad tomorrow.

679
01:20:40,173 --> 01:20:41,966
They're just rookies for Christ's sake.

680
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:45,845
You drum up somebody in the department
who can shoot as well and l'll use them.

681
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:48,473
Goddamn it,
there isn't supposed to be any shooting.

682
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:52,227
Besides, they don't have the experience yet
for a job like this.

683
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:56,272
How the hell's a man supposed to get
experience if nobody gives him a chance?

684
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:58,400
And Davis is the new pistol champion.

685
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:00,610
Suppose they panic and start shooting?

686
01:21:02,987 --> 01:21:07,826
Nothing wrong with shooting,
as long as the right people get shot.

687
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,970
-Let him know who you are and keep cool.
-Okay.

688
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:30,640
l want you to keep an eye
on Davis and Sweet.

689
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:31,766
What for?

690
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:33,518
Just do it, will you?

691
01:21:35,353 --> 01:21:36,396
All right.

692
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:38,732
-You all set?
-All set.

693
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:40,483
We'll take off in three cars.

694
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:43,236
Davis and Sweet will make the arrest.
Early will cover.

695
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:46,614
l'll be on the back at the pier
in case anybody makes a break for it.

696
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:49,159
lf there'll be trouble, that's where it'll start.

697
01:21:49,242 --> 01:21:52,579
We're holding the other squads back
until you've made your arrest.

698
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:56,708
Yours is the most important, it'll be
the first. We don't want any foul-ups.

699
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,626
-Right?
-Right.

700
01:22:00,628 --> 01:22:04,090
l'd never walk up to a door with Harry,
too many people don't like him.

701
01:22:04,549 --> 01:22:07,052
Thanks. l needed that.

702
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,182
-You boys ready?
-Yes, sir.

703
01:22:12,265 --> 01:22:15,477
-Thank you for requesting us.
-Sir, we won't let you down.

704
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,395
Well, l'm depending on that.

705
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:25,964
Yeah?

706
01:23:29,342 --> 01:23:30,510
Who is this?

707
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:38,768
What was that, Nickie?

708
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:46,192
Somebody said we'll be hit in two minutes.
They'll be dressed like cops.

709
01:23:47,944 --> 01:23:50,113
Did it sound like anybody you know?

710
01:23:50,655 --> 01:23:52,157
No, l couldn't tell.

711
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:09,758
Ed, Chuck...

712
01:24:12,802 --> 01:24:14,512
...get over to the windows.

713
01:24:18,266 --> 01:24:19,559
l got the water side.

714
01:24:19,642 --> 01:24:21,770
l'll take the street side.

715
01:24:21,978 --> 01:24:24,105
lf they are cops, this could be a set-up.

716
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:27,192
After the holes they put in Ricca
you want me to wait and see?

717
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:29,235
lf they're cops, they'll have papers.

718
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:30,653
Car coming, Frank.

719
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:33,406
There's a big guy out there.

720
01:24:37,327 --> 01:24:39,454
-He got a uniform on?
-No.

721
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:44,334
He ain't no cop.
Cops always come in the front door.

722
01:24:44,834 --> 01:24:46,002
Another car.

723
01:24:47,003 --> 01:24:49,464
Why didn't they come in squad cars
if they're cops?

724
01:24:49,547 --> 01:24:52,425
That big guy's working himself around
by those containers.

725
01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:55,845
He's got a gun out.

726
01:24:56,721 --> 01:24:57,972
Two uniforms in it.

727
01:24:59,307 --> 01:25:01,017
That ain't no cop's gun, Frank.

728
01:25:06,606 --> 01:25:09,317
There's a cop in uniform coming up
to the door.

729
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:17,909
We aren't open. Come back tomorrow.

730
01:25:18,618 --> 01:25:21,371
Police officers,
we'd like to ask you some questions.

731
01:25:21,454 --> 01:25:23,790
Yeah, l'm just a watchman. Nobody's here.

732
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,959
We're looking for Mr. Frank Palancio.

733
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:28,878
Would you open the door?
We have a warrant for his arrest.

734
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:30,755
l said nobody's here, goddamn it!

735
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:33,091
We have warrants
for a search of the premises.

736
01:25:33,174 --> 01:25:34,050
Serve them!

737
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:52,068
They got Sweet! Send some help! Quick!

738
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:41,034
Cease firing.

739
01:26:41,117 --> 01:26:44,537
Throw your weapons out and come out
with your hands behind your heads.

740
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:46,331
-Bullshit!
-Fuck you!

741
01:28:45,992 --> 01:28:50,121
You sure you don't want a local for this?
Takes about seven stitches.

742
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:51,331
No, thanks.

743
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:54,834
Okay, it's your ass.

744
01:28:56,127 --> 01:28:58,171
My head, cut's on my head.

745
01:28:59,839 --> 01:29:02,884
Why does everybody suddenly
become a comedian in here?

746
01:29:03,176 --> 01:29:05,095
Does he have to stay in here?

747
01:29:05,929 --> 01:29:10,141
No, l could stop and let the man's
brains run out all over his shoes.

748
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:14,104
Rogers, l don't need to have a doctor
display that kind of attitude.

749
01:29:14,187 --> 01:29:15,939
A police officer is dead.

750
01:29:16,856 --> 01:29:17,816
Sorry.

751
01:29:19,567 --> 01:29:22,612
l got those warrants
for a search of the premises, Callahan...

752
01:29:22,696 --> 01:29:25,657
...not for you to become
judge, jury and executioner.

753
01:29:25,782 --> 01:29:27,742
lt was supposed to be a simple arrest.

754
01:29:29,077 --> 01:29:32,414
Arresting a killer like Palancio
isn't always simple.

755
01:29:32,622 --> 01:29:34,374
People are guilty until proven--

756
01:29:34,457 --> 01:29:35,291
l mean....

757
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,503
Goddamn it, you know what l mean.

758
01:29:38,962 --> 01:29:42,007
The city's on the edge
of the worst violence in its history...

759
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:44,801
...and you have to start
full-scale military operations.

760
01:29:44,884 --> 01:29:48,346
l didn't start shooting at anyone
who didn't start shooting at me first.

761
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:52,684
Each time you pull out that gun,
my paperwork backs up for three months.

762
01:29:53,059 --> 01:29:55,812
The chief and l have already
conferred on this matter.

763
01:29:55,895 --> 01:29:58,189
A full investigation is warranted here.

764
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:04,988
What about a dead cop?

765
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:09,951
-l warned you against taking them.
-Sweet was killed with the first shot.

766
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:14,122
Besides they were tipped off.
They knew we were coming, Briggs.

767
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:16,791
How? Don't hand me that crap.

768
01:30:17,459 --> 01:30:20,837
They knew we were coming.
After 200 arrests, l know the difference.

769
01:30:22,505 --> 01:30:26,509
lf l have my way, Callahan, you won't make
another arrest as long as you live.

770
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:30,221
ls that all, Lieutenant?

771
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:33,016
No, that's not all.

772
01:30:34,559 --> 01:30:36,269
l want that slug you showed me.

773
01:30:38,396 --> 01:30:42,275
l ran that through ballistics, it was nothing.
The rifling was totally different.

774
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:45,028
lt's still State's evidence.
l want it anyway.

775
01:30:50,033 --> 01:30:51,034
Eat it.

776
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:18,228
Look, Harry, if it means anything,
l think you got the wrong end of the stick.

777
01:31:18,311 --> 01:31:20,063
-You do?
-Yeah.

778
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:22,399
What did they find when they got in there?

779
01:31:22,524 --> 01:31:25,985
Nothing. Palancio was as clean
as he could possibly be.

780
01:31:26,695 --> 01:31:28,780
They knew we were coming, Harry.

781
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:31,282
Why do you figure they opened up on us?

782
01:31:31,741 --> 01:31:34,661
They must've thought
it was a set-up like the others.

783
01:31:35,078 --> 01:31:37,080
-lt was.
-No.

784
01:31:38,415 --> 01:31:40,083
lt was a set-up, Early.

785
01:31:41,751 --> 01:31:46,089
What l'll lay on you seems so far-fetched,
l can't even believe it myself.

786
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:50,343
l gave up being surprised
working with you anyway.

787
01:31:51,261 --> 01:31:53,513
Would you be surprised if l told you...

788
01:31:53,596 --> 01:31:57,600
...a bunch of rookie cops were the ones
who were doing all the killing?

789
01:31:58,893 --> 01:31:59,853
See this?

790
01:32:00,061 --> 01:32:02,772
l gave Briggs a phony for the time being.

791
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,859
This is a bullet l took out
of the target range.

792
01:32:05,942 --> 01:32:07,902
lt came from Davis' gun.

793
01:32:08,069 --> 01:32:11,448
lt matches up with the one
taken out of Charlie McCoy's body.

794
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:13,908
Davis? That's insane.

795
01:32:14,367 --> 01:32:17,829
Maybe so, but somebody tipped-off
Palancio that we were coming.

796
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:22,000
Wanting me killed or Palancio
or hopefully both.

797
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,878
Yeah, but Sweet died today.

798
01:32:26,338 --> 01:32:28,131
Sweet was sacrificed.

799
01:32:29,549 --> 01:32:32,552
What's more important if l'm right,
l'll be sacrificed.

800
01:32:32,635 --> 01:32:36,222
They've gotta figure l told you,
which means you'll be sacrificed.

801
01:32:38,975 --> 01:32:40,143
Yeah.

802
01:32:41,561 --> 01:32:45,690
lf anything happens to me,
l want you to give that to Lt. Briggs.

803
01:32:45,774 --> 01:32:46,775
Okay.

804
01:32:46,858 --> 01:32:48,735
What happens if they get us both?

805
01:32:49,402 --> 01:32:50,445
Then they win.

806
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:57,160
lt's not hard to understand
how this could happen, the way things are.

807
01:32:57,285 --> 01:33:01,331
As incredible as it seems, there may be
a sub-organization within the police force.

808
01:33:01,414 --> 01:33:05,168
Sort of a death squad
like they had in Brazil some years back.

809
01:33:06,378 --> 01:33:07,337
Damn.

810
01:33:09,172 --> 01:33:13,551
Some nights l wake up, wonder
where the hell the world's going to.

811
01:33:16,846 --> 01:33:19,391
l want you to take care of yourself,
you understand?

812
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:52,924
Hi!

813
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:54,384
Hi.

814
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:57,053
Jesus, what happened to your face?

815
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:59,597
Nothing, just a few stitches.

816
01:34:01,558 --> 01:34:05,145
l was going to the market,
how about if l bring back a few beers?

817
01:34:05,562 --> 01:34:08,023
Good, l could use a beer right about now.

818
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:10,483
l've got your key, so l'll get your mail, too.

819
01:34:10,608 --> 01:34:11,776
All right, baby.

820
01:34:12,277 --> 01:34:13,528
Keep it warm.

821
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,765
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to prosecute a cop?

822
01:35:00,617 --> 01:35:02,744
You heroes have killed
a dozen people this week.

823
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:06,498
What are you gonna do next week?

824
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:10,794
Kill a dozen more.

825
01:35:12,295 --> 01:35:14,798
ls that what you guys are all about,
being heroes?

826
01:35:15,131 --> 01:35:16,591
All our heroes are dead.

827
01:35:17,008 --> 01:35:18,843
We are the first generation...

828
01:35:19,219 --> 01:35:21,012
...that's learned to fight.

829
01:35:21,638 --> 01:35:24,724
We're simply ridding society
of killers that would be caught...

830
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:27,894
...and sentenced anyway
if our courts worked properly.

831
01:35:29,562 --> 01:35:32,982
We began with the criminals
that the people know...

832
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:37,320
...so that our actions would be understood.

833
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:42,242
lt's not just a question
of whether or not to use violence.

834
01:35:43,993 --> 01:35:46,413
There simply is no other way, lnspector.

835
01:35:47,747 --> 01:35:49,249
You of all people...

836
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,835
...should understand that.

837
01:35:55,005 --> 01:35:57,507
Either you're for us or you're against us.

838
01:36:03,972 --> 01:36:05,974
l'm afraid you've misjudged me.

839
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:10,682
-Hi, Sunny.
-Hi, Sue.

840
01:38:17,981 --> 01:38:19,149
No, no!

841
01:38:20,442 --> 01:38:22,777
Harry, what are you doing?

842
01:38:29,826 --> 01:38:31,745
Hey, what's going on down here?

843
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,748
l'm taking the mailbox apart,
what does it look like?

844
01:38:34,831 --> 01:38:37,208
-You people live here, don't you?
-Yeah.

845
01:38:38,084 --> 01:38:41,087
What are you doing to the mailbox?
Did you lose you key?

846
01:38:41,171 --> 01:38:43,548
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business.

847
01:38:44,507 --> 01:38:47,635
That's my mailbox, too.
Don't you get smart with me!

848
01:38:49,012 --> 01:38:51,306
Tampering with the mail
is a federal offense.

849
01:38:51,556 --> 01:38:53,183
l'm calling the police.

850
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,352
l am the police.

851
01:38:56,978 --> 01:38:57,854
What?

852
01:39:00,148 --> 01:39:01,691
The cop that lives upstairs?

853
01:39:20,585 --> 01:39:21,544
What's that?

854
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:25,048
Plastic explosive.

855
01:39:27,217 --> 01:39:28,259
A bomb?

856
01:39:28,843 --> 01:39:29,803
That's right.

857
01:39:29,886 --> 01:39:33,139
lf you'd bothered me any more,
we'd all be stuck to the ceiling.

858
01:39:33,223 --> 01:39:36,393
-Do you want to hold it?
-No. l don't want to get involved.

859
01:39:39,396 --> 01:39:42,399
Go to your apartment and stay there.
Don't open for anybody.

860
01:41:13,907 --> 01:41:17,285
Homicide, Lt. Briggs,
lnspector Callahan calling.

861
01:41:20,205 --> 01:41:22,082
Callahan, where are you?

862
01:41:22,457 --> 01:41:24,918
Look, Briggs,
l just found a bomb in my mailbox.

863
01:41:25,001 --> 01:41:27,837
l want you to get a man
over to Early's house right away.

864
01:41:28,171 --> 01:41:28,963
What?

865
01:41:29,047 --> 01:41:31,007
l've got a bomb right here!

866
01:41:31,174 --> 01:41:33,343
Now get a man over to Early's,
you hear me?

867
01:41:34,052 --> 01:41:35,095
Right.

868
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:38,598
Stay right where you are.
l'll be down there myself.

869
01:41:38,682 --> 01:41:39,808
Don't move.

870
01:42:22,809 --> 01:42:23,810
Yeah?

871
01:42:33,236 --> 01:42:34,362
Come on in.

872
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:39,242
l don't like looking down one of those.

873
01:42:42,662 --> 01:42:44,039
Where's the bomb?

874
01:42:44,998 --> 01:42:46,541
Right on the dresser.

875
01:42:49,252 --> 01:42:52,922
All right. Let's get out of here.

876
01:42:53,923 --> 01:42:55,675
Avery will want to see this.

877
01:43:06,353 --> 01:43:09,606
You mind driving?
l want to take a closer look at this thing.

878
01:43:31,961 --> 01:43:34,798
This thing could be activated
by your mailbox key.

879
01:43:36,132 --> 01:43:37,425
Or by a timer.

880
01:43:41,137 --> 01:43:42,514
Turn right, here.

881
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:48,770
Get on the freeway.

882
01:43:49,979 --> 01:43:51,189
The freeway?

883
01:43:52,315 --> 01:43:54,693
You got a new route to city hall,
Lieutenant?

884
01:44:02,659 --> 01:44:06,287
Your gun's out of its holster, Briggs.
First time?

885
01:44:06,496 --> 01:44:08,665
You know you're not going to city hall.

886
01:44:08,748 --> 01:44:11,835
The only way you're going anywhere
is in a rubber bag.

887
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,837
Let me have your gun.

888
01:44:33,732 --> 01:44:35,025
Now the shells.

889
01:44:39,362 --> 01:44:41,990
Three. You always carry three.

890
01:44:47,370 --> 01:44:49,080
Throw them out the window.

891
01:44:55,211 --> 01:44:57,797
How do you figure on pulling this off,
Briggs?

892
01:44:57,881 --> 01:45:01,676
l run the investigation, with your record,
l can make anything stick.

893
01:45:02,886 --> 01:45:05,555
What l can't understand is,
why you of all people?

894
01:45:05,722 --> 01:45:08,641
A hundred years ago in this city,
people did the same thing.

895
01:45:08,725 --> 01:45:11,686
History justified the vigilantes,
we're no different.

896
01:45:12,103 --> 01:45:15,690
Anyone who threatens the security
of the people will be executed.

897
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:20,570
-Evil for evil, Harry. Retribution.
-That's just fine.

898
01:45:21,363 --> 01:45:23,156
But how does murder fit in?

899
01:45:23,823 --> 01:45:26,493
When police start becoming
their own executioners...

900
01:45:26,576 --> 01:45:28,661
...where's it gonna end, Briggs?

901
01:45:29,329 --> 01:45:32,332
Pretty soon, you'll start executing people
for jaywalking.

902
01:45:32,415 --> 01:45:35,001
And executing people for traffic violations.

903
01:45:35,377 --> 01:45:39,422
Then you end up executing your neighbor
'cause his dog pisses on your lawn.

904
01:45:40,048 --> 01:45:43,677
There isn't one man we've killed that
didn't deserve what was coming to him.

905
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,096
Yes, there is. Charlie McCoy.

906
01:45:46,513 --> 01:45:48,014
What would you have done?

907
01:45:48,098 --> 01:45:49,641
l'd have upheld the law.

908
01:45:49,724 --> 01:45:52,018
What the hell do you know about the law?

909
01:45:52,102 --> 01:45:53,853
You're a great cop, Harry.

910
01:45:54,104 --> 01:45:57,565
You had a chance to join the team,
but you'd rather stick to the system.

911
01:45:57,649 --> 01:46:01,194
Briggs, l hate the goddamn system.
But until someone comes along...

912
01:46:01,277 --> 01:46:04,114
...with some changes that make sense,
l'll stick with it.

913
01:46:04,781 --> 01:46:06,783
You're about to become extinct.

914
01:46:11,413 --> 01:46:13,123
Get off at the next exit.

915
01:55:18,126 --> 01:55:19,002
Red?

916
01:55:49,866 --> 01:55:50,742
Red?

917
01:58:10,423 --> 01:58:14,219
Briggs was right.
You guys don't have enough experience.

918
01:58:55,051 --> 01:58:57,220
Just hold it right there, Callahan.

919
01:58:59,014 --> 01:59:00,098
No tricks.

920
01:59:12,068 --> 01:59:13,987
Your organization's through, Briggs.

921
01:59:15,572 --> 01:59:18,366
There's a lot more where they came from,
believe me.

922
01:59:18,491 --> 01:59:21,786
Move out of the way. Move it!

923
01:59:49,773 --> 01:59:51,107
Uphold the law.

924
01:59:53,777 --> 01:59:56,780
You just killed three police officers, Harry.

925
02:00:01,159 --> 02:00:03,787
And the only reason
l'm not gonna kill you...

926
02:00:04,287 --> 02:00:07,374
...is because l'm gonna prosecute you
with your own system.

927
02:00:15,632 --> 02:00:17,634
lt'll be my word against yours.

928
02:00:19,177 --> 02:00:21,012
And who's gonna believe you?

929
02:00:21,971 --> 02:00:25,266
You're a killer, Harry. A maniac!

930
02:01:21,948 --> 02:01:24,284
A man's got to know his limitations.

931
