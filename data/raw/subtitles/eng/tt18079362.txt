00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,443
I'’m 75.

171
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:27,055
So, let'’s experience
a super bowl.

172
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,710
Because this might be
our last chance.

173
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:32,539
- God, that'’s morbid.
- Well, we gotta work
with what we got.

174
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:34,715
We'’re gonna do this.
Bring it in.

175
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,249
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Bring it, bring it.

176
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,521
- Yes. Oh, yes.
- Yeah, i'’m in.

177
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:38,719
Super bowl on three.

178
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:42,853
One, two, three.
Super bowl! [Laughs]

179
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,987
Hello, my name is Betty...
Elizabeth bachman.

180
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:49,077
Look, I crunched the numbers
and based on your viewership,

181
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:54,256
my friends and I have
about a .00013% chance here.

182
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,911
So, I realize that
the probability

183
00:07:57,085 --> 00:08:00,131
of me winning this contest is very,
very low...[Betty'’s husband] Honey!

184
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:05,833
But I used to be a professor
of applied mathematics at mit,

185
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,749
back when there were
only two other women
in the whole department,

186
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,534
so i'’m used to
the odds being against me.

187
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,231
Honey?
I have to run to class.

188
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:14,711
Have you seen my watch?

189
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,539
It'’s on the mantel
over the fireplace.

190
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:17,913
You'’re also gonna need pants.

191
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,542
Pants? Oh.

192
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,153
Right.
What would I do without you?

193
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:23,487
I just really need this trip.

194
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,244
Thank you very much.

195
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,379
Oh. What do you think
of my... my paper?

196
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,860
I'’m gonna submit it
to the journal.

197
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:37,342
Look, I love
your principal points, I do,

198
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,910
but the whole paper right now
is rather confusing.

199
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:42,086
And you can'’t expect
people to understand

200
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,525
unless you weave
the concepts together
a bit better and...

201
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:46,830
Pants.

202
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,397
Yep, pants. Right.

203
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,921
Hi. My name is maura,

204
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:54,011
and my friends and I
are die-hard pats fans.

205
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:57,319
Which wasn'’t always the case
growing up in Oregon,

206
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:59,843
where my mother
was a lumberjack... that'’s great,

207
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,453
but if we want
the advantage here,

208
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,281
it has to sound like
a real story.

209
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:06,458
So let'’s keep it believable.
Right?

210
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,504
- All right. Sure, maura.
- Okay.

211
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:10,201
But she really was a lumberjack.

212
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,484
[Resident] Being bullied in
elementary school was hard.

213
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:14,684
And then when
middle school came,
things got much worse.

214
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:16,294
Much, much worse.

215
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:19,559
And my mom started
picking on me too... uh... uh...

216
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,299
Don'’t make it so sad.

217
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:24,955
It'’s about the best story wins,
not the saddest story.

218
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:26,174
Okay?

219
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,089
Thank you.

220
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:29,263
[Resident 2] Hello?

221
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:31,919
Yes.
Uh, my name is maura,

222
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:35,400
and my three friends
and I are dying.
Thank you.

223
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,620
Okay. Bye-bye.

224
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,188
We'’re... we'’re dying
to go to the super bowl.

225
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,669
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

226
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,714
- Oopsie.
- Mmm.

227
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:45,888
Yeah.

228
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:47,891
Hey, maura.

229
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,806
Thank you for including me
in all of this.

230
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,068
This is a lot of fun.

231
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:52,853
Oh, good. [Chuckles]

232
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:55,682
Hey, do you think
you could round up
some more residents?

233
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:59,729
Because some of
these performances
aren'’t helping our odds.

234
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,035
You got it.

235
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,863
Thanks, Mick.

236
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,971
<i>I mean, this guy
is like Caesar. No, he'’s perfect.</i>

237
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,431
<i>And he'’s like genghis Khan.</i>

238
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,783
[Lou] "My friends and I
are die-hard"... no, no.

239
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:15,179
"My best friends and I
are die-hard pats fans.

240
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:19,183
We'’re all ladies over 80

Twenty years ago,
we didn'’t know anything"...

242

No, no, no.

my last round of chemo,</i>

246
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,245
How about some TV?

247
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,550
Mmm.

can'’t change the channels.

Oh, I can do it.

[Announcer continues]

253
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,303
Yeah, it'’s not working.

254
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,436
Remote'’s been acting funny.

255
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,610
I got it.

256

[Announcer]
<i>Shaun Ellis, 92...</i>

[Maura] What do I do?
What do I do?

259
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,922
- Don'’t hit it.
- I already hit it.

260
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,096
[Shouting]
Unplug it.

261
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:04,184
Hold on.

00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:05,510
<i>Two minutes left in this game.</i>

<i>Drew bledsoe is out.</i>

264
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:09,233
<i>They'’re gonna have to go
with their backup qb.</i>

265
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,280
<i>Tom Brady, the second-year
quarterback from
the university of Michigan.</i>

266
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:13,890
Who'’s that?

267
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:16,110
<i>I think anybody could tell
by looking at bledsoe...</i>

268
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,459
He is cute.

269
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:18,808
Oh, i'’ll watch this.

270
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:22,072
I can turn myself down.

[Lou] <i>"Maybe it was luck,
maybe it was destiny,</i>

<i>but at that moment,</i>

274
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:32,256
<i>the patriots'’
backup quarterback
got called off the bench."</i>

275
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,171
[Betty] <i>I think
that has to be so difficult.</i>

276
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,782
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

277
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:37,542
[Lou] <i>"We eventually
got the remote working,</i>

278

<i>and one week of football
became two."</i>

279
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,659
You know, for a game
where a bunch of guys
just smash into each other,

280
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,139
it'’s really very complicated.

281
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,575
There are so many patterns,

282
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,509
and if you analyze the data,
you will find...

283
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,710
We'’re just starting
to enjoy it, Betty.

284
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,189
Don'’t make it about math.

285
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:53,408
Oh. Okay.

302
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,887
<i>We need one for the thumb here.</i>

303
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,170
[Pat] <i>Or you could still try
and buy your tickets online,</i>

304
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,041

You'’re acting very strange, Lou.

317

[Lou] Just keep your eyes shut.

318
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:28,851
Lou, i'’ve got to
get home before dinner.

319
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,505
It'’s craps night.

320
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,028
You'’ve got
your own house, maura.

321

in a retirement center?

Oh! I love presents.
I love presents.

325
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:43,474
- Whoo!
- Oh!

Oh, my gosh.
What is happening?

327
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:47,565
I wanted it to be a surprise,

328
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:50,177

were gender reveal boxes.

No one.

331
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:56,183
It'’s not a gender reveal.
It'’s just a reveal.

332
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,184
Of what?

- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god!
These are tickets.

336
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:05,932
How did that happen?
How did that happen?

337
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:08,978
Teamwork. I just did
what Tommy would do.

338
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:12,155
Who cares how it happened?
We'’re going to the super bowl!

339
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:13,678
Oh, my god![Betty] oh, my god!

340
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,984
[All exclaiming]

341
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:16,899
[Pat]
<i>Welcome back to</i> pats nation.

342
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,336
<i>The super bowl
is only three days away,</i>

343
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,557
<i>and I am more excited
about this than my own wedding.</i>

344
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:25,371
[Nat]
<i>I'’m much more excited about it
than I was about your wedding.</i>

345
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:29,433
[Trish] No, Carl.
I did not agree that
we could see other people.

346
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,131
That'’s not dating.

347
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,873
That'’s cheating,
and i'’m done talking about it.

348
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:37,093
I do not want to talk to you.

349
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,576
[Scoffs] I'’m not interested
in anything you have to say.

350
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,100
Wow, this chapter
is really good.

351
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:45,493
Oh, it'’s so steamy.

352
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,147
No, it'’s not finished.

353
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:50,324
No. Not you, Carl.

354
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:53,196
With you, it is finished.

355
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:56,678
Oh, Lou, I need a hug.

356
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:58,419
[Sniffles] I need a hug.

357
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,249
Oh, baby.

358
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,207
You'’re too good
for that one anyway.

359
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,731
Oh, god. I'’m just...

360
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,910
[Sighs][Chuckles]

361
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,216
Betty'’s right. I-I'’m...

362
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,088
I have to stop falling in love.

363
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:18,091
No. You can fall in love.

364
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:21,311
Just maybe wait till
you'’ve known them
more than a week.

365
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:25,011
Maybe I just stay home.

366
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,490
And mope around? No.

367
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,492
We'’re going to the super bowl

368
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,017
to enjoy men
the way the romans did:

369
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:34,368
Sweaty,
piled on top of one another.

370
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,760
Tight pants.

371
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,155
[Chuckles] Okay.

372
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,117
[Manager] So this one'’s
for your blood pressure.
It says take twice a day.

373
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,032
And this one'’s for you
to go to sleep,

374
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:49,209
so it'’s very important
you only take it
before bed, all right?

375
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,125
I... i'’m sorry. What?

376
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,736
This one is for
your blood pressure.

377
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,564
Twice a day, okay?

378
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,566
And this one
is to help you sleep.

379
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,742
It'’s important
to take sleep seriously.

380
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,006
But only take it
when you'’re ready for bed,
okay? Because... [exhales]

381
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,313
All right, let me know
if you need anything else.

382
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:17,019
Oh, before you leave,
have you finished
making the corrections?

383
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:20,283
Honey, you really need
to take another pass at it.

384
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:23,069
I mean, you need to
add your own voice.

385
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:25,332
Well, you know my voice
better than I do.

386
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:27,508
No, no, no. I Don'’t.
I never did.

387
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,119
- Listen to me.
- Okay.

388
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:31,773
You can do it.

389
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:33,949
Okay. I think so.

390
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,124
Okay.

391
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:40,216
Mind if I come in?

392
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:42,479
I see your bags are packed.

393
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:45,613
So where you headed?

394
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:48,094
Super bowl.

395
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:49,965
- Super bowl. Really?
- Yeah.

396
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,379
- No, you'’re kidding?
- Mm-mmm.

397
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:52,533
Oh, man.

398
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,027
You know,
I used to play football.

399
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:55,183
- High school. Yeah.
- Mmm?

400
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:56,363
I was a wingback.

401
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:58,017
A little undersized,

402
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,280
but the coach always said
I had great feet.

403
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:03,413
My husband always said
that I had great feet.

404
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:06,721
- Mmm.
- But he just
really liked feet.

405
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,679
[Chuckles]

406
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:19,038
[Stammering]
I heard that he passed away.

407
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,561
Was it last year?

408
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,085
- Yeah.
- Oh.

409
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,260
Yeah.

410
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:27,133
My wife, uh,
she passed away too.

411
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:28,786
Oh, i'’m so sorry.

412
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,267
- I'’m so sorry.
- You know,
these things happen.

413
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:34,488
Hey.

414
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:40,276
If you need someone
to accompany you
to the super bowl...

415
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,236
Thank you so much,

416
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,673
but i'’m already
going with friends. Thank you.

417
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:50,417
But, hey, there is a lot
going on in this place

418
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,177
- that you should explore.
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

419
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,594
There'’s... no, really.

420
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,901
There'’s pool aerobics.
There'’s, um...

421
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,121
There'’s dancing.

422
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,210
- There'’s game night.
- Yeah.

423
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:03,995
- Uh, lunch.
- Yeah.

424
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,214
Lately, i'’ve...

425
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:10,176
Been realizing that
it'’s less about what you do,

426
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,570
more about
who you do it with, you know?

427
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:16,660
I look around this place, and...

428
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:25,365
You'’re the only one
I really wanna be around,
you know?

429
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,368
It seems like you got it
all figured out and...

430
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,199
[Snores]

431
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,378
Talking to myself.

432
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:41,294
[Horn honking]

433
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:43,383
Stop honking.
Betty hates it.

434
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:44,949
She thinks it'’s bad manners.

435
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,386
I know.
That'’s why I do it.

436
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,301
[Chuckles][Horn honking]

437
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,583
[Betty] You know,
you didn'’t have to
honk so many times.

438
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,522
One toot is enough.

439
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:54,916
Uh... [sighs]

440
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,179
This trunk is full.

441
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:00,835
Lou, why didn'’t
we take your SUV?

442
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,184
It'’s in the shop.

443
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,968
Don'’t worry, Betty.

444
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,666
This thing has plenty of room.

445
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:08,495
- It'’s a '’93.
- It is? It'’s...

446
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,323
They Don'’t make them
like this anymore.

447
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:12,431
They Don'’t make this model
- like they used to.
- Oh, boy.

448
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:16,459
[Nat]
<i>We are a mere two days away
from the super bowl.</i>

449
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,113
[Pat] <i>Yeah.
Houston better get ready.</i>

450
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,854
<i>I think
they'’re gonna run out of beer.</i>

451
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:21,724
[Lou] Oh![Betty grunts]

452
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:23,118
Tight brakes.

453
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,852
[Trish]
What you want me to do?
Not stop?

454
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:27,818
She'’s not answering.
I'’ve called about ten times.

455
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,211
Here, i'’ll get her.

456
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,039
- It'’s the truth.
- Pacing will not help.

457
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,736
Well, it can'’t hurt.

458
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,910
Afternoon, bill.

459
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,261
Here he is. Here he is.

460
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:36,515
- Hey, ladies.
- Yes. Hello.

461
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:37,853
I'’m sorry.
I went and checked,

462
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:39,221
but maura'’s sleeping.

463
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,091
Please wake her up.

464
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,485
Please just wake her up.

465
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,661
We Don'’t just
wake anyone up here.

466
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,010
It'’s a very strict policy.

467
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,056
It'’s part of
our core philosophy.

468
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,363
We take sleep seriously.

469
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:53,627
See?

470
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,368
Oh! Uh...

471
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,805
Excuse me.

472
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,110
Excuse me.

473
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,200
Excuse me.

474
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,158
Mmm. Mm-mmm.[Lou] oh, damn it.

475
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,421
- Maura! Maura!
- Oh, oh. Ladies. Seriously.

476
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:06,795
- Shh! Please, please.
- Maura!

477
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:08,444
- Okay. Okay, we'’re going.
- Thank you.

478
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:09,868
- We just had a moment.
- Thank you.

479
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,123
You guys are very fast.
That'’s a good sign.

480
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,648
Where'’s maura?

481
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:16,258
She'’s sleeping,

482
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,826
and the manager won'’t let us in
to wake her up.

483
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,089
What do we do?
We'’re gonna miss our flight.

484
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,787
I got it. I came prepared.

485
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,635
There'’s no way
we'’re gonna make it. Where...

486
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:26,790
[Lou] What are you doing?

487
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,491
Are all your suitcases
just wigs?

488
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,669
Let'’s go.

489
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,586
So you still get
the cute little face,

490
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,390
but you Don'’t get
all the breathing problems.

491
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:43,503
Oh, that is fascinating.

492
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,635
Do you have any photos?

493
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,246
Oh, yeah. Sure.

494
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,465
All I have is pug photos.

495
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:51,989
Look at this guy.[Gasps] oh, look at that.

496
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,687
That'’s toffee... uh-huh.

497
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,752
And that'’s Bobby
right there.
Let me show you.

498
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:56,864
Can I take you on a tour?

499
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,648
[Chef talking]

500
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,887
Wow.
- They have a cooking class.
- Wow. Look at that chef.

501
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,498
- Maura was right.
- It'’s emeril in there.

502
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,132
They have
absolutely everything here.

503
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,506
She'’s been wanting me to take
a pottery class with her,

504
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,571
but honestly, I can'’t
see myself throwing a pot.

505
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:12,445
<i>I hope that you feel
like you used your time
with him wisely,</i>

506
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:13,900
<i>because you lied
to him.</i> Excuse me.

507
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,839
Does anyone know

[Whispering]
Wait for the commercial.

510
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:21,584
She'’s in her room.

511
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,456
[Shushing]

512
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,718
Here, i'’ll take you.

513
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:26,372
[Shushing]

514
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:27,808
[Resident] Come on, man.

515
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:29,264
[Betty whispering]
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

516
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,680
- [Lou] Sorry.
- Yeah.

517
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,354
[Mickey] <i>Well,
I think she'’s sleeping.</i>

518
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,641
Well, thanks, um... Mickey.

519
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,251
Look, Mickey,

520
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,993
our flight is leaving
in three hours and 23 minutes.

521
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:41,822
I'’ll, uh...
Okay, well, i'’ll be here.

522
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,693
- I'’ll be right out here.
- Maura?

523
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:46,019
[Mickey] I'’ll just be
- standing guard out here.
- Maura? Oh!

524
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,523
Maura? Maura?

525
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,240
- Honey, I can do this.
- Ma... okay. All right.

526
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:51,048
Maura. [Shouting] Maura!

527
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:53,137
She'’s got a pulse.

528
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,012
- I can'’t read that.
- Sleeping pills.

529
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,014
Oh. Get a wheelchair.

530
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:01,537
- Get a wheelchair.
- Mickey?

531
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:02,843
- Oh, Mickey, good.
- Yeah?

532
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:05,367
Could you possibly
get us a wheelchair?

533
00:22:06,063 --> 00:22:08,022
- A wheelchair?
- Yeah.

534
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:09,676
You'’re breaking her out,
aren'’t you?

535
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,567
Well, no, we'’re actually...
We'’re going...

536
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:14,245
- No, you'’re breaking her out.
- Okay. Yeah.

537
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,118
Well, it figures
that she'’d have
really cool friends.

538
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,424
He'’s getting one.

539
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:21,992
Take these with us.
They belong to her.

540
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,604
- This cash too.
- Well, that...

541
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,578
I'’ll give it to her
- in the car.
- All right.

542
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:28,758
You'’ll witness it.
- You'’ll see it.
- Okay. I'’m witnessing.

543
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:30,382
- [Lou] Is it clear?
- Yeah, it'’s clear.

544
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,741
- Let'’s go. Let'’s go.
- Okay.

545
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,589
- All clear.
- Out of the way.
Out of the way.

546
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,266
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Watch your feet.

547
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:36,790
This way, to the left.

548
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:38,637
- To the left. Go, go, go.
- Here we go. Here we go.

549
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:40,073
[Manager] That was
our deluxe garden suite,

550
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:41,969
but you know
our resort is 60 and over,

551
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:45,973
so you might have to wait
- a few more years to qualify.
- Oh. [Chuckles]

552
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:47,191
Hey!

553
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:49,403
- Go!
- Where are you going?

554
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:50,735
- Stop right there.
- Tony, wait.

555
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:52,044
Do you even care about my dogs?

556
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:53,241
No, I Don'’t.

557
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:55,548
[Mickey] Go. Go. I got you.

558
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,811
[Tony] Hey,
she'’s still sleeping.
Come back. Wait.

559
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:02,685
[On pa] Ladies and gentlemen,
pat sajak from <i>wheel of fortune</i>
is in the house.

560
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:06,167
Pat sajak is here,
and he'’s signing autographs
right now.

561
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,125
- Pat sajak.
- Hey, cecile.
What'’s going on?

562
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,127
Where is the party at, huh?

563
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,621
Oh, what'’s going on? Hey.[Mickey]
there'’s vanna here too.

564
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:16,283
[Lou] Thank you, Mickey.[Betty]
Thank you so much.

565
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:17,613
[Lou] Oh, Trish, there you are.

566
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:18,787
Come on!

567
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:19,963
[Whooping]

568
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:21,530
[Lou] We did it.

569
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:23,924
Whoo![screams]

570
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,015
Wh-what are we celebrating?

571
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:29,829
[Lou] Oh, maura.[Trish] we broke you out.

572
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,410
We'’re going to the super bowl!

573
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,413
[Lou] We'’re going to
- the super bowl!
- What? Oh!

574
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:36,066
[Whooping continues]

575
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,982
[Lou] <i>We'’re going to
the super bowl.</i>

576
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:50,777
[Betty] I'’m starving.[Trish gasps]

577
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:53,388
Let'’s go to a bar.
- I love bars.
- No kidding.

578
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:56,130
We'’re not going to a bar
so you can talk to men.

579
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,741
Lou, I told you
I am not gonna flirt.

580
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:01,178
I know this is a girls trip.

581
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:03,050
Well, maybe i'’ll flirt.

582
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:05,184
I Don'’t think
i'’ve ever flirted
in my whole life.

583
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:08,011
- [Trish] You can do it.
- Okay. Okay.

584
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,278
Hrishi?

585
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,719
You have a nice head.

586
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,895
Why, thank you.

587
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:24,158
- We'’ll work on it.
- Okay.

588
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,551
Yeah.

589
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:27,901
[Elevator dings][Lou] oh, erhan suites.

590
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:30,599
Is this great or what?

591
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:33,080
And it'’s all super bowl themed.

592
00:24:33,254 --> 00:24:35,648
Yeah, but they only
gave us one room.

593
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:37,954
And there'’s no more rooms
in the whole hotel.

594
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:40,348
There'’s no more rooms
in the whole city.

595
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,611
At least this one has two beds.

596
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:43,917
Be appreciative.

597
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,353
Oh, look. There'’s Tom.

598
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,400
Oh, he'’s much bigger
in real life.

599
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:51,402
That'’s just a cardboard him.

600
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:56,756
The real him is
at least twice that size.

601
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,192
Oh, Tom.

602
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,977
Make that pass. Make it.

603
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:03,719
I'’m taking this one.
He'’s cute.

604
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:06,592
Maura! Who did you pick?

605
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:09,682
[Phone ringing]

606
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:10,944
[Groans]

607
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:17,951
- Hi. Hi.
- Mmm?

608
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,387
<i>Hey, mom?</i>

609
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,172
Um, hey, I just got a call
from the hospital

610
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:24,914
saying they'’re trying
to reach you
and you'’re not answering.

611
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:28,265
<i>They called me
as your emergency contact.
Is everything okay?</i>

612
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:31,617
Yes, i'’m fine.
Everything'’s fine.

613
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:34,271
I... I just had some tests done.

614
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:35,838
They'’re calling...

615
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:38,885
To go over them.

616
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,887
[Whispering]
Why are you whispering?

617
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,890
[Lou] <i>I'’m in a hotel room,</i>

618
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:46,066
and the other girls
are sleeping.

619
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,633
<i>W-where are you?</i>

620
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:50,723
Uh, New Hampshire.

621
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:54,074
We took a little trip
to a bed-and-breakfast.

622
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:55,771
<i>Oh, that sounds nice.</i>

623
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:58,339
Um, mom,
call your doctor back. <i>Okay.</i>

624
00:25:58,513 --> 00:25:59,601
Night, sweetie.

625
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,081
All right, love you. Night.

626
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:02,561
Love you.

627
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:12,875
I can'’t sleep.

628
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,269
Me neither. [Chuckles]

629
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,448
I miss frank.

630
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,583
I miss sleeping next to him.

631
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:28,064
Nighttime'’s the worst.

632
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,897
I just lay there, awake,
thinking of him.

633
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:39,249
I feel like
i'’m just living in the past,

634
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:42,383
and I can'’t move on.

635
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:47,040
Maura, you'’re not
living in the past.

636
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:49,782
You'’re right here with us.

637
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:51,740
And we'’re here for you.

638
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:56,005
I love you. [Chuckles]

639
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,007
Oh, I love you.

640
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:06,799
Here, section 138, row 30,
seats four, five, six and seven.

641
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:08,235
They'’re so shiny.

642
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:09,976
Can I hold them?

643
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:13,893
[Trish laughs] Oh![Lou] oh! Uh-oh!

644
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,634
- Caught one.
- We can'’t lose those.

645
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:17,331
- You'’re right.
- Those are gold.

646
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:19,681
Well, clearly, you shouldn'’t
be holding them, then.

647
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:22,095
How many reading glasses
have you gone through this year?

648
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:23,598
That doesn'’t count.

649
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:26,122
Reading glasses
are designed to be lost.

650
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,605
Okay, fine.

651
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,129
Who'’s the most responsible one?

652
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:34,739
Oh!

653
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:36,045
Me.

654
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,264
Okay.

655
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,137
Good thing
I brought my strap-on.

656
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,097
[Trish] Um... [laughs]

657
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:45,378
I Don'’t think
that'’s what it'’s called.

658
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:46,402
Sure it is. Look.

659
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,536
You just strap...

660
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,495
- It on.
- Wow.

661
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,236
That'’s a Fanny pack.

662
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,151
Not if you Don'’t wear it
around your Fanny.

663
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:58,328
If you wear it like this,
it'’s a strap-on.

664
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:00,896
And I will keep them safe.

665
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,463
Okay.

666
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:05,509
Before we head out,
let'’s look at the agenda.

667
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,077
First up, the NFL experience.

668
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,862
Wait a minute,
"agenda" sounds like work.

669
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:11,036
I love a good agenda.

670
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,778
- Let'’s go to a spa.
- No.

671
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:15,563
We didn'’t win these tickets
to go to a spa.

672
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,696
We came here for football.

673
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,568
We'’re going to have
the NFL experience.

674
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:23,092
[Crowd chattering]

675
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:28,402
[Lou] I can'’t believe
we'’re actually here.

676
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:29,969
I can'’t believe it.

677
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:35,801
[Betty] Oh, my gosh.
This place is huge.

678
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:38,020
Look at all the helmets.

679
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:39,892
Oh, oh! I wanna get one
for my grandkids.

680
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,590
[Lou] Oh, this is better
than my wildest dreams.

681
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:43,764
Not mine.

682
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:45,201
This morning, I had a dream

683
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,813
I was going down
the Amazon river on a pickle

684
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:50,380
with my papier-mâché children.

685
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:52,426
There'’s so much here to do.

686
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,994
Yeah, well, you Don'’t need
a brochure to tell you that.

687
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,536
You know what?
I'’ve looked at this.

688
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,258
If we wanna hit all the booths,

689
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,782
we have to average
under five minutes
for each one

690
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:02,523
except, you know, the big...

691
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,178
[Sighs]

692

697
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,547
Oh, I thought you was
waiting on your grandson.

698
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:28,418
Nope, i'’m here to play.

699
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:30,638
Well, good luck, Nana.

700
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,509
I Don'’t want you
to break anything.

701
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:34,990
Hey, you sound confident.

702
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:37,558
Would you like to
place a little wager on it?

703
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:38,864
[Scoffs]

704
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,756
Ten bucks says
she won'’t hit
more than five.

705
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,912
That'’s not a bet.

706
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:46,610
She wins, she gets
your falcons Jersey.

707
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,092
- Deal.
- Deal.

708
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,532
There you go. Okay.

709
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,534
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Blows whistle]

710
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,623
Technically,
we Don'’t allow betting here.

[Brady on pa] <i>Hey, Lou.</i>

712

[Brady] <i>Lou! Look up.</i> Yeah. Let'’s see
how this plays out.

- Oh!
- Hey, when are you
gonna start throwing?

724
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:34,199
- For Pete'’s sake.
- Ma'’am, would you
mind your business?

725
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:36,399
I'’ve never seen anything
like this in my life.

726
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,203
Is there
- a mute button for her?
- Oh, oh, oh!

727
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,099
- Really?
- I am terrified.

728
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:42,555
Seriously, the eld... do you have
anything else to do with your life?

729
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,296
Oh, you'’re killing him.
You'’re killing him.

730
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,061
Ma'’am, you are
stressing me out, okay?

731
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:47,976
Oh, really?
Is it distracting?

732
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,910
- I hope so.
- You dropped your multivitamin.

733
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:51,371
Fancy footwork.
Look at that.

734
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:52,720
Man, that is something.

735
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:53,894
Whoo!

736
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,288
Oh, my... will you back up?

737
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:57,382
- That'’s really unimpressive.
- Oh, my goodness.

738
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:59,335
- Amazing!
- Ma'’am!

739
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:02,034
[Crowd] Six, five, four... she'’s
definitely been day drinking.

740
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,471
That'’s what her problem
is... three, two, one!

741
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:06,647
[Buzzer sounds][Crowd cheers]

742
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:09,868
- You did it! I told you.
- I knew i'’d make it.
I knew.

743
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,260
That was incredible.

744
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:12,934
Yeah, you, uh, you scored
over 20 points,

745
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,587
which means you get
a free super bowl Jersey.

746
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:16,396
I want the Brady.
I want the Brady.

747
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,919
What size are you?

748
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,399
I'’m not wearing that.

749
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:21,567
We can go double or nothing

750
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:22,778
if you want your Jersey back.

751
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,231
But if we win,
you gotta wear that.

752
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:27,059
Fine.

pay for that.

I sell so many copies
of your book.

768
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:05,358
And i'’m a personal fan.

769
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:06,988
You know what?
You guys just go ahead.

770
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,448
I'’m gonna find some barbecue.

Yeah, absolutely.

777
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:23,115
Holidays are
a very sexual time for me.

778
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:25,421
Wow.

779
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:27,336

00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,123
Oh. Hi. Um...

- Really?
- Yeah.

786
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,610
But I must warn you,
it gets really intense.

787
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:43,178
They got spices that sound like
they'’re from a horror film.

788
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:44,875
- Like what?
- California reaper...

789
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,530
Whoa... ghost pepper,
Teddy bears picnic.

790
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:49,228
Now, that one'’s the most scary

791
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,322
'’cause it sounds like
it'’s all warm and cuddly,

792
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:54,537
but it'’s not.
- It'’s really not.
- Oh.

793
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,452
Well, I could use
a little spice.

794
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:57,746
This ain'’t no little spice.

795
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,021
And this is his contest.

796
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:01,891

I mean, look at him.

799
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:06,897
He even looks spicy.

800
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,290
I'’m in.

801
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:10,597
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

802
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,555
I'’m gonna need
your emergency contacts

803
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:15,602
- in case something happens.
- Well, that would be
my husband, Mark.

804
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,865
But Don'’t call him.
Don'’t call him.

805
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,389
[Stammering] I Don'’t want him
knowing I was doing this.

806
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:22,715
If you black out,
you Don'’t want me
to call your husband?

807
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:25,220
- No. Don'’t call him.
- So who do
you want me to call?

808
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,006
An ambulance?

809
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,573
[Cheering]

810
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:39,930
Yay!

811
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:45,110
Ladies and gentlemen!

812

[Crowd cheers]

814
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,900
The rules are simple.

815
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,990
If you Don'’t wanna
clear your seat,
you better handle the heat.

816
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:58,166
You touch the milk, you'’re gone.

817
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,561
Let'’s bring out
the pain train to flavortown.

818
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:04,955
In three, two, one.
Bring the pain.

Oh, my god.

[Fieri]
This is the train to pain.

822
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:17,185
Who can handle the heat?

823
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,795
Hold it together.

824
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,188
Hang in there.

825
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:22,277
Hang in there. Hang in there.

826
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,062
[Crowd exclaims]
Oh! You'’re gone.

827
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:25,324
Go. Go. Go.

828
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,413
Excuse me, Betty?

829
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:30,416
You Don'’t have to
- eat it all.
- It'’s okay. I'’m hungry.

830
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,721
I know her!

831
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:33,636
"And it was then,

that gronk took her,

834
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,905
and she knew

835
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,084
this was the best
a man could get."

836
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,525
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

837
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:55,136
This is all so unexpected.

838
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,834
Uh, if i'’m not mistaken,
Mrs. Ledoux,

839
00:34:58,008 --> 00:34:59,314
you are a multi-hyphenate.

840
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:02,361
Aren'’t you
the original mayflower girl?

841
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:03,666
[Chuckles]
I love your book.

842

Well, that was...
That was a long time ago.

846
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:17,332
Oh, my god. That ring.

847
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:20,292
Oh, my god. The fingernails.

848
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,947
Football nails.
- You'’ve got two rings.
- Yep.

849
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,037
I have to assume
- you... you played.
- I did.

850
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:29,170
Two super bowls.
Two different teams.

851
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:32,608
So, do I just call you
the mayflower girl?

852
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:33,827
Patricia.

853
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:35,370
- [Fan] Love your book.
- Thank you.

854
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:36,588
- Saved our marriage.
- Thanks.

855
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:38,048
Wait a minute, not Virginia?

856
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:42,531
Uh, Virginia ledoux
was the name of my poodle.

857
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:46,231
Well, your poodle
must have a real thing
for football players.

858
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:47,449
No.

859
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:49,973
I do.

860
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,236
Ladies and gentlemen,

861
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,151
here we are
at the pinnacle of pain,

862
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:54,674
the temple of heat.

863
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:56,415
Our final round,

864
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,982
dal versus Betty.

865
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:01,855
Dal, how you feeling, bud?

866
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:03,949
I'’m feeling great,
guy... all right. Great, dal.

867
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:05,424
And, Betty, everything okay?

868
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:06,860
Yeah, i'’m just getting ready.

869
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,818
All right.
Remember, embrace the spice.

870
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:11,560
Lean into this. Don'’t fight it.
It only makes it harder.

871
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:13,301
- Okay.
- You go big or you go home.

872
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:14,998
- Okay.
- All right.

873
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,785
All right.
For this final round,
Satan'’s tongue.

874
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,656
The most difficult wing we have.

875
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,964
And we'’re going
on three, two, one.

876
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:25,879
Bring the heat!

877
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:29,056
Dal gets a nice portion.
So does Betty.

878
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,363
Dal with one...
Dal with one bite.

879
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:33,495
Betty with two.

880
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:35,062
Dal?

881
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,455
Dal'’s not looking good.

882
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:38,544
Dal'’s shaking.
Betty has another bite.

883
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,502
Dal spits. Dal'’s out!

884
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:43,070
Give it up for our champ, Betty!

885
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:45,464
Oh, well...
[Chuckles]

886
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:48,530
[Fieri] Ladies and gentlemen,
your champ, Betty!

887
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:50,686
Betty, how'’d you pull that off?

888
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,906
That one had a...
[Coughs] ...Bit of a kick.

889
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,647
A b... listen,

890
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:56,973
it was amazing to watch you
knock that out of the park.

891
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:58,128
How did you do this?

892
00:36:58,303 --> 00:36:59,826
How do you handle
spice at this level?

893
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:02,437
I Don'’t know.

894
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:05,832
Unless it has extreme flavor,
I can'’t taste anything anymore.

895
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:07,286
Well, speaking of
extreme flavor,

896
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,314
I got some brisket
you gotta try.

897
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:12,404
- Can I bring my friends?
- Absolutely!
You'’re the champ!

898
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:14,101
Give it up for champ Betty!

899
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,794
Maura, would you like
some more brisket?

900
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:20,716
Oh, I could eat your brisket
all day long, you brute.

901
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,588
There you go. There you go.

902
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:23,806
Mmm! Mmm!

903
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,243
It'’s so good.

904
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,593
- Ah!
- Trish!

905
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:28,898
- Oh, hi.
- Trish!

906
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:30,204
Are you guy fieri?

907
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:32,250
Of course he is.
Where have you been?

908
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:33,531
I'’ve been talking to a fan,

909
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:34,904
and he invited us to a party.

910
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,645
- Look.
- A fan?

911
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:38,125
A fan of my writing.

912
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:40,736
Also a two-time
super bowl champion.

913
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,042
Trish.

914
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:44,000
I didn'’t flirt.
I mean, he did.

915
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:46,873
Don'’t you think
we should rest before
the big game tomorrow?

916
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:48,483
Wait. If it'’s that party,

917
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:50,297
oh, you go...
It'’s gonna be off the hook.

918
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:52,052
I'’m going to that party.

919
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:54,266
Yeah. I mean, he'’s right.
Look, we'’re not playing.

920
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:58,121
I thought the whole point
of this trip was having
an adventure together.

921
00:37:58,145 --> 00:37:59,320
This is an adventure.

922
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:00,539
I'’m there.

923
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:02,018
Will there be dancing?

924
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:03,803
If you'’re going,
there'’ll be dancing.

925
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:08,590
- Oh, gosh. Betty?
- Yes?

926
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:10,684
Betty, Betty, Betty.
Let me just check your lips.

927
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:12,420
Oh.

928
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:14,857
You,
- who never wear lipstick.
- Uh-huh.

929
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:16,946
Okay, good.
- Don'’t lick your lips.
- All right.

930
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,296
Let me see your beauty Mark.

931
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,862
- Very good.
- Come on. Let'’s go.

932
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:22,038
Okay. Hot stuff.[Chuckles]

933
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,041
Are we gonna be
the oldest people here?

934
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:27,696
[Trish] Betty,
Don'’t reinforce stereotypes.

935
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,916
Oh, there'’s Dan. Dan!

936
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,311
You have a fan named Dan?

937
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:34,834
Yeah, Dan o'’callahan.

938
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,357
Hey, come on up!

939
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:37,358
I thought you said
you'’ve been working out.

940
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:38,620
[Guest] I have.

941
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:40,230
How many leg days
have you skipped?

942
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:41,928
Look at those chicken legs.

943
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:44,452
That'’s mean.
He'’s got great legs.

944
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:47,150
Oh, it'’s called "negging."
It'’s how we flirt.

945
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,240
[Betty] Why would you focus
- on negative things?
- Can you let them up?

946
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:52,175
Oh, he'’s getting us
in.[Bouncer] sorry, ladies.

947
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,046
[Trish] You know, he used to
- play for the pats.
- Sorry.

948
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,768
It is so great to meet you all.

949
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,552
Dan.
You played for the pats?

950
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,162
- I did. For three years.
- Wow.

951
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,556
But I spent most of my time
with the raiders.

952
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,730
Hmm.

953
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:03,863
Okay.

954
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:06,300
You look lovely.

955
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:07,475
Thank you.

956
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,325
Well, hey, I wanna
introduce you to
some of my friends.

957
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,437
Come on inside.

958
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,047
Where'’s maura?
Where'’s maura?

959
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:16,242
Oh, oh, oh. Come on, maura.
We gotta stick together.

960
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,386
Christ'’s sake.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Excuse us.

961
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,575
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
- It'’s too bad.

962
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:22,403
- Bye. Thanks a lot.
- You are gentlemen.

963
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,033
I really appreciate it.[Betty] come on.

964
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:25,275
[Smooth jazz playing]

965
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,016
[Lou] Where did Trish go?

966
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,237
Wow. I have never been
to a party like this.

967
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,415
The only parties we go to
are faculty parties

968
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:36,461
where they just
have cheap champagne.

969
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:39,246
Last party I went to
was a funeral.

970
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:41,770
It was fun.

971
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:43,424
I bet they'’ve got
tons of drugs here.

972
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:44,598
Piles of cocaine.

973
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,122
I bet they even have

974
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,176
one of those <i>eyes wide shut</i>
sex rooms somewhere,

975
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:49,691
Don'’t you think?

976
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:51,693
You know, i'’m gonna
head back to the hotel.

977
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:53,826
- I... I need to relax.
- Here.

978
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,697
Oh, thank you.

979
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:58,004
Who are you?

980
00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:00,485
Oh, we met outside.
Yes, this is... Sophie.

981
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,704
- Sophie. Oh, this is Sophie.
- Yeah.

982
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:04,445
What a lovely name.

983
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,578
That'’s my granddaughter'’s name,
- Sophie.
- Mmm!

984
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:08,231
Just a wonderful name.

985
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,798
- These are good.
- Very good.

986
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:11,372
Well, careful.
They'’re high dosage.

987
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:13,280
- What?
- High dosage?

988
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,630
- [Sophie] Yeah.
- Are they drugs?

989
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:18,633
Yeah. You said
you wanted to relax.

990
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,200
Mmm.

991
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:21,636
What... Sophie!

992
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,464
Say, Sophie!

993
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:24,789
[Betty]
Lou, where are you going?

994
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:26,989
I ate two of '’em. Two gummies.

995
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:29,252
[Maura] What'’ll happen
if I had three?

996
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:32,517
Your friend drugged us.

997
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:34,867
Big deal. You used to
smoke pot all the time.

998
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,259
That was medicinal.

999
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,828
All right. Okay.
We did it. We took drugs.

1000
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:42,614
But let'’s just,
you know, enjoy it.

1001
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:44,224
I'’m going back to the hotel.

1002
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:45,747
I need my ticket.

1003
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:47,096
I'’ve gotta get some sleep

1004
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,794
so i'’m fresh
for the game tomorrow,

1005
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:49,969
which is why we'’re here.

1006
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:55,278
Unless you two are so hungover
you can'’t join me.

1007
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,412
Gimme the ticket.

1008
00:40:58,586 --> 00:40:59,718
Oh, god. Wait.

1009
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,328
I left it at the hotel,
didn'’t I?

1010
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:02,938
I took it off at the...

1011
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:04,418
God, no, I didn'’t. I didn'’t.

1012
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:06,507
I took it off at
the spicy wings contest.

1013
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:07,801
I... I put it down on the...

1014
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:09,292
You'’ve lost the tickets?

1015
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,294
No, I was trying to pretend
it wasn'’t spicy,

1016
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,069
and it was

1193

What happened to the tickets?

I know.

1207

Are you gonna do
the whole thing?

1357
00:56:25,686 --> 00:56:28,341
I had a humongous thing for you
when I was about ten.

1358
00:56:28,515 --> 00:56:30,299
All right.
- Too much. Too much.
- Thank you.

1359
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:32,519
That'’s very kind. Thank you.

1360
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:34,608
Actually, I need your help.

1361
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:36,662
See, my friend won
the tickets at your giveaway,

1362
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:38,395
and now we'’ve lost them.

1363
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:39,787
Uh... I Don'’t...

1364
00:56:39,961 --> 00:56:41,417
Your... your friend
won the ticket giveaway?

1365
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:43,095
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, I Don'’t...

1366
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:46,011
'’cause these guys
won the tickets.[Pat] yeah.

1367
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:47,012
They won the tickets?

1368
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:48,361
Yeah.[nat] uh-huh.

1369
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:50,276
That'’s the Tom Brady
support group.

1370
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:51,669
They support Tom Brady?

1371
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:54,585
No. They'’re all men
named Tom Brady

1372
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:56,238
who formed a support group

1373
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,260
because they'’re never gonna
live up to that name.

1374
00:56:58,284 --> 00:56:59,677
Are they even pats fans?

1375
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:01,766
They'’re conflicted
about it, let'’s say.

1376
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,613
They seem reluctantly
- like they'’re supporting '’em.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1377
00:57:03,637 --> 00:57:04,943
Yeah. They came.

1378
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:07,032
[Phone ringing]
Oh.

1379
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:08,903
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1380
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:12,429
Hi, sweetie.

1381
00:57:12,603 --> 00:57:14,363
[Mark]
<i>Okay, I was trying not to
bother you too much,</i>

1382
00:57:14,387 --> 00:57:15,954
<i>but, uh, which one?</i>

1383
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:17,303
What?

1384
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:19,218
I sent you an e-mail
with two options.

1385
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:20,392
A or b?

1386
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,177
What are you talking about?

1387
00:57:22,351 --> 00:57:23,527
<i>My paper.</i>

1388
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:25,877
Oh. Oh, I didn'’t read it.

1389
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:28,880
Are... are you close
to a computer?
Can you find a kinko'’s?

1390
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:30,751
No. No, I...

1391
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:32,666
I am not going to read it.

1392
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,148
Well, are you just hungry?

1393
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:38,063
<i>No, for god'’s sakes, Mark.</i>

1394
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:41,370
I'’m not hungry.
I'’m at the super bowl
with my friends.

1395
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:43,503
<i>But this is really important.</i>

1396
00:57:43,677 --> 00:57:46,985
[Sighs] To you it is.
To you. Not to me.

1397
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:50,467
Honestly, it'’s your paper
with your name on it.

1398
00:57:50,641 --> 00:57:52,294
You have to make the decisions.

1399
00:57:56,385 --> 00:57:57,778
Mark, are you still there?

1400
00:57:59,954 --> 00:58:01,390
Yeah.

1401
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:02,566
<i>Listen.</i>

1402
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:04,785
<i>Honey, I...</i>

1403
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:06,799
I have made a lot of sacrifices
over the years,

1404
00:58:06,918 --> 00:58:10,225
and i'’m not saying I wish
I could change any of that.

1405
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:14,012
I'’m just saying just because
I can solve a problem

1406
00:58:14,186 --> 00:58:16,405
does not mean I should have to.

1407
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:19,452
Okay.

1408
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:23,935
I love our life.

1409
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:26,154
I love our kids
and our grandkids.

1410
00:58:26,764 --> 00:58:27,765
I love you.

1411
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:31,116
I love you too.

1412
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,814
<i>I'’m sorry. Have a great time.</i>

1413
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:34,989
Okay.

1414
00:58:35,163 --> 00:58:36,382
<i>Okay.</i> okay.

1415
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:42,040
[Exclaims]

1416
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,871
Found it! I found it!
I found it! I found it!

1417
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:50,004
What can I get for you?[Chuckles] oh, is...
Is guy here?

1418
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:51,963
- Oh, damn. It'’s you.
- Hi.

1419
00:58:52,137 --> 00:58:53,834
- How are you?
- Good.

1420
00:58:54,008 --> 00:58:55,270
How'’s your bowels?

1421
00:58:55,444 --> 00:58:57,621
That'’s none
- of your business.
- Okay.

1422
00:58:57,795 --> 00:58:59,144
I haven'’t seen guy in a while.

1423
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:00,638
I think he might be
in the office.

1424
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:02,016
Where'’s the office?

1425
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:06,499
[Attendant] Good luck.

1426
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:08,153
Mr. Fieri.

1427
00:59:08,327 --> 00:59:10,634
Mr. Fieri? Mr. Fieri...

1428
00:59:10,808 --> 00:59:13,158
- [Occupant] Oh, hi.
- Oh, god. Sorry.

1429
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:14,812
Mr. Fieri?

1430
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:16,553
Mr. Fieri?

1431
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:17,728
Mr. Fieri?

1432
00:59:18,729 --> 00:59:20,034
Guy!

1433
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,296
[Fieri] Yeah?

1434
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:23,298
Oh, thank god. Thank god.

1435
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:26,432
Mr. Fieri, i'’m sorry,
I think you have my strap-on.

1436
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:28,129
Hang... hang on a second.

1437
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:31,045
Oh. Oh, thank god.

1438
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:32,307
Oh, Betty, it'’s you.

1439
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:33,641
I was expecting someone else.

1440
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,789
No. I think
you have my strap-on.

1441
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:39,445
You know, I took off
during the competition.

1442
00:59:42,274 --> 00:59:43,405
- Your Fanny pack.
- Yes.

1443
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,494
- Your Fanny pack.
- Yes. It went this way.

1444
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:49,281
So you Don'’t have any tickets
to get into the actual game?

1445
00:59:49,455 --> 00:59:51,544
No. No,
the tickets are lost.

1446
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:53,328
Did you try the lost and found?

1447
00:59:53,502 --> 00:59:55,243
- No, no. Where is that?
- Okay.

1448
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:56,941
Um...

1449
00:59:57,115 --> 00:59:59,639
I Don'’t know,
- actually, where that is.
- Oh, g...

1450
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:02,076
There'’s got to be some way.

1451
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:05,340
If you Don'’t have the tickets,
then you Don'’t have a... [groans]

1452
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:07,212
[Brady]
<i>It'’s one of those moments</i>

1453
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:09,040
<i>where all the work
that you put in</i>

1454
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:10,408
<i>has brought you to this moment.</i>

1455
01:00:10,432 --> 01:00:11,695
<i>And it'’s okay to be behind,</i>

1456
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:13,149
<i>'’cause you gotta
remind yourself</i>

1457
01:00:13,261 --> 01:00:14,785
<i>that it'’s all gonna work out.</i>

1458
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:17,309
No, Tom. I Don'’t think
it'’s going to work out.

1459
01:00:17,483 --> 01:00:18,919
They'’re not going to let us in.

1460
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:21,748
<i>Lou, whenever i'’m down,</i>

1461
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:23,271
<i>I say to myself,</i>

1462
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:26,710
<i>"this is going to be
an amazing comeback.</i>

1463
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:28,668
<i>When we come back from this,</i>

1464
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:31,540
<i>this is going to be
a defining moment in my life."</i>

1465
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:34,413
<i>You have to shift your mind
to think that way.</i>

1466
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:35,893
<i>It'’s empowering.</i>

1467
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:37,242
<i>Say it.</i>

1468
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:39,766
<i>This is going to work out.</i>

1469
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:43,204
This is gonna work out.

1470
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:45,163
<i>Come on, Lou.
Like you mean it.</i>

1471
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:47,121
<i>This is going to work out.</i>

1472
01:00:47,295 --> 01:00:50,124
This is gonna work out!

1473
01:00:53,562 --> 01:00:55,042
- Lou! Lou!
- Oh, my god.

1474
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:56,653
I found them!
I found them.

1475
01:00:56,827 --> 01:00:59,351
We got the tickets!
We got the tickets![Shouts]

1476
01:00:59,525 --> 01:01:01,068
- We got the tickets.
- You got the tickets.

1477
01:01:01,092 --> 01:01:02,267
- I got '’em.
- Oh, my god!

1478
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:04,008
- I got '’em!
- Oh, my god!

1479
01:01:04,182 --> 01:01:06,203
[Betty] Oh,
- we got to go in now.
- Isn'’t that great?

1480
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:08,316
Now. Come on.
- Let'’s go.
- Yeah, great. Oh, my god.

1481
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,859
Games, everybody.
Everybody have a ticket?

1482
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:11,483
- Everybody take their ticket.
- Come on.

1483
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:14,018
We'’ve got our tickets.
We'’ve got our tickets.

1484
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:17,151
Oh, my god. This is it.

1485
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,112
- We did it.
- We did do this.

1486
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:23,680
[Security] Next. Come on.

1487
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:26,465
- Hi, welcome.
- Hi.

1488
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:28,206
[Machine beeps]

1489
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,251
Oh. Uh...

1490
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:33,167
Are you guys all together?
This is... [machine beeps]

1491
01:01:33,341 --> 01:01:35,213
These aren'’t... these...

1492
01:01:35,387 --> 01:01:37,547
I'’m sorry, these all
aren'’t super bowl tickets, so...

1493
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,478
Yes, those are our tickets.

1494
01:01:39,652 --> 01:01:41,630
That'’s great, but
they'’re not super bowl tickets.

1495
01:01:41,654 --> 01:01:43,482
Chip,
- I got another one here.
- Comin'’.

1496
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:45,266
Hot one.[Chip] let me see.

1497
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,486
Four.[groans]

1498
01:01:48,617 --> 01:01:50,619
- Yep, they'’re fake.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1499
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:52,970
You see, ladies,
the official tickets
have a hologram

1500
01:01:53,144 --> 01:01:55,189
that lights up under uv light.

1501
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:57,496
These do not.
You'’ve been scammed.

1502
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,281
Well, that'’s not possible.
We won them in a contest.

1503
01:02:00,455 --> 01:02:01,761
No, we didn'’t.

1504
01:02:01,935 --> 01:02:03,110
Lou, tell '’em.

1505
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,944
I never won the contest.

1506
01:02:11,118 --> 01:02:13,686
A whole bunch
of Tom Brady wannabes did.

1507
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,732
How'’d you get the tickets?

1508
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:18,212
I bought them online.

1509
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:23,522
I maxed out a credit card,
and I sold my car to carmax.

1510
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:27,004
Oh, Lou, why would you do that?

1511
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:33,010
I wanted to have one last
unforgettable experience

1512
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:35,839
before it was too late.

1513
01:02:36,013 --> 01:02:38,232
Hey, little ladies,
i'’m gonna need you
to move aside.

1514
01:02:38,406 --> 01:02:40,036
We gotta let other people
through the gate.

1515
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,801
Well, you can start by
letting us through.

1516
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:43,672
- Oh, you'’re not getting in.
- Oh!

1517
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:46,066
Wha... [Trish] Oh.

1518
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,740
When you do a double,
- they get thick.
- I got you.

1519
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,884
[Whispers]
Let'’s make a run.

1520
01:02:48,982 --> 01:02:49,982
- Whoa. No.
- Hey. Wait.

1521
01:02:50,114 --> 01:02:52,203
- Maura. No.
- Come on, ma'’am.

<i>Let'’s hear it for
our super bowl superfans!</i>

1690

<i>My goodness,
I wish I had those hips.</i>

1691
01:11:02,214 --> 01:11:04,869
Not on me, not on my watch!

1692
01:11:05,043 --> 01:11:06,914
Never been so...
- Sit down.
- Tom, spank me.

1693
01:11:07,088 --> 01:11:09,787
Right here. Spank me here,
Tom.[Betty] Oh, no. Get, get...

1694
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:13,530
Sit down. Oh, my god.
I'’m so embarrassed.

1695
01:11:13,704 --> 01:11:15,706
The falcons have no business
being in this contest.

1696
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,099
[Nat] <i>I mean,
it'’s gonna be a bloodbath.</i>

Get him! Get him!</i>

1698

<i>Damn it!</i>

1699
01:11:22,103 --> 01:11:23,951

Let'’s go.

1704
01:11:31,243 --> 01:11:33,506
Out of the seats. Now.

1705
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:36,466
Come on.

1706
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,555
Let'’s go, golden girls.
Let'’s do this.

1707
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:41,253
Now, I Don'’t know how you ladies
got into this stadium,

1708
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:43,081
but I know
how you'’re getting out.

1709
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:44,255
Chip.

1710
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:45,343
Oh, god.

1711
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:46,476
Trish?

1712
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:48,259
Dan.

1713
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:50,001
I saw you on the jumbotron.

1714
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:51,611
You weren'’t answering my texts.

1715
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:55,180
I was... I was very preoccupied.

1716
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:56,616
Dan o'’callahan?

1717
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,531
[Chuckles]

1718
01:11:58,705 --> 01:12:01,491
When you caught
that 90-yard touchdown
pass against the oilers!

1719
01:12:01,665 --> 01:12:02,883
Poetry.

1720
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:05,625
I mean, devastating for me
as an oilers fan

1721
01:12:05,799 --> 01:12:07,497
- but poetry.
- Thank you.

1722
01:12:07,671 --> 01:12:09,847
- Dan, he'’s kicking us out.
- What?

1723
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:11,718
Well, yeah.
They Don'’t have tickets.

1724
01:12:11,892 --> 01:12:13,633
Well, they'’re in the box
with me.

1725
01:12:15,026 --> 01:12:16,157
See you, chip.

1726
01:12:20,248 --> 01:12:21,293
Ready?

1727
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:27,430
[Gasps]

1728
01:12:30,868 --> 01:12:31,956
Wow.

1729
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,437
This is how
people watch football?

1730
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:36,221
This is heaven.

1731
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:38,658
I know.
It'’s called a skybox.

1732
01:12:38,832 --> 01:12:40,965
I'’m sorry I was angry with you

1733
01:12:41,139 --> 01:12:44,490
for hooking up with him
in that broom closet.

1734
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:46,013
I'’m glad you did.

1735
01:12:46,187 --> 01:12:47,188
We were just kissing.

1736
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,408
Come on.
Let'’s see the view.

1737
01:12:50,627 --> 01:12:52,498
[Betty] Maybe this is heaven.

1738
01:12:52,672 --> 01:12:54,239
Oh, look at this.

1739
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:56,435
You get such a great sense
of the whole field from up here.

1740
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:58,635
You can see everything.

1741
01:12:58,809 --> 01:12:59,940
Exactly. Hey.

1742
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:02,334
You see that box
right across the way?

1743
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,834
That'’s the coordinator'’s booth.[Lou]
that'’s where they call the plays.

1744
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:07,774
Wait, you mean
those guys are talking
directly to Tom Brady?

1745
01:13:07,948 --> 01:13:09,950
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, what a dream.

1746
01:13:10,124 --> 01:13:11,430
Hey, grab a seat.

1747
01:13:11,604 --> 01:13:13,693
Let me know
- if you need anything.
- Yeah.

1748
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:19,569
Dan, i'’m sorry
I didn'’t call you back.

1749
01:13:19,743 --> 01:13:21,266
It'’s just...

1750
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,183
Sometimes I have a tendency
to go too quickly, you know?

1751
01:13:25,357 --> 01:13:27,054
That'’s okay. I get it.

1752
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:29,796
There'’s no pressure.

1753
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:32,799
Let'’s spend some time together,
see what happens.

1754
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:37,413
[Phone ringing]

1755
01:13:38,805 --> 01:13:40,851
Hey, Mickey. <i>Hey.</i>

1756
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:42,809
Um, listen.

1757
01:13:42,983 --> 01:13:45,183
Some people around here,
they'’ve been asking about you.

1758
01:13:45,246 --> 01:13:48,336
Some are under the impression
that you'’ve been kidnapped,
you know,

1759
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,904
so they questioned me
for about three hours.

1760
01:13:51,078 --> 01:13:53,254
Of course, i'’m no snitch,
you know that.

1761
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,995
Thank you.
That'’s really nice,

1762
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:57,345
but I Don'’t want
anybody to worry.

1763
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,260
You can be a snitch.
Go ahead.

1764
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,045
Okay. [Chuckles]

1765
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:03,003
<i>So, when are you coming back?</i>

1766
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:04,497
<i>Some of the residents
around here,</i>

1767
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:08,008
they'’ve been, uh,
been eyeing your room.

1768
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:10,228
You know, i'’ve been
trying to keep them away,

1769
01:14:10,402 --> 01:14:12,186
but they'’re like vultures,
you know?

1770
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:14,928
You know what, Mickey?

1771
01:14:16,364 --> 01:14:17,627
Tell them they can have it.

1772
01:14:18,845 --> 01:14:20,543
Does that mean you'’re leaving?

1773
01:14:20,717 --> 01:14:22,414
<i>I'’m moving back to my house,</i>

1774
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:24,938
<i>but you can come over
whenever you want.</i>

1775
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:26,592
Oh.

1776
01:14:29,073 --> 01:14:30,161
Yeah. Sure.

1777
01:14:30,335 --> 01:14:31,467
<i>Go pats, huh?</i>

1778
01:14:31,641 --> 01:14:33,120
Go pats! [Chuckles]

1779

still 0-7, falcons leading.</i>

<i>And...</i>

1781
01:14:38,386 --> 01:14:39,786
[Groans]
<i>That'’s not gonna do it.</i>

1782
01:14:41,651 --> 01:14:44,741
Hey, what do you think
a box like this costs?

1783
01:14:44,915 --> 01:14:46,743
245,000.

1784
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:48,135
[Chuckling] No.

1785
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:49,833
- You wanna bet?
- Yeah.

1786
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:52,270
What kind of buffoon
would spend all that money?

1787
01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:54,533
Me.

1788
01:14:56,013 --> 01:14:57,014
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

1789
01:14:57,188 --> 01:14:59,059
Well, thank you for having me.

1790
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:01,801
Well, I Don'’t know who you are,
but i'’m glad you could make it.

1791

something really inspiring

- right now.
- I hope so.

One play and then
you got momentum
and then...

Well, it'’s just
the third quarter.

1820
01:16:18,356 --> 01:16:20,053
They could still come back.

for your loss, ladies.

No.[chuckles]

1825
01:16:28,192 --> 01:16:29,712
Do you know
what the patriots'’ chances

1826
01:16:29,846 --> 01:16:31,238
of pulling this one out are?

1827
01:16:31,978 --> 01:16:33,545
- One percent?
- Close.

1828
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:36,374
They have
a .7% chance of winning.

1829
01:16:36,548 --> 01:16:39,116
I still think
they can pull it out.

1830
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:41,814

I wouldn'’t bet on it.

I'’m gonna do something
about it.

You can stay here

how my super bowl ends.

in the third quarter,

- A lot. It'’s a lot.
- Yeah.

It is not looking good,
- pats nation.
- No.

1847
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,873
We gotta find a way
to get the ball
in the end zone.

1848
01:17:41,047 --> 01:17:43,167
We got no choice but to stay
in our two-minute offense

1849
01:17:43,267 --> 01:17:45,269
for the rest of the game.
We got no time left.

I'’m your biggest fan.

I Don'’t know if this is
the right time to talk.

1877
01:18:47,548 --> 01:18:52,292
Sixteen years ago,
I was in the middle of chemo,

1878
01:18:52,466 --> 01:18:55,513
feeling like I was done,
like I had nothing more in me.

1879
01:18:55,687 --> 01:18:57,515
And then you came on the TV,

1880
01:18:57,689 --> 01:19:00,692
fearless, determined,
a skinny little rookie.

1881
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:02,999
Watching you play that season

1882
01:19:03,173 --> 01:19:05,566
gave me something extra
to look forward to.

1883
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,178
Each week,
I found strength in that,

1884
01:19:08,352 --> 01:19:10,397
and that strength got me
through my treatments.

1885
01:19:10,571 --> 01:19:13,183
But that was 16 years ago,

1886
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:14,924
and i'’ve enjoyed
every moment since.

1887
01:19:15,098 --> 01:19:17,970
And i'’m sure you enjoyed
winning all those super bowls.

1888
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:22,105
But that was the past,
and we can'’t live in the past.

1889
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:25,586
No matter how good
or how bad it was.

1890
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:29,112
Right now
we have this one moment,

1891
01:19:29,286 --> 01:19:31,679
and you'’re down
in this game, a lot.

1892
01:19:31,854 --> 01:19:33,899
But you'’re Tom Brady.

1893
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:35,771
You have to come back.

1894
01:19:35,945 --> 01:19:37,294
That'’s what you do best.

1895
01:19:37,468 --> 01:19:39,513
And I love you
because you are the best.

1896
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:42,778
And anyone who doesn'’t
love you respects you

1897
01:19:42,952 --> 01:19:45,171
because you fight
and you never give up.

1898
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,481
So i'’m not giving up either.

I Don'’t know
what'’s ahead for me,

1901

and they'’ve got momentum.

it'’ll be the greatest comeback
in NFL history.

Oh, my god.

1913
01:20:54,023 --> 01:20:55,372
Actually, in '’93,

the bills came back
from a much larger deficit,

1915

but who'’s talking statistics?

01:20:59,463 --> 01:21:01,247
Betty, what are you doing?
Come on.

1917
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:06,383
All right. That just
puts us two touchdowns

1918
01:21:06,557 --> 01:21:09,995
and two two-point
- conversions away.
- And two... yeah.

1919
01:21:10,169 --> 01:21:12,955
Yeah, exactly. Two touchdowns
and two... so that'’s doable.

That'’s all they gotta do.

- Oh, my god.

Lou, how much
did you spend on this?

Mmm. A lot.

2029
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,120
I might be able
to help with that.

01:27:36,294 --> 01:27:37,774
What do you mean?

2031
01:27:37,948 --> 01:27:40,167
In the third quarter,
I made a bet with that rich guy

2032
01:27:40,342 --> 01:27:42,431
that the pats would
come back and win.

2033

A lot.

2035
01:27:46,435 --> 01:27:49,699
But he didn'’t have
enough cash on him,
so the poor guy...

2036

anybody'’s ever said to me.

I'’m sure they say that
to you all the time.

meant the world to me.

this game of football,

2086
01:30:21,764 --> 01:30:23,983
and it'’s taught me so much.

And people say all the time,
"you inspire me," and...

2088

It'’s just a game.

2089

how tough you are,

2090

Wow.

Could we do a Jersey swap?

- This Jersey for your Jersey?
- Yeah.

2098

And it'’s all sweaty
- and everything?
- It'’s got a lot of sweat on it.

2099
01:31:04,154 --> 01:31:06,330
- All right. I can do it.
- Yes.

2100
01:31:06,504 --> 01:31:09,202
That one is...
I'’ve never had anything
with the sequins like that.

Where is my Jersey?

2102
01:31:12,554 --> 01:31:13,816

you can send it to me.

I took a sabbatical

to work.

to retire if you feel
like you still got it.
