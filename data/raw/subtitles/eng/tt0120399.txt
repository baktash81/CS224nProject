Hey!

35
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,983
Hello?

36
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,486
Hello!

37
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,283
Who cut off my music?

38
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,707
You cut my music off.

39
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,960
- You Harlin?
- No. Darrell.

40
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,504
- Is Harlin around?
- I doubt it. He's dead.

41
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,132
- Do you own this place?
- Yep.

42
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,137
Why they call it "Harlin's"?

43
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,719
'Cause Harlin used to own it.

44
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,769
Could you take a look at my car?
I think the radiator hose is busted.

45
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,773
All right.

46
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,396
I think it's gonna be another hot one today.

47
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,895
'Course, then again, it might not be.
You can't ever tell around here.

48
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,238
When it's hot, I don't like to get out of bed.
'Course, when it's cold, I don't either.

49
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,236
- Look, Harlin. I got...
- It's Darrell.

50
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:14,788
Whatever. Could you just take a look at
the radiator hose? I think it's busted.

51
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,588
It's your radiator hose.
It's busted.

52
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,800
I know that.
What'd I just tell you?

53
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,381
If you know so damn much,
why didn't you just fix it yourself?

54
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,888
If I could do that, you think I'd
be standin' here wastin' my time?

55
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,721
- Can you fix it? Or do I have to go someplace else?
- Someplace else?

56
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,769
Bud, someplace else is 50 miles from here.

57
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:41,073
That old station downtown-- that thing closed--
must've been, God, 3 years ago or somethin' like that.

58
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,070
Okay. I'm stuck. Ya happy?
Now can you fix it or not?

59
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,784
- Yeah, I can fix it.
- Great. Great.

60
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:52,115
I'll have to look through the yard here,
see if I can't find a hose like that one.

61
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,963
- It's gonna take a little time.
- How much time?

62
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,289
I don't know.
You know, time.

63
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,085
What time is it now?
About 20 after 10:00.

64
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,010
Arizona.

65
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,335
- Twenty after 10:00. It's gotta be 90 already.
- It's 92.

66
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,099
- What happened to your hand anyhow?
- An accident.

67
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:17,601
Accident?
You got to be more careful, bud.

68
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,647
See, hands is important.
Lemme show you somethin'.

69
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,071
Don't know if you can still see it.
When I was a kid--

70
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:27,401
Real interesting, but i-is there someplace in
this dust bowl I can get somethin' to drink?

71
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:31,118
- There's a diner down there. That ain't much.
- This way?

72
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,950
Us simple folk like it.
You know.

73
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,996
I'll be back in a couple hours.
Just be real careful with it, all right?

74
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,293
Hey!

75
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,128
- It's just a car.
- No, it's not just a car.

76
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,304
It's '64-and-a-half Mustang convertible.

77

122
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,854
- I'm just goin' to my car.
- Well, that's right on my way.

123
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,147
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.

124
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:38,534
I'm Bobby. See? Now we're not strangers.
See how easy that was, beautiful?

125
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,244
- Do you have to call me that?
- Well, I don't know your name.

126
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,196
Maybe I don't want you to.

127
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,996
Maybe you wouldn't have stopped walking if you didn't.

128
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,213
- You're pretty full of yourself.
- I like that about me. You?

129
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,844
- It's Grace.
- Grace, can I carry your package?

130
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,299
- Oh, geez.
- Sure you can manage?

131
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,967
- Uh, yeah.
- You want me to carry your pack for you?

132
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,466
No. No.
It's no trouble.

133
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,729
What happened to your hand?

134
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,851
An accident.

135
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,858
You should be more careful.

136
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,440
It's just some drapes and curtain rods.

137
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,907
Just got so tired of the old ones.
Had 'em long as I can remember.

138
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,910
My mother made 'em.

139
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,832
Saw 'em and just knew I had to have 'em.

140
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,711
Ever see somethin' and just knew you had to have it?

141
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,709
Yes, I have.

142
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,671
This is it.

143
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,261
- Thank you, Bobby.
- Ah, you're welcome, Grace.

144
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,090
- You're not from around here, are you?
- I just drove in this morning.

145
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,348
My car overheated up the road.

146
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,020
Lucky it didn't happen out in the desert.

147
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,269
Day like today, you'd be dead in no time.

148
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,016
When are you leaving?

149
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,030
Not until I get my car back.
<i>Who knows how long that'll take?</i>

150
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,454
And here I made you all hot and sweaty.

151
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,578
- Mornin', Grace.
- Mornin', Sheriff.

152
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,209
Got my drapes.
It's about time.

153
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,245
I see you got yourself a helper too.

154
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,379
Mornin', Sheriff.

155
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,643
Nice to meet you, son.

156
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,845
Same to you, Sheriff.

157
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,693
I could use some help gettin' these boxes in the house.

158
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,990
You could shower,

159
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,494
get somethin' cool to drink.

160
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,405
You're still lucky.

161
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,388
Where are you coming from?

162
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,349
Oh, all over.
Detroit, Chicago, Miami.

163
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,351
I gotta stop in Las Vegas.
I got unfinished business there.

164
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,854
- So, what is it you do?
- Whatever pays best.

165
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,068
A little bartending.
Used to teach tennis.

166
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,948
Used to play some competitively.

167
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,291
I never played tennis.

168
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,869
Enough excuses.

169
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,700
I'm sick of your bullshit!

170
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:16,825
Easy. Easy.
Bobby, I want my money.

171
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,996
- I want my money!
- You're gonna get your money.

172
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,545
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this.

173
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,420
You have two weeks, asshole.

174
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,797
Take two for now.

175
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,024
Finger one!

176
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,612
Ahh! Finger two.

177
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,726
Thought you might like some more lemonade.

178
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,727
That'd be great.

179
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,525
What do you do anyway?

180
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,576
Little of this, little of that.

181
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,504
Mostly I tell fortune.

182
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,540
Where'd you learn that?

183
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,174
From my father.

184
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,257
Come here.

185
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,530
Down.

186
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,580
There's something in your past.

187
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,078
Something.

188
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,089
There's a pain.

189
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,302
There's something you want very badly.

190
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,756
It seem very far away to you right now.

191
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,097
But you're determined.

192
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,346
You're determined...

193
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,438
and you'll do what you must to get it.

194
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,032
You can tell all that by my face?

195
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,449
It tell me what every face tell me.

196
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,952
Everybody have a past.

197
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,445
They have pain, and they have something they want.

198
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,325
What is it you want?

199
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,837
The same thing you do.

200
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,635
Really?

201
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,470
I wanna hang drapes.

202
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,278
Can you hold me?

203
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,054
Tighter.
I won't break.

204
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,679
There. Lift me down.

205
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,556
You could put me down now.
I'm safe.

206
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,414
I'm tired of hangin' drapes.

207
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,866
Now what should we do?

208
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,208
Well, I got an idea.

209
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,460
What would that be?

210
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,851
All right, Grace, no more games.

211
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,021
And what game you wanna play?

212
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,810
You carry my boxes for me and I fall into bed with you?

213
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,806
I think I can find my own way back into town.

214
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,189
Maybe I like to know about a man first.

215
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,026
Maybe I like to find out what he's made of.

216
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,072
Thanks for the lemonade.

217
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,202
You still didn't answer my question.

218
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,624
- Still playin'.
- What is it you want?

219
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,855
- Grace!
- Jake!

220
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,869
I thought you were in Phoenix.

221
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,042
Who the hell is this?

222
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,830
- Who in the hell are you?
- I'm her husband.

223
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,171
Hu-- Husband?

224
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,549
Now who are you? It better be good or,
God help me, I'm gonna break you in half.

225
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,873
Whoa, whoa. Easy, chief.
I was just helping up your wife.

226
00:21:02,874 --> 00:21:05,434
We met in town. I was givin' her
a hand with the drapes. That's all.

227
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,774
- Doesn't look like you were hangin' drapes.
- That's all that happened, I swear.

228
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,940
- I know what that means.
- Grace, tell him.

229
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:14,210
Damn it, Grace!
Tell him!

230
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:16,636
And I suppose you didn't have
anything to do with it, Grace.

231
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,612
He just wandered up here hisself!

232
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,364
I got a mind to put you over my
knee and paddle your ass raw!

233
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,447
Is that what this is about?
You sucker me up here...

234
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,454
so the two of us can beat
the shit out of each other over you?

235
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,868
Forget it.

236
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,381
You don't just walk in here and walk out.

237
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,264
- You broke my nose!
- Ohh, it ain't broke.

238
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,803
Get goin', pip squeak.

239
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,677
What the fuck do you want?

240
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:38,108
I'll give you a lift. It's too hot to be walkin'.
People die out here, you know.

241
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,530
You're not still upset over that little love tap, are ya?

242
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,690
Come on, lad.
Come on. Get in.

243
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,666
- Say, what happened to your hand?
- Accident.

244
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,301
Accident?
Oh, you gotta be more careful.

245
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,550
I guess we've never been introduced proper.
Jake McKenna.

246
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,554
Bobby Cooper.

247
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:11,846
Oh, Bobby Cooper, huh?
What brings you to Superior, Bobby?

248
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,482
Car overheated.

249
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,229
Darrell takin' good care of ya, is he?

250
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,362
Darrell's dumb as a sack of hammers.

251
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,069
Yeah, he sure is a character.

252
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,900
♪ I'm losin' my blues ♪

253
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,856
Where ya headed?
California.

254
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,868
Oh, California.
You live there?

255
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,580
No, got work.
Man with a boat wants me to sail it for him.

256
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,912
Oh, you a sailor man, are ya?

257
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:42,418
Oh, that'd be the life, huh?
Just get on a boat and sail away.

258
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,264
You know, a man could pretty well disappear like that.

259
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,090
- McKenna, about your wife-- if I'd known she was married--
- Married?

260
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:52,256
Nah. Wouldn't have made a difference to you.
Not a whit. You know why?

261
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,267
- Because you're a man without scruples.
- Hey, man.

262
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,890
Oh, I can smell it on ya.

263
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,558
- Hey!
- Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,857
That's the sweat of a man that
hasn't an honest bone in his body.

265
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,613
Now don't be offended, lad.

266
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:13,197
A man who's got no ethics is a free man.
Do as he pleases. I envy ya that.

267
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,785
Besides, a woman with her looks and a man of my age--
I mean, what was I to expect?

268
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,253
Women. Can't live with 'em;
can't live without 'em.

269
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,799
Can't live with 'em;
can't shoot 'em.

270
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,340
Can't shoot 'em.

271
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:36,182
I betcha she just had ya hard as a rock,
just wigglin' her ass in your face.

272
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:40,096
I bet you just wanted to pull
her pants down and hog her out.

273
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:44,107
And then I come bustin' in like a wild bear.
I can tell you got a temper on ya.

274
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,151
I bet you just wanted to snap her neck, huh?

275
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,815
I bet ya just wanted to kill her.

276
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,202
- Would ya?
- Would I-- Would I what?

277
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,907
Would ya kill her?

278
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,745
Why would I kill her?
Because I--

279
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:09,506
I'm just sick and tired of her goddamn little games.
Because you could do it, goddamn it.

280
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,801
You could do it and drift away on that
boat and no one'd ever see you again.

281
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,927
I got a $50,000 life insurance policy.

282
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,475
I would be happy to give the man who
does her in a good chunk of it.

283
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,190
- McKenna, I done some things. I'm not a murderer.
- <i>Oh.</i>

284
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:29,146
Oh, yeah.
Well, how do you know if you never tried, huh?

285
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:33,696
It's a joke.
You're tryin' to rattle me. Right?

286
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,495
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
That's right.

287
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,670
<i>It's nothin' but a joke.
That's all. Enjoy your stay, lad.</i>

288
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,106
No.

289
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,066
- Aw, man.
- Gimme a soda.

290
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,026
- Mmm?
- Got a soda?

291
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,197
Hablar slowly, por favor.

292
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,327
- A cold soda.
- Oh! Something to eat?

293
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,535
- Have it.
- No. No. Drink.

294
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,401
Old lady, keep it in and nobody gets hurt.
Same goes for you punk.

295
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,974
- Now give me the money.
- Dinero, señora. ¡Dámelo!

296
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,268
Come on.

297
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,148
Come on!

298
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:52,113
That's it?
Lady, I got kids to put through school.

299
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:56,203
- This is all I have.
- You're next, pal. What do you got?

300
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,619
Come on.

301
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,373
Beautiful. Beautiful.
You are gettin' tasty.

302
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,707
Now gimme the pack.

303
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:13,344
- Just books.
- Well, I'm a reader. Toss it.

304
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,593
- It's personal things. F-Family things.
- Gimme the bag.

305
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,219
No.

306
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,265
- No?
- This is not good, man. Come on.

307
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,430
- No?
- ¡Señor! ¡Señor!

308
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,648
- No?
- Señor, por favor. Leave him the bag.

309
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,649
- He doesn't wanna give me the bag?
- ¡Señor! Oh, no!

310
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:35,192
- He doesn't have to give me the bag.
- Forget it, man. Come on!

00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,251
Well, your bottom hose is shot too.
Rotted clean through.

337
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,376
I put a new one in there.
Runs like a dream now.

338
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,972
How much?
Uh, well.

339
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,313
Let's see.
You got parts and labor.

340
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,139
Let's just call it, uh, 150 bucks.

341
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,231
How much?

342
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,733
- Well, $150.
- To replace a goddamn radiator hose?

343
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,437
A goddamn radiator hose in a 1964-and-a-half Mustang.

344
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,948
- <i>Do you know how long--</i>
- It's not a Ferrari. It's a goddamn Ford!

345
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:30,081
It's not just a Ford.
It's a 1964-and-a-half Mustang.

346
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,581
What's that got to do with a radiator hose?

347
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,584
I don't know,

348
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,956
but it's the reason that I'm livin'
here and you're just passin' through.

349
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,995
Now you owe me 150 bucks.

350
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,524
I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I got.

351
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,480
Why don't you just, uh, get your
American Express Gold Card out there.

352
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,984
- <i>Call the guy on TV with the big schnoz.</i>
- I don't have a credit card.

353
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,697
I hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit.
You're gonna have to work this off man.

354
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,699
Look, I got a Movado.

355
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,582
It's worth $7,800.
You could sell it for that.

356
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,963
Well, shit, sell it to who?
I can't see no numbers.

357
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:22,422
There don't have to be numbers on it.
That's why it's expensive. Look at the gold.

358
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:26,505
No day. No date. Shit.
As far as I can tell, this ain't worth a duck's fart.

359
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:32,513
Lookee here. I got that one for $3.75, and it's
got every doodad you can ever imagine on it.

360
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,349
I believe I'll just stick with it.

361
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,345
You son of a bitch!

362
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,728
My lawyer will shut you down.

363
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,565
You ain't got no credit cards, but you got a lawyer?

364
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:48,531
Listen, you can sweet talk me all
you want to, but didn't you read this sign?

365
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,741
What fucking sign?

366
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,486
- I want my car!
- I want my $150.

367
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,717
7311. This is Pluto.
What's the line on Dallas?

368
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,552
<i>Lose my fuckin' number, will ya?
Ya fuckin' deadbeat.</i>

369
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,769
- Mike, you ass--
- <i>Mike who?</i>

370
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,599
Cici. Cici, it's Bobby.

371
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,096
- <i>Bobby?</i>
- Bobby Cooper.

372
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,109
- <i>Been a long time.</i>
- I know. It's been a while.

373
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,441
I'm in a jam.
And you need money?

374
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,736
- Yeah. 150 bucks.
- <i>I'm not givin' you shit. You stole my CDs.</i>

375
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:33,281
- I did not steal your CDs!
- <i>Who took 'em? My ex-roommate who you fucked?</i>

376
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:37,538
Okay, where's my Mr. Coffee?
Cici?

377
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,212
- Rosarita. Bobby.
- <i>Fuck you.</i>

378
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,550
Mom?

379
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,552
- Who is this?
- It's Bobby.

380
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,554
- Bobby who?
- Your son.

381
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,796
- He's dead.
- No. This is me. I'm not dead.

382
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,138
- You are to me!
- Mom!

383
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,604
Hello?

384
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,896
Mr. Arkady.
This is the deadbeat Cooper calling.

385
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,979
Motherfucker's calling collect.

386
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,450
Bobby. What a surprise. I expected to be
seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.

387
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,155
Mr. Arkady, what a day I've had.

388
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:23,456
I mean-- I know I'm coming up with what's
gonna sound like a highly improbable story,

389
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,463
but I had the money, I swear.

390
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:30,585
I had it. I'm on my way to Vegas and my car
breaks down in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

391
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:35,425
So now I've got your money, and I go into
this little grocery store in this hick town,

392
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,893
you know, to get somethin' to eat,

393
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,104
and the place gets robbed.

394
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,644
Let me guess.
This robber gets your money?

395
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,479
Two. There were two of them,
and they both get nailed.

396
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,185
The old lady shot 'em...
with a shotgun.

397
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,526
- Old lady?
- <i>Right? She kills 'em both.</i>

398
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:56,161
<i>The money's in my bag, and it gets shredded
into bloody pieces. Not one bill's left alive.</i>

399
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,292
I mean...
what are the odds?

400
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,080
<i>So I was wondering--
Uh, uh, there's a--</i>

401
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:07,456
<i>I-I thought maybe you could--</i> you could wire me
$150 so I can get my car out of the garage.

402
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,665
'Course, I'd pay it back with the rest.

403
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,966
Which you don't have.
But which I could get.

404
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,470
That's no problem.
I can sell my car in Vegas.

405
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,182
Where are you?

406
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:24,022
Uh, in this little shit hole 200 miles east of Phoenix.

407
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,153
It's Superior.

408
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,320
- Superior.
- Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

409
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,032
S-So maybe you could, you know, send it care of me here.

410
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:39,413
You listen to me, ya deadbeat little punk!
I don't care if you got hit by a truck...

411
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,754
and run over by a steamroller.

412
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,409
You owe me $13,000, and I want it!

413
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,209
And I don't fucking care how you get it or where from.

414
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:51,593
I want it on my desk tomorrow or I'll
show you what the real bad luck is.

415
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,552
- Do you understand me, ya little punk?
- You know what? Fuck you too.

416
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,894
What?
What did you say to me?

417
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,929
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm really... I'm s--

418
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:03,183
Listen. Listen. There's just been so much stress.
I got so much strain.

419
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,517
Bobby, you owed me that bread four weeks ago.

420
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,694
<i>Now you tell me you want another week. Five.</i>
That's five weeks, Bobby.

421
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,355
<i>That's also five fingers.</i>
You and I know that's a finger a week!

422

<i>Now, you come here tomorrow and you talk to me real nice,</i>

for a quarter for the jukebox.
- Girl, shut your mouth.

477
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,220
Look here, mister. You and me, we got a
little man's business to take care of.

time with your girl. Okay?

00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,063
Toby, go finish your pop and leave that man alone.

00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,854
Don't you never mind, Flo.
Okay?

494
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,189
This gonna be over real quick.
Don't worry.

495
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,568
"One Touch" Toby.
Come on, pussy.

496
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,870
You're real lucky this time, but don't you think it's over.

499
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:34,599
- What was that all about?
- Toby thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.

500
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:38,852
Yeah, it's more like Jenny's after every man she sees.

501
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,606

- It's the desert.

502
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:48,781
I mean, people out here in the desert
just go bonkers for some damn reason.

I was hopin' we could talk.

00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,924
- 'Bout what?
- About your wife.

525
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,507
About what you said this mornin'.

526
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,343
You took a life insurance policy on her...
$50,000--

527
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,016
and you'd cut it up with the man that killed her.

528
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,770
Oh, boy, I think this heat's gettin'
to you, the way you're ramblin' on.

529
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:30,324
You're the one that brought it up...
in your car this morning.

530
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:34,279
- A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
- <i>You meant it.</i>

531
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,281
What makes you say that?

532
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:41,033
'Cause you're a slimy bastard who'd have his
wife killed to get his hands on some money.

533
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,948
What does that make you?

534
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,537
The slimy bastard that's gonna do it.

535
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,630
I think you're a jealous man, Jake.

536
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:54,630
If you can't have Grace to yourself-
You're not the sharing kind.

537
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:02,061
I have what you call, uh,
a love-hate relationship with Grace.

538
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,059
You love her, but you hate her.

539
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,811
No, I hate lovin' her.

540
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,104
I hate havin' to tolerate the little games she plays.

541
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:15,899
Like fuckin' half this town behind my
back and laughin' at me! The bitch!

542
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,606
She wants me to hit her, and when I hit her, she likes it!

543
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,828
She just likes to fuckin' torture me.
Goddamn it!

544
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,871
But she's--

545
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,878
She's my family.

546
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,465
She's my little girl.

547
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,262
My baby.

548
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:49,267
I couldn't stand to watch her
eyes roll back in her head...

549
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,649
as she sucks her last breath.

550
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,113
No. Not me.

551
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,276
But you,

552
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,617
you boy, you got a killin' in you.

553
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,043
Okay. Let's say I want the bitch dead.

554
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,590
What is it you want?

555
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,594
How do you put a price on murder?

556
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:25,676
Oh, well, uh, you know, I put it at, uh, $50,000,

557
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,684
minus your cut, of course--
which is?

558
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,057
- Twenty.
- Twenty thousand? No.

559
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:37,227
No, no, no. I don't have that kind of money.
I mean, you know,

560
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,487
I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.

561
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:45,241
- How much can you get?
- Oh, uh, maybe, uh, $10,000?

562
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,235
That's a maybe.
I need thirteen.

563
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,828
Thirteen?
That's a bit much.

564
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:55,084
We're not talkin' about buyin' a car, Jake.
We're talkin' about killin' your wife.

565
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,089
Now it's 13 or it's nothin'.

566
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,772
Well, you drive a hard bargain.

567
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,647
But I had a feeling you were my boy when I first met ya.

568
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,566
Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.

569
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,582
Do we shake hands?

570
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:34,462
Well, if you can't trust the man
you've hired to kill your wife--

571
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,586
Now here's the thing:

572
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,710
It's gotta look like an accident.

573
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,048
If it don't, it's no good.

574
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:48,054
'Cause I won't get a dime, and it'll be
my neck that's on the choppin' block...

575
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,558
while you're livin' it up somewhere.

576
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,101
How do you want it?

577
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,444
It can't be done at the house.

578
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,732
- It should be, uh--
- We should talk about some money up front.

579
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,397
Oh, sure.

580
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,317
Why don't I buy you a plane ticket
right outta here while I'm at it?

581
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,327
Oh, I know you.

582
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,500
Here's what you do.

583
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,080
You go to the house to see her.

584
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,496
- And tell her what?
- I don't know. Tell her you had to see her.

585
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,956
You know, sweet talk the woman.

586
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:26,468
A young buck like you must be good like that.

587
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,682
And then, maybe, shift the conversation,

588
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:32,142
get her thinkin' about that Jeep of hers,
'cause she loves that thing.

589
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,814
Maybe the only thing she does love.

590
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:39,943
She'll wanna take you for a ride out in the desert--
someplace quiet, someplace deserted.

591
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,823
Ridin' through the red rocks and the mesas.
She loves it out there.

592
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,702
So do I.
I guess we got that in common.

593
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,990
There won't be anybody around for
miles except the two of you--

594
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,076
except prairie dogs, that's all.

595
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,711
And then maybe, uh--

596
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:01,210
Well, you can sweet talk her a little if you like.
It makes no difference to me.

597
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,545
Put her at ease. Make her feel relaxed.
And then, uh,

598
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,091
do it.

599
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,311
You could leave him.

600
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,733
It's not that easy.

601
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,057
Walk away.

602
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,819
Maybe you can take chances.

603
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,532
You can wander around like some stray wherever you please.

604
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,663
I can't.

605
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,868
I don't wanna be alone.

606
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,206
I wish I was a bird.

607
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,006
Some of the old people on the reservation...

608
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,266
used to think people could actually change into animals.

609
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,891
I wish I could.

610
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:04,858
If I was a bird, I would fly to Florida--
Disney World.

611
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,032
I always wanted to go there.

612
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,197
And I'll fly to New York, maybe.

613
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:21,956
I'd fly to St. Louis and all over Texas.

614
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,382
Then I'd fly to California.

615
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,220
Then I guess I would've seen it all.

616
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,103
Then I could die.

617
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,568
They say you don't feel anything--

618
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,739
that the shock kill you before you hit the ground.

619
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,081
I've always imagined it's just like flying.

620
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,613
Mmm.

621
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,951
I bet right now...

622
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,249
you don't know if you wanna kill me...

623
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,883
or fuck me.

624
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:51,519
No! No, stop.
I can't. Stop it.

625
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,608
Stop. No!
I can't.

626
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,744
What's the matter, Grace?

627
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,282
- Nothing.
- Doesn't feel like nothin'.

628
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,370
You should just get outta town, Bobby, quick as you can.

629
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:15,923
Don't do this to me, Grace.
I've been fucked over by too many women.

630
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,054
You're becomin' the queen of hot and cold.

631
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:24,063
It's such a mess.
With Jake, I mean.

632
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,731
There's nothin' I know more about than a mess.

633
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:41,244
Jake was with my mom...
after my real father died.

634
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,884
Used to call me his little half-breed.

635
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,424
Kept my mom on the side, you know?

636
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,296
'Cause he had a wife someplace else.

637
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,429
He controlled me.

638
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,604
You look so pretty.

639
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,821
- Would ya put your arms-- Your head--
- No!

640
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,784
Don't fuck around on me like your mama.

641
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,775
Oh!

642
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,868
He was raping me the whole time.

643
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,664
For years.

644
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,669
My mom--

645
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,594
It tore her up 'cause she couldn't do nothin' about it.

646
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,900
She become alcoholic.

647
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,359
They found my mama right down here.

648
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,077
At the bottom of Apache Leap.

649
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:11,497
And Virgil--

650
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,501
Sheriff Potter...

651
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,383
He said she was drunk and went insane.

652
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,711
But I never believed she ran off that cliff by accident.

653
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,929
She was like me.

654
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,102
She just wanted to fly away.

655
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,941
I'm so sorry.

656
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,151
Whatcha gonna do?
Life, right?

657
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,447
You ever been to California?

658
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,833
Yeah.

659
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,830
Is it pretty?

660
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,044
It's another world.

661
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,382
There's beautiful beaches.
Blue water.

662
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,309
Clear sky as far as the eye can see.

663
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,559
Take me with you.

664
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,481
- Grace, I wish I could.
- Please? I won't hang on you.

665
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,941
- You could dump me as soon as we get there.
- Grace. Grace.

666
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:20,152
- I just wanna get outta here.
- I can't even get outta here.

667
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:24,823
I need 150 bucks to get my car
back from that crazy mechanic.

668
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:28,284
- Darrell? You know, he and Jake--
- Do you-- Do you have money?

669
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,450
Jake never give me more than 20 bucks at a time.

670
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,332
If you could get money,

671
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,498
I'd get us outta here.

672
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,416
There's money.

673
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,836
A lot.
Where?

674
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,888
Jake--

675
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,845
he hides it...

676
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:58,564
in a safe in the bedroom in the floor.

677
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:02,016
My mom said there more than $100,000 in there.

678
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:07,703
- In cash?
- There nothin' else with Jake.

679
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:12,701
He sits there, he laugh, he talk
to himself and he counts it.

680
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,826
$100,000.

681
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,542
Son of a bitch.

682
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,535
What you mean?

683
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,591
Well, if it's in a safe, we need the combination.

684
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,635
It take a key.

685
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,562
And he keep it on him all the time.

686
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,523
It's always slappin' up against me when we do it.

687
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:45,648
If he's got the key on him all time, how do we get it?

688
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,738
Kill him.

689
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:03,205
N-- Uh, Grace,
I-I can't kill anybody.

690
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,424
It not like he a young man, Bobby.

691
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,255
He had time to live.

692
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:12,011
It would be quick.
He don't even have to feel it.

693
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,351
Look, just sometime in the middle of the night.

694
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,939
You could just come up behind him...
when he's asleep...

695
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,941
or when he's poundin' on me.

696
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,233
You could just...
Oh, geez!

697
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,277
Bobby! Bobby!

698
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:35,619
I see it. It's in you! I see it in you.
I see death. It's in your heart.

699
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,122
Let it go for me.
Do it for me, Bobby!

700
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,624
I'll do anything for you!
Take me back to town.

701
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:44,457
You need the money, Bobby!
How you gonna get outta here?

702
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:49,594
It's three mile back to town.
There's more than $100,000. A lot more.

703
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,224
Where you going?

704
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,663
No!

705
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,840
Get back here right now!

706
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,201
Bobby.

707
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,553
Hey, you there! Hey!

708
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,471
They're cursed.
They're cursed.

709
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:21,773
All the miners last century killed
off the Indians at the mine.

710
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,889
Earth ran red with blood.

711
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,647
I seen some peculiar things on a hot day.

712
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:31,569
I seen a scorpion sting itself to death.
A little killer killing itself.

713
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:35,201
I seen a coyote kill itself too.
Bite and tear its own legs.

714
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,370
Nearly tore one clean off before it bled to death.

715
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,739
So, what a white man is gonna do--

716
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,117
White man is gonna get himself killed just,

717
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,464
just... rubbing shoulders with another, you know.

718
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,331
- You know.
- Kissy, kissy.

719
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:53,009
Nice little pussy. Little pussy there.
You see it coming.

720
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,759
And that's gonna be the death of him.

721
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,757
Sure see a lot for a blind man.

722
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:04,267
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes don't mean I can't see.
I can see pretty good.

723
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,770
That's 'cause we're all just eyes in the same head.

724
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,774
Everything is everything.

725
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,607
- What?
- Everything is nothing too.

726
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:19,784
Yeah, well, maybe one day I'll have
time to sit on a corner and spout wise.

727
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,616
Think you're gonna live that long,
cocksuckin' motherfucker?

728
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,538
Everybody's got a mother.
You know that?

729
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,285
Can't they understand you don't rip up the mother?

730
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:34,207
The Mother Earth. And you just take everything.
It's like the Cracker Jack box.

731
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,047
The more you eat, the more you want.

732
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,223
I got things to do.

733
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:42,552
You got something to do?
Well, don't see me stopping you.

734
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,429
But ain't you got a little something for the infirmed?

735
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:50,266
I'm a little short today, old man.
I'll catch you next time.

736
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:54,475
Ah. Your lies are old,
but you tell them pretty good.

737
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,454
Hey, mister?

738
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,536
Patsy Cline.
Hey.

739
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:11,172
- Mister, I just wanted to thank you.
- For what?

740
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,670
For defendin' my honor this afternoon.

741
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,673
I hate to bust your bubble, but
I wasn't defending your honor.

742
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,796
- Yeah, but you was gonna fight for me.
- No.

743
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:22,844
I wasn't gonna fight for you.
I was gonna beat the shit out of your boyfriend.

744
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:27,679
He ain't my boyfriend. I let him take me
out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.

745
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,687
Not yet, that is.

746
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,439
Get this through your head, little girl:
I ain't goin' for ya.

747
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:37,572
And if this guy Toby likes you, marry him
'cause you're not gonna do better in this town.

748
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,362
Well, that's what I thought until you came ridin' in.

749
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:45,076
I saw your car over at the gas station.
That's a cool car.

750
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,989
You wanna take me for a ride?
Desert's kinda lonely this time of day.

751
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,079
I-I don't wanna take you for a ride.

752
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,245
I just want... Hey.

753
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:56,174
You don't have 150 bucks that I--

754
01:01:56,254 --> 01:02:00,054
- You wouldn't have 150 bucks that I--
- Mister!

755
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,643
- Oh, shit.
- That's right. You better be scared.

756
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,720
I told you it wasn't over. Now I find you
sneakin' around with my girl behind my back!

757
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,056
I'm not sneakin' around with your girlfriend.
Will you tell him?

758
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:12,142
- What the fuck you doin', then?
- You're too late, Toby. We're gonna get in his fancy car...

759
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,728
- ...and ride off and leave you behind.
- What are you talking about?

760
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:19,275
- What's your name, anyway?
- That tears it, mister.

761
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,610
I'm gonna bust you up but good!

762
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,106
I'm-I'm gonna take you and break
you up into a million pieces,

763
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,095
and take those pieces and break them in a million more!

764
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,539
You don't even know what you're dealin' with.
I'm crazy! I'm psycho-crazy!

765
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,710
I know. You're T.N.T., and when
you go off, somebody gets hurt.

766
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,710
That's right.
Okay.

767
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:37,672
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you
beat him up and knock out all his teeth,

768
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,264
and he's just droolin' and bleedin' all over hisself,

769
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:43,759
'cause we love each other, and we're gonna
run off, and I'm gonna have his love child!

770
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:47,433
- Would you shut up!
- <i>You're gonna pay for that, mister.</i>

771
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,433
You're gonna pay.
Come on.

772
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:53,095
- Toby!
- Oh. Hey, Sheriff Potter.

773
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:56,476
Toby, I just come from your mama's place.
She's worried sick about you.

774
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,864
Says she ain't seen you since this morning.

775
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:02,941
No, no, that-that just ain't true, Sheriff.
I-I was just home for lunch.

776
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:07,949
Boy! I don't wanna see nothing but smoke
comin' out of your ass on your way home.

777
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,954
Yes, sir.
Come on, girl.

778
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:14,746
Bye, mister! Don't go nowhere without me!
I wanna have your love child!

779
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:21,093
Where you goin'?

780
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:24,132
Up to Harlin's.
Get in.

781
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,611
You know, there was a young fella up at
Jamilla's place today when it got hit.

782
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:46,363
Now the way she tells it,

783
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:49,317
he got whacked around pretty good by one of them robbers.

784
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:52,238
I wish I could help you, Sheriff, but...

785
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:57,751
I just wanna get up to Harlin's and
get out of town as quick as I can.

786
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,546
That's a nasty cut you got there.

787
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:08,548
Well, I fell on a rock.
It's not as bad as it looks.

788
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,175
Everything all right, Virg?

789
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:19,188
Oh, yeah. Just fine.
Where you goin'?

790
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,522
Get somethin' at Darrell's.

791
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:26,568
So, how's the wife?
That little Eskimo baby walkin' yet?

792
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,954
Yeah.
Yeah, just fine.

793
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,622
- Fine, huh? Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

794
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,793
You haven't seen my wife, have you?

795
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,460
I'm lookin' for her.

796
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,633
No, I haven't seen her, Jake.

797
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,377
If I do, I'll sure tell her you're lookin' for her.

798
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,467
Yeah.

799
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:55,386
What you got there, some trash?

800
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,110
Kinda peculiar how things happen, ain't it?

801
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,566
I mean, a man's car breaks down.

802
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:15,697
There's a robbery.
People get killed.

803
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,906
All that money.

804
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:22,334
Now--

805
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:30,843
Now old Jake is out lookin' for his young wife.

806
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,177
Then you show up.

807
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,770
Time's runnin' out, son.

808
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,363
I'll be seein' you in the mornin'.

809
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,059
Hey, there, bud.

810
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,062
I was startin' to think you wasn't comin' back.

811
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,151
One of them days when you feel like
you're running around in circles,

812
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:31,994
and you ain't no closer to where you was
tryin' to get than when you started.

813
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,241
- You been there, huh?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

814
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,623
When you feel like that,

815
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,491
don't think there's anything else
you can do 'cept tough it out.

816
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:44,458
- You believe that?
- You think bad, then bad's what you get.

817
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,422
That's a pretty decent philosophy you got there.

818
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,923
Well, no charge.

819
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,756
Hey, Darrell,

820
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,802
about the 150 bucks--
Two hundred.

821
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:59,557
Next town I get to, I'll send it.
I swear to God.

822
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,560
Two hundred.
What?

823
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:05,522
You owe me $200.

824
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:08,984
This morning you said it was
gonna run me $150 for the hose.

825
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:12,646
Well, yeah, for the hose.
But when you left this mornin',

826
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:16,527
I had to replace a gasket and
that's gonna run you another 50.

827
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:19,985
- Nobody said anything about replacing a gasket.
- It was shot.

828
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:23,997
I don't give a fuck.
I didn't tell you you could do it,

829
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:27,171
and you can't do unauthorized work.

830
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:31,211
So all of a sudden you know everything
there is to know about being a mechanic.

831
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,297
Didn't you read the sign?

832
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,343
I can't do unauthorized work.
What am I supposed to do,

833
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,798
let you drive out of here with a bad gasket?

834
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:44,729
Then you get in an accident and get killed... or worse.

835
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,560
And who do they blame?
They blame me.

836
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,726
And there goes my reputation.

837
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,066
What reputation?

838
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,985
You're-- You're just an ignorant,

839
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,115
inbred, tumbleweed hick!

840
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,583
Is that an insult?
Are you insulting me?

841
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,833
Listen to me, you stupid fuck.

842
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,916
- I will--
- You listen to me, goddamn it, you sorry son of a bitch!

843
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:12,382
You owe me money.

844
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,843
And this car ain't goin' no-goddamn-where till I get it.

845
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:18,184
Do you understand me?
And if you take another five hours,

846
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,180
by God, I'll find another $50 worth
of work to do on the son of a bitch.

847
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:27,194
Now you get your ass outta here before
I call the sheriff, who knows me.

848
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,614
Oh! You wanna play?

849
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:41,447
I'll play with you.
Come on.

850
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:45,334
I'll play with you.
You wanna smash something? Huh?

851
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,542
- Here, I'll smash something.
- Okay, okay.

852
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,535
Okay. Please.

853
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,127
What's the matter?
All the fight gone out of you?

854
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:57,263
Just...
leave my car alone.

855
01:08:57,341 --> 01:09:00,051
It's too goddamn late.
You pissed me off.

856
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:07,928
Goddamn it, you son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

857
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,558
There you go sweet-talking me again.

858
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,653
Hey, Darrell, I-I'm gonna get you your money.

859
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:23,738
Let me... just get a couple of
things out of my trunk. Okay?

860
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,077
No, you won't.

861
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,840
What did you do to my trunk?

862
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,973
I had to pop the lock.
You didn't leave me no trunk key.

863
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,012
You had to get in the trunk?

864
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:48,517
When I work on a car, I work on a car, bud.

865
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:52,517
You motherfucker!

866
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,355
Motherfucker!

867
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,361
You motherfucking, pig-sucking, son of a--

868
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:01,864
- You can't help yourself, can you, mister?
- Fuck... you!

869
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:06,827
You're outta control.

870
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:30,518
- I need a ticket.
- Where to?

871
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,521
Uh, outta here.

872
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:36,153
- Uh, in particular, sir.
- I don't care.

873
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,322
I just want to get out.

874
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,530
Mex-Mexico.

875
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:43,111
Let's look.

876
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:47,737
Uh, you could go to...
Cuidad Juarez.

877
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:50,576
That would be the local.
That leaves in two hours.

878
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:54,673
- How much?
- One way is $30.55.

879
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,590
Yeah. $30.55.

880
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,550
Twenty more'll get you back.
Nope. One way.

881
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,880
Oh. All right.
Okay.

882
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:06,336
Twenty.
$27.60.

883
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,220
I have, uh--

884
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:15,015
$27-- $27.60.
That's what I have.

885
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,274
Well, sorry, sir.
Ticket is $30.55.

886
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:24,994
I bought a beer.
That was a dollar something.

887
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:29,833
Gave a quarter... to a girl for the jukebox.

888
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:36,996
- Then, the blind man--
- I see that, sir, but I'm sorry.

889
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:40,304
This ticket is $30.55.

890
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:46,177
I'm a little bit short.
That figures.

891
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,720
I just wanted to get out of here, you know?
I wanted to--

892
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:02,275
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am.

893
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,739
I don't...
I don't think you understand.

894
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,487
You see what they did to me?

895
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:15,827
They're gonna come for me.
They're gonna kill me!

896
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:18,834
If I don't get a ticket,

897
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:21,787
I'm gonna have to do something I don't want to.

898
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:24,009
I-- I don't wanna hurt anybody.

899
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:26,129
- I understand.
- I don't wanna hurt anyone.

900
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:28,466
I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to get out.

901
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:31,012
What I'm trying to say...
I have to get outta here!

902
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:41,395
Sir, I really need for you to remain calm, okay?

903
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:44,692
'Cause I can't even breathe right now, okay?

904
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:47,857
I am going to give you the ticket.

905
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:51,446
Please try and remain calm, sir.
You can keep the change.

906
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:56,003
It's bus number 323, and it will leave at 7:52 tonight.

907
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,210
- 7:52 tonight. Mm-hmm.
- God!

908
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:03,631
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I just... Well, you know...

909
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:08,967
I have to take a break right now.
I've very sorry.

910
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,971
Come on. Hey!

911
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:30,656
What is this shit town?

912
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,619
A pigsty.

913
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:37,290
Hey, got you, shit.
Hey, Bobby Cooper, got you!

914
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:59,432
Where's the fire, sweetheart?

915
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:03,768
I don't know how things work in Nevada,
but we got speed limits in this state, boy.

916
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:07,276
What? I'm going five miles an hour.
I'm looking town. I'm a tourist.

917
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:10,489
Whoa, what's that accent?
You ain't one of them Russians, are you?

918
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:15,411
- Yes, I am Russian. Da.
- I'm also rich Russian. Maybe we could work something out.

919
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:19,792
You tryin' to bribe me, boy?
Just 'cause you goddamn Russians ain't commies no more...

920
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,752
don't you think that money can buy everything, by God.

921
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,293
Uh-oh. Oh-ho.

922
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:28,587
What have we here?

923
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:32,512
Concealed is a definite no-no in this town, Ivan.

924
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,263
- Know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
- What fucking grocery store?

925
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:38,385
Get over there and spread 'em, motherfucker.

926
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,934
What the fuck you doing?
I want my lawyer!

927
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:44,058
- I'll get you a goddamn lawyer!
- I love America!

928

929
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:55,241

Get up, mister!
Don't ever let it be said...

933
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,915
that Toby N. Tucker beat the livin' shit
outta someone without givin' 'em a chance.

934
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,506
You crazy fuck!
What'd you do that for?

935
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:16,682
I'm doin' what any man would do if he'd been offended.
I'm stompin' your ass!

936
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:21,062
- Get up, bitch!
- You idiot. You don't even know what you're fighting for.

937
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,851
My honor.
That's what I'm fighting for.

938
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,976
Get up, or do I have to beat you where you lie?
Toby!

939
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,774
Leave him alone! Stay away, Jenny!
I aim to mess him up bad,

940
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,858
and that ain't nothing for a woman to see.

941
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,864
Don't be afraid of him. I don't care what he does.
We can still be together.

942
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,447
Get away from me!

943
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:42,544
Oh!?
What's this?

944
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,541
G-Give it here.
Gimme that.

945
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:49,711
Mexico?
Y'all think you can go to Mexico?

946
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,625
You won't ever have to see me again.
Just... give me the ticket.

947
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,724
This means something to you.

948
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,431
Well, Jenny means something to me, shithead!

949
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:05,016
What about that?

950
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:09,902
I'm gonna beat you so bad you ain't gonna
eat nothing but soup the rest of your days!

951
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:14,072
Stray dogs'll be prettier than you. I'm gonna
beat you so bad, I'm gonna make your mama sick!

952
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,866
Makes me feel good!
Let go of him! You're killing him!

953
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:29,081
Get off of him!

954
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:31,917
No! Go away!
Go home!

955
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:38,009
- Oh, Toby.
- I was only trying to defend your honor, baby.

956
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:42,103
I love my baby.
It ain't over, bitch!

957
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:46,310
- You killed him!
- Come here, mama.

958
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,202
Hello?
Grace, it's Bobby.

959
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,580
Thought you'd be on your way to Vegas by now.

960
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:10,084
What do you want?
I can't get you off my mind.

961
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:13,127
I've been doing nothing but
thinking about you since I left.

962
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:16,381
I want to get out of here and take you with me.

963
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:22,643
Thought you couldn't get your car.

964
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,928
I could if I had Jake's money.

965
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:31,147
Is that what changed your mind?
The money?

966
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,189
I don't give a damn about the money.

967
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:36,443
I want you, and I wanna get out of this
shit hole, and there's only one way to do it.

968
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,198
Are you sure?

969
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,160
About me, I mean.

970
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,700
I came back... for you.

971
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,830
It's you that I want.
I only stormed off this morning...

972
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,995
because you spooked me when you talked about Jake.

973
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:55,004
But I've had nothing but time
to think, and it all comes back...

974
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:57,707
to you and me and us getting out of here.

975
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,878
We gotta get that money, baby.

976
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:04,136
We get the money, I get the car and we are the hell out.

977
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:10,809
I thought you couldn't kill anybody.

978
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:16,023
I would do it for you, Grace.

979
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:19,028
So you can fly.

980
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:21,611
You could fly away like a bird.

981
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:29,497
Grace?

982
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,961
Grace.

983
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:41,299
Grace?

984
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:53,346
After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.

985
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,736
Who was that on the phone?

986
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:09,735
Wrong number.
Wrong number?

987
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:13,578
You spent a long time talking for the wrong number.

988
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:16,955

Sun's going down.

1005
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:21,708
Regular people, you know, they go home.

1006
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,003
Sit around the dinner table, you know?

1007
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:27,507
Have all this food prepared.
Everybody has a little setting.

1008
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:31,051
And they trade stories...
about the day, the heat.

1009
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,136
Maybe laugh about a little joke, something crazy they did.

1010
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,893
Then they kiss, sleep,

1011
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:41,646
wake up about two hours, do it all over again.

1012
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:46,776
Well, the day was all right.

1013
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,030
We all got through it okay.

1014
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:52,202
You keep it.
Day ain't over yet.

1015
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,492
Night is part of day.

1016
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:58,156
You see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.

1017
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:02,576
- You afraid of the dark?
- Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark.

1018
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,537
All because of a woman who made me this way.

1019
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:09,172
Want some?

1020
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,627
People are only afraid of what they can't see.

1021
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:14,508
I can't see nothing, so it's all the same to me.

1022
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:17,506
Kiss from a beautiful woman,

1023
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:20,889
lick from a dog, kiss of death.

1024
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:23,347
It's all the same to me now.

1025
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:28,070
So we're all just floatin' like sticks in a stream.

1026
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:31,241
Just enjoy the ride.
Is that it?

1027
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,611
That's about it.

1028
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:36,778
Not this twig, friend.
I got plans.

1029
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:38,788
Oh, you got plans.

1030
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:41,460
Nothing makes the Great Spirit
laugh harder than a man's plans.

1031
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:44,579
We all got plans. I got plans.
I planned on seeing all my life.

1032
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:47,798
I bet you never planned on straying into this town.

1033
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:50,799
I don't plan on sticking around, either.

1034
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:52,972
I used to be a young smart ass like you.

1035
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:56,051
Then I got smart with the wrong man's daughter.

1036
01:22:56,137 --> 01:23:00,597
I got acid poured on my peepers for my trouble.

1037
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,479
Human beings ain't only just human, you know.

1038
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:08,944
They got animals livin' inside 'em too.

1039
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:18,833
I hope she was worth it.

1040
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,200
Oh, she was worth it.

1041
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:24,747
She was worth every black minute since.

1042
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:30,206
Time's up, old one.

1043
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:33,166
Got any last minute words of wisdom?

1044
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,505
Things ain't always what they seem.

1045
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:40,505
You gotta ask yourself, "Is it worth it?"

1046
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:45,348
When the day comes, the earth maker's
gonna look right in your fuckin' heart.

1047
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:48,937
And then you better know what it is you're doin'.

1048
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:53,034
Are you a human bein'...
or just some hungry ghost out there?

1049
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,291
You're crazy.

1050
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,707
I'll be seeing you, old timer.

1051
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:14,466
I won't be seeing you.

1052
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:31,573
Yeah. Cheap bastard.
Give me back my own change.

1053
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,533
Come on, Jesse.

1054
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,695
We're gonna go for a walk.
You and me. Come on.

away, she won't leave you alone.

1080
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,270
Broke your mama's heart.
You stole me.

1081
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:40,438
You been a bad girl, Grace.
You little bitch.

1082
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:42,448
Broke her heart.

1083
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:03,677
Oh. I'm so sorry.

1084
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,850

got away.

01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:28,368
Take care of me.

1088
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:32,371

1089
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,537
Oh.

1090
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:47,342
Fuck.

1091
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,268
What's the matter?

1092
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:54,270
You don't hear something?

1093
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,772
No. Maybe the wind blew something over.

1094
01:27:56,854 --> 01:28:00,984
There's someone in the house.
Come on, baby. Don't stop now.

1095
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:03,027
Come on.

1096
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,825
Jake, what's that?
Where you get that?

1097
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:11,829
Relax, baby.
Stay here.

1098
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:14,541
Don't go out there.
Let's call Virgil.

1099
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:18,502
Shh-shh. You're just like your mama.
Always scared of things.

1100
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,092
Jake.

1101
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:53,739
Well, well. As I live and breathe.
Gimme that pipe.

1102
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,538
I didn't expect to see the likes of you again.

1103
01:28:56,622 --> 01:28:59,042
Thought you'd be long on your way by now.

1104
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,705
That's my gun.
That fucking Darrell.

1105
01:29:07,467 --> 01:29:10,797
That little redneck manages to get
paid no matter how things work out.

1106
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:13,257
You been working me the whole time, Jake.

1107
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,768
Well, I guess that's what they call irony.
It's not what you think.

1108
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:19,941
Sweet boy.
It's a big house.

1109
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:23,481
You probably didn't even make it out to the desert.
What did you do?

1110
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:26,816
Ply the afternoon between my sheets
putting your lips all over her,

1111
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,073
you little horndog?

1112
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:44,042
Now you've tasted both of us.

1113
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:47,381
Okay!

1114
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:49,665
Okay, I admit it.
I fucked her.

1115
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:52,049
It's not me you have to worry about, Jake.
It's her.

1116
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:54,966
She wants you dead!
She wants your money!

1117
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,136
What are you babbling about?

1118
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,135
Think about it.

1119
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:01,687
How do you think I got in here?
Did you hear any glass break?

1120
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:04,061
Did you hear any door shatter?

1121
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:06,688
How'd the evening end, Jake?
When you went to bed,

1122
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:10,896
did she linger just long enough, just
long enough to leave a back door open?

1123
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:13,238
Is that what happened?
You'd say anything to save your pathetic life.

1124
01:30:13,324 --> 01:30:15,834
You know what kind of woman Grace is.

1125
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:21,290
You know how badly she wants to
get the fuck out of Superior!

1126
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:24,884
What is she to you, Jake?
A woman who wants you dead.

1127
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:30,509
Let me kill her.

1128
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:33,391
All I want is $200 and get the fuck outta here.

1129
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:38,267
$200?

1130
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:41,179
$200 and, I swear to God, I'll kill her.

1131
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:46,773
Sweet Christ, get up.

1132
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:50,778
I'd be doing the world a favor
ridding it of the likes of you.

1133
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,412
You're positively pathetic.
Now, go kill Grace.

1134
01:30:57,493 --> 01:30:59,413
Go.

1135
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:46,121
- Jake! Jake!
- Grace!

1136
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:49,169
Grace. Grace. Grace!

1137
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:01,142
Grace.

1138
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:07,152
Well, is he--

1139
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:10,070
It looks like you got him.

1140
01:32:10,149 --> 01:32:12,359
You know, he-he--
He must have slipped past me.

1141
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:16,033
Looks like that drifter from this mornin'.

1142
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:25,870
Why don't you put that down, Grace?
It's all over now.

1143
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:29,503
Put it down.

1144
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:39,051
Oh, that's my Grace.

1145
01:32:39,136 --> 01:32:42,926
Not about to let someone get the best of her.

1146
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:46,518
That's what I love about you.

1147
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,113
Grace!

1148
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:40,315
Do something!

1149
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:48,579
Help me, Grace.

1150
01:33:59,091 --> 01:34:01,051
Like you helped her?

1151
01:34:29,413 --> 01:34:32,963
Why'd you wait so long?

1152
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:39,008
No gun!

1153
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:06,831
The money.

1154
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:15,457
Get the key!

1155
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,330
She was right.
She was right.

1156
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:55,003
Look at all this.

1157
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:00,795
Look. Look.

1158
01:36:02,798 --> 01:36:07,138
There must be 150--

1159
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:09,139
$200,000 dollars.

1160
01:36:10,347 --> 01:36:13,097
Oh. Oh, yes!

1161
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:16,444
Oh, baby!

1162
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,940
Oh, baby.
Oh, Grace, you were right.

What do you want?

1181
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:15,846
What the hell?
I should've figured it was you.

1182
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:18,891
Listen, bud, I'm a little busy tonight.
I got a waitress comin' over.

1183
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:20,636
What do you want?
My car.

1184
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,688
You got the money?

1185
01:38:29,486 --> 01:38:32,986
$200 in $100 bills.
This mornin' you was flat broke.

1186
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:35,033
That's none of your fucking business. Just get my keys.
I don't want no dirty money.

1187
01:38:35,117 --> 01:38:37,657
- I run a clean business.
- Get the keys.

1188
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:42,535
Well, there's a $50 overnight storage
charge that we gotta talk about.

1189
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,464
Well, let's see.

1190
01:38:46,545 --> 01:38:50,835
There's the scratched hood--
And how much did you make selling my gun?

1191
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:55,013
Let's just deduct this.
Keys.

1192
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:57,675
Don't know nothin' about no gun.
Of course not.

1193
01:38:59,516 --> 01:39:04,016
And Darrell, 40,000 people die every day.

1194
01:39:04,104 --> 01:39:06,774
How come you're not one of them?

1195
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:13,275

1200
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:30,588
Darrell, I'm getting the hell out of
this shit hole, and you're staying.

1201
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:32,593
But one little peep out of you--

1202
01:39:32,675 --> 01:39:35,465
And you remember, that gun makes
you part of the food chain.

1203
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:38,142
Your fingerprints are all over it.
So I'd be real careful...

1204
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:41,772
whose rectum I was pointing my finger up, if I was you.

1205
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:46,273
"Left foot red."

1206
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:10,134
No! No.

1207
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:16,049
No! She did it.
She fucking did it.

1208
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:21,933
You fucking did it. Bobby!

1209
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:25,346
What's the matter?

1210
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,936
Nothing. Nothing.

1211
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:31,112
I stubbed my toe.
It hurt like hell.

1212
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:33,111
I got the money all packed.

1213
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:35,493
I'll put the Jeep and his Caddy in the garage.

1214
01:40:35,571 --> 01:40:37,661
People'll think we went away.
Buy us some time.

1215
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:40,200
Good thinking.
I know a back road we can take.

1216
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:43,244
All right.

1217
01:40:43,328 --> 01:40:47,208
You know, funny thing.
Jeep wouldn't start.

1218
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:49,921
Had to push it in.

1219
01:40:50,002 --> 01:40:52,632
Funny thing.

1220
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:17,857
Fuck you, Superior!

1221
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:22,577
Whoa!

1222
01:41:22,659 --> 01:41:25,749
I feel like someone took a
million pounds off my shoulders.

1223
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:27,999
Where should we go?

1224
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:30,922
Hawaii.

1225
01:41:31,001 --> 01:41:35,881
I read about it. I dreamed about going
there and... lying on the beach.

1226
01:41:37,216 --> 01:41:39,126
Letting the water...

1227
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:41,718
lick up against my toes.

1228
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:44,224
I'd kill to go there.

1229
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:48,019
You already have.

1230
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:56,187
I thought you'd left me back there.

1231
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:59,896
- What are you talking about?
- When I got back from the garage and the Jeep wasn't there,

1232
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:02,948
I thought you'd left, taken off with the money.

1233
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,946
I never had much luck with women.

1234
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:15,132
The shit I've taken--

1235
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:17,212
I thought you were just like 'em.

1236
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:23,051
When you came outta that house--

1237
01:42:27,724 --> 01:42:31,854
Well, you're here.

1238
01:42:31,937 --> 01:42:35,767
We might be startin' in the shit, but we're
startin' someplace I never been before.

1239
01:42:35,858 --> 01:42:38,278
Together with someone.

1240
01:42:41,905 --> 01:42:43,815
With you.

1241
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:49,538
I love you, Bobby.

1242
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:59,296
We're gonna pull this off, Grace.

1243
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:01,971
We're gonna pull this off!

1244
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:14,188
Oh, my God.
Don't stop!

1245
01:43:14,271 --> 01:43:16,941
He doesn't know anything.
He's just gonna give us a ticket...

1246
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:20,364
- Keep going! He's gonna check the trunk.
- Pull over, goddamn it!

1247
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:23,114
- Shit.
- Pull the fuck over!

1248
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:25,197
He doesn't know anything.

1249
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:35,042
Evening, Sheriff. Sorry about
that little swerve back there.

1250
01:43:35,125 --> 01:43:38,335
A jackrabbit shot in front of me.
I didn't want to spin around.

1251
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:41,010
A jackrabbit.
Whoa! Wait a minute!

1252
01:43:41,089 --> 01:43:43,669
You had to fuck him, didn't you? Huh?

1253
01:43:46,136 --> 01:43:48,846
Baby, I would never do that to you.

1254
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:52,391
He killed Jake, and he said he'd
kill me if I didn't come with him.

1255
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:54,726
- All he wants is the money.
- What?

1256
01:43:54,811 --> 01:43:58,441
- Don't lie to me!
- Okay.

1257
01:43:58,523 --> 01:44:00,443
But he never made me come.

1258
01:44:00,525 --> 01:44:04,105
Really, Virgil, I was only doing what
I had to do so we could be free.

1259
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:07,366
Just like we talk about.
It meant nothing.

1260
01:44:07,449 --> 01:44:12,699
You're fuckin' him too? Is everybody fucking
everybody in this crazy goddamn town?

1261
01:44:12,788 --> 01:44:17,378
You find this guy, get him to do your dirty work,
and you can take the money and dump me!

1262
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:20,749
No, baby.
You got it wrong.

1263
01:44:20,837 --> 01:44:25,087
This road don't go to Globe, Grace.
Now, where is it you was gonna meet me?

1264
01:44:25,175 --> 01:44:28,755
It's not like that, Virgil. Look.

1265
01:44:28,845 --> 01:44:31,805
I got the money right here.

1266
01:44:36,353 --> 01:44:38,193
Right here.

1267
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:41,362
I watched you fuck that pervert for years.

1268
01:44:41,441 --> 01:44:46,401
All the time you was tellin' me you loved me.
What happened to us going to Milwaukee?

1269
01:44:46,488 --> 01:44:49,698
Gonna open up the finest sportin'
goods store that city ever did see.

1270
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:53,833
Just you and me, Grace.
What happened?

1271
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:59,286
Talk, talk.
All you'd do was talk.

1272
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:03,416
And all I'd do was sit around getting
older waiting for you to free me!

1273
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:05,915
You never did!
He did!

1274
01:45:11,013 --> 01:45:15,473
This is some girl you and me got here, Bobby boy.
Course, you have had a lot of practice.

1275
01:45:15,559 --> 01:45:19,149
Haven't you, darlin'?
Goin' way back, just like your crazy mama!

1276
01:45:19,229 --> 01:45:21,309
Shut up, Virgil!

1277
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:23,398
Just take your share of money and get outta here.

1278
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:26,323
I don't want the fucking money!

1279
01:45:26,403 --> 01:45:30,993
It's you! It's you, Grace, or nothin'.
The whole thing.

1280
01:45:31,074 --> 01:45:34,164
I want you to be my wife.

1281
01:45:34,244 --> 01:45:38,004
What do you say, Grace?

1282
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:42,538
You sound just like Jake.

1283
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:48,007
Just go back to your family.
They love you!

1284
01:45:48,091 --> 01:45:51,721
Wait, we got more.
There must be $200,000.

1285
01:45:51,803 --> 01:45:55,183
We split it three ways, and we all just walk.

1286
01:45:55,265 --> 01:45:59,975
I said shut up, boy! You don't know jack
shit about what's goin' on around here!

1287
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:04,322
- Virgil, stop!
- Get the fuck back, Grace! Goddamn it, I'm tellin' you!

1288
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:10,283
She tell you that story about wanting
to be a little bird and fly away?

1289
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:13,034
Was you gonna help her fly away, asshole?

1290
01:46:13,116 --> 01:46:15,616
- Virgil, stop it!
- Grace, get back!

1291
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:20,212
Did she tell you the story about how
old Jake forced her to marry him?

1292
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:24,500
That's a good'n, that one.
And how he killed her crazy mother?

1293
01:46:24,586 --> 01:46:29,716
Well, I bet I got a story that she didn't tell you.

1294
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:33,050
And it's the best one of all.
Right, baby?

1295
01:46:33,136 --> 01:46:35,546
Virgil!

1296
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:39,679
- You see, old crazy Jake...
- Virgil!

1297
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:41,848
...was really her papa.

1298
01:46:41,937 --> 01:46:44,057
No, Virgil!

1299
01:46:44,147 --> 01:46:47,227
And she liked fuckin' her papa.

1300
01:46:47,317 --> 01:46:51,237
Now she's killed that sumbitch,
just like she's gonna kill you.

1301
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:54,161
- No, you!
- Ahh!

1302
01:47:05,001 --> 01:47:07,461
Grace, no!

1303
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:13,585
Shit.

1304
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:23,194
Bobby, get the fuck up!

1305
01:48:08,356 --> 01:48:11,646
Aren't you gonna ask me?

1306
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:14,235
Ask you what?

1307
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:17,321
What kind of horrifying, sick shit is coming next?

1308
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:20,697
Don't you really wanna know?

1309
01:48:20,785 --> 01:48:24,155
Was Jake my father?
Was I fu--

1310
01:48:24,247 --> 01:48:27,667
- What do you want me to say?
- Yes, I was!

1311
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:30,171
I was fucking my daddy!

1312
01:48:30,253 --> 01:48:32,553
And I married him!
I married him! Okay?

1313
01:48:45,977 --> 01:48:49,097
I just wanted to be a kid.

1314
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:55,859
And he took that from me.

1315
01:48:57,781 --> 01:49:00,621
They treated me like--

1316
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:03,740
like meat.

1317
01:49:03,828 --> 01:49:05,788
A piece of meat.

1318
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:13,961
Fuck them! They fucked the whole town!
They deserved to die!

1319
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:48,039
Grab him further up.
Bend your knees this way.

1320
01:49:48,123 --> 01:49:50,173
- Wait.
- Ready?

1321
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:59,012
See ya, Virgil.
God bless.

1322
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:08,266
Is this bothering you?

1323
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:10,981
My hand is bothering me, Grace.

1324
01:50:11,062 --> 01:50:14,522
Gotta burn this.

1325
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:19,608
What do you think? Now that Jake's dead,
got all the money, don't need ya no more?

1326
01:50:19,696 --> 01:50:22,276
Might just sneak up behind you one day and pop?

1327
01:50:24,367 --> 01:50:27,407
Don't you think I would have
done it by now if I wanted to?

1328
01:50:30,373 --> 01:50:32,793
Come on, baby.
What can I do to make you feel more relaxed?

1329
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:37,835
Give me my gun back.

1330
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:42,089
Why don't we just finish what we started?

1331
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:48,886
What do you think happen to people's spirit when they die?

1332
01:50:48,975 --> 01:50:52,015
Nothing happens, Grace.
They're dead meat. That's it.

1333
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:57,320
You don't believe in anything, do you, Bobby?

1334
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,610
I believe in this moment.

1335
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:15,787
You wanna help me with him?
He must be 300 pounds.

1336
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:27,972
You hit me!

1337
01:51:32,727 --> 01:51:36,147
You hit me, Bobby.

1338
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:38,271
Motherfucker!

1339
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:47,201
Well?

1340
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:54,495
Well, nothing.

1341
01:51:54,582 --> 01:51:58,632
We dump Jake, split the money,

1342
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:00,672
then you're on your own.

1343
01:52:00,755 --> 01:52:03,165
Don't leave me, Bobby.
I wanna stay with you.

1344
01:52:03,258 --> 01:52:08,008
So the next cop pulls us over, you can sell me out again?
I was just baiting him.

1345
01:52:08,096 --> 01:52:12,886
I had to tell him that.
Just like you told Jake you was gonna kill me.

1346
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:17,056
Try Mexico.
With all that bread, you'd live like a queen.

1347
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:26,664
I don't wanna go to Mexico, Bobby.

1348
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:29,450
I wanna stay with you.

1349
01:52:29,534 --> 01:52:31,914
Don't you think I care about you?

1350
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:35,245
I think you're a lying, backstabbing, psycho bitch!

1351
01:52:35,331 --> 01:52:37,921
And one day you'll kill me.

1352
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:40,091
But it's nice to know you cared.

1353
01:52:43,465 --> 01:52:46,005
Come on. It's not such a bad thing we split.

1354
01:52:46,092 --> 01:52:49,762
Could be months before they find a body
out here with all the mountain lions.

1355
01:52:49,846 --> 01:52:51,886
We gotta get the fuck outta Arizona.

1356
01:52:51,973 --> 01:52:55,103
Remember:
no body, no crime.

1357
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:57,265
First rule of evidence.

1358
01:52:57,353 --> 01:53:00,613
We can be in Phoenix by noon.
Get rid of the car, get a new one.

1359
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:05,240
You'll find somebody else.
There's always hope with $100,000.

1360
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:07,240
Hope's a four-letter word.

1361
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:12,696
Hold him.

1362
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:21,878
You make a pretty couple.

1363
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:24,631
You should have been more careful, Jake.

1364
01:53:28,551 --> 01:53:30,721
See ya around.

1365
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:40,539
Shit.

1366
01:54:44,419 --> 01:54:46,499
Grace, help!

1367
01:54:46,588 --> 01:54:49,458
Grace, help me!

1368
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:55,509
Grace!

1369
01:54:55,597 --> 01:55:00,847
Grace! Oh, God! Please!
Don't go, Grace!

1370
01:55:03,813 --> 01:55:06,363
Sorry I hit you!

1371
01:55:06,441 --> 01:55:08,361
Grace!

1372
01:55:09,569 --> 01:55:11,489
Bobby?

1373
01:55:19,996 --> 01:55:22,326
Thank you, Grace. Thank you.
Can you make it back up?

1374
01:55:22,415 --> 01:55:25,535
I broke my leg!

1375
01:55:25,627 --> 01:55:30,047
Grace, in the trunk there's a tow rope!

1376
01:55:30,131 --> 01:55:33,971
Get the tow rope, tie it off.
I think it'll make it down here.

1377
01:55:40,642 --> 01:55:44,352
Bobby, the trunk is locked!
You have to throw the key up!

1378
01:55:46,814 --> 01:55:50,444
Bobby! I can't throw anything, Grace.

1379
01:55:50,526 --> 01:55:52,946
I can't move!

1380
01:55:53,029 --> 01:55:56,699
You have to come down!
It's the only way!

1381
01:55:56,783 --> 01:56:00,123
You can make it, Grace!
Please help me!

1382
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:08,882
Okay. I'm coming down.

1383
01:56:12,882 --> 01:56:15,092
Just wait!
Thank you.

1384
01:56:15,176 --> 01:56:19,636
I knew you couldn't leave me!
We've been through too much together.

1385
01:56:19,722 --> 01:56:23,142
Grace, where are you?
Grace!

1386
01:56:23,226 --> 01:56:26,226
I'm comin' down!

1387
01:56:26,312 --> 01:56:29,902
We'll go to Mexico!
We're meant to be together!

1388
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:42,699
Bobby, I can't do this alone!

1389
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:47,499
You gotta pull yourself together!

1390
01:56:47,583 --> 01:56:50,543
I'm not gonna leave you!

1391
01:56:50,628 --> 01:56:53,878
I never wanted it to go down like this.

1392
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:59,010
It was different with you, Bobby.

1393
01:56:59,095 --> 01:57:02,215
You had dreams like me.

1394
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:05,849
We could still make this work.

1395
01:57:09,981 --> 01:57:12,401
I didn't wanna hurt you.

1396
01:57:15,528 --> 01:57:17,948
They're right here.

1397
01:57:18,031 --> 01:57:20,911
You know why else I can never leave you?

1398
01:57:20,992 --> 01:57:23,332
Why?

1399
01:57:23,411 --> 01:57:26,201
Because I love you, Grace.

1400
01:57:26,289 --> 01:57:30,539
- I love you.
- I love you, Bobby.

1401
01:57:30,626 --> 01:57:34,706
I don't know whether to love you...

1402
01:57:34,797 --> 01:57:37,877
or kill you!

1403
01:57:43,556 --> 01:57:46,216
I love you, Grace, but I can't trust you.

1404
01:57:59,447 --> 01:58:05,037
- You're such a good--
- Jake! Jake! Jake!

1405
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:09,499
Jake can't help you.

1406
01:59:41,257 --> 01:59:43,797
You're still lucky.

1407
01:59:48,681 --> 01:59:51,641
Adiós.

1408
02:00:16,125 --> 02:00:18,455
Oh, shit!

1409
02:00:27,637 --> 02:00:29,797
