00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,349
<i> This sound we're going
to record with a tape recorder.</i>

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,781
<i>- Brad?
- Here we go.</i>

4
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,016
<i>- Brad?
- Yes.</i>

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,191
<i> Do you want me
 to lay out again</i>

6
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,318
<i> after that instrumental break,</i>

7
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:23,763
<i> and then come back in
 with the fours</i>

8
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:25,418
<i>t oward the end of the, uh--
 like, before "C"?</i>

9
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,426
<i> We'll have you wail on
that baby, for the instrument...</i>

10
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:28,858
<i> Here we go!
 This'll be what?</i>

11
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,133
<i> Okay, take two.</i>

12
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,169
<i>- Alvin!
 - Okay!</i>

13
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:17,644
<i> It's 5:00 in Los Angeles!</i>

14
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,502
The Wrecking Crew was
the focal point of the music.

15
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,897
They were the ones
with all the spirit,

16
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,269
and all the know-how,

17
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,138
especially for rock and roll
music.

18
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,882
<i> In the hardcore
 producing area,</i>

19
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,311
<i> everybody knew
 what went on there.</i>

20
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,716
I mean, everybody knew
that the best musicians

21
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,148
played on all the sessions,

22
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:01,293
but we as the general public
didn't know.

23
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,818
I had no idea
that certain people

24
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:06,464
didn't play their own records
until The Monkees came along.

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,840
They played so well, and
they played so well together.

26
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:20,337
I think they were so into that.
They all respected each other,

27
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,471
and they all would
sit and hang--

28
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,376
You know, talk
in between takes and hang.

29
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,109
I mean, it was like--
it was a social event

30
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,554
for these guys too.

31
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,321
<i> What was nice
 about that unit</i>

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,390
<i> was that they played
 together a lot.</i>

33
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,319
And so they were
an established groove machine.

34
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,155
They knew each other.

35
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,501
So you could really count on
what they had to offer.

36
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,767
We played on everybody's.

37
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,568
<i> The Lazy-Crazy-Hazy Days
 of Summer album</i>

38
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,800
with Nat King Cole,
it was the same guys doing that

39
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,765
that was doing The Beach Boys.

40
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,214
The musicians were really
the unsung heroes

41
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,780
of all those hit records.

42
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,448
When I listen
to the records,

43
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,879
it is so apparent
that these guys

44
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,646
were just really so good.

45
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:10,815
And you can see why
everybody used 'em, you know?

46
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,724
Because they were so tight.

47
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:17,896
They were the stone cold
rock and roll professionals,

48
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,328
and there may never, ever be

49
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:24,165
a group of rock and roll
musicians

50
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,901
of that caliber again.

51
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,451
<i> The chances are,
 you didn't know his name.</i>

52
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,623
<i> But it's likely you sang and
 hummed along with his music.</i>

53
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,563
<i> Famed studio guitarist
 Tommy Tedesco has died.</i>

54
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,159
<i> I'm Kurt Loder
 with an MTV news brief.</i>

55
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,632
<i> Tommy Tedesco was arguably</i>

56
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,700
<i> the king of Los Angeles
 session guitarists.</i>

57
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,969
<i> You've probably never
 heard his name</i>

58
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,998
<i> or heard him speak,
 but listen.</i>

59
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,373
<i> He is someone
 you've heard before.</i>

60
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:03,405
<i> He was featured
 in the theme to Bonanza ...</i>

61
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,878
<i> in Batman.</i>

62
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,179
<i> The chores!</i>

63
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,312
<i> The stores!</i>

64
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,616
<i> Tedesco died of cancer Monday</i>

65
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:11,978
<i> at his home
 in Northridge, California,</i>

66
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,416
<i> at the age of 67.</i>

67
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,050
<i> While his name may not be
 immediately familiar</i>

68
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,785
<i> to everyone, some aspect of
 his music almost certainly is.</i>

69
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,092
Here's the irony.

70
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,564
You spend your whole life
playing guitar,

71
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,062
creating guitar licks
that people

72
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,533
all around the world recognize.

73
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,201
But nobody knows your name,
until you're dead.

74
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,171
And then, even in the end,

75
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,799
they misspell your name
and call you...

76
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,804
<i>- " Tony Tedesco."
- . .. instead of Tommy.</i>

77
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,911
Tommy was not only
a legendary guitarist.

78
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,340
He was my father.

79
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,875
And he was also a member
of an elite group

80
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,521
of studio musicians.

81
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,188
So what follows
is the story of my father

82
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,187
and his extended family,
The Wrecking Crew.

83
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,504
Hondells, Marketts,
Routers--

84
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,642
We'd cut the tracks
and the records,

85
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,237
and then they'd form a group
to be that group.

86
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,640
People were really
not focused

87
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:14,382
on the long, drawn-out album
recording sessions.

88
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,651
Four songs in three hours.

89
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,721
<i> It's only a certain group
 of guys can do that.</i>

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,790
A lot of the recording
came out here.

91
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,859
That's when you had an influx
of a lot of New York musicians.

92
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,528
<i> That was in the mid-'60s,</i>

93
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,428
<i> when they started
 flowing out here.</i>

94
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,130
<i> Then it became a flood
 around that time.</i>

95
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,474
This led to a surge of work

96
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,068
for the L.A. studio musicians.

97
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,600
Not all of 'em,
but a small group,

98
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,114
who later became known
as The Wrecking Crew.

99
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,718
It wasn't an organized band
of musicians

100
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,547
that set out
to take over rock and roll.

101
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,022
And I can't tell you
exactly who was part of this

102
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,521
hit-making machine.

103
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,392
Even the musicians
that were part of this scene

104
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,821
couldn't come to an agreement.

105
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,056
Twelve, 15 people.

106
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,060
Maybe what, 20 of us?

107
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,332
Thirty, maybe?

108
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,100
It was probably
20 musicians,

109
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,399
or maybe a few more,

110
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,100
counting the string players,
of course.

111
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,002
They were doing
all the sessions.

112
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:15,573
<i>They were a product
 of the '40s, '50s, and '60s.</i>

113
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,506
<i> And they were great musicians</i>

114
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:22,552
<i> who came of age
when rock and roll came of age.</i>

115
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:26,349
And here they are at the height
of their physical powers

116
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,393
with all of this talent.

117
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,489
And they're in the right place.
And it's the right time,

118
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,993
and so they get to do this.

119
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,343
On the first day of shooting,
I brought

120
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,975
four of L.A.'s greatest
session players together.

121
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,621
Carol Kaye,
Plas Johnson

122
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,947
and Hal Blaine,
along with my father.

123
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,492
It was probably the first time
that all four

124
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,288
had been in the same room
in about 20 years.

125
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,420
Do you recognize me--
You've lost weight!

126
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,226
And all you have to do is
just get sick.

127
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,760
<i>Rolling.</i>

128
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,472
<i>- Rolling.
- Okay, the question is--</i>

129
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,112
This is not, uh--

130
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,737
You know, if all the guys
that had been in the studios--

131
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,043
God bless 'em all--
For 20, 30 years,

132
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,745
they all wore the blue blazers,
the neck ties,

133
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,718
and there was no talking,
no smoking, and no nothing.

134
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,447
And we came in there
with Levis and t-shirts,

135
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,424
smoking cigarettes,
whatever we're--

136
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,992
Yeah.
- And the older guys

137
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,920
were saying, "They're gonna
wreck the business."

138
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,156
You know, "They are gonna wreck
the music business."

139
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,431
We didn't have the respect
that the older guys had.

140
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,800
<i> Remember the older
 studio players,</i>

141
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,068
<i> Barney Kessels,
 and the Lloyd Elliots,</i>

142
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,967
<i>-  all these people?
- Yeah, exactly.</i>

143
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,939
Well, that's how that whole
wrecking crew thing came in.

144
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,768
Even though the term
"The Wrecking Crew"

145
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,343
gained popularity
with rock historians,

146
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,312
many of these musicians
never heard the term

147
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,941
until years later.

148
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:02,046
I think Hal Blaine was
the first one I heard it from.

149
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,279
- Yeah, it--
- He probably

150
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,483
came up with the name.

151
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,485
I think it kind of evolved
really.

152
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,787
- There was--
- The first time I heard

153
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,188
the name, I think
was at The Baked Potato,

154
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,459
where they had
that get-together.

155
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,757
They used the expression
"the wrecking crew."

156
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,328
Well, it was used before that.

157
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,187
It was used
while we were recording.

158
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,756
And the definition of who was
a member of The Wrecking Crew,

159
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,595
there really isn't
any definition.

160
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,531
Between the engineers,
producers

161
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,096
and musicians themselves,

162
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,414
each has their own take
on how this all went down.

163
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,607
Together, they form
a snapshot of a time

164
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,880
that will never be repeated.

165
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,450
Anybody could do
five or six different things

166
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,650
on as many different
instruments also.

167
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,352
There were a lot of producers
at that time

168
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,754
that were not really musicians,

169
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,955
so these guys were able
to decode--

170
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,887
He's talking about me,
by the way, so--

171
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,293
No, I mean, there were
some producers

172
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,834
that really just, you know,

173
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,529
didn't really know
the musicians' language,

174
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,471
and these guys were able
to just quickly interpret it.

175
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,667
The people
we're talking about

176
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,428
played for so many people

177
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,796
in so many
different styles.

178
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,544
That's a fascinating thing.

179
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,280
They could walk into, uh,
a pop sound, and play it.

180
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,378
They could do
rhythm and blues.

181
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,049
They could do
soul music.

182
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,307
I guess they could have done
classics if they'd had to,

183
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,646
but they had
the magic touch.

184
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,291
We injected
a lot of ourself into it,

185
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,847
because we were
experts at doing it.

186
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,285
<i> We were doing it
 all the time.</i>

187
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,460
<i> A guy would give us
 a lead sheet or something,</i>

188
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,788
<i> and we'd know
 what the song was.</i>

189
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,433
<i> We made up a lot
 of arrangements and so forth</i>

190
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,758
<i> on that set,
 ourselves on those things.</i>

191
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,225
<i>Here's the way
that The Beat Goes On sounded</i>

192
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,434
when we first heard it.

193
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,175
I said, "Uh-oh,
we need to pull

194
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,983
a rabbit out of a hat
for this one," you know?

195
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,685
It was our job to come up
with riffs and stuff,

196
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,858
so about the third line
I came up with was:

197
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,365
And Sonny loved it
and he gave it to Bob West,

198
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,998
the bass player, to play it.
And both of us are playing it

199
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,814
throughout the tune.
And without a good bass line,

200
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,567
the tune doesn't pop,
you know,

201
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,605
it doesn't snap, you know,
like a big hit record.

202
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,778
I've always said,
"They put notes on paper.

203
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,624
They put notes on paper,

204
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,920
but that's not music."
You make the music.

205
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,362
What do you do with the notes?

206
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:24,757
- Right.
- What you do with the charts?

207
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,058
- Absolutely.
- What you do with the chords?

208
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,689
Other than that,
they can call the union

209
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,264
- for a guitar player.
- That's right, so--

210
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,762
So it's what
you put into it,

211
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,664
because how many days are,
in fact, we're all here.

212
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,726
And it's what you put into it
that's not written.

213
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,265
Yeah, well, in fact, everybody
can-- that's sitting here,

214
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,070
I remember doing
different things

215
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,972
that weren't
ever even thought about.

216
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,014
And then, all of a sudden,
become part of the record,

217
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,780
and part of signature
of the record.

218
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,538
We all used to produce our own
parts. It's that simple.

219
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,176
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- To make it swing, yeah.

220
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,156
You know, the first thing
that I ever did

221
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,132
that smacked of any kind
of rock and roll

222
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,061
was some kind of date,
which I don't even know

223
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,166
who the artist was.
There wasn't a minor 7th chord

224
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,469
in the bushel, you know?
It was all pretty vanilla.

225
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,212
That's when I knew
something was different.

226
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,467
<i>At the time, I was doing
the Ozzie And Harriet TV show.</i>

227
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,906
- Ah.
- Then all of a sudden,

228
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,811
you know, I'm doing this show.
And then, they--

229
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,013
One day, they come up with--
Well, Jimmie Haskell comes up...

230
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,845
- with Ricky Nelson.
- And with Ricky Nelson, said...

231
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,220
- It's rock and roll.
- "We're doing

232
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,518
this rock and roll stuff."

233
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,820
I don't know
what they're talking about.

234
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,151
Just laid out a chord sheet,
and says,

235
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,686
- "Play behind Ricky Nelson."

236
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,421
So pretty soon,
you've ended up--

237
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,226
We were starting
to get involved in this.

238
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,374
That's what took me to L.A.
in-- In 196--

239
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,171
Summer of 1960, uh, to play
in the Ricky Nelson band.

240
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,006
<i> Working with those people
 like that</i>

241
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:54,081
<i> was a perfect showcase
 for what would happen later.</i>

242
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:57,181
Which I had no idea
that I would ever be

243
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,054
the "session" player.

244
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,353
I didn't even know
what that meant.

245
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,585
<i> We learned how to play
 rock and roll</i>

246
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,861
<i> right there on the job.</i>

247
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,159
Hey, you know,
if they want this...

248
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,759
I can do that.

249
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,704
You know, that's Latin--
That's Latin music.

250
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,700
That's nothing, you know.

251
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,665
You can do that
all day long.

252
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:23,214
There were some purists,
like there is

253
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,880
in every way of life,
some people will not compromise.

254
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,850
Not that they couldn't.
They wouldn't, most of the time,

255
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,180
permit themselves
to, you know--

256
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,715
They felt that they were
at a certain level.

257
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,591
And playing rock and roll

258
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,160
was perhaps a little bit
beneath them.

259
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,818
<i> And they didn't want
 to get into it,</i>

260
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,986
<i> whereas, our guys,
 we welcomed the rock and roll.</i>

261
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,496
They didn't play that shit.
they didn't know about it.

262
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,929
They didn't like it.

263
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,943
And I started out
playing demos mainly,

264
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,237
you know, $10 a song,
and I got to eat that day, and--

265
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,211
I had three kids to earn
a living, and that's it.

266
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,710
And the money was important
to pay the rent.

267
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:03,084
And so I did what
all the rest of the guys did.

268
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,853
I got, uh,
a fender guitar

269
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,493
and put the light gauge strings
where you could

270
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,959
bend 'em from here
to Christmas.

271
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,317
And listened to some of
the people that were doing this,

272
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,926
and the rock groups, and I got
so I could play that stuff

273
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,860
better than they could.

274
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,125
The very first call
I had ever had at Disney,

275
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,265
we got there a quarter to 12:00,
and all the blue blazers

276
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,242
were leaving.
And we're all sitting there,

277
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,940
and he makes a little speech
about, "Ladies and gentlemen,

278
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:35,875
we brought you in here
because in this particular film,

279
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,582
we're gonna do a little--
Some of your--

280
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,354
- your rock and roll music."
- "Your rock and roll music"?

281
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,423
"It is this"-- Yeah.
"There's a little scene here..."

282
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,192
- It always happens to me.
- "...and we're gonna show it

283
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,761
to you," And it was
a quick, little scene,

284
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,659
so he says, "Now, we have
all the music for you.

285
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,462
It's there in front of you.

286
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,263
And we're gonna do this to what
we call a 'click track.'"

287
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,966
Like, we didn't know
anything was going on.

288
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,038
"We're gonna run
the click very slow

289
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:00,567
so that you can all learn,
study, and memorize this music."

290
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:04,644
And then he said, "Mary Anne,
play the click much slower."

291
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,314
Well, she accidentally hit it,

292
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,113
and the minute
we heard eight clicks,

293
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,754
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-
ding-ding-ding, we're in.

294
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,080
And we play this thing
front to back.

295
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,586
And when we finished,
this guy said,

296
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,190
"How in the--
man, you did it perfect.

297
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,631
- I wish we'd have made that."
- "Made it."

298
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:23,387
"How in the world
could you do that?"

299
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,526
And Tommy said, "We practice
a lot during the day."

300
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,873
It was perfect, 'cause they--

301
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:29,999
they thought you were
a complete idiot.

302
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,303
I mean, it was unbelievable.

303
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,482
Most of the music
and the money--

304
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,777
I was about to say-- It was
a Freudian slip, but true--

305
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,179
came out of the Brill building
in New York.

306
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,051
It was New York-based,
New York writers,

307
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,019
New York singers,
New York musicians.

308
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,318
The music business was
in New York city,

309
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
period, at that time.

310
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,491
Rolling master "A."

311
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,959
Master "A," take one.
Here we go, rolling.

312
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,429
<i> Say, Chess Records
 back in Cincinnati.</i>

313
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,201
But there were only maybe
one guitar player,

314
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
one bass player,
one piano player,

315
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,672
so it could almost get held up
by those one or two guys.

316
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,201
Well, they could come
to Los Angeles,

317
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,836
and they-- It wouldn't
matter if they could call

318
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,641
a matter of 10 or 12
different guitar players,

319
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,043
all of them would be
equally as good

320
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,344
to do what they wanted done,

321
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,175
plus we had more studios
out here.

322
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,350
A lot of the musicians
that were back east,

323
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,650
and in Nashville,
a lot of 'em came out here

324
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,393
to seek their fame
and fortune.

325
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,148
<i> This was
 an untapped place for--</i>

326
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,086
<i> for new artists
 to record too.</i>

327
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,331
Lee Hazlewood told me
he went back to New York

328
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,657
to do a session,
and he just kind of walked

329
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,033
over to the guitar player,
and said,

330
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,261
"Hey, could you play me
this little thing?"

331
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,725
And the guy said,
"Write it out."

332
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,404
And the guy just refused

333
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,443
to experiment and try anything.
Like, if it wasn't written out,

334
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,539
he wasn't gonna play it.
You had young musicians

335
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,811
who were willing to contribute

336
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,379
and come up with ideas,
you know,

337
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,907
and I think that
was the difference.

338
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,353
<i> I don't think
 it's any secret.</i>

339
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,848
The '60s called
all of the music to the west.

340
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,791
L.A. was the place to be.

341
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,957
If you wanted the best, they
were right here, in Los Angeles.

342
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,131
It was a rougher, looser sound

343
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,236
than what was
coming out of New York,

344
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,268
having a lot to do with,
I guess, the musicians

345
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:17,244
that we were using, 'cause
they were fresh to the sound.

346
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,324
Hal, you started
the surf

347
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,562
and Earl started
that double time, you know.

348
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,472
You know-- You know, we
doubled it up and made it sweet.

349
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:46,269
Yeah, it was sort of like
east coast/west coast jazz.

350
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,372
There was really
a distinct difference.

351
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,275
And at-- for those years,
the record producers

352
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,937
- chose the west coast.
- Yeah,

353
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,106
and the hits started
coming out of here.

354
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,547
This was where
the youthful movies

355
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,555
were being made.
Everybody wanted to be a surfer.

356
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,357
Whether you were white
or black or lived

357
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,329
in the middle of the desert,
you wanted to have a surfboard.

358
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,158
It was crazy.
And along with it

359
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:13,203
came young music,
and it was created here.

360
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,469
<i> Beach beauties everywhere,
and art lovers willing to look.</i>

361
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,811
<i> This is paradise for thousands
 of sun worshipers,</i>

362
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,278
<i> Californians by birth
 or adoption.</i>

363
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,877
I remember the perfumed air,
the night-blooming jasmine,

364
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,981
and all the kind of plants
that grow

365
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:33,793
in Southern California,
and how dreamy it all was.

366
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,287
It was the sound
of The Beach Boys

367
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,658
kind of wafting through
from house to house,

368
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,588
you know, almost the same record
just repeating,

369
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,034
and the idea that,
"Hey, this is real.

370
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,030
this is the culture here,
is this beach thing."

371
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:50,203
<i>-  The Beach Boys!</i>

372
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,773
Thank you very much.

373
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,141
Right now, we'd like to show you
how The Beach Boys

374
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,010
go about making a record.

375
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,709
We start with Denny Wilson
on the drums...

376
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,876
...followed by Al Jardine
on rhythm guitar...

377
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,191
...helped out
by Carl "lead guitar" Wilson...

378
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,771
...and filled out instrumentally
by our leader,

379
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,997
Brian Wilson on the bass.

380
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,335
When we're ready to sing,
we step up to the microphones,

381
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,044
and it comes out
something like this.

382
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,085
<i> I went
 to Gold Star,</i>

383
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,504
<i> and I met musicians' favorite,
 Phil Spector,</i>

384
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:55,098
And I immediately had
Steve Douglas start booking,

385
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,601
you know, the re--
They're called the regulars,

386
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:59,243
The Wrecking Crew.
And he started booking them

387
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,239
for me in my studio
in Western.

388
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,641
Session players were
brought in by producers

389
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,543
for a variety of reason.

390
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:09,545
In fact, most of the mid-1960s,
beach boys backing tracks

391
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,319
didn't feature
any of The Beach Boys.

392
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,087
It was Brian Wilson's decision
to push the music

393
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,217
to another level.
And to do that,

394
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,362
he enlisted the best of L.A.

395
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:21,128
We were on the road
150 days a year.

396
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,587
Brian was getting a little bit
more complex

397
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:27,165
in his arrangements. And
it just got to be too difficult

398
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,467
to-- to coordinate
our itineraries.

399
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,040
And that's when
The Wrecking Crew stepped in.

400
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,369
When I heard that
some of the guys sat in

401
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,335
for some of The Beach Boys,
that surprised me.

402
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,244
But in truth, at that point,

403
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,946
The Beach Boys were
Brian Wilson.

404
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,448
He created it all.

405
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,619
He was very self-assured,
very much in control.

406
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,318
He brought in the charts
that he wrote himself.

407
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:53,291
And most of the time, I mean,
the music was entirely his.

408
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,433
I mean, there were
very few times that we made up

409
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,898
- licks on his stuff. Yeah.
- ...musically correct.

410
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,897
He had in his head
what he wanted.

411
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,169
First album,
it was--

412
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,298
<i> Summer Days
 ,</i>

413
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,743
The Beach Boy album.

414
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,407
Ray Pohlman was a great
bass player, really good.

415
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,167
Steve Douglas was,
like, so on-the-mark

416
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:13,736
as a saxophone player.
He just blew my mind.

417
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,176
He played with such finesse,
you know?

418
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,283
And he used to get real close
to the microphone

419
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,715
to get the best benefit
of his instrument.

420
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,691
They were all-- The Wrecking
Crew-- They were just great.

421
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,899
Brian was a genius.
I mean, he would just--

422
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,343
He was just good
as I've ever seen, I believe,

423
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,683
about putting things
together.

424
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:49,108
Western studio,
and there was probably...

425
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,975
fifteen, 20 guys in that studio.

426
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,415
He'd start at the first guy...

427
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,050
and he'd sing 'em their part
until they got it,

428
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,685
and second guy,
he'd sing their part,

429
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,490
and the third guy,
all the way around the room.

430
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,833
Then he'd go back
to the first guy.

431
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,998
Well, the first guy
had forgot his part

432
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,457
and he'd sing it again,
sang a second--

433
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,396
He taught the whole thing
by rote.

434
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,731
And all of a sudden,
that whole band

435
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:14,536
could play that shit.
I mean, Brian is--

436
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,770
When you want to talk
about genius,

437
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,406
he's-- There's not any more
like him that I know of.

438
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,583
I mean, he's unbelievable.

439
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:26,382
<i> Pet Sounds was
an incredibly important record,</i>

440
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:30,756
and still stands there, like,
"Okay, top this," you know?

441
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:35,187
<i>George Martin told me
 Sgt. Pepper was an attempt--</i>

442
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,634
<i>It was an attempt
to equal Pet Sounds.</i>

443
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,500
So it was an incredibly
influential record

444
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,931
and I think it had
an electromagnetic field.

445
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:48,266
And people were drawn here,
and wanted to be a part of that,

446
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,044
and wanted to make records
like that.

447
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:53,413
<i> Good Vibrations, we must have
done 25, 30 sessions.</i>

448
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,053
It might take
six months to do.

449
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,678
Some days,
we worked five minutes.

450
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,553
- Some days, four hours.
- Yeah.

451
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,892
- On the same song.
- We just-- We experimented.

452
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,548
And they would ask me,
"Well, what do you want?"

453
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,356
And I'd say, "well,
I don't know," you know?

454
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,958
and we'd go home, and
the next time we get together,

455
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,189
then we would fall together,
and we'd do the thing.

456
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:12,755
Three months,
two, three dates a week,

457
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,095
but Capitol Records
was picking up the tab.

458
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,671
<i> And we liked
 to work for him.</i>

459
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,299
The word was,
"Do you have the date

460
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:19,604
with Brian Wilson
tomorrow?"

461
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,165
I'd say, "Yeah, I do."
"Oh, good."

462
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,244
<i>Well, Carol played
on Good Vibrations</i>

463
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:26,112
<i>and California Girls,
and she was, like,</i>

464
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,412
the star of the show.
I mean, she was

465
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,653
the greatest bass player
in the world.

466
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,349
And she was
way ahead of her time.

467
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,151
She would play
a tonic in a fifth

468
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,452
or a third instead of a fifth,
you know.

469
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,545
She was one
of the first bass players

470
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,186
to start playing that way.

471
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,931
But he definitely wrote out
some neat lines on the bass,

472
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,427
like, for instance:

473
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:45,357
I'd never played that.

474
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,001
I'll just go into this...

475
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,152
Now, that's
a jazz walking line.

476
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:04,747
You knew that this kid was into
something really, really great.

477
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:08,021
The room had a spirit to it,
with Hal being the leader,

478
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,420
you know,
and all the guys

479
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,922
working together,
and thumping and pumping.

480
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,323
<i> He would get things
 like he wanted to hear them.</i>

481
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:15,656
And when he got 'em that way,
it was good.

482
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:18,361
<i>When I heard G ood Vibrations
the first time on the radio,</i>

483
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,934
I just--
It just blew me away.

484
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,289
<i> Now.</i>

485
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,925
<i> Very good.</i>

486
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,960
I remember Carol though.
I still have to remember,

487
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,965
'cause your favorite thing,
no matter what day we went on

488
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:59,338
after that, "Would you like me
to use my Beach Boy pick?"

489
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:00,698
And so she'd

490
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,966
impress the shit out of--
This one, and--

491
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,575
She picked it up
on her way to the studio.

492
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,037
And they're looking
at this pick,

493
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,005
- and they're looking at her.
- You have to sell it,

494
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,554
- you know.
- She was selling this shit

495
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,179
like I couldn't believe.
One little pick made this girl

496
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,545
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

497
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,669
I was very jealous
of the guitar

498
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,939
when we were first dating
and got engaged,

499
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:36,068
and he paid a lot more
attention to the guitar, I felt.

500
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:39,635
So I gave him an ultimatum,
"It's me or the guitar."

501
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:43,905
And he said, "Honey,
the guitar doesn't have legs.

502
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,416
you do."

503
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,618
I got so upset with him,
I took my ring

504
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,550
and I threw it at him.

505
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,016
Then I went looking for it.

506
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,924
And I was one of these
late starters in life.

507
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,686
I wasn't one of these guys that
you read about in the books.

508
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:58,356
You know, you read
these articles

509
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,564
<i>in Guitar Player magazine,
the guy says,</i>

510
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,265
"Well, when I was
12 years old,

511
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,967
I had the chops of a reindeer
and all this stuff, you know."

512
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:08,472
When I was 12 years old,
I was playing marbles myself,

513
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,844
I don't know, you know.
And when I was 24,

514
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,083
I was at Douglas Aircraft,
you know, moving boxes

515
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,379
- and trying to play guitar.

516
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,881
I was 24,
I was still into this.

517
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,784
"Wow, I'm in seventh position."

518
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,686
And I finally learned
one hip chord.

519
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,088
- Whoa.

520
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:29,461
So I'm not one of them guys
you read about.

521
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:31,962
We went to the prom,
and Ralph Marterie

522
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,134
was playing the dance.
We found out

523
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,373
that their guitar player
was leaving that night.

524
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,770
And he tried out,
auditioned,

525
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,972
and he was hired
right then and there.

526
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,174
It was on a Friday night,
and the Saturday night,

527
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,576
he left for New York city.

528
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,958
<i> Tell the truth.
- Okay, you got to let go.</i>

529
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:07,525
Marterie was going to get
a guitar/singer,

530
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:11,003
so that he could only pay
for one guy.

531
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,443
He decided he knew
there was nothing there

532
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,539
in Niagara Falls for him.

533
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:18,611
He wanted to go
to California to play.

534
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:21,211
While my father struggled
to find work playing guitar,

535
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,883
he had to make ends meet
working in a warehouse.

536
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:26,583
He always said it was
the best job he ever had.

537
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,686
He hated it so much,
it made him practice every day.

538
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:34,529
I was told by two guys
before we left,

539
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,687
"He's never gonna make it."

540
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:38,996
So after seven months
of struggling here,

541
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:42,928
daddy wanted to go back,
and I said, "There's no way,"

542
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,495
because I wasn't giving in
to those two guys.

543
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:50,713
And that's why dad said,
"My stubborn Sicilian wife."

544
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,680
In fact,
my wife was behind me 100%,

545
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,350
like, all the time I work.
And she's-- It was "You tour."

546
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,220
She was working,
she took the calls,

547
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,748
she didn't-- never complained.

548
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:03,353
I would come in
at 11:00 or 10:00,

549
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:04,956
I'd see my kids whenever.

550
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,657
My wife accepted it,
this was our living,

551
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,030
our whole family took it
exactly that way.

552
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,799
Every once in a while,
a musician's wife

553
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,557
would come
and complain to her,

554
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,296
and she'd talk to them.
She'd say,

555
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,871
"Well, look,
that's his living."

556
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,669
Well, Carmie never talked
to Barbara the Barbarian.

557
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:22,572
Whoa-ho-ho-ho.

558
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:24,575
My father would say,
"There are only four reasons

559
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:25,977
to take a gig:

560
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,448
for the money,
for the connections,

561
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,947
for the experience,
or just for fun."

562
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,580
I got to tell you a story
about your dad.

563
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:35,716
We were in Western studio
three there,

564
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:38,621
and, uh, Jan Berry
of Jan and Dean,

565
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,824
he counted the song,
"Everybody ready? Yeah. Okay."

566
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:46,396
Tedesco started playing,

567
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,129
and Jan says, "Stop, wait."
And he went over and looked,

568
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:51,165
and he said, "Tedesco,
what are you doing?"

569
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,440
He-- Tommy--

570
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:53,698
The music was upside down,

571
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,636
and Tommy was
reading it backwards.

572
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,041
Now, that's a true story,

573
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,243
but you talk about
getting a laugh out of it.

574
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:00,735
Tommy was a cut-up.

575
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,558
Hold it, cut it.

576
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,131
<i> There was an energy
 that Phillip would get.</i>

577
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:25,243
<i> I remember, Phillip would be
so excited about every session.</i>

578
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:29,067
There was just a vitality
in the room that was--

579
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,705
would lift you
off of your feet.

580
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,140
<i> And also there'd be
 so many players</i>

581
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,114
<i> and the sound would be
 so huge.</i>

582
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:37,723
I mean, it was definitely--
That wall of sound was really--

583
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:38,777
It was really there.

584
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,024
<i> I never was in the studio</i>

585
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,919
<i> that there were
 any different guys.</i>

586
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,521
it was the same guys always.

587
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,506
The "wall of sound" was
the Gold Star echo chambers,

588
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:04,939
- mainly.
- Well, it was wall-to-wall

589
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,814
- musicians first of all.
- Yeah, that's true.

590
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:09,682
Most people'd use
a four-piece rhythm section.

591
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:13,022
He had four guitars,
or six, or seven.

592
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,748
There were four pianos always,

593
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,964
one upright bass,
one fender bass.

594
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,657
I mean, it was only
one drums, usually.

595
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,529
Fifteen people playing
percussion instruments.

596
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,129
- In a very small room.
- Yeah.

597
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:26,661
Not a small room,
but an average room.

598
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:29,225
And a huge echo chamber
that Gold Star

599
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,465
was famous for,
that was the wall of sound.

600
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,700
Ceramic walls.

601
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,765
- One, two, three.

602
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,754
- Good.
- The wall of sound

603
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:46,849
of Phil Spector's
more like a lost feeling.

604
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,922
<i>it's heavy on You've Lost
 That Lovin' Feelin',</i>

605
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,792
and it was--
He used the echo so much,

606
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,692
and it was swimming
all the time.

607
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,763
In spite of the baffles,
we all leaked

608
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:59,532
into each other's mics,
just enough to give it

609
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:03,832
the combination of leakage
and echo, plus we were tired.

610
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:06,036
By the 30th take,
you're tired, you know.

611
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:10,038
So it had a real
relaxed feeling on his hits.

612
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:24,487
It's the most played song
of all time.

613
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,690
Oh, I believe it, yeah.

614
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,591
Most played record
of all time.

615
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:30,063
<i> They were the whole sound
 that Phillip had.</i>

616
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,962
<i> Phillip was also
 really, really superstitious,</i>

617
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,464
<i> and he didn't--
 He wanted those guys,</i>

618
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,425
<i> and he always wanted
 those guys, you know?</i>

619
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:39,204
He felt only secure when
he was playing with those guys.

620
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,905
Same musicians,
same engineers, same studio,

621
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:44,467
same, probably, brand of tape.

622
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:47,106
Yeah, probably.
- Um...

623
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,352
It was just a thing
that he figured if he didn't

624
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,349
do it that way,
it wouldn't be a hit.

625
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,792
- And he was probably right.
- He was probably right.

626
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:58,288
And we're grateful for that.

627
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,020
G-minor seventh.

628
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,985
You know, Phillip was walking
in a different universe

629
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:05,304
than everybody else. And so
in his mind, it was all him,

630
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,157
you know, and the guys
were just some sort of

631
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,666
an extension
of what he couldn't do.

632
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:13,398
Phil would never
record anything

633
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,935
for the first three hours.

634
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,140
I mean,
he worked these guys

635
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,911
so that they
weren't playing

636
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:21,981
individualistic.
They were too tired.

637
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:25,351
And so they just
melded into this--

638
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,181
this wall of sound.

639
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:30,246
Phil leaned on Howard
very, very heavy

640
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:34,656
about how to play, and just kept
on it, and on it, and on it.

641
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,260
And wasn't satisfied
or something,

642
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:39,362
and made 'em kept playing over,
and over, and over,

643
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,095
and over again for hours

644
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,940
until Howard's hands
were just a mass of pain.

645
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:49,068
"No, no, no, no, this way."
Howard says, "Look, man,

646
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,544
"if I can't play it,
and you know what it is,

647
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:53,984
why don't you play it?"

648
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:56,549
Howard Robert's the only guy
that I ever saw

649
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,878
walk out of a session,

650
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:01,254
where he just
put everything down,

651
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,053
picked up his guitar
and his amp,

652
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:06,316
and he walked out. He said,
"I've had enough of this."

653
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:09,255
He was very demanding.
I had no problem with Phil.

654
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,931
I guess it's because
he knew that I always knew

655
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,861
that I wasn't
the original drummer,

656
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:15,726
'cause if I'd have had
a problem, I'd walked out.

657
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,234
Who was he gonna get?

658
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:19,366
He'd already, you know,
had his argument with Al,

659
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,971
maybe Al wouldn't have
came back.

660
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:24,413
So-- So, we got along fine.

661
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,780
<i> They made fun of him
 all the time,</i>

662
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,008
<i> but they really liked him.</i>

663
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:28,552
I think they really
respected him.

664
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,407
They thought he was nuts,
which, of course, he was,

665
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,446
but I think they always
looked forward to it

666
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,121
because it was always gonna be
something really cool.

667
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,750
<i> It was like
 a total thing friendship too,</i>

668
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,655
<i> 'cause they would come in
and they would be talking about,</i>

669
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,387
<i> you know, "What'd you do
 on the golf course?"</i>

670
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,832
<i> or, you know, that someone
 had this car or so--</i>

671
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,358
<i> There was always
 a Mad magazine too,</i>

672
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,863
<i> being passed around that
 somebody brought, you know.</i>

673
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,427
<i> I was in awe of them
because of Phil Spector, that--</i>

674
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,966
<i> It took me a couple times
 to get used to,</i>

675
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,701
<i> you know, being with the guys,
 you know.</i>

676
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:55,536
<i>Any memories of Be My Baby
the first time you heard it?</i>

677
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,311
Oh, I pulled my car
over to the side of the road,

678
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,540
said, "What am I
listening to here," you know?

679
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,146
I couldn't believe it.

680
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,947
<i>I instantly wrote
 Don't Worry Baby</i>

681
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,419
after I heard that. Yeah.

682
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,117
I was so inspired.
I couldn't believe it.

683
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:49,031
<i>By the time we got
to River deep - Mountain High,</i>

684
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,128
we all thought that was gonna be
a giant of a hit.

685
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,760
It was another
wall of sound hit,

686
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:55,396
but it flopped.

687
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:58,771
It was a big hit in the U.K.,
but in the USA,

688
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,571
it was his first downer.

689
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:04,112
And it was like, "Okay,
that style is going then.

690
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:06,279
The wall of sound
was over then."

691
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,110
<i> One of the boys.
 One of the boys.</i>

692
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,476
<i>One of the guys, yeah.</i>

693
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,654
If sexual harassment suits
were in there, she'd be

694
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:17,223
- seven millionaires right now,

695
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,722
...after what we put
her through.

696
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,994
She'd have all the lawyers
working for-- Against us.

697
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,327
I don't think anyone
ever really felt

698
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,759
that she was a woman-woman, and
I don't mean that detrimentally.

699
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,165
- No, we were musicians.
- Yeah.

700
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,098
Everything was music--
music, really.

701
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:32,273
- Yeah.
- Worse than that

702
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,011
would have been...
shutting her out

703
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:37,067
and not sharing the camaraderie.

704
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:43,806
<i>Impossible
theme song)</i>

705
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,889
And this is the only one
I had to really palm mute

706
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,489
to get the treble out.

707
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,656
So you can hear that.
Yeah.

708
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,432
Anyway, that's what I did, yeah.

709
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,160
And it's Earl Palmer
on drums on that one.

710
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,466
<i> I heard music as a kid</i>

711
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,839
<i> because my mother was
 a professional piano player.</i>

712
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:08,438
She'd play in the back
of the silent movie houses.

713
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,370
And my dad was
a trombone player.

714
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,935
He played Dixieland bands,
things like that.

715
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,535
So I heard music all the time.

716
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,446
If they didn't fight,
they played music,

717
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,778
so you know-- you knew
where it was coming from.

718
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,719
<i> My mom and I were living
 in this housing project.</i>

719
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,322
But my mom saved up her pennies

720
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,524
<i> and there was a steel guitar
 salesman that came around.</i>

721
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:30,686
And about three or four lessons
for ten bucks,

722
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:33,826
so she opted for that.
And I was about 13 then.

723
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:37,502
About that time, I started
playing gigs on guitar.

724
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,665
And little Latin things.

725
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:44,073
<i> So it was a lot
of great experience, you know...</i>

726
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,006
...that kind of stuff,
heavy-duty jazz.

727
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,145
<i> And it was fun,
 and I was playing</i>

728
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,451
<i> a lot in the black clubs.</i>

729
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,252
<i> And very accepted too,
 by the way.</i>

730
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:57,094
<i> I had made a name for myself.</i>

731
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:59,459
There were a lot of women around
that played jazz

732
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,688
and were in pop bands
of their own,

733
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,333
so it wasn't that unusual.

734
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,298
<i> But most women
back in those days, in the '50s,</i>

735
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:08,568
<i> would play
 until they got married.</i>

736
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:12,767
it was more important to have
a "Mrs." in front of your name

737
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,271
than it was to have a career.

738
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:29,386
Then the chance came
to do studio work

739
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,888
in late 1957 for Sam Cooke.

740
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,120
And I'd never heard
of Sam Cooke,

741
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,715
but they were short
a guitar player.

742
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,556
As soon as I did
my first date with Sam Cooke,

743
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:40,403
I got more money
in three hours' work than I did

744
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,529
in a whole week's work
of my day job.

745
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,704
Except they've got
more than two dates a week.

746
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,573
They wanted
our particular group of people

747
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:53,183
to cut the hit records,
because we got good at it.

748
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:56,308
<i> Ray Pohlman had a great sound.</i>

749
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,945
<i> He was the very first
 electric bass player</i>

750
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,881
<i>playing hits from about '57 on.</i>

751
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:04,286
<i> I'd say that he did maybe
 85% of the hit records.</i>

752
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,159
But Ray Pohlman got to be
the musical conductor

753
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,789
<i>for the Shindig show
about the same time</i>

754
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:13,204
I accidentally got on bass,
so there was a big hole there.

755
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:15,298
<i> People ask me all the time
 about being a woman</i>

756
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,630
<i> in a man's world.</i>

757
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,795
<i> I felt equal
 with the rest of the guys,</i>

758
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,004
<i> and they felt it too.</i>

759
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,765
<i> Sometimes they got
 a little testy.</i>

760
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,743
<i> They'd say, "Oh, you play good
 for a girl, Carol."</i>

761
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,582
<i> "Yeah, you play good
 for a guy too."</i>

762
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,277
I love musicians
and the humor

763
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,580
and the way that they play.
And they all knew that.

764
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,682
And I think
it was like a sister--

765
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,654
having a sister there.

766
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:39,223
<i> I had my two kids and my mom
 to support by that time.</i>

767
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,894
We would do
three, four dates a day,

768
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:44,462
and I'd manage to get home
to have dinner with the kids.

769
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,333
That's the only thing I regret,
is that I didn't

770
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,731
spend more time with the kids.

771
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:50,973
But they were
very well taken care of,

772
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,869
and they had good lives,
you know.

773
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:57,141
Most of-- most of the time,
they were fine.

774
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,484
You know, after looking
at my father's work logs,

775
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,810
I came to realize
he wasn't around

776
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,845
as much as I thought he was.

777
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:09,851
But when he was home,
his focus was on his family.

778
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,768
He was one of the few
studio guys

779
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:25,198
who found a balance
between working crazy hours

780
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,903
and maintaining
a pretty decent home life.

781
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:34,906
The truth is,
I don't know how he did it.

782
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,750
Time was money,
and you wouldn't last long

783
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:44,150
in any studio
if you couldn't keep up.

784
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,616
The studio musicians
in this town

785
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:48,464
were really looked up to
and respected.

786
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,530
We were treated like...

787
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,259
"Our life depends on you guys."

788
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:53,634
Well, they were
real session players.

789
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:55,602
They were guys that were going
from gig to gig,

790
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,730
you know, playing
on all the good music.

791
00:38:57,736 --> 00:39:00,436
Gosh, there were
so many things went on

792
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,369
and we were so busy.

793
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,814
I mean, we would go from one
to the other to the other.

794
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:09,910
We used to call
going from session to session

795
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:11,045
"dovetailing."

796
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,279
Jesus,
when you leave the house

797
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:13,654
at 7:00 in the morning,

798
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,752
and you're at Universal
at 9:00 till noon.

799
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,954
Now you're at Capitol Records
at 1:00,

800
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:19,616
you just got time to get there,

801
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,864
and then you got a jingle
at 4:00,

802
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,600
and then we were on a date
with somebody at 8:00,

803
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:27,397
and then The Beach Boys
at midnight,

804
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:29,369
and you do that
five days a week...

805
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,098
Jeez, man, you get burned out.

806
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,643
At one time,
we did an album

807
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:34,837
in a day,
for Liberty Records.

808
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,380
Five, six weeks in a row,
we'd do an album a day--

809
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:41,077
six tunes in the morning
and six tunes in the evening.

810
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,779
When all the guys realized

811
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,781
that we were doing
most of the dates, said,

812
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:48,223
"We'll get scale,
or you'll get somebody else."

813
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,350
And, course, they didn't,

814
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,615
'cause that was
the tightest rhythm section

815
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,324
I believe I've ever played with.

816
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:40,901
I would not go
in a studio

817
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:45,436
if I didn't have Tommy Tedesco,
Hal Blaine,

818
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,114
people of that nature.

819
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:50,152
<i>I just wouldn't go into a studio
 until they weren't busy.</i>

820
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,778
<i>But they were busy all the time.</i>

821
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,423
No matter which producer
I worked with,

822
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:56,148
whether it was Lee Hazlewood
or Snuff Garrett,

823
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,794
they all used
the same musicians.

824
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,119
<i> They were all just the best.</i>

825
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,785
If they couldn't get the guys,
they didn't book the date.

826
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,404
They'd wait
until the guys were available.

827
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:06,727
Which was wonderful.

828
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,771
Of course, their wives
never saw them.

829
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,269
I don't know how those guys
could've worked any more,

830
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:16,541
unless they didn't sleep at all.

831
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,811
If you want to be successful
in this business,

832
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,580
you never say no until
you're too busy to say yes.

833
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,810
<i> And I learned that
 by watching guys</i>

834
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,445
<i> who talked themselves
 out of careers</i>

835
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,851
by saying,
"No, it's not good enough.

836
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:31,124
<i> I'm gonna wait till
 such-and-such and so-and-so."</i>

837
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,192
Because if you wait at home
for the phone to ring, it won't.

838
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,132
If you're
a freelance musician,

839
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,057
you can't turn nothing down,

840
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:40,433
because there's somebody
standing right behind you

841
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:43,402
who is salivating
to do this work.

842
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,601
One day, I get a call
from Ernie Freeman.

843
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:46,944
It was, like,
8:00 in the morning.

844
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:50,708
"Hi, Tom, I need
a guitar player here at United.

845
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:51,939
How long will it take you
to get there?"

846
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,513
I said, "20 minutes,"
which, you know,

847
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:54,812
is a lie.
It's gonna take an hour.

848
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,813
But once I made
my commitment, they've got

849
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,105
- to wait for me, right?
- That's right.

850
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,776
When I go up there,
I did my date, and he loved it.

851
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,445
And then he tells me,
"You won't believe

852
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:03,554
what Bill Pitman said.

853
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:05,455
"I called bill and asked him,

854
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:06,757
'Can you come down?
I'm stuck.

855
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,588
How long will it be?'
And Bill says,

856
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:10,863
'Well, I'm having breakfast.
I should be finished

857
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:15,432
in about 45 minutes,
and I'll be there in an hour.'"

858
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:18,503
And if anybody ever
figured Bill Pitman out,

859
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:22,143
that was a Bill Pitman--
straight life, not thinking.

860
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,380
And I'm the opposite, like,
"What will work right now?"

861
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,738
<i> Now it's time
 for another take</i>

862
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:29,946
<i> of what probably will be
 another smash hit</i>

863
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:32,618
<i> in the wondrous world
 of Sonny and Cher.</i>

864
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:35,177
<i> Sonny himself writes
 most of the songs</i>

865
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:36,986
<i> he and Cher record.</i>

866
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,788
<i> Musicians often work
 with the couple,</i>

867
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,090
<i> and they're excellent
 sight readers.</i>

868
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:44,893
<i> Today, they're recording
 several songs</i>

869
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,626
<i> that will be part
 of an album called</i>

870
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:49,501
The Wondrous World
of Sonny & Cher,

871
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:52,271
<i> the second album
 they've made together.</i>

872
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,200
<i> Now they're ready to record.</i>

873
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,206
<i> The engineer is set...</i>

874
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,508
<i> and they call, "Take one."</i>

875
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:01,311
Were you ever intimidated
by the guys?

876
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:02,813
No, I was too stupid to know.

877
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:05,114
<i> Well, I was kind of shy
 of everybody.</i>

878
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,846
First of all, they were
a lot older than me too.

879
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:08,381
I mean, the first time--
session I went to,

880
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:10,416
I was 16 years old,
and I didn't--

881
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:11,962
I'd never been
inside a recording studio.

882
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:13,487
<i> You know, I just didn't want
 to step</i>

883
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:14,761
<i> any place I wasn't
 supposed to step,</i>

884
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,359
<i>which I thought was everywhere.</i>

885
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:18,361
<i> And they all knew each other,
 they were really relaxed.</i>

886
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:19,763
<i> I mean, everybody
 was nice to me.</i>

887
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,374
I really don't think I knew
for a long time

888
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:23,797
just how great they were.

889
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:26,872
And then later,
when I would meet other players

890
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,641
who would ask me, you know,
did I--

891
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,940
Was I ever on a session
with any of these guys?

892
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,575
There was a lot of honesty
in those records

893
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:38,251
and that's why
a lot of 'em were hits.

894
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:41,449
When I thought of the music,
I thought I was a 13-year-old

895
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:43,523
trying to learn
how to play music.

896
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,951
Every time I'd play.
You know,

897
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,186
there was all them hits
that was on--

898
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:49,131
The Marketts, Routers,
all them solos. And then,

899
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,987
- I brought myself back.
- Tongue in cheek.

900
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:53,256
I said,
"How would a kid play this,

901
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:55,734
that's so stupid, that
doesn't know what he's doing,

902
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:57,834
and play that?"
I did that shit,

903
00:43:57,836 --> 00:43:59,796
didn't know what I was doing,
bending notes,

904
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,314
didn't care, didn't--
Awful, out of tune.

905
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:03,667
- Yeah.
- What is this tune?

906
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:05,235
- Beatles? Cockroaches?
- Some young group.

907
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:06,513
- I had no idea.
- Cockroaches.

908
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:07,841
I didn't know
them kind of names then.

909
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:10,246
Well, my personal feeling
about the music

910
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:11,708
was that it was all wonderful

911
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:14,276
and I was making
millions of dollars...

912
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:15,845
period.

913
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:17,654
<i> I didn't give a damn
 if Tommy liked it or not.</i>

914
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:19,086
<i> I didn't make it for him.</i>

915
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,360
<i> Like the artist.</i>

916
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:21,688
Cher said she didn't like it.

917
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:23,263
Well, I didn't make it
for her anyway.

918
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,291
I made it for people to buy,

919
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,095
not for Cher to listen to.

920
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:28,127
<i>She never listened
to Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves</i>

921
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:32,573
or any other record
I made with her... again.

922
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,400
<i> It was Diamond Ring.</i>

923
00:44:34,406 --> 00:44:35,666
We cut that record,
and I said,

924
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:38,044
"Oh, my God. I hate this shit."

925
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:41,783
Two weeks later,
it was number ten or something.

926
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,350
So I have to give it to Snuff
in terms of

927
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,220
a certain kind of pop awareness.

928
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:52,459
He had it, but it was not
exactly my cup of tea.

929
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:55,157
The music that we cut
in the '60s,

930
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,730
nobody thought that was gonna
last, like, past ten years.

931
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,060
In fact, Bill Pitman says--

932
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,765
We were doing a
chugga-chugga-chugga date,

933
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:05,197
he says,
"Can you see the kids

934
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,203
dancing with their wives
20 years from now,

935
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,265
saying, 'Darling,
they're playing our song'?"

936
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:11,914
I remember coming home
from a session one day,

937
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,740
and it was just one
of those three-chord sessions.

938
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:16,576
And when you're sitting there
playing rhythm guitar,

939
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:17,951
there's not much you can do.

940
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,579
You just do it, get your money
and go home.

941
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,924
And I remember coming home,
and I was not in a good mood.

942
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,790
I said to my wife, "I could do
this when I was 14 years old."

943
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,760
And she said, "Yeah,
but not nearly as well."

944
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,990
I didn't care
for rock and roll that much.

945
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:33,055
I was basically
a jazz drummer.

946
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,134
But I realized that I'm
making my living off of it.

947
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:36,873
If I'm gonna continue
to do that,

948
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,938
I got to play that
like that's my favorite music.

949
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:41,167
<i> That's not professionalism
 to me.</i>

950
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:43,712
<i> It's not beneath you
 if it's supporting you.</i>

951
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,938
<i> If it's beneath you,
 don't play it.</i>

952
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:47,914
I actually enjoyed it,

953
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,982
because when I heard the records
on the radio,

954
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:52,351
I realized, really,
what an incredible sound

955
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,080
that group of people had.

956
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:46,096
We're going
up to Capitol Records

957
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:48,104
- right up here.
- Oh, right.

958
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:50,266
God, the streets
are so friggin' torn up,

959
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:51,535
it's unbelievable.

960
00:46:51,543 --> 00:46:53,143
This is where
we used to do all of,

961
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,884
you know,
Glen Campbell's records

962
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:58,479
and Ray Anthony
and everybody, man.

963
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,253
Peggy Lee, Nat King Cole.

964
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,722
We did everyone
down in the bowels.

965
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:05,791
Pretty amazing.

966
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,160
As soon as we got
in those studios

967
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,188
and we found out
that this made a lot of bucks,

968
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:11,864
it was like, "Hey, man,
we don't have to go on the road.

969
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:13,603
We can stay home
with our kids," you know.

970
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:15,358
Unfortunately, I didn't.

971
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:17,226
I went through six wives.

972
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,640
Yeah, but that was 'cause
of your personality...

973
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,309
...not your playing.

974
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:27,308
No, I had two major marriages,
and they both fell apart

975
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:29,882
because I was in the studio
too much.

976
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:31,411
I think
it's a very hard balance.

977
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:32,746
Yeah, it was tough.

978
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,119
<i> When I got out of the army,
 I took my G.I. bill,</i>

979
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:40,221
<i> went to Chicago,
went to a percussion institute.</i>

980
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:42,525
I was going to school
from about 8:00 in the morning

981
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:47,227
to 4:00 in the afternoon. And
then I was playing strip clubs

982
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:50,472
from about 8:00 at night to
4:00 in the morning,

983
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:52,098
which was pretty wild.

984
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:55,943
But it was great
sight reading training.

985
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:59,110
You got all these new women
coming and dancing,

986
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,140
throwing this music at you,

987
00:48:01,145 --> 00:48:04,605
and you got to, you know,
read it immediately.

988
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:16,260
It was great training
to relax you and to play,

989
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:18,431
because to this day,
I could sit down,

990
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,799
you can throw any kind of music
in front of me,

991
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:22,628
and I will--
You know, it might be

992
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:25,844
the hardest thing in the world,
but I'll be completely relaxed.

993
00:48:25,837 --> 00:48:28,797
Nobody will know that inside,
I'm saying,

994
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:30,406
"Holy cow, this is
really something."

995
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,478
<i> So there was a lot of great
 basic training going on</i>

996
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:36,948
<i> while I was there,
 which really was preparing me</i>

997
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:37,978
<i> for the studios.</i>

998
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:46,158
I wound up at "the" nightclub
in Hollywood,

999
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,587
where all the movie stars
hung out.

1000
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:51,693
There was a manager,
called me over one evening,

1001
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:54,196
and he said,
"Look, I've got a kid

1002
00:48:54,198 --> 00:48:57,998
who's gonna be signed
by Capital Records pretty quick,

1003
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:59,602
and we need a drummer."

1004
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:03,474
This kid's name was Tommy Sands,
a wonderful young man,

1005
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:07,514
became a major teenage idol,
and we went on the road.

1006
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:10,152
But it was during that time
that I was with Tommy

1007
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:13,248
that I got to work with people
like The Diamonds,

1008
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:16,991
who were really hot
in those days. The Platters.

1009
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:19,788
These were shows
that I was playing.

1010
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,491
<i> Great experience. And now
 I was learning rock and roll,</i>

1011
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:26,704
<i> which was still a dirty word
 to most of the musicians.</i>

1012
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,036
<i> When I got back to L.A.,</i>

1013
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:43,154
<i> there was a man
 by the name of H.B. Barnum.</i>

1014
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:48,947
And H.B. started using me,
Carol Kaye on bass,

1015
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,693
and Glen Campbell on guitar.

1016
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:54,788
There were a bunch of us that
were sort of demo musicians,

1017
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,462
but we played rock and roll.

1018
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:59,061
Usually, every guy that sat
down in one of those sessions

1019
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:01,633
in that group
was a great musician:

1020
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:07,072
studied, practiced, taught well,
loved what they were doing.

1021
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:08,871
Everybody wanted us.

1022
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:23,018
<i>Do you remember when my dad
was doing the Jobim album?</i>

1023
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:24,221
Oh, yeah.

1024
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:27,562
And all of the "A" team
was in.

1025
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:33,398
<i>And at the end of that session,
we were doing S omethin' Stupid.</i>

1026
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:37,228
And the "A" team left,
and our little "B" team came in,

1027
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:39,635
The Wrecking Crew
came in and sat down,

1028
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:42,767
and we cut a number on record.

1029
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:44,214
And what most people
don't realize,

1030
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:47,078
that was our dad's
first number one record.

1031
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:49,478
And we just marched
on in there

1032
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,080
and made our little hit.

1033
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:53,022
<i>- Daddy.
- Sorry.</i>

1034
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,694
<i> I've got to sing
 a little louder then.</i>

1035
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:04,633
<i>-  You have to sing--
-  You too, you sing</i>

1036
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:08,129
<i> I did Somethin' Stupid
 with Frank and Nancy Sinatra.</i>

1037
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:10,472
<i> And that little lick
 that I played on the intro,</i>

1038
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:12,868
<i> I had already played that
 on another record of the song</i>

1039
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:16,170
by the guy that wrote it,
Carson Parks.

1040
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:21,814
And Frank heard it and wanted
that very lick on the intro.

1041
00:51:21,813 --> 00:51:23,483
<i> Billy Strange was the arranger</i>

1042
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,381
<i> and the guitars were me
 and Glen Campbell.</i>

1043
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:28,323
<i> And Billy had just written,
 like, El Paso style guitar</i>

1044
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,949
<i> for the intro.
 So Glenn, of course,</i>

1045
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:31,294
<i> played something real nice,
 but it wasn't</i>

1046
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:33,319
<i>what was on the original record.
 And Frank said,</i>

1047
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:34,964
<i> "No, that's not it,
 that's not it. Let's try it--"</i>

1048
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:36,229
So Glenn tried something else

1049
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:38,327
and Frank wasn't
real happy with it

1050
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,999
'cause it didn't sound
like we'd heard.

1051
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:41,497
So finally, after a while,
I said, "Glenn,

1052
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:42,999
I don't want to be pushy
or anything,

1053
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,370
but that's me
on the original record.

1054
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:46,068
I know exactly what he wants."

1055
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,440
He said,
"Well, then you play it."

1056
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,168
Then, we switched parts real
fast and I played it.

1057
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:50,543
<i> Do you want to hear
 the guitars</i>

1058
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:51,711
<i> just to make sure
 everything's cool?</i>

1059
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:53,079
<i> One real fast start,
 then we'll go.</i>

1060
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:54,207
<i> All right, letter "A."</i>

1061
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:58,981
<i>- That did it, all right.
- Pretty sound.</i>

1062
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:00,383
<i> Yeah, that's the whole trick
 of the record.</i>

1063
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,283
Chuck Berghofer,
who was the star,

1064
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:36,253
you know, that bass line became
infam-- As a matter of fact,

1065
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:38,994
it's probably-- Simple
as it sounds, it's probably

1066
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,560
one of the hardest things
a bass player ever has to do.

1067
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,959
- Nobody can do it.
- They never do it correctly,

1068
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:45,561
you know, or they make
an attempt at it.

1069
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:47,203
The engineer came out
and said,

1070
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:48,758
"Gee, I love the sound
of your bass."

1071
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,866
He says, "I'm gonna
give your name to my friend."

1072
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:52,698
And it turned out
to be Jim Bowen.

1073
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:56,043
And I wound up doing some dates
for Jim Bowen.

1074
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,970
<i>About the third date, I did
was B oots Are Made For Walking.</i>

1075
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:01,136
<i> And that put me on the map.</i>

1076
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:03,375
<i> I went from doing two dates
 in my life</i>

1077
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:05,051
<i> to doing three a day.</i>

1078
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:07,649
Yeah, if I wasn't available
that day,

1079
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:10,492
I'd probably be selling
insurance somewhere.

1080
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:14,158
That "chunk-a-chunk-a-chunk,"
that rhythm chunky sound

1081
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:16,928
that was so--
Lee used to call it "dumb."

1082
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:19,498
He wanted that dumb sound.

1083
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:21,357
It really made--
made the records,

1084
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,225
and it's very hard to capture,
especially live.

1085
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,140
<i> Lee didn't want me
 to do the song.</i>

1086
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:36,545
I kept saying, "I want to do
that boots thing,

1087
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,347
that one about the boots."
And he said, "No,

1088
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,019
it's not a girl's song.
I said,

1089
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:42,347
"Well, it's certainly not
a guy's song."

1090
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,793
He used to sing it live
in his performances.

1091
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:49,430
And I said, "It's wrong
for a man to sing it.

1092
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:52,187
It's harsh and abusive,

1093
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:55,056
but it's perfect for
a little girl to sing."

1094
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,653
The feeling of a live session
was unlike anything else

1095
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:12,447
because you'd hear it back
instantly, and there it was.

1096
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:15,550
And it was either magic
or it wasn't magic.

1097
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:19,153
And I never will forget,
when I drove to Las Vegas,

1098
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:22,386
on the marquee, it says,
"Nancy Sinatra

1099
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:24,793
With Hal Blaine On Drums."
This big marquee

1100
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:27,055
all over the thing,
at Caesars Palace.

1101
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:31,174
Now, he's making
like $2,500 a week.

1102
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:34,198
Now, Irv Cottler's work
with Frank, the father,

1103
00:54:34,205 --> 00:54:36,265
- he's making $750 a week.

1104
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:37,714
- And I--
- Who said life was fair?

1105
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,878
Oh, my God in hell--
And then, all of a sudden,

1106
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:42,137
here's this "Hal Blaine."
And I just laughed.

1107
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:45,106
"Hal Blaine"
all over the Caesar's marquee.

1108
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,346
- It was great.
- What a gig.

1109
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,550
You got to get it
when you can.

1110
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,070
<i> I didn't realize it
 until later,</i>

1111
00:55:44,075 --> 00:55:47,605
<i>but New Orleans was a great town
 for a musician to grow up in.</i>

1112
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:51,381
My brother and I were 12 and 13,

1113
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:57,352
and we already had gigs
on the Mardi Gras floats.

1114
00:55:57,355 --> 00:56:01,085
Not gigs, one gig.

1115
00:56:01,092 --> 00:56:03,032
<i> My mother was a singer
 and a pianist.</i>

1116
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:08,057
And the city was raging with
soldiers, sailors, and marines

1117
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:11,325
coming through there to get
shipped out to World War II.

1118
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:13,395
<i> And the clubs
 in the French Quarter,</i>

1119
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:15,804
<i>they were making a lot of money</i>

1120
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:17,266
<i> and they were hiring
 a lot of bands.</i>

1121
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:19,074
My mother had a job
in the afternoon

1122
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:23,076
playing and singing a matinee,

1123
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,880
and my father had a night gig.

1124
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,782
And I think it was the first
time in their life

1125
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:33,185
that they were fully employed
as musicians.

1126
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,530
I went to a black
Catholic high school,

1127
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:41,528
and all the public schools
were segregated.

1128
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:45,032
I couldn't wait to get away.

1129
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:48,195
<i> My brother and I
 soon established a band,</i>

1130
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,505
<i> you know. He played piano.</i>

1131
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:54,307
He mostly played blues
and boogie and--

1132
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:56,511
We wanted to play be-bop,
but really,

1133
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:59,684
nobody wanted to hear it.

1134
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:02,653
People always tell me
how great I was and, you know,

1135
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:04,723
"That boy's really
going places," and--

1136
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:08,622
of course I believed that.

1137
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,628
In 1954, my brother and I
moved down to Los Angeles

1138
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:24,136
and proceeded to starve
around town for about two years,

1139
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:25,641
made all the jam sessions.

1140
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,313
That's what you do
when you're new in town.

1141
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:30,881
And that sooner or later
gets you work

1142
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:33,751
because the band leaders
come to the jam sessions

1143
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:37,721
looking for horn players
or rhythm players.

1144
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:40,891
<i>And that's where they found 'em,
 at the jam sessions.</i>

1145
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,831
The rock and roll thing
was getting really big,

1146
00:57:42,827 --> 00:57:46,527
and they needed
the kind of horn I play.

1147
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:49,360
So it was really being
in the right place

1148
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:53,136
at the right time.

1149
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,382
<i>Particularly when I got
on the Merv Griffin Show,</i>

1150
00:58:05,382 --> 00:58:07,882
which started
at 3:00 in the afternoon.

1151
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:10,745
Well, that's the time
my kids came home from school.

1152
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:15,164
And it ended at 8:30 at night,
and I'd get home maybe 9:30.

1153
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:17,189
<i> Well, that's the time
 my kids would go to bed .</i>

1154
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:20,164
<i> Many days,
 I didn't see my kids.</i>

1155
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:26,603
<i> I'm a better grandfather
 than I was a father.</i>

1156
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:42,889
That's great.

1157
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:45,787
Oh, amazing.

1158
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:48,759
I remember taking
this picture.

1159
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:51,359
I took it through a record,
through a 45.

1160
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,462
These were all yours.
Hey, that's nice.

1161
00:58:53,464 --> 00:58:54,834
<i> Yeah.</i>

1162
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:57,472
<i> The first band I had
 was just an experiment.</i>

1163
00:58:57,468 --> 00:58:59,698
We opened the show
for Dave Brubeck,

1164
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:04,643
and people went crazy for the--
our, you know, half hour set,

1165
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:08,142
however long we played.
And I remember coming offstage,

1166
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:14,045
and Paul Desmond was--
was standing off to the side.

1167
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,551
And as I passed him,
he was scratching his head,

1168
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,394
and said, "I don't know
what I just heard,

1169
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:23,260
but I think I like it."

1170
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,530
That was the first cue I had

1171
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:26,558
that maybe we were
on to something.

1172
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:29,504
A jazz musician loved it...
or liked it.

1173
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,730
The first date I ever did
for Herb Alpert,

1174
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,335
Shorty Rogers called me up
and says,

1175
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:34,797
"Bill, would you do me a favor?"

1176
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:37,065
He says, "There's a guy,
he's a friend of mine."

1177
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,514
He says, "He's a trumpet player
and he doesn't have any money.

1178
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,140
Would you do it
as a favor for me?"

1179
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:42,605
I said, "Sure, I'll do it."

1180
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:45,153
Herb gave us each 15 bucks.
It was a scab date.

1181
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:48,179
- Oh, well, most of 'em were...
- Right, yeah.

1182
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:50,115
When we first started
way back then, you know.

1183
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,960
- Right. It was $15.
- Two for a quarter.

1184
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:55,287
- Yeah, two for 25.

1185
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,862
<i>And that was The Lonely Bull.</i>

1186
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:05,265
That was the first huge hit
that Herb Alpert ever had.

1187
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:06,639
It was huge!

1188
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:08,197
He became a millionaire
on that one record.

1189
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:11,935
And you know what he did?
He went to the union,

1190
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,082
said what he did,
paid the union fine,

1191
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:17,408
and then had checks sent
to all the musicians for scale,

1192
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:22,624
that-- that they were supposed
to have gotten and didn't.

1193
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,250
<i>A signature moment
in A Taste of Honey</i>

1194
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:27,094
is when the bass drum
is knocking four to the floor.

1195
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:29,961
We didn't have a way
to get back to the time

1196
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,700
without, you know, a count off.
And Hal, you know, said,

1197
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:35,927
"Let me just hit the drum,
the bass drum.

1198
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:38,103
Everyone will know
when to come in."

1199
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:44,239
Larry Levine thought--
The engineer,

1200
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:46,211
that we should keep that,
and it was, you know,

1201
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:48,380
one of the things that people
remember about the record.

1202
01:00:48,379 --> 01:00:52,549
And it became kind of
a trademark of the T.J.B.S.

1203
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:54,219
It was all because

1204
01:00:54,218 --> 01:00:56,918
these professional musicians
couldn't come in together.

1205
01:01:02,593 --> 01:01:04,993
<i> I met Julius in high school.</i>

1206
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,255
We started playing a song
and he took a solo,

1207
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:08,604
and I thought,
"Wow, man,

1208
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:10,799
this guy sounds
like Lionel Hampton."

1209
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,471
<i>He wrote Spanish Flea,</i>

1210
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,939
although his first title
was "Spanish Fly,"

1211
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:16,908
and I said, "I-- I don't know,
I'm not sure--

1212
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:21,637
I'm not so sure
that title's gonna work.

1213
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,189
You know, when The T.J.B.
became famous

1214
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:39,162
and he had to create a group
to go on the road,

1215
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:41,433
none of the studio musicians
would do it

1216
01:01:41,432 --> 01:01:43,632
because they were too busy.

1217
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:46,904
We did 13 albums,
and this was something

1218
01:01:46,904 --> 01:01:49,204
that bothered me my whole life,
my whole career.

1219
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,036
We'd come back to town,
and I would call

1220
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:55,411
guys like Lou and Hal.
And the guys on the road...

1221
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,452
Yeah, were really upset.

1222
01:01:57,448 --> 01:01:59,878
They were a little offended
that they were not used,

1223
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,723
but you know,
recording musicians had

1224
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:06,149
a certain sound
that was important to get.

1225
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:11,289
<i> No matter what shape
 your stomach's in,</i>

1226
01:02:11,295 --> 01:02:14,255
<i> when it gets out of shape,
 take Alka-Seltzer.</i>

1227
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:17,074
I saw a commercial,
and I thought it was a smash.

1228
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:20,137
I called Dave Pell,
who was my supervisor,

1229
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,137
and I said, "What instrumental
groups do we have here?"

1230
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:25,639
And he said, "Well, we have
a name called The T-Bones."

1231
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,612
And I say, "All right."
So I got Tommy Tedesco

1232
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:29,811
and the boys,
in the studio we went,

1233
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:32,213
<i>and we did No Matter What Shape."</i>

1234
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:34,746
And that was the number-one
instrumental of the year.

1235
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:35,782
<i> The T-Bones!</i>

1236
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:49,663
 )

1237
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,210
What is their name,
"Willy Vanelli"

1238
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,078
- or what the hell the shit is?
- Milli--

1239
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:02,037
- They had nothing over us....
- Right.

1240
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,775
...right?
We did that all the time.

1241
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:06,311
I wanted The Marketts to be
like a working group.

1242
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:10,386
And, you know, if the public
knew it wasn't so,

1243
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:14,957
it would be like a
"Mini Vanilli" or whatever.

1244
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:28,238
I think it's a little
different when you're a

1245
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:31,568
horn player and you're asked
to play the introduction

1246
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:34,235
- and play the first chorus...
- I can understand that.

1247
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:37,954
...and play the first solo, and
then play the fade on the end.

1248
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:40,978
And the damn thing comes on and
it doesn't have your name on it.

1249
01:03:47,558 --> 01:03:52,028
<i> Surfer's Stomp-- Plas Johnson
was the lead saxophonist,</i>

1250
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:55,129
and I said, "Plas, how about
calling it The Plas Johnson?"

1251
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:57,032
And he's says, "no,"
he says,

1252
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:58,874
"I don't want to be associated
with that type of music."

1253
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:01,539
I mean, he was a much better
player than that,

1254
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,868
but it became a hit and so we
call it The Marketts.

1255
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:05,544
And then I start getting calls.

1256
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:09,182
<i>So, the song writer, who
co-wrote S urfer's Stomp with me</i>

1257
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,449
called Mike Gordon,
he got a group together,

1258
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:12,608
went on the road.

1259
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:14,116
Worse than not getting
the money,

1260
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:17,847
is to have-- to played on a hit
record which sold

1261
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:20,415
a million copies, and not even
have your name on them.

1262
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:24,034
And they go dig some white kids
up out of high school

1263
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:28,327
and put them on the road
and call them the name.

1264
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:30,172
And it was quite easy
for the producers

1265
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:33,097
and the companies to hire us to
read this music.

1266
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:35,273
And play these things down,
in three hours

1267
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:37,372
and get out of that studio
in three hours

1268
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,884
than to have them come and spend
three weeks doing it.

1269
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:43,547
We would either augment
or totally replace a group.

1270
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:48,747
We do a new group, say
The Association, for instance.

1271
01:04:48,752 --> 01:04:50,822
<i> None of them played
 on the record.</i>

1272
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:52,721
<i> We replaced the entire group.</i>

1273
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:08,503
<i>Well, these are the guys that
played on Windy</i>

1274
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:11,035
<i>and Never My Love and
 Everything That Touches You.</i>

1275
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:14,611
And all the things that were
in those two albums

1276
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:17,951
that I did with them, those are
all those studio musicians.

1277
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:21,318
<i>It's Al, Joe, Larry, Tommy and--
 and those guys.</i>

1278
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:23,848
I wanted to put their names
on the back of the album

1279
01:05:23,854 --> 01:05:26,324
when it was finished
and they wouldn't let me

1280
01:05:26,323 --> 01:05:29,063
because they said, "Well, we
don't want those kids out there

1281
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,689
that buy our records to know
that we didn't

1282
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,364
play on the record."

1283
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:35,762
<i> I went out and took Brian's
 place with The Beach Boys.</i>

1284
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:39,266
And I can understand that
probably why Brian had studio

1285
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:44,669
guys come in, because they would
fight like cats and dogs, man.

1286
01:05:44,675 --> 01:05:48,235
<i>Rather than Brian to go through
 the hassle to get the tracks,</i>

1287
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:51,675
<i>he would hire the rhythm section
 to come in and do the tracks.</i>

1288
01:05:51,682 --> 01:05:54,452
<i>One of the guys-- At first they
 were a little jealous,</i>

1289
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,381
<i> you know what I mean?
But I explained to them, I said,</i>

1290
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:59,646
<i> "You know, I want to get the
 best I can get for the group."</i>

1291
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:02,116
And they go, "Well, I can
understand your point, Brian,"

1292
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,685
you know.
So we went ahead and did it,

1293
01:06:04,695 --> 01:06:08,055
and sure enough,
the guys liked it.

1294
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:11,025
I mean, that's one of the most
asked questions,

1295
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:13,304
"Well, didn't Dennis get mad,
wasn't he mad

1296
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,603
because you were doing
The Beach Boys records?"

1297
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:20,705
Dennis did not have the studio
chops that we have, you know.

1298
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:22,741
The proof of the pudding
is that Dennis

1299
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:26,206
called me to do his album when
Dennis did his solo album.

1300
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:27,846
I played the drums on that.

1301
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:30,551
A lot of times the guys would
be sitting around the studio,

1302
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:32,454
we didn't know they were the
guys in the band.

1303
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:35,416
The guitar players that were
in these various groups,

1304
01:06:35,425 --> 01:06:37,455
when they realized guys like
Tommy Tedesco

1305
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:40,001
was gonna be playing, they
wanted to sit around and watch.

1306
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:41,197
And the drummers would want
to sit around

1307
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:42,698
and watch myself or Al.

1308
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:44,569
<i> They were there, like, more or
 less they were learning.</i>

1309
01:06:44,568 --> 01:06:46,798
You know, it would be something
that I'd like to see too

1310
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:48,273
if it had been
the other way around.

1311
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:50,211
<i> Terry Melcher wanted to use
 session musicians</i>

1312
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,767
<i> for Mr. Tambourine Man.</i>

1313
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,375
I'd been a studio musician
in New York,

1314
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:55,737
prior to being in The Byrds,
so...

1315
01:06:55,746 --> 01:06:57,106
they let me play on it.

1316
01:06:57,114 --> 01:06:59,014
So my feeling was,
"Great. I get to play

1317
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:00,846
with this great band,
The Wrecking Crew."

1318
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:02,551
Of course, the other guys,
David Crosby,

1319
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:05,852
Michael Clark and
Chris Hellman, were livid.

1320
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:07,016
They hated the idea because

1321
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:08,294
they didn't get to play
on their own record.

1322
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:10,561
We got a number one hit with it,
right off the bat.

1323
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,530
But we knocked out two tracks
in one three-hour session.

1324
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,860
To compare that with what
happened when the rest

1325
01:07:15,866 --> 01:07:18,566
of the band got to play,
it took us 77 takes

1326
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:21,968
<i>to get the band track for
 Turn, Turn, Turn,</i>

1327
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:23,712
which was also a number one.

1328
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:09,075
People assume that just
because my dad made his living

1329
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,616
playing guitar, I can also play.

1330
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:14,521
For me, and some of the other
kids of studio musicians,

1331
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:16,524
we didn't take it up
as a profession.

1332
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:19,486
What my father did teach us
was common sense.

1333
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:21,296
<i> I got called
 many years ago.</i>

1334
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:23,828
I show up on this date and now
there's 70 musicians

1335
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:25,304
sitting there.
And I'm looking

1336
01:08:25,302 --> 01:08:28,242
and I say, "70 musicians?
Wow. Where do I sit?"

1337
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:29,968
And they said, "Over there.
There's the guitar."

1338
01:08:29,973 --> 01:08:32,143
You know, I sit there
and I look at a part.

1339
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:35,742
The only problem is starting at
bar 95, you know,

1340
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:37,005
and all the rest, rest.

1341
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:38,953
Now the guy starts, right.

1342
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,449
And you know what this is to me
at the time.

1343
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,180
This is in a nightclub, you
know, you see a chick,

1344
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:44,245
"Hey, there she is.
Hey, hey--"

1345
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:46,524
When he did this and there was
no music, I said,

1346
01:08:46,523 --> 01:08:48,563
"Oh-oh, they're at bar 95,
I knew it."

1347
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:51,188
"Guitar. Where's the guitar?"
"Over here."

1348
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:52,294
"We're at 95,
I didn't hear you."

1349
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:53,655
"Oh, okay," you know.

1350
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:58,233
- One, two, three, four,

1351
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:00,665
"Okay, forget it.
Let's go from 96.

1352
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:03,000
And they have somebody come in
the next day to do it."

1353
01:09:03,006 --> 01:09:05,836
Elvis Presley came back there
a few years

1354
01:09:05,842 --> 01:09:08,212
and I started getting hot
in records, and Elvis

1355
01:09:08,211 --> 01:09:10,281
started using me when he'd come
to the coast for movies.

1356
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,010
So nobody told Elvis who to use.

1357
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:16,175
To that day I never knew if they
knew I was the same guy, though.

1358
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:17,846
But I wasn't about to tell them,
"Remember me?

1359
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:20,494
About three years--"
Oh, no, no, no.

1360
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,060
You see, the one thing I have,
common sense.

1361
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:26,289
I studied common sense more
than I did guitar.

1362
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,467
In the '60s,
The Wrecking Crew played

1363
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:39,214
on thousands of recordings,

1364
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:41,409
but you would never
have known it.

1365
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:44,911
Producers made a big mistake
when they didn't put

1366
01:09:44,915 --> 01:09:47,175
the credits on the back
of the albums

1367
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:49,084
of all the people that have
played on the albums.

1368
01:09:49,085 --> 01:09:52,315
<i> Not only did they deserve it,
 but I think it was misleading.</i>

1369
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:54,962
Maybe one of the reasons they
left the names off was

1370
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:58,058
the same musicians played on so
many people's records

1371
01:09:58,061 --> 01:10:00,061
it would have been an
embarrassment if anybody

1372
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:01,733
had ever listed them.

1373
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:04,301
I was used to it
'cause when a guy hired me

1374
01:10:04,301 --> 01:10:07,071
with his last $25
and he had a bomb,

1375
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,340
I never gave him his
money back, you know.

1376
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:11,369
So I really treated it
as a business

1377
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:14,984
and I understand how you
feel too. But I just felt,

1378
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:17,548
"Just give me my money
and I get lost."

1379
01:10:25,522 --> 01:10:29,062
<i> Snuffy always let myself
 and The Playboys</i>

1380
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:30,959
<i> lay down all the basic tracks.</i>

1381
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:34,561
<i> And then Snuff said,
 "Now we're gonna sweeten it,</i>

1382
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:37,174
<i> do some overdubs and stuff,
 and I'm gonna bring in</i>

1383
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,627
<i>the people that I want to use ."</i>

1384
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:42,265
And I had no experience in this,
and Snuffy had.

1385
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,942
So I said,
"Well, great.

1386
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,440
If you think that's the way to
do it, let's do it."

1387
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:50,713
The drummer came in, but
Snuffy let him, you know,

1388
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:53,114
play some kind of percussion
like a tambourine

1389
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:56,246
so it could say,
"Gary Lewis and The Playboys."

1390
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:59,153
But it was really studio guys
that made the track.

1391
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:03,455
And I remember my guitar
player and our keyboard player,

1392
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:06,690
after hearing the session
musicians coming in

1393
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:09,556
and putting down the parts,
you know, they were saying,

1394
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:12,666
"Oh, my God, I never could have
done anything like that."

1395
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:15,399
<i> I'll never forget working
with Gary Lewis and The Playboys</i>

1396
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:17,235
<i> - doing all that record.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

1397
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,680
And I'll never forget I had
one real, real hot lick

1398
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:25,348
on this one record-- Spanish
stuff all over the place.

1399
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:37,360
And finally, his guitar player
come up to me, he says,

1400
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,690
"You drove me crazy
with that thing.

1401
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:42,826
First of all, I can't play it,
so I don't play it.

1402
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:45,902
And then, everybody comes up to
me, complimenting me

1403
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,502
on what I did on the thing."

1404
01:11:47,504 --> 01:11:49,444
I said, "Well, just take the
compliments and forget it."

1405
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:53,209
So, while my guitar players
played a much simplified

1406
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:56,239
version of it, because nobody
could play that.

1407
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:03,951
That was inside stuff.

1408
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:06,893
I think that the public at large
was oblivious to the fact

1409
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:10,590
that there was a secret star
maker machinery,

1410
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:14,403
that a very important component
of that were these teams,

1411
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:17,067
like hitmen, studio hitmen.

1412
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:18,127
Nobody cared.

1413
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:19,634
All they wanted was the product.

1414
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:21,996
They just wanted the name
and the sales.

1415
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,465
Who created it?
Psh.

1416
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:24,973
That was incidental.

1417
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:37,594
Tell him your story, Hal,
about The Monkees.

1418
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:40,787
Because the newspapers came in
to talk to them

1419
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:43,490
and we were in the next studio
cutting their stuff.

1420
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:46,063
And then they were pretending
that they were doing it

1421
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,662
there in the studios.

1422
01:12:47,664 --> 01:12:49,664
- Well, you just told it.
- Tell him the story.

1423
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:53,366
Well, you told the story.
Did you get it?

1424
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:58,809
I'd never considered myself
a musician.

1425
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:01,078
I-- You know, 'cause to me a
musician is someone

1426
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:04,747
who does session work,
who shows up and reads charts.

1427
01:13:04,748 --> 01:13:07,008
And I always approached
The Monkees as an actor,

1428
01:13:07,016 --> 01:13:10,616
playing the part of a drummer
in this imaginary group,

1429
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,190
that lived in this imaginary
beach house

1430
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:14,789
and had these imaginary
adventures.

1431
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:17,491
To me, that always-- always
been what it's about.

1432
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:19,934
Peter does tell the story of
going into some

1433
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:23,029
of the early sessions. And he
walked in with his guitar

1434
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:25,832
and his bass, and they said,
"What are you doing here?"

1435
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:29,135
"Well, we've already done the
track. Micky's gonna sing."

1436
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:31,769
"So, what--? You invited me
for a recording session."

1437
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:35,935
He said, "Yeah." I said,
"Well, what are you doing?"

1438
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:39,545
He said, "We have the record, we
just need to put a vocal on it."

1439
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:41,319
They said, "Just go home.
Relax."

1440
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:43,647
One, two, three, four.

1441
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,562
- Mikey, you like it?
- You like it?

1442
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:58,225
That's terrible.
That's the worst thing--

1443
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:01,474
I had no idea who these guys
were in these early sessions.

1444
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:03,071
It was my first session.

1445
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:05,572
And I was introduced to them,
"These are the musicians."

1446
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:06,935
I was the vocalist.

1447
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,913
<i>I remember Hal Blaine giving me
 some pointers</i>

1448
01:14:08,912 --> 01:14:12,352
<i>in the sessions, and Earl Palmer
 would give me some pointers.</i>

1449
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:13,978
<i> But I didn't have to play
 at that point.</i>

1450
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:16,553
They said, "You're gonna start
drum lessons on Monday."

1451
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:18,993
And I did.
And I had about a year.

1452
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:23,518
So, by the time I had to
actually play on stage, live,

1453
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:24,986
I wasn't that bad.

1454
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:27,264
I mean, I only had to play
our songs, obviously,

1455
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:29,003
and they were pretty simple
pop tunes.

1456
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:33,628
Hal and Earl do this stuff
with one hand in their sleep.

1457
01:14:43,012 --> 01:14:46,752
The fans, they didn't know
or care, and I was like,

1458
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:49,619
"What's the deal?
This is a television show

1459
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:51,049
you know.
What is the big deal?"

1460
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:53,724
But you know, back then,
and even to this day,

1461
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:56,663
a lot of people take their
rock and roll very seriously

1462
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,689
and, you know-- And it's,
you know,

1463
01:14:58,695 --> 01:15:01,895
rock and roll is
no laughing matter.

1464
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:04,528
You're not supposed
to have fun, you know.

1465
01:15:04,534 --> 01:15:06,234
It has to be
very serious.

1466
01:15:06,236 --> 01:15:07,636
It makes sense now to me.

1467
01:15:07,637 --> 01:15:08,897
If I were doing the project,

1468
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:10,805
I would do it exactly
the same way.

1469
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:13,367
Uh, but, uh, at the time, it
didn't make any sense to me.

1470
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:14,906
I didn't understand.

1471
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:16,641
- Were you upset?
- Yeah, I was upset.

1472
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:19,676
<i> I thought that-- I mean,
 I was very naive.</i>

1473
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:23,652
I regard how upset I was as a
function of my naiveté.

1474
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:26,723
I always thought I was gonna be
in a recording session,

1475
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:28,323
and play the guitar,
and do the things,

1476
01:15:28,324 --> 01:15:30,964
and sing the background vocals,
and all the rest of that.

1477
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,860
I had no idea that they had
just gone

1478
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,732
and made the tracks without us.

1479
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:36,731
I don't think there was any
backlash to the discovery

1480
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:39,603
that The Monkees didn't play
their own instruments initially,

1481
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:41,472
because everybody knew
it was common practice.

1482
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:43,041
I saw them in everybody's
session.

1483
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:46,439
I remember in RCA Victor going
to The Mamas and Papas,

1484
01:15:46,442 --> 01:15:48,182
who were next door,
and there was Hal Blaine.

1485
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:51,647
And then, he'd come over
and do one of our sessions.

1486
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:53,848
And then off to do
somebody else, I guess.

1487
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:56,620
<i>I knew they played on virtually
 all The Beach Boys records.</i>

1488
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,619
You know, we got a lot of shit
for it,

1489
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:01,691
but I think finally, you know,
some of those guys

1490
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:03,791
are coming clean.

1491
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,711
<i> Barry McGuire had found this
song called California Dreamin'</i>

1492
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:26,905
<i> that he wanted to record.</i>

1493
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:29,916
And these four,
kind of scruffy looking,

1494
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,649
two guys and two girls
came to the studio

1495
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:32,924
because Barry wanted
them to sing

1496
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:35,022
background parts on his record.

1497
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:37,634
And he said to Lou, "They're a
great sounding vocal group.

1498
01:16:37,627 --> 01:16:39,287
You should hear them sing."

1499
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,025
<i>John Phillips wrote this song,
 California Dreamin'.</i>

1500
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:44,931
So while the band was on a ten,
Lou and I went down the hall

1501
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,874
to studio two,
with the four of them.

1502
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:50,399
<i>And John had a guitar and they
sang California Dreamin'.</i>

1503
01:16:58,214 --> 01:16:59,784
<i> Lou said, "What do you think?"</i>

1504
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,852
<i> And I said, "If you don't take
 them, I will," you know.</i>

1505
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:05,721
After hearing their vocals--
their background vocals,

1506
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:07,662
I thought it should be
their record.

1507
01:17:07,657 --> 01:17:10,687
When I started to do
The Mamas and The Papas,

1508
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:14,363
I put Joe Osborn in that group
with Hal Blaine.

1509
01:17:14,364 --> 01:17:19,534
And that's when Hal, and Larry
and myself worked together

1510
01:17:19,535 --> 01:17:21,135
as a group for the first time.

1511
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,437
I wasn't really busy.
At that point,

1512
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:25,839
I wasn't busy
as a studio player.

1513
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:28,512
And Hal helped get me
into that area.

1514
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:32,011
Those kinds of combinations of
what Joe brought to Hal Blaine,

1515
01:17:32,015 --> 01:17:35,045
and what Hal Blaine brought to
Joe Osborn was great.

1516
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:44,125
In the case of
The mamas and Papas,

1517
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:50,127
John Phillips would run the song
down on rhythm guitar.

1518
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:52,633
At the same time,
Hal would be taking notes,

1519
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:54,465
Glen Campbell
might be taking notes.

1520
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,100
And then we say,
"Okay, let's run it down."

1521
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:59,035
They had parts in mind
so that you could then edit,

1522
01:17:59,042 --> 01:18:00,842
"Yeah, that's good,
let's keep it.

1523
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,913
That's not, can you try
something else?"

1524
01:18:02,912 --> 01:18:05,482
But they had a lot to do with
the arrangements.

1525
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:08,681
<i> Members of The Mamas
 and The Papas teach the song</i>

1526
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:09,975
<i> to the musicians.</i>

1527
01:18:09,986 --> 01:18:12,246
<i> There is no arrangement
 or score.</i>

1528
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:30,166
<i> The musicians decide
 what they should play</i>

1529
01:18:30,173 --> 01:18:34,643
<i> against the vocals.
 A rhythm gets going.</i>

1530
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:40,817
Producers presented the
musicians with a road map.

1531
01:18:40,817 --> 01:18:44,817
It was just chord symbols.
And that was about as far

1532
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:47,091
as it went.
Now, these musicians

1533
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:51,660
took that information and, you
know, added a little flavor

1534
01:18:51,661 --> 01:18:53,791
to it that was unexpected.
A lot of times it was,

1535
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:57,796
you know, much more than you
had hoped for.

1536
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:40,136
People come over and say,
"Did you this?

1537
01:19:40,143 --> 01:19:42,183
Would you work with this group?"
I said, "I don't remember."

1538
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:43,678
"Well, I saw your name
on the album."

1539
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,009
"Then I did."
You know, that's--

1540
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:46,454
- Right.
- 'Cause you work so much,

1541
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:47,579
you have no idea.

1542
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:50,553
The studio player of 1999,
they would--

1543
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:52,153
If they're not playing all
the time,

1544
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:54,155
they would need to do
what we never needed to do,

1545
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:55,457
was practice.

1546
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,788
All the time you're practicing,
while being paid.

1547
01:19:57,794 --> 01:19:59,464
It's funny. Earl and I were
talking one time.

1548
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:02,162
It's like, you couldn't judge
anybody by how much

1549
01:20:02,165 --> 01:20:03,725
they were working 'cause
everybody was working

1550
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:04,933
all the time.

1551
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,366
You had to just go by how much
work you turned down.

1552
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,140
Most of us were so fortunate
to have been in

1553
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:14,279
at the original beginnings of
rock and roll.

1554
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:16,407
Fuck, I say it, I made more
money playing rock and roll

1555
01:20:16,412 --> 01:20:17,782
than I ever made playing jazz.

1556
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:20,250
There was one point
in the mid '60s that

1557
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:23,219
I was making more money than the
president of the United States.

1558
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:25,019
I remember I used to kid
Carol. I'd say,

1559
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:28,321
"Do you realize, Carol,
if I got a divorce and you--

1560
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:31,294
We could get married and
what a year we'd have of money.

1561
01:20:31,294 --> 01:20:32,864
Between all your money
and my money,

1562
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:34,402
- we'd be killing everybody."

1563
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:36,257
Including each other.

1564
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:43,239
This is where we did Sinatra,

1565
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:44,669
Dean Martin,

1566
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:45,944
Sammy Davis Jr.

1567
01:20:45,942 --> 01:20:49,012
We did everybody in there.

1568
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:52,481
It's just an amazing place.

1569
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:54,221
In my particular case,

1570
01:20:54,217 --> 01:20:57,817
I bought an incredible mansion
in Hollywood.

1571
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:00,490
I had a magnificent yacht.

1572
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:02,219
I had a gorgeous Rolls Royce.

1573
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:05,485
<i> But, out of nowhere,
I had a wife who all of a sudden</i>

1574
01:21:05,494 --> 01:21:07,234
<i> declared, "I want a divorce."</i>

1575
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,560
"What? What are you talking
about?

1576
01:21:09,565 --> 01:21:12,595
I just went for a sandwich
and--"

1577
01:21:12,602 --> 01:21:15,002
It's, like, impossible
to believe.

1578
01:21:15,004 --> 01:21:17,204
<i> And in order for her
 to get paid off,</i>

1579
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,606
<i> you sell everything you own.</i>

1580
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:22,879
I had 170-something gold
records.

1581
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:25,409
<i> I had to sell them all.</i>

1582
01:21:25,414 --> 01:21:28,524
<i> The house was sold for a third
 of what it was worth.</i>

1583
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:32,087
<i> I had to let the yacht go.
 The yacht was repossessed.</i>

1584
01:21:32,088 --> 01:21:35,918
<i> I never had anything
 repossessed in my life.</i>

1585
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:39,955
It's just a shame to get
wiped out that seriously.

1586
01:21:39,962 --> 01:21:42,262
<i> I had been working with
 John Denver,</i>

1587
01:21:42,265 --> 01:21:46,125
<i> almost 5 grand a week
 for almost ten years,</i>

1588
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:48,535
<i> and all of a sudden,
 that job ended.</i>

1589
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:50,867
Terrible, terrible thing
to have to go through.

1590
01:21:50,873 --> 01:21:53,843
I mean, it's--
You certainly,

1591
01:21:53,843 --> 01:21:55,713
in the realm of suicide,

1592
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:58,781
you certainly think about it.

1593
01:21:58,781 --> 01:22:02,021
I was working
in Scottsdale, Arizona,

1594
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:04,588
and I was a security guard,

1595
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,417
plain and simple.

1596
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:09,392
Here I went from...
all this money

1597
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:12,262
and this magnificent estate
and everything else involved,

1598
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:15,061
and all of a sudden
I was reduced to

1599
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:17,804
living in a clothes closet.

1600
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,370
Came out of about 23 rooms
in Hollywood.

1601
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:23,900
And it was like
the end of the world.

1602
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,717
<i> This was Gold Star.</i>

1603
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:37,217
<i> So this is it.
 This is what's left.</i>

1604
01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:39,049
<i> And it was an amazing time,</i>

1605
01:22:39,055 --> 01:22:41,055
<i> and it was such
 a historical place.</i>

1606
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:43,757
<i> They had a lot of first-time
 big hit people</i>

1607
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:45,659
<i> come here and make their
 records.</i>

1608
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:48,861
<i> Across the street, we recorded
 The Captain & Tennille</i>

1609
01:22:48,864 --> 01:22:52,204
<i> doing Love Will Keep Us
Together.</i>

1610
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:53,971
Boy, they had a number one,

1611
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:57,710
it was record of the year
that year.

1612
01:22:57,707 --> 01:23:00,537
It was my last record
of the year.

1613
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:26,370
In L.A., I'd heard that things
were picking up again...

1614
01:23:26,369 --> 01:23:29,299
you know '82, '83,
something like that.

1615
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:32,165
And then I was also
getting a few calls,

1616
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:36,284
and all of a sudden,
I was working again.

1617
01:23:36,278 --> 01:23:39,148
<i> One of the great highlights
 was when I was inducted</i>

1618
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:41,148
<i> into the Rock and Roll
 Hall of Fame.</i>

1619
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:43,150
<i> So in the year 2000,</i>

1620
01:23:43,152 --> 01:23:46,492
<i> me and Earl Palmer
 were both inducted.</i>

1621
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:49,559
<i> You know, Earl was just--
 I can't thank him enough.</i>

1622
01:23:49,558 --> 01:23:51,788
<i> Earl recommending me
 in the beginning,</i>

1623
01:23:51,794 --> 01:23:56,864
<i> it made a name for myself.
 It really was that simple.</i>

1624
01:23:56,866 --> 01:24:00,526
You know,
I've always said...

1625
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:04,806
if you love your work,
it's not work,

1626
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:07,067
you know?
We loved our work, man.

1627
01:24:07,076 --> 01:24:08,836
That's how we could work
day and night,

1628
01:24:08,844 --> 01:24:11,554
'cause we loved it.

1629
01:24:19,922 --> 01:24:21,262
I'll never forget a session

1630
01:24:21,257 --> 01:24:23,417
we were all doing
with Don Costa.

1631
01:24:23,426 --> 01:24:26,726
And I start playing rhythm
and he stopped and he said,

1632
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,659
"Glen, you got the lead there."

1633
01:24:28,664 --> 01:24:30,564
And, boy, I said...

1634
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,466
I said, "Mr. Costa,
I can't read notes."

1635
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:34,328
He said, "Well, you know
the melody, don't you?"

1636
01:24:34,336 --> 01:24:36,066
And I said, "Yeah."
He said, "Well, just--

1637
01:24:36,072 --> 01:24:38,472
That's the melody."
I said, "Oh, okay, great."

1638
01:24:38,474 --> 01:24:40,574
He would ask Tedesco,
"How does that figure go

1639
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,606
- or this figure go," you know?
- Right, exactly.

1640
01:24:42,611 --> 01:24:45,211
And then he would sit there
and work it out.

1641
01:24:45,214 --> 01:24:48,724
And we'd make the records
and it was always perfect.

1642
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:51,717
Yeah. Well, he had
a certain thing that he offered

1643
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,790
that they wanted.

1644
01:24:52,788 --> 01:24:56,288
Wonderful ear and a wonderful
facility on the instrument.

1645
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,692
<i> Glen came up
 with great ideas,</i>

1646
01:24:58,694 --> 01:25:00,664
<i> and his solos were just super.</i>

1647
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:02,633
And then all of a sudden,
he's a singing star.

1648
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:05,171
Well, he always could sing.
We used to kid him about,

1649
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:06,797
"Oh, he's standing up
and singing now,

1650
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:09,602
he's gonna be a big star."
But he became a big star.

1651
01:25:13,843 --> 01:25:15,083
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1652
01:25:15,077 --> 01:25:16,877
I'm Glen Campbell.

1653
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:18,549
I'd mixed, actually,
the first record.

1654
01:25:18,547 --> 01:25:20,577
That record that he made
for Capitol--

1655
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:21,723
I mixed that record.

1656
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:24,177
And it was like a really
surprise to see him come in

1657
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:26,046
and say, "I'm singing
on this record, I'm gonna..."

1658
01:25:26,055 --> 01:25:27,115
you know...

1659
01:25:27,123 --> 01:25:29,063
And the record was a hit

1660
01:25:29,058 --> 01:25:31,758
and his vocal career
was launched.

1661
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:35,230
And when he got out
and became a singing star,

1662
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:37,531
guess who he called
to back him up?

1663
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:39,503
- That's right, yeah.
- We were all there for him.

1664
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:42,102
I remember Tedesco
playing on...

1665
01:25:42,104 --> 01:25:44,104
I forget what it was.

1666
01:25:44,106 --> 01:25:46,566
He said, "You still talking
to us peons?"

1667
01:25:48,444 --> 01:25:51,384
I said, "Well, some of 'em."

1668
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:53,710
<i> But it was great having
 the guys do the sessions.</i>

1669
01:25:53,716 --> 01:25:57,246
<i> I knew who all the good
 players were.</i>

1670
01:25:57,253 --> 01:26:00,653
<i> Playing Wichita Lineman,
 it had a chord to it.</i>

1671
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,916
I don't think
it had any part written.

1672
01:26:06,428 --> 01:26:09,058
you know. She says,
"How about this for a kickoff

1673
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:10,964
<i>on Wichita Lineman?"
She came up with that.</i>

1674
01:26:27,049 --> 01:26:29,319
Glen Campbell was a heck
of a guitar player,

1675
01:26:29,318 --> 01:26:31,448
and I had this
Dano bass guitar

1676
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:34,693
that had special pickups
and bridge and strings on it

1677
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,890
and it got a really great
gutty sound.

1678
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:39,732
<i> And he picked it up
 and did the solo on it.</i>

1679
01:26:39,728 --> 01:26:40,888
<i> It was great.</i>

1680
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:50,639
<i>I heard W ichita Lineman
at a drugstore one time</i>

1681
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:52,609
and it just brought tears
to my eyes,

1682
01:26:52,608 --> 01:26:55,538
'cause that tune
meant a lot to me.

1683
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:12,429
<i> I did all that early
 Glen Campbell stuff,</i>

1684
01:27:12,428 --> 01:27:15,528
<i> all of it...
 up to Southern Nights,</i>

1685
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:17,831
<i> when he changed producers
 and I didn't do anymore.</i>

1686
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,933
<i> Glen by this time was trying--
recording-- using his own band.</i>

1687
01:27:20,936 --> 01:27:23,536
I'm sitting in Martoni's
one night there in Hollywood,

1688
01:27:23,539 --> 01:27:27,039
and Steve Turner, his drummer,
walked in.

1689
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:29,982
And he said, "You're not gonna
believe what just happened."

1690
01:27:29,979 --> 01:27:31,849
"What?"
And he said, "I'm just coming

1691
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:35,017
from a session with Glen,
and we're trying to get this kid

1692
01:27:35,017 --> 01:27:37,047
to play some decent
rhythm guitar."

1693
01:27:37,052 --> 01:27:41,662
Glen says, "Well, give me that
big, full Al Casey sound."

1694
01:27:41,657 --> 01:27:44,487
I said, "Does he know that
I'm available tonight?"

1695
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:45,993
you know.
But I understand

1696
01:27:45,995 --> 01:27:47,625
he was trying to use
his own band.

1697
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:49,100
But when stuff like that
starts happening,

1698
01:27:49,098 --> 01:27:51,928
that's-- that's a signal.

1699
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:55,374
<i> I think a lot of us felt
 this just might go on forever.</i>

1700
01:27:55,371 --> 01:27:57,471
And that was
the first great shock

1701
01:27:57,473 --> 01:28:00,613
for many of us who had
setbacks in our careers

1702
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:03,079
and realized that,
"Hey, this is an up-down...

1703
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:05,348
up-down thing."

1704
01:28:05,347 --> 01:28:07,577
<i> Sports figures seem to have
 a ten-year period</i>

1705
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:09,783
<i> when it all happens for them.</i>

1706
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,885
So what you get
is you get the ramp up,

1707
01:28:11,887 --> 01:28:15,157
you get ten great years,
and you get the ramp down.

1708
01:28:15,157 --> 01:28:17,217
And the trick is to make
the ramp down

1709
01:28:17,226 --> 01:28:20,186
last as long as
you possibly can.

1710
01:28:20,195 --> 01:28:21,855
<i> Who would hire me
 at my age then,</i>

1711
01:28:21,864 --> 01:28:23,304
<i> to be in a rock group?</i>

1712
01:28:23,299 --> 01:28:24,929
They weren't doing
that anymore,

1713
01:28:24,933 --> 01:28:27,673
because now the rock guys
were doing their stuff.

1714
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:29,070
And writing,
which they always did,

1715
01:28:29,071 --> 01:28:31,841
but they were able
to perform it.

1716
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,110
<i> As Dylan said, "The times,
 they are a-changing."</i>

1717
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:36,680
<i> it just changed.</i>

1718
01:28:36,679 --> 01:28:39,409
New game.
new way of doing it.

1719
01:28:39,415 --> 01:28:41,445
I don't think it was
a conscious decision

1720
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:43,880
that, you know, these musicians
play a certain way

1721
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:47,246
and now we better
get more contemporary.

1722
01:28:47,256 --> 01:28:49,186
<i> In my case, it had to do
 with the artist</i>

1723
01:28:49,191 --> 01:28:51,021
<i> or who the artist
 brought with them.</i>

1724
01:28:51,026 --> 01:28:52,386
<i> In the case of Carole King,</i>

1725
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:54,264
<i> she brought a rhythm section
 with her.</i>

1726
01:28:54,263 --> 01:28:56,703
<i> She brought James Taylor
 on guitar.</i>

1727
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,569
<i> I think the bands
 learned to play.</i>

1728
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:00,767
It was more important
for the public to know

1729
01:29:00,769 --> 01:29:04,369
that the bands were really
playing the music.

1730
01:29:04,373 --> 01:29:06,273
<i> You had these groups
 that came up</i>

1731
01:29:06,275 --> 01:29:08,675
<i> in the late '60s
 and into the '70s...</i>

1732
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:11,477
<i> The Buffalo Springfield that
 became Crosby, Stills & Nash.</i>

1733
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,780
And these were all
self-contained groups that,

1734
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:16,352
for the most part,
never used studio musicians.

1735
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:17,682
And those things became huge.

1736
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:20,386
And that's where album artists
became really big.

1737
01:29:20,389 --> 01:29:22,759
Well, it had a huge effect
and...

1738
01:29:22,758 --> 01:29:25,758
you know, the singer/songwriter
acts

1739
01:29:25,761 --> 01:29:28,431
became very important
to people.

1740
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:32,170
They started wanting bands
that played their own stuff.

1741
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:34,997
<i> It really had an effect
 on the session musicians.</i>

1742
01:29:35,003 --> 01:29:36,973
<i> I'd kinda left by then.</i>

1743
01:29:36,972 --> 01:29:38,842
We all went into it

1744
01:29:38,841 --> 01:29:42,281
knowing it could stop
any second.

1745
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:43,837
It was never meant to last.

1746
01:29:43,846 --> 01:29:46,546
I was just like this
magical bubble

1747
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:49,148
that just kind of...

1748
01:29:49,151 --> 01:29:51,321
blossomed for a second...

1749
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,890
hung there in the air...

1750
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:58,089
Hal plays on seven
records of the year in a row.

1751
01:29:58,093 --> 01:30:00,463
Seven in a row...

1752
01:30:00,462 --> 01:30:03,202
and then the bubble... poof.
Pops.

1753
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:04,928
It's new people.
it's a new regime.

1754
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:07,903
We came in at a certain time,
when we were all new.

1755
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:10,503
All the new people
are coming in now,

1756
01:30:10,506 --> 01:30:13,236
when they are new--
Young, vibrant,

1757
01:30:13,242 --> 01:30:16,312
playing today's sounds.
It's that simple.

1758
01:30:43,906 --> 01:30:46,136
As the record dates with
The Wrecking Crew diminished,

1759
01:30:46,141 --> 01:30:49,511
my father was one of the more
fortunate musicians.

1760
01:30:49,511 --> 01:30:51,811
His versatility,
combined with his ability

1761
01:30:51,814 --> 01:30:54,924
to read music in seconds,
led to thousands of recordings

1762
01:30:54,917 --> 01:30:56,517
in film and television.

1763
01:30:56,518 --> 01:30:58,288
He worked with some of
the greatest composers

1764
01:30:58,287 --> 01:30:59,747
in American music:

1765
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:02,015
John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith,

1766
01:31:02,024 --> 01:31:03,724
Henry Mancini, Bill Conti,

1767
01:31:03,725 --> 01:31:05,785
James Horner, Burt Bacharach,

1768
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:08,704
Lalo Schifrin,
just to name a few.

1769
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:12,528
In the '70s,
my father started playing

1770
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:14,534
for his own enjoyment.

1771
01:31:14,536 --> 01:31:17,836
It was the first time
I remember seeing him at home

1772
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,110
with the guitar.

1773
01:31:20,108 --> 01:31:22,238
He got into doing seminars

1774
01:31:22,244 --> 01:31:24,384
and that's what he really
enjoyed.

1775
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:25,849
He was flying around
the country.

1776
01:31:25,848 --> 01:31:29,678
And he arranged his seminars
on weekends

1777
01:31:29,685 --> 01:31:31,815
so that he could be home
during the week...

1778
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,620
in case there was
any calls.

1779
01:31:33,622 --> 01:31:35,262
Let me give you
what I call

1780
01:31:35,257 --> 01:31:37,317
"the creative
studio guitar player".

1781
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:38,956
About a year ago,

1782
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:41,531
I got the call
to do a John Denver special.

1783
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:44,060
It was John Denver in Mexico,

1784
01:31:44,066 --> 01:31:45,966
and they wanted some--
He was on a fishing vessel

1785
01:31:45,968 --> 01:31:48,438
and they wanted some Mexican
music, so I gave them this:

1786
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:09,021
<i>Got a call to do
 Charlie's Angels.</i>

1787
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:11,064
They were in Puerto Rico.
They wanted Puerto Rican music,

1788
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:23,636
<i> Starsky & Hutch
was in a big revolt</i>

1789
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:25,139
in Bolivia in one show.

1790
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,370
They wanted Bolivian music.

1791
01:32:35,551 --> 01:32:39,591
In 1975, my father, in jest,
wrote a song called

1792
01:32:39,588 --> 01:32:42,718
<i> Requiem For a Studio
 Guitar Player.</i>

1793
01:32:56,038 --> 01:32:57,938
Always looking to carry
a joke a little further,

1794
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:01,440
my dad dressed up
as a 280-pound ballerina

1795
01:33:01,443 --> 01:33:02,683
<i>and went on The Gong Show.</i>

1796
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,150
You should think about
what he's saying

1797
01:33:13,155 --> 01:33:14,915
in the lyrics to his song.

1798
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:17,723
Don't dwell on the costume
too much...

1799
01:33:17,726 --> 01:33:20,056
because it tells a lot about
the way the business

1800
01:33:20,062 --> 01:33:21,762
in this town works.

1801
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:24,663
And for being a person
with a sense of humor,

1802
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:27,366
I think Tommy's
had to put up with

1803
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:29,699
a lot of really stupid things.

1804
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:50,459
It was not until I tracked
these musicians down

1805
01:33:50,459 --> 01:33:51,889
to tell their story

1806
01:33:51,893 --> 01:33:55,733
that I fully understood
Frank Zappa's words.

1807
01:33:55,731 --> 01:33:57,931
In 1992,
my father had a stroke

1808
01:33:57,933 --> 01:34:02,203
that pretty much ended
his career as a guitarist.

1809
01:34:02,204 --> 01:34:04,804
Two months before
my father passed away,

1810
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:06,906
he said to me, "You know,
the stroke came

1811
01:34:06,908 --> 01:34:09,208
at the right time
in my life."

1812
01:34:09,211 --> 01:34:11,311
I knew exactly what he meant.

1813
01:34:11,313 --> 01:34:12,983
The phone had stopped ringing,

1814
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:15,381
and his day as
the Los Angeles session king

1815
01:34:15,384 --> 01:34:17,154
had come to an end.

1816
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:21,422
Now he had an excuse as to why
the phone didn't ring.

1817
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:25,533
It was something
he had no control over.

1818
01:34:25,527 --> 01:34:27,887
If I learned anything
from my father,

1819
01:34:27,896 --> 01:34:29,426
it was to give more
than you take.

1820
01:34:29,431 --> 01:34:30,931
He loved his family
and friends

1821
01:34:30,932 --> 01:34:33,502
and would always help
the younger guitar players,

1822
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:35,542
knowing it was only
a matter of time

1823
01:34:35,537 --> 01:34:38,037
that they soon
would take his place,

1824
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:41,170
just like he took someone else's
seat 40 years earlier.

1825
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:46,246
mellow guitar chords)

1826
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:43,499
Right on!

1827
01:36:43,498 --> 01:36:50,368
Mariachi music)

1828
01:37:08,857 --> 01:37:11,017
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

1829
01:37:11,026 --> 01:37:14,486
With 30 points,
the winner today is...

1830
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,496
Hot dog!

1831
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:17,757
...Tommy Tedesco!

1832
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:35,761
What do you call
a trombone player

1833
01:41:35,757 --> 01:41:37,817
with a beeper?

1834
01:41:37,826 --> 01:41:39,456
An optimist.
