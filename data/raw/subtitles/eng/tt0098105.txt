01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:39,886
Take me away? Oh, how rude!
How rude! Whoo!

857
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,013
Take yourselves away. Try that!

858
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:46,935
As a matter of fact, you're all fired.
Each and every one of you is fired. Fired!

859
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:49,854
And don't you touch my model ships!
Not one of you!

860
01:18:50,021 --> 01:18:52,732
Don't touch them!
The little men are so delicate.

861
01:18:52,899 --> 01:18:55,485
They'll crumble
between your big, fat fingers!

862
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:58,196
Your big cop fingers!

863
01:18:58,405 --> 01:19:04,202
Eric, I owe you and the team an apology.
I've been a fool.

864
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:05,704
Yes.

865
01:19:05,912 --> 01:19:08,039
But that's all right, commissioner.

866
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:12,627
Consider yourself
and your team reinstated.

867
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:15,588
All right!

868
01:19:17,465 --> 01:19:21,428
MAN: And so it is with great honor
that I award these men and women...

869
01:19:21,594 --> 01:19:27,809
...the Distinguished Service Medal
for serving this city in its hour of need.

870
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:37,819
Ladies and gentlemen,
our honored police officers.

[PLAYING BAND MUSIC]

872
01:19:53,126 --> 01:19:55,712
I think I'll take your seat, lieutenant.

873
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:57,964
You take mine.

874
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:59,632
Yes, sir.

875
01:20:01,968 --> 01:20:04,012
Unless there's some problem.

876
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:06,598
Nope. No problem.

877
01:20:20,862 --> 01:20:22,364
Oh...

878
01:20:26,242 --> 01:20:27,577
Proctor.

879
01:20:28,328 --> 01:20:29,996
Oh, Proctor.

880
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:34,000
Proctor!

881
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,148
Proctor!
