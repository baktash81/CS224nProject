1
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,936
You're not looking at me, Mike.

2
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,902
You're not looking at me in the eyes.

3
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,706
That's weak.

4
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,206
Only weak people do that.

5
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,652
I could look you in the eye
if I wanted to, Daddy.

6
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,486
I just don't wanna look you in the eye.

7
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,792
I guess you're just a weak person.

8
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,390
You must have got that from your mother.

9
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,268
It probably would have been better for you...

10
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,737
to have been born a girl.

11
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,097
Then we could have named you Michelle.

12
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,477
You see, weakness is more acceptable
in a girl, Michelle.

13
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,844
I'm sorry, I mean, Mike.

14
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,378
I keep forgetting.

15
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,089
Wait a minute.

16
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,153
Why don't I call you Michelle all the time?

17
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,263
Then I wouldn't have to be so goddamn
ashamed of you and your weaknesses.

18
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,129
I could think of you as a girl all the time...

19
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,228
by your frocks, dresses,
and frilly hats and scarves.

20
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,170
You could be Daddy's little girl.

21
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:26,234
I wouldn't have to be so fucking ashamed
of being seen with you in public, would I?

22
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,748
What do you think of that, Michelle?

23
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,178
Sound like a good idea?

24
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,014
Don't, Daddy.

25
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:36,889
What?

26
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,887
Did you say something?

27
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,524
Such a soft little girl's voice.
I couldn't hear what you said.

28
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,357
I hate you, Daddy.

29
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,768
- Speak up, girl!
- I hate you!

30
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,000
I hate you, because I love...

31
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,071
It makes me feel...

32
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,578
guilty inside, hate.

33
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,717
I can't let the heart speak.

34
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,110
Then don't speak.

35
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,618
Don't speak to me. Show me.

36
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,692
Don't tell me.
I'm not interested in what little girls say.

37
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,816
Show me!

38
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,361
Show me your anger.
Then I can understand it.

39
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,394
There you are, Daddy.

40
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,371
I see you, Michelle.

41
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,245
I see everything.

42
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,476
This is me, Daddy.

43
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,116
This is what you do to me inside.

44
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,291
Go all the way through it.

45
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,227
Go all the way through it to the end.

46
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,358
Come out the other end.

47
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,600
Don't stop in the middle.

48
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,295
I'm watching you.

49
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,805
I'm watching everything you do, Mike.

50
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,732
Wow.

51
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,930
The man is a genius.

52
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,098
Dr. Raglan would like to thank you all
for coming this afternoon.

53
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,871
I believe your bus is waiting outside now.
Thank you.

54
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,964
Candy...

55
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,996
it's me, honey.

56
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,606
Daddy.

57
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,276
Okay, honey.

58
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,350
Warm enough?

59
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,361
Okay, put the whale down. Turn around.

60
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,200
Hold your hair up.

61
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,775
Oh, my God.

62
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,129
Sorry, Hal...

63
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,207
but Mr. Carveth is still here.

64
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,367
He's starting to get passionate
about the whole thing.

65
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,742
Okay, send him in.

66
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,915
Mr. Carveth.

67
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,784
Thanks a lot.

68
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,080
Frank, it's been some time.

69
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,480
What can I do for you?

70
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,024
I want to see Nola.

71
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,127
I want to see my wife, now.

72
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,228
You know she's still undergoing
intensive therapy.

73
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,624
I can't let you break that isolation.

74
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,030
You let her see Candice
on the weekends, don't you?

75
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,604
Yes, Frank, I do. But that's different.

76
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,438
Visits from her daughter
was in her program from the very start.

77
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,174
Her program has just changed.

78
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,371
What do you mean?

79
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,339
You sound hostile.

80
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,411
My daughter's been beaten severely...

81
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,781
and scratched and bitten!

82
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,083
Her mother did it...

83
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,250
her mother,
who is under your psychiatric care.

84
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,396
That's an incredibly heavy
accusation to make.

85
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,067
Did Candice tell you that?

86
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,271
Candice won't talk about it.

87
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,805
She pretends
the whole thing never happened.

88
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,305
But it was Nola...

89
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,405
or some other crazy
you have stashed away up here.

90
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,848
Either way, no more weekends with Mommy.

91
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,646
The kid stays with me.

92
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,318
To take Candice away from her
at this stage...

93
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,553
could send Nola over into the deep end.

94
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,356
It's a critical time for her.

95
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,363
I happen to think that Nola's
been in over her head for a long time now.

96
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,865
You have no legal right to deny access.

97
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,904
Any time you'd like
to test the matter in open court...

98
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,075
I'd be more than happy to oblige.

99
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,615
For the ultimate good
of your own family, Frank...

100
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,051
we'd be prepared to do just that.

101
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,020
But don't you force it.

102
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,791
You bring Candy back to her mother
next weekend. She won't harm her.

103
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,863
There must be some other answer
to what you've seen.

104
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,898
Until you give me that answer...

105
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,601
Candy is not coming back.

106
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,414
Yes, Hal?

107
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,819
Prepare Nola Carveth
for another session tonight, will you?

108
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,891
Sure.

109
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,286
And, Chris...

110
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,359
make it phase two, after supper.

111
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,657
Okay, Hal.

112
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,427
This guy Raglan
is strictly an emotional opportunist.

113
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,700
He's a legit M.D., right?

114
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,799
He's a real psychiatrist.

115
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,636
Yes.

116
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,816
Goddamn it, psychoplasmics is a rip-off.

117
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,911
It's a sideshow. I've seen it in action.

118
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,420
It doesn't matter what you think.
You listen to me.

119
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,563
You call up this Raglan,
and you be a real mensch with him.

120
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:37,030
Otherwise, it's just a matter of time
before the cops show up at your door...

121
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,297
and you lose your kid for good.

122
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,963
The law believes in motherhood.

123
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,306
If I can dig up enough testimony to prove...

124
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:53,078
that Raglan's a dangerous fraud,
that Somafree is crawling with crazies...

125
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,044
it's no place for a kid, any time...

126
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,784
You're getting warmer.

127
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,954
But when Candy doesn't show up
at Somafree next weekend...

128
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,588
your wife can take legal action immediately.

129
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,427
You could find yourself belted with a writ
in seven days.

130
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,966
If I give Nola enough time,
she'll really hurt the kid.

131
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,567
I know she will.

132
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,311
I'll do anything I have to.

133
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,730
Here's your daddy.

134
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,001
I bet he knows all about this zipper.
There we go.

135
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,300
All set, now.

136
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,874
I'd love to talk to you
sometime soon, Mr. Carveth...

137
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,815
about school activities and Candy.

138
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,121
You missed the last open house.

139
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,118
Okay, soon.

140
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:46,598
Thanks.

141
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,028
See you tomorrow, Candy.

142
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,470
Thank you very much, Frank.

143
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,577
- For what?
- For bringing me my grandchild.

144
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,314
I know if it were up to Nola,
I'd never see Candice.

145
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,278
Juliana, that's not true.

146
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:09,249
Nola and I both know how much
she needs her grandma, especially now.

147
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,383
You're sweet.

148
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,527
I guess you know, now, what it feels like.

149
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,755
- What it feels like?
- Being a parent.

150
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,799
Being blamed for everything.

151
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:28,768
To have the past distorted, so you
don't even recognize yourself anymore.

152
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,308
Your child's version of the past, that is.

153
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,740
Juliana, Candice is only five.

154
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,139
She's working on it right now, believe me.

155
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,984
Thirty seconds after you're born,
you have a past.

156
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,684
And 60 seconds after that,
you start to lie to yourself about it.

157
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:56,458
I guess I've been indulging in a horrid bout
of nostalgia these last few days.

158
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,664
It must be the weather.
At least now I have a partner in crime.

159
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,339
- I've got to go.
- Of course.

160
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,504
'Bye, Daddy.

161
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,957
Take your time, we'll both be just fine.

162
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,868
I'll be with you in a second, sweetie.

163
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:41,242
I'm just gonna get a refill, and then
we'll look at those lovely old pictures.

164
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:44,816
Mommy.

165
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,814
Yes, Candice?

166
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,015
Yes, sweetie?

167
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,826
Mommy, you hurt me.

168
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:00,262
You hit me with your fists,
and then you scratched me with your nails.

169
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,393
You hurt me.

170
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,831
I didn't, sweetie.

171
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,338
You must have had a bad dream.

172
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,608
Mommies don't do that.
Mommies don't hurt their own children.

173
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,304
They don't?

174
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,142
They never do?

175
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,456
They sometimes do.

176
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,586
Sometimes, but then they're bad mommies,
they're fucked-up mommies.

177
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,292
Like whose?

178
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,967
Like whose mommy?

179
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,669
Like mine was.

180
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,211
Fucked up and bad.

181
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,082
No, I'm not, Nola.

182
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,616
You're being so unfair, sweetheart.
Mommies never do that.

183
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,355
Mommies never hurt their own children.

184
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,692
You did hurt me.

185
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,723
You beat me and you scratched me.

186
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,532
You threw me down the stairs.

187
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,238
Show me what I did.

188
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,367
Don't stop it now, darling, show me.

189
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,075
Show me your anger. Show it to me.

190
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,711
Go all the way through it.

191
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,678
Go all the way through it, till the end.

192
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,952
Right to the end.

193
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,195
That one's my favorite.

194
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,795
This one's your favorite?

195
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,131
Yes, Mommy in the hospital
when she was a little girl.

196
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,339
That's right. I remember this picture.

197
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,679
Your Grandpa Barton took this picture.

198
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,943
Tell me the rest of the story
that goes with this picture.

199
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,348
Why was Mommy in the hospital so much?

200
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,860
Some days, she would wake up
and she would be covered...

201
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,224
with big, ugly bumps.

202
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:16,390
And the doctors were very worried,
because they could never find out...

203
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,800
what those bumps all over her skin
really were.

204
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,339
I guess I didn't stack the dishes too well.
I better go see what the damage is.

205
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,876
While I'm there,
I think I'll freshen up both our drinks.

206
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:06,765
Jerry.

207
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,657
Hi, Frank.

208
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,433
You're really falling behind on this.

209
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:15,166
The Brenleys think that they are going to be
moving in here by May.

210
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,773
We're not going to make that, for sure.
Maybe by June.

211
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,042
I heard that the city plumbing permit
got held up...

212
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,308
because of a change in the building code.

213
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:25,984
Mr. Carveth.

214
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,544
Telephone call for you.

215
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,264
- Hello.
- Is that Mr. Carveth?

216
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,101
- Yes.
- Mr. Frank Carveth?

217
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:48,503
- This is Frank Carveth.
- This is Sgt. Martel, with 78th Division.

218
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,334
One of our officers noticed
a broken kitchen window...

219
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,071
while on a routine patrol
of the neighborhood.

220
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,977
He found your mother-in-law's body
in the kitchen.

221
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,379
The murder weapon was on the floor,
next to her.

222
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:04,616
He then found your daughter upstairs,
sound asleep in the bedroom.

223
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,753
It seems she missed the whole thing.

224
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:13,964
- Where is she now? I'd like to see her.
- With our police psychologist, Dr. Birkin.

225
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,525
- Psychologist? Why? Was she hysterical?
- No.

226
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,400
On the contrary, she was very cool
throughout the whole thing.

227
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,605
A little too cool, I thought,
so I asked Dr. Birkin to talk with her.

228
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,780
Just for an opinion.

229
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,709
In the meantime, can you think of
the names of any persons...

230
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,614
who would have a motive
to murder this woman?

231
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,223
You see, it doesn't seem to me to be
a simple case of an interrupted break-in...

232
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,622
or, say, a rape-murder.

233
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,332
Juliana had a long series of lovers.
I never met any of them.

234
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,598
What about her husband?

235
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:58,940
His name is Barton Kelly.
He works for the government, out in Halifax.

236
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,108
They were divorced over 10 years ago.

237
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,720
- Dr. Birkin.
- You must be Candice's father.

238
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,549
I'd like to take her home now.

239
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:15,491
Please. Give me just two minutes with you.
It's important. Have a seat.

240
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:22,930
To put it bluntly, I don't think your daughter
escaped this incident entirely unscathed.

241
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,902
- You think she saw what happened?
- I suspect she did.

242
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,940
Or she saw something
which traumatized her, confused her...

243
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,874
disturbed her in some way.

244
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,572
The officer who found her
said that she was very difficult to wake up.

245
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,650
To me, that indicates
a kind of abnormal deep sleep...

246
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,742
which a lot of people,
even children, will use...

247
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,583
to escape something
that's too painful to face.

248
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,724
And she says that she doesn't remember
being brought to her grandmother's...

249
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,590
or seeing her at all.

250
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,597
Do you think she'll remember, eventually?

251
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,298
Mr. Carveth, I think you must
encourage her to remember.

252
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,137
Why?

253
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,904
My concern is that the child
could have a very serious breakdown...

254
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:06,068
if she doesn't come to terms
with what she's experienced.

255
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:10,274
You see, these things tend to
express themselves in one way or another.

256
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,014
I've seen five-year-olds like her...

257
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,643
with ulcers as bad
as any middle-aged businessman.

258
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,779
Okay, I get the picture.

259
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,988
- Now can I take her home?
- I think that's fine.

260
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,387
No problem.

261
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,835
You're sure you don't want a story?

262
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,765
You don't have to read, you know.

263
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,972
I can make one up for you.

264
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,613
Do you want to tell me a story...

265
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,316
about what happened today at Grandma's?

266
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,618
You go to sleep, honey.

267
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,096
I'll leave the hall light on.

268
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,145
Damn.

269
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,943
No outside calls. You're in isolation.
You know that.

270
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,782
I tried to reach Dr. Raglan. He hasn't come.

271
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,287
He's on his way.

272
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,059
Chris...

273
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,593
Is something wrong? Anything?

274
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,834
Then it's me again.

275
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,365
Nothing's wrong, except with me.

276
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:20,009
No, that's Frank talking,
Frank twisting my words.

277
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,639
He won't be patient, he won't trust me,
he won't wait until I get well.

278
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,414
He thinks...

279
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,552
that I'm turning into my mother.

280
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,750
Day by day, moment by moment,
he thinks that I'm trying...

281
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,451
to make Candy into Baby Nola.

282
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,091
Is he right?

283
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:45,158
No. That's the last thing on earth I'd...

284
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,169
Who's that?

285
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,443
It's Daddy.

286
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,650
Frank hates me, Daddy. He despises me.

287
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,990
He thinks I'm trying to harm my little girl...

288
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:13,189
and I know that he's thinking of a way
to take her away.

289
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,093
And that's very unfair of him.
That's very arrogant of him.

290
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,898
You mustn't be too hard on him,
Nola, sweetheart.

291
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,869
He's just trying to be a good,
protective father.

292
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,200
No.

293
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,735
Yes.

294
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,943
He's just doing
what a good father should do.

295
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,150
He's protecting his little girl.

296
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:36,481
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
He doesn't want to see her hurt.

297
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:40,080
He doesn't want to see her hurt by anybody,
not even her own mother.

298
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:43,093
Now, is there anything wrong with that?

299
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,197
No.

300
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,896
No, there isn't.

301
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,872
After all, it's just what I did for you, isn't it?

302
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,807
Frank's protecting Candy
the same way as I protected you, isn't he?

303
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,149
Isn't he?

304
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:07,685
No.

305
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,314
What do you mean, "no"?

306
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,951
- What do mean when you say "no"?
- I love you, Daddy.

307
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:23,028
I don't want you to think
that I don't love you.

308
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,961
I mean, you didn't.

309
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:28,763
"Didn't"?

310
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,235
"Didn't" what?

311
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,703
You didn't protect me.

312
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:37,707
You didn't.

313
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,775
You didn't, and you should have.

314
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,795
You shouldn't have looked away
when she hit me.

315
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,236
And you shouldn't have walked away
from the table...

316
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,864
when she twisted my words.
You should have stopped her.

317
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,610
You should have hit her when she hit me!

318
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:13,707
And you should have smacked her
when she smacked me.

319
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,581
Oh, God, I love you.

320
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,954
But you didn't protect me.

321
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,161
And you should have.

322
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,027
You pretended it wasn't happening.

323
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,426
You looked away.

324
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,869
And you should have.

325
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,904
Why didn't you?

326
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,569
Didn't you love me?

327
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,257
Look, there he is.

328
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,856
There's your grandfather.

329
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:31,888
Barton.

330
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,225
Hello, Frank. How you doing?
Good to see you.

331
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,234
- Let me take that.
- Hello. How you doing, Candy?

332
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,267
I guess you don't remember
your old granddad?

333
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,273
Right this way.

334
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:48,273
You didn't have to come way out here.
We could have met later, at the hotel.

335
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,871
I just didn't like the idea
of you coming in alone.

336
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,677
How long you plan to stay in town?

337
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,412
I guess we could
have the funeral tomorrow...

338
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,451
but Juliana's parents
might want to come in from Arizona.

339
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:02,583
Then there's that sister in Vancouver.
I don't know just how it's going to work out.

340
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,720
- All right. What hotel are you staying in?
- Park Plaza.

341
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,960
You know, I was even thinking
about going out to that old house again.

342
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,826
I still have the key, after all these years.

343
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:17,207
Juliana used to make a big fuss
about never having changed the locks.

344
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,667
I could never understand why.

345
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,740
Maybe it's because she really couldn't admit
that we were finished.

346
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,416
When I think about you and Nola...

347
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,078
and this sweet child having to go through
the same heartaches we went through...

348
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,987
it's enough to make you cry.

349
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,091
Yes, it is.

350
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,567
I'm here to see Mr. Jan Hartog.

351
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,788
Come in. Right in.

352
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,763
Sit down. I'll be right there.

353
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,734
Sit down. I'll be there in a second.

354
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,209
Goddamn son of a bitch.

355
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,482
Okay.

356
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,602
That's my...

357
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,474
heart, over there on the floor.

358
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,237
- Your heart?
- My second heart.

359
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:39,439
Your first heart
makes your blood circulate, right?

360
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,748
But what about your lymphatic fluids?

361
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,249
I don't know.

362
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:49,855
Movement, walking and running, fucking,
rolling on the floor, anything.

363
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,988
People have this whole other system
they don't even know about.

364
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,623
The lymphatic system,
it's like the blood system...

365
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:01,671
with its own style of veins and arteries...

366
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,737
but no heart.

367
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,371
You have to keep moving
to get it to circulate.

368
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:13,180
And they've just given me pills.
They do that every day.

369
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:18,511
And I've got to move them
through the lymphatic system.

370
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,787
Goddamn it.

371
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,290
Pardon my sweat.

372
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,400
I'm gonna take a bath, real soon.

373
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:38,900
So, Mr. Carveth...

374
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,775
how did you get my name?

375
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,006
My lawyer knows your lawyer.

376
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,979
I see. I get it.

377
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,575
Is your lawyer
preparing a case against Raglan, too?

378
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:50,651
Basically, yes.

379
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:54,655
- Slightly different from yours.
- How different?

380
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,729
My wife is still in therapy with Raglan.

381
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:04,062
I'm claiming psychological damage,
not physiological.

382
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,467
I see. Give him some more time
with your wife...

383
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,032
and you'll be able to claim
physiological damage, too.

384
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,275
Wouldn't this look impressive in court?

385
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,240
Do you like it? I do.

386
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:25,147
That's Raglan. That's psychoplasmics...

387
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,083
and it's called lymphosarcoma.

388
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,028
And it's spreading.

389
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,091
It's a form of cancer
of the lymphatic system.

390
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,530
You blame Raglan for that?

391
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,136
Raglan did it.

392
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,771
Raglan encouraged my body...

393
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,270
to revolt against me.

394
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,574
And it did.

395
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,713
I have a small revolution on my hands...

396
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,049
and I'm not putting it down
very successfully.

397
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:02,317
Then your lawyer really thinks
he can prove Raglan's responsible?

398
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,894
Are you kidding me?
You can't prove something like that in court.

399
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,558
Right from square one,
you're into, what, metaphysics?

400
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,164
How do you know
I'm not going to get cancer at age 32...

401
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,800
whether I'd gone into
psychoplasmics therapy or not?

402
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,609
No, we'd get laughed out of court.

403
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,982
Then why are you going into court?

404
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,382
Revenge.

405
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,519
Even if we lose, people will get nervous
about psychoplasmics.

406
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,857
It will be bad publicity.

407
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,625
They won't even remember
whether we won or lost.

408
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,930
They'll just remember the slogan:

409
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:50,231
"Psychoplasmics can cause cancer."

410
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,439
Catchy.

411
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,275
Is that going to help?

412
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,353
Maybe.

413
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,279
I'm not alone.

414
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,950
I'm in touch with a lot of people
who did psychoplasmics.

415
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,656
We might form a club.

416
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,993
I want to help you.

417
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,895
Okay. Thanks.

418
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,554
Dr. Raglan?

419
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,430
Yes?

420
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,890
I'm Barton Kelly, Nola Carveth's father.

421
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,433
Glad to meet you.

422
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,370
I'm sorry to accost you like this...

423
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,306
but your receptionist wasn't too helpful.

424
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,210
She probably knew I was on my way to...

425
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,304
Did you know
that Nola's mother died yesterday?

426
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,882
That she was murdered?

427
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,143
Yes, the police spoke to me.

428
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,483
- Then you've told her.
- No, I haven't.

429
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,758
That's why I'm here, to tell her.

430
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,796
Mr. Kelly, your wife's death
was a tragic and shocking thing.

431
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,428
That's why Nola must not be told.

432
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:24,902
What?

433
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,967
Nola's going through a very critical stage
in her therapy.

434
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,174
I'm not sure she could take it.

435
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,573
Are you saying that
I'm just supposed to bury the girl's mother...

436
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,375
and not tell her about it?

437
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,549
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

438
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:45,880
You are one ignorant son of a bitch,
Dr. Raglan.

439
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,222
Now, I have left my phone number...

440
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:55,724
on your front desk.

441
00:38:56,868 --> 00:39:00,099
If I don't hear from my daughter
by tomorrow afternoon...

442
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,899
I'm coming back up here to get her.

443
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,609
Shall I have him stopped?

444
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,749
No, it's all right.

445
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,577
He's drunk.

446
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,030
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

447
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,161
- You two look like you're having fun.
- We were.

448
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,865
Daddy, Ms. Mayer said she was starving.

449
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,404
Can we feed her at our place tonight?

450
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,475
Candy...

451
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,971
We could if she wanted to.

452
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,545
What do you think?

453
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,275
Well, I...

454
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,148
We could talk after Candy goes to bed.

455
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,722
Sure.

456
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,923
As soon as Candy realized
she had me alone...

457
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,728
she got me to play
"mother and daughter" with her.

458
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,802
She obviously needs mothering,
and isn't getting it.

459
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,274
Sometimes it just kills me to think
I might have screwed my kid up already.

460
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,376
She's not even six.

461
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,607
It's not just you.

462
00:40:56,754 --> 00:41:00,019
Sometimes when I'm being easy on myself,
I say, "It's not your fault.

463
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,591
"You got taken in.

464
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,185
"You got involved with a woman
who married you for your sanity...

465
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,991
"hoping it would rub off."

466
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,568
Instead, it started to work the other way.

467
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:21,912
Hello?

468
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,908
It's Barton Kelly, Frank.

469
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,476
How are you?

470
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:26,974
Just mediocre.

471
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,811
How are you?

472
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,082
I made a mistake.

473
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,755
I came back to the old place.

474
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,258
It's got me.

475
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,093
I'm depressed as hell.

476
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,465
Barton, get in a cab, will you?

477
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,401
- Just tell him to take...
- That's not all.

478
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,604
There's Nola, too.

479
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,308
How do you mean?

480
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,971
I went up to that place to see her.

481
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,148
They wouldn't even let me talk to her.

482
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,752
They said no to me, her own father!

483
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,820
Jesus.

484
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,849
So I'm going back up there, to Somafree.

485
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:10,151
We'll leave just as soon as you get here.

486
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,319
Soon as I get there?

487
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,090
I'll be waiting for you.

488
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,461
I know you'll want to go up there with me.

489
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,293
- You're not far from here, are you?
- Barton, listen to me.

490
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:22,031
I don't think that's a very smart thing to do.

491
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,937
I'm doing it, with or without you.

492
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:27,970
Okay.

493
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,174
I'm only about 15 minutes away. Wait for me.

494
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,510
I'll be there.

495
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,778
You're a good lad.

496
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,751
We'll go up there together,
and kick their ass.

497
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,122
I'm waiting on you.

498
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,267
I've a feeling
I've just been recruited to baby-sit.

499
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,898
Would you? It'd take 45 minutes.

500
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,868
He's drunk.

501
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:01,502
He'll drive his car off a bridge,
unless I talk some sense into him.

502
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,874
45 minutes?

503
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,538
That's all it'll take.

504
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:05,982
Okay.

505
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,317
Thanks.

506
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,252
Help yourself to some coffee.

507
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:12,456
Here.

508
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,022
Look at this while I'm gone.

509
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,454
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

510
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,927
45 minutes.

511
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,807
I shouldn't have...

512
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,076
I never planned it to be this way.

513
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:20,870
Nola?

514
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,271
Barton!

515
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:58,775
It's me!

516
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,840
I can't get over it.

517
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,543
The thing was in the house.

518
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,315
It was in the house all the time.
We searched the place...

519
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,448
but we weren't looking
for anything that small, and we missed it.

520
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,892
We were spending our time
checking out an Estonian musician.

521
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,527
Have you found out who it belongs to,
the kid?

522
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,259
No. My guess is...

523
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:06,996
some crazy woman didn't want
anyone to know she had a deformed child.

524
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,972
She's locked this kid up in an attic
for years and never told anybody.

525
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,439
Wouldn't be the first time.

526
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:19,415
Hello.

527
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,047
Who's this?

528
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,880
Ruth Mayer.

529
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,852
Did you want to speak with Frank Carveth?

530
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,324
Ruth Mayer? From Krell Street School?

531
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,427
Yes.

532
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,360
Is this Mrs. Carveth?

533
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:38,162
Are you and my husband
having your own private PTA meeting?

534
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,033
I won't even bother to answer that.

535
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,329
You bitch!

536
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,571
You're killing my family!

537
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:20,207
Our friend has very strange eyes.

538
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,836
They have irises, but no retinas.

539
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,749
I should think his vision of the world
is very distorted.

540
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:29,819
I'm pretty certain he sees things
only in black-and-white.

541
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,978
No colors.

542
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,487
The upper lip is cleft.

543
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:35,481
Real harelip...

544
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,520
but the palate is not.

545
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:41,392
And the tongue is too thick and inflexible
for proper speech.

546
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:43,731
It has no teeth...

547
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,462
but you can get a pretty nasty bite...

548
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,800
from these strange, beak-like gums.

549
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,103
Why did it die?

550
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:55,104
I found some sort of collapsed, fleshy sac...

551
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,578
between the little fellow's shoulder blades.

552
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:01,278
It contains traces
of a solid nutrient material...

553
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:04,320
a bit like the yolk sac of certain fish...

554
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:06,519
or a camel's hump.

555
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,893
Basically, it's a gas tank
that was full at birth.

556
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,688
Once the hump material
is completely assimilated...

557
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,659
I think the creature simply starves to death.

558
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,228
Runs out of gas, so to speak.

559
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,605
And that brings us
to the last point of interest.

560
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,770
There's an external deformity.

561
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,942
I mean, apart from the lack of sexual organs.

562
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:37,013
It's extremely subtle
and extremely provocative.

563
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:41,524
I wonder if either of you have noticed it.

564
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,024
- Has no navel.
- No what?

565
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:46,123
No bellybutton.

566
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:50,198
- The thing has no bellybutton.
- That's right.

567
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:54,566
And that means this creature
has never really been born.

568
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,632
At least, not the way
human beings are born.

569
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:58,975
Jesus.

570
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,813
You're the beginning of the end, Ms. Mayer.

571
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:15,180
The beginning of the end for me,
my family, my dream.

572
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,026
So sad.

573
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:23,160
And I feel so guilty for my part in it.
I wish it had never happened.

574
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:28,297
I wish we could be together again,
just the three of us.

575
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,469
You're kidding yourself.

576
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,543
Right now, you're dreaming.

577
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:37,507
From what Frank tells me,
it was lousy from the very start.

578
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,809
You never had anything real together.

579
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,250
It would be better for everybody if you...

580
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,583
If Frank divorced you and married me.

581
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:49,453
We'd still let you see Candy
in the weekends.

582
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,456
That stinks!

583
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:57,100
We had a lot.

584
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,761
We had beautiful things,
things that you couldn't understand.

585
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:04,466
And we'll have them again,
if you'd just leave him alone...

586
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:09,604
and stop poisoning him against me
and taking advantage of his Ioneliness.

587
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,779
Then he'd wait for me.

588
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:19,187
He'd help me to get better,
instead of abandoning me.

589
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:24,184
He would do that,
if you would just leave him alone.

590
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,066
Leave him alone!

591
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,781
Listen, I'm sorry. I called a few times.
You didn't answer.

592
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:51,217
I didn't want to talk to your wife again,
that's why. Once was enough.

593
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,188
- Nola called? What did she say?
- Look, I have to go.

594
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:01,661
Your life is just a little too complicated
for me right now.

595
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,160
I'll see you at the next open house.

596
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,155
Daddy.

597
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:15,560
What's the matter, sweetheart?
Why aren't you sleeping?

598
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:18,664
I had a bad dream. A scary bad dream.

599
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:22,837
- What was the dream about, honey?
- I'm afraid to tell you.

600
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:26,176
- Why?
- The dream doesn't want me to.

601
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:28,507
Candy, listen to me.

602
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,552
I know what happened at Grandma's.
I know what you saw there.

603
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,790
I just came from the police...

604
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,917
and when I was there,
I saw the thing that hurt Grandma.

605
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,490
And, Candy, it's dead.

606
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:46,693
I saw it lying on a table,
and the police were there, and it's dead.

607
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,363
It can't hurt you now.

608
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,942
And it can't hurt me or anybody else.

609
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,938
Do you understand me?

610
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,041
It's dead?

611
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,008
Yes.

612
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,960
It's all right now, baby.

613
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,307
What do you think?

614
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:31,075
How many people do we have
at the main house?

615
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:32,541
Twenty-seven.

616
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,418
Okay, I want them out by this afternoon...

617
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:38,711
and the house closed.

618
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,452
It'll be hard on them, Hal, especially Mike.

619
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:45,994
Then do it gently.

620
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:48,661
But get them out.

621
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,195
All right.

622
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,951
- Put your suitcases in the compartment.
- I don't want to go.

623
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:23,328
You have to go.
Come on. I just want you to get on the bus...

624
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,194
You'll see the doctor.

625
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,833
I don't want to go.

626
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,436
- Don't make me leave.
- I'm not making you leave.

627
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:36,774
Just be a good boy
and get on the bus, all right?

628
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,191
- Hi, Jan.
- Frank, hi.

629
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:53,224
Look, I think we've got ourselves
a real live one.

630
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,156
Come on upstairs.
There's somebody I want you to meet.

631
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,805
Is this the guy from Chicago?

632
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,339
No. He's a local boy.

633
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:12,213
He lives a lot closer to home
than you expected.

634
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,197
Mr. Carveth is here to see you.

635
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,068
Look who's here.

636
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,910
Nola's old man.

637
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:48,212
- The queen bee's favorite drone.
- Jeez, he's pretty far gone.

638
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:49,879
He'd be dynamite in court.

639
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:56,817
What did you mean when you said
Nola's the queen bee?

640
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,121
She's the queen bee, all right.
She's the star.

641
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:06,031
She's the one he's interested in,
and the rest of us don't count anymore.

642
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:09,103
She doesn't even have to pay for it.

643
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:13,236
That's because she's the one
who was born to prove...

644
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:17,810
that "psychoplasmics
is the ultimate therapeutic device."

645
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,981
That's the quote, isn't it?

646
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:25,247
Can you be my daddy?
He won't do it anymore.

647
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:27,513
And my real daddy won't do it.

648
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:30,852
And that bastard, Dr. Raglan,
won't do it anymore.

649
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,896
You see, my real daddy rejected me.

650
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:39,195
And my surrogate daddy rejected me.

651
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,668
That's just fucking wonderful,
don't you think?

652
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:45,400
Calm down, Mike. Cool it,
and tell him what happened at Somafree.

653
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:47,936
Look...

654
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,805
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

655
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,519
Just be my daddy.

656
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,422
Please. I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

657
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,215
I'll bleed for you. Want me to bleed?

658
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:05,416
No.

659
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:09,430
That's silly, right?
Repulses you, I can see that.

660
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,029
You're not into it, so why do it, right?

661
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:18,140
Besides, nobody could do it like Dr. Raglan.

662
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,876
Not even real daddy.

663
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,078
And he knows it.

664
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:28,779
Dr. Raglan knows I'm addicted to him...

665
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,814
and he doesn't care.

666
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,752
He's such a hard man.

667
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,358
I was at that demonstration last Monday.

668
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,632
You and Raglan seemed very close.
What happened?

669
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,533
He threw us out. All of us.

670
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:49,802
Locked the door.

671
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,942
It's true.
I've been in touch with some of the others.

672
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:59,180
They've all been thrown out of Somafree,
and all therapy suspended.

673
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,977
All except for your wife. She's still there.

674
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:08,284
Doesn't anybody know why?

675
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:13,019
Sure somebody knows. I know.
He wants to be alone with her.

676
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:15,756
Dr. Raglan wants to be alone with your wife.

677
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,359
- 'Bye, Daddy.
- 'Bye.

678
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,163
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi, Wendy.

679
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:08,941
Quickly but quietly, children.

680
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:33,595
Rebecca, do you want to pass out
the blue papers, please?

681
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,638
And Clayton, how about you pass out
the purple ones?

682
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:40,670
Okay, let's see.

683
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,485
This person here?

684
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,065
You can do snowflakes, too.
That's a good idea.

685
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,076
Help!

686
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,851
- What's the matter?
- They're hurting Ms. Mayer.

687
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,785
The bad kids are hurting Ms. Mayer.

688
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,324
They knocked her to the floor
and they're hitting her.

689
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:06,293
They're hitting Ms. Mayer.
They made her fall down!

690
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:57,605
Candy!

691
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,959
It's all right. It's Hal.

692
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:23,094
Where's Chris? Chris usually wakes me up.

693
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,498
Chris had to go into the city.

694
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,233
You've been dreaming?

695
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,513
Yes. I was having a wonderful dream.

696
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:33,942
Wonderful.

697
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:37,442
And painful, at the same time.

698
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,648
My daughter was coming back to me.

699
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:42,783
And Frank.

700
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,090
And Ruth Mayer?

701
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,026
Was she in your dream?

702
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:51,433
Candy's teacher?

703
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,702
I don't remember.

704
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,603
Then maybe we should talk about her.

705
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:03,036
But I don't feel the need to talk about her.

706
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,172
You don't?

707
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,273
Why not?

708
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,643
I don't know.

709
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:17,581
I think I must be getting stronger,
because somehow...

710
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,121
I just don't feel threatened by her anymore.

711
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:57,597
This is where my wife and kid lived
for nine months...

712
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,725
before Nola moved out to Somafree.

713
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,228
This is the first time I've seen the place.

714
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,968
What are we doing here?

715
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:10,740
Tell me, again.

716
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,513
I don't know.

717
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,483
I thought Candy might come back here.

718
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:30,494
It's not a coincidence.

719
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,962
Those things, those creatures...

720
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,104
they all disappeared together.

721
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:39,206
They've got her.

722
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,321
You've got to help me.
Somebody's following me.

723
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,259
- Somebody's always following me.
- Did you find out anything?

724
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:10,992
- Did you find out why they moved you out?
- I've got to have something to eat. Anything.

725
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:15,029
What did you find out?
Why did they close Somafree down?

726
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:17,869
- Talk to me! Now!
- Okay.

727
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:22,309
Raglan's onto something very big,
something to do with the kids.

728
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,876
- He just got bored with the rest of us.
- Kids? What kids?

729
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,716
The disturbed kids in the work shed...

730
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,513
the ones your wife's taking care of.

731
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,220
What have you done with my kid?

732
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,144
Where is she?

733
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:53,251
Carveth, what the hell
are you talking about?

734
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,459
They took her.

735
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:00,663
They killed Ruth Mayer,
and then they brought Candice back here.

736
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,443
They killed Ruth Mayer?

737
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:22,419
I want my daughter back, now.

738
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:26,456
Did they bring her back here, back to Nola?

739
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,323
I don't know.

740
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:33,057
If they brought her back here,
then she'd be up there, in the attic.

741
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:36,095
That's where they live.

742
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:45,937
Frank, I've got a gun.

743
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:52,813
They'll kill you
if you try to take her away from them.

744
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:56,958
Why?

745
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,385
Because they understand
that she's one of them.

746
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,226
You're insane.

747
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:06,693
Frank, they exist. You've seen them.

748
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:11,534
They're just freaks. Deformed children.

749
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:14,499
You've got Nola taking care of them.

750
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,704
I'm sure she loves being
their surrogate mother.

751
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:20,278
She's not their surrogate mother.

752
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,280
She's their real mother.

753
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,685
Their only mother.

754
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:31,153
- I'm not gonna listen.
- They're her children.

755
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:34,990
More exactly,
they're the children of her rage.

756
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:38,031
They're motivated only by her anger,
whether that anger...

757
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:40,124
is conscious or subconscious.

758
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,600
I mean, when Nola got cross with Candy
last weekend...

759
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,505
annoyed, really...

760
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:48,575
the brood beat her.

761
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:53,311
But when she released her rage
against her parents, under therapy...

762
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:56,110
then they killed them.

763
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:59,453
I know, I didn't want to believe that...

764
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,886
but now they've killed Ruth Mayer...

765
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,686
and they could kill you or me,
and she wouldn't even be aware of it.

766
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,525
I mean, she doesn't even know
that Candy's here.

767
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:15,564
- I want Candice back.
- Then do it my way.

768
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:17,806
Please.

769
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,207
It's the right way.

770
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,406
What do you want me to do?

771
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,578
I want you to go back into that hut...

772
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:30,374
and persuade Nola that you want her back...

773
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,388
that you want your family back.

774
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:37,147
I want you to play the role
of apologetic lover and husband.

775
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,749
Why?

776
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:41,655
Because if you can keep Nola
calm and happy...

777
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:43,895
then the brood's neutral.

778
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:48,058
If she's mellow,
then I can just walk into that attic...

779
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:51,936
pick up Candy,
tuck her under my arm and walk out.

780
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,398
Now, can you do that?

781
01:16:57,813 --> 01:16:59,075
I don't know.

782
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,980
Frank, if things go wrong...

783
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,747
if Nola gets angry, if the kids get angry...

784
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,757
You understand?

785
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:13,752
I'm not going to be the only one
to pay for that anger.

786
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:15,825
Raglan, I don't trust you.

787
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:20,965
What does it matter?

788
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:25,066
I'll move up there 30 seconds after you're in.

789
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:36,548
Frank, be nice to her.

790
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,079
Hal?

791
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:19,186
It's me, Nola. It's Frank.

792
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:26,495
Am I dreaming?

793
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:31,705
I thought you said you weren't going to
come and see me while I was here.

794
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:36,904
I think that was a misunderstanding.

795
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:43,841
That's why I'm here.

796
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:47,981
I want us to understand each other.

797
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,900
You're the only woman in the world for me.

798
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:35,726
You always have been, you always will be.

799
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,366
It won't ever change.

800
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:42,470
I want you to know that.

801
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:46,038
I wish it were true. God, I wish it were true.

802
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:17,506
We lost touch.

803
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,908
That's the only reason
all this ever happened.

804
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:26,376
All we have to do
is make sure we don't lose touch again.

805
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:31,014
Isolation is part of my therapy.

806
01:20:33,095 --> 01:20:36,428
What's been happening to me
has been just too strange...

807
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:40,965
too strange for me to share
with anyone from my old life.

808
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:45,535
Then make me a part of your new life.

809
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,266
Let me be part of it.

810
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,378
Show me, educate me, involve me.

811
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:56,013
I'm ready now.
I wasn't before, but I'm ready now.

812
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:08,389
Candy?

813
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:16,099
Are you ready for me, Frank?

814
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:19,505
Are you really?

815
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:24,207
I seem to be a very special person.

816
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:27,710
I'm in the middle of a strange adventure.

817
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:31,718
Let me be with you.

818
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:36,253
I want to go with you wherever you go.

819
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,192
Do you?

820
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:43,264
Do you?

821
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:46,834
Yes.

822
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:49,734
Then look.

823
01:22:32,214 --> 01:22:33,181
Daddy?

824
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,949
Is it time to go to school yet?

825
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,250
No, sweetheart.

826
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:41,784
It's Dr. Hal.

827
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:45,258
And Daddy's downstairs talking to Mommy.

828
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:47,595
He wants to see you.

829
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,335
Oh, God, Nola.

830
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,473
No, I disgust you.

831
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:13,437
I sicken you.

832
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:15,680
You hate me.

833
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:20,679
You didn't come here because you love me.

834
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:24,888
You came here to take our daughter away
and give her to somebody else.

835
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:30,789
I wouldn't do that.

836
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,257
I wouldn't do that to you.

837
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:44,670
You go out of that door.
You find your daddy.

838
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:53,377
You liar. You're lying.

839
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:58,422
You're lying! I know!

840
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:45,832
I know you so well, and it won't work.

841
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:51,743
I'd kill Candice
before I let you take her away from me.

842
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:53,904
Do you hear me?

843
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:58,249
I'd kill Candice before I let you take her!

844
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:37,419
Make them stop.

845
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:48,401
They're doing what you want them to do.

846
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:56,034
You want them to kill Candice.

847
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:03,008
You make them stop, or I'll kill you.

848
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:04,809
Kill me.

849
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:36,961
We're going home, Candy.

850
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:41,200
We're going home.
