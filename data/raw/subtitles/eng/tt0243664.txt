1
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,774
You have cancer.

2
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:46,778
Miss Bearing, you have
advanced metastatic ovarian cancer.

3
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,377
Go on.

4
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:57,851
- You are a professor, Miss Bearing.
- Like yourself, Dr. Kelekian.

5
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:58,946
Why, yes.

6
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,590
Now then, you present with a growth
that unfortunately went undetected...

7
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,663
...in stages one, two, and three.

8
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,265
- Now it is an insidious adenocarcinoma...
- Insidious?

9
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,734
Insidious means undetectable at an early...

10
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,831
Insidious means treacherous.

11
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,169
- Shall I continue?
- By all means.

12
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,333
Good.

13
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,480
In invasive epithelial carcinoma...

14
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:25,575
...the most effective treatment modality
is a chemotherapeutic agent.

15
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,516
We are developing
an experimental combination of drugs...

16
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,922
...designed for primary-site ovarian,
for the target specificity of stage three...

17
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,924
...and beyond administration.

18
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,823
Am I going too fast?

19
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,355
No.

20
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,803
You will be hospitalized
as an in-patient for treatment each cycle.

21
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,835
After the initial eight cycles,
you will have another battery of tests.

22
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,542
The antineoplastic will inevitably
affect some healthy cells...

23
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,172
...including those lining
the gastrointestinal tract...

24
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,648
...from the lips to the anus,
and the hair follicles.

25
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,775
We will be relying on your resolve...

26
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,683
...to withstand some of the more
pernicious side effects.

27
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,488
I beg your pardon.

28
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,966
- Do you have any questions so far?
- Please, go on.

29
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:20,037
- Perhaps some of these terms are new...
- No, you're being very thorough.

30
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,704
I make a point of it.
I always emphasize it with my students.

31
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,937
So do I. Thoroughness,
I always tell my students...

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,743
...but, they are constitutionally
averse to painstaking work.

33
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,909
- Yours too.
- It's worse every year.

34
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,248
- Mine are blind.
- Mine are deaf.

35
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,717
- You just have to hope.
- I suppose so.

36
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,991
Where were we?

37
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,425
I believe I was being thoroughly diagnosed.

38
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,723
Right.

39
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,826
Now, the tumor is spreading very quickly.

40
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,933
And this treatment is very aggressive.

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,431
- So far, so good?
- Yes.

42
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,741
- Better not teach next semester.
- Out of the question.

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,213
The first week of each cycle
you'll be hospitalized for chemotherapy.

44
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,648
The next week you may feel a little tired.

45
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,415
- The next two will be fine, relatively.
- Eight months like that.

46
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,355
This treatment is the strongest thing
we have to offer you.

47
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,487
And as research it'll make a significant
contribution to our knowledge.

48
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,729
Knowledge. Yes.

49
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,737
Here is the informed consent form.

50
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:32,001
Should you agree,
you sign there, at the bottom.

51
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,589
Is there a family member
you want me to explain this to?

52
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,521
That won't be necessary.

53
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,092
Good.

54
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,665
The important thing is for you to take
the full dose of chemotherapy.

55
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,930
There may be times when you wish
for a lesser dose, due to the side effects.

56
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,300
But we've got to go full force.

57
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,174
- Dr. Bearing?
- Yes.

58
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,769
You must be very tough.

59
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,947
Do you think you can be very tough?

60
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,578
You needn't worry.

61
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:12,875
Good.

62
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,978
Excellent.

63
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,658
I should have asked more questions.

64
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,293
Because I knew
there was going to be a test.

65
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:38,271
- Hi, how you feeling today?
- Fine.

66
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,406
Great. That's just great.

67
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,984
This is not my standard greeting,
I assure you.

68
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,053
I tend toward something
a little more formal...

69
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,183
...a little less inquisitive.

70
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,054
Such as, say, "Hello. "

71
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,994
But it is the standard greeting here,
so I just say, "Fine. "

72
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,070
Of course, it is not very often
that I do feel fine.

73
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:14,446
I've been asked, "How are you feeling?"
While throwing up into a plastic washbasin.

74
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,639
I have been asked...

75
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:20,182
...as I was emerging
from a four-hour operation...

76
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,786
...with a tube in every orifice:

77
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,452
"How are you feeling today?"

78
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,388
I'm waiting for the moment when
I'm asked this question and I'm dead.

79
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,690
I'm a little sorry I'll miss that.

80
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,199
I have cancer.

81
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,342
Insidious cancer,
with pernicious side effects.

82
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,507
No, the treatment
has pernicious side effects.

83
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:55,450
I have stage four
metastatic ovarian cancer.

84
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,119
There is no stage five.

85
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,687
And I have to be very tough.

86
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,330
It appears to be a matter,
as the saying goes...

87
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,597
...of life and death.

88
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,000
I know all about life and death.

89
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:18,306
I am, after all,
a professor of 17th century poetry...

90
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,607
...specializing in
the "Holy Sonnets" of John Donne...

91
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,648
...which explore mortality
in greater depth...

92
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,252
...than any body of work
in the English language.

93
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,585
And I know for a fact that I am tough.

94
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,283
A demanding professor.

95
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,417
Uncompromising.

96
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,128
Never one to turn from a challenge.

97
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,490
That is why I chose to study John Donne...

98
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,966
...while a student
of the great E.M. Ashford.

99
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:51,770
Oh, yes.

100
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,339
Your essay on "Holy Sonnet VI" Miss Bearing...

101
00:06:57,415 --> 00:07:00,441
...is a melodrama with a veneer
of scholarship unworthy of you...

102
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:02,577
...to say nothing of Donne. Do it again.

103
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:08,154
Begin with the text, Miss Bearing,
not with a feeling.

104
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:11,159
"Death be not proud

105
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:14,926
"Though some have called thee
mighty and dreadful, for

106
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,300
"Thou art not so"

107
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:19,669
You've entirely missed the point of the poem...

108
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:22,297
...because you've used
an edition of the text...

109
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,499
...that is inauthentically punctuated.

110
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,537
- In the Gardner edition...
- That edition was checked out...

111
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,580
- Miss Bearing?
- Sorry.

112
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:32,139
You take this too lightly.

113
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:35,215
This is metaphysical poetry,
not the modern novel.

114
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:38,255
The standards of scholarship
and critical reading...

115
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:41,656
...which one would apply to any other text
are simply insufficient.

116
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:45,384
The effort must be total
for the results to be meaningful.

117
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:51,361
Do you think that the punctuation
of the last line of this sonnet...

118
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:53,904
...is merely an insignificant detail?

119
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,709
The sonnet begins with
a valiant struggle with death...

120
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:01,438
...calling on all the forces
of intellect and drama...

121
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,444
...to vanquish the enemy.

122
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:08,351
But it is ultimately about overcoming
the seemingly insuperable barriers...

123
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:12,047
...separating life, death and eternal life.

124
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:17,984
In the edition you chose,
this profoundly simple meaning...

125
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,690
...is sacrificed to hysterical punctuation.

126
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,465
"And Death" capital D...

127
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,399
..."shall be no more;" semi-colon...

128
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:30,302
..."Death," capital D, comma...

129
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:33,841
..."thou shalt die!", exclamation mark.

130
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,079
If you go in for this sort of thing
I suggest you take up Shakespeare.

131
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:41,681
Gardner's edition of the "Holy Sonnets"...

132
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:45,416
...returns to the Westmoreland
manuscript source of 1610.

133
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:47,956
Not for sentimental reasons, I assure you...

134
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:51,550
...but because Helen Gardner is a scholar.

135
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,288
It reads:

136
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:58,466
"And death shall be no more," comma...

137
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,570
..."Death thou shalt die. "

138
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,304
Nothing but a breath, a comma...

139
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,708
...separates life from life everlasting.

140
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,304
Very simple, really.

141
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:13,816
With the original punctuation restored,
death is no longer something...

142
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:17,410
...to act out on a stage
with exclamation marks.

143
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:21,657
It is a comma. A pause.

144
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:25,295
In this way, the uncompromising way...

145
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:28,125
...one learns something
from the poem, wouldn't you say?

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,197
Life, death, soul, God...

147
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:34,664
...past, present.

148
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,230
Not insuperable barriers.

149
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:40,475
Not semicolons.

150
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:42,940
<i>Just a comma.</i>

151
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:48,246
Life, death, I see.

152
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:52,384
It's a metaphysical conceit, it's wit.

153
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:56,450
- I'll go back to the library...
- It is not wit, Miss Bearing, it is truth.

154
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:57,858
The paper's not the point.

155
00:09:58,596 --> 00:09:59,824
Isn't it?

156
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:03,700
Vivian, you're a bright young woman.

157
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,434
Use your intelligence.

158
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:09,965
Don't go back to the library, go out.

159
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:12,869
Enjoy yourself with friends.

160
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:23,587
<i>I went outside.</i>

161
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:25,849
<i>It was a warm day.</i>

162
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:32,185
<i>There were students on the lawn
talking about nothing, laughing.</i>

163
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:35,758
<i>Simple human truth.</i>

164
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,097
Uncompromising scholarly standards.

165
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:43,569
They're connected.

166
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:46,406
I just couldn't...

167
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:52,212
I went back to the library.

168
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:55,342
Anyway...

169
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:58,879
All right.

170
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:03,391
"Significant contribution to knowledge. "

171
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:07,726
"Eight cycles of chemotherapy. "

172
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,829
Give me the full dose.

173
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:14,036
The full dose every time.

174
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:20,276
<i>The attention was flattering...</i>

175
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:23,378
<i>...for the first five minutes.</i>

176
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:39,187
- Name?
- My name?

177
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,855
Vivian Bearing.

178
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:46,002
Bearing. B-e-a-r-i-n-g.

179
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,295
Vivian. V-i-v-i-a-n.

180
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,741
- Doctor?
- Yes, I have a Ph. D.

181
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,477
Your doctor?

182
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:58,013
Dr. Harvey Kelekian.

183
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:10,755
I am a doctor of philosophy.

184
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,595
Take a deep breath and hold it.

185
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:16,693
Okay.

186
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,502
A scholar of 17th century poetry.

187
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:22,431
Arms above your head, and hold it.

188
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,535
Okay.

189
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,613
I have made an immeasurable contribution
to the discipline of English literature.

190
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:34,679
I am, in short, a force.

191
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,216
Okay, that's it.

192
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:37,781
Name?

193
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:40,623
Lucy, Countess of Bedford.

194
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:45,130
- I don't see it here.
- My name is Vivian Bearing.

195
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:48,562
B- e-a-r-i-n-g. Dr. Kelekian is my doctor.

196
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:51,265
Okay, lie down.

197
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:06,777
After an astounding undergraduate career...

198
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:09,781
...I studied for three years
with Prof. E.M. Ashford...

199
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:12,550
...during which I learned
by instruction and example...

200
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,284
...what it means to be
a scholar of distinction.

201
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:17,951
As a research Fellow, my principal task...

202
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:23,090
...was the alphabetizing of index cards
for Ashford's monumental critical edition...

203
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:27,867
<i>...of Donne's
Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions.</i>

204
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:31,368
I am thanked in the preface.

205
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:36,775
"Miss Vivian Bearing,
for her able assistance. "

206
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,554
Thank you.

207
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,296
Where's your wheelchair?

208
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:57,259
I do not know. I was busy, just now.

209
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:59,629
How you gonna get outta here?

210
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:02,531
- I could walk.
- It's not permitted.

211
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:06,174
I do not know,
perhaps you would like me to stay?

212
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:09,178
I guess I gotta go find you a chair.

213
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:13,410
Don't inconvenience yourself on my behalf.

214
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:21,351
Miss Bearing, this is Jason Posner.

215
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:24,884
He's gonna do your medical history
and ask you a few questions.

216
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,858
He's Dr. Kelekian's Fellow.

217
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:30,592
I'm Dr. Posner, clinical Fellow
at the medical oncology branch...

218
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,329
...working with Dr. Kelekian.

219
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:33,665
Sit over here, please.

220
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:36,968
Prof. Bearing,
I was a student at the university.

221
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:40,569
- Took your course in 17th century poetry.
- Did you?

222
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,272
Yes, I thought it was excellent.

223
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,906
Thank you.

224
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:47,076
- Were you an English major?
- No, biochemistry.

225
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,881
You can't get into med school
unless you're well-rounded.

226
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:53,488
I bet with myself I could get an A
in the three hardest courses.

227
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,717
How'd you do?

228
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:57,257
- Success.
- Really?

229
00:14:57,395 --> 00:15:00,853
A- minus. It was a very tough course.

230
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,662
- Yeah, I'll call you.
- Okay.

231
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,605
I'll just wheel this over.

232
00:15:12,877 --> 00:15:16,973
Okay, I'm going to be taking your history...

233
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:20,217
...which is a medical interview,
and then I give you an exam.

234
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:23,148
I believe Dr. Kelekian
has already done that.

235
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:26,251
I know, but Dr. Kelekian
wanted me to do one too.

236
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:27,816
Very well.

237
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,423
Okay, let's just get started.

238
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:32,919
- How are you feeling today?
- Fine, thank you.

239
00:15:32,997 --> 00:15:35,158
- And how's your general health?
- Fine.

240
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,494
Good.

241
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:40,070
- We know that you're an academic.
- Yes, we've established that.

242
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:42,971
- So we don't need to talk about your work.
- No.

243
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,299
- How old are you?
- 48.

244
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:47,969
- Are you married?
- No.

245
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:49,411
- Are your parents living?
- No.

246
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,072
How and when did they die?

247
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:55,117
My father, suddenly,
of a heart attack when I was 21.

248
00:15:55,286 --> 00:16:00,314
My mother, slowly, when I was 41 or 42.
Of breast cancer.

249
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,948
- Cancer?
- Breast cancer.

250
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:05,394
- I see. Any siblings?
- No.

251
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,725
And now your past medical history.

252
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,133
- Have you ever been hospitalized?
- I had my tonsils out when I was eight.

253
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:14,362
- Have you ever been pregnant?
- No.

254
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:15,665
- Heart murmurs?
- No.

255
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,207
- High blood pressure?
- No.

256
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:19,640
- Venereal diseases, uterine infections...
- No.

257
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:23,508
- Thyroid, diabetes, cancer...
- No. Cancer, yes.

258
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:25,612
- When?
- Now.

259
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:30,217
- Not including now.
- In that case, no.

260
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:32,247
Okay.

261
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,686
Clinical depression, nervous breakdown,
suicide attempts...

262
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:36,782
No.

263
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:38,325
- Do you smoke?
- No.

264
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:41,023
- Ethanol.
- I beg your pardon?

265
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:43,058
Alcohol.

266
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:47,563
- Ethanol. Yes, I drink wine.
- How much, how often?

267
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:52,166
A glass, with dinner, occasionally,
and perhaps a scotch every now and then.

268
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:54,675
- Do you use any substances?
- Such as?

269
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:57,840
Marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine,
PCP, ecstasy, poppers...

270
00:16:57,982 --> 00:16:59,040
No.

271
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:02,314
- Do you drink caffeinated beverages?
- Yes.

272
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:05,181
- Which ones?
- Coffee, a few cups a day.

273
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:09,484
- How many?
- Two to six.

274
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,861
But I don't think that's immoderate.

275
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,056
How often do you have
routine medical checkups?

276
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:18,000
Not as often as I should probably,
but I've felt fine, I really have.

277
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,038
- So, the answer is?
- Every three to five years.

278
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,639
What do you do for exercise?

279
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:28,238
Pace.

280
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:34,244
- Are you having sexual relations?
- Not at the moment.

281
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,345
- Are you pre or post-menopausal?
- Post.

282
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:42,157
- When did your periods stop?
- About two years ago.

283
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:44,726
Okay.

284
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:48,961
When did you first notice
your present complaint?

285
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,228
- This time, now?
- Yes.

286
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:56,906
About four months ago, I felt a pain
in my stomach, in my abdomen...

287
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:59,299
...like a cramp, but not the same.

288
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:01,345
- How did it feel?
- Like a cramp.

289
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:04,245
- But not the same?
- Duller and stronger, I can't describe it.

290
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,519
- What happened next?
- I don't know...

291
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:13,215
...I started noticing my body, little things.
I would be teaching and feel a sharp pain.

292
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,280
What kind of pain?

293
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,892
Sharp...

294
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,657
...and sudden.

295
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:20,727
Then it would go away,
or, I would be tired...

296
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:23,466
Exhausted. I was working
on a major project...

297
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,161
...the article on John Donne...

298
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:27,727
<i>...for the Oxford Encyclopedia
of English Literature.</i>

299
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:31,035
It was a great honor,
but I had a very strict deadline.

300
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:34,667
- Were you under stress?
- It wasn't much more stress than usual...

301
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:36,804
...I just couldn't withstand it this time.

302
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:38,211
So...

303
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,816
I went to see Dr. Chin, my gynecologist,
after I'd turned in the article.

304
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:46,719
She examined me,
sent me to Jefferson, the internist...

305
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,158
...who sent me to Kelekian
because he thought I might have a tumor.

306
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:53,454
- And that's it.
- Till now.

307
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:57,301
That's very interesting.

308
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,326
I guess we'll start the exam.

309
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:05,435
Why don't you just sort of lie back
and relax.

310
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:09,272
Won't take a minute.

311
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,914
Let me get this sheet.

312
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:21,956
Here.

313
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:24,555
Okay.

314
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:28,460
Yeah, just...

315
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:36,663
Feet in the stirrups here.

316
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:38,633
Okay.

317
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:45,372
Okay.

318
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:50,417
Could you just... yeah.

319
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:52,919
There. Okay.

320
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,251
Good, okay.

321
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:00,985
Okay.

322
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,025
I've got to go get Susie.

323
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:10,400
I've got to have a girl here,
some crazy, clinical rule.

324
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,767
Don't move, I'll be right back.

325
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:22,074
I wish I had given him an A.

326
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:31,716
Two times one is two.
Two times two is four.

327
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:33,624
Two times three is six.

328
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:50,003
"Death be not proud

329
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:52,977
"Though some have called thee
mighty and dreadful

330
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:57,086
"For, thou art not so

331
00:20:57,854 --> 00:21:02,291
"For, those whom thou think'st,
thou dost overthrow

332
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,187
"Die not, poor death

333
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:08,696
"Nor yet canst thou kill me"

334
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,360
Has anybody seen Susie?

335
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:22,003
"One short sleep past

336
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:24,480
"We wake eternally

337
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:27,773
"And death shall be no more,"...

338
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:30,181
...comma.

339
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:34,279
"Death thou shalt die"

340
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:39,628
Okay, here's everything.

341
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:43,255
- Why did you leave her like this?
- I had to find you, now come on.

342
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:45,758
We're ready, Prof. Bearing.

343
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,697
Just get this on.

344
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,241
All right.

345
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:56,909
Just get this up.

346
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:58,946
Just relax.

347
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,578
Okay.

348
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:07,588
Isn't that interesting, Susie,
that I had Prof. Bearing?

349
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:10,192
Yeah. I wish I had taken some literature.

350
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,294
I don't know anything about poetry.

351
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:14,626
Prof. Bearing was
highly regarded on campus.

352
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:17,326
Her course looked very good
on my transcript.

353
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,494
They even asked me about it
in my interview to medical school.

354
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:23,099
- Jesus.
- What?

355
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:24,865
What?

356
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:28,171
Yeah, I survived Bearing's course.
Yeah, no problem.

357
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:30,743
Yeah, John Donne,
those metaphysical poets?

358
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:34,783
That metaphysical wit.
Hardest poetry in the English department.

359
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:37,316
Like to see them try biochemistry.

360
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:38,776
Okay.

361
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:42,349
We're almost done, all right. Yeah, okay.

362
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:46,992
That's it, we're done.

363
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:51,023
I gotta go.

364
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:54,936
Take her feet out. Yeah.

365
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:12,613
Thank you.

366
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:16,753
I'm just gonna...

367
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:44,719
That was...

368
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:46,615
...hard.

369
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:49,983
That was...

370
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:56,955
One thing that can be said...

371
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:59,524
...for an eight-month course
of cancer treatment:

372
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:03,164
It is highly educational.

373
00:24:03,707 --> 00:24:05,868
I am learning to suffer.

374
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:12,812
Yes, it is mildly uncomfortable
to have an electrocardiogram, but...

375
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:17,415
...the agony of a colonoscopy
sweeps it from memory.

376
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:22,948
Yes, it was embarrassing
to have to wear a nightgown all day long.

377
00:24:23,426 --> 00:24:24,950
Two nightgowns.

378
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:30,657
But that seemed like a positive privilege
compared to watching myself go bald.

379
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:35,570
Yes, having a former student
give me a pelvic exam...

380
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:38,805
...was thoroughly...

381
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:40,574
...degrading.

382
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:43,211
And I use the term deliberately.

383
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,306
But...

384
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:51,321
...I could not have imagined
the depths of humiliation...

385
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:09,002
Oh, God.

386
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:11,704
Please...

387
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:18,841
Steady.

388
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:21,573
Steady.

389
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:24,580
Oh, God.

390
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:37,391
What's left?

391
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:41,629
I haven't eaten in two days.

392
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:44,939
What's left to puke?

393
00:25:56,285 --> 00:26:00,278
You may remark that my vocabulary
has taken a turn for the Anglo-Saxon.

394
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:05,560
God, I'm gonna barf my brains out.

395
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:15,537
If I did actually barf my brains out...

396
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:21,301
...it would be a great loss to my discipline.

397
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:24,444
Of course, many of my colleagues
would be relieved...

398
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:26,982
...to say nothing of my students.

399
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:30,544
It's not that I'm controversial.

400
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:34,052
Just uncompromising.

401
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:44,993
False alarm.

402
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:55,637
If the word went around that
Vivian Bearing had barfed her brains out...

403
00:26:56,646 --> 00:26:59,945
...first my colleagues,
most of whom are my former students...

404
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:03,847
...would scramble madly for my position.

405
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:06,386
And then their consciences would flare up.

406
00:27:06,456 --> 00:27:09,584
So to honor my memory,
they'd put together a collection...

407
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,093
...of their essays about John Donne.

408
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:17,164
The volume would begin
with a warm introduction...

409
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,633
...capturing my most endearing qualities.

410
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:23,138
It would be short but sweet.

411
00:27:24,874 --> 00:27:26,842
Published and perished.

412
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,137
Now, watch this.

413
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:36,049
I have to ring the bell.

414
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:42,247
<i>How you doing, Miss Bearing?
You having some nausea?</i>

415
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:46,216
<i>- Yes.
- Okay, I'll be with you in a second.</i>

416
00:27:47,096 --> 00:27:51,726
Someone has to come and
measure this emesis...

417
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:54,860
...and record it on a chart
of my intake and output.

418
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:58,099
This counts as output.

419
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,980
It's about 300 ccs.

420
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:12,315
Is that all?

421
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:16,091
It was very hard work.

422
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:19,891
Yeah, it's 300.

423
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:21,989
Good guess.

424
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,494
Okay.

425
00:28:26,068 --> 00:28:29,367
There anything else I can get you?
You want some Jello or something?

426
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:31,065
Thank you, no.

427
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:37,537
- Are you okay all by yourself in here?
- Yes.

428
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,749
Not having a lot of visitors, are you?

429
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:42,581
None...

430
00:28:43,553 --> 00:28:44,679
...to be precise.

431
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:46,613
I didn't think so.

432
00:28:47,557 --> 00:28:50,492
Is there somebody you want me to call,
or something?

433
00:28:51,027 --> 00:28:54,827
That won't be necessary.
I don't want visitors.

434
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:56,731
Okay.

435
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,357
I'll tell you what.

436
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:02,270
I'll come in every once in a while
to see how you're doing.

437
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:06,172
Make sure you're okay.
If you need anything, you just ring.

438
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:07,933
Thank you.

439
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:11,240
Okay.

440
00:29:16,385 --> 00:29:17,909
You just call.

441
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,049
<i>Do not forget...</i>

442
00:29:58,127 --> 00:30:01,426
<i>...that you are seeing
the most interesting aspects...</i>

443
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:05,695
<i>...of my tenure as an in-patient
receiving experimental chemotherapy...</i>

444
00:30:05,768 --> 00:30:08,635
<i>...for advanced metastatic ovarian cancer.</i>

445
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,868
<i>But as I am a scholar I feel obliged...</i>

446
00:30:14,243 --> 00:30:17,644
<i>...to document what it is like here
most of the time...</i>

447
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:20,648
<i>...between the dramatic climaxes.</i>

448
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:25,080
<i>In truth, it is like this:</i>

449
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:29,214
<i>You cannot imagine...</i>

450
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:33,394
<i>...how time can be so still.</i>

451
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,489
<i>It hangs.</i>

452
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,830
<i>It weighs.</i>

453
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:43,035
<i>And yet there is so little of it.</i>

454
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:46,234
<i>It goes so slowly.</i>

455
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:49,667
<i>And yet it is so scarce.</i>

456
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:55,781
<i>If I were writing this scene
it would last a full 15 minutes.</i>

457
00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:59,651
<i>I would lie here and you would sit there.</i>

458
00:31:05,094 --> 00:31:06,584
Not to worry:

459
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:10,627
"Brevity is the soul of wit. "

460
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:14,000
But...

461
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:18,666
...if you think eight months of cancer
treatment is tedious for all of you...

462
00:31:19,675 --> 00:31:22,473
...consider how it feels to play my part.

463
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:28,045
All right.

464
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:30,982
Let's say it's Friday morning.

465
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:34,820
"Grand rounds" is what they call it.

466
00:31:36,358 --> 00:31:37,848
Action!

467
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:43,120
- Dr. Bearing.
- Dr. Kelekian.

468
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:44,889
How are you feeling today?

469
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:47,128
- Fine.
- Great, just great.

470
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,131
Very late detection,
stage is four upon admission.

471
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:52,866
Hexamethophosphacil
with Vinplatin to potentiate.

472
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:56,907
Hex at 300 milligrams per meter squared,
Vin at 100.

473
00:31:57,378 --> 00:31:59,744
Today is cycle four, day three.

474
00:31:59,948 --> 00:32:02,143
All cycles are at the full dose.

475
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:05,181
Primary site is here, behind the left ovary.

476
00:32:05,253 --> 00:32:07,744
Metastases are suspected
in the peritoneal cavity...

477
00:32:07,822 --> 00:32:09,346
...mainly in this area here.

478
00:32:09,524 --> 00:32:12,721
Full lymphatic involvement.
At the time of first-look surgery...

479
00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:14,852
...a large part of the tumor was de-bulked...

480
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:17,864
...mainly in this area here.
Left and right ovaries...

481
00:32:17,932 --> 00:32:19,957
...fallopian tubes, uterus, all out.

482
00:32:20,735 --> 00:32:22,430
Evidence of primary-site shrinkage.

483
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:25,063
Shrinking in metastases
has not been documented.

484
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:28,472
Primary mass frankly palpable,
in pelvic exam...

485
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:30,968
...all through here.

486
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:34,506
Excellent command of details. Okay.

487
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:36,848
Problem areas with Hex and Vin?

488
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:39,216
- Myelosuppression...
- Myelosuppression...

489
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:41,152
...lowering blood-cell counts.

490
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:44,214
With this combination of agents,
nephrotoxicity will be next.

491
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,154
Anybody else?

492
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:50,496
Side effects?

493
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:52,857
Nausea, vomiting.

494
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,964
- Jason?
- Routine.

495
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:56,965
- Pain while urinating.
- Routine.

496
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,268
- Psychological depression?
- No way.

497
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:00,766
Anything else?

498
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:03,103
Other complaints with Hex and Vin?

499
00:33:04,912 --> 00:33:05,901
Come on.

500
00:33:07,982 --> 00:33:09,779
- Mouth sores?
- Not yet.

501
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:12,743
- Skin rash?
- No.

502
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:16,279
Why do we waste our time, Dr. Bearing?

503
00:33:16,357 --> 00:33:18,257
I do not know, Dr. Kelekian.

504
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:21,693
Use your eyes.

505
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:26,890
Good grief.

506
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,134
Hair loss.

507
00:33:29,237 --> 00:33:32,206
- Come on!
- You can see that!

508
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,568
Jason?

509
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:37,605
Hair loss after first cycle of treatment.

510
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:40,771
That's better. Dr. Bearing.

511
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:43,149
Full dose?

512
00:33:47,188 --> 00:33:51,284
Good, excellent. Keep pushing the fluids.

513
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:01,763
- Jason, clinical.
- Right.

514
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,903
Thank you, Prof. Bearing,
you've been very cooperative.

515
00:34:10,812 --> 00:34:13,246
Wasn't that grand?

516
00:34:14,415 --> 00:34:18,476
Full of subservience, hierarchies.

517
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:22,547
Gratuitous displays, sublimated rivalries.

518
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:26,423
I feel completely at home,
it is just like a graduate seminar.

519
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:29,491
With one important difference:

520
00:34:29,864 --> 00:34:33,322
In grand rounds they read me like a book.

521
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:35,659
Once I did the teaching...

522
00:34:35,736 --> 00:34:37,465
...now I am taught.

523
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:42,733
This is much easier,
I just hold still and look cancerous.

524
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:46,171
Jason was impressive, wasn't he?

525
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:49,080
I taught him, you know.

526
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:55,477
Nephrotoxicity,
kidney poisoning, myelosuppression.

527
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:57,552
They are medical terms.

528
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:01,994
I looked them up. It has always been
my custom to treat words with respect.

529
00:35:03,764 --> 00:35:06,392
I can recall the time...

530
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:09,265
...the very hour...

531
00:35:09,337 --> 00:35:11,396
...of the very day...

532
00:35:12,073 --> 00:35:14,803
...when I knew words
would be my life's work.

533
00:35:15,843 --> 00:35:17,708
I like that one best.

534
00:35:20,014 --> 00:35:21,982
Read another.

535
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:25,419
I think I'll read...

536
00:35:25,753 --> 00:35:28,278
<i>...The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies.</i>

537
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,087
It has little bunnies on the front.

538
00:35:43,304 --> 00:35:46,705
<i>"The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies...</i>

539
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:50,073
"... by Beatix Potter. "

540
00:35:55,616 --> 00:36:00,315
"It is said that the effect...

541
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:05,519
"... of eating too much lettuce...

542
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:09,186
"... is... "

543
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:13,327
What is this word?

544
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,463
Say it in bits.

545
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,940
"So-por-i-fic. "

546
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:26,373
What does that mean?

547
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:28,972
Soporific? Causing sleep.

548
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:33,381
- Causing sleep.
- Makes you sleepy.

549
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:39,893
- "So-por-fic" means "makes you sleepy. "
- That's right.

550
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,864
<i>Now, use it in a sentence.</i>

551
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:48,426
<i>What has a soporific effect on you?</i>

552
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,105
<i>What has a soporific effect on me?</i>

553
00:36:52,873 --> 00:36:54,568
<i>What makes you sleepy?</i>

554
00:36:58,579 --> 00:36:59,705
<i>Nothing.</i>

555
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:03,346
That's right.

556
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:06,345
What about you?

557
00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:10,488
What has a soporific effect on me?

558
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:11,923
Let me think.

559
00:37:12,293 --> 00:37:15,091
Boring conversation,
I suppose, after dinner.

560
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,291
Me too. Boring conversation.

561
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,928
Good, excellent. Carry on.

562
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:30,099
"It is said that the effect
of eating too much lettuce...

563
00:37:30,278 --> 00:37:32,473
"... is soporific. "

564
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:36,814
The bunnies in the picture are sleeping.

565
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:40,012
They're sleeping like you said,
because of sop-or-fic.

566
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,053
The illustration bore out
the meaning of the word...

567
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,692
...just as he had explained it.

568
00:37:49,497 --> 00:37:52,694
At the time it seemed like magic.

569
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:54,926
So...

570
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:58,739
...imagine the effect the words
of John Donne first had on me.

571
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,931
Ratiocination, concatenation.

572
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:05,509
Coruscation. Tergiversation.

573
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:09,741
Medical terms are less evocative.

574
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:13,277
Still...

575
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:18,155
...I want to know what the doctors mean
when they anatomize me.

576
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:22,590
My only defense is
the acquisition of vocabulary.

577
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:36,638
- Fever and neutropenia.
- Okay, when did it start?

578
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:41,982
I was at home reading.
I felt so bad, I got cold.

579
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:45,519
Fever and neutropenia.
They said to come in.

580
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:48,078
You did the right thing.
Did somebody drive you?

581
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:49,487
I took a taxi.

582
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:52,983
Can you walk?

583
00:38:56,764 --> 00:38:58,391
Okay, just sit here a minute.

584
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:02,800
<i>I'll get Jason, he's on call tonight
and he'll be able to give you some meds.</i>

585
00:39:02,871 --> 00:39:04,930
Glad I was here tonight.

586
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,202
I'm gonna get you to a bed soon, okay?

587
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,507
I'm gonna get you some nice juice
with lots of ice, okay?

588
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,275
Lights. I left all the lights on at my house.

589
00:39:19,354 --> 00:39:21,720
Don't worry about it. It'll be okay.

590
00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:37,004
Prof. Bearing, how you feeling?

591
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:39,036
My teeth are chattering.

592
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:43,669
- Vitals?
- Temp 102, pulse 120, respiration 36.

593
00:39:44,245 --> 00:39:46,577
Fever and neutropenia,
it's a shake and bake.

594
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:51,717
Blood culture and urine, stat. Admit her.
Prepare her for reverse isolation.

595
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:55,449
Start with acetaminophen.
Vitals every four hours.

596
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:05,259
You'd better talk to Kelekian
about lowering the dose next cycle.

597
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,960
It's too much for her.

598
00:40:07,035 --> 00:40:08,969
No way, she's tough, she can take it.

599
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:12,366
Full dose. Wake me when
the counts come from the lab.

600
00:40:41,703 --> 00:40:43,603
Good morning, Dr. Bearing.

601
00:40:43,671 --> 00:40:44,933
Full dose?

602
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:47,906
Definite progress, everything okay?

603
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:50,067
Yes.

604
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:52,311
You're doing swell.

605
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,714
Isolation's no problem, a couple of days.
Think of it as a vacation.

606
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:09,993
- Jason!
- What?

607
00:41:19,307 --> 00:41:21,207
In isolation...

608
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,208
...I am isolated.

609
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:29,414
For once I can use a term literally.

610
00:41:29,884 --> 00:41:34,651
The chemotherapeutic agents
eradicating my cancer...

611
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:38,850
...have also eradicated my immune system.

612
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:41,957
In my present condition...

613
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:46,964
...every living thing
is a health hazard to me.

614
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,000
I really have not got time for this.

615
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,541
Particularly health-care professionals.

616
00:41:55,610 --> 00:42:00,013
Just to check the I and O sheet
takes me a half an hour to do precautions.

617
00:42:01,883 --> 00:42:06,343
5, 7, 11. 250 twice. Okay.

618
00:42:12,593 --> 00:42:14,993
Prof. Bearing, how are you feeling today?

619
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:18,794
Fine, just shaking sometimes
from the chills.

620
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:22,302
IV should kick in anytime now, no problem.

621
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:25,331
Listen, I gotta go.
Keep pushing the fluids, okay?

622
00:42:37,385 --> 00:42:41,617
I am not in isolation because I have cancer.

623
00:42:42,623 --> 00:42:44,113
Because...

624
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:47,559
...I have a tumor the size of a grapefruit.

625
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,890
No...

626
00:42:51,132 --> 00:42:53,794
...I am in isolation...

627
00:42:53,868 --> 00:42:57,895
...because I am being treated for cancer.

628
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:04,606
My treatment imperils my health.

629
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:09,109
Herein lies the paradox.

630
00:43:10,618 --> 00:43:13,246
John Donne would revel in it.

631
00:43:15,456 --> 00:43:20,052
I would revel in it,
if he wrote a poem about it.

632
00:43:22,163 --> 00:43:26,691
My students would flounder in it...

633
00:43:27,168 --> 00:43:32,231
...because paradox is
too difficult to understand.

634
00:43:36,944 --> 00:43:40,539
"Think of it as a puzzle... "

635
00:43:40,782 --> 00:43:44,081
...I would tell them, "an intellectual game. "

636
00:43:49,824 --> 00:43:52,918
Or I would have told them...

637
00:43:54,462 --> 00:43:56,327
...were it a game.

638
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:01,999
Which it is not.

639
00:44:15,216 --> 00:44:18,777
"... threw death on else immortal us

640
00:44:20,188 --> 00:44:23,954
"If lecherous goats, if serpents envious

641
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:26,323
"Cannot be damned

642
00:44:26,394 --> 00:44:28,692
"Alas, why should I be?

643
00:44:28,963 --> 00:44:32,990
"Why should intent or reason, born in me

644
00:44:33,134 --> 00:44:37,002
"Make sins, else equal,
in me more heinous?

645
00:44:37,538 --> 00:44:40,336
"And mercy being easy,
and glorious to God

646
00:44:40,408 --> 00:44:44,003
"in his stern wrath, why threatens he?

647
00:44:46,247 --> 00:44:51,019
"But who am I,
that dare dispute with thee?

648
00:44:53,054 --> 00:44:58,321
"O God. Oh! Of thine only worthy blood,
and my tears

649
00:44:58,926 --> 00:45:01,190
"make a heavenly Lethean flood

650
00:45:01,262 --> 00:45:04,026
"And drown in it my sin's black memory

651
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:09,194
"That thou remember them,
some claim as debt

652
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,563
"I think it mercy, if thou wilt forget"

653
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:20,308
A typical prayer would plead,
"Remember me, O Lord. "

654
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:22,611
True believers ask to be
remembered by God.

655
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:26,380
The speaker of this sonnet
asks God to forget.

656
00:45:26,454 --> 00:45:30,220
We want to correct the speaker.

657
00:45:31,893 --> 00:45:34,259
To remind him of
the assurance of salvation.

658
00:45:34,362 --> 00:45:36,592
But it's too late,
the poetic encounter is over.

659
00:45:36,697 --> 00:45:38,562
We are left to our own consciences.

660
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:42,295
- Have we outwitted Donne?
- Miss Bearing.

661
00:45:43,438 --> 00:45:47,898
Or, have we been outwitted?

662
00:45:50,978 --> 00:45:52,502
What is it?

663
00:45:52,613 --> 00:45:55,480
You have to go down for a test.
Jason just called.

664
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,177
Another ultrasound.

665
00:45:57,251 --> 00:45:59,242
They're concerned
about a bowel obstruction.

666
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,289
- No, not now.
- I'm sorry, they want it now.

667
00:46:03,057 --> 00:46:05,150
Not right now,
it's not supposed to be now.

668
00:46:05,226 --> 00:46:07,524
They want to do it now, I've got the chair.

669
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,430
It should not be now, I...

670
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:14,491
I have this planned for now,
not an ultrasound.

671
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:16,833
- No more tests, we've covered that.
- I know.

672
00:46:16,971 --> 00:46:19,235
But they need for it to be now.

673
00:46:19,574 --> 00:46:23,169
It isn't a bad procedure and it won't take
long, so why don't you come now?

674
00:46:23,244 --> 00:46:25,678
I do not want to go now.

675
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:04,581
Name?

676
00:47:05,486 --> 00:47:07,920
B- e-a-r-i-n-g.

677
00:47:08,156 --> 00:47:09,350
Kelekian.

678
00:47:10,558 --> 00:47:12,253
It'll just be a minute.

679
00:47:13,828 --> 00:47:15,659
- Time for your break?
- Yeah.

680
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:19,193
Take a break.

681
00:47:34,815 --> 00:47:38,410
"This is my play's last scene

682
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:41,645
"Here

683
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:46,385
"Heavens appoint my pilgrimage's last mile

684
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:49,855
"And my race

685
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:54,668
"Idly, yet quickly run

686
00:47:55,036 --> 00:47:58,028
"Hath this last pace

687
00:48:00,575 --> 00:48:03,510
"My span's last inch

688
00:48:04,178 --> 00:48:07,306
"My minute's last point

689
00:48:08,316 --> 00:48:10,250
"And gluttonous death

690
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:15,346
"Will instantly unjoint my body and soul"

691
00:48:18,593 --> 00:48:20,390
John Donne...

692
00:48:20,962 --> 00:48:22,896
...1609.

693
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:28,931
I've always particularly liked that poem.

694
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:32,869
In the abstract.

695
00:48:35,977 --> 00:48:38,138
Now I find the image of...

696
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:41,180
...my minute's last point...

697
00:48:42,283 --> 00:48:44,911
...a little too, shall we say...

698
00:48:44,986 --> 00:48:46,476
...pointed.

699
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,791
I don't mean to complain
but I am becoming very sick.

700
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:57,622
Very sick. Ultimately sick, as it were.

701
00:49:01,302 --> 00:49:06,137
In everything I have done, I have been...

702
00:49:07,475 --> 00:49:09,340
...steadfast.

703
00:49:10,111 --> 00:49:11,544
Resolute.

704
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,910
Some would say in the extreme.

705
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,514
Now, as you can see, I am...

706
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:24,816
...distinguishing myself in illness.

707
00:49:28,062 --> 00:49:31,054
I have survived eight treatments...

708
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:34,295
...of Hexamethophosphacil and Vinplatin...

709
00:49:34,368 --> 00:49:38,395
...at the full dose, ladies and gentlemen.

710
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,076
I have broken the record.

711
00:49:44,812 --> 00:49:48,111
I have become something of a celebrity.

712
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:54,147
Kelekian and Jason are simply delighted.

713
00:49:55,923 --> 00:49:57,891
I think...

714
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:01,951
...they see celebrity status
for themselves...

715
00:50:02,229 --> 00:50:04,493
...upon the appearance
of the journal article...

716
00:50:04,565 --> 00:50:07,056
...they will no doubt write about me.

717
00:50:11,172 --> 00:50:13,231
But I flatter myself.

718
00:50:13,741 --> 00:50:16,266
The article will not be about me...

719
00:50:16,677 --> 00:50:19,168
...it will be about my ovaries. It will...

720
00:50:19,947 --> 00:50:24,509
...be about my peritoneal cavity.

721
00:50:24,885 --> 00:50:29,083
Which, despite their best intentions,
is now crawling with cancer.

722
00:50:33,994 --> 00:50:36,986
What we have come to think of as me...

723
00:50:37,732 --> 00:50:42,328
...is, in fact, just the specimen jar.

724
00:50:42,903 --> 00:50:44,996
Just the dust jacket.

725
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,408
Just the white piece of paper...

726
00:50:48,476 --> 00:50:51,536
...that bears the little black marks.

727
00:50:57,551 --> 00:51:00,486
My next line is supposed to be
something like this:

728
00:51:02,456 --> 00:51:04,083
"It is such a relief...

729
00:51:04,158 --> 00:51:07,753
"... to get back to my room
after those infernal tests. "

730
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:11,588
This is hardly true.

731
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,794
It would be a relief to be a cheerleader...

732
00:51:17,872 --> 00:51:21,638
...on her way to Daytona Beach
for spring break.

733
00:51:23,978 --> 00:51:26,947
To get back to my room
after those infernal tests...

734
00:51:27,014 --> 00:51:29,039
...is just the next thing that happens.

735
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,287
Oh, God.

736
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,416
It is such a relief to get back
to my goddamn room...

737
00:51:40,294 --> 00:51:43,525
...after those goddamn tests.

738
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:55,668
Professor Bearing?
Just wanna check your I and O.

739
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:02,505
450.

740
00:52:03,017 --> 00:52:04,575
6-5.

741
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:08,649
Okay. How you feeling today?

742
00:52:09,156 --> 00:52:11,920
- Fine.
- Great, that's just great.

743
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:15,456
How are my fluids?

744
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:19,659
Pretty good. No kidney involvement yet.
That's pretty amazing with Hex and Vin.

745
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,128
How will you know when
the kidneys are involved?

746
00:52:23,203 --> 00:52:26,263
- Lots of in, not much out.
- That simple?

747
00:52:27,474 --> 00:52:28,600
No way.

748
00:52:28,776 --> 00:52:31,973
Compromised kidney function is
a highly complex reaction.

749
00:52:32,746 --> 00:52:34,976
- I'm simplifying it for you.
- Thank you.

750
00:52:35,249 --> 00:52:37,843
- We're supposed to.
- Bedside manner.

751
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:40,886
There's a whole course on it in med school.
It's required.

752
00:52:41,155 --> 00:52:44,852
- Colossal waste of time for researchers.
- I can imagine.

753
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,418
Jason?

754
00:52:47,728 --> 00:52:50,356
- What were you saying just then?
- When?

755
00:52:53,867 --> 00:52:55,425
Never mind.

756
00:52:56,103 --> 00:52:58,936
Professor Bearing,
are you experiencing confusion?

757
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:01,434
- Short-term memory loss?
- No.

758
00:53:01,942 --> 00:53:03,273
- You sure?
- Yes.

759
00:53:04,178 --> 00:53:05,338
Okay.

760
00:53:05,913 --> 00:53:09,508
No, I was just wondering...

761
00:53:10,517 --> 00:53:11,814
...why cancer?

762
00:53:12,386 --> 00:53:13,683
Why cancer?

763
00:53:14,455 --> 00:53:16,616
Why not open-heart surgery?

764
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,289
Yeah.

765
00:53:20,894 --> 00:53:22,418
Why not plumbing?

766
00:53:22,496 --> 00:53:25,192
Why not run a lube rack
for all the surgeons know about...

767
00:53:25,265 --> 00:53:27,096
Homo sapien sapiens?

768
00:53:27,401 --> 00:53:30,632
No way.
Cancer's the only thing I ever wanted.

769
00:53:31,772 --> 00:53:34,707
No, really, cancer is...

770
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:38,267
Awesome?

771
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:39,573
Yeah.

772
00:53:39,646 --> 00:53:42,809
It is awesome. How does it do it?

773
00:53:42,883 --> 00:53:45,249
The intercellular regulatory mechanisms...

774
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:47,981
...especially for proliferation
and differentiation.

775
00:53:48,055 --> 00:53:52,583
- The malignant neoplasia just don't get it.
- Neoplasia, cancer cells.

776
00:53:52,659 --> 00:53:53,785
Yes, that's right.

777
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:57,495
You grow normal cells
in a tissue culture in a lab...

778
00:53:57,564 --> 00:54:00,465
...and they replicate enough
to form a confluent monolayer...

779
00:54:00,534 --> 00:54:03,867
...and then divide 20 or 50 times,
but eventually they conk out.

780
00:54:04,004 --> 00:54:07,667
You grow cancer cells and they never stop.

781
00:54:08,609 --> 00:54:11,874
No contact inhibition whatsoever,
they just pile up.

782
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:14,106
They keep replicating forever.

783
00:54:15,015 --> 00:54:17,040
It's got a great name.
Know what it's called?

784
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:20,244
- No, what?
- Immortality in culture.

785
00:54:20,988 --> 00:54:22,922
That sounds like a symposium.

786
00:54:23,056 --> 00:54:25,752
It's an error in judgment,
in a molecular way.

787
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,922
But why?

788
00:54:27,995 --> 00:54:31,556
Even on a protistic level
the normal cell-cell interactions...

789
00:54:32,065 --> 00:54:35,034
...are so subtle,
they take your breath away.

790
00:54:35,335 --> 00:54:37,530
It's incredible, it's perfect.

791
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:41,238
What's up with cancer cells?
Smartest guys in the world...

792
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:43,172
...the best labs, funding...

793
00:54:44,478 --> 00:54:46,309
They don't know what to make of it.

794
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,008
- What about you?
- Me?

795
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,875
I've got some things I'm kicking around.

796
00:54:51,952 --> 00:54:55,979
Wait till I get a lab of my own,
if I can survive this fellowship.

797
00:54:56,723 --> 00:54:58,623
The part with the human beings.

798
00:54:58,692 --> 00:55:01,092
Everybody has to do it,
all the best researchers.

799
00:55:01,195 --> 00:55:03,891
They want us to converse
intelligently with clinicians...

800
00:55:03,997 --> 00:55:06,431
...as if researchers were the impediment.

801
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,659
Clinicians are such troglodytes.
Just cut the crap, I say.

802
00:55:10,771 --> 00:55:12,602
Are you going to be sorry when...

803
00:55:17,244 --> 00:55:19,337
Do you ever miss people?

804
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,313
Everybody asks that, especially girls.

805
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:24,941
What do you tell them?

806
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:27,948
- I tell them, "Yes. "
- Are they persuaded?

807
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:30,854
- Some.
- Some, I see.

808
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:36,028
And what do you say when a patient is...

809
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:39,125
...apprehensive, frightened?

810
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:40,461
Of who?

811
00:55:43,437 --> 00:55:45,302
I just...

812
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:48,538
Never mind.

813
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:53,140
Who's the President of the United States?

814
00:55:53,213 --> 00:55:55,408
I'm fine. Really, it's all right.

815
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:58,315
- You sure? I could order a test...
- No.

816
00:56:00,654 --> 00:56:03,088
I'm fine. Just a little tired.

817
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:04,850
Okay.

818
00:56:05,592 --> 00:56:06,718
I gotta go.

819
00:56:06,793 --> 00:56:09,387
Keep pushing the fluids,
try for 2,000 a day, okay?

820
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:10,428
Okay.

821
00:56:13,867 --> 00:56:16,165
To use your word:

822
00:56:17,471 --> 00:56:18,995
"Okay. "

823
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:32,876
So...

824
00:56:34,221 --> 00:56:38,988
The young doctor, like the senior scholar...

825
00:56:39,426 --> 00:56:43,157
...prefers research to humanity.

826
00:56:44,464 --> 00:56:45,897
At the same time...

827
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:50,732
...the senior scholar,
in her pathetic state as simpering victim...

828
00:56:51,038 --> 00:56:54,701
...wishes the young doctor would take
more interest in personal contact.

829
00:56:56,877 --> 00:57:00,142
Now, I suppose we shall see
how the senior scholar...

830
00:57:00,213 --> 00:57:03,808
...ruthlessly denied
her simpering students...

831
00:57:03,884 --> 00:57:08,150
...the touch of human kindness
she now seeks.

832
00:57:13,427 --> 00:57:15,122
How, then...

833
00:57:15,195 --> 00:57:18,221
...would you characterize... You!

834
00:57:19,733 --> 00:57:22,759
How would you characterize
the animating force of this sonnet?

835
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,308
In this sonnet, what is the...

836
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:32,311
What is the principal poetic device?
I'll give you a hint:

837
00:57:32,379 --> 00:57:34,279
It has nothing to do with football.

838
00:57:34,348 --> 00:57:35,940
What propels this sonnet?

839
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:44,088
You can come to this class prepared,
or you can be excused from this class...

840
00:57:44,157 --> 00:57:46,622
...this department, and this university.

841
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:50,426
Do not think for a moment
that I will tolerate anything in between.

842
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:57,159
Did I say:

843
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:02,268
"You are 19 years old. You are so young.

844
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:05,606
"You don't know a sonnet
from a steak sandwich. "

845
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:10,608
By no means.

846
00:58:12,018 --> 00:58:13,610
To scan the line properly...

847
00:58:14,153 --> 00:58:17,589
...we must take advantage
of the contemporary flexibility...

848
00:58:17,657 --> 00:58:22,287
...in "i-o-n" endings, as in "expansion. "

849
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:24,926
The quatrain stands:

850
00:58:25,698 --> 00:58:30,101
"Our two souls therefore, which are one

851
00:58:30,236 --> 00:58:34,502
"Though I must go, endure not yet a breach

852
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,939
"But an expansion

853
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:42,743
"Like gold to aery thinness beat"

854
00:58:43,783 --> 00:58:45,842
Bear this in mind in your reading.

855
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,116
That's all for today.

856
00:59:02,535 --> 00:59:04,969
Prof. Bearing?
Can I talk to you for a minute?

857
00:59:05,037 --> 00:59:06,061
You may.

858
00:59:06,873 --> 00:59:09,137
I need to ask for an extension on my paper.

859
00:59:09,275 --> 00:59:13,371
- I'm sorry, I know your policy, but...
- Don't tell me, your grandmother died.

860
00:59:14,914 --> 00:59:16,973
- You knew?
- It was a guess.

861
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:18,610
I have to go home.

862
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:21,551
Do what you will,
but the paper is due when it is due.

863
00:59:36,202 --> 00:59:37,726
I don't know...

864
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,640
I feel so much...

865
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:47,372
What is the word?

866
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,413
I look back and I see these scenes and I...

867
01:00:37,363 --> 01:00:40,696
Miss Bearing,
is that you beeping at 4:00 a. M?

868
01:00:45,505 --> 01:00:47,132
Did that wake you?

869
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:51,242
Sorry, it just gets occluded sometimes.

870
01:00:51,344 --> 01:00:54,802
- I was awake.
- You were?

871
01:00:55,414 --> 01:00:57,348
What's the trouble, sweetheart?

872
01:00:58,017 --> 01:00:59,416
I don't know.

873
01:01:00,386 --> 01:01:01,683
Can't sleep?

874
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:03,914
No...

875
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:06,182
...I just keep thinking.

876
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,857
If you do that too much
you can get confused.

877
01:01:08,928 --> 01:01:09,917
I know.

878
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:13,930
I can't seem to figure things out.

879
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:20,067
I'm in a quandary. Having...

880
01:01:21,774 --> 01:01:23,605
...these doubts.

881
01:01:24,277 --> 01:01:26,575
What you're doing is very hard.

882
01:01:28,181 --> 01:01:32,049
- Hard things are what I like best.
- No, but it's not the same.

883
01:01:32,618 --> 01:01:36,179
- It's like it's out of control, isn't it?
- Yeah.

884
01:01:40,059 --> 01:01:41,253
I'm scared.

885
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,952
Honey, of course you are.

886
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,791
I'm worked up...

887
01:01:51,837 --> 01:01:54,567
I don't feel so sure of myself anymore.

888
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,835
And you used to feel sure, didn't you?

889
01:01:56,909 --> 01:02:00,845
Yes, yes, and I used to feel sure.

890
01:02:01,414 --> 01:02:04,645
It's okay. It's all right.

891
01:02:04,984 --> 01:02:07,316
And it hurts, I know.

892
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,848
It's all right.

893
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:19,789
There you go.

894
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:21,264
It's all right.

895
01:02:22,902 --> 01:02:25,496
It's okay, it's all right.

896
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:29,631
Vivian? You want a popsicle?

897
01:02:31,277 --> 01:02:33,142
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

898
01:02:33,379 --> 01:02:36,109
I'm gonna go get one.
I'll be right back, okay?

899
01:02:41,954 --> 01:02:44,218
The epithelial cells...

900
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:47,691
...in my GI tract...

901
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,126
...have been killed by the chemo.

902
01:02:50,863 --> 01:02:53,832
The cold popsicle feels good.

903
01:02:54,967 --> 01:02:58,630
It's something I can digest
and it helps keep me hydrated.

904
01:02:59,472 --> 01:03:00,837
For your information.

905
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:07,241
Here you go.

906
01:03:12,785 --> 01:03:14,946
- Here.
- You sure?

907
01:03:16,589 --> 01:03:18,853
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

908
01:03:36,242 --> 01:03:38,802
When I was a kid we used to
get these from a truck.

909
01:03:39,378 --> 01:03:42,370
A man would come around
and he'd ring his bell...

910
01:03:42,448 --> 01:03:44,575
...and we'd all go running over.

911
01:03:44,817 --> 01:03:48,275
And then we'd sit on the curb
and eat our popsicles.

912
01:03:50,389 --> 01:03:52,186
That's pretty profound, huh?

913
01:03:52,992 --> 01:03:54,482
Sounds nice.

914
01:03:59,899 --> 01:04:02,663
There's something we need to talk about.

915
01:04:03,235 --> 01:04:05,430
That you need to think about.

916
01:04:09,709 --> 01:04:12,041
My cancer's not being cured, is it?

917
01:04:13,879 --> 01:04:15,107
No.

918
01:04:18,718 --> 01:04:21,346
They never expected it to be, did they?

919
01:04:22,922 --> 01:04:26,323
They thought the drugs
would make the tumor get smaller.

920
01:04:26,459 --> 01:04:29,690
And it has, it's gotten a lot smaller.

921
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:33,927
But the problem is,
it's started in other places too.

922
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:38,330
They've learned a lot for their research
and it was the best they had...

923
01:04:38,404 --> 01:04:41,134
...it was the strongest drugs.
It's just that there...

924
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:45,468
There really isn't a good cure
for what you have yet.

925
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:48,046
For advanced ovarian.

926
01:04:51,384 --> 01:04:53,944
I'm sorry,
they should have explained this to you.

927
01:04:55,955 --> 01:04:57,286
I knew.

928
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:00,549
You did?

929
01:05:03,429 --> 01:05:05,590
I read between the lines.

930
01:05:15,975 --> 01:05:19,069
What you need to think about
is your code status.

931
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:22,477
What you want them to do...

932
01:05:23,149 --> 01:05:25,140
...if your heart stops beating.

933
01:05:27,553 --> 01:05:28,986
Well?

934
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:34,617
You can be full code
which means that if your heart stops...

935
01:05:34,693 --> 01:05:39,255
...we'll call a code blue and the code team
will come in and resuscitate you...

936
01:05:39,331 --> 01:05:42,562
...and take you to intensive care
until you stabilize.

937
01:05:42,935 --> 01:05:45,802
Or, you can be:

938
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:48,135
"Do not resuscitate. "

939
01:05:48,374 --> 01:05:50,774
Which means that if your heart stops...

940
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:54,703
...we'll just let it.

941
01:05:55,548 --> 01:05:57,482
You'll be DNR.

942
01:05:59,118 --> 01:06:02,315
Now, you can think about it. But I just...

943
01:06:02,822 --> 01:06:05,882
I just wanted to present you
with both choices...

944
01:06:06,225 --> 01:06:10,184
...before Kelekian and Jason
come in and talk to you.

945
01:06:13,732 --> 01:06:17,634
- They don't agree about this?
- They like to save lives.

946
01:06:18,471 --> 01:06:21,406
So anything's okay as long
as the life continues.

947
01:06:22,408 --> 01:06:26,037
Doesn't matter
if you're hooked up to a million machines.

948
01:06:27,379 --> 01:06:29,540
Kelekian's a great researcher, he is...

949
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:32,550
...and the Fellows like Jason,
they're really smart.

950
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:36,584
It's an honor for them
to be working with him.

951
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:41,785
But they always want to know
more things.

952
01:06:43,262 --> 01:06:45,355
I always want to know more things.

953
01:06:47,733 --> 01:06:49,394
I'm a scholar.

954
01:06:51,637 --> 01:06:53,161
Or I was...

955
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,203
...when I had shoes.

956
01:06:57,977 --> 01:06:59,808
When I had eyebrows.

957
01:07:02,348 --> 01:07:06,045
Okay, that's fine. You'll be full code.

958
01:07:10,055 --> 01:07:11,079
No.

959
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:14,016
Don't complicate the matter.

960
01:07:14,093 --> 01:07:16,459
No, really, it's fine. It's up to you.

961
01:07:19,899 --> 01:07:21,491
Just let it stop.

962
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:24,692
Really?

963
01:07:25,538 --> 01:07:26,562
Yes.

964
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,306
So, if your heart stops beating...

965
01:07:33,078 --> 01:07:35,444
Just let it stop.

966
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:40,307
You sure?

967
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:45,014
Yes.

968
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,154
Okay.

969
01:07:49,662 --> 01:07:53,029
Okay, I'll get Kelekian to give the order,
and then...

970
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:54,792
Susie?

971
01:07:59,471 --> 01:08:02,406
You're still going to take care of me,
aren't you?

972
01:08:03,075 --> 01:08:04,599
Of course I am.

973
01:08:05,344 --> 01:08:07,278
Don't you worry, sweetheart.

974
01:08:24,763 --> 01:08:25,752
Okay.

975
01:08:34,707 --> 01:08:35,833
Thank you.

976
01:09:05,738 --> 01:09:08,866
That certainly was a maudlin display.

977
01:09:10,275 --> 01:09:12,675
Popsicles, "Sweetheart. "

978
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:16,975
I can't believe my life
has become so corny.

979
01:09:19,652 --> 01:09:22,712
But it can't be helped,
I don't see any other way.

980
01:09:23,222 --> 01:09:26,783
We are discussing life and death, and...

981
01:09:27,726 --> 01:09:32,425
...not in the abstract, either.
We are discussing my life and my death.

982
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:37,431
And I can't conceive of any other tone.

983
01:09:40,572 --> 01:09:43,803
Now is not the time for verbal swordplay.

984
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:48,977
Nothing would be worse
than a detailed scholarly analysis and...

985
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:53,609
...erudition, interpretation, complication.

986
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,978
No.

987
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:59,623
Now is the time for simplicity.

988
01:10:00,926 --> 01:10:03,861
Now is the time for...

989
01:10:04,763 --> 01:10:06,458
...dare I say it...

990
01:10:07,766 --> 01:10:08,926
...kindness.

991
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,637
And I thought being extremely smart...

992
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:20,371
...would take care of it.

993
01:10:21,747 --> 01:10:25,080
But I see that I have been found out.

994
01:10:36,962 --> 01:10:38,327
I'm scared.

995
01:10:41,967 --> 01:10:42,956
Oh, God.

996
01:10:47,072 --> 01:10:48,232
I want...

997
01:10:49,174 --> 01:10:50,903
I want to...

998
01:10:55,848 --> 01:10:56,940
No.

999
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:02,348
I want to hide.
I just want to curl up in a little ball.

1000
01:11:36,221 --> 01:11:40,157
I want to tell you...

1001
01:11:40,459 --> 01:11:41,858
...how it feels.

1002
01:11:44,096 --> 01:11:47,224
I want to explain it.

1003
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:52,235
To use my words.

1004
01:11:53,872 --> 01:11:58,002
It's just as if I can't.

1005
01:12:01,814 --> 01:12:03,907
There aren't...

1006
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:13,324
I'm in terrible pain.

1007
01:12:15,494 --> 01:12:17,359
Susie says...

1008
01:12:23,535 --> 01:12:28,199
...I need to be
in aggressive pain management...

1009
01:12:29,308 --> 01:12:32,869
...if I'm going to stand it.

1010
01:12:35,113 --> 01:12:36,102
"Lt. "

1011
01:12:37,282 --> 01:12:39,750
Such a little word.

1012
01:12:43,088 --> 01:12:46,387
I think in this case...

1013
01:12:47,259 --> 01:12:49,227
..."it"...

1014
01:12:49,394 --> 01:12:54,058
...signifies being alive.

1015
01:12:58,804 --> 01:12:59,862
Okay.

1016
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:05,442
We've located Dr. Kelekian
and he's on his way here...

1017
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:07,535
...and we'll get you some meds.

1018
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:09,978
God, it's so painful.

1019
01:13:10,983 --> 01:13:12,280
So much pain.

1020
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:15,286
I know. Just try and relax
and clear your mind.

1021
01:13:15,387 --> 01:13:17,412
We'll get you patient-controlled analgesic.

1022
01:13:17,489 --> 01:13:20,219
It's a little pump
with a little button and you press it...

1023
01:13:20,325 --> 01:13:23,123
...and you decide how much
medication you want.

1024
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:25,720
It's very simple and it's all up to you.

1025
01:13:26,131 --> 01:13:27,223
Okay.

1026
01:13:28,734 --> 01:13:31,032
Dr. Bearing. Susie.

1027
01:13:31,169 --> 01:13:34,400
It's time for patient-controlled analgesic.
The pain's killing her.

1028
01:13:34,473 --> 01:13:36,836
Dr. Bearing, are you in pain?

1029
01:13:37,642 --> 01:13:40,008
I don't believe this.

1030
01:13:40,745 --> 01:13:42,076
Get a morphine drip.

1031
01:13:42,147 --> 01:13:44,775
What about patient-controlled?
She'd be more alert.

1032
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:46,943
Ordinarily yes. In her case, no.

1033
01:13:47,085 --> 01:13:50,111
- But I think she would really rather...
- She's earned a rest.

1034
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:54,718
Morphine. 10 push now
and start at 10 an hour.

1035
01:13:55,127 --> 01:13:57,925
Dr. Bearing, try to relax,
we'll help you through this.

1036
01:13:58,263 --> 01:13:59,696
Don't worry.

1037
01:14:02,968 --> 01:14:04,026
Excellent.

1038
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:55,211
Hi.

1039
01:14:56,755 --> 01:14:58,586
How are you feeling today?

1040
01:15:01,026 --> 01:15:04,462
These are my last coherent lines.

1041
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:07,857
I'll have to...

1042
01:15:09,234 --> 01:15:13,330
...leave the action to the professionals.

1043
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:20,268
It came so quickly, after taking so long.

1044
01:15:23,615 --> 01:15:27,551
There's not even time
for a proper conclusion.

1045
01:15:36,094 --> 01:15:39,530
I trust this will have a soporific effect?

1046
01:15:40,565 --> 01:15:44,092
I don't know about that,
but it sure does make you sleepy.

1047
01:15:50,442 --> 01:15:52,103
What's so funny?

1048
01:15:54,779 --> 01:15:56,007
What?

1049
01:16:01,086 --> 01:16:02,314
It's just...

1050
01:16:04,155 --> 01:16:07,056
It's that "soporific" means...

1051
01:16:07,626 --> 01:16:09,753
..."makes you sleepy. "

1052
01:16:11,162 --> 01:16:12,561
It does?

1053
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,497
That was sort of dumb.

1054
01:16:17,736 --> 01:16:20,500
No, it was funny.

1055
01:16:22,173 --> 01:16:25,700
Yeah? In a dumb sort of way.

1056
01:16:34,152 --> 01:16:37,417
I'm glad you explained it to me.

1057
01:16:38,823 --> 01:16:41,121
I never would've thought of that.

1058
01:16:44,129 --> 01:16:46,290
I'm a teacher.

1059
01:17:33,545 --> 01:17:38,107
Yeah, she was a great scholar.
Wrote tons of books, articles.

1060
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,445
She was the head of everything.

1061
01:17:41,286 --> 01:17:44,585
People used to hug the walls
when she passed.

1062
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:53,856
275, 520. Let's up the hydration.

1063
01:17:53,932 --> 01:17:57,527
She won't be drinking anymore,
see if we can keep her kidneys from fading.

1064
01:17:57,602 --> 01:17:59,365
I had a lot of respect for her.

1065
01:17:59,437 --> 01:18:02,167
More than I can say
for the entire bio-chem department.

1066
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,936
- What do you want, dextrose?
- Give her saline.

1067
01:18:06,144 --> 01:18:10,103
She gave a hell of a lecture.
No notes, not a word out of place.

1068
01:18:10,181 --> 01:18:12,672
It was impressive.
A lot of students hated her, though.

1069
01:18:12,751 --> 01:18:15,652
- Why?
- She wasn't exactly a cupcake.

1070
01:18:15,754 --> 01:18:18,279
She hasn't exactly been
a cupcake here either.

1071
01:18:18,356 --> 01:18:22,622
Miss Bearing, Jason and I are here,
we'll insert a catheter to collect urine.

1072
01:18:22,694 --> 01:18:25,356
- It won't hurt, so don't worry.
- Like she can hear you.

1073
01:18:25,597 --> 01:18:29,533
- It's just nice to do.
- Eight cycles of Hex and Vin at full dose.

1074
01:18:29,601 --> 01:18:31,762
Kelekian didn't think it was possible.

1075
01:18:31,836 --> 01:18:34,703
I wish they'd all go full throttle,
then we'd have some data.

1076
01:18:34,839 --> 01:18:36,431
She's not what I imagined.

1077
01:18:36,641 --> 01:18:39,405
I thought someone who studied poetry
would be more dreamy.

1078
01:18:39,477 --> 01:18:41,001
Not the way she did it.

1079
01:18:41,079 --> 01:18:43,274
Her course was more like
boot camp than English.

1080
01:18:43,348 --> 01:18:45,509
John Donne was incredibly intense.

1081
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:48,484
Your whole brain
had to be in knots before you could get it.

1082
01:18:48,553 --> 01:18:51,545
- He made it hard on purpose?
- It has to do with subject matter.

1083
01:18:51,623 --> 01:18:55,150
The "Holy Sonnets" we worked on mostly
were mainly about salvation anxiety.

1084
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:57,353
That's a term I made up
in one of my papers...

1085
01:18:57,429 --> 01:18:59,056
...but I think it fits pretty well.

1086
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:01,662
He's this brilliant guy, I mean brilliant.

1087
01:19:01,733 --> 01:19:04,031
He makes Shakespeare
sound like a Hallmark card.

1088
01:19:04,335 --> 01:19:05,927
And you know you're a sinner.

1089
01:19:06,004 --> 01:19:08,837
There's a promise of salvation,
the whole religious thing.

1090
01:19:08,907 --> 01:19:10,101
But you can't deal with it.

1091
01:19:10,175 --> 01:19:12,837
- How come?
- Because it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

1092
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:16,574
But you can't face life without it,
so you write these screwed-up sonnets.

1093
01:19:16,648 --> 01:19:19,139
Like a game to make
the puzzle so complicated.

1094
01:19:19,451 --> 01:19:20,918
What happens in the end?

1095
01:19:20,985 --> 01:19:23,852
The end of what?
- To John Donne. Does he ever get it?

1096
01:19:24,122 --> 01:19:26,113
- Get what?
- His salvation anxiety.

1097
01:19:26,191 --> 01:19:28,284
- Does he ever understand?
- No way.

1098
01:19:29,093 --> 01:19:32,494
The puzzle takes over.
You're not even trying to solve it anymore.

1099
01:19:32,931 --> 01:19:36,367
Fascinating, really.
Great training for lab research.

1100
01:19:36,434 --> 01:19:38,698
Looking at increasing levels of complexity.

1101
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:40,863
- Until what?
- What do you mean?

1102
01:19:40,939 --> 01:19:43,032
Do you ever get to solve the puzzle?

1103
01:19:43,107 --> 01:19:46,838
No. When it comes down to it,
research is just trying to quantify...

1104
01:19:46,911 --> 01:19:48,742
...the complications of the puzzle.

1105
01:19:48,813 --> 01:19:53,984
- You help people, you save lives and stuff.
- Sure, I save a guy's life...

1106
01:19:54,117 --> 01:19:56,608
...and the poor slob goes out
and gets hit by a bus.

1107
01:19:56,686 --> 01:19:59,382
Yeah, I guess so.
I just don't think about it that way.

1108
01:19:59,622 --> 01:20:02,318
I guess you can tell
I never took a course in poetry.

1109
01:20:02,859 --> 01:20:06,124
If there's one thing
we learned in 17th Century Poetry...

1110
01:20:06,196 --> 01:20:08,994
...you can forget all about
that sentimental stuff.

1111
01:20:09,065 --> 01:20:11,761
Enzyme kinetics was more poetic
than Bearing's class.

1112
01:20:11,835 --> 01:20:13,962
Besides, you can't just go around...

1113
01:20:14,037 --> 01:20:17,632
...thinking about that meaning-of-life stuff
all the time. You'd go nuts.

1114
01:20:18,008 --> 01:20:20,806
- Do you believe in it?
- Believe in what?

1115
01:20:20,877 --> 01:20:23,573
I don't know, the meaning-of-life stuff.

1116
01:20:25,015 --> 01:20:27,745
What do they teach you at nursing school?

1117
01:20:33,556 --> 01:20:36,491
She's out of it. Shouldn't be too long.

1118
01:20:39,896 --> 01:20:43,593
- You done here?
- Yeah, I'll just tidy up.

1119
01:20:50,874 --> 01:20:53,035
- See ya.
- Bye.

1120
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,799
It's Eve.

1121
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:10,337
Oh, God.

1122
01:23:15,552 --> 01:23:17,543
Prof. Ashford?

1123
01:23:18,788 --> 01:23:19,948
Oh, God.

1124
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:25,655
I'm in town visiting my great-grandson...

1125
01:23:26,763 --> 01:23:29,823
...who is celebrating his fifth birthday.

1126
01:23:31,401 --> 01:23:33,733
I went to see you in your office...

1127
01:23:34,404 --> 01:23:36,668
...and they directed me here.

1128
01:23:40,577 --> 01:23:42,909
I've been walking all over town.

1129
01:23:44,013 --> 01:23:47,380
I'd forgotten how early it gets chilly here.

1130
01:23:52,155 --> 01:23:54,419
I feel so bad.

1131
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,724
Yes, I know you do.

1132
01:24:00,163 --> 01:24:01,630
I can see.

1133
01:24:05,735 --> 01:24:06,827
Oh, dear.

1134
01:24:08,137 --> 01:24:10,162
There, there.

1135
01:24:11,274 --> 01:24:13,071
There, there.

1136
01:25:00,757 --> 01:25:02,281
There, there, Vivian.

1137
01:25:08,264 --> 01:25:10,323
It's a windy day.

1138
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:16,195
Don't worry, dear.

1139
01:25:19,876 --> 01:25:21,275
Let's see.

1140
01:25:21,377 --> 01:25:24,540
Shall I recite something to you?
Would you like that?

1141
01:25:25,882 --> 01:25:28,248
I'll recite something by Donne.

1142
01:25:28,651 --> 01:25:29,913
No.

1143
01:25:33,456 --> 01:25:34,548
Very well.

1144
01:25:45,968 --> 01:25:47,560
Let's see...

1145
01:25:54,344 --> 01:25:58,542
<i>"The Runaway Bunny,
by Margaret Wise Brown.</i>

1146
01:25:59,082 --> 01:26:01,579
"Pictures by Clement Hurd.

1147
01:26:01,651 --> 01:26:04,449
"Copyright, 1942.

1148
01:26:05,455 --> 01:26:10,483
"First Harper Trophy edition, 1972.

1149
01:26:15,098 --> 01:26:18,534
"Once there was a little bunny
who wanted to run away...

1150
01:26:18,601 --> 01:26:21,695
"... so he said to his mother,
'I'm running away. '

1151
01:26:22,906 --> 01:26:25,466
"'Lf you run away,' said his mother...

1152
01:26:25,542 --> 01:26:27,737
"'... I will run after you.

1153
01:26:27,844 --> 01:26:31,041
"'For you are my little bunny. '

1154
01:26:33,049 --> 01:26:35,916
"'Lf you run after me,'
said the little bunny...

1155
01:26:36,252 --> 01:26:39,415
"... I will become a fish in a trout stream...

1156
01:26:39,489 --> 01:26:42,322
"'... and I will swim away from you. '

1157
01:26:42,392 --> 01:26:46,123
"'Lf you become a fish in a trout stream,'
said his mother...

1158
01:26:46,496 --> 01:26:50,455
"'... I will become a fisherman,
and I will fish for you. "'

1159
01:26:51,701 --> 01:26:53,066
Look at that.

1160
01:26:53,436 --> 01:26:56,200
A little allegory of the soul.

1161
01:26:56,906 --> 01:26:59,739
Wherever it hides, God will find it.

1162
01:27:01,578 --> 01:27:03,068
See, Vivian?

1163
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:10,047
"'Lf you become a fisherman,'
said the little bunny...

1164
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:13,283
"'I will be a bird and fly away"

1165
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:18,422
"'Lf you become a bird
and fly away from me,' said his mother...

1166
01:27:18,595 --> 01:27:22,588
"'... I will be a tree
that you come home to. "'

1167
01:27:24,634 --> 01:27:26,261
Very clever.

1168
01:27:31,074 --> 01:27:33,702
"'Shucks,' said the little bunny.

1169
01:27:34,177 --> 01:27:37,442
"'I might just as well stay where I am...

1170
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:40,572
"'... and be your little bunny. '

1171
01:27:40,717 --> 01:27:42,548
"And so he did.

1172
01:27:44,287 --> 01:27:47,154
"'Have a carrot,' said the mother bunny. "

1173
01:27:52,061 --> 01:27:53,460
Wonderful.

1174
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:01,567
Time to go.

1175
01:28:34,904 --> 01:28:38,863
"And flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest. "

1176
01:29:51,648 --> 01:29:54,310
Prof. Bearing, how you feeling today?

1177
01:29:56,085 --> 01:29:58,781
3:00 p. m., IV hydration totals:

1178
01:29:59,689 --> 01:30:03,648
2,000 in, 30 out. That's it...

1179
01:30:03,726 --> 01:30:05,455
...kidneys gone.

1180
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:11,223
"Highly unresponsive. "

1181
01:30:19,542 --> 01:30:21,009
Wait a second.

1182
01:30:25,715 --> 01:30:27,205
Four-five-seven-five.

1183
01:30:29,719 --> 01:30:32,586
Code blue, room 707.

1184
01:30:32,655 --> 01:30:35,021
Dr. Posner, P-o-s-n-e-r. Hurry up.

1185
01:31:02,518 --> 01:31:06,477
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

1186
01:31:06,556 --> 01:31:09,116
...ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen.

1187
01:31:10,326 --> 01:31:11,918
- What are you doing?
- Goddamn code...

1188
01:31:11,995 --> 01:31:13,724
- She's DNR!
- She's research!

1189
01:31:13,796 --> 01:31:15,024
She's no code!

1190
01:31:15,431 --> 01:31:16,898
She's no code!

1191
01:31:16,966 --> 01:31:20,367
Kelekian gave the order
and you were there, you saw it yourself!

1192
01:31:20,737 --> 01:31:22,102
God, the code.

1193
01:31:24,173 --> 01:31:26,073
Cancel code, Room 707.

1194
01:31:26,142 --> 01:31:27,609
Sue Monahan, primary nurse.

1195
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:29,639
I got it.

1196
01:31:29,812 --> 01:31:32,781
No, the patient is no code. She's DNR!

1197
01:31:32,915 --> 01:31:35,611
- The patient is DNR!
- Clear!

1198
01:31:35,985 --> 01:31:38,453
Listen, she's "do not resuscitate"!

1199
01:31:38,521 --> 01:31:41,217
The patient is no code!

1200
01:31:41,724 --> 01:31:44,750
The patient is no code,
the order was given.

1201
01:31:44,827 --> 01:31:45,794
Stop it!

1202
01:31:49,699 --> 01:31:50,893
Do not resuscitate!

1203
01:31:54,504 --> 01:31:55,971
Move out of the way, go!

1204
01:31:57,573 --> 01:31:58,835
Clear.

1205
01:31:58,908 --> 01:32:03,208
- I made a mistake!
- The patient is no code!

1206
01:32:04,247 --> 01:32:07,011
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Sue Monahan, the primary nurse.

1207
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:09,051
Let me see the goddamn chart.

1208
01:32:11,187 --> 01:32:13,553
The patient is no code.
Just get away from her.

1209
01:32:13,623 --> 01:32:15,591
"Do not resuscitate. Kelekian. "

1210
01:32:16,025 --> 01:32:17,788
The order was put in yesterday.

1211
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:20,590
- It's a doctor screw-up.
- What is he, a resident?

1212
01:32:20,663 --> 01:32:22,426
Got us up here on a DNR.

1213
01:32:24,267 --> 01:32:26,667
Called a code on a no-code.

1214
01:33:11,748 --> 01:33:13,579
<i>"Death</i>

1215
01:33:13,683 --> 01:33:15,275
<i>"Be not proud</i>

01:33:16,552 --> 01:33:20,579
<i>"Though some have called thee
