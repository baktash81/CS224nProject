1
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:40,183
And this display is all that's left
of CONTROL, a secret spy agency...

2
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:44,052
...which once battled against
the criminal syndicate known as KAOS.

3
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:46,955
CONTROL was disbanded
at the end of the Cold War.

4
00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:50,387
Okay, up next, an exhibit...

5
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:01,097
Judy, the elevator is still doing that thing
where it drops really fast.

6
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:02,930
Are you sure Maintenance fixed that?

7
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:04,435
Let me check.

8
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:06,369
Yep, they fixed it.

9
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:09,606
See you later.

10
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,443
- Hey, Max.
Agent 50.

11
00:04:15,984 --> 00:04:18,077
16 floors down,
how'd a fly even get in here?

12
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:19,618
- Hey, Max.
- Max!

13
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,119
Hey, Larabee, 91.

14
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,850
Yeah, big day. Could be
your last chance to push a pencil.

15
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:26,857
Field-agent test results are due.

16
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:31,124
Oh. Is that today?
I wasn't really thinking about it.

17
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:33,733
Can you imagine Max as an agent?
Little suit, little shoes.

18
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:36,692
Uh-oh. Two-nerd pile-up.

19
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,168
- Move!
- Ow!

20
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:43,105
Pretty boys. Nothing but empty suits.

21
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:46,304
- Good morning, Bruce, Lloyd.
- Why would you wanna be an agent?

22
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:50,247
I mean, lab guys like us, analysts like you,
we're the real soldiers.

23
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:52,784
We're the true guardians
of freedom and democracy.

24
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:55,422
And I hear we're getting
a new cappuccino machine.

25
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,023
No, that's only for agents.

26
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,751
Oh.

27
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:13,566
Hey, Agent 23 is back.

28
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:24,682
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

29
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:27,286
- Welcome back, 23.
- Maxie.

30
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,320
So how was the assassination?

31
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:32,289
Maxie, you know assassinations
are specifically prohibited...

32
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,325
...by executive order 12333.

33
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,464
23, you kill me.

34
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:41,864
- I could if I wanted to.
- Yes, you... Oh. Oh!

35
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:44,561
Did you see that face he made? Scary.

36
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:50,908
Six months' work. 18 million dollars.

37
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,214
Fricking agents, man.

38
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:55,713
Come on, let's see it.

39
00:05:55,884 --> 00:06:00,685
A lot of chatter in this region
involves nuclear material.

40
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:04,382
You may remember
from page 627 of my last report...

41
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:07,357
...that there has been an uptick
in KAOS interest in nukes.

42
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:12,430
To wit, I offer
the following conversation.

43
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,761
What are you doing? Are you texting?

44
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:18,167
Yeah, letting my fiancee know
we won't be able to get married in June.

45
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,897
I'll still be in this meeting.

46
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:22,434
Can I see that a second?
- Yeah.

47
00:06:22,844 --> 00:06:23,868
That's great.

48
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:27,272
That's weird. You lost your signal.

49
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:29,416
Sorry to interrupt, Maxie, go ahead.

50
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:32,181
Next time use your own damn phone.

51
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:35,614
Good morning, men. No, offense, Karen.

52
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,052
Snappy tie.

53
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:40,023
Sorry I'm late, but I just came out
of a budget meeting...

54
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:44,188
...with our incredibly abrasive, dismissive
and sarcastic vice president.

55
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:45,525
It's no problem.

56
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,694
I have obtained a snippet,
at great risk to a busboy in Balahd.

57
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:56,705
"Aftab, how is your coffee?"

58
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:00,546
"Good, Dalip, it's decaf.

59
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:02,679
How is yours?"

60
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:05,978
"It is good also.

61
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:08,686
How is your muffin?"

62
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:11,590
Powerful stuff.

63
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:14,427
So "muffin," then, is a code word?

64
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:16,257
No, it is comfort food...

65
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:19,298
...and quite frankly, more
fattening than most people realize.

66
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:20,866
Which begs the question...

67
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:25,199
...why would two
hardened KAOS agents...

68
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:28,171
...risk the carbs?

69
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:31,668
Because they are under
a great deal of stress.

70
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:33,507
- Hence the decaf.
- For Aftab, yes.

71
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:36,047
Dalip takes his full-strength. Why?

72
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:39,015
Because he has been sleeping
on the couch for three days...

73
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:42,457
...because he called his sister-in-law
a "leathery hag. "

74
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:45,482
People often say things
in anger they don't really mean.

75
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,653
Leathery hag, fat cow, ungrateful whore.

76
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:54,700
Just words, really, that shouldn't
be used against you in a custody hearing.

77
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:58,434
Let it go, man. Those kids
don't even look like you.

78
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,533
Can we put a pin in this, please...

79
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,472
...and go back to Max's
extraordinarily detailed report?

80
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:05,408
Thank you, Chief. All I'm saying is...

81
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,447
...that until we understand
that our enemies are also human...

82
00:08:08,616 --> 00:08:10,277
...we will never defeat them.

83
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:16,117
Yes, they are bad guys, but that
is what they do, not who they are.

84
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:18,187
Let's continue listening...

85
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:22,227
...and bear in mind that the next 100 pages
can get a little bit dry.

86
00:08:22,397 --> 00:08:24,194
Come on...

87
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:38,769
Easy, Durat! This stuff is radioactive.

88
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:40,914
One slip-up, and it's "ka-fricking-boom!"

89
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:42,242
Shtarker.

90
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:47,486
This is KAOS.
We don't "ka-fricking-boom" here.

91
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:49,616
Sorry, Mr. Siegfried.

92
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,227
Get it in the truck,
and let's burn this place to the ground.

93
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:55,885
But if we have what we want,
why burn the building?

94
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,535
Any more questions?

95
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,756
Missed me!

96
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:36,195
All right! All right! I'm out!

97
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:38,362
He was lying, Max. It was a good shot.

98
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:39,836
Thanks.

99
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:42,703
I am so sick of training.
I wanna get out in the field.

100
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:46,643
Give it up, 23! It's just you
and Maxi-pad against the six of us.

101
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:50,045
Oh, gee, Maxi-pad,
I've never heard that one before!

102
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:52,453
I never have actually heard that before.

103
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:00,688
23, you're bleeding.

104
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:04,757
It's a knife wound from the last mission.
My blood gets pumping, it seeps.

105
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:06,297
Hey, Maxine!

106
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,197
Come over here
and we'll play a game I like to call:

107
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,235
"Let's Go to the Dog Show. "

108
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:13,533
I put a collar on you
and make you my bi...!

109
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:20,581
I think I really got inside his head.

110
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:22,413
I am not proud of what I just did.

111
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,210
Game over, Chatty Cathy.

112
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:32,224
Game over when I say it's over.

113
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,183
- Okay.
- Wet willy.

114
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:37,692
Okay. Who wants lunch?

115
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:41,232
Well, excellent work, 23,
but I could've handled it my...

116
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:47,774
- Max, the Chief wants to see you.
- It is nice to see you too!

117
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:56,581
You wanted to see me, Chief?

118
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:59,219
Yes, Max, yes, please, sit down.

119
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:02,914
Your field-agent test results
just came in and...

120
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:06,987
- Something wrong with your ear?
- Absolutely not.

121
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:09,595
Would you like me
to wait while you answer that?

122
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:10,856
Answer what?

123
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:12,966
Nothing. You were saying?

124
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:15,534
I was saying the results
are quite extraordinary.

125
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:18,695
In fact, your essay on existentialism
was quite amazing.

126
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:20,397
I left that section blank.

127
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:22,372
Blank? Brilliant.

128
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:24,033
Brilliant, Max.

129
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:26,874
- You passed with flying colors.
- Yes!

130
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:29,539
You know what, sir?
I can't say that I am shocked.

131
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:32,447
I felt good about this year's test,
in light of the fact...

132
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,316
...that in previous years,
my fitness has been an issue.

133
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,854
Personal best.

134
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:46,932
But not anymore. I'm ready for duty.

135
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:49,228
I know how hard
you've prepared for this...

136
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:51,200
...and how much this means to you...

137
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,533
...but I'm afraid I can't promote you.

138
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:57,235
- What?
- I can't afford to give up my best analyst.

139
00:11:57,411 --> 00:12:00,608
I mean, the amount of chatter
you get through, and the reports...

140
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:02,908
...I mean, they go way beyond
the raw data.

141
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:09,682
So to be clear, you're not promoting me,
because I do such a great job.

142
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:13,961
Max, the way you and I work
is becoming a lost art form.

143
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:16,926
I spend half my days
trying to convince the vice president...

144
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:19,896
...that intelligence comes
from humans and not satellites.

145
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:23,503
Men with hunches,
that's where the real work gets done.

146
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:25,605
I'm very proud of you, Max...

147
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,301
...very proud of you...

148
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:30,341
...but I need you where you are.

149
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:56,633
<i>I am sorry, but we can never be.</i>

150
00:12:56,804 --> 00:13:00,831
Despite today's setback,
I will at some point become a field agent...

151
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:02,270
...and when that happens...

152
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:05,708
...one phone call could take me
to the other side of the world.

153
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:10,148
Who am I kidding? I'm a middle-aged
man who's missed the train.

154
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:14,447
You don't deserve this.
I don't deserve you.

155
00:13:14,622 --> 00:13:17,090
You're so young and so full of life.

156
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,285
Don't do it, Fang.

157
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,458
Don't love me.

158
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:25,262
Here.

159
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,401
- Oh, great.
- Sorry.

160
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:30,036
That was my last mile.
I have no idea how fast it was.

161
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:32,536
You were moving.
It's not easy to knock me down.

162
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,937
I have a low center of gravity.
Pretty solid.

163
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:37,441
I'm just gonna call that one a 4:50.

164
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:41,605
Impressive. I once ran a 5:16.

165
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:44,649
Oh, really? That's, uh, slower.

166
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:46,309
Not everything's a competition.

167
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:48,316
Well, if it were, I'd win.

168
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:50,684
Ah. Are you flirting with me?

169
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,852
Not at all. Are you flirting with me?

170
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:55,791
That depends. Is it working?

171
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,161
Not at all.

172
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,800
Well, nice meeting you!
I admire your focus!

173
00:14:04,405 --> 00:14:05,997
Am I invisible?

174
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:44,674
Bruce, Lloyd, what happened?

175
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:47,370
And what is that ungodly smell?

176
00:14:47,748 --> 00:14:49,045
Fear.

177
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:52,082
I'll be back.

178
00:14:58,225 --> 00:14:59,317
Freeze.

179
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:00,790
Freeze.

180
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:02,953
- No, you freeze.
- You freeze.

181
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,257
- I told you to freeze.
- Freeze times infinity.

182
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:06,730
Oh, my God.

183
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:08,934
- You.
- You.

184
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:10,900
- Are you CONTROL?
- I'm Maxwell Smart.

185
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:13,040
I am a CONTROL analyst. Who are you?

186
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:16,367
I'm Agent 99.

187
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:19,741
Oh, my word. You are Agent 99?

188
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:22,644
- I am a huge fan!
- Thank you.

189
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:34,923
What are you doing?

190
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:37,119
I'm right here, just talk to me!

191
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:39,732
I'm going to cause a diversion.
You run and get help.

192
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,868
- I really don't think that that's a...
- Shh.

193
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:43,970
- Did you just...?
- Shh!

194
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:03,350
Go, go, go!

195
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:04,882
Wait!

196
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:08,693
Somebody shut it off!

197
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,434
Good, 23, just in time.
I think I got one of them.

198
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:23,067
Is that the Chief?

199
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:26,139
Yes, it is.

200
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:27,541
Sorry about that, Chief.

201
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:30,140
Is that a dent in his head?

202
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:48,729
Hi. Hi.

203
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:51,736
Agent 13, you are in a tree.

204
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:55,171
Yeah, communications got knocked down,
so they put me in a tree.

205
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:57,333
- Old-school stuff.
- Glad to see you're okay.

206
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:58,535
Yeah, yeah.

207
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,412
Well, I have to get going.
Would you raise up the walkway, please?

208
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,881
You don't have to get going.
You don't have to go.

209
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:06,246
Yeah, I've got a meeting.

210
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,012
- How you been?
- I've been well.

211
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:10,919
- Everything good?
- It's great. Well, I gotta...

212
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:12,683
Could you come back this way?

213
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:15,555
Yeah, yeah, I think I will.

214
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:17,227
What time?

215
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:20,223
Well... Mm.

216
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:22,363
I get it.

217
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,461
Who wants to talk to a guy in a tree?

218
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:26,936
I get it.

219
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:30,840
Hang in there.
Don't cry, don't... Please don't cry.

220
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,959
Okay. Let's get started.

221
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:56,796
You'll have to bear with me,
I'm still a little fuzzy.

222
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:59,439
I got a pretty good
hit in the head yesterday.

223
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:03,600
Yes, it was dark in there.
You probably tripped.

224
00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:06,837
I hurt my knee. It was smoky too.

225
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:10,341
All right, here's what we know.

226
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:13,315
Wait. Chief, I request
the cone of silence.

227
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:17,218
Max, not the cone of silence.
We're in a safe room, for God's sakes.

228
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:18,983
We thought CONTROL was safe.

229
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,091
Okay. Lloyd.

230
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:28,866
Okay, we have reason to believe
that our security was breached by KAOS.

231
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:31,300
- You have to speak up.
Can you hear me?

232
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:33,303
- I'm not hearing anyone.
- What?

233
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,408
Can you hear me?
What did you say?

234
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:38,136
- Bruce, it's not working.
- It's not working!

235
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:42,211
Chief! I hit you in the head
with a fire extinguisher!

236
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:44,351
No, no, no, we're not ready yet.

237
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:46,452
Okay. All right.

238
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,884
- It doesn't work, get rid of it.
- Turn it off.

239
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:51,650
This thing is no good.
It's a useless piece of garbage.

240
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,986
- Turn it off!
- Larabee, you all right?

241
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:56,095
Larabee wants out!

242
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:03,632
Today's the day, and we're gonna
get rid of this damn thing.

243
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:06,398
That is cold. That's cold.
All right, easy.

244
00:19:06,573 --> 00:19:08,200
All right, are we done?

245
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,740
Yep. I can hear now.

246
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,004
Sorry, Chief, someone led me to believe
the cone was ready.

247
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,876
For the record, I never actually
used the word "ready. "

248
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,610
"I'll show them the cone.
The cone's the shizzle. "

249
00:19:18,786 --> 00:19:20,185
- You said that to me.
- All right, shut up.

250
00:19:20,888 --> 00:19:21,912
Listen up, people.

251
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:24,421
There's been a rash of thefts
of nuclear material...

252
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:27,025
...especially yellowcake,
over the last three months.

253
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:31,824
Now, based on Max's intel, we were
able to get Agent 38 inside KAOS.

254
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:34,194
We must've been close
to uncovering something...

255
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:36,199
...so KAOS hit us and they hit us hard.

256
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,138
They hacked our system...

257
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:41,039
...and learned the identities
of all our field agents.

258
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,267
Around the world
our people are under attack.

259
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:54,348
Our only lead is the maker of the bomb
KAOS used against us.

260
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:56,045
Vladimir Krs...

261
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:58,157
- It's pronounced "Krstic," sir.
- Yes...

262
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:00,891
Krstic.

263
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:06,730
Yes. He is a Bosnian national, and one
of KAOS' favorite munitions suppliers.

264
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,698
Unfortunately, we have no idea
where he is.

265
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,997
Actually, sir, we do. He is in Russia.

266
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:15,198
- How do you know that?
- It was on page 482 of my report.

267
00:20:17,544 --> 00:20:19,171
Doesn't anybody read my reports?

268
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:23,872
All right, our mission is clear, people.
Find Krs...

269
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:25,643
- Krstic.
- Yes. Find him!

270
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:27,810
- Kris Kringle. Fish stick.
Yes, Krs...

271
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:29,580
- Okay, I got it, I got it.
Krstic.

272
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:33,352
Use him to get to KAOS,
then recover the stolen nuclear material...

273
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:35,961
...before they can do something
less than friendly...

274
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,089
...and maybe, if we're lucky,
we can apprehend the man behind it all...

275
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:41,359
...Siegfried.

276
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:44,436
Pictured here with his
number two man, Shtarker.

277
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:47,438
How are we gonna do that
when our agents are compromised?

278
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:50,475
Put me out there, Chief.
I'm not afraid to expose myself.

279
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:52,703
Do you ever think before you speak?

280
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
No, I just whip it out there.
It's what's best.

281
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:57,110
Fortunately, we have other options.

282
00:20:57,284 --> 00:21:02,051
99 recently underwent massive plastic
surgery, so her new face is not known yet.

283
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:05,157
We also have a new agent, Agent 86.

284
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:06,587
Who's that, sir?

285
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,387
It's you, Max.

286
00:21:10,197 --> 00:21:11,824
All right, Maxie.

287
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,124
You did it.

288
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,833
Lloyd, may I have the C.O.S. Please?

289
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:23,837
I'm so happy!

290
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:28,107
I'm so happy!
This is the best day of my life!

291
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,786
Max, you didn't push
the button hard enough.

292
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:36,445
- So you could hear me?
Yes.

293
00:21:37,257 --> 00:21:39,623
- Right.
Excuse me, Chief, just a thought.

294
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:43,729
- I'm not questioning your judgment...
99, I insist on complete honesty.

295
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:46,923
If you have something to say to me,
I wish you would just say it.

296
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:49,433
Max has no experience.
I don't want him as my partner.

297
00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:53,004
Well, that is a sucker punch
to the gonads.

298
00:21:55,509 --> 00:21:59,445
Hey, Max. We got you a lovely
parting gift for your first mission.

299
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:01,877
Oh, a pocketknife.

300
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:04,381
Not just a pocketknife, Swiss Army knife.

301
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:07,042
Comes with tweezers, pliers,
a tiny magnifying glass.

302
00:22:07,221 --> 00:22:10,384
Fish scaler, a saw, a flamethrower,
chisel, a wire-crimping tool.

303
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:12,422
- What was that thing you said?
- Chisel?

304
00:22:12,593 --> 00:22:14,356
Before that.
Did you say flamethrower?

305
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,859
- Yeah.
- Check it.

306
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:20,660
We also added a crossbow
that fires harpoons...

307
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:24,565
...connected to spider-silk nano-thread.
Has the strength of steel cable.

308
00:22:24,738 --> 00:22:27,229
It's a time-consuming,
labor-intensive technology.

309
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:29,534
The spiders
have to be individually milked.

310
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,678
And they do not like it.

311
00:22:31,845 --> 00:22:33,176
<i>No, they don't.</i>

312
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:35,315
Gentlemen, you're the best.

313
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:36,840
Thanks.

314
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:56,301
Ladies and gentlemen,
while you are in your seats...

315
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,665
...please keep your seatbelts fastened.

316
00:22:59,573 --> 00:23:02,167
I feel really good about us as partners.

317
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:04,037
23 says that's important.

318
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:07,406
"Trust is a must. " That's what 23 says.

319
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:08,605
Does he?

320
00:23:08,782 --> 00:23:11,774
You and I share a bond, I think.

321
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:16,116
We both know what it feels like to look
in the mirror and not like what we see.

322
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,088
You with the surgery,
me with the weight loss.

323
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,350
I wanna show you something.

324
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:26,624
That was me.

325
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,700
Wow, impressive.

326
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:30,530
Congratulations.

327
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:32,194
Thank you.

328
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:37,743
This is me.

329
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:40,308
Wow.

330
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,380
Very impressive, 99.

331
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,643
You were truly hideous back then.

332
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:50,747
Since we are going
to be portraying husband and wife...

333
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:53,290
...maybe we should get our story set.

334
00:23:53,627 --> 00:23:55,117
Okay, good idea.

335
00:23:56,997 --> 00:24:01,491
We met at a marketing convention in Vegas.
Married a year later. No kids.

336
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:03,568
I like your parents, but you hate mine.

337
00:24:03,737 --> 00:24:05,102
Do we want kids?

338
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:08,139
Well, you do,
but I'm concentrating on my career.

339
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:11,072
I don't know if that's fair.
I mean, I'm older than you are.

340
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:14,271
- Well, not by much.
- Really?

341
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:19,182
When they gave me a new face,
I had them...

342
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,113
...take a couple years off.

343
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:23,779
You know, why not?

344
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:29,324
Well, if that's the case, then you are
at an advanced age, and you should be...

345
00:24:29,496 --> 00:24:31,293
Well, no. I was never...

346
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:35,663
I'm just saying that your eggs could dry up
and fall out of your uterus.

347
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:38,202
So time is of the essence.

348
00:24:39,306 --> 00:24:42,275
- That's your opinion.
- No, that is a medical fact.

349
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:45,138
There is a lot of time
for me to make this decision.

350
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,712
I will not be rushed into it
by you or my mother.

351
00:24:47,881 --> 00:24:50,315
- You don't have much time.
- Where is the drink cart?

352
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:56,011
Uh-oh.

353
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:57,952
- What?
- Six o'clock.

354
00:24:58,825 --> 00:25:02,420
Don't turn around, don't turn around.
Use your peripherals.

355
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:08,198
Do you see him?

356
00:25:08,468 --> 00:25:11,733
I'm just widening my eyes.
I'm not actually seeing anything more.

357
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:14,339
The big guy that might as well
be holding up a sign:

358
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:16,305
"I'm an assassin, here to kill you. "

359
00:25:16,476 --> 00:25:18,876
Okay, 99, you know what?
That is profiling.

360
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:23,676
Just because he is large doesn't
necessarily mean that he is a bad guy.

361
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:28,145
Oh. Wow.

362
00:25:28,322 --> 00:25:31,416
That's a bad guy.
That's a really bad guy.

363
00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:33,354
- You don't say.
- Did you see his face?

364
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:34,551
Yes.

365
00:25:34,728 --> 00:25:38,095
His head looks like
one of the Easter Island heads.

366
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:42,325
You know what?
I'm doing the same thing.

367
00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:45,369
That's profiling,
and I will have none of it.

368
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:49,373
Darn it, I have gum on my new shoes.

369
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,713
- He's trying to light his shoe.
It's a shoe bomb!

370
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,145
- Get him!
- It's gum.

371
00:25:58,318 --> 00:26:01,810
- He's got a gun!
- Not... Gum! Not... No! Gum!

372
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:06,583
Gum!

373
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,785
Federal marshal, you're under arrest.

374
00:26:08,962 --> 00:26:12,363
Sir, I believe you just shattered
my coccyx.

375
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:16,397
<i>Folks, we may
be experiencing a little turbulence.</i>

376
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,130
<i>The "fasten seatbelt" sign
has been turned on.</i>

377
00:26:20,974 --> 00:26:23,738
Well, you were no help whatsoever.

378
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,607
How could I help?
I'm just a woman with a dusty old uterus.

379
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:30,079
I never said dusty.

380
00:26:30,717 --> 00:26:32,776
We're close to the drop site.
I'll go first.

381
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:35,979
- Gonna be all right with your cuffs?
- No cuffs can contain me.

382
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,782
Excuse me, violent sky marshal.

383
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:41,955
What do you want?

384
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:43,596
I have to squeeze the lemon.

385
00:26:43,764 --> 00:26:45,254
Ugh.

386
00:26:45,732 --> 00:26:47,131
You heard me.

387
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,495
Squeeze the lemon.

388
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:06,017
- Do you work out?
- Occasionally.

389
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:08,347
Yeah, I'm big on protein. Protein's great.

390
00:27:21,468 --> 00:27:24,335
I gotta get it out. I gotta get that out!

391
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:29,207
That's in there, that's in there.

392
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:39,645
No time for pain.

393
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,515
Over the drop zone.

394
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:49,558
Ball sack!

395
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,666
Son of a hamster.

396
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,071
You all right in there?
- Yeah. Yes, I am.

397
00:28:03,343 --> 00:28:04,503
Everything's fine.

398
00:28:04,678 --> 00:28:06,737
Mother of pearl!

399
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:15,645
That burns!

400
00:28:15,822 --> 00:28:17,153
Last chance.

401
00:28:20,727 --> 00:28:24,424
<i>Airlock activated. Three, two, one.</i>

402
00:28:29,002 --> 00:28:30,833
First package away.

403
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:40,345
Absolutely, I love cats.

404
00:28:40,514 --> 00:28:41,538
- Really?
- Yeah.

405
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:49,188
Damn.

406
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,600
Second package away.

407
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:25,057
Oh, good, you heard me.

408
00:29:27,928 --> 00:29:29,793
Third package away.

409
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:31,921
Third package?

410
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:40,298
99, Easter Island.

411
00:29:47,514 --> 00:29:52,349
- I'll be right back!
- Where could you possibly be going?

412
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,575
Okay, never do that again!

413
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:22,772
Stop hanging on me!
Never! Stop it!

414
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:32,785
Max, I can't reach my reserve!
Do something!

415
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:42,833
That would have definitely
worked on me.

416
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:47,372
Are you crazy?
If I can't pull my chute, you'll die too!

417
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,221
Aim for the haystack.
Stop talking.

418
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:12,160
- Aim for the haystack, it's softer.
- Stop talking!

419
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:15,332
You missed it.

420
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:46,224
Okay, not to keep dwelling on this...

421
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,731
...but that was some kiss.

422
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:50,426
How did you know that would work?

423
00:31:50,603 --> 00:31:53,265
Have you kissed other men
who plummeted to their deaths?

424
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,464
Okay, you know what?

425
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:59,044
So far, our entire partnership has consisted
of me getting you out of trouble.

426
00:31:59,212 --> 00:32:01,476
Do you know why?
It is because you keep leading.

427
00:32:01,948 --> 00:32:04,109
So here's how we stop that. I lead now.

428
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:06,411
I'm the one with experience.
You know nothing.

429
00:32:06,753 --> 00:32:08,277
I beg to differ.

430
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:11,151
I looked up your field agent exam,
and I scored...

431
00:32:11,324 --> 00:32:13,315
- My what?
- Your field agent exam.

432
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:15,256
I scored eight points higher than you.

433
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:16,520
This is not a classroom.

434
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:19,221
That's the difference between
an A plus and an A minus.

435
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:23,130
- You'll get us killed if you don't listen!
- A minus!

436
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:26,736
Okay, you're faced with an assassin.
What do you do?

437
00:32:26,906 --> 00:32:30,342
- I take out my gun, and I would shoot...
- You don't have a gun.

438
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,273
- I did until you took it.
- Bang. You're dead.

439
00:32:32,445 --> 00:32:33,673
- No, I'm not.
- Bang. You're dead.

440
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:35,109
- Stop shooting me.
- You are dead.

441
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:37,249
- I don't like it when you shoot me.
- Bang. Bang. Bang.

442
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:38,577
- Stop it.
- Bang. Bang.

443
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:41,915
Stop shooting me more.
You already said I was... Hey.

444
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:43,946
Throw out your manual.

445
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:47,525
Out here there are no grades,
there's only dead, and not dead.

446
00:32:48,628 --> 00:32:52,655
You know, I am not completely
incompetent without a gun.

447
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:55,858
I am a master in the art of Hwa Rang Do.

448
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:01,332
- I was not ready.
- That's my point.

449
00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:02,805
Yeah, you know what? That...

450
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,137
Hey, what was that?

451
00:33:10,216 --> 00:33:13,947
Max is halfway to Moscow. Don't tell me
you're still translating that Russian.

452
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,678
They talk fast, it's hard.

453
00:33:16,823 --> 00:33:19,348
It takes like eight of these morons
to do what Max did.

454
00:33:19,526 --> 00:33:21,721
I can't wait till we finish
the Hymie project.

455
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:23,920
All these stupid agents will be obsolete.

456
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:25,587
- Bye-bye.
- What's a Hymie?

457
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:28,859
Hybrid Mechanical Intelligence Entity.
Basically a robot.

458
00:33:29,035 --> 00:33:30,969
It's a stolen KAOS technology.

459
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:33,537
Being reprogrammed. Top-secret.
Need-to-know.

460
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:35,401
And you don't need.

461
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:39,074
I'm a trained killer.
I can kill you with anything in this office.

462
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:42,214
You wanna die by Post-its?
Because I could make that happen.

463
00:33:42,382 --> 00:33:44,077
And that's a slow death.

464
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:46,916
Larabee.
- Yeah.

465
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:48,815
- Were you the last one to use the copier?
- Yeah.

466
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:50,148
You left it jammed.

467
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:52,655
So? Why don't you...

468
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:54,323
...unjam it?

469
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:57,486
- Just open the door, read the instructions.
- This your stapler?

470
00:33:57,664 --> 00:34:00,224
- Yeah, want me to show you how to use it?
- No.

471
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:02,992
Unjam that.

472
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:04,397
- 23.
- Yes.

473
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:07,096
- Can I have a moment, please?
- Sure.

474
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,934
Yes, Chief.

475
00:34:09,108 --> 00:34:12,271
Let me tell you about a pattern
that's beginning to emerge.

476
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:14,640
As a former field agent,
I'm very much aware...

477
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:17,908
...of how difficult it is
to make the transition to office life.

478
00:34:18,084 --> 00:34:19,608
He didn't unjam the copier.

479
00:34:19,786 --> 00:34:23,051
We have rules here. If you don't
follow the rules, then what are we?

480
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:27,387
I'll tell you what we're not. We're not
people who jam staples into people's heads.

481
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,187
That's CIA crap.

482
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:31,557
All right, look, Chief, I'm your best guy.

483
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:35,223
I don't belong in an office making copies.
I should be out there with Max.

484
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:37,835
Look, 23, no more stapling today.

485
00:34:39,272 --> 00:34:40,569
Just hold on.

486
00:34:46,913 --> 00:34:48,972
So how do you know this place?

487
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:51,446
Well, as an analyst,
I like to keep my ears open.

488
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:53,017
It's amazing what you learn...

489
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:56,986
...listening to chatter.
In fact, Ladislas Krstic loves this place.

490
00:34:57,156 --> 00:35:02,093
As do many KAOS agents.
Cafe Minsk-Pinsk in Smolensk.

491
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:04,457
It doesn't get any better than "thinsk. "

492
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:07,800
You see what I just did?

493
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:10,595
I added an "insk" at the end,
made it sound Russian.

494
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,328
Should've smacked you harder.

495
00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:13,836
Is that your default setting?

496
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:16,475
Do you just punch people
in the face willy-nilly?

497
00:35:16,643 --> 00:35:18,611
"It's Tuesday,
I'll punch Max in the face. "

498
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:21,474
"A box of kittens,
time to punch Max in the face. "

499
00:35:21,648 --> 00:35:23,980
"I'm having bread,
time to punch Max in the face. "

500
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,674
You know, I love bread...

501
00:35:25,852 --> 00:35:28,184
...and I know bread
has a few carbs, but...

502
00:35:28,354 --> 00:35:30,413
...I've never really been afraid of carbs...

503
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:35,027
...because it seems like no matter
how many I eat, I stay "thinsk. "

504
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:52,471
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

505
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:54,374
<i>No sprechen Sie Russian.</i>

506
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:41,427
Boy, you know what? I will tell you,
I love your country.

507
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:44,893
No more Communism.
No rules of any kind, really.

508
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:48,727
I'm filling my suitcase with steroids
and art from ancient Mesopotamia.

509
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:52,530
Ran over an old woman yesterday.
Best vacation I've ever had.

510
00:36:56,242 --> 00:36:58,233
Time to take my pill.

511
00:37:04,717 --> 00:37:07,049
There was a guy in the bathroom
who's really hot.

512
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:10,212
Okay...

513
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,517
No, no, no. Radioactive hot.

514
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:15,957
Although he did have a certain
rugged quality that some find appealing.

515
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:18,097
How did you know he was radioactive?

516
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,956
My watch is a Geiger counter.
You don't have one of these? Huh.

517
00:37:22,402 --> 00:37:25,371
Listen, I think he was part
of the nuclear theft in Chechnya.

518
00:37:25,538 --> 00:37:26,732
We should follow him.

519
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:28,533
I gotta say, Max...

520
00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:30,742
...you picked a good restaurant.

521
00:38:08,748 --> 00:38:09,840
Of course.

522
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,083
Tripe soup.

523
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:15,345
- This must be Ladislas Krstic's house.
- What?

524
00:38:15,521 --> 00:38:19,082
Tripe soup is his favorite dish.
It was in the mission dossier.

525
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:21,351
Let's just see what we're
up against, okay?

526
00:38:29,936 --> 00:38:31,927
I didn't get to eat at the restaurant.

527
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:35,302
And if you skip a meal,
the next meal you overindulge.

528
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:37,534
- Well, let me. I've got nails.
- It's a recipe for...

529
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,810
You owe me $3.

530
00:38:42,682 --> 00:38:45,845
More guards.
We'll have to figure out a way in.

531
00:38:51,757 --> 00:38:52,781
Miniature blowgun.

532
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:55,154
You don't have one of these?

533
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:59,389
These darts are tipped with a tranquilizer
derived from the skin of a lizard...

534
00:38:59,565 --> 00:39:01,692
<i>...known as los zapatos de la muerte.</i>

535
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:02,960
"The shoes of death. "

536
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,167
Excuse me.

537
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:08,902
They're 40 yards out,
that's definitely the edge of my range.

538
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:12,738
I'm going to have to give this one
a little something extra.

539
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:29,985
Wow.

540
00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:31,721
You look spectacular.

541
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:33,024
Thanks.

542
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:35,163
You don't look too bad yourself.

543
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:37,697
Is that a wig?

544
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,394
Yeah, it came with the dress.

545
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:44,099
- How did I get into these clothes?
- That's not important. Let's go.

546
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,677
Am I wearing boxers?

547
00:39:51,717 --> 00:39:54,948
For future reference,
I usually prefer briefs...

548
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:57,555
...for their security and peace of mind.

549
00:39:57,723 --> 00:40:00,055
Going free-bird is not exactly ideal.

550
00:40:00,393 --> 00:40:02,054
I don't like it.

551
00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:19,878
There must be 200 people here.

552
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:23,140
Finding Krstic will be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

553
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:33,320
I'd love to dance.

554
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:37,451
English? But you understand Russian?
Very impressive.

555
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,722
Shall we?

556
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:42,261
I hope your date doesn't mind.

557
00:40:42,435 --> 00:40:44,335
Oh, he's not my date.

558
00:40:44,503 --> 00:40:47,666
He's just a local horse groomer
I hired to drive me around.

559
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,833
It's a tragic story. He's quite deaf.
Really not bright.

560
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:56,339
I am going to dance now.

561
00:40:56,649 --> 00:41:00,585
You go get yourself some punch.

562
00:41:01,821 --> 00:41:03,254
Okay.

563
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,958
I don't even know
how much gets through.

564
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:17,325
Chief, I need your help.

565
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:18,834
You're on. Go ahead.

566
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:20,131
<i>We have found Krstic.</i>

567
00:41:20,306 --> 00:41:22,866
<i>I searched his house.
I can't find his computer network.</i>

568
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:24,670
Get me an infrared satellite scan.

569
00:41:24,844 --> 00:41:27,938
I have to get back to 99,
she is in grave danger.

570
00:41:31,217 --> 00:41:33,117
Your house is so beautiful.

571
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,852
It must be difficult to go to work.

572
00:41:36,856 --> 00:41:39,290
I don't have to go very far.

573
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,689
I don't think so.

574
00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:18,587
I wasn't talking to you.

575
00:42:22,868 --> 00:42:23,892
Me?

576
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:26,831
I don't know.

577
00:42:27,006 --> 00:42:28,564
It'll be fun.

578
00:42:28,974 --> 00:42:29,998
Trust me.

579
00:43:21,827 --> 00:43:23,624
You are so light on your feet.

580
00:43:23,796 --> 00:43:25,229
I recently lost 150 pounds.

581
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:27,361
So did I.

582
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:29,763
Isn't it great?
I have so much more energy now.

583
00:43:29,935 --> 00:43:31,402
Me too.

584
00:44:38,137 --> 00:44:40,332
- Thanks for jumping.
- No problem.

585
00:45:04,196 --> 00:45:06,221
Thank you for the lovely dance.

586
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:29,852
Did you see anything
while I was dancing?

587
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:33,389
Just once, but I don't think you expected
him to lift you so high.

588
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,786
Anyway, I found out that the office
is in the guest house.

589
00:45:37,963 --> 00:45:39,555
Really? How'd you do that?

590
00:45:39,732 --> 00:45:42,394
Show him a little decolletage,
cleavage, bat your eyes?

591
00:45:42,568 --> 00:45:44,559
I'm not judging, just detecting a pattern.

592
00:45:44,737 --> 00:45:47,103
- Ready to work?
- I'm ready to work. You ready?

593
00:45:47,273 --> 00:45:49,207
- Oh, my God.
- You're just having fun showing your:

594
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,980
Six guards.
We are going to need another way in.

595
00:46:00,152 --> 00:46:02,313
Stand by, Max. Larabee, let's go. Move it.

596
00:46:02,755 --> 00:46:04,882
- What'd you do?
- I can't find the right screen.

597
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:07,252
It was here a second ago,
then it went away.

598
00:46:07,426 --> 00:46:10,088
- What did you hit?
- Don't yell at me. It's not helping!

599
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:11,729
If you don't find that screen...

600
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:14,832
...I'm gonna have you hunting
for land mines, with a hammer!

601
00:46:17,836 --> 00:46:19,827
<i>Got it, Max. There is one other entrance.</i>

602
00:46:20,005 --> 00:46:21,063
What kind of entrance?

603
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,141
The kind where you'll wanna
throw your shoes out afterwards.

604
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,803
Oh, great, rats.
It's not enough that there's poop.

605
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:33,918
You know what, I never saw James Bond
in rats or poop, let alone rats and poop.

606
00:46:34,787 --> 00:46:37,688
Look, a rat riding on a piece of poop.

607
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:40,586
Stop it. It's just a storm drain.

608
00:46:44,863 --> 00:46:46,296
Here it is.

609
00:46:57,676 --> 00:47:01,305
Exploding dental floss.
You don't have this? Hm.

610
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:12,789
Three, two...

611
00:47:13,459 --> 00:47:14,483
...one.

612
00:47:37,383 --> 00:47:39,010
Right.

613
00:47:44,857 --> 00:47:46,017
Come on.

614
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:04,540
Are you staring at my butt?

615
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:07,208
No, I am not.

616
00:48:07,379 --> 00:48:09,711
I might have been before, but I am...

617
00:48:09,882 --> 00:48:12,612
Now I am again. All right, I'm stopping.

618
00:48:12,785 --> 00:48:15,845
Pay attention to what I'm doing,
so that you can follow me exactly.

619
00:48:16,255 --> 00:48:17,517
Yep.

620
00:48:37,943 --> 00:48:40,207
Okay, Max. Little heads-up.

621
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:43,439
High-intensity lasers. Whatever
part of you does touch gets sliced.

622
00:48:43,615 --> 00:48:46,778
One more reason
why boxers were a bad idea.

623
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,464
All right, so do I have to do it
exactly like that?

624
00:49:01,633 --> 00:49:02,827
Just come on.

625
00:49:16,548 --> 00:49:18,948
That's impressive. Wow.

626
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:22,948
Careful, this one's tricky.

627
00:49:23,122 --> 00:49:24,589
Good.

628
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:25,781
Very good.

629
00:49:27,993 --> 00:49:29,153
Okay, it's not that good.

630
00:49:48,847 --> 00:49:50,041
Max. Max.

631
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:51,544
Stay calm.

632
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:56,148
Max, keep it together. Keep it together.

633
00:49:57,189 --> 00:49:58,713
Max. Max.

634
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:01,884
Careful! No, no.

635
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,960
He's nibbling. That's not cheese!

636
00:50:05,764 --> 00:50:06,992
Max, be quiet!

637
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:17,298
Okay, shall we?

638
00:50:55,747 --> 00:50:57,237
Did I hear something?

639
00:50:57,416 --> 00:51:00,686
Yes, there were some
tap dancers in the hallway.

640
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:06,115
Damn it. I can't get into their system.
Biometric security.

641
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:08,054
If you don't mind, 99...

642
00:51:13,265 --> 00:51:17,361
The old "steam sticks to everything
but the oil from the last thumb print" trick.

643
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:18,560
Here we go.

644
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:22,035
- Shipments of explosives.
- Your boyfriend is a very bad man.

645
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:25,370
- And a really good kisser.
- Ignoring that.

646
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,210
Look at that shipment of detonators.
It's a little odd.

647
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:33,283
Well, he is a bomb-maker.

648
00:51:33,452 --> 00:51:36,649
No. What is odd is that it was shipped
to a bakery in Moscow.

649
00:51:36,822 --> 00:51:39,382
These detonators can also be used
for nuclear bombs.

650
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:41,389
I think this is our connection to KAOS.

651
00:51:54,473 --> 00:51:55,997
I set that up.

652
00:52:06,818 --> 00:52:08,080
Let her go.

653
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,919
No.

654
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:17,418
I'm not totally incompetent
without a gun, you know.

655
00:52:42,154 --> 00:52:43,280
Thanks for the help.

656
00:52:44,323 --> 00:52:46,848
That's enough. Pity.

657
00:52:47,492 --> 00:52:51,690
I'm about to shoot beautiful woman
and her retard stable boy.

658
00:52:51,897 --> 00:52:52,921
And yet...

659
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:55,994
...I will sleep like baby.

660
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:04,499
- Not bad for a rookie.
- Not bad for an old lady.

661
00:53:15,187 --> 00:53:16,347
Siegfried here.

662
00:53:16,521 --> 00:53:18,648
<i>How could you possibly screw this up?</i>

663
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:20,314
Krstic was a fool.

664
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:23,222
<i>- And they got lucky.
- Who's that? Who's speaking?</i>

665
00:53:23,395 --> 00:53:24,521
That's no one, sir.

666
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:27,494
<i>They're heading towards you.
Don't disappoint me again.</i>

667
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,156
Don't worry, sir. They won't get pa...

668
00:53:30,902 --> 00:53:31,994
Why does he do that?

669
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,035
Don't look at me. I'm no one.

670
00:53:34,206 --> 00:53:35,696
And don't you forget it.

671
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:38,238
Everyone here can be replaced.

672
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,071
I even have backup for you.

673
00:53:40,245 --> 00:53:42,236
It's called a rhinoceros.

674
00:54:08,073 --> 00:54:10,871
I think it's time to find new wheels.
Pull over.

675
00:54:16,915 --> 00:54:19,281
I feel good about the mission so far,
don't you?

676
00:54:19,451 --> 00:54:20,713
So far, sure.

677
00:54:20,886 --> 00:54:22,786
I think we work very well together.

678
00:54:22,954 --> 00:54:24,285
Like at the mansion.

679
00:54:24,456 --> 00:54:28,586
The way I held that guy's hair
while you punched him in the throat.

680
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,625
That was nice.

681
00:54:31,296 --> 00:54:32,320
Nice?

682
00:54:32,497 --> 00:54:34,158
Yeah, well, good teamwork.

683
00:54:34,332 --> 00:54:35,799
What are you doing?

684
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:38,492
I'm just saying that I think
we're very compatible.

685
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:42,106
I think that you are confusing adrenaline
with, I don't know...

686
00:54:42,274 --> 00:54:43,832
...some other kind of hormone.

687
00:54:44,009 --> 00:54:46,409
- No. That's not...
- Know what, Max? Just stop it.

688
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,309
Let me give you a lesson
that I had to learn the hard way.

689
00:54:50,482 --> 00:54:52,643
You can't trust anyone out here,
not even me.

690
00:54:52,818 --> 00:54:55,514
I mean, you know,
I could be a double agent.

691
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:58,420
The break-in at CONTROL
was probably an inside job.

692
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,650
It happened just as I got back.
How do you know that it wasn't me?

693
00:55:02,627 --> 00:55:05,187
- What are we talking about here?
- Let's just find a car.

694
00:55:05,363 --> 00:55:08,025
Which one's gonna attract
the least attention?

695
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:12,128
All right, well, we have
a couple Soviet-era sedans here...

696
00:55:12,304 --> 00:55:15,705
...we have that tractor, that cart...

697
00:55:16,508 --> 00:55:18,703
...and... That'll work.

698
00:55:19,711 --> 00:55:22,578
- No.
- Yes.

699
00:55:22,747 --> 00:55:24,146
No.

700
00:55:24,483 --> 00:55:25,677
Yes.

701
00:55:29,321 --> 00:55:32,313
- Oh, yeah, we are really under the radar.
- Will you relax?

702
00:55:32,491 --> 00:55:35,358
Since the fall of Communism,
everybody has one of these here.

703
00:56:02,787 --> 00:56:04,550
There's our little KAOS bakery.

704
00:56:04,723 --> 00:56:07,851
I don't have to remind you,
but this isn't like the last place.

705
00:56:08,026 --> 00:56:11,553
There's no party, there's no dancing.
Everyone in there is a trained killer.

706
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,595
Do you understand? Okay.

707
00:56:13,765 --> 00:56:16,233
Did they explain to you
how your belt buckle works?

708
00:56:16,401 --> 00:56:19,427
No, but the technology for holding
up pants hasn't changed much.

709
00:56:19,604 --> 00:56:21,572
- Max.
- Hey, what?

710
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,838
This one has a compartment.
Inside there's a pill.

711
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,070
If captured, it would cause death
in nine seconds.

712
00:56:28,246 --> 00:56:29,270
Great.

713
00:56:29,814 --> 00:56:32,783
But how exactly do I get them to take it?

714
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,822
- Not much of a laugher, are you?
- Here. Put this on.

715
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,389
- On what?
- On your molar.

716
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,687
It's a tooth radio. It sends sound
up your jawbone, into your ear.

717
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:48,026
I can't hear anything outside your mouth,
so if you get in trouble, you have to say so.

718
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,189
Is it working?

719
00:56:52,671 --> 00:56:54,536
- Is it working?
- Yes.

720
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:55,934
Good.

721
00:56:56,107 --> 00:56:57,131
Okay.

722
00:56:57,309 --> 00:57:00,005
Well, you know what to do.
Good luck in there.

723
00:57:00,178 --> 00:57:01,839
You too.

724
00:57:30,008 --> 00:57:31,839
<i>Free rugelach?</i>

725
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:34,774
No, thank you.
I am here for something else.

726
00:57:35,113 --> 00:57:36,410
Bread?

727
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:40,517
- Something hot.
- We have rolls that just came out.

728
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:43,313
Even hotter. Much, much hotter.

729
00:57:43,655 --> 00:57:45,816
I already have boyfriend.

730
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:49,219
- All right...
- Although, I could make exception.

731
00:57:49,394 --> 00:57:50,418
No, that's okay.

732
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:53,792
Sure? Flour sacks in back,
very comfortable.

733
00:57:53,965 --> 00:57:57,457
I don't think we are on the same page.

734
00:57:57,802 --> 00:58:01,761
I'm here because Ladislas Krstic sent me.

735
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,602
Ah. Take number.

736
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,979
But I'm the only one here.

737
00:58:12,684 --> 00:58:14,311
Oh.

738
00:58:43,915 --> 00:58:45,212
Who are you?

739
00:58:45,383 --> 00:58:48,079
My name is Nudnik Shpilkes.
Who are you?

740
00:58:48,253 --> 00:58:50,847
- I am Siegfried.
- Did you say Siegfried?

741
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,179
Max!

742
00:58:53,425 --> 00:58:54,449
Yes.

743
00:58:54,626 --> 00:58:56,526
I understand that you're
the man to see...

744
00:58:56,695 --> 00:58:59,755
...if someone is interested in acquiring
items of a nuclear nature.

745
00:58:59,931 --> 00:59:03,492
- How do I know you're not CONTROL?
- Lf I were CONTROL, you'd already be dead.

746
00:59:03,668 --> 00:59:05,602
If you were CONTROL, you'd be dead.

747
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:09,729
Well, neither of us is dead,
so I'm obviously not from CONTROL.

748
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,461
That actually makes sense.

749
00:59:16,806 --> 00:59:19,866
Follow me, Mr. Shpilkes.

750
00:59:26,082 --> 00:59:28,107
Test. Test.

751
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:34,119
Ah. The "Ode to Joy"
from Beethoven's Ninth.

752
00:59:34,291 --> 00:59:38,284
Stone deaf when he wrote it.
Syphilis. Fun stuff.

753
00:59:38,928 --> 00:59:43,456
Yes, a personal favorite.
A bit familiar, but it ends with a bang.

754
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:46,291
You're doing great, Max.

755
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:50,530
What I'm about to show you is
the inner sanctum of our entire operation.

756
00:59:50,707 --> 00:59:53,232
The inner sanctum
of the entire operation?

757
00:59:57,113 --> 00:59:58,171
Yes.

758
01:00:07,057 --> 01:00:08,524
This is it?

759
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,125
Of course not. I lied.

760
01:00:10,293 --> 01:00:11,590
He does that.

761
01:00:11,761 --> 01:00:14,730
I'm going to kill you,
and then I'm going to kill your partner.

762
01:00:14,898 --> 01:00:16,661
I don't know who you're talking about.

763
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:25,466
Ah. Mrs. Shpilkes must be lost.

764
01:00:25,642 --> 01:00:28,907
I think it's only fair to warn you,
this facility is surrounded...

765
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:31,980
...by a highly trained team
of 130 Black Op snipers.

766
01:00:32,148 --> 01:00:34,116
- I don't believe you.
- Would you believe...

767
01:00:34,284 --> 01:00:36,275
...two dozen Delta Force commandos?

768
01:00:36,453 --> 01:00:38,978
- No.
- How about Chuck Norris with a BB gun?

769
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:40,989
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.

770
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:47,357
Well, Mr. Shtarker,
I think you've underestimated me...

771
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:49,521
...and the element of surpr...!

772
01:00:59,609 --> 01:01:02,339
99, we've been compromised. Get out.

773
01:01:22,232 --> 01:01:23,927
<i>Access denied.</i>

774
01:01:53,763 --> 01:01:56,288
<i>Access denied. Access denied.</i>

775
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:58,934
<i>Access denied.</i>

776
01:02:11,981 --> 01:02:13,005
Max, where are you?

777
01:02:13,183 --> 01:02:15,413
99, I found the yellowcake.

778
01:02:15,585 --> 01:02:17,246
Of course you did, it's a bakery.

779
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,082
No, not yellow "cake" cake,
yellowcake uranium.

780
01:02:20,256 --> 01:02:24,750
Although there is yellow "cake" cake
here as well.

781
01:02:25,595 --> 01:02:26,857
Oh, Max.

782
01:02:54,591 --> 01:02:56,218
Max, do you read...?

783
01:02:56,392 --> 01:02:57,654
99!

784
01:02:57,827 --> 01:02:59,658
What happened to your radio?

785
01:02:59,829 --> 01:03:02,821
I swallowed it. I can get it back,
but you may not want it.

786
01:03:02,999 --> 01:03:04,801
- Good Lord.
- Listen...

787
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:07,531
...I've placed charges
at points all over the building.

788
01:03:07,704 --> 01:03:11,401
What? Max, you can't blow up a building
full of radioactive material!

789
01:03:11,574 --> 01:03:15,476
I know that, 99. I've placed only enough
charges to safely bury the weapons lab.

790
01:03:16,513 --> 01:03:17,707
Max, that's brilliant.

791
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:21,681
Wow. That's maybe the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

792
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,015
- I don't get it, I thought he was dead!
- I will say this, he is not a quitter.

793
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,002
This is just ridiculous!

794
01:04:19,242 --> 01:04:20,266
99!

795
01:04:20,443 --> 01:04:21,569
Wake up, 99.

796
01:04:21,744 --> 01:04:23,905
Maybe you should kiss him again.

797
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:30,148
Wait, I know that voice.
The chatter! Dalip.

798
01:04:37,927 --> 01:04:39,121
Ow! That was me!

799
01:04:43,032 --> 01:04:45,034
- Max?
- I'm... Yep, still fighting.

800
01:05:04,153 --> 01:05:08,613
Now, Dalip, I can prove that I know you.
Your favorite dish is chicken tikka!

801
01:05:09,392 --> 01:05:12,418
<i>Like me, you enjoy
American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest.</i>

802
01:05:26,643 --> 01:05:28,372
Ow.

803
01:05:38,121 --> 01:05:41,284
Wait, wait, Dalip,
there's something else that I know.

804
01:05:41,457 --> 01:05:42,617
Max. Max.

805
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:46,523
Your marriage is in trouble.
Your darling wife, Zeenat, is leaving you.

806
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:49,325
But there is still hope.

807
01:05:49,499 --> 01:05:50,966
Do you love her?

808
01:05:56,205 --> 01:06:00,039
- Wha...?
- Then show her. Go home for lunch.

809
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:02,769
Take her with you the next time
you go to kill someone.

810
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:04,771
She just wants to be with you...

811
01:06:04,947 --> 01:06:07,211
...and that means
less time with her sister...

812
01:06:07,383 --> 01:06:10,079
...who we both know is undermining
your relationship.

813
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,354
Kick the gun to me.

814
01:06:13,523 --> 01:06:15,081
99, please.

815
01:06:15,825 --> 01:06:17,383
Big people feel pain too.

816
01:06:29,539 --> 01:06:30,870
What are you doing?

817
01:06:31,674 --> 01:06:34,074
Oh, no. Oh, no.

818
01:06:34,243 --> 01:06:35,870
Max!

819
01:06:38,247 --> 01:06:42,877
Okay. Okay. That's all right. That's okay.

820
01:06:44,987 --> 01:06:48,150
Her sister's such a bitch.

821
01:06:55,698 --> 01:06:57,996
- You all right?
- Yeah. That was amazing.

822
01:06:59,302 --> 01:07:00,667
Thank you.

823
01:07:02,772 --> 01:07:04,296
We gotta go.

824
01:07:12,849 --> 01:07:13,873
99.

825
01:07:20,723 --> 01:07:23,419
- What was that?
- I cramped up.

826
01:07:25,928 --> 01:07:27,418
Come on. Come here.

827
01:07:27,797 --> 01:07:29,458
Good idea.

828
01:07:29,632 --> 01:07:33,363
We will climb up with you,
and we'll all go... together.

829
01:07:43,346 --> 01:07:44,677
He left us here.

830
01:07:45,014 --> 01:07:46,641
What a douche.

831
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:07,268
Missed it by that much.

832
01:08:11,073 --> 01:08:14,008
Well, that's convenient. Shoot them.

833
01:08:22,518 --> 01:08:24,816
Whatever you do, 99, don't look down!

834
01:08:24,987 --> 01:08:28,616
I'm gonna try to get us over to that ledge!
We can do this, 99!

835
01:08:29,959 --> 01:08:31,017
Max.

836
01:08:31,661 --> 01:08:32,685
Right.

837
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:38,761
Thanks, Chief.

838
01:08:39,368 --> 01:08:40,892
Okay, no problem.

839
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,903
The Chief is thrilled.
He sent 23 out to observe the cleanup.

840
01:08:44,073 --> 01:08:45,097
Great.

841
01:08:46,309 --> 01:08:50,575
Listen, is it possible that you could
answer a personal question?

842
01:08:50,746 --> 01:08:52,577
It's possible.

843
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:55,509
Why did you change your looks?

844
01:08:56,652 --> 01:09:00,281
Oh. Um...
That's not really a personal question.

845
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:04,082
Things from my non-work sphere
spilled into my work sphere.

846
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:08,196
Facts became known, identities were
compromised, and I became a brunette.

847
01:09:08,364 --> 01:09:11,424
Wow. That is a great story...

848
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:15,002
...in which you revealed
absolutely nothing about yourself.

849
01:09:20,443 --> 01:09:22,070
I blew a mission.

850
01:09:23,846 --> 01:09:28,510
I was involved with someone from work.
I lost focus. The mission blew up.

851
01:09:28,684 --> 01:09:33,144
I broke it off with that person,
but my identity had already been revealed.

852
01:09:33,322 --> 01:09:34,880
So I had two choices.

853
01:09:35,057 --> 01:09:37,753
I could either spend the rest of my life
behind a desk...

854
01:09:38,628 --> 01:09:40,596
...which would be like
eight hours a day...

855
01:09:40,763 --> 01:09:43,459
...of scraping a cheese grater
against my forehead.

856
01:09:43,633 --> 01:09:45,464
- Oh, you know.
- Yes.

857
01:09:45,635 --> 01:09:48,263
Or I could change my face,
so that's what I did.

858
01:09:51,107 --> 01:09:55,771
And it was painful,
but it needed to be done, and s...

859
01:10:00,216 --> 01:10:03,515
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
- Okay.

860
01:10:06,989 --> 01:10:09,253
I used to look like my mom.

861
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:17,622
I used to look like
two of my moms put together.

862
01:10:55,871 --> 01:10:58,704
Sir, if I may ask...

863
01:10:58,874 --> 01:11:01,035
...how did you choose the target?

864
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,576
- Why Los Angeles?
- Major city...

865
01:11:03,746 --> 01:11:05,611
...lots of media attention...

866
01:11:06,015 --> 01:11:07,676
...and the president will be there.

867
01:11:08,184 --> 01:11:11,449
Still, it's too bad
about all the dead movie stars.

868
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,917
Yes.

869
01:11:13,089 --> 01:11:17,458
What will we do without
their razor-sharp political advice?

870
01:11:21,964 --> 01:11:25,058
Oh, my God, have you eaten the crew?

871
01:11:25,568 --> 01:11:28,128
Oh, look, it understands.

872
01:11:28,304 --> 01:11:29,965
Get back to work.

873
01:11:46,222 --> 01:11:50,386
No, that's not possible.
No, no, no. Max said that...

874
01:11:52,828 --> 01:11:53,988
No.

875
01:11:57,733 --> 01:11:59,667
That doesn't make any sense.

876
01:12:01,437 --> 01:12:04,372
Yellowcake uranium, warheads,
an entire production line.

877
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:07,509
There's nothing here
but what used to be a bakery.

878
01:12:07,676 --> 01:12:10,236
There are no weapons?
No radioactivity of any kind?

879
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:13,177
Nothing. I've swept the entire area,
and it's clean.

880
01:12:13,349 --> 01:12:16,546
- But Max said that he s...
- Did you see the evidence yourself?

881
01:12:17,053 --> 01:12:18,384
No.

882
01:12:18,788 --> 01:12:21,586
No, every time he found something,
he was alone.

883
01:12:27,797 --> 01:12:29,594
What do you want me to do with Max?

884
01:12:29,765 --> 01:12:31,255
- Do with Max?
- Max?

885
01:12:33,869 --> 01:12:36,360
You were right when you said
I shouldn't trust you.

886
01:12:38,207 --> 01:12:39,401
Give me the phone.

887
01:12:43,712 --> 01:12:46,180
And who might this be? Siegfried?

888
01:12:46,348 --> 01:12:47,508
<i>Hello, Max.</i>

889
01:12:47,683 --> 01:12:48,707
Chief?

890
01:12:51,153 --> 01:12:52,916
Knockout gas, 99?

891
01:12:53,089 --> 01:12:56,456
Please. I have trained my body
to be impervious to...

892
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:57,956
That's new stuff.

893
01:13:00,896 --> 01:13:02,420
Oh, Max.

894
01:13:09,839 --> 01:13:11,864
I'm very disappointed, Max.

895
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:14,942
I thought you and I were supposedly
cut from the same cloth.

896
01:13:15,111 --> 01:13:17,306
How can you think
that I am a double agent?

897
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,948
You lied about finding evidence
of radioactivity.

898
01:13:20,116 --> 01:13:22,414
Killed Krstic before
anybody could question him.

899
01:13:22,585 --> 01:13:25,782
There's a matter of your
stoving my head in with a fire extinguisher.

900
01:13:25,955 --> 01:13:30,256
I said I was sorry. You just didn't hear me,
because you were in a mini coma.

901
01:13:30,426 --> 01:13:32,121
You've made CONTROL a laughingstock.

902
01:13:32,294 --> 01:13:35,092
The vice president wants to shut us down,
you know.

903
01:13:37,867 --> 01:13:38,891
99.

904
01:13:39,602 --> 01:13:41,194
This whole week...

905
01:13:41,837 --> 01:13:43,099
...last night...

906
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:45,233
...you know me.

907
01:13:45,407 --> 01:13:46,840
Apparently not.

908
01:13:47,643 --> 01:13:48,837
Oh, my God!

909
01:13:49,011 --> 01:13:51,104
You two? You and Max?

910
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,976
You said we had to break up
because we work together.

911
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:55,344
Oh, my God! You and 23?

912
01:13:55,951 --> 01:13:58,419
I am so sexually threatened right now.

913
01:14:03,893 --> 01:14:05,383
<i>You have reached...</i>

914
01:14:05,561 --> 01:14:07,426
<i>...the United States
Department of Homeland Security.</i>

915
01:14:07,596 --> 01:14:10,064
<i>For threats against
the continental United States, press 1.</i>

916
01:14:10,232 --> 01:14:12,996
<i>For threats against Hawaii, press 2.
For threats against Puerto Rico...</i>

917
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:18,106
You know, you're the only human being
I know who snores when he's awake?

918
01:14:18,274 --> 01:14:19,901
<i>If you're calling from a rotary...</i>

919
01:14:20,075 --> 01:14:22,669
Okay, today's threat assessment.

920
01:14:22,845 --> 01:14:27,339
- There are 72 threats on the list. Mike?
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

921
01:14:27,516 --> 01:14:30,781
Okay, we have a deteriorating situation
in Venezuela.

922
01:14:30,953 --> 01:14:33,513
We have a deteriorating situation
in Afghanistan.

923
01:14:33,689 --> 01:14:36,385
What about the deteriorating situation
in North Korea?

924
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:38,424
- I was getting to that.
- When? Next week?

925
01:14:38,594 --> 01:14:40,926
Yes, next Tuesday,
right after I kick your ass.

926
01:14:41,096 --> 01:14:45,328
Gentlemen, when we argue,
the terrorists win.

927
01:14:48,804 --> 01:14:51,568
Anyway, last night at a private dinner...

928
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:55,437
...President Kim Jong-il
made a very odd threat to, and I quote:

929
01:14:55,611 --> 01:14:58,205
"Make a pudding from the bones
of Americans. "

930
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,211
That guy's insane.

931
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:04,409
Doesn't he know bones are crunchy?
Who'd want a crunchy pudding?

932
01:15:06,455 --> 01:15:07,479
War room.

933
01:15:07,656 --> 01:15:11,649
Finally. My name is Siegfried,
and I represent KAOS.

934
01:15:11,827 --> 01:15:16,025
<i>Over the past few months, we have
assembled a stockpile of nuclear weapons...</i>

935
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:21,101
<i>...which we have distributed
to 20 unfriendly, unstable dictators.</i>

936
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:25,135
For the moment, KAOS retains
the bomb activation codes...

937
01:15:25,307 --> 01:15:29,209
...but we will release the codes
unless our demands are met.

938
01:15:29,378 --> 01:15:30,436
What are your demands?

939
01:15:30,613 --> 01:15:32,672
200 billion dollars by 3 p. m.

940
01:15:32,848 --> 01:15:35,373
200 billion dollars by 3 p. M?

941
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,950
<i>You seem a bit slow.</i>

942
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:40,316
- Is there someone else I can talk to?
- Good one.

943
01:15:40,889 --> 01:15:43,619
Look, Siegfried,
we don't negotiate with terrorists...

944
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:46,124
...and you're obviously bluffing.
Take a hike.

945
01:15:46,295 --> 01:15:47,922
What? Are you kidding me?

946
01:15:48,097 --> 01:15:51,726
You spent the morning talking about
pudding, and you ignore a credible threat?

947
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:54,368
Credible? Come on.
KAOS has been defunct for 20 years.

948
01:15:54,536 --> 01:15:57,061
With all due respect,
the CIA knows nothing about KAOS.

949
01:15:57,239 --> 01:15:59,673
CONTROL has to be in charge here.

950
01:15:59,842 --> 01:16:02,834
- Like when you bombed that bakery?
- Muffins of mass destruction.

951
01:16:04,713 --> 01:16:06,874
That's it!
I've been waiting for this since Nixon.

952
01:16:07,049 --> 01:16:10,280
- Here we go.
- I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!

953
01:16:10,452 --> 01:16:12,511
- Okay!
- Okay! Come on!

954
01:16:15,824 --> 01:16:18,418
It seems like they don't believe you.

955
01:16:18,994 --> 01:16:23,328
Which is why we've arranged
for a little demonstration.

956
01:17:11,313 --> 01:17:13,110
Chief, you wanted to see me?

957
01:17:13,282 --> 01:17:16,683
Yes. You and 23 are coming with me
to see the president.

958
01:17:16,852 --> 01:17:19,582
- Can't you call him?
- Vice president won't let me through.

959
01:17:19,988 --> 01:17:22,821
I can't believe we have to go
all the way to Los Angeles.

960
01:17:22,991 --> 01:17:24,822
Why is the president never here?

961
01:17:24,993 --> 01:17:27,553
I'm sure whatever he's doing
is vital to the nation.

962
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:29,795
"Good night, moon.

963
01:17:30,566 --> 01:17:33,501
Good night,
cow jumping over the moon. "

964
01:17:34,503 --> 01:17:37,802
Actually, I think you would suck
as my teacher.

965
01:17:37,973 --> 01:17:40,464
Well, from wh...

966
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:44,140
Hey, Smart. Happy birthday.

967
01:17:51,387 --> 01:17:53,150
I'm fat!

968
01:18:03,098 --> 01:18:04,531
Gentlemen.

969
01:18:06,802 --> 01:18:09,600
Oh. Good, the itchy kind.

970
01:18:09,772 --> 01:18:10,864
My favorite.

971
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:12,836
Does this one also have smallpox?

972
01:18:16,011 --> 01:18:18,138
And that was a human tooth.

973
01:18:18,313 --> 01:18:22,010
<i>American Top 40.
With Ryan Seacrest.</i>

974
01:18:22,184 --> 01:18:25,017
<i>Here's a sweet dedication
from a little lady named Dalip.</i>

975
01:18:25,187 --> 01:18:26,654
<i>It's to her boyfriend, Max.</i>

976
01:18:26,822 --> 01:18:31,350
<i>"Meet me in L.A.
Things will be very hot. Nuclear hot. "</i>

977
01:18:31,527 --> 01:18:34,894
<i>I don't know, if I were Max,
I would get myself to L.A.</i>

978
01:18:44,706 --> 01:18:47,072
Hey! Dumb guards!

979
01:18:47,242 --> 01:18:51,474
Why don't you come in here so I can
make you my pretty little girlfriends.

980
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,114
You'll have to shower for weeks!

981
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:57,113
But you will never get the smell off...

982
01:18:57,286 --> 01:18:59,516
You two seem very angry.

983
01:19:01,256 --> 01:19:03,383
Thank you, sir, may I have another?

984
01:19:05,694 --> 01:19:07,262
I was kidding.

985
01:19:15,404 --> 01:19:18,999
9-4-3-6-8.

986
01:19:22,611 --> 01:19:25,546
9-4-3-6-8.

987
01:19:42,598 --> 01:19:44,361
Turn around slowly.

988
01:19:46,568 --> 01:19:49,867
Guys, you have to believe me.
I am not a double agent.

989
01:19:50,038 --> 01:19:52,529
- We never thought you were.
- Yeah, we love you, man.

990
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:55,472
Then what's with the firearm
and the freak-show expressions?

991
01:19:55,644 --> 01:19:57,043
For the security cameras.

992
01:19:57,212 --> 01:20:00,477
If it looks like we let you go,
we'd totally get fired.

993
01:20:00,649 --> 01:20:01,707
Got it.

994
01:20:04,353 --> 01:20:05,820
So where are the Chief and 99?

995
01:20:05,988 --> 01:20:07,956
They flew to L.A.
To talk to the president.

996
01:20:08,123 --> 01:20:10,523
I need to get out of here
before someone stops me.

997
01:20:10,692 --> 01:20:12,284
- Overpower us.
- Good idea.

998
01:20:12,461 --> 01:20:14,122
Bruce, I will smash you in the face.

999
01:20:14,296 --> 01:20:16,890
- Thank you.
- Lloyd, I'll simulate your disembowelment.

1000
01:20:17,065 --> 01:20:18,589
Ready? One...

1001
01:20:18,767 --> 01:20:21,167
Not yet! I haven't punched yet.
React when I punch.

1002
01:20:21,336 --> 01:20:22,701
- Oh, yeah.
- One...

1003
01:20:22,871 --> 01:20:24,634
...two, three.

1004
01:20:26,074 --> 01:20:27,701
- Wrong way.
- Okay, wait.

1005
01:20:27,876 --> 01:20:30,344
- Sometimes I faint.
- I'm not going to hit you.

1006
01:20:30,512 --> 01:20:34,107
No, but when I see blood, or when
I talk about blood, or think about blood...

1007
01:20:34,283 --> 01:20:36,945
There will be no blood.
Hang in there. Hang in, buddy.

1008
01:21:24,266 --> 01:21:25,927
What are you doing, dummkopf?

1009
01:21:26,101 --> 01:21:29,867
Running out in the middle of the road!
You could get hit by a car!

1010
01:21:30,339 --> 01:21:32,864
Well, that was ironic.

1011
01:21:47,155 --> 01:21:48,645
Chief, I'm not buying it.

1012
01:21:48,824 --> 01:21:51,816
With all our satellites,
there's no way anybody could possibly...

1013
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:54,258
...have nuclear bombs
that we wouldn't know about.

1014
01:21:54,429 --> 01:21:55,828
"Nuclear!"

1015
01:21:56,231 --> 01:21:57,789
- What's that?
- Sorry.

1016
01:21:57,966 --> 01:22:01,299
Mr. President, if I could just
please show you some data, you'd agree...

1017
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:02,994
Well, just back up here a second.

1018
01:22:03,171 --> 01:22:05,162
First thing I'd like to know is...

1019
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:07,501
...what did the vice president
say about this?

1020
01:22:07,676 --> 01:22:11,407
I'm afraid the vice president and I had
a less-than-cordial encounter yesterday.

1021
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,343
- Less-than-cordial, you say?
- Yes, sir.

1022
01:22:13,515 --> 01:22:14,539
I'll say.

1023
01:22:15,917 --> 01:22:18,613
The chairman of joint chiefs
sent me this little movie.

1024
01:22:18,787 --> 01:22:20,448
Put it right here on my cell phone.

1025
01:22:20,622 --> 01:22:22,613
Let me share this with you.
This is my favorite part.

1026
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:25,282
<i>I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!</i>

1027
01:22:27,162 --> 01:22:28,356
Oh, Chief.

1028
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:29,690
Very sweet tackle.

1029
01:22:29,865 --> 01:22:32,356
Look. Look at the surprise on his face.

1030
01:22:32,534 --> 01:22:34,866
I probably owe you an apology
for that, sir.

1031
01:22:35,037 --> 01:22:36,629
No. Please, just save your breath.

1032
01:22:36,805 --> 01:22:39,069
But I have to agree
with that son of a bitch.

1033
01:22:39,241 --> 01:22:41,573
We cannot respond to every threat.

1034
01:22:42,944 --> 01:22:44,377
Case closed.

1035
01:23:07,969 --> 01:23:08,993
Max?

1036
01:23:09,171 --> 01:23:10,297
<i>Hello, 99.</i>

1037
01:23:10,472 --> 01:23:12,303
Trace 99's call, now!

1038
01:23:12,474 --> 01:23:14,339
<i>- Where are you?
- That's not important.</i>

1039
01:23:14,509 --> 01:23:18,411
<i>What is important is that KAOS has planted
a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles.</i>

1040
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,548
We got him. He's still in Washington.

1041
01:23:20,716 --> 01:23:23,981
<i>Listen, while I was in my cell,
I had some time to think.</i>

1042
01:23:26,121 --> 01:23:31,184
<i>I realized that even though I was accused
of something I didn't do, I was happy.</i>

1043
01:23:31,626 --> 01:23:36,495
<i>Because at least for a little while,
I got to live my dream of being an agent.</i>

1044
01:23:37,499 --> 01:23:39,262
<i>And I got to be with you.</i>

1045
01:23:39,434 --> 01:23:42,267
<i>I learned that you have
a mean right cross...</i>

1046
01:23:42,437 --> 01:23:45,634
<i>...you are almost as good
a dancer as me...</i>

1047
01:23:45,807 --> 01:23:49,038
<i>- ... and you used to look like your mom.
- Max.</i>

1048
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:52,544
<i>Please, 99. All I'm asking is for you
to look me in the eyes...</i>

1049
01:23:52,714 --> 01:23:55,308
<i>...and tell me that
you don't feel something too.</i>

1050
01:23:56,084 --> 01:23:57,244
Freeze!

1051
01:23:57,419 --> 01:24:01,185
Oh, Max. How could I look in your eyes?

1052
01:24:02,557 --> 01:24:03,819
Just turn around.

1053
01:24:11,233 --> 01:24:13,224
Why are you talking into your shoe?

1054
01:24:13,401 --> 01:24:16,802
The old "call forwarding
from the shoe phone to the cell phone...

1055
01:24:16,972 --> 01:24:20,305
...so you don't know where I am,
then I appear on the roof behind you...

1056
01:24:20,475 --> 01:24:22,466
...and surprise everyone" trick.

1057
01:24:22,644 --> 01:24:24,509
- Don't move.
- What are you doing?

1058
01:24:24,679 --> 01:24:25,703
How did you get here?

1059
01:24:28,884 --> 01:24:30,977
Do you have another one of these?

1060
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:35,814
It doesn't matter.

1061
01:24:35,991 --> 01:24:38,960
What matters is that there is a bomb,
and I'm here to find it.

1062
01:24:39,127 --> 01:24:41,288
- How do you know this?
- I'd rather not say.

1063
01:24:41,463 --> 01:24:43,454
Max, there are millions of lives at stake.

1064
01:24:43,632 --> 01:24:46,829
If you have credible information
from a reliable source...

1065
01:24:47,002 --> 01:24:49,197
...I wanna know it,
and I wanna know it now.

1066
01:24:50,272 --> 01:24:53,139
I heard it from America's sweetheart,
Ryan Seacrest.

1067
01:24:53,308 --> 01:24:54,639
- Whoa.
Come on.

1068
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:56,402
It was a coded message.

1069
01:24:56,578 --> 01:24:59,945
Max, we're running out of time here.
What are you talking about?

1070
01:25:00,115 --> 01:25:03,949
I received a tip from a KAOS agent
who I befriended at the bakery.

1071
01:25:09,457 --> 01:25:11,220
I think we should trust him, Chief.

1072
01:25:11,393 --> 01:25:13,361
Absolutely, Chief.
I'm with 99 on that one.

1073
01:25:13,528 --> 01:25:16,326
Every time I look at Max's puppy eyes,
I'm a goner.

1074
01:25:16,498 --> 01:25:20,298
Oh, my God. You've really never
had anyone break up with you, have you?

1075
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:24,771
Chief, you said that you and I are alike.

1076
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:27,306
That we are both old-fashioned men.

1077
01:25:27,976 --> 01:25:30,103
Well, I have an old-fashioned hunch.

1078
01:25:30,278 --> 01:25:34,840
I have a hunch that you have a hunch
that I am telling the truth.

1079
01:25:35,951 --> 01:25:37,043
Max...

1080
01:25:38,486 --> 01:25:41,717
Any double agent who escapes
from a high-security holding situation...

1081
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:45,485
...only to fall into the arms of
the people that got him in the first place...

1082
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:49,460
...is either an idiot or not a double agent,
and I don't think you're an idiot.

1083
01:25:50,232 --> 01:25:51,256
Thank you, Chief.

1084
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:55,233
Now, we know that the president
is in town.

1085
01:25:55,403 --> 01:25:59,203
- But what exactly is he doing here today?
- Max.

1086
01:25:59,374 --> 01:26:03,674
- Yes. We need to find out his itinerary.
- But, Max, the...

1087
01:26:03,845 --> 01:26:06,575
I know, 99. I need to go get a paper.

1088
01:26:15,957 --> 01:26:17,481
We're in position. More or less.

1089
01:26:17,659 --> 01:26:20,594
Roger. I have the whole
security system online. Just remember...

1090
01:26:20,762 --> 01:26:24,528
Yes, we know.
How about a little radio silence?

1091
01:26:24,699 --> 01:26:28,699
I wanna quit, but what can I do?
He's married to my sister.

1092
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:33,330
By the way, I reviewed the security tapes
from the explosion at the bakery...

1093
01:26:33,508 --> 01:26:37,535
...and I know that you let those
CONTROL agents get away.

1094
01:26:37,712 --> 01:26:39,976
So unless you do your job today...

1095
01:26:40,148 --> 01:26:46,280
...your lovely wife, Zeenat,
will have eaten her last kebab.

1096
01:27:07,976 --> 01:27:11,878
<i>Blue team, check for access violation
at quadrant three, sector seven.</i>

1097
01:27:12,047 --> 01:27:13,071
Copy that.

1098
01:27:14,449 --> 01:27:15,609
Go.

1099
01:27:33,101 --> 01:27:34,796
That's it. You're there.

1100
01:28:06,568 --> 01:28:08,297
Door secure.

1101
01:28:40,835 --> 01:28:43,099
We need to get everyone out
and shut this place.

1102
01:28:43,271 --> 01:28:44,738
We've swept the building.

1103
01:28:44,906 --> 01:28:48,672
The Secret Service doesn't make mistakes
like the fabulous bakery boys.

1104
01:28:48,843 --> 01:28:50,777
Who told you about that? Who told you?

1105
01:28:50,945 --> 01:28:53,209
Take it easy.
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

1106
01:28:53,381 --> 01:28:56,009
And this day will not include
me blowing into your mouth.

1107
01:28:56,184 --> 01:28:59,176
- You want a piece of me?
- Come on, Chief! He's not worth it.

1108
01:28:59,354 --> 01:29:00,981
- Hey.
- I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

1109
01:29:01,156 --> 01:29:02,180
You better watch it.

1110
01:29:02,357 --> 01:29:03,847
Let me at him!

1111
01:29:13,268 --> 01:29:15,168
<i>From Los Angeles, California...</i>

1112
01:29:15,336 --> 01:29:16,254
<i>...we welcome you to a live broadcast...</i>

1113
01:29:16,289 --> 01:29:17,172
<i>...we welcome you to a live broadcast...</i>

1114
01:29:17,372 --> 01:29:19,363
<i>...of our concert for the president.</i>

1115
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:22,009
<i>Dignitaries from around the world
have gathered.</i>

1116
01:29:22,177 --> 01:29:26,614
<i>We will be broadcasting from the Walt
Disney Concert Hall throughout the evening.</i>

1117
01:29:26,781 --> 01:29:29,215
There has got to be another way in.

1118
01:29:29,384 --> 01:29:32,285
Why are we even still here?
There are 50 other perfect targets.

1119
01:29:32,454 --> 01:29:35,855
The Golden Gate Bridge, Space Needle.
There's no chatter to support this.

1120
01:29:36,024 --> 01:29:38,822
And you know what,
I'm done with this. Stop!

1121
01:29:38,993 --> 01:29:42,451
Wait a minute, 23.
You're radioactive hot.

1122
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:44,689
When were you exposed to radioactivity?

1123
01:29:44,866 --> 01:29:48,165
I just got back from Russia.
Half the people there are radioactive.

1124
01:29:48,336 --> 01:29:49,360
The bakery.

1125
01:29:49,537 --> 01:29:52,165
You said you swept the area
and everything was clean.

1126
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,740
- I did, and it was.
Really?

1127
01:29:54,909 --> 01:29:57,503
Was there anyone else there,
or do we just trust you?

1128
01:29:57,979 --> 01:29:59,003
23.

1129
01:30:00,181 --> 01:30:01,876
Your knife wound is seeping.

1130
01:30:02,484 --> 01:30:04,315
Sudden rise in blood pressure?

1131
01:30:04,486 --> 01:30:07,819
Perhaps you're nervous because
there is a bomb here and you know it.

1132
01:30:07,989 --> 01:30:11,447
And what is with the briefcase?
Could that actually be the football?

1133
01:30:11,626 --> 01:30:14,618
You mean the computer
containing the bomb activation codes?

1134
01:30:14,796 --> 01:30:18,664
Exactly. I have no interest in a real football
unless it is signed by Joe Montana...

1135
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:21,028
...and I don't believe that's the case.

1136
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:24,533
Well, 23?

1137
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,365
You know what? We're out of time.

1138
01:30:28,877 --> 01:30:30,936
You follow us, she dies.

1139
01:30:40,755 --> 01:30:42,450
Stop this car!

1140
01:30:42,857 --> 01:30:46,258
Max! You idiot!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1141
01:30:46,427 --> 01:30:49,760
You don't just slap your hands
on a government vehicle!

1142
01:30:51,299 --> 01:30:55,668
All right, that's it! When we get back
to Washington, you morons are through!

1143
01:30:58,806 --> 01:31:02,264
Damn it. How have you gotten
away with this for so long?

1144
01:31:02,443 --> 01:31:04,809
I can't believe none of us saw it,
especially me.

1145
01:31:04,979 --> 01:31:07,379
Don't beat yourself up.
You'll be dead soon anyway.

1146
01:31:09,918 --> 01:31:11,977
Chief, he's heading
southbound on Grand.

1147
01:31:12,153 --> 01:31:13,745
Thanks, Bruce. Keep us posted.

1148
01:31:14,389 --> 01:31:18,018
<i>Hey!
CONTROL assholes who just stole my vehicle!</i>

1149
01:31:18,193 --> 01:31:22,630
<i>I know you're listening! You two dickwads
put one scratch on that car...</i>

1150
01:31:23,831 --> 01:31:25,196
<i>What was that?</i>

1151
01:31:25,366 --> 01:31:27,129
Sorry, I'm losing you.

1152
01:31:27,902 --> 01:31:28,926
What the?

1153
01:31:30,405 --> 01:31:32,896
All right, fellas.
20 dollars if you hit the car.

1154
01:31:34,909 --> 01:31:38,743
Chief, I have to say,
this whole thing really steams my clams.

1155
01:31:38,913 --> 01:31:41,609
I cannot get over the fact
that 23 is a traitor.

1156
01:31:41,783 --> 01:31:43,182
Sand trap!

1157
01:31:43,351 --> 01:31:46,184
Now I know how you felt
when you thought I was a traitor.

1158
01:31:46,354 --> 01:31:47,616
Tractor!

1159
01:31:47,789 --> 01:31:50,656
I don't know how I missed it.
I'm usually very observant.

1160
01:31:50,825 --> 01:31:52,156
Swordfish!

1161
01:31:59,334 --> 01:32:01,734
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I don't know.

1162
01:32:01,903 --> 01:32:05,771
Were you thinking, "Holy shit, holy shit,
a swordfish almost went through my head?"

1163
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,464
If so, yes.

1164
01:32:07,642 --> 01:32:08,939
Come on.

1165
01:32:31,466 --> 01:32:35,027
On behalf of the United States Government,
I hereby commandeer this plane.

1166
01:32:35,937 --> 01:32:37,837
The device is armed.
I hope you're moving.

1167
01:32:38,006 --> 01:32:40,975
Don't worry, sir. I'll be well clear.

1168
01:32:45,446 --> 01:32:47,380
<i>Chief, they're headed
southbound on I-47.</i>

1169
01:32:47,548 --> 01:32:49,379
Thanks, Bruce. I got them!

1170
01:32:50,251 --> 01:32:51,980
I need to get down to that car!

1171
01:32:52,153 --> 01:32:55,645
No, no good. If I get too low,
he'll hear me coming!

1172
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:01,428
I have another idea.

1173
01:33:02,263 --> 01:33:03,924
What are you doing?

1174
01:33:06,434 --> 01:33:09,130
Get back in the plane!
You're gonna kill yourself!

1175
01:33:10,438 --> 01:33:11,735
Hang on!

1176
01:33:28,256 --> 01:33:29,848
Hang on! We're going in!

1177
01:33:34,629 --> 01:33:35,755
Sorry, Max.

1178
01:33:41,369 --> 01:33:44,031
Tuesday's not gonna work.
Cannot do Tuesday, I'm already...

1179
01:33:44,205 --> 01:33:46,173
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Sean! Sean! Sean!

1180
01:33:46,341 --> 01:33:48,366
See how annoying that is?

1181
01:34:08,696 --> 01:34:12,588
See, this is your problem.
Some men like women more feminine!

1182
01:34:12,767 --> 01:34:14,234
- I'm not feminine?
- No.

1183
01:34:14,402 --> 01:34:15,528
I'm not feminine?

1184
01:34:26,447 --> 01:34:28,005
Freeze!

1185
01:34:28,282 --> 01:34:29,977
That was so cool.

1186
01:34:30,885 --> 01:34:32,216
Max!

1187
01:34:40,728 --> 01:34:41,752
Damn it to hell.

1188
01:34:51,572 --> 01:34:53,699
You know, I might be more help
if you untie me!

1189
01:34:53,975 --> 01:34:56,341
There's a knife in my right front pocket!

1190
01:35:02,817 --> 01:35:04,045
Stop it! Stop it!

1191
01:35:04,519 --> 01:35:05,543
What?

1192
01:35:06,788 --> 01:35:09,382
That's not my knife! That's not my...

1193
01:35:09,924 --> 01:35:11,221
I got it!

1194
01:35:17,932 --> 01:35:19,593
No, 99, don't touch that!

1195
01:35:22,937 --> 01:35:24,427
Oh, my Lord.

1196
01:35:46,127 --> 01:35:48,220
Yeah! The kid's still got it.

1197
01:35:54,035 --> 01:35:55,059
Max, hurry!

1198
01:35:57,138 --> 01:35:58,901
Hold on, 99!

1199
01:36:04,946 --> 01:36:08,814
Chief, we can't stop the car! We have
the football, but we do not know the code!

1200
01:36:08,983 --> 01:36:10,450
We need to figure out something!

1201
01:36:10,618 --> 01:36:13,451
These tracks are taking us back downtown,
towards the bomb!

1202
01:36:17,892 --> 01:36:20,759
We gotta get you out of there,
and you won't survive the jump!

1203
01:36:20,928 --> 01:36:21,952
I'm coming to get you!

1204
01:36:46,988 --> 01:36:49,047
- Oh, God!
- Hold on, 99!

1205
01:36:50,525 --> 01:36:53,323
It's not over, Max!
I'll take that briefcase!

1206
01:36:53,494 --> 01:36:55,553
If you want it, you'll have to take it!

1207
01:36:55,997 --> 01:36:59,524
- That's what I just said!
- I know, I'm just trying to annoy you!

1208
01:37:48,282 --> 01:37:50,182
Unusual but effective.

1209
01:37:57,959 --> 01:37:59,859
- You all right?
- I'm fine!

1210
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:07,600
Max!

1211
01:38:08,336 --> 01:38:09,360
Max, your foot!

1212
01:38:15,309 --> 01:38:18,278
- I wish we had more time!
- What?

1213
01:38:38,633 --> 01:38:41,796
- Max!
- No!

1214
01:39:02,657 --> 01:39:04,124
Oh, Max.

1215
01:39:10,197 --> 01:39:11,687
No. No!

1216
01:39:17,338 --> 01:39:19,806
I wish we had more time too.

1217
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:24,307
So you did hear me?

1218
01:39:27,114 --> 01:39:28,138
Max?

1219
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:34,150
But the train...

1220
01:39:35,156 --> 01:39:37,351
Missed it by that much.

1221
01:39:56,677 --> 01:39:58,577
"Operation Joy"?

1222
01:40:00,081 --> 01:40:03,915
The "Ode to Joy" will end with a bang.

1223
01:40:08,989 --> 01:40:12,152
- Chief!
- Yeah, Maxie! Are you okay?

1224
01:40:12,326 --> 01:40:16,387
Listen, I think the final notes
of the "Ode to Joy" trigger the bomb!

1225
01:40:16,564 --> 01:40:18,361
We have to stop the concert!

1226
01:40:18,532 --> 01:40:19,829
I'm on it.

1227
01:40:56,337 --> 01:40:59,898
My buttocks are really stinging
from being dragged.

1228
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:11,584
Hey, grandpa, I already told you...

1229
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:15,516
Speak up, son.
I'm an old man, you know.

1230
01:41:26,767 --> 01:41:29,031
I like that tackling part.

1231
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:36,104
I am so, so sorry about that.

1232
01:41:36,277 --> 01:41:38,074
Wait! No, no, let him go.

1233
01:41:39,046 --> 01:41:41,139
- There is a bomb.
- Where?

1234
01:41:41,315 --> 01:41:44,307
Would you believe in the piano?

1235
01:41:49,623 --> 01:41:51,989
Whoa. How did we miss that?
That is huge.

1236
01:41:52,459 --> 01:41:56,953
- Max. Was that...?
- A total guess, yes, it was.

1237
01:42:05,739 --> 01:42:08,230
That old son of a gun
can take a hit, huh?

1238
01:42:15,583 --> 01:42:19,986
- Do you think I should tell him?
- No. Let's just savor the moment.

1239
01:42:28,662 --> 01:42:30,994
He's a funny son of a bitch, isn't he?

1240
01:42:31,699 --> 01:42:34,167
This is the proudest moment of my life!

1241
01:42:37,104 --> 01:42:38,662
Bomb not go off.

1242
01:42:38,839 --> 01:42:41,399
Oh, really, bright-eyes?
What alerted you?

1243
01:42:41,575 --> 01:42:44,703
Was it no "Boom, boom," or the lack
of a mushroom cloud?

1244
01:42:44,879 --> 01:42:47,575
It was the mushroom cloud for me.

1245
01:42:48,549 --> 01:42:53,418
Well, you did your job,
so I suppose I can't kill your wife.

1246
01:42:53,821 --> 01:42:57,416
Although to be honest,
I'd be doing the sighted world a favor.

1247
01:43:05,866 --> 01:43:08,164
What good hang time, huh?

1248
01:43:08,903 --> 01:43:12,134
Yes, Mr. President.
Thank you and goodbye, sir.

1249
01:43:12,339 --> 01:43:15,866
86, the President wanted me
to convey his personal thanks...

1250
01:43:16,043 --> 01:43:19,774
...and to tell you how impressed he was
with that dragged-by-a-train thing.

1251
01:43:19,947 --> 01:43:24,043
Well, sir, as an agent, I have trained
myself to be impervious to pain.

1252
01:43:25,452 --> 01:43:27,682
Ah! Hey, it's Fang.

1253
01:43:27,855 --> 01:43:30,517
I wanted him to be a surprise.

1254
01:43:30,691 --> 01:43:33,819
99, please, nobody here
knows that we're dating.

1255
01:43:33,994 --> 01:43:35,552
Yes, they do.

1256
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:38,127
On the cheek.

1257
01:43:39,233 --> 01:43:40,962
- Let's go.
- Maybe a little one?

1258
01:43:41,936 --> 01:43:45,838
Hey, new guy. Hold up a second.
Welcome to CONTROL.

1259
01:43:46,006 --> 01:43:49,237
We have a tradition called "pick on
the new guy. " Here's how it works.

1260
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:52,402
- We pick on the new guy.
- And you can't do anything about it.

1261
01:43:52,579 --> 01:43:53,944
Let's try one.

1262
01:43:54,782 --> 01:43:57,774
- You dropped your pencil.
- Did you hear the man?

1263
01:43:58,185 --> 01:44:01,450
I don't see a man, I see two little girls.

1264
01:44:01,622 --> 01:44:05,649
I think I'll call you Maureen,
and you Brittany.

1265
01:44:05,826 --> 01:44:09,159
- New guy did not.
- New guy did.

1266
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:11,321
Okay, new guy...
I got this.

1267
01:44:11,799 --> 01:44:13,289
And I'm going to enjoy it.

1268
01:44:13,467 --> 01:44:15,458
That will make me happy, Maureen.

1269
01:44:15,869 --> 01:44:16,893
Maureen.

1270
01:44:18,372 --> 01:44:19,634
Ow! What's in there?

1271
01:44:20,207 --> 01:44:22,038
- And just for the record.
- What's in there?

1272
01:44:23,610 --> 01:44:25,100
My name is not "new guy. "

1273
01:44:26,347 --> 01:44:27,712
My name is Hymie.

1274
01:44:27,881 --> 01:44:30,281
Now, if you ladies will excuse me.

1275
01:44:32,686 --> 01:44:34,449
This is gonna be so fun.

1276
01:44:34,621 --> 01:44:36,213
Make him high-five me.

1277
01:45:10,591 --> 01:45:11,819
Max, we're gonna be late.

1278
01:45:15,829 --> 01:45:18,491
Oh, Max. Let Maintenance
take care of it.

1279
01:45:22,636 --> 01:45:23,728
Ah!

1280
01:45:23,904 --> 01:45:25,838
<i>You've gotta be kidding me!</i>
