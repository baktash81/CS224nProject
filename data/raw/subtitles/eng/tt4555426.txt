1
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,585
Order!

2
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,462
Order! Order!

3
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,011
Mr. Speaker! Mr. Speaker!

4
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,144
Order!
The leader...

5
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,607
Order.

6
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,737
The leader of the Opposition,
Clement Attlee.

7
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,066
Mr. Speaker.

8
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,198
It seems that
I have not been clear enough.

9
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,746
Then let me leave no doubt

10
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,460
about my feelings regarding
Mr. Chamberlain's future

11
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,038
as prime minister.

12
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,373
All right, honorable gentlemen!

13
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,379
Give way! Give way!

14
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,922
Give way!

15
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:14,255
Owing to his years of inactivity

16
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,673
and incompetence,

17
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:20,182
we find him personally responsible...

18
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,642
personally responsible
for leaving this nation

19
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,069
ruinously unprepared
to face the present Nazi peril.

20
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:36,155
- Order! Order!
- Sit down!

21
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,040
Shame on you! Shame!

22
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,788
We are at war, Mr. Speaker...

23
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,380
at war. And leaving aside
whether he is fit

24
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:51,548
to be a leader in peacetime,
he has proved himself incapable

25
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,640
of leading us in wartime!

26
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,422
Sit down!

27
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,140
Order! Order!

28
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,433
I said, "Order!"

29
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,820
Therefore, in the national interest,

30
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,280
we, the Opposition,
are willing to enter into

31
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,992
a grand coalition
with the ruling Conservative Party...

32
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,204
so-called...

33
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,286
- Order! Order!
- but not...

34
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,992
and I stress never...
under the leadership

35
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,953
of Mr. Chamberlain, who has lost

36
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,714
the confidence of this House.

37
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,970
In the country's interest, man,

38
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,560
resign, step down,
and let us find a new leader.

39
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,187
Sit down. Shame on you.

40
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,475
- Shame.
- You've got some nerve!

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
Where's Winston?

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,780
Ensuring his fingerprints
are not on the murder weapon.

43
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,736
Order!

44
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,946
As the Opposition refuse

45
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,822
to join any government headed by me,

46
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,420
we must now select my successor,

47
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,376
someone with new strength

48
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,457
to form a coalition government.

49
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,338
I will step down tomorrow,

50
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:21,173
but, I did want my own party,

51
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,591
the gentlemen I most respect,

52
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,310
to know first.

53
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,271
Yeah.

54
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,353
- And it must be Halifax.
- Hear, hear.

55
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,650
There's no question.

56
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,153
- Our foreign secretary.
- Halifax.

57
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,656
Yeah, of course.

58
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,945
No contest. Halifax.

59
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,242
Thank you, gentlemen.

60
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,719
I appreciate your confidence in me.

61
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,623
However, my time has not yet come.

62
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,748
Then who?

63
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,625
But, on whomever the task may fall,

64
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:57,301
he shall be required
to explore every avenue.

65
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,891
Including that of diplomatic talks.

66
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:04,517
Indeed. Towards the restoration
of peace in Europe.

67
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,846
- Absolutely.
- Hear, hear.

68
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,892
Well, gentlemen,
there is only one candidate...

69
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,227
only one man
the Opposition will accept.

70
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,813
- Oh, no. Oh, surely not.
- God, has it come to that?

71
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,069
No, no, no.

72
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,121
No, this is totally absurd.

73
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,211
And if he stretches out his hand

74
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,551
and says, "Gimme,"

75
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,375
you need to anticipate what he wants.

76
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,381
Black pen, red pen, paper

77
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,543
or "clop"... that's his hole punch.

78
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,344
How selfish to resign, time like this.

79
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,529
Do you think they'll take me

80
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,173
to Downing Street if he gets the job?

81
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,633
Not after that spotted dick
you served last week, eh?

82
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,434
He mumbles, so it's almost impossible
to catch everything.

83
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,029
Be prepared to type fast...
short bursts and double-spaced.

84
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,446
He hates single-spaced.
Hates it.

85
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,319
Good luck.

86
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,557
To the French ambassador.

87
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,183
With German forces...

88
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,265
crossing into Holland...

89
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,686
Holland alone...

90
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,608
Come on. Telegram.

91
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,610
Holland alone...

92
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,198
requests reassurance

93
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,987
that French forces will now move...

94
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,078
No, move at once.

95
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,575
Into, to protect Belgium.

96
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,333
Stop.

97
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,005
French ambassador, sir.

98
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,462
Monsieur Ambassador.

99
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,053
Oh.

100
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:14,304
They've already invaded Belgium?

101
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,892
Holland and Belgium?

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,030
I will convey your plea
to the prime minister at once.

103
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:28,574
Yes. The situation is still very confused.

104
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,918
Yes.

105
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,957
Good-bye.

106
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,124
"To the French ambassador.

107
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,395
- With German..."
- No, scrap that.

108
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,509
New telegram.

109
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,388
To General Ismay.

110
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,175
In...

111
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,348
- What is it now?
- Your son.

112
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,804
Randolph, quickly.

113
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,858
No, last night, they said

114
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,724
I might be made prime minister today,

115
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,891
but that-that was yesterday.

116
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,900
Let's see what happens today.

117
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,312
Yeah? Let's see what,

118
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,231
let's see what Neville does today.

119
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,361
Yes.

120
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,871
Thank you, my boy.

121
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,492
Yes.

122
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,789
Yes. Keep buggering on.

123
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,259
Where, now...

124
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,587
"To General Ismay."

125
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,332
Ah, General Ismay.

126
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,963
Yeah. Sawyers.

127
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,060
Get rid of this, will you?

128
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,187
To General Ismay.

129
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,150
In light of today's events,

130
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:45,781
the time is ripe...

131
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,531
for many preparations to be...

132
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,615
Are you

133
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,581
striking those keys
in a normal fashion?

134
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,282
It's awfully loud. I can't...
I can't hear myself think.

135
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,583
Read it back.

136
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,505
"To General Ismay.

137
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,175
In the light of today's events,
the time is right..."

138
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,715
"Ripe"! Not "right"!

139
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,719
God's teeth, girl.

140
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,721
I said "ripe"!

141
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,223
Ripe! Ripe!

142
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,474
Last sentence.

143
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,396
"The time is ripe." Puh.

144
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,975
- For...
- "For..."

145
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,110
- For...
- "Man-Many, many, many..."

146
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,607
Many, many, many, many, many.

147
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,529
How many "many" s did you write,
you nincompoop?

148
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,528
One "many." For...

149
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,790
"For many preparations to be made."

150
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,370
Single-spaced. Single-spaced!

151
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,749
Were you not briefed, young lady?

152
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,040
Single-spaced!

153
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,993
Someone set it on single-space, and...

154
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,293
Then why did you persist?

155
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,756
- Well, I...
- Oh, goddamn! Tell...

156
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,377
Tell Evans to send me someone

157
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,044
who can get it right the first time!

158
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,423
Go on! Out!

159
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,387
"Right"!

160
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,933
He shouted at you.

161
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,780
- Did he shout at you?
- No.

162
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,487
- He can be an awful brute!
- I'm...

163
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,895
- I made too many mistakes.
- I think you were nervous,

164
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,628
and he has a knack
for drawing out the very worst

165
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,963
in those who are trying
to help him the most.

166
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,048
No, no, it's not... It's not him.

167
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,192
It's me. He's... he's...

168
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,401
He's a man, like any other.

169
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,325
Come on. What you doing?

170
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,742
Dearest.

171
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,880
The War Cabinet's been called.

172
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,008
- Bloody cat's under the bed again.
- My darling?

173
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,730
- Tango.
- May I tell you something

174
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,424
I feel you really ought to know?

175
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,555
I have noticed a recent
deterioration in your manner.

176
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,808
You're not as kind as you used to be.

177
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,095
You've become rough.

178
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,893
And sarcastic and overbearing and rude.

179
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,648
Oh, is this about the new girl?

180
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,501
If the king does ask you
to become prime minister...

181
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:50,855
We don't know that for sure.

182
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,363
I don't want you to be disliked.

183
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,325
More than I already am?

184
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:59,246
My darling, you are on the brink

185
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,116
of having tremendous power,

186
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,603
surpassed only by that of the king,

187
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,993
and with such power
you really must try and be more kind.

188
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,164
And, if possible, calm.

189
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:16,426
I want others to love
and respect you, as I do.

190
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,398
Telegram for Mr. Churchill.

191
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,029
Excuse me?

192
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,815
I'm not...

193
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,295
...troops have
destroyed all bridges

194
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,968
of the Isle and Meuse rivers.

195
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:57,048
This is the BBC Home Service.

196
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,890
Here is a short news bulletin.

197
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,980
The German army invaded

198
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:06,107
Holland and Belgium
early this morning, by land...

199
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,662
- There's a telegram.
- ...and by landings

200
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,106
from parachutes.

201
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,528
The armies of the Low Countries

202
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:12,947
are resisting.

203
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,275
An appeal for help has been made

204
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:16,871
to the Allied governments...

205
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,745
- It's from the Palace.
- ...and Brussels says

206
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:22,242
that Allied troops
are moving to their support.

207
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,742
A hundred war planes
were seen over Brussels,

208
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,710
and it is now reported

209
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,171
that in the first raid over Brussels,

210
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,871
several hundred people
were killed and wounded,

211
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,593
and several buildings destroyed.

212
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:41,015
Five minutes ago,

213
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,095
the Air Ministry announced

214
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,640
that in the early hours of this morning...

215
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,104
Thank you, Miss?

216
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,973
Layton.

217
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,814
- You're shaking.
- So are you.

218
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,321
You... you from excitement,
I from terror.

219
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,905
You've wanted this your entire adult life.

220
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,960
No. Since the nursery.
But do the public want me?

221
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,305
It's your own party to whom
you'll have to prove yourself.

222
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,589
I'm getting the job only
because the ship is sinking.

223
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,256
It-It's not a gift, it's revenge.

224
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,925
Let them see your true qualities,
your courage.

225
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,175
- My poor judgment.
- No, your lack of vanity.

226
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,257
- And my iron will.
- Your sense of humor.

227
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,672
Ho, ho, ho.

228
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,095
Now go.

229
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,560
- Go?
- Be...

230
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,690
Be what?

231
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,186
Be yourself.

232
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,184
Myself?

233
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,732
Which self should I

234
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,660
be today?

235
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,830
One should have had power
when a young man.

236
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,409
When wits were sharp.

237
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,954
Sinews strong.

238
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,378
Oh, well.

239
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:52,206
Lead on, Macduff.

240
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,258
When youth departs,

241
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,173
may wisdom prove enough.

242
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,478
Hardly seems like there's a war on at all.

243
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:57,066
Do you know I've never ridden a bus?

244
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,068
Sir?

245
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,410
I've never queued for bread.

246
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,278
I believe I can boil an egg.

247
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,826
But only because I've seen it done.

248
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,915
The only time I tried
riding the Underground

249
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,836
was during the General Strike.

250
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,125
Clemmie dropped me off
at South Kensington station.

251
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,470
I went down but got lost.

252
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,176
I came straight back up!

253
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:24,887
It was awful.

254
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,177
Why not Halifax? I favor Halifax.

255
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,593
I wanted Halifax.

256
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:32,765
The Lords wanted Halifax.

257
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:36,145
Perhaps, Halifax wanted Halifax.

258
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,817
Then why have I been forced
to send for Churchill?

259
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,817
Because he is the only
member of our party

260
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,861
who has the support of the Opposition.

261
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,325
His record is a litany of catastrophe.

262
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,576
Gallipoli, 25,000 dead,

263
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,250
the India policy, the Russian Civil War,

264
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,918
the Gold Standard,

265
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,418
the abdication
and now this Norway adventure.

266
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,963
What's that, 1,800 men?

267
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,547
One aircraft carrier, two cruisers,

268
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,842
seven destroyers and a submarine.

269
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:11,386
- Winston lacks judgment.
- He was right about Hitler.

270
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:14,302
Well, even a stopped clock
is right twice a day.

271
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,355
First Lord of the Admiralty,
Mr. Winston Churchill.

272
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,490
Early.

273
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:23,733
Keen.

274
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,861
I accept your resignation,

275
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,114
but I want you to know how...

276
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,994
cruelly I think you've been treated.

277
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,088
Thank you, Your Majesty.

278
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:44,712
Oh, this way, My Lord.

279
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,505
Your Majesty.

280
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,836
Mr. Churchill.

281
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,505
I believe you know

282
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,885
why I have asked you here today.

283
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,640
Sir, I simply cannot imagine why.

284
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,027
It is my duty to invite you

285
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,525
to take up the position of prime minister

286
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,487
of this United Kingdom.

287
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,981
Will you form a government?

288
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,200
I will.

289
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,738
Very well.

290
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,756
Well, that was quite easy.

291
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,464
Yes, it was.

292
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:22,185
I believe we are to meet regularly.

293
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:24,522
Once a week, I'm afraid.

294
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,645
How is...

295
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,358
How are you for Mondays?

296
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,697
I shall endeavor to be available

297
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,580
- on Mondays.
- 4:00?

298
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,326
I nap at 4:00.

299
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,328
Is that permissible?

300
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,492
No. But necessary.

301
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:43,701
I work late.

302
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,801
Then perhaps lunchtime.

303
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,508
Lunch?

304
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,510
Mondays?

305
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,005
Your Majesty.

306
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:56,344
Prime Minister.

307
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,880
- Can we get any closer?
- Mr. Churchill!

308
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,254
Good evening, gentlemen.

309
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,729
Mr. Churchill, welcome to Number Ten.

310
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,043
Thank you, sir.

311
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,840
Mr. Churchill, what's your agenda?

312
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:36,463
The agenda? A glass of Pol Roger.

313
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,342
- Cheers.
- Over here, sir!

314
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:39,809
You'll-you'll have your pictures.

315
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,188
Prime Minister.

316
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,475
Anthony.

317
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,308
How is the king?

318
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,763
Anxious.

319
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,436
He's never forgiven me for supporting

320
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:52,987
his brother's marriage to Wallis Simpson.

321
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,028
You only have to meet him once a week.

322
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,112
Oh, but that's like saying
you only have to have

323
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,247
your tooth pulled once a week.

324
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,204
Composition of your War Cabinet.

325
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,916
Who should sit on it?

326
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,126
Yeah.

327
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,415
Chamberlain, of course.

328
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:11,462
The Reverend Holy Fox.

329
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,180
Halifax.

330
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:15,848
Keeping your enemies close?

331
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,504
Oh, more than that.

332
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,676
Without them, the party
will have rid of me.

333
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:23,883
Oh, and that sheep
in sheep's clothing, Attlee.

334
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,765
Come on, Daddy. Everyone's waiting.

335
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:29,682
Yes, I'll be there in a jiffy, my love.

336
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,897
I heard that before you were asked,

337
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,563
they offered it to Lord Halifax.

338
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,021
Oh, I doubt that.

339
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,990
Halifax would never turn it down.

340
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,653
He's the fourth son of an earl.

341
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,532
Fourth sons turn nothing down.

342
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:48,461
I wish the position had come
your way in better times, sir.

343
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,477
You have an enormous task ahead of you.

344
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,833
I only hope it's not too late.

345
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,760
I'm very much afraid it is.

346
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:00,302
But we can only do our best, hmm?

347
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,561
- Hip hip!
- Hurray!

348
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:04,809
Oh, heavens!

349
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,810
What a frightful sight.

350
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,932
- A toast.
- Yes, a speech.

351
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,061
- Yes.
- Mama.

352
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:13,858
Yes.

353
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:16,161
My darling husband.

354
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:19,275
Some of you may not know that on the eve

355
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,613
of our marriage, I got cold feet.

356
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:24,499
But as I'd already
called off two engagements

357
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,336
by the age of 21
and was in danger of gaining

358
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,710
a reputation for being a bolter

359
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,288
it would have been poor form

360
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,123
- to call off a third.
- Hear, hear.

361
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,548
Lucky for Daddy.

362
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,876
But the real reason for my wintery feet

363
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,632
was that I knew, even then,

364
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:40,467
that his priority would be public life.

365
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,363
But it worried a young girl greatly,

366
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:45,807
this wretched thought
of eternally coming second.

367
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:48,092
But so it has proven to be.

368
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,762
And in due course, our children
would have to make their peace

369
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,224
with this same fact.

370
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,446
We all did, you see.

371
00:21:58,027 --> 00:21:59,367
In our own way.

372
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:07,451
And now, today,
we are to receive our reward.

373
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:10,624
Proof that our small sacrifice

374
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,876
was for a far, far greater good.

375
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,461
I give you your father,

376
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:21,429
my beloved husband, the Prime Minister.

377
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:23,633
The Prime Minister.

378
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,808
Here's to,

379
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:30,894
to not buggering it up.

380
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,896
To not buggering it up.

381
00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:36,185
Belgium was a ploy.

382
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,360
They punched through
the Ardennes into France.

383
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:42,403
Crossed the Meuse River in under 24 hours.

384
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,408
No one can cross the Meuse in 24 hours.

385
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,910
Well, apparently the Germans can.

386
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,281
Look to Chamberlain's handkerchief.

387
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,031
If he waves it
at the end of Churchill's speech,

388
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:26,534
we show approval.

389
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:30,498
If not, keep quiet.

390
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,628
The Prime Minister.

391
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:45,463
Here we go.

392
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,845
Mr. Speaker,

393
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:53,768
on Friday evening last,

394
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,269
I received His Majesty's commission

395
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:00,184
to form a new administration.

396
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,487
It was the evident wish and will

397
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,580
of Parliament and the nation

398
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:12,866
that this should be conceived
on the broadest possible basis.

399
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,703
And that it should include all parties.

400
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,249
Hear, hear.

401
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,547
A War Cabinet has been convened.

402
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:25,388
No. Correction.

403
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,346
Has been formed.

404
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,261
"Formed."

405
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:34,901
A War Cabinet has been formed
of five members

406
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:38,315
representing, with the Opposition parties,

407
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,606
the unity of the nation.

408
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:44,482
Read.

409
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,338
"The three
party leaders have agreed

410
00:24:46,362 --> 00:24:48,112
"to serve either in the War Cabinet

411
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:50,787
"or in high executive office."

412
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:53,826
With this agreement in place,

413
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:56,081
I now invite the House

414
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:59,833
by the resolution which
stands in my name...

415
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,260
...to record its approval

416
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:07,084
and to declare its confidence

417
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:08,504
in the new government.

418
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,850
Miss?

419
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,479
I'm coming out in a state of nature.

420
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:24,485
It must be remembered

421
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,944
that we are in the preliminary stage

422
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:31,788
of one of the greatest battles in history.

423
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:36,791
And that many preparations
have to be made here at home.

424
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,250
Hear, hear.

425
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,710
Sir, I take up my task

426
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,801
with a buoyancy and hope,

427
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:47,711
and say to the House, as I have said

428
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,678
to those who have joined the government,

429
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:53,175
I have nothing to offer

430
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:57,897
but blood, toil, tears and sweat.

431
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:04,490
We have before us an ordeal
of the most grievous kind.

432
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,739
We have before us many, many long months

433
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:11,449
of struggle and of suffering.

434
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:15,284
You ask, "What is our policy?"

435
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:18,785
I say it is to wage war

436
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:22,501
by sea, land and air

437
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,333
with all our might

438
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:28,963
and with all the strength
that God can give us.

439
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:35,421
To wage war against a monstrous tyranny

440
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:39,016
never surpassed
in the dark and lamentable catalog

441
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,649
of human crime.

442
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:44,146
That is our policy.

443
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:47,645
Oh, you ask, "What is our aim?"

444
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,409
I can answer in one word.

445
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,160
Victory.

446
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,699
Victory at all costs.

447
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,539
Victory, in spite of all terror.

448
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:05,631
Victory, however long and hard
the road may be.

449
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,720
For without victory,

450
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:12,381
there can be no survival.

451
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:29,857
What's he doing?

452
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:40,041
Contempt.

453
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,456
We have to start somewhere.

454
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,704
Snap.

455
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:56,382
"Our policy is to wage war.

456
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,302
"At all costs.

457
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,057
"No survival."

458
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:01,349
Good God, he's incapable

459
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:04,052
of even pronouncing the word "peace,"

460
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,649
let alone entering into negotiations.

461
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,990
Awful, the thought that I shall never see

462
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:11,985
my country at peace again.

463
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:16,902
I have cancer.

464
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:23,076
Oh, Neville.

465
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,297
Winston must be removed from office.

466
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,678
If we can get him
to declare that he refuses

467
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:36,256
to even consider peace
negotiations with Germany,

468
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:39,262
you and I would perhaps
have clear grounds to resign.

469
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:42,726
That would force
a vote of no confidence.

470
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,646
The party couldn't countenance that.

471
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,475
You're the chairman, for heaven's sake.

472
00:28:47,478 --> 00:28:48,518
He'd be finished.

473
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:51,234
And you would agree to be prime minister.

474
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:53,392
Well...

475
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,861
with Winston out of the way,
who can say?

476
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,195
But the important thing, Neville,

477
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:02,741
is that your policies
would be back on the table.

478
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:05,416
Peace and the protection of our nation.

479
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:06,916
On record.

480
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,337
I beg your pardon.

481
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,585
He must declare, on record,

482
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:13,047
his refusal to engage in peace talks.

483
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,545
We must have it in writing.

484
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,584
Thank you.

485
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,097
- Miss Layton.
- Morning.

486
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:01,557
Follow me.

487
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,320
Morning.

488
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,950
Thank you, sir.

489
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:20,658
Thank you, ma'am.

490
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,370
What goes on down here?

491
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,370
That's need-to-know, and you don't.

492
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:29,823
- The lavatory?
- For the PM's use only.

493
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:31,919
Sleeping quarters,

494
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,999
for when you miss the last train.

495
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:36,721
Ma'am.

496
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,969
That's the Map Room.

497
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:43,922
- No women allowed.
- What department's this?

498
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:46,181
Indiscretion in conversation
or any other form,

499
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,283
within or without these rooms
regarding what happens here,

500
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:50,937
is a statutory offense punishable by up to

501
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:53,358
two years imprisonment with hard labor.

502
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,281
Clear?

503
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:56,526
Crystal.

504
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:57,647
Good.

505
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:00,738
That's the War Cabinet room.

506
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:02,313
Never.

507
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:06,831
I don't mean to be rough on you, but

508
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:09,039
them's the rules.

509
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:12,421
This is the typists' pool.

510
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,669
- Good morning, sir.
- Ladies.

511
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,010
And here's you.

512
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:28,264
Belgium and Holland may fall at any hour.

513
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,727
And the French?

514
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:31,227
The entire French Ninth Army,

515
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:33,898
some 200,000 men, have capitulated.

516
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:35,603
All of them?

517
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:36,858
Capitulated.

518
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:38,859
Deserted. It was a rout.

519
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:41,821
All our land forces,
roughly 300,000 men,

520
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,232
are now in full retreat.

521
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:45,776
Air cover? For our troops?

522
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,744
The Luftwaffe control the skies.

523
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:50,285
We simply don't have enough
planes to challenge them.

524
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:52,579
In fact, I strongly
recommend we stop sending

525
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:55,533
our precious fighter planes
to be wasted in France.

526
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:57,454
Save them for our own defense.

527
00:31:57,668 --> 00:32:00,508
And our navy sits idle,

528
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,757
neutralized, useless.

529
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,300
Our fleets no sooner
come within their range

530
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,344
than we come under blistering air attack.

531
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:11,478
Well, their speed is devastating.

532
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:14,807
Panzer tanks moving rapidly westward
through the center.

533
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:18,973
Well, they will have to pause
for fuel supplies.

534
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,644
This is not the last war, sir.

535
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:23,653
Their tanks can stop for fuel
at a petrol station.

536
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,322
Petrol station?

537
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,905
The road to Paris now lies open.

538
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,331
Seven million refugees are on the move.

539
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,741
Collectively, we are looking
at the collapse

540
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,130
of Western Europe in the next few days.

541
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,587
Should the public be told?

542
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,253
Not yet.

543
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,640
First, we must rouse our old friends

544
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:53,311
to a heroic resistance.

545
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:57,108
France must be saved.

546
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,754
Premier.

547
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:32,984
Perhaps, in English, Prime Minister.

548
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:34,617
Well...

549
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,210
We have survived crises before,

550
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:43,128
and I am... I am confident
we will survive this one.

551
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,588
Tell me how you plan to counter-attack.

552
00:34:48,464 --> 00:34:49,754
There is no plan.

553
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,678
Well...

554
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:55,712
Well, you must counter-attack.

555
00:34:56,347 --> 00:34:58,347
Well, you must.

556
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:10,907
I do not
believe that this,

557
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,538
Panzer breakthrough is a real invasion.

558
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,575
Not a real invasion?

559
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,918
No. As long as their tank crews
are not supported

560
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:22,785
by infantry units, they are

561
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:26,915
merely little flags stuck on a map.

562
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:30,332
Because the tank crews
cannot support themselves.

563
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,592
No. I refuse to see,

564
00:35:32,675 --> 00:35:35,965
in this spectacular raid
of the German tank,

565
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,171
a real invasion.

566
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:52,161
He's an actor,

567
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,366
in love with the sound of his own voice.

568
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:56,486
I love to listen to him.

569
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:59,039
But we must never take his advice.

570
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:01,361
Has a hundred ideas a day.

571
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:02,913
Four of them are good,

572
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,248
the other 96 downright dangerous.

573
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:09,252
His father was the same.
Great orator, but...

574
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,126
Until he lost his mind to syphilis.

575
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:14,637
How nations suffer
for the sins of their fathers.

576
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:15,927
My opinion?

577
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,560
At this critical juncture for the empire,

578
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:22,181
we have a drunkard at the wheel.

579
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:24,648
Wakes with a scotch,

580
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:27,645
bottle of champagne for lunch,

581
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,320
another one at dinner.

582
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:32,949
Brandy and port until the wee hours.

583
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:35,864
I wouldn't let him borrow my bicycle.

584
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:38,786
He's a Conservative
who defects to the Liberals,

585
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:41,406
lobs grenades at us for ten years,

586
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:45,123
then flops Conservative again
as it bloody suits him.

587
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:48,335
Sorry, but he stands for one thing.

588
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,670
Himself.

589
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,839
We may have to replace him, Bertie.

590
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:55,588
Replace him?

591
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,096
We must strive for peace

592
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:00,765
so that every
son and daughter of this land

593
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:02,426
can emerge from this crisis

594
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,724
with something recognizable as home.

595
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,768
Spoken like a true prime minister.

596
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,081
"V for Victory."

597
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:30,378
You need to reply to the Lord Privy Seal.

598
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:37,632
Tell the Lord Privy Seal
I am sealed in the privy.

599
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,962
And I can only deal
with one shit at a time.

600
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:53,311
The broadcast is tonight,
so don't spare me, Anthony.

601
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:54,951
Be frank.

602
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:04,862
I don't think so.

603
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:07,112
You don't think so what?

604
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,663
You're suggesting we're somehow winning.

605
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:11,332
We're not.

606
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:15,797
No, but it will inspire them.

607
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,336
- Winston, I know...
- Anthony, Anthony.

608
00:38:18,424 --> 00:38:21,804
I am going to imbue them with a...

609
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:26,055
a spirit of feeling
they don't yet know they have.

610
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,480
You asked my opinion.

611
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:30,434
I caution against it.

612
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,980
Cicero.

613
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:38,235
Cicero!

614
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:44,951
"If fortune is adverse..." something,

615
00:38:45,034 --> 00:38:47,364
something, something.

616
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,373
Well...

617
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:57,967
Well, it's not there. I left it there.

618
00:38:58,047 --> 00:38:59,637
Clemmie!

619
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,547
Cat!

620
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:02,803
Clemmie!

621
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:04,095
We cannot pay our bills.

622
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:06,768
My copy of Cicero.

623
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,616
- Did-did you shelve it?
- Did you hear what I said?

624
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,980
- What was that?
- We're broke.

625
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,722
Oh, um... Out! Out.

626
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,562
Come on. Everybody out.

627
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,277
I dare not write another check.

628
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,156
Well, I'll economize.

629
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:23,903
Only four cigars a day.

630
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:25,869
You are insufferable!

631
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,419
Is there anything else?

632
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,412
Yes.

633
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:34,629
My love for you.

634
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:37,304
How much have you had
to drink this morning?

635
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:41,044
I see you now

636
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,045
as I first saw you

637
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:46,929
in 1904.

638
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,432
And I simply stood, speechless.

639
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:50,995
Well, I must have been very beautiful

640
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,438
to achieve that miraculous effect.

641
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:55,188
Four years until we saw each other again.

642
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,480
Went by in an absolute flash.

643
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:58,433
You didn't lack for admirers.

644
00:39:58,524 --> 00:40:02,654
Your fidele serviteur in Sidney Peel.

645
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:04,526
- Brilliant man.
- Lionel Earle.

646
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:06,573
Wonderful dancer.

647
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:10,361
And then at
Lady St. Helier's dinner party.

648
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:12,578
Who should show up?

649
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:14,877
Pig.

650
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:18,668
Just the same.

651
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,225
Are we terribly old?

652
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:33,519
Yes, I'm afraid you are.

653
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:35,724
Oh, you beast.

654
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,901
Oh, you...

655
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:43,277
Would you hear me read my speech

656
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,990
for tonight's broadcast?

657
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,323
Prime Minister.

658
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,883
Prime Minister, the situation in France.

659
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,117
Is it true we're in full retreat?

660
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:52,821
Is France lost?

661
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:02,714
"The Spanish ships I cannot see,

662
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:04,466
"for they are out of sight."

663
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,137
If you will sit here

664
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:09,598
at your desk.

665
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,850
And speak slowly and clearly.

666
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:16,227
Into the microphone.

667
00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:18,071
So...

668
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:21,812
if you're ready, on the stroke of 9:00,

669
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,649
the red light will come on,

670
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:25,814
and we shall go live to the nation.

671
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:30,322
9:00, red light...

672
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,158
you begin.

673
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,573
Yes?

674
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:36,537
One moment.

675
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:46,542
Prime Minister, are we ready?

676
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:50,212
One moment, one moment.

677
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:57,931
We are going live...

678
00:41:58,018 --> 00:41:59,568
One moment, damn you!

679
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:09,772
And four, three,

680
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:12,117
two, one.

681
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,936
I speak to you for the first time

682
00:42:36,015 --> 00:42:37,845
as prime minister

683
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:42,977
in a solemn hour
for the life of our country,

684
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:47,396
of our empire, of our allies

685
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:51,777
and, above all, of the cause of freedom.

686
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:54,865
A tremendous battle

687
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:58,620
is raging in France and Flanders.

688
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:03,995
The Germans, by a remarkable combination

689
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:08,465
of air bombing and heavily armored tanks,

690
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:11,923
have broken through the French defenses

691
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,889
north of the Maginot Line

692
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,639
and strong columns

693
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,092
of their armored vehicles

694
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:21,052
are ravaging the open country...

695
00:43:22,353 --> 00:43:24,273
...which, for the first day or two,

696
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,436
was without defenders.

697
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:32,863
However, I have invincible confidence

698
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,910
in the French Army and its leaders.

699
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:40,112
Only a very small part
of that splendid army

700
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,584
has yet been heavily engaged,

701
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:48,124
and only a very small part
of France has yet been invaded.

702
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,089
Side by side,

703
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:54,431
the British and French peoples
have advanced.

704
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,640
- "Advanced"?
- To rescue not only Europe.

705
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:00,801
- How bloody dare he.
- But mankind

706
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:05,561
from the foulest and most
soul-destroying tyranny

707
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:08,189
which has ever darkened

708
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:11,103
and stained the pages of history.

709
00:44:11,694 --> 00:44:15,364
But now one bond unites us all.

710
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:20,328
To wage war until victory is won,

711
00:44:20,411 --> 00:44:23,461
and never to surrender ourselves

712
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:27,211
to servitude and shame.

713
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:28,872
Whatever the cost

714
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,122
and the agony may be,

715
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,300
conquer we must,

716
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:38,768
as conquer we shall.

717
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:46,769
Well done, sir.

718
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:56,469
Oh! I thought you did marvelously.

719
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:58,636
The last ten years,

720
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:01,057
I was the only one
who told them the truth.

721
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:03,137
Until tonight.

722
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:06,438
There is no advance.

723
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:10,399
It's a shambles.

724
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,528
We're in full retreat.

725
00:46:15,693 --> 00:46:17,193
But would you be serving them tonight

726
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,867
by denying them their sleep

727
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:20,826
and terrifying their children?

728
00:46:21,323 --> 00:46:23,193
What, even if the terror is coming?

729
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:25,073
Because the terror is coming.

730
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:28,747
There's time enough for the truth.

731
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:40,387
Have you seen this?

732
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:46,348
What's so funny?

733
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:49,805
Prime Minister. Sir.

734
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:51,143
Yes, what is it?

735
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:53,978
Perhaps...

736
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:58,856
Look, I'm...

737
00:46:58,944 --> 00:47:01,194
I'm not sure if you know this, but,

738
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:04,402
but the way you're doing
your "V for Victory" sign...

739
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,330
Well, in the poorer quarters,

740
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,130
that gesture means something else.

741
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:11,665
What does it mean?

742
00:47:11,749 --> 00:47:13,209
Well, I wouldn't like to say, sir.

743
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,582
I was captured by the Boer.

744
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,129
I spent time in a South African prison.

745
00:47:18,756 --> 00:47:19,796
Up your bum.

746
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,215
Sir.

747
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:24,596
Up your bum?

748
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:26,302
Up your...

749
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:31,854
The way you're doing it, sir, yes, sir.

750
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,528
But if you turn it around, that's fine.

751
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:39,071
I wouldn't like millions of people

752
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:40,321
to take it the wrong way.

753
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:41,772
Indeed.

754
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:43,864
- Sir.
- Sir.

755
00:47:44,782 --> 00:47:48,072
And up your bum!

756
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:49,282
Your Majesty.

757
00:47:49,787 --> 00:47:51,997
Don't want to take
too much of your time.

758
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:54,543
I heard you on the wireless.

759
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,419
Was I comprehensible?

760
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:02,382
The public need to be led, not misled.

761
00:48:02,466 --> 00:48:05,176
Not left to work it out for themselves.

762
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,182
Right.

763
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:12,557
Will that be all, Your Majesty?

764
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:13,810
Yes.

765
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:15,314
Good day, Prime Minister.

766
00:48:15,396 --> 00:48:16,606
Good day.

767
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:24,329
I believe I have just received
a royal rap on the knuckles.

768
00:48:30,828 --> 00:48:32,538
As of 20:00 hours last night,

769
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:35,991
the Germans have encircled 60 British,

770
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,163
Belgian and French divisions.

771
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:43,138
On our part, all our forces
under Lord Gort have withdrawn

772
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:46,175
or are trying to withdraw
to the French coast, to Dunkirk,

773
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,310
where we cannot reach them.

774
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:50,017
How many of our men are trapped?

775
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:51,477
All of them.

776
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:54,432
Our country's entire
professional soldiery.

777
00:48:54,852 --> 00:48:57,222
And we can see no clear way
to rescue them.

778
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:03,404
General, are you telling me

779
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:07,535
that we shall have lost
the entire British Army

780
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,154
by the next few days?

781
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:11,249
That's correct.

782
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:15,324
The German force
is superior in every regard

783
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:17,374
and only 50 miles from the coast.

784
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:19,668
They are pushing us into the sea.

785
00:49:19,752 --> 00:49:23,122
No, the Germans must not reach the sea.

786
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:27,009
Not before we evacuate our men.

787
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:29,002
Ismay, what have you got for us?

788
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:30,424
As it stands, I cannot see

789
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:34,222
we have much hope of getting
any of our forces out in time.

790
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:37,473
Not a man?

791
00:49:38,937 --> 00:49:41,607
Well, we... Well, we cannot be so

792
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:43,357
totally at their mercy.

793
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:44,982
What's our next step?

794
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:47,151
Anyone?

795
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:49,328
Come on, speak!

796
00:49:52,493 --> 00:49:53,887
We still have a garrison at Calais.

797
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:55,171
25 miles to the west.

798
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:56,825
Well, how many men do we have there?

799
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:58,244
4,000, more or less.

800
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:03,379
Then why... Why didn't you say so?

801
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:07,751
Yes. Then we... We have them go east,

802
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:10,211
engage with the German columns
moving on Dunkirk,

803
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:11,462
buy us some time.

804
00:50:11,553 --> 00:50:14,133
Draw the... the Nazi focus

805
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:17,053
away from Dunkirk whilst we execute a...

806
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:19,512
a maritime evacuation of our forces.

807
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:21,063
Is that possible?

808
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:22,526
It would mean a huge sacrifice.

809
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:24,526
4,000 young men.

810
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:27,568
To save 300,000.

811
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:30,273
Under whose command
is the Calais garrison?

812
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:31,734
Brigadier Nicholson.

813
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:33,074
Very well.

814
00:50:34,702 --> 00:50:36,572
Tell Nicholson it is
of the greatest importance

815
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:38,372
to this island that...

816
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:41,545
that his garrison draw the enemy's tanks

817
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,835
and artillery and bombers
away from Dunkirk.

818
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:46,089
Invite their wrath, and...

819
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,350
Well, and to fight on

820
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,136
if needs be.

821
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:59,558
If needs be,
until the destruction of his command.

822
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,941
It's suicide.

823
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:19,453
Prime Minister, I have reservations.

824
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,630
Well, who is free of reservations?

825
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,913
About unnecessary sacrifice,

826
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:26,967
when there is an available alternative.

827
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:29,929
What alternative?

828
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:32,806
Italy has offered to mediate peace talks

829
00:51:33,344 --> 00:51:34,764
between ourselves and Germany.

830
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:36,095
I already indicated that,

831
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,532
provided the liberty and independence

832
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:39,136
of the British Empire was assured,

833
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:41,645
we would consider any proposal.

834
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:46,487
With, with Hitler holding the whip hand.

835
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:48,195
Do you really think he would honor

836
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:49,485
our liberty and independence?

837
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,910
It would be in his interest to do so, sir.

838
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:54,409
- Because the British Empire...
- The only thing to do

839
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:57,410
is to show that maniac

840
00:51:57,493 --> 00:51:59,533
that he cannot conquer this island,

841
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,250
and for that we need an army.

842
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,640
General, tell Brigadier Nicholson

843
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:04,124
the Germans must not reach the sea.

844
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:07,088
Not before we-we get our boys

845
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:09,219
off of that bloody beach!

846
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:11,086
I take full responsibility.

847
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:12,423
Really?

848
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,428
Really! Yes, sir.

849
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,890
It is the reason

850
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:18,389
I sit in this chair!

851
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,150
Well, surely, before you take

852
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,897
full responsibility
for the deaths of 4,000 men,

853
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:29,279
you'd wish to consider
every available avenue.

854
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:34,025
What is this?

855
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:38,369
What is your mind
on the principle of peace talks, sir?

856
00:52:42,204 --> 00:52:45,334
Do we take it, for example,
that you preclude yourself

857
00:52:45,416 --> 00:52:48,956
from even considering
taking part in such negotiations?

858
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:12,606
I should like to speak to Viscount Halifax

859
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:14,523
and Mr. Chamberlain.

860
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:16,487
Alone.

861
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:20,152
Issue the order to the Calais garrison.

862
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:22,746
Confirm it has been done.

863
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:24,493
Dismissed.

864
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:27,913
Now, you two come on.

865
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,210
Out.

866
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:32,335
Bridges!

867
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:34,051
You come on, hop it!

868
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:35,641
Out. Out!

869
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:45,825
Winston,

870
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,499
we are facing certain defeat on land,

871
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:54,215
the annihilation of our army,
and imminent invasion.

872
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:56,795
We must be rational.

873
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,720
We are a seagoing nation.

874
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,020
Have been since the Bronze Age.

875
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:05,596
The Channel is ours.

876
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:08,561
It's our moat, our battlement,

877
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:11,262
and the German doesn't
recognize an expanse of water

878
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:13,273
greater than a bloody lake.

879
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:16,947
They have first to reach
this island, Edward.

880
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:18,696
Where men, women and children,

881
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:20,777
whom we will have failed despicably

882
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:22,823
in our duty of protection, will be

883
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:24,926
- entirely defenseless...
- And whose fault is that?

884
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,920
...against the largest army
the world has ever seen.

885
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:29,625
Furthermore, once France falls,

886
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:32,495
Germany can concentrate
on aircraft production.

887
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,953
They will then have
the French fleet as well.

888
00:55:35,044 --> 00:55:37,504
What is to stop
Herr Hitler then, Winston?

889
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:40,968
Words, words, words alone.

890
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:45,096
If you will not permit any talk of peace,

891
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:46,389
then I shall be forced...

892
00:55:46,472 --> 00:55:48,262
Might we not allow Edward

893
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:52,109
simply to meet the
Italian Ambassador Bastianini,

894
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:54,436
discuss a possible role

895
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:57,851
as mediators between us and Germany,

896
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:00,524
and find out their price?

897
00:56:17,378 --> 00:56:18,468
Sir.

898
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:41,356
- Mr. President.
- Winston.

899
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:43,113
Franklin.

900
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,540
- How are you?
- Fine. Fine.

901
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:48,285
How are you, Prime Minister?

902
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,407
Oh, I'm in fine fettle.

903
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:51,666
Fine fettle.

904
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:53,625
Listen.

905
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:58,794
I'm, telephoning about your navy ships.

906
00:56:58,877 --> 00:57:01,337
If you could loan us just,

907
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:04,759
50 older destroyers.

908
00:57:04,842 --> 00:57:08,012
- Ah, yes.
- Or even 40 would do.

909
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:10,307
Well, I,

910
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:12,229
I did ask around,

911
00:57:12,725 --> 00:57:15,855
but just not possible, I'm afraid.

912
00:57:16,145 --> 00:57:20,815
The Neutrality Act we signed
last year has tied my hands.

913
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:22,489
Just can't swing it.

914
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,950
I tried.

915
00:57:24,028 --> 00:57:25,738
Well, can I...

916
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:31,578
Do I have your permission

917
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,330
to send an aircraft carrier

918
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:36,333
to pick up the P-40 fighter planes

919
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:37,835
we purchased from you?

920
00:57:41,754 --> 00:57:43,334
Mr. President?

921
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:46,301
Well, you've got me there again.

922
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:48,923
New law preventing transshipment

923
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:50,851
of military equipment.

924
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:53,099
But we paid for them.

925
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,980
We paid for them with the money that we...

926
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,770
that we borrowed from you.

927
00:57:57,978 --> 00:58:01,108
I'm so, so sorry, Winston.

928
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:08,867
I need not impress upon you the...

929
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:13,781
the trouble faced
by the Western Hemisphere,

930
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:19,083
without your support in some fashion.

931
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:21,006
I know. I know.

932
00:58:21,085 --> 00:58:23,875
You are on my mind day and night.

933
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:29,753
Look, we could possibly...

934
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:31,803
Mr. President...

935
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:33,557
I mean to say...

936
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:39,059
We are facing the gravest odds.

937
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:40,564
We could take your planes

938
00:58:40,646 --> 00:58:43,186
to about a mile from the Canadian border.

939
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:45,906
And then, if you send across

940
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:50,574
a team of horses from Canada,
nothing motorized

941
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:53,496
then you could pull them
over the border yourself.

942
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:57,369
How does that sound?

943
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:01,912
Horses?

944
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,880
You did say,

945
00:59:05,963 --> 00:59:08,463
a team of horses?

946
00:59:08,966 --> 00:59:11,926
Well, I guess you could
push them yourself.

947
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:14,553
Damn things have wheels.

948
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:18,646
Up to you.

949
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:24,982
We could do that, Prime Minister.

950
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:29,862
Prime Minister?

951
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:36,746
Anything you could do at this time,

952
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:38,827
Franklin, would be most welcome.

953
00:59:39,955 --> 00:59:41,995
Good night to you, Winston.

954
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:44,504
It must be late there.

955
00:59:45,461 --> 00:59:50,391
In more ways than you could possibly know.

956
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,508
- Prime Minister.
- Prime Minister.

957
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:38,636
Get me Admiral Ramsay
on one of these, will you?

958
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,972
Yes, Prime Minister.

959
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:43,685
Put me through to Admiral Ramsay.

960
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:04,243
Admiral Ramsay.

961
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:06,161
It's the prime minister.

962
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:08,542
Bertie?

963
01:01:09,086 --> 01:01:12,466
Bertie, I hope I didn't wake you.

964
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:15,298
Not at all. I was just reading the Bible.

965
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:17,344
Exodus?

966
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:19,842
Listen, Bertie.

967
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:22,645
We need to evacuate our boys.

968
01:01:22,725 --> 01:01:25,895
The Navy is saying that with one cruiser

969
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:27,818
and six destroyers and with the...

970
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:30,896
the Luftwaffe controlling the skies above,

971
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:32,943
we'll be lucky to get ten percent out.

972
01:01:33,277 --> 01:01:37,947
I want you to order an assembly of boats.

973
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:41,118
Boats?

974
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:42,491
Yes.

975
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:44,578
Civilian boats.

976
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:47,703
As many as you can get your hands on.

977
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:50,791
Longley's Clipper,
Fearnley's Gin Palace,

978
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:53,298
anyone with a pleasure craft
bigger than 30 foot

979
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,800
that can get to France.

980
01:01:57,301 --> 01:01:59,101
Bertie, you still there?

981
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:01,348
Um... Right.

982
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:06,475
Help me stage this thing, Bertie?

983
01:02:07,061 --> 01:02:11,111
We must at least try to bring
some of our boys home.

984
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:14,488
Well, I'll have the BBC issue the order.

985
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:16,112
Good.

986
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:18,735
Oh, and Bertie, you still there?

987
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:22,195
- Sir.
- We need a name

988
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:24,283
for this operation.

989
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:29,225
Good morning, Prime Minister.
Prime Minister, do you have

990
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:30,644
anything you'd like to say
to our readers this morning?

991
01:02:30,668 --> 01:02:32,378
Prime Minister. Mr. Churchill, sir.

992
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:34,064
Prime Minister, do you have
anything you'd like to say?

993
01:02:34,088 --> 01:02:36,178
Prime Minister?
Prime Minister, are you going to...

994
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:38,296
Prime Minister, would you like to...
Prime Minister?

995
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:48,309
How do you manage drinking during the day?

996
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:53,776
Practice.

997
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:13,209
I...

998
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:15,963
should like to discuss...

999
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:19,461
I have been asked if plans should be drawn

1000
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:24,140
to evacuate myself
and my family to Canada.

1001
01:03:25,264 --> 01:03:27,894
I would like to know
the opinion of our prime minister.

1002
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:31,648
Well, my opinion would be that you must do

1003
01:03:31,729 --> 01:03:33,979
what you feel is right for yourself,

1004
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:37,857
your family and the nation.

1005
01:03:39,194 --> 01:03:41,614
I mean, your survival is paramount.

1006
01:03:42,865 --> 01:03:44,695
Prime ministers...

1007
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:48,033
well, we seem to come and go
at an astonishing rate.

1008
01:03:48,454 --> 01:03:51,494
Your position in Parliament, I...

1009
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:54,589
I'm told, is not strong.

1010
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:57,586
My party

1011
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:04,390
resents the way
Chamberlain was pushed aside.

1012
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,100
And many others doubt me.

1013
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:08,013
They want Halifax still,

1014
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:10,228
but why get rid of the organ grinder

1015
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:11,809
and replace him with the monkey?

1016
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:15,104
Lord Halifax is
a close personal friend of mine.

1017
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:22,731
I am unwanted.

1018
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:28,954
I've never been trusted
since the Gallipoli campaign.

1019
01:04:30,371 --> 01:04:31,711
Unwanted.

1020
01:04:32,414 --> 01:04:34,584
Perhaps it's because you scare people.

1021
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:36,202
Who?

1022
01:04:36,293 --> 01:04:37,373
You scare me.

1023
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:39,874
What nonsense.

1024
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:45,257
What could possibly be scary about me?

1025
01:04:45,386 --> 01:04:48,386
One never knows what's going
to come out of your mouth next.

1026
01:04:48,472 --> 01:04:50,182
Something that will flatter,

1027
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:52,145
something that will wound.

1028
01:04:57,272 --> 01:05:00,902
My emotions are unbridled.

1029
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:05,156
A wildness in the blood

1030
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:08,699
I share with my father.

1031
01:05:09,702 --> 01:05:11,862
And my mother also.

1032
01:05:12,705 --> 01:05:15,625
We lacked the gift of temperance.

1033
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:19,503
Were you close to your parents?

1034
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:23,385
My mother was glamorous,

1035
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:27,258
but perhaps too widely loved.

1036
01:05:28,721 --> 01:05:31,641
My father was like God,

1037
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:33,724
busy elsewhere.

1038
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:36,019
Hmm.

1039
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:19,163
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Prime Minister.

1040
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:24,858
I have asked the minister for war
to join us.

1041
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,620
Neville, would you...

1042
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,028
Anthony.

1043
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,960
Obviously, we are
in a dangerous situation.

1044
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,710
But I am assured by the French premier

1045
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:41,801
that while some German tank units

1046
01:06:41,877 --> 01:06:43,917
have reached the sea,

1047
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:47,046
the situation generally seems
to be well in hand.

1048
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:49,712
What news from Calais?

1049
01:06:49,802 --> 01:06:51,672
The garrison attacked, but was forced back

1050
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:53,722
and is now surrounded on all sides.

1051
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:57,053
They're being shelled
and bombed mercilessly.

1052
01:06:57,476 --> 01:06:59,146
Casualties are at 60%.

1053
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,200
Hmm.

1054
01:07:10,406 --> 01:07:11,906
Prime Minister.

1055
01:07:12,658 --> 01:07:14,118
The question of peace talks.

1056
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,000
We must hold our nerve.

1057
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:22,166
Signal only that we intend
to fight it out until the end.

1058
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:24,414
A peace offer

1059
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:26,335
- telegraphs our weakness.
- Agreed.

1060
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:28,832
And even if we were beaten,
we should be no worse off

1061
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:31,384
than we should be if we were
now to abandon the struggle.

1062
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:33,679
Let us therefore avoid

1063
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:37,052
being dragged down the slippery slope

1064
01:07:37,141 --> 01:07:39,271
with talk of a negotiated peace.

1065
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:41,431
Slippery slope? The only...

1066
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,740
- I suspect Italy and Germany...
- The only slippery slope...

1067
01:07:44,815 --> 01:07:47,395
...wish to get us so deeply
involved in negotiations

1068
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:50,364
- that we should be unable to turn back.
- Nonsense.

1069
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:52,486
- Bastianini informed me...
- I propose...

1070
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:54,973
- The only slippery slope...
- Would you stop interrupting me

1071
01:07:55,034 --> 01:07:56,994
while I am interrupting you?

1072
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,420
When I chose my War Cabinet,
I took great care

1073
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,130
to surround myself with old rivals.

1074
01:08:07,338 --> 01:08:08,758
I may have overdone it.

1075
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:11,211
Viscount Halifax,

1076
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:15,270
the approach you propose is...
It's not only...

1077
01:08:15,346 --> 01:08:16,926
It's futile.

1078
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:19,643
But it involves us in a deadly danger.

1079
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:21,355
The deadly danger here

1080
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:25,855
is this romantic fantasy
of fighting to the end.

1081
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:29,068
What is the end,

1082
01:08:29,485 --> 01:08:32,365
if not the destruction of all things?

1083
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,450
There's nothing heroic

1084
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:36,741
in going down fighting
if it can be avoided.

1085
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:40,285
Nothing even remotely patriotic
in death or glory

1086
01:08:40,371 --> 01:08:42,501
if the odds are firmly on the former.

1087
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:45,951
Nothing inglorious
in trying to shorten a war

1088
01:08:46,043 --> 01:08:47,453
that we are clearly losing.

1089
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:50,084
Losing? Europe is still...

1090
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:51,542
Europe is lost.

1091
01:08:58,681 --> 01:09:02,061
And before our forces
are wiped out completely,

1092
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:04,726
now is the time to negotiate,

1093
01:09:04,812 --> 01:09:07,732
in order to obtain
the best conditions possible.

1094
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:11,903
Hitler will not insist on
outrageous terms.

1095
01:09:11,985 --> 01:09:13,275
He will know his own weaknesses.

1096
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:14,862
He will be reasonable.

1097
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:17,077
When will the lesson be learned?

1098
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:19,909
When will the lesson be learned?

1099
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:23,628
How many more dictators

1100
01:09:23,706 --> 01:09:27,166
must be, wooed, appeased,

1101
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:29,221
good God, given immense privileges

1102
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:31,174
before we learn?

1103
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:34,547
You cannot reason with a tiger

1104
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:37,173
when your head is in its mouth!

1105
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:40,176
Prime Minister.

1106
01:09:41,265 --> 01:09:43,265
Winston. Winston.

1107
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,829
Yesterday, you gave permission...

1108
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:47,223
What permission?

1109
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:49,102
For me to meet Bastianini.

1110
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:50,869
I sanctioned
the theoretical exploration...

1111
01:09:50,941 --> 01:09:51,941
Theoretical?

1112
01:09:52,026 --> 01:09:54,276
...of what price Italy would ask.
Nothing more.

1113
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:56,381
- I did not sanction any...
- If you will not permit

1114
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:58,325
further exploration of a peace agreement,

1115
01:09:58,407 --> 01:09:59,867
then you will have my resignation.

1116
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,580
Don't be absurd, Edward.

1117
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:05,000
- I need you. You know I do.
- I will not stand by

1118
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,340
to watch another generation
of young men die

1119
01:10:08,417 --> 01:10:10,047
at the bloody altar of your hubris.

1120
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:12,757
Oh, and you would have us die as lambs!

1121
01:10:12,838 --> 01:10:14,388
Was Gallipoli not enough for you?

1122
01:10:14,465 --> 01:10:15,965
How dare you!

1123
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:20,173
Our troops were chewing
barbed wire in Flanders,

1124
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:21,672
and I saw it!

1125
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:25,894
Opening a second front,
outflanking the Turks

1126
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:28,356
was a serious military idea,

1127
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:30,397
and it could have
damn well worked if the...

1128
01:10:30,481 --> 01:10:32,441
if the admirals and the First Sea Lord

1129
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:35,604
hadn't dithered away
our element of surprise.

1130
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:41,534
Choice is yours, Winston.

1131
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:44,202
You have 24 hours
to enter into peace talks,

1132
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:45,576
or I shall resign.

1133
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,600
I told him.

1134
01:11:02,054 --> 01:11:03,514
It shook him.

1135
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:05,686
I imagine it did.

1136
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:07,646
Gave him 24 hours.

1137
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:10,816
I don't expect he'll agree,
so I shall resign first.

1138
01:11:10,896 --> 01:11:12,856
You then follow, that's critical if we're

1139
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:15,030
to trigger a vote
of no confidence in the House.

1140
01:11:15,526 --> 01:11:16,906
I shall announce it.

1141
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:20,362
The king will back us.

1142
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:38,045
Prime Minister.

1143
01:11:38,132 --> 01:11:39,502
I wonder if we might schedule you

1144
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:40,751
to address the Outer Cabinet.

1145
01:11:42,928 --> 01:11:44,531
Today, the Admiralty

1146
01:11:44,555 --> 01:11:46,685
have made an order requesting all owners

1147
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:48,185
of self-propelled pleasure craft

1148
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:50,857
between 30 and 100 feet in length

1149
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:54,186
to send all particulars
to the Admiralty immediately...

1150
01:11:54,273 --> 01:11:56,273
To Brigadier Nicholson.

1151
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:03,533
30 Infantry Brigade, Calais.

1152
01:12:06,577 --> 01:12:07,997
Every hour

1153
01:12:09,038 --> 01:12:11,338
you continue to exist

1154
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,581
is of the greatest help

1155
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:18,176
to our forces at Dunkirk.

1156
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:25,885
Have the greatest possible admiration

1157
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:28,847
for your splendid stand.

1158
01:12:34,188 --> 01:12:36,278
Your evacuation, however,

1159
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:39,564
will not take place.

1160
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:46,904
I repeat,

1161
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:50,956
will not take place.

1162
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:00,541
Sign.

1163
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:17,894
Here. Here.

1164
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:22,813
May I be excused?

1165
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:24,365
You may not.

1166
01:13:26,323 --> 01:13:28,113
What is this about?

1167
01:13:30,703 --> 01:13:32,363
No one tells us anything.

1168
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:36,088
It's all classified.

1169
01:13:37,835 --> 01:13:40,835
We hear scraps,
and it's worse than knowing nothing.

1170
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:47,384
What would you like to know?

1171
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:57,645
How many men will survive?

1172
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:05,901
Come with me.

1173
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:15,951
I'm not allowed in the Map Room.

1174
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,590
- Well, you are now.
- Prime Minister.

1175
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:20,256
At ease, gentlemen.

1176
01:14:21,962 --> 01:14:23,172
Now...

1177
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:29,007
The German army controls every French port

1178
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:31,554
except Dunkirk here
and Calais here to the west,

1179
01:14:31,638 --> 01:14:34,228
where the garrison
under Brigadier Nicholson

1180
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:38,438
is drawing fire and delaying
the German advance on Dunkirk.

1181
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,110
At both points, our troops are encircled.

1182
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:44,201
Now, we are still trying

1183
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:46,776
to clear Dunkirk Harbor of wrecked ships

1184
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:49,652
so that we can then land
the boats we need to get

1185
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,200
our boys off those beaches.

1186
01:14:51,283 --> 01:14:54,153
But enemy aircraft
is attacking us constantly.

1187
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:58,834
Our only hope in Dunkirk
is thick cloud cover

1188
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:02,163
to thwart these attacks,
but the skies remain clear.

1189
01:15:02,753 --> 01:15:07,003
And even then, I am told
we will need a...

1190
01:15:07,091 --> 01:15:10,561
a miracle to get even
ten percent of our men out.

1191
01:15:13,681 --> 01:15:16,061
Courage, Miss Layton.

1192
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:18,474
Courage.

1193
01:15:19,103 --> 01:15:20,353
General.

1194
01:15:20,813 --> 01:15:23,103
How long have they got

1195
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:25,981
if we don't rescue them?

1196
01:15:29,113 --> 01:15:31,823
One, maybe

1197
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:34,460
two days.

1198
01:15:40,082 --> 01:15:42,662
News from Calais, the 30th Infantry, sir.

1199
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:44,621
They've retreated to the town's citadel

1200
01:15:44,712 --> 01:15:47,332
as a last and probably hopeless stand.

1201
01:15:47,423 --> 01:15:50,093
The order, "every man
for himself," has been given.

1202
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:51,611
- Thank you, thank you.
- Brigadier Nicholson.

1203
01:15:51,635 --> 01:15:53,555
- There's a telegram, sir.
- Thank you.

1204
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:00,021
Good show, chaps.

1205
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:02,562
Well done, lads. Well done.

1206
01:16:02,646 --> 01:16:04,146
All right.

1207
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:09,566
He's losing too much blood.

1208
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:11,863
We need another transfusion here.

1209
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:19,206
All right, men? All right?

1210
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:34,807
Your evacuation, however,

1211
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,770
will not take place.

1212
01:16:39,683 --> 01:16:42,933
I repeat, will not take place.

1213
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,563
Go to bed, Pig.

1214
01:17:33,404 --> 01:17:35,114
You must sleep.

1215
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:39,618
Leave me, Clemmie.

1216
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:43,165
The opportunity for doing so
passed a long time ago.

1217
01:18:14,737 --> 01:18:16,657
Operator.
How may I direct your call?

1218
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:19,789
- Give me Ramsay.
- One moment, please.

1219
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,040
- Bertie?
- Sir?

1220
01:18:23,245 --> 01:18:24,575
What's been the response?

1221
01:18:24,663 --> 01:18:26,083
It will take time.

1222
01:18:26,165 --> 01:18:27,455
It's too soon to judge.

1223
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:28,991
How many boats so far?

1224
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:31,044
Winston, it will take time.

1225
01:18:31,128 --> 01:18:34,678
The request for civilian boats,
Bertie, was not a request.

1226
01:18:34,757 --> 01:18:36,797
It was an order!

1227
01:18:51,732 --> 01:18:53,772
- Miss Layton.
- Sir.

1228
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:56,659
I need to reach,

1229
01:18:57,112 --> 01:18:58,272
to reach,

1230
01:18:59,448 --> 01:19:00,868
to speak to...

1231
01:19:02,326 --> 01:19:03,366
To?

1232
01:19:04,078 --> 01:19:05,208
3:00 p.m.

1233
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:06,537
2:00 p.m., sir?

1234
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:09,201
Yes. Yes.

1235
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:12,161
Ask Bridges to summon the...

1236
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:14,333
Oh, God.

1237
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:16,751
The War Cabinet, at 3:00 p.m.

1238
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:17,970
Thank you!

1239
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:23,307
Sir.

1240
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:26,599
From Lord Gort in France, sir.

1241
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:33,732
Belgium has fallen.

1242
01:19:35,693 --> 01:19:38,863
They will surrender at midnight.

1243
01:19:41,782 --> 01:19:43,782
France will soon follow suit.

1244
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:58,137
We have received reports

1245
01:19:58,215 --> 01:19:59,925
that the most probable method of attack

1246
01:20:00,009 --> 01:20:02,219
which Germany might employ
against this country

1247
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:05,094
is a large fleet of fast motorboats,

1248
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,940
possibly up to 200,
carrying a hundred men apiece,

1249
01:20:08,017 --> 01:20:10,767
to carry out a seaborne raid
on a large scale.

1250
01:20:10,853 --> 01:20:13,433
By these means,
a considerable force of the enemy

1251
01:20:13,522 --> 01:20:15,562
could be landed
at many points on the coast

1252
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:18,779
simultaneously with airborne raids inland.

1253
01:20:18,861 --> 01:20:22,621
We do not feel
that by naval or air action,

1254
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:24,698
we could prevent such a landing.

1255
01:20:27,286 --> 01:20:28,706
Could you repeat that?

1256
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:30,461
We must prepare

1257
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:32,669
for the imminent invasion of our island.

1258
01:20:36,754 --> 01:20:39,254
We must prepare for
the imminent invasion of our island.

1259
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:41,717
We recommend that the country

1260
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,770
should be warned and roused
to the immediate danger,

1261
01:20:44,845 --> 01:20:46,305
and that all personnel

1262
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:49,058
required to put Britain
in a state of defense

1263
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:52,441
should be mobilized
without a moment's delay.

1264
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:53,689
Lights.

1265
01:20:59,777 --> 01:21:02,487
Thank you, General.

1266
01:21:05,366 --> 01:21:09,366
Let all preparations be made.

1267
01:21:10,871 --> 01:21:12,781
Let the record state, I have received word

1268
01:21:12,873 --> 01:21:14,543
from the Italian embassy in London.

1269
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:16,795
Italy is prepared to mediate a resolution

1270
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:19,007
between Britain, its allies and Germany.

1271
01:21:25,094 --> 01:21:27,634
Perhaps then,

1272
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:34,223
the time for such an offer from us

1273
01:21:34,311 --> 01:21:35,931
is when...

1274
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:42,524
Well, is when...

1275
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:50,285
Is when Germany has made
an unsuccessful attempt

1276
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:52,959
- to invade this country.
- Unsuccessful?

1277
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:54,958
Then you leave me
no other option but to offer...

1278
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,800
Winston. Winston!

1279
01:21:57,459 --> 01:22:01,629
You are refusing to grasp the realities

1280
01:22:01,714 --> 01:22:05,134
of how precarious our position is.

1281
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:09,673
Our entire army is about to be wiped out.

1282
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:12,895
Terms must be struck.

1283
01:22:17,896 --> 01:22:19,236
Anthony.

1284
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:40,204
Then it seems we...

1285
01:22:42,171 --> 01:22:44,221
We have no choice

1286
01:22:45,174 --> 01:22:47,804
but to at least consider the

1287
01:22:48,552 --> 01:22:51,672
path of negotiation.

1288
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:56,722
If Hitler's peace terms are

1289
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:02,604
over lordship of Central Europe,

1290
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:07,442
return of certain German colonies,

1291
01:23:08,489 --> 01:23:12,539
and if he will leave us

1292
01:23:13,744 --> 01:23:16,034
our independence,

1293
01:23:18,332 --> 01:23:21,502
then I'd be grateful

1294
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:25,173
to get out of our present...

1295
01:23:26,674 --> 01:23:28,044
difficulties.

1296
01:23:29,677 --> 01:23:31,467
But it is unlikely

1297
01:23:32,429 --> 01:23:35,269
that he will make such an offer.

1298
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:40,519
But if I were told
what the German terms were,

1299
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:49,404
well, then I'd be prepared
to consider them.

1300
01:23:51,156 --> 01:23:53,366
Thank you, Prime Minister.

1301
01:23:54,201 --> 01:23:56,741
We shall prepare
a draft memorandum at once.

1302
01:24:09,299 --> 01:24:13,219
I have come to wonder,

1303
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:16,133
in recent days...

1304
01:24:20,894 --> 01:24:23,354
whether it was...

1305
01:24:26,191 --> 01:24:28,061
part of my duty...

1306
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:34,322
part of my...

1307
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,670
part of my duty to...

1308
01:24:39,329 --> 01:24:41,459
to consider...

1309
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:45,007
to consider,

1310
01:24:51,383 --> 01:24:53,553
to consider...

1311
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:58,638
...whether it was...

1312
01:24:58,724 --> 01:25:01,014
Will that be all for tonight, sir?

1313
01:25:05,397 --> 01:25:08,447
...whether it was part of my duty

1314
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:12,615
entering into...

1315
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:16,700
into negotiations with,

1316
01:25:21,497 --> 01:25:22,877
...that...

1317
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:27,005
...that corporal...

1318
01:25:32,966 --> 01:25:34,846
that child.

1319
01:25:39,264 --> 01:25:42,184
And monster of wickedness.

1320
01:25:43,936 --> 01:25:45,106
That butcher.

1321
01:25:45,312 --> 01:25:48,682
That savage.

1322
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:51,314
Monstrous savage.

1323
01:25:58,075 --> 01:25:59,905
That wicked

1324
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:03,246
house painter.

1325
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:08,378
House painter!

1326
01:26:15,342 --> 01:26:18,462
Where were we?

1327
01:26:21,932 --> 01:26:23,142
Well?

1328
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:27,940
I didn't understand you, sir.

1329
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:30,891
You were...

1330
01:26:31,275 --> 01:26:32,525
Were?

1331
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:34,910
You were mumbling.

1332
01:26:34,987 --> 01:26:36,737
"Mumbling."

1333
01:26:41,994 --> 01:26:44,914
The right words

1334
01:26:46,457 --> 01:26:47,917
won't come.

1335
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:49,782
They will come, sir.

1336
01:26:50,419 --> 01:26:53,009
No one can put words together like you.

1337
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:04,901
Oh!

1338
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:17,486
Your beau?

1339
01:27:18,864 --> 01:27:20,194
My brother.

1340
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:24,370
Where is he now?

1341
01:27:25,037 --> 01:27:26,997
He was falling back on Dunkirk.

1342
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:30,294
But he never made it.

1343
01:27:54,942 --> 01:27:56,102
What?

1344
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,619
Just looking at you.

1345
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:32,321
Shall I read back what we have?

1346
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:37,027
Yes, please.

1347
01:28:42,906 --> 01:28:45,956
"I have come to wonder in recent days

1348
01:28:46,869 --> 01:28:49,249
"whether it was my duty to consider

1349
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:53,799
"entering into negotiations with..."

1350
01:28:57,504 --> 01:28:58,924
With?

1351
01:29:47,096 --> 01:29:49,136
I've just been standing,

1352
01:29:49,431 --> 01:29:53,391
imagining never being here anymore,

1353
01:29:54,478 --> 01:29:56,898
whether it is because I'm no longer alive

1354
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:59,320
or that the palace itself is gone.

1355
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,200
Canada.

1356
01:30:02,403 --> 01:30:03,813
You must decide, sir.

1357
01:30:04,488 --> 01:30:05,658
You could rule in exile.

1358
01:30:05,739 --> 01:30:08,249
Truly? Is that to be my fate?

1359
01:30:13,288 --> 01:30:14,668
You know something?

1360
01:30:14,748 --> 01:30:18,128
I'm aware in this moment of feeling angry.

1361
01:30:20,796 --> 01:30:22,426
Bloody angry.

1362
01:30:26,093 --> 01:30:27,803
Darling.

1363
01:30:30,806 --> 01:30:32,556
Winston, darling.

1364
01:30:35,352 --> 01:30:36,932
There's someone to see you.

1365
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:38,934
You have a visitor.

1366
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:52,574
My darling, you have the full weight

1367
01:30:52,661 --> 01:30:54,281
of the world on your shoulders.

1368
01:30:54,955 --> 01:30:56,785
No, I know, I know.

1369
01:30:56,874 --> 01:30:59,334
But these inner battles

1370
01:31:00,878 --> 01:31:03,378
have actually trained you

1371
01:31:03,922 --> 01:31:05,332
for this very moment.

1372
01:31:06,216 --> 01:31:08,886
You are strong because you are imperfect.

1373
01:31:08,969 --> 01:31:13,019
You are wise because you have doubts.

1374
01:31:15,267 --> 01:31:17,687
Now, shall I let him in?

1375
01:31:19,438 --> 01:31:20,648
Who?

1376
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:22,860
The king.

1377
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:24,981
Which king?

1378
01:31:25,694 --> 01:31:27,524
Our king?

1379
01:31:27,613 --> 01:31:30,823
Well, if it isn't him,
it's a marvelous impersonation.

1380
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:42,002
Mr. Churchill.

1381
01:31:42,294 --> 01:31:45,794
I hope you can forgive the late hour, but

1382
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:49,341
your wife thought tonight
would be a good time.

1383
01:31:50,803 --> 01:31:52,013
Shall we sit?

1384
01:31:52,429 --> 01:31:53,809
Oh, yes.

1385
01:31:53,889 --> 01:31:55,689
Please.

1386
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:01,565
Something to drink, perhaps?

1387
01:32:01,647 --> 01:32:02,777
No.

1388
01:32:09,947 --> 01:32:15,327
I received a visit.

1389
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:17,630
From?

1390
01:32:17,705 --> 01:32:19,205
Viscount Halifax.

1391
01:32:19,289 --> 01:32:22,169
It appears that
the prospect of a peace deal

1392
01:32:23,544 --> 01:32:27,004
has increased dramatically.

1393
01:32:28,674 --> 01:32:33,094
The War Cabinet is drafting
a letter to Mussolini,

1394
01:32:33,804 --> 01:32:38,974
asking him to broker talks
with Herr Hitler.

1395
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:45,319
Then Halifax was correct.

1396
01:32:47,568 --> 01:32:49,868
I should like to know your mind.

1397
01:32:49,945 --> 01:32:52,945
It would be helpful to know yours first.

1398
01:32:53,282 --> 01:32:56,702
I should like to know it myself.

1399
01:32:58,537 --> 01:33:00,667
Nations

1400
01:33:01,123 --> 01:33:04,293
which go down fighting rise again,
and those

1401
01:33:05,252 --> 01:33:07,542
that surrender tamely are finished.

1402
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:08,879
Belgium?

1403
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,260
- Collapsed.
- Norway?

1404
01:33:11,342 --> 01:33:12,672
Holland.

1405
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,890
France any hour.

1406
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:16,390
And the mood of Parliament?

1407
01:33:16,472 --> 01:33:17,552
Fear. Panic.

1408
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:19,189
And you?

1409
01:33:20,726 --> 01:33:22,646
Are you not afraid?

1410
01:33:24,021 --> 01:33:27,071
I am, most terribly.

1411
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:33,484
Support in the War Cabinet

1412
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:36,866
for the campaign of resistance

1413
01:33:38,243 --> 01:33:39,453
has collapsed.

1414
01:33:47,628 --> 01:33:53,138
Later today,
I will address the House accordingly.

1415
01:34:03,936 --> 01:34:05,766
You have my support.

1416
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:14,660
Your Majesty?

1417
01:34:15,698 --> 01:34:17,828
You have my support.

1418
01:34:20,244 --> 01:34:21,784
I confess, I

1419
01:34:22,663 --> 01:34:26,583
had some reservations about you
at first, but

1420
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:30,217
while some in this country
dreaded your appointment,

1421
01:34:30,295 --> 01:34:34,425
none, none dreaded it like Adolf Hitler.

1422
01:34:34,508 --> 01:34:38,308
Whomever can strike fear
into that brute heart

1423
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:41,386
is worthy of all of our trust.

1424
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:43,190
We shall work together.

1425
01:34:43,267 --> 01:34:46,147
You shall have my support at any hour.

1426
01:34:46,812 --> 01:34:48,432
Beat the buggers.

1427
01:34:49,857 --> 01:34:51,527
I will go to Parliament.

1428
01:34:52,443 --> 01:34:55,613
But without support in my own party,

1429
01:34:56,196 --> 01:34:58,076
I must sue for peace.

1430
01:35:02,119 --> 01:35:03,579
You once gave me some advice.

1431
01:35:03,662 --> 01:35:06,082
Perhaps I can... I can give you some.

1432
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:09,043
Go to the people.

1433
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:11,506
Let them instruct you.

1434
01:35:11,587 --> 01:35:14,637
Quite silently, they usually do.

1435
01:35:15,049 --> 01:35:16,429
But tell them

1436
01:35:17,468 --> 01:35:20,138
the truth unvarnished.

1437
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,640
If invasion is imminent,

1438
01:35:22,723 --> 01:35:24,843
if our troops in France are lost,

1439
01:35:25,267 --> 01:35:26,857
they must be prepared.

1440
01:35:30,314 --> 01:35:32,104
On certain matters,

1441
01:35:34,068 --> 01:35:38,448
I have very few people with whom I can

1442
01:35:38,864 --> 01:35:41,574
talk frankly.

1443
01:35:41,658 --> 01:35:43,408
Perhaps now we have each other.

1444
01:35:45,537 --> 01:35:47,957
And I no longer scare you?

1445
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:49,710
A little.

1446
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,625
But I can cope.

1447
01:36:02,012 --> 01:36:03,842
We are ready. More or less.

1448
01:36:03,931 --> 01:36:06,351
More or less what, Bertie?

1449
01:36:06,433 --> 01:36:07,973
Give me a number.

1450
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,730
In total, 860 vessels.

1451
01:36:10,813 --> 01:36:13,563
The biggest civilian fleet ever assembled.

1452
01:36:13,649 --> 01:36:16,199
Operation Dynamo waits on your command.

1453
01:36:16,276 --> 01:36:17,946
Admiral,

1454
01:36:18,529 --> 01:36:21,409
initiate Dynamo.

1455
01:36:21,490 --> 01:36:24,210
And may God watch over them all.

1456
01:37:49,328 --> 01:37:51,038
We've lost the prime minister.

1457
01:38:13,352 --> 01:38:15,432
Do you know how to use this thing?

1458
01:38:15,521 --> 01:38:16,611
Yes, sir.

1459
01:38:17,856 --> 01:38:19,946
How do I get to Westminster?

1460
01:38:20,025 --> 01:38:21,695
Westminster.

1461
01:38:22,945 --> 01:38:25,365
The District Line, east. One stop.

1462
01:38:25,447 --> 01:38:28,157
District Line. East. One stop.

1463
01:38:28,242 --> 01:38:30,652
Well, that doesn't sound so hard.

1464
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:31,824
No, sir.

1465
01:38:31,912 --> 01:38:33,372
Thank you.

1466
01:38:33,455 --> 01:38:34,955
Thank you, sir.

1467
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:39,470
The memorandum is titled
"Suggested Approaches to Italy"

1468
01:38:39,545 --> 01:38:40,925
and is as follows.

1469
01:38:41,005 --> 01:38:44,425
"If Signor Mussolini
will cooperate with us

1470
01:38:44,508 --> 01:38:48,348
"in securing a settlement
of all European questions

1471
01:38:48,429 --> 01:38:50,229
"which safeguard
the independence

1472
01:38:50,305 --> 01:38:54,515
"and security of the allies,
and could be the basis

1473
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:57,471
"of a just and durable peace for Europe,

1474
01:38:57,563 --> 01:39:00,683
"we will undertake at once to discuss,

1475
01:39:01,066 --> 01:39:03,316
"with the desire to find solutions,

1476
01:39:03,402 --> 01:39:05,902
"the matters in which Signor Mussolini

1477
01:39:05,988 --> 01:39:08,078
"is primarily interested.

1478
01:39:08,157 --> 01:39:11,497
"We understand that
he desires the solution

1479
01:39:11,577 --> 01:39:13,997
"of certain Mediterranean questions,

1480
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:17,959
"and if he will state
in secrecy what these are,

1481
01:39:18,042 --> 01:39:21,002
"France and Great Britain will at once

1482
01:39:21,086 --> 01:39:23,376
"do their best to meet his wishes."

1483
01:39:28,802 --> 01:39:32,762
So, this is the Underground.

1484
01:39:45,527 --> 01:39:46,777
Thank you.

1485
01:40:25,526 --> 01:40:27,196
Does anyone have a match?

1486
01:40:32,825 --> 01:40:34,205
Thank you.

1487
01:40:35,661 --> 01:40:37,291
Thank you.

1488
01:40:39,832 --> 01:40:41,992
What are you all staring at?

1489
01:40:42,084 --> 01:40:44,544
Have you never seen the prime minister

1490
01:40:44,628 --> 01:40:46,468
ride the Underground before?

1491
01:40:49,508 --> 01:40:50,928
What is your name?

1492
01:40:51,010 --> 01:40:52,930
Oliver Wilson, sir.

1493
01:40:54,304 --> 01:40:56,014
And what do you do, Mr. Wilson?

1494
01:40:56,098 --> 01:40:59,308
- Bricklayer, sir.
- Ah, bricklayer.

1495
01:40:59,393 --> 01:41:02,723
We shall have great need
of bricklayers soon.

1496
01:41:02,813 --> 01:41:04,353
Business will be looking up.

1497
01:41:08,986 --> 01:41:10,656
Progress.

1498
01:41:16,285 --> 01:41:17,455
How old?

1499
01:41:17,536 --> 01:41:18,706
Five months, sir.

1500
01:41:18,787 --> 01:41:20,917
He looks like you.

1501
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:24,090
Madam, all babies look like me.

1502
01:41:26,795 --> 01:41:28,125
Well, what is your name?

1503
01:41:28,213 --> 01:41:29,883
Mrs. Jessie Sutton.

1504
01:41:29,965 --> 01:41:31,795
Ah, Mrs. Sutton.

1505
01:41:31,884 --> 01:41:33,304
It's a pleasure.

1506
01:41:33,886 --> 01:41:35,466
Abigail.

1507
01:41:35,804 --> 01:41:37,014
Abigail Walker.

1508
01:41:37,097 --> 01:41:40,097
- Marcus Peters.
- Marcus Peters.

1509
01:41:42,853 --> 01:41:45,023
- Agnes Dillon.
- Agnes.

1510
01:41:45,105 --> 01:41:47,695
- Maurice Baker.
- Mr. Baker.

1511
01:41:47,775 --> 01:41:50,065
- Alice Simpson.
- Alice Simpson.

1512
01:41:50,152 --> 01:41:51,942
Miss Margaret Jerome.

1513
01:41:52,321 --> 01:41:53,951
Oh, a Jerome.

1514
01:41:54,031 --> 01:41:56,001
My mother was a Jerome.

1515
01:41:56,075 --> 01:41:59,245
I expect we are closely related.

1516
01:42:00,287 --> 01:42:02,077
Please, please. Sit.

1517
01:42:02,164 --> 01:42:03,374
Sit, everyone.

1518
01:42:07,002 --> 01:42:09,082
Thank you, Mr. Baker.

1519
01:42:09,171 --> 01:42:13,921
So, how are you all,
how are you all bearing up?

1520
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:16,890
Good spirits?

1521
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:18,350
- Yes.
- Yes?

1522
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:20,100
Just as well.

1523
01:42:20,182 --> 01:42:22,012
We shall need them.

1524
01:42:24,144 --> 01:42:25,934
Let me ask you something

1525
01:42:26,397 --> 01:42:29,987
that's been weighing on my mind.

1526
01:42:30,067 --> 01:42:32,987
Perhaps you can provide me with an answer.

1527
01:42:33,529 --> 01:42:37,619
You, the British people.

1528
01:42:38,575 --> 01:42:40,495
What is your mood?

1529
01:42:41,078 --> 01:42:44,038
Is it confident?

1530
01:42:44,123 --> 01:42:46,333
- Yeah.
- If confident, how confident?

1531
01:42:46,417 --> 01:42:49,337
- Very.
- Some people say it's a lost cause.

1532
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:51,090
No, lost causes are the only ones

1533
01:42:51,171 --> 01:42:53,171
- worth fighting for.
- Too right.

1534
01:42:53,257 --> 01:42:55,177
Yes. Now let me ask you this.

1535
01:42:55,259 --> 01:42:57,219
If the worst came to pass

1536
01:42:57,302 --> 01:43:01,342
and the enemy were to appear on those...

1537
01:43:01,432 --> 01:43:04,432
those streets above, what would you do?

1538
01:43:04,518 --> 01:43:06,358
- Fight.
- Fight the fascists.

1539
01:43:06,437 --> 01:43:08,081
Fight them with anything
we can lay our hands on.

1540
01:43:08,105 --> 01:43:10,605
- Broom handles if we must.
- Street by street.

1541
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:12,401
They will never take Piccadilly.

1542
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:15,692
Never take Piccadilly, indeed.

1543
01:43:15,779 --> 01:43:18,869
And what if I put it to you all

1544
01:43:18,949 --> 01:43:24,669
that we might, if we, if we ask nicely

1545
01:43:24,747 --> 01:43:28,837
get very favorable terms from Mr. Hitler

1546
01:43:28,917 --> 01:43:32,837
if we enter into a peace deal
with him right now?

1547
01:43:33,297 --> 01:43:34,887
What would you say to that?

1548
01:43:34,965 --> 01:43:37,505
Never! Never! Never!

1549
01:43:37,593 --> 01:43:39,263
Never! Never!

1550
01:43:47,478 --> 01:43:48,728
Never.

1551
01:43:50,856 --> 01:43:52,146
Never.

1552
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,200
Will you never give up?

1553
01:43:55,277 --> 01:43:56,817
No. Never.

1554
01:43:58,447 --> 01:44:03,117
"Then out spake brave Horatius,

1555
01:44:05,412 --> 01:44:07,992
"Captain of the Gate:

1556
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:12,338
"To every man upon this earth

1557
01:44:12,419 --> 01:44:17,089
"Death cometh soon or late.

1558
01:44:17,883 --> 01:44:22,513
"And how can man die better

1559
01:44:22,596 --> 01:44:25,016
"Than facing fearful odds

1560
01:44:27,518 --> 01:44:30,148
- "For the ashes..."
- "For the ashes of his fathers

1561
01:44:30,604 --> 01:44:33,354
"And the temples of his Gods."

1562
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:44,703
Are you crying?

1563
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:46,460
I...

1564
01:44:46,787 --> 01:44:49,537
Yes, yes. I...

1565
01:44:49,873 --> 01:44:51,993
I blub a lot, you know.

1566
01:44:53,627 --> 01:44:55,967
You'll have to get used to it.

1567
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:00,300
What stop is this?

1568
01:45:00,718 --> 01:45:02,808
It's Westminster, sir.

1569
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:06,600
Westminster. It's my stop.

1570
01:45:38,464 --> 01:45:39,834
Prime Minister.

1571
01:45:42,676 --> 01:45:43,756
Sir.

1572
01:45:45,554 --> 01:45:47,224
The War Cabinet.

1573
01:45:47,306 --> 01:45:48,726
Sir, they're waiting.

1574
01:45:48,807 --> 01:45:51,397
I'm due to address the Outer Cabinet.

1575
01:45:52,269 --> 01:45:53,689
- When?
- Now.

1576
01:45:53,771 --> 01:45:55,571
I haven't spoken to them

1577
01:45:55,647 --> 01:45:57,567
since the formation of the new government.

1578
01:46:01,236 --> 01:46:02,866
- Prime Minister.
- Good day, gentlemen.

1579
01:46:02,946 --> 01:46:05,036
Prime Minister...

1580
01:46:05,115 --> 01:46:09,415
I-I'm about to, speak to
my Outer Cabinet in my rooms,

1581
01:46:09,495 --> 01:46:12,705
and I extend the invitation to any of you

1582
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:14,250
who would care to join them.

1583
01:46:16,335 --> 01:46:18,835
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1584
01:46:37,106 --> 01:46:38,606
This afternoon,

1585
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:43,200
I shall address the House

1586
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:47,660
on the matter of our nation's security.

1587
01:46:49,326 --> 01:46:52,496
At this very moment, the War Cabinet

1588
01:46:52,579 --> 01:46:56,589
is drafting papers
that lay out a willingness

1589
01:46:56,667 --> 01:47:00,087
to enter into peace talks
with Herr Hitler,

1590
01:47:00,796 --> 01:47:02,466
via his

1591
01:47:03,298 --> 01:47:05,758
his lackey, Mussolini.

1592
01:47:07,803 --> 01:47:12,723
I have thought
very carefully in these last days

1593
01:47:12,808 --> 01:47:15,438
whether it was part of my duty

1594
01:47:16,145 --> 01:47:20,355
to consider entering
into negotiations with...

1595
01:47:24,528 --> 01:47:26,198
With that man.

1596
01:47:28,532 --> 01:47:30,612
But then I...

1597
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:36,210
I spoke with

1598
01:47:39,626 --> 01:47:41,296
Oliver Wilson,

1599
01:47:42,296 --> 01:47:44,886
Mrs. Jessie Sutton,

1600
01:47:45,591 --> 01:47:49,061
Mrs. Abigail Walker,

1601
01:47:49,428 --> 01:47:51,678
Marcus Peters,

1602
01:47:51,764 --> 01:47:53,934
Maurice Baker,

1603
01:47:54,016 --> 01:47:55,516
Alice Simpson

1604
01:47:55,601 --> 01:47:58,361
and Miss Margaret Jerome.

1605
01:47:58,729 --> 01:48:00,989
Brave, good, true citizens
of this kingdom.

1606
01:48:01,065 --> 01:48:05,155
And they argued strongly
that it was idle to think,

1607
01:48:05,235 --> 01:48:08,115
if we tried to make peace now,

1608
01:48:08,197 --> 01:48:11,907
we should get better terms
than if we fought it out.

1609
01:48:12,951 --> 01:48:17,661
The Germans, Mr. Baker felt,

1610
01:48:17,998 --> 01:48:21,458
would demand,
in the name of disarmament,

1611
01:48:21,543 --> 01:48:23,623
our naval bases and much else,

1612
01:48:23,712 --> 01:48:25,502
and I think he's right.

1613
01:48:25,589 --> 01:48:29,599
Jessie Sutton, speaking for many,

1614
01:48:29,677 --> 01:48:33,177
believes we would then become a...

1615
01:48:33,263 --> 01:48:35,223
a slave state.

1616
01:48:35,766 --> 01:48:39,646
A British government
which would be Hitler's puppet.

1617
01:48:39,728 --> 01:48:43,988
A government set up under Mosley

1618
01:48:44,066 --> 01:48:46,196
- or some such person.
- No, no.

1619
01:48:46,276 --> 01:48:49,986
And I join with them in asking
a further question.

1620
01:48:50,072 --> 01:48:52,572
A question I now put to you.

1621
01:48:53,283 --> 01:48:57,323
Where should we be
at the end of all that?

1622
01:49:02,584 --> 01:49:04,414
Some might benefit.

1623
01:49:04,628 --> 01:49:08,798
I mean, the powerful might
be able to parlay good terms,

1624
01:49:08,882 --> 01:49:11,802
preserved in their country redoubts,

1625
01:49:11,885 --> 01:49:16,265
out of sight of the swastika flying over

1626
01:49:16,348 --> 01:49:18,898
over Buckingham Palace!

1627
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:21,016
Over Windsor!

1628
01:49:21,353 --> 01:49:23,853
And, draped on these very buildings!

1629
01:49:23,939 --> 01:49:25,739
- Never! Never!
- No! No!

1630
01:49:25,816 --> 01:49:27,816
So I come to you...

1631
01:49:29,528 --> 01:49:32,198
I come to you

1632
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:37,210
to learn your minds in this grave hour.

1633
01:49:38,287 --> 01:49:41,207
You see, it was pointed out to me

1634
01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:45,420
by my new friends
that you might even rise up

1635
01:49:45,502 --> 01:49:48,502
and tear me down were I for one moment

1636
01:49:48,589 --> 01:49:50,589
to contemplate parlay or surrender.

1637
01:49:55,596 --> 01:49:56,846
Were they wrong?

1638
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:58,230
No!

1639
01:49:58,307 --> 01:49:59,647
- Were they wrong?
- No!

1640
01:49:59,725 --> 01:50:01,395
Were they wrong?

1641
01:50:01,477 --> 01:50:03,357
- No!
- Thank you. Thank you.

1642
01:50:03,437 --> 01:50:04,897
Then I have heard you.

1643
01:50:05,356 --> 01:50:07,066
I have heard you.

1644
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:13,240
It appears to be your will also

1645
01:50:13,781 --> 01:50:18,711
that if this long island story
of ours is to end at last,

1646
01:50:18,786 --> 01:50:22,626
then let it end only when each one of us

1647
01:50:22,873 --> 01:50:27,373
lies choking in his own blood
upon the ground!

1648
01:50:27,461 --> 01:50:30,431
- Yes!
- Bravo!

1649
01:50:30,506 --> 01:50:31,796
Yes.

1650
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:36,711
And when I asked
to know their minds,

1651
01:50:36,804 --> 01:50:38,674
there occurred a demonstration which,

1652
01:50:38,764 --> 01:50:40,974
considering the character
of the gathering,

1653
01:50:41,058 --> 01:50:42,858
quite surprised me.

1654
01:50:43,519 --> 01:50:47,989
There is no doubt that if we falter at all

1655
01:50:48,065 --> 01:50:49,895
in the leading of the nation,

1656
01:50:49,983 --> 01:50:52,773
we should all be hurled out of office.

1657
01:50:53,445 --> 01:50:54,985
I am sure now that every minister

1658
01:50:55,072 --> 01:50:56,442
on both sides of the House

1659
01:50:56,532 --> 01:50:59,032
is ready to be killed quite soon,

1660
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:02,208
and have all his family
and possessions destroyed,

1661
01:51:02,287 --> 01:51:03,877
rather than give in.

1662
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:08,510
In this, they represent
almost all the people.

1663
01:51:09,211 --> 01:51:13,961
And it falls to me
in these coming days and months

1664
01:51:14,425 --> 01:51:18,095
to express their sentiments.

1665
01:51:20,556 --> 01:51:25,106
There shall be no negotiated peace.

1666
01:51:29,481 --> 01:51:31,851
And you must each do now

1667
01:51:32,526 --> 01:51:34,156
as you see fit.

1668
01:51:38,991 --> 01:51:42,291
If you will excuse me, gentlemen

1669
01:51:42,369 --> 01:51:45,919
I believe I am due to address Parliament.

1670
01:51:46,415 --> 01:51:50,335
And I have yet to write
a word of my speech.

1671
01:51:50,419 --> 01:51:52,089
There's the buggers.

1672
01:51:55,424 --> 01:51:57,044
- Tiny.
- Sir.

1673
01:52:02,973 --> 01:52:05,013
- Miss Layton.
- Sir.

1674
01:52:05,517 --> 01:52:06,937
I am in need of you.

1675
01:52:09,355 --> 01:52:12,185
We must both now resign,
force a vote of no confidence.

1676
01:52:13,567 --> 01:52:16,157
Well, let us go to the Commons first,

1677
01:52:16,862 --> 01:52:17,942
join our colleagues.

1678
01:52:19,323 --> 01:52:22,903
Then speak after
the prime minister's address.

1679
01:52:42,262 --> 01:52:44,592
Here is a woman who's always tired,

1680
01:52:45,557 --> 01:52:49,357
for she lives a life
where too much is required.

1681
01:53:17,297 --> 01:53:19,547
The Prime Minister.

1682
01:53:28,851 --> 01:53:32,981
Turning once again
to the question of invasion,

1683
01:53:33,063 --> 01:53:37,143
I would observe that there
has never been a period

1684
01:53:37,234 --> 01:53:40,734
in all these long centuries
of which we boast

1685
01:53:40,821 --> 01:53:46,461
when an absolute guarantee
against invasion

1686
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:49,830
could have been given to our people.

1687
01:53:50,706 --> 01:53:52,456
Hear, hear.

1688
01:53:56,754 --> 01:53:58,624
But I have myself

1689
01:53:59,548 --> 01:54:03,468
full confidence that if all do their duty,

1690
01:54:04,011 --> 01:54:06,561
if nothing is neglected,

1691
01:54:07,014 --> 01:54:08,594
and the best arrangements are made,

1692
01:54:08,682 --> 01:54:11,222
as they are being made,

1693
01:54:11,727 --> 01:54:14,607
we shall prove ourselves once more able

1694
01:54:14,688 --> 01:54:17,188
to defend our island home.

1695
01:54:17,274 --> 01:54:21,654
To ride out the storm of war

1696
01:54:22,196 --> 01:54:25,576
and to outlive the menace of tyranny.

1697
01:54:25,657 --> 01:54:27,497
If necessary

1698
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:31,750
for years, if necessary

1699
01:54:32,873 --> 01:54:34,083
alone.

1700
01:54:36,085 --> 01:54:38,715
At any rate, that is what we are

1701
01:54:38,796 --> 01:54:40,626
are going to try to do.

1702
01:54:41,173 --> 01:54:45,923
That is the resolve
of His Majesty's Government,

1703
01:54:46,011 --> 01:54:47,771
- every man of them.
- To your right, please.

1704
01:54:48,222 --> 01:54:50,432
That is the will

1705
01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:52,896
of Parliament and the nation.

1706
01:54:52,976 --> 01:54:55,226
Hear, hear.

1707
01:54:56,105 --> 01:54:57,935
The British Empire

1708
01:54:58,023 --> 01:54:59,693
and the French Republic,

1709
01:54:59,775 --> 01:55:03,945
linked together
in their cause and in their need,

1710
01:55:04,238 --> 01:55:06,788
will defend to the death

1711
01:55:06,865 --> 01:55:08,785
their native soil.

1712
01:55:08,867 --> 01:55:10,207
Hear, hear!

1713
01:55:10,285 --> 01:55:14,075
Aiding each other like good comrades

1714
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:17,090
to the utmost of their strength.

1715
01:55:17,167 --> 01:55:18,257
Hear, hear.

1716
01:55:20,462 --> 01:55:24,592
Even though large tracts of Europe

1717
01:55:24,883 --> 01:55:26,923
and many old and famous states

1718
01:55:27,011 --> 01:55:31,311
have fallen or may fall into

1719
01:55:31,390 --> 01:55:34,980
the grip of the Gestapo

1720
01:55:35,227 --> 01:55:39,437
and all the odious apparatus
of the Nazi rule,

1721
01:55:40,232 --> 01:55:43,062
we shall not flag or fail.

1722
01:55:44,361 --> 01:55:47,071
We shall go on to the end!

1723
01:55:47,156 --> 01:55:49,156
Hear, hear!

1724
01:55:52,286 --> 01:55:55,246
We shall fight in France.

1725
01:55:55,956 --> 01:56:00,046
We shall fight
on the seas and the oceans.

1726
01:56:00,544 --> 01:56:04,254
We shall fight with growing confidence

1727
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:06,300
and growing strengths in the air.

1728
01:56:06,383 --> 01:56:07,713
Hear, hear!

1729
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:11,131
We shall defend our island,

1730
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:13,841
whatever the cost may be.

1731
01:56:13,932 --> 01:56:16,052
Hear, hear.

1732
01:56:16,352 --> 01:56:19,312
We shall fight on the beaches.

1733
01:56:19,396 --> 01:56:23,106
We shall fight on the landing grounds.

1734
01:56:23,567 --> 01:56:26,657
We shall fight in the fields

1735
01:56:26,737 --> 01:56:28,987
and in the streets.

1736
01:56:29,406 --> 01:56:32,246
We shall fight in the hills.

1737
01:56:32,659 --> 01:56:34,829
We shall never surrender!

1738
01:56:37,373 --> 01:56:40,203
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

1739
01:56:44,505 --> 01:56:45,965
And if...

1740
01:56:50,135 --> 01:56:51,765
And if

1741
01:56:53,263 --> 01:56:56,393
which I do not for a moment believe,

1742
01:56:56,642 --> 01:57:01,182
this island or large part of it were...

1743
01:57:01,271 --> 01:57:04,391
were subjugated and starving,

1744
01:57:05,109 --> 01:57:09,489
then our empire beyond the seas,

1745
01:57:09,571 --> 01:57:13,611
armed and guarded by the British fleet,

1746
01:57:14,118 --> 01:57:17,958
- would carry on the struggle.
- Hear, hear!

1747
01:57:18,539 --> 01:57:20,789
Until, in God's good time,

1748
01:57:21,291 --> 01:57:26,121
the New World,
with all its power and might,

1749
01:57:26,630 --> 01:57:29,350
steps forth to the rescue

1750
01:57:29,425 --> 01:57:32,175
and the liberation of the old!

1751
01:58:09,381 --> 01:58:11,001
Bravo!

1752
01:58:11,091 --> 01:58:12,501
Victory!

1753
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:17,889
Victory! Victory!

1754
01:58:22,478 --> 01:58:24,068
Changed your mind?

1755
01:58:24,813 --> 01:58:26,683
Those who never change their mind

1756
01:58:27,149 --> 01:58:28,899
never change anything.

1757
01:58:32,154 --> 01:58:33,524
What just happened?

1758
01:58:34,615 --> 01:58:36,905
He mobilized the English language

1759
01:58:38,202 --> 01:58:40,112
and sent it into battle.
