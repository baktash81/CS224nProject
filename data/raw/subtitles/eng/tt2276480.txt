00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,250
(light dramatic music)

2
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:10,642
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,070
- [Narrator] Our story begins,

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,313
as so many do, in a doctor's office.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,930
- You're 100% sure, Doc?

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,770
- Well, in my line of work,

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,793
nothing's 100%, but I'm sure.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,063
Oh, we're having a boy.

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,570
- [Narrator] Which led to
one name being settled on,

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,797
a very popular name, as it turned out.

11
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:40,778
Max!

12
00:00:40,778 --> 00:00:41,730
I didn't do it!

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,680
Not you.

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,593
Max!

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,130
He bit me first!

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,380
No. Max Kuftinec!

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,010
Coming, Ms. Winter!

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,590
And in China, it's considered
polite to burp when you eat.

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,060
It shows you like the food.

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,479
Cool!

21
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,510
Gross.

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,150
Max, your father is
picking you up early today.

23
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,983
Get your things ready.

24
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:00,816
Yes, Ms. Winter.

25
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,170
Max, it's been nice
having you in my class.

26
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,870
I'll be back tomorrow, Ms. Winter.

27
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,770
Hey, we're just checking it out, okay?

28
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,763
No decisions yet.

29
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,950
Obviously Max is very bright.

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,160
What can you tell me about her

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,760
that her test scores can't? Hmm?

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,430
Well, uh, Max has always been...

33
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,640
She's been a self-starter ever since...

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,800
- [Narrator] Sarah felt
foolish reducing their daughter

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,110
to a bunch of words that
a thousand other parents

36
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,803
must have said about their kids.

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,933
We can't describe what's
so great about Max,

38
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,690
you know, any more than I can tell you

39
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,540
what's great about the color blue,

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,797
but you would be lucky to have her.

41
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:11,769
What do we do?

42
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:14,261
I don't know.

43
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,433
She's happy now.

44
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,663
I know.

45
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:26,340
And even with the scholarship,

46
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,600
we would still have to come up

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,130
with at least another couple thousand.

48
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,230
That's just this year.

49
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,220
Well, I could ask for a raise.

50
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,370
They just gave you one.

51
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,150
I could ask for a raise.

52
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,467
They owe me one.

53
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,783
I guess my first question is why?

54
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:58,103
I mean, I like PS 41.

55
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,180
And you always tell me how lucky we are

56
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,090
to have a great local public school.

57
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,660
Yes, and that's true,

58
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,420
but you're the smartest kid

59
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,550
in your class right now, right?

60
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,510
Maybe.

61
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,410
Well, maybe it would
be good to be somewhere

62
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,343
where you weren't the smartest kid.

63
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,433
Someone's gotta be.

64
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:17,462
I know, Max.

65
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:18,295
I know.

66
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:19,400
Who knows how far you could go in life?

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,630
We just want to give you
every opportunity to do that.

68
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,130
Right, and ultimately,
this is your decision.

69
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,210
Mm-hmm.

70
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,140
But Papa and I think this
would be very good for you,

71
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,800
and if you don't like it, you
can always go back to PS 41.

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,633
That's right.

73
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:36,610
Okay.

74
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,520
So how would I get there?

75
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,580
Okay. Well, you would take the subway,

76
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,003
and Papa would go with you.

77
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,083
When I can.

78
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,163
Hang on a sec.

79
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:46,710
What do you mean, "When I can"?

80
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,240
I can't be late to the
restaurant every day.

81
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,640
No, I'm not talking every day.

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,213
I'm talking a couple times a week.

83
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:52,118
Well, how... this is not
what we talked about.

84
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:53,076
It is what...

85
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:53,910
I told you...

86
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,253
Look. Look. Look.

87
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,450
I'll just go alone when
Papa can't take me.

88
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,990
It's fine.

89
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,823
It's fine.

90
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,703
I walk to PS 41 by myself.

91
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,183
I take care of Jez by myself.

92
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,843
I'm not a baby anymore.

93
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,300
- [Narrator] Tom lay in bed that night

94
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,500
wondering if they'd
made the right decision.

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,203
Sarah wondered if she
was a good parent or not.

96
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,680
Max wondered what the
library would be like

97
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,103
at the Blackstone Academy.

98
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,793
Jez slept.

99
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,374
I'm going to a new school today.

100
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:40,494
Really?

101
00:04:40,494 --> 00:04:41,835
Yes.

102
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:43,752
I'm not a baby anymore.

103
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
If I don't see my daughter,

104
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,290
at least I get to see
my granddaughter, huh?

105
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,010
It's your fault, Yaya.

106
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,220
Fault? How?

107
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,550
You were such a good cook that
you made Mama into a chef.

108
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,337
You're a tricky one, matia mou.

109
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,953
Your brains you get from your
mother, not from that one.

110
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:11,444
Go round and round.

111
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,723
Yaya's got no energy today.

112
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,010
Come on. Tea.

113
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,223
Let's get some tea.

114
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,483
So, this new school, it's better, right?

115
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:29,870
You know...

116
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,823
they're smart, they take you.

117
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,125
I don't know.

118
00:05:35,993 --> 00:05:36,826
I think it'll be good, but...

119
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,252
(speaking in foreign language)

120
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:42,330
Uh, I'm sorry.

121
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,750
I don't speak Greek.

122
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,713
You work in Greek cafe. Why?

123
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:48,260
I don't know.

124
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,213
Cold. Tea ice-cold!

125
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,828
I'm sorry.

126
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,028
I'll heat it up for you.

127
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,237
In Greece, never serve
tea like that, never.

128
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:02,330
But it was steaming in your...

129
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,683
Maxine, you don't contradict Yayas.

130
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,751
Maybe they teach you
that in your new school.

131
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,748
But I didn't...

132
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:10,581
Eh!

133
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:12,303
What I tell you all your life?

134
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,870
If you make a mistake, admit it.

135
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,030
Right. So?

136
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,233
I apologize, Yaya.

137
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,913
Good.

138
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,940
You're not a baby anymore, matia mou.

139
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,826
You must make your own decisions.

140
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:29,520
Like my Yaya said,

141
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:34,470
"You don't let life happen to you.

142
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,107
You happen to life."

143
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,177
Sounds better in Greek.

144
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,012
Hi.

145
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:53,845
Hey.

146
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,010
They're all freaked out about something.

147
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,753
They said the last thing they
could do is give me a raise.

148
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,990
So what do we do?

149
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,823
I don't know.

150
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,775
We could take out a loan.

151
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:10,775
Not with our credit.

152
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,590
Well, we could borrow money from somebody.

153
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,423
From who?

154
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,670
You want to go door-to-door
in the building,

155
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,410
ask people to loan money to the super?

156
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,843
You gotta get real here, Tom.

157
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,490
I'm gonna take extra shifts.

158
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:30,401
No.

159
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,532
There's no other option.

160
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,503
I love you so much.

161
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,250
There's nobody who's loved more than you

162
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,360
in this whole world.

163
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,280
You hear me?

164
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,337
I mean, there might be some
people loved as much as you,

165
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:16,620
but nobody is loved...

166
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,410
I know, Dad.

167
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,913
Now go away.

168
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:29,933
I hate it when you need them
more than they need you.

169
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,680
Laura Langer.

170
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,513
You're new here.

171
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,320
Tom Kuftinec.

172
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,193
You'll be happy here.

173
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:39,643
It's a great place.

174
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:43,291
And 40% of graduates go
to Ivy League schools.

175
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,648
Not that we're thinking
about that kind of thing yet.

176
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:48,481
Heh.

177
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:08,033
- [Narrator] A new routine was soon set.

178
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,240
Tom would drop Max off in the morning,

179
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,723
and she would come home
by herself after school.

180
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,730
Can't let things get you down.

181
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,588
Listen, things will get better.

182
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:35,638
No, but I'm telling you it's... Watch it!

183
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,280
No. It's a totally great show.

184
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,330
You have to watch it.

185
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,083
What are you wearing? (laughs)

186
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:08,154
Hey, Maxie.

187
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:08,987
Hi.

188
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,893
Hey, you want to come along?

189
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:12,940
I gotta fix the lock on 16D.

190
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,850
Um, no, thanks, Papa.

191
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,472
Hey, how was school today?

192
00:10:16,472 --> 00:10:17,363
Fine.

193
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,760
Well, what'd you do today?

194
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,593
Nothing.

195
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,080
Okay, I'll be back as soon as I can.

196
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,430
You call me if you need me.

197
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,253
Excellent.

198
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,140
There's a choice period
after lunch today, Max.

199
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,350
You might consider visiting
the chess club then.

200
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,055
There are other girls
there with your skills.

201
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,430
But I don't know how to play chess.

202
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,263
That's okay.

203
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:58,110
They can teach you.

204
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:00,852
Do you have a book that could teach me?

205
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:03,290
Heh. It's much better
to learn from a person.

206
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,180
The advisor is Mr. Eckhard.

207
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,523
He's an excellent teacher. Okay?

208
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,630
Before you came,

209
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,993
I was the third-best math
student in the class.

210
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,283
Now I'm the fourth.

211
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,807
And who might you be?

212
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:47,290
I'm Max Kuftinec.

213
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm here for the chess club?

214
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,919
Excellent.

215
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,924
What's your level?

216
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:51,924
I've actually never really...

217
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:53,210
Mr. Eckhard, Max is a friend of mine.

218
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,160
I'll play with her.

219
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,063
Well, thank you, Isabella.

220
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:58,563
That's very hospitable of you.

221
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,060
Let's see how smart you are now.

222
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,283
Go ahead. You're white.

223
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,643
Oh, my God.

224
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,933
You don't know how to play.

225
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,293
You don't even know how
to make the first move.

226
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,513
That's pathetic.

227
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,087
One day, I'm going to come back here,

228
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:23,233
and I'm going to teach you some manners.

229
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,013
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

230
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:30,600
What happened?

231
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,170
Why did she leave?

232
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,946
To be honest, Mr. Eckhard,

233
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:36,610
I don't think she liked you very much.

234
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,443
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:39,801
Hey, kids!

236
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:40,634
Hi.

237
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:42,680
Papa, do you think you could
teach me how to play...

238
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,513
Maxie, I gotta run.

239
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:45,890
Mrs. Rosenhirsch has mice.

240
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,290
One of them's in the bathtub

241
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,530
with Mrs. Rosenhirsch.

242
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,080
Okay, listen, if I'm not back by 7:00,

243
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,170
get dinner out of the fridge, okay?

244
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,670
I love you two! Call me
if you need me, all right?

245
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,863
Becky Langer.

246
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,083
Sophie Glass.

247
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,403
Isabella Diaz.

248
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,933
Max Kuftinec.

249
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,690
She's has a boy's first
name and a stupid last name.

250
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:38,534
I know it's hard to do,

251
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:40,130
but sometimes you gotta
take a chance, man.

252
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,940
Yeah, I know.

253
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,320
No, you should go for it.

254
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,316
It can't take too long to learn, can it?

255
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:49,116
I've always wanted to
learn another language.

256
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:50,330
Just find the right guy.

257
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,033
Pick the one you want to learn from.

258
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:55,283
All the little league coaches are good.

259
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,963
Go away.

260
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,003
You're still here.

261
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,800
Fine. Let's play.

262
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,460
I'll let you win,

263
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,140
for a while.

264
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,916
Costs five bucks.

265
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,540
I don't know how to play chess,

266
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,650
and I don't usually talk to strangers.

267
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,390
Not talking to strangers is smart,

268
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,120
but not playing chess, that's just stupid.

269
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,660
What's 25 times 14?

270
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,660
Something tells me I'm about to find out.

271
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,400
350, I'm not stupid.

272
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,750
Fine.

273
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,988
But you're, like, what, six years old,

274
00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:54,810
and you don't know how to play chess yet?

275
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,929
What kind of crappy school you go to?

276
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,490
I want to learn how to play,

277
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,120
and I'm not 6, I'm 10.

278
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,470
When I was 10, I was
carrying blocks of ice

279
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,028
up 5 flights of stairs.

280
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:09,120
I don't think that's possible

281
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,940
unless you're, like, 90.

282
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,628
Fine. My father did that, not me.

283
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:16,300
But I certainly knew how to
play chess when I was 10.

284
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,187
Hell, I won the city
tournament when I was 10.

285
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,409
Why don't you use that Google?

286
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:23,690
I hear it can teach you anything.

287
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,523
I don't know.

288
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:28,689
I just had a feeling you
might be able to teach me.

289
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:31,190
Plus you're two blocks from my house,

290
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,033
and you seem to have some free time.

291
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,490
Well, kid, you gotta play for something.

292
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,770
Any city kid knows that.

293
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,983
And these days, I play for money.

294
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:45,245
Hmph.

295
00:16:57,628 --> 00:16:59,463
Fashion show.

296
00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:00,546
Fashion show.

297
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,260
Max, how come Mama isn't
home for dinner anymore?

298
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,360
Because she's working.

299
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,200
Why does she work?

300
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,130
So she can make money for our family.

301
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,090
But Papa works, too.

302
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,940
Well, both Mama and Papa have to work

303
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,770
so that we have enough money.

304
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,090
Let's call Mama.

305
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,210
She's busy.

306
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,420
Then let's call Papa.

307
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,880
He's busy, too.

308
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,492
We should only call him
if it's an emergency.

309
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,140
Oh.

310
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,687
Then let's call Yaya.

311
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,466
All right.

312
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:43,085
Hi, Yaya.

313
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:45,309
I'm good.

314
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,649
Okay. Here.

315
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,470
Hi, Yaya.

316
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,380
Matia mou, what your
little sister doing awake?

317
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,460
It's after bedtime, right?

318
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,293
Yeah, but...

319
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,440
What, you have an excuse?

320
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,314
Sort of. I mean...

321
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:04,173
Matia mou, what I'm going to say?

322
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:06,270
You're going to tell
me not to make excuses.

323
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,940
I'll put her to bed now.

324
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,133
Good girl.

325
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,340
And you don't stay up late.

326
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Nothing good happens late.

327
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,740
Okay.

328
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,573
Matia mou, go.

329
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,718
Hi.

330
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:27,023
Hi.

331
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,323
How were the girls?

332
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,340
They were fine,

333
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,870
no problems.

334
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,110
Think they even remember my name?

335
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,003
They love you.

336
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,750
Sweetie, could you please
remove my shoes at some point?

337
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,320
It's $5.00.

338
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,380
I get a dollar a week.

339
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,063
I'll pay you the rest in two weeks.

340
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,450
At least you can do a little math.

341
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,030
It's lucky for you I'm such a softie.

342
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,840
But if anybody else
wants to play, you scram.

343
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,673
You got it?

344
00:19:19,673 --> 00:19:21,200
I'm not too worried about that.

345
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,540
You hear me?

346
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,720
Yeah, I scram.

347
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,550
Whatever that means.

348
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,830
Okay.

349
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,206
I'm Norman.

350
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:30,039
What's your name?

351
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,190
Max.

352
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,640
What's with names these days?

353
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,850
It's like roll call at a tenement in 1920.

354
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,843
Max, Samuel, Zachary, Nathan.

355
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,927
I'm gonna call you Shmuel.

356
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,950
I don't know if you noticed.

357
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,783
I'm a girl.

358
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,110
Come back tomorrow, Shmuel.

359
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,700
What?

360
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,860
You, (speaking in foreign language).

361
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,710
Why are you speaking Spanish?

362
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,480
Because you don't seem
to understand English.

363
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,600
And don't use that
Google to learn anything.

364
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,890
You told me before to use it.

365
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,980
You want to learn my way or their way?

366
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,100
Who's "they"?

367
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,437
Everybody else.

368
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:07,800
I don't know.

369
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,450
Whose way is better?

370
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,110
You want your money back?

371
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,943
Okay.

372
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,380
I won't use that Google.

373
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,438
Or that Bingo or that Skitter.

374
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:17,960
I have no idea what you're talking about.

375
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,053
Just don't.

376
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:21,358
I'll know if you do.

377
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:23,843
Now get out of here.

378
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,213
Come on. You can help me with this.

379
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:37,710
Just play along, okay?

380
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,630
Don't say anything.

381
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,463
Just look cute.

382
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,473
Hey!

383
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,800
Hey!

384
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,060
Look little sis, it's Jeremy Lin!

385
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,970
No, I'm not.

386
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,600
It's Jeremy Lin, your favorite
person in the whole world.

387
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,710
You were so sad when he left
the Knicks, but here he is!

388
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,980
Look, I'm not Jeremy...

389
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,120
Jeremy, it's so great that you're here.

390
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,310
My poor sister, she's been so sick.

391
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,860
Look, could you just
give her an autograph?

392
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,790
It'll mean the world to her.

393
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,113
Look, uh, I...

394
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:08,803
Just one autograph to make
a sick little girl happy.

395
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:11,532
Okay.

396
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,933
Here you go.

397
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:19,430
Thank you so much, Jeremy.

398
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,280
Hang on a minute.

399
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,670
That's not how you spell "Jeremy."

400
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,120
You're not really Jeremy Lin!

401
00:21:26,982 --> 00:21:29,520
Now look what you've done, fake Jeremy!

402
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,840
You've broken my little sister's heart.

403
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,440
Are you happy now?

404
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,390
No. I, I was trying to tell you I'm not.

405
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,130
Look, you gotta make this right.

406
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,833
Give me some money so I could
buy my sister some candy.

407
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,180
I don't know who you think you are,

408
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,410
impersonating Jeremy Lin in public

409
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,277
and misleading a little girl.

410
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:48,110
Here.

411
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,281
Here's a five, okay?

412
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:50,278
Okay?

413
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:51,273
I saw a 10 in there.

414
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,173
Fine, 10.

415
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,210
Give me half, or I'll tell your mom.

416
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,170
Here is two.

417
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,070
You didn't have to do anything.

418
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,170
Give me half, or I'll tell both your moms.

419
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,843
Fine.

420
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,277
Hey, how's that new
fancy-pants school of yours?

421
00:22:15,277 --> 00:22:17,302
No way it's better than PS 41.

422
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,900
I don't think it's better,

423
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,210
but it's different.

424
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,480
Are the kids smarter?

425
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,300
No, but they're more the same.

426
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,133
Of course they are.

427
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,520
They're all girls.

428
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,970
Yeah, but...

429
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,720
they're all the same kind of girls.

430
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,530
Hey, look. It's little orphan Annie.

431
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,630
Annie, I'd like you to meet my friend Mel.

432
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,820
Except he's not really a friend of mine.

433
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,700
And his name's not really Mel.

434
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,930
I got my allowance early.

435
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,662
Scram.

436
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:29,495
I was winning.

437
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:32,000
Bull oney, you were winning.

438
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,310
I was six moves from checkmating you.

439
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,413
I was four moves from checkmating you.

440
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,070
Oh, you couldn't beat me

441
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,583
if I gave you a bullwhip and Jake LaMotta.

442
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,930
I've been beating that guy
since before you were born.

443
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,983
That's not very long.

444
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,550
Okay, since before your father was born.

445
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,550
You got an answer for everything?

446
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,724
Most things.

447
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:57,360
Great.

448
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,453
Lucky for you I love kids so much.

449
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,283
Okay.

450
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:02,116
Let's get started.

451
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:04,760
What do you know about chess?

452
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,501
Not much.

453
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,601
Do you know how the different pieces move?

454
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,793
Not really.

455
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,617
Do you know what each piece is called?

456
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,290
Not precisely.

457
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,463
Not precisely.

458
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,630
Do you know anything about chess?

459
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,200
I know it's a good game for smart people.

460
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,233
Now that is the first sensible
thing I've heard you say.

461
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:27,423
Okay.

462
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,773
This is called a pawn.

463
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,190
It's barely worth the space it occupies,

464
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,303
a lot like a kid.

465
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,490
Like a kid, a pawn can't move very fast,

466
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,700
only one space at a time,

467
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,650
except for its first move,

468
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,600
when it can go two.

469
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:51,250
Like a kid, excited at first, then lazy.

470
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,053
Lucky for me you love kids so much.

471
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:55,986
You're a cocky kid.

472
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,670
Where'd you say you're from?

473
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,453
Over there, in the Village.

474
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,500
I grew up in Brooklyn.

475
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,063
Now Brooklyn's a place yuppies move to.

476
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:11,160
I didn't think there
were any city kids left.

477
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,876
What are you talking about?

478
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:14,094
There are lots of city.

479
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:16,694
Just living in the city
doesn't make you a city kid.

480
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,070
These kids might as
well be in Westchester.

481
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,883
Their nannies take 'em everywhere.

482
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,900
A city kid, he's cocky,

483
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,197
but not too cocky,

484
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:29,580
knows how to play things.

485
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,723
And a city kid sees the
way it all goes together.

486
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,410
You know what I'm talking about?

487
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,071
I think so.

488
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:39,890
Well, we'll find out.

489
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,930
You know why all the best players

490
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,214
are city kids?

491
00:25:42,214 --> 00:25:43,400
No.

492
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,100
Because they're used to
different kinds of people

493
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,500
bumping into each other every day

494
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,763
in different ways, always changing,

495
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,110
just like a chessboard.

496
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,830
What do you mean?

497
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,940
For instance, I already told
you pawns are like kids.

498
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,523
So this pawn is you.

499
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:08,110
You just started a new school,

500
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,600
so you move forward.

501
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,660
How'd you know I started a new school?

502
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,670
Your fancy new duds,

503
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,430
and you don't look very
comfortable in 'em.

504
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,773
Only, you're not sure
about this new school,

505
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,033
so you only go one square
forward instead of two.

506
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,120
Once you take your hand off
the piece, your move is done.

507
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,480
It's my turn.

508
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,191
I'm playing against you?

509
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:29,412
You're not playing yet.

510
00:26:29,412 --> 00:26:31,280
You're just moving the pieces.

511
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,760
Come back tomorrow.

512
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,840
One move a day is plenty.

513
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,440
One move a day?

514
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,273
Come on!

515
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:39,525
Go.

516
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:51,684
Okay, class, open to page 41, geography.

517
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,370
Today we're talking about
the United States of America,

518
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,130
but we're talking about
all of the Americas,

519
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,963
which includes.

520
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,023
Hold on just one second.

521
00:27:06,052 --> 00:27:07,290
Hi.

522
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,123
Hi. Yes.

523
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,852
Go away. Go away.

524
00:27:10,852 --> 00:27:11,850
Go away. Go away.

525
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,852
Go away. Go away.

526
00:27:12,852 --> 00:27:13,685
Go away.

527
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:18,587
Thank God.

528
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,293
Max, your father wants you to
wait for him here after class.

529
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,230
Class!

530
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,110
Girls, enough!

531
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,243
Let's get back to the lesson, okay?

532
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,760
You know, my bedroom window's stuck.

533
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,060
Maybe your dad can come
over later and fix it.

534
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:53,706
Maxie.

535
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:57,968
It's Yaya.

536
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:50,938
Hi.

537
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,060
Listen, honey, I know
you're having a tough time,

538
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,950
but it'll get better.

539
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,003
I promise.

540
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,710
I was just thinking about

541
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,333
how things always change, you know?

542
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,443
I was thinking about how we're all born,

543
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,373
and then we get older and older, until...

544
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:17,057
I can't stop thinking about it.

545
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,903
I see.

546
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,640
Well, you know I'm always
gonna be here for you,

547
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,703
and Mama's always gonna be here for you.

548
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,463
Not always.

549
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,323
As long as you need us, we'll be here.

550
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,400
I'm gonna sit over there for a bit

551
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,600
if that's okay with you.

552
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:49,744
All right?

553
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,246
That's right.

554
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:20,180
Another kid's coming at you.

555
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,030
What do you mean?

556
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,483
This is you, right?

557
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,640
You've stepped out on your own,

558
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,880
out onto an island a little bit,

559
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,350
and you could move further on your own,

560
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,860
but that'd be stupid, right?

561
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,420
Even you can see that.

562
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,243
So you take your best friend,

563
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,467
bring her up next to you.

564
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:42,700
I don't have a best friend.

565
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,900
Then any friend you
have at that new school.

566
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:47,809
I don't have any.

567
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:50,507
You don't have any?

568
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:52,037
Then you better get some.

569
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:54,593
You can't win a chess
game with just one piece.

570
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,073
Well, there's my little sister.

571
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,653
That's pathetic.

572
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,170
But you gotta move something.

573
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,020
Not that your little sis can
help you much over there.

574
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,113
Look, your board is your city,

575
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:15,560
and your city is your board.

576
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,146
You understand?

577
00:31:17,146 --> 00:31:20,188
No.

578
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:21,202
Never mind.

579
00:31:21,202 --> 00:31:22,207
That's enough for today.

580
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:23,040
Get out of here.

581
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,330
You can't just keep
moving your little sister.

582
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,110
Well, I'm thinking about
going back to my old school.

583
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,810
I have friends there.

584
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,250
They kicking you out of
that fancy new place?

585
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,463
No, I just don't know if
it's the right school for me.

586
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,100
So you're just gonna quit

587
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,390
before you give it a fair chance.

588
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,223
Right.

589
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:08,280
That's a great idea.

590
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,590
You're behind, so you should quit now.

591
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,040
I didn't say I was quitting.

592
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,513
Thinking about quitting
is the same as quitting.

593
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:20,823
Maybe you should just go
play checkers instead.

594
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:25,263
They play a lot of
checkers in Westchester.

595
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,730
Did you ever notice that Miss
Bailes looks like a walrus?

596
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,120
Heh. Not before,

597
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,443
but now I won't be able to
observe her without laughing.

598
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,573
Thanks a lot.

599
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,310
That's Becky.

600
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,213
She's got my back.

601
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,780
One final thing about pawns.

602
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,790
If a pawn manages to do something great,

603
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,580
if it gets all the way to the other side,

604
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,428
then it changes, turns into a queen.

605
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:24,640
So a worthless little kid
can turn into a queen.

606
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,250
Interesting.

607
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,083
Don't get too excited.

608
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,363
It almost never happens.

609
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,653
Okay, now that you're actually
moving more than one piece,

610
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,470
you gotta think strategically.

611
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:37,980
Strategically?

612
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,080
Yeah, you need a plan.

613
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,188
When you walk out the door,
you have a plan, right?

614
00:33:46,188 --> 00:33:47,330
You don't just walk outside

615
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,880
and wander around, do you?

616
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,166
Uh, no.

617
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,164
No.

618
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:52,583
So, what's your plan?

619
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,960
Um...

620
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,933
to move me and my friends forward?

621
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:01,206
All right.

622
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,706
I guess that's a plan, barely,

623
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,360
but you gotta keep an eye on the board,

624
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,993
come up with a new plan if things change.

625
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,853
But things always change.

626
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,833
That's right.

627
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,833
Things always change.

628
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,960
So what do you do about that?

629
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,653
I mean, what if you don't
want things to change?

630
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,013
Tough.

631
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,040
Forget it.

632
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,690
I don't know why I would ask you.

633
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,943
Hey, listen.

634
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,633
Change isn't a bad thing.

635
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,653
Sometimes it is.

636
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:48,625
Man, when was the last
time we had a date night?

637
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,730
I don't know. 1998?

638
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,210
Oh, it feels that way, doesn't it?

639
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,570
It probably has been a year.

640
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,050
That's so bad.

641
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:55,883
No, it's not bad.

642
00:34:55,883 --> 00:34:56,716
We're busy.

643
00:34:56,716 --> 00:34:58,340
Yeah. Everybody's busy, but you make time

644
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,110
for the things that are important,

645
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,000
and, you know, I can certainly

646
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,263
take a night off every six months.

647
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,810
You're not worried about
the babysitter, are you?

648
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,760
No. No, no, no.

649
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,286
She's fine.

650
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:14,284
Come on.

651
00:35:14,284 --> 00:35:15,286
Okay.

652
00:35:15,286 --> 00:35:17,422
I told you not to move!

653
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:18,943
You're a closet.

654
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,783
Closets don't move.

655
00:35:22,726 --> 00:35:24,640
She's right.

656
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,673
Closets don't move.

657
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,540
Dad?

658
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,373
Mom?

659
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,480
Are you asleep?

660
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,623
Why don't you answer?

661
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:12,204
Yaya?

662
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:13,420
Shh.

663
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,193
Don't wake up your sister.

664
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,833
Go back to sleep.

665
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:21,803
But you're dead.

666
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,773
Tell me something I don't know.

667
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,800
What are you doing here?

668
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,363
Sitting with you.

669
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:35,760
What, that's a problem?

670
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,963
Uh, no. No.

671
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,833
I got no other plans,

672
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,730
and I gotta keep an eye

673
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,923
on that lazy father of yours.

674
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,839
He's not lazy.

675
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,090
Well... Heh.

676
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,753
Go back to sleep.

677
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,520
Yaya?

678
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,807
Still here.

679
00:37:07,807 --> 00:37:10,973
You know, if you were
anyone else sitting there,

680
00:37:10,973 --> 00:37:13,193
I'd be pretty scared right now.

681
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,163
I mean, you're dead.

682
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,450
That would be really scary,

683
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,500
to have a dead person sitting in my room.

684
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,243
Mm, yes, that would be really scary.

685
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,567
So are you a ghost?

686
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:32,400
No. No, no.

687
00:37:33,776 --> 00:37:35,440
You know better than that.

688
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,173
I'm just a pigment of your imagination.

689
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,240
I always thought the word was "figment."

690
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,713
Maxine, you don't correct Yayas.

691
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,213
Okay.

692
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,798
Well, good night, Yaya.

693
00:37:55,798 --> 00:37:57,631
Good night, matia mou.

694
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:02,007
♪ Tic, tac, toe ♪

695
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:03,869

698

Hey, that's weird.

699
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,270
Look at Olive.

700
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,830
Yeah.

701
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,000
Why isn't she with the rest

702
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,973
of her catastrophic friends?

703
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,750
Go over and talk to her.

704
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:23,630
Why?

705
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,363
You go over and talk to her if you want.

706
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,420
No, you do it.

707
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,630
You're prettier than me.

708
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,780
She'll like you better.

709
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:32,806
Okay.

710
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:36,460
Tell her you like her drawings.

711
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,460
She's proud of them.

712
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:44,995
Cool.

713
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:46,078
Cool animals.

714
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,663
So, any ideas on your move?

715
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,600
Why do you seem so excited today?

716
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,210
You're never excited.

717
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,533
Because I see a piece

718
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:20,833
that's been left out
alone to fend for itself.

719
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,767
So what are you gonna do?

720
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,090
Becky's gonna take it

721
00:39:29,571 --> 00:39:30,571
like she took Olive.

722
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,530
Wow.

723
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,200
Downtown.

724
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,800
I've been downtown,
like, twice in my life.

725
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,070
What's it like down there?

726
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,160
It must be mesmerizing.

727
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,300
It's nice.

728
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,760
I mean, it's a little
busier than it is up here.

729
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,740
I wish I lived downtown.

730
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,587
And I cannot believe your parents

731
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:59,050
let you ride home on
the subway by yourself.

732
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,340
That is totally scintillating.

733
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,173
I guess.

734
00:40:02,173 --> 00:40:04,550
There's no way my mom
would let me do that.

735
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,890
I'm not allowed on the
streets without a grown-up,

736
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,150
and she won't let me
ride the subway at all.

737
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,160
You've never been on the subway?

738
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,672
Nobody I know gets to ride the subway.

739
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:15,890
So do you want to come over to my place

740
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,051
with your nanny on Friday?

741
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:21,540
Uh, why don't we go somewhere fun instead?

742
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,192
Home is so boring.

743
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:25,180
Yeah, that's a stunning idea!

744
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,230
Your nanny can take us
and drop me off at home

745
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,531
when we're done.

746
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:30,320
Uh, my nanny's no fun.

747
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,140
She doesn't do anything.

748
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,573
It's got to be your nanny.

749
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,750
Okay.

750
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,583
Becky!

751
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,423
Gotta go.

752
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,891
Your dad has a nice car.

753
00:40:41,891 --> 00:40:43,003
Dad?

754
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,383
You're funny.

755
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,380
The rook,

756
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,480
also known as a castle.

757
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,690
Cool.

758
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,933
A good piece, useful piece.

759
00:40:59,933 --> 00:41:01,593
Now go learn about it.

760
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,355
What are you talking about?

761
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:05,640
Go out there.

762
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,152
Find a castle.

763
00:41:07,152 --> 00:41:08,523
Learn how the piece moves.

764
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,110
Let me get this straight.

765
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:15,010
To learn how this piece
moves on a chessboard,

766
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,651
I'm supposed to go look around
New York City for a castle?

767
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:19,310
Right.

768
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,650
And somehow that's going
to teach me something?

769
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,250
Yeah, if you got your eyes open.

770
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,230
Look, you can learn my way,

771
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,310
or you can learn from somebody else.

772
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,829
Well, can you at least give me a hint

773
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:32,490
about what I'm looking for?

774
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,323
A hint?

775
00:41:33,323 --> 00:41:35,710
You mean, like, is it
bigger than a bread box?

776
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,730
Bigger than an Xbox?

777
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,630
What's an Xbox?

778
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,630
What's a bread box?

779
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,690
Oh, get out of here.

780
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:46,441
Xbox.

781
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:08,465
It's gonna take a little imagination.

782
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:09,850
Do you have a little imagination?

783
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,460
I'm a 10-year-old girl.

784
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,293
What do you think?

785
00:42:12,293 --> 00:42:14,550
Then stop being so literal.

786
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,420
Chess player needs to think creatively.

787
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,704
And don't come back till you find it.

788
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,453
You need to be inspired.

789
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,573
Inspired?

790
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,950
Sweetie, I am sorry,
but we just can't do it.

791
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,181
And I gotta get back to work, so kiss.

792
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,080
Come on.

793
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,913
Just one day.

794
00:42:40,913 --> 00:42:42,621
Honey, we can't afford a nanny.

795
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:43,454
We just can't.

796
00:42:43,454 --> 00:42:45,580
Don't you want me to have playdates?

797
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,840
Or would you rather I just be a hermit

798
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,940
for the rest of my life?

799
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,100
Of course we want you to have playdates.

800
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,110
Well, other parents don't let their kids

801
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,260
walk the streets alone.

802
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,980
Look, it's great that you trust me.

803
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,600
This isn't about you.

804
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,680
I can't have a playdate without a nanny.

805
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,480
Okay, Here's an idea.

806
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,100
What if my sister picked you up one day?

807
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,600
She said she'd be happy to
do it if we ever needed her.

808
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,125
No. No one has their aunt pick them up.

809
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:11,920
That's so uncool.

810
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,480
What do you care what people think?

811
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,690
That doesn't matter.

812
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,163
Dad, I'm 10 years old.

813
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:17,660
It matters.

814
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,320
I need a nanny to pick me up,

815
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,070
not my Aunt Diane.

816
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,403
Why can't Aunt Diane be your nanny?

817
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,050
Are you sure your nanny
is coming today, Max?

818
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,150
You could always just
come over to our house.

819
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,160
Oh, no, she's definitely coming.

820
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,263
She's very reliable.

821
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,930
Mom, you don't have to remain here.

822
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,110
I'm sorry, honey.

823
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:49,310
I know it's embarrassing to you,

824
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,890
but I don't let my
daughter walk the streets

825
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,200
with someone I haven't met.

826
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,033
Hey, Max!

827
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,693
Come on.

828
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:00,640
You have to be my nanny.

829
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,400
Oh, yeah, I heard, so I'm not your aunt.

830
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,300
I'm just your nanny.

831
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,464
Got it.

832
00:44:05,464 --> 00:44:06,297
And you can't be American.

833
00:44:06,297 --> 00:44:07,820
Nannies are never American,

834
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,690
unless they're young dancers.

835
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,690
I've got a dancer's body.

836
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,170
They're in their 20s.

837
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,803
I've got a dancer's body, okay?

838
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,860
This is my nanny, Diane.

839
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,960
Hi, Diane.

840
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,290
Uh, (speaking in foreign language).

841
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,233
Oh, no. No.

842
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,520
(speaking in foreign language)

843
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,320
Oh. Well, where are you from?

844
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,860
Oh, I from.

845
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,800
Eh, I from Kazakhstan.

846
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:45,276
(speaking in foreign language)

847
00:44:45,276 --> 00:44:50,276
Um... Ahem.

848
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,130
So, Diane,

849
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:56,020
where do you take the girls today?

850
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,960
Uh, I take girls,

851
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,950
eh, wherever they want to go,

852
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,000
except if it not safe.

853
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,453
Then I do not take them.

854
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,583
Excuse me one second.

855
00:45:10,413 --> 00:45:11,496
Is she drunk?

856
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,063
Well, have fun.

857
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,980
Call me at the first sign of trouble.

858
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:31,844
(upbeat music)

859
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:08,197
I mean, can you believe it?

860
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:09,735
You know, I can't believe he'd do it.

861
00:46:09,735 --> 00:46:12,485
I still have to throw things out.

862
00:46:13,414 --> 00:46:15,664
He's watching the
decluttering show, I guess.

863
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,263
Oh, I gotta refill my MetroCard.

864
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,713
I forgot my wallet.

865
00:46:27,861 --> 00:46:29,083
Do you have any money?

866
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,223
Jeez.

867
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,220
Your mom's going to kill me.

868
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,260
Okay.

869
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,830
My student MetroCard can be
used once every 17 minutes,

870
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,080
so we'll just wait for that.

871
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,550
No. I'm not gonna use your
student MetroCard, okay?

872
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:41,433
That's illegal.

873
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,213
Come on.

874
00:46:43,213 --> 00:46:44,046
No one's watching.

875
00:46:44,046 --> 00:46:46,143
They have cameras everywhere.

876
00:46:46,143 --> 00:46:48,410
There aren't any cameras here.

877
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,320
No, they disguise them, see?

878
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,630
You can't trust 'em.

879
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,463
You don't realize that.

880
00:46:52,463 --> 00:46:53,860
You didn't live through the '60s.

881
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,803
Neither did you.

882
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,420
Come on already.

883
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,603
No, put that away!

884
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,863
Okay. Then ask for some money.

885
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,163
Excuse me.

886
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,023
This is ridiculous.

887
00:47:09,023 --> 00:47:10,683
Excuse me!

888
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,080
My aunt needs to borrow a couple dollars.

889
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,670
You should be ashamed of yourself,

890
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,390
bringing your little girl out here to beg!

891
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:19,503
Disgraceful.

892
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,200
I could've taken the subway by myself.

893
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,560
I do it every day.

894
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,070
No. Not when I'm supposed
to be watching you.

895
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,147
I'd never hear the end of it.

896
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:37,410
"Diane, just 'cause you
decided not to have kids

897
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,873
doesn't mean you can just..."

898
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,810
What?

899
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,660
Inspired.

900
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,493
What?

901
00:47:45,439 --> 00:47:47,359
It's a castle.

902
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,192
Heh.

903
00:47:48,192 --> 00:47:49,910
No, that's a church.

904
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,810
You don't have much of an imagination.

905
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,943
This is strange.

906
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,673
Yeah.

907
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,763
I'm going to move him to here.

908
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,713
Then next turn, I can capture the pawn.

909
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:55,420
Good.

910
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,930
Now I want you to learn
how to move the knight.

911
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,130
Listen, Norman, this has been,

912
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,780
uh, interesting,

913
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,110
but you could save us both some time

914
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,260
by just telling me how.

915
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,380
I could teach you all the
rules of chess in two minutes,

916
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,680
but the rules are nothing.

917
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,733
What's important is how you see the board.

918
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,270
Now tell me about the rook.

919
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,880
It sweeps across the
board in straight lines.

920
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,750
See? I'm teaching you how
to see the whole board,

921
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,610
not just a single piece.

922
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,283
Anybody can move a piece.

923
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,890
Takes a city kid to make sense

924
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,083
of what seems like chaos.

925
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,980
And I could tell you
that this is a good move,

926
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,930
but you would learn absolutely nothing.

927
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,000
Is it better to earn five bucks

928
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,620
or to find it in the street?

929
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,440
Finding it in the street would be okay,

930
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,950
especially if it kept
me from running around

931
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,020
like a crazy person.

932
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,580
You're not a crazy person.

933
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,763
You're a weird person,

934
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,500
like most good chess players.

935
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,240
I'm not a good chess player.

936
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,943
Not yet, but you might be someday

937
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:08,563
if you learn my way.

938
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,530
I gotta admit that was a pretty cool way

939
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:13,730
to learn about the rook.

940
00:50:15,002 --> 00:50:16,963
How did you do that, anyway?

941
00:50:17,823 --> 00:50:18,656
Eh.

942
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:22,750
So tell me about the knight.

943
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:25,970
An unusual piece.

944
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,323
Moves very strangely.

945
00:50:28,463 --> 00:50:30,110
How?

946
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,190
Your board, your city.

947
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,323
So what am I supposed to do,

948
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:36,940
go look for a knight or a horse?

949
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,180
Figure it out yourself.

950
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,423
That's the whole point.

951
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,837
Don't let life happen to you.

952
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:46,373
You happen to life.

953
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:49,823
Now get out of here.

954
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:52,743
Scram.

955
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:02,369
(upbeat music)

956
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,743
You look like a knight.

957
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,253
Okay.

958
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,350
Can I ask you a question?

959
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,270
Yeah, her name's Andromeda.

960
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,842
Who?

961
00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:29,279
It's the horse.

962
00:51:29,279 --> 00:51:31,510
That's what you were gonna ask me, right?

963
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:32,893
Um, no.

964
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,933
I wanted to ask how you, uh, move.

965
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,230
How I move?

966
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,690
Yeah.

967
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,293
Do you have a special way you move?

968
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:47,400
I don't know what you're
talking about, kid.

969
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,470
Right.

970
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:49,953
Well, sorry.

971
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:56,663
Max, that would've been too easy,

972
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,670
but here's a clue.

973
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:02,170
You look for horses that really move.

974
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:35,420
Hey, bug, stop running back and forth.

975
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,820
You know how much Mr.
Shawn downstairs hates it.

976
00:52:41,983 --> 00:52:42,816
Hey, Bug!

977
00:52:42,816 --> 00:52:44,180
Do you want us all to go to jail?

978
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,293
Kids don't go to jail,
Papa, they go to juvie.

979
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,263
30,000.

980
00:52:51,263 --> 00:52:53,130
What's that, a math problem?

981
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,470
Sort of.

982
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,540
How long do you think it would take

983
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,193
to count to 30,000, Papa?

984
00:52:58,121 --> 00:52:59,340
I don't know.

985
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,823
Couple hours, maybe, why?

986
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,630
Because that's how many days
an average person lives 30,000.

987
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,490
That's it.

988
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:13,313
And I've already used up,
like 4,000 days, almost.

989
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,150
Maxie, I...

990
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,170
I don't know what to tell you, honey.

991
00:53:21,221 --> 00:53:22,661
Nothing, Papa.

992
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:23,494
Nothing.

993
00:53:27,056 --> 00:53:28,063
Papa.

994
00:53:28,063 --> 00:53:29,061
Yeah, Maxie.

995
00:53:29,061 --> 00:53:30,183
Where are those horses racing?

996
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,213
Oh, that's from today's races at Aqueduct.

997
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,730
Where's Aqueduct?

998
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:36,593
It's in Queens.

999
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,010
This is ridiculous.

1000
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,440
Look, I asked you because I thought

1001
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,620
you wouldn't be scared to do this.

1002
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,180
If you want to go back.

1003
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,640
Please, don't play your
fourth-grade mind games on me.

1004
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,473
Let's go.

1005
00:53:58,303 --> 00:54:00,794
So what's happening at PS 41 these days?

1006
00:54:00,794 --> 00:54:02,830
Same as usual.

1007
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,880
Oh, uh, there's a new gym teacher.

1008
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,970
Coach Z left?

1009
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:06,803
Yeah.

1010
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:08,680
And, uh, the new gym teacher's a girl.

1011
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,520
Wow, that's cool.

1012
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,519
No, it's lame.

1013
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:15,903
Whoever heard of a girl gym teacher?

1014
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:18,610
Oh, and the chess team

1015
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:20,780
just finished second
at city championships.

1016
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,720
Really?

1017
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,599
Maybe I'll play against them someday.

1018
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,432
Heh.

1019
00:54:24,432 --> 00:54:25,265
They'll kick your butt.

1020
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:26,098
They're good.

1021
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,973
I said I was sorry.

1022
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,266
Could have made us some fake IDs.

1023
00:54:40,266 --> 00:54:41,870
I'm sorry.

1024
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,870
I didn't realize you
had to be 18 to get in.

1025
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:49,210
Well, will you at least tell
me now why we came here?

1026
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,050
We came to watch the horses.

1027
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:54,300
Of course we came here
to watch the horses.

1028
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,680
Why?

1029
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,330
To see how they move,

1030
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,413
what direction.

1031
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:04,200
They move around the track in a circle.

1032
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,562
Well, it's not exactly a circle.

1033
00:55:06,562 --> 00:55:07,395
Okay. An oval.

1034
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,020
Please don't tell me that's
all you needed to know.

1035
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,170
Only $1.00!

1036
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,003
Get it here!

1037
00:55:20,003 --> 00:55:20,836
Get it now!

1038
00:55:20,836 --> 00:55:24,130
Get it while it's still on
ice, ladies and gentlemen.

1039
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:27,043
So, moving in an oval.

1040
00:55:30,082 --> 00:55:31,570
You know, some people might
think it was a bad idea

1041
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:34,040
to send a 10 year-old-kid to a racetrack.

1042
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,450
I didn't send you to a racetrack.

1043
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,320
You sent yourself.

1044
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,900
It's a small horse.

1045
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,240
You have to make a small oval.

1046
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,433
Think of a horse in the city.

1047
00:55:45,648 --> 00:55:46,481
It can't cut through a block.

1048
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:48,883
It's gotta make turns at the corner.

1049
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,490
Try going a different way.

1050
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:58,033
Okay. I got it.

1051
00:55:59,112 --> 00:55:59,945
What's next?

1052
00:56:25,123 --> 00:56:27,580
I want to see your diarrhea.

1053
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,413
You mean diary.

1054
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:50,300
Mmm, macaroni and dirt, my favorite.

1055
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,980
Not macaroni and dirt,
Papa, macaroni and cheese!

1056
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,550
Mm-mm-mm. I saw Mama
cooking it this morning,

1057
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,683
and this is definitely macaroni and dirt.

1058
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:01,083
You're silly, Papa.

1059
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:07,350
Papa, why doesn't Mama eat
dinner with us anymore?

1060
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:09,320
Because Mama's gotta work, bug.

1061
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,230
What's Mama's work?

1062
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:14,040
I've told you before,
bug, she cooks for people.

1063
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,600
She cooks for us.

1064
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,780
Why does she have to cook
for other people, too?

1065
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,860
Well, it's complicated, honey.

1066
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,730
It's not that complicated.

1067
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,330
Jez, other people give her
money to cook for them.

1068
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:27,800
Unless you have any money to give her,

1069
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,560
she can't just cook for you.

1070
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,810
I have some money.

1071
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:31,730
No, you don't.

1072
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:32,563
Yes, I do.

1073
00:57:32,563 --> 00:57:35,107
I have a nickel and a penny and a dollar.

1074
00:57:35,107 --> 00:57:35,940
That's not real money.

1075
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,907
That's just like.

1076
00:57:36,907 --> 00:57:38,120
Jesus, Max, stop!

1077
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,933
Yeah, Max, cheeses!

1078
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,957
Hey, hey, both of you!

1079
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:45,383
The important thing is
that both of you girls know

1080
00:57:45,383 --> 00:57:46,610
that your Mama loves you more

1081
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:49,267
than anything in the world, okay?

1082
00:57:49,267 --> 00:57:52,488
And when you eat the food
that she cooks for you,

1083
00:57:52,488 --> 00:57:55,033
it's like you're eating her love.

1084
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,328
That's kinda gross.

1085
00:57:59,328 --> 00:58:01,245
I'm not hungry anymore.

1086
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:08,583
Okay.

1087
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:09,416
You're ready.

1088
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:13,010
Make your own move, any piece you like.

1089
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,534
Are we going to play?

1090
00:58:14,534 --> 00:58:16,400
No, we're just going to work on openings,

1091
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,690
just the first five moves.

1092
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:21,210
But I'm ready to play a real game.

1093
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,510
I know how to move all the pieces.

1094
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,030
Fine. If you're ready to play a real game,

1095
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:27,253
then you don't need me anymore.

1096
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,660
I know how to drive a car.

1097
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,660
Doesn't mean I'm ready for the Indy 500.

1098
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,213
What do I move first?

1099
00:58:37,068 --> 00:58:38,450
What are you, two years old?

1100
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,093
Pick a piece, and move it.

1101
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:45,420
Brilliant move.

1102
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,620
People will be talking
about it for decades.

1103
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:59,880
Now, we already talked about
the Earth and the moon, right?

1104
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,880
The sun is 4.5 billion years old.

1105
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,483
Know what else is 4.5 billion years old?

1106
00:59:09,332 --> 00:59:10,290
What?

1107
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,243
Those shoes.

1108
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,880
Hey, do you want do some
more exploring today?

1109
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,830
Well, I kinda have to play chess today.

1110
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,340
I can play chess.

1111
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,380
For real?

1112
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,686
Like, can you play well?

1113
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:34,010
No, but I can play a little.

1114
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:36,390
Great. Will your mom let you come?

1115
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:39,023
I told her your ludicrous
nanny was picking us up.

1116
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,463
I don't think that word means
what you think it means.

1117
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:48,090
You ever think about
how random things are?

1118
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:50,413
I mean, Isabella could
have been my best friend

1119
00:59:50,413 --> 00:59:51,513
instead of you.

1120
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,573
I doubt that.

1121
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:00,680
What I'm saying is that everything in life

1122
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,660
is just...

1123
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,373
I don't know, luck.

1124
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:06,450
Those people could have been my parents.

1125
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,240
That could have been my grandmother.

1126
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:18,097
Or I might have had two dads

1127
01:00:20,264 --> 01:00:21,723
and maybe lived somewhere else.

1128
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,150
For that matter, I could have been a boy.

1129
01:00:30,953 --> 01:00:32,020
Eww.

1130
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,510
I mean, why is your name Becky?

1131
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,830
Because Rebecca is too long and boring.

1132
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,320
What's your point?

1133
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,673
Nothing. Come on.

1134
01:00:46,937 --> 01:00:48,107
Great.

1135
01:00:48,107 --> 01:00:49,860
Two six-year-olds.

1136
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,300
That should equal one 12 year-old.

1137
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,800
We're not six years.

1138
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,270
Don't bother.

1139
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:55,770
Here's how I'm starting today.

1140
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,190
Pawn to E3.

1141
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,907
Almost as earthshaking
as your last opening.

1142
01:01:02,907 --> 01:01:03,910
E3?

1143
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,660
That's how you describe moves.

1144
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,057
The squares go across from A to H,

1145
01:01:08,057 --> 01:01:10,207
and the squares up and
down go from 1 to 8,

1146
01:01:11,348 --> 01:01:13,130
so that square is E3.

1147
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:15,150
Hey, I'm impressed.

1148
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:17,050
You can count to eight.

1149
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:17,883
Just ignore him.

1150
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,303
Not terrible.

1151
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,513
Actually, not terrible.

1152
01:01:48,585 --> 01:01:49,418
Papa!

1153
01:01:54,747 --> 01:01:56,060
Max?

1154
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:56,893
Max.

1155
01:01:59,120 --> 01:01:59,953
Hey.

1156
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,793
Come on, Maxie.

1157
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:03,626
Talk to me.

1158
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,820
Did you know that the sun
is 4.5 billion years old

1159
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,913
and that in another 5 billion
years, it'll burn out?

1160
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,610
I don't think we need to
worry about that, honey.

1161
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:24,443
Why not?

1162
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,743
Because we won't be here.

1163
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:29,943
But where will I be, Dad?

1164
01:02:31,035 --> 01:02:32,883
Where will I be in 5 billion years?

1165
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,963
I don't know, honey.

1166
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:40,910
But I can promise you one thing.

1167
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:45,053
Wherever you are, I'm gonna be there, too.

1168
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:46,903
Huh?

1169
01:02:51,536 --> 01:02:53,912
How 'bout a little beard scratch?

1170
01:02:53,912 --> 01:02:54,745
Heh.

1171
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,820
Dad.

1172
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,150
Yeah, honey?

1173
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,393
I wish I didn't think about these things.

1174
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,170
I know, honey.

1175
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:12,993
I think about 'em sometimes, too.

1176
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,270
But you know when I never do?

1177
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,390
When I'm with you and your sister.

1178
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:22,203
That must mean something, right?

1179
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,663
Good night, sweetie.

1180
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,673
Hey.

1181
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,970
Hey!

1182
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:03,803
What's going on?

1183
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,847
I told him we could only
play the first five moves,

1184
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:08,513
but he wouldn't stop.

1185
01:04:09,477 --> 01:04:10,933
We'll stop when I'm ahead.

1186
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,540
It doesn't look like that
is ever gonna happen.

1187
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:16,373
Scram.

1188
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:18,343
Scram!

1189
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:20,283
Come on!

1190
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,013
All right,

1191
01:04:23,013 --> 01:04:25,203
we're gonna play the first 20 moves each.

1192
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:28,740
Try not to lose before then.

1193
01:04:36,378 --> 01:04:37,278
Hello.

1194
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:38,111
Hey.

1195
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,155
How were the girls?

1196
01:04:42,155 --> 01:04:42,988
Oh, fine.

1197
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,240
Do you remember when Max was born,

1198
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,210
like five minutes ago?

1199
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:51,610
I remember three minutes
ago, when Jez was born.

1200
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,390
They're closing the restaurant.

1201
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,210
When?

1202
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,150
It's already done.

1203
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,500
You know, apparently
they've been losing money.

1204
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,963
But they offered me a
job at their other place.

1205
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,053
In Boston?

1206
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,330
No, no, no. You could get a
job at another restaurant here.

1207
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:16,556
There's nothing out there.

1208
01:05:16,556 --> 01:05:18,180
You know how many people
were coming in every day

1209
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,020
looking for work?

1210
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,130
It's just.

1211
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:22,833
We are really lucky they
offered me this Boston gig.

1212
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,400
Well, then you could not
work for a while, then.

1213
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,900
Yeah, so we can not pay
Max's tuition for a while.

1214
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,160
I know how to rotate my schedule.

1215
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,390
I can come back twice a month.

1216
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:36,260
The Chinese bus is only $15.

1217
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,860
They need me to start next week.

1218
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,407
Well, you thought of everything then.

1219
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,323
Are you mad at me?

1220
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,060
You think I want to do this?

1221
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:50,373
You know, I think you don't
want to talk about it,

1222
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:51,630
is what I think.

1223
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:54,060
What is the point of
going round and round?

1224
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,790
You're gonna change your mind five times

1225
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,193
when we both know this
is the right thing to do.

1226
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,908
Great. Fine.

1227
01:06:00,908 --> 01:06:02,260
Fine. It's not like the kids

1228
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:04,060
see you around here anyway, so fine.

1229
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,153
Oh.

1230
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:13,343
If you had a decent job,

1231
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,950
I wouldn't have to do this.

1232
01:06:33,129 --> 01:06:33,962
Mama?

1233
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:38,785
Who's awake down there?

1234
01:06:38,785 --> 01:06:40,368
What are you doing?

1235
01:06:44,427 --> 01:06:47,373
You have tiger scratches.

1236
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,503
I also have a secret I want to tell you.

1237
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:56,993
I love somebody in this room.

1238
01:06:58,062 --> 01:06:58,895
Is it me?

1239
01:06:59,769 --> 01:07:01,617
You guessed it.

1240
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:04,693
Actually, I love two people in this room.

1241
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:07,987
I love you, and I love Max.

1242
01:07:09,653 --> 01:07:13,147
You also love yourself,
so that's three people.

1243
01:07:13,147 --> 01:07:16,320
Right, but I love you and Max

1244
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,313
and Papa even more than I love myself.

1245
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,530
Me, too, Mama.

1246
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:26,670
I can't stop loving you.

1247
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:27,883
Ohh.

1248
01:07:27,883 --> 01:07:29,683
How'd I get so lucky?

1249
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,990
Tell me a story, Mama.

1250
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:35,407
Okay. What about?

1251
01:07:37,215 --> 01:07:42,215
About Cinderella, Ariel,
Spider-Man, and Max.

1252
01:07:44,487 --> 01:07:45,723
And Max, okay.

1253
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,760
Well, one day, Cinderella, Ariel, and Max

1254
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,190
were walking through the park,

1255
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:58,090
and all of a sudden,
Spider-Man went swinging by.

1256
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,423
And Spider-Man stopped
as soon as he saw Max,

1257
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:04,907
because he knew he needed her
for a very important mission.

1258
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:08,090
I wouldn't have done that.

1259
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:11,630
So you've learned how to move the pieces.

1260
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,500
I've been taking lessons.

1261
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,960
I'm ready to play you.

1262
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,180
Who've you been studying with?

1263
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:18,520
He can't be better than my teacher,

1264
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,880
Vadim Alexeyevich.

1265
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,510
I'm sure you know who that is.

1266
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:23,020
He teaches me in Russian.

1267
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,540
You speak Russian?

1268
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,520
Not really,

1269
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,510
but he's such a genius,
it doesn't even matter.

1270
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:31,410
Anyway, why should I play you?

1271
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:32,750
What's in it for me?

1272
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,960
At this school, I'm here, and you're here.

1273
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,990
You're scared.

1274
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:38,500
Please.

1275
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,630
Okay.

1276
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,330
If you win, I'll leave the school.

1277
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:44,600
And if you win,

1278
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,540
which could only happen
if I go into a coma.

1279
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,900
Then you have to leave the school.

1280
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,790
Not a chance.

1281
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:51,730
Okay.

1282
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:53,503
Then you have to stop bothering me.

1283
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,460
That's pretty broad.

1284
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,160
I'll stop insulting you in public.

1285
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:00,363
That's acceptable.

1286
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,297
Okay.

1287
01:10:08,297 --> 01:10:10,400
Today I'm gonna go first.

1288
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,619
Listen, Norman, I need
to tell you something.

1289
01:10:12,619 --> 01:10:13,580
Tell me later.

1290
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,413
Move first.

1291
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,590
I'm going to play a real chess match.

1292
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:18,560
The hell you are.

1293
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,880
No, I am.

1294
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,830
I'm going to play against someone else.

1295
01:10:23,006 --> 01:10:23,839
What?

1296
01:10:23,839 --> 01:10:26,174
I'm going to play a real chess match

1297
01:10:26,174 --> 01:10:27,420
against someone else.

1298
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,505
I told you you weren't ready.

1299
01:10:29,505 --> 01:10:31,123
Well, I thought I was.

1300
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:36,579
Then I guess we're done.

1301
01:11:08,006 --> 01:11:08,919
Hey, Maxie.

1302
01:11:08,919 --> 01:11:09,752
How was school today?

1303
01:11:09,752 --> 01:11:10,863
It was fine.

1304
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,334
Yeah? What'd you do?

1305
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:15,540
The usual,

1306
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,188
nothing.

1307
01:11:17,188 --> 01:11:18,583
I see.

1308
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:23,593
Hey, Maxie, do you like your new school?

1309
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:27,553
You're not supposed to like school, Papa.

1310
01:11:27,553 --> 01:11:28,386
Oh, really?

1311
01:11:28,386 --> 01:11:30,343
At best, you're supposed to tolerate it.

1312
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:32,253
Okay, then.

1313
01:11:32,253 --> 01:11:34,393
Do you tolerate your new school?

1314
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,253
I tolerate it.

1315
01:11:37,257 --> 01:11:39,303
That's good,

1316
01:11:39,303 --> 01:11:40,513
I guess.

1317
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,960
You know, parents, they always think

1318
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,110
they know better than their kids.

1319
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:46,943
Duh.

1320
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,680
And they do for a while,

1321
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,870
but pretty soon you're
gonna be coming home

1322
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:55,760
with math homework that
I don't understand,

1323
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,620
that you're gonna know the
right answer way before I do.

1324
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,033
You know what I mean?

1325
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,283
I'm only doing multiplication.

1326
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:05,803
It's a metaphor.

1327
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,280
Oh.

1328
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,430
I don't like metaphors.

1329
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,153
All right, listen.

1330
01:12:14,153 --> 01:12:15,350
I'll be back in a few
minutes, okay, honey?

1331
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:16,933
You call me if you need me.

1332
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,403
Sleep.

1333
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,230
Sleep, matia mou.

1334
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:41,576
I might have made a mistake, Yaya.

1335
01:12:43,188 --> 01:12:44,523
Everybody makes mistakes.

1336
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,823
Your mother married your father.

1337
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,950
Why do you keep doing that?

1338
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,081
Habit.

1339
01:12:55,081 --> 01:12:57,620
Don't worry about it.

1340
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:00,453
Make the best choice you can.

1341
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,650
That's what your mother did
when she went to Boston.

1342
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:06,253
She made her best.

1343
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:11,193
You make a choice, then go on.

1344
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,243
Life's too short.

1345
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,053
Compared to what?

1346
01:13:17,617 --> 01:13:19,120
What do you mean?

1347
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,990
I mean, compare our lives

1348
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,260
to the life of a spider.

1349
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,310
They must think we live forever.

1350
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:28,130
Huh. You're right, matia mou.

1351
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:34,513
Life is also very, very long.

1352
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:38,983
So what should I do?

1353
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,163
You know what I'm gonna say.

1354
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:47,140
Yes.

1355
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,520
Now go to sleep, matia mou.

1356
01:13:55,411 --> 01:13:57,244
Karaniecta, matia mou.

1357
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:26,550
Look, it's my life, not yours.

1358
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,700
I'm entitled to play
against somebody else.

1359
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:33,483
Seriously, the silent treatment?

1360
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:35,783
Now who's the six-year-old?

1361
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,870
I need to start making my own decisions,

1362
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:43,710
but I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you in advance, Norman.

1363
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:44,660
That was a mistake.

1364
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:47,563
This is not what I expected.

1365
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:51,260
This is your great teacher?

1366
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,210
She called you Norman.

1367
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:53,310
What's your last name?

1368
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:56,900
It doesn't speak.

1369
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,240
Why am I not surprised?

1370
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:01,240
His name is Norman Wallach.

1371
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,830
(speaking in foreign language)

1372
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:05,750
That's my Tibetan nanny, Tashi.

1373
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,200
My parents insist I only
speak Mandarin with her.

1374
01:15:13,585 --> 01:15:15,840
I have tae kwon do class now.

1375
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,920
Let's play tomorrow here.

1376
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,570
I want Norman to see me beat you.

1377
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,860
I'll bring the clocks.

1378
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:30,193
She's the one you're gonna play against?

1379
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:34,980
You gotta beat her.

1380
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,510
Tell me about it.

1381
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:38,890
She said she's bringing clocks.

1382
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:40,200
What does that mean?

1383
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,720
Chess clocks.

1384
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,553
You only get a certain

1385
01:15:42,553 --> 01:15:43,790
amount of time to make all your moves.

1386
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:45,930
It makes the game move faster.

1387
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:47,490
I always liked that you can control

1388
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:49,360
how fast the game changed.

1389
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,590
Hey, look, chess is change.

1390
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,763
It'd be pretty boring if
the pieces never moved.

1391
01:15:55,763 --> 01:15:58,983
But sometimes you want
things to stay the same.

1392
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:04,028
You know that great
pizza place on West 11th?

1393
01:16:04,028 --> 01:16:04,861
Sure.

1394
01:16:05,972 --> 01:16:07,690
I been there a hundred times.

1395
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:09,659
Seems like that place
has been around forever.

1396
01:16:09,659 --> 01:16:10,780
Yeah, it has been.

1397
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:12,760
But sooner or later, it'll close.

1398
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,932
Every place has to, eventually.

1399
01:16:14,932 --> 01:16:17,733
You just have to enjoy it while it's here.

1400
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:25,020
Enough with the metaphors.

1401
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,530
Then listen.

1402
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:29,540
You can't just use the
same pieces you always use.

1403
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,090
Find new ones.

1404
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,390
Look for one that could be

1405
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:34,393
more valuable than you think it is.

1406
01:16:43,897 --> 01:16:44,980
You can't lose.

1407
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:45,813
You think you're gonna lose,

1408
01:16:45,813 --> 01:16:48,163
give me a signal, and
I'll knock the board over.

1409
01:16:49,278 --> 01:16:50,111
I'm serious.

1410
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:52,993
Back in a sec.

1411
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:56,363
Here's the plan.

1412
01:16:56,363 --> 01:16:58,238
I'm going to pretend to
be blind, and you ask.

1413
01:16:58,238 --> 01:16:59,071
No.

1414
01:16:59,071 --> 01:17:00,890
Come on, I'll go 50-50 with you.

1415
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:01,996
You're underutilized.

1416
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:03,540
Huh?

1417
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,373
Come with me.

1418
01:17:17,275 --> 01:17:20,025
All right, 6 to 1 1/2.

1419
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,173
That can't be right.

1420
01:17:27,033 --> 01:17:28,783
All right, 164 to 41.

1421
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,849
What?

1422
01:17:30,849 --> 01:17:32,472
Ooh!

1423
01:17:32,472 --> 01:17:33,305
What's the count?

1424
01:17:33,305 --> 01:17:36,763
It's, uh, 10,016 to 2,504.

1425
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:38,700
Or it's eight to two.

1426
01:17:39,724 --> 01:17:41,470
It's about as simple as I'm gonna make it.

1427
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:42,770
This is B-ball, after all.

1428
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,713
I don't get it.

1429
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,740
The city is going to help me beat her.

1430
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,073
Go ahead. You're first.

1431
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:25,810
It's eight to two.

1432
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:28,761
This is B-ball, after all.

1433
01:18:28,761 --> 01:18:29,594
So, B4.

1434
01:18:37,238 --> 01:18:39,190
You know, that pawn is you.

1435
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:40,387
What?

1436
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:41,260
(speaking in foreign language)

1437
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:42,480
He's not allowed to coach you.

1438
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,450
It doesn't matter.

1439
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,050
I have no idea what he's saying.

1440
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:32,940
Remember, your board, your city.

1441
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,080
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

1442
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,510
You're a sucky teacher.

1443
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:38,940
Go back to the suburbs where you belong.

1444
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,017
I'm from the Upper West Side, if you.

1445
01:19:40,017 --> 01:19:42,713
Like I said, go back to the suburbs.

1446
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:46,340
I'm sure they never heard of
the Mexican defense there.

1447
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,590
There's no such thing
as the Mexican defense.

1448
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:49,423
Says you.

1449
01:19:54,342 --> 01:19:58,259
(singing in foreign language)

1450
01:20:05,628 --> 01:20:06,545
C, C, C, C.

1451
01:20:08,215 --> 01:20:09,048
C4.

1452
01:20:49,656 --> 01:20:50,989
Pawn takes pawn.

1453
01:21:02,164 --> 01:21:06,081
(speaking in foreign language)

1454
01:21:07,387 --> 01:21:09,300
I wish I understood him.

1455
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,820
Checkmate in three moves.

1456
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:13,703
Unless you find the one move
that wins the game for you.

1457
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,970
Hey, he said it.

1458
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:19,819
I'm just translating.

1459
01:21:19,819 --> 01:21:21,110
You don't speak Russian.

1460
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,430
Oh.

1461
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:26,347
(speaking in foreign language)

1462
01:21:28,099 --> 01:21:29,553
I don't see it.

1463
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:30,456
Look harder.

1464
01:21:30,456 --> 01:21:31,408
I don't see it.

1465
01:21:31,408 --> 01:21:32,308
Look harder.

1466
01:21:32,308 --> 01:21:33,720
You have 20 seconds to make your move,

1467
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,750
or you lose.

1468
01:21:50,203 --> 01:21:52,120
I do not get that.

1469
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,078
10 seconds.

1470
01:21:53,078 --> 01:21:54,745
Take responsibility.

1471
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:57,113
You happen to life.

1472
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,030
Of course.

1473
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:01,970
I'm going to turn into a queen.

1474
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:03,968
My pawn will become a queen in two moves.

1475
01:22:03,968 --> 01:22:06,500
Then checkmate.

1476
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,400
She can't stop me.

1477
01:22:10,642 --> 01:22:11,853
You're gonna win!

1478
01:22:11,853 --> 01:22:12,853
Put it down!

1479
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:22,120
What's wrong? Is there
a problem with the move?

1480
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:22,953
No.

1481
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:29,840
Congratulations.

1482
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,040
Enjoy school without me.

1483
01:22:46,304 --> 01:22:47,721
Very good player.

1484
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:56,166
I don't understand.

1485
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,543
She's coming back to PS 41.

1486
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,380
Just when I was about to win,

1487
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,530
I realized that I didn't want to.

1488
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:05,140
You didn't want to win?

1489
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:08,260
No, I didn't want to go back
to the Blackstone Academy.

1490
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:11,930
Nothing against it, it's just
I've got a fantastic school

1491
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:14,170
that's a five-minute-walk from my house.

1492
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:15,353
I love it there.

1493
01:23:15,353 --> 01:23:17,053
It's my neighborhood school.

1494
01:23:18,737 --> 01:23:21,103
That's what a real city
kid would do, isn't it?

1495
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:25,740
Plus they've got the second-best
chess team in the city.

1496
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,698
Maybe I can put them over the top.

1497
01:23:27,698 --> 01:23:28,612
Yeah.

1498
01:23:28,612 --> 01:23:30,211
Yes, I do.

1499
01:23:30,211 --> 01:23:31,044
You do not.

1500
01:23:31,044 --> 01:23:33,330
That means your wish
will, in fact, come true

1501
01:23:33,330 --> 01:23:34,929
18 years from now.

1502
01:23:34,929 --> 01:23:35,846
- Mama!

1503
01:23:35,846 --> 01:23:36,945
You're back!

1504
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:38,195
Ohh! Hi, honey!

1505
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,213
Oh, I couldn't be away from my girls.

1506
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,900
Yaya.

1507
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,647
What, you're surprised?

1508
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:35,650
I wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1509
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,083
This is the last time.

1510
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,603
You don't need me no more.

1511
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:41,593
I'll always need you.

1512
01:24:41,593 --> 01:24:44,860
Oh, no, that didn't come out right,

1513
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:46,153
but you know what I mean.

1514
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,730
Thank you, Yaya.

1515
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:52,400
Everything worked out okay with your help.

1516
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,943
You did it all yourself.

1517
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:59,573
But I want to answer
that question of yours.

1518
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:02,859
About why things have to change?

1519
01:25:02,859 --> 01:25:03,692
Hmm.

1520
01:25:03,692 --> 01:25:04,983
I think I know the answer.

1521
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,253
Tell me, matia mou.

1522
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:10,970
Because sometimes a great old pizza place

1523
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:14,043
has to close so that a new one can open.

1524
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,733
I hate metaphors.

1525
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:25,023
Say hello to Norman for me.

1526
01:25:47,179 --> 01:25:48,585
What do they want?

1527
01:25:48,585 --> 01:25:49,660
They're trying to convince me to come back

1528
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:52,533
to the Blackstone Academy
after I graduate from PS 41.

1529
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:55,530
You'll have your choice of schools.

1530
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:58,553
They also want you to teach them.

1531
01:25:59,528 --> 01:26:00,893
They're not city kids.

1532
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,450
Maybe we can teach them how to be.

1533
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,293
I guess I could teach you all together.

1534
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:13,473
Three six-year-olds
almost makes a grown-up.

1535
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,583
We're not six.

1536
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:16,416
He knows.

1537
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,310
We'll start tomorrow.

1538
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:21,420
Three kids at once.

1539
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:22,523
I must be an idiot.

1540
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:25,516
It's lucky for you I'm such a softie.

1541
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:29,323
Get out of here!

1542
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:33,293
Hey, Shmuel!

1543
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,200
Don't worry about the next game.

1544
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,263
Enjoy this one.

1545
01:26:41,576 --> 01:26:42,910
Know what I mean?

1546
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:44,050
Yeah.

1547
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:45,580
I'll try.

1548
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:48,523
I'm going to enjoy beating
you, that's for sure.

1549
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,430
You couldn't beat me

1550
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:55,710
if I gave you a bag of
oranges, three hammers,

1551
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:58,810
a baseball bat, and the Brooklyn Dodgers!

1552
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:10,033
Anybody want to play some chess?

1553
01:27:10,033 --> 01:27:12,616
(upbeat music)

1554
01:28:40,112 --> 01:28:41,753
